[32:59] um
[33:01] the subject
[33:05] uh hold on oh there we go
[33:09] I resonate with that
[33:13] this has been an exciting subject for me
[33:15] for a long time
[33:17] and I'm telling you in a long time years
[33:19] yes but you know things just Brew for
[33:21] years and years and years
[33:23] um these thoughts and I got this thought
[33:26] about five years ago but then I about
[33:29] about six seven weeks ago that came on
[33:33] my heart to share it with the church so
[33:35] I've been now really refining it down to
[33:38] what I feel is the Lord's intention
[33:40] tonight
[33:41] hey man who believes that a service
[33:43] doesn't have to be just sit here and
[33:45] listen and learn something but a a an
[33:48] event
[33:49] yes sir hey man so let's make this not
[33:52] just another Wednesday service but by
[33:54] faith this can be an event for you and
[33:57] God
[33:58] Hallelujah sorry I'm keeping you
[33:59] standing
[34:01] um
[34:02] blessed be the God and father of our
[34:04] Lord Jesus Christ who has blessed us
[34:06] with all spiritual blessings in Heavenly
[34:09] places in Christ before I read any
[34:11] further I just want to tell you that
[34:12] this is the symphony okay
[34:15] this is God's Symphony this is and and
[34:18] we're being called to resonate with the
[34:20] symphony okay so I just want to read
[34:23] this with youth thinking in your mind
[34:24] this is God's Symphony and a symphony is
[34:27] a artwork it is an expression of a
[34:30] composer and God is a great composer and
[34:34] he's expressed a symphony of redeeming
[34:37] love expressed and the attributes of his
[34:39] nature expressed to the Earth and to his
[34:41] people so that everything that's in him
[34:43] could be expressed and so as I read this
[34:46] I just want you to have that angle in
[34:48] your heart and mind amen so this is
[34:51] God's Symphony and we'll elaborate on
[34:53] that a bit later so I didn't want to
[34:55] just throw that at you but I just
[34:57] thought it's better to have that Angle
[34:59] now according as he has chosen us and
[35:03] him before the foundation of the world
[35:04] that we should be holy and Without Blame
[35:08] before him in love having predestinated
[35:12] us I'm so glad about that unto the
[35:16] adoption of children by Jesus Christ to
[35:18] himself according to the good pleasure
[35:21] of his will oh my what a will what a
[35:25] will amen he's left us a good one amen
[35:27] and to the praise of the glory of his
[35:30] grace wherein he hath made us accepted
[35:33] in the Beloved
[35:34] in whom we have Redemption I just want
[35:38] you to say that we have Redemption
[35:41] I say I have Redemption Glory it makes
[35:45] me feel real happy
[35:46] through his blood the Forgiveness of
[35:49] sins according to the riches of his
[35:51] grace wherein he hath abounded towards
[35:54] us in all wisdom and Prudence having
[35:56] made known unto us the mystery of his
[35:58] will and should I say having made known
[36:00] unto us his Symphony his composition his
[36:05] great amazing artwork but he has it's
[36:09] expressed from him amen and so the
[36:12] Forgiveness of sins oh sorry I'm going
[36:14] backwards now having made known unto us
[36:16] the mystery of his will according to his
[36:18] good pleasure which he has purposed in
[36:21] himself that in the dispensation of the
[36:24] fullness of times here we are hello
[36:26] we're in the fullness of times right now
[36:28] it's the fullness we're at the end of it
[36:30] all he might gather together all and won
[36:35] all things in Christ both which are in
[36:37] heaven and which are on the earth even
[36:40] in him Amen in whom also we have
[36:43] obtained an inheritance being
[36:44] predestinated according to the purpose
[36:46] of him who worketh all things after the
[36:50] Council of his own will that we should
[36:53] be that we should be to the praise of
[36:56] his glory who first trusted in Christ
[36:59] amen you may be seated God bless his
[37:01] word amen if you can turn that back to
[37:04] these um to the PowerPoint that'll be
[37:07] lovely thank you man did I really do
[37:10] that
[37:11] oh my Allah I want to speak tonight on I
[37:14] resonate with that amen and I believe
[37:17] that tonight the Lord can really speak
[37:19] to us so let me just lay a little
[37:21] Foundation but I just want you to invite
[37:23] the Lord to where you're at
[37:26] I want I I just encourage you now don't
[37:30] let this service pass you by without you
[37:33] coming into a Revival
[37:35] amen amen amen I believe that's the
[37:38] Law's intention tonight
[37:40] and so if you're all stressed or if
[37:43] you're all anxious or you're just busy
[37:46] and you're wound up and there's all this
[37:48] tension in your life Let It Go
[37:51] that's not going to help you you know
[37:53] you might be enjoying all the things
[37:54] that you're doing and everything that's
[37:56] going on and you're busy and all those
[37:58] things but all that's going to do is
[38:00] it's going to rob you of being able to
[38:02] resonate with the word of God being able
[38:05] to resonate with the Symphony of God
[38:08] because you see you're being called to
[38:11] come into resonating a resonant
[38:13] frequency I'm going to I'm going to do
[38:15] some Physics tonight okay so I might
[38:17] just go through that first otherwise
[38:18] I'll start saying things and you'll be
[38:20] like oh my Andy's sang it all again
[38:21] those big long words where did you get
[38:24] those from I don't know they just kind
[38:26] of came Microsoft Word and thesauruses
[38:29] and synonyms okay that's where it all
[38:31] came from what's another word for this
[38:33] it needs to Rhyme or it needs to do this
[38:35] and I kind of found a way to and it just
[38:37] stuck so anyway now I want to before I
[38:40] go any further outmaster copy right do
[38:43] you believe that you have a Master Copy
[38:45] you know and if there's a master copy of
[38:47] you and it's in glory Hallelujah there
[38:51] is a body that is waiting and it says
[38:53] here Paul says in second Corinthians 5
[38:54] verse 1 for we know that if our Earthly
[38:57] House of this Tabernacle we're dissolve
[38:59] this is this body if it died or if it
[39:01] was dissolved we have a building of God
[39:04] and house not made with hands Eternal in
[39:07] the heavens amen that means that there's
[39:09] a master copy of you that has never
[39:12] began it will never end and it's in
[39:15] glory today when I was still in prison
[39:17] the first thing that God revealed to me
[39:19] was that if I was ever going to be there
[39:22] I'm Already There amen so you can rest
[39:25] in that fact that all the stuff that you
[39:28] go through it doesn't matter you're
[39:30] already there amen so you've got a
[39:32] master copy that Master Copy is in
[39:35] Revival
[39:36] oh my that Master Copy it doesn't know
[39:39] no Darkness it doesn't know no fear it
[39:41] doesn't know no sickness it doesn't know
[39:43] anything and that's Master Copy if you
[39:46] could just dip into that sound wave
[39:48] tonight
[39:49] Omar you would start singing out the
[39:51] Symphony of your own life the one that
[39:54] never began and will never end would you
[39:56] like to resonate with that tonight who
[39:58] would like to resonate with their true
[40:00] frequency who would like to vibrate at
[40:03] the vibration of God's love and God's
[40:05] faith and God's joy it's a vibration
[40:07] it's a place and you're there you're
[40:10] there
[40:11] oh my this body oh my goodness it's not
[40:14] there all the time help me Lord you know
[40:16] one of my biggest prayers I say Lord let
[40:18] the Revival that's in my soul come into
[40:20] my body too let the Revival that's in my
[40:23] soul come into my spirit as well and
[40:24] right through me you know sometimes it's
[40:27] just hiding so deep and you know it's
[40:29] there because it's just you know you're
[40:30] so
[40:32] stabilized and God is so real to you
[40:36] and yet you can be struggling and you
[40:38] can be having fights within and you can
[40:40] be having mind battles and you can go
[40:41] through trials and oh my goodness your
[40:44] body and your emotional realm is just so
[40:46] far away from where your soul is
[40:49] because your soul is sealed until the
[40:51] day of your Redemption and it's in your
[40:54] soul has received that portion of the
[40:57] Holy Spirit but just because this world
[40:59] that we live in the sticky nature that
[41:01] we're born with and all the things that
[41:03] we're surrounded by and the things that
[41:05] we feed on the things that we watch and
[41:06] our responsibilities and children and
[41:08] all the pressures and everything that we
[41:10] go through
[41:11] it all just starts to distort in
[41:14] different Realms of our lives and this
[41:16] is why we need to come in and have a
[41:19] refreshing that is why when we come to
[41:21] church make it worthwhile don't just sit
[41:24] there children
[41:25] don't you know if I look at you and I
[41:27] say children doesn't mean that you're a
[41:28] child
[41:29] I just you know sometimes you just look
[41:31] around and you just lock an eye but it
[41:34] doesn't mean I'm Ben knows exactly what
[41:37] I'm talking about sometimes you just
[41:39] happen to lock in and you're saying that
[41:40] very thing and normally you think they
[41:42] think they're saying that to you and all
[41:43] oh lord well you can take it anyway amen
[41:47] we should just take it hallelujah amen
[41:51] so physics now we'll just do a little
[41:54] run of physics and I'm going to show you
[41:55] something so a piano string right
[41:58] um well he's not a real piano in here
[42:01] but the hammer hits the string when you
[42:04] push down this thing right
[42:06] now that's not working now but if you
[42:08] push that down
[42:09] it will in a real piano there's a little
[42:13] hammer and it hits the string and this
[42:16] the string
[42:18] goes like this
[42:20] right
[42:21] it bounces that's called vibration
[42:24] so there you go that's A1 physics
[42:27] that's vibration everything vibrates
[42:29] right
[42:30] and I'm telling you everything
[42:32] that you see in this physical Dimension
[42:35] is vibrating in some way shape or form
[42:37] your your thoughts have frequency but
[42:40] God's love is frequency your heartbeat
[42:41] is vibrating it's vibrating at about 60
[42:44] hertz or whatever you know it's going to
[42:46] do
[42:47] like 60 beats per minute 80 beats per
[42:49] minute is about average between those
[42:51] two
[42:52] um it's vibrating it's got a frequency
[42:55] it's just going up and down it's and so
[42:57] this strength is vibrating
[42:59] and that's its frequency right
[43:01] so here we have another gun remember I'm
[43:03] talking about I resonate with that so
[43:05] I'm going to get into a little bit of
[43:07] resonance because has anyone ever said I
[43:09] resonate with that before
[43:11] it resonates with me
[43:12] feels good I feel like I'm harmonizing
[43:15] with this thing
[43:16] you know sometimes it doesn't resonate
[43:17] and you're like man this vibration is
[43:19] not very good
[43:20] this is a bad Vibe you know I never
[43:22] heard that now we can't trust Vibe
[43:24] either
[43:25] vibrations and emotions and all that
[43:28] room you can't trust it but it can guide
[43:30] you but you can't let it be your
[43:33] ultimate the word of God is your
[43:35] ultimate the Holy Spirit confirming you
[43:37] leading your life is the ultimate but
[43:39] we're in a world of vibration and so
[43:42] there's a lot of these things that we
[43:43] need to see but you see the holy spirit
[43:45] is also vibrating there's resonance see
[43:48] the Lord has got a symphony in its go
[43:50] and there's a lot of people in that
[43:52] Symphony have you noticed in the Bible
[43:54] the Bible is a book of stories of people
[43:57] it's not just this you know we look at
[43:59] this thing and we think oh it's just
[44:01] this big book right before you get saved
[44:03] and you get the Holy Ghost you're like
[44:04] oh my this big book this big book but
[44:07] then when you start to get personal with
[44:09] God he begins to reveal to you that this
[44:11] is a book of people's lives and those
[44:14] people were inspired by God and God used
[44:16] those people they resonated with God's
[44:19] mind and their Master Copy in heaven
[44:21] they begin to play out the music
[44:23] they beat it out the vibration of their
[44:26] own life they became resonant they
[44:29] resonated with who they were they
[44:31] resonated with God's plan for their life
[44:33] and God wrote the Bible with them so if
[44:36] God can write the Bible with them we may
[44:37] resonate how much can God write a Bible
[44:40] with you
[44:41] that people if there was another
[44:42] thousand years it would be the
[44:44] continuation of the book of Acts and
[44:46] they would read your life and get saved
[44:48] by it
[44:49] you know that
[44:51] you can read the life of Ruth and get
[44:54] saved you know that yeah yeah you can
[44:57] read the life of Esther and get say
[44:59] because something in that life has got
[45:00] faith and it was God inspired it
[45:03] resonated sorry I'm getting ahead of
[45:05] myself but let's go back to physics
[45:08] uh who wants to go back to school anyone
[45:10] want to go back to school
[45:12] this is we're just doing real Applied
[45:14] Physics here okay this is really Applied
[45:16] Physics okay we're really going to apply
[45:18] this spiritually
[45:21] that thing there is one sound wave right
[45:24] and that might be uh
[45:28] uh now
[45:29] that has a lot of variance in it but
[45:31] that's okay
[45:33] this sound wave will be
[45:36] [Music]
[45:41] there you go
[45:43] so those four things
[45:46] I'm not going to do the whole octave
[45:47] okay I'm only doing the the fifths
[45:52] no way but I'm gonna get the guitar out
[45:55] soon because there's lots of cool
[45:57] things but um so this thing here is this
[46:01] one is exactly double that one right if
[46:05] that that means that this one and that
[46:07] one will work together
[46:09] that means that they're tuned together
[46:10] and I'm going to talk to you about being
[46:13] tuned soon because it's one of the most
[46:15] important things of your life
[46:17] if you want to resonate with something
[46:19] you need to be tuned to the same key the
[46:21] same
[46:22] frequency
[46:24] it might not necessarily be the same
[46:26] note but it got to be in the same
[46:27] frequency the same key concert C is what
[46:30] they tune Orchestra to unless someone
[46:32] makes a a bold thing to change something
[46:35] that's always going to be where it's at
[46:37] right constant C and that's where they
[46:39] tune in so they're all vibrating in a
[46:41] frequency that all works together right
[46:43] so all of their different instruments
[46:45] are either going to be sound waves that
[46:48] are either this you know and or they're
[46:50] going to be like this or like this or
[46:52] like this right and if it doesn't do
[46:54] that if the patterns don't match up like
[46:56] that and vibrate at proper multiples of
[46:59] of one three sevens and all the numbers
[47:01] of God by the way then it won't work
[47:03] properly it won't sound very nice it'll
[47:06] sound like it's been detuned has anyone
[47:08] ever picked up a detuned instrument it
[47:10] just doesn't sound very good
[47:12] that's how we were born by the way
[47:15] we were born like that so here's a sound
[47:17] wave right and the sound wave like this
[47:19] is very quiet but the light bigger the
[47:22] wave the louder it is
[47:25] the longer the wave the lower it is the
[47:29] higher the wave
[47:33] that was as high as I can go
[47:35] I think
[47:37] would have to get into the nasal cavity
[47:40] probably to go a bit higher than that oh
[47:42] my but I'll definitely be kicked out of
[47:45] the South African men's club if I did
[47:47] that
[47:48] oh my
[47:50] that's a that's a very hard Club to stay
[47:52] in me and Isaac we're just like life
[47:55] unmembered you know
[47:58] oh man I was accepted to me yesterday's
[48:01] like I said Isaac you clean your car he
[48:03] goes man I'm trying to get back into the
[48:04] South African men's club
[48:08] oh my
[48:10] a churning Fork right a tuning fork is
[48:13] actually so the way a tuning fork works
[48:16] is they make it so that when you bang it
[48:18] it's going to bang at a certain pitch
[48:20] and they use these to tune
[48:22] instrumentally in the old days when they
[48:24] didn't have digital they that's what
[48:25] they tuned to and it was a which was 440
[48:28] Hertz which is the based off the main
[48:31] tuning of all instruments and all
[48:33] guitars violins everything and wind
[48:35] instruments all of that stuff is made to
[48:37] be uh tuned to concert C right everyone
[48:41] does anyone know what I'm talking about
[48:43] is anyone here not know what I'm talking
[48:44] about c c is like the like foundational
[48:49] vibration of music for all composite
[48:52] music unless somebody wants to get a bit
[48:55] funny on it and do other things then
[48:57] they that's what they're going to be
[48:58] playing but what I want to talk about
[48:59] here is when you bang this tuning fork
[49:02] this one here which is not even
[49:04] connected
[49:06] begins to sympathetically resonate
[49:10] sympathetic resonance and I want you to
[49:13] realize that you are to your call to
[49:15] sympathetically resonate to
[49:17] now I'm not talking about just
[49:19] sympathizing with the word no but you
[49:22] need to sympathize with the word in
[49:25] another way but not just sympathize
[49:27] because this sympathy that I'm talking
[49:29] about is not that sympathy that sympathy
[49:31] is a different meaning let's just rule
[49:33] that out now okay so if I say sympathize
[49:35] I'm not talking about just kind of
[49:37] sitting on the fence I'm talking about
[49:39] resonating I'm talking about you being
[49:41] interested in such a way that when God
[49:43] speaks you resonate when God speaks your
[49:46] tuning forth starts vibrating too and
[49:48] something happens in your life
[49:50] but for that to happen you need to be at
[49:52] rest
[49:53] I'll just Chuck that and now I'll come
[49:55] back to that a bit later but tuning fork
[49:57] base starts to sympathize so you
[50:00] remember how brother Branham at the end
[50:01] of his ministry he would talk about the
[50:03] symphony and then all of a sudden he
[50:05] starts using the word sympathy and you
[50:07] think oh brother Branham you know I
[50:09] thought at first oh you know he's not
[50:10] really educated so he's thinking
[50:12] sympathy meaning Symphony but actually
[50:14] when you look at it he's actually
[50:15] talking about a proper musical term
[50:17] which is actually the recipient of the
[50:20] symphony which is you you are the
[50:23] sympathy of God's Symphony so that you
[50:26] and you know I was thinking about that
[50:28] one day and I thought thought about my
[50:29] eardrums and I was like my eardrums are
[50:32] sympathy they're sympathizing with sound
[50:35] so when sound comes they start to
[50:37] vibrate to to to to give me the
[50:40] information of what I'm hearing
[50:42] they're sympathetic to the vibration now
[50:45] for that tuning fork this is the point
[50:47] here I'm trying to make now before I get
[50:50] too excited this tuning fork will not
[50:52] resonate unless it's the same tuning as
[50:55] that
[50:56] so that tuning fork had to come off a
[50:58] Master Copy
[51:00] and even though that tuning fork might
[51:01] have been down in the dumps and in a
[51:03] basement for many years and in darkness
[51:05] and maybe never used and all of a sudden
[51:07] it got found and it got brought into the
[51:09] presence of its other tuning fork and
[51:11] then it got vibrating and because it's
[51:14] tuned to it it and it was of the same
[51:16] material it began to harmonize without
[51:19] contact
[51:21] I was thinking today you know I was like
[51:25] what
[51:26] you know and I'm sure the children and
[51:28] we all have the sort Lord why do you not
[51:31] you know I was driving home and I
[51:32] thought why do you not reveal yourself
[51:34] and talk to me like I talk to my friends
[51:35] all the time
[51:37] and I was like Lord and I'm like in a
[51:39] nice way right I'm not being uh I wasn't
[51:41] upset or anything I'm just like Lord
[51:42] having a conversation because I'm like
[51:44] Lord I wanna come and sit with me just
[51:46] come and sit in my car I want to see you
[51:48] I want to talk to you I want to ask you
[51:50] questions let's have a conversation like
[51:52] uh you know like he's sitting there
[51:55] Lord what
[51:56] and he said I'm I'm moving in a
[51:59] crescendo
[52:00] I want the meeting to be glorious
[52:03] I want the marriage suffer to be amazing
[52:06] amen and so if we just knew him all the
[52:07] time in which he sat in the servant he
[52:09] gave hey is Jesus here and you can see
[52:12] him physically right and he talks you
[52:13] can ask him everything you want and he
[52:15] knows everything so he can tell you and
[52:17] you all the Miracles just happen easily
[52:18] what appreciation would you have in the
[52:21] crescendo of his Symphony
[52:23] so he spoke that to me in my heart
[52:26] I'm forming I'm building a crescendo
[52:28] here
[52:29] just hang tight you know don't just get
[52:32] ahead of yourself you will see me at the
[52:34] marriage supper children
[52:36] and my children I'm sure every child and
[52:39] everyone in the world thinks why is it
[52:42] if God is real that he doesn't show
[52:44] himself like that
[52:45] and that was what he came and I was just
[52:47] thinking that it's because he's actually
[52:49] building something here he's holding
[52:51] back do you think he doesn't want to see
[52:52] you he doesn't want to just sit with you
[52:54] you know what he does
[52:57] he sits in you but you see he's just
[53:00] there's just the point portion of him
[53:02] that he holds back until the marriage
[53:04] supper of the Lamb that when you're in
[53:05] your glorified condition you'll see him
[53:08] but right now
[53:10] right now you've got to have something
[53:12] to look forward to right
[53:14] so
[53:16] let's go back now
[53:20] I was praying a lot about what to put
[53:22] here because I'm about to do something
[53:23] that um
[53:25] and I thought Lord how am I going to
[53:26] just bring this into the right
[53:28] atmosphere and then this can't this
[53:30] scripture came in the next one now as I
[53:33] think brother Ben preached on it I don't
[53:35] know if it was Sunday or a couple of
[53:36] weeks ago when he talked about being in
[53:39] laodicea which is the seventh Church age
[53:41] which is the church age that we own
[53:42] physically
[53:44] the we're not exempt from the troubles
[53:48] we're not exempt from The Temptations
[53:49] we're not exempt from the spirit if you
[53:51] have blinkers on you will come under
[53:53] these Spirits because you're not being
[53:55] ready to fight them or to discern them
[53:58] when they come into your home and come
[53:59] into your life and come into your
[54:01] schedule
[54:02] you see your schedule is something that
[54:04] can be used against you as a weapon
[54:06] and if you don't watch your schedule I'm
[54:08] talking to myself now by the way if we
[54:10] don't watch our schedule
[54:12] it will grip our lives and it's like an
[54:14] abyss and it just takes us and it
[54:16] consumes us until we don't even spend
[54:18] time with God anymore we don't even have
[54:20] and when we do we're just so tense
[54:23] that we can't even sympathize with his
[54:25] Symphony that he's speaking to us
[54:30] who wants God to speak to them who wants
[54:32] to be in Revival
[54:33] you see your Master Copy is in Revival
[54:36] there's no clouds and Glory
[54:38] do you know that there's no clouds in
[54:40] heaven there's no rain Hallelujah the
[54:42] only rain is the reign of the Holy Ghost
[54:44] and it's constant and it's glorious
[54:47] that's where you are
[54:49] now if you could just come into rest
[54:52] and you could just really watch and
[54:54] discern
[54:56] you won't leave your first love
[54:59] the Lord was speaking over this church
[55:01] age Ephesians I think
[55:04] and he had nothing bad to say
[55:07] all the way up until here
[55:08] just all the good things I'm commending
[55:11] you for this I'm convenient they were
[55:12] hard workers and all of that but you see
[55:14] now he comes down to this but I have
[55:17] someone against you because you have
[55:19] left your first love
[55:21] and I just want to leave that there for
[55:23] now Matthew 25 5 while the bridegroom
[55:26] tarried
[55:28] now this is the foolish and wise virgins
[55:30] right
[55:31] they all
[55:34] so if that's his day or and that was
[55:37] Jesus speaking a parable then we're
[55:40] involved we're involved
[55:43] slumbered and slipped
[55:48] so just keep that in mind because yes we
[55:51] have the fullness of truth yes God has
[55:54] expressed the mystery of his will and
[55:56] he's done great things in our generation
[55:58] to put the bridegroom call is coming
[56:01] down through this message to call a
[56:04] bride to a Rapture right
[56:06] to call people from an organizational
[56:08] mindset and Unholy living in the church
[56:11] by the way and out of it to a life of
[56:14] Holiness a life of of life change and
[56:18] and a real marriage Union through the
[56:20] baptism of the Holy Ghost and I'm not
[56:23] talking about a Pentecostal
[56:24] denominational baptism of the Holy Ghost
[56:26] that's just gifts restored and
[56:28] anointings but I'm talking about a
[56:30] personal revelation of Jesus Christ and
[56:32] the full measure of his loving person in
[56:35] you
[56:35] to change you to give you victory over
[56:38] the elements of your flesh so that you
[56:40] can live above sin so that when you come
[56:42] against any enemy you'll conquer them
[56:45] Glory
[56:47] amen no matter what comes away with the
[56:50] true baptism of the Holy Ghost you have
[56:52] prevailed
[56:55] providing you can stay at rest and you
[56:58] can discern your schedule discern what
[57:00] you've got to do to sit in your workload
[57:01] because the devil will keep you busy
[57:03] doing good things
[57:04] good things
[57:06] even the Lord's work
[57:08] but are you working for God or Walking
[57:10] with God that stands quoting
[57:14] are you working for God that really like
[57:17] that was really striking to me are you
[57:19] working for him or or walking with him
[57:22] it's a big difference
[57:25] because you see all these things in
[57:27] these pressures and everything like that
[57:28] can just it starts to take us so that
[57:31] our I'm going to bring and introduce a
[57:33] new word and you're going to see what it
[57:35] is soon stylus
[57:36] right
[57:38] now a stylist is a little thing that
[57:41] goes on the record that picks up the
[57:43] sound wave
[57:45] all right and then it takes that sound
[57:47] wave on the record and it amplifies it
[57:49] you can hear the music
[57:51] but if that Stylus is broken or if it's
[57:54] gone old and it's stiff and it's not
[57:56] truly being able to to sympathize with
[57:58] the sound wave it will not be able to
[58:00] play this music very well will it and it
[58:03] might just give you a crackly
[58:04] representation how many of you are
[58:06] sitting here with a crackly
[58:07] representation of your sound waves of
[58:09] your true self of your Master Copy by
[58:12] the way the master copies of all LPS
[58:15] when they made them with a Master Copy
[58:17] was set in in gold
[58:20] gold-plated and they gold plated these
[58:22] things and they they did so much to them
[58:24] to make them last forever
[58:26] so this Master Copy I'll get there
[58:30] but first of all
[58:31] I want to do something I want to give
[58:33] you a little demo
[58:35] the guitarists are going to be
[58:38] a bit worried right now
[58:40] ah I don't use this one
[58:43] I'll use this one
[58:46] can I unplug this
[58:48] is that all right is it elf
[58:51] okay
[58:52] so
[58:55] oh man I'm feeling like I'm just gonna
[58:57] take too much time here but
[58:59] look
[59:03] now
[59:05] we are called
[59:07] see this
[59:09] [Music]
[59:13] that's actually Out Of Tune by the way
[59:17] [Music]
[59:19] it's a bit better
[59:22] anyway we won't worry about that but
[59:25] what we'll do is you see God wants to
[59:29] take you as an instrument in his
[59:31] Symphony in his orchestra right and he
[59:33] wants you to be in Harmony and see these
[59:35] strings when you pull these strings see
[59:37] that actually vibrates
[59:39] that's vibrating it's going up and down
[59:41] it's like a sound wave
[59:43] and then that one
[59:45] that's also a sound wave but if you go
[59:48] like this
[59:50] [Music]
[1:00:08] see it sounds beautiful see there's
[1:00:11] someone that knows how to bring out in
[1:00:14] this what's inside it the potential
[1:00:15] that's within it and it's tuned and so
[1:00:18] it's it's in harmony with the very
[1:00:20] desire of the of the musician
[1:00:24] and you could say that what's been
[1:00:27] expressed in the mind of the musician
[1:00:29] and the instrument is tuned right the
[1:00:33] instrument is in tune it's not it's not
[1:00:35] um giving a a false representation of
[1:00:38] its true self so this guitar is in its
[1:00:42] Master Copy State it's in its state
[1:00:45] where it's designed to be right and we
[1:00:48] are meant to we're designed to be tuned
[1:00:50] we're designed to be in harmony all of
[1:00:52] our strings and I did this in Sunday
[1:00:54] school so both Sunday schools know
[1:00:56] exactly what this is so I actually did
[1:00:59] this as an example and I said look when
[1:01:01] you're there's six strings of your life
[1:01:03] it's who it's you it's it's who you are
[1:01:06] and I the first one was home that's what
[1:01:08] you that's who you are at home is what
[1:01:10] you're meant to be at home school
[1:01:13] Church
[1:01:14] Church lunch which can be very different
[1:01:16] sometimes
[1:01:18] hey children
[1:01:21] they can be very Pious in church singing
[1:01:23] and then at church lunch oh my what's
[1:01:26] going on now fighting and oh man but you
[1:01:29] know this is out right and I went
[1:01:31] through these things with the children
[1:01:32] but I said and then there was
[1:01:34] um
[1:01:35] skull and sports or whatever else
[1:01:38] Hobbies
[1:01:39] by yourself that's right alone time I
[1:01:42] did alone time and that's your time
[1:01:43] where who you really are right and
[1:01:46] anyway I said now that's meant to be
[1:01:47] sounding like this
[1:01:52] tune right the purpose of you is meant
[1:01:55] to be all turned and sounding nice
[1:01:57] everything's in harmony all these sound
[1:01:59] waves are all vibrating right and watch
[1:02:01] this watch this
[1:02:11] if I had this Amplified you'd hear all
[1:02:13] these other strings now are actually
[1:02:15] starting to vibrate what they're doing
[1:02:18] is they're resonating it's called
[1:02:19] resonance because they are tuned to the
[1:02:23] same notes as these strings they will
[1:02:27] start to sympathize
[1:02:28] they will start to energize
[1:02:31] when there is an expression of the
[1:02:34] symphony
[1:02:35] [Music]
[1:02:38] the symphony if it's true if the rest of
[1:02:42] the strings are tuned they will
[1:02:43] harmonize and everything will become a
[1:02:45] beautiful sound right but what happens
[1:02:48] is
[1:02:49] life and all of it
[1:02:52] starts to
[1:02:56] I'm getting myself in trouble
[1:03:02] don't do this at home children
[1:03:04] especially mine
[1:03:06] now this is kind of how we were born in
[1:03:08] sin shaped in iniquity come to the world
[1:03:10] speaking lies right and then our lives
[1:03:12] start to go like this
[1:03:14] and so you see now people are trying to
[1:03:17] play you right
[1:03:18] [Music]
[1:03:21] God's trying to use you
[1:03:23] but this is you this is a lot of us is
[1:03:25] like this
[1:03:27] it doesn't sound very good does it
[1:03:29] [Music]
[1:03:36] doesn't sound very good
[1:03:38] so I'm going to I'm this is representing
[1:03:41] what us right so this is what sometimes
[1:03:44] this is like us really I'm going to put
[1:03:47] that there because that's where I sit so
[1:03:50] and then I'm not framing anybody
[1:03:54] I'm not saying I'm like that right now
[1:03:56] but I'm we've got the Lord's working on
[1:03:58] us but sometimes we can be in that
[1:04:00] condition where there's all the strings
[1:04:02] are out and who we are at church is not
[1:04:04] who we are at home and who we are at
[1:04:06] home is not who we are at work and we've
[1:04:07] got all these personalities I tell you
[1:04:09] what that's a very stressful thing
[1:04:11] and and we're born like that but then
[1:04:13] what God does is he says I'm going to
[1:04:15] take you and when you're born that way
[1:04:17] and I'm going to bring you back to what
[1:04:19] you're meant to be I'm going to but what
[1:04:21] you've got to do is you've got to let me
[1:04:24] do it you've got to rest in me he says
[1:04:26] come unto me all you that labor and I
[1:04:29] will give you rest stop resisting
[1:04:32] stop being stiff-necked and stop
[1:04:34] resisting the Holy Ghost and God will
[1:04:37] use you mightily and he will bring you
[1:04:39] so that you're perfectly tuned
[1:04:41] he will take that from a detuned state
[1:04:43] that's how we exist without God right
[1:04:45] and then and then what happens sometimes
[1:04:47] though is God does that for us and we
[1:04:48] get tuned to add up and we go to camp
[1:04:50] and we have an awesome time and we get a
[1:04:53] fresh filling of the Holy Ghost and you
[1:04:54] come into a Revival and then you get
[1:04:56] back out and within about six months
[1:04:58] you've just met the the world's creeping
[1:05:01] or Something's Happened in your life and
[1:05:03] you've just gotten too busy and your
[1:05:04] prayer Life Starts to wane and you or
[1:05:06] maybe you're praying and you might be
[1:05:08] praying an hour a day
[1:05:10] but it's not really quality prayer it's
[1:05:13] just dutiful prayer you're just working
[1:05:14] in prayer you're laboring you're slaving
[1:05:17] and prayer to uh fear that you're not
[1:05:20] praying enough
[1:05:22] this can happen and then you miss the
[1:05:25] essence of prayer where and then there's
[1:05:26] somebody else that prays for one minute
[1:05:28] but God comes down and it changes
[1:05:31] everything and they get calibrated every
[1:05:32] day
[1:05:33] I tell you what it's not about the the
[1:05:35] quantity it's the quality
[1:05:38] and the quality is what will tune you
[1:05:40] back
[1:05:42] because this flesh will as I'll tell you
[1:05:44] what this flesh teams up with the devil
[1:05:46] a lot
[1:05:47] the Devil comes in with a coalition
[1:05:49] government trying to to overthrow the
[1:05:52] government inside you that's a war
[1:05:53] expect it
[1:05:56] if you're baptized with the Holy Ghost
[1:05:58] expect War expect the devil's going to
[1:06:00] try everything he can to detune you
[1:06:03] and every now and again he succeeds in
[1:06:05] making us a bit detuned right and so
[1:06:07] there we are
[1:06:08] and if you want to you can put yourself
[1:06:10] there if you like
[1:06:12] we know where we're at
[1:06:16] I just want to tell you though
[1:06:18] don't leave the service like that
[1:06:21] don't leave that way you don't have to
[1:06:23] leave that way and you don't have to
[1:06:25] stay that way and you don't have to come
[1:06:27] back like that you don't have to right
[1:06:29] because
[1:06:30] I've got a name that's written up in
[1:06:33] glory
[1:06:34] and he's waiting in the heavens right
[1:06:36] your your real self your Master Copy is
[1:06:38] there then there's no clouds
[1:06:40] Hallelujah let me move on man we will
[1:06:42] never get anywhere teach my now Psalm 86
[1:06:45] 11 teach me thy way O Lord I will walk
[1:06:48] in my truth unite my heart
[1:06:52] pray it
[1:06:53] Lord unite my heart what does it bring
[1:06:56] my heart into harmony
[1:06:58] you know your heart can be desperately
[1:07:00] wicked the Bible says in Jeremiah but
[1:07:03] what if God comes in and says I'm going
[1:07:05] to take that heart out I'm going to give
[1:07:06] you a heart of Flesh you know he says I
[1:07:08] will five times
[1:07:10] and some sorry in Ezekiel 36 amen and
[1:07:13] Ezekiel serious I'm going to read that
[1:07:14] later
[1:07:15] and remember God's intention for you
[1:07:17] tonight is to unite your heart to bring
[1:07:19] your heart back into calibration he says
[1:07:22] it five times and I believe God's
[1:07:23] intention is he doesn't want us to be
[1:07:25] like that
[1:07:26] who doesn't want us to be detuned see he
[1:07:29] made you for a purpose so that you would
[1:07:31] sound beautiful he made you for a
[1:07:33] purpose that your life would represent
[1:07:34] your origin which is true sincerity by
[1:07:37] the way
[1:07:38] true sincerity is representing your
[1:07:40] origin but you see this world is just so
[1:07:44] engineered to take us away
[1:07:50] the scripture is God's Symphony yes
[1:07:53] Hallelujah only the composer knows what
[1:07:55] it really means and he now here this is
[1:07:58] one of the biggest key points of the
[1:07:59] sermon
[1:08:01] and he reveals it to those who are
[1:08:02] listening who are interested
[1:08:06] in knowing who's interested
[1:08:09] are you interested in God Symphony
[1:08:12] are you interested in the word of God
[1:08:15] we can have our own powerful
[1:08:16] intelligence
[1:08:18] and we can know everything go and do a
[1:08:20] doctorate of theology how many ministers
[1:08:23] out there in denominational world who
[1:08:25] knows everything about all the stories
[1:08:26] of the Bible but they don't even know
[1:08:27] the god of the Bible
[1:08:29] because they've got their own ideas but
[1:08:31] see and they're not even interested in
[1:08:33] the in
[1:08:34] God's composition
[1:08:36] you have to get in the spirit of the
[1:08:38] composer
[1:08:40] interested in knowing what the drama is
[1:08:45] you don't need any
[1:08:47] drama soap operas no drama TV shows you
[1:08:52] don't need that
[1:08:53] I'll tell you what storytelling we just
[1:08:56] get suckered into a story human beings
[1:08:59] but what about God's story yeah
[1:09:01] God's story is his story which is
[1:09:04] history
[1:09:05] right
[1:09:06] it's his story
[1:09:08] Symphony means an elaborate musical
[1:09:10] composition for full Orchestra typically
[1:09:13] in four movements at least one of which
[1:09:16] is traditionally in Sonata form which
[1:09:18] has three movements within a movement to
[1:09:20] develop the first thought okay and
[1:09:23] that's just beside the point but four
[1:09:25] movements and I was like wow this is
[1:09:26] interesting you see there's two
[1:09:28] symphonies in this world
[1:09:30] that's it really yeah yeah it comes from
[1:09:33] two sources
[1:09:34] there's the Symphony of God
[1:09:37] and there's the Symphony of Satan
[1:09:39] that's it and everything that you hear
[1:09:42] see feel experience
[1:09:44] is rooted in one of the two
[1:09:47] until what person are you going to yield
[1:09:50] to get your life entertainment
[1:09:57] two
[1:10:00] stylist that
[1:10:01] pinwave pick up what are you going to
[1:10:04] rest in
[1:10:05] because you can rest in entertainment
[1:10:07] and get your comfort from entertainment
[1:10:09] get your comfort from YouTube get your
[1:10:10] comfort from games get your comfort from
[1:10:13] Sports get your comfort from all these
[1:10:14] things but what move what are you going
[1:10:17] to yield yourself to
[1:10:19] because there's only two and there's
[1:10:21] four movements in each Symphony
[1:10:23] the four movements of God's Symphony
[1:10:26] Hallelujah there's the lion the ox the
[1:10:28] man and the eagle
[1:10:31] expressing God's anointing to his people
[1:10:34] to combat the devil
[1:10:36] and the the four movements and Satan is
[1:10:38] the the white horse rider
[1:10:41] the red horse rider the black horse
[1:10:43] rider and the pale horse rider
[1:10:45] deceit
[1:10:47] war and persecution economic pressure
[1:10:51] and darkness and then all three mixed
[1:10:53] together
[1:10:54] which is also seen in the Kanga worm the
[1:10:57] Locust the Palm room and the caterpillar
[1:10:59] so you see the devil's got his Symphony
[1:11:02] with his movements to destroy but God's
[1:11:05] got his Symphony with his four movements
[1:11:07] to destroy the Devil and what anointing
[1:11:10] are you going to yield to yeah what will
[1:11:13] you yield to what are you going to yield
[1:11:15] to I think that's the next scripture he
[1:11:16] said is unto what origin will you the
[1:11:19] instrument
[1:11:22] [Music]
[1:11:23] hopefully it doesn't sound like that
[1:11:26] oh
[1:11:28] we'll see we'll just see what happens
[1:11:29] know you not that to to whom I like I I
[1:11:33] highlighted whom because it's not just
[1:11:35] something it's someone yeah to whom you
[1:11:39] yield yourselves servants to obey his
[1:11:41] servants you are to whom you obey
[1:11:43] whether of sin unto death or of
[1:11:44] obedience unto righteousness
[1:11:47] Prophet says let's get back and get the
[1:11:49] symphony playing right
[1:11:52] let's get our instruments turned don't
[1:11:54] leave the service if there's one string
[1:11:56] of your life Unturned
[1:11:59] let God tune you
[1:12:01] he's here to heal he's intentionally
[1:12:03] here
[1:12:04] do you think that I just come up with
[1:12:06] this to speak no
[1:12:08] I believe the Lord inspired us because
[1:12:10] there's somebody in this room that needs
[1:12:12] to be tuned
[1:12:14] it doesn't matter if it's just for one
[1:12:16] person
[1:12:17] yeah and maybe it's just for me but I'm
[1:12:19] saying Lord tune me I want to be right
[1:12:21] in Juno you know you can get micro
[1:12:23] tuning too
[1:12:24] oh man and sometimes it attempts the
[1:12:27] trained here to hear that that string is
[1:12:29] just off a little bit and then you get
[1:12:31] your tree of knowledge out there and you
[1:12:32] took it on there and it's like oh yes
[1:12:33] it's a little talk off and you just and
[1:12:35] it go and you hit it it goes bing bing
[1:12:37] bing whatever to tell you it's right on
[1:12:40] hey Josh
[1:12:41] I'm like tuna right on
[1:12:45] Jesus said if I be lifted up from this
[1:12:47] Earth I'll draw all man unto me and he's
[1:12:50] the same yesterday today and forever let
[1:12:52] the directors get in the right spirit
[1:12:55] with the musicians and with the composer
[1:12:59] that's the key and this is that you
[1:13:01] could call this the expression of how
[1:13:03] God's done it for us as a people and as
[1:13:06] individuals
[1:13:08] the the whole world was groping in
[1:13:10] darkness and and the Dark Ages the
[1:13:13] church was fine and then all of a sudden
[1:13:15] the the bugs you know the devil started
[1:13:17] creeping in with the white horse rider
[1:13:19] which posed as Christ but he was
[1:13:21] deceiving and then under the red horse
[1:13:23] rider began to kill and destroy and then
[1:13:26] under the black horse rider you know
[1:13:27] NASA's over hundreds of years now under
[1:13:29] the black horse rider put a Dark Age
[1:13:31] over the church and over the True
[1:13:32] Believer and over the society as a whole
[1:13:35] and and put economic pressure through
[1:13:37] taking the money of the whole world by
[1:13:39] causing people to pray for prayers and
[1:13:41] all those things and coming under a
[1:13:43] great tyranny and the Pope the Catholic
[1:13:45] church had full control
[1:13:48] superstitiously over all the Earth the
[1:13:51] known Earth and then all of a sudden the
[1:13:53] world of the church is in is under such
[1:13:56] pressure they're hidden down in the
[1:13:57] ground
[1:13:59] completely hidden
[1:14:01] down in the Dark Ages but then God began
[1:14:03] to restore
[1:14:04] and He restored through looser
[1:14:08] many restored through Wesley just a
[1:14:10] little bit by little bit and and and and
[1:14:12] as these things restored a
[1:14:14] denominational tree grew because at
[1:14:16] every Point instead of moving on with
[1:14:18] God they they camped around their
[1:14:20] theology
[1:14:21] they took a photo of what their founder
[1:14:23] believed and that was it they never
[1:14:25] moved on
[1:14:26] and they died
[1:14:28] that's why every denomination is dead
[1:14:30] dead dead
[1:14:32] that's why they need all this the
[1:14:34] powerful music and all of the
[1:14:35] entertainment and to take away Holiness
[1:14:37] so that the people will stay can you
[1:14:39] imagine if these denominations said you
[1:14:41] guys have got to live holy and don't do
[1:14:43] any sinful things no drinking no smoking
[1:14:45] and and make them live as if they are
[1:14:47] delivered
[1:14:48] make them live as if the Holy Ghost is
[1:14:50] there they will not even stay
[1:14:53] the only way to get those churches full
[1:14:54] is by entertaining the people and giving
[1:14:56] them preaching what they want to hear
[1:15:00] so anyway this has all happened right
[1:15:02] but you see now God is expressing a
[1:15:04] symphony but you see now he has to now
[1:15:07] fully reveal everything that's in his
[1:15:09] Symphony so that the people can get in
[1:15:11] the fullness of God's spirit in the
[1:15:13] composer but the church was out of whack
[1:15:17] and I'm telling you even in all the
[1:15:19] revivals that she had she was still not
[1:15:21] quite there because God wasn't finished
[1:15:24] yeah so what does he do he now says you
[1:15:26] know what in the end time I'm going to
[1:15:28] now send a director down
[1:15:31] I'm the composer and I'm going to send a
[1:15:35] director down I'm going to send a major
[1:15:36] profit like Moses who believes Moses was
[1:15:38] a director in the time of The Exodus
[1:15:41] God used to me he even said I will you
[1:15:44] will be God and Aaron will be your
[1:15:45] Prophet I mean far out I mean how much
[1:15:48] can you elevate a man right God elevated
[1:15:50] Moses to God oh my goodness
[1:15:52] anyway I'm not doing that to our Prophet
[1:15:54] but I'm just saying that God did that
[1:15:57] right because he was a director but God
[1:15:59] sent a major prophet in the end of the
[1:16:01] seventh Church age which was William
[1:16:03] Branham a major word Prophet to what to
[1:16:06] reveal the spirit of the composer to
[1:16:09] reveal the symphony in its in its pure
[1:16:12] form
[1:16:12] so that the people and what I want to
[1:16:15] call in our Symphonies because we might
[1:16:17] as well use the Symphonies that we go
[1:16:19] there is a conductor which is what he's
[1:16:21] calling the director right a conductor
[1:16:23] is that person who's been to a symphony
[1:16:24] before you know I've been to a symphony
[1:16:26] orchestra Jonah have you been there yes
[1:16:28] I thought you had
[1:16:31] and then who who seen the conductor does
[1:16:34] the conductor just sit there like this
[1:16:40] oh it's time to go no
[1:16:43] does that conduct again in the spirit of
[1:16:45] the composer that conductor is an
[1:16:47] extension of the composer he's right
[1:16:50] into it
[1:16:52] and sing hard
[1:16:54] he's preaching the music
[1:16:57] and he's going like this and he knows he
[1:17:00] could be just as friend with Beethoven
[1:17:02] as if Beethoven's standing there and
[1:17:04] he's gunning it and he's extracted out
[1:17:07] of Beethoven's mind heart his every
[1:17:10] intention for that expression of
[1:17:12] symphony and that's just for a man what
[1:17:14] about God sending a prophet in the end
[1:17:16] time who would bring a prophet into the
[1:17:18] spirit of the composer who would preach
[1:17:21] Hallelujah the the fullness of God
[1:17:24] to the people
[1:17:26] what is that the the very conductor
[1:17:30] being sent to the seventh Church age to
[1:17:33] take a people back into the spirit of
[1:17:35] the composer and then what does he do he
[1:17:37] sets up a concert Master does anyone
[1:17:40] know what a concert Master is
[1:17:42] so a concert master in Orchestra is like
[1:17:46] the next one down from the
[1:17:48] um from the conductor
[1:17:50] and there now boss of the instruments
[1:17:53] you could say and they now is like the
[1:17:57] pastors you see a pasta has been given a
[1:18:00] jurisdiction over a local body but you
[1:18:03] see their anointing is to connect them
[1:18:06] to the
[1:18:07] um I mean these terminologies conductor
[1:18:10] oh mate my brain
[1:18:13] the conductor
[1:18:15] is connected to the concert Master the
[1:18:17] pastors are connected to the conductors
[1:18:19] so that they can see and they're
[1:18:21] Anointed with the same anointing to get
[1:18:23] the people in the spirit of the composer
[1:18:25] to keep the people moving in the
[1:18:27] symphony Hallelujah and there's
[1:18:29] obviously other Ministries as well but
[1:18:31] we're not going to go down that route
[1:18:33] so we have these times of the Symphony
[1:18:36] of God's word that the whole drama
[1:18:38] changes
[1:18:39] you who are interested
[1:18:41] listen for that chain you see there's
[1:18:44] someone that's in the orchestra if you
[1:18:46] know right now now it's we're not now
[1:18:49] it's not pastas it's not conductors it's
[1:18:52] not directors it's composer and you
[1:18:55] what are you doing
[1:18:57] you're now sitting in the orchestra now
[1:18:59] and you should know right
[1:19:01] because you're connected to that
[1:19:03] conductor you're seeing them you're
[1:19:05] you're connected to the the spirit of
[1:19:07] the composers by what God has done for
[1:19:09] you by what God has done is provided for
[1:19:12] us a whole setup here so that we can be
[1:19:15] in the spirit of his great Symphony
[1:19:17] right and now those who are interested
[1:19:19] are listening for the change
[1:19:23] are you listening for the change Malachi
[1:19:25] are you listening for the change Debbie
[1:19:30] oh yeah please don't talk to me
[1:19:32] please don't look at me Andy
[1:19:35] are you listening for that change right
[1:19:38] there's this desire to know and to know
[1:19:42] that it's coming does everyone know
[1:19:44] there's a change coming
[1:19:45] is everyone excited by the change that's
[1:19:47] coming has everyone stirred up in faith
[1:19:50] because there is a change coming and
[1:19:52] lives are going to change and we're
[1:19:53] going to receive new body
[1:19:55] Hallelujah those that are alive and
[1:19:57] remain shall be caught up together with
[1:19:58] those that are dead in Christ and we
[1:20:01] shall be going to be with the Lord
[1:20:03] forever right so there's a change coming
[1:20:05] and we know then the sheet music is
[1:20:06] beating out are you in the Rhythm
[1:20:09] how you are you eyeballing that that
[1:20:11] conductor
[1:20:12] amen I'll tell you what I was at the
[1:20:14] Wellington Symphony Orchestra and me and
[1:20:16] Becca got to sit behind the orchestra
[1:20:18] and you really get a whole new
[1:20:20] perspective
[1:20:22] all I've ever seen is this
[1:20:25] you know you're behind the conductor and
[1:20:27] he's doing this and this and he goes
[1:20:29] like listen does these things but when
[1:20:31] you're on this side which is where
[1:20:33] you're meant to be now he's looking he's
[1:20:36] eyeballing and he's connected and they
[1:20:38] can see his facial expressions and he's
[1:20:40] going come on and he's doing all these
[1:20:42] things and there's a lot of micro
[1:20:43] Expressions going on God wants you to
[1:20:45] see them yeah he wants you to see his
[1:20:48] micro Expressions he wants you to get in
[1:20:50] the spirit he wants you to be interested
[1:20:52] in a symphony
[1:20:54] Hallelujah I tell you what you can make
[1:20:56] yourself interested in the symphony but
[1:20:58] that can be alongside all these other
[1:21:00] things that you're doing all these other
[1:21:02] interests that you have all these other
[1:21:04] hobbies that you perform all these other
[1:21:07] sports that you play all these other
[1:21:09] things that you have busied your
[1:21:11] schedule with
[1:21:13] and God's just part of it
[1:21:15] he wants to be all of it that doesn't
[1:21:17] mean you have to give up everything I'm
[1:21:19] just saying he wants to be the very
[1:21:22] essence of your being he wants you to be
[1:21:24] in such a place that you're listening
[1:21:26] for
[1:21:28] you know it's getting close you hear the
[1:21:30] way the drums are beating amen you want
[1:21:33] something to happen who wants something
[1:21:36] to happen right now who wants Revival in
[1:21:38] their lives who wants a life change who
[1:21:41] wants their children saved who wants
[1:21:43] Revival in their home who wants Revival
[1:21:45] in this church why don't you just go and
[1:21:47] give God praise and ask for that Revival
[1:21:50] and call on his name and listen for that
[1:21:52] change because the beat music is about
[1:21:54] to change soon and things are happening
[1:21:56] and it's an exciting time let me say who
[1:21:59] knows what a crescendo is
[1:22:03] quiet and there's not much seemingly
[1:22:06] going on in the symphony then all of a
[1:22:08] sudden you hear these the drums
[1:22:16] [Music]
[1:22:21] and then
[1:22:24] and the triangle man gets his place
[1:22:27] Hallelujah
[1:22:28] The Triangle Man goes Ding and all of a
[1:22:31] sudden there's a people that are excited
[1:22:34] because you knew it was coming yeah
[1:22:35] that's why God begins to reveal things
[1:22:37] to you before it happens so that you can
[1:22:39] get excited
[1:22:41] Hallelujah
[1:22:43] unfortunately there's still people that
[1:22:46] are sitting there and they'll go I
[1:22:49] what's going on here
[1:22:52] what's happening you know and they're
[1:22:54] not really interested and I've been at
[1:22:56] orchestras and you know a lot a lot of
[1:22:59] the people are just there because their
[1:23:01] children are playing in the orchestra so
[1:23:02] they don't even but then there's people
[1:23:03] that have paid for those tickets
[1:23:06] hey man and God wants you to give your
[1:23:07] life and if you give your life I'm
[1:23:10] telling you if you give your life you
[1:23:12] will receive the excitement of the
[1:23:14] symphony and you will want something to
[1:23:18] and it will be a good thing
[1:23:20] Hallelujah you know this is a change see
[1:23:23] it's going to break out
[1:23:26] oh my
[1:23:27] who's watching
[1:23:29] I just talked about Wellington's
[1:23:30] Orchestra
[1:23:32] for we which have believed do enter into
[1:23:34] rest as he has said as I have sworn in
[1:23:37] my wrath that they shall enter into my
[1:23:39] rest although the works were finished
[1:23:42] from the foundation of the world skip
[1:23:45] down to verse 7 Hebrews 4 7 it gives
[1:23:48] again he limited a certain day saying in
[1:23:51] David
[1:23:52] today after so long a time as it has
[1:23:54] said today if you will hear his voice
[1:23:57] Harden not your heart
[1:23:59] you know the word Harden means to become
[1:24:01] obstinate
[1:24:03] and to become hard
[1:24:05] to become immovable to not anything
[1:24:09] you might be hardened towards the devil
[1:24:12] but you also can be hardened towards God
[1:24:13] too
[1:24:15] you've got to be Discerning on what
[1:24:16] you're hard towards
[1:24:18] yes we should be hard towards the devil
[1:24:20] of course we should resist the devil and
[1:24:22] he will flee but don't keep everything
[1:24:24] hard don't Harden all your heart and
[1:24:27] elements of your receptacle the way that
[1:24:30] God can speak to you don't run don't
[1:24:32] have a stubborn frame
[1:24:35] standing there you're hearing preaching
[1:24:37] day of week after week and when it comes
[1:24:40] down to your house when it starts to
[1:24:42] come down into your thought processes
[1:24:43] and you think oh that brother's just
[1:24:45] preaching at me and you Pitchfork it
[1:24:47] over to the next guy or the next gal
[1:24:50] but actually it's for you
[1:24:52] and what God is wanting you to do is to
[1:24:53] take your stylist and dip it into the
[1:24:55] sound wave
[1:24:57] take your stylist and begin to read not
[1:24:59] read up here I'll tell you what I'm
[1:25:01] going to do something sooner you're
[1:25:02] going to be like that's interesting
[1:25:06] it's right now man the Lord is leading
[1:25:08] see this here I'm not going to tell you
[1:25:10] what it is because Isaac will never let
[1:25:12] me hear the end of it but he says I'm a
[1:25:14] man that likes comfort
[1:25:16] well I better tell you because you might
[1:25:17] start thinking it's crazy something but
[1:25:19] it's actually a massage gun
[1:25:21] and it does this right and we're talking
[1:25:24] about pulsation right we're talking
[1:25:25] about vibration
[1:25:27] so I'm just going to put it on medium
[1:25:30] so this thing here right
[1:25:32] now
[1:25:34] this is an expression this thing is
[1:25:36] expressing a vibration now I'm going to
[1:25:39] say that this this is expressing now I
[1:25:42] mean it's very rudimentary and God
[1:25:43] forgive me for comparing his Symphony to
[1:25:46] this but for the purpose of our little
[1:25:48] physics lesson here and spiritual
[1:25:50] physics lesson should I say we're going
[1:25:52] to say that this is God's Symphony right
[1:25:54] now
[1:25:56] lit I was playing around with this for a
[1:25:58] long time I was like oh I put my finger
[1:26:00] on I was like oh wow my finger is
[1:26:02] totally resonant with the vibration of
[1:26:05] this massage gun
[1:26:06] and I started you know I mean I I got a
[1:26:10] sermon from there I started like you
[1:26:12] know because I was like oh well anyway
[1:26:14] so this is how God wants us to be
[1:26:19] right this is his Symphony this is you
[1:26:21] he wants you to be upright
[1:26:24] and
[1:26:25] totally resonant
[1:26:27] totally sympathetic
[1:26:29] totally harmonizing totally in the same
[1:26:32] vibration as your theophany totally is
[1:26:35] your master copy dipped in resting in
[1:26:37] him so that you can vibrate the moment
[1:26:39] you try you'll be a Sarah and your
[1:26:41] producer what and Ishmael
[1:26:43] you don't want to produce an Ishmael by
[1:26:45] you trying your hardest and working for
[1:26:46] God all the time and not walking with
[1:26:48] God
[1:26:49] he wants you to be like this if you're
[1:26:51] like this you're going to vibrate at the
[1:26:52] same frequency as him your instrument's
[1:26:54] going to begin in tune right so you're
[1:26:56] not going to sit in the church and
[1:26:57] you're D tune like that and that's why
[1:26:58] you don't say too much or do too much
[1:27:00] because if you do you're scared that
[1:27:02] people are going to hear how bad you are
[1:27:04] and all this and condemnation that and
[1:27:06] falling away this and everything all
[1:27:08] that's going on inside of mind but why
[1:27:10] not just rest tonight why not let God do
[1:27:13] this but you see the problem is some of
[1:27:15] us are like this and I thought you know
[1:27:17] when you're like this
[1:27:20] see that
[1:27:21] I'm actually causing
[1:27:23] this is like semi now this is many of us
[1:27:26] many of us sit in church and we're like
[1:27:28] this we're kind of halfway there
[1:27:30] see that I'm actually it's fine I am
[1:27:33] vibrating but I'm not fully
[1:27:35] sympathetic that's fully sympathetic
[1:27:37] there's no resistance a lot of us are
[1:27:40] like this and it's because we just can't
[1:27:41] get in the spirit sometimes by the end
[1:27:43] of the service we can finally just get
[1:27:45] freed but we've had a week of all these
[1:27:47] trials and things and we've turned up
[1:27:49] and we're and we're at -5 and we get by
[1:27:51] the end of the service we might be minus
[1:27:53] one or zero but what about turning up to
[1:27:55] service at zero and coming up to plus
[1:27:57] ten in your walk with God and actually
[1:27:59] growing in the grace of God but you see
[1:28:01] now there's people that are sitting in
[1:28:03] the service like this
[1:28:05] and you're sitting there trying your
[1:28:07] hardest to resist the Holy Ghost and you
[1:28:10] see your obstinate you've hardened your
[1:28:11] heart you're not sympathizing with the
[1:28:13] word
[1:28:15] or you're sitting in church and it's all
[1:28:17] intellectual
[1:28:20] there's no it's full resistance see that
[1:28:24] but in your heart
[1:28:25] I'm fully resonating
[1:28:27] actually feels quite good
[1:28:31] does everyone get that
[1:28:33] now if it's the devil Symphony
[1:28:36] see the problem is
[1:28:38] if we're like this with the devil
[1:28:39] Symphony we probably won't be in church
[1:28:40] or we're sitting here because our
[1:28:42] parents have made us sit here and we're
[1:28:44] resonating with the devil notice it's
[1:28:46] gone red
[1:28:47] interesting
[1:28:49] [Laughter]
[1:28:52] and this is some people sitting in the
[1:28:54] church forced to be here
[1:28:56] and then if you were like that to the
[1:28:58] Lord this is you of the devil too
[1:29:00] because you've got a bit of devil stuff
[1:29:02] going on in your life and you've taken
[1:29:04] his Hollywood shows and YouTube and
[1:29:06] you've just let things slip into your
[1:29:08] life but tonight and that's detuned you
[1:29:10] so you're sitting in the Pew and you
[1:29:12] like that guitar but let me just tell
[1:29:13] you God's intention for tonight is that
[1:29:15] you don't stay that way God's intention
[1:29:17] tonight
[1:29:18] I have to look at the time I don't even
[1:29:20] know what the time is okay we're
[1:29:21] stopping
[1:29:22] God's intention tonight
[1:29:25] bigger Miri
[1:29:28] is that you're not like this
[1:29:30] because if you're like this you're
[1:29:31] sitting in two camps and you could be
[1:29:32] filled with the Holy Ghost and still
[1:29:33] you're entertaining the wrong things or
[1:29:36] you're not letting God take you on the
[1:29:38] next part of your journey that next
[1:29:39] Deliverance that next healing that next
[1:29:41] thing in your life that next hittite or
[1:29:43] high bite or jebusite that's in your
[1:29:45] land that needs to go and you're just
[1:29:47] sitting there and you're too scared to
[1:29:48] face that devil but why don't you just
[1:29:50] stand and face that devil tonight why
[1:29:52] don't you just let that let God come and
[1:29:54] bring you so you can do this to the
[1:29:56] devil
[1:29:58] see that now the devil might come into
[1:30:00] your mind
[1:30:01] but remember you can't stop the thoughts
[1:30:03] from coming over but you can stop them
[1:30:04] from Landing
[1:30:14] we've talked about our Master Copy and
[1:30:15] Glory you see this analog recording here
[1:30:18] this is the first way they recorded
[1:30:21] so here's a big trumpet thing this is
[1:30:23] actually the they've remade it obviously
[1:30:25] but this is how they recorded for the
[1:30:27] first proper recording that could
[1:30:29] actually have intelligible sound so this
[1:30:32] was a big cone and it goes all the way
[1:30:34] down to a little tiny stylus diaphragm
[1:30:37] that perfectly picks up well not
[1:30:39] perfectly not as good as today's
[1:30:40] recording but it wasn't that day good
[1:30:42] enough for them to take it right and
[1:30:45] when the sound wave is singing into that
[1:30:47] he's not being sick
[1:30:48] it looks like a sick Bowl it's like
[1:30:53] sorry I've had a lot of those
[1:30:54] experiences in my car
[1:30:59] anyway so he's singing into it and
[1:31:02] playing his guitar I think there's the
[1:31:04] speakers behind him so that's going into
[1:31:06] that trumpet all the way down to a
[1:31:07] little diaphragm there that's vibrating
[1:31:09] the all the sound waves that's going in
[1:31:12] there is going onto that little
[1:31:14] thing and it's vibrating and it's
[1:31:17] actually etching into this wax cylinder
[1:31:20] which is spinning around and creating
[1:31:22] all these micro sound waves all the way
[1:31:24] around this thing and that thing moves
[1:31:25] to the right and Spins at the same time
[1:31:28] and it writes the real true sound wave
[1:31:30] into the wax isn't that interesting yeah
[1:31:35] yeah I'd put that up there because I you
[1:31:37] need to be soft yeah that's right maybe
[1:31:40] you're a little bit hard or maybe you've
[1:31:42] just gone through so much in your life
[1:31:43] and and God wants to just stop you you
[1:31:46] know that song soft in my heart to
[1:31:47] receive oh man it's been a year since
[1:31:50] we've sung it and I don't even know how
[1:31:52] to sing it but it's a song it softened
[1:31:54] my heart to receive let me be filled
[1:31:55] with oil
[1:31:56] you know sometimes we just get so busy
[1:31:58] and we get so calloused and we get so
[1:31:59] our heart is just apprehensive all the
[1:32:02] time and we're always looking forward to
[1:32:03] the next thing and we're not enjoying
[1:32:04] the moment that we're in and right now
[1:32:06] there's a moment for you to actually
[1:32:08] have God soften your heart so that you
[1:32:10] can be a recorder and then the master
[1:32:12] copy library this hair was a library
[1:32:14] where they had all the master copies of
[1:32:16] all the records of
[1:32:18] all these artists when they first
[1:32:20] started it and these were all sitting in
[1:32:22] gold and silver and in bronze and all
[1:32:25] these different
[1:32:26] um medals so that they could be reserved
[1:32:28] and that was the master copy library let
[1:32:30] me tell you God has got a master copy
[1:32:32] library and that's what I read before
[1:32:33] isn't it who remembers that see the
[1:32:36] stylus here that's sympathetic and that
[1:32:38] Stylus is meant to be you see this is an
[1:32:41] electron microscope of a stylus of a LP
[1:32:44] player and that Stylus is reading inside
[1:32:47] that sound wave those are real sound
[1:32:49] waves inside a vinyl disc but that disc
[1:32:52] to get etched had to be soft wax at
[1:32:55] first
[1:32:56] and it got it got itched and soft wax
[1:32:59] and the sound wave came and then that
[1:33:00] stylus came so that you
[1:33:03] could be like that stylus I want you to
[1:33:06] say Lord soften my heart let me we all
[1:33:09] want Revival right we all want to be in
[1:33:11] tune so if you want to be in tune you
[1:33:14] need to just get resting
[1:33:17] just get resting and and and let your
[1:33:19] prayer life become quality
[1:33:22] it doesn't don't get stressed and
[1:33:24] pressured by making it some big long
[1:33:25] thing and you've got to do this make it
[1:33:27] quality
[1:33:28] because that quality is going to tune
[1:33:30] you up
[1:33:31] and I'm not going to read that scripture
[1:33:33] again
[1:33:34] but I ask you that question how's your
[1:33:36] stylus how are you picking up the sound
[1:33:37] waves of your theophany of your true
[1:33:39] life of the Holy Ghost of the Symphony
[1:33:41] of God are you sincerely amplifying
[1:33:43] because I tell you what
[1:33:45] you know job he went through all his
[1:33:47] trials and maybe you're going through
[1:33:48] trials and maybe you're going through a
[1:33:49] whole lot of hardships but you see job
[1:33:51] went for a whole lot of hardships to
[1:33:52] find out a revelation of his origin so
[1:33:55] God says Where Were You job
[1:33:58] and I'm just going to speak on your
[1:34:01] Eternal condition again
[1:34:03] where were you when the sons of God
[1:34:04] shouted together and the morning Stars
[1:34:06] sang together before the world began
[1:34:08] before the world foundation of the world
[1:34:10] in God's mind
[1:34:12] up there in the Eternal Realm
[1:34:14] where you are if you're ever going to be
[1:34:16] there in eternity that you're already
[1:34:18] there right
[1:34:20] how's your amplification right if you
[1:34:22] get dipped into that sound wave it's
[1:34:23] going to restore your dance it's going
[1:34:26] to restore your shout let's go when was
[1:34:28] the last time you shouted in church
[1:34:31] or if you're just sat there and said
[1:34:33] well what's stopping you from shouting
[1:34:35] yeah
[1:34:36] yeah I know probably you'll probably say
[1:34:37] our camp
[1:34:38] probably say Camp I shouted right is
[1:34:41] that right can I be honest I haven't
[1:34:42] heard much shouting going on in here for
[1:34:44] a while you know where's your Shout you
[1:34:46] shouted before the world began yeah
[1:34:48] yeah I've heard you shut
[1:34:51] I have
[1:34:53] amen it just comes out eh you can't help
[1:34:56] it you don't it comes out by the time
[1:34:58] it's out you're like oh I shouted but
[1:35:00] what is that that's an amplification
[1:35:02] right so that stylist gets dipped into
[1:35:04] the sound wave why to amplify
[1:35:07] and if your stylus is resting and you're
[1:35:09] in a good place with God and you're not
[1:35:10] this
[1:35:12] you're going to want to shout because
[1:35:13] you know that you're happy to shout and
[1:35:15] your shout ain't gonna sound like that
[1:35:17] it's going to sound good because it's
[1:35:19] from the Lord it doesn't have to
[1:35:20] physically sound good
[1:35:22] right but spiritually you know someone
[1:35:25] could just go Hallelujah and then the
[1:35:27] Revival break out right the whole Welsh
[1:35:29] Revival started from one girl getting up
[1:35:30] praise God right be glorified of me
[1:35:33] what was that a shout she heard from her
[1:35:35] theophany she heard from her origin
[1:35:38] where was she before the world began the
[1:35:40] sons of God shouted together so if you
[1:35:42] shouted then why not now
[1:35:44] amen so I'll just say how is your
[1:35:46] stylist how's your stylist
[1:35:48] God says this sorry I I mean you know
[1:35:50] we've already gone a bit long but I just
[1:35:52] have to finish this two more scriptures
[1:35:53] a new heart also will I give you
[1:35:56] remember your heart is also vibrating
[1:35:58] right it's resonant it's a frequency so
[1:36:01] a new heart also will I give you
[1:36:04] and a new spirit will I put within you
[1:36:07] and I will I like this amen take away
[1:36:10] the Stony heart out of your flesh and I
[1:36:13] will God see loved his rone he loves you
[1:36:16] because see what he's giving to them he
[1:36:18] give to you first this is for you now so
[1:36:20] don't just make it Israel make it yours
[1:36:22] because it's a spiritual Israel inside
[1:36:24] you it's the Holy Ghost the land is in
[1:36:26] you you are the land and the land and
[1:36:28] the god of the Holy Ghost is a new right
[1:36:30] and so now he's this is his intention so
[1:36:33] if this is not you and I was praying
[1:36:35] with myself I'm like Lord I feel like
[1:36:36] I've got stones in my heart you know I
[1:36:38] feel Stoney sometimes I feel like
[1:36:40] there's just things going on in my life
[1:36:41] and I'm struggling here and and I just
[1:36:44] know that the Lord is dealing in my life
[1:36:46] right and he's working in my life but
[1:36:48] you see God says I will put a a new
[1:36:52] spirit within you and I will give you a
[1:36:54] heart of Flesh and I will put my spirit
[1:36:56] within you amen
[1:36:58] four five I Wills so if God says I will
[1:37:01] five times it's the number of Grace
[1:37:03] right don't you think God wants to do
[1:37:05] this to you yeah don't you think God
[1:37:07] wants to give you a new heart don't you
[1:37:09] think God wants to take out the Stony
[1:37:10] heart and give you a real heart of Flesh
[1:37:11] that can vibrate in the frequency of who
[1:37:14] his Symphony right remember this if he
[1:37:17] gives you that heart when he begins to
[1:37:19] sound you will begin to resonate amen
[1:37:22] because you see that as we went to those
[1:37:24] tuning Forks before that tuning fork and
[1:37:26] that one was the same tone it began to
[1:37:28] resonate but if that Journey fault was
[1:37:30] not a 440 it would have not resonated
[1:37:32] even without touching
[1:37:35] so God yes we don't physically see his
[1:37:37] his copper body
[1:37:40] but yet even though we can be apart like
[1:37:42] that physically speaking we can still
[1:37:45] resonate with him if we're tuned to him
[1:37:47] and I ask God I said Lord what does it
[1:37:49] mean to be tuned and he said you've got
[1:37:51] to be interested
[1:37:53] interested
[1:37:54] you've got to be interested that's why
[1:37:56] the prophet says for those that are
[1:37:58] interested in the change
[1:38:00] they begin to resonate
[1:38:02] and what does that do that's their
[1:38:04] stylist they begin to get in the spirit
[1:38:05] they begin to pray in the spirit they
[1:38:06] begin to sing in the spirit they begin
[1:38:07] to church in the spirit who's ever
[1:38:09] churched in the spirit before Oh my
[1:38:12] God oh my you sit there and you get in
[1:38:13] the spirit because you're churching in
[1:38:15] the spirit Hallelujah that's what makes
[1:38:17] the change you can church out of the
[1:38:18] spirit and you're like that you know
[1:38:19] remember it's kind of half there you're
[1:38:21] kind of agreeing or you're here and it's
[1:38:23] just right
[1:38:25] and because you're so tied up in your
[1:38:27] heart there's so much stuff going on
[1:38:28] your affections are spread thin and
[1:38:30] what's happening oh Lord help me Lord we
[1:38:32] want Revival I wanted in my life but
[1:38:34] Lord what you know you you pray these
[1:38:36] things Jenny sung that as well and I
[1:38:37] thought wow praise the lord we want that
[1:38:40] well the Lord is giving us away
[1:38:42] Hallelujah
[1:38:45] oh my
[1:38:51] I want to just remember this testimony
[1:38:55] back in the prayer meeting years ago
[1:38:58] a couple of years ago a few years ago
[1:39:00] now
[1:39:02] and I just felt share of this is because
[1:39:05] this God's intention is that we are not
[1:39:07] held bondage by any complex or any fear
[1:39:13] or any
[1:39:15] um issue in our relationships right he
[1:39:17] wants us to be able to be a good friend
[1:39:18] he wants us to be able to be a good
[1:39:20] husband a good wife a good brother a
[1:39:22] good sister son and daughter right he
[1:39:23] wants us to be to function
[1:39:26] so we were in remember who remembers
[1:39:28] this prayer meeting we had out in
[1:39:29] Pokemon and
[1:39:32] um Ben was preaching it was only like a
[1:39:35] five minute he used to do like a five
[1:39:37] minute sermonic type of thing before
[1:39:39] prayer meeting and then and this one was
[1:39:42] incredibly anointed and fiery and I was
[1:39:44] sitting in the
[1:39:46] um because Malachi was only like a baby
[1:39:48] then and he was hard to get to sleep and
[1:39:49] I'm trying to get him to sleep I thought
[1:39:51] man I'm going to be stuck in here for at
[1:39:53] least 20 30 minutes but he went straight
[1:39:55] to sleep and this burden came on my
[1:39:57] heart about this that just to sit Go and
[1:39:59] sing the song in the in the um in the
[1:40:02] prayer meeting
[1:40:03] well no I don't even know to sing it but
[1:40:05] to pray it but anyway it turned into a
[1:40:07] singing but
[1:40:08] um so I I was like wow he's gone to
[1:40:11] sleep and something was like there's a
[1:40:12] reason he's gone to sleep so I went back
[1:40:15] into the prayer meeting sat down Ben
[1:40:17] stopped he prayed and then I started
[1:40:19] praying and then I sung the song and
[1:40:21] then all of a sudden the Holy Ghost just
[1:40:22] came down and it was his blood still
[1:40:26] cries freedom
[1:40:27] you say Abel's blood cried Revenge but
[1:40:30] Jesus blood Christ Freedom at Christ's
[1:40:33] deliverance and healing and so I was
[1:40:36] I've had inspired to sing that and I
[1:40:37] sung and all of a sudden they're
[1:40:39] screaming and the Holy Ghost came down
[1:40:41] Romans seen visions of this whole thing
[1:40:43] unfold and
[1:40:45] um the strubix got had amazing Divine
[1:40:48] Healing in their whole home and
[1:40:49] everything and God just rearranged
[1:40:51] things and I wanted to share that to
[1:40:54] tell you that God wants to do that to
[1:40:56] you amen it doesn't have to be a big
[1:40:58] Fantastical thing but God wants you to
[1:41:00] be tuned Hallelujah
[1:41:02] and so
[1:41:05] what it takes
[1:41:08] I'm just going to tune this guitar up I
[1:41:10] don't know if you can read that
[1:41:12] but you see this guitar need to get to
[1:41:15] its potential it needs the Ma I'm not
[1:41:17] saying I'm a master guitarist by any
[1:41:19] stretch of the imagination but I'm going
[1:41:20] to pretend to be one right now so it you
[1:41:23] see
[1:41:24] um
[1:41:25] then this guitarist potential in this
[1:41:27] person is potential but what they need
[1:41:29] is they need somebody that will care
[1:41:31] enough to bring them back
[1:41:37] [Music]
[1:41:39] you see it takes time it doesn't
[1:41:42] [Music]
[1:41:46] I'm not going to get this right
[1:41:49] but I can but I might get it to
[1:41:50] constancy
[1:42:02] see how there's someone working on this
[1:42:04] guitar to bring it
[1:42:06] that's a
[1:42:10] [Music]
[1:42:13] and then after after the Lord has worked
[1:42:16] on it you see it takes the master
[1:42:17] guitarist to or the master violinist you
[1:42:21] see in that violin you know the story
[1:42:23] how there was a violin the prophet
[1:42:25] speaks of this guy that had an auction
[1:42:27] and no one wanted it it just was this
[1:42:29] Dusty old thing in a box but then after
[1:42:32] they tried to auction it no one wanted
[1:42:34] to buy it and then an old man stepped
[1:42:36] out of the out of the audience and he
[1:42:37] picked it up and I I believe that you
[1:42:40] know violence don't stay in tune for
[1:42:41] five minutes so he would have tuned that
[1:42:43] thing and he would have tuned it and
[1:42:45] then he would have begun to play it and
[1:42:47] then
[1:42:48] people couldn't see it says here and
[1:42:51] when they did the auctioneer picked it
[1:42:52] up again and said who will make one said
[1:42:55] a thousand dollars two thousand five
[1:42:58] thousand what was the difference the
[1:43:00] master the one who knew it the one who
[1:43:02] built it
[1:43:03] he knowed how to get out of it what was
[1:43:06] in it
[1:43:07] [Music]
[1:43:18] and it's back in June so that then that
[1:43:22] you your life doesn't have to remain
[1:43:27] Out Of Tune can we have the musicians
[1:43:30] please
[1:43:35] I want to sing that song
[1:43:40] um
[1:43:41] Blessed assurance
[1:43:46] I will not be able to sing it how we
[1:43:48] sang it on Sunday
[1:43:50] that was a very different Rhythm so
[1:43:53] we'll just sing at the normal three four
[1:43:55] whatever six eight tuning or timing
[1:43:57] I'm happy with that it's been
[1:43:59] predictable
[1:44:02] but I tell you what
[1:44:05] if that was you
[1:44:07] I'm just encouraging you now don't leave
[1:44:09] this service
[1:44:11] like that
[1:44:13] let the master guitarist let the master
[1:44:15] violinist how did I go Josh
[1:44:17] did I get it back into sea
[1:44:19] [Music]
[1:44:24] you see after a while the one that can
[1:44:27] tune can hear constant C they can hear
[1:44:30] the pitch because they just know the
[1:44:32] vibration's right
[1:44:34] you know that
[1:44:35] let's just sing the song
[1:44:37] as we prepare to dismiss but let's not
[1:44:41] let this opportunity pass Us by because
[1:44:43] I believe the Lord has inspired this
[1:44:45] particular subject so that you can have
[1:44:49] a key in your life to rest and let God
[1:44:52] let go let go of those things that's
[1:44:55] pulling you down let go of those weights
[1:44:57] that are holding you and weighing you
[1:44:58] down making it hard for you to pray hard
[1:45:00] for you to walk and I'll tell you one
[1:45:02] little testimony of well it's not really
[1:45:03] a testimony it's an experienced thing
[1:45:05] that it will happen to all of us is my
[1:45:08] iPad has my Bible on it it has my notes
[1:45:11] that I write sermons on and everything
[1:45:12] so when I pick up my iPad to notes let's
[1:45:15] say previously I had YouTube open and
[1:45:18] it's got a screen of all these different
[1:45:20] videos of Science and things that I
[1:45:22] watch right
[1:45:24] and I'm now really feeling like I want
[1:45:26] to get into a study or the Lord's In
[1:45:29] Spite and I open my iPad and all I see
[1:45:32] is the YouTube app with all these
[1:45:34] interesting videos and just in the split
[1:45:37] second I see all those videos it takes
[1:45:39] the it breaks that
[1:45:41] um atmosphere because my mind now starts
[1:45:43] thinking about those and that's how
[1:45:46] quick
[1:45:47] we can be pulled away from just that
[1:45:50] quality time and even though I might
[1:45:52] just go no I'm not watching the YouTube
[1:45:53] my mind has already been tainted it I
[1:45:56] don't know if anyone's experienced that
[1:45:57] in there but that this is the thing that
[1:46:00] we are trying to be diligent right and
[1:46:03] if you want quality and you're going to
[1:46:06] go pray let me encourage you you turn
[1:46:08] your machine on or whatever you do to go
[1:46:11] read your Bible or you want to re do
[1:46:13] something on your spiritual or you want
[1:46:14] to read the Bible on your iPad or
[1:46:15] whatever and you see YouTube don't watch
[1:46:18] it
[1:46:19] don't go on that Facebook you see that
[1:46:21] little icon or it's up and you see
[1:46:22] something interesting count it off
[1:46:25] spend that time with God it will pay off
[1:46:29] it might take a while for you to wean
[1:46:31] yourself off that hamster wheel of
[1:46:34] passive entertainment I'll call it a
[1:46:36] handsome because all you do is go round
[1:46:38] and round and round and round and it's
[1:46:40] dopamine into your mind and yes it's
[1:46:42] nice oh yeah yeah yeah yeah but where
[1:46:45] did it get you just to go round and
[1:46:47] round and round and round but if anyone
[1:46:49] in here wants deliverance from that if
[1:46:51] anyone here wants to be changed from
[1:46:52] that when we pray I want you to just
[1:46:55] enter that into the Lord and place that
[1:46:57] at the foot of the cross if anyone in
[1:46:59] here has got a hard heart or they feel
[1:47:01] like they're just not on that's part of
[1:47:03] the spectrum at the moment but they're
[1:47:04] kind of there or maybe you're there and
[1:47:07] you need to stop resisting
[1:47:09] and it's time for you to become to be
[1:47:11] truly sympathetic and empathetic and to
[1:47:15] resonate with the word maybe it's time
[1:47:17] then you lay there lay your life down
[1:47:19] amen hallelujah let's just sing the song
[1:47:22] but before we sing just play it nice and
[1:47:24] soft
[1:47:25] um Blessed Assurance let's just pray on
[1:47:27] just close your eyes and
[1:47:29] um we're just going to pray and commit
[1:47:31] these things to the Lord
[1:47:33] Lord Jesus father
[1:47:36] is so grateful to you Lord
[1:47:38] lord it's been a long time coming Lord
[1:47:42] this thought and this sermon that you've
[1:47:44] given us Lord
[1:47:46] but father I believe that you inspired
[1:47:48] this tonight to reveal that your heart
[1:47:51] is towards us and that you're for us and
[1:47:53] that you don't want us to be detuned you
[1:47:55] don't want us to be stubborn you don't
[1:47:57] want us to be distracted Lord you want
[1:48:00] us to be interested
[1:48:01] you want us to have a desire for your
[1:48:03] Lord that's pure and and and full and
[1:48:06] Rich not just waning or hanging on for
[1:48:10] dear life Lord
[1:48:11] and maybe someone in his hanging on for
[1:48:13] dear life
[1:48:14] there's one little thread left that's
[1:48:16] holding them in church
[1:48:18] but tonight Lord Jesus I pray that you
[1:48:21] would reach down your hand
[1:48:22] and that you would grab that son but
[1:48:25] you'd grab that daughter and the strong
[1:48:28] hand that just like when Billy Paul was
[1:48:31] falling and the strong hand came down
[1:48:33] lord
[1:48:34] and grabbed him and and rescued him and
[1:48:36] arrested a fool maybe a fool needs to be
[1:48:39] arrested tonight Lord I pray that you
[1:48:42] would arrest the fall of our prodigals
[1:48:45] of our children that are out there Lord
[1:48:47] but don't know
[1:48:49] what they're doing
[1:48:50] and they're stuck
[1:48:52] May their life Lord not work at all
[1:48:55] but may Lord you turn them towards you
[1:48:57] and may they come to themselves in the
[1:48:58] pig pen
[1:49:00] of the world but Lord Jesus even in here

[1:49:24] was no resistance Lord

[1:49:28] our life while resisting the word or
[1:49:30] resisting Lord Jesus father the the the
[1:49:33] the word that's come to us or maybe it's
[1:49:36] conviction Lord but I pray Lord for a
[1:49:38] good old-fashioned Holy Ghost conviction
[1:49:39] in our lives Lord that you would bring
