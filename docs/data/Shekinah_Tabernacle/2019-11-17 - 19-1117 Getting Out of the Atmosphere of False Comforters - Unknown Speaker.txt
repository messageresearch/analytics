it and just for two weeks I have had it on my heart quite a lot in then came again and on the Friday prior prayer meeting this Friday we had it I think was India 10 o'clock right so for me it was like now definitely gotta sing this song like when the Lord walked us is he said there was nowhere he could place his heat to rest but then the body was prepared over those seven Church ages then he chip came down in 63 it's a perfect body we don't walk blind the eyes are in the is the eyes are in the head we don't have to walk blind everything's happening all in the head to function the rest of the body and then just reading some of these things the prophet talks about him Christ as the mystery of God revealed and he sees that the headship is like a kingdom and he's talking about how the kingdom of heaven is within us so I hear all these things kind of even a little bit of this morning mentioned as well he's our head ship he's our defense he's the one that that laid the cloud was leading the children of Israel by day and in the pillow of night fire by night he's still the same God today so crazy [Music] [Music] glory of the Lord is my defense he's my Savior I'm not just about Constance's

brother oh and we have some visitors it's typical of me to forget things the church you know but I just want to say welcome our guest from Oakland [Music] I trust you having a good time and you know honesty every art from this song beginning of the song your testimony's is kind of like you know hooking up to what so I want to thank what the been for the opportunity to share my testimony of shoot of the convention of the of the camp-meeting instead appreciable that Kadri so thank you for being for your stand for righteousness for being channel of contrition for inspiration and there's just christian standing by your side so god bless you for your love level of love and walk of faith you will not lose your word also what it takes for you to appreciate the church is I think them said it or somebody has said it's not the size of the fight is it's not the size of the dog in the fight and it is the size of the fight in the dog and what is little flood did on in that during the camp meeting with shoot yourself so now the fight is not you and I is him and what did this show that somebody surrendered in all your departments in your little area you you surrender there was no complaint did everything and God came down and blessed it so thank you for your staff thank for the ministry I appreciate with all my heart the ministry here amen for Andy a man of many gifts sister Browning wrote to God no Isaac and please let me not everyone and all the all the technicians and you've worked so hard welcome Sobotka been no the Deacon is the police of the church and what i standed true and its wife and all the wives for your for standing for the lord bless you so know what to go straight to my testimony this was when Bakari was picking us you know this to talk you know struck me and I could hold it hold it and and he said about the power of decision now before I go on everyone here thank you my little sister I had a mic to say this and she came everyone here has right to be happy now if I look at your door by 6 a.m. I didn't tell I was coming and then I I had a bag full of a million dollars and sister Brad this is yours what do you do oh that's fine now I show you I have more of some before it's more than that for it here so go has more than a million tears for you so don't sit back and listen to the devil because we're cutting hit hit they're about condemnation and that's actually what our to hit here the devil is it is in a liar when you open his mouth he lies that's what we can do and I would believe in more God who do we believe who do we believe I mean so is it behooves us to enhance our may our day and our message what God is doing your day if you cut that that inspiration as individual the devil will be controllable under your feet because the convention is not just meant for us to be happy and go but know is like given a short higher so now we are going higher and higher and then we are not letting down the bath we are not letting the tempo go back amen our worship should be going higher and higher and higher and higher what are you like it or not just worship okay now our method of the twelve that's why I'm gonna take my switch off from at that time Jesus went on the Sabbath day true they come and the disciples were and hungered and began to plug the ears of corn and to eat on his Sabbath day remember so they failed they committed a burnable seen as the Jews as far as they're concerned but when we first saw it they said unto Him behold that the suppose do that which is not lawful to do upon the Sabbath day but then he who christ's deity i'm society said said it is the pillar of fire a dc-3 came down amen so it's not a man he did make it up it's not Bible School listener is him came down with a message for you and for me to set us free that our journal on this earth will be the happiest individuals couples be on this earth you will not do an offense to set on you a liar you cannot make me sad you cannot make me depressed I choose not to be power of choice hallelujah alright okay so it says have you not read what David did when he wasn't hungered I'm datato with him and how enter the house of God and it is shewbread which was not lawful for him to eat neither for them which were with him but oh but oh but only for the priests that would have done go down because of time but this is the place I want to take notice and resolve but if you have known if you had known what this minute I will have mercy I am not sacrifice you would not have condemned the guiltless here what date is standing in my flesh by his seats you have the devil on the other hand drill all his best pump damn them you are guilty you went you know Sawadee and this and that but here what date is Sunday saying if you have known so after speaking to the devil today devil if you know what is in all this brothers and sisters drunken old sitting here this morning you will not have condemned the goodness so he dropped all the charges Satan you have no right to hug any of my neck praise the Lord okay let's go God bifur knowledge sin exactly who will be saved and who will be saved remembering from adoption 1960 he sent Jesus to save those that he has already chosen he chose us in him now one arm witness put your name there let somebody else take it it's yours he chose us in him before there was even a world a world that is our inheritance tell me how much how many millions of dollars were on this your name in the book we told you before what began is your inheritance interruptible under fire does not fade away reserved in heaven for you why should I be joyful what's not be happy hallelujah watch that him to church and sit and sit as if I sewed it on credit you do what that means he's selling credit and they take what we don't pay you back you know amen it's all paid for hallelujah hallelujah so that's how inheritance God chose us let Jesus come and pay the price that's what he's shedding of his blood that no sane did somebody say this morning no C would be accounted to us why do you condemn the gateless Satan hallelujah Oh hallelujah look there was oh I don't know I've made this commitment I mean I make my testimony will I fail tomorrow no forget about it murim said here and watch this master teacher Paul the first thing he does is to not cut all the idea of falling away no but all the idea of ever being a Christian today being the camp meeting last week or whatever previous weeks and then tomorrow I'm gone and the next day God forgive me and the next day I'm back again barometer does nonsense call it what it is how oh my hallelujah now you might do things wrong now so bright but I now say oh let me just go I'm paid district read and do anything that one because God chose me and put mine in a smurf of life do I say that no so out of balance it up and that's what this is what Graham sake but don't take the negative now instead now you might do things wrong and but every time you do anything wrong you you are going to get paid for it yes sir you reap what you sow but that has not one thing to do with your salvation when you are born of the Spirit of God you've got eternal life and know and can no more die than pork and I you a part of God you a son of God hallelujah and they got tactus with yourself with Abraham Isaac Jacob and Joseph and he said no more that Joseph could help being what he was and we cannot have be what you are but God made meet me to you but bro and he said God get a feeling for me he dropped down in his passage into this old pest house ma to achieve his purpose on this earth ready for whom going he says look at those four patriarchs Abraham column Isaac Abraham election as it calling Jacob dress just a perfection nothing against him amen so we take it Abraham justification Isaac scientific ation Jacob grace but the Holy Ghost Pentecostals and now we are moved on to yourself the what seat nothing against Joseph not again is sitting you and I choose to take this power of choice to say no to devil of condemnation because this seed is or I receive the seed the fluence of the world or I look at a gift given to me in this age it's already me and that seed is working as we are what is sane it says here not it against yourself so I just a perfection road against him there was God walking working his way out so

bring job place now I'm going to close on this it was the scriptures he said for whom he did foreknow he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son that he might be the firstborn among many brethren moreover whom in deep it is net then he also called a man are you call a woman called then it also justified why do you condemn the goodness or Satan to God i justified and whom he justified he also glorified aim and what shall we say to these things if God be for us who can be against us from now to eternity god bless you amen amen hallelujah do love the Lord amen if it's for you who can be against you hallelujah Amen let's turn to a feelin sing this beautiful beautiful song Amen hide me now under your wings when the oceans rise just a few times before brother Ben comes up

you here I mean let's see how we got this PowerPoint be anyway let's go to Ephesians 6 and verse 10 just gonna read a couple of scriptures here says and then we're gonna go to John 11 it is finally my brethren be strong in the Lord and the power of his might put on the whole armour of God it is it is in the sari it as it is on the PowerPoint if you want to go there because I've got the Spanish there too ok anyway put on the whole armour of God that you may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil for we wrestle not against flesh and blood but against principalities against powers against the rulers of the darkness of this world against spiritual wickedness in high places wherefore take unto you the whole armour of God that you may be able to withstand in the evil day and having done all to stand stand therefore having your loins good about with truth having on the breastplate of righteousness and your feet shod with the preparation of the gospel of peace above all taking the shield of faith wherewith you shall be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked and take the helmet of salvation and the sword of the Spirit which is the word of God praying always with all prayer and supplication in the spirit and watching thereunto with all perseverance and supplication for All Saints Amen alicia's go to John chapter eleven I just want to take a take a con just a thought here from God's a very familiar piece of Scripture of speaking of Lazarus and and you're the resurrection of Lazarus but I just want to take a thought here that I trust will will will bless you first so so John Levin we're going to read from verse 17 and and we do have us on the PowerPoint it says then when Jesus came he found that he had lain in the grave for days already now Bethany was nigh unto Jerusalem about 15 furlong loins off and many of the Jews came to Martha and Mary to comfort them concerning their brother then Martha as soon as she heard that Jesus was coming went and met him but Mary sat still in the house then said Martha unto Jesus Lord if thou has had us been here my brother had not died but I know that even now whatsoever thou ask of God God will give it thee jesus saith unto her thy brother shall rise again Martha saith unto him I know that he shall rise again in the resurrection at the last day jesus said unto her I am the resurrection and the life he that believeth on me though he were dead yet shall he live and whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die believeth Aldous she sat unto Him yay Lord I believe thou art the Christ the Son of God that should come into the world and when she so said she went her way and called marry her sister secretly saying the master has come and calleth for thee as soon as she heard that she rose quickly and came unto Him now Jesus was not yet coming to the town but was in that place where Martha met him the Jews then that were with her in the in the house and comforted her when they saw Mary that she rose up hastily went out followed her saying she Garth under the grave to weep there then when Mary was come where Jesus was and saw him she fell down at his feet saying unto Him Lord if thou had us been here my brother had not died when Jesus therefore saw her weeping and the Jews also weeping which came with her he groaned in the spirit and was troubled and said where have you laid him they said unto Him Lord come and see Jesus wept then said the Jews behold how he loved him and some of them said could not this man which open the eyes of the blind have caused that even man should not have died I'm in this bow hidsim for prayer gracious Lord Jesus Lord we want to thank you for all the songs sung the testimonies given there God I believe there's an atmosphere of faith in this place dear lord I just ask father is now we have come to open the pages of your word Lord we know that anyone can that can read can can open the pages of your Bible and read it but Lord takes you the author to come and make it live so I pray dear God that you'll anoint your word one more time anoint it the speaker and hearer Lord you have a mind for the service dear God and I pray Lord that it would be expressed dear Lord may you just have preeminence in every life dear God I just ask you be with each one and Lord just want to commit our lives into your hands Lord as your prophet said the greatest gift anyone can have is to get themselves out of the way so may we all get ourselves out of the way that you can come and you can come and worship you can come down and manifest yourself as you see fit Lord may you grant it dear God and Jesus Christ name meet every need for your glory Lord amen amen god bless your friends you may have your seats this morning and I want to I want to take a thought here from John 11 while just just backing up you know we read there at Ephesians that we we do not fight flesh and blood you know there's a spiritual battle and we must understand that there are only two powers in the earth I know you know Eve ones is very familiar with this thought but when it becomes more than a theory but into a reality that's where you know you could say things become real it's not a concept but actually become something that happens so we understand that there's only two powers in the world there's not many you know there's two there's God or Satan there's this faith or there's unbelief and those two powers want to have preeminence over you I mean so and it depends which one I believe brother Dean you're saying you know you're you have power decision you can choose so so when you choose to take Dominion that's the one that will take dominion over you because something must have dominion over you because it's how we're built something must lead us so so if there's only two powers in the earth and I just want you to you know it's amazing you know I was so moved just singing of here here's Mary and Martha and there and they've just lost their brother you know they've you know they've watched them die you know they've sent for Jesus to come that that he will you know even just speak the word or you know and and and he'll get well they've seen him slowly deteriorate and then finally he dies so the life that was once in their home that you know no doubt made their lives special made you know did you know added that little something in there and their home had gone and now the Jews these Jews came to come and comfort them now you've got to be very careful what you open yourself to and your time of crisis you've got to be very careful what your comforter is because I just want to come out and say it these Jews really were not anointed by faith they were not anointed by the word of their day they just had a carnal understanding and they were actually anointed by the devil to create an atmosphere of unbelief I mean in Mary Martha's life that they will stay in a spot of depression they'll stay in a spot of loss they will not ever you know you know people say to you many times and I just want to take this parallel in the Christian walk they say when you come to terms with your loss then you can move on but there's some some things that we lose it's actually the devil stolen it from us but we have a right to get it back and then we have a right by the Word of God that if our Joy's been taken if our peace has been taken if some indifferent spirit comes upon us and we feel numb and separated we do not have to stay in that condition amen I do not believe that we have a first love then we lose our first love and we just go through the motions that is not the brides portion this message is a romance it's a love affair I mean the message is a love letter to you the Bible is a love letter to you I mean and love just gets greater gets more gets richer and that's how our walk should be but the devil don't want you to have that kind of walk oh no he wants you to live with a sad memory and that's all they had was a sad memory of what Lazarus used to be right so so here they were comforting comforting myriad my but they were just anointed by a demon power to keep an atmosphere of unbelief and sadness upon them because think about it here they're you know sure they had good intentions many people have good intentions we're going to be very careful as I said what you open yourself to within your time of need I mean saying but just think about it this said they're crying and and their pain was real their sadness was real their brother really died it was a very traumatic event I mean to see their brother whatever sickness it was take his life and finally he breathed his last breath and he's gone and humanly he can never come back and so here they were these Jews came and tried to comfort them regarding this but just but just think about it the resurrection and the life was walking towards their house and this time of despair and this time of sadness in this time of loss the resurrection and the life was now making step by step towards their house and he wasn't coming there just to comfort them like the Jews were know he was going to break the cycle of death he was going to show them Nazareth doesn't have to stay dead hallelujah so I want you to keep that in mind hallelujah remember Lazarus had been dead for four days by the stage when Jesus turned up these Jews would be comforting Mary and Martha all this time now I don't know how long they would have remained there but the devil has a way that when he takes something from us he will try and ensure that he will keep us in that state of loss I mean that's his job member brother Bram he says your demon pals would fight him in the pulpit will come against him he would he would speak about how maybe if I just find it here you know he says he sees about he says now the devil he sees this isn't show us our Father and it will suffice with us then Martha as soon as she says oh see when we're just getting warmed into the meeting now see see that Satan is trying to ward off that old devil you believe right now this is the hour this is a time that in your own church you can start a revival and do the works of God so he tells us that the devil tries to ward off the blessings of God a man just because he tries to ward them off it doesn't mean you're not a believer you got to get that out of your mind straightaway the reason he tries to ward it off is because you are a believer he knows if you can take God at His Word he is defeated he is powerless he will be beaten every place every time everywhere just as Jesus defeated him in the desert with the Word of God he knows the people of God if they recognize who they are they'll take that same word and defeat him anytime anyplace anywhere doesn't matter how they feel doesn't matter if they've had a good day or a bad day he knows if they take if they recognize if you recognize who you are and the Lord Jesus Christ and what he's made you to be and you take God in His Word he'll be defeated he says here and for him will I accept in 52 he says oh my now I just see them people out there just seems like it becomes a mess to me and how that I think that Satan just he says if I could just break that spirit above you right now that's all Satan waving his black wings around there trying his best to keep you from keep you from believing if there's some way that that could move away then there would be nothing between you and the glory land of God that would fall upon you and heal every person here believe with all your heart even right now there's you're the devil's here to fight us brother I'm said he hates me I hate him so the devil hates you you have a real enemy you know we have to recognize the devil as real right he's not just a thought he's not just a funny feeling he's a being and he's come to try and rob the people of God from everything that God has given them or wants to give them so here here's leiserson I mean I mean so here's Mary Martha and hear her comforters these Jews and you know I don't know how long they would have remained there in that state comforting them keeping that atmosphere of sadness and loss but it's the same way you know the devil robs us but then he tries to keep us in a state you know we suffer loss in our Christian walk here the storms of life come we get poisoned by gossip or a critical spirit misunderstandings happen sickness strikes the joy once had is gone the victory we once had where we didn't care who was around us for us like when we stepped into church we begin to sing the songs of God or open the Bible or just talk to it feels like we literally heaven just comes down it's like you're in a bubble of the Holy Ghost you having a glorious time you don't care who saw you do whatever you're doing I believe we should have freedom to express ourselves as we should I mean if we're of a little bit quiet that's fine if we're very exuberant that's fine I mean brother Bram said and deep calls to the deep there's a man standing before him and he says I can see you're just you're just excited that's just his presence here that man was standing before the angel Lord and he steamed you did still so it's not necessarily the outward it's what's going on in the heart but I'll say this and there's something in the heart it'll come out hallelujah right amen so now you know you know so there's that time where literally it feels like heaven just dips in I believe in a heartfelt religion hallelujah amen but something happens and we seem to be no longer that way some people say that's maturity I ask really hallelujah I don't think that's maturity it can just be an indifferent feeling and numbness towards the things of God we once the fire burn brightly a real passion for him has died now brother Moses and lady I see in Church ages his own I never want any bitterness or indifference though we may firmly disagree if we are sitting at a table and one eating one kind of pie and one another that'll be just as much as right here when it comes to fellowship one with another we love one another and if we don't do that then we should do that see see and he says we'll never go no farther and God until we do that what love one another so he says I don't want any indifference to come around me what's going to happen though it's going to try we are going to be tempt we are going to be tested by every spirit you can imagine every spirit just because the devil you know just because you defeat him in one case he doesn't just quit he's gonna see in something else Allu you remember the Lord Jesus has already overcome all things right so he already overcame that devil and if he's in you you'll overcome that amen so you know hallelujah no indifference just a definition so it means you know that it doesn't matter one way or another it's of no importance or value one way or another it's marked by no special liking or dislike of something it's marked by a lack of interest enthusiasm concerning something once on fire for God now just become indifferent well I've heard it all before it should it should still be alive I mean it should still be a living yo God doesn't just become dead the word still alive hallelujah well I've heard that before you'll hear it again hallelujah you know so that kind of thing comes in but let's go back to Mary Martha's house let's go into the mind of the let's go into the mind of the comforters I'm sorry I'm so sorry for your loss I'm so sorry your brother died I'm so sorry that life will never be the same because he's gone always tries to do the negative I'm sorry that your joy seems to have gone I guess it just wasn't for you you know the devil comes you want something there's always a voice saying it's not for you that's the devil that's actually God's that's actually the devil confirming to you it's for you you've got to take the opposite should I repeat that again I meant the devil says it's not for you he says the Holy Ghost isn't for you you'll never overcome this thing you'll never be this way and that's actually the devil confirming - it's for you you got to take the opposite what he's telling you you've got to take the opposite lelou you amen I'm sorry that you know your meekness your long-suffering nature has died your love for others that you once loved everybody no matter how they treated you it's gone you know I guess maybe you know you know Mary Martha it's a different stage of life now you know if one has to die and Lazarus there was this time you know you just got to accept the fact that the life you once had in your home it can't come back you can't have that same kind of walk no more you can't have that overcoming life no more you can't have that joy and speak will full of glory no more it's because you've grown up really this is comforting this is the devil comforting you know that person did that to you well I guess you can never look at them the same way you can never treat them with love again because they did that to you really love covers a multitude of sins Amen if he if Christ loves the unlovable I mean we should be able to love everybody we should be able to treat them with love and respect irrespective of how they treat you that's not the thing it's how you treat them I mean they may pour sulfuric acid down your neck you'll just say well they've never seen love like this how Louie how you treat them back Amen well I guess you know I guess you've just got to come to us with Mary Martha he's really did that trauma really happened to you you know I guess it's just a different stage of life you know I mean maybe your joy has now just become a deep joy and so deep it never comes out maybe the peace you have is so deep you know maybe or maybe not maybe it's just in a different spirit trying to rob you of the joy and the victory that is yours maybe well no it's not indifference maybe you're just stable in your walk maybe no maybe it's just indifference maybe that cold spirit comes along you know where we're with the Lord as this life you want to see why has the devil turned you know you take the Anglican Church you're all the churches of the West and even these why they so quiet now we're gonna do this now we still I was I was at boarding school with Anglican Chapel three times a week you stand up you say this sit down say this say this cygnus arm sit down you know it's just all just a form there's no life there's no joy there's not half our religion there's no expression why did it become that way because that's what the devil wants us to be called formal Luke woman Paulus we don't want to be and this and see of people in there they just it's the system that destroys people see it's not the people as a system I mean but you know we don't want to ever systemize the message and to just a form of religion this should be a heartfelt religion Joanne speak will full of glory that were actually happy we're saved we're happy we're free we're happy we're overcoming we're happy we have life that's how we should feel I mean our salvation is not based on how we feel we know I mean I'm not saved because I feel I'm saying I'm saved because I believe it's word I'm saved I have met his requirements of his word right so first and foremost my salvation is not based on how I feel I mean but because it's a heartfelt religion love as a feeling I mean so if you love the Lord you will feel that love hallelujah I tried I trust that came out the right balance you know I'm not gonna take a rapture because I feel it I believe it he's revealed it to me it's become a revelation hallelujah amen so Lazarus you know you know maybe that's begin to talk about how Lazarus was such a good man you know maybe they would relate stories those Jews that knew knew Lazarus fairly well maybe they tell you know how he did this for me anyways was so kind and thoughtful and you know but they no doubt you know as they begin to reminisce over Lazarus's life they naturally begin to speak out then when Jesus came into their life and how the friendship formed and I imagine even in their anguish Mary and Martha would relate when they begin to realize Jesus was more than a man where he is more than a holy man even more than a prophet but he is God himself hallelujah but no doubt the Jews would pop out at this moment because just as faith is trying to rise what happens the devil comes along he tries to just pour put a wet blanket over the whole thing but no doubt it about this time the Jews would pipe up and say but didn't you send word to him that Lazarus was sick didn't he heal other people didn't you see him do the miraculous you just his to fight he did but why did he come and help your brother he said he loved him why didn't he come that's the devil being a comforter he always puts a quick should mark against the Word of God yet trying to console you trying to comfort you but he's just trying to keep you stuck down in your rut and he puts you there in the first place but he comes alongside you remember we shouldn't be ignorant to the devil's devices right there's a real devil there's a real mind battle I mean so you know but didn't didn't he heal other people why could he do this and then but then they no doubt would have gone in and I said but surely if only you had taken him to the hospital so he tries to poor and regret he tries to get you to sick and guess what you've done you know surely if you did something different Lazarus maybe wouldn't have died that's the devil comforting see you following me surely if you only said that to that person that wouldn't have happened that way surely if you went here and did this it wouldn't happen that way but you've got to understand your foot steps are ordered of God you've got to have peace that the Lord has ordained your steps the good end what we call the bad steps hallelujah you know surely you know and and and what is he trying to do he's trying to put blame on you it's actually basically they're saying this is just me the comforters are saying to Mary Martha it's actually your fault he's dead because you should have got some other treatments in waiting for Jesus to come well is that he try to pour on regret you see the devil he will always get us to focus on the negative keep trying you to look at the circumstances trying to keep you in a pity party and not look at the word yes yes you were there yes you were that way but then such-and-such happens you know sure I was full of joy once I didn't care what everyone thought I was just in love with the Lord but then things happen in life sure you know but then such-and-such happened some you know you just can't change you know you just can't change it I mean you can't change that Lazarus instead the life has gone out you can never get them back you can never get that kind of joy back kind of love back sure you may be happy in the Lord again but how will they ever be the same Mary Martha you'll come to terms with the fact Lazarus died it'll be a happy memory you'll still you know and you know there's the resurrection at the end you'll see him one day you'll have that joy one day I'm gonna come to that later you know but but so so so yeah butBut Mary Martha you know you'll pick your life back together your walk will still kind of come to some kind of resemblance but I'm sorry because he died you can never go back to what you had before he died oh isn't that comforting no that's a lie from the pit of hell hallelujah the Lord said I shall restore I mean so what you had you shall be restored - hallelujah why you see I just put this on my nose here why are you preaching this way because the devil wants toward us from every divine promise of God to make us indifferent cold formal of powerless and many times it's actually an evil spirit affecting us and we just get used to it as opposed to resisting the devil and getting rid of the thing we actually we actually begin to agree with the comforter and God doesn't want it that's not comfort that's just actually him trying to pour unbelief upon you because remember the resurrection the life is walking towards you just like he's walking to their house hallelujah now Jesus he referred to Moses as he lifted up the serpent in the wilderness even so the Son of Man will be lifted up that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have eternal life we know we had that tongues interpretation about four prep meetings ago he said yo yo as the serpent was lifted up by Moses so if I be lifted up he says I'm the antidote for every snake bite the Lord the word is the antidote for every snake bite of of the devil not just for our young people but for all of us right and and then and ever so we must remember that we have the antidote for every bite of the devil everyone we have Moses's medical cabinet on the lower hills all my diseases I mean we have it now this word that's innocence living we have it this message we don't need to go find it somewhere God said here you go I will give you the first aid kit you need for every day of your life's journey hallelujah so you know because you know I've never been bitten by a snake before but I'm sure you know but I'm sure if you have or someone has they will remember especially a poisonous one they will remember the time when it bit you right now some snakes can actually bite you don't feel the fangs but then the effect of the poison starts to grip the body right so I remember see so you may not feel the Fang bites necessarily but you may feel the effects of the venom and if you can get anti-venom as quick as you can right then then you can actually counteract the effects of the venom but the longer you leave it the worse you can become it means so so many times what happens the devil comes along remember the Lord is going to prove his salvation so the Lord will actually allow the devil to bite you he will actually allow an evil spirit to come amen just like what it what did God what did what did God say to Satan about joke you can do this but you can't take his life and the devil pushed to the very edge of that boundary and and job didn't know what was going on life just went upside down real quick but you know he was trusting in the lamb right he didn't understand the whole picture but he was trusting in the lamp so the devil was allowed to be turned loose upon job because God was willing to show job the power of his salvation Amen it's the same thing God will actually allow the devil to be turned loose upon you I mean that you will actually see through the trial the power of God salvation his keeping power his overcoming power because he wants to manifest it in you see it's easy to say we are overcomers but then you've got to overcome something and then it's very different right but in order to be an overcomer there's something you must overcome we know there's the devil that's got to be overcome our own flesh has to be overcome right but we will overcomers on that side amen hallelujah so so the problem is now if you don't know you've been bitten by a venomous snake then the poison can work longer in your body and you'll get sicker and sicker and sicker and sometimes the devil will bite us but and then we'll be under the effect of a spirit of gossip or critical spirit or something will happen and we won't actually understand why we're this way right someone gets bitten by a snake maybe their organs swell I was saying they begin to feel the physical effects of that bite but spiritually the same thing can happen are you all following me right but we've got to recognize because you got to think now there was a time when I had joy unspeakable everything was wonderful everything was great doesn't matter what was going on around me I was on the Hallelujah side right but then if the devil bites you you will fall from that position to another position where you won't be you you'll be under the effects of the venom as opposed to the effect of your experience of your walk with God but then what's but then you've got to say I so so you've been bitten you're sick you got to remember I was once not this way what caused me to go from this way to what I was hallelujah and so now if you have a memory this is what I once was like because what God did view is real there's a real work in your life yes say well I shouldn't be sick I should be rejoicing I should have peace I should have love I should be just shouting and heavy a glorious time however the Lord moves on my heart to express his praise it should be happening so if I'm sick if I'm not that way if I'm cold and different and separate from God because maybe pain hurt or put up walls you gotta say no this is not my portion this is the devil trying to rob me of my victory hallelujah amen and so you've got to recognize this is not me maturing this is actually the devil trying to destroy me hallelujah amen see I've seen big giant trees full of green leaves blowing in the wind howl ooh yeah they're still moving as a spirit they're rejoicing just like we're now little hallelujah but they're still rejoicing so little and they and they can actually draw a lot more water out of the ground because their root systems far bigger than a sampling they can draw a lot more of the word up holy and create an atmosphere around them hallelujah amen they're still doing the same thing as a young as a young tree hallelujah but now they're just just just draw more out they got more leaves out hallelujah what still the same tree but then I've seen trees that are dead we've seen a big giant tree there's no life and there's you you know get it actually you know feel the breeze go thought there's no it's not rejoicing it's not shouting oh it's mature no actually it's dead there's no life to prove what's in it is not being manifested so you know you've got to think now what bit me and ultimately it's not the person it's the devil hallelujah but we have the antidote for every bite hallelujah now he was now so so you know so far worse than a natural snakebite is a you know as the devil sometimes we don't realize we mean bitten when someone has spoken to us and the next thing you know we're all troubled in our spirits I mean because you heard something about brother so-and-so and sisters so-and-so now that's just gripped you and now you're all heavy and down what's happened bite right because you know sometimes when you say all the devil's come against you think there's some big creature just appears out of nowhere and you know no spirits travel onwards Spurs travel onwards and that's why there's some people you can I'm talking about believers too you know you can spend time with some people you feel so refreshed you feel so happy why you've come under the greeny leaves yeah leaves are the fellowship having a wonderful time and then there's some believers sure they may look the part but you just don't really want to be around them there's a different spirit see that's not the person it's a spirit I mean because that's why you know brother Bray I'm told the story of the two going through a divorce and they're and they're and they're going through the house and this is minor this is mine but then finally they came up to the attic where they picked up a little baby bootie and the memory of life coming for brought them back together hallelujah and that's why you've got always go back to you know think about when life came when that brother or sister was with you and in a meeting in a convention it was and God came down and life was birthed hallelujah those memories those experiences keep us together amen isn't that right hallelujah it's not about this in that kitchen now this is my no no no it's when life comes that's the important thing how can i overcome he says I was crossing he says I was crossing an old log the other day or why should we call it a hallow and I jumped up on this log we have yeah good luck trying to find it and I jumped up on the slog on the outside sobrevivir and it looked good looked like a big old beach log then I just jumped on it a great big chunk fell off was real rotten and dirty I see that's the way the Christians are becoming they did incident trespass as long as that become dirty they can hold no weight at all see they don't know what the overcoming means and I think and I begin to think in the stick see and overcome keep life in you when life went out that's was when the log brought the log to that condition see and it was made worse than ever when it laid in that branch where the water was and then there you take a Christian that supposed to be a Christian that the life of God go from him and the experience the joy of serving Christ and living in a church where such as going on he wrought ins twice as quick right living right under it so if you're trying to follow the message of the hour at least this part of the message we should live constantly in the life of Christ see cause if you don't you lay around and know these things that you're supposed to do and don't do it the Bible said he that knoweth to do good and doeth it not to him it's end then you become dirty rotten when you're separate from the love of God so strive with all that's in you just stay in the life of Christ that we would be fruit-bearing hallelujah brother bang speaks and believe us now this keep life about your church don't leave bidness comin don't need any difference to only some critical spirit don't they don't forgiveness take root keep life about you because remember the Lord he doesn't you know we are meat to be like he when he has baptized you as the Lamb of God and then spread of God descend upon like a dove hallelujah and brother Brown teaches very simply that dove would never land head to land upon the same kind of animal that had the same kind of nature he would never land upon a wolf and it's the same thing with us you know we can get a critical nature we can become a wolf again and the and the devil take its flight and we'll wait and the rafters until you're ready you repent then he'll come back again that's why we're going to keep were to keep life about us he says he doesn't believe ourselves leave us thou lovest and food I mean in nineteen fifty says then I look at them and immediately after that they needed food to live on God rained God rained down out of heaven man or a type of the Holy Ghost every morning they went out picked it up it was good they eat it it tastes like honey they would just lick their lips and eat it I tell you this Holy Ghost it rains now which was that type and this is the anti-type it taste like honey that's right I've seen the saints of God so drunk till they lick their lips moon so good there's something about hunting hallelujah I mean David the older of the psalmist in the Bible he talked about the honey and here's a shepherd the Shepherd used to carry a little old script bag and in there they had honey in it and when their sheep would get sick that put that honey all on a rock a limestone rock and those six sheep we're going to licking that rock and when they did licking off the honey the area's hallelujah glory just look on it that's all right he says listen brother I tell you I'll put it on Christ not some church either I'll go to Christ where it belongs on lick on him hallelujah you need healing if there's any virtue if there's any path if there's any praise it belongs to her may men that's right on Christ the solid rock to rock the rock played a big part in it too a long time ago when they when they used to have the rock used to be people that got bit by a mad dog they'll take a stick and they take and stick them to a mad stone if they got stuck they got well if they didn't stick they died the worst mad dog I know is the devil that's right and the only cure I know is the rock of ages' stick to it hold on and God will take care of it little boy here in a wheelchair you blind sir you laying on a cart holding to hold to God's unchanging hands the devil might have a bit you but there's enough drawing power of the Rock of Ages cleft for me let me hide myself Annie hallelujah the devil don't can't get you when you're hit in there stick with it hold on to it don't let away from it no matter how many symptoms appear how many this or that or the other hole to it stay there until the healing power has drawn all the disease from you that's right he will do it hallelujah we have the Rock of Ages just stick to it it'll draw it all the sickness and disease hallelujah hallelujah so now we if we just go back to Mary and Martha's house the comforters have had their way for four days but now Jesus was on his road now when you know maybe I'll just say this but but Mary and Martha had to get out of that atmosphere they had to get into an atmosphere of faith to see the resurrection of the previous life hallelujah that's why would you keep an atmosphere of faith I mean what does worry do brother his worry has no virtue at all amen but faith can deliver hallelujah and and brother sees and faith is our victory says there there may not be a chance for you to live you may be dying with cancer you may be bound to a wheelchair you may be totally blind I don't know what your trouble is but if you just take the chief doctor's prescription whatsoever you desire when you pray believe you receive it and you shall have it and believe that faith will overcome any difficult that there is you may be so burden until sin unto I mean we're sittin till your soul is as smutty as it can be you may have tried to get rid of that ill temper that slandering tongue that gossip on the telephone you might have tried every remedy you know how but if you just let Jesus Christ come into you tonight he'll operate on your faith and give you a faith that will climb beyond anything that the word can produce world can produce why faith is the victory that overcomes the world holier how could you doubt when Jesus Christ and Son Living God as prison here now his great Holy Spirit in this building the word promise that lo I am with you always even to the end of the world it was promised by the Lord God has to keep his word do you believe that when he promised he would do these things God is solemnly obligated to do such a man no no from that scripture of you know I think it's in first John that our faith is our victory that overcomes the world that word victory means our means of success well that's only used once in the scripture that word victory there so it's our means of of success is our faith that's the victory so our revelation of who we are who God is actually is the means of our victories the means of our success over the world hallelujah but now merit so Mary Martha had resurrection faith amen they had the faith that that Jesus would come and raise yo they had resurrection faith but under the I'm no but being with their comforters in the house didn't help them didn't help that faith actually come to life so as soon as your says in John 11 and 20 then Martha as soon as she heard that Jews was coming went and met him I mean if it says but Mary I'm still sat in the house so now now Martha goes out gets out of that atmosphere hallelujah to go and actually meet the resurrection in the life hallelujah and then that's why you know you know if the comforters could just keep them in the atmosphere you're the devil in you I can stop this all from happening hallelujah if he could just keep you in that gloomy indifferent sad the precious pity party atmosphere God can't live it doesn't start it doesn't take your salvation away but God can't live in that kind of atmosphere I mean so so so Martha went out begin to speak with the Lord amen and then so so Martha now went from a different atmosphere of one of unbelief to one you know one that you know you know into one that wasn't one of pity party sadness and ultimately doubt in Lord Jesus Christ but she went to an atmosphere of the resurrection hallelujah because remember he was on his way and he came hallelujah and I'll say the same thing with you and I you may be sitting in the gloomiest worst spot in your life but you've got to remember Jesus is here the resurrection and the life is here to take that all away kaalia to restore the walk you once had to restore you back to that walk hallelujah so now Martha begins to speak to the Lord says Lord Jesus if thou has been here my brother had not died but I know that even now whatsoever thou will ask of God God will give it thee jesus said unto her thy brother shall raise again Martha said unto him I know that he shall raise again in the resurrection at the last day so if I can put in other words yes Lord I know when I'm an eternity then I'll be happy again yes Lord I know when I have my glorified body then I'll really shout and praise you and have joy and speakable but not now I can't have it now I know one day one day in the future when there's no sin there's no devil then I can really sing how I want to sing I can walk with God really how I want to walk but jesus never wants us to put the promise in the future he is not interested in saying yes one day no he said to her I am the resurrection and the life she saying I am present right now the resurrection of life not one day will be I am hallelujah so so he took Martha from a future one day because note how the confidence said one day in the resurrection you'll see him again one day you'll see him as he is putting off in the future the devil says one day but not now one day but not now but in the Lord comes his no no no not one day but now hallelujah hallelujah you can have joy now Martha you can have peace now Martha you can have an overcoming life now Martha you can rejoice now you're gonna have your first love now not in the future but right now hallelujah why cuz I am the resurrection and the life I haven't don't listen to the comforter of the devil he's a liar he just tried to rob you of your god-given rights hallelujah hallelujah but then he says no it's not for you that that event in your life was so traumatic hey death is a traumatic thing that death was so traumatic or so sad you can never have what you once had but you said

covenant with you remember God's covenant with you it's not you the devil and God it's you and God why the devil wasn't trying to interrupt the program but God's program will not be interrupted hallelujah loneliness is in mind that's not in the covenant I'll never leave thee nor forsake thee he's not a man that can lie hallelujah depression that's not in the covenant you got to look at what is yours not what is not yours well the devil tries to say this is yours you sign for you say no I didn't sign for this this is not part of the word this is not mine this is not God's portion for me hallelujah hell isn't mine tormund isn't mine thinking I'm worthless no that's not part of the Covenant why is God revealed himself to you this message is a bridegroom call halia and God gathering his bride he doesn't have a second-class woman he lifts her off to be joint heirs with himself Thalia says he sees him somebody sees you and he put actually higher value on you than he put us on life hallelujah because when you buy something I mean you the thing you buy you put a greater value than the money you have every to the blood of Jesus Christ God's blood he put you at higher value than his own blood a perfect sinless blood he says though I will gladly trade this for you hallelujah but then the comforters come along and say that's not your you can't really you don't you can't really have that kind of who said God didn't say God never said us not for you God never said you can be part of a group you can be part of a church for never exit in turn and receive the word that's best best being preached or you just have to be a spectator I'm sorry no that's not God's portion for any one of us that is not God's Porsche guy's Porsche so I'm going to meet you I'm going to fill you with my spoon I'm gonna live in your life I'm gonna manifest my glory in you I'm gonna reveal myself to you I'm going to show you who I am show you who I am in my word I'm going to show you who you are in my word I'm going to show you you're the apple of my eye show you you're my heart's desire show you're the white up love with an unfailing love hallelujah hallelujah isn't that right hey may I just say yes Lord yes Lord hallelujah that's for me yes Lord hallelujah says how can it he says and how can I overcome you know last week the devil told me a voice came here he said you should get these people to sit down this the devil told me that I was like I said no I'm not going to well I didn't because the devil wants us to sit down and shut up but no if we want to stand and shout stand and shout you want a dancer on however remember when the Spirit of God is anointing it's always in order why because it's God working so don't be afraid to be out of order if it's God leading you to do it it's an order Ryan hallelujah we have we have a right to rejoice the marriage of the lamb has come and his wife has made us how friendly and to you and des she was a grandeur that you'll be arrayed in fine linen clean and white cuz it put on the wedding garment it's been made to fit you hallelujah so let us be glad and rejoice hallelujah you think we don't have to go through tribulation hallelujah the wrath of gods can report out upon the earth and God said no you're not gonna be there I have to take you out I can't leave you on the earth however when I when I leave when the Holy Spirit lifts off the earth you have to come with because you're part of me you're part of the work hallelujah we've got a lot to rejoice about hallelujah hallelujah you know you know when brother cadre said let's go to heaven hallelujah I don't I didn't have all really I'll say yeah here we are but then to me that wasn't the greatest thing he says in the door comes open and then God's presence goes before him or mine and he steps in the door hallelujah hallelujah you know people say you don't need to shout God will hear you I see become making beef hallelujah he says overcome means to recognize the devil in every one of us trucks a lot of people says there's no devil it's just a thought don't you believe that there's a real devil he's just as real as you are or anybody a real devil and you must recognize him real you must know he's a devil then the same time that you recognize him and know that he's a devil that he's against you then to overcome him you must recognize that the God in you is greater than mighty than his that he that the one that's in you has already overcome him and by His grace you're more than a match for him amen there's real overcoming when you recognize you look back and say I'm doing this I'm doing that then no no no you're defeated but there's no condemnation to them that are in Christ Jesus that walk after the flesh but after the spirit then you realize that you have overcome and you and you know that that he's a devil you can't say I've got a sickness and I don't believe it's a sickness oh yes it's a sickness your cancer you don't believe it's a cancer it's a cancer it's a cancer but remember the greater is He that's in you than he that's in the world you must recognize that the Holy Spirit that's in you has already overcome the swing and he's in you and you can overcome by him that's exactly sensible that's exactly the way the scriptures written overcoming notice overcome the God that's in you is greater than the one that's in him the God of the world is not as great as the God of heaven which is at you know more than darkness can stand in the presence of light now darkness cannot stand in the presence of light I don't care how dark it is light will put it out I can't it can't stand glory but you take as much darkness as you want to and try and stand against light one time see what happened hallelujah and then but then of course we know Mary had to be there too so we can't we can't leave one of us under that gloom of the comfort of the devil you're all going to come out of that atmosphere hallelujah and then so and then so master goes back and calls her sister secretly saying the master has come and call the three he didn't give it a blanket call come Jersey you've come to come back come here no the Masters come and as soon as she heard that she rose quickly and came unto him hallelujah and then Jesus comes to the grave now here is here is the resurrection the life and he's about to show Mary and Martha what you lost I'm going to restore to you but now it's with a testimony now it's with the testimony because I wanted to show you Mary and Martha that what the devil took from you remember the devil you know death is Satan's device right so actually the devil stole their brother from them but now the Lord has one to show them what the devil is taken from you I'm going to restore it and you're gonna have now a testimony you're gonna have a victory dance and then because the devil took it but you weren't willing to stay in that state you call that to me and I delivered you even though it may have been what appears was four days late you may say well it's lingered a long time it's been a long season Jesus is never late Jesus is always right on time it's I have set in this house with these comforters a long time but Jesus is never late and now the Masters come the word has come and he call us for thee holy and I just I just get out of that depression I get out of that indifference I get out of the pain of my past or my regret or whatever it is I just get up and say Lord Jesus your word says forget the things which are in the past press under the mark of the high calling so just leave the past in the past it's under his blood you can't change it but he can you can fix it but he can parley and you can't make it right but he can hallelujah hallelujah can he not can he not fix it cannot make it hallelujah so now here they are and Jesus says where'd you lay him and then here comes here comes the juice worth because the devil always wants to wherever God is he just he's like pepper Otzi he just hangs around you know he shouldn't be paid for what he's done you know he's just here watching cuz he's got nothing to do anyway you know partner and then and then so now Jesus comes to the tomb and then Jesus weeps and then the juicy behold how he loved him see the devil wants us to be emotional he tries to want to keep us in an emotional realm you got to be real careful emotion can actually rob your faith because you can get so caught up in a most now anything with our emotion is did we understand they're right but they try and keep an emotional state and then now and then some of them said could not this man which open the eyes of the blind have caused that even this man should not have died so the comforters are coming with they're following where you going Martha I'm coming oh it's Jesus but couldn't you heal them he comes down right in the face of the resurrection amen and that's what happens among us the devil's right there doesn't mean you know to believe a mirror Martha were believers we're gonna meet them one day we're gonna meet Lazarus one day two hallelujah so now here they come here they come the comforters are right there but now Mary Martha I'm talking to them no more the devil say what he wants let him shoot his mouth off hook is but who are you listening to who are you listening - did those comforters help Mary and Martha has a devil that's robbed you helped you you know when he comes ease it's not for you you're too young you're too old you'll do something something excuse whatever place an excuse there you know you've got to actually say devil shut up who who who is my god Satan the spirit of suicide is not my God the spirit of pressure is not my god I meant pain hurt whatever you want to call it regret whatever it's not my god that's not the one that redeemed me so why should I pay attention to it you follow me why should I why should I give my ears to a voice of unbelief amen because the devil's gonna burn anyway I'm not going to the lake of fire that's not my Porsche it's his portion it's not mine that the lake of fire hell was craved for the devil and his angels not for me are you a devil or are you an angel that means it's not for you hallelujah so here comes the Lord where have you laid him he says no roll the stone away yeah he calls out with a loud voice and we know brother Brahim says he says if he hadn't called Lazarus by name there would have been a general resurrection so it cries out Lazarus come forth they roll the stone away may have got the those things mixed up at the beach but you know what I mean and then that what was dead now had life so what do you know he's calling joy come fall Hey come fall first love come fall hey come for my family come for overcoming power come fall hallelujah and what'd he do he restored it he says Lazarus and then he restore them back together and they went back and lived in the same house and the comforters were gone because now they had nothing to comfort about because the devil was defeated hallelujah does the same thing today friends you can it's your choice you can either call Lord Jesus I want my joy back I want my peace back I want my joy I want my first love back everything the devil's taken from me I remember what it's like when I first met you nothing man and I just rejoice I don't care how much I cried I danced I
