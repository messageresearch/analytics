[12:36] scripture too uh i just want to go to
[12:38] the
[12:39] song of solomon
[12:40] chapter eight
[12:43] and then we're going to go to i'm sorry

[13:00] it's a song of solomon uh verses chapter
[13:03] eight and we're gonna read from verse
[13:04] five down to
[13:07] verse 7 and then we're going to go to
[13:09] matthew 21
[13:11] amen so
[13:13] who is this
[13:15] that cometh up from the wilderness
[13:16] leaning upon her beloved
[13:20] i raised thee up under the apple tree
[13:22] there
[13:23] thy mother brought thee forth there she
[13:26] brought thee forth that bear thee
[13:28] set me as a seal upon thy heart and as a
[13:31] seal upon my arm
[13:32] for love is strong as death jealousy as
[13:35] cruel as the grave
[13:37] the coals thereof are coals of fire
[13:40] which have the most vehement flame
[13:44] many are many waters cannot quench love
[13:47] neither can the floods drown it
[13:49] if a man would give all the substance of
[13:52] his house for love
[13:53] it shall be utterly condemned
[13:56] now and let's go to matthew i don't have
[13:58] it on here let's go to matthew chapter
[14:00] 21.
[14:10] and we're just going to read from
[14:12] verse 4
[14:14] down to verse 11.
[14:16] and so i don't have it on the
[14:18] powerpoint as i say things change
[14:21] uh all this was done this is jesus
[14:24] telling his disciples to to go get the
[14:26] cult
[14:27] uh that he'd write upon him to do um
[14:29] into jerusalem all this was done that it
[14:31] might be fulfilled which is spoken by
[14:33] the prophet saying
[14:34] tell ye
[14:36] the daughter of zion behold thy king
[14:37] cometh upon
[14:39] uh unto thee so i meek and sitting upon
[14:42] an ass and a cult the fall of an ass and
[14:44] the disciples went and did as jesus
[14:46] commanded them and brought the ass and
[14:48] the cult and put on them their clothes
[14:51] and they set him there on and a very
[14:53] great multitude spread their garments in
[14:55] the way others cut down branches from
[14:58] the trees and straw them in the way and
[15:00] the multitudes that went before and that
[15:03] followed cried saying hosanna to the son
[15:05] of david blessed his is he that cometh
[15:08] in the name of the lord hosanna in the
[15:10] highest and when he was coming to
[15:12] jerusalem all the city was moved saying
[15:15] who is this
[15:17] and the multitude said this is jesus the
[15:19] prophet of nazareth of galilee

[17:46] friends you may have your seats uh this
[17:48] morning i wonder if i could take a title
[17:50] um
[17:52] i want to take this question
[17:55] so where are we
[17:56] who is this that cometh from the
[17:58] wilderness leaning upon her beloved who
[18:00] is this woman
[18:02] who is this woman you know there's
[18:03] always a question
[18:05] you know people look and they wonder who
[18:07] are these people
[18:09] you know we read there and um you know
[18:11] we read there in matthew 21 that euro
[18:14] the whole city was stirred you know
[18:15] brother brown dramatizes it in the
[18:17] message what is the you know the
[18:19] attraction on the mountain he'd say it
[18:20] was like a hot kind of day and there was
[18:22] a expectation in the air and people were
[18:24] gripped by you know by by by what was
[18:28] going on and and many were just caught
[18:30] up in the moment they didn't really
[18:31] fully even grasp what was going on even
[18:34] the disciples didn't really know what
[18:36] was going on you know you know the
[18:38] master just said go to the certain
[18:39] village you'll see a cult there by the
[18:41] certain house and go loose it and bring
[18:42] it here and you know you know and but
[18:44] but prophecy was being fulfilled and you
[18:46] know the word of god was being manifest
[18:48] and here was the son of david he was the
[18:50] king of kings riding into the riding
[18:53] into the city and and we know if you
[18:55] look at history there were many great
[18:57] conquerors rode into that city
[18:59] many great conquerors alexander the
[19:00] great would ride in there you know king
[19:02] david would ride in there many great men
[19:04] many great generals many great armies
[19:06] would march in but here was the greatest
[19:08] one
[19:09] that would ever stand upon the earth in
[19:12] human flesh he was the greatest he was
[19:14] more than a general he was more than a
[19:16] king but he was the creator himself made
[19:18] flesh and he was riding up into the city
[19:21] now it's amazing when you think about it
[19:24] in the human mind you'd think he'd have
[19:26] the finest finest horse that they could
[19:28] ever be you know they would search
[19:30] literally the earth for the finest
[19:31] stallion or the finest whatever it may
[19:34] be the finest horse whatever color you
[19:36] know whatever height however many hands
[19:38] tall you know and it'd be right in the
[19:40] finest robes and the fight you know and
[19:42] the and the procession would be so great
[19:44] there'd be you know everyone would be
[19:46] you know dressed up you know you know
[19:47] the best way they can be who's seen a
[19:49] military parade
[19:51] you know who seemed like when you know
[19:53] royalty dies in england and there was a
[19:55] great pomp and ceremony as the carriage
[19:57] ghosts passed through wherever it goes
[19:59] and you know there's all the troops and
[20:00] they're all there you know you think
[20:02] it'll be that kind of possession
[20:04] but here were people a bunch of ragtag
[20:06] people cutting branches off palm trees
[20:09] throwing their coats down and i doubt
[20:11] you know they were ever really very
[20:12] clean you know a bunch of ragtag bunch
[20:14] of peasants we would call them you know
[20:17] just to the natural eye now and they
[20:19] were laying down their coats they were
[20:20] throwing down the palm trees out crying
[20:21] out hosanna blessed is he that you know
[20:23] comes in the name of the lord
[20:25] and and and the scribes and pharisees
[20:27] because the whole city was moved and
[20:29] they said who is this
[20:31] what is going on here what's this noise
[20:34] you know this is not what normally
[20:35] happens on this kind of day what's going
[20:37] on here
[20:38] and and and they told them this is jesus
[20:41] of nazareth the prophet of galilee
[20:44] hallelujah but what was happening the
[20:46] word was being fulfilled there was an
[20:48] attraction there was a drawing there was
[20:50] a pull
[20:52] but when they looked at him
[20:54] they were saying no this is not the son
[20:56] of david this is not him but it was him
[20:59] hallelujah
[21:00] now i showed you wait let's just i
[21:04] showed you this photo picture rather
[21:05] this drawing last week
[21:07] and i was talking about the heart of the
[21:09] people and you know how they are
[21:10] prepared and the arc was you know
[21:12] there but you know we would think if
[21:15] something was greater than this it would
[21:17] look greater
[21:18] right it would look greater so the
[21:20] temple would be bigger the you know the
[21:23] the the altar would be fancier you know
[21:25] the people would be more finely dressed
[21:27] it would be you know the trumpets would
[21:29] be tuned better we think would be
[21:30] greater
[21:31] but the thing is as the lord uh changes
[21:34] his form
[21:36] i'd say the outward appearance actually
[21:38] does not look greater but the inward
[21:41] glory is far greater
[21:43] right so so you take this now here is
[21:46] god coming to dwell among his people in
[21:48] the temple that that his son david had a
[21:51] desire to build
[21:52] and we know that when the ark took its
[21:54] place the glory of the lord filled the
[21:55] place and the ministers couldn't
[21:57] minister it was a glorious occasion
[21:59] but we know that that wasn't god's final
[22:01] resting place you know he says god
[22:03] doesn't dwell in a temple made with
[22:05] hands he doesn't need man to craft
[22:07] stones and build plans and you know put
[22:09] in a foundation and put rocks and you
[22:11] know this is not how god works this is
[22:13] this is not his final resting place i
[22:16] mean but but god dwells in the human
[22:18] heart
[22:19] and even even when he'd say in isaiah
[22:21] you know i made the heavens i made the
[22:22] universe i made you can't even see to
[22:25] the edge of the universe but i made
[22:26] everything in it heaven is my throne
[22:28] earth is my footstool but where's the
[22:29] place of my rest he's actually saying
[22:32] you know i made everything but where's
[22:33] the place i can rest holy i want a final
[22:36] resting place is what god wants i mean
[22:38] so we would think naturally that if if
[22:41] god would have a final resting place it
[22:43] would look greater than that outwardly
[22:45] that's not the case
[22:47] this was the final resting place god
[22:50] ordained
[22:51] amen because remember the the earthly
[22:53] tabernacle you know the earthly temple
[22:55] was just a transition
[22:57] but this was god's final intent was that
[22:59] he would dwell in man once again
[23:01] so you'd think it would look greater
[23:02] than this now to god this was far
[23:04] greater because he took 120 people i
[23:08] mean that gave their lives surrendered
[23:10] their lives to him didn't matter where
[23:11] they came from amen remember remember
[23:14] the you know the you know the material
[23:15] that made the temple came from many
[23:17] different places
[23:18] right many different places shoot out of
[23:20] different quarries and wood came from
[23:22] different places and stones and but
[23:24] eventually when the temple came together
[23:26] and god came and dwelt in the temple
[23:28] that was the important thing and it's
[23:30] the same thing with these stones as the
[23:31] scripture says we are lively stones
[23:33] we're living stones you know even even
[23:36] the disciples were amazed at how great
[23:38] the temple was
[23:39] now we know that herod rebuilt you know
[23:41] this is solomon dedicating the temple so
[23:43] it was destroyed we know rebuilt in
[23:44] nehemiah's day expanded you know in in
[23:48] herod's day and and that and the
[23:50] disciples said to said to um jesus what
[23:53] goodly stones are here because remember
[23:55] they're from galilee they're from the
[23:56] backwater but now here they are in the
[23:58] capitol everything's big and shiny and
[23:59] wow
[24:00] you know look at these stones and jesus
[24:02] just saying basically
[24:04] don't pay attention to these stones
[24:07] it may look fancy but it's not fancy you
[24:09] know it may look like the real thing but
[24:11] no no and he's actually jesus is
[24:13] addressing the stones that are the real
[24:15] part of the temple
[24:17] he's actually looking at stones you know
[24:19] when when jesus came into his ministry
[24:21] what did he do go go to peter james and
[24:23] john come follow me
[24:25] went to matthew come follow me went to
[24:27] the womb at the well basically come
[24:28] follow me and begin to call stones for
[24:31] the building i mean because he knew
[24:33] where those stones were he knew what
[24:35] rubber sheep they were in didn't matter
[24:36] if they were a tax collector if they
[24:38] zacchaeus if the other woman at the well
[24:40] if they are legion if they were ignorant
[24:42] fishermen that didn't matter it doesn't
[24:44] matter where we came from i mean the
[24:45] thing that matters is where we're going
[24:47] hallelujah that's the important thing
[24:49] amen so we must never ever focus on
[24:51] where we came from we should focus on
[24:53] where we're going that's the most
[24:54] important thing hallelujah so now jesus
[24:56] began to call stones hallelujah and and
[25:00] and he began to gather these stones but
[25:01] we know the intent of the temple is not
[25:03] to be a vacant temple
[25:05] right he didn't just gather people to
[25:07] see if he could gather people but he had
[25:09] an intent
[25:10] in gathering those people so now here
[25:12] was 120 in the upper room and i don't
[25:14] know if this is how it exactly was but
[25:17] you know
[25:18] here was this looked far worse
[25:22] than this i will agree here here was a
[25:24] bunch of ragtag
[25:26] people you take the head of this group
[25:29] he tried to kill a guy with a sword and
[25:31] then he denies the god he's trying he
[25:33] was professing to defend
[25:35] and the reason he he cut the guy's air
[25:37] off is because he wasn't a swordsman
[25:38] he's a fisherman
[25:40] so
[25:40] so now all so the past is an attempted
[25:43] murderer
[25:44] right
[25:45] matthew's a tax collector well they're
[25:47] dodgy to begin with
[25:48] you know there's the woman at the well
[25:50] well we know where she came from
[25:52] amen oh look at these guys who profess
[25:54] to be the ministry ignorant unlearned
[25:56] men
[25:57] you know how can you ever trust people
[25:59] who can't even sign their own name
[26:00] they're not really here you know they
[26:02] haven't learned anything but this was
[26:03] the people that this is the caliber of
[26:05] people that god gathered i mean it
[26:07] didn't matter what problems they had
[26:09] didn't matter what complexes they had
[26:11] didn't matter what pain they were
[26:12] carrying god wasn't looking at the pain
[26:15] or the complexes of where they came he
[26:16] said come and follow me
[26:18] hallelujah and they said lord let's go
[26:20] we'll follow you
[26:22] hallelujah so so he gathered these
[26:23] stones so here they were they weren't
[26:25] finally dressed the upper room wasn't a
[26:28] big fancy place this is in my opinion
[26:30] they weren't finally dressed they just
[26:32] looked like the common
[26:34] you know people even the lord himself
[26:35] when he was walking through jerusalem i
[26:37] believe he just would have walked past
[26:39] many people
[26:40] and they would never have never have
[26:42] noticed him
[26:43] you know it's just like you know it
[26:44] amazes me i wish i should take a screen
[26:46] grab of it i should do but who's seen
[26:48] the deep call to the deep film
[26:51] okay so there's this one part and so
[26:53] brother brahms here i guess
[26:55] there's someone here and he's discerning
[26:57] the hearts and things and you see a guy
[26:59] walk past with the newspaper
[27:01] who's seen it
[27:02] this guy is walking past with a
[27:03] newspaper just like this along the
[27:05] platform
[27:06] why did he get out of the service
[27:09] you know
[27:10] it's on film you can see it he's just
[27:12] like reading a newspaper walking by and
[27:14] here's god coming down
[27:16] the son of man is being revealed
[27:19] the most powerful jesus christ is you
[27:21] know brother braham said that jesus did
[27:23] more in his ministry than he did in his
[27:25] own earthly ministry because notice he
[27:27] did more not me he says i'm just your
[27:28] brother so god did far more in this end
[27:31] time than even in this whole scriptures
[27:33] being recorded and a guy's walking past
[27:35] it reading a newspaper missing the whole
[27:36] thing
[27:38] we don't want to fall into that category
[27:39] of of of people you say could people
[27:41] really do that well they did it when
[27:43] jesus was here they should do it when
[27:45] god is now in his church
[27:47] so here they were ragtag bunch of people
[27:50] and outwardly you know
[27:53] what are these people doing
[27:55] but this was far more glorious
[27:58] remember i started with the scripture
[27:59] from from the song of solomon who is
[28:01] this
[28:03] that that you know cometh up from the
[28:05] wilderness leaning upon her beloved
[28:07] who is this one
[28:09] who is this beloved
[28:11] hallelujah so this was far greater glory
[28:15] amen than than the temple because now
[28:18] god wasn't just dwelling in a temple of
[28:20] stone but he was walking in his people i
[28:22] mean where exactly he intended to dwell
[28:24] this is where he wanted to dwell and
[28:26] sometimes we allow
[28:29] ourselves
[28:31] not even just the devil to belittle who
[28:33] we are in christ
[28:35] i'm just a common person i'm not very
[28:37] smart i'm not very i'm just i'm just
[28:39] average i just hit average you know i
[28:41] just i i just passed my trick
[28:44] i just got my degree i just hit average
[28:48] solid average
[28:50] you know
[28:51] anyway
[28:52] but i mean
[28:55] look at the bride of christ
[28:57] even the apostle paul says where's the
[28:58] lord where's the scribes among you
[28:59] where's the great people
[29:01] you know he's asking these questions
[29:03] and many times we you know we even allow
[29:06] the devil allows you know or we allow
[29:08] him or even ourselves to
[29:10] we say there's nothing special about us
[29:14] okay maybe i'll just preach myself again
[29:16] welcome you know but look at these
[29:17] people look at these guys
[29:20] there's mary peter whoever you know
[29:22] nothing special
[29:23] about them they weren't the celebrity of
[29:25] the city no one really knew who they
[29:27] were but in god's mind
[29:29] hallelujah here's my beloved i may have
[29:32] been waiting for her to come to the
[29:33] earth and now i'm just not sending
[29:36] someone i'm coming myself to gather her
[29:38] hallelujah to me
[29:40] hallelujah amen so this is you know
[29:43] you're in god's mind these ones these
[29:45] were the these are the whole thrusts
[29:47] these are his motivation you say to get
[29:49] up in the morning not that god sleeps
[29:51] but you know sometimes we get up and
[29:53] we've got such a drive i've got to do a
[29:54] certain thing
[29:55] amen i've got to i've got to do this at
[29:57] work or i want to spend time with my
[29:58] family or whatever it is you want to do
[30:00] i've got to you know god gets up in the
[30:02] morning if i can say it that way say i
[30:04] want to spend time with my wife
[30:06] i want overall and i want to express my
[30:08] love to her and i'll walk with her
[30:10] through the day you know we're his
[30:11] motivation
[30:14] glory to god and we look at ourselves
[30:15] saying oh boy what am i doing upon this
[30:17] earth we have a purpose i mean god has
[30:19] given us a purpose amen and we should
[30:21] say lord what is our purpose
[30:23] hallelujah you know it was funny i was
[30:26] like well i don't know if it was funny
[30:27] but i was flying back from um sister
[30:29] val's funeral
[30:32] and i don't know what
[30:34] however many thousand feet i am in that
[30:36] plane
[30:36] you know i'm thinking what am i really
[30:38] here for
[30:40] what am i what are we really here for
[30:43] now i'm not just talking about sitting
[30:44] in a plane i know why i'm in a plane
[30:46] because i just went to a funeral now i'm
[30:47] coming home so i know why i'm there but
[30:49] why am i here
[30:51] why am i upon the earth is it just to
[30:54] you know is it just to have you know is
[30:56] it just to have a nice family and maybe
[30:58] have a career maybe have a nice church
[31:00] and you know have good friends and you
[31:02] know travel or whatever is it is that
[31:04] really it
[31:05] why are we here
[31:07] you know we should really think about
[31:08] that sometimes
[31:11] the reason we're here is god wanted us
[31:12] here
[31:14] and he wanted a place to express himself
[31:16] through
[31:18] hallelujah
[31:21] amen so we you know
[31:24] who is this that cometh up from the
[31:25] wilderness leaning upon her beloved
[31:29] we could go back to genesis i'm just
[31:31] going to leave that up there because um
[31:33] it will just leave it there but but i
[31:34] want you to think about it remember the
[31:36] same holy ghost that came on the day of
[31:38] pentecost is the same god that's come to
[31:40] us
[31:40] the exactly the same one not a different
[31:42] god not a lesser anointing the same one
[31:45] i mean the same one that filled them and
[31:47] they went out they overcame in their age
[31:49] and they spread the word and they were a
[31:50] living witness and whatever capacity
[31:52] they were ordained to be it was darkest
[31:55] making clothes for people it was people
[31:57] who went and preached it was those who
[31:58] just helped out whatever it was
[32:00] whatever their capacity was or whatever
[32:02] they were ordained to do rather they did
[32:04] it amen every every one of us in this
[32:07] room has a place in the body of christ
[32:10] every single one of us is essential
[32:12] i mean just like brother john andy said
[32:14] you know we're all essential workers
[32:16] amen in the in the body of christ amen
[32:19] we are all have a part to play none of
[32:21] us are spectators none of us are sitting
[32:24] on the ground eating the popcorn saying
[32:25] go go go no no we're on the field
[32:28] amen so now
[32:30] we could go back to genesis chapter two
[32:32] when when when eve was taken out of adam
[32:35] and when god brought when when when god
[32:38] brought eve to adam he would begin to
[32:40] tell her because remember he's named all
[32:42] the animals
[32:43] and he named them based on their
[32:45] character
[32:46] he called the serpent the serpent
[32:48] because he was a serpent the fox of fox
[32:50] right
[32:51] the rat cunning is a you know you know
[32:53] all those different
[32:55] sayings we have is because he he named
[32:57] them by their nature
[32:58] and so now when he's when he's now
[33:00] beginning to speak to eve he says now
[33:03] this is bone of my bones
[33:05] flesh of my flesh she shall she shall be
[33:08] called woman because she is taken out of
[33:10] man
[33:11] so now he's not just identifying a
[33:13] different species he's actually saying
[33:14] this is part of me you are part of me
[33:16] you came out of me and we're one flesh i
[33:19] mean so we're not two different kind of
[33:21] people actually one
[33:22] one hallelujah so now this is so this is
[33:25] now the question that's being raised is
[33:27] who is this
[33:29] and now here's the answer kind of
[33:30] unfolding hopefully
[33:32] amen you know so so
[33:35] it wasn't eve that that that
[33:38] she didn't work out who she was
[33:41] adam told her who she was
[33:43] amen and it's got to be the same thing
[33:45] with you and i
[33:46] let him tell you who you are
[33:49] i mean because i'm persuaded
[33:51] i mean that we are the bride of christ
[33:54] i mean we are the apple of his eye
[33:56] we are his beloved we are his redeemed
[33:59] ones and the reason i can say that is
[34:01] not just because i'm quoting it from a
[34:02] book is because god comes down i mean
[34:05] and vindicator says or so i mean because
[34:07] it's when he comes in behind his word
[34:08] and proves it
[34:10] that's when all doubt can go
[34:12] amen oh lord you even even just to be
[34:15] convicted on your heart that you're
[34:16] wrong that's the grace of god to you
[34:19] that's actually god dealing with you
[34:20] saying child come here
[34:22] child walk with me i want to show you
[34:24] who you really are i don't want you
[34:26] caught up in this world and what
[34:27] everyone tells you you know that you
[34:29] should be i want to show you who you're
[34:31] meant to be who you really are
[34:33] hallelujah so so just as there was a
[34:36] question
[34:37] when when jesus went into uh jerusalem
[34:40] who is this
[34:42] if that was this if that was the
[34:44] question about the bridegroom it'll be
[34:46] the same with the bride who is this who
[34:48] are these people
[34:50] you often wonder that who am i
[34:52] we've all had that kind of question who
[34:54] am i
[34:55] you know as you go from a child to an
[34:57] adult there's always a question where do
[34:58] i fit
[35:02] yeah where do i fit you know you know
[35:04] like you go to school you try and fit
[35:05] them with these kind of people and maybe
[35:07] you want to try and go and join the cool
[35:09] kids and
[35:10] you know
[35:12] okay just me anyway and then you find
[35:13] out you don't fit there so you go back
[35:15] to where you were and you realize who
[35:17] true friends really are
[35:19] right but you know he tries to help
[35:20] where do i fit
[35:22] and and there's always uh trying to
[35:24] discover i just need to know where do i
[35:26] belong
[35:28] and the lord is here trying to say this
[35:30] is where you belong you belong with me
[35:33] right you belong to walk with me i mean
[35:35] this is where you fit
[35:37] hallelujah you don't fit in the world
[35:39] you can try and fit but it's like
[35:40] putting a square peg in a round hole you
[35:43] can force it so much but it just doesn't
[35:44] seem to go sometimes it sticks but it
[35:47] doesn't go through
[35:48] right so i'm like oh i you know i
[35:50] finally fit here but then you realize
[35:52] no i don't fit here
[35:54] it's because the lord is trying to stir
[35:56] you up
[35:57] saying you don't belong in that you're a
[36:00] square peg come fit in a square hole
[36:02] what's the square hole my word you fit
[36:04] with me
[36:06] i don't want to sound too jokey there
[36:08] but
[36:10] amen now we have to realize that with us
[36:14] we're not walking alone
[36:17] we can go to song of solomon again again
[36:19] i go um i don't have this on here but
[36:21] song of solomon
[36:23] 6 and
[36:24] 13. remember it was more than just jesus
[36:27] riding it wasn't just a man on a donkey
[36:29] riding into jerusalem
[36:31] that was god and the unseen realm angels
[36:33] were there
[36:35] hallelujah
[36:36] god was coming into a city
[36:40] and we have to recognize and i and and
[36:42] and i trust you already do but you know
[36:44] there's more than just us walking upon
[36:45] the earth if i've repeated myself well
[36:47] i'll just keep sorry i just repeat you
[36:49] know i had a lecturer inorganic
[36:51] chemistry lecturer he didn't give us any
[36:53] much handouts we just said write down
[36:55] what i say he says if i repeat myself
[36:57] there's a reason
[36:59] you know and it was the repeating bits
[37:00] that were really in the exams
[37:02] not necessarily all the filler and it
[37:04] wasn't fellow because it was you know
[37:05] knowledge you needed to know right but
[37:07] it was he said the things i repeat
[37:09] those are the things you should write
[37:10] down
[37:12] so we're all listening is he going to
[37:13] repeat it is he not and you write it
[37:14] down
[37:15] you know so maybe i'm the same way i
[37:17] don't know but or anyway
[37:19] don't say anything about mage anyway
[37:21] song of solomon 6-13
[37:23] it says return return o shulamite return
[37:28] return that we may look upon thee
[37:30] what will ye see in the shulamite in
[37:33] other words who is this
[37:35] who is this what will you see in the
[37:37] shulamite as it were the company of two
[37:40] armies
[37:41] now when it speaks about the company of
[37:43] two armies it's talking about
[37:45] the the heavenly host and the natural
[37:48] host so there's two armies when the
[37:50] shulamites returning now it's not just
[37:53] her returning but then in the unseen
[37:55] realm hallelujah there's an army with
[37:57] her there's angels of god in attendance
[38:00] amen and this is from when when jacob
[38:03] was returning back to to to see his
[38:05] brother esau and the angels visited him
[38:09] and he realized that there's actually
[38:10] two camps in this place or it's called
[38:12] mahanayam this place called mahanayam
[38:14] the place of two camps so it wasn't just
[38:16] an earthly camp it wasn't just jacob and
[38:18] there's his family there's his herds and
[38:20] his servants and things no there was
[38:22] more there than what he could see with a
[38:23] natural eye but a visitation of angels
[38:26] came to him and he realized i'm not just
[38:28] here walking alone
[38:30] hallelujah
[38:31] you know he still had to wrestle with
[38:32] the angel be changed to be called israel
[38:34] or you know uh you know prince with god
[38:36] and but he recognized it's actually not
[38:38] just me
[38:40] making this journey back to my homeland
[38:42] hallelujah but the angels of god are in
[38:44] attendance so this is why this question
[38:46] was asked what will you see in the
[38:48] shulamite now the shulamat we know
[38:50] represents you and i
[38:52] i mean this this this love affair
[38:54] between solomon and you know you know
[38:55] you know the bride and the bridegroom
[38:57] between solomon the shulamite you know
[38:59] this is an allegory speaking of us in
[39:00] christ amen hallelujah so now there's a
[39:03] question now what will you see in this
[39:05] bride
[39:07] amen you'll see as it were two armies
[39:10] hallelujah there's the natural
[39:12] hey we're a mighty army of the lord
[39:14] i'm a soldier
[39:16] in the army of the lord
[39:18] a soldier
[39:20] in the army yeah if i die let me die in
[39:24] the army that's why i don't sing
[39:26] specials
[39:27] but you know we're a soldier we're in an
[39:30] army
[39:30] but it's not just us fighting this
[39:32] battle remember we are fighting against
[39:34] spiritual wickedness powers and high
[39:37] places demon powers remember this fight
[39:39] that we fight is not a natural fight
[39:42] amen that's why you've got to be able to
[39:43] discern when the enemy comes into your
[39:45] mind i mean as i think the greatest
[39:47] problem brother brown preaches a sermon
[39:49] the greatest battle ever fought right
[39:51] and it's such an essential amen when
[39:53] we're walking through this life's
[39:55] journey because the battle is so much in
[39:57] the mind these days i mean in the dark
[39:59] angels i mean i mean dark ages rather it
[40:02] was more of a the saw it was demon
[40:04] powers fighting the believers but they
[40:06] were physically tormented they are
[40:08] physically tortured right
[40:10] it was a physical fight too but here
[40:13] it's all up in here
[40:14] amen so we need to be able to discern
[40:19] when thoughts come into your mind and
[40:20] your emotions goes up and down and you
[40:22] get in your withdrawn and unhappy and
[40:26] you know complex and whatever more
[40:28] what's causing it
[40:30] right we need to be able to discern it's
[40:31] a hold on
[40:33] is this my bridegroom
[40:36] is this my lovely lord jesus making me
[40:38] think this way
[40:41] um if you feel that way then no
[40:44] why does it feel like i'm going to have
[40:45] a heart attack i'm all strung out and
[40:46] stressed and worried and flustered and
[40:49] is this the lord
[40:50] we should just stop you know this world
[40:52] is so fast-paced
[40:55] just pull over and park
[40:57] sit get off the motorway
[40:59] park sit and say is this god or is this
[41:01] satan there's only two
[41:03] it's not you know it's not like a
[41:05] spectrum of fully god and kind of mainly
[41:07] god and you know it's not like changing
[41:09] the heat on your in your car it's cold
[41:12] or hot and you just turn the dial it's
[41:13] mainly you know it's not a mixture it's
[41:16] either god or satan so we need to be
[41:18] able to really identify lord is this you
[41:21] and it's real simple you know brother
[41:23] brown was asked how do i know i'm
[41:24] thinking the thoughts of god well
[41:25] brother ram says well his thoughts are
[41:27] his word
[41:29] right yo that's how you know if you're
[41:31] thinking the thoughts of god is because
[41:32] well is it the scripture
[41:35] is it the thoughts of peace
[41:37] amen you know paul says whatsoever
[41:40] things are good whatever things are
[41:41] lovely true
[41:42] think on those things
[41:45] amen
[41:46] we say well this person did this to me
[41:48] well that may be true but it is true
[41:51] because whatever things are true uh
[41:52] god's word
[41:54] right so you know we need to be able to
[41:56] discern
[41:58] because if you can't discern an enemy
[42:01] he will come and do what he wants and
[42:02] he'll go
[42:04] how is a battle won a battle's won
[42:07] you know a battle is not necessarily
[42:09] just one on the battlefield
[42:10] it's one in intelligence
[42:13] you know where the enemy is then you can
[42:14] move according to where the enemy is why
[42:17] did the king of syria get so frustrated
[42:19] he'd send his enemy i mean so he'd send
[42:21] his troops into the enemy land which was
[42:23] israel and and then the prophet would go
[42:26] to the king and say they're coming here
[42:27] go here
[42:28] and then it keep happening
[42:31] and he thought there's got to be a mole
[42:33] or a spy in my camp he told his people
[42:35] one of you is a traitor
[42:37] you know and then one of his men said no
[42:39] hold on
[42:40] don't you know that israel's got a
[42:41] prophet and he knows your thoughts in
[42:43] your bed chamber
[42:45] so how did they win
[42:47] i mean how were they winning because
[42:48] they they knew what the enemy was doing
[42:51] but if they didn't know what they were
[42:53] doing then syria would have conquered
[42:54] them you know because they were a far
[42:56] greater nation
[42:58] right so it's intelligence you know it's
[43:00] in the intelligence and even now what
[43:02] happens is is how how they try and win a
[43:05] war as they try and start thinking ahead
[43:09] of what the enemy command structure will
[43:10] think
[43:11] so if you know that your enemy will do
[43:13] certain things
[43:14] then you try and preempt what he's going
[43:16] to do and then you can cut him off
[43:17] before he gets there
[43:20] i mean so the devil studies us i don't
[43:22] know why i'm going down this way but
[43:23] here we are
[43:24] you know the devil studies us
[43:26] he knows our weaknesses
[43:28] he knows our mood he knows our
[43:30] temperament
[43:31] and he knows how to use it against us
[43:34] right he knows because he studied us so
[43:37] he knows if i get them to feel this way
[43:39] about this thing they'll do this
[43:42] yep if i get them to feel this way about
[43:44] this thing they'll do that
[43:47] and he just pushes play
[43:50] and exactly as he predicted it happens
[43:54] but we have a hidden source of strength
[43:57] we have someone in us that can break
[43:59] that cycle remember we have the right
[44:02] weapon to overcome the devil any place
[44:04] anytime anywhere father ham said this
[44:07] end time message meets end time
[44:09] conditions he said it was preached 50 60
[44:11] years ago now this end time message
[44:13] meets end time conditions amen and the
[44:15] anointing of the holy ghost will defeat
[44:17] the devil any place anytime anywhere
[44:20] amen we have the soldier in the
[44:21] battlefield i mean the holy ghost
[44:23] himself i remember you let him come
[44:25] forth into your mind and conquer that
[44:27] thing i mean you can't just try and
[44:29] wrestle in your own self that's why you
[44:31] the bible says draw nigh to god
[44:34] resist the devil and he shall flee from
[44:36] you
[44:37] hallelujah
[44:39] amen but we have the battle remember
[44:41] when the shulamites there a place of two
[44:43] armies
[44:44] what is greater than the armies of
[44:46] heaven
[44:47] what is greater
[44:49] remember our lord jesus went down to
[44:51] hell
[44:52] took the keys of hell death in the grave
[44:55] totally stripped the devil stripped them
[44:58] it's like marching into america and
[44:59] taking every single piece of armament
[45:01] they have
[45:02] every single piece and bring it home
[45:06] every gun every tank every missile every
[45:08] bomb every plane every ship
[45:11] stripped
[45:12] and they can't build them
[45:14] again it's like that the devil can't he
[45:16] he has no weapon in it all he has is a
[45:18] bluff
[45:21] you know people many many nations around
[45:23] the world they'll have military parades
[45:26] and they and their enemies will examine
[45:28] the footage
[45:29] and they should say are those weapons
[45:30] really real
[45:31] they are goose stepping along all in one
[45:33] and you know carrying these big
[45:35] fandangle guns or these big tanks and
[45:37] you know driving along and the enemies
[45:38] will say is that actually real
[45:40] or is that actually just a mock
[45:42] you know a mock-up it's like in world
[45:44] war ii the british during the battle of
[45:46] britain when the nazis were bombing
[45:48] england and so on they would build fake
[45:50] planes
[45:52] just out of wood
[45:53] and and put them on airfields
[45:56] so the nazis were thinking oh there's
[45:57] the enemy planes we're going to bomb
[45:58] them they're fake but from that distance
[46:01] they looked real
[46:03] and that's how the devil does
[46:05] he walks around with a fake gun
[46:08] a fake fear
[46:09] a fake torment
[46:11] a fake worry
[46:12] a fake what oh this could happen of all
[46:14] you better oh yeah
[46:16] no way you'll save your children no way
[46:18] they're going to be there no way this is
[46:19] going to happen oh you know all this
[46:21] fake kind of fear
[46:22] but we really need to examine it with
[46:24] this
[46:26] you know how they prove if photos have
[46:28] been you know photoshopped or not people
[46:30] study them a casual guidance will say
[46:32] well that's real but people will put it
[46:33] through a program so no that's not real
[46:36] there's one program we need to put the
[46:37] thoughts of the devil through is this
[46:39] program
[46:40] right and it will show us actually
[46:43] if it's true or not
[46:45] and he never says anything that's true
[46:48] amen so oh is he really telling the
[46:50] truth no
[46:51] he's lying
[46:53] because he doesn't know the end
[46:55] he knows his end
[46:57] right but he doesn't know the end
[46:59] remember his brother kaijo preached it
[47:01] to be continued
[47:03] there's always the to be continued
[47:04] chapter amen this is not the end of the
[47:06] series
[47:07] oh this is not the end of the program i
[47:09] mean there's always a next a next season
[47:10] coming up to be continued
[47:13] hallelujah that's why we must never say
[47:14] well i guess this is just how it's going
[47:15] to be no no to be continued
[47:18] hallelujah
[47:20] amen so we
[47:23] have a we are a place of two armies have
[47:26] you ever seen the lord come on the scene
[47:27] for you
[47:29] why that's the heavenly host stepping
[47:30] down taking taking control
[47:33] that means it's not just you walking
[47:34] around the earth god comes down and
[47:36] proves himself in your life amen
[47:40] now
[47:42] can we have this again i'm going to
[47:44] actually use it
[47:50] i just want to read this and just say
[47:51] i'll say this oh here we are no we'll go
[47:53] back this way
[47:56] okay you can't i'll read that fast
[48:00] now
[48:02] it's amazing how the lord is not ashamed
[48:04] to be identified with us he is not
[48:06] ashamed
[48:08] he is not ashamed to be identified just
[48:10] like where you know we were in the song
[48:11] of solomon you know she's leaning on the
[48:12] arms of her beloved amen he's not
[48:15] ashamed to say this is my woman
[48:17] hallelujah this is my wife
[48:20] everything i am is hers everything she
[48:22] is is mine
[48:23] we're one you can't you can't separate
[48:26] us in any way
[48:27] this is how he looks at you
[48:30] hallelujah
[48:31] so he says here i think
[48:37] thou has put this is this hebrews
[48:39] chapter two
[48:40] that was put all things in subjection
[48:42] under his feet
[48:44] for in that he put in all he put all in
[48:47] subjection unto him
[48:48] he left nothing that is not put under
[48:50] him but now we see not
[48:53] yet all things put under him but we see
[48:55] jesus who was made a little lower than
[48:57] the angels for the suffering of death
[48:59] crowned with glory and honor that he by
[49:02] the grace of god should taste death
[49:05] for every man
[49:10] for it became him of whom are all things
[49:13] and by whom are all things in bringing
[49:15] many sons unto glory to make the captain
[49:18] of their salvation perfect through
[49:20] sufferings
[49:21] for both he that sanctifieth
[49:24] and they who are sanctified are all of
[49:26] one
[49:27] for which cause he is not ashamed to
[49:30] call them brethren
[49:32] so the one that does the sanctifying i'm
[49:33] just gonna speak in my own language the
[49:36] one that sanctifies and the ones who are
[49:38] sanctified are all of one so now he came
[49:41] down he became man
[49:43] to to identify himself with human beings
[49:46] right to actually not just call the
[49:48] people and put them to one side but
[49:51] actually that he would actually join
[49:52] himself with those people in such a way
[49:55] that you couldn't separate him and those
[49:56] people
[49:57] i mean just saying like the bride amen
[49:59] and the groom they are one so he came
[50:02] down as a man i mean to identify himself
[50:04] with you
[50:05] hallelujah that when he did that you
[50:07] can't separate him and the bride anymore
[50:09] he can't separate himself from you
[50:12] that's why he that sanctifieth and those
[50:14] who are sanctified are all of one
[50:16] for which cause
[50:18] he is not ashamed to call them brethren
[50:21] amen so so
[50:23] the reason he says saying i'll declare
[50:25] thy name unto my brethren in the midst
[50:27] of the church will i sing praises unto
[50:29] thee
[50:30] i mean just think about god
[50:32] the one who filled all time and space
[50:34] the one who made all things even the
[50:36] angels appear filthy in his sight the
[50:39] great holy god came down
[50:41] became a man
[50:43] because there were people upon the earth
[50:46] there was this bride on the earth
[50:49] he says i want her to lean on my arm
[50:51] walk out of this wilderness
[50:53] hallelujah i want people to ask
[50:55] questions who is this
[50:57] who is this that leans upon the arm of
[50:58] her beloved
[51:00] and so he became one of us he became the
[51:02] poorest of the poor amen that he'd be
[51:04] able to identify himself with human
[51:06] beings they say actually adam's fallen
[51:09] race they're part of me
[51:10] hallelujah amen it's not just they're
[51:13] down here and i'm up here and i want
[51:14] them where i am
[51:16] glory
[51:18] that's how great our god is the one
[51:19] who's so great he became so little and
[51:22] brother ham says that's actually what
[51:23] makes god so great he can humble himself
[51:25] and become so little remember to the
[51:28] natural light that doesn't make sense
[51:29] because they think of god or some big
[51:31] you know some great being that summons
[51:32] some great eternity somewhere that's you
[51:34] know high and lofty no that's not how
[51:36] god is
[51:37] god came down to where we are
[51:40] amen and he
[51:42] and and he identified himself in such a
[51:44] way amen that so he that sanctifieth and
[51:47] they who are sanctified are all of one
[51:49] who's been sanctified
[51:50] amen i've been sanctified by the blood
[51:52] of the lamb
[51:54] hallelujah so if you've been sanctified
[51:56] by the blood of the lamb he's actually
[51:57] saying no we're one
[51:59] and he's not ashamed to call you
[52:01] brethren he's not ashamed to call you
[52:02] family and that word brethren
[52:04] actually it means um
[52:07] actually speaks about a brother like
[52:09] natural family
[52:11] hallelujah
[52:12] so he's not actually ashamed to call you
[52:14] family
[52:16] amen remember we're not some distant
[52:18] cousin someplace remember we're his wife
[52:20] amen hallelujah so so we're the closest
[52:22] you can be as family is
[52:24] amen and
[52:26] hallelujah so
[52:27] you know
[52:28] why are you speaking about these things
[52:31] let's not be browbeaten
[52:34] the whole purpose of this world right
[52:36] now is you
[52:39] god's god's heart everything his
[52:41] affections everything is he cares for
[52:43] you
[52:45] amen
[52:48] hallelujah
[52:52] brotherhood says this in the unveiling
[52:54] of god
[52:55] because i was reading a story some years
[52:57] ago and in the story it said a great
[52:59] noble king i forget the name of him
[53:02] but
[53:02] uh just now i wasn't thinking about
[53:04] speaking of the story perhaps fiction
[53:06] but it leads us to a point that gives us
[53:09] a background on what we want to say this
[53:11] king he was such a noble king and had
[53:13] such a great and such a great lover of
[53:15] his subjects till one day before his
[53:18] guard and his royalty he said today you
[53:20] see me for your last time for many years
[53:23] and as gardeners noble said to him good
[53:25] king
[53:26] why do you say that are you going to a
[53:28] foreign country somewhere to become an
[53:30] alien
[53:31] he said no i'm staying right here well
[53:34] said i'm just going out amongst my
[53:36] subjects i'm going to become a peasant
[53:38] i'm going to cut wood with the wood
[53:40] chopper i'm going to till ground with
[53:42] the toilet i'm going to prune the vines
[53:44] with those who prune the vines i'm going
[53:46] to be one of them in order to get a
[53:48] better acquainted with what they're
[53:50] doing and i love them and i want to be
[53:53] more acquainted with them personally
[53:56] you know he's a king
[53:58] he doesn't go until ground he doesn't he
[54:00] doesn't work a garden he doesn't live as
[54:02] a peasant no he lives in a palace
[54:05] and there's always a separation between
[54:06] the people
[54:08] and the king he said no this is actually
[54:12] this king doesn't want to be this way
[54:13] they won't know me but yet i want to be
[54:16] acquainted with them in that way and the
[54:18] next morning when his delegates and all
[54:20] of his people seen him or the ones was
[54:22] in the palace take off his crown lay it
[54:24] down upon the seat the throne take his
[54:27] robe off and put on
[54:29] peasants clothes walk out amongst the
[54:31] common people now in that little story
[54:33] we find out then about god
[54:37] they said to the king king we we want
[54:39] you we love you we want you to remain
[54:41] king but he wanted to become one of them
[54:44] to know them better that they would know
[54:47] him better
[54:48] really what he was see really what he
[54:51] was
[54:52] see god is so misunderstood
[54:55] even even even you say down through the
[54:58] old testament
[54:59] you know the people got their mind by
[55:01] the time when jesus came they had in
[55:03] their mind what god was
[55:05] and the lord's basically saying no no
[55:06] you've got the wrong impression of me
[55:08] you've got the wrong impression of what
[55:10] the word really is
[55:11] so he came down in flesh
[55:13] to actually show them who he really was
[55:16] that they actually would not be
[55:17] misunderstood this is actually my heart
[55:20] how i heal the sickness is my care
[55:22] towards humanity i raise the debt i
[55:24] comfort those that have suffered loss
[55:26] you know i i you know restore sight to
[55:28] the blind
[55:29] i cast the devil out of lives you know
[55:31] this is actually who i am i'm not some
[55:34] mean angry god who just pours out
[55:36] judgment no i'm one of redemption i want
[55:39] of healing i mean i want a restoration
[55:42] isn't what the word and i think many
[55:44] times the message has been misunderstood
[55:48] through the ages the bible's been
[55:49] misunderstood yo god i say has been
[55:51] misunderstood they think he's three
[55:52] people up in heaven somewhere angry and
[55:54] you know this holy god that you just
[55:56] approached by ceremony you don't
[55:58] approach him by ceremony you approach
[56:00] him with a contrite surrendered heart
[56:02] hallelujah and he's not just somewhere
[56:04] far away i remember he's present upon
[56:06] there the spirit is here working
[56:09] you're following me it's the same thing
[56:10] with the message many people you know
[56:12] for years they have actually
[56:14] misunderstood the thrust of the message
[56:17] this message is a message of grace and
[56:20] that's not just turning a blind eye to
[56:21] sin no it actually gives you a power to
[56:24] overcome sin it changes your nature that
[56:26] you can't do it no more not because i
[56:28] better keep myself a certain way no he
[56:30] changes your nature i mean do you
[56:32] actually walk according to his word
[56:35] hallelujah
[56:36] have you this is what the well maybe
[56:39] maybe i just been living in a happy
[56:40] little bubble but just leave me my happy
[56:42] little bubble because i'm enjoying it
[56:43] just me and my lord jesus it's wonderful
[56:46] you know but this message is a message
[56:48] of restoration
[56:49] it's come to restore a people to their
[56:51] rightful position in christ
[56:54] hallelujah
[56:59] we know he is a god of judgment and
[57:01] wrath sure
[57:03] but it depends who you are in relation
[57:05] to the king
[57:06] when john was told in the book of
[57:08] revelation that the lamb of god
[57:11] you know
[57:11] he had prevailed
[57:13] and you know he was found worthy to take
[57:15] the book
[57:16] and then he looked and he saw i don't
[57:17] know the line of the tribe of judah had
[57:19] been found worthy to take the book and
[57:21] he turned and he saw a lamb
[57:23] it was the same person
[57:25] mean but but to some he's a lamb
[57:27] to the bride he's the sacrifice
[57:30] right he's their blood he's their high
[57:31] priest he's their offering he's their
[57:33] guide
[57:34] isn't he
[57:35] i mean to some he's that right
[57:38] amen but but a lion represents a judge a
[57:41] king
[57:42] cruel you know harsh to some people he
[57:44] will be that
[57:46] but it depends what you've given your
[57:47] life to if you've given your life to him
[57:49] now he's your lamb right if you accept
[57:51] the blood now he's your lamb i remember
[57:53] there'll come a day where you won't be
[57:54] able to accept the blood and then he'll
[57:55] be your lion he'll be your judge
[57:58] hallelujah so you know it all depends on
[58:00] on on your relationship with him
[58:02] but he wants to be our lamb
[58:05] amen
[58:09] amen
[58:10] see to display to them what he really
[58:12] was and that's what god did he changed
[58:14] himself from being jehovah god to become
[58:16] one of us that he might suffer he might
[58:18] taste death he might know what the sting
[58:20] of death was and take the penalty of

[1:01:01] lord he says lord you understand
[1:01:04] lord i know you understand
[1:01:07] and god came down because he said he
[1:01:09] said

[1:01:20] understand
[1:01:22] do you talk to the lord like that lord i
[1:01:24] know you understand
[1:01:26] and he wants you to say and and he wants
[1:01:28] to tell you i understand
[1:01:30] i understand what you're going through i
[1:01:32] understand hardship
[1:01:34] because i've walked in it
[1:01:36] hallelujah
[1:01:42] i'll just finish with these and then
[1:01:43] we'll
[1:01:44] then we'll go now notice
[1:01:46] all the glory that was in god is in his
[1:01:48] word
[1:01:49] all the blessings that's in god is in
[1:01:51] his word
[1:01:53] it's hid to the unbeliever by traditions
[1:01:56] but see what i mean but it's all in
[1:01:58] christ
[1:01:59] all that god was he emptied himself
[1:02:00] kenos and came into christ and we into
[1:02:04] christ are behind the veil
[1:02:07] so all the blessings all the glory
[1:02:09] that's in god is in his word
[1:02:11] amen and he reveals it to us doesn't he
[1:02:14] i mean this book i trust speaks to you
[1:02:15] like no other book
[1:02:17] you know during lockdown i read a book i
[1:02:19] read quite a few times during my
[1:02:21] childhood it was you know you know a
[1:02:22] novel
[1:02:23] and it was exactly as i remembered it
[1:02:25] there's nothing more to it but this
[1:02:28] oh this is totally different
[1:02:30] amen
[1:02:31] so all the glory that's in god is in his
[1:02:33] word
[1:02:34] right and then now he comes veiled into
[1:02:36] us so everything else in christ is in
[1:02:39] the bride now
[1:02:40] now he changed his amorphy he changed
[1:02:43] from what he was to what he is he never
[1:02:46] changes his nature but on the day of
[1:02:48] pentecost he changed himself from being
[1:02:50] the son of man to the son of god he came
[1:02:52] not with the people he came in the
[1:02:54] people see the same god to carry his
[1:02:56] ministry on through this great age
[1:03:01] no
[1:03:04] i want this one sorry
[1:03:08] he says now what has it done no this is
[1:03:11] from the feast of the trumpets as he
[1:03:12] said he came in like like flattery
[1:03:14] speaking of the antichrist sorry this is
[1:03:16] very jumpy around but but now what has
[1:03:18] he done he is bringing the protestant
[1:03:20] ecumenical council of the world council
[1:03:22] of churches the spirit of antichrist
[1:03:23] upon both them bringing them to the
[1:03:25] slaughter just like they did in the hour
[1:03:27] to call the bride how
[1:03:29] he loosed
[1:03:30] loosen the ecclesiastical church spirit
[1:03:32] loosed upon what not upon the
[1:03:34] denominations but upon the bride but
[1:03:36] here you'll get it the bride will not go
[1:03:37] through that time
[1:03:39] when you know when when everything shut
[1:03:41] down all those things he says the bride
[1:03:42] will not go through that time
[1:03:47] the bible says not the churchill but not
[1:03:49] the bride can't you see ministers can't
[1:03:51] you see that brethren you say the church
[1:03:52] has to go through the persecution for
[1:03:54] the for the perfection of it the blood
[1:03:56] of jesus christ reflects the bride i
[1:03:58] mean a man who chooses a wife don't put
[1:04:01] her through a bunch of punishment
[1:04:03] i mean he's already found grace too with
[1:04:06] her
[1:04:07] she has found grace with him
[1:04:09] who is this that leans upon the arm of
[1:04:11] of of her beloved coming out of the
[1:04:13] wilderness this is what she has found i
[1:04:15] mean we have found grace with him
[1:04:17] right we have found grace with our
[1:04:19] bridegroom he engages to her and if
[1:04:21] there is anything he'll keep her from
[1:04:24] every place to turn her hand his grace
[1:04:27] is so great upon them
[1:04:32] and so it will be upon the bride and so
[1:04:34] it is on the bride i mean we unworthy
[1:04:37] creatures deserving of hell but his
[1:04:38] grace holds us through it look at how
[1:04:40] many lost and blind how many how many
[1:04:43] sinners there was in the world the hour
[1:04:44] i got saved god saved me for a purpose
[1:04:47] and i'm determined by his will to do
[1:04:49] that purpose i don't care what anything
[1:04:51] else goes i want to do it
[1:04:53] amen but he says that the grace god's
[1:04:55] grace will be so great
[1:04:57] i mean upon her and so it is upon the
[1:04:59] bride
[1:05:00] amen his grace is so great upon us
[1:05:04] do you really i don't think we you know
[1:05:06] you know the thing is if you live in a
[1:05:08] certain atmosphere you just become
[1:05:10] acclimatized to it
[1:05:12] right just like us if we you know went
[1:05:14] from living at sea level then we climbed
[1:05:16] then we went and lived at a place of
[1:05:18] high altitude at first it would be a
[1:05:20] struggle
[1:05:21] you'd remember this is not how it is at
[1:05:22] sea level it's harder to breathe and
[1:05:24] it's you know the air's thinner a
[1:05:25] different kind of atmosphere you know
[1:05:27] but then you get used to it and it
[1:05:28] becomes normal
[1:05:29] amen and it's the same thing
[1:05:32] when you come into the things of god
[1:05:34] because you've been living in an
[1:05:35] atmosphere in the world
[1:05:37] i mean of unbelief and sin and demon
[1:05:39] powers moving and strife and anger and
[1:05:41] all those different things but then the
[1:05:43] lord calls you
[1:05:44] and he brings you out of that atmosphere
[1:05:46] he brings you into a heavenly atmosphere
[1:05:49] and it's just such a glorious place to
[1:05:51] live
[1:05:52] amen but then we're acclimatized to it
[1:05:56] we get used to it
[1:05:58] we should never get used to
[1:06:00] living in his grace we should never get
[1:06:02] used to living in his presence
[1:06:05] amen because
[1:06:06] not everyone has this and i'm just
[1:06:08] talking about every man woman and child
[1:06:10] around the world
[1:06:12] you know
[1:06:13] not everyone lives in his presence
[1:06:16] like we do
[1:06:17] if you really know
[1:06:20] so we talk about the grace of god is so
[1:06:22] great upon us
[1:06:24] we shouldn't take that for granted amen
[1:06:26] amen we should be so thankful and uh you
[1:06:28] know i'm not saying you're not but we
[1:06:30] should never take for granted that the
[1:06:32] lord has just got his hands on us
[1:06:34] and he's guiding us through
[1:06:36] hallelujah you know
[1:06:38] it's just like you just think of peter
[1:06:40] james and john there are many other
[1:06:41] fishermen they weren't the only
[1:06:43] fishermen on the seas of galilee but god
[1:06:45] called them there are many other tax
[1:06:47] collectors where matthew was there but
[1:06:48] god called him there are many other
[1:06:50] women that went to the well of samaria
[1:06:51] but god called one
[1:06:53] hallelujah
[1:06:55] there are many other pharisees but god
[1:06:57] called paul
[1:06:59] amen there are many other people like
[1:07:00] you but god called you
[1:07:02] why because he was looking beyond the
[1:07:04] skin he's looking beyond our intellect
[1:07:06] or maybe our culture maybe our
[1:07:08] personality he wasn't looking at those
[1:07:10] things he was looking at a predestinated
[1:07:13] cd on the inside of you amen and he
[1:07:15] called you because he saw that was in
[1:07:17] you i mean and that's why he called you
[1:07:19] we must never ever take that for granted
[1:07:22] that before the foundation of the world
[1:07:23] god put a seed on the inside of you and
[1:07:26] when he did that the lamb was slammed
[1:07:28] before the foundation of the world that
[1:07:30] god had already paved the way i mean
[1:07:32] that that god had already purchased our
[1:07:34] salvation right he'd already purchased
[1:07:36] our healing he already given us power to
[1:07:38] conquer every devil he'd given us the
[1:07:40] strength to overcome every circumstance
[1:07:42] i mean it was already purchased before
[1:07:44] the foundation of the world hallelujah
[1:07:47] and now we are just walking through life
[1:07:51] hallelujah
[1:07:53] and if we've walked so far
[1:07:55] do you not think we'll walk all the way
[1:07:58] amen do you not think we'll just be able
[1:08:00] to continue on
[1:08:01] i mean that's why i was thinking you
[1:08:02] know let's just
[1:08:05] don't worry about the past
[1:08:08] don't worry about what you see yourself
[1:08:10] to be
[1:08:12] you know they looked at jesus
[1:08:15] riding into jerusalem who is this
[1:08:18] they're looking at the outward
[1:08:20] and many times we just look at the
[1:08:21] outward and this is going on this is
[1:08:23] going on this yo
[1:08:25] things we wrestle with
[1:08:27] just leave it yes
[1:08:30] you know
[1:08:31] many times we go around the mountain and
[1:08:33] fight the same demon
[1:08:35] because we don't recognize he's been
[1:08:37] conquered
[1:08:40] right the same thing can come up but
[1:08:41] you've got to recognize that at calvary
[1:08:43] that thing was defeated
[1:08:45] and you've just got to bypass him and
[1:08:46] keep walking on
[1:08:48] recognize he's defeated
[1:08:50] right but if he keeps coming back at you
[1:08:53] and you got to pick up the sword and
[1:08:54] fight him again and you know
[1:08:56] and then he'll just come back again you
[1:08:57] got to recognize he's conquered
[1:09:00] you gotta you know isn't that right yes
[1:09:02] so we need to recognize the devil's been
[1:09:04] defeated he's nothing but a bluff
[1:09:07] he's like a bunch of troops go stepping
[1:09:09] down you know you know through the red
[1:09:10] square moscow with all fake weapons
[1:09:14] but if we think he's armed and dangerous
[1:09:17] then we'll just be living in fear
[1:09:22] this may be very chopped up this morning
[1:09:24] but
[1:09:26] take that scripture in song of solomon
[1:09:28] who is this
[1:09:29] that leans on the arm of her beloved
[1:09:31] coming out of the wilderness you say who
[1:09:33] am i
[1:09:36] as adam said to eve your bone of my bone
[1:09:38] flesh of my flesh life of my life

[1:09:42] bone of his bone spirit of his spirit
[1:09:44] power of power she is him

[1:09:50] purpose

[1:10:08] teeth

[1:10:12] have you ever just found yourself in a
[1:10:14] circumstance say how did i get here

[1:10:20] things been happening and you just
[1:10:22] happen to find yourself there
[1:10:24] who's found themselves
[1:10:26] in that kind of circumstance you know
