[4:51] [Music]
[6:16] God bless you all this morning. Good to
[6:19] see you all.
[6:21] It's good to be here
[6:24] and have an opportunity this morning to
[6:26] worship the Lord, to meet with him and
[6:28] to be refreshed
[6:30] and renewed by his presence.
[6:35] And today is also um Father's Day.
[6:39] Two things I want to say about that. I
[6:40] always loved my father. There was never
[6:42] a time in my life where I didn't love my
[6:44] father where I I've never never never
[6:46] run him down. I never ever never really
[6:49] dishonored him
[6:51] willingly. Maybe when I was a kid or
[6:53] teenage years. No, even then I never
[6:55] did. Always loved my father. And it's a
[6:58] good for a person to love their father.
[7:01] And um
[7:05] it's a very powerful concept because
[7:06] it's the only it's the first the Bible
[7:09] calls it the first commandment with
[7:11] promise is if we honor our father and
[7:13] mother
[7:15] then our days will be long upon the
[7:16] earth.
[7:18] And it it has to be that way because the
[7:20] natural always has to type the
[7:21] spiritual. There's always got to be
[7:23] there's got to be a picture painted you
[7:25] know. And in the natural we honor our
[7:28] natural father, natural mother, our
[7:30] parents. then we get a a long life here.
[7:32] And in the spiritual, if we honor our
[7:34] heaven spiritual heavenly father, then
[7:36] we get a long life, very very long life,
[7:39] eternity.
[7:41] And that it it just has to work that
[7:42] way. So let's um stand this morning
[7:46] and just approach our heavenly fathers
[7:48] this morning.
[7:50] Lord, we thank you for our natural
[7:52] fathers, Lord, that some are this way,
[7:54] some are that way, some we know, some we
[7:56] don't,
[7:58] Lord, and and we we get this what's
[8:00] called the grab bag of life where where
[8:03] we just get a different lot each one,
[8:05] Lord. But we thank you, Lord, that we
[8:08] can all have the same heavenly father,
[8:10] Lord, that there's a great spiritual
[8:12] heavenly father that loves us and that
[8:15] cares for us and that but treats us like
[8:17] sons and daughters. Lord, you you
[8:20] encourage us when we go the right way
[8:22] and you discourage us when we go the
[8:23] wrong way, Lord, because you have a you
[8:25] have such a fatherly love for us, Lord,
[8:28] and you care for us. And we read in your
[8:31] word, Lord, that you call us the apple
[8:34] of your eye, Lord. And we often
[8:36] experience that ourselves with our own
[8:37] children. We if they're in the
[8:39] playground playing or if they're
[8:40] somewhere, we always seem to look at our
[8:41] own ones. We know what they're up to,
[8:43] what they're doing cuz they they attract
[8:45] us, Lord. Lord, and we know that
[8:46] wherever we are, your eyes is always
[8:48] upon us, Lord, that you're looking upon
[8:49] us cuz we attract you, Lord, because we
[8:51] are your sons and daughters. So, we just
[8:52] come this morning, Lord, to worship and
[8:54] to praise you. May you just bless us,
[8:56] Lord. May you minister to us in a
[8:58] powerful way. Bless Brother Ben as he
[9:00] brings your word, Lord. May he just step
[9:01] aside and let you speak through him as
[9:03] we always experience that he does, Lord.
[9:05] So, we thank you for that. We thank you
[9:06] for the anointing that he has in his
[9:07] life, Lord, to minister and to be a
[9:09] pastor. We just pray a blessing upon him
[9:11] and his family, Lord. just just bless us
[9:13] this morning, Lord, as we enter into
[9:14] your your courts with praise and
[9:17] thanksgiving in Jesus wonderful name.

[37:48] we just let him change our lives this
[37:50] morning. Hallelujah. Amen. Praise God.
[37:53] Thank you. Musicians. Amen. Praise the
[37:55] Lord. I believe he's present among us.
[37:57] Don't you? Amen. His word said, "Where
[37:59] two or three gathered in my name, there
[38:00] I am in the midst." So, why don't we as
[38:02] we worship the Lord this morning, just
[38:04] express yourself as you just imagine you
[38:06] had a had a one-on-one audience with the
[38:08] Lord Jesus. What would you tell him?
[38:11] What would you express? I tell you what,
[38:13] you can have that this morning. Have a
[38:15] one-on-one conference with our God. I
[38:18] mean, he's not here to tell you where
[38:19] you've gone wrong. He's tell you where
[38:20] you've gone right, what he's done for
[38:22] you, and everything he's done. Amen. So,
[38:24] why don't you just have that one-on-one
[38:25] conference with God, amen, this morning.
[38:27] I mean, he's not ashamed of you. He's
[38:28] proud of you. He's pleased with you.
[38:30] He's our father. Amen. Happy Father's
[38:32] Day, Fathers. Amen. Praise the Lord. So
[38:35] all those wrong turns you would undo and
[38:37] all those things, he took those to
[38:38] Calvary. Regrets and shame and guilt, he
[38:41] took it all away. So why carry it? Amen.
[38:43] Why Why let it rule you? Amen. Why don't
[38:45] you let his faith rule you and let's
[38:46] praise God today.
[38:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. Amen. It's great
[38:50] to have everyone here today. Amen. Great

[39:12] Amen. Let's just gather around the fire
[39:14] and have a good time.
[39:15] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. So, let's um
[39:17] let's go to um let's go to Mark chapter
[39:20] 2. Um and and also we have a brother
[39:23] somewhere from Shakina Glory Tabernacle.
[39:25] Oh, him. Hi. Hi, bro. That's Arman by
[39:29] the way. Amen. Great to have you here.
[39:33] Amen. Praise the Lord. So, so are we
[39:35] here? Can we drive this? Yes. So, so
[39:36] Mark, I just got to rearrange this a
[39:38] bit. Let's just kind of go here a bit.
[39:40] Okay. So, Mark chapter 2.
[39:44] Amen. You know, they call uh the book of
[39:46] Mark is, you know, the you the works
[39:49] book as in the fa you the ox anointing,
[39:52] you know, what the Lord did. I call it
[39:54] the faith book. It's faith in action.
[39:57] And we're going to read this. I know I I
[39:58] I read this a few uh services ago,
[40:00] whenever that was the other day. Um but
[40:03] I just want to go into this a bit more
[40:04] because I really enjoy this story
[40:06] phenomenally. So I pray this will be a
[40:08] real blessing. Amen. So Mark 2:3-12 says
[40:11] here, "And they came unto him bringing
[40:13] one sick of Pauly which was born of
[40:15] four. And when they could not come nigh
[40:17] unto him for the press, they uncovered
[40:19] the roof where he was. And when they had
[40:22] broken it up, they let down the bed uh
[40:24] wherein the sick of Pauly lay. When
[40:26] Jesus saw their faith, he said unto the
[40:29] sick of the Pauly, "Son, thy sins be
[40:31] forgiven thee." But there were certain
[40:33] of the scribes sitting there and reason
[40:35] and and reasoning in their hearts, "Why
[40:38] do this man thus speak blas blasphemies?
[40:41] Who can forgive sins but God only?" And
[40:44] immediately when Jesus perceived in his
[40:45] spirit that they so reason within
[40:47] themselves, he said unto them, "Why
[40:49] reason ye these things in your hearts?
[40:51] Whether it is easy to say to the sick of
[40:53] Pauly, "Thy sins be forgiven thee." Or
[40:55] say, "Arise, take up thy bed and walk."
[40:57] But that ye may know that the son of man
[40:59] hath power on earth to forgive sins, he
[41:01] saith to the sick of the pulsey, I say
[41:03] unto thee, arise, take up thy bed, and
[41:05] go thy way into thine house. And
[41:07] immediately he arose, took up the bed,
[41:09] went forth before them all, and so much
[41:12] they all amazed and glorified God,
[41:14] saying, We never saw it on this fashion.
[41:18] &gt;&gt; Amen. And then we're just going to go to
[41:19] uh Hebrews chap 11
[41:22] and we're going to read just just a few
[41:24] verses. Hebrews 11 and 32-35.
[41:37] Amen. Just say amen when you're when
[41:39] you're there or you're scrolled there or
[41:41] whatever you've done to get there. Just
[41:42] say amen when you're there.
[41:45] Amen. In Hebrews 11 and and uh 32-35
[41:48] says, "And what shall I more say? For
[41:50] the time shall fail me to tell of
[41:52] Gideon, of Barack, of Samson, of
[41:54] Jeffany, of David, also in Samuel, and
[41:57] of the prophets, who through faith
[41:59] subdue kingdoms, wrought righteousness,
[42:01] obtained promises, stopped the mouths of
[42:03] lions, quenched the violence of fire,
[42:05] escaped the edge of the sword, out of
[42:07] weakness were made strong, waxed valiant
[42:10] in the fight, turned to flight the
[42:11] armies of the aliens. women received
[42:13] their dead to life again and others were
[42:15] tortured not accepting deliverance that
[42:17] they might obtain a better salvation.
[42:20] Amen. So let's pray this morning. If you
[42:21] have a need, you just want to slip your
[42:22] hand up to the Lord. Say, "Lord, I just
[42:25] want time with you this morning." Amen.
[42:28] Gracious Father, we're so thankful we
[42:30] can let you change our lives. And Lord,
[42:32] I I'm standing in front of a room full
[42:34] of people, Lord, that have done that,
[42:36] Lord. And you've transformed them, Lord.
[42:37] You have taken us from glory to glory.
[42:40] the person we were, we aren't anymore
[42:42] because of your great grace, Lord. The
[42:43] power of your blood. And I pray, Father,
[42:45] this morning as we come before you,
[42:47] Lord, as a people. I pray you would
[42:48] anoint every soul, Lord. Touch every
[42:50] life, Father. Touch every spirit, dear
[42:53] God. All that we are, our bodies that
[42:54] are sick, Father, our spirits are sick,
[42:56] dear God. I pray you'd touch each one,
[42:58] Lord Jesus. Lord, may may there be
[43:00] another move of your spirit as we sung,
[43:02] dear God. A reawakening, a rekindling of
[43:04] a flame, Father. May you grant it.
[43:06] Anoint your word to um our lives. And
[43:09] may you have preeminence in our lives.
[43:11] And father, we also always want to
[43:12] remember those who couldn't be here
[43:13] today. Be there a great portion, Father.
[43:16] And Lord, I just want to commit our
[43:17] lives into your hands. Take control,
[43:18] Lord. We just want to step out of the
[43:19] way that you can have your way. Grant
[43:22] it, dear God. Meet every need, Lord. You
[43:23] see the need behind every hand that's
[43:25] raised. We commit them all to your to
[43:27] you in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. Amen.
[43:30] God bless you, friends. You can have
[43:31] your seats this morning. So, I want to
[43:33] talk about if I could have a bit of a
[43:34] title this morning. I want to talk about
[43:36] your faith. And if a subtitle I say put
[43:38] it put it in action.
[43:40] &gt;&gt; Faith is not a passive thing. It's not a
[43:43] stagnant thing. It's not a stillframe
[43:45] thing. Faith is alive. It moves. It
[43:49] grows. It quickens. As we read there in
[43:52] uh Hebrews chapter 11, you know, through
[43:54] faith they subdue kingdoms. They wrought
[43:56] righteousness, obtain promises, stop the
[43:58] mouths of lions. So faith is a very
[44:00] active thing. Amen. It's not stagnant.
[44:02] Amen. It moves. Amen. And I tell you
[44:04] what, where if you let the faith of God
[44:06] control your life, I mean, you're going
[44:08] to go into action. Amen. You're going to
[44:09] do things. You're not going to sit there
[44:11] stagnant and maybe wondering and hoping
[44:13] and praying that, you know, because I
[44:15] think a lot of times we pray for needs,
[44:17] but really it shouldn't just be, "Lord,
[44:19] help us." It should be, "Lord, show us
[44:22] how to put our faith into action.
[44:24] &gt;&gt; Guide us, Lord. Channel our faith. Show
[44:26] us how to approach every problem." Amen.
[44:28] Because faith is alive. Amen. You see
[44:30] these men, they would um Sorry, did I
[44:32] have it there? Um, you know, you see
[44:34] these men. This is uh it's been cut out,
[44:36] but this is the picture of uh you your
[44:38] the man being lowered into the
[44:39] presence of Jesus through the roof. Now,
[44:42] as I've said a while ago, I just want to
[44:44] just just bring it back home again, you
[44:46] know, but you know, the scripture says
[44:47] when Jesus saw their faith, it wasn't
[44:50] the man's faith that had
[44:52] anything to do with it. It was the faith
[44:53] of the four friends. And many times we
[44:57] we for some reason we look at the
[44:58] circumstances. We look at the state of
[45:00] someone. We look at what they're going
[45:02] through. We look at their attitude
[45:03] towards the Lord. And we kind of let
[45:05] that kind of dictate our faith being put
[45:07] into action. It's got nothing to do with
[45:10] the other person.
[45:12] &gt;&gt; Amen. That man's faith, it
[45:13] doesn't even say if he believed or not.
[45:15] It was the faith of the four friends.
[45:17] One brought him healing, but two brought
[45:19] him forgiveness of sins. Amen. So it was
[45:21] a powerful their faith was powerful. All
[45:24] they needed to do was get him to have a
[45:26] conference with God and God would do the
[45:28] rest. And I believe the same faith of
[45:30] those four friends, friends, is in you.
[45:33] Amen. That faith that brought the
[45:34] crippled man there is in you. Cuz many
[45:36] times we think of people, we think, "How
[45:38] on earth God could you ever touch them?
[45:40] They're not in a right frame of mind.
[45:41] They're not even in faith. They're in
[45:42] unbelief." And I tell you what, friends,
[45:44] what was before unbelief was faith. What
[45:47] was before sin? A savior. What was
[45:49] before sickness? A healer. Amen. What
[45:51] was before anyone being lost was a
[45:54] deliverer, was a savior, was a keeper,
[45:56] was a healer, was God. Amen. So before a
[45:58] spirit of unbelief ever came by, you
[46:00] know, out of Satan a perversion, right?
[46:02] There was faith. And faith is more
[46:04] powerful than unbelief. Amen. Faith
[46:06] drives unbelief away. Amen. Faith causes
[46:10] God's promises to be manifested. Faith
[46:12] subdues sin. Amen. Faith Faith has got
[46:16] muscles. Amen. It's not a weak thing.
[46:17] It's not some little pansy kind of a emo
[46:20] kind of a guy. No, faith is rugged. I
[46:22] mean, faith has got hair on its chest.
[46:24] It's got muscles. Amen. Faith is not
[46:26] afraid of nothing. I mean, it it it it
[46:29] doesn't be intimidated. Faith cannot be
[46:30] intimidated. Faith cannot pull back. I
[46:33] know faith goes forward. Amen. It's
[46:35] time, I believe, to take the word of God
[46:36] and go forward in faith. Amen. To take
[46:39] God at his word and not look at the
[46:40] trouble, not look at the circumstances.
[46:43] Amen. They did not see problems. They
[46:44] just saw a solution. Amen. The solution
[46:46] was unorthodox, but they got there.
[46:48] Amen. And I think it should be the same
[46:50] way with you and I. We should become
[46:52] very unorthodox in our approach
[46:55] &gt;&gt; because the devil knows how certain
[46:56] things should be and he always says well
[46:58] if it runs according to certain
[47:00] parameters then the outcome's going to
[47:01] happen. Example Goliath challenged uh
[47:04] Israel for a champion.
[47:06] &gt;&gt; He got a shepherd boy. God answered in
[47:08] an unorthodox way according to Goliath's
[47:11] idea of a fight. And Goliath had his
[47:13] shield was armor bearer guy. I think
[47:15] what a loser of a guy, you know,
[47:17] carrying a shield for a dead beat.
[47:19] Anyway, but then you know, Goliath had
[47:21] his spear. Then then then here comes a
[47:23] guy who's not armored like him, doesn't
[47:25] fight like him. His fighting stance is
[47:27] different. His approach to battle is
[47:29] different. It was completely unorthodox
[47:32] to what Goliath thought that a battle
[47:34] should happen, you know, a one-on-one
[47:36] combat cuz God works in an unorthodox
[47:39] way, but yet it's according to his word.
[47:41] Amen. So, so David came and and also as
[47:43] a slinger, he was very unorthodox
[47:45] because you think a slinger, he's got a
[47:46] missile weapon. He wants to have a
[47:48] distance between him and his opponent,
[47:50] especially a guy with a spear. But what
[47:51] does he do? He runs towards Goliath.
[47:54] &gt;&gt; It was completely unorthodox. You know,
[47:56] Goliath, no doubt, when he saw David,
[47:58] he's asking questions. How he saw him
[48:00] fight, he was asking questions. And then
[48:02] the last thing he died with was, "How on
[48:03] earth did this happen?"
[48:05] &gt;&gt; Why? Because David came in an unorthodox
[48:08] way, but yet according to the word. And
[48:10] the reason he stood according to the
[48:11] word, he said, "Because this guy's an
[48:13] uncircumcised Philistine, I've got a
[48:15] covenant with God. He's on my ground
[48:17] because that battle was in Judah, which
[48:19] was in David's inheritance." And so when
[48:21] the enemy came into David's ground, that
[48:23] enemy had to go, right? But you see,
[48:25] Saul and his army were fighting an
[48:26] orthodox way according to what Goliath
[48:29] was dictating. Why should we ever fight
[48:31] things according to what the devil puts
[48:33] upon us? I mean, we your family try and
[48:36] push and they, you know, fuss and
[48:37] there's fighting. Why should we respond
[48:39] in kind? Why should we agree? Why should
[48:41] we become like the atmosphere of
[48:43] unbelief? Why can we not live in an
[48:45] atmosphere of faith and push back a
[48:47] fussing, fighting, quarreling spirit?
[48:49] Why cannot we we do it in love? Amen.
[48:51] That's putting faith into action. Who's
[48:53] with me this morning? Amen. We don't
[48:55] ever want to just sit back in a corner
[48:57] and say, "Well, we're just some passive
[48:58] little little thing and we're just this
[49:00] helpless damsel in distress." I tell you
[49:02] what, friends, you're not a damsel in
[49:03] distress. Amen. No. Why? Cuz you got the
[49:05] King of Glory in you. Amen. He's come to
[49:07] take over your battle. Amen. You've got
[49:09] the full armor of God. You're not you're
[49:11] not there just just weakless. You you're
[49:13] not defenseless. You don't have any
[49:15] weapons. You've got the mightiest
[49:16] weapon. I mean, you got the best armor,
[49:18] the best equipment that any soldier
[49:20] could ever have is what you carry.
[49:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. So now we need to put our and and
[49:25] I'm not saying you don't do this, but I
[49:26] think friends, if if there's a day to
[49:28] put faith into action, it's today.
[49:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's not let's not just sit back
[49:34] and you know even even the apostle Paul
[49:36] would say now I'm crucified with Christ
[49:38] nevertheless I live yet not I but Christ
[49:41] liveth in me and the life which I now
[49:43] live in the flesh I live by the faith of
[49:44] the son of God who loved me and gave
[49:47] himself for me. His life was dynamic.
[49:50] Amen. The faith that he had you know
[49:52] brought revelation
[49:55] healed people cast out devils. Amen.
[49:58] Established people in the faith caused
[49:59] people to receive the Holy Ghost. Amen.
[50:01] cause cause deliverance to take place.
[50:04] He was led by that faith. Amen. His life
[50:06] was not stagnant. It was not still
[50:08] frame. It wasn't just a plateau of a
[50:09] walk. No, he says, "Let's press to the
[50:11] mark of the high calling in Christ." I
[50:13] mean, let's apprehend that which has
[50:14] apprehended me. Amen. See, it was not a
[50:17] stagnant thing cuz faith is cannot
[50:18] stagnant. It cannot be still. It must
[50:21] grow. It must expand. Amen. And this
[50:23] word, this message to me, to me, you can
[50:25] see it's the word of God based on one
[50:27] thing. Denominations have gone down in
[50:29] depth of revelation. It's just become a
[50:31] social gospel and just casual and mind
[50:34] over matter kind of stuff. And you can
[50:36] tell that's why it's not the the word.
[50:38] But the word expands, it grows. It gets
[50:40] deeper. Amen. As the apostle Paul would
[50:42] say that you'd know the height and the
[50:44] depth and the breadth of the love of
[50:45] God. I mean, you know the full extent of
[50:47] the magnitude of his grace and his
[50:49] power. I mean, not just some plateau
[50:51] stagnant thing become a very deep, rich
[50:53] alive. I trust that's your experience
[50:55] today. I mean, where the word has got
[50:57] better, it's got richer, it's got
[50:58] greater. Why? Because faith grows. Amen.
[51:00] It doesn't sit still. It doesn't become
[51:02] No, it fully grows. And we live in a day
[51:05] where faith cannot plateau. Why? Cuz the
[51:08] Because the son of man has been
[51:09] revealed. Christ has been fully
[51:11] manifested in this day. So faith cannot
[51:13] plateau. Amen. You can never get to a
[51:16] point where you think you know it all.
[51:17] It's been all revealed to you. You can
[51:19] never get to that point. If you've got
[51:20] to that point, you realize one thing.
[51:22] You're at a dead end
[51:24] &gt;&gt; of a wrong destination. Amen. Cuz
[51:27] there's always more. There's always more
[51:28] to experience. There's always more to be
[51:30] real. Amen. You say, "Well, I've read
[51:32] the Bible." Read it again.
[51:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. Read it again. Well, you say,
[51:35] "I've heard that message before." Listen
[51:37] to it again. You'll get something new.
[51:39] Amen. God, because in his season, God
[51:41] will minister certain parts of it that
[51:43] you didn't need in a previous season.
[51:45] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, faith does not does not
[51:48] stagnate.
[51:50] &gt;&gt; Amen. And faith is an individual affair.
[51:52] &gt;&gt; It's not a group thing. We're not we're
[51:55] not going to heaven because we're in a
[51:56] group or we come to Shikina Tabernacle
[51:58] or any other message church around the
[52:00] world. We don't go to heaven because
[52:02] we're part of the grouping. No, it's in
[52:04] it's an individual walk. It's you and
[52:06] God. I mean, God wants to walk with you.
[52:08] He wants to talk with you. He wants to
[52:10] reveal himself to you. He wants to know
[52:11] what's on your heart. He wants you to
[52:13] express yourself back to him, not as a
[52:16] group, as an individual. I mean, so
[52:18] faith is individual. So, it's not based
[52:20] on what anyone else is doing. These
[52:23] guys,
[52:24] these guys weren't interested in what
[52:26] the crowd was doing. They did not let
[52:28] their faith be dictated to by the mob.
[52:32] &gt;&gt; Oh, there's, you know, there, you know,
[52:33] we can't get in because of the press.
[52:35] They didn't say, "Well, I guess our
[52:36] faith has got to be according to the
[52:37] press of the people." No, their faith
[52:39] was according to we must get our friend
[52:41] to the Lord.
[52:43] &gt;&gt; Amen. And so faith is an individual
[52:45] thing. That's why we can't stand on
[52:47] mommy's faith, daddy's faith, uncle's
[52:48] faith, brother's faith, pastor's faith.
[52:50] You can't stand by someone else's faith.
[52:53] It's your faith. What's being revealed
[52:55] to you, what is real to you. And I say
[52:57] we should be with a great depth of
[52:59] sincerity. Lord, make my faith alive.
[53:02] Amen. Don't let it be stagnant. Don't
[53:04] let it don't let my senses become numb
[53:06] where I'm so blinded by the things of
[53:08] the world that my faith has been become
[53:10] uh disabled because brother Ram says
[53:13] either the glamour of the world will
[53:14] paralyze your faith or your faith will
[53:17] paralyze the world. And I think we
[53:19] should give this world a big paralysis.
[53:21] Amen. It should be in a coma. Amen.
[53:23] Around us because our faith so paralyzes
[53:25] it. Amen. That what? That it's it
[53:28] doesn't paralyze our faith.
[53:30] &gt;&gt; It's a constant battle. But greater is
[53:32] you that's in the world.
[53:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. We don't need Oh, the world's so
[53:35] bad and dark and scary. No. The light is
[53:38] so bright. Amen. Christ is so present.
[53:41] Amen. This word is so alive. We don't
[53:43] need to be afraid to go anywhere.
[53:45] &gt;&gt; Amen. Doesn't matter where he leads us.
[53:47] If he's leading us, it's okay because
[53:50] he's present. Amen.
[53:52] &gt;&gt; He won't lead you up a creek without a
[53:54] paddle. No, he will prove himself. You
[53:56] just keep walking with him.
[53:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. So faith is an individual thing.
[54:01] The Apostle Paul was not worried about
[54:03] what the others were doing. He was
[54:05] walking by the revelation of the son of
[54:06] God. Amen. It's got to be the same thing
[54:09] with us. It's got to be an individual
[54:11] walk. Oh, but the church is doing this
[54:13] or not doing this. Who cares what the
[54:15] church is doing? Oh, my parents are
[54:17] doing this. Who cares about them? What
[54:18] are you doing?
[54:20] &gt;&gt; What is your faith doing? What are you
[54:21] doing with the word that's been given
[54:23] into your hand? Amen. You say, "Well, if
[54:25] brother so and so does it, I'll do it."
[54:26] Who cares about that person? Why are we
[54:28] waiting for others to step into the
[54:30] battlefront when God wants you to step
[54:32] into the battlefront? I mean, God wants
[54:33] you to pray and intercede and be a
[54:36] witness. He's not waiting for me. He's
[54:38] waiting for you.
[54:39] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[54:39] &gt;&gt; In your walk, I'm talking about, right?
[54:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. Cuz the sons of God are led by the
[54:44] spirit of God. Amen. And he'll always
[54:46] lead us into a greater walk with him
[54:49] into the reality of his word. He will
[54:50] never lead us out of his word.
[54:53] &gt;&gt; Amen. So why, you know, we must not just
[54:56] sit back and wait for the crowd to do
[54:58] something.
[54:59] &gt;&gt; God wants you.
[55:01] &gt;&gt; He wants to inspire your life. Amen.
[55:03] When the Lord found me in Christ Church
[55:05] as a drunk university student, I just
[55:07] had such a faith everyone's going to
[55:08] believe this cuz I met him or he found
[55:10] me. Amen. I didn't wait for I didn't had
[55:13] to go ask someone about what to do. I
[55:15] had a burden.
[55:17] &gt;&gt; I had a burden. Everyone must know this
[55:19] Jesus. Let my Jesus change your life.
[55:22] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Did I have a lot of wisdom?
[55:24] Probably not. But I knew he was alive.
[55:26] Amen. I knew God would direct my steps.
[55:28] Amen. But I didn't wait till I started
[55:29] to go to the message church there,
[55:30] Brother Greg. So I didn't say, "Brother
[55:31] Greg, what should I do now?" I had a
[55:34] burden.
[55:35] &gt;&gt; And that's the thing is if someone gets
[55:36] the Holy Ghost, they get a burden for
[55:38] souls. I mean, they get a care for the
[55:40] love, you know, for the church. They get
[55:42] a care for their friends and things.
[55:43] They don't they're not just passive or
[55:45] someone else. No, faith becomes active.
[55:47] Faith becomes alive and faith wants to
[55:49] make contact with someone else that they
[55:50] can meet the same God.
[55:53] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's why we need a fire. Amen.
[55:54] We don't need a bit of bunch of useless
[55:56] New Zealand spirit floppy nonsense, you
[55:59] know, just floating along. Forget that
[56:01] thing.
[56:02] &gt;&gt; Hey, I'm a Kiwi, so I can say it. And if
[56:03] you're not a Kiwi, say it anyway.
[56:06] We're not part of this country in that
[56:08] way.
[56:08] &gt;&gt; Oh, she'll be right.
[56:10] &gt;&gt; Hold on.
[56:13] Faith
[56:15] gives absolute power.
[56:18] &gt;&gt; Excuses are just excuses.
[56:21] &gt;&gt; Amen. These guys had excuses why they
[56:23] could have just quit up and said it was
[56:24] too hard to get him there.
[56:26] &gt;&gt; If it was just a human intellectual
[56:28] faith, they would have given up. But
[56:30] their faith, real faith does not take no
[56:32] for an answer
[56:34] &gt;&gt; for an obstacle. It doesn't quit. Faith
[56:37] is prevailing. Faith makes you
[56:39] perseverant. Faith gives you a
[56:41] determination. Faith gives you such a
[56:43] grit that you won't quit. You can't.
[56:44] Amen. You may humanly you may say,
[56:46] "What's the point?" But there's
[56:47] something greater in you driving you.
[56:49] Who's ever had a burden where you
[56:50] humanly you don't want to do it, but
[56:51] there's something just it just grates at
[56:53] you. You've got to do it. Who's ever?
[56:55] Now, that's a burden. It's not a nice
[56:56] idea. It's a burden that you got to that
[56:58] something drives you to get you out of
[56:59] your comfort zone. You've got to do it.
[57:01] And
[57:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. Are we all here today?
[57:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. This is this is what faith does.
[57:08] Faith is not a
[57:11] &gt;&gt; Faith is rugged.
[57:12] &gt;&gt; You say, "Well, I'm a sister." You can
[57:13] have rugged faith. I mean, there's a lot
[57:15] of women in the Bibles were heroes of
[57:17] faith. When the men didn't do it, the
[57:18] sisters stood up and did the job.
[57:21] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I mean, you can take the
[57:23] same thing with Peter in the prison. And
[57:24] I don't have it here in my notes, but he
[57:25] was asleep. He was asleep. He was
[57:28] condemned to die the next morning. He
[57:29] fell asleep, but they had a prayer
[57:32] meeting
[57:33] &gt;&gt; and and you know that, you know, they
[57:34] had a prayer meeting because their faith
[57:36] said, "Lord, we're going to intercede
[57:38] for our brother."
[57:39] &gt;&gt; Amen. We believe he's still got a job to
[57:41] do, Lord.
[57:42] &gt;&gt; Peter was asleep. Who who took the angel
[57:45] into his prison? It wasn't Peter.
[57:48] &gt;&gt; It was the believers praying for him.
[57:52] &gt;&gt; Amen. That same faith is in you.
[57:55] &gt;&gt; Oh, we can't do that kind of thing.
[57:57] Yeah, you can because God is writing
[57:59] another book of Acts or a continuation
[58:01] of the book of Acts. And that book of
[58:03] Acts is being written here
[58:05] &gt;&gt; in the believers around the world, the
[58:06] book of Acts is being written. That's
[58:08] why we have testimony after testimony.
[58:10] It's a book of Acts.
[58:11] &gt;&gt; I mean, and even your everyday life
[58:13] overcoming for God, raising your
[58:15] children, providing and all those
[58:16] things, that's the book of Acts being
[58:18] written
[58:18] &gt;&gt; because we live a supernatural life.
[58:21] &gt;&gt; Amen. Brother Bram said, "We look at the
[58:23] martyrs and we think, how on earth could
[58:25] we ever stand and be a martyr like they
[58:27] did in the dark ages?" But he said, "We
[58:28] fail to recognize the same faith that
[58:32] they had is the same faith we have and
[58:34] daily overcome in this world."
[58:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:40] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[58:42] &gt;&gt; Faith works.
[58:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:45] Praise the Lord.
[58:48] So, it's an individual thing.
[58:52] Moses's parents were not waiting for
[58:54] anyone else to decide to hide babies.
[58:57] They believe that the time had come that
[59:00] the prophecy of Abraham was going to be
[59:01] fulfilled.
[59:03] &gt;&gt; They knew it was the season where a
[59:05] deliverer was going to come and they
[59:06] were going to be carried out of Egypt.
[59:08] They believed it was time. Did they wait
[59:11] for everyone else to start doing it? No.
[59:12] It became their faith. It was God
[59:14] dealing with individuals. Amen. Of um
[59:16] Amra and Jehooked, the family, right?
[59:19] And you know, Brother Brand would
[59:20] dramatize it in his sermon, lifting him
[59:22] up out of history. I tell you what, if
[59:24] you ever need a shot in the arm, go
[59:25] listen to that sermon. Lifting him up
[59:27] out of history.
[59:29] &gt;&gt; Amen. We are people who lift God out of
[59:31] history. He's not a God of the past.
[59:33] He's the great I am. He's the present
[59:35] God. Amen. And faith will lift him up
[59:37] out of history. And brother Braram said
[59:39] that God is anxiously waiting for
[59:41] someone to call him up out of history.
[59:43] May we be that people today. I mean, may
[59:45] we be that people today where we want a
[59:47] Lord. We don't want a God of the, you
[59:48] know, of the future even. Oh, it'll be
[59:50] better one day. No, today's the day.
[59:53] &gt;&gt; I mean, why not bring the promise today?
[59:55] Oh, one day when the conditions get
[59:57] right. No, faith is actually the only
[59:59] condition you need.
[1:00:00] &gt;&gt; Revelation.
[1:00:02] &gt;&gt; Amen. And Amram perhaps one of the only
[1:00:04] ones of the nation which climbed up the
[1:00:06] little little stairst steps regardless
[1:00:08] of how tired he was. Each night he'd
[1:00:10] call on the God of Abraham, the one he
[1:00:12] had learned had come to Abraham and come
[1:00:14] to Job and come to Isaac and come to
[1:00:16] Jacob. in the hours of distress. And
[1:00:18] surely if he was God in their day, he
[1:00:20] would be God in that day. And if he was
[1:00:22] in Moses' day, he is God today. He just
[1:00:25] needs to be called up out of history.
[1:00:27] Called on the scene of action.
[1:00:30] &gt;&gt; Faith does it. God wants us as
[1:00:32] individuals to call him up out of
[1:00:34] history.
[1:00:35] &gt;&gt; Amen. Oh, I've got to wait for the I've
[1:00:37] got to wait for a prayer meeting to be
[1:00:38] organized. You can be the prayer
[1:00:40] meeting.
[1:00:41] &gt;&gt; Oh, I've got to wait for some outreach
[1:00:42] to be organized. You can be the
[1:00:43] outreach.
[1:00:45] &gt;&gt; Amen. Why not? Why not let God motivate
[1:00:48] your faith?
[1:00:50] &gt;&gt; Why not stand up and say, "Lord, I'm
[1:00:51] willing to be used. I'm willing, Lord,
[1:00:53] to be a vessel. However you want me to
[1:00:56] be a witness, Lord, however you want me
[1:00:57] to be part of the church, Lord, I'm
[1:00:59] willing to do it."
[1:01:01] &gt;&gt; I'm not looking at people who are
[1:01:03] reluctant to do anything. You guys are
[1:01:04] amazing volunteers.
[1:01:06] &gt;&gt; Okay? But why don't we let our faith go?
[1:01:08] Lord, take us higher.
[1:01:10] &gt;&gt; Take us out of our comfort zone, Lord.
[1:01:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. It's like the woman with the
[1:01:17] unjust, you know, Jesus told the story
[1:01:20] of the woman and the unjust judge. That
[1:01:22] woman badgered that judge
[1:01:24] &gt;&gt; until she got an answer.
[1:01:26] &gt;&gt; And and he's basically saying, "You be
[1:01:28] like her to me. You You start trying to
[1:01:31] bug me. Get on my hands. Let your faith
[1:01:34] go into action where you pray until you
[1:01:37] get an answer. Until a peace comes that
[1:01:39] you know God's answered your prayer.
[1:01:41] Just pray until." How long will it be?
[1:01:43] It could be 5 seconds. It could be
[1:01:44] however long. But we don't just want to
[1:01:47] sit there and just go through emotions.
[1:01:48] No, we should pray until we get an
[1:01:49] answer.
[1:01:50] &gt;&gt; Amen. Faith Faith gets a hold of the hem
[1:01:53] of his garment. Amen. Faith actually
[1:01:55] stops Jesus in his tracks. Amen. Faith
[1:01:57] caused him to stand still and begin to
[1:01:59] address our situation. Amen. That's what
[1:02:02] faith does. Many times we think, "Oh, if
[1:02:03] we could just been back there where
[1:02:04] Jesus was in a body or back there in the
[1:02:06] prophet state." The same God is here
[1:02:08] today. Amen. The same one by faith you
[1:02:11] can touch. Amen. The same one here, you
[1:02:13] can put your faith into action and get a
[1:02:14] hold of.
[1:02:16] &gt;&gt; Amen. They did not fear the king's
[1:02:18] commandment. They weren't worried about
[1:02:20] what the enemy was going to do. Why?
[1:02:22] Because their faith was greater than
[1:02:23] their circumstances. The faith, their
[1:02:25] faith was greater than what the
[1:02:27] government had put in place that every
[1:02:28] Hebrew boy had to die. They weren't
[1:02:30] looking at that.
[1:02:32] &gt;&gt; They were looking at the promise. Cuz
[1:02:33] faith is a revelation. It's revealed to
[1:02:35] you. Amen. It's not something a nice
[1:02:37] idea. It's not some catchphrase or
[1:02:39] something that feels good. No, it's a
[1:02:41] revelation that anchors into your heart.
[1:02:43] Amen. So, what did they do? They took
[1:02:45] God at his word and they hid him. Amen.
[1:02:50] Praise the Lord. I just want to find
[1:02:51] this way because the law of faith is far
[1:02:54] greater is a power that's far greater
[1:02:56] than all the forces of hell. Amen. He
[1:02:59] says, he says, "Oh my, let it be uh uh
[1:03:02] let it be King Pharaoh, whoever it was
[1:03:04] when that little old housewoman raised
[1:03:06] up and looked at that child. She wasn't
[1:03:08] afraid of what the king said. This is
[1:03:10] the mother of Moses he's speaking about.
[1:03:12] That's the second power. We're going to
[1:03:13] talk on the power of the devil. Sure,
[1:03:14] he's got power to reign um and reign of
[1:03:16] death. But the second power was given
[1:03:19] was faith. And faith puts Satan to
[1:03:21] shame. Certainly it does. And that
[1:03:23] little housewife held that little baby
[1:03:26] in her arms. And she wasn't afraid of
[1:03:27] the king's commandment. She didn't care
[1:03:30] what the king said. She knowed God was
[1:03:32] able and God would keep his word.
[1:03:35] &gt;&gt; Faith declares that.
[1:03:37] &gt;&gt; That's right. Faith does not say, "I
[1:03:39] hope God's word will work." Faith knows
[1:03:41] he's able to keep his word.
[1:03:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:43] &gt;&gt; Amen. Oh, if we could only accumulate
[1:03:45] that kind of a faith tonight would be
[1:03:47] kind of a faith living among us. Uh
[1:03:49] mainly moving in our beings, moving
[1:03:51] through the church. Not just the
[1:03:53] emotional faith, but a real solid faith
[1:03:55] that won't take no for an answer. Know
[1:03:58] that God said so and that settles it. He
[1:04:00] says, "I love it." Amen. So real faith
[1:04:03] that is settled in the hearts that's not
[1:04:05] based on emotion. Because faith is not
[1:04:07] emotion, but emotion brings faith,
[1:04:09] &gt;&gt; right? It's not it's not that kind of
[1:04:11] thing. No, it's something that settles
[1:04:12] in our heart that we know God is more
[1:04:15] than able to do it.
[1:04:17] &gt;&gt; Amen. And if it's a revelation to you,
[1:04:19] he has done it.
[1:04:20] &gt;&gt; You just walk into it, but it's yours.
[1:04:23] &gt;&gt; You possess it. Is this okay?
[1:04:25] &gt;&gt; Amen. It's not, oh, hope it's going to
[1:04:27] work. No, you know it's already there.
[1:04:28] Abraham knew Isaac was coming
[1:04:30] &gt;&gt; when it became a revelation to him. He
[1:04:32] didn't have to hope. Maybe one day he
[1:04:34] knew Isaac was on his road.
[1:04:37] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's the kind of faith we have.
[1:04:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. But you see what happens is is the
[1:04:43] enemy wants to oppress us by wrong
[1:04:46] ideas. I'm just going to make a big
[1:04:47] segue then we're going to segue back.
[1:04:49] Okay. I just failed to put this in. I
[1:04:50] was in Well, this made sense to me at
[1:04:52] 12:30 last night. So, you know, I'm sure
[1:04:54] today it makes sense. Makes the same
[1:04:56] sense. So, Ecclesiastes 7:7, this is
[1:04:59] Yeah, I really like this verse. says
[1:05:00] surely oppression maketh a wise man mad
[1:05:02] and a gift destroyth the heart. Amen. So
[1:05:06] there's an oppression that can make so
[1:05:07] someone who's wise. Now I believe I'm
[1:05:09] looking at some of the wisest people in
[1:05:10] the world because we have the mind of
[1:05:12] Christ that makes you wise. Amen. The
[1:05:15] fear of the Lord is the beginning of
[1:05:16] wisdom and and we have and we fear the
[1:05:19] Lord with a reverential love and trust,
[1:05:20] right? And a fear, godly fear. So we're
[1:05:23] actually wise people. Amen. Wisdom is
[1:05:25] not based on how many diplomas and
[1:05:27] degrees and doctorates you have. If you
[1:05:29] can have those things, those things are
[1:05:31] fine. But it doesn't make you wise. It's
[1:05:33] the wisdom of God makes you wise. Amen.
[1:05:36] But you see what happens is oppression
[1:05:37] can make someone who's wise mad because
[1:05:41] it becomes something that is is is is
[1:05:44] twisted in our minds and it can force us
[1:05:46] down. It can oppress us. You see,
[1:05:50] you know, they speak today a lot about
[1:05:52] I'm sorry, this is quite a segue, but
[1:05:54] they speak a lot about today about
[1:05:56] emotional intelligence. Who's heard
[1:05:57] about emotional intelligence? How
[1:05:59] emotionally intelligent are you as a
[1:06:01] person? Right? Now, emotional
[1:06:03] intelligence is actually spiritual
[1:06:05] intelligence because your emotions are
[1:06:07] your spirit,
[1:06:09] &gt;&gt; right? If you didn't have a human
[1:06:11] spirit, one, you'd be dead. Two, you
[1:06:13] wouldn't feel anything,
[1:06:15] &gt;&gt; right? Because but so we all have a
[1:06:17] spirit realm, a soul, a body, and a
[1:06:20] spirit. That's you. You're a triune
[1:06:22] being.
[1:06:23] &gt;&gt; Okay? So emotional intelligence is
[1:06:25] really spiritual intelligence. Now this
[1:06:27] is just from just from the web. It says
[1:06:29] from from helpgu.org. Emotional
[1:06:31] intelligence. What is an emotional
[1:06:32] intelligence? Emotional intelligence is
[1:06:35] the ability to understand, use and
[1:06:36] manage your own emotions in positive
[1:06:38] ways to relieve stress, communicate
[1:06:40] effectively, emphasize uh emphas
[1:06:43] emphasize u empathize whatever that is.
[1:06:46] Feel sorry for people. Understand their
[1:06:48] feelings.
[1:06:50] I man I wish English was my second
[1:06:52] language.
[1:06:54] overcome challenges and diffuse
[1:06:56] conflict. So, someone who's emotionally
[1:06:58] intelligent can do those things or
[1:07:01] spiritually, I want to use the word
[1:07:02] spiritually intelligent, right? You're
[1:07:04] in tune with your spirit. You can you
[1:07:06] can and now this is me. This is sh uh uh
[1:07:08] definitely not Google. The believer
[1:07:10] should be able to evaluate their own
[1:07:11] emotions, feelings prayerfully, and take
[1:07:13] them to the Lord because we want to have
[1:07:15] our faith in the right place.
[1:07:19] &gt;&gt; Amen. We don't want to be segueed by
[1:07:22] things we shouldn't be bothered by.
[1:07:24] Okay. Now, if we have this wait, we go
[1:07:27] here. Isaiah says that he is, you know,
[1:07:31] he said that the Lord is our counselor.
[1:07:34] &gt;&gt; Okay. So, a counselor gives counsel,
[1:07:37] &gt;&gt; you know, and what we need to do is let
[1:07:38] the counselor counsel us.
[1:07:41] &gt;&gt; Not just remember with us and God, it's
[1:07:43] not one way communication where we just
[1:07:45] pour it all out and then we just walk
[1:07:46] on. He needs to counsel us back. Right.
[1:07:50] He needs to talk to us back. Okay. And
[1:07:52] yeah, I know. Well, duh. Yeah, I know.
[1:07:54] But, you know, he speaks to us, doesn't
[1:07:55] he?
[1:07:56] &gt;&gt; Right. So, in order in order because
[1:07:58] there's many things in life that that if
[1:08:00] we don't take it to the Lord, these
[1:08:03] things can can actually make us mad
[1:08:05] because someone who's mad, their
[1:08:07] spirit's been crushed. It doesn't
[1:08:09] operate like it should. Like, who's ever
[1:08:10] had a big bruise or broken arm or
[1:08:12] something? I say an oppression has come
[1:08:14] into your limb, right? Something's
[1:08:17] broke. it it can't operate like it
[1:08:19] should.
[1:08:20] &gt;&gt; Okay? And it's like our faith or like us
[1:08:22] as a person, if that oppression comes
[1:08:24] in, the enemy wants to take the truth,
[1:08:25] pervert it, and make it an oppression.
[1:08:28] Amen. So you take you know for example
[1:08:31] you know so um you take a teenager who's
[1:08:34] going through puberty massive rush of
[1:08:36] hormones sexual development and you know
[1:08:38] the centers of their brain the you know
[1:08:40] there's the check and balance part of
[1:08:42] their brain and and and and the risk
[1:08:44] takingaking part is fully mature but the
[1:08:47] check and balance part is still very
[1:08:49] infant. So they start doing crazy
[1:08:50] things. Hormones come into your body
[1:08:52] start being attracted to the opposite
[1:08:54] opposite sex and all these things. Now
[1:08:56] that's part of life.
[1:08:58] That's human feelings. That's natural.
[1:09:02] It's good.
[1:09:04] &gt;&gt; Okay. But then the devil can pervert
[1:09:06] that and say, "Oh, you like that person
[1:09:07] or you're attracted to that person. Oh,
[1:09:09] you're lusting. Therefore, you're
[1:09:10] committing adultery. Now you're
[1:09:11] condemned." Cuz he twists those things.
[1:09:14] Right? But you see now if you come back
[1:09:15] to the right balance and realize, no,
[1:09:17] this is part of being a human being. And
[1:09:19] God made you that way to be attracted to
[1:09:21] to your mate,
[1:09:23] &gt;&gt; right? And it's part of two becoming
[1:09:25] one. It's a good thing.
[1:09:28] Okay. So, if it's out of balance, it can
[1:09:29] become an oppression. But if it's a, you
[1:09:31] know, and then and then of course going
[1:09:33] through puberty and stuff, you realize
[1:09:34] what's happening to me. Yeah. Because I
[1:09:36] saw this skit and I don't have it here.
[1:09:38] I probably wouldn't play it here, but
[1:09:39] you know, there's this British comedy
[1:09:41] thing and there's like this kid. I mean,
[1:09:43] I mean, they're all adults playing it,
[1:09:44] but there's the kid, right? And they're
[1:09:46] like a happy normal like you they're
[1:09:48] just before puberty behaving, well,
[1:09:51] everything. And then suddenly it's like
[1:09:52] a buttons pushed. They become like a
[1:09:53] caveman and can only grunt and just
[1:09:55] start fussing and arguing and things.
[1:10:00] &gt;&gt; Right. It's part of human development.
[1:10:03] &gt;&gt; Right. We've all If you've been through
[1:10:05] puberty, you've been through that.
[1:10:08] &gt;&gt; Yep. Right. And brother says you just
[1:10:11] got to bear with them. That's
[1:10:13] &gt;&gt; right. Give them some understanding.
[1:10:15] Give them, you know, you were there,
[1:10:17] right?
[1:10:18] &gt;&gt; They're there. Don't be so hard.
[1:10:22] become their friend.
[1:10:23] &gt;&gt; Remember, you want to put faith into
[1:10:25] action,
[1:10:25] &gt;&gt; right? If you have wisdom, you can put
[1:10:27] faith into action, right? It's not just
[1:10:29] now I've got to put a straight jacket on
[1:10:31] them and keep them from everything. No,
[1:10:33] you've got to navigate with them through
[1:10:35] life because one day they're going to
[1:10:37] leave home and you're not going to be
[1:10:39] around. How are they going to be then?
[1:10:42] You know, it's we have to raise our
[1:10:45] children in such a way they become
[1:10:46] sensible, sane, Holy Ghost filled
[1:10:48] adults. We got to create an environment.
[1:10:51] Now, I probably I trust, you know, I
[1:10:54] trust we're here together, right? But,
[1:10:55] you know, we got to raise them in such a
[1:10:57] way that they can, sure, they'll make
[1:10:59] mistakes. They'll do crazy stuff, but
[1:11:00] there's got to be a home, a place that's
[1:11:02] safe they can come back to. And it
[1:11:04] should be mom and dad.
[1:11:06] &gt;&gt; Our host, our our relationship should be
[1:11:08] a sanctuary. should be a place like a
[1:11:11] citadel where they can run into when
[1:11:12] things are bad and they've done dumb
[1:11:14] stuff and they can, you know, the devil
[1:11:16] wants them to sit with it and say,
[1:11:17] "Well, you just gone and you're lost.
[1:11:19] You've gone too far." That's an
[1:11:21] oppression,
[1:11:23] right?
[1:11:25] And it's the same thing if you take a
[1:11:27] woman who's going through menopause or
[1:11:29] pre premenopause or however you say it.
[1:11:31] Everyone knows the, you know, because
[1:11:33] one day they're fine and then they get
[1:11:35] hot flashes up and down. Feelings go
[1:11:37] everywhere. And what's the first thing
[1:11:38] we think about? I'm under attack. A
[1:11:41] spirit's got me. I'm fighting this
[1:11:43] thing. And it can become a a loop of
[1:11:45] prayer and fasting when they're trying
[1:11:47] to pray away something that's just part
[1:11:48] of life,
[1:11:50] &gt;&gt; right? And so, but when you realize
[1:11:52] that, you can just relax.
[1:11:54] &gt;&gt; It's a season. God will take you through
[1:11:56] it,
[1:11:57] &gt;&gt; right? And you'll come out the other
[1:11:58] side.
[1:11:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. Is it easy? Well, it's it it's
[1:12:02] hard being a teenager. I did not enjoy
[1:12:03] being a teenager. I'm glad I'm an old
[1:12:06] guy now,
[1:12:07] &gt;&gt; right? But I didn't I didn't enjoy those
[1:12:08] years, especially from 18 to about 22
[1:12:11] was terrible.
[1:12:13] &gt;&gt; But thank God I made it,
[1:12:15] &gt;&gt; you know, and it's like so because you
[1:12:18] don't know how you you just have no idea
[1:12:20] what you're up to, right?
[1:12:23] But God gets you through,
[1:12:25] &gt;&gt; right? And we got to have that in mind.
[1:12:27] They're going to get through this.
[1:12:29] &gt;&gt; Just like sisters going through
[1:12:30] menopause, you're going to get through
[1:12:31] it. It's okay. You may feel, man, man, I
[1:12:34] feel like I'm dying or what's wrong?
[1:12:36] Something's killing me. No, you're just
[1:12:37] going through a change of life.
[1:12:39] &gt;&gt; Amen. And you'll get through it. God
[1:12:41] will guide you through it. Amen.
[1:12:44] Praise the Lord.
[1:12:46] Amen. But don't let it become a loop of
[1:12:48] you start to fight against something
[1:12:49] that you know, try and pray something
[1:12:51] away that's just part of life. You know,
[1:12:54] it's like a young person who's now
[1:12:56] realized they're attracted to someone,
[1:12:57] they want to start a relationship, all
[1:12:59] these things. And you know, you can't
[1:13:00] kill that part of you.
[1:13:02] You can't you can't cut that desire part
[1:13:05] off. We're all red-blooded.
[1:13:07] &gt;&gt; God built you a certain way. He wants
[1:13:09] you to be that way.
[1:13:12] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, don't let it become an
[1:13:13] oppression.
[1:13:15] We don't need to be stressed, worked up,
[1:13:17] or worried about these things. It's just
[1:13:19] us going through a natural change of
[1:13:20] life.
[1:13:22] Amen.
[1:13:25] Now, here's a scary picture.
[1:13:30] Equations. I liked math. I wasn't very
[1:13:31] good at it, but I liked it.
[1:13:35] We expect now, now there's an answer we
[1:13:38] want, right? 1 + 1 equals 2.
[1:13:41] 1 + 50 million does not equal two. Okay?
[1:13:46] So, if we want the right answer, we need
[1:13:49] the right numbers to get the right
[1:13:52] answer or the right conditions to get
[1:13:53] the right answer. Okay? So now if we
[1:13:57] look at the whole fact this so see you
[1:14:00] know if you take social media use for
[1:14:01] example they say it's a way to feel
[1:14:04] connected and to build meaningful
[1:14:06] relationships but the studies have come
[1:14:09] in the the numbers are in guys
[1:14:12] &gt;&gt; the numbers are in guys it makes people
[1:14:14] more depressed detached and alienated
[1:14:16] from society it does not bring people
[1:14:18] together it disconnects people but now
[1:14:21] if you but but but if the answer to the
[1:14:23] equation is I want to be connected and
[1:14:25] feel like I'm part. See, this is why
[1:14:26] people people get into addiction is
[1:14:28] because I feel disconnected.
[1:14:30] &gt;&gt; And this is drugs, pornography, any any
[1:14:33] addiction in the world is because of a
[1:14:35] lack of connection with their peers and
[1:14:37] their family. It really does boil down
[1:14:39] to such simple things.
[1:14:41] &gt;&gt; So the thing is if your answer like that
[1:14:43] C squed in the middle for example, if
[1:14:44] that was meant to be I want to be
[1:14:46] connected and have meaningful
[1:14:47] relationships, but then I just but then
[1:14:49] I have the A squ is just I'm just going
[1:14:51] to be alienated in my room on social
[1:14:53] media more. you're not going to get to
[1:14:56] be connected.
[1:14:58] You see, it's actually you're doing the
[1:14:59] opposite of what you actually want.
[1:15:01] Okay? Now, faith can look beyond those
[1:15:04] things. See, we got to put our faith
[1:15:05] into action in everyday life. You know,
[1:15:08] we got to think now, why am I why am I
[1:15:11] why are my kids alienating themselves?
[1:15:14] Why are they wanting to hide away in a
[1:15:16] different kind of a world? Faith can
[1:15:19] bring them back.
[1:15:20] &gt;&gt; You got to let faith come into action
[1:15:22] and bring them out of that thing. And
[1:15:24] that doesn't mean I'm going to put you
[1:15:25] in a solitary confinement room, padded
[1:15:28] cell. That's not that's not faith.
[1:15:30] That's just fear and control.
[1:15:33] &gt;&gt; Amen. But faith will give you the tools
[1:15:34] to actually get because remember they're
[1:15:36] going through things. They're not really
[1:15:38] coping in life. The and we all even
[1:15:40] adults, we have periods where we don't
[1:15:41] really cope.
[1:15:44] &gt;&gt; Yeah, it's okay. We have times like
[1:15:46] that. We feel overwhelmed. David, King
[1:15:48] David said, "When my heart's
[1:15:49] overwhelmed, Lord, lead me to the rock
[1:15:50] that's higher than I." Amen. Lead me to
[1:15:52] the revelation that's greater than my my
[1:15:54] my emotions, my mental state.
[1:15:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. Show me who I am in your word
[1:15:59] again, Lord.
[1:16:00] &gt;&gt; Amen. That brings stability and peace.
[1:16:03] So, so people become more disconnected
[1:16:05] and things because of these things, but
[1:16:06] they're trying to become more connected.
[1:16:08] You got to change your your uh variables
[1:16:10] in your equation to get the right
[1:16:12] answer. I mean, it's the same thing with
[1:16:14] a with a wife, with a woman who will
[1:16:16] test love by constantly pushing their
[1:16:18] spouse away. They're actually testing to
[1:16:21] see if he loves her or not. But how do
[1:16:23] they do it? By pushing them away. But
[1:16:26] what's the answer really to that
[1:16:27] equation? Will be a distance in a
[1:16:29] relationship. Though though the fact is
[1:16:32] is they actually want to be connected.
[1:16:33] They want to know their spouse better.
[1:16:35] But what they do? They push them away.
[1:16:37] They're testing love.
[1:16:39] That ain't going to help.
[1:16:41] This is how women are built. I've heard
[1:16:44] because I'm not one. And then what the
[1:16:46] men do? So they get this test by being
[1:16:48] pushed back whether they hold themselves
[1:16:50] up in a cage in a cave. They become a
[1:16:52] caveman, a man in the wilderness getting
[1:16:55] away. I've just got to go pray. I've
[1:16:57] just got to spend some time with the
[1:16:58] Lord. Faith will bring your family into
[1:17:00] that worship.
[1:17:02] &gt;&gt; Faith will bring the family together.
[1:17:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:06] &gt;&gt; But you see the whole the the answer is
[1:17:09] meant to be being connected and a proof
[1:17:11] of love. But it's by pushing away.
[1:17:14] You'll never get what you want that way.
[1:17:17] You got to do the opposite. Remember
[1:17:18] Einstein said, "Insanity is doing the
[1:17:21] same thing over and over again,
[1:17:23] expecting different results."
[1:17:26] Faith will change our method.
[1:17:31] &gt;&gt; Amen. We're going to look beyond the
[1:17:33] current circumstances.
[1:17:35] Faith does that.
[1:17:37] &gt;&gt; Amen. Faith is a long range vision. Now,
[1:17:39] we can all relax. I'm going to go back
[1:17:41] to these things again. Okay? Faith has
[1:17:43] long range vision. It doesn't lower its
[1:17:45] sights. It holds to the target. Amen.
[1:17:47] Any good shooter knows that. See? See,
[1:17:49] it's long range. It's a telescope. It's
[1:17:51] a binocular. You don't look around here.
[1:17:53] You don't use binoculars to look to see
[1:17:55] what time it is. See, you don't use
[1:17:57] that. But use binoculars to look a way
[1:18:00] off. And faith does that. Faith picks up
[1:18:01] God's binoculars both on both sides, the
[1:18:04] Old and New Testament, and sees every
[1:18:05] promise that he made. Faith sees out
[1:18:08] yonder. And faith chooses that
[1:18:09] regardless of what the present tense
[1:18:11] says here, he looks to the end. He don't
[1:18:14] drop his sights down and look this way.
[1:18:15] He looks out yonder. He keeps the cross
[1:18:18] here dead center on the word. That's
[1:18:19] what faith does. That's the faith that
[1:18:21] is in man that does those things.
[1:18:24] &gt;&gt; So you see all these circumstances
[1:18:26] around you. Faith doesn't look at that.
[1:18:28] Faith looks at the promise.
[1:18:30] &gt;&gt; Amen. Thine and thy house shall be
[1:18:32] saved. Amen. I'll put my word in thy
[1:18:35] mouth of thy seed and thy seed seed
[1:18:37] henceforth forever. Amen. This is this
[1:18:40] is the promise. Amen. The promise is
[1:18:41] we'll be one. Amen. Husband and wife
[1:18:44] will be one. Body, soul, and spirit will
[1:18:46] be one. Faith looks at that promise.
[1:18:48] Faith doesn't look at circumstances.
[1:18:50] Faith looks beyond
[1:18:51] &gt;&gt; those things. And I believe I'm looking
[1:18:53] at people of faith.
[1:18:54] &gt;&gt; Amen. Who won't who who don't react
[1:18:56] based on how they're being treated
[1:18:58] because love is not divine love is not
[1:19:00] conditional. I mean, divine love is not
[1:19:03] based on how you're treated. It loves
[1:19:05] anyway.
[1:19:06] &gt;&gt; I mean, and divine love is the only
[1:19:08] thing that will conquer because it
[1:19:09] conquers all.
[1:19:11] &gt;&gt; Arguments don't. fussing doesn't. Amen.
[1:19:13] Well, I want to win an argument. I want
[1:19:14] to do this. I tell you, oppression, a
[1:19:17] gift of arguing can just can can just
[1:19:19] destroy the heart. And because that
[1:19:21] second part of that verse is, you know,
[1:19:23] sure um and a gift destroyth the heart.
[1:19:26] Who knows someone who can argue really
[1:19:28] well? They should be a criminal lawyer
[1:19:31] or a politician.
[1:19:34] Someone can misuse that gift and destroy
[1:19:37] someone. Not only destroy that person,
[1:19:39] but destroy themselves. because they
[1:19:42] will begin to think, man, they can just
[1:19:43] talk their way out of anything. There
[1:19:46] there's always things come in life. You
[1:19:47] know, you isn't it interesting? We think
[1:19:50] we can always do a certain thing and
[1:19:51] it'll always work. God will cause
[1:19:53] conditions to come in where you're
[1:19:56] talking or what you think you can do to
[1:19:58] get out of it won't work.
[1:20:00] &gt;&gt; Amen. Moses was a great military
[1:20:02] commander. He found himself on the back
[1:20:04] side of desert with a hightempered wife.
[1:20:07] &gt;&gt; God knew how to work, man. because he
[1:20:09] you know because being a being like a
[1:20:11] god in Egypt you think I can just talk
[1:20:12] my way in everyone just have complete
[1:20:14] obedience then he finds himself shepherd
[1:20:18] backside of the desert no palace no
[1:20:20] servants no nothing no army to command
[1:20:23] and he can't even his words don't work
[1:20:25] against this woman
[1:20:31] knows how to bring us to place we
[1:20:32] realize what we think we can do doesn't
[1:20:34] work
[1:20:35] &gt;&gt; amen you see a you know a gift of
[1:20:37] arguing to win an arg argument can
[1:20:39] destroy the heart of that person. We're
[1:20:41] not meant to break people down. We're
[1:20:43] not called to break our spouses or break
[1:20:45] We don't We're not building soldiers in
[1:20:47] the modern way because it says, you
[1:20:49] know, they say when they train a
[1:20:51] soldier, you got to break the civilian
[1:20:52] to make the soldier. We aren't here to
[1:20:54] do that. We we're under a different
[1:20:56] mandate. I mean, we're not building
[1:20:57] cannon fod here. We're building sons and
[1:21:00] daughters of God, powerhouses of the
[1:21:02] Holy Ghost. I mean, so God doesn't break
[1:21:04] our spirit and crush us. And we
[1:21:06] shouldn't do that to one another. No, we
[1:21:08] should build up one. They say, "Well, I
[1:21:09] could really win that argument." It's
[1:21:11] not about winning an argument. This
[1:21:12] isn't some talent show or some quiz game
[1:21:15] where you're trying to win points.
[1:21:18] &gt;&gt; I mean, cuz some people they can argue
[1:21:19] till the cows come home, but they
[1:21:21] they're empty inside because they've
[1:21:23] destroyed people. People they love the
[1:21:25] most. They've destroyed them. Why?
[1:21:27] Because they've they've actually used
[1:21:29] that gift to have a good argument to
[1:21:31] destroy. There's no wisdom in it.
[1:21:35] &gt;&gt; Oh my.
[1:21:38] Amen. Don't fuss. I like that. Amen.
[1:21:42] When the family gets in a fuss, don't
[1:21:43] fuss with them. Your mother said, "I
[1:21:45] ain't having you go up there that old
[1:21:47] church anymore. Well, you all think
[1:21:48] about it. You're letting your hair grow
[1:21:50] out. You look like some old grandma."
[1:21:52] Don't fuss with her. Say, "Okay, mother.
[1:21:53] It's all right. I love you just the
[1:21:55] same. I'll be praying for you as long as
[1:21:56] I live." See, now don't fuss. See,
[1:21:58] temper breeds temper. First thing you
[1:22:01] know, you grieve the Holy Spirit away
[1:22:02] from you. You'll be fussing back. Then
[1:22:04] the Holy Spirit takes its flight. Temper
[1:22:06] breeds temper. Love breeds love. Be full
[1:22:09] of love. Amen. Jesus said, "This will
[1:22:12] all men know you're my disciples when
[1:22:14] you have love one for another." That's
[1:22:15] right. The fruit of the Holy Spirit is
[1:22:17] love.
[1:22:19] &gt;&gt; Amen. So what? 1 plus one equals two.
[1:22:22] Temper plus fussing equals hatred and
[1:22:24] division.
[1:22:25] &gt;&gt; Right? Oh, but I'm going to win. They're
[1:22:27] so dumb.
[1:22:29] &gt;&gt; I can prove my point. This is not a
[1:22:32] House of Representatives. This ain't
[1:22:33] Parliament, man.
[1:22:34] &gt;&gt; Your family should not be the
[1:22:35] government, the opposition, and the
[1:22:37] Greens.
[1:22:38] &gt;&gt; Okay? We're all on the same team.
[1:22:41] &gt;&gt; Amen. Whatever your party is. Well,
[1:22:43] we're the Jesus party. Okay? But you
[1:22:46] know what I mean, right? We
[1:22:50] Oh my.
[1:22:52] Faith creates. You know, you're a little
[1:22:55] creator. So, I'm just reading a bit
[1:22:56] here. You're a little creator yourself.
[1:22:58] You know that. I mean, certainly you've
[1:23:00] seen people you just love to be around.
[1:23:01] You don't know why. Just that loving
[1:23:03] type of person. Have you seen that? Just
[1:23:05] as kind. They like to be around them.
[1:23:06] See, they create an atmosphere. They
[1:23:08] live by that. They walk. They talk. It's
[1:23:10] their conversation. Because faith
[1:23:12] creates an atmosphere of love. You want
[1:23:15] to know you got revelation? What
[1:23:16] atmosphere is around you? I mean,
[1:23:18] because a human faith which is not
[1:23:20] revelation will produce a bitterness, a
[1:23:23] hatred, division, a strife, an envy, a
[1:23:25] superiority. That's human faith. That's
[1:23:27] emotional faith. Amen. But revelation
[1:23:30] faith produces the love of God. Brings a
[1:23:32] peace, a security, a calmness. People
[1:23:36] can come in the door, they can be tore
[1:23:37] up, fussing, fighting trouble, but they
[1:23:39] step into a different atmosphere.
[1:23:42] &gt;&gt; And that goes away, goes away, goes
[1:23:43] away. Why? Because there's a atmosphere
[1:23:45] of faith in the house.
[1:23:49] Amen. But you see, we've got to
[1:23:51] overcome,
[1:23:52] &gt;&gt; right? We do not win in a vacuum. I've
[1:23:56] never seen in my life a rugby team
[1:23:59] playing against another rugby team and
[1:24:00] the other rugby team is not on the
[1:24:02] field.
[1:24:04] &gt;&gt; There's always there's always two teams,
[1:24:06] &gt;&gt; right? You have to defeat. Doesn't
[1:24:09] matter how good you are, you've got to
[1:24:10] beat the other team.
[1:24:12] &gt;&gt; You've got to tackle them. You got to
[1:24:13] block them. You've got to get the ball
[1:24:14] past them. You have to actually put your
[1:24:17] skills, I say your faith into action to
[1:24:20] win the day.
[1:24:21] &gt;&gt; Amen. You don't just sit there on the
[1:24:22] field and say, "Well, I'm going to win
[1:24:24] today." and you're sitting cross-legged
[1:24:26] on the halfway mark.
[1:24:28] But that's how some people operate in
[1:24:30] faith. Well, they think it's faith. I'm
[1:24:32] waiting for God to do something. God
[1:24:34] wants to use you. Amen. God does not
[1:24:36] make us overcomers by a flick of a
[1:24:38] switch. We have to surrender our human
[1:24:41] will over to his.
[1:24:43] &gt;&gt; Amen. Because we got to realize because
[1:24:45] there's a promise in this day. To him
[1:24:46] that overcometh,
[1:24:48] &gt;&gt; you'll sit on his throne. Right? And so
[1:24:50] now to be an overcomer, we have to
[1:24:52] surrender our human will to his.
[1:24:55] &gt;&gt; Because remember, when the Lord fills us
[1:24:57] with the Holy Ghost, he fills our soul.
[1:24:59] He comes and dwells in our soul. He
[1:25:01] cleanses out our spirit, but it's the
[1:25:03] same human spirit, right? Our body is
[1:25:05] the same old body. We have to surrender
[1:25:08] our members to him that he can overcome.
[1:25:10] We got to surrender our members to him,
[1:25:12] our spirit to him that faith can rule.
[1:25:16] &gt;&gt; Amen. I trust this is all right just
[1:25:18] now. Amen. We've because remember we do
[1:25:20] not he does not change our spirit that
[1:25:23] it becomes a robot. We're not robots.
[1:25:24] Out of our own will we serve God. Amen.
[1:25:27] So now we've got to put our faith into
[1:25:28] action like a rugby team on the field.
[1:25:30] They've got to really put on the gear.
[1:25:32] Go win the day.
[1:25:35] &gt;&gt; Amen. Oh, but I'm waiting for another
[1:25:36] team to win. But you're on the field.
[1:25:38] &gt;&gt; I'm waiting for another halfback to make
[1:25:40] that kick. You're the halfback or the
[1:25:42] prop. You know, you're in that position
[1:25:44] and it's not someone else. If someone
[1:25:45] you're on the field whether you like oh
[1:25:47] someone else will do it for me. God
[1:25:49] wants you to overcome. He wants your
[1:25:51] faith to be put into action but you've
[1:25:53] got to be willing for it to go into
[1:25:55] action.
[1:25:56] &gt;&gt; Amen. It's a re faith is a revelation.
[1:25:59] Now God as I said in the beginning he
[1:26:02] deals with us as individuals. Right?
[1:26:03] He's not waiting for anyone else. Now
[1:26:05] everyone in the scripture that comes to
[1:26:07] the Lord that's not really a group
[1:26:09] thing. It's individuals like this like
[1:26:11] the centurion came to him said Lord my
[1:26:14] servant is is is sick. He's going to die
[1:26:17] you know and Jesus says and I don't know
[1:26:18] if I have it there but he said I think
[1:26:20] in the previous verse he says you know
[1:26:22] Jesus says well I'll come I'll come heal
[1:26:24] him. But the centurion says I'm not
[1:26:26] worthy you even come under my roof but
[1:26:29] speak the word only and my and my
[1:26:31] servant will live. Now this centurion
[1:26:33] had great faith. Jesus marveled saying I
[1:26:36] have never found faith like this in
[1:26:38] Israel. Amen. The people who should have
[1:26:40] this kind of faith don't have it. It's a
[1:26:42] it's a pagan centurion.
[1:26:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. It's it's a gentile has this kind
[1:26:47] of a faith. And this is gentile faith.
[1:26:49] Amen. Gentile faith believes that when
[1:26:51] God speaks his word, it's exactly the
[1:26:54] same as him physically coming laying
[1:26:56] hands on a person and touching them and
[1:26:57] making them well. Amen. Because God and
[1:26:59] his word are the same thing. This is
[1:27:01] third pull faith. Amen. This centurion
[1:27:04] had faith in the spoken word of God and
[1:27:06] he believed it had power. He believed it
[1:27:09] was present. He believed it could work.
[1:27:11] Amen. Hey, that's why he said just speak
[1:27:12] the word, Lord Jesus. I tell you what,
[1:27:15] friends, the Lord has spoken his word.
[1:27:17] Amen. He has sent his word, amen, into
[1:27:19] this generation. This message is God's
[1:27:22] word come to the earth. Amen. And why he
[1:27:24] sent his word and healed them. Amen. And
[1:27:27] delivered them from their destructions.
[1:27:29] Amen. I believe, friends, that we have
[1:27:31] lived out this scripture. Amen. We're
[1:27:33] being delivered from our destructions.
[1:27:34] Amen. We are on our way to a sinner's
[1:27:37] grave. Amen. into a lost lost abyss of a
[1:27:39] hell. Amen. But God rich in mercy sent
[1:27:42] his word your way. Amen. Someone was
[1:27:44] praying. Amen. For you. Amen. That you
[1:27:46] would come to the knowledge of Christ.
[1:27:48] Amen. That the faith of God would come
[1:27:50] into your life and change you. Amen.
[1:27:52] It's like in Hallelujah. Back in 2007
[1:27:55] when I met the Lord, there was Sister
[1:27:57] Vanessa here in Wellington. Never met
[1:27:58] her in my life. Was praying. Brother
[1:28:00] Caben was praying, "Lord, raise up a
[1:28:02] pastor in this place."
[1:28:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. Christine had a revelation. Maybe
[1:28:06] my husband's not even saved yet.
[1:28:10] &gt;&gt; Faith works.
[1:28:11] &gt;&gt; I'm a testimony.
[1:28:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. That faith works. Amen. I was
[1:28:17] doing my own thing, walking around my
[1:28:18] own life, but faith got a hold of me.
[1:28:20] Amen. Someone's prayers were touched
[1:28:22] heaven, came down upon the earth, and
[1:28:24] God be to speak. God be to move and I
[1:28:27] realized, Lord, I need you.
[1:28:30] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. That was their faith. Amen.
[1:28:32] I'll tell you what, people on the other
[1:28:34] side of the country were taking ceiling
[1:28:37] tiles off of my life. I mean, to get me
[1:28:39] into the presence of Jesus Christ. Did
[1:28:42] they know me? They didn't need to know
[1:28:43] me. Amen. God knew me. That was the main
[1:28:45] thing. And God was inspiring their faith
[1:28:47] to pray. Amen. And I'm a testimony of
[1:28:50] answered prayer.
[1:28:52] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And time would fail us to
[1:28:54] speak of everyone else that God has
[1:28:56] moved on. But what happened? They stood
[1:28:57] out in faith. They didn't wait for
[1:28:59] someone else to pray. No, I'm going to
[1:29:00] pray.
[1:29:02] I know God.
[1:29:03] &gt;&gt; Amen. I know I can go before his throne
[1:29:05] of grace anytime I want. No, God's put
[1:29:08] it on my heart to pray. I'm going to let
[1:29:09] God pray through me this prayer.
[1:29:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:12] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So, he sent his word and
[1:29:14] healed. I tell you what, friends, the
[1:29:15] Lord is present. Amen. We don't have to
[1:29:18] wait till some special meeting. I'm
[1:29:20] looking forward to camp. I tell you, God
[1:29:21] is present.
[1:29:23] &gt;&gt; Amen. If you know if this if this
[1:29:24] centurion had that kind of a faith where
[1:29:27] Lord send your word and your word is the
[1:29:29] same as you coming that is gentile faith
[1:29:31] in the believer.
[1:29:33] &gt;&gt; Amen. Oh, if only we were there 2,000
[1:29:35] years ago. The same Jesus,
[1:29:38] &gt;&gt; the same king of glory, just not in his
[1:29:40] physical body, but the same God is
[1:29:43] present.
[1:29:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. To meet our need.
[1:29:47] Hallelujah.
[1:29:50] Amen. And the Sarapheneician woman
[1:29:52] wasn't waiting for anyone else to go to
[1:29:55] the Lord. She wasn't even waiting for
[1:29:57] her daughter to get to a nice kind of
[1:29:58] condition and take her with because
[1:30:00] faith doesn't look at the condition of
[1:30:02] the person in need.
[1:30:04] &gt;&gt; Faith declares the answers here.
[1:30:07] &gt;&gt; Amen. And her faith has a had a lot of
[1:30:09] obstacles, had a lot of trouble because
[1:30:11] remember she went to the Lord and and
[1:30:13] and and he said to his disciples, I'm
[1:30:15] not even sent to the house of Israel. I
[1:30:17] mean to them. I'm not even sent to the
[1:30:19] Gentiles. I've only been sent to the
[1:30:20] lost sheep of Israel.
[1:30:22] The Lord himself was trying to discover
[1:30:25] discourage her humanly.
[1:30:27] But he knew her faith.
[1:30:30] &gt;&gt; Cuz faith goes beyond excuses. Oh, my
[1:30:32] past and my problems and my pride and my
[1:30:35] shame and you don't know what I've been
[1:30:36] through. Well, Jesus went to hell for
[1:30:38] you. He hung on Calvary to take your
[1:30:40] sins away. Amen. He was despised and
[1:30:42] rejected of men. He died of a broken
[1:30:44] heart. Amen. He knows he was acquainted
[1:30:46] with grief. If you're acquainted with
[1:30:48] something, you know it really well.
[1:30:49] Amen. He He went through the worst
[1:30:51] things a man could ever go through. So
[1:30:53] what excuse do we have?
[1:30:56] &gt;&gt; None is the answer if you're wondering.
[1:30:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. And she had an afflicted daughter
[1:31:01] tormented by an evil spirit. She wasn't
[1:31:03] looking at the state of her daughter to
[1:31:05] say, "Well, now's the time." No, she got
[1:31:07] to the master. And as I said, he tried
[1:31:10] to discourage her. You know the bread is
[1:31:13] not even you know you know the
[1:31:14] children's bread not even sent to the
[1:31:16] dogs and all these things called her a
[1:31:17] dog you got read the scripture but her
[1:31:20] faith looked beyond those things
[1:31:22] &gt;&gt; he knew her faith
[1:31:25] &gt;&gt; he said truth Lord but even the even the
[1:31:28] dogs get the crumbs under the table so
[1:31:30] she came cuz faith brings a humility
[1:31:33] faith does not get offended amen faith
[1:31:36] brings a real humility she said Lord
[1:31:37] I'll take anything I can get amen I know
[1:31:40] I just get crumb. Hallelujah. And
[1:31:42] because that crumb's part of the whole
[1:31:44] loaf, I get the whole loaf. Amen. A part
[1:31:46] of his word is all of his word. Amen.
[1:31:48] One promise is all of his promises. I
[1:31:50] put it that way because it's all
[1:31:51] connected. It's the same thing. It's not
[1:31:53] a disconnected thing. Amen. And what
[1:31:55] happened? He said, "Oh woman, great is
[1:31:57] thy faith. Be it unto thee, even as thou
[1:32:00] wilt."
[1:32:01] &gt;&gt; She got her answer.
[1:32:03] &gt;&gt; Cuz faith does not know problems.
[1:32:07] &gt;&gt; Faith doesn't know hindrances. You may
[1:32:08] be hindered, but your faith won't be
[1:32:10] hindered.
[1:32:11] &gt;&gt; Amen. You can go, she had many
[1:32:12] hindrances, but her faith didn't have
[1:32:14] any. I mean, you might have a lot of
[1:32:15] hindrances. Who looks at hindrances? We
[1:32:18] need to look beyond a hindrance.
[1:32:20] &gt;&gt; I'm tired. I can't do this. I'm busy.
[1:32:23] All these kind of No, let's look beyond
[1:32:24] those things. Faith goes through those
[1:32:27] things. I think faith is a bulldozer.
[1:32:29] &gt;&gt; It just plows through. Hallelujah.
[1:32:32] There's a big rock or a big log or a big
[1:32:34] excuse in the way. Plowed.
[1:32:37] You've got to let it plow through.
[1:32:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. Every person that starts out to
[1:32:42] meet Christ will find a lot of
[1:32:44] hindrances, but your faith don't have
[1:32:45] any. Faith don't have no hindrances.
[1:32:47] Faith has hairs on its chest, great big
[1:32:49] muscles. Reason rises up and says, you
[1:32:51] know, it's reasonable. Faith puts its
[1:32:53] muscles out, sticks out its big chest,
[1:32:55] says, "Shut up. Sit down." And reason
[1:32:57] jumps over in the corner and takes a
[1:32:58] stool. Amen. Faith has got muscles. He
[1:33:01] means what he says. That's what we need
[1:33:03] tonight. That's what the four square
[1:33:04] church needs. what that what the
[1:33:05] Pentecostal group needs. It's what the
[1:33:07] whole world needs. What I need, it's
[1:33:08] what you need. We ought to be ashamed to
[1:33:10] admit it. But we need a faith that will
[1:33:12] hold on to God's word. Say it's true.
[1:33:14] Meet the devil and say, "Thus sayith the
[1:33:15] Lord." And we got to cast down
[1:33:17] reasoning. Amen. Reasoning is not
[1:33:20] reasonable compared to faith. No. Faith
[1:33:22] declares a promise and we keep the
[1:33:23] promise. And we're not willing to back
[1:33:25] up with anything else. You say, "Well,
[1:33:27] I'm weak in faith. I don't have a lot."
[1:33:28] I tell you what, you just start taking
[1:33:30] God's word and start swinging it. Amen.
[1:33:33] You may just be able to cut a little bit
[1:33:34] with those weak faith muscles just to be
[1:33:36] justified. You've made a hole. Amen.
[1:33:38] Then then you get a bit more strength
[1:33:40] because the more you use something, you
[1:33:41] develop those muscles. When you take God
[1:33:43] at your take God at his word, you're
[1:33:45] developing faith. You're letting it
[1:33:46] grow. Those faith muscles get stronger.
[1:33:48] Then you swing again. You get
[1:33:49] sanctified. You've cut a bigger hole.
[1:33:51] It's bigger than the first dog. Why?
[1:33:53] Because you're getting stronger. Amen.
[1:33:54] Then you cut again. You cut through to
[1:33:56] the baptism of the Holy Ghost. I mean,
[1:33:57] you cut a real big hole. I mean, you
[1:33:59] step through that hole. Then you step
[1:34:00] into every divine promise. And every
[1:34:02] enemy that comes against you once you've
[1:34:04] gone through there, you just start
[1:34:05] cutting them down and cutting them down.
[1:34:07] Like Caleb said about the giants in the
[1:34:09] land, they're bred for us. They're going
[1:34:10] to be our daily food, our sustenance.
[1:34:12] It's going to make us strong. I mean, so
[1:34:14] when an enemy comes against you,
[1:34:15] sickness, depression, trouble, anxiety,
[1:34:18] spirits, whatever it is, you got to
[1:34:19] realize this thing is a is a target
[1:34:22] dummy to make me strong.
[1:34:25] &gt;&gt; Amen. This thing is to develop my faith
[1:34:27] muscles. It's not to It's not here to
[1:34:30] destroy me. I'm actually here to destroy
[1:34:32] it. Amen. That when I destroy it, I
[1:34:34] become stronger. I believe the Lord more
[1:34:36] and more stable. Amen. I'm not troubled
[1:34:37] no more as I used to be. I can take God
[1:34:39] at his word more. I've got greater
[1:34:41] confidence in him. Amen. Why? Because
[1:34:43] faith muscles have been developed.
[1:34:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. Oh, but you don't know where I've
[1:34:47] come from. Don't matter where you come
[1:34:49] from. It don't matter what you've done.
[1:34:51] &gt;&gt; I mean, faith realizes that everything
[1:34:54] is under the blood. Amen. Faith realizes
[1:34:56] he took our guilt, our shame, our pain,
[1:34:58] our past. Oh, but I should have known
[1:35:00] better. I willfully did it. Faith
[1:35:01] declares it's under the blood.
[1:35:03] &gt;&gt; Amen. Faith declares there's no
[1:35:05] condemnation that they're in Christ
[1:35:06] Jesus. Amen. Faith declares it. Amen.
[1:35:09] Faith declares you're as righteous as
[1:35:10] Jesus Christ is righteous. Oh, what
[1:35:12] right do you have to take the word?
[1:35:14] Faith declares you have the right.
[1:35:17] &gt;&gt; Amen. He would not have put a faith in
[1:35:19] your heart. Amen. Unless he wanted you
[1:35:20] to use it.
[1:35:22] He didn't give you something say, "Oh,
[1:35:24] look at this and isn't it neat?" No, he
[1:35:25] wants it to go into action in your life.
[1:35:28] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:35:30] &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm just going to finish with a
[1:35:33] couple things, then we're going to
[1:35:36] maybe we'll jump to this.
[1:35:39] God heals him many ways. Praise the
[1:35:42] Lord. I'm glad he's not a one hit
[1:35:44] wonder. Actually, no. He is forget that.
[1:35:48] I'm glad he does things in different
[1:35:50] ways. I'll say it that way because he is
[1:35:51] a one hit wonder. Amen. Meet the Lord.
[1:35:54] Seal the day of your redemption. That's
[1:35:56] the one hit. Then you become a wonder.
[1:35:59] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[1:36:01] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, now God heals in many ways.
[1:36:03] Now, this is faith in faith in action.
[1:36:05] Cuz sometimes if we just, you know, if
[1:36:07] we have such a narrow mind, God has to
[1:36:08] do a miracle and that's it. Or God has
[1:36:11] to do it this way and that's it. No, no.
[1:36:13] We got to let God use what he wants to
[1:36:15] use.
[1:36:16] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, God heals in many ways. The
[1:36:19] doctor asked me not long ago, "What is
[1:36:20] your opinion of medicine, Brother
[1:36:21] Brandham?" I said, "Well, God is the
[1:36:23] only one that can heal, sir." I said,
[1:36:25] "The Bible don't lie, and the Bible
[1:36:26] said, "I'm the Lord that heals all all
[1:36:28] your diseases." And I said, "The Bible
[1:36:30] can't lie." I said, "God heals by
[1:36:31] medicine. God heals by love. God heals
[1:36:34] by understanding. God heals by care. God
[1:36:37] heals by prayer. God heals by miracles.
[1:36:39] The whole thing, God heals. That's all."
[1:36:42] So, you got something in your life or in
[1:36:44] your family. God wants to heal by care.
[1:36:48] That's your faith going into action. Oh,
[1:36:50] but I'm praying God's going to do
[1:36:51] something and you're his instrument in
[1:36:53] the in the situation.
[1:36:56] Oh, I pray God really work in my family.
[1:36:58] You're there.
[1:37:00] &gt;&gt; Let him live through you. Oh, this is
[1:37:02] too natural. No, things are more
[1:37:04] supernatural than you realize.
[1:37:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. Every hero of faith in the Bible
[1:37:09] realized, Lord, I'm here for the job.
[1:37:10] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:37:13] &gt;&gt; God could have stepped into Egypt
[1:37:14] himself and delivered Israel. He says,
[1:37:17] "Moses, I'm sending you."
[1:37:20] &gt;&gt; He could have pulled up Rahab and her
[1:37:22] family out of Jericho and dropped her
[1:37:24] out of Jericho before it was destroyed.
[1:37:26] He sent two spies in.
[1:37:28] &gt;&gt; He gave her a token.
[1:37:30] &gt;&gt; She had to put her faith into action.
[1:37:32] &gt;&gt; Right. Oh, but I'm waiting for God to do
[1:37:34] something. He's waiting on you most of
[1:37:35] the time. I'm talking about myself, too.
[1:37:38] God's waiting on us to step out and take
[1:37:40] him at his word.
[1:37:41] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, God heals by prayer. God heals
[1:37:44] by go, you know, by miracles. The whole
[1:37:46] thing is God. He heals by understanding.
[1:37:48] See, many times what happens is
[1:37:50] frustration is the result of we don't
[1:37:52] understand a way forward.
[1:37:55] Isn't it? People get, "Oh, why is why is
[1:37:57] my son this way? Why is my daughter this
[1:37:58] way? Why is the economics why why is
[1:38:00] this going on?" If you had wisdom, if
[1:38:03] God gave you wisdom about the situation,
[1:38:05] you wouldn't be frustrated,
[1:38:07] &gt;&gt; right? Because you can see now a way
[1:38:09] forward. You see the way of escape. But
[1:38:11] there's always frustration comes because
[1:38:12] we don't see the way out. Well, then
[1:38:14] what do you do? Lord, show me
[1:38:17] how I should be in this situation
[1:38:19] &gt;&gt; because your promises are true. Show me
[1:38:22] how you can use my faith that that
[1:38:23] promise comes to pass.
[1:38:26] Praise the Lord. All of all uh all there
[1:38:28] is to it. He is the healer. Uh we
[1:38:31] haven't got a medicine that can create
[1:38:32] and create a cell in your hand to heal.
[1:38:34] Create in your body to heal. We can uh
[1:38:36] move a tooth. We can cut out an
[1:38:38] appendix, take out a gallbladder. But
[1:38:39] who healed? God. No medicine will build
[1:38:41] tissue, only God. Life builds tissue.
[1:38:43] God is the only healer. And we're
[1:38:45] talking on that.
[1:38:47] &gt;&gt; But then now also he says he look the
[1:38:50] right mental attitude towards any divine
[1:38:52] promise will bring it to pass.
[1:38:54] Faith gives you the right mental
[1:38:56] attitude.
[1:38:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. I've never seen someone who's got
[1:38:59] a revelation of a promise that's talking
[1:39:01] down.
[1:39:02] &gt;&gt; Remember unbelief or frustration will
[1:39:05] speak negative. That's why we must never
[1:39:07] confess negative. Amen. We must always
[1:39:10] confess positive and faith declares the
[1:39:12] promise. He doesn't declare the
[1:39:14] circumstance. Amen. It's like, you know,
[1:39:16] like like David wasn't declaring Goliath
[1:39:20] being Goliath. He just declared, "You
[1:39:21] going down, boy."
[1:39:22] &gt;&gt; I mean, cuz faith declared your head's
[1:39:24] mine.
[1:39:25] &gt;&gt; Amen. And that's what faith declares. It
[1:39:27] doesn't look at the circumstance. Don't
[1:39:28] be caught up in your You say, "But it's
[1:39:30] so real." Yeah, I know. But faith is
[1:39:32] more real cuz faith is eternal. Amen.
[1:39:35] These things are temporal. Amen. You got
[1:39:37] to realize when you're in a trial it can
[1:39:38] feel so real. When you step out the
[1:39:40] other side just becomes a memory.
[1:39:42] &gt;&gt; Well, was it real? No, it came and went.
[1:39:46] Eternal things are real. The word is the
[1:39:48] only real thing. All these things are
[1:39:51] temporal. I mean, there'll come a time
[1:39:53] where where even this country will, you
[1:39:55] know, if time would go on, this country
[1:39:57] how it is will not be how it is. It will
[1:39:58] be a memory. Who's ever gone back to
[1:40:00] their childhood home?
[1:40:03] &gt;&gt; Is it exactly the same as you left?
[1:40:07] because it was temporal.
[1:40:09] &gt;&gt; Oh, but my memory of it so real and so
[1:40:11] vivid. That's fine. But it's a temporal
[1:40:13] place, right? But the word is eternal.
[1:40:16] And so faith is the only real thing.
[1:40:20] &gt;&gt; Revelation is the only real thing
[1:40:21] because it's fixed. It's eternal. It
[1:40:23] doesn't it doesn't, you know, move with
[1:40:25] time. It's it's constant.
[1:40:29] &gt;&gt; That's why it's always important to have
[1:40:31] the right mental attitude towards
[1:40:32] towards any divine promise.
[1:40:35] Never think negative. Never let a doubt
[1:40:37] come into you. Blast that doubt out with
[1:40:39] the dumbbellar shotgun of the word.
[1:40:41] Amen. You destroy that thing. You watch
[1:40:42] it go to a million pieces. You blast
[1:40:44] that thing out. Never ever let that
[1:40:46] thing roost in you.
[1:40:48] &gt;&gt; Every divine promise is for you. Let's
[1:40:50] just say that. Every divine promise is
[1:40:52] mine. Every
[1:40:54] &gt;&gt; Amen. Every divine promise is mine.
[1:40:56] &gt;&gt; Every divine promise is
[1:40:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. You don't need to repeat this
[1:40:59] anymore. It's yours.
[1:41:00] &gt;&gt; Oh, yeah. It's for him. No, it's for
[1:41:02] you.
[1:41:03] &gt;&gt; Amen. And so I'm going to wind this up
[1:41:05] real quick. Okay. Now, this is from the
[1:41:07] Amplified um Bible version. For if we in
[1:41:10] Christ Jesus, neither circumcision or
[1:41:12] uncircumcision means anything, but only
[1:41:14] faith activated and expressed and
[1:41:16] working through love. Faith workketh by
[1:41:19] love. It says in the King James, "But
[1:41:21] only faith activated and expressed and
[1:41:23] working through love." That's what
[1:41:25] works.
[1:41:26] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, you got to let your faith be
[1:41:27] activated and expressed and worked
[1:41:29] through love. That's why you got to have
[1:41:31] a divine love. Never get a fussy
[1:41:33] negative attitude towards anybody. Love
[1:41:36] everybody. Have a right mental attitude.
[1:41:38] Amen. Because you'll see that that power
[1:41:40] will bring a resurrection.
[1:41:43] Brother Bram told the story of the
[1:41:44] little lady, you know, you know, the
[1:41:46] mother with the baby who died in Mexico
[1:41:48] that morning. They're having a meeting.
[1:41:50] You know, she she she took him to the
[1:41:52] doctor. The baby was pronounced dead.
[1:41:55] But faith began to move in that in that
[1:41:58] Catholic woman's heart. She had a
[1:42:00] revelation. If I can just get my baby to
[1:42:02] that man, that preacher man. Amen. God
[1:42:05] is going to bring the baby's life back.
[1:42:07] So that was in the morning. She was
[1:42:09] carrying that baby dead form all day
[1:42:11] under a blanket. She got into the
[1:42:12] meeting. She couldn't get a prayer card.
[1:42:14] But faith does not look at
[1:42:16] circumstances. It looks at the promise.
[1:42:19] Amen. So what did she do? She was
[1:42:20] pushing through all the ushers she
[1:42:22] could. Imagine imagine a little Mexican
[1:42:23] lady holding a baby trying to push men
[1:42:25] out of the way, causing a disturbance.
[1:42:27] She didn't care what what was the
[1:42:30] trouble she was causing in the church.
[1:42:32] Amen. She didn't see fa. When faith gets
[1:42:35] a hold, you begin to praise God. You're
[1:42:36] not conscious of what is happening
[1:42:38] around you. You're not worried about,
[1:42:40] oh, I'm going to upset this person. No,
[1:42:41] cuz faith has got a hold and you're
[1:42:43] worshiping God. Amen. And it's in that
[1:42:46] kind of an atmosphere, I mean, God can
[1:42:48] begin to work. So, there she was pushing
[1:42:49] users out of the way, causing a whole
[1:42:51] whole big ruckus there in the meeting.
[1:42:53] But she was determined. I must get my
[1:42:56] baby to that man. And then so finally,
[1:42:58] you know, there's a, you know, um, this
[1:43:00] is all going on. And then, and then
[1:43:02] Brother Bram actually said to Jack
[1:43:03] Moore, well, you go pray for the baby
[1:43:05] because she doesn't know who I am. And,
[1:43:08] you know, just to calm her down and all
[1:43:09] these things. But then, but then the
[1:43:10] prophet saw a vision of the baby coming
[1:43:13] back to life. What did that? It was her
[1:43:15] faith.
[1:43:16] &gt;&gt; Her faith brought that baby back to
[1:43:18] life. It wasn't the prophet's faith.
[1:43:20] Faith. It was her faith. Amen. So, what
[1:43:22] happened is she came forward. Now she's
[1:43:23] saying all the Catholic things, padre
[1:43:25] and all these things and rosaries and
[1:43:27] all these things being a Catholic but no
[1:43:30] but you know he said stand up don't do
[1:43:32] that you know and then what did he do he
[1:43:34] put he he he put his hand on the little
[1:43:36] fellow Amen and God showed a vision
[1:43:38] there and that mother's love had touched
[1:43:40] you in some way why faith is activated
[1:43:45] by love
[1:43:47] amen what the the the mother's love
[1:43:50] touched the Lord
[1:43:52] &gt;&gt; Amen Amen. And what it do? That baby let
[1:43:54] out a big squeal, started screaming at
[1:43:56] top of the voice. I mean, woman faded
[1:43:58] everything. That little baby was was
[1:44:00] restored back to life by Jehovah God who
[1:44:02] felt the love of that mother pressing
[1:44:04] for her baby. Certainly, it was.
[1:44:07] &gt;&gt; If God can do that through a Catholic
[1:44:09] lady,
[1:44:10] &gt;&gt; can he not do it through you and I? Can
[1:44:12] he not bring a resurrection? You say,
[1:44:14] "Well, my my family's dead in trespasses
[1:44:16] and sins." I tell you what, let your
[1:44:18] love touch the throne of God. I mean
[1:44:20] that divine love touch the throne of God
[1:44:22] and they may be far away in the world
[1:44:23] somewhere God will begin to work. I mean
[1:44:25] God will begin to call them.
[1:44:27] &gt;&gt; I say no it can't work. Yes it can.
[1:44:30] Amen. Yes it can. Amen. If a woman can
[1:44:32] bring her baby back to life by love
[1:44:34] touching the throne of God. How much
[1:44:35] more you and I with a revelation of
[1:44:37] faith that God is present. God is able.
[1:44:39] Amen. God is here to meet every need.
[1:44:41] Amen. Can we not Amen. touch the throne
[1:44:44] of God and God can do the impossible.
[1:44:47] &gt;&gt; Amen. Because faith does the impossible.
[1:44:49] Amen. And that impossible doing faith is
[1:44:52] in you and I this morning. So I say
[1:44:54] friends, let's put our faith into
[1:44:56] action. Amen. Don't be afraid of
[1:44:58] nothing. Don't stand back. No. Faith
[1:44:59] presses the battle. Amen. We're not here
[1:45:01] to push back for the devil and say,
[1:45:03] "Well, we're just going to live this way
[1:45:04] and this is how it is." No. Push
[1:45:05] forward. Amen. Take God in his word and
[1:45:08] let God put a revelation in your heart
[1:45:10] and then let that revelation live out of
[1:45:12] your life and you'll see the impossible
[1:45:14] be done.
[1:45:15] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:45:16] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We could, you know, we could
[1:45:17] think about, oh my Robin with that tumor
[1:45:18] in her throat. Impossible for it to
[1:45:21] disappear. But she surrendered her life
[1:45:23] to the Lord's hands. Lord, if I live or
[1:45:25] if I die, I'm in your hands. She got
[1:45:27] anointed with oil and prayed for her and
[1:45:28] God made that tumor disappear.
[1:45:30] &gt;&gt; Amen. What? God did the impossible.
[1:45:34] &gt;&gt; How many other things do we have?
[1:45:35] Impossible things that have happened in
[1:45:37] life. Why? Because faith has been put
[1:45:39] into action.
[1:45:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's stand to our feet this
[1:45:42] morning, shall we? Let's have the
[1:45:43] musicians this morning. But I encourage
[1:45:45] you this morning, friends, let God use
[1:45:47] your faith and put it into action, and
[1:45:49] you'll see the supernatural be done.
[1:45:52] Amen. You'll see impossible things
[1:45:53] happen.
[1:45:55] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:45:58] Amen. Praise the Lord.
[1:45:59] &gt;&gt; Aren't you glad? He's a miracle working
[1:46:01] God. He heals by many different ways.
[1:46:03] Amen. He There's no case too hard. You
[1:46:06] say, "Well, we just got to let let the
[1:46:08] natural things run its course." No, we
[1:46:10] don't. God interrupts nature. He made
[1:46:12] it. Amen. And you say, "Well, this
[1:46:14] healing is going to be this way. This
[1:46:15] has got to happen this way." No. Let God
[1:46:17] do it his way.
[1:46:18] &gt;&gt; Amen. We'll see incredible things

[1:52:11] The faith that those four friends had,
[1:52:14] Lord, their friend into your presence,
[1:52:16] Lord, I believe the same faith is in us,
[1:52:18] Lord God. The same faith that the
[1:52:20] Sirenian woman had is the same faith in
[1:52:22] us. The same faith, Lord, in the
[1:52:24] centurion, I believe is the same faith
[1:52:26] in us, my God. I pray, dear God, that
[1:52:28] you we would allow you to work like
[1:52:30] never before in our lives, to take you
[1:52:32] at your word, Lord. Every divine promise
[1:52:34] is ours, my God. Father, we want to act
[1:52:37] on faith now, Lord Jesus. May you touch
[1:52:39] each one here, Lord. Father, I pray Lord
[1:52:41] God that we'd look beyond what the five
[1:52:43] senses declare. Lord, may we look beyond
[1:52:46] our scenario, what we're going through,
[1:52:47] the circumstances of life. And dear God,
[1:52:50] may we look to your divine promises,
[1:52:52] Father. Lord, in the name of Jesus
[1:52:54] Christ, I pray, dear God, you touch each
[1:52:55] life here, Father. Lord, may they may we
[1:52:58] all realize it's an individual walk
[1:52:59] between, Lord, with us and you, Lord.
[1:53:01] It's not a group thing. It's not even a
[1:53:03] family thing. It's us and you together.
[1:53:05] So, Lord, may we realize that and may we
[1:53:07] just walk in faith like never before,
[1:53:09] Father. They're not waiting for anyone
[1:53:10] else to do anything but but may we act
[1:53:12] upon your word, Father, according to
[1:53:14] your riches and glory. I pray you bless
[1:53:16] each one, fill each one with the Holy
[1:53:17] Ghost, Lord. Touch the sick in our
[1:53:19] midst, Father, both here and Lord, who
[1:53:21] are streaming, Lord. May you continue to
[1:53:23] be our abundant portion in Jesus
[1:53:25] Christ's name. We thank you, Lord. Amen.
[1:53:28] Amen. God bless you. Amen.

[1:59:57] been many things in life that have made
[2:00:01] us disappointed, Lord, that have let us
[2:00:03] down that we've There's many things
[2:00:04] we've had confidence in, even down to
[2:00:07] things we may buy to try and do a job
[2:00:08] and it the the thing doesn't work the
[2:00:10] way that it should, Lord, and we it
[2:00:12] didn't work the way it should or or
[2:00:14] someone wasn't somewhere when they said
[2:00:15] they would be there or we weren't given
[2:00:17] something when we said we would be given
[2:00:19] it or things like that, Lord. But we
[2:00:22] don't have that problem with you and
