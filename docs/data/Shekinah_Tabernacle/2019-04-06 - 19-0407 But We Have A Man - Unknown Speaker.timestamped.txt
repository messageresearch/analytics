[49:21] him and we should come together in
[49:24] judgment neither is there any daysan
[49:26] betwix us that may lay that might lay
[49:30] his hand upon us both let him take his
[49:33] Rod away from me let not his fear
[49:35] terrify me then would I speak and not

[49:44] we're turning to Revelations chapter 5
[49:45] when he says a d uh betwix us a a daysan
[49:50] is a it's a it's a very old English word
[49:53] but it means a a umpire or an arbitus or

[50:00] no man but we have a man amen hallelujah

[50:09] Revelations 5
[50:11] And1 amen just as a bit of a a bit of a
[50:13] context here we're going to read um some
[50:16] of the
[50:17] scripture Revelations 5 And1 so it says
[50:20] here um and I
[50:22] saw just go here and I saw in the right
[50:25] hand of him that sat on the Throne a
[50:27] book written within and on the backside
[50:28] sealed with Seven Seals and I saw a
[50:31] strong angel proclaiming with a loud
[50:33] voice saying who is worthy to open the
[50:35] book and to loose the seals thereof and
[50:38] no man in heaven neither in Earth
[50:40] neither under the Earth was able to open
[50:41] the book neither to look thereon and I
[50:45] wept much because no man was found
[50:47] worthy to open and to read the book
[50:49] neither to look thereon and one of the
[50:51] elders saith unto me weep not Behold The
[50:53] Lion of the tribe of Judah the root of
[50:56] David hath prevailed to open the book
[50:58] and to loose the Seven Seals thereof and
[51:01] I beheld in low in the midst of the
[51:03] Throne of the four beasts in the midst
[51:04] of the elders stood a lamb as it had
[51:06] been slain having seven horns and seven
[51:09] eyes which are the seven spirits of God
[51:11] sent forth into all the Earth and he
[51:13] came and he took the book out of the
[51:15] right hand of him that sat upon the
[51:17] throne and when he had taken the book
[51:20] The Four beasts and the 4 and20 Elders
[51:22] fell down before the lamb having every
[51:24] one of them Harps and golden vials full
[51:26] of odors which are the prayers of saints
[51:29] and they sang a new song saying Thou Art
[51:32] Worthy to take the book and to open the
[51:34] seals thereof for thou was slain and has
[51:37] redeemed us to God by thy blood out of
[51:40] every Kindred tongue people and Nation
[51:43] now let's just drop down to verse 13 and
[51:46] every creature which is in heaven and on
[51:49] the earth and under the Earth and such
[51:52] is in the sea and all that are in them
[51:54] heard I saying now John not weeping no
[51:57] more there's a change saying blessing
[52:00] and honor and glory and power be unto
[52:03] him that sth upon the throne and unto
[52:06] the lamb forever and ever and the four
[52:08] Beast said amen and the 4 and20 Elders
[52:11] fell down and worshiped him that liveth
[52:14] forever amen may the Lord bless his word
[52:16] this morning you you may have your
[52:18] seats I want to speak on a subject if I
[52:21] could take one where we heard brother
[52:24] cin uh speaking on Wednesday
[52:27] and he made a statement which which um
[52:29] triggered this whole thought he said
[52:31] speaking of Daniel and the Lion's Den he
[52:33] said you know Daniel normally people are
[52:36] men are thrown into Lion's dens and
[52:38] normally that's the end conclusion you
[52:40] know the person gets eaten but he says
[52:42] these words but we have a man amen amen
[52:44] and now we have a man this morning we're
[52:47] more than a prophet more than a priest
[52:49] amen more than a king but we have a man
[52:52] the Lord Jesus Christ Hallelujah so I
[52:55] want to you know job was saying here he
[52:58] said if he only had someone a daan
[53:01] betwix US between him and God if he only
[53:03] had a man that could Bridge the gulf
[53:06] then he says then would I speak and not
[53:08] fear Him amen so there has to come a you
[53:11] know we're living in the hour of the
[53:13] third pole we're living in the
[53:14] manifestation of the third pole and the
[53:17] power of the third pole we know the
[53:18] third pole is the opening of the word
[53:19] it's the revealing of Christ but there's
[53:21] a spoken word power that's being placed
[53:23] into the bride amen that is now coming
[53:26] into manifestation brother Bram says
[53:29] what you've seen manifested temporarily
[53:31] you see when that squeeze comes on it
[53:32] will be manifested in the fullness of
[53:34] its power and we know that the squeeze
[53:36] has come right we are living in a
[53:38] squeeze hour so if that is the case then
[53:41] the what you've seen manifested
[53:43] temporarily in the prophet's Ministry of
[53:45] the power of the spoken word will be
[53:47] manifested in the fullness of its power
[53:49] Amen in the bride of Christ so we have
[53:52] to come to a place where we are not
[53:53] afraid to speak am mean we are not
[53:56] afraid afid you know to you know you
[53:58] know to to you know we're not afraid to
[54:01] speak what the word says I mean we're
[54:03] not afraid to take our god-given rights
[54:05] amen but we have full confidence and
[54:07] full Assurance by the blood of Jesus
[54:09] Christ that we have a god-given right
[54:12] Amen to take God at his word amen and
[54:15] speak the word in faith Hallelujah
[54:17] because now as I said last Sunday the
[54:19] atmosphere we're going to have the
[54:21] atmosphere right amen and our words that
[54:23] we speak create an atmosphere yes amen
[54:26] amen I'll just take it very extreme you
[54:28] get up in the morning you look at your
[54:30] children and you begin to tell them
[54:32] they're useless you'll create an
[54:34] atmosphere and what does that create in
[54:36] your kids you they'll be upset they'll
[54:38] be broken they'll be hurt because the
[54:40] words that you're speaking brings an
[54:42] atmosphere it brings a spirit upon them
[54:44] and they'll begin to manifest well I'm
[54:46] useless Daddy doesn't love me he doesn't
[54:48] think I'm important what's happening in
[54:50] atmosphere is created by the words that
[54:52] are spoken amen so if that's on the
[54:54] negative how much more the positive amen
[54:57] where you know we have the story of you
[54:59] know brother baram you know he's in the
[55:00] woods and he's and he's pondering on
[55:03] about Mark 11 and we'll come to it maybe
[55:05] later in the service and he's wondering
[55:07] about how when when when Jesus says but
[55:09] if ye say to this mountain and do not
[55:12] doubt but believe what you know it shall
[55:14] and you say be thou removed and cast in
[55:16] the sea it shall be done and he's
[55:18] wondering what does this mean and so
[55:20] he's looking he's pondering Lord how
[55:22] does this work and then God just comes
[55:24] down says I'm going to show you that's
[55:26] right what do you have need of right you
[55:28] say well he didn't really need squirrels
[55:30] he wasn't starving but that triggered I
[55:33] mean faith and had he right to say the
[55:35] right thing at the right time and her
[55:38] two boys receive salvation because she
[55:40] believed am in the testimony of the
[55:42] Prophet right so Faith amen creates an
[55:46] atmosphere and that atmosphere amen is
[55:49] created that God can come down and do
[55:51] the supernatural am mean because we're
[55:53] more than just we don't just
[55:55] Christianity is a
[55:57] it's a manifestation of God hallelujah
[55:59] and we want to have the right atmosphere
[56:01] around us of faith I mean that God can
[56:03] come down and do the supernatural
[56:06] Hallelujah so that's where I want to go
[56:08] to we shouldn't be afraid to speak we
[56:10] shouldn't be afraid to say yes Lord I
[56:12] take you your word amen because remember
[56:14] we are not a downtrodden people we have
[56:17] a man that's bridged the gulf for you
[56:19] amen we have a man that is that has
[56:21] bridged the way has cleansed us of all
[56:22] sin am me his blood is washed us the
[56:25] bride is clean the bride is pure amen
[56:27] and I believe I'm looking at part of
[56:28] that bride this morning amen we're not
[56:30] saying will we make it we know we're
[56:32] going to make it amen we're not
[56:33] wondering are we're going to take a
[56:34] rapture we know Hallelujah because the
[56:37] Apostle Paul says that faith is the
[56:39] substance of things hoped for the
[56:42] evidence of things unseen now in the
[56:44] scripture the word hope is not like we
[56:46] would say hope is like when you say for
[56:48] example well I hope it's going to be
[56:49] sunny on the weekend you're just hoping
[56:51] it's a stab in the dark but Bible hope
[56:54] is an expectation with pleasure if you
[56:56] look at the definition It's actually an
[56:58] expectation with pleasure so faith is
[57:01] the substance of things expected the
[57:04] evidence of things unseen that's real
[57:06] faith I mean real faith is that actually
[57:08] puts you under expectation am mean that
[57:11] what God has promised you will come to
[57:13] pass Hallelujah so now that's why
[57:15] there's something in The Believer that's
[57:17] moved Hallelujah it says faith God the
[57:18] faith of God has come into us and now
[57:20] we're under expectation for a body
[57:22] change we're under expectation for a
[57:24] Rapture we're under expectation that God
[57:26] will bring our wayward ones home amen
[57:28] we'll save our families Hallelujah we'll
[57:30] heal our sick we'll raise the dead amen
[57:33] because faith has given us an
[57:34] expectation that it will happen
[57:37] Hallelujah that's why we're not W
[57:40] worried or
[57:41] wondering amen we should have an
[57:44] expectation Lord your word has promised
[57:46] it You' have provided the ability for it
[57:49] to happen you've given me the faith to
[57:52] believe it it's not my own human Faith
[57:54] No More the Apostle Paul PA said the
[57:56] life I now live I live by the faith of
[57:58] the Son of God see he's saying that the
[58:00] life I now live is not my faith it's the
[58:03] faith of the Son of God that's now in me
[58:05] that's now living Hallelujah and it's
[58:07] the same thing with you and I amen the
[58:09] life we now live what me and my little
[58:12] life yes the life you now live amen
[58:14] you're now living by the faith of the
[58:16] Son of God it's not your own Faith No
[58:18] More it's God's faith hallelujah
[58:21] hallelujah and if you have the faith of
[58:23] God God believed his own word when he
[58:25] said let there be sun MO moon and stars
[58:26] he had to believe what he said and it
[58:28] came to pass Hallelujah so now you you
[58:31] have that same faith in you amen so I
[58:33] just say let Faith have her work let her
[58:36] have her free reign take control faith
[58:39] amen I don't know what needs to be done
[58:41] but Lord You Take Control not my doubts
[58:43] not the devil's doubts I mean the devil
[58:46] you know the devil always tries to get
[58:47] you to live by his
[58:49] experience that's why he pours doubt
[58:51] into you cuz he doesn't really believe
[58:55] amen the the Bible says that the Devils
[58:57] believe and tremble but they don't
[58:58] believe like you believe they've just
[59:00] got a mental Faith like Judas didn't
[59:02] have a real Faith but the other Apostles
[59:04] did so the devil now to say well this is
[59:07] my experience I've got to give it to you
[59:08] and that's why he gives you doubt and
[59:10] questions and trouble and that's just
[59:11] the devil trying to pour that into you I
[59:14] just say no devil that's not my
[59:16] experience I got saved he touched me and
[59:19] made me whole I Am Redeemed by the blood
[59:21] of the Lamb saved from sin and I know I
[59:24] am not because some told me God told me
[59:28] hallelujah amen so we should not be in
[59:33] fear amen amen love should drive our
[59:37] walk Divine love why are you a Christian
[59:40] Divine love amen why do you serve him
[59:42] Divine love why do you live the way you
[59:44] live Divine love Hallelujah not because
[59:46] of fear I'm not afraid of God Amen I
[59:49] love him one time I did fear him because
[59:52] I was an alien from him I was actually
[59:53] his enemy the scripture said but then he
[59:55] came down amen and redeem me but I'm no
[59:58] longer his enemy Hallelujah I'm his
[1:00:00] bride Jes
[1:00:02] Hallelujah so we shouldn't Hallelujah
[1:00:05] friends we should just Rejoice yeah well

[1:00:09] trials Hallelujah just be happy amen the

[1:01:00] your bridegroom your husband Hallelujah
[1:01:02] there's no golf Hallelujah no more Amen
[1:01:06] brother Braham says this in the mighty
[1:01:07] conqueror I just love this he says great
[1:01:09] victories have been won many of us today
[1:01:12] can remember well of the first World
[1:01:16] War I remember when I was just a little
[1:01:18] boy I can hear the whistles blowing and
[1:01:20] even the farmers in the field sto their
[1:01:22] horses wave their hats they scream they
[1:01:24] hollered what had happen happened the
[1:01:26] war was over victory was won the great
[1:01:28] economy that we were fighting for
[1:01:30] finally they won the victory I'm
[1:01:32] thinking of this last World War I live
[1:01:34] just across the street and when the
[1:01:35] whistles begin to blow people run into
[1:01:37] the yards woman with their aprons on
[1:01:39] taking them off swinging them in the air
[1:01:41] bullets flying through the trees
[1:01:42] whistles blowed cars raced through the
[1:01:44] streets people fell on their knees
[1:01:46] raised up their hands they screamed they
[1:01:47] cried why because the war was over and
[1:01:50] the Blessed ones the dear boys that was
[1:01:52] across the sea would be soon be sailing
[1:01:54] home again to them what if Victory what
[1:01:56] a time what a thrill to any heart what a
[1:01:58] jubilee that night everybody was in such
[1:02:01] a humor you could have walked into a
[1:02:03] restaurant eat walked down and not paid
[1:02:05] for it it would have been all right you
[1:02:06] could have used the next man's car it
[1:02:08] would have been all right you could have
[1:02:10] asked uh what you wanted to and probably
[1:02:12] would have got it because why the
[1:02:13] victory was one the boys was coming home
[1:02:16] it was all over and I'm thinking my
[1:02:18] brother it's too bad that those kind of
[1:02:20] feelings can't stay all the time but to
[1:02:22] the Christian this morning the victory
[1:02:24] is won Joy Bells Are Ringing the war is
[1:02:27] over between God and man the victory's
[1:02:29] been won before any Victory can be won
[1:02:32] there's got to be great prices paid oh
[1:02:34] what prices sometimes they're very deep
[1:02:37] amen they make great scars tearing down
[1:02:40] but in order to have the mountain you've
[1:02:41] got to have the valley before you have
[1:02:43] the sunshine you've got to get the rain
[1:02:45] before You' get the have the light
[1:02:47] you've got to have the night before we
[1:02:49] have right we have to be uh they have to
[1:02:52] have wrong or you never would have known
[1:02:53] what wrong was but in order to conqu
[1:02:56] and to win the greatest battle that was
[1:02:58] ever won one stepped out of Glory many
[1:03:00] years ago he did not take upon himself
[1:03:03] the form of an Angel he did not come as
[1:03:05] some great person but he was going to
[1:03:07] prove that didn't take muskets and
[1:03:09] bullets and atomic bombs to win a war he
[1:03:11] closed himself in humility like a little
[1:03:13] baby and was born in a manger there was
[1:03:15] not even a place for his birth when he
[1:03:17] come I want you to look at the different
[1:03:19] material of warfare that he used now
[1:03:22] Adam's race was all in bondage they were
[1:03:24] without hope without God without chance
[1:03:26] without Mercy without anything that
[1:03:27] could help him we were in this condition
[1:03:30] am mean the great enemies of the lower
[1:03:31] regions of the Lost had been shut up in
[1:03:33] darkness there was not a way out there
[1:03:35] was no one could help nothing could be
[1:03:37] done it looked like a total complete
[1:03:40] loss but our hero Hallelujah who came
[1:03:43] down from the portal portals of Glory

[1:03:48] the one who who who wins the World Cup

[1:04:21] grave one day A man was 4 days dead he
[1:04:24] said Lazarus come forth and if he didn't
[1:04:26] use to call him by name there would have
[1:04:28] been a general Resurrection Hallelujah

[1:04:33] my hero raises the dead I mean my hero
[1:04:36] redeems he heals he saves that's my hero
[1:04:40] I trust he's your hero this morning
[1:04:42] Hallelujah and he is not hasn't changed
[1:04:45] one iota he may not be in his Corporal
[1:04:48] body amen but his spirit is still upon
[1:04:50] the Earth his word is still here to do
[1:04:52] what he promised it would do Hallelujah

[1:04:58] Christ Hallelujah he's my hero today
[1:05:02] Hallelujah trust he
[1:05:04] yours amen but our hero who came down
[1:05:07] from the portals of Glory condescending
[1:05:09] down for there was no man on earth that
[1:05:11] could do the job they are all as worldly
[1:05:14] speaking in the same boat we all were
[1:05:16] born in sin shaped in iniquity come to
[1:05:17] the world speaking lies you can turn
[1:05:19] that down a B brother Aman and none of
[1:05:21] us could help each other we stood
[1:05:23] helpless defeated Chaos on every hand
[1:05:25] all ununited we could not keep the laws
[1:05:27] and ceremonies finding their weaknesses
[1:05:29] and so forth we could not we could not
[1:05:31] do it and it seemed like the whole human
[1:05:33] race was laid waste hallelujah what a
[1:05:36] state we were once in that state friends
[1:05:40] Hallelujah we were born in that state
[1:05:42] doesn't matter how good the family you
[1:05:43] were born into doesn't matter how moral
[1:05:45] whatever it was amen we were all born in
[1:05:47] this way Hallelujah but then he came
[1:05:51] Hall but we have a man Hallelujah he
[1:05:54] came because he was in the beginning the
[1:05:56] Bible said he was the word he was the
[1:05:58] logos that went out of God and the logos
[1:06:00] in the beginning was the word he became
[1:06:02] the word and when he ascended up on that
[1:06:05] glorious day of Easter he became not
[1:06:08] only the word but he became the high
[1:06:10] priest of his own word oh what a
[1:06:12] glorious thing he says brother Neville
[1:06:14] just think he's not only the word but
[1:06:16] he's the high priest of his own word how
[1:06:19] could we doubt it how could we walk to
[1:06:21] him and not believe that we receive what
[1:06:24] we ask for remember he is the high
[1:06:26] priest of our profession which is our
[1:06:29] confession so you want God to work on
[1:06:31] your behalf you start confessing his
[1:06:33] word I mean you start taking him at his
[1:06:36] word and you start quoting his word back
[1:06:38] to him I mean then God the great high
[1:06:40] priest will act on your behalf amen but
[1:06:42] if you confess doubt and and and and be
[1:06:45] critical of one another and speak
[1:06:47] negative things he can't work with that
[1:06:50] you got to give God something to work
[1:06:51] with Hallelujah and the best thing for
[1:06:53] him to work with is his word
[1:06:56] Hallelujah don't you want to see his
[1:06:58] word be performed in your life I would
[1:07:00] start quoting his word start quoting
[1:07:02] what he says about you don't quote what
[1:07:04] the devil says about you quote what God
[1:07:07] has said about you that's the only thing
[1:07:09] worth quoting is what God has said about
[1:07:11] you if he says I'm sinless I am if he
[1:07:13] says I'm being redeemed I am if he says
[1:07:16] I've been washed by the blood then I am
[1:07:18] Hallelujah if he says I'm as righteous
[1:07:20] as he is righteous then I am Hallelujah
[1:07:23] I'd start quoting his word if he this is
[1:07:25] a more than a conqueror I am then I am I
[1:07:28] am
[1:07:29] Hallelujah glory to God that's what I
[1:07:32] would start quoting amen do you good
[1:07:34] well I don't feel like it just start
[1:07:35] quoting it just start quoting it
[1:07:39] Hallelujah you know there's that song um
[1:07:42] oh it's just escaped me oh take the name
[1:07:45] of Jesus with you child of sorrow and of
[1:07:47] Woe it will joy and come forgive you
[1:07:50] take it wherever you go I've had times
[1:07:52] in my life down in the dumps I start
[1:07:54] singing that I stay in the dumps
[1:07:57] Hallelujah Joy begins to come rejoicing
[1:07:59] starts happening why because take the
[1:08:01] name of Jesus with you amen hallelujah
[1:08:04] yes that's right you know negative
[1:08:06] thoughts are not Eternal thoughts amen
[1:08:08] they're going to come to an end so why
[1:08:11] think about them what's it going to do
[1:08:12] you it doesn't going to help you all
[1:08:14] much amen is I think I've asked before
[1:08:17] has worry ever helped anyone well then
[1:08:19] why worry has stress helped anyone then
[1:08:23] why stress amen you know
[1:08:26] if it hasn't helped anyone before it
[1:08:28] won't help anyone now has Faith helped
[1:08:31] anyone I don't have enough time to start
[1:08:33] there but has Faith helped anyone will
[1:08:35] it help you today will it continue to
[1:08:37] help you has has taking God his word
[1:08:40] helped anyone Hallelujah will they
[1:08:42] continue to help people today it just
[1:08:44] take him at his word amen
[1:08:47] hallelujah for he is the word and the
[1:08:49] intercessor of the word the logos became
[1:08:52] word the word made flesh and the same
[1:08:54] flesh that was his word received up into
[1:08:56] glory and now is the high priest making
[1:08:58] intercession by himself to his word
[1:09:01] that's what it takes that's the material
[1:09:03] that that the church has got what a
[1:09:04] weapon there's never been one like it he
[1:09:07] was the word and when he come he was
[1:09:09] born in a manger he came to use the
[1:09:11] weapon of Lov love to conquer the world
[1:09:14] not with army bullets not with machine
[1:09:15] guns pardon me uh and tanks but he come
[1:09:19] in a different manner he came in the
[1:09:21] form of love he was God's love one time
[1:09:24] as a little boy I used to think that
[1:09:26] Christ loved me and God hated me because
[1:09:29] Christ died for me but God had something
[1:09:31] against me but I come to find out that
[1:09:33] Christ is the very Heart Of God God so
[1:09:36] loved the world that he gave his only
[1:09:38] begotten son and whosoever believeth on
[1:09:40] him should not perish but should have
[1:09:42] eternal life now he come first to
[1:09:45] conquer and the thing that the devil had
[1:09:47] put in the world was hatred and he come
[1:09:49] to conquer hatred when we win our
[1:09:51] battles and so forth in the world's
[1:09:53] battles it always leaves continually a
[1:09:55] hat hatred because battles of that sort
[1:09:57] is of the enemy but Christ come with
[1:09:59] love to conquer hatred to love those who
[1:10:01] are unlovable he's talking about me amen
[1:10:05] he came with a different weapon he
[1:10:06] humbled himself made a little L than the
[1:10:08] angels to suffer death and to give an
[1:10:10] example and when he was here on Earth he
[1:10:13] walked among men Hallelujah glory to God
[1:10:17] he says in an absolute he says God is
[1:10:19] watching over his word to vindicate it
[1:10:21] he's got to make it real he's got to
[1:10:23] make it act so God is watching ing over
[1:10:25] his word to make it live to make it act
[1:10:28] that's what he's doing that's what he's
[1:10:29] wanting to do in our lives he's watching
[1:10:31] over his word that atmosphere of faith
[1:10:34] will be produced amen that we'll begin
[1:10:36] to speak it amen that God will come down
[1:10:38] and perform it Hallelujah he says he
[1:10:41] says um that's the way God has brought
[1:10:44] his church from justification
[1:10:45] sanctification baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:10:47] and now the ministry of the spirit which
[1:10:49] is what quickens the word the ministry
[1:10:52] in the church will be just exactly like
[1:10:54] his that's why God is here to Quicken
[1:10:56] his word friends I just say Here I Am
[1:10:58] Lord Make It live in me Hallelujah just
[1:11:01] like this when my shadow hear of my hand
[1:11:03] if I never seen my hand seen the shadow
[1:11:06] but it gets pale and it gets away and a
[1:11:07] little and it gets a little closer and
[1:11:09] closer the negative and positive are
[1:11:10] coming together until they're both the
[1:11:12] same thing and that's exactly when the
[1:11:15] church and the word has to be one like
[1:11:18] Jesus and God was one just exactly God
[1:11:21] has was in Christ reconciling the world
[1:11:23] to himself and so will the will Christ
[1:11:26] have to be in the church the anointed of
[1:11:28] the word to make everything fulfilled
[1:11:30] and that's the Capstone that's to come
[1:11:32] upon the last day church not the lady OA
[1:11:35] now it's a calling out of that a bride
[1:11:36] out of a church uh uh in other words
[1:11:39] it's like he called a nation out of a
[1:11:41] nation in Egypt and now we're living in
[1:11:42] that day and we're grateful for these
[1:11:44] things that we have been seeing this is
[1:11:47] when God keeps his appointments in 1964
[1:11:49] so he says that the bride and and Christ
[1:11:51] will become one amen hallelujah l this
[1:11:55] is the day we're living now where are we
[1:11:57] can we go back here now he says here in
[1:11:59] Mark 7 we're just going to go through
[1:12:01] this very quickly cuz it's really
[1:12:03] amazing if you read through the gospels
[1:12:04] the order of the of the stories and God
[1:12:08] had it written in that way and when he
[1:12:11] had called unto all the people he said
[1:12:12] unto them hearken unto me every one of
[1:12:14] you and understand there is nothing from
[1:12:16] without a man that entering into him can
[1:12:19] defile him but the things which come out
[1:12:21] of him are those that defile the man if
[1:12:24] any man have to hear Let Him hear and
[1:12:28] when he was entering into the house from
[1:12:30] the people his disciples asked him
[1:12:32] concerning the parable and he saith unto
[1:12:34] them are you so without understanding
[1:12:36] also do you not perceive that whatsoever
[1:12:39] thing from without entereth into the man
[1:12:42] it cannot defile him because it entereth
[1:12:45] not into his heart but into his belly
[1:12:47] and it goth out into the draw purging
[1:12:49] all Meats now before this the Pharisees
[1:12:52] were criticizing saying why do the
[1:12:54] disciples wash with clean I mean eat
[1:12:55] with unclean hands so this is what that
[1:12:58] and this is so Jesus saying it's not the
[1:13:00] physical things that can defile it's
[1:13:02] what's in the heart that
[1:13:04] defiles and he said and he said that
[1:13:08] from that which cometh out of the man
[1:13:10] that defiled the man for uh for from
[1:13:13] within out of the heart of men proceedes
[1:13:15] evil thoughts adulteries fornications
[1:13:17] murders thefts covetousness wickedness
[1:13:19] deceit malicious uh maliciousness an
[1:13:23] evil eye blasphemy Pride full of fness
[1:13:25] all these evil things come from within
[1:13:28] and they defile the man that's an
[1:13:30] unconverted heart right there and then
[1:13:33] now but notice it goes straight into the
[1:13:34] story of the serap phenician woman now
[1:13:37] he's saying those things that come out
[1:13:39] of a man's heart defile I me but if the
[1:13:41] right things if the heart has been
[1:13:43] changed then when then the right things
[1:13:45] will come out as the Bible says you
[1:13:47] can't get sweet and bitter water out of
[1:13:49] the same well it's either sweet or it's
[1:13:51] bitter just like a tree you don't get
[1:13:53] grapes and and thorns out of the same
[1:13:56] tree right out of the same Vine you
[1:13:58] either it's either a thorn tree with
[1:14:00] thorns or a grape vine amen by their
[1:14:02] fruits you shall know them right so now
[1:14:05] here it is that so now here is this
[1:14:07] woman now he says for a certain woman
[1:14:10] whose young daughter had an unclean
[1:14:12] Spirit now I know I went through this
[1:14:13] last Sunday but I want to emphasize
[1:14:14] something very important heard of them
[1:14:16] and came and fell at his feet the woman
[1:14:18] was a Greek a serap phenician by nation
[1:14:21] and he besought him that he would cast
[1:14:22] forth the devil out of her daughter but
[1:14:24] Jesus said unto her let the children be
[1:14:26] first filled for it's not me to take
[1:14:28] children's bread and cast it unto the
[1:14:30] dogs and she answered and said unto him
[1:14:33] yes Lord yet the dogs under the table
[1:14:36] eat of the children's crumbs and he said
[1:14:39] unto her for this saying go thy way the
[1:14:42] devil has gone out of thy daughter and
[1:14:45] when she had come to her house she found
[1:14:47] the devil gone out and her daughter laid
[1:14:49] upon the bed so he says for this saying
[1:14:52] because you answered me in this way
[1:14:54] because you're approach was humble
[1:14:56] you're willing to take anything you
[1:14:57] could get I mean just a crumb was enough
[1:15:00] not the whole life just a crumb but she
[1:15:02] was willing just to take that little bit
[1:15:04] she was willing to take anything she
[1:15:06] could get amen that her daughter would
[1:15:08] be made well and then so he says for
[1:15:10] this saying go find her healed
[1:15:13] Hallelujah so that's why I'm emphasizing
[1:15:15] this it's very important what we say
[1:15:18] it's very important how we respond to
[1:15:20] the word am mean if we respond in a
[1:15:22] critical fashion you receive what the
[1:15:24] Pharisees rece
[1:15:25] amen damnation but if you come in able
[1:15:28] way saying yes Lord this is youen you
[1:15:30] receive God's reward which is eternal
[1:15:33] life Hallelujah so now you got to say
[1:15:36] now for this saying that's why when had
[1:15:38] WR brother Brown telling the testimony
[1:15:40] the squirrels and something just moved
[1:15:41] our heart saying that's nothing but the
[1:15:43] truth hallelujah then God came down for
[1:15:46] this saying and then God and then you
[1:15:48] know youo brother Ram said well God told
[1:15:50] Brother Ram ask her what you will and
[1:15:53] then and then the anointing is there and
[1:15:55] then and then and then the prophet
[1:15:56] saying ask what you will and and you'll
[1:15:58] have it you have a million dollars it'll
[1:16:00] fall on your lap the healing of your
[1:16:02] parents or sister or whatever and then
[1:16:04] now she's had he writes what should I
[1:16:06] ask for because God is waiting for a
[1:16:08] response but but then now she comes out
[1:16:11] the the most de thing upon her soul as
[1:16:13] the salvation of her boys and her boys
[1:16:16] were laughing making fun they weren't
[1:16:18] sitting there all Reverend believing
[1:16:19] what was going on they're just boys
[1:16:20] McKing around but because she said the
[1:16:23] right thing she says I want the
[1:16:24] salvation of my boys and he said you'll
[1:16:26] receive in the name of Jesus Christ and
[1:16:28] they receive their salvation because for
[1:16:30] this saying you shall receive it
[1:16:33] Hallelujah and that wasn't just done
[1:16:35] that we can say what a nice testimony
[1:16:36] God is trying to tell you amen the same
[1:16:39] Faith amen and what is happening in this
[1:16:41] hour will produce the same thing
[1:16:44] Hallelujah have you ever that's why you
[1:16:47] know that's why when you're fellowship
[1:16:49] with Believers you begin to talk about
[1:16:51] the Lord what happens the atmosphere
[1:16:53] begins to change God begins to come down
[1:16:56] what are my children talking about
[1:16:59] Hallelujah I want to have fellowship
[1:17:00] with them he enjoys being praised he
[1:17:03] enjoys being talked about Hallelujah he
[1:17:05] enjoys when we lift him up saying isn't
[1:17:07] he wonderful isn't he glorious he redeem
[1:17:10] me he saved me he's done this for me
[1:17:12] hallah then God comes down
[1:17:15] Hallelujah that's why we want to try
[1:17:17] live in that kind of atmosphere and it's
[1:17:20] up to you to generate that atmosphere we
[1:17:22] are atmosphere generators
[1:17:26] amen so it's up to you what kind of
[1:17:28] atmosphere do you want to live under do
[1:17:30] you want to live under an atmosphere of
[1:17:32] tension and stress and strife and
[1:17:34] unbelief or do you want to live in an
[1:17:37] atmosphere of divine love amen whether
[1:17:39] it's just such an atmosphere around you
[1:17:41] Hallelujah I think we haven't even
[1:17:44] probed into the reality of God like we
[1:17:47] should amen I was so I was just at work
[1:17:51] and I was just pondering a few things
[1:17:54] then my mind went went to when brother
[1:17:55] baram he goes to the hospital where his
[1:17:57] first wife hope is dying and and and he
[1:18:00] says that he shakes her brings her back
[1:18:02] youo and then she comes to herself and
[1:18:04] then hope looks up at her him and says
[1:18:06] why did you why did you bring me back
[1:18:10] and she says she says
[1:18:12] Bill you've preached about it you've
[1:18:15] talked about it but you know so a little
[1:18:19] about it and he says what do you mean he
[1:18:21] says I was being lifted she said I was
[1:18:23] being being sced by two Heavenly beings
[1:18:26] men a woman and white and there all
[1:18:28] these big birds of paradise flying
[1:18:30] around there was just all was all peace
[1:18:31] and joy and but he's telling the prophet
[1:18:34] you know you talked about it you
[1:18:37] preached about it but you know so little
[1:18:39] about the reality of it how great it is
[1:18:42] oh hallelujah how great it is you think
[1:18:44] we have you know God comes you know and
[1:18:46] it's all over the world God comes down
[1:18:47] to a meeting and we never want to leave
[1:18:50] that's just a shadow of a shadow of the
[1:18:52] reality of what heaven will really be
[1:18:54] like
[1:18:55] how great it really will be I mean just
[1:18:58] that when that sweet humble feeling
[1:18:59] comes over you think oh my can I just be
[1:19:01] here forever and God's really just
[1:19:03] saying that's just a trickle that's not
[1:19:05] it's going to be far greater over there
[1:19:07] than we can imagine
[1:19:09] Hallelujah that's right amen I think my
[1:19:13] Lord
[1:19:13] Jesus you know and I think we're still
[1:19:16] in that same predicament we talk about
[1:19:18] it we preach about it God comes down but
[1:19:22] we know so little about how great it
[1:19:24] really is
[1:19:26] hallelujah amen that's why I think we
[1:19:28] should talk about it Lord give us a
[1:19:31] foretaste there more than just words but
[1:19:34] you come down you come down anoint our
[1:19:36] fellowship anoint when we even just talk
[1:19:39] to you Lord there's such an atmosphere
[1:19:41] that's like when when brother Isaac was
[1:19:43] here preaching on um was it Divine love
[1:19:45] or what was your
[1:19:47] title unconditional love I wasn't here
[1:19:50] but eyes up and field I come back an is
[1:19:53] sitting there in her seat at the end of
[1:19:54] the service and and and Christine comes
[1:19:57] back after playing the piano and Le is's
[1:19:59] just in tear so happy and she says mom
[1:20:02] Jesus touched me Hallelujah I don't want
[1:20:04] to leave hallelujah what is that God can
[1:20:08] move on the young he can move on the old
[1:20:11] he can move on the every age Hallelujah
[1:20:14] but what was that that wasn't just that
[1:20:16] was God coming in behind what brother
[1:20:18] Isaac was preaching saying yes this is
[1:20:20] true Hallelujah and there was a heart
[1:20:22] that was open to respond and she said I
[1:20:24] don't want to leave this presence
[1:20:26] Hallelujah and that's just a foraste of
[1:20:28] how glorious it will be over there
[1:20:32] hallelujah amen amen hallelujah
[1:20:35] hallelujah so for this saying go thy way
[1:20:39] Hallelujah the devil has gone out of thy
[1:20:41] daughter that's why we should always
[1:20:43] speak good things you know there's a
[1:20:45] saying if you got nothing good to say
[1:20:46] say nothing at all I think that holds
[1:20:49] very true am we should say good things
[1:20:51] amen H we say good things of one another
[1:20:54] we should run each other down what if
[1:20:56] the person that you're running down is
[1:20:58] actually the one that God wants us used
[1:20:59] to help the person that you're talking
[1:21:02] to amen think about
[1:21:04] it now he says here in 2 Corinthians 4
[1:21:07] we having the same Spirit of Faith
[1:21:09] according as written I have believed I
[1:21:11] believe therefore I have spoken we also
[1:21:13] believe and therefore speak knowing that
[1:21:15] he which raised up the Lord Jesus shall
[1:21:17] raise us up also by Jesus and shall
[1:21:20] present us with you so he's saying I
[1:21:23] believe therefore I have spoken
[1:21:25] you believe amen we also believe and
[1:21:27] therefore speak so if we believe we
[1:21:29] can't hold silent amen we can't hold
[1:21:32] silent I mean if God has has has birthed
[1:21:35] us into the kingdom who's been birthed
[1:21:37] who's something and something God's
[1:21:39] turned your heart said Lord I believe
[1:21:40] your word that's God doing that that's
[1:21:43] God turning your heart that's not you
[1:21:44] there's nothing in man that really wants
[1:21:47] God Amen it says in Romans not one6
[1:21:50] after him and our caral natural way
[1:21:53] we're not built to follow God but God
[1:21:55] put a jean seed in your soul Hallelujah
[1:21:59] and in God season he Broods over that
[1:22:01] seed brings it to life and that's why
[1:22:03] there's something in US Lord I want to
[1:22:04] follow you Lord I want to serve you amen
[1:22:07] cuz it's him getting a he's got a grip
[1:22:10] Hallelujah and he's not going to let go
[1:22:11] of that
[1:22:12] grip amen because we have a man that has
[1:22:15] bridged the way this word has bridged
[1:22:17] the way Hallelujah so I'd start
[1:22:21] speaking amen don't let the devil hold
[1:22:23] you silent you talk to God you don't
[1:22:26] hold your peace
[1:22:29] Hallelujah now we're going to come back
[1:22:32] to this but I want to jump I'm going to
[1:22:35] jump well let's go here death and life
[1:22:37] are in the power of the tongue and they
[1:22:39] that love it shall eat the fruit
[1:22:41] thereof so and I can say this your death
[1:22:44] or your life is in the power of your own
[1:22:46] tongue amen your life or your death is
[1:22:49] in the power of your own tongue if you
[1:22:52] say yes amen you will receive if you
[1:22:54] believe it and confess it you say yes
[1:22:57] it's true and you'll receive life but if
[1:22:59] you doubt it and confess that doubt
[1:23:01] you'll receive death so what are you
[1:23:04] wanting to
[1:23:06] do now if I can you know this is the
[1:23:09] problem with slideshows we jump around
[1:23:11] but you see Esther
[1:23:13] here now Esther's come to a position
[1:23:18] she's been elevated to become Queen over
[1:23:21] over the me and Persians she's standing
[1:23:23] in her position I her people are under a
[1:23:27] death sentence this is where she is
[1:23:30] she's the only one Mori tells her in the
[1:23:32] previous chapter perhaps you have come
[1:23:34] into the kingdom for a Time such as this
[1:23:37] that you can use the office that the
[1:23:38] King has placed you in am mean that your
[1:23:40] people can receive life and not be
[1:23:43] destroyed as the law that hmon had the
[1:23:45] King right would would would come into
[1:23:48] effect and so now here she is and and
[1:23:52] previous to this chapter I didn't put it
[1:23:53] all in just a save time but previous to
[1:23:55] this chapter she's gone into the
[1:23:57] presence of the king she's found Grace
[1:23:59] in his sight as she did to begin with
[1:24:03] hallelujah hallelujah it wasn't Esther's
[1:24:06] own ability that that that gave her
[1:24:09] favor with the King that she became
[1:24:10] Queen she listened to hagi hagi knew the
[1:24:12] heart of the king I mean so she arrayed
[1:24:14] herself as Hagi said and then and then
[1:24:17] the king fell in love with her because
[1:24:18] when the king saw Esther he saw what his
[1:24:21] heart was Hallelujah she saw this is a
[1:24:24] woman after my own heart Hallelujah and
[1:24:27] it says the Bible says that she found
[1:24:28] Grace or or favor in the sight of the
[1:24:30] king now have we not found favor in the
[1:24:33] sight of the
[1:24:34] king I just I just say Lord lift our
[1:24:37] faith may we not be afraid to step in
[1:24:40] our god-given position take our
[1:24:42] god-given rights amen but haven't we
[1:24:44] found favor in his sight it's not him
[1:24:46] that willth or rth but God that shows
[1:24:48] Mercy has he showed you Mercy amen
[1:24:50] hallelujah amen hasn't he shown you
[1:24:52] Grace amen so she's a afraid to go in
[1:24:55] before the king but but then she does go
[1:24:57] in a raid in her royal apparel and and
[1:25:00] it's a death sentence to go in before
[1:25:02] the king without being invited but the
[1:25:04] king wants his Queen by her side by his
[1:25:06] side amen so so so she goes in he he uh
[1:25:10] lifts out his Royal scepter that means
[1:25:12] she's pardoned she touches the scepter
[1:25:14] then the King asks what is your request
[1:25:17] you know this is God the Lord say what
[1:25:20] do you need what do you
[1:25:23] need what do you need no no I'm asking
[1:25:27] you you should I trust there's some cogs
[1:25:29] moving in your heart or in your soul
[1:25:31] saying Lord I have a need and and and
[1:25:33] you see many times when when Esther goes
[1:25:35] and before the king what do you need
[1:25:37] what's your
[1:25:38] request and God wants us to speak our
[1:25:42] request to him amen you see here's
[1:25:44] Esther's Esther's remember I oh I know
[1:25:48] I've said it before Esther has two
[1:25:50] things on her heart the Deliverance of
[1:25:52] her people and the destruction of her
[1:25:53] enemy
[1:25:55] this is why she's G him before the king
[1:25:57] Hallelujah she has an enemy we have an
[1:26:00] enemy you know brother Bram says the
[1:26:02] devil hates me I hate him we got to we
[1:26:05] got to come to this conclusion the
[1:26:06] devil's not our friend he's not here to
[1:26:08] help us he's not here to guide us in any
[1:26:10] way that would be good am mean he has
[1:26:11] nothing he has no good intention towards
[1:26:14] us one iota amen he wants to destroy us
[1:26:17] and if he had his way we would be all in
[1:26:19] unbelief and doubt in some place in the
[1:26:21] world that's right or some co cold
[1:26:23] formal religion somewhere if he had his
[1:26:26] way but God had his way God has had his
[1:26:29] way Hallelujah so here comes Esther and
[1:26:33] friends we've got a role to play we're
[1:26:35] going to take our role we're going to
[1:26:37] take God has God has said you're the
[1:26:38] bride that's right Hallelujah you just
[1:26:40] can't look at the script and say well
[1:26:42] that's neat no you got to step into the
[1:26:44] scene Hallelujah so she comes in and
[1:26:46] says now so what's your request and and
[1:26:49] he just said she just says to the king I
[1:26:51] want to invite you and hon to a banquet
[1:26:53] of wines so they have their first
[1:26:55] banquet and then now and then we come to
[1:26:58] this piece of Esther where the king
[1:27:01] can't
[1:27:02] sleep
[1:27:04] Hallelujah the king can't sleep sleep
[1:27:07] what's going on it's amazing what the
[1:27:10] difference between day and night and day
[1:27:12] a changing of a day means a whole much
[1:27:15] in the scripture I was going to go to
[1:27:17] Ruth I I'll leave Ruth for maybe a later
[1:27:19] later date when when she comes to the
[1:27:21] threshing FL floor at night then there's
[1:27:23] the rising of the son and then Ruth
[1:27:25] comes into a union with Boaz huj
[1:27:27] Hallelujah well we'll leave that that
[1:27:28] one's just free but you know you you
[1:27:31] we're living in a different seasonall
[1:27:33] we're living in a different season we're
[1:27:34] not living in a season of a death
[1:27:36] sentence under us no we're live or over
[1:27:38] us rather we're living in a season of
[1:27:40] Deliverance we're living in a season of
[1:27:42] Jubilee we're living in a season of
[1:27:44] freedom I mean we're living in the
[1:27:46] season of The Rapture that's the season
[1:27:48] the bride is living in hallelujah we're
[1:27:50] no longer an oppressed woman am me we
[1:27:52] brother saw the vision of a man man who
[1:27:54] looked like his dad but wasn't his dad
[1:27:56] and a woman who looked like his mom but
[1:27:57] wasn't his mom and she was on the ground
[1:27:59] all beaten up and and and that man had
[1:28:01] that three-edged club and every time the
[1:28:03] woman would try and get up the man would
[1:28:04] beat him down beat her down that was a
[1:28:06] trinitarian spirit every time the bride
[1:28:09] would try and stand on her feet I mean
[1:28:11] that that religious trinitarian spirit
[1:28:13] would beat her down and that spirit is
[1:28:15] still in the world today I mean either
[1:28:17] in formalism or liberalism any of those
[1:28:20] things it just beats the people down why
[1:28:22] cuz it produces unbelief in them they
[1:28:24] can't Ascend in faith to their god-given
[1:28:26] position but friends we're not under
[1:28:28] that Spirit no more that man with the
[1:28:31] club has been defeated he's been cast
[1:28:33] out of this place am mean that we can
[1:28:35] come onto our feet and say Lord I'm
[1:28:37] standing in my position I'm standing in
[1:28:39] my god-given rights that nothing can
[1:28:42] beat me down no more hallelujah we're
[1:28:45] living in that season are so you got to
[1:28:48] play your role hallelujah we're not a
[1:28:50] downtrodden people no more am so if
[1:28:52] we're not downtrod no more we're going
[1:28:54] to take our role h stand on the stage
[1:28:58] and we're going to take our god-given
[1:28:59] position the devil always tries us do
[1:29:01] you think the devil says oh yes here's
[1:29:03] the bride I'll help you come on what can
[1:29:05] I do no he doesn't want to help you he's
[1:29:07] trying to push you back he's trying to
[1:29:09] stop you possessing your inheritance but
[1:29:12] you've got to speak to him you've got to
[1:29:14] call his bluff he is nothing but a bluff
[1:29:17] but you got to call his bluff if you
[1:29:19] don't call his bluff then he will still
[1:29:21] be a bluff in your face I mean but
[1:29:23] you've got to show him you got to tell
[1:29:25] him what he is and the thing is when you
[1:29:27] begin to speak then God comes in behind
[1:29:30] you listen to so many prayer lines at
[1:29:33] the end God comes down and brother Brown
[1:29:36] just just just gives a mess prayer and
[1:29:38] he and and and he and he's talking to
[1:29:40] the Lord then he begins to address Satan
[1:29:43] he says Satan you've held these people
[1:29:45] for long enough I rebuke the in the name
[1:29:47] of Jesus Christ you're not afraid of me
[1:29:49] but you're afraid of the god who's
[1:29:51] present and He commands the devil to get
[1:29:53] out and and then you can hear it on the
[1:29:54] table it's like a power breaks and then
[1:29:57] people begin to rejoice and go free
[1:29:59] Hallelujah why because the devil's cast
[1:30:01] out of the place and people can rise in
[1:30:03] faith and receive what they need
[1:30:05] Hallelujah that's the same thing here
[1:30:07] friend the devil's not here he you know
[1:30:10] don't let him pin you down we're not
[1:30:12] called to be pinned down we're called
[1:30:14] that he would be under our feet and we
[1:30:16] would go Victorious that's why you've
[1:30:18] got it you've got to speak through your
[1:30:20] lips oh so and so praise me oh so and so
[1:30:23] praise me that's all very well and good
[1:30:25] but you've got to take the word yourself
[1:30:27] you've got to speak it in faith yourself
[1:30:29] you've got to address your enemy
[1:30:31] yourself amen and tell him to get out in
[1:30:33] the name of Jesus Christ that's what
[1:30:35] you've got to do but the devil tries to
[1:30:37] shut you up saying well you're not
[1:30:39] worthy you know you have no Authority
[1:30:42] you can't do this and he's nothing but a
[1:30:44] bluff am mean cuz the blood of Jesus
[1:30:46] Christ makes us join ears with Christ
[1:30:49] Hallelujah so if Christ defeated hey
[1:30:52] Christ Our Lord Jesus went down to hell
[1:30:54] defeated Satan in
[1:30:56] Hell took his keys off him rose up
[1:30:59] Victorious death couldn't hold him no
[1:31:02] Devils could hold him no Devils could
[1:31:04] stop him in this earth Hallelujah and
[1:31:06] now God's made us a join a by the blood
[1:31:09] of his son he's made us join ear so if
[1:31:11] our lord Jesus was Victorious what are
[1:31:14] we going to be
[1:31:16] victorious Hallelujah you going to say
[1:31:19] well oh my friends yeah brother BR
[1:31:22] sisters like a goes all mil milk in the
[1:31:24] building a real Faith Bank comes we've
[1:31:26] had meetings like that people have seen
[1:31:29] it Go all milky over the place why cuz
[1:31:31] the atmosphere comes right that God can
[1:31:33] come down and you can begin to speak to
[1:31:35] your God and God can move on your behalf
[1:31:38] am Hallelujah this is a supernatural
[1:31:41] gospel Hallelujah this message is a
[1:31:43] supernatural gospel it's not a bunch of
[1:31:45] nice arguments putting quotes together
[1:31:47] and nice lectures no it's God living
[1:31:50] hallelujah it's God manifesting himself
[1:31:52] and we just have to come to conclusion
[1:31:54] God you're here to lift me into a
[1:31:56] position in you and you're determined
[1:31:59] it's going to happen so I'm not going to
[1:32:00] get in your way God take me lift me mold
[1:32:04] me change me whatever you need to do
[1:32:06] fill me with the Holy Ghost hallah don't
[1:32:08] let the devil distract me it's amazing
[1:32:11] you think about you know people would
[1:32:13] say when they when you know brother
[1:32:14] Braham was there he says now he's here
[1:32:17] and Billy Paul and many others said he
[1:32:19] didn't need to say that cuz the
[1:32:21] atmosphere just changed when the angel
[1:32:22] of the Lord stepped onto the plat for
[1:32:24] and yet he' begin to call people out and
[1:32:26] he'd say they're missing it lord they're
[1:32:28] missing it and then even God would give
[1:32:31] enough Grace to reveal the person's name
[1:32:33] so God is you just think about how how
[1:32:36] how how deceptive the devil is where God
[1:32:39] can be speaking directly to you right he
[1:32:42] can be speaking directly to you and to
[1:32:43] your need but yet the devil's got us
[1:32:45] distracted some
[1:32:46] way that's why I said God don't let us
[1:32:49] be
[1:32:50] distracted don't never let the devil
[1:32:52] never let the devil tell you you well
[1:32:55] you know you just got to survive a bit
[1:32:56] longer this this is not Survivor church

[1:33:29] he was 12 when he was 12 years old he
[1:33:31] would have given his heart to the Lord

[1:33:40] right the devil is here to fight God is
[1:33:44] here to fight Hallelujah God is here to
[1:33:47] fight but the devil's here to try and

[1:34:29] you busy I remember the so so the first
[1:34:32] church ever God ever the first ever
[1:34:34] Fellowship I went to was a Pentecostal
[1:34:35] Church you know but then the Lord but I
[1:34:38] was listening to brother Braham the Lord
[1:34:39] gloriously transform me but then I then
[1:34:41] I got led to a message Church down in
[1:34:42] Christ church and then there's a voice I

[1:34:59] devil was fighting me where the truth is
[1:35:01] and the devil always fights where the

[1:36:19] are now here's here's
[1:36:22] Esther and so she had this first banquet
[1:36:24] of wines with the King now the king
[1:36:26] can't sleep and that
[1:36:29] night it says on that night could not
[1:36:32] the king sleep and he commanded to bring
[1:36:34] the book of records of The Chronicles
[1:36:37] and there was read before him the king
[1:36:38] and it was found there in that Mori had
[1:36:41] told of uh Biga and and cherish terish
[1:36:46] two of the king chamber the keepers of
[1:36:48] the door who sought to lay hand on King
[1:36:51] of hazus and the King said what honor
[1:36:53] and dignity hath been done to morai for
[1:36:56] this then said the king's servants that
[1:36:58] ministered unto him there is nothing
[1:37:00] done for him what happens now here comes
[1:37:02] the records of the Kingdom that were
[1:37:03] sealed up put in the archives then now
[1:37:06] the book comes open before the king the
[1:37:08] book comes open before the king and then
[1:37:10] so the king's
[1:37:11] asking what reward has been given to
[1:37:13] this man for saving my life Ro reward he
[1:37:16] says nothing's been done and then you go
[1:37:18] from this moment now then now uh Hon's y
[1:37:22] yo Hon's out there cuz the devil always
[1:37:24] hangs around where God
[1:37:25] is he can't find his own party amen he

[1:37:30] to wreck what God is doing so Hon's hang
[1:37:32] around in the outer court and then and

[1:37:37] outer Court then hmon comes in I don't
[1:37:39] know how we'd walk in you know and then
[1:37:41] and then the king asked him what should
[1:37:42] be done to a servant that the you know
[1:37:44] King should highly reward and hmon
[1:37:46] because the devil thinks it's all about
[1:37:47] him so um well have him right on the

[1:37:51] greatest thing that that that that the
[1:37:52] king would cuz he going to do it for me
[1:37:54] you you know he's going to do it for me
[1:37:55] cuz cuz the devil's self-absorbed you

[1:38:02] know lovers of their own selves more
[1:38:03] than lovers of God what are they that's

[1:38:11] servant on you know the king's horse and
[1:38:13] you know raiding his robes and the crown
[1:38:15] on whatever and then so now the king

[1:38:19] morai and then so hmon shocked but then
[1:38:21] hmon has to do it so now so now hmon has
[1:38:24] to go through the streets with morai on
[1:38:26] the king's horse with the king's crown

[1:40:48] queen this is not just something to fill
[1:40:50] an evening what's going on he wants to

[1:41:06] going on and so here's the king there's
[1:41:09] a reason Esther what's all what's all
[1:41:10] this about this is not what he uses but

[1:41:17] devil this is what hmon is doing my life
[1:41:20] is under a death sentence not just me
[1:41:23] but all my people if we were just slaves
[1:41:26] if we were just going to be sold into
[1:41:27] slavery I would have held my tongue
[1:41:28] that's what you said but because we're
[1:41:29] under death sentence I cannot you I need
[1:41:31] to speak and then the king gets mad you
[1:41:35] know our God is not mad at
[1:41:38] us you know Jesus is not mad at you who
[1:41:41] knows that no no no you got to know that
[1:41:44] he doesn't get mad you know it's like a
[1:41:46] child learning to walk you say well I
[1:41:48] trip and fall so many times like a child
[1:41:50] learning to walk you they start like
[1:41:51] this and they fall over then they fall
[1:41:54] over again and they knock
[1:41:56] themselves is there any parent in the
[1:41:58] world that as soon as a child starts
[1:42:01] walking starts getting angry at the
[1:42:04] child because they fall
[1:42:06] over no they're like come on you can do
[1:42:08] it pick them up dust them off here we go
[1:42:11] go again they fall over again but but
[1:42:13] there but there's something in them they
[1:42:15] want to walk amen you don't have to tell
[1:42:17] a kid you know you there always comes an
[1:42:20] age when every able-bodied child walks
[1:42:23] right and you don't have to tell them
[1:42:24] okay now we're going to walk come on and
[1:42:26] Coach them and this is how you do it
[1:42:28] there's just something in them they see
[1:42:29] you and something in them that says I
[1:42:32] want to do that Hallelujah that's why
[1:42:34] you got to look into the word see how
[1:42:36] Jesus was you say I want to do that or
[1:42:38] you listen to the message see how
[1:42:39] brother Brown was God using him I want
[1:42:41] to do that I want to see that kind of
[1:42:43] victory in my life and then we begin to
[1:42:45] walk then they pull themselves up walk
[1:42:46] along furniture look at me look at me
[1:42:48] and then they then they push out you
[1:42:49] could say into open open space it can
[1:42:52] get a bit scary
[1:42:53] Hallelujah but not one parent rebukes a
[1:42:56] child for falling over they're proud
[1:42:59] amen look at all the first step you know
[1:43:01] how we always going to capture the first
[1:43:02] step and and and and and we don't just
[1:43:04] want a photo no more we want video
[1:43:07] Hallelujah and then as soon as we get it
[1:43:09] it's just all over the world on Facebook
[1:43:11] Little Johnny made their first step now
[1:43:14] another another parent will would might
[1:43:16] say well that's cool but but the parents
[1:43:20] themselves they're like they're getting
[1:43:21] older they're growing up
[1:43:23] Hallelujah and the older they get the
[1:43:25] better relationship I can have remember
[1:43:27] when they're just a little baby you just
[1:43:29] go you know and that's and that's as
[1:43:31] deep as your fellowship is but then they
[1:43:35] begin to say Daddy and Mama it gets a
[1:43:36] bit deeper then their sentences for this
[1:43:38] reasoning begins to happen what the
[1:43:40] relationship gets deeper as they get
[1:43:42] older am hallelujah amen just when they
[1:43:45] begin to put words together amen yeah
[1:43:47] it's just like talking I know I'm
[1:43:48] repeating myself but no parent ever gets
[1:43:51] mad at a child for not perfectly
[1:43:52] speaking speaking right the first time
[1:43:56] they start with Dad or Mom and then
[1:43:57] maybe you know that's just like us and
[1:44:00] God we get birthed Hallelujah doesn't
[1:44:03] matter what age we are physically we
[1:44:04] have we get birthed and then we start
[1:44:07] trying to walk with the Lord because
[1:44:08] there's something in us I want to walk
[1:44:10] with you God I want to walk with you I
[1:44:12] want to I want you to hold my hand yeah
[1:44:14] I remember the first time I held Anisa's
[1:44:16] hand I was like I'd walk along like this
[1:44:18] and she's up like this you know cuz
[1:44:19] she's so short but now it gets a lot
[1:44:21] easier cuz now we're getting some height
[1:44:24] Hallelujah and now we can Skip Along and
[1:44:26] we can sing and we can do things that it
[1:44:28] wasn't the same when she's just holding
[1:44:29] on for dear life cuz he's going to fall
[1:44:31] over but you know but because a child
[1:44:33] gets older you can have better
[1:44:34] relationship and it's the same thing
[1:44:36] with us in the Lord he doesn't get mad
[1:44:38] at you when you fall amen amen he
[1:44:42] doesn't get he doesn't get angry at you
[1:44:45] because you fall he wants to pick you up
[1:44:48] amen hallelujah the Bible says he's our
[1:44:51] Advocate and an advocate works on our
[1:44:54] behalf amen amen he doesn't work against
[1:44:57] us he's not like a real estate agent
[1:44:58] nothing against real estate agents but
[1:45:00] he's nothing he's not like a real estate
[1:45:01] agent trying to get the best price out
[1:45:03] of the buyer and and for the seller but
[1:45:06] at the end time I mean but but in
[1:45:08] reality he just wants to biggest cut for
[1:45:09] himself that's why he wants the highest
[1:45:11] price so he's really working for
[1:45:13] himself right in that way trying to like
[1:45:15] a selfish motive God's not like that
[1:45:17] he's all for
[1:45:20] us I hope that's an all right analogy
[1:45:22] you know God is just he's our Advocate
[1:45:24] and that's why the Apostle Paul said if
[1:45:25] God before us who can be against us no
[1:45:28] one can be against us and so you so so
[1:45:31] God isn't mad at us I said all that just
[1:45:33] to say God is not mad at us he doesn't
[1:45:35] get angry at you just because you fall
[1:45:37] it's not him that falls at him that gets
[1:45:39] back up Hallelujah remember God doesn't
[1:45:42] run his
[1:45:43] business um brother Braham says God
[1:45:46] doesn't save you one day to lose you the
[1:45:49] next day God doesn't run his business
[1:45:51] that way amen
[1:45:53] someone who's actually has real
[1:45:55] salvation their heart is Lord I want to
[1:45:58] serve you no matter what and they always
[1:46:00] have a hunger and a thirst for
[1:46:03] truth amen not for
[1:46:06] religion people can have all the
[1:46:08] religion they want but it's a hunger and
[1:46:09] thirst for more of him hallelujah amen
[1:46:13] so he doesn't save us to lose us you
[1:46:15] know our names are on the Lamb's Book of
[1:46:16] Life written before the foundation of
[1:46:17] the world God doesn't rub them off am he
[1:46:20] can't rub it off amen
[1:46:23] Hallelujah if our name is there it can't
[1:46:26] be taken away I'm not talking about the
[1:46:27] book of life I'm talking about the
[1:46:28] Lamb's Book of Life those are all those
[1:46:31] are all the names of his redeemed and
[1:46:33] your name was there before the
[1:46:35] foundation of the world but God knew
[1:46:36] when you had come and then God sent his
[1:46:39] message to you amen and then you would
[1:46:41] respond to it in the way you have
[1:46:43] because God is telling you your name is
[1:46:45] on the Lamb's Book of Life Hallelujah
[1:46:47] that no no one can erase that name
[1:46:51] hallelujah hallelujah to God Amen so we
[1:46:54] just need to Rejoice that's what I say
[1:46:56] we should just be
[1:46:57] happy Hallelujah now I'm going to try
[1:46:59] and widen this up so anyway Esther
[1:47:02] speaks to the king the king gets mad we
[1:47:04] have to we have to talk to our Lord that
[1:47:07] the wrath of God is falling upon the
[1:47:10] Devil I'm not talking about people but
[1:47:12] against the devil that his wrath is
[1:47:14] poured out against Satan himself but he
[1:47:17] is waiting God is waiting for you
[1:47:19] because you he is the high priest of
[1:47:22] your profession
[1:47:23] so you have to tell god what the devil
[1:47:25] is trying to do against you so if he's
[1:47:28] on your case you say God the devil's on
[1:47:30] my case or if he's against your family
[1:47:32] you tell God about it do not keep
[1:47:34] silence you tell God what's going on in
[1:47:36] your situation I mean that cuz God just
[1:47:38] get mad amen God doesn't you know
[1:47:41] there's only one emotion that the devil
[1:47:43] uh God has uh towards the devil
[1:47:47] mad he just gets angry you know you've
[1:47:50] made this creation you no no God knew it
[1:47:52] was going to happen but well well okay
[1:47:55] I'll just take my three girls okay I
[1:47:57] won't use names cuz you say oh that was
[1:47:58] the devil no it's not but you know one
[1:48:02] spends literally a week dur this picture
[1:48:05] and then the other one just comes in
[1:48:06] picks up a pen just go you know and then
[1:48:08] the other one gets real upset that's
[1:48:11] like the devil you know God spent
[1:48:12] however many years building this
[1:48:14] Creation The Devil comes with this big
[1:48:16] pen of sin you know tries to wreck it up
[1:48:20] wouldn't you get mad I know it sounds
[1:48:22] ridiculous well yeah wouldn't you get
[1:48:23] angry that what do you do you know so
[1:48:27] the devil is God's
[1:48:29] enemy Jesus did not die to make peace
[1:48:31] with Satan he he died to make peace with
[1:48:34] you the devil is not redeemable you are
[1:48:37] redeemable that's why your heart is yes
[1:48:39] Lord I want to serve you yes Lord your
[1:48:41] word is true amen hallelujah hallelujah
[1:48:45] amen okay now we're just going to read
[1:48:48] this and we're going to I'll maybe pick
[1:48:50] this up another time now I'm going to
[1:48:52] I'm going to read this in English
[1:48:52] English this is from um uh the breach
[1:48:55] message what is this book of redemption
[1:48:58] I'm saying we have a man remember John
[1:49:00] wept because he saw no man was found
[1:49:02] worthy in heaven to take that book of
[1:49:04] redemption and he knew if no one took
[1:49:06] the book then all then then then
[1:49:08] everything was in Jeopardy because
[1:49:11] Redemption is a purchasing and a
[1:49:13] claiming right so you so Jesus purchases
[1:49:16] on Calvary but now he has to claim his
[1:49:19] bride and this is what this message is
[1:49:21] it's a claiming message well it's
[1:49:23] claiming those who are the names in the
[1:49:24] Lamb's Book of Life Hallelujah that's
[1:49:27] why it's spoken to you like it did amen
[1:49:30] glory to God so now he's so he's there
[1:49:32] saying and and it went much because no
[1:49:35] man was found worthy to take the book
[1:49:36] there were Angels there that they never
[1:49:38] sin but no man was worthy the prophets
[1:49:41] were there Hallelujah all the redeemed
[1:49:43] were there but no man was found worthy
[1:49:45] to take the
[1:49:46] book now what is this book of redemption
[1:49:49] this title deed this abstract title deed
[1:49:51] you say abstract what does abstract mean
[1:49:54] means it's searched all the way back to
[1:49:56] its
[1:49:57] beginning amen just like you have a bit
[1:49:59] of property and an abstract deed is that
[1:50:01] there's no claims against that piece of
[1:50:03] property once all the claims have been
[1:50:04] strucken off then the buyer can purchase
[1:50:06] it amen now um uh you take like that
[1:50:11] little drop of ink this morning when it
[1:50:13] struck that bleach and went all the way
[1:50:15] back and when Sinners confessed and
[1:50:17] fallen into the blood of Jesus Christ oh
[1:50:19] my it gives an abstract goes right back
[1:50:21] to the Creator again you become a Son of
[1:50:23] God Abstract title deed is held in the
[1:50:26] hands of the almighty oh my it's
[1:50:29] Redemption means all legal possession to
[1:50:32] all that was lost by Adam and Eve oh my
[1:50:35] says brother BR claps his hands once
[1:50:37] what ought that do ought to do to a born
[1:50:39] again Christian it's legal possessions
[1:50:42] that abstract deed title deed of eternal
[1:50:45] life means that you possess everything
[1:50:47] that Adam and Eve lost amen hallelujah
[1:50:50] hallelujah we believe it amen amen amen
[1:50:53] they were Gods over the Earth tree move
[1:50:56] there mountain move there
[1:50:59] hallelujah amen
[1:51:01] everything that he lost they lost we are
[1:51:03] in possession
[1:51:05] of Amen now that means you possess
[1:51:08] everything Adam and Eve lost fewu what a
[1:51:11] uh what of it brother the possession of
[1:51:13] that deed Adam could not meet the
[1:51:14] requirements of redemption after he
[1:51:16] found he lost it he had sinned and had
[1:51:19] separated himself from God was on this
[1:51:21] side of the chasm and he could not
[1:51:23] redeem it he couldn't do it cuz he
[1:51:25] needed Redemption himself so he could
[1:51:27] not do it but the law required a kinsman
[1:51:30] redeemer the law of God required a
[1:51:33] kinsman redeemer you want to mark that
[1:51:34] down kinsman redeemer we find it in
[1:51:36] Leviticus 25 now kinsman redeemer is a
[1:51:39] family member who has the ability ha you
[1:51:42] know has the money to do it has the will
[1:51:44] to do it and can redeem that's a kins
[1:51:47] and Redeemer but had to be part of the
[1:51:50] family hallelujah amen and that's why
[1:51:53] our lord Jesus became part of the family
[1:51:55] he became part of Adam's Fallen race
[1:51:57] Hallelujah that he could that that that
[1:51:59] so so he had to become a Kinsman he
[1:52:01] fulfilled his own law he became a
[1:52:03] Kinsman he had the price to redeem and
[1:52:06] he had the desire to redeem Hallelujah
[1:52:09] that's why when he died on Calvary he
[1:52:11] paid it in full there's no interest
[1:52:13] needs to be paid off no other down
[1:52:14] payments it wasn't just a deposit it was
[1:52:16] paid in full and he had a desire for
[1:52:18] this cause I've come into the world what
[1:52:20] to redeem my bride amen hallelujah
[1:52:23] hallelujah amen that ought to make you
[1:52:26] real happy hallelujah how do I not part
[1:52:29] of the family of God because his word in
[1:52:31] this hour has spoken to us like nothing
[1:52:33] else amen hallelujah this message I
[1:52:37] trust when you hear it it's not just
[1:52:39] some other religion or some other idea
[1:52:42] but you hear the voice behind the voice
[1:52:44] amen you hear God's voice speaking yes
[1:52:47] hallelujah amen glory amen amen we he
[1:52:51] says we don't have time to thoroughly
[1:52:54] search this wait am I in the right place
[1:52:57] wait that didn't sorry here we
[1:52:59] are we uh we uh we won't have time to
[1:53:02] thoroughly search this CU we know each
[1:53:04] text would take a night se but God's law
[1:53:06] required a substitute now if God had not
[1:53:09] offered to take a substitute but love
[1:53:11] constrained him to do it that man was
[1:53:13] without a way back there's no way for
[1:53:15] him to get back he was gone but the
[1:53:17] grace of God meet this kinsman redeemer
[1:53:21] in the person of Jesus Christ law
[1:53:23] required it Grace met its requirements
[1:53:25] Oh Amazing Grace how sweet the sound
[1:53:27] that that God's law required an innocent
[1:53:30] substitute
[1:53:32] Hallelujah now so God's law was met you
[1:53:36] know the law required it and Grace it
[1:53:38] met in the person of Jesus Christ Our
[1:53:40] Kinsman now I'm just going to hurry
[1:53:41] through this then we'll then we'll quit
[1:53:43] this is imperfect love uh uh perfect
[1:53:46] faith and when we were Sinners alienated
[1:53:49] without God in the world and that muck
[1:53:51] of mud as I told talked about this
[1:53:53] morning God came to us God sought you
[1:53:55] you never sought God no man can come to
[1:53:58] me except the father draws him first
[1:54:00] aren't you glad the father Drew you and
[1:54:02] God came down into that mck that where
[1:54:04] you were and sought you out and brought
[1:54:07] you out that ought to create a perfect
[1:54:10] love amen hallelujah look what you was

[1:54:25] somebody that loves you hallah can't you
[1:54:29] have faith in what he's promised you

[1:54:34] confidence in his word amen amen he
[1:54:37] caught me when I was nothing I'm still
[1:54:40] nothing but I'm in his hand see he
[1:54:42] caught me and he loved me when I was
[1:54:45] unlovable he loved you when you was
[1:54:47] unloved uh unlovable but he changed you
[1:54:51] amen glory just like that CED sister
[1:54:53] said at uh that time in her testimony

[1:54:57] I'm not what I want to be but then I'm
[1:55:00] not what I used to be amen she know she
[1:55:03] had come somewhere something happened
[1:55:05] and that's the way it is if God when I
[1:55:07] was an alien from him love me till he
[1:55:10] stooped down to get me and pick me up
[1:55:13] that gives me confidence then he wants
[1:55:15] to use me he's got a purpose in doing it
[1:55:18] he's seen something in me he's seen
[1:55:20] something in you he had a reason to save
[1:55:22] you look at the people that was unsa
[1:55:24] that you know that's unsaved today look
[1:55:26] at the millions he could have took
[1:55:27] besides you but he took you amen no one
[1:55:31] can take your place amen you're in God's
[1:55:33] economy no one can do it that's his love
[1:55:36] to
[1:55:37] you
[1:55:40] Hallelujah and then he says now now then
[1:55:43] won't Your Love reach right back to
[1:55:46] him and there's a love affair no matter
[1:55:49] what the situation is it circumstances
[1:55:51] is going
[1:55:52] by this love that creates faith that God
[1:55:56] loves you and you love God and you love
[1:55:57] one another and that brings the faith
[1:56:00] all right then it can't it can't keep
[1:56:03] from bringing out just exactly what God
[1:56:05] promised it would
[1:56:07] do
[1:56:08] Hallelujah when we all lost in the muck
