[9:16] praise the lord
[9:17] hello everyone welcome back to the house
[9:19] of god this morning
[9:21] to be here it's good to um be able to
[9:23] gather together and worship the lord
[9:25] amen who's expecting great things this
[9:27] morning
[9:29] we always get what we expect that's the
[9:31] way that
[9:32] that
[9:33] it works and our expectations actually
[9:34] bring the spirit of god near
[9:37] he because
[9:39] he's gentleman like you the the spirit
[9:41] of god only comes where it's welcome it
[9:43] doesn't intrude and push in he's not
[9:45] like a pushy salesman you know that
[9:48] intrudes were not really welcome and
[9:50] they're calling you and coming at you
[9:52] the gospel doesn't go like that it
[9:54] doesn't it's not forced upon anyone to
[9:56] try and and trick them into it it's
[9:58] actually a choice you know that
[10:01] the he he comes where he feels welcome
[10:03] and when we make the choice he'll come
[10:04] but he doesn't come and
[10:07] force himself upon us uninvited and just
[10:10] pushing
[10:11] he waits for us to ask that's the that's
[10:14] the nature of god you know if you know a
[10:16] gentleman like man or woman that's the
[10:18] way that they operate they don't just
[10:19] force themselves on people they
[10:21] they've got more honour than that and
[10:23] they they respect so that's that's the
[10:24] way that the lord is so let's um let's
[10:26] stand in
[10:27] and invite the lord here so that we can
[10:29] meet have fellowship with the king of
[10:31] kings but he always comes he said we're
[10:33] two or three gathered together in one
[10:35] and there am i in the midst you know
[10:37] there's a there's a certain point in
[10:39] time where where
[10:41] if you if you draw an eye unto the lord
[10:44] the right way he'll draw nigh on to us
[10:45] that he just can't help it that's his
[10:47] nature is that as well that if we
[10:49] genuinely call he'll answer that's the
[10:51] way that he works so we're we're happy
[10:53] this morning that we can call upon the
[10:54] living god so let's just um pray
[10:56] and we'll just commit the service to the
[10:58] lord heavenly father we're so grateful
[11:00] for lord that we come can come
[11:02] freely to the king of kings and lord of
[11:04] lords this morning lord you've made a

[11:21] us have made in our hearts to come
[11:23] lord and we believe you can see that

[11:55] things that are attributes of the spirit
[11:56] of god lord they they flow freely from

[12:02] spirit upon us lord may each one that

[29:24] amen amen you can take your seats this
[29:27] morning we've got an a special from
[29:32] sister shannon
[29:33] and the um sunday school
[29:35] group
[29:37] is it
[29:38] okay
[29:43] okay this is gonna be good
[29:48] [Music]
[29:56] um
[29:58] [Music]
[30:24] okay so
[30:26] um
[30:31] look red microphone
[30:34] so that's kind of our sunday school
[30:35] lesson today because these guys are so
[30:38] privileged and blessed they're going on
[30:39] a snow trip
[30:40] this week
[30:43] i don't think i ever went in the snow
[30:44] and especially skis as well so i thought
[30:47] this was appropriate for them this
[30:49] morning so guys we'll read it out for
[30:51] them see it up there so this is their
[30:53] memory verse so they get a prize once
[30:56] they tell me it next week okay ready go
[30:58] ahead
[31:00] [Music]
[31:13] awesome okay so um
[31:16] i said to them a while ago in another um
[31:18] sunday school lesson if they just look
[31:20] at nature you'll see god everywhere
[31:22] you'll see god he just puts his
[31:24] analogies everywhere so i reckon he made
[31:26] snow to so how show how righteous he is
[31:29] so when these guys are skiing and
[31:30] they're looking at the snow how bright
[31:32] it is they'll be like
[31:34] that's like god's righteousness and then
[31:35] when they see the snow a little bit more
[31:37] personal
[31:39] they'll be like oh look at that that's
[31:41] god's righteousness and it also becomes
[31:44] our righteousness so the lesson was
[31:48] this was milk at one stage so this is
[31:50] what happens guys what happened when i
[31:52] well we know what happens when our sins
[31:55] are like scarlet
[31:56] okay and it goes into milk milk i said
[32:00] it was like any other religions buddhism
[32:03] you know all the different religions in
[32:04] the world
[32:05] you're still
[32:07] tainted with sin
[32:09] so and then we've got this one i was
[32:11] able to refill because i didn't have any
[32:13] more milk then we've got our own
[32:14] righteousness
[32:16] and then when our sin
[32:18] is dropped into our own righteousness
[32:24] sorry a bit too much
[32:27] this is what it looks like to god
[32:30] so we can't get there by our works
[32:32] or our own
[32:33] righteousness but brother brennan made a
[32:36] reference to clorox bleach he said if
[32:39] our sin gets dropped in clorox bleach in
[32:42] a bucket of clorox bleach this is what
[32:44] happens to it
[32:59] takes a little bit to dissolve
[33:10] and
[33:11] it will just get whiter
[33:14] and whiter
[33:15] and whiter
[33:18] and so it completely dissolves
[33:21] and you have to imagine a whole bucket
[33:22] of
[33:24] bleach with one drop of water
[33:26] and it's still dissolving and another
[33:28] analogy that i told them
[33:31] was
[33:32] we were righteousness we were righteous
[33:34] at one state
[33:36] when we were up in heaven with him right
[33:40] but
[33:40] when we came to
[33:42] the world
[33:45] even being born
[33:46] we got sin tainted
[33:49] so
[33:50] then he takes us and tells us what he
[33:53] did for us
[34:06] and he washes us
[34:10] as white as snow
[34:12] so i had taken the shirt and showed them
[34:15] with the
[34:17] the red food coloring before
[34:20] i don't know why i can't get through
[34:21] without crying
[34:24] and it was completely gone so i'll show

[1:08:47] but what oh my you know he had a lot of
[1:08:49] things to do right now he was about to
[1:08:51] go to calvary my to purchase
[1:08:53] the salvation of the whole world and
[1:08:55] still watch and the multitude that they
[1:08:57] but they cried the more saying have
[1:09:00] mercy on us lord thou son of david and
[1:09:03] jesus stood still
[1:09:06] and called them
[1:09:09] and said
[1:09:10] what will
[1:09:11] ye that i shall do unto you
[1:09:15] and i want i believe that this morning
[1:09:18] if you'll cry
[1:09:20] amen you just cry out to the lord the
[1:09:22] same god will stand
[1:09:23] he'll stand for you and he is standing
[1:09:26] for you amen may the lord add his
[1:09:28] blessing to the reading of his word you
[1:09:29] may be seated
[1:09:30] amen
[1:09:34] now i want to we will come back to that
[1:09:38] lord willing
[1:09:41] i want to speak now from revelation 12 7
[1:09:44] and rebel up to 12 and it says here this
[1:09:46] is going to set the foundation context
[1:09:49] of our thought today and um i want you
[1:09:52] to think about this here um you have
[1:09:55] revelation 12 7 to 12. it's a very
[1:09:57] familiar passage of scripture
[1:09:59] that's been preached out
[1:10:00] many many times it's very popular we
[1:10:02] know everyone knows the scripture but i
[1:10:04] want to talk about i want to just um
[1:10:06] show you a few things so i'll just read
[1:10:08] here first and there was war in heaven
[1:10:12] michael and his angels fought against
[1:10:14] the dragon and the dragon fought and his
[1:10:16] angels so we have a great war going on
[1:10:19] amen and prevail not who's glad that
[1:10:22] they prevailed not amen
[1:10:24] hallelujah so therefore that is done
[1:10:27] the the immovable has been moved the
[1:10:30] unshakable has been shaken and then the
[1:10:32] impossible miraculous has been released
[1:10:34] upon the impossible
[1:10:36] it's done
[1:10:37] it's settled
[1:10:39] it's finished
[1:10:40] because god said it i believe it that
[1:10:42] settles it amen
[1:10:44] glory now we can go home it's all done
[1:10:47] it's finished just walk in that victory
[1:10:49] hallelujah let's just have a feed amen
[1:10:52] let's just rejoice amen i'll just
[1:10:54] continue on and prevail not neither was
[1:10:57] their place found any more in heaven
[1:11:01] but you'll see in a minute how this
[1:11:03] scoundrels
[1:11:05] slinks his way back into a position
[1:11:08] and the great dragon was cast out that
[1:11:11] old serpent called the devil and satan
[1:11:14] which deceiveth the whole world
[1:11:17] my
[1:11:18] he was cast out into the earth amen do
[1:11:21] you know the devil's always good for his
[1:11:22] being cast out
[1:11:24] cast out and he's a tool so that you can
[1:11:27] get character
[1:11:29] by suffering
[1:11:31] he makes you suffer a little bit
[1:11:33] but remember the suffering of this
[1:11:35] present time
[1:11:36] is not worthy to be compared
[1:11:39] to the glory that shall be revealed in
[1:11:41] you
[1:11:42] it's not even worthy to be compared
[1:11:44] romans 8 18
[1:11:46] i'm not going to hang that on the coat
[1:11:47] hook
[1:11:49] i'll hang that there
[1:11:52] not worthy to be compared
[1:11:54] but it's very valuable
[1:11:57] so just think of him he's just good for
[1:11:58] being cast out
[1:12:01] and the and he was cast out that old
[1:12:03] serpent down to the earth and his angels
[1:12:05] were cast out with him
[1:12:08] those the angels that were cast out with
[1:12:10] him uh they were once angels created by
[1:12:13] god in heaven to serve in heaven and
[1:12:15] they fell to the earth and darkness and
[1:12:18] they were imprisoned in darkness they
[1:12:20] are demons so a demon is a fallen angel
[1:12:24] same species but just in darkness they
[1:12:27] cross the line between mercy and
[1:12:29] judgment instantly
[1:12:31] we we we're different we're god's
[1:12:33] children
[1:12:35] there is mercy for us we haven't crossed
[1:12:37] the line but an angel crossed the line
[1:12:40] the devil crossed the line those angels
[1:12:42] those they were good they were angels in
[1:12:44] heaven and they were deceived by lucifer
[1:12:46] and the moment they crossed over they
[1:12:49] became void of love joy peace anything
[1:12:52] of the fruit of the spirit became
[1:12:54] nothing to them anymore that's why
[1:12:56] they're so cold-hearted they can destroy
[1:12:58] families destroy lives and they it's
[1:13:00] it's nothing to them they're they're
[1:13:02] like the epitome of psychopathic you
[1:13:04] know a psychopathic is someone that can
[1:13:07] do an evil thing to somebody and not
[1:13:08] feel any
[1:13:09] remorse or anything and there's no
[1:13:11] emotion attached to it they're insane
[1:13:14] that's the devil that's the devil in
[1:13:16] them because the devil doesn't care
[1:13:19] he is just there's no good in him
[1:13:23] he can't have good in him because he
[1:13:24] crossed that line we're in right now on
[1:13:26] earth we're in the middle of it all
[1:13:28] hello we're here
[1:13:30] and it's getting and the battle's raging
[1:13:32] like never before
[1:13:34] all right
[1:13:35] amen who believes that
[1:13:37] this is the the you think and i'll read
[1:13:39] it and i'll get to it but you see the
[1:13:42] devil's angry
[1:13:43] because he knows that he's got a very
[1:13:46] short time left
[1:13:48] if you had a very short time left
[1:13:50] you would be very whatever you were
[1:13:52] going to be doing you would do it really
[1:13:53] good wouldn't you you'd just be like i'm
[1:13:55] going to give it everything right
[1:13:56] and i would trust that that's for a good
[1:13:59] so if you had two hours left
[1:14:02] to do something good for people and you
[1:14:03] wanted to tell them what you know
[1:14:06] you wouldn't just go waste that would
[1:14:08] you
[1:14:08] i wouldn't waste that two hours man i'll
[1:14:10] be going oh my i don't know what i'd do
[1:14:13] but if i knew i'm god's taking me i'm
[1:14:15] going to go up in a chariot whatever i
[1:14:17] do for these last two hours
[1:14:21] so you can you imagine now here's this
[1:14:24] devil that's going to lose everything
[1:14:26] he's going to lose all his plans
[1:14:27] everything's going to be forward he's
[1:14:28] going to be he's angry
[1:14:29] assistant here i'll read you
[1:14:32] he says
[1:14:34] and the oh
[1:14:36] and his angels were cast out with him
[1:14:38] and i heard a loud voice saying in
[1:14:41] heaven
[1:14:42] now is come salvation
[1:14:45] and strength and the kingdom of our god
[1:14:47] and the power of his christ for the
[1:14:49] accuser of our brethren is cast down
[1:14:52] amen which accused them before our god
[1:14:55] day and night oh my you know we we
[1:14:58] we we get that sometimes you know and
[1:15:01] they overcame him by the blood of the
[1:15:03] lamb and by the word of their testimony
[1:15:05] and they love not their lives unto the
[1:15:07] death
[1:15:09] now i don't want you to
[1:15:11] don't think oh that's a future thing and
[1:15:13] we're going to look back and reminisce
[1:15:14] on that
[1:15:16] this is current
[1:15:17] it's happening now it's going to happen
[1:15:19] there too but it's happening now all
[1:15:22] right and it's happened before there's
[1:15:24] three well this might be more but we
[1:15:26] don't want to go too deep into types and
[1:15:28] things and obscure ideas but there is
[1:15:31] three real major events that this is
[1:15:34] speaking of
[1:15:36] but i'll read this last verse first
[1:15:37] therefore rejoice
[1:15:39] ye heavens
[1:15:41] do you know what that means that means
[1:15:43] rejoice ye christians
[1:15:46] you're already heavens you know you're
[1:15:48] part of heaven so when it says rejoice
[1:15:50] your heavens it's saying rejoice
[1:15:52] shekinah tabernacle
[1:15:54] rejoice on the tape
[1:15:56] rejoice in the camera there wherever
[1:15:58] you're at rejoice
[1:16:00] hallelujah
[1:16:02] and you that dwell in them woe to the
[1:16:04] inhabitants of the earth and of the sea
[1:16:07] sea
[1:16:08] for the devil has come down unto you
[1:16:11] having great wrath because he knoweth
[1:16:13] that he hath but a short time
[1:16:17] i'm sick of the accuser raven he's
[1:16:19] raving on and on and on you know a
[1:16:22] chipmunk
[1:16:23] but remember you're an eagle
[1:16:26] amen
[1:16:27] so this chipmunk just raving on and on
[1:16:29] and he's always at you he's always
[1:16:31] trying to fire thoughts at you to make
[1:16:33] you feel negative about this angry about
[1:16:35] that this is this is not right and
[1:16:37] that's not right and all these things to
[1:16:39] make you start to focus on standing
[1:16:42] against things
[1:16:43] you see yes we should be against evil
[1:16:46] but i tell you and this is the balance
[1:16:47] here for this thought right
[1:16:49] if you want to stand against something
[1:16:51] stand for something
[1:16:53] you got to stand for something real and
[1:16:55] let him stand against it for you
[1:16:57] you know a lot of people they stand
[1:16:59] against everything but they're not
[1:17:00] really standing for something and they
[1:17:01] lose their identity
[1:17:04] do you know that
[1:17:05] you lose your identity by becoming a
[1:17:08] stand against ministry or a critical
[1:17:10] ministry or a conspiracy theorist and
[1:17:13] you but you lose your identity you lose
[1:17:16] it because you're not stan you've lost
[1:17:18] your your pers you've lost your s your
[1:17:20] position
[1:17:22] momentarily
[1:17:24] but if we're in that condition today you
[1:17:26] will you'll have it back by the end of
[1:17:28] the service you'll have it back now if
[1:17:29] you want it back just take it back
[1:17:31] amen take it back
[1:17:34] glory
[1:17:36] you know
[1:17:37] we look at this and we think oh well
[1:17:39] this is a future event and yes it is
[1:17:41] this will happen we will physically go
[1:17:43] up we will physically
[1:17:45] be in heaven
[1:17:47] and we will physically rejoice
[1:17:49] and we will say we overcame him by the
[1:17:51] blood of the lamb and the word of our
[1:17:53] testimony and we died to our own will
[1:17:55] that's what that means they love not
[1:17:57] their lives unto the death it means that
[1:17:59] you were willing to surrender your will
[1:18:02] which is a very problematic thing you
[1:18:04] know
[1:18:05] the human will is a very very
[1:18:06] troublesome thing for us it gets us in
[1:18:09] trouble
[1:18:10] the devil uses it as leverage against us
[1:18:13] because he knows we have ambitions and
[1:18:14] he knows the fabric of our makeup and
[1:18:17] what our families did a few generations
[1:18:19] back and he begins to start pinpointing
[1:18:21] little things and starts to you know
[1:18:23] tempt us and he knows how that kind of
[1:18:25] work
[1:18:26] and he uses it against us but
[1:18:28] we overcame him by the blood of the lamb
[1:18:30] and the word of our testimony and we
[1:18:32] love not our lives unto death
[1:18:34] you know if you just really want to get
[1:18:36] get a bigger victory in your life this
[1:18:38] morning if you want a greater victory
[1:18:40] right now surrender your will
[1:18:43] just just surrender your plan
[1:18:46] and if you don't know what to surrender
[1:18:47] say lord what am i holding back he'll
[1:18:50] show you
[1:18:51] he'll show you you know because when we
[1:18:53] first got saved man we just and you
[1:18:55] really surrendered you surrendered all
[1:18:56] that you knew there was still things
[1:18:58] there that was still like hiding back
[1:19:00] somewhere that over the course of your
[1:19:02] next years and whatever sanctification
[1:19:05] he would he would begin to show you more
[1:19:07] he will begin to reveal to you look what
[1:19:09] you're holding on to here look at this
[1:19:11] grudge you're holding on to there look
[1:19:13] at this thing you did back when you were
[1:19:14] seven look at this thing over here that
[1:19:17] you you wanted to do and because of that
[1:19:20] event that's made you want to be this
[1:19:21] profession but actually i don't want you
[1:19:23] to be that profession i want you to be
[1:19:25] this
[1:19:26] but but you had this like fantasy
[1:19:29] and we get fantasies in our mind because
[1:19:31] of an impression that someone that we
[1:19:33] look up to made on us or something like
[1:19:36] that and therefore it becomes the
[1:19:38] fantasy becomes a value and the value
[1:19:40] becomes your identity
[1:19:42] did you know that your value what you
[1:19:44] value what your it becomes your identity
[1:19:46] and then your identity and what you live
[1:19:48] out becomes your culture and because
[1:19:50] these are this is where family spirits
[1:19:52] are formed and cultures are formed over
[1:19:54] generations
[1:19:56] because of what people value
[1:19:58] hallelujah but you see now i want to
[1:20:00] just talk quickly about this because
[1:20:01] this is this is just to grab the context
[1:20:04] but there are three of these heavenly
[1:20:05] wars where michael comes on the scene
[1:20:08] you know this sermon was going to be
[1:20:10] called when michael stood but i just it
[1:20:13] just wasn't personal enough
[1:20:15] you know i was praying about i was like
[1:20:16] no
[1:20:17] you know but when michael stood because
[1:20:19] see when michael stands if you read in
[1:20:21] the bible anywhere where michael is
[1:20:22] wrenching and he stands look out devil
[1:20:26] look outside
[1:20:27] look out chains look out bondage it's
[1:20:30] gone because michael stands and if you
[1:20:32] can just recognize this morning that
[1:20:34] michael has stood again
[1:20:36] in this generation
[1:20:38] will you watch i can you know i can hear
[1:20:40] the chains falling
[1:20:42] because michael has stood on our
[1:20:43] generation
[1:20:45] to bring total utter complete
[1:20:47] deliverance amen
[1:20:49] what was that song that brother oniya
[1:20:51] sung that was like i am totally
[1:20:52] delivered or something
[1:20:55] absolutely saved amen absolutely free
[1:20:58] jesus christ has set me absolutely free
[1:21:01] michael's stood on this generation i'm
[1:21:04] absolutely free
[1:21:05] who's absolutely free this morning
[1:21:08] amen
[1:21:09] you are
[1:21:10] you might not feel free some of you
[1:21:12] might be going through a trial you're
[1:21:14] still at if you just confess it
[1:21:17] amen and if you just walk and believe in
[1:21:20] the word
[1:21:22] consider yourself absolutely free
[1:21:25] because that trial that bondage whatever
[1:21:27] it may be the chain is broken
[1:21:30] because any chain that ever comes on
[1:21:32] anyone in their mind or whatever it may
[1:21:33] be has already been broken at calvary
[1:21:36] the power of the blood when he said
[1:21:39] it is finished
[1:21:41] amen
[1:21:42] when he said it is finished every chain
[1:21:45] that would ever go on any one of his
[1:21:46] people was broken right there
[1:21:49] even if it feels heavy there might be
[1:21:50] you might be clothed in them
[1:21:53] oh they're from generations back and
[1:21:55] it's all just been lumped on you like a
[1:21:56] big ball a chain ball
[1:21:59] doesn't matter it's all broken it's all
[1:22:01] broken
[1:22:02] this morning you can stand
[1:22:05] stand
[1:22:06] because this is the time what's the
[1:22:08] sermon called it's time to make your
[1:22:10] stand
[1:22:11] it's time
[1:22:13] glory
[1:22:15] oh my so
[1:22:17] the devil angry right this is where this
[1:22:19] is where it all became personal
[1:22:21] the devil got angry if we look at that
[1:22:23] right and we read that
[1:22:25] for the most part
[1:22:27] and for where john is sitting
[1:22:29] he's looking in a vision and he's in
[1:22:31] he's in eternity in the lord's day right
[1:22:33] he's up there he's looking at the vision
[1:22:36] and that's the biggest picture there is
[1:22:37] right that event but the real
[1:22:40] transpiration or how that vent event has
[1:22:43] happened
[1:22:44] it happened once
[1:22:45] right at the beginning when lucifer did
[1:22:47] the deed and he conceived iniquity he
[1:22:50] was kicked out he lost his first estate
[1:22:52] and the devils went down onto the earth
[1:22:54] but then what he did is he and through
[1:22:56] his shrewdness and his lies he entered
[1:22:59] into the human race
[1:23:01] and he began to trouble the human mind
[1:23:03] and he got into the human race how we
[1:23:05] know
[1:23:07] all the way through and it's come right
[1:23:08] up and now from the last 6 000 years he
[1:23:11] began he got higher and higher up and
[1:23:13] now he's worshipped
[1:23:15] he's found his throne again well he's
[1:23:18] found his throne within the human mind
[1:23:21] he's found his throne he's been
[1:23:24] glorified in this whole civilization and
[1:23:26] the monetary system and the whole
[1:23:27] economy and everything and all of these
[1:23:30] massive big denominational spires and
[1:23:33] and and huge saint peter's basilicas and
[1:23:36] and all that stuff who is being
[1:23:38] worshipped
[1:23:40] lucifer
[1:23:42] they even sing to lucifer do you know
[1:23:45] that
[1:23:46] you can translate those latin songs in
[1:23:48] the basilica and they are saying oh hail
[1:23:51] thou son of the morning o great lucifer
[1:23:55] king of darkness all those i might be
[1:23:58] just transliterating a little bit there
[1:23:59] but you watch you go you type in them
[1:24:01] you'll find it
[1:24:03] they openly
[1:24:05] it's a dark place
[1:24:06] but that's not all of it that's just
[1:24:08] what you can see there's a lot more
[1:24:10] going on behind the scenes
[1:24:12] what is it lucifer's managed to get up
[1:24:14] through the human race now
[1:24:16] now
[1:24:17] we're not void from that
[1:24:19] we were born in sin shaping an iniquity
[1:24:22] and we come to this world speaking lies
[1:24:25] now we need deliverance
[1:24:27] amen now
[1:24:29] what makes the devil angry is when he
[1:24:30] gets kicked out
[1:24:32] amen
[1:24:34] he gets real mad when he gets kicked out
[1:24:37] and as you grow this seed michael stood
[1:24:40] in this generation hey man you can say
[1:24:42] i'm going to read this and you can make
[1:24:44] this now this is happening in your life
[1:24:45] and there was war in andy
[1:24:48] michael and his angels fought against
[1:24:50] the dragon amen you can say there was
[1:24:53] war in me
[1:24:55] michael and his angels fought against
[1:24:58] the dragon
[1:24:59] amen he and it says and i'll read it in
[1:25:01] daniel 12 it wasn't to happen until the
[1:25:03] last days
[1:25:04] it wasn't to happen all the churches all
[1:25:07] the through the ages yes they were saved
[1:25:09] yes that bride they will come up in this
[1:25:12] the first resurrection of the ful the
[1:25:13] wise virgins and all of them and they
[1:25:16] they they had their pace and they had
[1:25:18] supernatural and they had miracles but
[1:25:21] it was only in the last day
[1:25:23] the last day
[1:25:25] where michael would stand
[1:25:27] to deliver his people
[1:25:29] totally
[1:25:31] absolute deliverance
[1:25:33] here we are saints
[1:25:35] we are in the last day
[1:25:36] if you find yourself burdened down by
[1:25:38] some bondage say oh lord if michael is
[1:25:42] here
[1:25:42] if michael stands for me then i'm going
[1:25:45] to stand for him
[1:25:47] and in standing here it is
[1:25:50] in standing
[1:25:51] you shall be delivered because your true
[1:25:54] identity will be revealed
[1:25:56] in standing
[1:25:58] but what he wants to do he wants to show
[1:26:00] you this about the vaccine and verse
[1:26:02] about some prince charles and this
[1:26:04] antichrist and all these other things
[1:26:06] and even even the real what it really is
[1:26:10] what it really is the antichrist really
[1:26:11] oh and he wants you to get all involved
[1:26:13] with that and then on top of that he
[1:26:14] wants you to have a big light big
[1:26:16] kingdom and and he'll give you all the
[1:26:18] stuff and he'll make you all this and
[1:26:20] that and everything to distract you
[1:26:23] from what you should really be standing
[1:26:24] for
[1:26:25] oh it's time to make your stand
[1:26:28] it's time
[1:26:30] children
[1:26:32] teenagers
[1:26:34] uh 20 year olds 30 40 50 is there any 70
[1:26:37] year olds
[1:26:38] i don't think so but
[1:26:40] listen it's time
[1:26:42] to make your stand
[1:26:44] whatever age group whatever decade you
[1:26:45] were born in make your stand this day
[1:26:49] and i'm sure i'm not i'm preaching to
[1:26:50] the choir right we're making our stand
[1:26:52] but i just want to add some color
[1:26:55] who wants some color color in your stand
[1:26:57] this morning just say no this is it this
[1:26:59] is me this is what i stand for i stand
[1:27:02] for the message of the hour i stand for
[1:27:04] my jesus i stand because michael has
[1:27:07] stood in this generation i'm gonna stand
[1:27:08] with michael in fact i'll tell you now
[1:27:11] michael stands in me
[1:27:13] do you know that the great mighty angel
[1:27:16] spiritually speaking my you know what i
[1:27:19] mean
[1:27:20] this is the this is the power of god
[1:27:21] this is god's arrow of deliverance
[1:27:24] because there has to come a time where a
[1:27:26] people that's natural on the earth
[1:27:29] leave the earth and if you want to leave
[1:27:30] the earth you need something more than
[1:27:33] just a dry-eyed confession or a message
[1:27:36] religion
[1:27:37] you need something more than just a
[1:27:39] then i know the prophet was sent and i
[1:27:42] know this and that you need something
[1:27:43] real
[1:27:45] and it's time to make a stand because
[1:27:47] when you make a stand
[1:27:49] i'm not saying you know whether you're
[1:27:51] filled with the holy ghost or you're
[1:27:52] going to be filled make your stand
[1:27:54] because when you define that
[1:27:57] when you make definition to it real
[1:27:59] definition
[1:28:00] watch what happens
[1:28:02] you watch what happens
[1:28:05] so
[1:28:06] you're growing
[1:28:07] because of this anointing that's upon us
[1:28:10] because of the hour that we live in we
[1:28:12] are being you're the word that's coming
[1:28:14] to you the deliverance the power the
[1:28:16] glory
[1:28:18] believe for it
[1:28:19] because
[1:28:20] watch what happens
[1:28:22] you grow you are coming more and more
[1:28:25] like christ from glory to glory and as
[1:28:27] you go from glory to glory and from
[1:28:30] glory to glory the devil is losing his
[1:28:33] position in your life and he's being
[1:28:35] pulled out of heaven he's being pulled
[1:28:37] out of this he's being pulled out of
[1:28:39] this he's being pulled down until he's
[1:28:41] on the ground
[1:28:43] hallelujah
[1:28:45] that's the transaction
[1:28:47] that's taking place but watch out
[1:28:50] i'm not trying to put fear on you but
[1:28:52] remember be diligent and faithful to the
[1:28:54] lord and let him lead
[1:28:58] because the devil is angry
[1:29:00] more than ever before because he knows
[1:29:02] that what's going on in your life and
[1:29:04] these messages that you're hearing and
[1:29:06] the tapes that you're listening to have
[1:29:08] got rapturing faith on them and that
[1:29:10] rapturing faith is raising a standard in
[1:29:13] your life beyond any age there's ever
[1:29:15] been
[1:29:17] you are going higher and higher from
[1:29:19] glory to glory higher than any other
[1:29:21] glory that there's ever been
[1:29:24] we're not any better we're not doing any
[1:29:26] better
[1:29:26] physically
[1:29:28] intellectually it's just because we're
[1:29:30] subject to god's divine plan
[1:29:33] his plan is to raise up a people above
[1:29:36] all that to pull lucifer out of his
[1:29:39] position completely but he's angry but
[1:29:42] the thing is here it is when he's angry
[1:29:45] the trials that you go through and the
[1:29:47] challenges that you face become harder
[1:29:50] but they're necessary for you to come
[1:29:53] into divine character
[1:29:55] because with divine character god can
[1:29:57] release to you the miraculous
[1:29:59] god can release to you the spoken word
[1:30:02] god can place back in your hands what
[1:30:04] the first adam lost what the second
[1:30:06] animal displayed and what brother
[1:30:07] branham's ministry came to when he began
[1:30:09] to speak and it happened and the storm
[1:30:12] was there and he said claire four days
[1:30:13] sun shall shine it did the squirrel
[1:30:15] shall come from there and it did and all
[1:30:17] these things would happen his wife had a
[1:30:19] big tumor the size of a baseball before
[1:30:22] the doctor scalpel touches her it will
[1:30:25] not be there
[1:30:27] who can testify was it there
[1:30:30] no
[1:30:31] who believes that that is for you it's
[1:30:34] for you
[1:30:35] it's time to make a stand this is what
[1:30:37] we stand for
[1:30:39] we are standing for the total
[1:30:41] deliverance we are standing for a
[1:30:43] message that's come to rapture us out of
[1:30:45] here
[1:30:46] amen take a stand
[1:30:48] in that stand your identity shall become
[1:30:51] clearer
[1:31:02] that's why there's such a fuss
[1:31:04] you know you think why is there such a
[1:31:06] fuss going on i seem to grow a little
[1:31:08] bit i seem to get more of god in me and
[1:31:11] all of a sudden things just get harder
[1:31:13] why is that because the devil is scared
[1:31:17] he's like a rabid wild animal an untamed
[1:31:19] beast
[1:31:20] and he's scared of you
[1:31:23] he's real scared
[1:31:24] so he's using everything he can
[1:31:27] everything he can to stop you growing
[1:31:28] anymore because the more you grow the
[1:31:30] more he gets cast out and the sooner the
[1:31:32] rap is going to take place
[1:31:34] all right
[1:31:38] and the fourth seal the prophet says
[1:31:42] all right notice now he'll be given a
[1:31:44] heart of a beast at that time
[1:31:46] and satan will incarnate himself because
[1:31:49] when the church goes up satan is cast
[1:31:51] out
[1:31:52] now that's the third
[1:31:54] that's the third
[1:31:56] manifestation of revelation 12 where we
[1:31:59] physically go up right now we're
[1:32:01] spiritually going up right now we're
[1:32:04] being spiritually built in christ jesus
[1:32:06] right now we're coming into a spiritual
[1:32:08] awakening but you see
[1:32:11] there will come a time where that
[1:32:12] spiritual awakening reaches its zenith
[1:32:15] which is the the very
[1:32:17] height the it becomes it's ready
[1:32:20] perfected
[1:32:22] and remember i don't know someone said
[1:32:24] it but
[1:32:25] he which began a good work in me
[1:32:27] shall
[1:32:28] complete it until the day of jesus
[1:32:30] christ
[1:32:32] he will not leave you nor forsake you
[1:32:34] when you can put your finger on a moment
[1:32:36] where god did something in your life
[1:32:38] just remember god will never leave you
[1:32:41] god will not leave you unfinished
[1:32:44] you might feel like oh my nothing's been
[1:32:46] happening in my life for so long
[1:32:48] but remember you go back to where god
[1:32:51] started something
[1:32:52] go back there stand for that
[1:32:55] stand for it it doesn't matter if it was
[1:32:57] 30 years ago stand for it
[1:33:00] make a stand and say i'm going from
[1:33:02] right there
[1:33:03] right at that spot i'm going to start
[1:33:05] from there and i'm going to build and
[1:33:06] i'm going gonna have a real identity i'm
[1:33:08] gonna stand for this hallelujah
[1:33:11] oh my there is a power when you make a
[1:33:14] stand it has to be your stand not my
[1:33:16] stand not brother ben's stand amen not
[1:33:19] just a stand of the church it has to be
[1:33:22] yours
[1:33:24] you young children
[1:33:26] you have to make a stand
[1:33:28] alleluia you might not understand every
[1:33:30] word that's being preached but make a
[1:33:32] stand
[1:33:33] make a stand
[1:33:35] hallelujah because you see god he loves
[1:33:38] it when somebody just says yes i believe
[1:33:41] this and i'm gonna stand for this and
[1:33:42] i'm gonna really you know i'm gonna
[1:33:44] really i'm gonna have courage and i'm
[1:33:46] gonna be a little bit proud about this
[1:33:48] you know in a good way
[1:33:50] not a not an evil pride but
[1:33:52] whatever the other word is a positive
[1:33:54] pride
[1:33:56] confident
[1:33:57] have confidence in god
[1:33:59] be confident of god
[1:34:03] but so that third one is when we
[1:34:04] physically go up and then we're up there
[1:34:07] in a rapture
[1:34:09] but and when we go up
[1:34:11] because you see when we go up now
[1:34:12] lucifer loses his hold completely in the
[1:34:15] bride out of her she pulls him out of
[1:34:18] heaven she pulls him out of any position
[1:34:20] that he once ever had because all of
[1:34:23] god's seed are taken and the holy ghost
[1:34:26] goes with them and then lucifer's out on
[1:34:29] the earth and look out world
[1:34:31] that's going to be the greatest
[1:34:32] tribulation
[1:34:34] but right now you are spiritually doing
[1:34:36] it and he's being pulled out of his
[1:34:37] position in your life he's becoming less
[1:34:39] and less powerful in your life and his
[1:34:41] and his law his lies and his thoughts
[1:34:43] you just brush them off
[1:34:45] and you walk you're walking and this
[1:34:47] chipmunk starts going at you again and
[1:34:49] you say no devil
[1:34:51] no get the hand satan and then it comes
[1:34:53] to a point where he's chattering you
[1:34:55] just keep walking
[1:34:56] he's going no you're just like
[1:34:58] nothing's happening here i don't even
[1:35:00] need to worry about you boy
[1:35:02] you're done
[1:35:03] hallelujah you don't even notice him
[1:35:08] but that makes him real angry
[1:35:10] he gets real upset but all he does is he
[1:35:12] kicks himself again because whatever
[1:35:14] trials that they can do you know they
[1:35:16] just get the bigger devils against you
[1:35:18] you know he gets scared he's like man
[1:35:19] we're going to get the heavies onto this
[1:35:20] one we've got to get the heavies on to
[1:35:22] these young people oh man because these
[1:35:24] guys are pulling devil out of their
[1:35:26] lives oh my
[1:35:28] hey man you guys are just a bunch of
[1:35:30] devil pullers
[1:35:31] pulling him out of his position
[1:35:33] pulling him down and stomping on him
[1:35:36] amen i think brother kaido said just
[1:35:38] write his name on the bottom of your
[1:35:40] shoe
[1:35:41] that's where he belongs
[1:35:42] you can stomp an impression of his own
[1:35:44] name on his head hallelujah
[1:35:47] amen make it final set to his seal his
[1:35:50] destruction
[1:35:52] hallelujah
[1:35:54] with a towel
[1:35:58] honestly we need a turbo intercooler
[1:36:01] above this thing
[1:36:03] i'm not a turbo or anything but it's hot
[1:36:07] oh my i'm gonna
[1:36:09] jesus
[1:36:10] help us
[1:36:12] amen
[1:36:14] i want to read from matt 22
[1:36:17] sorry
[1:36:18] matthew 10 32 to 33 it says here and i
[1:36:21] want to ask you who
[1:36:22] what or who are you standing for
[1:36:26] whosoever therefore shall confess me
[1:36:29] before men whom will i confess also
[1:36:32] before my father which is in heaven
[1:36:36] but whosoever shall deny me before men
[1:36:40] whom will i also deny
[1:36:42] before my father
[1:36:43] which is in heaven
[1:36:45] so i want to elevate
[1:36:48] in your mind right now and in your heart
[1:36:50] by the lord's grace the the the absolute
[1:36:53] importance of making a stand
[1:36:55] you cannot not make a stand
[1:36:58] it's of life or death
[1:37:00] that's so important and he says this
[1:37:02] because he knows that every true
[1:37:03] believer will make a stand you will push
[1:37:06] through like the lilly born in the mud
[1:37:09] you'll push through all the mud and up
[1:37:10] through the murky waters and one day
[1:37:12] your leaves will come out on the top of
[1:37:13] the pond and you will make a stand
[1:37:16] and your scent will go out to all the
[1:37:18] earth and it will begin to flourish
[1:37:20] because you finally get right in that
[1:37:22] light
[1:37:23] amen
[1:37:28] judgment begins at the house of god you
[1:37:30] know
[1:37:31] but we have to judge ourselves that we
[1:37:32] be not judged so when you hear these
[1:37:34] things
[1:37:35] you know these things might be your own
[1:37:37] testimony already but there's people in
[1:37:39] here that it's not
[1:37:40] amen but i think you know when i hear
[1:37:43] brother ben preaching and it's pretty
[1:37:44] stern i always own it for myself you
[1:37:46] know and sometimes it hurts
[1:37:49] it's hard but but that's good you need
[1:37:52] that you want to leave the server scout
[1:37:53] out don't don't get your defenders on
[1:37:56] you know you know like that you know
[1:37:58] some sort of um aerodynamic and you're
[1:38:00] just flying through you know avoiding it
[1:38:02] all
[1:38:03] don't avoid it just say lord
[1:38:05] i like that
[1:38:07] i want that you know or give me more of
[1:38:09] it hallelujah
[1:38:11] you know we should be malleable
[1:38:13] really malleable you know oh
[1:38:17] tinder
[1:38:18] and malleable you know like the wood
[1:38:20] that the ark's made out of
[1:38:22] the arcs made out they god said make the
[1:38:24] ark out of gopher wood because gopher
[1:38:26] wood was the softest
[1:38:28] most porous wood around that that was in
[1:38:30] that area
[1:38:32] and
[1:38:34] if you just take that go forward we're
[1:38:36] like into the gopher wood we should be
[1:38:38] porous and and soft
[1:38:41] but then when and he says now go and
[1:38:43] soak it and pitch
[1:38:45] the tar
[1:38:46] so he goes and gets the pitch of some
[1:38:48] tree that the sat and he paints it on or
[1:38:50] whatever he did i think it was um
[1:38:52] actually bitumen of some sort
[1:38:54] some sort of alkane i don't know that's
[1:38:56] probably too chemical you know like an
[1:38:58] actual like um oil like a like a tar but
[1:39:02] anyway so they put the pitch on and then
[1:39:05] because it's so porous this the holy
[1:39:08] spirit this the oil can soak right in
[1:39:10] deep to the wood then that soft wood
[1:39:14] becomes the toughest most buoyant
[1:39:16] material that they had
[1:39:18] amen all natural
[1:39:21] all natural and you know that that's
[1:39:23] like our own life
[1:39:25] so when you hear these things just just
[1:39:27] just be like go forward you know
[1:39:29] say yeah
[1:39:30] amen
[1:39:31] i humble myself lord i'm not gonna get
[1:39:34] uh agitated or i'm not gonna deflect
[1:39:37] these things
[1:39:38] and in john 13 20 because remember we're
[1:39:41] trying it's time to make your stand
[1:39:43] but you see now i'm putting the
[1:39:45] importance on the of on the stand itself
[1:39:47] he says here verily verily i say unto
[1:39:50] you
[1:39:51] he that receiveth whomsoever i send
[1:39:54] receiveth me
[1:39:56] and he that receiveth me receiveth him
[1:39:58] that sent me
[1:40:00] so you see now god jesus is standing
[1:40:02] there and he's basically saying i'm
[1:40:04] going to send people i'm going to send
[1:40:06] messengers i'm going to send a five-fold
[1:40:08] ministry i'm going to send
[1:40:10] prophets i'm going to send apostles and
[1:40:12] teachers and evangelists i'm going to
[1:40:14] send them
[1:40:16] and if you receive whom i send you
[1:40:18] receive me
[1:40:20] all right paul on the road to damascus
[1:40:23] met the pillar of fire
[1:40:24] and
[1:40:25] and and and he was he fell to the ground
[1:40:27] and and he said lord lord who are you
[1:40:30] and he said
[1:40:32] i am jesus
[1:40:33] whom thou
[1:40:34] persecutest
[1:40:36] paul wasn't alive paul wasn't on the
[1:40:38] scene when jesus was physically doing
[1:40:41] his thing right
[1:40:42] but it was the disciples it was jesus in
[1:40:45] the disciples so to receive peter was to
[1:40:48] receive jesus to receive
[1:40:51] james and john when they came and philip
[1:40:54] and and all of them was to receive jesus
[1:40:57] and then out through now the last two
[1:40:59] thousand years and all the church ages
[1:41:01] god has sent prophets he says i shall
[1:41:04] he says this i shall send prophets i
[1:41:06] shall send all these teachers
[1:41:08] and you go and i don't know i can't
[1:41:10] remember what he says after that but he
[1:41:11] says i'm going to do this
[1:41:13] so he had a plan and he sent ministers
[1:41:16] and prophets and major messengers to all
[1:41:18] these ages but he ascribes the reception
[1:41:21] of them
[1:41:22] as receiving him
[1:41:24] and when you see it
[1:41:26] when you see
[1:41:27] what god has sent
[1:41:29] to you
[1:41:30] and you know it's him
[1:41:31] he wants you to stand
[1:41:33] he wants you to make a righteous robust
[1:41:36] stand
[1:41:37] hallelujah
[1:41:42] and handwriting on the wall
[1:41:44] the prophet says o eternal god shake men
[1:41:48] tonight and woman
[1:41:50] before judgment shakes them
[1:41:52] may they come to mercy
[1:41:54] and make a stand for thy son
[1:41:58] remember
[1:42:00] to receive whom he sins
[1:42:03] amen
[1:42:04] you have to stand
[1:42:07] you have to receive it
[1:42:09] because when you see that it's actually
[1:42:11] christ's sent
[1:42:12] then it changes everything
[1:42:15] it's like when you listen to a sermon
[1:42:17] like if you sit here and you think oh
[1:42:18] andy's just waffling
[1:42:20] then you'll get nothing
[1:42:21] but if you believe that actually god is
[1:42:24] inspiring this guy and i'll you know i'm
[1:42:26] not going to put myself in any position
[1:42:28] like that but god is inspiring this guy
[1:42:31] let's just let's just use anybody but
[1:42:32] and you received the inspiration you go
[1:42:35] i know god speaking
[1:42:37] i know god's speaking to me you will get
[1:42:39] the reward
[1:42:41] but if you're just here to learn
[1:42:43] oh my you'll get some knowledge all
[1:42:45] right
[1:42:46] you can get knowledge but we want god
[1:42:49] and then we want to stand for god
[1:42:51] amen
[1:42:54] may they come to mercy and make a stand
[1:42:57] for thy son jesus
[1:42:59] instead of standing out there for some
[1:43:02] membership
[1:43:03] or some standing for something that's
[1:43:05] not right
[1:43:07] or can i say this
[1:43:11] standing
[1:43:12] for
[1:43:13] against all these things
[1:43:15] you know
[1:43:16] making a big show about what we're
[1:43:18] against and all these other things
[1:43:20] but what profit does it make us
[1:43:23] what does it actually do for us or the
[1:43:25] people that we
[1:43:27] share it all to and i've been involved
[1:43:28] with the um the these open brethren
[1:43:31] people and they get people from all over
[1:43:33] the world coming in
[1:43:34] great teachers
[1:43:36] great knowledge and theology
[1:43:38] but all they do is talk about how bad
[1:43:40] benny hinn is and how bad
[1:43:42] old td jakes and how bad this one is and
[1:43:46] i think
[1:43:48] you know
[1:43:48] just
[1:43:50] it's a waste of time
[1:43:52] but then they don't even talk about
[1:43:53] what's good about the message in god
[1:43:56] you know how can someone get saved you
[1:43:58] know
[1:43:59] what about delivering the people they're
[1:44:00] sitting there all smokers and drinkers
[1:44:03] and they're just stuck
[1:44:04] and there's deliverance for them and all
[1:44:06] they're thinking about is what they're
[1:44:07] against now don't get me wrong here i
[1:44:10] want to just balance the uh that like to
[1:44:13] stand
[1:44:14] against
[1:44:16] there's nothing wrong with being against
[1:44:17] stuff the prophet was against things
[1:44:19] actually the bible says to stand against
[1:44:21] the wiles and snares of the devil right
[1:44:23] but don't let that be your focus
[1:44:25] don't let that be the very thing that
[1:44:27] you do and what people know you for
[1:44:29] people shouldn't know you because of all
[1:44:30] the things that you don't like
[1:44:32] amen help me lord
[1:44:38] oh my you shouldn't be known for what
[1:44:40] you dislike
[1:44:41] you should be known for who you stand
[1:44:43] for who stands for jesus amen hallelujah
[1:44:47] oh my
[1:44:48] i stand for this message
[1:44:50] i stand for all of these things amen i
[1:44:53] stand for wholesome homes i stand for
[1:44:55] real marriages i stand for the baptism
[1:44:57] of the holy ghost amen i stand for
[1:45:00] changed lives for people to get a life
[1:45:02] change for people to get delivered i
[1:45:05] stand for the good old-fashioned
[1:45:06] pentecostal meetings amen
[1:45:09] hallelujah
[1:45:11] not some rock and roll work-up
[1:45:12] pentecostal i'm talking about a good
[1:45:14] old-fashioned day of pentecost original
[1:45:17] holy ghost outpouring that's what i
[1:45:19] stand for and that's what michael stands
[1:45:22] for because our michael that our jesus
[1:45:25] the angel of the lord has come down and
[1:45:27] he would come at the end time to make a
[1:45:29] stand for his people
[1:45:31] to push back all the forces of darkness
[1:45:33] so a bride could rise up
[1:45:36] you know that if he didn't come we would
[1:45:38] have no hope
[1:45:40] we would be swimming in darkness like
[1:45:41] the world
[1:45:43] and i'm talking scuba diving
[1:45:45] not just a little frolic on top in the
[1:45:47] paddling pool this world you think this
[1:45:50] is coming now

[1:45:53] judgment that flooded the earth and it
[1:45:55] covered mount everest that's what's
[1:45:57] happening spiritually

[1:46:00] this world has got a flood over it
[1:46:03] and it's called sin
[1:46:05] satan's eden
[1:46:07] you know in revelation 9 it said that
[1:46:08] smoke would smoke out of the pit
[1:46:10] well if you could see it visually
[1:46:13] it will be like even all the mountains
[1:46:15] is covered now in darkness
[1:46:17] but michael amen but my jesus

[1:48:00] daniel 12 1 it says here and at that day
[1:48:04] oh sorry and at that time shall michael
[1:48:07] stand up
[1:48:08] that great prince which standeth for the
[1:48:10] people for the children of thy people
[1:48:12] and there shall be a time of trouble
[1:48:14] such as never was since there was a
[1:48:16] nation even to the same that same time
[1:48:20] and at that time
[1:48:22] which is this time
[1:48:23] thy people shall be delivered
[1:48:26] oh my
[1:48:28] every one that shall be found written in
[1:48:30] the book hallelujah who believes they're
[1:48:33] written in the book
[1:48:34] oh my name is written in heaven
[1:48:37] oh it can make me shout oh i just i
[1:48:39] can't contain the joy
[1:48:41] hallelujah
[1:48:42] that my name is written in heaven
[1:48:45] hallelujah and we know daniel's people
[1:48:47] is the jewish people
[1:48:48] and we know that the messiah came to the
[1:48:50] jews first and he and he had three and a
[1:48:53] half year ministry to them
[1:48:55] and he was introduced by john the
[1:48:56] baptist under the spirit of elijah
[1:48:58] we know this but then there's this whole
[1:49:01] 2000 then he was cut off by the priest
[1:49:03] sacrificed their own messiah
[1:49:06] made a sacrifice for the sins of the
[1:49:08] whole world
[1:49:10] blinded by their own religion
[1:49:13] and then there's two thousand years
[1:49:15] where the very the privilege of what he
[1:49:18] came for came to the gentiles and the
[1:49:20] very
[1:49:21] the very the best of it all the one
[1:49:25] that at the wedding oh my it's all just
[1:49:28] flowing out
[1:49:29] at the evening kana wedding
[1:49:31] when was the wine the best one
[1:49:34] served
[1:49:35] here we are at the end of the wedding
[1:49:37] all right
[1:49:39] the best wine has been saved for you
[1:49:42] oh why
[1:49:43] it's it's got a greater effect
[1:49:46] to bring you higher than ever before
[1:49:49] so that even the master of the feast
[1:49:51] would stand and say oh my no one ever
[1:49:53] does this but you did it who did it he
[1:49:55] did it
[1:49:56] jesus did it
[1:49:58] hallelujah
[1:49:59] amen
[1:50:01] and then right at the end time right
[1:50:03] when it's about to change back over to
[1:50:05] the jews
[1:50:06] this deliverance
[1:50:08] this michael that would stand
[1:50:10] for the people
[1:50:12] daniel's people would stand for you
[1:50:14] first
[1:50:15] because you have to leave first
[1:50:17] the bride amen that ministry that when
[1:50:20] the jews get delivered happens after we
[1:50:22] leave
[1:50:23] so what does god do just before the end
[1:50:26] and just before all the crossover he
[1:50:28] sends another man anointed with the
[1:50:30] spirit of elijah and in 1933 or seven or
[1:50:32] whatever it was on the river jordan ohio
[1:50:35] river he says
[1:50:37] the pillar of fire came down in front of
[1:50:39] everybody it was in the newspapers
[1:50:41] it said as john the baptist was set to
[1:50:43] forerun the first coming so sent i you
[1:50:46] with a message to forum the second
[1:50:48] coming
[1:50:49] your message shall introduce the messiah
[1:50:51] to the gentiles after they've gone all
[1:50:54] into strain all denominations and all
[1:50:56] the darkness and all the conspiracies
[1:50:58] and everything
[1:51:00] there would be something real
[1:51:02] there would be a definite revelation of
[1:51:05] michael this mighty angel this lord this
[1:51:07] one that purchased it all for us
[1:51:10] our redeemer our kinsmen
[1:51:12] hallelujah he would come
[1:51:14] hallelujah he would stand
[1:51:17] and there would be a people
[1:51:19] that would see it and recognize their
[1:51:21] privilege and recognize i'm so
[1:51:24] privileged
[1:51:25] where there's a sea of darkness
[1:51:26] everywhere and here comes michael down
[1:51:29] you know you've got revelation chapter 9
[1:51:31] and all that smoke came out and it
[1:51:33] flooded the earth and all these people
[1:51:34] and everything is just in sin and
[1:51:36] darkness they can't see you look up at
[1:51:38] sin down at sin all around you is sin
[1:51:42] you can't get through it
[1:51:44] and then someone gives you a book
[1:51:46] hallelujah someone gives you a little
[1:51:49] book or someone gives you a tape or
[1:51:51] someone says something to you
[1:51:53] and there's a seed inside you that says
[1:51:55] it just starts to grow it says yes
[1:51:58] all of a sudden
[1:52:00] you know you go on a journey that ends
[1:52:02] with michael
[1:52:04] the mighty angel himself with an open
[1:52:06] book comes down
[1:52:08] into your life
[1:52:10] what is he coming down to do
[1:52:12] to take away the darkness
[1:52:15] amen a visitation for you personally so
[1:52:18] that you can see what you need to stand
[1:52:21] for
[1:52:22] because you've got to make a stand today
[1:52:24] don't leave the service
[1:52:26] without making a stand
[1:52:28] amen when we finish
[1:52:30] we're going to pray
[1:52:32] and even if you have made a stand
[1:52:33] because i'm sure there's many stands
[1:52:35] been made we're going to make another
[1:52:36] stand amen who's ready to make a stand
[1:52:40] hallelujah who's ready to add definition
[1:52:42] to their stand hallelujah amen declaring
[1:52:46] you know john when he saw the seals open
[1:52:48] all heaven all and hit under the earth
[1:52:50] and all on the earth heard him cry
[1:52:52] oh yeah well we're going to just arrow
[1:52:54] we're just going to continue that cry
[1:52:56] that was shout that rejoice
[1:52:59] amen we're going to make our stand
[1:53:02] with michael
[1:53:03] amen
[1:53:05] michael is a type of christ
[1:53:07] i don't i don't know whether he's an
[1:53:09] actual individual angel a separate
[1:53:10] person or not but in the scripture he's
[1:53:13] also a type of christ and he serves
[1:53:14] christ and
[1:53:16] it does seem very much like he is christ
[1:53:20] in angelic form
[1:53:22] but also christ manifests himself in
[1:53:24] many forms he manifests himself in the
[1:53:26] pillar of fire and in the form of the
[1:53:29] the flesh that he uh was crucified in
[1:53:31] which was made a little lower than the
[1:53:33] angels he was he's manifested in in all
[1:53:36] sorts of different forms because god is
[1:53:38] not subject to geography or to
[1:53:40] metamorphosis in any way he can do
[1:53:42] whatever he wants look at the creation
[1:53:44] and the nature he created all right
[1:53:46] but just because god manifests himself
[1:53:48] in a different person or a different way
[1:53:51] it doesn't make him a separate person
[1:53:53] this is where trinitarianism went off
[1:53:56] and but divided god into all these
[1:53:58] different pantheons of people
[1:54:00] you know you know benny hinn now i'm
[1:54:02] probably preaching against myself here
[1:54:03] now but i just want to show you how that
[1:54:06] works because benny in all his own
[1:54:08] things he can do whatever he wants right
[1:54:09] he's doing what he thinks is right now
[1:54:12] he believes there's nine people in the
[1:54:14] godhead you know that
[1:54:16] because of all the apparitions and
[1:54:18] any time that god was manifested in some
[1:54:20] form became a person to him that's the
[1:54:23] way trinitarianism works father son and
[1:54:25] holy ghost is the same god
[1:54:28] same person but manifested in different
[1:54:30] forms and in time or eternity
[1:54:33] you've got time and eternity amen so we
[1:54:36] don't want to get caught up in those
[1:54:38] things but remember michael is here and
[1:54:40] i just wanted to share that with you so
[1:54:41] you understand when i say michael i'm
[1:54:43] talking about the mighty angel i'm
[1:54:45] talking about christ coming an angelic
[1:54:47] form amen i'm talking about the lord
[1:54:49] coming spiritually in such a way to
[1:54:52] change the people to deliver the people
[1:54:54] to take you and well let me just say
[1:54:56] this to to to to to just write the
[1:54:59] pattern of our teenagers who are being
[1:55:01] distracted who are being troubled who
[1:55:03] are struggling even to come to church
[1:55:05] they're sitting in their homes right now
[1:55:07] in a mental battle mental warfare do you
[1:55:10] see that as impossible because i do
[1:55:12] that's an impossible because this world
[1:55:14] is pulling them so hard
[1:55:16] this world and the devil's using them
[1:55:18] against their own mind and they're just
[1:55:20] drinking in sinful things all day right
[1:55:23] now probably playing evil stuff but
[1:55:27] god works in the impossible
[1:55:29] and i prayed for this and you see
[1:55:31] michael's come down in this generation
[1:55:34] and even though it looks impossible you
[1:55:36] watch you speak and you make your stand
[1:55:38] this morning and you watch what happens
[1:55:40] to them
[1:55:41] amen
[1:55:43] i prayed
[1:55:45] uh that's another sermon which i'll
[1:55:47] preach one day from zechariah 4.
[1:55:50] but
[1:55:51] to me
[1:55:52] the lord likened our youth situation
[1:55:55] like what zerubbabel was facing
[1:56:00] you know
[1:56:01] they had a time of discouragement and
[1:56:03] you may be in a time of discouragement
[1:56:05] because of what you see in your children
[1:56:06] and the struggles and what they're going
[1:56:08] through you may be in that time just
[1:56:10] like zerubbabel but remember god he came
[1:56:13] to encourage the rubell he said i'm
[1:56:15] going to wear you like a signet
[1:56:17] i'm going to put you on my ring finger
[1:56:20] and i'm going to seal i'm going to break
[1:56:22] those mountains i'm going to loose those
[1:56:23] impossibilities and they're going to
[1:56:25] come
[1:56:26] that temple's going to be finished
[1:56:28] you're building that temple as a rubber
[1:56:30] ball i'm going to anoint you and
[1:56:32] all the stuff against you and all these
[1:56:34] other people and everything and all the
[1:56:35] world is distracting and it's all taking
[1:56:37] these video games and everything in life
[1:56:39] and all of it
[1:56:40] but i
[1:56:42] i'm gonna break all that down and
[1:56:44] they're gonna come in
[1:56:46] amen
[1:56:47] the temple is made of living stone
[1:56:50] zerubbabel's temple was a physical
[1:56:52] temple
[1:56:53] struggles
[1:56:55] all the devil everything against it
[1:56:57] but god says aruba i'm going to use you
[1:56:59] like a signet
[1:57:01] i'm going to wear you like a ring and
[1:57:02] i'm going to seal that temple and all
[1:57:04] the people in it
[1:57:06] and so all of these ones that we see has
[1:57:08] gone astray and stuck and they're
[1:57:10] struggling and unbelief is shrouding
[1:57:12] their minds i rebuke that spirit of
[1:57:15] unbelief in the name of jesus christ
[1:57:18] they shall be part of the temple
[1:57:20] and and it says here who art thou o
[1:57:22] great mountain before zerubbabel for
[1:57:24] thou behold you shall be made a plain
[1:57:26] and that was the promise i was given
[1:57:29] i was given that promise
[1:57:31] that the mountain of impossibility that
[1:57:33] we see
[1:57:34] with our young people
[1:57:36] facing because they i s because i said
[1:57:38] lord
[1:57:39] what is it what can we offer them that's
[1:57:41] better than all the tantalizing sin
[1:57:43] that's out there that can instantly be
[1:57:45] enjoying a soap opera or instantly be
[1:57:47] enjoying some drug or instantly be
[1:57:50] getting drunk and having all these
[1:57:51] friends around them and it's all just
[1:57:52] wonderful oh so good what can we offer
[1:57:55] and you know what it is it's the baptism
[1:57:56] of the holy ghost

[1:58:26] so that i can sit in the service and
[1:58:28] rejoice i can sit in the service and the
[1:58:30] devil doesn't know what to do with me

[1:58:53] he's cunning and he'll use thoughts
[1:58:57] that you think are your own
[1:58:59] because he knows what you say
[1:59:01] and he remembers it all
[1:59:03] and he comes at you with thoughts that
[1:59:04] you think are yours
[1:59:08] make a stand today

[1:59:23] daniel
[1:59:25] thy people shall be delivered
[1:59:28] i said all that so that you don't just
[1:59:29] sit there and think oh that's about jews
[1:59:32] it's about israel and it is
[1:59:34] because daniel was in israelite
[1:59:36] but remember the covenant that they
[1:59:38] pursue
[1:59:39] and and
[1:59:40] at the first coming we'll come back to
[1:59:42] them and yes michael will come down for
[1:59:44] them
[1:59:45] he'll stand on the great mount of olives
[1:59:47] hallelujah whatever he does
[1:59:49] i'm not familiar completely with it all
[1:59:51] but he'll do that he'll come down and
[1:59:53] he'll deliver them
[1:59:54] and they'll come out and it'll be a
[1:59:56] wonderful time and but that happens for
[1:59:59] you first
[2:00:00] amen
[2:00:03] my people shall be delivered
[2:00:05] i just think shall be delivered
[2:00:08] anything else is false
[2:00:10] when you look at it and you think oh
[2:00:13] this can't happen
[2:00:14] look at all this
[2:00:16] it's saying this and that and everything
[2:00:18] all these family issues and whatever it
[2:00:19] may be that's holding everything back
[2:00:22] don't worry about that
[2:00:23] they shall be delivered amen
[2:00:27] this is god's word we believe it who
[2:00:29] believes for it
[2:00:30] everyone that shall be found written in
[2:00:33] the book
[2:00:34] delivered house of hell
[2:00:37] give way to the name of
[2:00:39] amen what happened after he said that
[2:00:42] you could hear cranking and creaking and
[2:00:45] bars moving because there's nothing too
[2:00:47] hard for my god
[2:00:49] amen
[2:00:50] you think it's impossible well let's
[2:00:52] have a look daniel was in babylon he was
[2:00:55] right up at the government level
[2:00:57] and
[2:00:58] you know that there's principalities and
[2:01:00] powers and demons and devils and
[2:01:02] everything china they control babylon
[2:01:03] they control world powers they control
[2:01:05] political systems so here we have now we
[2:01:08] have daniel now praying
[2:01:10] and listen to this he says and he's and
[2:01:12] and then he had a visitation of an angel
[2:01:14] and the angel gabriel came to daniel
[2:01:17] i think it was gabriel but anyway this
[2:01:18] angel doesn't um
[2:01:20] he doesn't identify himself but he says
[2:01:22] and he said unto me oh daniel oh man
[2:01:23] greatly beloved
[2:01:26] understand the words that i speak unto
[2:01:28] thee
[2:01:29] and stand upright
[2:01:32] now we're in mystery babylon and we've
[2:01:34] been called to stand stand upright
[2:01:37] for unto thee i am now sent and when he
[2:01:39] had spoken this word unto me i stood
[2:01:42] trembling
[2:01:43] then he said unto me fear not daniel
[2:01:46] for from the first day that thou didst
[2:01:49] set thine heart to understand
[2:01:51] and to chasten thyself before thy god
[2:01:54] thy words were heard and i am come for
[2:01:57] thy words
[2:01:59] so you can see now
[2:02:01] but he says here but the prince of the
[2:02:03] kingdom of persia which is the devil the
[2:02:05] the the head devil over persia withstood
[2:02:08] me
[2:02:09] so here's this
[2:02:10] here's a guy he's a prophet and he's
[2:02:12] praying and he's waiting for the lord
[2:02:14] and he needs an answer for something
[2:02:16] and here there's there's an angel sent
[2:02:18] to him to to show him the message
[2:02:21] and there's a demons resisting him
[2:02:24] so he's fighting for you right he's
[2:02:26] fighting for us so the moment that you
[2:02:28] begin to pray
[2:02:30] this is warfare taking place
[2:02:32] and god's fighting for you
[2:02:35] so just sometimes you won't see the
[2:02:36] answer straight away because what you're
[2:02:38] asking for is a big thing amen amen what
[2:02:41] you may be asking for there's resistance
[2:02:43] in the heavenly realms but remember
[2:02:47] who stands for you listen to this
[2:02:49] amen listen to this mate take notice of
[2:02:51] this
[2:02:52] prince of persia stood me one in 21 days
[2:02:56] but lo
[2:02:57] michael
[2:02:58] one of the chief princes came to help me
[2:03:01] oh my and i remain there with the
[2:03:04] prince's kings of persia so you see now
[2:03:06] even when it gets hard and when the
[2:03:08] battle is huge and you think it's
[2:03:09] impossible
[2:03:11] who's come down
[2:03:13] who stands for you today
[2:03:15] who's standing for you right now who's
[2:03:17] standing to see your children come in
[2:03:19] who's standing to see you children
[2:03:22] get saved
[2:03:24] break through the veneer of this world
[2:03:26] break through all of the lies and
[2:03:27] deceptions and the smoke and the mirrors
[2:03:29] and everything who stands for you
[2:03:32] now jesus
[2:03:34] he's standing for you today
[2:03:35] he stands for you
[2:03:38] and i will stand for a god that stands
[2:03:40] for me and in standing for him my
[2:03:44] identity shall be concreted
[2:03:47] does that make sense concreted
[2:03:49] solidified
[2:03:51] manifested
[2:03:52] my identity
[2:03:54] you see if our identity is not strong
[2:03:57] if our stand is not strong
[2:03:59] you know standing and knowing what you
[2:04:01] stand for and declaring it
[2:04:03] and speaking it and living it
[2:04:07] that weakens your identity if you don't
[2:04:17] in the beginning and ending of the just
[2:04:19] gentile dispensation
[2:04:21] the prophet says this says he says it's
[2:04:23] time to it says at that day michael
[2:04:25] shall stand for the people
[2:04:26] he ain't standing for the nations he is
[2:04:29] standing for the people
[2:04:31] and many of those that sleep in the dust
[2:04:33] of the earth
[2:04:35] some shall rise to everlasting shame and
[2:04:37] contentment
[2:04:38] but those that be wise and turn many to
[2:04:40] righteousness
[2:04:42] shall shine as the stars forever and
[2:04:44] ever
[2:04:46] what is it
[2:04:47] i've walked out and looked at that great
[2:04:49] morning star
[2:04:51] as she begins to move yonder
[2:04:54] what does the morning star say
[2:04:56] the morning star is only reflecting
[2:04:59] the supreme light of the sun coming
[2:05:02] in is that right you know the morning
[2:05:05] star who knows what the morning the
[2:05:06] morning star is venus
[2:05:08] it's not a star it's a planet
[2:05:10] so the morning star
[2:05:12] is actually a planet that doesn't have
[2:05:14] its own light it reflects the light of
[2:05:17] the sun as it's just the sun the earth
[2:05:20] is here the sun just comes up the light
[2:05:22] shines over the earth reflects on venus
[2:05:25] and that venus then reflects the light
[2:05:28] of the coming sun
[2:05:31] so it says here the morning star is only
[2:05:34] reflecting the supreme light of the sun
[2:05:36] coming
[2:05:37] is that right the morning star the
[2:05:40] reason it's so bright you know why it is
[2:05:43] the sun is so much closer to it it's
[2:05:45] just the pressing on and the morning
[2:05:47] star hails the coming of the sun
[2:05:51] and then he says this and i want to say
[2:05:53] this to you
[2:05:54] all right you morning stars
[2:05:57] it's time to go hailing is coming
[2:06:01] shine morning stars
[2:06:05] it's time to stand for the coming son
[2:06:07] who has stood
[2:06:09] for us
[2:06:11] he this the the you see you it's not
[2:06:13] just brother branham and a prophet
[2:06:14] messenger who who who fulfilled that
[2:06:18] light of a morning star to reflect the
[2:06:20] light of the coming sun no it's actually
[2:06:22] you as well
[2:06:23] you become part you are a morning star
[2:06:25] you when you make a stand what do you
[2:06:28] what does the stand do when you make a
[2:06:30] real stand a righteous standard stand
[2:06:32] for this truth your stand what happens
[2:06:35] is the clouds dispel and you begin to
[2:06:37] shine the light of the coming sun you
[2:06:39] begin to reflect the light that is
[2:06:41] declaring the lord has come
[2:06:44] in your life he's come down to you he's
[2:06:47] come into you he stands for you
[2:06:50] and we are called to reflect
[2:06:52] this
[2:06:54] do you know where you stand
[2:06:57] do you know where you stand
[2:07:00] one and all
[2:07:03] it says here
[2:07:05] in the church age book it says but but
[2:07:07] the book of revelation shows how that
[2:07:08] the antichrist spirit would come into
[2:07:10] the church and defile it
[2:07:13] making it lukewarm
[2:07:17] formal
[2:07:18] see these are all demons if a church
[2:07:20] gets lukewarm it's a devil influence if
[2:07:23] the church becomes formal it's a devil
[2:07:25] if the church becomes powerless it's a
[2:07:27] devil
[2:07:29] but the book of revelation he says it
[2:07:31] exposes satan
[2:07:32] revealing his works
[2:07:34] the attempted destruction of god's
[2:07:36] people
[2:07:37] and the discrediting of god's word
[2:07:40] right down to the time
[2:07:42] he has cast into the lake of fire
[2:07:45] he fights that
[2:07:47] he cannot stand it
[2:07:49] and he knows
[2:07:50] the devil knows that if the people
[2:07:53] get the true revelation of the true
[2:07:55] church
[2:07:56] and here it is for me here for this
[2:07:58] context and what she is
[2:08:00] and what she stands for
[2:08:03] what are you standing for
[2:08:08] you know we can be general about this i
[2:08:10] stand for jesus so do they
[2:08:13] there's two billion
[2:08:15] in christendom that stand for jesus
[2:08:18] but is that the real jesus
[2:08:20] is that the is that jesus in his program
[2:08:23] or is that just the idea and the
[2:08:25] imagination of what they think jesus is
[2:08:27] i don't know i mean everyone has their
[2:08:29] own conviction everyone has their own
[2:08:30] but what about you
[2:08:32] do you just stand for jesus or do you
[2:08:34] know exactly what you're actually
[2:08:36] standing for
[2:08:37] because this is very important that you
[2:08:39] make a stand it has to be your stand you
[2:08:42] have to stand today amen
[2:08:46] hallelujah
[2:08:47] amen

[2:09:14] amen
[2:09:16] oh brother how is satan going to stand
[2:09:19] against that
[2:09:20] when you know
[2:09:22] what you stand for
[2:09:24] that you stand for the supernatural god
[2:09:26] reigning in your life when you stand for
[2:09:29] a message that's come to bring people to
[2:09:32] that
[2:09:33] this is what we stand for we're standing
[2:09:35] for god manifested in the flesh we're
[2:09:38] standing for a people that god uses to
[2:09:42] impart eternal life

[2:09:46] culture we're standing for a rapture
[2:09:48] we're standing for rapturing faith amen
[2:09:52] that is being ministered to us
[2:09:55] hallelujah we're standing for young
[2:09:57] people that are lining the front seats
[2:09:59] that are on fire for god that are going
[2:10:01] out there and tearing up the streets on
[2:10:03] fire for god that's what we stand for
[2:10:06] and we will not give up until we see it
[2:10:09] we will not give up until we see the
[2:10:11] fire
[2:10:12] of god
[2:10:13] amen burning in the hearts
[2:10:16] all the clouds you know the the smoke of
[2:10:18] the pit of hell
[2:10:20] completely cleared out the mind and you
[2:10:22] become an invincible army
[2:10:24] and the devil doesn't know what to do
[2:10:26] with you anymore amen
[2:10:32] what's how is he going to stand against
[2:10:34] that
[2:10:35] how is he going to stop that from
[2:10:37] growing how is he going to keep them
[2:10:39] signs from following it
[2:10:41] hallelujah
[2:10:43] where is the secret of your strength
[2:10:48] this power must be manifested in you
[2:10:51] john 7 37 it says in the last day
[2:10:56] great day of the feast
[2:10:58] jesus stood
[2:10:59] and cried
[2:11:01] i love that
[2:11:03] just like now in revelation chapter 10
[2:11:05] which we'll get to in a second and then
[2:11:07] we'll close
[2:11:09] the last day
[2:11:12] jesus stood
[2:11:14] and cried
[2:11:16] what happened when he cried
[2:11:18] seven thunders under their voices
[2:11:20] amen
[2:11:22] who knows that
[2:11:23] who's under the sound of that voice
[2:11:25] amen who hears that voice today
[2:11:28] amen where jesus has stood in the last
[2:11:31] days in that time of the great feast
[2:11:33] amen in the evening time when the when
[2:11:35] the wine has been given
[2:11:37] and jesus stands
[2:11:39] amen and cries
[2:11:42] and power comes forth
[2:11:44] to rapture a bride away
[2:11:46] the bridegroom call comes down through a
[2:11:48] message to take a bride and rapture her
[2:11:51] into heaven but in the process she
[2:11:53] begins to pull the devil out of his
[2:11:55] position
[2:11:56] because she is willing to make a stand
[2:12:00] she is willing to say this is what i
[2:12:02] believe she is willing to say i
[2:12:05] am standing today for this message i am
[2:12:08] unashamedly standing today that william
[2:12:11] branham is the seventh angel is malachi
[2:12:14] 4 is luke 17 30. amen is the very angel
[2:12:18] that took john through the book of
[2:12:20] revelation
[2:12:21] do you know that
[2:12:23] it says that the lord sent his angel
[2:12:26] to take me on show me these things
[2:12:29] so whose message showed you
[2:12:31] revelations 1 church ages revelation 4
[2:12:35] in the throne room revelation 5 the
[2:12:38] seals opening revelation 9 and 10 and
[2:12:41] all the way through
[2:12:42] things that ought to be
[2:12:45] the future home of the heavenly father
[2:12:46] of nazi bride who was that angel
[2:12:49] that led john
[2:12:50] and who was john
[2:12:52] hello

[2:12:55] hey john you're john
[2:12:56] [Laughter]
[2:13:00] amen amen are you with me
[2:13:03] are we together
[2:13:06] now look what he did when he stood and
[2:13:07] cried now this was jesus in his actual
[2:13:10] ministry but remember god does nothing
[2:13:13] by whenever he lives whatever he does
[2:13:16] has
[2:13:16] multiple prophetic values
[2:13:20] he says
[2:13:22] if any man thirst
[2:13:24] let him come unto me and drink
[2:13:26] he that believeth on me
[2:13:28] as the scripture has said out of his
[2:13:30] belly shall flow rivers of living water
[2:13:34] and i want you to know
[2:13:36] that those rivers of living water that
[2:13:38] flow from you
[2:13:40] when you stand for him
[2:13:42] and that's why i want to tell you it's
[2:13:43] important that you stand for him
[2:13:46] stand for him stand for those he sends
[2:13:48] stand for his message stand for what he
[2:13:51] believes stand for his values stand for
[2:13:53] the heart of god
[2:13:55] stand for the program of god say lord
[2:13:57] what's your program
[2:13:58] what's your will what's your burden
[2:14:02] you know do we ask that or do we just
[2:14:04] have our own burden
[2:14:05] you know do we just go about our own
[2:14:07] merry way we do our own thing we just
[2:14:09] live our own life and never even ask god
[2:14:13] lord what is your burden today
[2:14:15] what's your burden for my life
[2:14:17] lord i'm going to meet this person do
[2:14:19] you have a heart for that person do you
[2:14:20] want to say something
[2:14:22] become
[2:14:23] conversable with god
[2:14:27] don't just go off in some religious form
[2:14:30] we've got to break the mold
[2:14:32] break the mould of your own religiosity
[2:14:35] and habits
[2:14:36] break your religion
[2:14:40] just just go from it being a habit
[2:14:45] and i'm not saying that we're just all
[2:14:46] religious people but
[2:14:48] we and i myself you begin to form habits
[2:14:51] and you do it by habit
[2:14:53] you do it because it's the right thing
[2:14:54] and it is the right thing and it's fine
[2:14:56] but it's more than that
[2:14:58] if you come to a place where you say
[2:15:00] lord
[2:15:01] what's your burden
[2:15:02] for the song service what's your burden
[2:15:05] and you become tuned into that then when
[2:15:08] you do anything
[2:15:10] it changes it all
[2:15:12] it changes the very tense of your
[2:15:14] meeting
[2:15:15] when you go to your friends and maybe
[2:15:17] you've got friends that you love and you
[2:15:18] and they're not serving the lord
[2:15:20] and and before you go you say lord
[2:15:22] what's your burden
[2:15:24] what do you want out of this
[2:15:26] help me lord to achieve what you want
[2:15:28] because i can't
[2:15:29] as i said before we are facing now a
[2:15:32] devil that's angry and he knows if he
[2:15:35] can keep our unsaved loved ones out and
[2:15:37] our children out in discouragement the
[2:15:39] longer he keeps them there the longer
[2:15:41] we're staying
[2:15:42] so i i i just encourage you right now
[2:15:45] make your stand
[2:15:48] don't don't don't just treat this as
[2:15:50] like oh you know predestination
[2:15:53] it's gonna happen
[2:15:56] it's such an imbalanced way of thinking
[2:15:58] you know
[2:15:59] and it's a very dangerous place to get
[2:16:00] to
[2:16:01] extreme calvinism don't ever get there
[2:16:04] and i know that it's hard to care
[2:16:07] i know oh my i care a lot and the more
[2:16:10] you care the harder it is
[2:16:12] for people for young people for the
[2:16:13] youth for everyone for everything when
[2:16:15] you care
[2:16:17] it hurts because you watch and you see
[2:16:19] and you're like man you're just so happy
[2:16:21] when they're happy but when they're sad
[2:16:22] you're sad and when they're going
[2:16:23] through you're going through too
[2:16:25] and so the easy road is to just pull
[2:16:27] back and go the lord will deal with it
[2:16:30] and he will and you sometimes have to
[2:16:32] you know if you're directed on the lord
[2:16:34] to take your hands away completely but
[2:16:35] you still care
[2:16:37] i still care i mean
[2:16:39] we all care right
[2:16:40] you have a caring but you can be hurt
[2:16:42] and a hurt can break that that that cha
[2:16:45] that bind bond it's a healthy bond of
[2:16:47] caring as a parent as a friend as a
[2:16:49] brother or sister and so we have to be
[2:16:52] very very diligent in the in the way
[2:16:55] that we think about these things amen
[2:16:57] and the way that we approach these
[2:16:59] things
[2:17:00] hallelujah
[2:17:02] so that we can see
[2:17:04] our young people
[2:17:05] breakthrough
[2:17:07] because we know
[2:17:08] and the devil knows
[2:17:10] that he that's his last
[2:17:12] you could say that's his last port of
[2:17:14] of of of of delay
[2:17:17] the last moment of delay as the is as
[2:17:20] the as those last ones to come in right
[2:17:22] i mean i'm preaching very elementary
[2:17:24] things here but this is very key to this
[2:17:27] thought of why it's important that you
[2:17:29] make an absolute stand
[2:17:31] and why when you stand you care
[2:17:34] and when you make a stand you're
[2:17:35] standing for caring for those that
[2:17:36] aren't that are struggling
[2:17:38] and when someone's going through a hard
[2:17:40] time and maybe everything's broken and
[2:17:42] broken around them and we all go through
[2:17:44] it
[2:17:45] we don't just go oh yeah that's because
[2:17:47] of that that's because of that and you
[2:17:48] just waffle off a whole bunch of reasons
[2:17:50] why they're going through it and they
[2:17:51] did this and they made that mistake and
[2:17:52] oh that's why they're going through
[2:17:54] judgment that's the wrong way to be you
[2:17:56] know
[2:17:56] you don't want to look like look at like
[2:17:58] that because you see that one that's
[2:18:00] going through that as part of your
[2:18:02] family part of your your redemption you
[2:18:05] could say because our the redemption of
[2:18:07] our body is connected to the body of
[2:18:09] christ
[2:18:10] the redemption of our body is connected
[2:18:13] to our teenagers that struggle because
[2:18:15] they need to they need to make a stand
[2:18:17] of their true identity and and let god
[2:18:20] take over right but there's this world
[2:18:22] of oh my goodness do you know that
[2:18:24] there's the teenagers of today face the
[2:18:26] worst
[2:18:28] influx of of of um
[2:18:31] of of stimulation
[2:18:34] like no other age and and me too
[2:18:37] we do right
[2:18:38] mate everywhere everywhere you look
[2:18:41] you've got these screens you've got
[2:18:43] just opinions no other age has ever been
[2:18:46] like this
[2:18:47] and that's where i got to when i was
[2:18:49] praying and i was like lord
[2:18:51] you know
[2:18:52] and caring
[2:18:53] for the for the
[2:18:55] for the condition of our young people
[2:18:57] and for the teenagers and i thought man
[2:19:00] look at the pull
[2:19:02] of the world and i thought the only way
[2:19:05] the only way to break them out of that
[2:19:09] pull and that tantalization and how like
[2:19:12] because it's just instant gratification
[2:19:13] and and all that
[2:19:15] the only way is supernatural services
[2:19:18] supernatural events taking place
[2:19:21] supernatural manifestation of the holy
[2:19:24] ghost
[2:19:25] in our church right now
[2:19:28] where is your expectation
[2:19:30] you know like uh are you sitting here
[2:19:32] today
[2:19:33] waiting for lunch
[2:19:35] are you sitting here
[2:19:37] drawing
[2:19:38] are you pulling
[2:19:40] is your faith making the service because
[2:19:43] i can feel there's a mix there's a mix
[2:19:46] of pulling and there's there's
[2:19:48] there's stationary there's no resistance
[2:19:50] which is good
[2:19:51] but you can feel it when there's
[2:19:52] resistance there's no resistance but you
[2:19:54] know there's you can feel a pull and
[2:19:57] when there's a pull it just flows out
[2:20:00] but when there's when it's not so much
[2:20:02] of a pull then you go back to the notes
[2:20:04] and you begin to you know
[2:20:06] so you actually
[2:20:07] you are the service you know i mean he's
[2:20:10] the service that's all about him but you
[2:20:12] make it
[2:20:14] without us pulling and
[2:20:16] faith you know expectation
[2:20:18] it's not just an empty idea oh it's
[2:20:21] going to happen it's going to be such a
[2:20:22] good service or good and you sit down
[2:20:25] no it's faith
[2:20:26] expectation is a belief
[2:20:28] it's actually a substance that you
[2:20:31] believe i'm going to meet god today
[2:20:34] and when you believe
[2:20:36] you will meet him and that minister will
[2:20:38] go off onto all sorts of different
[2:20:40] things the service that they have
[2:20:42] prepared will become multi-dimensional
[2:20:44] the thought will be the same because the
[2:20:46] spirit will keep it all in tune but
[2:20:47] it'll be it'll just go it'll just go
[2:20:50] right out you know and it'll begin to
[2:20:52] call supernaturally and that's when the
[2:20:55] breakthrough
[2:20:57] takes place and like i said before for
[2:20:59] that to happen we need to make a firm
[2:21:01] stand
[2:21:02] a real stand
[2:21:04] for truth and win and and a stand
[2:21:07] against mind battles in the service
[2:21:09] because that's a huge thing and i have
[2:21:11] them too we all have mind battles in the
[2:21:13] surface because the devil knows that if
[2:21:15] he can get the people discouraged
[2:21:17] then it's fear
[2:21:19] it's anxiety can you imagine right if
[2:21:22] you could see the thoughts and the mind
[2:21:24] battles above everybody if they were all
[2:21:26] like just into the service and rejoicing
[2:21:28] in faith and pulling man this place will
[2:21:31] just be erupting right
[2:21:32] but then the devil's like i don't want
[2:21:34] that to happen i'm just going to hammer
[2:21:35] these people because he knows he's being
[2:21:38] pulled out of heaven you're pulling him
[2:21:40] down you're pulling him out of his
[2:21:42] position
[2:21:43] this is his last straw of fight and as
[2:21:46] our teenagers and this is another thing
[2:21:48] sorry to pick on the teenagers but i
[2:21:49] love you
[2:21:50] i love you but you guys are going
[2:21:52] through your change and when you go
[2:21:54] through change and adults go through
[2:21:55] their change too again you have another
[2:21:57] change later on and it's two plots in a
[2:21:59] human life where there is a lot of
[2:22:01] identity being questioned in your own
[2:22:03] life and everything it's very it's it's
[2:22:06] it's a time of change
[2:22:08] but as the t as we get an influx of
[2:22:10] teenage minds coming in the mind battles
[2:22:13] are there on a whole new level
[2:22:15] amen
[2:22:16] a whole new level because you've got all
[2:22:17] these young adults now and they're
[2:22:20] thinking all the stuff and they're like
[2:22:21] going through these things and they're
[2:22:23] real hungry
[2:22:25] they're starving you know especially the
[2:22:26] young boys mate they just want a good
[2:22:28] feed you know so you know when you start
[2:22:30] preaching past 12 o'clock matt you're in
[2:22:33] trouble you know
[2:22:34] they're like man i don't want brother
[2:22:36] andy to preach anymore
[2:22:38] oh mate i'm starving man
[2:22:41] sorry
[2:22:43] that doesn't happen to the girls though
[2:22:44] of course that's just the boys you know
[2:22:48] oh well it happens to me still sometimes
[2:22:50] you know we're all human
[2:22:52] um but where there's something else and
[2:22:55] i don't know who i was speaking to but i
[2:22:56] was speaking to someone the other day
[2:22:57] and i
[2:22:58] and i said you know yeah i get hungry in
[2:23:00] the service sometimes and i said you
[2:23:02] know the only thing to break that hunger
[2:23:04] is to really
[2:23:05] make an extra stand right there in the
[2:23:08] service to fully enter in
[2:23:10] and then what happens is you know
[2:23:12] because when you really enter in and i
[2:23:14] want to tell you children and i tell my
[2:23:15] children all the time you can listen
[2:23:19] if you really say lord speak to me
[2:23:22] and you might be hungry and you and you
[2:23:24] sometimes you get hungry 11 o'clock
[2:23:25] that's a real big problem you know
[2:23:27] you're like man i've got an hour or what
[2:23:30] to like sit here hungry i tell you i'll
[2:23:32] give you a little tip
[2:23:34] just say lord
[2:23:35] speak to me
[2:23:38] speak to me right there
[2:23:39] i'm gonna make my stand today
[2:23:42] because i don't wanna sit here starving
[2:23:44] i'm gonna because you see jesus
[2:23:46] when he was he went to the woman at the
[2:23:48] well and he even preached to the woman
[2:23:50] at the well and then the disciples came
[2:23:52] back
[2:23:53] and he had i mean you could
[2:23:56] you know when you have such a glorious
[2:23:57] time
[2:23:59] food is so far away you know just like i
[2:24:01] could never be hungry again in this
[2:24:03] presence you know
[2:24:04] that's probably how jesus was feeling
[2:24:06] because that was his daughter and she
[2:24:08] was like completely bound and now she's
[2:24:10] free and she's so happy she's just
[2:24:12] running telling everyone and i believe
[2:24:14] the lord was real happy about that and
[2:24:16] then here comes his disciples back
[2:24:18] having a good feed you know lord do you
[2:24:20] want some
[2:24:22] do you want some food lord he's like oh
[2:24:24] man there's no way i can eat right now
[2:24:25] you know i'm like i've got food to eat
[2:24:27] that you know not of
[2:24:29] one day you will know and she kind of
[2:24:31] tabernacle no
[2:24:32] they know what that food is
[2:24:34] and now the children when you're hungry
[2:24:36] now i'm sorry to like connect it to
[2:24:38] hunger but hey there it is we're all
[2:24:41] human
[2:24:43] call on the lord and eat the meat
[2:24:46] that we that this human body knows not
[2:24:48] of amen eat that meat because you see
[2:24:50] and it's for all of us for the service
[2:24:52] when you pull
[2:24:54] when you enter in that's why i say
[2:24:57] our those that aren't converted
[2:25:00] are absolutely depending on the lord and
[2:25:02] on those that are
[2:25:04] to enter in and to make the service
[2:25:07] supernatural
[2:25:08] by having an expectation by standing
[2:25:10] against the wiles and snares of the
[2:25:12] devil and making a stand for truth
[2:25:14] making a stand to you know when we go in
[2:25:17] there and we pray in the morning on
[2:25:18] sunday morning we're making a stand
[2:25:22] that this service will be god will take
[2:25:24] it
[2:25:25] and and lives will be changed and
[2:25:27] because
[2:25:28] this is coming right back to where we've
[2:25:30] got all
[2:25:32] the
[2:25:32] you know all the sin and all of the
[2:25:35] you know life is so
[2:25:37] tempting
[2:25:38] there's so much to go on and do and and
[2:25:41] your affections and what you love and
[2:25:43] enjoy becomes so full that god has no
[2:25:45] room
[2:25:47] and and and and if it and you you you
[2:25:50] come they see the young people they have
[2:25:52] to face this
[2:25:54] but if that young person comes into a
[2:25:56] service and all of a sudden everything
[2:25:58] they're thinking is being spoken by
[2:25:59] because you guys are pulling and
[2:26:01] everyone's pulling and there's an
[2:26:03] unconverted young person there and they
[2:26:05] need god they don't they probably don't
[2:26:07] think they need god
[2:26:08] and they probably don't even want to
[2:26:10] think like that because they're having
[2:26:11] their thing but there's a people pulling
[2:26:14] and there's a people that have got faith
[2:26:16] and they've made a stand and they're not
[2:26:17] going to let mind battles break the
[2:26:19] service anymore they're just gonna say
[2:26:20] no i stand for this i stand for a true
[2:26:23] servant i'm standing for the mind of
[2:26:24] christ i'm standing for the supernatural
[2:26:26] i'm standing for conversions of young
[2:26:29] people i'm standing for the refreshing
[2:26:32] and the revival of the holy ghost and
[2:26:34] everyone
[2:26:36] and you you start getting like that and
[2:26:37] start really standing for that and start
[2:26:39] fighting for it
[2:26:41] you watch there will be new births
[2:26:43] there will be an outpouring of the
[2:26:45] spirit and prophecies and supernatural
[2:26:48] gifts taking place again amen
[2:26:51] hallelujah and that person that thought
[2:26:54] that they were going to leave and go out
[2:26:55] and do something that they shouldn't do
[2:26:58] will be changed
[2:27:00] and they will come to meet the joy that
[2:27:03] they've been chasing all their life
[2:27:05] they'll come to meet the peace they've
[2:27:07] been wanting they'll come to meet the
[2:27:08] satisfaction
[2:27:10] that they tried alcohol drugs and all
[2:27:12] these women and everything to try and
[2:27:14] fill they meet the one that fills that
[2:27:17] sauce
[2:27:18] that gives them the joy unspeakable and
[2:27:20] full of glory
[2:27:23] oh my
[2:27:26] and my the burden is
[2:27:28] it
[2:27:30] that we make a stand
[2:27:33] so much that that happens
[2:27:35] because if they just sit in the service
[2:27:37] and and there's and it's just it just pl
[2:27:40] it sails on we're coasting right just
[2:27:42] coasting it's a good time and we get a
[2:27:43] good sermon and we have some good songs
[2:27:46] and there's a little bit of a move of
[2:27:48] god and it's nice and we leave and we've
[2:27:50] hit we feel good right
[2:27:52] but it can be more
[2:27:53] it can be so much more
[2:27:56] so much more we can have camp
[2:27:59] every service
[2:28:01] god's still the same god at camp as he
[2:28:03] is here
[2:28:04] what's the difference the expectation
[2:28:07] so just put off the camp expectation put
[2:28:10] up put it on now
[2:28:12] we're going to have camp amen just pull
[2:28:14] on the pull on the lord you know
[2:28:16] just really enter into make a stand in
[2:28:19] the morning sunday morning when the
[2:28:20] devil's fighting and howling whatever
[2:28:22] you go through
[2:28:23] make a stand
[2:28:24] put it all aside and and you want to
[2:28:27] sleep until 8 30 9 o'clock or whatever
[2:28:29] and just quickly whip into church just
[2:28:31] make a stand and say no sunday morning
[2:28:34] i'm getting up early i'm going to pray
[2:28:36] i'm going to break through i'm going to
[2:28:37] tear down some devils
[2:28:39] oh you're going to begin to speak and
[2:28:41] i'm going to be good to say you know
[2:28:42] what i'm going to make a stand for
[2:28:43] church i'm going to make a stand for the
[2:28:45] servers because there's young people and
[2:28:47] old people maybe i don't know but you
[2:28:50] know
[2:28:50] that need the holy ghost
[2:28:53] but they've been pulled and the
[2:28:54] affections and what you like and all in
[2:28:56] your mind it's full up
[2:28:58] full up with love books and
[2:29:01] social medias and whatever it may be
[2:29:03] that you love
[2:29:04] or you like we don't say we love those
[2:29:06] things but we certainly like them and
[2:29:08] sometimes that like but does become a
[2:29:10] bit of an affectionate love and it feels
[2:29:12] that but god wants that
[2:29:14] and you watch the joy and the dopamine
[2:29:16] that comes into your brain from most
[2:29:18] things will be five times better with
[2:29:20] god five ten million times better
[2:29:24] because you're connected to the source
[2:29:26] of your dopamine he created that
[2:29:30] i'm talking physical now physical
[2:29:31] feelings there's more than that it's
[2:29:33] greater soul feelings physics spiritual
[2:29:34] whatever but the physical side even
[2:29:38] who created those things
[2:29:40] who created your brain
[2:29:42] who created your the dopamine and the
[2:29:44] serotonin and all those happy chemicals
[2:29:46] who did it who made it who made the
[2:29:48] glands that they come out of in your
[2:29:50] mind when you react to situations
[2:29:53] who created the chemicals in your blood
[2:29:55] and in your body you know when you feel
[2:29:57] irritated and down depressed all those
[2:29:59] things anxious do you know that's just
[2:30:01] chemicals in your blood
[2:30:03] making you feel that way and you know
[2:30:05] that's a result that your spirit needing
[2:30:07] help
[2:30:08] your spirit has got problems and
[2:30:10] blockages and influences
[2:30:13] and all it takes is for you to make a
[2:30:15] stand
[2:30:16] a real stand and even today when we
[2:30:18] stand soon excuse the pun but we're
[2:30:21] going to make a real stand today we're
[2:30:23] going to refresh our stand amen who's
[2:30:25] ready
[2:30:26] hallelujah
[2:30:31] sorry to go a bit longer i'll be five
[2:30:33] minutes can i have five minutes
[2:30:35] okay
[2:30:40] lord help me to just
[2:30:42] share this because this is such a kind
[2:30:44] loving thing
[2:30:47] and i really
[2:30:48] just pray that the lord will make this
[2:30:50] personal he says in revelation 5 6 and 7
[2:30:53] he says and i beheld and lo in the midst
[2:30:56] of the throne and of the four beasts and
[2:30:58] in the midst of the elders stood
[2:31:01] a lamb
[2:31:03] hallelujah
[2:31:06] this is the standing that i've been
[2:31:07] talking about the whole time
[2:31:09] in this generation because this happened
[2:31:11] in 1963.
[2:31:15] it was 2 000 years of his blood
[2:31:18] and it was in in he and and the
[2:31:21] sacrifice of christ on the mercy seat as
[2:31:24] the mercy seat
[2:31:25] to intercede for the sins of the church
[2:31:28] so the church could come
[2:31:30] out of sin and be saved and come into
[2:31:33] the presence of god through redemption
[2:31:35] by blood
[2:31:36] but the mercy seat himself would come
[2:31:39] and move
[2:31:41] it's still the same mercy it's still the
[2:31:43] same god but the lamb the one that paid
[2:31:46] for our sin would stand
[2:31:48] and he would begin to change the
[2:31:50] dispensation and it would happen over
[2:31:53] a period of time but in vision we see it
[2:31:56] in one instant event but the actual
[2:31:58] event takes place over many years and is
[2:32:00] still taking place because it has to
[2:32:02] take place not just in one person but in
[2:32:05] a mini-membered body all over the world
[2:32:08] for the last 30 50 60 years it's been
[2:32:10] taking place
[2:32:12] because it has to happen to you
[2:32:15] he did this in eternity but the same
[2:32:17] lamb has to come to you
[2:32:19] you've got to meet mercy right who
[2:32:21] believes that you've got to meet him
[2:32:24] he's got to stand and you've got to meet
[2:32:26] the one that stands for you
[2:32:28] and behold
[2:32:29] and
[2:32:29] stood a lamb
[2:32:31] as it had been slain
[2:32:33] so here you have now a lamb the lamb of
[2:32:36] god our precious kinsmen redeemer jesus
[2:32:39] christ who was born
[2:32:41] in the
[2:32:42] in the flesh and he lived on the earth
[2:32:45] and he stood for you on the earth
[2:32:49] he stood for you
[2:32:50] and face the religiosity and all those
[2:32:53] powers of darkness he stood for you and
[2:32:55] faced rome and then in gethsemane he
[2:32:58] stood for you and faced the sin of the
[2:33:00] whole world war your shame bore your
[2:33:02] iniquities he he and and and stood
[2:33:05] against all all the lies
[2:33:07] and everything that would ever happen to
[2:33:09] the human race he stood for you on the
[2:33:12] earth then he carried that cross he was
[2:33:14] crucified and he stood for you on
[2:33:16] calvary
[2:33:17] amen then he was taken down into hell
[2:33:21] and he stood for you in hell
[2:33:24] and he stood for you and he took the
[2:33:25] keys off the devil for you
[2:33:27] in hell and now he stands with the keys
[2:33:29] of hell and death in his and his hand he
[2:33:31] stood for you
[2:33:33] in hell then he was raised up and he
[2:33:35] stood for now he stands for you here
[2:33:38] after two thousand years because his
[2:33:39] body was taken up and as a sacrifice was
[2:33:42] there for two thousand years but then
[2:33:44] right at the end he would come in a
[2:33:47] spirit form to come and get you but
[2:33:49] first as a man as a human he would have
[2:33:52] to
[2:33:54] the book of redemption everything that
[2:33:56] adam lost everything that was
[2:33:58] lost to adam and all of the creative
[2:34:00] power and the ownership of all of it was
[2:34:03] in the hands of the invisible god
[2:34:05] but a human being that's why god himself
[2:34:07] became a human and said
[2:34:09] i'm taking it back
[2:34:11] now a human has it all again
[2:34:14] and he stood there in heaven and he took
[2:34:16] it and he loosed the seals
[2:34:19] like i said before and he uttered and
[2:34:21] seven thunders uttered their voices and
[2:34:23] the power that was contained in the seal
[2:34:26] book was released and michael has come
[2:34:29] down into you
[2:34:31] with this
[2:34:33] to ensure that you come in a rapture
[2:34:38] are you with me
[2:34:41] this is great things like oh man i wish
[2:34:43] i could do it justice you know
[2:34:45] but yeah the lord can reveal it
[2:34:48] hallelujah
[2:34:51] stood a lamb as it had been slain having
[2:34:53] seven horns and seven eyes which are the
[2:34:55] seven spirits of god sent forth unto all
[2:34:58] the earth the messengers of the seven
[2:35:00] church ages had
[2:35:01] had a portion of god but then at the end
[2:35:04] the lamb himself
[2:35:05] would come himself right
[2:35:07] who who catches that is everyone clear
[2:35:12] says and he came and took the book out
[2:35:13] of the right hand of him that sat upon
[2:35:15] the throne so the inheritance of adam
[2:35:17] the inheritance of the human race when
[2:35:19] god said to adam it's all yours take it
[2:35:20] have dominion over it all it came back
[2:35:22] into the hands of the second adam
[2:35:24] jesus christ our kinsmen
[2:35:27] but do you think that he's just going to
[2:35:28] go yeah it's mine ha ha
[2:35:30] whoa i got it all now
[2:35:32] no you know what he did
[2:35:34] amen he doesn't want to keep it to
[2:35:36] himself
[2:35:37] he wants to say i've got a i've got a
[2:35:39] family i've got kinfolk
[2:35:42] i've got people that are part of me
[2:35:44] hey man she came out of me on the cross
[2:35:46] just like eve came out of adam and the
[2:35:48] and when he went to sleep and the woman
[2:35:50] came out well here comes a bride came
[2:35:52] out of me and i'm going to collect her
[2:35:53] over the next 2000 years one by one i'm
[2:35:56] going to bring them all out and i'm
[2:35:57] going to and then right at the end
[2:35:59] there's going to be a people that
[2:36:00] they're going to not even they're going
[2:36:02] to conquer even death itself but they're
[2:36:03] going to need something
[2:36:05] they're going to need something a little
[2:36:06] more than every other age ever had
[2:36:08] that's why in 1963 amen of dispensation
[2:36:12] began to change a new day begin to dawn
[2:36:16] alleluia the lord would he would he
[2:36:18] would say okay gabriel michael all of
[2:36:21] you i'm just gonna go down
[2:36:23] i'm gonna go down into the furnace like
[2:36:24] i went down into the furnace of the four
[2:36:26] the three amen in babylon i'm gonna go
[2:36:29] down into the furnace of satan's eden
[2:36:31] and i'm gonna rescue my bride
[2:36:34] hallelujah i stood for her in heaven and
[2:36:37] i'm gonna go stand for her on the earth
[2:36:39] again
[2:36:40] amen not in physical now the physical
[2:36:42] body is still up there atoning his mercy
[2:36:45] seat still open hey man who's gonna have
[2:36:47] the mercy seat still open but god in a
[2:36:50] spirit film
[2:36:52] michael an angelic form would come down
[2:36:55] and deliver a message
[2:36:56] to deliver his people
[2:37:02] i have to make this quick
[2:37:04] that's why i'm going back to my notes
[2:37:06] revelation 10 1 and 2.
[2:37:08] [Music]
[2:37:09] i just want you to know that he stood in
[2:37:11] the heaven he stood on the earth and the
[2:37:13] flesh he paid for it all then he let he
[2:37:16] he sat on his throne for 2000 years
[2:37:19] interceding but not the church never got
[2:37:22] raptured until one day the church has to
[2:37:24] be raptured they need something more
[2:37:26] who's glad that you're getting something
[2:37:27] more today
[2:37:29] are you glad you're getting something
[2:37:30] that's going to rapture your body
[2:37:33] you're getting something that's more
[2:37:35] than they've ever had
[2:37:36] hallelujah if he had given this if he
[2:37:39] had stood like there i read in
[2:37:40] revelation 5 took the book and opened it
[2:37:43] and and paul's day they would have gone
[2:37:44] on rapture because all of the
[2:37:46] inheritance was given back
[2:37:48] so what did he do
[2:37:50] he waited
[2:37:51] but he led his blood into seed and they
[2:37:53] came to a certain place then they died
[2:37:55] they thought they were getting raptured
[2:37:57] they actually thought that that was the
[2:37:59] rapture you know and paul had to say
[2:38:00] hold on a minute you guys are getting
[2:38:01] ahead of yourself here
[2:38:03] when the lord comes these things will be
[2:38:05] and we know that these things are right
[2:38:07] we just i'm not going to go into
[2:38:08] prophecies and everything right now but
[2:38:10] we know who knows
[2:38:12] that we're in the day and all the signs
[2:38:13] and everything is showing this is
[2:38:15] rapture day
[2:38:17] and so we know that our god stood for us
[2:38:19] on the earth he stood for us in
[2:38:21] gethsemane he stood for us on calvary he
[2:38:23] stood for us in hell he stood for us in
[2:38:25] abraham's bosom he stood for us back in
[2:38:27] his resurrected body then he said to
[2:38:29] mary don't touch me yet i'm going to go
[2:38:30] stand for you in heaven and he stood for
[2:38:32] her in heaven he stood for you in heaven
[2:38:35] amen amen oh he sat on the throne and
[2:38:37] then one day in 1963 he stood and he uh
[2:38:41] our kinsmen
[2:38:42] oh my
[2:38:44] our man
[2:38:45] that's my man that's my hero
[2:38:47] my hero hallelujah
[2:38:50] he stood for me
[2:38:51] i don't know he stood up and he said i'm
[2:38:53] gonna take that back and say father give
[2:38:55] me the book back
[2:38:57] i'm a human being actually same person
[2:39:00] but it's all in symbol form to show that
[2:39:02] the inheritance and it wasn't really a
[2:39:04] book but it was symbol right that's the
[2:39:06] inheritance the book symbolizes the deed
[2:39:09] the title deed the inheritance right the
[2:39:11] paperwork but it's spiritual paperwork
[2:39:14] amen and he said and that symboly but it
[2:39:16] came back and now a human has it again
[2:39:19] didn't keep it to himself he stood for
[2:39:21] you now he's about to
[2:39:23] hold and he's about to deliver it
[2:39:25] watch
[2:39:27] he's about to stand for you on the earth
[2:39:28] again
[2:39:30] and i saw now after revelation 9 who
[2:39:33] knows revelation 9
[2:39:34] when it says that a a star fell
[2:39:37] and and opened the pit of hell and came
[2:39:39] out on all the earth and blocked the sun
[2:39:41] and blocked the air and all these demon
[2:39:42] powers and world war one and world war
[2:39:44] ii began to come open
[2:39:46] and all the sciences and men left god
[2:39:48] and it all just turned dark
[2:39:51] but then
[2:39:52] remember that god did not leave his
[2:39:54] people in darkness because when that
[2:39:56] opened then this happened
[2:39:58] and i saw another mighty angel not
[2:40:01] falling coming down from god out of
[2:40:03] heaven with a cloud and a rainbow was
[2:40:05] about his head
[2:40:07] and his face was as it were the sun and
[2:40:09] his feet as pillars of fire now watch
[2:40:11] the position that he comes to and he had
[2:40:14] in his hand a little book open
[2:40:16] amen so who was it
[2:40:18] who took the book before
[2:40:21] kinsman
[2:40:23] hallelujah can you see it
[2:40:25] a kinsmen took the book lm who'd been
[2:40:28] slain
[2:40:30] oh glory
[2:40:32] now he's now he's coming down to the
[2:40:33] earth what's he coming down to do to
[2:40:35] stand for you
[2:40:37] he's come down to the earth to stand for
[2:40:39] you
[2:40:41] oh my
[2:40:42] that's why we can say in revelation 12
[2:40:43] rejoice you christians
[2:40:45] rejoice
[2:40:46] yes hallelujah
[2:40:49] because there's someone standing for you
[2:40:51] like i said he stood for you in all
[2:40:53] those places and now he's coming down
[2:40:54] here in 63 it says here and he had in
[2:40:58] his hand a little book open and he set
[2:41:00] his right foot upon the sea and his left
[2:41:02] foot upon the earth that looks like a
[2:41:04] bit of a standing position to me amen
[2:41:07] his right foot upon the left on the sea
[2:41:09] right on the earth what is that
[2:41:11] see is rome
[2:41:13] the first babylon religious babylon the
[2:41:16] earth is mystery babylon which is
[2:41:18] california
[2:41:20] california hollywood is mystery as the
[2:41:22] second babylon
[2:41:24] revelation 18 shows two babylons one
[2:41:26] babylon's the religious one the second
[2:41:28] one is the big millstone that gets cast
[2:41:29] into the sea
[2:41:31] which all the abominations and all the
[2:41:33] songs and all the people with the harps
[2:41:35] and all of that what is it
[2:41:36] oh my metallica
[2:41:39] slayer
[2:41:40] what are these great beatles oh they're
[2:41:41] from england but anyway
[2:41:43] you know all of these all of the music
[2:41:45] and all of the movies and everything
[2:41:46] that's come out of it to what destroy
[2:41:51] and a prophet stood in 1965 when he was
[2:41:53] preaching choosing of the bride and the
[2:41:55] lord began to take over and he said o
[2:41:57] capernaum capernaum
[2:41:59] how you were cast into the sea
[2:42:02] so shall it be for los angeles you
[2:42:04] should the the this whole land will be
[2:42:07] the judgment of god is belching beneath
[2:42:09] you and you shall be cast into the sea
[2:42:11] and and the sea will come all the way up
[2:42:14] to the salton sea there is and he
[2:42:16] explained in prophecy all the stuff that
[2:42:17] was going on underneath california they
[2:42:19] didn't even know about
[2:42:21] one year later science discovered that
[2:42:24] all of california is covered in
[2:42:26] honeycomb and this like lead layer
[2:42:28] that's just it would perfectly slide
[2:42:30] right into the ocean
[2:42:32] millions and millions of people are
[2:42:34] going to die it's a prophecy
[2:42:37] and it's revelation 18 the millstone
[2:42:39] will be cast into the sea judgment
[2:42:41] because the devil sits in there he's got
[2:42:44] he's actually got his own palace loose
[2:42:47] luciferian worshipers
[2:42:49] real true witches and wizards the ones
[2:42:51] that know him and worship him and follow
[2:42:53] him
[2:42:54] have he's got a mansion in california
[2:42:56] hotel california the eagles sing about
[2:42:58] it has anyone heard no of hotel that is
[2:43:01] satan's throne he has a throne there it
[2:43:04] is literally the seat
[2:43:06] and the other seat is
[2:43:08] well roman catholic church
[2:43:11] the vatican two babylons who comes down
[2:43:14] to santa's feet upon the power of
[2:43:16] religion and the power of hollywood and
[2:43:18] california the two babylons where all
[2:43:20] the evil has spurned out from
[2:43:25] he's come to stand for you
[2:43:28] he's standing there for you
[2:43:30] that's still going on but he's doing it
[2:43:32] for you
[2:43:33] do you know how it
[2:43:34] happened this is really personal now
[2:43:38] that picture happened in symbol to show
[2:43:41] what would happen when you received the
[2:43:43] holy ghost
[2:43:44] because what does the lord do
[2:43:48] after the message is gone this is why i
[2:43:50] say we stand for this message because he
[2:43:52] takes that book right in revelation 10
[2:43:54] and he talks about all the thunder's
[2:43:55] coming out everything then he says and
[2:43:57] and he says and in the days of the voice
[2:43:59] of the seventh angel when he shall begin
[2:44:00] to sound all these mysteries shall be
[2:44:02] finished
[2:44:03] so he's saying that here comes this one
[2:44:05] that's to stand for us he takes this and
[2:44:07] he begins to give it to a prophet in
[2:44:09] this generation and the prophet preaches
[2:44:12] this message he preaches it and then
[2:44:14] that gets caught up on tapes and now we
[2:44:16] have these tapes that we can listen to
[2:44:18] and receive it but not just that
[2:44:21] but the true
[2:44:23] true approach to god has been restored
[2:44:26] elijah restored the altar didn't he
[2:44:29] and how to approach god the altar is the
[2:44:31] approach of god elijah came his ministry
[2:44:33] was to restore the altar and to
[2:44:35] obviously bring judgment on ahab and
[2:44:37] jezebel
[2:44:39] and and and so here you have elijah
[2:44:41] coming in this day with a ministry to
[2:44:44] restore the approach to god to restore
[2:44:46] true baptism in the name of jesus christ
[2:44:49] to restore the revelation of the godhead
[2:44:51] to restore what is actually right and
[2:44:53] wrong
[2:44:54] so that you can approach the living god
[2:44:57] and get the real baptism of the holy
[2:44:58] ghost amen and anyone that maybe hasn't
[2:45:02] heard this message that really knows how
[2:45:04] to approach god will get the baptism of
[2:45:06] the holy ghost then they'll find this
[2:45:07] message
[2:45:08] because the holy ghost will lead them to
[2:45:09] the message
[2:45:10] he ain't going to lead them away
[2:45:13] hallelujah
[2:45:15] not the real baptism of the holy ghost
[2:45:18] the real baptism of the holy ghost is
[2:45:20] the lord coming to stand for you
[2:45:22] on the earth
[2:45:23] but not on this earth
[2:45:25] in this earth
[2:45:26] what does he do he comes down to stand
[2:45:29] on your spirit and on your flesh so that
[2:45:31] you can actually overcome
[2:45:33] there's no way else
[2:45:34] you can't overcome without that
[2:45:37] if you try you're gonna fail you're
[2:45:39] gonna fall you're gonna go to something
[2:45:40] else to find your comfort
[2:45:42] if you're finding comfort in other
[2:45:43] things make a stand today today is your
[2:45:46] day to make a stand and here is my final
[2:45:49] quote that i want to read can the
[2:45:50] musicians please come and maybe um

[2:46:37] southwest united states his name was
[2:46:39] daniel curry
[2:46:41] a wonderful man
[2:46:42] a godly man a sainted man
[2:46:45] a real christian a man that everybody
[2:46:48] thought so much of such a wonderful
[2:46:50] person and the story goes
