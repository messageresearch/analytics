James back to you my brother over to you brother James fishy it's wonderful the output a fellowship again over Scott and I'm I've got a paratha maybe just more of a teaching sort of strong message tonight so I'm gonna try and take over the screen share and do a PowerPoint but it will probably stop the main image off all your faces or my face from coming up but I've played around with that are better that's sort of the best we can manage under the circumstances so we'll try that and you can you can unmute your microphones as well David so Oh amen see if I can take over this so does everybody have a slideshow on their screen let's change this little box so it's out of my Road all right so we're going to read from speaking Corinthians 11 chapter 18 verse 24 and scenes that suffer on the screen I'll stand up reading it up I've got quite a few scriptures in quite a field scientist carry on tonight of the Jews five times received by forty stripes save one throats I was beaten with rods once I was stoned thrice I suffered shipwreck a night in a day I have been in the deep and earnings often and perils of water and perils of robbers and perils by my own countrymen Imperials by the heathen and errol's in the city and perils in the wilderness and perils in the sea and a Errol's among false brethren and weariness and painfulness in watchings often in hunger and thirst and fastings often in cold and nakedness besides those things that are without that which cometh upon me daily the care of all the church it's just let's just commit these words to the Lord give any father we thank you Lord that we can just take this little word study tonight Lord and just ask you Lord to speak to us what you would want us to have for this time board that we could grow in you Lord Jesus as father a desire is to just grow closer to you in this mind father I just pray Lord you know take your words and then knowing my lips father just to stay with your word I ask in Jesus Christ's name Amen so my thought tonight but the tight I've titled this message do not attempt this trail if you have commitment issues maybe take us a little while before we get through this that that might make sense that looking here at what Paul had to go through he he went through great amount of suffering to bring forth a message for his age and it required a great sacrifice upon his life but through all these things that he suffered he never lost his vision he never lost his driver as burdened to deliver the message to the age and we've got to make sure we don't lose our drive as well we know all this plague of its covered 19 came about one of my first thoughts I had and I just asked brother Isaac if I was okay to just say something about this but I I thought you know it seems like the ins coming up so quick but I thought you know brother Isaac had this vision to make this movie that brother branham's life and he's so committed to it and I I really respect that and I believe that the vision that he's followings of God I thought in time I said to go on a bit longer but I thought now if he wasn't totally committed to that vision he could lose faith and say oh looks like times run out you know maybe I was wrong but this is not a time when we should be questioning the problem we should be questioning late I believe we're in a time where we need to take a check out how committed we are to this message be completely sold out you know Esau sold his birthright for a mess of pottage and people sell out the same today for a mess of this world and its riches taking Lessing as well as well nothing they can compare to what Christ offered us and this word committed that means to be pledged or bound to a certain cause or a certain policy dedicated when you accepted Christ as your Savior you accepted the wedding ring and you made a marriage commitment just before brother Brandon left the scene at the end of 65 he laid out a lot of important things to go out after your message and I believe here this is me of me but I believe he knew he was going this way he had a pretty good last month and God felt it was important for him to preach this marriage soo ceremony last month so others ministry write down and read through the quote well I quote that I pulled out of it and I just want us to spiritualize it and glean something out of it so he says here in 65 wedding ceremony and we'll charge you both as you saw he's taking her wedding making places and we charge you both as you will surely answer the day of judgment secrets of all hearts shall be disclosed that if either if you know any impediment why you should not be lawfully joined together on this holy merit mony do you now confess it for bearded short unto you there any person that could have joined otherwise then God's Word does allow the marriage is not lawful but believing that you have Julie considered the solemn obligation that you're about to assume that you have prepared to enter upon the same reverently discreetly wisely and in the fear of God I shall purpose to you this marriage covenant you will declare the same as you join your right hands the groom and the bride row in the right hands together will you take this woman to be your lawfully wedded wife I've just added this here in the red I believe this I can say that this is Christ speaking to the bride as marriage vows will you take this woman to be your lawfully wedded wife to live together in this holy state of matrimony do you promise to love honor and cherish and sickness and health and riches and poverty and will forsake all others and cleave to thee and cleave the only unto her as long as you both love the groom answer as I will not take this man to be your lawfully wedded husband to live in this holy matrimony do you promise to love honor cherish in sickness and health and riches and poverty and will forsake all others and cleave thee only unto him as long as you both live the bride answers I will obey I will require a token of you that is Covenant betwixt you there that's been made will always be kept two rings a place on the minister's Bible then offered to the groom for the bride then to the bride for the groom now will you join your right hands together upon the of God so now there has to be a token to seal this marriage but so often we make it each to Christ but we don't follow through with our bowels so when you come and say well I've committed my life to God but there has to be something outwardly that shows that you've made that commitment and it's tradition through many religions that after the couple were joined together in this and this wedding ceremony that the first thing they do is they go to the wedding chamber to consummate the marriage and in doing this the bride proves that she was a virgin to her husband and displays the blood on the beating she did it that's the token that the marriage has been sealed now the token on display is the proof the marriage has taken place this has to happen before the bride and groom go away on the honeymoon and now the bride is pregnant with the life of her husband so if your marriage has been consummated and the blood is on display you have the life of God on display to this world so I'm go to Deuteronomy 22 and just bring this up first thirteen If any man take a wife and go and unto her and hate her and give occasion of speech against her and bring up an evil name upon her and say I took this woman and when I came to her I found her not a maid then shall the father of the damsel and her mother take and bring forth the tokens of the damsels virginity and to the elders of the city and the gate and the damsels father shall say unto the elders I gave my daughter to this man to wife and he hated it and lo he giveth occassional speech against her saying I found not their daughter a maid and yet these are the tokens of my daughter's virginity and they shall spread the cloth before the elders of the city and the elders of that City shall take the men and chastise them and they show Amerson at hundred shekels of silver and gift them unto the father of the damsel because he has wrought an evil name upon a virgin of Israel and she shall be his wife and he may not put her away all those days so your token as powerful there's nothing that can separate you once your marriage to Christ as being consummated so don't listen to the devil if he tells you God don't love you your Union is bound upon the laws of God and they do not change and they cannot be broken when brother Brennan thought he was losing all he ever loved his wife had TB and was dying well had just died and his daughter had meningitis and was laying there about to die his dying baby in his arms he said the devil came alongside him and said God don't love you he hates you like he's taking your wife taking her baby and the devil was trying to make him doubt that God ever loved them but brother Branham said boo devil I'll say as job said though you slay me yet will I love you Lord Jesus no he said with great loss God never lived them but the devil was so quick to step in and make you doubt your token in times of calamity but there's nothing that can take that off you once that marriage is consummated he may not put you away all his days but don't be a foolish virgin because there will be a people that call themselves bride they claim to have the token but they failed the virginity test so scripture carries on and reader honor me but if this thing be true and the token of the virginity be found not for the damsel then they shall bring out the damsel to the floor of her father's house and the men of the city shall stone him with stones that she died because she hath wrought folly in Israel to play the in her father's house so shalt thou put evil away for the monkey so God's not playing he's not playing this people that are going in a rapture and there's people that are going to die in a tribulation and the plagues that are going to come are going to make the scope of xix look like a runny nose is far greater things than this coming this is just a woman I feel that this is time to do a little inspection now have a bit of a check make sure that you've got the blood applied in your life stranger to you if you want the death angel to pass over you this blood needs be on display on the door post and lintels and now I'm not talking about the house you love them you know there are there are believers that can't stay confined in the house they have to go to work so I'm not talking about the blood on the doorpost of the house but I'm talking about the blood on display upon your Tabernacle your body your earthly dwelling being man that's right there's a work to be done in this time and it's a rework of the Holy Spirit there's a reprocessing and if we're to be the final voice of the final generation then the Holy Spirit will move again through the bride like he did through the Prophet the same month of God moving again through the life that's been conceived than the bride and then so here in choosing of the bride pining 65 notice just a minute a minute a nun and a Catholic Church that woman to become a nun and takes the last veil she has absolutely sold out to that church she is soul body and spirit property of that church she has no mind of her own she can't have when she takes that last veil no mind of her own no will of her own see out here Satan makes them has bogus like the truth the true Church of Christ the bride is so sold out to him and as promised we're till the very mind that's in crisis in you amen what a difference over and we flattened a that the modern church the modern world Church the modern world Church and also the spiritual church at both pregnat to give birth to sons that's right one of them a denominational birth is going together for one day these things at the World Council of Churches which will produced to the world the Antichrist through a denomination that's exactly the truth I may not love to see it I believe I will but you young people remember that you heard a minister say that that'll finally wind out and that is the mark of the beast when she forms their World Council of Churches and she'll give birth to his son Antichrist yeah the other is pregnant by the word of God and will bring forth the body of the finished body of the Lord of Jesus Christ which is that right here minute the body of Christ isn't finished yet how many knows that a man and woman is one in Christ as one body the word the bride will have to be the rest of that body and the two together makes the body again one body again like Adam that was at the beginning man man has wife at one now she the true bride so sold out to him that she used no mind of her life of her own as mind of course as has well and has well as his word so now we have to put this into action and so we know the scripture but we'll read over it again in Revelation 10 verse 8 and the voice which I heard from heaven spake unto me again and said go and take the little book which is open in the hand of the angel which standeth upon the sea and upon the earth and I went unto the angel and said unto him give me the little book man and he said unto me take it and eat it up and it shall make thy belly better that it shall be and thy mouth sweet as hanging Angels hand and ate it up and it was in my mouth sweet as honey and as soon as I had eaten that my belly was better and he said unto me thou must prophesy again will for many peoples and nations and tongues and camps yeah this is the commission to the bride not the profit for the age not for a return ministry but for those - he who has an ear I hear what the spirit saith to the church Jhansi give me the book we didn't sit around and wait for something to happen he acted a sway the Amanda or here in the prophets last month the spirit wants us to catch something a lot of these quotes I'm going to a right at the end of 65 on the winds of a snow white dove hmm and I don't want you to focus on on the song as much but just the context of what he's saying because this is what's what I've really been looking at lately on the wings of a snow white dove God seems down his pure sweet love a sign from above on the wings of a dove why me and old men suffered all my life why did he heal me now see I believe at the stage he knew he was going to be leaving the scene why did he heal me now I believe I'll ride this trail again I got to bring a message and I say to my father tonight there's jr. seen in a dream the other night of the winds of the stuff and I just say here the Spirit coming down on the people moving in the windows here Lord your servant reporting for service Amen I'm ready on the winds of the snow white dove God sends me his pure sweet love a sign from above on the wings of a dove let's believe now that he's moving upon the audience on the wings of US Office know what we're waiting Lord God scenes down his pure sweet love a sign from above on the wings of a dove I just want to go over there tasty where did I go I believe I'll ride this trail again I've got to bring a message and I say to my father tonight as junior seen in a dream the other night on the wings of the staff moving in the windows here Lord your servants reporting for service amen I'm ready on the winds of a snow-white death it was ready to go and and ride this trail again and I believe that this is the angel speaking through the prophet reporting for service I'm ready to ride this trail again it's a spirit moving through the Prophet because this message did have to be prophesied again but it's not coming through a return ministry at brother Brennan it's coming through the bride a man here in 1961 Mary's belief we are looking for a heavenly visitor in this day it's a promise of God put on your deep spiritual thinking quit Church and remember we are now looking for a visitor and there are many claiming it but the only way that we'll know this heavenly visitor because he'll be a record off the word she knew that the angel was from God when she seen his action look to them and must have it must be an angel he said I am Gabriel standing at the right hand of God now when God gets ready to do something he sends a messenger always always has always will Gabriel announced the first coming of Christ Gabriel will announce the second coming of Christ that's right something major is fixing to heaven and I just want to talk about this a little better and if it's a puppy just spit it out of it so it's talking here about Gabriel and Archangel and really Gabriel's an attribute of God being expressed he's seen forth with a message of declaration and I want to say like this just before Abraham and Sarah had the body change they had one last sign God manifesting and flesh standing before them amen thoughts of their heart and many times brother Brennan picked us up and pointed it at his ministry he was standing on the platform every night revealing the thoughts of the heart a last sign before the body change then who was brother Branham was he a man or was it God well because we know brother Brennan was just a man we know where he's at we know a dove descended upon his cabin at his birth spirit coming down to you know who his parents was yet he said this is the last sign God manifested on flesh before you revealing your throat revealing your thoughts yeah and brother Brennan was out hunting with Dawson Riley and brother Dawson septum rather Branum some people say that you were Jesus Christ and brother Brennan responded and said well that's not far from the truth because it's God displaying himself through a veil it's just brother Brennan got the spirit through him as displaying God the same way he did with brother Brennan the same way he did through now kisser dick through Michael through Gabriel it was written that he himself shall descend with a shout voice and a Trump he will present this church to himself that's all God manifesting himself and the bride and the last day is God manifesting himself to the world but the Prophet had to have the spirit of Elijah to have boldness to step out and call son son and to call out Jesus and a head you know if only JFK knew that he was a head in the Bible he might have drive around in a bulletproof car because it was already prophesied what was going to happen to him but yet brother Branham had the Holy Spirit as well that brought grace and mercy then what about the angel of the Lord that stood on the platform who was he see God is omnipotent he can speak through the mouth of a donkey he's omnipresent he's not limited the only one office at a time yes so when an announcement comes forth Gabriel steeps forth brother Brennan was preaching and Daniel seventy weeks he said Gabriel blows the foreigner' trumpet as the bride's being raptured and the gospels going back to the Jews well Abrial announced price to the jurors at his first coming christ was rejected and he turned to the Gentiles then at the second coming Gabriel again declares this message back to the Jews for the completion of the second camp so God coming back on the wings of a snow white dove to ride this trail again to continue this message through the bride but Jesus on display again before this council of churches that is forming now before our eyes when you come to your maturity and speak this word of God as it's been revealed you become an earthly an earthly angel messenger so as this thing before and brother Brennan was preaching and he was someone had asked him a question about the angel of the Lord and he said he was saying I can only assume that he was pointing to ministers that were around him you are saying let me show you here is an earthly messenger and here's an earthly messenger here's an earthly messenger because when a man picks up the Word of God and its fullness and speaks the word for the age and it's truth that is a messenger to the age and if we must finish the work that Jesus did not complete in his earthly ministry which is to preach to the total loss and a handless message back to his own people that were blinded for our sake so now on the pergamene church age those and the bride do only as well no one can make them do otherwise they have thus saith the Lord or they keep still even they know that it has to be God and them doing the works other than its own word he did not complete all his work guellen as earthly ministry so now he works in and through the bride she knows therefore it was not yet time for him to do certain things that he must not do now but now will he fulfill through the bride that work which he left for this specific time when when Ruth was redeemed by Boaz there was a marriage the marriage was consummated and she gave birth to a son and as the bride has today given birth to to the Lord Jesus Christ to manifest him then Ruth handed that baby back to Naomi that is reliable go to the next slide here a revelation of Jesus Christ now when this go now when as the gospel returning to the Jews when the day of the Gentiles is finished the gospel is ready to go back to the Jews oh if I could just tell you something that is about to happen right in this day this grappling that is about to happen will carry over to revelation 11 and pick up those two witnesses those two prophets Moses and Elijah turning the gospel back to the juries we're ready for it everything is in order as the Jews brought the message to the Gentiles even so the June we'll take it right back to the Jews and the rapture come I read and hear and gods only provide a place of worship and just remember from the West will come a white horse rider will ride this trail again that's right soon as we're ready I'll promise it's a promise you see so the gospel came from the east and as a mature that when as far west as it could go and then brother Branham had this burden in his heart his whole life growing up as a boy to go west he had to complete the revealing of all the mysteries that were written in the book as all the mysteries had to be finished in this day and he says now remember from the West will come this white horse rider same Holy Spirit that was on the prophet and full maturity coming back again from the West to take the gospel back to the Jews where it will be accepted how will this exactly happen I don't exactly know that I can say we're mighty close to that day I remember when brother Brandon was in Egypt and he was ready to go and take this message to the Jews yeah an angel stopped them and said the time of the Gentiles is not yet full in we know when he preached Souls imprison now that we would come into a time before the rapture at the time of Gentiles is over and this message would be preached to the total loss that was a part of the third pole and the angels stopped brother branham from going into Israel because the Jews are taught to believe the prophets when they show the sign of a prophet so if he'd have entered into their land with this gift on display the Jews would have accepted it but it wasn't it wasn't their time and there are message believers now in the Holy Land living there what's going to happen when they come to full maturity silver and gold have I none but what I have given to you arise they kept thy bed and walk that same sign is prophesized to come across upon the bride again and the squeeze by never before so how close are we to the culmination of all this brothers you're living in that day you're then major a public event and it's so easy to read the Bible and read about Noah and read about Moses and Elijah and so on but what about you because just read yourself in Revelation 10 8 to 11 that's you you made a major part in the fulfilling of this whole reading book that's right Nora well I want to take the snap man to NIC level and the spirit is too clear I'll write this trail again and my thought was do not attend this trail have you had commitment issues I believe we're going to have to step up our game step up our confidence and James 2 verse 20 but will but will they'll know oh they men that faith without works is dead that's Abraham our Father justified by works when he had offered Isaac his son upon older see thou how faith wrought has works and by works was faith made perfect now this perfect means complete that is to accomplish to consummate to consecrate to finish to fulfill to be made perfect and we're gonna practice this word perfect that later in another scripture in another meaning and goes on and the scripture was fulfilled which saith abraham believed God and it was imputed unto him for righteousness and he was called the friend of God he see then how that by works a man is justified and not by faith only likewise also was not Rahab the harlot justified by works when she had received the messengers and had sent them out another way but as the body without the Spirit is dead so faith without works is dead also so I say do not attempt this trail of you have commitment issues and this statement really come from my mountain biking yes because mountain biking takes a total commitment there's quite a few apps where you can read about the trail that you're about to go down and when you start going down harder trails you quite often read someone who'll come in and they'll say do not attempt this trail if you have commitment issues because you're gonna crash and you're gonna burn because suddenly you're going to find yourself in an unfamiliar situation and you become like a stone mallet because you know fear grows and you get you forget all of that training that you've had and what happens is you take your eyes off the trail and start to look at the obstacle and you end up looking your hand up appealing straight in the direction you're looking I can guarantee you and you're flying down that track and a tree sort of pops out of the side of the track level but if you keep looking at that tree you're gonna end up giving a real big hug and it's nice you've got to keep your eyes on Jesus because once we start going down this road once this over 19 disappears and the next play comes that's not going to be an easier play it's gonna be harder maybe this will bring on the real tightening of the squeeze where these council of churches won't let us have meetings akin maybe we'll never have a meeting again who knows things are going to start to get tough and you're gonna have to start walking on your own and then your staff you're gonna have to lead your family to keep your eyes on the direction you want to go once you're on this trail and there's no point in you even were walking this trail while riding this trail and if you've got commitment issues get committed to Christ first even had the same things while hunting and you find yourself in an uncomfortable place where sudden you've been looking at where you want to go and you get so far and you get bluffed that's quite often a term where you see you've tried to drop down into a valley and as you go and you're thinking constantly I'm not going to be able to go that back the same way that I can there's no way I can turn back and you know Lot's wife turned back once and she turned to a pillar of salt the there's no way you can go back you have to keep pressing forward and it's going to take faith because sometimes when you're going down there for that hunt and you hit having to move to the next spot there was one time I started climbing around the edge of a bluff because I had no other way out and the bluff started getting steeper and narrower and the rocks were falling and I had a 20 20 odd kg pack on my back and it was a really scary situation I thought if I have one little slip I'm going to die in this situation and sometimes and you know I think as we go on in this journey we might find ourselves in a situation where we really get pressed up when you say Lord I don't know what to do but you have to have faith you have to get faith and say the Lord as a ministry just commit for it you've got a guy got a nosey take it off no Parab how can take their token off you you're bound to it Laurie what are you gonna do you just you can't go back so what are you just gonna stay there and give up it's going to take a total commitment a commitment to what you believe you know I'm not talking about and when I say commitment I'm not talking about your church attendance yeah that's basic that smoke I'm talking about totally sold out to what you believe committed to what you've been taught as you will see the supernatural before your eyes as a message believer I believe there are promises that have been made for the bride and we enter away to Jesus there's coming there is coming a time upon in this nation to where this nation is going to exercise all the power the Beast had before it and egg in Rome when it became papal Rome see that this nation will do that revelation 13 plainly explains them the lamb come up out of the earth of the other beasts come up out of the water thickness and multitudes of people this land come up where they were no pea a lamb represents a religion the Lamb of God and remember at spake like a lamb it was a lamb and then after a while that received power and spoke like a dragon and yes biased all the dragon power the dragon had before him and the dragon is Rome always so don't you see Roman denomination a mark Protestant denomination and image to the Beast making a power that will force all Protestants like a union you'll have to be in this Council of Churches or you won't be able to have fellowship or well it's practically that way now you can't go to church and preach unless you have a fellowship card or some identification and now on persons like ourselves we're going to be cut out of all that altogether that's exactly because they won't be able to do it as tightening and then when that time comes and the priest comes to a place where you're pressed out then watch what I'm flexing to tell you in a few minutes watch the third pull then see and it'll absolutely be it and it will be absolutely to the total loss and a but it will be for the bride and the church so SS squeeze comes on and you're being pressed out then watch the third pull then but we're limited by our own faith to believe and as we see prophecy happening around us as rising up faith then what happens when it gets down to the wire and you have no food and you have no water because the power companies shut down and the pump station is out of action then what there's no medicine supply medics are overwhelmed and the doctors are sick themselves something has to happen to manifest the power of God amen Laurie and John 14 verse 12 says fairly fairly I say unto you he that believeth on me the works that I do shall he do also and greater works than these shall he do because I go unto my father and here in Shillong 1964 and there is a light of the hour today there Jesus Christ and the power of his resurrection has word their promise for this day the works that I do shall you also greater than these shall you do before I go to the Father greater works greater things than he did do you believe it then I mean believe it it seems humble it seems like it goes over the top of people's head huh look when he was here on earth how could you do greater words I've translated that many times more but the same thing so and and the past he's been teaching that I mean that mean the same things but more of the same things but now he's correcting his teaching here to show something else greater he said in Saint John 14:12 greater works than these shall you do did you notice when he went when he went to make water into wine he took water first and already created substance and turned it into the wine when he fed 5,000 he took a fish that once swam in the water broke it handed out and multiplied creation he took bread that was once we baked into bread broke it and hung it out to the hand to hand it out to the people and return back again multiplied creation but in the last day where there is no sign of creation he speaks into creation anyhow shows to be the same God that was in the beginning he can create squirrels he can create whatever he wants to because he is God greater things than this will you do for I go unto my father the word is available and it has to be manifest and it has to be fulfilled yeah irrational you do not multiply but speaking into creation amen amen Laura the faith for that right now and maybe you don't but wait till you really get pressed out wait as this thing really tightens up then you're gonna see some things being squeezed out of the bride you haven't seen before that's what you see we so commensal message absolutely sold out that this is the truth they use that man with no fear in that day and say I have no need to worry for tomorrow God shall supply my need amen and that faith will require action not just saying I believe it there is you to act and step out of faith well when when you're there and you have need and you can't have fellowship with the other believers and you can't ring up the pastor and say pray for me I'm hungry or it's going to require you to take action yes why it's so important now that you make preparations because there may not be anybody there to help you and you're gonna have to walk on your own all right - wait see here later Jesus still and so now he's talking about when he spoke to the storm and up on the mountain that day I said now we know now we're not first little rain starts or anything take for the can I said within 10 or 15 minutes you can't see your hands before you when they're blizzards and it'll dump 20 foot of snow and a little bit over the mountain and that's how people you read and the papers how they're back there and perish and everything but we know how to get out and they knowed where we was at so we felt led to stay and so up on the mountain when that Blizzard started I started going down and I was just about half a mile away from where I started and the voice of God said turn and go back and I went back as he told me after waiting for a while and eating their sandwich that David gave me and went back up there and sat down and while I was sitting there and that when twisting and blowing the treetops leaning way over and the sleet and snow flying like that a voice said I am the God of creation I looked up and thought where was that that was the one maybe he said I created heavens and earth I stole the mighty winds upon the Seas I went on talking I jumped up and took off my head any sin just speak to the storm and it will cease what do you say that's what will happen and I said storm you cease and Sun you shine normally for four days till we're out of here and I know more than sit there until the sleet the snow everything stopped in a moment or two Oh hallelujah Sun was shining on my back you have to speak an air of me you can't rely on anybody else hmm you have to take the book do you have to eat the book yeah don't rely on the pastor don't rely on the deacon you speak over if you notice in there though brother Brennan was prompted of God to speak and maybe some of you have stepped out before and spoken the name of the Lord and it doesn't happen and maybe it was slightly out of season but don't be discouraged by that as that's going to happen that has to happen amen speak you speak No you realize the power that travels on your words when you speak when you're moved by the Holy Spirit to speak very very powerful but you can me in church age there it is here's the spirit and here's the life that's exactly what the word is that is exactly what Jesus is he is the word so when a spirit born spirit filled man and faith takes that word into his heart and places it upon his lip why that is the same as deity speaking that's right the other mountain has to go say to me and this is when faith becomes perfect complete concentrated to the fulfillment and you speak in the devil trembles at your voice amen demons tremble when you speak as you have more power over than when you come to your maturity but you make preparations now make your commitment knowing when you feel you speak and and what you say God will perform remember though it's not it's not your power that will create there's God's power that you have authority to use yeah and to use that you have to be connected with him so he makes a covenant with you and then you speak consider the natural man he's a many many creator that sona's nature passed down from Adam a man will buy a house and he'll take that property and he'll begin to create his own little mini Eden through his own creative power but he's limited to the natural he can only he can't do the supernatural but yet he has and his nature this creator he wants to make it as own little paradise as only leader yeah men can have a vision say to create light and in the beginning maybe the first light man made a fire and then after that a candle and then after that a light bulb and then an LED see consistently evolved but that's natural the God has made a covenant with you to do the supernatural you don't need an LED there's a man here who can turn on the lights the Lord we're going to have creative power atmosphere don't fear John don't fear little flock all that I am you were here too we are my power is yours make my own appearance is yours as I stand in your mess I have not come to bring fear and fail but love encourage inability alright it's given unto me and it is yours to use amen click the word and I will perform it my covenant and it can never fail Halle Laurie can get so they can get so full of themselves that they think that they can just step out and do whatever they want but yet they don't have the character and having power without character say Tana make sure that we first get the character through you know brother Brown said if you you don't have the right character you'll just speaker you'll speak your own little island into existence and go and live on it he said if you speak to this mountain and tell the mountain to move and you don't have the right character and then mount on the base you and it kills a thousand people on the other side of the mountain first you have to have the character and then he'll come in behind there and back it up and what and it will not fail amen the Covenant that's that blood token mm-hmm hallelujah thank you made it with you and it cannot fail if you had that blood on display that blood will never fail you either you know when I go out on the mountain bike to ride these trails especially when I go on the hard ones I like to know that I'm protected so when I started getting a bit more into it I I thought I really need to go and get some body armor so well I want to get good armor till I don't want to just get stuff that's not gonna work when I get into a sticky situation I want to know that I've protected myself with armor that works so I search out what armor I need what protection do I need and so I paired up my knees and I paired up my elbows and I put on a full face helmet because there's going to be a few knocks along the way but as long as I have put on that armor I know I'm protected well believe us been given his armor also and it's time to put it on because alou you you're gonna ride this trail we're gonna charge down together you know and you're gonna have to have this armor on because it might get messy along the way and counter some things that you're not expecting maybe there's gonna be some big rocks on the trail that you have to get it over or around you hadn't pre you hadn't premeditated that this was going to be a challenge premeditated that someone was going to come into your home and arrest you for material that you were watching online well whatever the trial is and you're going to have to have body armor on ready knowing he not a handle on that day but you can have on all this armor and it still not be enough to protect you you know I can wrap myself up like a bubble and tumble to the bottom of the hole and I'm probably going to still be really confused at the bottom so you have to you have to become skillful Rider you have to become a mature Christian that's fully committed to this promise oh yeah the faith sold out to this message of just a message as Jesus Christ Haven and praise go I can't lay that out any harder that you have to become skillful with the revelation that's being delivered to you because you can know all the mysteries you can have all the revelation you can have all the quotes you can listen to all the tapes you can listen to all the ministers and you can have all that knowledge but if you don't become skillful and how you use it won't have any effect you'll speak and nothing will happen have to become skillful mmm praise the Lord I've got another scripture I want to go to I was try not to make this long I don't want to keep it too long Hebrews 5/5 13 see everyone that uses milk is unskillful in the word of righteousness for he is obeyed but strong meat belongeth to them that are of full age even those who by reason of use have their senses exercised to discern both good and evil now I said to you before about that word perfect that I wanted to pick up on that meaning again and then this statement to them that are of a full age it has the same same meaning in the concordance as that perfect when we read faith by works being made perfect as strong meat belongeth to them that are a full age to the ahmet have come to maturity so them that have come to the full you know brother Brennan was the first fruits of the earth coming to maturity for the sage to bring this message they give you one has to come there right now you have to come into a full age they may be perfect they may complete strong meters to them to that a complete that have consummated their relationship to Christ and it becomes skilful to handle this word and speak in the name of Jesus this this is not for everyone that calls himself a believer it's for them that a complete in Christ with the blood of interplay because if you don't have but on display it's not for you this power that we're talking about so I really wanted to just keep this thought to this are you committed to writing this trail are you totally sold out that this is thus saith the Lord this message is right or are you gonna start writing down that trail and checking out on each of a bluff because I want to know that I'm sold out I want to know that I believe what I believe then I want to know that what I believe is the truth and then once I know that I can have absolute total confidence total faith that this is right this is the right direction that it'll take me right through yes just keep looking forward to the end of the trail don't take your eyes off Jesus and he'll see you through any moon we're gonna have faith to believe the supernatural is going to take place before you and fullness and I know some of you have seen supernatural happen in the church before the gifts have been with us the gifts have been with us ever since Pentecost but brother Branham was the firstfruits to come to maturity but I'm expecting to see an outpouring of those same works but it will be for the bride and as that whole field comes to maturity that combine harvester will come down and gather us up I mean now I'm feeling that that time is at hand they will maybe it'll be a few more years but it's a hand you know think about brother brother Isaac's vision for this movie I thought you know I truly believe that there must be enough time left to bring forth the smoothie I almost feel that it's maybe going to be a part of this fulfillment of preaching to the lost souls so it's pulling out any other message as putting out there what's taken place and people can't deny it you know I was told I said we may not know the day but we know the season yeah going through a change in season and I'm talking natural now when the season begins to change means these things that start happening there's a feeling that goes with it you know that the leaves start turning colors and you can reveal these these the change in the wind the changing the temperature the changes and you know that something's changing those were coming a change and I believe the season right now is changing you can feel the tension that's out there in the world like I went down to get some groceries the other day and there's a man walking around the supermarket aisles and he has a full spraying mask on on his head like totally encapsulating his head with her look like he is walking around a nuclear power plant and that kind of sounds ridiculous but people were scared people were had a fear come over them because even the non-christian they can sense that something's happening because of will can't just go on the way it's going on us over those road ends corrupted and there's coming a change and people were worried because they don't know what the future holds the future holds but we as Christians we know what the future holds we can have faith to believe because we know the privilege that's been given to the bride there's many people out there that have conspiracy theories of our the 5gs causing viruses it's just a load of annoyance but they want to have something that they can tie to something that they can hold to basically they want to have something they can put faith into and but there's no this there's no redemption and their faith there's no there's no light at the end of tunnel and having that conspiracy belief but believing in the fluid this light at the end of the tamale yeah is going to take you in a rapture amen well the same way that I know these seasons are changing it's the same way that I know that we entering into the in time season I can feel it amen so I just pray that you can glean some words out of this little fordham and take something home talk about something see what it does for you I trust there something have spoken will hit home amen so I'll turn it back over to you brother I'm going maybe we can sing a couple of songs what bless you brother James could be so rich - my brother let's slap hands for the Lord radda may God bless you for such wonderful ways that remind us about the hour that we are living in amen may God really help us may God bring us to that level you know where we can be able to be right this trail again Amen hallelujah and we're gonna sing one or two songs but maybe before we do that can you can just be reverent and just maybe the brothers to pray for us and just - amen hmm it's got a brother and brother Manku prize yeah brother Mont I don't see it on the screen I'm sure he's listening well our mind if you can just play for us my brother and before we sing the song do you brother a gracious Heavenly Father thank you so much for this evening Lord truly Laura we have much tool to do here on earth Lord they still a great Commission for your bride Laurin a lot of things that's undone and lord I ask that you would just guide us each one of us thank you for brother James's message I do believe it's in season Lord and that we should have all a check-up Lord on what we do daily to further the kingdom of God Lord or truly we don't want anyone to go to that place Lord my brother Brennan was preaching saying when he was lying on the bed Lord and bleeding out his legs and he fell and he he asked to be caught Lord Jesus and it was they which is keep on falling into this dark place Lordan and how I said it was such a terrible place he doesn't even want his enemies to go there and so much more year we are between the living and the dead Lord and we still have a commission to to talk about you and to heed this message to everyone to say take care there is a time coming Lord and the season is drawing so close to so quickly Lord we see how time is just speeding up father what are we doing Lord it's it's it's not all about works Lord but the works does display and what we believe in the Lord oh sure what we put our trust in father so I pray Lord that you would give us that boldness Lord and to take that book and eat it Lord and prophesy again Lord and be the voice to this this lost dying world Lord there has no faith and no belief anymore Lord and an absolutely a think they can come through every storm Lord and everything will be alright this is the first time you've shaken a world law to a standstill it's absolutely at a standstill Lord and people know now Lord there they must be they must be a time where all of this comes to an end the man destroys himself so our pray Lord Jesus that the bride would minister to the people now Lord minister to them love and the true way of getting out of this place Lord Jesus without having to see things Lord I believe that every one of us Lord has come to a place where you're talking to each of our hearts Lord and saying they must be a friend they must be a were calling there must be someone Lord that wants to know about you Lord and if we don't shine our light how would they know how would they see Jesus Christ today on this earth Lord if we don't reflect Jesus Christ within us I pray that you would you get us all to check up and to shake up Lord and stand up Lord and keep walking forth father and and to keep on being salty Lord and to my brother Chris sit back then and it touched me so much well then that salt would connect with that meat Lord and it would absolutely preserve that meat Lord for that rapture father I pray that we will be that so we won't just be thrown on the on the road and on the wayside Lord but absolutely can make whether the meat thorn in due season Lord to bring forth your word on this earth thank you so much for brother James that gave this word Lord and truly I've taken many a notes today Lord and I I really want to go listen to that message Shalom again lord I think there's so much beautiful stuff flow that we are at a place but we we don't need to stress or worry we just have to sit and yield ourselves to you Lord and know that all will be done according
