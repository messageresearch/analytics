it out yes Jesus trying to get up listening tonight mother and Load become to fellowship around us oh this is Easter time Lord Jesus it is a very special time very Christian yeah this is where our walk has begun with unity though this is where the whole plan of redemption the whole Christian the Lord Jesus when you can't do this when you have started off that final Symphony Lord Jesus Lord and how you started revealing yourselves this day Lord not just in flesh law but once more in spirit through your people Lord Lord I pray Lord that the cross would not just be a thing of history logo but a very reality now in our life oh the you know that that blood is precious blood Lord but that's before even Lord when you you have the lamb that was shaped Lord the Passover lamb how's that lamb type you Lord Jesus and that blood Lord Jesus that they put on the lintel type you Lord Jesus and when you came to the crucifixion Lord and every precious blood that dripped on the floor Lord was for healing yes for an enticement was upon you Lord Jesus thank you Lord that we as Christians now can just walk Lord yes Lord walk with you in the newness of life yes long right it shake that offerings Lord maybe tonight Calvinism the shapes lattices Ram Lord and just remember what you've done for us that they on Calvary oh gee I pray that everyone would just aim to read tonight and when they get their blessing tonight oh man Lord for if we count Lord and we willing Lord you are able I know Lord Jesus please these words take this this little lesson Lord and just maybe glorifying you yes Lord and you'll keep going and I know the kingdom of saw here on this and help us in your food sometimes I get so nervous when I stand here I know every everyone that stands here basically gets nervous because when we talk about the Word of God we don't take it very lightly it's something that's very precious to us and maybe tonight I can encourage you that you might not always see things as someone else sees it but it doesn't mean that it's wrong because hopefully tonight when we look at the crucifixion we see it from a different angle and different people relate to different things that happen on that day of the crucifixion but it doesn't mean they just want to get my book and we're just going to read from verse 39 to verse 43 so you mean when you leave and it says here all he started verse 38 and the superscription also was written over him in the letters of Greek and Latin and in Hebrews this is the King of the Jews and one of the male factors which was hung raised on him saying if thou be the Christ saves ourselves and us but the other answering rebuked him saying does not thou fear God saying thou art in the same condemnation and we indeed justify for we receive a due reward of our deeds but this man have done nothing amiss and he said unto Jesus Lord remember me when thou comest into thy kingdom and Jesus said unto Him verily I say unto thee today shalt thou be with me in paradise amen may the law just least the reading of his word you can sit down so we have we have three accounts of the crucifixion and what I've done because I always get nervous when I have to share a bit of about the law because I don't know what to share and and I always think that as a person sometimes when we see something we just see it wrong but the Lord has showed me so much that that if we just keep on reading the word and keep on listening to the message he will guide us into all truth and all life so then I went and I listened to to the book of Matthew and I and I read while I was listening and I read the account and see Matthew he was very concentrated about what the disciples did and and how they deceived the Lord and how they worked in the background and he's detail is a bit more if we look at the what he says he concentrates on the thieves but he doesn't really mention this part where the one thief rebuked the other one he just said they scorned him so he doesn't really mention this and when you get to Luke Luke mentions this story and he really points it out that hey something happened they but when we go to John John doesn't even mention any of it it just says they was he was hung between malefactors and and that just fulfills the scripture that he would be hung the prophecy you would hung between malefactors so that got me thinking I'm thinking here about three disciples all three of them at the same place but all three of them with a different part of the same account so they're always there and they all looked at the cross and they all see what was happening but one was concentrating on the the deceit of the disciples and one was looking through the thieves on the cross and the other one was looking at the prophecies being fulfilled so they had a different point of view that they looked at the crucifixion but it's the same with us if we come into Easter like we came now is there something different in Easter that that gets revealed to us and not everybody gets the same revelation when I first came into the the macy's praise the Lord the first thing that was very important to me was the blood then I could apply that blood and that blood once it's applied I'm on speaking terms with God again and for me that was important and that the blog would change me from all sin because when I was being purified I needed that blood so for me calvary had a meaning of blood and if I didn't have that blood I couldn't I couldn't talk to God because I had to apply the blood so he can see I have no sin and he can come the holy God and speak to me and he knows that I have no sin and we are on speaking terms so for me the first time I heard about the cross it was about the blood but then again the next year when we came to the very same time it wasn't about the cross for me and it wasn't about the blood me though they're all very important it was what was God revealing again to me to saying that he is Jesus Christ he was walking up that cross before he gone he got stripes on his back and that was for my healing and and he was bruised my iniquities so so the next year when I was in the I said oh but God didn't just purchased me he didn't just clean me but he also paid everything even my healing in future things already back then so I just kept on walking so this year I'm sitting and I'm looking at the same event and all of a sudden I see but they were two thieves and the ones attitude towards the Christ was get yourself all day and while you do it get me off with you as well because he was looking for a way out but the other one was looking for a way in so he was looking at God to get into heaven though he was he was as guilty as everyone and even could he even confesses he says I we get a just reward but this man is innocent and then and in while I look at this story now look at the judgment hall and here's its Pilate Pilate stands before Jesus and he and he says you say you're the King of the Jews he says no I don't say that he says you say that so Jesus doesn't come and say yeah I'm the King of the Jews you know I'm all God Almighty coming to look at all these wonderful miracles he was just very humble and he sees two stage to Pilate you say I am king and then he says but but these people they come all before you and they they give you all these accusations you say nothing and Jesus said nothing and then Pilate walks out unbeliever and he gets in front of the believers and he says I find no fault in this man and the believers answer is crucified he says okay I've got it I've got a deal I gotta do because he wants to get this off his hands he wants to come clean because he is a unbelievers looking at this situation going these more to this than meets the eye this man is not murdered someone this man is not killed someone he's just standing right before me and there's nothing wrong so he wants to get this off his hands he wants to get the blood off his head so he goes out one more time and he sees to the people he sees I find no fault in this man he says but let me tell you this we've got a custom that on this day of the Passover we can release a thief or of someone to your prisoner to you and and we've got this guy Barabbas so it was even trying to sell the hardest case to them so they would let Jesus go he was trying everything in himself as an unbeliever to get this man off Jesus Christ and and they were going now crucifying will take Barabbas and so he goes in front of them all and he says while I wash my hands of it and they answer but ladies blood be on us and upon our children and heaps why that's why the Jews is where they are now today because that prophecy is still being fulfilled they said so then I look at that and I think okay I don't I don't get this brother Branham says he and one of his service he says then they crucified Him and he says these words he says the message that I've got on my heart to preach up here and the next meeting on a Good Friday afternoon is theirs they crucified Him they the holiest religious place in the world was Jerusalem they the most holiest people supposed to be people in the world the Jews that's what he sees in the quote he sees they crucified the most cruelest punishment at Rome at that time and they says and what the greatest person ever lived they crucified him so then I thought this really struck me I was lifting this conundrum that and I'm gonna read this next part to you because this might be just highlight what happens is well when when people see it in a corner way and not in God's provided way so just before all of this if we go to Matthew 27 I'll just read it for you and it's verse 1 to verse 6 I'm gonna read since then when in the morning has come all the chief priests and elders of the people took counsel against Jesus to put him to death and when they had bound him they led him away and delivered him unto Pontius Pilate the governor then Judas which have betrayed him when he saw that he was condemned he repented himself and he brought again thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and elders saying I have sinned and that I have betrayed an innocent blood so even Judas that was with the Lord that intentionally went out and did this started realizing man I can't take this back I have just betrayed an innocent man his blood is now on my hands as well same as with Pontius Pilate and then he was an unbeliever so both of them are now in the same situation but see now look what happens here he says saying I have sinned that I have betrayed an innocent blood and they said what is that to us just see that the see see those do that and then he calls down the pieces of silver in the temple and they departed and he went and hung himself and the chief priests took the silver pieces and said it is not lawful for us to put it into the treasury because this because it is the price of blood so even the Pharisees knew what they have done so when God said that I've blinded the the Jews eyes to this they were blinded but they when they knew what they'd done so I want to bring it in today's life we have gotten a message from the Lord that we walk in and isn't the same two spirits again fighting this battle is it at exactly the same time as at the time of Easter you have people that believe the report that sees what's going on and you have people standing right next to it saying we not have this man rule over us and in what they do is he is the two very characters now coming the thief that was wrong repented and says madam was wrong and he humbled himself and came to the Lord and the Lord received him but the other one was proud and boastful and he's character just took him further away from God so then it got me thinking that my biggest my biggest revelation out of this whole Easter this time is what is the Lord revealing to you and what are you willing to accept and if it goes against the grain inside you are you willing to just put it down then to go and fight and reason against the Word of God because it ain't going to get you anyway it's going to get you to a place where you might maybe push more than you should and then and then you had a place we go if I just if I just put it down we had a person and I'll share in the Fellowship we had a person come in and and brother Ben was one day was preaching and the person said I enjoyed the service until he said that I said but what about the rest of it and he said nah stop listening so this is the attitude but see a true believer says Lord I don't understand what's going on but please show me so so when I look at the cross Jesus going up hanging between two thieves and this is my Easter message if I can give it to you hanging between thieves the king of kings the king of the Jews and everybody else scorns him and lost city and said get off they you know get off the cross help yourself he could if he could have called angels and it would have all been over but so he's hanging there and he's just thinking about us that's here now because he was thinking about us because if God is eternal and he's sovereign and he knows the beginning from the end he knew we were here and when he was hanging there he was thinking about us it wasn't thinking about the unbelievers he was thinking about us and the very purpose why he purchased us so he's hanging there and he is you can many would have been in so Spain and it's just looking around him going man all these guys they spit on me they they they scoff us they tell me to get off this cross yet they blind yeah and he looks through the thief and the thief says yeah you get us and you off the cross and he goes another one and then the other thief sees rebukes the other season see you keep quiet this man is innocent and then he looks at this thief and Nene goes this is why I'm here this very fact that I'm doing now this is why I'm here because these are people that wouldn't be proud that wouldn't be boastful but would actually take my provided way and this is why I'm doing this and then the jury was before him and then he died and he cried out loud and he says he sees my God my God why is a forsaken it because the Spirit of God left him and he had to die as a man twas God cannot die and he died but then he rose again anything so I don't want to talk about the resurrection because we're gonna have to Easter weekend and I think it's gonna be wonderful the weekend are we gonna talk some some resurrection power over thee but I want to say that something had to die for us and when Jesus came and he died for us the same as with the Passover isn't it strange that Jesus died on the Passover you know other people find us strange and weird that we got all these connections in the Bible and you see see the head to have the lamb and they had to become one with the lamb and the blood had to be applied and every year when you walk you see that and then God connects a bit more and he puts another piece in the puzzle and he puts another piece in the puzzle but see God will keep on putting pieces in your puzzle if you are willing to have him put it there it is just not what you can do it's not who you are it's not how good you are is what God can show you revelation so yeah man praise the Lord there was one more that I wanted to say strange so we go past the just before the crucifixion so the holiest of holy people holding Beelzebub yeah but Legion hold him the Son of God so I I don't get it I don't get how how if they call him a devil the holiest of holy and and the devil calls him God we did they miss it how did they go wrong how did they not see it but see that was God's provide away now he is the message some people say their brother branham is just a false prophet some people say we just phonetics some people say there's nothing to this but guess what he confirms it maybe a bit of a testimony if I can close with that Liam can I see your testimony alright okay are you sure good okay so Liam header had a sore on his hand what do you call it a Frankie a wart on his hand a real bad wart on his hand and it was swollen and big and ugly and basically I'm gonna just make a long story short but I want to just get to the just of it so we pray over it and this wart and and while we praying the Lord speaks to Reuben and and he says that he should dip his ward a hand under water for one minute and we should pray for it then and then in two days it will be healed so we say to Liam Liam which you want to do it and Liam says well I don't know I'm scared so we said okay well if you skate we'll just we'll just leave it well back a bit off but we'll come back to this and so of course me and mum we forgot and time went past and in one day Liam said well and we reminded him of a nice in a while he'll try it now but see it's like at the Pool of Bethesda the water was stirred when we were praying so that time was then but God moved on so now we get to a stage where we do do it and we do pray but now nothing happens oh we go well this is a bit confusing now because because God said so and if God sees so heat will come to pass and if it doesn't come to pass God didn't say so and right as we say the Pool of Bethesda story comes back and I'm mmm that's it the water was stirred it would have happened that time so of course we all go and talk to Liam and said okay it didn't happen cause he asked his mom but it didn't happen on my stole all right with the story okay but it didn't happen I'm like brother Andy gets reminded a lot that brother peed and it didn't happen so we we prayed for him as well and and he was anointed with oil and but he really repented he said Lord I'm sorry you know you could heal me and I believe it and so we prayed again and then how many days after that that they let be prayed again about a week about a week it started going away in a piece of this this war fell off but there was a black dot in the middle of it and it started going black and it was like the life of this thing just went out it just died and then as he was playing it that something else had played and it felt completely over when he was healed but see God's told us things for us to tell us that he is still here so if this message is not true and we pray it wouldn't it wouldn't come to pass if we walking in the will of God and and we believe in these in these Commandments and we believe in and I don't stop listening to the tapes whatever you do don't stop listening to the tapes don't stop reading your Bible brother been said four chapters a day you can get through the Bible don't stop feeding because when you stop that's when the trials come because when you stop moving God will start moving you he will he will bring you trial after trial he will shake heavens and earth till he get you back in your place don't see it as a bad thing you see it is and it's not when you sometimes you reading Bible and you're praying every day and everything's good and you still get trials that doesn't mean you out of the will of God or God's not dealing with you that just means God's working with another face but I want to bring it back aside I went there I don't know why praise the Lord but when you look at the crucifixion every year when we do the Easter it is a personal walk with God I said to brother either one the other night I looked at that brother n Andy's what was his name John Andy's he preached about a personal God and God is personal to every single one of us and how you see the story your sister or your brother or your mom or your dad doesn't need to see it the same but if you really want to know what it means go listen to the tapes because it will be explained to you and God will keep on revealing as you walk so yeah I'm sorry I digressed I wanted to kind of end up with that but I the story of Liam this remember God is a God of miracle he is sovereign he can heal he can give you a job he can take care of his own he can do anything he's God why do we limit the power of God and the power of the blood so once God said hasn't forgiven you he's forgiven you it's over it's done so yeah I didn't want to stop thee but praise the Lord I think we can go into a bit of a pre maybe brother being you
