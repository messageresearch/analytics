[31:50] the song
[31:50] is based on james chapter 4 verse 10.
[31:54] for the bible readers it it says humble
[31:57] yourself
[31:58] in the sight of the lord and he shall
[32:00] lift you up
[32:02] i think that's what i had i picked up
[32:04] this morning
[32:05] amen humbling yourself in the sight of
[32:08] the lord
[32:09] and he shall lift you up that's why we
[32:12] are singing this morning
[32:13] and by the way the opposite
[32:16] is also true
[32:20] if you don't humble yourself the lord
[32:23] cannot lift you up
[32:25] he can lift your way down
[32:28] hallelujah sorry i'm just i'm a minister
[32:30] so i tend to
[32:32] i tend to to speak instead of seeing
[32:36] just just give joshua don't try to hold
[32:38] it
[32:41] just to excuse us if we are not
[32:44] so good it's just because we need to
[32:46] make a joyful noise unto the lord
[32:49] to tell the lord that we worship him
[32:52] listening to the children in the
[32:53] classroom
[32:54] you know it's so heart-touching if you
[32:56] listen to them praying
[32:59] praying to god in their own words from
[33:01] their own hearts
[33:02] listening to them carefully you realize
[33:05] that you've got a lot of work to do as
[33:07] parents
[33:08] these children they're waiting on us
[33:12] amen and the prophet says there's no
[33:14] more child
[33:16] delinquency nowadays he says his
[33:18] parental deliverance
[33:20] kids are waiting on us on our fire for
[33:23] their fire to build
[33:25] help us lord
[33:33] [Music]
[33:37] you yourself
[33:40] humble yourself in the sight of the lord
[33:52] you up
[33:55] he shall lift you up
[33:59] if you humble yourself in the sign of
[34:02] the lord
[34:04] he shall lift you up for yourself in the
[34:12] sight of the
[34:14] [Music]
[34:18] if you lord yourself in the sight of the
[34:24] [Music]
[34:32] lord

[34:49] he shall lift you up
[35:04] he shall
[35:16] praise the lord um brother ahmad
[35:22] just as he's getting set up i'm reminded
[35:25] of a story
[35:26] you know a guy thought he knew quite a
[35:28] bit going up to preach so he
[35:30] walked up to the pulpit you know
[35:31] shoulders back ready to
[35:35] deliver what he had and it all didn't
[35:37] work
[35:39] and i guess by the end of the service he
[35:41] was kind of went down
[35:42] a lot more humbler than when he what he
[35:45] was when he walked up
[35:47] you know one of the sisters said if he
[35:50] walked up
[35:51] the way he walked down he would have
[35:53] walked down the way he walked up
[36:20] that's when sound takes sound something
[36:24] will
[36:26] trace hello
[36:53] i'm just waiting for you to one day at
[36:54] the back

[40:55] all over again
[41:15] just before we do a few worship songs
[41:16] sister brahman has a testimony that
[41:18] she'd like to share so
[41:33] good morning
[41:36] just wanted to share a testimony that's
[41:38] really special to me um
[41:40] it was actually 10 years ago andy and i
[41:42] just met him
[41:44] and you know heard about the message and
[41:45] everything and i had a dear grandmother
[41:47] who was a very special lady
[41:48] in her 80s she just lived a very simple
[41:52] life
[41:52] and um she she was just a loving person
[41:56] you know like that and we really wanted
[41:58] her to to have a relationship with the
[42:00] lord
[42:01] and we were so much and we'd always go
[42:03] over there tell her about the lord
[42:05] and talk to her and she would say this
[42:07] is lovely this is so good for you and
[42:08] then she'd
[42:09] watch back to coronation street and she
[42:10] said that's nice for you
[42:12] but not for mary her name is mary she
[42:14] said not for mary i went up to the altar
[42:16] when i was
[42:18] five years old and the priest said
[42:20] you're okay now mary
[42:22] and so she said that's it that's all you
[42:24] know and it would so discourage us and
[42:26] we were so
[42:27] zealous and so we knew there was so much
[42:29] more that she could have and it um
[42:32] it stressed us out a bit you know
[42:34] because you so much you're so zealous
[42:35] and you so much want
[42:37] what she could have and um and
[42:40] she had lots of miracles that happened
[42:41] like she had carpal tunnel syndrome the
[42:43] lord supernaturally
[42:44] came she felt his presence wash over her
[42:45] body completely healed her of carpal
[42:47] tunnel
[42:48] lots of things happened supernatural for
[42:50] her yet she just continued on
[42:52] and um and a couple of years went by and
[42:55] we
[42:55] we you know it was it was quite hard for
[42:59] us at that time but
[43:01] um one day she went into hospital and
[43:03] then they said to her
[43:06] just very suddenly you've actually got
[43:08] cancer through your whole body
[43:09] and she was in extreme pain and they
[43:11] said every basically every organ's got
[43:13] some cancer in it
[43:14] and you've only got you know you might
[43:16] not make it through the night type of
[43:17] thing and so
[43:19] um we so much in our hearts burdened for
[43:22] our nana you know praying for her and
[43:23] everything
[43:24] and then i just want to it's helped me
[43:26] to trust the lord so much that he has
[43:28] perfect timing in
[43:29] everything um then she
[43:33] she went um i was working still
[43:36] and she she's one of those people that
[43:38] tough as old boots will hang on and hang
[43:40] on so a few days later
[43:42] she's in this private room they just
[43:44] moved her out into a private room went
[43:45] into the room
[43:46] i just felt so strongly in my heart when
[43:48] i was working go and see your nana and
[43:49] so i went to my workmates and i said i
[43:51] just have to go to my nana
[43:52] and they said i will cover you go i went
[43:54] and i sat down next door and i said nana
[43:57] did you know that there's um because she
[43:59] used to talk to me about the pearly
[44:00] gates and i said this jesus he's going
[44:02] to meet you at the pearly gates
[44:04] and she said yes i will i will talk to
[44:06] him when i get there i said to you know
[44:08] you know we can talk to him make it
[44:10] right she said when i get there then
[44:11] i'll speak to him
[44:12] i said to her why would you wait we can
[44:15] talk to him right now if you like and
[44:16] make things right and she said
[44:18] i would like that and we prayed right
[44:20] there and i said you pray nana because
[44:22] he knows what's in your heart and she
[44:23] just said
[44:24] jesus i'm a little sheep and you're the
[44:27] shepherd
[44:28] here's mary and that was basically her
[44:30] whole prayer
[44:31] and then um the nurse walked in the door
[44:34] right after that with a morphine
[44:36] pump and she put the morphine pump in
[44:38] and that was
[44:39] my nana you know for the next few days
[44:41] it was her consciousness changes you
[44:43] know
[44:44] in her last sort of conscious moments of
[44:46] being there she
[44:47] accepted the lord and um
[44:51] then a few days later she um
[44:55] i would go into the room and just be
[44:56] sitting with her and singing that
[44:58] hallelujah chorus
[45:00] and the presence of the lord was there
[45:02] and i knew the angels were there with us
[45:07] and then um this one day when i went in
[45:10] because it was
[45:11] quite a few days later and then she said
[45:13] can you see this this is wonderful and i
[45:16] said what
[45:16] what nana because we always i've always
[45:18] wondered she hasn't been baptized and
[45:19] she hasn't this
[45:21] she said look around can't you see this
[45:23] can't you hear that
[45:24] i said hear what she said she said
[45:26] there's always people in white all
[45:28] up around the edges she said i can see
[45:30] mary walking she said
[45:32] walking up towards these big this big
[45:34] she said it's like a big church opening
[45:36] she said
[45:37] everybody's in white and she said you
[45:38] won't believe the old church comes it
[45:40] sounds amazing
[45:42] calling me in and um yes so
[45:45] i just when when um
[45:51] when i hear that song about when we
[45:53] gather at the river she used to sing
[45:54] that to me when i was a little girl
[45:56] and i just thought wow it won't be long
[45:59] and we'll
[46:00] we'll meet mary at the river you know
[46:02] [Music]
[46:04] when we gather at the river because i
[46:05] always used to wonder when she used to
[46:07] sing it when we gather at the river
[46:08] you know and i would think i wonder what
[46:10] river she's talking about but
[46:12] it's funny that the lord had all her
[46:14] life she didn't you know
[46:17] um the lord just has perfect timing for
[46:19] everything
[46:20] and we don't have to worry all our
[46:21] worrying and fussing and everything
[46:23] we don't need to worry at all the lord
[46:25] has his children all in his hand
[46:27] he loves them each one and he will
[46:29] gather them all
[46:30] you know we just have to commit them and
[46:32] trust him just walk with him

[1:01:51] one of you here today
[1:01:53] amen i mean second samuel and
[1:01:58] in chapter five we're going to read
[1:01:59] verses 22 to 25
[1:02:03] and then we're going to read matthew 24
[1:02:09] verse 36 onward so second samuel five
[1:02:15] and in verse 22 we're gonna read from
[1:02:18] there
[1:02:30] and the philistines came up yet again
[1:02:34] and spread themselves in the valley of
[1:02:36] riffian
[1:02:38] and when david inquired of the lord he
[1:02:40] said
[1:02:41] thou shall not go up but feature compass
[1:02:44] behind them
[1:02:45] and come upon them over against the
[1:02:47] mulberry trees
[1:02:49] and let it be where now here's the sound
[1:02:51] of a going
[1:02:52] now i want you to notice a sound of a
[1:02:54] going
[1:02:55] so there's a certain time when he's
[1:02:56] gonna attack
[1:02:58] at the sound of a going and the tops of
[1:03:01] the mulberry
[1:03:02] trees that there now shall bestow
[1:03:04] thyself
[1:03:05] and then shall the lord go out before
[1:03:08] thee
[1:03:08] to smite the host of the philistines and
[1:03:11] david did so as the lord had
[1:03:13] commanded him and smote the philistines
[1:03:15] from geba
[1:03:16] uh until they'll come to gazia
[1:03:20] amen and let's just um actually you can
[1:03:22] have your seats this morning we're just
[1:03:24] going to read there but i'm
[1:03:25] and we'll go into matthew 24 later but
[1:03:27] i'd like to take this and
[1:03:29] i think it was something brother um said
[1:03:30] on that wednesday or
[1:03:32] um also what brother albert was saying
[1:03:34] on sunday but i want to take a
[1:03:35] a a thought and i just pray the lord
[1:03:38] would
[1:03:38] just give us courage david would be here
[1:03:41] and we know he fought many battles he he
[1:03:44] would go out
[1:03:44] as a shepherd boy against goliath and we
[1:03:47] know the result of that battle is
[1:03:49] goliath was headless and david was
[1:03:51] victorious and
[1:03:52] you know he would become king and he
[1:03:54] would go through many many different
[1:03:55] battles and he would
[1:03:57] fight the enemy in different ways and
[1:03:58] but there came a time where
[1:04:00] there was a a time when when the lord
[1:04:03] told him
[1:04:04] to to come another way but at the sound
[1:04:06] of a going that's when he needs to
[1:04:08] strike
[1:04:09] now we live in a time of going brother
[1:04:12] brown would say
[1:04:13] and and and i'll come into it later but
[1:04:14] he says really the rapture is a secret
[1:04:17] going
[1:04:18] it's a secret going it doesn't really
[1:04:20] say it's a coming it's more of a going
[1:04:21] than a coming
[1:04:22] so let's just go to matthew matthew 24
[1:04:26] here i just want to read jesus would
[1:04:27] would speak of a a parable here in
[1:04:31] matthew 24 we're just going to read from
[1:04:32] verse 36 to 42.
[1:04:36] and um you know if there's ever a time
[1:04:38] for the church the living god to stand
[1:04:40] on her feet
[1:04:41] and take the two edges sword of the word
[1:04:42] and just chop philistine's plum to the
[1:04:44] walls it's now
[1:04:46] it's not a time to sit back i believe
[1:04:49] we're hearing a sound of a going
[1:04:51] we're we have heard the sound of a going
[1:04:53] right we're living in this time of the
[1:04:55] sound of a going
[1:04:56] you know this message we received is a
[1:04:58] leaving message
[1:04:59] right it's not a coming message but it
[1:05:01] is the coming of the lord don't get me
[1:05:03] wrong but it's a leaving
[1:05:04] just like when moses went down you know
[1:05:07] you know even
[1:05:08] even the book of exodus that word exodus
[1:05:10] means a mass
[1:05:11] departure of people right and that was
[1:05:13] the first exodus it was a leaving
[1:05:15] of a people from egypt to go to the
[1:05:17] promised land and even when
[1:05:18] when jesus was here john the baptist
[1:05:20] introduced him it was a leaving
[1:05:22] i mean not for not for a people to go
[1:05:24] from one part of the earth to another
[1:05:26] but to go from
[1:05:27] under the under the blood of bulls and
[1:05:29] goats into the baptism of the holy ghost
[1:05:30] so they actually
[1:05:32] left one place and went to another place
[1:05:34] spiritually
[1:05:35] now we know in this day that there's a
[1:05:37] people upon the earth and i believe i'm
[1:05:38] looking at those people right you've got
[1:05:40] to say i'm ready
[1:05:42] the lord has made me ready amen his
[1:05:44] blood has been shed it's more than
[1:05:46] enough
[1:05:47] that's more than enough for any
[1:05:48] situation any trouble any sin
[1:05:50] any trouble hallelujah i am ready
[1:05:52] because he has made me ready
[1:05:54] hallelujah so you know
[1:05:57] take the word i've heard we've heard the
[1:06:00] sound of it going this is the season
[1:06:02] to get every promise this is the season
[1:06:05] amen for
[1:06:06] for every divine promise of god to be
[1:06:08] fulfilled
[1:06:09] we know the philistines they are always
[1:06:11] there to rob and to block the visitation
[1:06:13] of god
[1:06:14] like the three mighty men david had a
[1:06:15] desire one day if i could just drink
[1:06:17] from the well of bethlehem
[1:06:19] you know because because he remembered
[1:06:21] what it was like to be a little boy and
[1:06:23] drink cold water from that well and they
[1:06:25] just heard
[1:06:26] you know those mighty men just heard the
[1:06:27] yearning of the king
[1:06:29] and and he didn't even command them it
[1:06:31] was just a small desire in david's heart
[1:06:33] became a great commandment to them
[1:06:35] and they chopped their way through who
[1:06:37] philistines
[1:06:38] until they got to the well of bethlehem
[1:06:40] and they got the water and they brought
[1:06:41] it back to david
[1:06:42] i mean so it was those philistines were
[1:06:44] trying to block david getting a cool
[1:06:46] drink of water
[1:06:47] and brother ram says oh warrior sons of
[1:06:49] bethlehem
[1:06:50] now is the time to draw the two-edged
[1:06:52] sword chop through all tradition
[1:06:55] chop through all indifference chop
[1:06:56] through all unbelief chop through all
[1:06:58] denominations
[1:06:59] trees of man i mean let's get our king a
[1:07:02] fresh drink of pentecostal water
[1:07:04] and worship hallelujah
[1:07:08] that's what we're called to do on this
[1:07:10] day amen we're not called just to go
[1:07:12] through the motions of having a worship
[1:07:14] you know you're having a church but to
[1:07:16] get him a fresh drink
[1:07:18] a fresh worship hey we're built to do it
[1:07:20] are we not they were built to chop
[1:07:22] through those philistines
[1:07:23] they were actually built they were
[1:07:25] trained they were ready amen they knew
[1:07:26] how to kill philistines real good
[1:07:28] and they killed them that way and they
[1:07:30] killed them coming back
[1:07:31] hallelujah and they got him a fresh
[1:07:33] drink we're built
[1:07:34] to defeat the devil amen remember it's
[1:07:37] not you that does it
[1:07:38] it's the lord in you right but we are
[1:07:40] built
[1:07:41] by the baptism of the holy ghost we are
[1:07:43] built to defeat any devil any place any
[1:07:45] time anywhere
[1:07:47] amen now we read here in matthew 24.
[1:07:51] so that was a we'll probably come back
[1:07:53] around that way again but you know i
[1:07:56] just
[1:07:57] matthew 24 36 but of the day
[1:08:01] and hour knoweth no man no not the
[1:08:04] angels of heaven but my father only
[1:08:07] but as the days of noah were so shall
[1:08:10] also the coming of the son of man be now
[1:08:12] notice the condition of this
[1:08:14] from the days that were before the flood
[1:08:16] they were eating
[1:08:17] and drinking we all eat and drink
[1:08:21] marrying wise and given a marriage this
[1:08:23] is the condition of the world we live in
[1:08:25] until the day that noah entered into the
[1:08:29] ark
[1:08:30] and knew not until the flood came
[1:08:33] and took them all away so shall also the
[1:08:36] coming of the son of man be
[1:08:38] so notice there was no great pool the
[1:08:41] ark was built
[1:08:42] the animals were in noah and his family
[1:08:46] were in
[1:08:46] there's no sudden great pull on the
[1:08:48] earth we've got to get in
[1:08:51] people were just living life they knew
[1:08:53] it not
[1:08:54] until the flood came so they just
[1:08:56] continued on are you following me
[1:08:58] there was no pull in the people's hearts
[1:09:00] so that's why thank god
[1:09:02] you gotta thank god there's a pull thank
[1:09:04] god there's a there's a there's a deep
[1:09:06] calling to the deep
[1:09:07] hallelujah thank god these kisses he's
[1:09:10] calling us
[1:09:11] hallelujah but for the majority of the
[1:09:13] people in noah's day
[1:09:14] well everyone bar eight they just lived
[1:09:17] life
[1:09:18] they continued on they did all these
[1:09:21] things and they had no pull
[1:09:23] to get into the ark that's why i say
[1:09:26] thank you jesus
[1:09:28] you put something in me not in here but
[1:09:30] in here
[1:09:31] amen too to be drawn to you hallelujah
[1:09:35] hallelujah they they they had totally
[1:09:38] passed them by until the flood came and
[1:09:41] then he says there shall be two in the
[1:09:43] field
[1:09:44] one shall be taken and the other left
[1:09:46] two women shall be grinding at the mill
[1:09:48] and one shall be taken and the other
[1:09:50] left what's therefore for you know not
[1:09:53] what our your lord doth come
[1:09:56] so there's nothing wrong with working in
[1:09:58] the field right
[1:10:00] and we know grinding at the mill we know
[1:10:01] it used to be traditionally that women
[1:10:03] would take the grain
[1:10:04] they'd take it to the mill or get milled
[1:10:05] they'd take it home and they'd make
[1:10:06] bread
[1:10:08] right there's nothing wrong with getting
[1:10:09] food ready there's nothing wrong with
[1:10:10] working in the field
[1:10:12] it says that there'll be two in the bed
[1:10:13] one will be taken one will be left
[1:10:14] there's nothing wrong with sleeping
[1:10:16] but you notice that there's a great
[1:10:18] event that jesus is speaking of here
[1:10:21] one is ready the other is unready
[1:10:25] and as i think brother albert said on
[1:10:26] sunday they said just be two classes of
[1:10:28] people the saved and the lost
[1:10:30] doesn't matter what category have saved
[1:10:31] when you boil it down they're saved and
[1:10:33] lost
[1:10:34] and they'll come down to a day they'll
[1:10:35] be the taken in the left
[1:10:38] right we know sure the church is going
[1:10:40] to go through the tribulation
[1:10:42] people you know they will get salvation
[1:10:44] all those things but in reality
[1:10:46] there'll be the left and the taken both
[1:10:49] are living in the same world both are
[1:10:51] doing the same kind of jobs both
[1:10:53] you know living the same kind of life to
[1:10:54] a degree
[1:10:56] but want to be taken the other will be
[1:10:57] left now
[1:11:00] does this mean because you know
[1:11:03] we understand now i don't know exactly
[1:11:06] how this ties in how brother ram says
[1:11:08] speaking of matthew 27 how the dead in
[1:11:10] christ will rise and they'll be with us
[1:11:11] for 40 days beforehand i don't know how
[1:11:13] this ties in
[1:11:14] i believe we'll see them rise don't you
[1:11:17] because the scripture says they will
[1:11:18] rise first right
[1:11:19] but there'll come a time when when we
[1:11:22] will literally disappear
[1:11:24] you may be in a meeting at work you know
[1:11:26] because in a moment in a twinkling of an
[1:11:28] eye that's real quick
[1:11:30] and maybe you might be there sitting at
[1:11:32] your desk and then someone looks and
[1:11:33] they look again and you're gone
[1:11:35] and they don't know when do they step up
[1:11:37] and walk away you may be at school and
[1:11:39] the teacher goes to call your name out
[1:11:41] maybe calling the role and they say and
[1:11:42] then they call your name out
[1:11:44] and there's no response but but they saw
[1:11:47] you there before
[1:11:48] but now they're gone amen well what
[1:11:50] happened in a moment in a twinkling of
[1:11:52] an eye
[1:11:53] we will be changed we will be
[1:11:56] changed hallelujah
[1:12:00] so there's now that's what the apostle
[1:12:04] paul would say in first corinthians 15
[1:12:05] behold i show you a mystery we shall not
[1:12:07] all
[1:12:08] sleep but we shall all be changed in a
[1:12:11] moment in the twinkling of an eye
[1:12:12] the last trump for the trump shall sound
[1:12:14] and the dead in christ shall raise
[1:12:16] incorruptible and we
[1:12:17] shall be changed hallelujah
[1:12:20] i mean for this corruptable must put on
[1:12:23] incorruption this mortality must put on
[1:12:25] immortality i mean so when this couple
[1:12:28] shall put on incorruption and this
[1:12:30] mortal shall put on immortality
[1:12:32] then shall be put brought to pass the
[1:12:35] saying that is written
[1:12:36] death is swallowed up in victory
[1:12:38] hallelujah
[1:12:39] this scripture must be fulfilled i
[1:12:42] believe in a literal
[1:12:43] rapture translation of the church of the
[1:12:44] bride don't you
[1:12:46] amen so now but we understand that this
[1:12:49] will be a secret going
[1:12:51] right there'll be a moment in the
[1:12:54] twinkling of an eye
[1:12:55] the bride will be gone and the world
[1:12:59] will continue on
[1:13:00] just like in the days of noah they all
[1:13:02] got in the ark but everyone else just
[1:13:03] continued on
[1:13:04] maybe they saw the animals migrate i
[1:13:06] don't know how it worked it would have
[1:13:07] taken a long time for some animals to
[1:13:09] get to the ark maybe generations back
[1:13:11] they started migrating but eventually
[1:13:12] they got there
[1:13:15] hallelujah wouldn't that be an odd site
[1:13:17] you see some i don't know
[1:13:19] something from the other side of the
[1:13:20] world come here maybe just a land base
[1:13:22] like a little tortoise
[1:13:23] starting you know great great great
[1:13:25] granddad and grandma start walking
[1:13:28] but eventually they got there and maybe
[1:13:30] some people say oh that's interesting
[1:13:32] oh there must be climate change that's
[1:13:34] why they're migrating in this odd kind
[1:13:35] of way
[1:13:36] i don't know maybe something like this
[1:13:38] but they just saw isn't that odd
[1:13:40] and they continued on but for the bride
[1:13:42] of christ
[1:13:43] there's something he's put within us and
[1:13:45] i i don't think we can put enough value
[1:13:47] in the seat of predestination just to
[1:13:50] have a longing in your soul for him your
[1:13:52] blessed people
[1:13:54] hallelujah so it will be a secret
[1:13:57] catching away now
[1:13:58] we understand that this will not be the
[1:14:00] coming of the lord as
[1:14:02] in revelations one which says every eye
[1:14:04] shall see him when he cometh with clouds
[1:14:05] and every eye shall see him
[1:14:07] and they also who put pierced him and
[1:14:09] all the kindreds of the earth
[1:14:10] shall well because of him it's not that
[1:14:12] is that is after the rapture has
[1:14:13] happened
[1:14:14] right but this one is a secret catching
[1:14:17] away
[1:14:18] now the question is will this pass us by
[1:14:21] because maybe no doubt maybe a bit oh i
[1:14:23] pray not but a fear come into your heart
[1:14:25] oh
[1:14:25] if it's a secret one will i will i be
[1:14:27] ready i say if you know him
[1:14:30] amen you are ready
[1:14:33] let's go to first thessalonians chapter
[1:14:34] four i just wanna
[1:14:36] you know read this down and and and i
[1:14:39] have a purpose for saying all this we're
[1:14:40] going to get into the
[1:14:43] to the meat of it later but um
[1:14:47] because often we'll read the you know
[1:14:50] we'll we'll we'll go into
[1:14:53] first thessalonians chapter 4 and we
[1:14:55] will no doubt begin to
[1:14:57] read from verse verse 13 and
[1:15:00] and and we'll start from there he says
[1:15:03] but i would
[1:15:03] not have you to be ignorant brethren
[1:15:06] concerning them which are asleep
[1:15:08] that ye sorrow not even as others which
[1:15:12] have no hope
[1:15:13] for if we believe that jesus died and
[1:15:15] rose again even so them also which sleep
[1:15:17] in jesus will god bring with him
[1:15:20] for this we say unto you by the word of
[1:15:22] the lord
[1:15:23] that we which are alive and remain unto
[1:15:25] the coming of the lord shall not prevent
[1:15:26] them which are asleep
[1:15:28] for the lord himself shall descend from
[1:15:30] heaven with a shout
[1:15:31] and we've heard the shout have we not
[1:15:33] the message brother brahm says very
[1:15:35] clearly the message is the shout
[1:15:36] out hallelujah amen so i've heard the
[1:15:39] shout
[1:15:39] i mean with the voice of the archangel
[1:15:41] the trump of god and the dead in christ
[1:15:43] shall rise first
[1:15:44] then we which are alive and remain shall
[1:15:46] be caught up together with them in the
[1:15:47] clouds to meet the lord in the air
[1:15:49] so shall we ever be with the lord
[1:15:51] wherefore comfort one another with these
[1:15:53] words and many times we see the full
[1:15:55] stop and we stop reading
[1:15:56] but we must understand that the chapter
[1:15:58] and verses were put in later
[1:16:00] paul didn't put the chapter in verse and
[1:16:02] when he wrote this to the thessalonians
[1:16:04] someone did it later so if you if we
[1:16:06] keep reading
[1:16:07] we read uh chapter five and verse one
[1:16:10] but
[1:16:10] what's a but it's a conjunction tying
[1:16:12] what we just read to what we're about to
[1:16:14] read
[1:16:14] it says blood of the times and seasons
[1:16:16] brethren ye have no need that i write
[1:16:18] unto you
[1:16:19] for yourselves know perfectly that the
[1:16:21] day of the lord so cometh as a thief in
[1:16:24] the night
[1:16:24] so when they shall say peace and safety
[1:16:27] and what are we beginning to hear peace
[1:16:29] and safety amen then sudden destruction
[1:16:32] cometh upon them is travail upon a woman
[1:16:34] with child
[1:16:35] and they shall not escape but ye
[1:16:37] brethren are not in darkness
[1:16:40] who's in light today amen
[1:16:43] arise and shine for thy light has come
[1:16:45] and the glory of the lord risen upon you
[1:16:48] hallelujah to me that's more than uh
[1:16:50] yeah it's more i mean scripture is more
[1:16:51] than a scripture you understand but it's
[1:16:53] a reality
[1:16:53] that's more than a nice instagram post
[1:16:55] more than just a nice idea that's a
[1:16:57] reality
[1:16:58] i mean when this message came your way
[1:17:00] light came
[1:17:01] hallelujah and what did the lord tell
[1:17:03] you arise and shine
[1:17:04] i mean now is the time to arise why the
[1:17:07] sound of it going has come
[1:17:08] amen hallelujah amen
[1:17:13] ye are the children of the light and the
[1:17:16] children of the day we are not the
[1:17:18] of the night nor of darkness let us let
[1:17:21] therefore because of this therefore
[1:17:23] means let us not sleep as do others but
[1:17:25] let us watch and be sober
[1:17:27] for they which sleep sleep in the night
[1:17:29] and they that be drunk and are drunken
[1:17:31] in the night
[1:17:32] but let us of the day be sober
[1:17:34] putting on the breastplate of faith and
[1:17:36] love
[1:17:37] for and helmet the hope of salvation and
[1:17:39] we know
[1:17:40] the word hope in the bible is an
[1:17:41] expectation usually with pleasure is the
[1:17:43] meaning
[1:17:44] i mean says expectation of salvation for
[1:17:46] god hath not appointed
[1:17:48] us to wrath i like that don't you but to
[1:17:51] obtain salvation by
[1:17:53] our lord jesus christ who died for us
[1:17:57] that whether we wake or sleep we shall
[1:17:59] live together
[1:18:01] with him wherefore comfort yourselves
[1:18:03] together and edify
[1:18:05] one another even as also you do
[1:18:08] so he says this day won't overtake a
[1:18:10] people
[1:18:12] there is a people upon the earth this
[1:18:13] day will not pass them by
[1:18:15] like in the days of noah it will not
[1:18:17] just come and go and it was done
[1:18:19] but there's a people on the earth that
[1:18:20] will see it they'll become one with it
[1:18:23] and they'll be changed hallelujah
[1:18:24] they'll be changed by the power of god
[1:18:27] amen so now now you say well are you
[1:18:29] just sitting back
[1:18:30] and and waiting for your change to come
[1:18:32] yes and no
[1:18:35] no because i mean yes rather because i'm
[1:18:38] resting in the lord
[1:18:39] if you've received the holy ghost you've
[1:18:41] entered into rest
[1:18:42] but it's definitely a no because now is
[1:18:44] the time to fight
[1:18:46] right just like israel was instructed by
[1:18:48] god basically
[1:18:50] you go take the land i'll give it to you
[1:18:53] you're not going to take it but you're
[1:18:54] going to turn up you've got to get on
[1:18:56] the armor you've got to sharpen your
[1:18:58] sword you've got to turn up to the
[1:18:59] battle
[1:19:00] aliyah so so they didn't just sit in
[1:19:02] their camp in the wilderness or just
[1:19:04] over jordan they had to physically turn
[1:19:06] up to the battle
[1:19:07] and then god fought their battles sure
[1:19:09] they had to swing a sword a few times
[1:19:10] but it was an anointed swing
[1:19:12] i mean they had to hold up their shield
[1:19:13] a couple of times was an anointed
[1:19:15] holding of a shield
[1:19:16] highly assured they had to take some
[1:19:17] cities but it was anointed
[1:19:19] hallelujah was god fighting through them
[1:19:21] and it's the same thing with you and i
[1:19:23] now is the time i mean to stand up
[1:19:26] take god in his word like never before
[1:19:29] hallelujah and turn up to the battle
[1:19:31] well how do i turn up to the battle have
[1:19:33] a time of prayer
[1:19:35] battle's one in prayer oh read the word
[1:19:37] hallelujah
[1:19:38] be a witness amen this is how we should
[1:19:42] be
[1:19:42] why but but so so why is this because
[1:19:45] we have heard the sound of a going
[1:19:48] just like david was told wait here until
[1:19:51] you hear the sound of a going
[1:19:52] and then when you hear that sound rise
[1:19:54] up and fight
[1:19:57] hallelujah don't you agree we've heard
[1:19:58] the sound of a going this message is a
[1:20:00] leaving message
[1:20:02] it's the third exodus message from this
[1:20:05] world to the next world this is where
[1:20:07] it's going to take us
[1:20:08] hallelujah so now if we've heard the
[1:20:10] sound of a going
[1:20:12] hallelujah we've been called right we've
[1:20:14] been anointed
[1:20:16] have we not amen we've been sanctified
[1:20:19] we've been glorified
[1:20:20] amen well we shall be glorified right
[1:20:23] and the scripture says he that's called
[1:20:24] he's been sanctified and he has already
[1:20:26] been glorified
[1:20:28] we just got to catch up to that reality
[1:20:30] amen how's that going to happen the
[1:20:32] change of the body
[1:20:34] amen but so david had to wait for a
[1:20:37] season
[1:20:38] and then when he heard that sound he was
[1:20:40] up hallelujah
[1:20:42] remember he knew he knew it could be
[1:20:45] done because he's seen victory before
[1:20:47] he saw goliath go down he prophesied of
[1:20:49] his demise i'm going to cut your head
[1:20:51] off
[1:20:51] didn't have a sword but he used a glass
[1:20:54] own sword
[1:20:55] he'd seen the philistines be defeated
[1:20:57] before
[1:20:59] but he had to wait for this time so he
[1:21:01] knew it could be done
[1:21:02] just like the bride of christ we know it
[1:21:04] can be done we've seen a prophet
[1:21:06] we've seen god show the power of the
[1:21:08] cross in its fullness
[1:21:10] where no spirit could stand before him
[1:21:13] unbelief didn't stop him
[1:21:15] hallelujah he could speak things out of
[1:21:18] um out of existence into existence
[1:21:20] that was the power of the blood was
[1:21:21] demonstrated in a one-man ministry
[1:21:24] but now god wants to demonstrate that
[1:21:26] same power in a multi-membered body
[1:21:29] hallelujah so we know it can be done and
[1:21:32] not just back in 1965 but today
[1:21:34] i mean we've seen it be done but now is
[1:21:37] the time of the killing
[1:21:38] now is the time of total victory you may
[1:21:41] think i'm way up on a limb but this is
[1:21:43] where we are friends
[1:21:44] i mean i believe that we have heard a
[1:21:46] sound of a going
[1:21:47] now is the time to take the word like
[1:21:50] never before
[1:21:51] and oppress the battle
[1:21:54] hallelujah
[1:21:57] he would say in israel in the church
[1:21:59] part three this is in 1953 and brethren
[1:22:03] where all christendom is looking for the
[1:22:04] coming of the lord and the rapture of
[1:22:06] the church
[1:22:07] all that's got any knowledge of the word
[1:22:09] well if we can't have
[1:22:11] faith enough for divine healing how are
[1:22:13] we going to have a rapturing faith
[1:22:15] oh i believe there's a great coming
[1:22:17] forth remember because i didn't teach in
[1:22:18] divine healing before
[1:22:20] i believe as david said he laid there
[1:22:23] and waited until he listened and waited
[1:22:25] after a while he heard the rushing sound
[1:22:27] going through the mulberry trees
[1:22:29] going around he know god was going
[1:22:32] before him oh brother
[1:22:33] i'm listening for the rushing of the
[1:22:35] leaves the sound
[1:22:37] uh the noise of the mulberry bushes gods
[1:22:39] going before the battle
[1:22:41] then let's rise and put on the full
[1:22:42] armor of god
[1:22:44] pull the sword go after it the battle
[1:22:46] belongs to us
[1:22:47] then when we see the hand of god moving
[1:22:50] on through signs and wonders
[1:22:52] let's start following on and we've seen
[1:22:54] god in signs and wonders
[1:22:56] so let's start following on hallelujah
[1:23:01] amen he'd say this in the contest and
[1:23:03] this is why i actually
[1:23:04] had this plate on wednesday i feel
[1:23:07] tonight as we're listening for them
[1:23:09] whistles something like david did that
[1:23:11] dreadful hot night when he laid out
[1:23:13] there under their mulberry bushes
[1:23:15] and the enemy was around thing what an
[1:23:17] hour it must have been for david what a
[1:23:18] time for him laying there
[1:23:20] he didn't know how to move he didn't
[1:23:21] know what to go by
[1:23:23] because he knowed he was outnumbered but
[1:23:25] all at once he heard the sound of a wind
[1:23:28] going through the top of the bushes
[1:23:29] he knowed god went on before him he went
[1:23:32] fought he went to the battle
[1:23:34] i feel something like that tonight after
[1:23:36] last night's message
[1:23:38] i'm laying in the darkest hour i've ever
[1:23:40] faced in my life
[1:23:41] i feel like isaiah at the temple seeing
[1:23:43] those angels i'm a man of unclean lips
[1:23:45] dwelling
[1:23:46] among people with unclean lips but
[1:23:48] listen i've got to meet it some way and
[1:23:50] the only thing i'm waiting
[1:23:52] to hear that rushing through the
[1:23:53] mulberry bushes
[1:23:55] to go and meet the enemy wherever it is
[1:23:57] god help us to do it
[1:23:59] i believe we're living in this time
[1:24:03] now you think when the spirit of god
[1:24:04] moves the devil's always there to block
[1:24:06] it
[1:24:07] the devil doesn't like to see god moving
[1:24:09] to people he's forwarded it all the way
[1:24:11] from eden all the way down here
[1:24:13] and he's not going to stop fighting it
[1:24:15] until he's cast the lake of fire
[1:24:17] but we must understand that we face a
[1:24:19] defeated being
[1:24:21] remember we face a defeated being my
[1:24:23] lord jesus defeated him on calvary
[1:24:25] he went down to hell took the keys off
[1:24:27] of satan of hell death in the grave
[1:24:29] and rose triumphant and he's still
[1:24:31] triumphant today
[1:24:33] he's still the same powerful god he is
[1:24:35] what then he is now
[1:24:36] amen we don't have to fear nothing
[1:24:38] member of our god if god is for us who
[1:24:40] can be against us
[1:24:42] right if he is for me who can be against
[1:24:44] me sure we have my you know i've got
[1:24:46] failures
[1:24:46] and weaknesses and humanity whatever
[1:24:48] more but if he is for me
[1:24:50] what can be against me hallelujah
[1:24:54] i believe the apostle paul had
[1:24:55] experience when he wrote that he had
[1:24:56] opposition
[1:24:57] he had religious spirits come against
[1:24:59] him he had he had unbelief he had all
[1:25:01] kinds of things but he could stand and
[1:25:02] say if god is for us
[1:25:04] who can be against us amen if the first
[1:25:06] church came in that way the last church
[1:25:08] would go out the same way
[1:25:10] hallelujah why because we've heard a
[1:25:11] sound of a going
[1:25:13] on now as i said when the spirit of god
[1:25:16] blows into a place
[1:25:17] the devil is there to stop the
[1:25:19] visitation now when moses was sent down
[1:25:22] to egypt
[1:25:23] here he was he knew that he was born for
[1:25:26] the job
[1:25:27] but in his own humanity all he could
[1:25:30] muster up was one dead egyptian
[1:25:32] and so he went on to the back side of
[1:25:34] the desert because really
[1:25:35] they had to come the right time he
[1:25:38] thought it was the right time but god
[1:25:39] had his own time
[1:25:41] and so finally he was there 80 years old
[1:25:44] leading his father-in-law sheep on the
[1:25:46] back side of the desert
[1:25:48] and then the lord came hallelujah into
[1:25:50] that burning as a burning bush and spoke
[1:25:52] to moses
[1:25:53] he said i've heard the cries of my
[1:25:54] people i've come down to deliver them so
[1:25:56] he's basically saying i'm coming to take
[1:25:58] them out of here but i'm sending you to
[1:26:00] do the job
[1:26:01] amen and now the first thing that moses
[1:26:03] was given now
[1:26:04] is is that shepherd stuff that he held
[1:26:07] which was just a dead stick
[1:26:09] until it came into the prince of god god
[1:26:12] told him now throw it down and it turned
[1:26:14] into a serpent
[1:26:15] hallelujah and then so and so he ran
[1:26:17] away from it was scared but then god
[1:26:19] told him to pick it up by the tail it
[1:26:20] became that same rod
[1:26:22] and then he was also told put your hand
[1:26:24] into your bosom and be leprous bring it
[1:26:26] out
[1:26:26] amen it's a showing now we know leprosy
[1:26:29] is a type of sin
[1:26:31] saying saying that you will have power
[1:26:32] actually take sin to your bosom
[1:26:35] remember he's a four forerunner of jesus
[1:26:38] christ the shout out of jesus christ
[1:26:39] you'll be able to like sit into your
[1:26:40] bosom
[1:26:41] and bring it out it'll be gone amen but
[1:26:44] he had that power remember
[1:26:45] god gives signs in certain ways to prove
[1:26:48] to the devil
[1:26:50] you're not the boss here boy you're not
[1:26:52] in charge here you think you
[1:26:54] are but you are not the head manager of
[1:26:55] this place i'm in charge
[1:26:58] now we know he was given that rod in
[1:27:00] that way because remember
[1:27:01] pharaoh was considered a god in egypt he
[1:27:04] wasn't just an elected official
[1:27:06] no he actually believed and it was
[1:27:08] projected to the population
[1:27:10] this is your god made flesh is fairer
[1:27:12] and we know on his on his crown there
[1:27:14] was there
[1:27:15] was there was a cobra there was the king
[1:27:18] of the serpents
[1:27:19] and then so now when moses went down
[1:27:21] into egypt and
[1:27:22] and he said let my people go and god was
[1:27:25] speaking through a man
[1:27:26] amen two two two pharaoh then then he
[1:27:29] says well
[1:27:30] who is this jehovah and then moses tells
[1:27:33] aaron i think it was just a throw down
[1:27:35] the rod
[1:27:36] and it turned into a serpent and then
[1:27:38] pharaoh wasn't too impressed by that he
[1:27:40] got his magicians to do the same thing
[1:27:41] but then
[1:27:42] the amazing thing is that that moses rod
[1:27:45] ate their rods
[1:27:47] and then after it was picked up as a rod
[1:27:48] again where did they go
[1:27:51] they didn't get their sticks back
[1:27:52] because they got eaten so their
[1:27:54] their demon power their power was
[1:27:56] swallowed up by the power of god
[1:27:58] and also god was telling moses
[1:28:01] actually you have the power to lose
[1:28:03] pharaoh that he becomes a serpent or to
[1:28:05] bind them
[1:28:06] you have the power in your hand to loose
[1:28:08] them or to bind them
[1:28:09] whatever pleases you you can lose them
[1:28:12] you combine them
[1:28:13] and he was also showing the devil devil
[1:28:14] my servant who's been commissioned by me
[1:28:17] to bring my people out can loose you or
[1:28:19] let you go can bind you or loose you or
[1:28:21] bind you
[1:28:22] whenever it pleases him he can he'll
[1:28:24] bind you or loose you
[1:28:26] hallelujah now we know he did that he
[1:28:28] brought the people out a one-man
[1:28:30] invasion eighty-year-old man two
[1:28:32] youngins on his
[1:28:33] wife's hip on the back of a mule going
[1:28:34] down into egypt you know
[1:28:36] you know comes to the customs gate there
[1:28:38] and going down to gaza wherever it is
[1:28:40] what's your purpose of visit
[1:28:42] can't tick holiday can't take business
[1:28:46] yo other invasion
[1:28:50] gives it to the gives it to the customs
[1:28:52] guy maybe just stamped it have a nice
[1:28:55] day okay
[1:28:56] when's your departure date uh soon as
[1:28:58] possible yeah do you have a return
[1:29:00] ticket
[1:29:00] no but i'll you'll see me soon
[1:29:03] hallelujah
[1:29:04] but the thing is he did it he did it one
[1:29:06] man
[1:29:07] went into the superpower of the world
[1:29:08] and took out hallelujah nothing could
[1:29:11] stop
[1:29:12] israel leaving because there was a man
[1:29:15] that was anointed
[1:29:16] commissioned sent hallelujah with the
[1:29:19] power of deliverance
[1:29:20] into a country to bring out them
[1:29:22] hallelujah bring israel out now remember
[1:29:24] that was just
[1:29:25] from a natural deliverance remember that
[1:29:27] was just from a natural bondage into a
[1:29:29] natural freedom
[1:29:31] but we know that as i said that the
[1:29:32] so-so he was a serpent bruiser right he
[1:29:34] was a serpent bruiser
[1:29:36] no doubt the reason that pharaoh would
[1:29:38] have
[1:29:39] you know um uh pharaoh would be inspired
[1:29:42] to throw all the little
[1:29:43] israeli boys into the nile is because
[1:29:47] because the devil was afraid that that
[1:29:50] seat of the woman
[1:29:51] was going to come into that kingdom and
[1:29:53] crush the head of the seat of the
[1:29:54] serpent
[1:29:55] he was afraid and that's why he tried to
[1:29:57] get rid of the serpent bruiser
[1:29:58] but it's amazing how god could
[1:30:00] orchestrate things he he actually had
[1:30:02] that serpent bruiser raised up in the
[1:30:04] palace of pharaoh
[1:30:06] he was on the outskirts of the place he
[1:30:07] was in the inner sanctuary
[1:30:10] of the serpent himself and he was raised
[1:30:12] that way hallelujah he was protected
[1:30:14] he was nourished but his whole purpose
[1:30:16] of his life was to tear that kingdom
[1:30:18] down
[1:30:19] hallelujah and you may have been raised
[1:30:21] in this world hallelujah rise under
[1:30:23] satan's kingdom under his power
[1:30:25] amen but you're here i mean to tear
[1:30:27] satan's kingdom down
[1:30:29] now i'm not talking about tearing down
[1:30:31] bricks and mortar and government i'm
[1:30:33] talking about demon
[1:30:34] powers in the hearts of men and women
[1:30:36] tearing that kingdom down this is why we
[1:30:38] are here today
[1:30:40] hallelujah amen so jesus we know was
[1:30:43] that
[1:30:44] as as moses was a shadow of jesus now
[1:30:46] jesus was that serpent bruiser
[1:30:48] hallelujah because he didn't just
[1:30:49] deliver a people from a natural slavery
[1:30:52] oh hallelujah buddy buddy he broke the
[1:30:55] power of hell
[1:30:57] brother abraham said that the devil
[1:30:59] after calvary is like a dog with an
[1:31:01] animal with a broken back
[1:31:03] hallelujah why because his power was
[1:31:05] defeated there and his power is still
[1:31:07] defeated today
[1:31:09] hallelujah he didn't just naturally
[1:31:11] deliver us
[1:31:12] but he delivered us from unbelief from
[1:31:14] the power of hell hallelujah i'd love to
[1:31:16] read ephesians chapter two where once we
[1:31:19] you had the quickened who was dead and
[1:31:22] trespassed and sins who used to walk
[1:31:23] according to the
[1:31:24] spirit of this world the prince of the
[1:31:26] power of the air hallelujah but now
[1:31:28] you've been made alive
[1:31:30] and i can read that and say lord you've
[1:31:31] done that for me i once walked according
[1:31:34] to the spirit of this world but lord you
[1:31:36] did something to me one day you changed
[1:31:37] my nature
[1:31:39] now i walk according to your anointing
[1:31:41] amen
[1:31:42] hallelujah so moses now
[1:31:45] went down into egypt if the egyptians
[1:31:49] could have just got that rod out of his
[1:31:51] hand
[1:31:52] he would have been powerless brother i
[1:31:54] was saying israel
[1:31:55] the church he says and god said speak to
[1:31:58] the rock or bring forth its waters and
[1:31:59] when he spoke to the rock
[1:32:01] now he took first and smoked that rock
[1:32:03] with a rod
[1:32:04] and when he smote that rock that rod was
[1:32:07] god's judgment rod
[1:32:09] it wasn't a rod of moses god had moses
[1:32:12] in his hand
[1:32:13] and what that rod was in moses hand
[1:32:16] is jesus name in the church today that's
[1:32:19] right that's the truth brother if those
[1:32:21] egyptians could have ever got that rod
[1:32:23] out of his hand
[1:32:24] he was powerless if they can ever take
[1:32:27] the name of jesus away from the church
[1:32:29] and get you away you'll go out and bless
[1:32:32] fema to make fun of it and everything
[1:32:33] else and try to come in and pray in it
[1:32:35] you can't do that got to keep it sacred
[1:32:38] that's right
[1:32:40] oh take the name of jesus with you child
[1:32:42] of sorrow and of woe
[1:32:44] when temptations round you gather
[1:32:46] breathe that holy name and prayer devils
[1:32:47] will scatter like roaches
[1:32:49] on a floor when a light's turned on
[1:32:51] truly
[1:32:53] hallelujah sorry so if they could just
[1:32:54] get that rod out of moses hand he would
[1:32:56] have been just like any other 80 year
[1:32:58] old man
[1:32:59] but that rod was a rod of judgment for
[1:33:01] for the egyptians but a lot of
[1:33:03] deliverance for israel
[1:33:05] hallelujah and it's the same thing with
[1:33:06] you and i the name of jesus christ
[1:33:09] there's power in that name where the
[1:33:11] bride knows the power of that name
[1:33:13] amen there's power in that name to
[1:33:15] forgive sin
[1:33:16] right there's power in that name to cast
[1:33:18] out the devil there's a power of that
[1:33:20] name to heal all sickness
[1:33:21] there's that power in that name to
[1:33:22] change the body of the people i mean to
[1:33:24] take us in a rapture i mean there's
[1:33:26] power in that name to overcome
[1:33:27] every situation highly so if that name
[1:33:30] is in our not just in our hand but in
[1:33:32] our mouth hallelujah
[1:33:33] i mean there's nothing that will stand
[1:33:35] before us though everything will try and
[1:33:37] stand before us
[1:33:38] are you following me this morning now so
[1:33:41] we
[1:33:41] if moses met the burning bush he met the
[1:33:44] pillow fire in the burning bush he was
[1:33:46] commissioned
[1:33:47] go down and deliver my people hallelujah
[1:33:50] we have received that same kind of
[1:33:52] commission amen we've received that same
[1:33:54] kind of commission
[1:33:55] amen who's met the holy ghost who's met
[1:33:57] the pillar of fire on this day
[1:33:59] highly so you don't just meet him for
[1:34:01] now you can stand back and say well i
[1:34:03] met god one day no he commissions you to
[1:34:05] do a job
[1:34:06] and he anoints you to do the job i
[1:34:08] remember it wasn't moses natural
[1:34:10] strength that got the people out of
[1:34:12] egypt it was god's power in his life
[1:34:14] that caused the deliverance and it's the
[1:34:16] same thing with you and i it's not our
[1:34:18] natural ability
[1:34:19] it's not how smart we are how
[1:34:20] charismatic we may be however gifted
[1:34:23] whatever whatever that stuff is
[1:34:24] it's not that it's the anointing of the
[1:34:27] word
[1:34:27] in our lives amen will bring the
[1:34:29] deliverance so now
[1:34:30] if you just think about this moses went
[1:34:33] into the throne room
[1:34:34] of the of of pharaoh himself
[1:34:38] told him let my people go he wasn't
[1:34:41] bashful about it
[1:34:42] he didn't compromise about it we're not
[1:34:44] going to leave one hoof behind
[1:34:46] the devil your pharaoh tried to
[1:34:47] negotiate well you can just have this
[1:34:49] and then
[1:34:49] you stay here these ones stay here and
[1:34:51] you take this and you know
[1:34:53] but he was like no no no no this is not
[1:34:54] how this works
[1:34:56] you well i've not come to negotiate i'm
[1:34:58] here to take what is mine and take it
[1:35:00] out of here
[1:35:01] and it should be the same thing with you
[1:35:03] and i we're not here to negotiate with
[1:35:05] the devil
[1:35:06] we're not here to put up with his
[1:35:07] nonsense and give a little bit of a room
[1:35:09] no no
[1:35:09] we've come to take everything that is
[1:35:12] ours hallelujah we've come
[1:35:14] all of our children all of our loved
[1:35:16] ones all of our friends whoever it may
[1:35:18] be that the lord needs you to pray for
[1:35:20] hollywood they are the reason he puts
[1:35:22] them on your heart is because god wants
[1:35:24] you to say
[1:35:25] god wants to use your life to get them
[1:35:28] out
[1:35:30] oh what if they're not meant to be there
[1:35:32] listen
[1:35:33] we got to get this out of our mind or
[1:35:35] maybe they're just not bright
[1:35:38] forget about it forget about categories
[1:35:40] of salvation if they meet god
[1:35:42] hallelujah sure they might not call to
[1:35:46] but you know to receive the message
[1:35:48] don't throw them away
[1:35:50] hallelujah hey if i can help someone
[1:35:53] just come one step up the ladder
[1:35:55] praise god they may not come up all the
[1:35:58] way that's fine but if they come up just
[1:35:59] one step
[1:36:01] if we can be a be such a witness to
[1:36:03] people that they just take one step
[1:36:04] closer to god i think well praise the
[1:36:06] lord
[1:36:07] that was a that was worth it so don't
[1:36:09] worry about in and out
[1:36:11] category whatever god will sort the
[1:36:13] category he's the category sorter
[1:36:15] harley he's the one who's don't worry
[1:36:17] about that kind of thing just say
[1:36:19] you know we should never ever get in our
[1:36:22] mind
[1:36:23] that person serpent seed or whatever
[1:36:26] let's just let's just kick that out the
[1:36:27] door
[1:36:28] oh but they never really responded
[1:36:30] there's nothing in them the apostle paul
[1:36:33] before he became paul he was quite a
[1:36:35] character
[1:36:36] he was a dedicated destroyer of
[1:36:39] christians
[1:36:40] he wasn't a part-time just a angry
[1:36:42] comment here and there
[1:36:43] his whole energies his whole energies
[1:36:46] was i'm going to destroy this thing
[1:36:48] i'm going to stop it spreading us like a
[1:36:50] cancer and if we looked at saul before
[1:36:52] it became paul
[1:36:53] oh boy this guy he's blasphemed he's
[1:36:56] crossed the line
[1:36:57] he's done he's gone too far but god said
[1:37:00] oh no no no no
[1:37:01] i'm gonna show you you can't put me in a
[1:37:04] box of who i can save i'm gonna take
[1:37:06] someone outside that parameter
[1:37:08] and bring them in and not just that but
[1:37:10] they're gonna be my prophet messenger
[1:37:12] for this age
[1:37:14] hallelujah so we can never just say well
[1:37:16] uh let's just you know
[1:37:19] never put a full stop remember god has
[1:37:21] the last say
[1:37:23] hallelujah so moses was commissioned to
[1:37:26] go right into the face of pharaoh
[1:37:29] and say let my people go
[1:37:32] now as i said we're not here to deliver
[1:37:35] people
[1:37:35] from physical slavery and take them to
[1:37:37] another piece of real estate
[1:37:39] that's not our deliverance our
[1:37:41] deliverance is that
[1:37:42] the satan would be dethroned from their
[1:37:44] lives and they would come and meet the
[1:37:46] lord
[1:37:47] right that is that is the deliverance we
[1:37:49] want from unbelief to faith
[1:37:51] hallelujah this is what we want to see
[1:37:52] so we have a right you think about it
[1:37:55] moses was commissioned go and tell
[1:37:57] pharaoh let my people go
[1:37:59] that's very elementary no it's very
[1:38:01] powerful he went in there
[1:38:03] and he got what was his right we have
[1:38:06] the right to go before satan
[1:38:08] let my people go
[1:38:10] [Applause]
[1:38:11] let them go let my boy go let my girl go
[1:38:14] let my brothers go let my sisters go
[1:38:16] let this one go let them go remember
[1:38:20] i think i think brother-in-law brought
[1:38:21] the quote up from them
[1:38:23] i can't remember what sermon it is but
[1:38:25] we our total deliverance
[1:38:26] we can pray in such a way till the devil
[1:38:28] has to give him
[1:38:30] till he has to give him amen hallelujah
[1:38:32] you know the
[1:38:33] you know the disciples were having a
[1:38:34] prayer meeting
[1:38:36] one of them was in the inner prison he
[1:38:38] was under a death sentence
[1:38:40] hallelujah herod wanted peter's head
[1:38:44] to be taken from his shoulders amen
[1:38:47] did they just say well i guess that's
[1:38:49] just how it has to be
[1:38:51] well i guess this is just the natural
[1:38:52] course of life you know the there's no
[1:38:54] no no
[1:38:54] they prayed they prayed
[1:38:58] and when they could not physically go
[1:38:59] into the prison god sent his angel down
[1:39:02] into the prison
[1:39:03] and brought him out of the prison hell
[1:39:05] is the same thing with you and i you may
[1:39:06] physically not be able to reach someone
[1:39:08] but god can reach them and he's the one
[1:39:10] we want to reach them anyway
[1:39:13] hallelujah i believe we can pray in such
[1:39:16] a way till the devil has to give him
[1:39:18] i believe we have it hey if moses could
[1:39:21] go before pharaoh
[1:39:22] negotiations took place and now i'm just
[1:39:24] going to plague you
[1:39:26] i'm going to plague your kingdom until
[1:39:28] you'll be happy i'm gone
[1:39:30] hallelujah and they were happy that
[1:39:32] night of the exodus
[1:39:34] when their firstborn were dead they were
[1:39:35] weeping for their firstborn the angel of
[1:39:37] death had come through the land
[1:39:39] hallelujah they gave their gold and
[1:39:41] their silver and all their
[1:39:42] precious things to the to to to israel
[1:39:44] get out of here
[1:39:46] leave go and they breathe the sigh of
[1:39:48] relief
[1:39:49] i'm so glad those people have gone you
[1:39:52] know i pray
[1:39:54] when there's when that moment happens
[1:39:55] and we're changed
[1:39:57] that the devil would say i'm go i'm so
[1:39:59] glad that brother's god i'm so glad that
[1:40:01] sister's gone
[1:40:01] i'm so glad that church is no longer
[1:40:03] here i've i can breathe a sigh of relief
[1:40:06] you know how many beatings i took when i
[1:40:08] tried to come against those people
[1:40:09] i came this way and he beat me down i
[1:40:11] came this way she beat me down
[1:40:13] i've just been under their feet and
[1:40:14] finally oh i can breathe a sigh of
[1:40:16] relief why
[1:40:17] because they've left i pray
[1:40:21] that that is that's our testimony down
[1:40:24] in hell
[1:40:25] doesn't matter how small we are how big
[1:40:27] we are how long we've been in the faith
[1:40:29] i pray the devil quivers
[1:40:32] when your alarm goes
[1:40:36] and you kind of get the matter out of
[1:40:37] your eye and you know
[1:40:39] i think it's before 40 you start doing
[1:40:41] weight lifting when you stand up and
[1:40:43] you know and there's whatever pulled
[1:40:46] stuff and you know you pull muscles just
[1:40:47] by waking up in the morning and
[1:40:49] you know but the devil is like panic
[1:40:51] stations in hell what's going to happen
[1:40:53] today what's going to happen
[1:40:55] and he tries to sit you know he tries to
[1:40:56] send one to you go deal with someone no
[1:40:58] no i'm not going there
[1:40:59] today i'm still recovering from the last
[1:41:02] beating i got from that one
[1:41:03] and try seeing another one no i'm not
[1:41:04] going there they have a squabble who's
[1:41:06] going to try and take you out
[1:41:08] hallelujah i pray that's how it is
[1:41:12] amen because we're a generation of
[1:41:14] serpent bruisers
[1:41:15] i'm talking about the devil that serpent
[1:41:18] i mean we have
[1:41:19] power brother ram says you know he was
[1:41:21] he saw the vision of the mamba
[1:41:24] and he was told you've got to be more
[1:41:26] sincere
[1:41:28] to do this it's his attitude with the
[1:41:30] word
[1:41:31] remember that power didn't just lay with
[1:41:33] the prophet
[1:41:34] that was demonstrated to show an end
[1:41:36] time people
[1:41:37] after the prophet had gone off the scene
[1:41:40] you have been given
[1:41:41] power to bind the devil
[1:41:44] and all the devils under him
[1:41:48] you can bind them you can loose them you
[1:41:50] can bind them
[1:41:51] you can loose them oh my
[1:41:55] yeah and brother just said lord forgive
[1:41:58] me in my own sincerity help me to be
[1:42:00] more sincere
[1:42:01] i believe the lord will give it to us
[1:42:04] it's not us trying to be more sincere in
[1:42:05] our humanity you know
[1:42:07] it's when the lord moves on our hearts
[1:42:08] remember he's the one that makes us
[1:42:10] humble
[1:42:10] he's the one that makes us sincere and i
[1:42:13] love it when we just put a foot out of
[1:42:14] joint he just brings us back
[1:42:17] he may tear stripes off our hide give us
[1:42:20] a big box slow but hey
[1:42:22] it's good
[1:42:26] hallelujah but we have the power you
[1:42:28] know think about that the lord has given
[1:42:30] us the authority over the devil
[1:42:32] remember the devil all he is is a fired
[1:42:34] servant
[1:42:36] angels were never part of the family of
[1:42:38] god
[1:42:39] they were created as servants right
[1:42:43] now when you hire someone if they go
[1:42:45] beyond their job description
[1:42:47] in a bad way they get fired and the
[1:42:51] devil went beyond his job description
[1:42:53] he had a job in heaven right he was to
[1:42:56] lead the worship to all those kinds of
[1:42:57] things
[1:42:58] but he went beyond his job description
[1:43:00] saying i can build a better kingdom
[1:43:02] and what happened he got fired so now
[1:43:06] this one that we are fighting remember
[1:43:10] servants can never become the family of
[1:43:12] the king
[1:43:13] his life is not in a servant right it's
[1:43:16] like my children are mine they're part
[1:43:17] of me
[1:43:18] i could hire someone to do something but
[1:43:20] they will never become my family
[1:43:23] because my blood is not in their veins
[1:43:25] my blood is in my children's veins
[1:43:27] only because they're part of me
[1:43:29] hallelujah same thing with you and i
[1:43:32] amen with the lord jesus hallelujah
[1:43:35] amen his royal blood now flows through
[1:43:37] our veins amen there's a seed of
[1:43:39] predestination on the inside of the
[1:43:41] inside of us and that was his own life
[1:43:44] amen amen you know i love it where
[1:43:47] where where where the name of jesus is
[1:43:50] first spoken
[1:43:51] by by gabriel he says you shall call his
[1:43:54] name jesus for he shall save his people
[1:43:57] from their sins
[1:43:58] he's going to find his people amen and
[1:44:01] they are relatives they're
[1:44:02] he's our close kinsmen hey man we're
[1:44:04] family
[1:44:06] harley we have a family gathering you
[1:44:08] know
[1:44:09] a lot of people cringe with family
[1:44:10] reunions i love this kind of family
[1:44:12] reunion
[1:44:13] hallelujah i get to see uncle shawn so
[1:44:15] auntie sanzo brother sanzo says
[1:44:17] yo it's great hallelujah it's not a
[1:44:19] cringe oh
[1:44:20] yeah that's wonderful because it's
[1:44:22] family hallelujah
[1:44:26] so an angel can never come a servant can
[1:44:28] never come as high as the family of the
[1:44:30] king
[1:44:30] because they're servants so now the
[1:44:33] devil was a servant but he got fired
[1:44:36] and now this fired servant expects
[1:44:39] us to bow down to him but he's got the
[1:44:43] hierarchy all wrong remember it's the
[1:44:45] king and his family
[1:44:46] then the servants it's not the servants
[1:44:50] then the king and his family that is not
[1:44:52] how it works it's the king and his
[1:44:53] family
[1:44:54] hello brian and you just think about it
[1:44:56] more a husband and a wife are one
[1:44:59] not children they are one join heirs
[1:45:02] with christ
[1:45:03] has we're not under the king he's lifted
[1:45:05] us up
[1:45:06] to be joint heirs with him isn't that
[1:45:08] wonderful
[1:45:09] hallelujah it's us and the lord co-equal
[1:45:12] because he lifted us up to where he is
[1:45:14] and then there's the servants underneath
[1:45:17] and then there's the fire servants under
[1:45:18] that
[1:45:19] and so the devil being a fired servant
[1:45:21] and and all of his
[1:45:22] are you following me we gotta we gotta
[1:45:24] really think who are we fighting
[1:45:27] we're fighting a guy who got fired
[1:45:30] and and and somehow he had a you know
[1:45:33] obviously that he had a team building
[1:45:35] exercise and all it was is to gather
[1:45:37] people to his own self they got fired
[1:45:40] too
[1:45:41] you listen to the wrong boss he got
[1:45:44] fired so he got fired
[1:45:45] so now there's these people who got
[1:45:47] devils who got fired
[1:45:48] and they think that we have to serve
[1:45:50] them
[1:45:53] that picture is all wrong but god said
[1:45:56] we'll be the head and not the tail
[1:45:59] holy we will be the head and not the
[1:46:00] tail we will not be under the devil's
[1:46:02] feet
[1:46:03] but the devil's ordained position is
[1:46:06] under the feet of the bride of jesus
[1:46:08] christ
[1:46:08] that's his god-given position
[1:46:12] god has given us a different position
[1:46:14] it's not under the devil's feet
[1:46:16] amen is to be joint is with christ in
[1:46:18] god
[1:46:19] hallelujah so the devil comes your way
[1:46:22] and tries to get you to do all kinds of
[1:46:23] things
[1:46:24] hold on hold on
[1:46:27] you have to obey me i don't have to obey
[1:46:31] you hallelujah and he looks at you says
[1:46:34] no no i'm going to get you to do
[1:46:36] what you used to do but something
[1:46:38] happened to you remember once upon a
[1:46:40] time
[1:46:40] when the enemy came up to eat up my
[1:46:42] flesh psalms 27 i
[1:46:44] you know it says when the enemy came
[1:46:45] against me to earn my flesh they
[1:46:47] stumbled and fell
[1:46:48] but there came a time before that when
[1:46:51] the enemy came up against me i stumbled
[1:46:53] and fell
[1:46:54] hallelujah there was a change there was
[1:46:56] a change of who was actually in charge
[1:46:59] now it's the law that's in charge i mean
[1:47:01] so when the enemy comes against the
[1:47:02] bride
[1:47:03] he stumbles and falls hallelujah
[1:47:07] so if that is the case now we have the
[1:47:09] right
[1:47:11] by the name of jesus christ to tell the
[1:47:13] devil you've got to take your filthy
[1:47:15] hands off god's property
[1:47:17] how many times did the prophet address
[1:47:19] satan and say take your hands off god's
[1:47:21] property
[1:47:23] hallelujah he said i don't know if
[1:47:25] they're one of his
[1:47:26] forget that kind of reasoning remember
[1:47:29] when moses went down into egypt there
[1:47:32] are all kinds of
[1:47:33] israelis there there are the strong
[1:47:35] they're the weak the old the young
[1:47:38] he didn't have a guest list he just said
[1:47:39] if you're a son of abraham come
[1:47:42] hallelujah so he wasn't weeding out
[1:47:46] anyone he just said if you want to come
[1:47:48] you come and a mixed multitude went with
[1:47:50] them
[1:47:50] so whosoever will let them come you can
[1:47:53] do that with what you want to but
[1:47:55] you know don't put anyone in a box and
[1:47:57] don't put god in a box
[1:48:00] amen in the prince of god unrecognized
[1:48:02] he says you know there's so many people
[1:48:04] disappear
[1:48:04] every day off the face of the earth that
[1:48:06] nobody can account for one of these days
[1:48:08] it might be that people might say well
[1:48:11] you mean the tribulation the thing
[1:48:12] that's on us now i thought the church
[1:48:14] was to go before the tribulation
[1:48:16] they don't realize that and understand
[1:48:18] that the rapture could take place and
[1:48:20] they
[1:48:20] would know nothing about it it's the
[1:48:22] secret going of the church
[1:48:25] hallelujah he says this isn't calling
[1:48:28] jesus on the scene in 1964 market in
[1:48:30] your book i'm an old man but just mark
[1:48:32] it in your book and see if it comes to
[1:48:34] pass or not
[1:48:35] see we're at the end now when i don't
[1:48:37] know i'm looking for him today if he
[1:48:39] isn't here today i'm looking for him
[1:48:41] tomorrow
[1:48:42] if he isn't here tomorrow i'll be
[1:48:43] looking the next day
[1:48:45] amen if he isn't here this year i'll be
[1:48:47] looking for him next year
[1:48:49] i know he is coming i don't know the
[1:48:51] minute or the hour but i know
[1:48:53] everything is fulfilled ready for the
[1:48:55] rapture
[1:48:56] the church is called out it's a secret
[1:48:58] going
[1:48:59] just vanish and that'll be all
[1:49:02] he says hallelujah
[1:49:07] now
[1:49:11] i'll just i'm just going to wrap this up
[1:49:14] the devil has come
[1:49:17] has not cometh not but for to steal to
[1:49:20] kill and to destroy
[1:49:22] right jesus says i have come that they
[1:49:24] might have life and they might have it
[1:49:26] more abundantly
[1:49:29] the enemy the philistines the
[1:49:31] philistines
[1:49:32] are nothing but robbers
[1:49:35] he says in witnesses in 1954 that's the
[1:49:37] way it is every time
[1:49:39] god get a good meeting started somewhere
[1:49:42] here some old hypocrite will come in and
[1:49:43] say the days of miracles has passed
[1:49:45] might as well stop this that's the devil
[1:49:48] that's right
[1:49:48] about time you get the church going good
[1:49:51] somebody's slipping
[1:49:53] saying now that's just all enthusiasm
[1:49:56] has just worked up that's fanaticism
[1:49:58] that's the way they do it
[1:49:59] same old robbers old philistines
[1:50:02] coming right back he says that's exactly
[1:50:04] right we must never let that kind of
[1:50:06] spirit come in our midst

[1:51:34] fallen
[1:51:36] man who they claim is born again and
[1:51:38] they are putting all their hopes in him
[1:51:41] why is that because there they have
[1:51:43] taken their focus off the only one that
[1:51:46] can really help them
[1:51:47] which is the lord jesus christ and
[1:51:49] they're fallen down from the spirit of
[1:51:51] god
[1:51:51] moving like it used to and they're
[1:51:53] trying to jack up some political racket
[1:51:55] amen that they can somehow christianize
[1:51:57] america once again
[1:51:59] by some political process they have
[1:52:02] their anointed man

[1:52:08] earth is the man christ jesus
[1:52:10] that is our anointed superman hallelujah
[1:52:14] that is the one that we have crowned
[1:52:15] kings
[1:52:17] in our lives i sure will crown him king
[1:52:19] of king and lord of lords one day
[1:52:21] but right now we have the opportunity to
[1:52:23] crown him king of our lives
[1:52:25] hallelujah and we know he's coming into
[1:52:27] power
[1:52:29] hallelujah holy we know he's coming into
[1:52:31] power so let's be
[1:52:32] like mo uh a david's mighty man
[1:52:37] we know he's coming into power the
[1:52:39] philistines of garrison sure they have
[1:52:41] they are ordained to do it this
[1:52:43] scientific age that takes faith away
[1:52:45] from people and
[1:52:46] you know just explains the bible away
[1:52:48] explains the message away
[1:52:50] you know just tries to make it some form
[1:52:51] of religion we're going to chop through
[1:52:53] that
[1:52:54] we're going to chop through that holy
[1:52:57] everyone must have their own revival
[1:52:59] everyone must have their reality of the
[1:53:01] word and their own lives
[1:53:02] not just the older ones the younger ones
[1:53:04] and not just the younger ones but the
[1:53:05] older ones
[1:53:07] hallelujah so i say let's take that
[1:53:09] two-edged sword

[1:53:18] trouble let's chop through it all and
[1:53:20] get our king of fresh during a
[1:53:21] pentecostal war
[1:53:22] hallelujah we are ordained and maybe if
[1:53:25] i just repeat
[1:53:26] this for the next hour i proud sink in
[1:53:28] just like
[1:53:29] moses went into egypt he got his people
[1:53:32] out
[1:53:34] he knew what his job was i think god
[1:53:36] helped me i just float around
[1:53:38] but he was focused i have one job
[1:53:43] this is my job his whole life was now
[1:53:46] his energies were put behind that job
[1:53:48] may we be like the same may we be the
[1:53:50] same
[1:53:52] don't worry about what's going on in the
[1:53:54] world it will go on
[1:53:56] if you read it or not it will continue
[1:53:58] on
[1:54:00] we have one job hallelujah
[1:54:03] we have one job and as moses went in
[1:54:07] and got his people out we can tell the
[1:54:09] devil
[1:54:10] let them go we have the we have the
[1:54:13] ability to do it
[1:54:16] amen we can we can go into his face
[1:54:20] say satan you give them up in the name
[1:54:22] of jesus christ
[1:54:24] if he's taken your joy go get it back if
[1:54:27] he's taken your peace go get it back if
[1:54:29] he's taken your victory go get it back
[1:54:31] if he's taking your piece of mind go get
[1:54:32] it back remember the philosophy just
[1:54:34] come and rob
[1:54:35] remember shamgar came to a day he got
[1:54:37] sick of it
[1:54:38] there was a harvest season where he got
[1:54:40] sick of it
[1:54:41] year after year they'd come in and stomp
[1:54:43] in and they would say shamgar looked
[1:54:45] like you did a real good crop this year
[1:54:47] you know and and he would see his family
[1:54:49] slowly whittling away and see you know
[1:54:51] and then
[1:54:51] finally thought maybe this this harvest
[1:54:53] we can keep it
[1:54:55] but then he heard the stomp stomp stomp
[1:54:57] of the soldiers coming up the road
[1:54:59] and they thought well we'll just do like
[1:55:01] we did before you know it's funny the
[1:55:02] devil is a as a person he he
[1:55:05] he's just rinse and repeat we'll do it
[1:55:08] again we'll do it again we'll do it it
[1:55:09] will come beat them this way again
[1:55:11] but then something happened in shamgar
[1:55:13] brother ram said he saw
[1:55:15] the condition of his family and his wife
[1:55:17] and something rose up in him
[1:55:19] it didn't change who he was he just
[1:55:21] recognized who he was
[1:55:22] he recognized that he was a circumcised
[1:55:25] son of abraham
[1:55:27] living in his promised land hallelujah
[1:55:29] he was like that every harvest time
[1:55:31] before
[1:55:32] he was like that from his birth but he
[1:55:34] recognized something
[1:55:36] i am a son of abraham god has given us
[1:55:39] this land hallelujah
[1:55:40] that same god that was with moses and
[1:55:42] joshua that gave us the land is the same
[1:55:43] god today
[1:55:45] it doesn't matter what the philistines
[1:55:46] do to everyone else it stops right here
[1:55:49] this devil's stopping right here he's
[1:55:50] not going any further
[1:55:52] this is the last time these these devils
[1:55:54] walk into my house
[1:55:55] and he took his ox code he took he took
[1:55:58] what he had
[1:55:59] he said well i don't have the faith to
[1:56:00] do it he took an ox code
[1:56:02] david took a shepherd sling hallelujah
[1:56:05] he just took what he had
[1:56:08] he and he ran out there maybe they just
[1:56:11] laughed at him so who's this sham guy's
[1:56:13] lost his mind
[1:56:15] what a stupid fool he is no he wasn't a
[1:56:18] stupid fool
[1:56:19] he knew who he was he killed one then
[1:56:22] two
[1:56:22] and three then maybe they start to pick
[1:56:24] up their weapons didn't stop him four
[1:56:26] five six seven everyone all of you are
[1:56:29] going down hallelujah there you go
[1:56:31] finally 100 uh uh 598 599

[1:56:40] all
[1:56:41] dead we have
[1:56:44] listen there's an anointing in this
[1:56:45] place and it doesn't just stand these
[1:56:47] four walls i trust it goes home with you
[1:56:50] i mean we're going to rouse ourselves
[1:56:51] remember we've heard the sound of it
[1:56:53] going
[1:56:54] we heard the sound of a government we're
[1:56:55] not here just to sit back and wait for
[1:56:57] our bodies to be changed

[1:57:04] chop through every devil
[1:57:06] amen now is the season
[1:57:10] i may tear you into but it'll be worth
[1:57:11] it things that we carry in our very much
[1:57:14] always preach to myself every sunday but
[1:57:16] you'll be things we carry and things we
[1:57:17] don't understand about ourselves
[1:57:19] sometimes it's going to literally just
[1:57:20] rip us into
[1:57:22] but it's worth it because when you
[1:57:24] realize when god takes something from
[1:57:25] you realize that was never part of me
[1:57:27] anyway
[1:57:28] hallelujah that was never mine you know
[1:57:30] we take ownership of too much
[1:57:33] rich and increase with goods you know
[1:57:36] i'm not talking about material things
[1:57:37] either that's my
[1:57:39] well that's my impatience i'm just a
[1:57:42] certain age i can't handle
[1:57:44] noise too much anymore and you know this
[1:57:46] i just need some peace and quiet

[1:57:53] know
[1:57:54] there's these things but hold on hold on
[1:57:58] why would we let those little things rob
[1:57:59] us of enjoying our families
[1:58:03] amen you know i think as steve brisson
[1:58:05] said you know they're young you want to
[1:58:07] try and
[1:58:07] quiet them down all the time when
[1:58:09] they're teenagers you want to say why
[1:58:10] aren't they
[1:58:10] why aren't they doing anything why could
[1:58:12] well you spent years quieting them down
[1:58:14] that's right you know but now what
[1:58:16] you've so so the devil's coming
[1:58:18] and he's actually allowed you used you
[1:58:21] to beat them down
[1:58:23] that when you want them to rise up
[1:58:25] they're beaten down
[1:58:28] i say lord jesus help us that we don't
[1:58:31] beat them down we just lift them up
[1:58:33] i just oh boy you know what love
[1:58:37] if all of our children they just they
[1:58:39] just
[1:58:40] join rankers hallelujah
[1:58:43] they just joined ranks they took this
[1:58:44] word doesn't matter boy girl whatever
[1:58:48] they took this word and they start
[1:58:49] chopping philistines with us too
[1:58:52] hallelujah and they're the ones that
[1:58:53] drive the service i mean they're the
[1:58:55] ones that drive the music drive the
[1:58:57] prayer meetings
[1:58:58] oh they drive the bible study they're
[1:59:00] the one driving where's the whole
[1:59:02] we just can't keep up with this that's
[1:59:05] that's my prayer this is not an h thing
[1:59:08] anymore
[1:59:10] hallelujah this is not you're going to
[1:59:11] be a certain age you're going to do this
[1:59:12] no no hold on
[1:59:14] if if samuel could be a certain age and
[1:59:17] god could speak to him
[1:59:20] and change the whole course of israel

[1:59:58] their house again there'll be peace in
[1:59:59] their house again
[2:00:00] there'll be a drill rejoicing in a love
[2:00:02] and how there'll be a different kind of
[2:00:04] a house different kind of an atmosphere
[2:00:07] hallelujah oh that's just a pie in the
[2:00:10] sky pipe dream no

[2:00:21] noise and the
[2:00:22] rubbish of the day you open your front
[2:00:24] door
