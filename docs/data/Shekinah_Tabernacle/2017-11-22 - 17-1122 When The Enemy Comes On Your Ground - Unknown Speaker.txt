thank you amen good good evening everyone god bless you all trusty ones had a good first part of the week and even if you haven't praise the Lord amen so let's just go to first samuel in chapter 17 and then we're going to read we're going to go to the book of galatians this here in 1st Samuel 17 and 1 and very familiar piece of scripture I trust e-everyone it's the story of David and Goliath it says here in in 1st Samuel 17 and 1 we're just going to read this verse now the Philistines gathered two gathered together their armies to battle and we're gathered together at choke off which belongeth to Judah and pitched between choke off and azekah in FS teman it's gonna read that verse notice where they are there in Judah they're not on the dardan the land of the Philistines they're in Judah then we'll go to Galatians 4 and 1 the devil always stands in the wrong spot Galatians 4 and 1 it says this now I say that the ear as long as he is a child differeth nothing from a servant though he be Lord of all but as under tutors and governors until the time appointed to the Father even so we when we were children were in bondage under the elements of the world but when the fullness of the time was come God sent forth his son made of a woman made under the law to redeem them that were under the law that we might receive the adoption of sons and because ye are sons God has sent forth the spirit of his son into your hearts crying Abba Father wherefore thou art no more a servant but a son and if a son then an heir of God through Christ amen may the Lord bless his word this night you may have your seats now we read we read in 1st Samuel and I want to take if I could take a thought and sometimes I struggle to think of a title but if the devil's on your ground you have a right to kick him off we see you know we read here we read here in 1st Samuel 17 that the that the Philistines were camped in the inheritance of Judah now they were on God's there on God's children's land now David came from the tribe of Judah they were standing on his ground they were standing on his ground and because he was from Judah now remember he was anointed to become King so nothing that would could come into his Dominion could defeat him I meant he had the right any enemy that rose up in his Dominion either from within or from without he had the authority by by what the office that God had placed him into he had the authority to destroy that enemy to deal with that enemy he had the authority to do it and he had God backing him up I mean that he could enforce what God had made him to be he could use that office that God had made him to be and he stand in that office and he could defeat every devil that's why as a as a 13 year old or whatever age you know boy cuz Goliath if you read the story he stands it says bring me a man bring me a man to fight me he's standing in he's standing in David's inheritance and Judah he's standing in his inheritance he says bring me a man and and that challenge fell on the wrong is because that challenge fell on me is of the person that it belonged to hallelujah so now here was here was so so so so Goliath boys fell into those ears and something stood and David saying this devil this Philistine this uncircumcised Philistine he must leave my land he has challenged us to a battle I'm going to face the battle I mean I'm not going to shrink back from this from this foe though he's a giant though he may be a trained man I've just been a shepherd boy amen but God is I've been anointed by a god-ordained profit by a vindicated prophet of my age I've been anointed by him I mean to become king of this land so therefore nothing is going to stop me becoming king of this land hallelujah now let's just go to the book of Genesis quickly we're just going to read a couple of scriptures and Genesis chapter 1 I trust us built some faith I mean that no matter what the enemy has boasts you know the enemy boasts against us parents you may have some of them but you're not going to take them all with you I mean I remember brother bus call sharing a testimony winners girls were young the deal will seat you could have some but you won't have them all he says I'm gonna have them all they're mine Satan you have no right Amen you know so if there are your inheritance amen don't don't shrink back and say well maybe they don't mean to be there what are you doing about it as like anything sickness amen kick it off I'm in depression kick it off amen you know just the doubts and reasoning kick it off amen drive it out Alleluia now this is the whole world that we're gonna read about so there's the fourth day Genesis 1 and 14 she's here thank God said let there be lights in the firmament of the heaven to divide the day from the night and let them be for signs and for seasons and for days and years let them be for lights in the firmament of heaven to give light upon the earth and it was so and God made two great lights the lesser light to rule the day sorry two great lights the greater light to rule the day notice their purpose the greater light is going to rule the day and the lesser light to rule the night and he made the stars also and he set them in the firmament of heaven to give a light upon the earth and to rule over the day and over the night and to divide the light from the darkness and God saw it was good so he placed this he plate and and this word that when it says made the word does not imply a creative act but declaring merely a functions as designating a function they are already there but God is saying this this light the Sun is going to rule the day and then the moon is going to rule it's going to have it's going to rule the night now when G Jesus is the light of the world he's the Sun he's the a so in this is natural the tongue spiritual now he's the SOE I mean when he was here he was it was the daytime Amen but now he said but now year he he said but now ye are the light of the world so he went away and then he came in 12th and his children and they became the light of the world and we understand the moon the Sun and the moon are symbolic I mean the Sun the issue in represents Christ the Esso in and in the moon represents the church because we don't have a light of ourselves we were really merely reflecting I mean the light of the Sun back to the stock world but notice there the purpose was to have dominion to rule I mean you're gonna the Sun is going to rule the day the moon is gonna rule the night hallelujah that means enter all means you're in touch I mean you're you you've got the head I mean you're not the tail you're the hit halleluyah says early singing creation I'm in my bride my bride will have dominion she's going to rule this dark place I mean she's going to rule this darkness and you're gonna say I'm part of that body I mean I'm proud of that redeemed number doesn't matter how big I am sure I am Randa I am said I am whatever I am I'm part of that number hallelujah so he's telling us now you're gonna rule Amen so if we get a rule the devil has to be under our feet I mean every working every weapon if this has to be crushed I mean it's got to be under our feet I mean we're the Apostle Paul said in the New Testament the devil be bruised under your feet shortly amen this is this is what the Bible's saying and you gotta so you got to look at the enemy that yo that comes against you cuz I know it comes against you it comes against me and you may try and deny it say everything's peachy but it comes against you he comes against you with reasoning is that really the truth is what your parents are doing is to really change them do you really think this is going to give you eternal life reasoning amen you know do you really think this is the the one this tens of thousands of different churches that say that they have Jesus Christ in them it's how do you know that you're not like one of them well I'll tell you number one we have direct answer God answering a scripture manifesting in Scripture and thus our that's why I put that quote on brothers and sisters I don't have it necessarily on me now but brother Browns preaching the court trial the trial of 1964 and he says can I take the witness stand any and he begins to speak about Malachi for revelations 10 7 Luke 17 30 the Son of man being revealed he says God has fulfilled these scriptures and then he speaks a little bit more and he says now if I have said the truth let the God who you know let let God come forth and prove that it's true and he begins to discern this person's got this and this this is your name and this is what's wrong with you this is Rob's wrong with you hallelujah that was the son of man coming down that was now God saying I'm gonna take the witness stand hallelujah it's not just this little Kentucky and saying some things I'm going to prove to you it's not his idea I mean it's not some different religious movement this is me speaking I mean through the mouth of a prophet hallelujah I mean this message has been over vindicated and even as great as critics it is like a phenomena an incredible ministry you never find it at anywhere else so it's not just a movement this is not just a different Church this is different this is very different this is God coming on the scene that same God comes and he speaks to your life and he fills you with the same spirit I mean the same God comes and lives in you hallelujah so now when that same God was there with the Prophet and every every spirit death had to give up a young people that died he just spoke their name like a lady Mary died in the audience and he goes to tell her son Billy Paul go pray for her and and he says no daddy he just hears Mary and she comes back to life holy your brother Wade died in the service because of a complex he had a complex he's what brother Branham was preaching and he died and he got risen to life again you hear it at the end of a one of the services and you hear you can hear his wife scream he just died he didn't stay dead that wasn't it wasn't brother branham doing it are you gonna think about well what is this this is God saying this is me it's not him it's me and they takes on a whole new dimension because now here's God coming out of eternity and he's wanting to tell Adams fallen race I've redeemed you I mean I've redeemed you I have an inheritance I'm gonna give you an inheritance I'm gonna give you a place that's why reading Galatians I mean we're not we're not under Tudors anymore we're not under tutors we're not under the elements of this world telling us what to do I mean but we're sons and daughters of God I mean adoption as a placing I mean and the bride has been placed in the cellar hallelujah under her under the ministry of Malachi for I mean we've been placed hallelujah I mean if we replace friends you say well I don't know where I am in my journey here's David he's only 13 years old because of glassy bring me a man you know coming of age of 13 this is he may have been younger doesn't matter he's a little shrimp Goliath laughs um all right you know am i a dog and he's a man that's been anointed well he's a boy that's been anointed by the prophet of his age I say he's on his way to his place and he may not be on the throne but he's been anointed to become king hallelujah and there is weather weather with a staff and a sling that's all he knew he said I don't know too much just Garth what you know God will take care of it hallelujah God will take it it'll go straight to the killing point hallelujah so now here he is bring me a man he comes David what am i dog a little shrimp of a person he's saying you're a believer look at you you don't have any faith muscles where's your faith prove me where your faith is and they said and Davis this is just me but David's thing I'm standing in my inheritance I can't wonderfulness I'm standing I'm yeah I'm standing in my inheritance I've been anointed by the prophet of my age you know there's an anointing in this word this message poured out an anointing upon the earth hallelujah and it anointed all different kinds of things that come to their place because the rain falls on the just and the unjust I remember the anointing fell amen and the purpose of it really was to bring for the bride for Jesus Christ I mean but you know different things have come forth but there's a bride that's been gathered I mean prophecies being fulfilled and you're the main part of that prophecy hallelujah so here is I'm standing in my inheritance he's standing there inheritance I mean I'm standing and and the devil I I'm not on his territory he's come onto my territory hallelujah he's in trouble he thinks I'm gonna kill you and invade but no he's gonna be my trophy hallelujah like Abraham Abraham the promise of the land wasn't even really to Abraham but to his children but yet he's dwelling in his land I'm in los loros taking captive Lots caught up and all everything going on in the world around him Abraham's just separated unto the promise of God for as our Amen and then now Lots taking captive but he's standing and and the inheritance God send your seeds gonna have he's living in it the enemies come and taking part of his family away then here he comes he arms the servants they don't even worry as what they do they get back what was tight taken from them hallelujah and that's the father of the faith Amen under the blood of bulls and goats I mean he's just so churning in a land I mean we're not so churning we're in the inheritance I mean because it wasn't given it was promised him but a seed would would would dwell in the land ain't man it's just like many promises that the Apostle Paul would write or Peter would write their prophecy I mean it's really yes sir they're gonna fulfill it hallelujah they which are alive and remain the rapture promised they thought it was them but they'd be the ones who had who had who had sleep who'd be waiting amen the did in Christ that would rise that was them but we the one that ones that are alive and remain how lujah I mean it was sitting there waiting thousands of years but then the children of the faith come here we are I find myself in this number and then now we're gonna live it out amen so David now listen friends we have an inheritance God's given your inheritance in Christ Jesus I'm gonna read you a quote I wish this would just be ingrained into every soul this is a this is from my commission in 51 he says you're taken out of the pawnshop that's right it's like cash converters that's right the only thing you have to do is accept faith in Christ and you'll walk out of the pawnshop that's all you'll walk out you'll walk free you've got to take him at his word doesn't mad how you feel though go looking for a feeling just say Lord I take you at your word I mean because the devil will beat you up and down with feelings because it'll never be enough and you can picture in your mind what could happen it'll never happen and you're sitting there just take God at His Word by His stripes you are healed I'm the law of God that heals all thy diseases the promise of the Holy Ghost is given to you and to your children amen the Holy Ghost is given to my promises given to my three girls because I received it hallelujah for the promise that you as many as the Lord our God shall call that's what His Word says he's our kinsman redeemer isn't that right that God was manifested in the flesh to take our place to be our kids to be a kinsman to us as in the Book of Ruth and Exodus and so forth how preachers teaches there how we'd become kinsmen to God and God came down and dwelt in his son Christ Jesus became kinfolks to us and he was our kinsman redeemer my phone just died but it says Allen here that's everything we lost because of the fall Calvary has brought it back to us everything we lost he's Adam and Eve there were gods over the earth this this is the Dominion anything that could come into their place Adam Adam was you know God of the earth so that means he was in charge of the whole thing he arranged it how he would sin came and his wife was deceived he fell with her to try and save her and then now this world goes into the hands of you know of Satan Satan himself he's the god of this world no we're not we are meant to have dominion look what the second Adam proved that he was lord over sickness every demon he conquered health he won he he conquered everything that could be conquered there's nothing that is not conquered I mean death has to be swallowed up in victory sure but he conquered death he rose again hell couldn't hold him I mean how couldn't keep him that term couldn't stop him I mean those Roman guards couldn't stop him coming for let's seal that they put on them and couldn't stop them coming for hallelujah and it's the same thing I mean denominational terms couldn't stop them coming out of history amen in the terms of this world couldn't stop you coming out hallelujah you had to come out because at a time appointed I mean they'll come out hallelujah we've come out of the terms of this world hallelujah so he concurred held this and the growth all the victory had here he had dominion over nature I meant everything hit the menu of everything a funeral that he went to never stayed a funeral amen Lazarus was food four days dead in the grave his body was decaying hallelujah and he just said two words three words Lazarus come forth and brother Bram says if he didn't say Lazarus but he had come forth there would have been a general resurrection because he is the resurrection and the life hallelujah here was a body that was rotting and they and the soul of the spirit of that man had gone someplace he would have been rejoicing here to be in Abraham's bosom and then he but then he hears a voice Lazarus come forth pulled him from that dimension into this time incheon and he wasn't in a sick decaying body that's healthy and well and he walks out of the tomb bound up on his grave grave clothes now well now that's now remember they that believe in me the works that I do shall you do also don't say oh but it means greater and greater is imparting eternal life know the works that he does you shall do also because there's now the same Jesus and a many membered body so if the Lord called us if he actually said going someone just died over yo decay it said in the body Eddie and you knew he spoke to you and he told you go lay hands on that body call them back to life again in my name it would happen it would happen because the same Jesus that was at Lazarus tumors in you I meant that Jesus proved every that Adam lost Jesus proved that he had dominion over it but then Jesus wasn't wanting just to keep it all for himself because the reason the reason that he proved that as he wanted to show you this is what a redeemed son or daughter does this is how a redeemed and son and daughter is a meant where every enemy must come under their feet and you've got also have such confidence you say well why does sometimes things Terry and and things go unanswered does it does it shake your faith it shouldn't shake your faith shouldn't shake your faith as I see it on Sunday Abraham for 25 years Isaac's coming Isaac's coming Isaac's coming / Isaac's coming and then Isaac here hallelujah because he knew because it had so become that promise had become part of him Isaac's coming and that was the father of the faith how much more the children of the faith the raptures coming the raptures coming the bodies changes coming the dead in Christ are going to rise we're going to walk on the streets of gold I trust it mean something to you I think about the resurrection quite a lot and it moves me I want to see it I want to I want experience it I want to before I even realize hey this is different hallelujah I do I really think about it quite a lot because we're living in that season you say you've just you've had too much Sun or something no I haven't something happened I read this and I didn't say well how am I gonna do it no he said oh I'll do it I'll do it do you believe it yes I do believe it how is it going to happen is it going to be a wonderful day is it going to be a terrible day sunny day you're gonna feel full of faith I don't know I'm not a details person I'm even a list of a details person when it comes to the Lord and how he's going to fulfill his work because he fulfills it by bringing it to pass and I don't know how he's going to do it I know I I've indicated prophet Toby is gonna come a sweep maybe there's gonna be changing these atoms and the very life that's in you is going to change this body hallelujah so I don't know how it's gonna work out but I know it's gonna happen amen we're gonna we've got to have faith and evidence things not seen real faith doesn't look at evidence are you feeling better you're not feeling better Sarah do you feel younger no Isaac's coming maybe she got a bit sick of it after a while but then there came a time where she had a visitation amen so don't get too worried Sarah Sarah data for 25 years Isaac's coming maybe in the back of her head that old crank he's getting more crazy and old as he as he as he goes along because he probably said it even more because he's quite rejoicing it's even more impossible and it's more impossible but Isaac came but because now she had a visitation of God herself and Genesis chapter 18 and her heart was changed from unbelief to faith are we turning their cable girls gonna go to Hebrews 11 but we'll turn to Genesis 18 real quick because if we read would just read a couple of snippets here but God became flesh and came down and had a meal with Abraham and then after they had had that if we go down to verse 9 and they said unto Him where is Sarah thy wife and he said behold on the team this whole chapters for you you may you may be doubting you may be not so sure why these people so excited why's mum and dad so excited about these things why do they start shouting and crying and sometimes screaming why what's happened I don't know what's happened to these people why they so happy about it I don't you know and these people tell me in the world no this is now my friends say they're crazy and I don't know you know that's like Sarah doubting you got to become fully persuaded but don't worry if you think like that because it comes a time we where you know he's got to turn your heart to faith serious heart had to be turned to faith amen took 25 years but it happened so don't but Abraham knew Abraham had a revelation series part of this promise so her heart must be turned to faith and that's why the rest of us have to have a real I pray revelation these ones are part of the promise they must believe it God has to come visit them I believe you will so where is Sarah thy wife he said Behold on the tenth and he said I'll certainly return unto the according to the time of life and lo Sarah thy wife shall have a son and Sarah heard of a tenth door which was behind him so time of life speaks of a woman so according to time of life you could have the promised son he's talking to Abraham but he's not talking to Abraham at all he's talking to Sarah because Sarah had to believe Sarah had the belief Amen because it was out of Abraham and Sarah the promised son was going to come that's why Hagar you know having having what's as I'm having Ishmael that wasn't even part of the promise that's not where the promise son was coming amen and it's the same thing it's the same thing with us I mean the church in itself a 2000 years we wait for the promise of the body change and the church has been waiting for 2,000 years then finally we've had a visitation of the Son of Man I mean we've had a visitation of the son of man a man he's discerned our hearts I mean he's shown us Here I am and this is according to time of life now is the season I mean we're gonna we're gonna we're you going to receive the promised son you're going to meet the Lord in the air amen this is prophecy don't read your Bible like a story book whatever you do now Abraham and Sarah we'll all them well stricken in age and it ceased to be with Sarah after the manner of woman she's well past menopause and therefore Sarah laughs within herself saying am i waxed old that I have pleasure my lord being old also and the Lord said unto Abraham wherefore did Sarah laugh saying shall I ever surely bear child which amoled as anything too hard for the Lord at the time appointed I'll return unto the according to the time of life and Sarah shall have a son then Sarah denied saying I laughed not for she was afraid and he said nay but thou did us love now Sarah the reason Sarah was not destroyed because of her doubt was because she was part of the promise now we in our unbelief should have been destroyed by God amen but because we're part of the promise because we're part of the promise there has to come a season where we don't laugh at the promise anymore you know you would probably think well really if you take some of the things I say you'd probably think I'm a bit crazy in a cow nor mind has this body gonna be changed where's the evidence of it ever happening before what do you mean the world is going to burn up and it's going to be a new heavens and new earth winds this ever happened like that before the world's ever been burned up before they meant they laughed at Noah it's never rain before scientifically proved that it that that that rain has ever fallen I've never fallen before he sounded crazy they meant they say you know because to the carnal mind it sounds mad but that's the thing you may just laugh at it these people are mad she laughed at it because it seemed impossible to her I'm nearly a hundred years old I can't have a child we've been married since we were young we haven't had a child then we can't have a child now it's impossible it's why she left how can I have pleased with my Lord and her you know how can I have a child she laughed because she was part of the promise she could not be destroyed amen hey follow everyone's gone very quiet maybe you're thinking I do I trust you out but you know we friends because we're part of the promise but they came a season where your heart was turned when he visited you and you began to actually realize a body change I believe it we're at the end of all things I believe it I'm one of those redeemed ones I believe it I'm the bride of I believe it he paid it all on Calvary I believe it I mean he's my Redeemer I believe it God became flesh and walked among us I believe it hallelujah I mean Malachi 4 fulfilled I believe it the son of man being revealed again I believe it hallelujah I mean we're at the end of all things I believe it why because your heart was turned from from doubt to faith amen and in Hebrews 11 it says this that season verse 8 of Hebrews 11 it says by faith Abraham when he was called to go out on to a place which he should after receive for an inheritance obeyed and he went out not knowing whether he went by faith he sojourned at the land of promise as in a strange country dwelling in Tabernacles with Isaac and Jacob the years of him of the same promise for he looked for a city which had foundations whose builder and maker is God because he may he met the maker of that city he met the king of that city Melchizedek through faith also Sara herself received strength to conceive seed and was delivered of a child when she was past age now here's the reason because she judged him faithful who had promised hallelujah because he she judged him faithful do you have that because she judged him faithful who had promised I mean you know I place that with every scripture I just get place worth put it on your fridge because she judged him faithful who had promised I mean before the first bomb drops the nuclear bomb drops the bride will be up and glory because she judged him faithful who had promised I mean the bride's not going through the Great Tribulation because she judged him faithful who had promised us why we believe these things amen I trust that because he is I've judged so when you judge something you look at evidence and you've weighed up the evidence and you've come to a conclusion he's faithful amen who's promised who who's given me the promise hallelujah so now that's how we've got to be we've got to judge him faithful well how's this all gonna work out I've judged him faithful that's the main thing that matters now David David knew he was going to be or not David knew he was going to be on the throne the enemy came into his life and you know the rest of story Goliath was dead David was alive because the enemy that's what happened your wife died now you say well that's just a story and you're trying to collect rose no I'm not David was he came from Judah he came out of this this was his inheritance the the Jewish people in the land actually were one because their inheritance was in that land now our inheritance is in Christ I mean he's given us an inheritance No so the enemy you know he tries to come unto your land so he tries to make you disbelieve the promise he takes your joy away he tries to rob you he takes your joy away he takes your peace away he takes your long-suffering away take tries to take your faith away does he not I mean he tries to take your joy of the Holy Ghost away I mean you the joy of your salvation your first love he tries to take it away and you've got to recognize here's a glass coming on my land yeah I mean he's trying to rob me of this promise someone say Amen I mean that's what he that's what he tries to do but you've got to recognize this land belongs to me this promise belongs to me hallelujah he says my peace that I give unto you and notice the world goes and then and the devil tries to stir your life up and make things all stressful and and you try and worry about too much things you've got to take your slingshot I mean you're going to take whatever you have in your in your hand hallelujah you were to kill you have done that enemy I mean brother Graham says you just get one person and family begin to sing they're going to testify first thing he says you know you've been cutting Philistines plumb to the walls hallelujah you'll have a victory time amen that's just not nice something nice I believe that's a reality oh but I've never seen it happen before I bet you if we win back there we're watching the battle between David and Goliath a lot every one every one of our soldiers would have said have you ever seen a shepherd boy kill a giant champion I've never seen it before but he's brave he's a brave lad who's the slowest runner you run behind me I don't know if I thought he'd kill him but it's the only it's the only option they had I'm not trying to say it as a joke but brother Brahim says the soldiers believed it could be done but no they knew it could be done killing the life but they didn't believe it could be done because if they believed that they would have done it themselves and so they know I've never seen this before how about you know I've never seen a shepherd killer kill they kill a champion like this well does that mean it can happen I don't know let's find out and and you know and David had never seen anyone he'd never fought the this kind of thing before but he says I've killed a lion and I've killed a bear and he put this this Goliath in the same category as those animals he says well if God helped me kill these ones I'll kill this one hallelujah he'd never seen it be done before but he did it because it was revealed to him now this is my land this is my inheritance I'm gonna take this enemies come on my ground hallelujah it's like it's like here's a kiyah the Syrians had eaten up all the land I mean but he trusted in God I mean he believed God would deliver them here now in the capital of the promised land amen here he is and he had confidence God will deliver us I mean and what happened God delivered hallelujah never worked for him it'll work for you amen will it not and it work for you and so and so and so David killed Goliath it never happened before but it but then it just happened a shepherd killed a champion amen and so we ran it and so we should never worry about well I've never seen it before I've never experienced it before is that in the scripture why don't chase a thousand doesn't matter what size you are one will chase a thousand ain't man one will check to chase ten thousand someone do the math and work out how many will chase just ask rupiah I believe those demons that came out of the river Euphrates we'd chase them and Shem go Shamgar steady his lane this is just end of the blood of bulls and goats she's under the blood of bulls goats sham guys standing in his land here he is his family just survived one winter they had been harvesting laboring and harvesting that just finally harvested their food I think we'll survive he just had little children this is what happens when faith rises we should look in the promise something moved he heard the heared the Philistine soldiers marching up the road brother Bram says and he had heard it the season before but this season was a different season I mean something moved he looked down at his children's faces I trust when we looked down in our children's faces we should see God we ever need I mean we've been walking on this earth a bit more than them and we've seen maybe too much and we don't want them to experience the same things we want them to walk to dwell in this land I meant in a greater way than we ever have hallelujah and he looked down the face of his children and his wife and he said no I'm the head of my house I'm just I'm just coloring in the picture a little bit of verses okay cuz it's like one verse in the Bible I remember but he looks down he looks at his family he says I'm the head of this home he comes the enemy he didn't have a sword he didn't have a militia he didn't have training he probably wasn't very strong but he grabbed the first thing he had his ox coat hallelujah brother M says in one place he jumps out the window I mean any and he goes at them and the thing is he done every one of those soldiers hallelujah and he became a judge over Israel why is that because the devil came on his land the devil came on his land he wasn't after them the devil came on his land and he knew devil you're on the law you've come to the killing place you've come to the slaughtering place you know in battles defensive battles you know the the defender they actually set up like an a siege they actually set up a killing zone when the attackers come have you read about that do you know about those things they set up a killing zone and then any attackers have got to get over that killing zone to get to where the defenders are yeah they do there's a warfare now it's got to be the same thing us amen there's a killing zone it's in our inheritance and it's everywhere it's everywhere it's in your home it's wherever you go I mean when the devil tries to come and put doubt on the Word of God and put doubt on who you are in him I mean because if he can if he can get you to think you're not a son and daughter member a son and daughter has Authority they're not a servant he just tries to get you think you just a servant I mean you'll never amount to anything because if he gets you to think that you're not a sudden daughter that means you're a servant that means you're under his Dominion again does he not try and do that you have to take him take your slingshot if it's warring against you you got to take him you gotta cast them out all right the devil comes into your house you have the authority we ever token I mean we have a we have a life of God I trust you doing you you have the brother Graham says that we ever took and the Bible tells us we ever token and it's a sure token I mean it's not the chemical blood of Jesus Christ because that is gone but it's a life that was in that chemical blood amen was released onto the believer and we have that token I mean he says now you must use that token I mean applying the token as an action that's a doing I met any any and he says you got a person living out of your house and the first place you get a person living of unbelief is out of here I mean it once it spreads out of here then you can print whatever else out of your house hallelujah and if you're purged out all the living you can apply the blood apply the Turcan amen and if the token has applied the devil con he may try and come in but he can't stay I mean he's got to go hallelujah and I've seen it happen I've experienced it more than once I mean it doesn't matter how you feel when you pray doesn't matter how you feel you take God at His Word and you tell Satan you say you know you know brother BAM talk to his enemy you know he talked to his enemy brother busco when he was about 14 years old he was in the first meeting with brother Branham series of meetings you go watch his testimony he says about it and then the first part of the meetings here sitting up in the back but then somehow one of the services here he said right at the front here right in front of the platform and his prayer line and people were healed in different things but then there was a girl the first time someone came with a physical ailment was a girl with crossed eyes and and from where he was sitting he could see the girl had crossed eyes could he he says you couldn't even see really like you could only see the white so it's crossed over that badly praise looks at the girl no change praise again looks again no change I don't know how many times he does this you go see his testimony and they need but school well the bus considers his little heart sink because here was something finally something physical and then and then but you know but then well it doesn't seem anything's happening but then he tells but then brother brother says now we're gonna pray again this time he addressed his enemy he said he prayed away he'd never heard anyone pray before and and the Prophet spoke to Satan and said Satan you have no right to hold this little girl he said the angel Lord told me if I can get the people to belief nothing can stand before my prayer I am believing they're believing now you have to go and then brother BAM prayed for it didn't even look into her eyes and lifted her up facing the facing the crown and her eyes were perfectly straight well ouya why is that because he addressed his enemy and you hear it many times on the tapes he talks to his enemy you've got to talk to your enemy and it's not little mr. big mr. Dibble sir it's not convenient at this time can we you know and I'm this and Jesus loves me and can you know you gotta tell him to get out by the blood of Jesus Christ you have the authority remember Adam had the power of the spoken word in the beginning he could rearrange the God and how he wanted Jesus stood in the power of his voice calm the storms cast out the Devils out of Legion brought Lazarus from the I'm in healed Kansas brought back you know dry says daughter did all manner of things just by his word I mean though and in the works I do you shall do also and greater than us say you do because I go to my father I mean so he's saying that the the power of the believers in it in the words that are spoken hallelujah I remember we are sons and daughters of God the scripture says now not one day you know we're not looking people say oh we're looking for a great big sweeping revival to strike the earth we're living in the middle of it I mean this is the bride's revival I mean this is the awakening of the bride I mean we're not looking for more power to come the PALS being released I mean the outpouring of the Holy Spirit is here how they're gonna recognize what you're sitting in I mean not just sitting in church and something exciting going on God is awakening as his bride I mean God is pouring out a spirit on all flesh all around the world hallelujah we're living in so the powers been given I mean the Prophet speaks a word there's a power behind that word I mean it's been released hallelujah Moses was there standing giving the law saying let's go and take the land I mean a POW was released holy and Joshua and Caleb they received it I mean they said let's take this land Amen Caleb was 84 years old I want my Mountain hallelujah because the POW was released through the word of the Prophet hallelujah I mean Peter was preaching in Cornelius house this is how the gospel started I mean to the Gentiles and his preaching of the Resurrection amen and that released he anointed faith was came into every soul and the Holy Ghost fell upon them to receive their faith hallelujah and he's the same yesterday today and forever I mean we are living we're not looking for another thing to happen the next thing we're looking to happen is the change of these bodies I remember the power of the Gospels here halleluyah said jesus come on to the devil the devil had to leave him I mean everything had to be subject to what he said I am in nature a subject the devil will subject sickness was subject death was subject everything was subject to his words hallelujah even they even youkai if assisted all the scheme's who cares about what the world may do I mean they come to get him in the garden they come to get him in the garden you read in John he says who are you looking for Judas Judas brought them there they knew who they who they knew exactly who they are looking for Jesus says who are you looking for Jesus of Nazareth I'm he they fall backwards they get up again who you looking for Jesus now yo Jesus of Nazareth so I'm he they fall over again amen and then he actually in a way can sense you can take me now why do we care about what the world can do to us I say this under inspiration what do we care about what the world can do to us amen you're the Prophet told us jesus said no man takes my life I lay it down I can take it back up again and the Prophet said now you can say that everything was obedient to the voice of God I mean now everything will be obedient to the voice of God and the bride I mean because the same God that was in the Sun I mean is when the bridegroom is now on the bride hallelujah and you're gonna look at yourself and say that's me I mean doesn't matter how I feel doesn't matter what I think about myself what I've come from hallelujah that's me that same crate of flowers and me hello and I can speak a word under inspiration and it must happen hallelujah that's exactly true I mean what do we have to be afraid of amen it is all in such what you say if ye say unto this mountain be thou removed and be cast into the sea if ye say not if Jesus says if you say Amen God's waiting for you it's like brother Bram said before judgment hit the west coast God told him to pick up the rock throw it into the air picks up a rock throws into the air well would comes down you know and it goes and blasts out the walls of the canyon and all different things happen he says judgment there's strike in the west coast few days after that it was the Good Friday earthquake in Alaska he's a lesser almost sunk massive earthquake but he sit down you have to do something he threw up the rock and that started it you have to do something that's why the devil wants to have you he wants to make you have a negative confession I mean he wants you to say I'm no good I can't really obtain to the promise I really can't be saved the Holy Ghost isn't for me it might be for someone else but it's not for me I've been too lost I've been too wrong I've been too far gone I can never do it he wants you to say those things but you got to take the opposite hey man jesus paid it all all to him I owe the Holy Ghost I don't know how to come but I know it'll come I mean the promises given to me I mean me and my children will be there holy every sickness must go amen the blood cleanses me of all sin I've been sanctified to God hallelujah to the lamb you got to say it go say it in faith hallelujah remember a son son or daughter has Dominion that was Jesus showing his Dominion he and God always lives an example first you see this is what I'm gonna demonstrate cuz cuz to be a to make disciples to make disciples is to be an example it's not all intellectual study that doesn't make her that doesn't make a disciple a disciple is you live an exam in front of the people and it's by practical learning you become a disciple so that's why that's why he he gathers gathers the disciples do I don't know what the time is but I'm not too worried so yeah this is disciples and then he begins to show them a world they knew nothing about he shows the dead raised the sick healed the bread and bread and fishes multiplied the storm count walking on the water all different kinds of things cuz he's trying to show them now this is what I am you'll do the same thing hallelujah and then now that same God came and dwelt in his disciples and they didn't have to learn about a whole bunch of things they knew that same life that was in their Messiah was now on them I mean that's why they could stand before the Sanhedrin totally unafraid I mean totally just not worried they said should we please mentor please God you tell me I mean they were beaten and threatened and they they rejoiced I mean we've been counted worthy to bear his reproach and the gospel isn't all palpable and nice the real gospel isn't all shiny and happy and nice hallelujah but they overcame in their age amen and we're being restored back to the faith of the fathers hallelujah amen we have a right friends we are now now repeat after me and if you're a just say son or say daughter depends what gender you are now by God's grace I am a son of God right now God has made me a son or daughter of God amen amen means so be it amen now we are I mean it doesn't matter how the devil comes against you you know be him he tries to confuse your mind tries to make you double-minded think of it you're all different kind of things amen tries to give you things which you know not of God you just say get off my land get off my inheritance if he's taking your joy get your joy back and he's taking your first love away get your first love back I mean whatever it is get it back you have the right to drive them off I meant don't I can't mean what brother set it up in Auckland at Eastern Convention B says we're not peacekeepers I mean just keeping the peace with the devil we're not peacekeepers I'm a mirror brother and Nene said the last time he is here he said you know the devil's not playing games neither are we I thought that's a real yo that can't stand quoting we're not playing games we know the devil's not playing games we're not playing games either Alleluia queer some musicians to come we're friends just take our god-given rights amen stand on that promise just stand on it I'm wavering hallelujah amen we need
