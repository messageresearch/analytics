yeah it's great to be home and um it turned into a bit of a busman's holiday took a couple of services for Brother Gary but I mean but yeah we had a great time uh let's go to um I'd like to thank Brother Andy and brother Arman for standing in the Gap too while I was away look forward to listening to those sermons amen um we're going to go to 1 Chronicles uh 13 not going to take too much time tonight um so 1 Chronicles 13:1 and then we're going to go read down to verse eight we're going to go to Second Timothy 2:5 amen everyone's happy to be a Christian today good I'm glad amen amen Jeff and B are doing real well it's great to be with them over there I know's bet amen she's doing real good so amen and David consulted with the captains of thousands and hundreds and every and with every leader and David said unto all the congregation of Israel if it seemed good unto you that it be that it be of the Lord Our God let us send abroad unto our Brethren everywhere that are left in all the land of Israel and with them also to the priests and the Levites which are in their cities and suburbs that they may bring themselves unto us and let us bring again again the Ark of our God to us for we inquired not at it in the days of Saul and all the congregation said that they would do so for the thing was right in the eyes of all the people so David gathered all the all Israel together from seor to Egypt even unto the entering of hemo to bring the Ark of God from kilma Jerian and David went up and all Israel to uh B uh that is to uh kth J however however you say that which belongeth to Judah to bring up then the Ark of of God the Lord that dwelleth between the cherubims whose name is called on it and they Carri the Ark of God in a new cart out of the house of abinadab and USU and a drave the cart and Israel and all sorry and David and all Israel played before God with all their might and with singing and with Harps and with potteries and with timberl and with symbols and with trumpets What A procession but it was done wrong 2 Timothy 2:15 says here study you don't have to turn or you can if you want to but I was going to read it study to show thyself approved unto God a Workman that needeth not to be ashamed rightly dividing the word of Truth and i' like to speak about that tonight rightly dividing the word of Truth amen so let's just bow heads in a word of prayer tonight shall we as we go before the Lord Lord Jesus we're so thankful we can sing hosana to the lamb that was slain dear God so thankful we can Praise Your Name Lord Jesus you truly you are the king of kings and Lord of lords and we just want to thank you we can gather together in this manner one more time we just want to pray Lord that you'll take over the service Lord anoint each one Lord Jesus we've read your great Eternal Word Lord we need you the author of the book to come and open it to us Lord speak to our hearts Like Only You Can may you grant it for your glory Lord we want to remember those who couldn't be here tonight be their portion as well Lord those who may be watching Lord by the way the stream Lord Jesus touch their lives too we submit ourselves under your Mighty hand Lord we love you and we thank you in Jesus Jesus Christ's name amen amen God bless you you may have your seats tonight so as I saying I want to speak about rightly dividing the word of truth it's absolutely essential that we that we divide it rightly because if because if there's if Timothy was told to rightly divide it there's a then it's quite possible to wrongly divide the word of Truth to actually come out with the wrong outcome now this this rightly dividing it's it's actually one word in the Greek and it means to make a straight cup that is to dissect to expound correctly the Divine message to rightly divide it and we must as individuals now this is not this sounds like maybe a bit of a ministers kind of a sermon but this is for all of us to rightly divide the word of truth because we need to take the word ourselves and rightly divide it you know we can't put the wrong emphasis or the wrong interpretation on the word we're going to stay exactly with how the word is has been spoken and how the word has been written now it's amazing when you you can go study uh trying to do God a service without his will your brother bar preaches it a couple of times and you know he goes to this portion of scripture here with David and it's amazing how David you know the uh David consulted the wrong people I'm just going to kind of paraphrase it bit down but you know he consulted the captains of thousands and hundreds and with every leader so those with influence he consulted but he didn't consult the right one he didn't he didn't he did not consult Nathan the prophet the word of the lord always comes to the prophet so he consulted these ones and because of David's influence and it sounded like a good idea because who would not want the Ark of the Covenant in your city I mean if we're Israelites we would want the ark we would we we wouldn't want it in some foreign land we would want it in our in our city amen because we know the ark represents the word he wanted to restore the word back into Israel and but you see you see he consulted the wrong one and and you know and and but the thing is this influence Came Upon all the people as it says in verse four there and all the congregation said that we would do so for the thing was right in the eyes of all the people but the thing is he put it on a new cart he didn't he didn't carry it the ark was not carried how the word said it should be carried you know we must be very careful that we stick with the word that's been revealed it's absolutely essential that we don't deviate from it add or take away from this message but we stay with the word of God as a church as individuals as families it's very important because there's power in this word and if you want the power of God to live through your life get back to the truth amen not to because David no doubt he saw the ark was already on a cart the Philistines put it on a cart and maybe he thought this is how it should be carried but he didn't consult the word to see the right pattern of it and so he he he copied a denominational idea and and unfortunately that brought death where it should have bring Life coming into Israel it brought death to a sincere worshiper that didn't want to see the arc topple we know that user died because he tried to steady the Ark of God and so Timothy is told to rightly divide the word I say unfortunately though David was a was a Son of God he was King he was an in his an adopted position of God you know he sincerely loved the Lord he did not rightly divide the word amen so you say what because people might think well we can't get into this mess well we can if David can we can so we don't want to get into that kind of a mess amen but you I know I'm looking at a room of sincere people here you know so you know but the thing is we don't but David was sincere he was sincere you know they played with all their might this was not just a ual oxen walking down the road towards Jerusalem this is playing and trumpets and singing and dancing and would have been prepared and there would have been great enthusiasm going along in that in that group there would have been a real atmosphere but yet it was done wrong now brother Braham says that you know what it comes to any anything of the Scripture it says if a prophet or a dreamer or whatever it is or a teacher hasn't based his theory exactly on thus sayith the Lord I don't believe it see it's just a theory unless it's tied in with God's word unless it's from Genesis to Revel ation is just a theory and we're not here to express theories you can go to Victoria University if you want to hear theories we're not here to listen to theories we here to listen to thus sayeth the Lord am me that's why we worship God because we want to Worship in spirit and in truth not in spirit and in theories but spirit and Truth amen this is what this is the father seeketh them to worship Him in spirit and in truth so we're not here to approach god with theories we're here to approaching on thus sayith the Lord he says it's got to come right back here from Genesis to Revelation not just one place it's got to come through the Bible and tie exactly together yes sir it's got to dovetail with the rest it and hook it all together if you don't you could take one thing and say that there's purgatory and preach Catholicism out of the Bible but it's got a dovetail completely from Genesis to Revelation make the picture clear that's right so David had an inspiration to bring the ark into the city but his in but but his inspiration didn't tie from Genesis to Revelation see it doesn't matter how real inspiration can be like brother bam was asked about about water baptism for example and someone asked him did the angel of the Lord tell you that because because the person said we believe the angel of the Lord and brother bam said if the angel told me anything different to what the Bible said it wasn't the angel of the Lord and I wouldn't believe him it's got to be in the Bible First so you take any inspiration it doesn't matter how fantastic how great it may seem how real it may appear it's got to be in the word and not just one point because remember they wanted the ark because the Bible says you know God built the ark in the Tabernacle that God would dwell among his people so no doubt David would have known that he says I want God to dwell Among Us so he had that one bit of inspiration but he didn't follow the whole word of God where the ark would be carried correctly amen so so and it brought death into the camp see it's got to every Revelation or every theory has to dovetail one scripture to another all tied together am mean CU we want a clear picture I mean we got a clear picture of Jesus Christ in this day we don't have a muddled bunch of theories or a group of men trying to approach God and work it out with their intellect now God has revealed himself in this day we know who Jesus Christ is we know that he is the Lord God Almighty we know the right approach to him we know what pleases him and displeases him it's not a gray area anymore God's taken the Gray Away the light Shan amen and light white is white and black is black what right is right and wrong is wrong amen so we want to make sure we're building our lives correctly on the word of God Amen because remember that the that the you know we're built upon the foundation of the Apostles and the prophets Jesus Christ himself being the Chief Cornerstone amen so we're building a building amen we're not building a wall we're building a building amen and we're all individually built up into the image of Jesus Christ the statue of the perfect man so so we must be built according to the blueprint right and me we can't you know it's just like um for example you know every building is built with a with a with a map with a design with a plan in mind now you can't start on a foundation and build a different thing and say it's right so for example maybe with these guys it's just a picture but maybe just say for argument sake this is a this is a uh toilet and the bathroom and everything so the foundation has been mapped out as that maybe just say for argument sake you know the piping and everything the plumbing and everything underneath that Foundation is for a bathroom but then the builders decide we're going to build a dining hall on top of this thing well well what's been built on the foundation doesn't match the foundation you see so the word of God whatever the foundation is what's built on it must match it it can't deviate it's got to be the same thing it's like brother Bram said many times I'm just touching the highlights have you heard him say that you're diging into it he says there'll be young people come will dig into this and make it live amen so what's built upon the word or built upon the message is not different to the foundation amen it's like people start off like like it's very easy people can take quotes and scriptures and they end up with a dining room instead of a bathroom when the foundation's a bathroom so for example how the Bible says we should not be une yolked right so so that's the foundation but then people can say I don't want to build my life upon that and say well I could win them to Christ and then like the Philippian Jailer call upon the name of the Lord and thine and thy house shall be saved so they take scriptures and quotes and twist it to make their own ends and they don't have a bathroom they've got a dining room you're following me right we want to whatever the foundation is we going to build upon that amen so whatever the foundation is the building matches the foundation amen amen we got to be careful how we build it's either hay wood and stubble that's that's all man's ideas it'll be burnt in the fire or is it gold and precious stones is it Revelation built upon built upon it remember because theory is just idea and we should never even preachers should never preach ideas we should preach Revelation whatever is real should be preached amen if it's Theory we'll just say it's Theory and start off with that that's fine but it shouldn't be Theory it should be a revelation am mean so the word must become real before it can be manifested I mean before it can be preached amen like just like brother R when he preached sermons they weren't sermons they were Revelation it was divine revelation being preached to be received into a body of people and it would manifest the word amen that the word that was preached would put on flesh amen because we know that the prophets of old did not decide what to say that's right they did not say Moses did not say thus sayith Moses or thus saith Paul or thus thus sayith Peter or James or John no they were moved by the Holy Ghost that's why it says in second Peter 1 it says knowing this verse that no Prophecy of the scripture is of any private interpretation so it's not well I've studied this out I've worked it out therefore it's my interpretation or this group over here no because for the prophecy came not in Old Time by the will of man but holy men of God spake as our moved by the Holy Ghost amen that that's how that's how the that's how the prophecy of the scripture came men of all were moved am mean when Paul would be sitting in jail writing he was moved upon by the spirit of God and whatever the spirit gave him revelation of he wrote down and sent to the church is amen what brother BR preached wasn't his own idea he says this is not my own idea it was God's word being being spoken amen so if it's God's word being spoken then we can build our lives upon it amen because it will dovetail with the scripture you know some people have gone off say we don't need the Bible anymore no we do need the Bible we've been returned back to the truth of the scripture I me we've been returned back to the pages of the Bible amen the bride is in the word amen hallelujah this is who we are so we're not running off with one idea you see denomination starts with a good idea they run off on a tangent instead of staying with God and God revealing more see if the lutherans just stayed with the just shall lived by faith and kept walking with God and God unveiled more than they would have become the methodists and there would have been a Methodist Church who have still been Lutheran or even the Catholics if you go back a bit further if they stayed with god with the original revelation of the word the Catholic denomination would never have been birthed because they would have stayed with God and then then then the Reformation would never need to have happened because the the truth would have stayed but they ran off with Theory and we don't want to run off with Theory cuz theory has dead ends with still births and no reality of God and so we don't want that kind of thing we must take every Revelation that we say we received and take it back to the scripture amen if it don't line up with the scripture put it in the recycle bin and hit delete okay amen now brother Brown was asked one day it's interesting how this in the unveiling of God he says when someone is um so someone was saying to him a theologian brother Braham if if the Lord God said if you with your experience that the Lord had given you for his people humbly saying this said you would have be you'd be eligible to write a Bible yourself your word if God has manifested I said that might be true see he was trying to catch me see I said but you see I couldn't do that he said why couldn't you you have all the qualifications I said but you look one word cannot be added or taken away and he said well then them seven Thunders you see he said wouldn't them seven Thunders blasting out wouldn't that be a revelation that was given to some man I said no sir it would be adding something or taking it um be adding to it or taking something from it it's all revealed in there he's speaking about the scripture and the Seven Seals opened up the revelation of that of what it that was that's what it was see it's still in the word you see you can't get out of that word you can't leave the word and God's spirit will never leave that word it'll stay right with the word blinding some and opening the eyes of other it always does that amen so any true revelation will stay in the word you know it's the spirit of God CU it takes you back into the entire scripture not just one isolated Point somewhere amen I trust I trust you're following me tonight am mean see this is very important we just just we don't run off on a tangent somewhere because it feels good I mean David would have felt pretty good dancing with all his might and playing and everything it would have felt really good but yet the ark was carried the wrong way it was an actually a an antichrist move there because it wasn't according to the word and anything that's Antichrist is actually against the word it looks like the word but it's not the word it's not the full word of God we're going to stay with the entire word of God Amen it's very very important amen Isaiah would say to the law and to the testimony if they speak not according to this word it's because there's no light in them so you got to speak according to the word amen if remember if the spirit The Same Spirit that inspired the prophets of old to write the Bible comes into you amen you will speak according to that word cuz the same author cuz remember the first five books of the Bible aren't moses' writings they're God's writings through Moses Isaiah's writings we call it the book of Isaiah but it's God's writings through Isaiah Jeremiah all them down through the you all of the all the prophets it's God writing through them speaking through them it was recorded the same thing in the New Testament era so the spirit of the the author of the book comes into you the Holy Ghost ghost then you will speak according to the word amen you see now David was inspired he was inspired to do what he did but his inspiration wasn't checked with the scripture he see David and God could talk to Hezekiah of course but he um but but he made certain channels you understand it God has has has his own set way of doing things sending revivals talking speaking whatever it is he has to he has his way of doing it and we are nobody to tell him how to do it he does it the way it pleases him to do it so you see David being inspired now remember you remember I said the anointing the false anointing remember the Holy Spirit can come and anoint a person and it's and it's still out of the will of God like balam was anointed with the spirit of God in numbers but he was not in the will of God CU he was fighting the program of God I mean here it proves it right here see we have to go through God's way of doing it not our ways God's way of doing it cuz David being a king anointed Anointed with the spirit of God upon him a top of Jesus Christ but that wasn't God's Channel and all the congregation it pleased them the Bible said no as captains of thousands of hundreds also the priests and the theologians thought it was wonderful there is your Bible schools everything else they thought it was wonderful even all the people agreed and the priests and all them agreed that the king's anointing was right notice but God had not promised to reveal his word in its season to them God has his way of revealing his word but not to the m it was contrary to God so all that move of God was actually contrary to God of David putting the Ark on the new cart and doing all the all the singing all the all the ceremony all the worship was actually contrary to how God wanted it to be see we got to be careful we can't go by feeling we can't go by even atmosphere of of caught up into something we got to go take it back to the word of God everything must be subject to the word of God Amen and if it lines up with the word praise God if it doesn't line up let's forget about it amen because remember we don't need to play guessing games anymore down through the age was guessing games this Theologian said this this one said this this one debated this and this and this but now God has opened his full word of God through Malachi 4 amen amen so we don't have to guess the way he wants it to be amen it's the same thing with Ministry we don't need to make up our own types amen you know if God has a inspired you you know all time with what's already been spoken amen that that's how you know it's true amen you know it won't go out of the scripture and and just it as your own idea it will be all of God amen amen that's why we've got to sub that's what I said before doesn't matter how real it may be how exciting it may be it must be subject to the word of God the word the the inspiration must become subject to the word not the other way around he says and my sisters who want to be woman preachers and so forth don't miss this no matter how much your anointing is you've got to get it in God's provided position and God uh David's anointing was all right but in doing it he got enthused and stepped over the boundary line what was that boundary line the word of God so he got enthused hey basically he would have said Brethren the ark must come into the city we want God's presence in our city we don't want it over that hill we don't want it in that Village we want it in the center of Israel God has given us this land he's been such a good god we've got to return the ark back he got enthused because remember David was unusual in a way he just said as as the heart panish for the water Brook so my soul Longs after God and he said that heart is a deer needs water it must must get to water to survive and that was the longing David had he had he wanted to get into the presence of God so he had such a longing to be there he was real enthused but he didn't subject his enthusiasm to the word if he just did that user would never have died right the C would never have been built amen it would have been carried on the shoulders of the priests you see but because of his enthusiasm and his influence on the people they thought it was a good idea remember not one of them said hold on David have you asked Nathan hold on David have you read in Leviticus how the ark should be carried not one of them said that because of David's influence was so great among the people and that's why to be real careful doesn't matter how influential someone may be take it back to the scripture we're actually obligated every one of us to take everything that's preached take it back to the scripture amen if you can't find it in the scripture then just pray about say Lord if it's there show me if it's not well may I just forget about it it's very important we take everything how we live how we treat our families how we treat one another how we treat Sinners on the street it must be according to the scripture amen it must never be with a arrogant proud Spirit you don't see the New Testament Church arrogant and proud no they are Meek humble people amen and God added to the church as many as should be saved why because through them God got a hold of them who wants to live that kind of a life amen so we must take it can be see this seemed like a great idea I think it was a good idea I would like the ark there come come let's be real you know let's be honest I would have been them dancing too praise God here comes the ark Hallelujah this went across the Red Sea oh no didn't went you know went through the Wilderness after SI and all these it went across Jordan Joshua you know you know part of the Jordan and our fourbears came through and all these things I would have been excited if I didn't take the enthusiasm subjected to the word you see and this is what David he didn't consult the right channel that's why he overstepped the boundary line what did he do he stepped over the boundary line instead of putting the Ark in its original position he carried it on a new cart not over the hearts of the Levites see this is what we got to be real careful when we're when we're studying the word we don't go over the boundary line into into something that's not there into a type that doesn't exist right something new CU maybe David would have thought well we've been here about 400 years let's let's have church a little differently to excite the people let's let's generate some enthusiasm now if the word is carried right it will generate enthusiasm because the anointing will be there it will excite the people it'll attract the people if the word is carried right but you see maybe he thought well we're going to do it a modern way hey the Philistines did it this way we just got to fit and let's do it this way see and he was enthused he is sincere but it wasn't according to the word he stepped over the boundary line see that's why it's always God's original plan works amen I think we should stay with God's original plan it was supposed to be carried on the shoulder of the Levites which is over the heart the word is not in the mind it's in the heart see if it's in the mind I'll say it's a theory but if it's in the heart it's a revelation that's why we should speak and preach and teach Revelation you say well we're going to have a lot of reoccurring sermons well that's fine as long as it's Revelation see see Noah preached 120 years and you know what the conclusion of his sermon would have been the world's going to be flooded get in the ark 120 years how I don't know how many sermons he preached that maybe preached every day oh there's a new worker comes along maybe some new people walking along the road to see what's going on on this Hilltop he would have started preaching maybe all different kind of angles he would have ended up with the same conclusion but because it was Revelation it was living amen that's why brother Adam says if you don't know what to say just say how your candle got lit cuz that's Revelation that's real I met God he changed my life he cleansed me up he he he made me a new creation I wasn't looking for him he was looking for me it's it's unmerited Grace hallelujah amen see the word is not in the mind it's in the heart not on a new cart what was it some represented something new David did there spoke of every denomination there ever be God's word is not to be carried by state PR presor or Bishops and so forth of denominations it's the baptism of the Holy Ghost in the heart of man and not in some EAS ecclesiastical move the holy spirit is a treasure of go of God's love in the heart of men and women to obey see my sheep know my voice where should that voice be on the inside not not an external teacher it must be an internal teacher amen we're about to put a step wrong that's a contrary to the word there should be a voice and you say stop that doesn't please me yeah I want you to Walk This Way amen don't you love that kind of Correction yes where God speaks on the inside maybe no one else is around you but you God's there the shepherd's there Hallelujah I love that kind of a leadership amen hallelujah and because of it says it doesn't please you it's like I'm please me it's like Lord I just want to please you okay I'm going to go another way amen I remember when I was young young believer and and I was going to my uh like first ever kind of camp we had down at brother Gregs and I was I was at Uni and there were two ATMs at University one was by the uh admin building the other one was round by the front door of the student Pub that I used to live in quite a lot before I met God before he took me out of that place and then I went to the ATM by the um admin building and it wasn't working so I went to and the only other one was by the pub I thought well I'm just going to go get the money out and walk away I get round this other big building that was deafening the noise of the place and as soon as that music Started blasting well I could hear it a voice s to me said I don't want to go there see the Lord said he didn't say you don't want to go there he says I don't want to go there so said okay Lord you don't want to go there I'm not going I've got the money somewhere else I found it somewhere else but you see it should be an inside voice amen that's still Small Voice that speaks to us amen you see we've got to keep the word in continuity it's fundamental we don't just take one scripture one quote and just run wild with it like David did we got to have from Genesis to Revelation it's got a doveet tail this is this is a these things are important yes Amen brother Bram tells us that there's three things we must not do he says this there's three musts in the scripture and using God's word there's three things you must not do now remember this is not just for Ministry this is for individuals this is for everyone right now let's study those for the next 10 minutes three things you must not do and all out in the land wherever you are Across the Nation be sure to put these things in your mind if you haven't got a pencil you must not do these these things we um we tell you all the time what you must do now I'm going to tell you what you must not do now you must not you must not misinterpret the word you say well I believe it means this it means just what it says amen it needs no interpreter and you must not misplace the word and you must not dislocate the word and if we would do either of these it throws the whole Bible in a confusion and in a chaos and I say it throws a whole life into a confusion and a chaos amen so we must not do those things we not we must not misinterpret dislocate or displace the word says notice to misinterpret Jesus in the form of God and a man you make him uh you would make him one God out of three to misinterpret Jesus Christ being the word you would make him one God out of three or you would make him the second person in a godhead so you must because remember he is the Lord God Almighty and he is his word amen so it's very fundamental how brother Bram says to leave God in order to do that you leave the word because if you've left the word you've left God that's why we want to stay with the word Above All Things stay with the word amen if you want deity in your midst welcome and receive the word the brother says in the church age book amen it says and to do that you would miss the whole scripture up You' never get nowhere so it must not be misinterpreted and if you say that a certain thing you put an interpretation on it and you apply it to another time or it's been applied to another time then uh you also make an incorrect interpreting if anybody misinterpret Jesus Christ in the Bible of not being God himself make him the second person or God out of three this would upset every word in the entire Bible it would break the first commandment Thou shalt not have any other God before me all right it would make the whole Christian race of a bunch of pagan worshippers worshiping three different gods see what kind of a Bible you would have then it would make us what the Jews say we are said which one of them Gods is your god see so you see you can't you mustn't misinterpret the Bible that's why I like Thomas when Jesus rose and said put your hand in my side and in the and the holes in my hand hands he said to doubting Thomas and Thomas said my Lord and my God Amen he says basically your God manifested he had the right Revelation and that Revelation has been restored in this end time to you and I amen it is actually the most important revelation of the entire scripture that Jesus Christ is the Lord God Almighty amen amen for Jesus himself is the interpretation of the Bible when he made when he's made manifest in the age that's part uh that the part of his body has been being made manifest if it's a hand age it must be a hand it can't be a head age if it's a voice age then then it can't be a foot age see and now we're at the eye age and next is he himself to come seeing prophetic see down through the age we started off from the foundation from the first church age when the seed went uh in the ground the complete seed that come out through the feet Luther come back then through Wesley then into the Pentecostals the tongues and the lips see now it's in the eyes prophetic of Malachi 4 and so forth and now there's nothing left for it but uh for it to come but himself to step into that cuz that's the last thing there is so what is that last thing God is in his people once again am mean God has poured himself emptied himself out amen into his bride body Hallelujah that's why it's more than just works it's more than just gifts of the Spirit it is the giver himself stepping in and manifesting every promise of God that the bride would manifest glory to God Amen we're living in that day amen we don't misinterpret put in another age or even in the future it's now I mean where brother Bram said that the son of man is manifested in a group of people and men and women not just in him a singular man but now in a body around the world Hallelujah so this the son of man is being revealed again in human flesh amen the next thing is the intelligence see it's so important we have the mind of Christ I mean you can't have carnal mind of man like David did he had a carnal understanding Aron a cart brought death but if you have spiritual mind you'll have life amen if you had the right if he went to the right channel he was enthused we want this Ark to come into the city how can it be done Nathan how can it be done and Nathan would say thus sayith the Lord my Levites have been consecrated unto me let them carry me into the city let me let them carry my Ark into the city amen there would not have been death there would have been life amen hallelujah I'm so thankful we can carry the word of God I mean we're priests unto our unto our God we can carry that Revelation in our hearts amen not in a man-made idea of a theory in our mind minds but in our hearts we can pack the word of God hallelujah just like those priests carried the ark that day hallelujah amen you know you know carrying the ark actually brings an entrance into the new land amen the the Levites were told by Joshua to carry the ark into the River Jordan amen and when they stepped into that River at part of that River and then they then the Israelites would cross over into the promised land amen if you're carrying the ark amen you can be a man woman or child but if the Holy Ghost is in you amen you can actually speak an entrance speak eternal life amen that someone could cross over from the Wilderness through death to self into the baptism of the Holy Ghost hallu amen I believe it amen hallelujah amen see it's his we have no sight of our own how can a man foresee those things he can't do it it's God himself see it's it's it's it's coming to a place and he's governed the body all the way through then the complete body of Christ is revealed in the form of a bride that was taken out of his side like Adam did at the beginning like Adam's was rather at the beginning yes God this would set the entire I mean the whole Bible in a confusion what by misinterpreting dislocating it would break the first commandment make God a pagan God of three it would just ruin the whole Bible uh picture of the Bible so you must not uh so you must not misinterpret the word now there's just that one thing when every scripture in the Bible has the same application you've got to set it in its place and to misplace it you might have him God in one age the next age you make him a history to misplace it that's why it's so important to realize God leave in 1965 amen the pillar of fire is still present the angel of the Lord is still walking among his people amen it's not a yeah God lived back there but now he's not here anymore he's still the same one I mean he still does the same things he still manifests his word today he hasn't changed one bit but if you think he's changed one bit then youve misplaced the scripture we don't want to misplace any Scripture amen he is God all the time if you made him if you made him today a god of history that was back Yonder and he isn't the same today what you what are you going to do with with Hebrews 138 is the same yesterday today and forever I mean now to see what this would do and what it has done it's already done it made him uh make him deny his own word to misplace the scriptures to dislocate the scriptures you might put his body together wrong the feet where the head should be or something just the same or other words you might have Jesus teaching Moses message or you might have Wesley teaching Luther's message you might have now in our age teaching a Pentecostal the pent apostal message you see what a mess it would be in see we're not here to preach the former the word of a former age we're here to preach the re revelation of this age amen which is Luther Wesley Pentecost all added together plus The Giver himself see God is not a god of subtraction he he's a god of addition I will restore all the years the Palm worm the canor the Locust the caterpillar have eaten I will restore it all back amen and that's what God has done in this day he has brought it all back see we don't have we don't just look and say well they had that back there we have all that manifestation we have the just shall live by faith we have that manifestation Lord amen we're being Sanctified amen we have that manifestation we have the gifts of the Spirit amen we have that manifestation but now he himself has stepped in to a body to manifest the entire word I say by God's grace we have that manifestation I'm looking at it here hallelujah if you have received the true baptism of the Holy Ghost you're that hallelujah amen so if we sick with the word we will not be in a mess he says Pentecost has already showed its colors Luther's already showed his went off into denomination it died right there the age stuck and there it went amen but we just keep walking on Amen but what we have received doesn't deviate from the Bible we don't have another Testament of Jesus Christ like the Mormons we have the scripture amen that's why you can go to countries like the first time went to Papa New Guinea I teach the message preach the message from the scripture didn't even quote brother Bram once and they said where'd you get this from well here it is here's the light for the a your eyes came open they came out of Darkness got baptized name of the Lord Jesus Christ and walked in newness of life because the elect will see the message in the scripture and the elect whether they know it or not their absolute is the scripture cuz they're built that way amen they may not be living it at first but when light strikes them they'll say this word is my absolute am hallelujah hallelujah amen I trust it's yours amen it's not your opinion it is the word of God is your ab amen you've got to have you got to have an absolute amen hallelujah it can't be yourself otherwise you're a one person denomination we don't want to be like that amen so we want to those three things we must not do we must not dislocate the scripture like someone gets a dislocated shoulder we don't want to place it in a wrong place it could be nearly quite right but it's not quite right amen like like being baptized in the name of the father son Holy Ghost as titles that's nearly right but it's not cor it's dislocated cuz what's the name I'm a father I'm a son I'm a brother I'm an uncle I'm a nephew I'm a New Zealander that's none of those in my name my name is Benjamin John glin and so when Peter came full of the Holy Ghost and said repent and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the mission of sin he wasn't contradicting the word of Jesus in Matthew 28 he wasn't dislocating nothing no he was the Revelation had come that's the name remember REM remission of sins will be preached in his name starting at Jerusalem how they do it baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen that is the name there's only one name given under Heaven by which men must be saved amen people will preach in his name pray in his name do all kind of things in name but take on his name that's all together a different thing but the bride will take on his name gladly amen they want to be identified with his word they want to be identified with every part of him amen amen amen things that are misplaced people seem to misplace scriptures these days oh where did that one go about Holiness it just gets misplaced but the bride doesn't misplace it amen cuz they've got the real interpretation of the word amen and to misinterpret making God three or five or you know it's amazing people take a manifestation of God and they call it a God so if you go through the AL you take Abraham God revealed himself many different forms to Abraham he was Lord God Almighty is mesc Paul says he had without father or mother beginning or end malchis was God he wasn't a human he wasn't a lineage right he wasn't a priesthood and then he was alai different ones God revealed himself different forms to Abraham now God didn't Abraham didn't say well I'm serving five or Trinity whatever he you it's the same God revealing himself in different forms and it's the same God down through the New Testament just reveals himself in a different form amen but you see God's name doesn't change in the New Testament because Jesus Christ Jesus means Jehovah's salvation amen that that is the meaning of the name of Jesus Amen so God the the highest name of God is G the Lord Jesus Christ amen why what's the what's the Salvation from is it from a natural slavery like in in Egypt no it's from a far greater slavery of sin and unbelief amen the chains of hell and darkness we've been liberated amen we've we we we have experienced the power of that name I trust you have amen Glory huj Hallelujah but you see it's very important we stick with the word because if we don't then God will spew us out of his mouth we'll no longer speak for him I mean we don't want to speak for we we don't we call this place Shak Tabernacle cuz we need a name but we don't speak for a church amen we are the Bride of Jesus Christ right see the complaint against this age this ly and church age we live in Rich increase with Goods have need of nothing this is this age we liveing but he says that you know this you know but the complaint is lukewarmness and the penalty of this lukewarmness says because you're neither hot nor cold I'll spew the out of out of my mouth now we know that this this um this spewing out of his mouth is the people who are lukewarm no longer speak for him God can't use them to speak life God can't anoint those people to Speak Life of their lukewarm now lukewarmness is actually a lack of conviction is is is one of the descriptions of it and so if someone becomes lukewarm about the truth it's because there something else has become more important right so so it goes from the pure word of God but then if a Theory comes in that's contrary to the word but it sounds more exciting and people go towards that and they become lukewarm towards the word right we don't want to be lukewarm towards the word we want to be red hot amen amen let's be lukewarm towards man's idea see I'm not interested in even my own thinking what do you think about it I actually don't care what does the Bible say what does the message say you know I got this problem what does the word say about it you know I think I you I I think it's how we should be Lord I feel this way well what does the word say oh well it's different to my feelings kick the feeling out you know take the word amen it's very important we do that because the devil will use our feelings against us to walk contrary to the word of God just like David he was enthused about bringing the ark but he's doing it contrary to the word of God Amen I was going to read this from the church age book we are going to look at this carefully it says that this ly in church age group is lukewarm this lukewarmness demands a penalty from God the penalty is that they will be spewed out of his mouth there is where we don't want to go astray as a lot of folks do they very unwisely say that God can spew you out of his mouth and that proves there there's no such thing or any truth of to the doctrine of the perseverance of the Saints I want to correct your thinking right now this verse is not given to an individual it's given to the church he is talking to the church furthermore if you just keep uh if you just keep the the word in mind you'll recall that nowhere does it say that we are in the mouth of God we're engraved on his palms we're carried in his bosom way back in the known ages before time we're in his mind we are in his Sheepfold and we are in his pastures but never in his mouth but what is in the mouth of the Lord the word is in his mouth Matthew 4:4 and but he answered and said it is written man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceeds out of the mouth of God the word is supposed to be in your mouths too now we know that the church is his body it is here taking his place what will be in the mouth of the church the word 1 Peter 4:11 If any man speak let him speak as the oracles or the word of God so if if his word is in your mouth it's not you speaking it's him speaking and I want him to speak I don't want me to speak I want him to speak even when we're on the street going back our daily life I want him to speak amen amen am mean the word is supposed to be in your mouths too right wait 1 Peter 4 yes okay uh 2 Peter 1:21 for the prophecy came not in all time by the will of man but holy men of God spake as are moved by the Holy Ghost then what is wrong with these people of the last days they've gotten away from the word they're no longer fervent about it they are lukewarm about it he says I'm going to prove it to you right now he says the Baptists have their Creeds and dogmas based on the word and you can't shake them they say the apostolic days of Miracles are over and there's no baptism with the Holy Ghost subsequent to believing the methodists say based on the word that there's no water baptism sprinkling is not baptism and that sanctification is the baptism with the Holy goost baptism in the Greek means to be immersed that's why he's saying a sprinkling is not a baptism right the Church of Christ mjes in regeneration of baptism and in all too many cases they go down dry Sinners and come up wet ones yet they claim their Doctrine is word-based go right down the line and come to the Pentecostals do they have the word give them the word test and see they'll sell out the word for a sensation about just every time if you can produce a manifestation like oil and blood and tongues and other signs whether in the word or not or whether properly interpreted from the word the majority will fall for it but what has happened to the word the word has been being put aside by all these other things amen so God says I'm going against you all I'll spew you out of my mouth this is the end for for out of seven of Seven Ages I've seen nothing but man esteeming his own word above mine so at the end of this age I'm going to spew you out of my mouth it's all over I'm going to speak right yes I am in the midst of the church the aming of God faithful and true will will reveal himself and it will be by my Prophet oh yes it is so Revelations 10:7 and the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery God should be finished as he ha declared to his servants the prophets there it is he's sending a Vindicated Prophet he's sending a prophet after almost 2,000 years he sending someone who'll be so far from organization education and the world world of religion that as John the Baptist and Elijah of olded he will hear only from God and he will have thus sayi the Lord and speak for God he'll be God's mouthpiece And he as it is declared in Malachi 4:6 will turn the hearts of the children back to the fathers he'll bring back the elect of the last day and they will hear a Vindicated Prophet give the exact truth as it was with Paul he will restore the truth as they had and those elect with him in that day will be the ones who truly manifest the Lord and will be his body and be his voice and perform his Works Hallelujah do you see it amen that's why it's so important to be restored back to the truth of the word that we his body his voice and perform his Works amen amen praise the Lord amen he says this here I'm just I'm just I'm just jumping down a bit he says now he has cried out in this last age you have the word you have more Bibles than ever but you're not doing anything about the word except dividing and hacking into pieces taking what you want leaving out what you don't want you're not interested in living it but debating it i' sooner you are hot or cold if you are cold and rejected it I could stand that but if you but if you would get white hot to know its truth and live it I'd praise you for that but when you simply take my word and don't honor it I in return must refuse to honor you I'll spew you out of my mouth you nauseate me we don't want to be like that where we just take his word but don't how do you honor his word let it change you that's how you truly honor the word of God let it change you amen if it's a direct pole opposite to you you change that you match the word see we our experience must much must match God's Bible right we don't twist the word to make it match our experience no our experience must match the Bible amen hallelujah amen now I'm sorry for all the reading but I just need to get through the see brother BR says now that's the reason you hear on tape say what the tape say say what the vision says so basically say what the word says don't deviate from that word right stay with the foundation stay with the blueprint stay with the word of God Amen because if we leave the word then Revival dies you want to kill Revival leave the word if you want to go from a a joy of God joy unspeakable full of glory and go into coldness and indifference leave the word right if you want the peace of God to leave your heart leave the word you can't have the peace of God that passes all understanding and leave the word you can't have joy unspeakable and full of glory and leave the word you can't have a sound mind and leave the word you can't do it though see see people want all the benefits of being a Believer without being a Believer people want all the benefits of being a Christian without a death to self and becoming one being born again so you can't have the benefits of Faith by living in unbelief you can't do that and we'll probably go into that in a future time but you know you can't have those things if if you want peace at pass who wants peace at pass all understanding who wants join spigle full of Glory who wants a Shepherd to guide them in times of trouble who wants him to comfort you amen when you're troubled who wants him to guide you you who wants him to stabilize your walk stabilize your thing give you a sound mind well then stay with the word am it's that simple amen it is that simple who wants Revival stay with the word what is a real Revival you awaken to who you are in the word that's why when the people from America came over to Wales in the Welsh Revival they see that see that policeman swinging around his Bat and whistling I'm so glad I can S one of them or something you know they say good sir we're looking for the Welsh revival can you tell me where it is he says I am the Welsh Revival Hallelujah why because the word came open to the policeman he realize he's more than a man from Wales and a policeman he's a Son of God am me it was an Awakening took place in his life I don't know where he came from it doesn't matter but it was it was quickened to him that he's part of the word amen you want that to leave you leave the word if you want spiritual Amnesia we can't remember who you are where you're going where you came from leave the word but if you want to know who you are and you want to know your true identity stay with the word stay in the word amen this world cannot tell you who you are doesn't matter if you get a DNA test and it traces your lineage back to whoever that doesn't actually tell you who you truly are amen no the word of God tells you your real identity amen and if you stay with it stay with what the messenger gave amen then you'll have Revival Revival will not die down like I've got underlined there it will get greater amen what the word will become more alive amen we must learn the necessity of only to speak what the messenger has spoken amen see Paul warned the people to say only what he said 1 Corinthians 14:37 If any man think himself to be a prophet or spiritual let him acknowledge the things that I write unto you are the Commandments of the Lord so if you're spiritual you'll recognize the word is not just Theory ideas or an opinion it is thus sayith the Lord amen what came the word out of you from you or did it come unto you only I say the word came to me did the word find you it came to you amen they add here take away there and soon the message is no longer pure what happens they take their own ideas like David put the Ark on a cart and it was no longer pure the the Revival right and the Revival dies down how can careful you must be to hear one voice for the spirit has but one voice which is the voice of God and if you know the shepherd you know his voice you know when it's God speaking and the devil pretending to be God speaking and you're not guessing to work out which one it is cuz you know the voice of the shepherd I trust you know his word so well you know that in inside voice so well that when the Devil comes along to to try and masquerade like God you know you're a phony buddy amen you know I trust you know him you know the Shepherd that well you know the best way to um you know they used to uh train people to to to work out what counterfeit money is you know how they did that they got them to study the genuine enough if you study the genuine enough not from an intellectual standpoint we say God open your word to me reveal it to me Lord you wrote this book I need to know show it to me Lord then you'll see the counterfeit amen let's just finish with this cuz I feel like I've gone on a bit now now in every age it is the same cry hear what the spirit says if you're a Christian who's a Christian today you will get back to what the spirit is teaching that is the word of this age every Messenger to every age W will preach that word every fresh and true Revival will be because men has gotten back to the word for their age amen so if you want a true Revival in your own life get back to the word how do you will you say but I'm a message believer if your opinions are contrary to the message you've got to lay aside the opinion and take the word and that's how you get back to the word amen right you say well I've been taught it this way take it back into the word study it yourself look into the scripture you'll see it all tied together God will show it to you amen this is why you know see every fresh and true Revival I just want to repeat this because I like it every fresh and true Revival will because men have gotten back to the word for their age The Cry of every age is the rebuke you have left the word of God repent come back to the word from the first book book in the Bible Genesis to the last book Revelation there's only one reason for God's displeasure leaving the word and there's only one remedy to regain his favor come back to the word I want the grace and favor of God on my life amen so H well how do I get that surrender to the word of God let it change us let it mold us let it shape us that it's not our opinion or this Theory or you know I think sometimes people can carry around a book of second opinions oh yeah and they make it dog you they make it scripture they make it midrash you know that's something that Israelites make up phrases and make it scripture they call it midrash if you want to get rid of the midrash and get healed get back to the word there's a bom and Gilead that will fix it real good amen now let's have the musicians tonight let's just let's just stop right there but who wants to you know who wants to walk with God stay with his word don't run off on fantastic ideas don't run off on a good idea don't even run off on a bad idea that makes you you feel condemned stay with the word of God amen amen stay with what's real to you and let God reveal more amen amen if it's being if it's become a re Revelation to you that you're a son or daughter of God stay with that because the devil will try and make you leave that but if it's revealed to you I'm his child we just keep walking on to more from there right say Lord reveal more to me Lord there's more of your truth Lord I want to I want to know more of you yes sir amen can we sing that song word of God ever true changing me changing you can we sing that let's stand tonight shall we amen we'll probably pick this up another time holy word long preserve for our walk in this world they ReSound with God's Own Heart oh let the word of God impart sorry I've been a bit long tonight let's just Worship the Lord

your grace we are your children and Lord we don't want to walk with our own opinions we don't want to stray away with our own theories Lord father may we never be like David Lord just got enthused
