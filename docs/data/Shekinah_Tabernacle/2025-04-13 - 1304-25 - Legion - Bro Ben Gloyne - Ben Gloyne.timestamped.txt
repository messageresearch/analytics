[4:12] Good
[4:14] Morning. How are you this morning?
[4:17] Good. We were sitting in the side room
[4:20] uh standing in the side room there this
[4:21] morning. We just have a bit of a
[4:24] um talk. I actually had left my
[4:28] um uh radio mic on when when I was
[4:31] talking in there, too. I got we got a
[4:32] text from um James. He said, "Turn your
[4:34] mic off." But it wasn't coming through
[4:36] here, was it? Feel cuz the things I was
[4:39] saying in there. No, I'm joking.
[4:42] We did joke about that match if we was
[4:44] talking about you guys in there, but we
[4:47] wouldn't. And if we did, it was all
[4:52] good. You're thinking, I wonder if he
[4:54] would or not. We never ever talk bad
[4:56] about anyone in there, do we?
[4:59] No. No. We talk we actually hassle each
[5:03] other in there, but that's all right cuz
[5:05] we can. But I was in there and um I was
[5:09] actually standing on this side and the
[5:10] the sun was beaming through the window
[5:12] here like it was here and it was just
[5:15] shining on me and like it's it's a
[5:16] reasonably cold morning but you feel the
[5:18] warm sun just coming and
[5:21] shining on me and I thought you know and
[5:24] the natural all types of spiritual in
[5:26] the natural I've got this warm sun and
[5:27] it's just warming me up making me feel
[5:28] so good and I thought you know that's
[5:30] what we want this morning is we want we
[5:32] want that son of God which is just like
[5:34] that sun to to shine on our heart this
[5:36] morning and to warm our heart this
[5:38] morning, you know, and that and when
[5:40] people would go through the prayer line,
[5:42] Brother Brandon would say, "Oh, you're a
[5:43] Christian. I feel a warm spirit about
[5:44] you." You know, and often then you you
[5:47] you' we would reference say if we were
[5:50] in an atmosphere, we would say, "Man,
[5:51] that was a really cold atmosphere or a
[5:53] very cold person." Um, so we don't want
[5:56] that. We we this morning we're going to
[5:59] be our our our hearts are going to be
[6:01] warmed by this son of God this morning.
[6:04] and and that's who we want to come in
[6:06] and shine upon our heart. And as that
[6:09] the there's a song, Lord, may may your
[6:12] face shine upon me. Lord, may the light
[6:14] of your countenance shine upon me. And
[6:16] that's what we want this morning is the
[6:18] the face of God to look upon us and the
[6:20] the warmth and the light of his
[6:22] countenance to shine upon us this
[6:23] morning. So, let's stand this morning
[6:24] and just pray that the Lord would would
[6:27] turn his face towards us this morning.
[6:30] Heavenly Father, we know Lord
[6:32] that where you are, there's always

[6:39] countenance upon us this morning, Lord.
[6:42] That our hearts would be would be warmed
[6:45] up, Lord, by your spirit and by your
[6:47] presence, Lord, as the morning sun warms
[6:50] the earth, Lord, and all the maybe it's
[6:53] a cold winter morning and there's frost
[6:54] and everything and things seem so hard
[6:57] and brittle and and lifeless, Lord. And
[7:00] and and even when there's frost, the the
[7:02] the leaves and everything just get so
[7:04] hard, Lord. But as the sun comes up, it
[7:06] Lord, it melts everything away and
[7:08] things become so soft and life springs
[7:10] forth, Lord. And may that be our
[7:12] testimony this morning as we come to you
[7:14] this morning, Lord. May the light of
[7:16] you, Lord, and the light of your word
[7:18] shine upon us this morning, Lord. That

[7:23] morning, Lord. That our hearts would be
[7:25] warmed by your countenance, Lord, and by
[7:27] your love and by your spirit, Lord. May
[7:29] there be just a nice warm atmosphere
[7:31] amongst us this morning as we just
[7:32] invite you into our presence, Lord.

[7:35] and worship with you, Lord, and to be in
[7:37] an atmosphere, Lord, where there's love,
[7:40] where there's joy, where there's peace,
[7:41] Lord, where there's long suffering,
[7:43] gentleness, goodness, faith, meekness,
[7:45] temperance, Lord, where your spirit is.
[7:47] So, we just invite you here and bless
[7:48] those that couldn't make it this

[40:40] Oops. What have I
[40:42] done? Broken
[40:47] something. That one. Yeah. So, we're
[40:50] going to Luke chapter 8. Bit of a
[40:51] lengthy reading. Um we're going to just
[40:54] read from
[40:56] uh verse
[40:58] 26. So, I just kind of logged out and
[41:01] logged back in. I don't even know how I
[41:02] do these things.
[41:04] Uh but yeah, we can read from from verse
[41:06] 26 and we're going to read down to verse
[41:09] uh 39 here. Oh, we're here. Good.
[41:11] Probably Talia saved the day. Thank you.
[41:13] Appreciate that. Amen. So, uh Luke 8:26.
[41:16] And they arrived at the country of the
[41:18] Gatherines, which is over against
[41:20] Galilee. And when he went forth to land,
[41:23] there met him out of the city a certain
[41:24] man, which had devils um long time, and
[41:28] wear no clothes, neither abode in any
[41:30] house, but in the tombs. When he saw
[41:33] Jesus, he cried out and fell down before
[41:35] him and with a loud voice said, "What
[41:37] have I to do with thee, Jesus, thou son
[41:39] of God most high? I beseech thee,
[41:41] torment me not." For he had commanded
[41:43] the unclean spirit to come out of the
[41:45] man, for off times it had caught him.
[41:47] And he was kept bound with chains and
[41:49] infetters, and he break the bands and
[41:51] was driven of the devil into the
[41:53] wilderness. And Jesus asked him, saying,
[41:56] "What is thy name?" And he said, "Leion,
[41:58] because many devils were entered into
[42:00] him." I'm sorry if you could this is
[42:03] this is died so I mean I don't know if
[42:05] you could drive back there as you are.
[42:07] Thank you. And they besought him that he
[42:09] uh would not command them to go out into
[42:11] the deep and there was uh there a herd
[42:14] of many swine. I just logged in and out.
[42:16] Thank you. Um feeding on the mountains
[42:19] and they besought him that he would
[42:20] suffer them to enter into them and he um
[42:23] and he suffered them. Uh then went the
[42:25] devils out of the man and entered into
[42:27] the swine and the herd ran violently
[42:29] down the steep place into the lake and
[42:31] were choked. When they uh that fed them
[42:34] saw what was done, they fled and went
[42:36] and told it in the city uh and in the
[42:38] country. Then they went out to see what
[42:41] was done and came to Jesus and found the
[42:43] man uh out of whom the devils were
[42:45] departed sitting at the feet of Jesus
[42:47] clothed and in his right mind. And they
[42:49] were afraid. And they also which saw it
[42:52] told them by what means that he that was
[42:55] possessed of the devils was healed. Uh
[42:57] then the whole multitude of the country
[42:59] of the gatherines round about besought
[43:00] him to depart from them for they were
[43:03] taken with great fear. And he went up uh
[43:05] into the ship and returned back again.
[43:08] Now the man out of whom the devils were
[43:10] departed besought him that he might be
[43:12] with him saying Jesus uh but Jesus sent
[43:14] him away saying return to thine own
[43:17] house and show how great things God hath
[43:19] done unto thee. and he went his way and
[43:21] published throughout the whole city how
[43:23] great things Jesus had done unto him.
[43:26] Amen. And just one more scripture in um
[43:28] in Jeremiah chapter 30 and verses uh
[43:32] vers uh 17. We're just going to read a
[43:34] couple of couple of verses here just for
[43:37] a bit of a context. Um oh wonderful.
[43:39] Thank you so
[43:43] much. So we're going to read here.
[43:46] Everyone everyone there. Amen. Good to
[43:49] have um Latabo back as well. God bless
[43:52] you.
[43:53] Amen. Says here Jeremiah 30 and verse
[43:56] 17, for I will restore health unto thee,
[43:58] and I'll heal thee out of thy wounds,
[44:00] sayeth the Lord, because they called
[44:02] thee an outcast, saying, this is Zion,
[44:04] whom no man seeketh after. Thus sayeth
[44:06] the Lord, behold, I'll bring again the
[44:08] captivity of Jacob's tents, and have
[44:10] mercy on his dwelling places, and the
[44:12] city shall be builded upon her own heap,
[44:14] and the palace shall remain after the
[44:15] manner thereof. And out of them shall
[44:17] pro shall proceed thanksgiving proceed
[44:21] sorry thanksgiving and the voice of them
[44:22] that make merry and I'll multiply them
[44:25] and they shall not be few and I will
[44:27] also glorify them and they shall not be
[44:29] small their children also shall be as a
[44:32] four time and their congregation shall
[44:34] be established before me and I will
[44:35] punish all that oppress them. Amen.
[44:38] Let's bow heads in a word of prayer
[44:40] shall we this morning. Amen. And if
[44:42] you've got a need, amen. We got to
[44:43] remember brother Colin, this neck of the
[44:44] mu, uh, neck muscles all stiff and so
[44:46] on. And William's at home unwell. So,
[44:49] uh, and so if you've got a need, just
[44:50] raise your hand. Amen. Let's, uh,
[44:52] approach our Lord together. Almighty
[44:54] God, we want to thank you so much. We
[44:56] can, we can call upon your great name,
[44:58] Lord. The only name given under heaven
[44:59] by which men must be saved, the name of
[45:01] the Lord Jesus Christ. And dear God, as
[45:03] we bow heads, Lord, we just say, have
[45:05] your way in this service, Lord. I want
[45:06] to get myself out of the way, Lord. As I
[45:09] stand before the purchase of your blood
[45:10] here, Lord, your redeemed children,
[45:12] Lord. I don't want to inject anything of
[45:14] my own self, Lord. I pray you'd come and
[45:15] speak to their hearts, Lord. Speak to my
[45:17] heart, too. Father, may you anoint
[45:19] speaker and hear once again. Those who
[45:21] are also streaming, Lord, may you just
[45:23] be so present with them, Father.
[45:25] Wherever they're watching this, dear
[45:26] God, we pray, Lord, I pray go touch
[45:28] William, Father, and make him well,
[45:30] Father. Thank you by your stripes, he's
[45:32] healed, Lord. also brother Colin Father
[45:34] with his neck and it's all stiffened
[45:36] father that Lord from the bike dear God
[45:37] I pray you touch him and give him full
[45:39] flexibility mobility back for your glory
[45:41] and Lord any other need among us dear
[45:43] God you're our high priest of our
[45:44] profession Lord you're the one who who
[45:47] heals us has redeemed us Lord you've
[45:48] done many mighty things so we thank you
[45:50] father that we can commit all of our
[45:52] lives into your hands asking that you
[45:54] would take over this service now for
[45:55] your glory in Jesus Christ's name amend
[45:59] bless you friends you can have your
[46:00] seats uh this
[46:04] Morning. So, I want to take uh if this
[46:07] is kind of a kind of an Easter message,
[46:10] if I could if I could kind of put it
[46:12] that way. Now, we read a bit of a
[46:14] lengthy account of the of the maniac of
[46:16] Gdara, that man that was that was uh
[46:19] demonpossessed there, but the Lord came
[46:21] and came and freed him. Now, I just want
[46:24] to read a bit of a back. This is one of
[46:25] my favorite quotes. This is from the
[46:27] mighty conqueror. I don't know if I have
[46:28] it here exactly. No, I don't. I don't
[46:30] have it on here. Maybe we can just we
[46:32] can blank that because I don't have too
[46:33] much there. But you know this is you
[46:36] know as we stand here well you know as
[46:37] we're here gathered here this morning um
[46:40] this is the day where the Lord uh a week
[46:42] before the Sunday before um the
[46:45] crucifixion where he rode into Jerusalem
[46:47] triumphantly on the back of a donkey.
[46:49] This is this is that time when they all
[46:51] cut down the branches, laid them down
[46:53] and cried hosana to the king. And you
[46:55] know there was a glorious time. But you
[46:57] know, as we stand here and we think of
[46:58] the Easter Easter weekend and that, you
[47:00] know, brother Bram says it's the
[47:02] greatest week that's ever happened in
[47:03] history as a death, burial, resurrection
[47:05] of our Lord Jesus Christ. And I think
[47:07] today we can we can rejoice in that that
[47:09] not just because um you know, we don't
[47:11] look at Easter just as a historical
[47:13] affair. Well, I don't. And and the
[47:15] reason I say that is because we are the
[47:17] beneficiaries of his death, burial, and
[47:20] resurrection. We have received the full
[47:21] benefit of it because the full benefit
[47:23] of him dying on Calvary is that he would
[47:25] come and dwell in you and I. Amen. That
[47:27] God and man would be reconciled. And so
[47:30] as I just um I just want to read this
[47:32] from the great and mighty concrete says
[47:34] he says but to the Christian this
[47:36] morning the victory is won. Joy bells
[47:38] are ringing. The war is over between God
[47:40] and man. The victory has been won.
[47:42] Before any victory can be won there
[47:44] there must be great prices paid. Oh what
[47:46] prices? Sometimes they are very deep.
[47:48] They um they make great scars tearing
[47:51] down. But in order to have the mountain,
[47:52] you've got to have the valley. Before we
[47:54] can have the sunshine, you got to have
[47:56] the rain. Before we can have the light,
[47:58] we've got to get the night. Before we
[48:00] can have right, we got to have wrong. Or
[48:02] we would not have never known what wrong
[48:04] was. But in order to conquer and win the
[48:07] greatest battle that was ever won, one
[48:09] stepped out of glory many years ago. He
[48:11] did not take upon himself the form of an
[48:13] angel. He did not come as some great
[48:15] person. He was going to prove that it
[48:17] didn't take musketss and bullets and
[48:19] atomic bombs to win a war. He clothed
[48:22] himself in humility like a little baby
[48:24] was born in a manger. There was not even
[48:25] a place for his birth when he come. I
[48:28] want you to look at the different
[48:29] material of war here uh warfare what he
[48:32] used. Now Adam's race was all in
[48:34] bondage. There they were without hope,
[48:36] without God, without chance, without
[48:37] mercy, without anything that could help
[48:39] them. The great enemies of the lower
[48:41] regions of the lost had shut them out up
[48:43] in darkness. There was not a way out.
[48:46] There was no one could help. Nothing
[48:48] could be done. It was like a total
[48:49] complete loss. But our hero when he come
[48:52] down from the portals of glory
[48:54] condescending down. There was no man on
[48:56] earth could do the job. They were all a
[48:58] worldly speaking in the same boat. They
[49:00] are all born in sin. We're all born in
[49:01] sin, shaped in iniquity, come to the
[49:03] world speaking lies. And none of us
[49:05] could help each other. We stood
[49:06] helpless, defeated, chaos on every hand,
[49:09] all ununited. We could not keep the laws
[49:11] and ceremonies finding their weakness.
[49:13] and so forth. We could not do it. And it
[49:15] seemed like the whole human race was
[49:17] laid waste. Then he came, he came down
[49:21] because he was in the beginning. The
[49:22] Bible said he was the word. He was the
[49:24] logos that went out of God. And the
[49:26] logos in the beginning was the word. And
[49:28] he became the word. And when he ascended
[49:29] up on that glorious day of Easter, he
[49:31] became not only the word, but he became
[49:33] the high priest of his own word. Oh,
[49:35] what a glorious thing, brother Neville,
[49:36] to think he's not only the word, but he
[49:38] is the high priest of his own word. How
[49:40] could we doubt it? How could we walk to
[49:42] him and not believe that we receive what
[49:45] we ask for? For he is the word and the
[49:47] intercessor of the words. In other
[49:48] words, he is his word and he's the one
[49:50] who brings his word to pass. Amen.
[49:52] Praise the Lord. The the logos became
[49:54] word and the word became flesh and the
[49:56] same flesh that was the word was
[49:57] received up into glory. And now is the
[49:59] high priest making intercession by
[50:01] himself to his word. That's what it
[50:03] takes. That's the material that the
[50:04] church has got. What a weapon. There has
[50:07] never been one like it. He was the word.
[50:09] And when he come, he was born in a
[50:10] manger. He came to use the weapon of lov
[50:13] love to conquer the world. Not with army
[50:16] bullets, not with machine guns and
[50:17] tanks, but he came in a different
[50:18] manner. He came in the form of love. He
[50:20] was God's love. One time as a little
[50:23] boy, I used to think that Christ loved
[50:25] me and God hated me because that Christ
[50:27] died for me. But God had something but
[50:30] but God had something against me. But I
[50:32] come to find out that Christ is the very
[50:33] heart of God. God so loved the world
[50:35] that he gave his only begotten son that
[50:37] whosoever believeth on him should not
[50:39] perish but would have eternal life. Now
[50:41] he come first to conquer. The thing that
[50:43] the devil had put in the world was
[50:45] hatred and he come to conquer hatred.
[50:47] When we win our battles and so forth in
[50:49] the world's battles, it always leaves
[50:51] continually a hatred because battles of
[50:53] that sort is of the enemy. But Christ
[50:55] come with love to conquer hatred to love
[50:57] those who were unlovable. He came with a
[50:59] different weapon and he humbled himself
[51:01] made a little lower than the angels to
[51:03] suffer death to give an example to when
[51:06] he was here on earth. He walked among
[51:07] men. He proved his weapons of warfare
[51:09] when he healed the sick. When he took
[51:11] five little biscuits and two pieces of
[51:13] fish and fed 5,000, he proved that he
[51:16] had the very he had the power over every
[51:18] atomic that there was. Not only did he
[51:20] grow fish, but he cooked fish. Not only
[51:22] did he grow the wheat in those biscuits,
[51:24] he he growed cooked wheat in those
[51:26] biscuits. It showed that he was that
[51:28] great and mighty conqueror. Not only did
[51:30] he get the water from the well, but he
[51:32] made the water, the wine from the well.
[51:33] He proved he had the power to conquer
[51:35] and he loved and his weapon was love.
[51:39] Amen. So, we stand in the greatest uh
[51:41] you know, commemorating the greatest
[51:43] week in history. There's never been a
[51:45] man like our Lord Jesus and there never
[51:47] will be. Amen. He came and conquered
[51:49] everything everything that could be
[51:51] conquered. Now, I'm so thankful as we
[51:53] can be gathered here today and we as as
[51:55] we look back at Easter and look back at
[51:57] the great events that happened 2,000
[51:58] years ago that we're not just looking
[52:00] back at a historical standpoint of of a
[52:03] fact. Amen. But we're looking at it in
[52:05] the reality of it that we have received
[52:08] the whole purpose of it because we know
[52:10] the purpose of it was that Jesus Christ
[52:11] would take the sin of the world upon
[52:13] himself. He would carry them, amen, to
[52:15] Calvary, nail them to his cross. Amen.
[52:18] We would bear them no more. And by his
[52:20] blood, he'd sanctify a people that God
[52:22] could come and dwell in those people.
[52:23] Amen. So if you have the Holy Ghost this
[52:26] morning, you have received the full
[52:27] benefit of Calvary. Praise the Lord.
[52:30] Amen. That's why we can we look more at
[52:32] just an empty tomb. Thank God for the
[52:34] empty tomb that it's in Jerusalem. But
[52:35] we are the living proof that it
[52:38] happened. Amen. Because his life comes
[52:40] and dwells in us, changes our life. We
[52:42] are the vindication. Calvary happened.
[52:45] Praise the Lord. Amen. Praise the Lord.
[52:48] See, we we are the living evidence that
[52:50] there is power in the blood. Amen. Why?
[52:51] Because you've experienced it. Amen.
[52:53] Like Legion with that, you know, that
[52:55] we'll get into. He was he knew the power
[52:57] of deliverance. Amen. He experienced
[52:59] God's delivering power when he could not
[53:01] help himself. He came the great mighty
[53:04] conqueror came down, conquered those
[53:05] devils, drove them out of his life.
[53:07] Amen. And set him free. Amen. So we are
[53:10] the living evidence of that, you know,
[53:12] that the blood works. Amen. that eternal
[53:15] life, you know, Jesus Christ when he
[53:17] died, he he would redeem his people from
[53:20] their sins. Amen. He had cleansed them
[53:21] that he would live in them that through
[53:23] them eternal life might be imparted to
[53:26] others by the life of Christ now in
[53:28] them. Amen. As the Apostle Paul, the
[53:30] Apostle Paul knew the difference of
[53:32] between living a BC life and an AD life
[53:37] after death to self life before Christ.
[53:39] Because before Christ, he was a Pharisee
[53:41] of the Pharisees. Amen. He was scholarly
[53:43] man. He was very devout. You probably
[53:45] could not not put a single finger on his
[53:47] life. But he was just a religious man.
[53:49] And it was his own human ambition to
[53:51] ascend up that ivory tower of religion
[53:53] to become, as he said, the Pharisee of
[53:55] the Pharisees. But when he met the Lord
[53:57] on the road to Damascus, Amen. He became
[53:59] a very different kind of a man. It
[54:01] wasn't his own human works trying to
[54:03] work his way into something. He would
[54:05] tell the Galatians, he says, I am
[54:07] crucified with Christ. He says, I'm
[54:08] dead. Nevertheless, I live, but yet not
[54:10] I. Amen. There's some there's someone
[54:12] else living in me. Christ now lives in
[54:14] me because Christ liveth in me. And the
[54:17] life that I now live in the flesh. I
[54:20] live by the faith of the son of God. So
[54:22] he's saying I used to live a one kind of
[54:24] a life, but now I live a different kind
[54:26] of a life. And I haven't He's saying I
[54:28] haven't traded religions. I haven't
[54:29] traded a better, you know, a bad idea
[54:32] for a better idea. I've met him. I met
[54:35] the master. Amen. So now the life I
[54:37] live, I live by the faith of the son of
[54:39] God. So when you saw Paul's works, it
[54:41] wasn't him doing the works. It was
[54:43] Christ within him. Amen. And the true
[54:45] Christian, we don't do works, he does
[54:47] the works through us. What do we do? We
[54:49] yield ourselves and let him do it. Amen.
[54:51] Praise the Lord. So it's not, oh, do you
[54:53] have enough works or not enough works?
[54:55] No, it's a life that's lived. Amen. And
[54:57] it's it's the expression of the word.
[54:59] It's it's Christ living through us.
[55:01] Amen. It's not us, you know, you know,
[55:03] it's not us humanly doing it, but yet we
[55:06] have a part. What is that? Surrendering.
[55:08] Dying out. Paul said that I would die
[55:10] daily that Christ might live. Amen. So,
[55:13] hallelujah. So, the Apostle Paul knew
[55:14] what it was like to be a religious man.
[55:16] Very dedicated man. His works were very
[55:19] much his own. And they and they pleased
[55:21] man. He got prestige in the sight of
[55:23] man. But when he met the Lord, Amen. his
[55:26] own works ceased and became God's works
[55:28] living through him. Praise the Lord. See
[55:31] if I've got this here. He says this.
[55:33] Brother Bram says as I said in the
[55:34] message he says if Beth Hovind was in
[55:36] you would do the works of Beth Hovind.
[55:39] You would live the life of Bethovven.
[55:41] You couldn't do nothing else. Amen. You
[55:44] couldn't do nothing else. You would have
[55:45] to be Bhovven reincarnated. Amen.
[55:48] Because why? The spirit, the life of
[55:50] Bethovven is in you. You could not stop
[55:52] from writing music. You may say, "I'm
[55:54] never writing another piece of music
[55:55] again." But in your head, in your heart,
[55:57] there'll be symphonies coming out. I
[55:59] mean, there'll be tunes coming out.
[56:01] there be ways to maybe improve other
[56:03] people's songs and different things.
[56:04] Why? Cuz it's Bethovven being expressed.
[56:06] Amen. He says you couldn't do nothing
[56:08] else. You could do nothing else but
[56:09] compose songs. And you'd be the great
[56:12] writer Beethovven because he's in you.
[56:14] That's who you would be. You'd be an
[56:16] reincarnate Bethovven. And if Christ is
[56:18] in you, the life of Christ, you will be
[56:20] the lover of the word. Nothing can stand
[56:23] and take the place of the word because
[56:24] he is the word. He can't deny his own
[56:26] word and remain God. Amen. So it's
[56:29] actually a life. Brother Br makes it
[56:31] very strong. He says it's actually just
[56:32] a life that's automatically lived. You
[56:35] don't have to push it. You don't have to
[56:36] pump it. You just yield to it. And it's
[56:39] a life that's lived out of us. Amen.
[56:41] That's why a real conversion is a real
[56:43] conversion. It's not turning over a new
[56:45] leaf. It's not whitewashing something.
[56:46] No, we get wa washed white by the blood
[56:48] of Jesus Christ. Amen. So now here, you
[56:51] know, the Lord as we as we said read in
[56:54] Jeremiah chapter 30, he says, "I will
[56:56] restore." I was looking at this
[56:58] listening to the restoration of the
[57:00] bride this week and and and the Lord has
[57:02] determined he's going to restore a
[57:04] people. I meant back to their original
[57:07] condition. Now, this original condition
[57:09] is not just making them good moral
[57:11] people. There's those in the world, I'm
[57:13] sure you know many people who are the
[57:15] most Christian non-Christians ever.
[57:18] They have good character. They got good
[57:20] morals. Their word is their bond.
[57:21] They're good, sane,
[57:23] sensible people. But they don't believe
[57:26] the Lord.
[57:27] So God is not restoring us back to just
[57:29] be that. No, he's restoring us back to
[57:32] the image of his word, back to what he
[57:34] thought of us before the foundation of
[57:35] the world that we're just like him.
[57:38] Amen. And then and then he would he
[57:41] would say then so that out of them would
[57:43] proceed thanksgiving and the voice of
[57:45] them that make Mary says, "I'll multiply
[57:47] them and they shall not be a few. I'll
[57:49] glorify them and they shall not be
[57:51] small." See, so Legion Legion needed
[57:54] restoring. Brother Ram says that Legion
[57:57] uh you know we read him as the man in
[57:59] the tombs, right? He didn't start that
[58:01] way. He didn't start as naked,
[58:03] demonpossessed, bound by, you know,
[58:06] broken chains on his wrists and hiding
[58:08] in the tombs. He never started that way.
[58:10] He was actually a good man. Brother
[58:12] Brham said he was actually a churchgoing
[58:14] man. He was married. He had children.
[58:16] That's why Jesus said, you know, go back
[58:18] to your house and show them the great
[58:20] things God has done. Amen. So, so, so he
[58:22] had a family. He had children. And yeah,
[58:24] I'll say I'll say his church that he
[58:26] went to was a message church. But you
[58:28] see what happens is there's always pride
[58:30] before the fall. And so he, you know,
[58:33] and and and I find it amazing that, you
[58:36] know, if you don't know the Lord, but
[58:38] you're around the spirit of God moving,
[58:40] for some reason, it c it brings pride
[58:44] into a carnal believer, someone who's
[58:46] never met the Lord yet. It brings a
[58:47] pride in, brings a brings a comparison
[58:49] in because they see God do things in
[58:51] their midst and they say, "Well, our
[58:53] church is better than the other one. But
[58:55] what about you? What about you and I?
[58:57] What about our walk, our, you know, our
[58:59] individual walk with the, you know, walk
[59:01] with the Lord?" So, he had seen the Lord
[59:03] move in services. He had seen God do
[59:05] many mighty things, but he didn't know
[59:07] him. Amen. But then he began to think he
[59:09] was better than most people. Why?
[59:11] Because he was he had the message of the
[59:12] hour. This is the revealed word of the
[59:14] day. I'm walking in it. You see? And
[59:16] then it's strange
[59:17] how with that pride if it's not if it's
[59:21] not God living in the person pride can
[59:23] creep in. And you know as as um Arman
[59:27] brought out there in Galatians 6 and1 if
[59:28] I've got it. No I don't have it here. He
[59:30] says brethren if a man be overtaken in a
[59:32] fault ye which be ye which are spiritual
[59:35] restore such and one to the spirit of uh
[59:38] in the spirit of meekness considering
[59:40] thyself least thou also be tempted. So,
[59:43] so if anyone is overtaken at a fault,
[59:46] don't
[59:46] criticize. Don't say, "Well, they should
[59:49] have known better." You know, don't
[59:50] don't say, "Well, I'm glad I'm not that
[59:52] person." Cuz that's not the spirit of
[59:54] meekness, right? Someone, you know, is
[59:57] overtaken a fault, they come back, you
[59:59] know, you don't restore them with,
[1:00:00] "Well, you better shape up this time.
[1:00:02] You should know better. I'm, you know,
[1:00:03] all these things." Why? Because if you
[1:00:05] have the wrong attitude towards that
[1:00:06] person, that same thing they're tempted
[1:00:08] with will come upon you. And so we never
[1:00:11] want to get into, you know, that we
[1:00:13] never want to fall into that category,
[1:00:15] but we should, you know, we should never
[1:00:16] have a critical spirit. You know, we
[1:00:18] should never we should never have a
[1:00:19] condescending attitude towards anyone.
[1:00:22] We should always have a spirit of
[1:00:23] meekness. Lord, thank you. You've
[1:00:25] brought them back, Lord. Lord, thank you
[1:00:27] that your blood atones for them. Lord,
[1:00:28] thank you for bringing their thinking
[1:00:30] back and bringing their hearts back to
[1:00:32] you. Lord, thank you. Lord Jesus, you've
[1:00:34] set them free. That's how we should be,
[1:00:36] right? But you see now Legion Legion
[1:00:38] started off as this good moral family
[1:00:40] man but he but he pride came in he be to
[1:00:44] open a door and it's a scary thing you
[1:00:47] know you let one spirit in it opens a
[1:00:50] door for another spirit so he never
[1:00:52] started off as I said as this man in the
[1:00:54] tombs that we read about him in the book
[1:00:55] of Luke here but he started off as a
[1:00:57] normal sane sensible believer but then
[1:01:00] now what happened is is you know pride
[1:01:03] came in and then you know like Brother
[1:01:06] would preach a sermon from that time and
[1:01:07] he'd meet someone who's a habitual liar.
[1:01:09] They can't stop lying. And that person
[1:01:11] said, "Well, it's because when I was
[1:01:13] young, I told a lie to my parents and
[1:01:15] from that time I just can't stop lying.
[1:01:18] There's something in me just can't stop
[1:01:19] it." I mean, I'll tell you what can stop
[1:01:21] it. The blood of Jesus Christ can stop
[1:01:23] it. I mean, remember, there's always a
[1:01:24] way of escape out of every situation. If
[1:01:26] there's a way of escape for Legion,
[1:01:28] there's a way of escape for you and I.
[1:01:29] Praise God. Amen. So, so you can start
[1:01:32] with telling a lie. You know, nowadays
[1:01:34] it's not necessarily smoking behind the
[1:01:35] bike sheds that kids get into. It's what
[1:01:38] are you doing on your phone? What are
[1:01:39] you hiding? You know, some some secret
[1:01:41] sin that they're protecting or someone
[1:01:43] protects. You know, what's that? That's
[1:01:44] telling a lie. You know, it's amazing.
[1:01:46] Um, this has got nothing to do with
[1:01:48] phones or anything, but yeah, I asked
[1:01:49] Lilia the other day, "How was school?
[1:01:50] What did you do?" She said, "Nothing."
[1:01:52] So, I thought, so I asked her, "What?
[1:01:54] Did you stare at a wall all day?" You
[1:01:56] know, but it was nothing. We didn't do
[1:01:58] anything.
[1:02:00] There's always the the nothing is a
[1:02:02] something.
[1:02:04] The nothing is a something, right? So,
[1:02:06] we got to we got to realize, you know,
[1:02:08] we can't protect things because we never
[1:02:12] can see where it'll take us. I doubt
[1:02:14] very much that that that Legion planned
[1:02:17] his life to end up where it did. He
[1:02:20] never expected it to end that way. But
[1:02:22] sin will take you further than you want
[1:02:24] to go and keep you longer there than you
[1:02:26] want to be.
[1:02:28] Amen. You know, people say it's just
[1:02:29] harmless fun. You know, it's a thrill.
[1:02:32] They're looking for thrills or guilty
[1:02:33] pleasures or harmless fun. Is it really
[1:02:35] harmless fun? You know, popularity can
[1:02:38] be such a trap. Now, there's no one
[1:02:39] called John here, eh? No one. Okay, so
[1:02:41] I'll use Legion's name is John. I'm
[1:02:43] going to use John. Okay, so you know,
[1:02:45] popularity can be such a trap to open
[1:02:47] doors to the enemy to drag you out. You
[1:02:49] know, maybe his friends like, "Come on,
[1:02:51] John. Come come have a drink. Come watch
[1:02:53] this thing. You know, come you know,
[1:02:55] listen to this music. Just just tell a
[1:02:58] lie. you know, tell your wife you're
[1:02:59] busy and we'll go do this and tell her
[1:03:01] we're fishing or something, but you
[1:03:02] know, and and and he wants to be popular
[1:03:05] among his colleagues at work or maybe at
[1:03:07] school, you know, and that and that can
[1:03:09] be such a trap because there's such a
[1:03:11] longing in John. I need to fit in.
[1:03:13] There's one place we want to fit in.
[1:03:15] That's in the word of God. Amen. So you
[1:03:18] but see so so that lie would open a door
[1:03:20] from that to maybe drinking, smoking,
[1:03:22] vaping, pornography then comes with that
[1:03:25] temper and of violence and drugs and you
[1:03:27] know his family environment turns from a
[1:03:30] place of happiness and a place of
[1:03:32] safety. Amen. Into a place where his
[1:03:34] children are walking on eggshells, his
[1:03:36] wife is walking on eggshells because
[1:03:38] because they have no idea what's going
[1:03:40] to come home when he walks through the
[1:03:41] door. Because you know Legion wasn't
[1:03:43] always demonpossessed. It says that off
[1:03:46] times we read there in um if I can find
[1:03:48] it uh uh verse 29 for off times it had
[1:03:52] caught him and he was kept bound with
[1:03:54] chains and in feeders. So these unclean
[1:03:55] spirits would come and go. They'd come
[1:03:58] and go. So they'd come, they'd do great
[1:04:00] damage. Then he'd come back into his
[1:04:02] right mind and say, "What's happened?
[1:04:04] What's happened to me? Why why am I why
[1:04:07] is there all this hurt now in my family?
[1:04:08] Why is such a gulf between me and my
[1:04:10] wife? And why am I doing these things
[1:04:12] I'm doing?" Why? Because the spirit
[1:04:13] would come and it would it would come
[1:04:15] and it would
[1:04:16] go and then yeah these things they bring
[1:04:19] you know they bring violence they bring
[1:04:21] anger they bring fear you know and then
[1:04:23] eventually he comes and goes at strange
[1:04:25] hours a man who is like a clockwork is
[1:04:28] very unpredictable he's been like he's
[1:04:30] been driven by these spirits and then
[1:04:32] you know then he becomes a recluse he
[1:04:34] was always wanting to be alone doesn't
[1:04:36] want people around him if you want to
[1:04:38] separate yourself from the brethren
[1:04:40] there's a problem that's the enemy
[1:04:42] trying to separ separate you and we're
[1:04:45] not meant to be divided. No man is an
[1:04:47] island.
[1:04:49] Amen. No, we all need we all need each
[1:04:52] other. He became a recluse. Always
[1:04:55] wanted to be alone. And of course, his
[1:04:57] friends, his family tried to intervene.
[1:04:59] They tried to, you know, and things got
[1:05:00] to such a desperate stage. Amen. They
[1:05:03] try and physically bind him with chains.
[1:05:05] This is this is such a last resort kind
[1:05:07] of a you if we could just put ourselves
[1:05:09] in the story this morning. such a last
[1:05:11] resort thing. If you think about there's
[1:05:13] someone you love in your family and
[1:05:14] you've literally got to try and chain
[1:05:16] them in a room to keep them from doing
[1:05:19] uh crazy insane things. But you see,
[1:05:21] demons can't be held by chains.
[1:05:24] Pardon me. Demons can't be held by
[1:05:26] chains. Spirits cannot be contained.
[1:05:28] They've got to be loose from the person.
[1:05:30] Amen. So that you know that demon power
[1:05:32] gave him such strength that he broke
[1:05:34] those chains and he ran off into the
[1:05:36] tombs. Amen. cutting himself, living
[1:05:38] among the dead in pain and anguish and
[1:05:40] shame. People would come and try and
[1:05:43] help him, try and get him out there cuz
[1:05:44] we love John. We care about him. I'm
[1:05:47] just using that name, okay? No one
[1:05:49] specific, okay? That's why I asked
[1:05:50] anyone here's name John. No, so I I use
[1:05:52] the name John. I could use Frederick or
[1:05:54] something, okay? But so you understand,
[1:05:56] I'm not no one particular, right? Amen.
[1:05:59] But you know, people would try and come
[1:06:00] and help him, but those spirits would
[1:06:01] get on him and they he just got violent
[1:06:03] and would attack them, you know? And
[1:06:05] there he was. He was naked, living among
[1:06:07] the tombs. Out of his mind, all hopes
[1:06:09] was gone. And that's how the enemy wants
[1:06:11] to pin us down by thinking there's no
[1:06:14] way out. Now, there's a famous painting.
[1:06:17] There's a famous painting called
[1:06:19] Checkmate. Now, the uh chess masters, we
[1:06:23] got I know Christine's watching Albert
[1:06:24] here. the chess masters. Um, if they
[1:06:27] really looked at this painting, they'd
[1:06:28] realize that so on the right hand side
[1:06:31] is a young man and he's playing chess
[1:06:33] with the devil to try and win his
[1:06:36] soul. But the but the devil's got the
[1:06:39] young man thinking there's no way out
[1:06:42] that he's basically it's a fourlong
[1:06:44] conclusion, foregone conclusion rather,
[1:06:46] that it's going to be checkmate. But all
[1:06:48] the chess masters, if you look at that
[1:06:50] board, you actually realize no, he's not
[1:06:52] in checkmate. He hasn't lost. He can
[1:06:55] actually win this game. But the devil
[1:06:57] tries to get us so discouraged. Tries to
[1:06:59] get us so that all of our hopes leave. I
[1:07:01] see everyone's looking at the pieces and
[1:07:03] you know, but but but that's how but but
[1:07:05] you see the look on the young man's face
[1:07:08] is, man, I'm cooked. I'm done. I cannot
[1:07:11] get out of this. And this is what this
[1:07:13] is what the devil always wants us to
[1:07:15] think. There's no way out. All hope is
[1:07:18] gone. You just got to go run through the
[1:07:20] motions and you're going to lose.
[1:07:24] But there's a way out. Amen. There's a
[1:07:27] way out. Amen.
[1:07:30] Excuse me. Amen. See, it's like life.
[1:07:33] This See, there's an angel standing
[1:07:35] between the devil and this young man.
[1:07:37] There's the master standing right there.
[1:07:40] But he's got to be called into the game.
[1:07:42] I mean, he's got to be invited to take
[1:07:43] over the game of life. You see, as this
[1:07:46] young man is trying to live life in his
[1:07:47] own way. I know the word says this, but
[1:07:49] I'm a special case. I'm going to do
[1:07:51] this. And you know, slowly, you know,
[1:07:53] slowly and surely, the devil's taking
[1:07:54] his pieces, taking his virtues, his joy,
[1:07:57] his strength, his peace, his love,
[1:07:58] taking it out of his life. And all that
[1:08:00] young man needs to do is actually talk
[1:08:02] to the angel. Say, "Lord, intervene on
[1:08:05] my behalf. I've been trying to play life
[1:08:07] for so long. I'm just losing this game."
[1:08:09] You can't beat the devil, friends. We
[1:08:11] cannot beat him. Brother Ram said, "You
[1:08:13] cannot outsmart him
[1:08:16] in your own strength.
[1:08:19] It takes the strength of the Lord. It
[1:08:21] takes the mind of Christ to whip the
[1:08:22] devil. Amen. If you've got the mind of
[1:08:24] Christ by the baptism of the Holy Ghost,
[1:08:26] you'll whip him every time because
[1:08:27] you're not relying on your own mind.
[1:08:29] You're relying on the mind of the word.
[1:08:31] Amen. To come and live through your
[1:08:32] life. Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:08:36] So, so if we try and, you know, go
[1:08:39] through life through our own strength,
[1:08:40] we'll eventually lose. We need the
[1:08:42] master to step in. It's like Joshua when
[1:08:44] he, you know, Joshua needed needed the
[1:08:46] Lord to step in to take over the
[1:08:48] campaign to take the promised land. And
[1:08:50] he did as the captain of the Lord's
[1:08:52] host. Amen. As as as as um Joshua saw
[1:08:55] saw this man with a sword draw come
[1:08:57] before him and he says, "Are you for us
[1:08:59] or against us?" Joshua asking this man
[1:09:01] and and it was the and it was the Lord.
[1:09:03] He says, "No, I've come as the captain
[1:09:04] of the Lord's host. So I'm neither for
[1:09:06] you nor against you. I've come to take
[1:09:08] over your battle. I've come to lead.
[1:09:09] Amen. I'm not here to in support. I've
[1:09:11] come here to be the captain." Amen. That
[1:09:13] it's not you leading me around. It's me
[1:09:15] leading you around. Amen. That God would
[1:09:18] take over and lead our battles. Amen.
[1:09:19] And that wasn't just
[1:09:21] for, excuse me, that wasn't just for
[1:09:24] Jericho. That was for the whole
[1:09:25] campaign. So when the Lord comes and
[1:09:27] takes over your life, it's not just for
[1:09:29] one instance. Get me out of this, Lord.
[1:09:31] Help me, Lord. Set me free, Lord. It's
[1:09:33] for your whole Christian journey.
[1:09:35] Amen. And we know Calvary enabled the
[1:09:39] Lord to step into our human battles and
[1:09:41] take
[1:09:42] over. Praise
[1:09:45] God. Amen.
[1:09:47] Because we were all like Legion. The
[1:09:50] reason I read about Legion is I was him
[1:09:52] once upon a time. That was me. We were
[1:09:54] all this way. You say, "Well, I wasn't
[1:09:56] naked in the tombs among the dead." But
[1:09:58] you're caught up in the spirit of the
[1:10:00] world. You know, whatever the world was
[1:10:02] doing. I was telling um I know it was
[1:10:04] Anelise or Lilia, one of them. I was
[1:10:06] saying they're asking me about my
[1:10:08] parents and were they Christians and you
[1:10:10] know, what happened? and and and and I
[1:10:12] gave a brief ex um explanation about,
[1:10:14] you know, they really came back to the
[1:10:16] Lord when I came to the Lord. And and
[1:10:18] and I said, "You think about the impact
[1:10:20] of this. Here's your son you barely hear
[1:10:22] from." And I'm still very bad. I'm
[1:10:24] probably worse now with contact than I
[1:10:26] was then, right? But here's your son. Uh
[1:10:28] you only see him at Christmas time, you
[1:10:30] know, few times in the year because you
[1:10:33] don't live in the same country anymore.
[1:10:35] My parents went to Papa New Guinea,
[1:10:37] right? And but but then but then he
[1:10:39] starts sending emails of God working in
[1:10:41] his life. And before that he was this
[1:10:43] beer beer making beer drinking stubby
[1:10:46] wearing person. And one of them laughed.
[1:10:48] How could you wear stubbies? How could
[1:10:49] you do this? I said well look it was the
[1:10:51] fashion of the age. So you just start
[1:10:53] doing what everyone else is doing
[1:10:54] because the spirit driving them is
[1:10:56] motivating you right? And then and then
[1:10:58] but I said but then what happened was
[1:11:00] there was a time where I went from that
[1:11:03] and God got a hold of my life between
[1:11:05] visits and I come back as a Christian
[1:11:07] and I'm a different person. That had a
[1:11:09] great impact. Amen. That had a great
[1:11:12] impact. God began to work in their lives
[1:11:13] again because they saw their son was
[1:11:16] once this way. Now he's a different way.
[1:11:19] Amen. So I know what it's like to be
[1:11:22] legion. I know what it's like to be
[1:11:23] without hope. I know what it's like to
[1:11:25] be depressed. I know what it's like to
[1:11:27] say, "Well, I'm just stuck in life and
[1:11:28] this is what I got to do." You know, I
[1:11:30] know what it was like to be that way. To
[1:11:32] cry out, be feel so alone. No one
[1:11:35] understood what I was going through. I
[1:11:37] remember being like that, depressed,
[1:11:39] down, would crossm road there in Christ
[1:11:41] Church and and just in my heart will for
[1:11:43] traffic to hit me. I was so down and
[1:11:45] alone in myself. I had friends. I
[1:11:48] laughed the most around everyone, but in
[1:11:50] inwardly I was empty. So I know what
[1:11:53] it's like to be legion to be among dead
[1:11:55] things. I was living I was feeding off
[1:11:57] dead things of the world. But there was
[1:11:59] a cry in my heart then Lord help me.
[1:12:03] Help me Jesus. Whoever you are come help
[1:12:06] me Lord. Find me Lord. Hallelujah. And
[1:12:09] but the thing is when he started calling
[1:12:11] I actually stopped. I I didn't want to
[1:12:13] heed the call because I was so afraid of
[1:12:14] my friends and what would people think?
[1:12:16] And we're going to forget those things.
[1:12:18] Amen. Let's just walk with the Lord.
[1:12:21] Amen. Today. So, so I remember that
[1:12:23] call, you know, like Jesus when he when
[1:12:25] he uh you know the start of that chapter
[1:12:27] or verse 22 of Luke 8, you know, it says
[1:12:30] on a certain day he said he said to his
[1:12:33] disciples, "Let's go across the other
[1:12:35] side in a ship." On a certain day, there
[1:12:37] was a prepared time because the Lord
[1:12:39] knew where Legion was. It did not stop
[1:12:42] him, amen, from from going to go get
[1:12:44] him. He did not, you know, he allowed
[1:12:46] Legion to get to that certain spot. And
[1:12:48] I tell you friends, when you get to the
[1:12:50] end of the end of the end of yourself,
[1:12:52] that's when the Lord can step in. Amen.
[1:12:54] People say, "Well, I've hit rock
[1:12:56] bottom." Have you yet? Because you say,
[1:12:58] "Man, I'm going through such a hard,
[1:13:00] desperate time." God's trying to get a
[1:13:02] hold of your life. I mean, don't try and
[1:13:04] cover it up with religion and and I'll
[1:13:06] do well and things will be better. Let
[1:13:07] him come and meet you and transform your
[1:13:09] life because Legion came to the bottom.
[1:13:13] There was times when he was falling from
[1:13:14] being a good moral person, telling lies,
[1:13:17] drinking, smoking, you know, doing
[1:13:19] things behind his family's back and
[1:13:21] causing trouble and strife and fighting
[1:13:22] and arguing. There was a time when he
[1:13:24] was descending like this, but he had to
[1:13:26] get to a certain point where there he
[1:13:29] was. He had nowhere else to fall. He had
[1:13:32] got there. We all have that place. You
[1:13:34] know, Calvary was a terrible
[1:13:36] death. The cross was an ugly thing
[1:13:39] humanly. He was a man marred more than
[1:13:42] any other man carrying the sin of the
[1:13:44] world. Died of a broken heart. There he
[1:13:47] was. It wasn't a beautiful thing. It was
[1:13:49] a glorious thing. It was an incredible
[1:13:51] thing. But humanly it wasn't a great
[1:13:53] thing, you know, in terms of what it
[1:13:56] looked like. It was it was nasty,
[1:13:58] terrible. Death is horrible, right? But
[1:14:02] Jesus ca Jesus gave his life that we
[1:14:05] would receive his life. Amen. But he
[1:14:07] knew it was like to die out to let God,
[1:14:10] if I put it that way though, God come
[1:14:11] and live through his life to fulfill the
[1:14:13] word. We've got to come to a place where
[1:14:14] we really repent. You know, the zeal of
[1:14:17] ages to
[1:14:18] repent. It says in Revelations chapter
[1:14:21] 3, be zealous, therefore, and repent.
[1:14:23] Amen. A real more than just I'm sorry
[1:14:25] and yes, you've caught me. That's not a
[1:14:27] repentance. No, real repentance is God
[1:14:29] change. Take the sin nature out of my
[1:14:31] life. Amen. Turn me around, Lord. Lord,
[1:14:33] I'm sick of being I'm sick of being this
[1:14:35] human guy. I'm not meant to be this guy.
[1:14:37] Like I said a few Wednesdays ago, the
[1:14:39] black, you know, there's the black and
[1:14:40] the white dog. There's there's there's
[1:14:42] the flesh and there's the spirit. I say
[1:14:44] the black dog is not the real you. This
[1:14:47] carnal guy is not the real you. Amen.
[1:14:49] No, the white dog is the real you. Amen.
[1:14:52] That's the real you, friend. So, you
[1:14:54] know, so that but that black dog's got
[1:14:56] to die.
[1:14:57] Amen. To let the Lord take over. So,
[1:14:59] there's Legion. Now, the Lord crossed
[1:15:01] the Sea of Galilee to get to Legion. And
[1:15:03] I say, "The Lord came from the pores of
[1:15:05] glory to get to me." Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:15:07] He He came from heaven to the earth to
[1:15:10] come and get me. You know, he could have
[1:15:12] said to his disciples, "I've got a son
[1:15:14] on the other side." Amen. When you see
[1:15:16] him, he doesn't look like a son, but on
[1:15:18] the inside, he's a son. Amen. He's a,
[1:15:20] you know, he's one of my children. He's
[1:15:22] an attribute that I've got to go and
[1:15:24] reach. Amen. That's why we're crossing
[1:15:25] this sea. Hallelujah. And it's the same
[1:15:27] thing with us, you know. Hallelujah.
[1:15:30] Amen. is you know God when God saw us he
[1:15:34] he looked beyond this man he saw a seed
[1:15:37] he saw part of himself when you know
[1:15:39] like the angel when said to Mary you
[1:15:40] shall call his name Jesus for he shall
[1:15:42] save his people from their sins. Amen.
[1:15:46] And has he not done that? Amen. Has he
[1:15:48] not washed us from them? Separated us
[1:15:51] from them? Amen. Jesus knew the state of
[1:15:53] Legion. He knew the doors that Legion
[1:15:56] allowed to open. I mean to open to allow
[1:15:59] himself to get into that condition. but
[1:16:01] didn't change Jesus' attitude. None.
[1:16:03] Amen. He crossed that sea through a
[1:16:05] great storm because he had to he had to
[1:16:07] get to his
[1:16:09] son. Hallelujah. So there's legion. He
[1:16:12] runs out of the tombs. Jesus tells that
[1:16:15] legion of devils to get out of him. And
[1:16:17] those and those and those demons, they
[1:16:20] were they were interceding say, "We want
[1:16:22] to stay in this place. We want to stay.
[1:16:24] Let us go into those hogs. Let us let us
[1:16:26] go somewhere." And Jesus allowed them to
[1:16:29] go into the hogs. Now when those hogs
[1:16:31] when they became demonpossessed, they
[1:16:33] ran into the lake and they drowned
[1:16:35] themselves. They did not want to have
[1:16:37] one second with the devil in their
[1:16:38] lives. And you know, if we just got to a
[1:16:41] point where you have the devils in our
[1:16:43] lives that we allow ourselves to be
[1:16:44] drowned in the blood of Jesus Christ. We
[1:16:46] allow the Lord to come and take over
[1:16:48] that. We're not willing to put up with
[1:16:49] any part of the enemy. We're not willing
[1:16:51] to let and and I believe I'm looking at
[1:16:54] people who who they're not peacekeepers
[1:16:56] with the devil. We're not willing to put
[1:16:57] up with him a little bit of his life in
[1:16:59] our life. Amen. But we want to live in
[1:17:01] such a way that that because we know
[1:17:04] that he has no part in us and he has no
[1:17:06] and we have no part in him. But there
[1:17:09] are the hog farmers. They see this
[1:17:10] scene. They would have known Legion cuz
[1:17:13] he was from their town, from their area.
[1:17:15] So they saw Legion, you know, run to
[1:17:17] Jesus. Jesus there. Jesus say a few
[1:17:19] simple words of come out of him. What's
[1:17:23] your name? You can go on the pigs. Then
[1:17:25] those pigs going headlong into the sea
[1:17:27] to drown themselves. They all saw this.
[1:17:29] But notice they didn't, you know, it
[1:17:31] wasn't a big elation that came over
[1:17:34] them. They didn't start saying, "Glory
[1:17:35] to God. Our friend John is free. He's
[1:17:38] now in his right mind. Thank you, Lord.
[1:17:41] We've been praying that this would
[1:17:42] happen. We didn't know how it would
[1:17:43] happen, but it happened now, and we can,
[1:17:45] you know, we're so thankful." No. A
[1:17:46] great fear came upon them, and they went
[1:17:49] and testified in the town and all the
[1:17:51] roundabout area what had happened. But
[1:17:54] their testimony wasn't a good testimony
[1:17:56] because they didn't want the Lord. They
[1:17:59] would rather stay with a demon-possessed
[1:18:01] man in the tombs and pigs than have the
[1:18:04] Messiah and a man in his right mind and
[1:18:06] being restored. They'd rather have a
[1:18:08] demon-possessed man and pigs than have
[1:18:10] God come in their midst. So, they
[1:18:12] actually bid him to
[1:18:14] go. Amen. But now, here's this man. And
[1:18:18] when they found him, if I have this
[1:18:19] here, when they found him, when these
[1:18:22] men came back and they found Legion,
[1:18:25] they found him clothed. No, sitting at
[1:18:27] the feet of Jesus, clothed and in his
[1:18:29] right mind. And they were afraid. They
[1:18:33] were shocked at the see where where did
[1:18:35] they find him? Just like where do they
[1:18:37] find you? At the feet of the Messiah,
[1:18:39] the Lord of glory. Amen. They that that
[1:18:42] he's now identified with the Messiah.
[1:18:44] He's now identified. Sorry. He is now
[1:18:46] identified with the word of the hour.
[1:18:49] Amen. And he's no longer attacking
[1:18:51] people. He's no longer cutting himself,
[1:18:53] but he's still he's seated at the feet
[1:18:55] of the Lord Jesus. Amen. He's not naked
[1:18:58] no more, but he's clothed. Amen. He's
[1:19:00] not insane, but he's got a sound mind.
[1:19:02] Amen. It's like the Lord, you know, you
[1:19:04] know, the word says that we have not
[1:19:06] been given the spirit of fear, but
[1:19:07] power, love, and a sound mind. What is
[1:19:09] that sound mind? The mind of Christ.
[1:19:12] Amen. More than just being restored back
[1:19:13] to a good moral person. know we have
[1:19:15] received the mind of Christ. When you
[1:19:17] sit, when you meet the Lord, he changes
[1:19:19] your life, transforms you. Amen. You
[1:19:21] receive his mind. Amen. That you no
[1:19:23] longer thinking your own thoughts.
[1:19:25] You're thinking his thoughts. Amen.
[1:19:27] Brother Bram said, "Clothe me in the
[1:19:29] mind to worship him." Worship him how?
[1:19:31] In spirit and truth. Amen. Lord, I'm
[1:19:34] walking right down standing talking to
[1:19:35] the president of the United States. He
[1:19:37] comes upon me and oh holla hallelujah. I
[1:19:39] don't care. Sure not. Amen. Why? Because
[1:19:42] been clothed. Amen. given a sound mind.
[1:19:46] Hallelujah. So, we're not just a resto,
[1:19:48] as I've said, we're just not restored to
[1:19:50] be a good, honest people. We're being
[1:19:52] restored back as a son or daughter of
[1:19:55] God. Amen. As the Lord, See, the power
[1:19:58] of the blood is so complete, so
[1:20:01] thorough. Amen. It completely washes us
[1:20:04] from all our sin. Amen. Sin nature's
[1:20:07] gone. You know, all all the carnality
[1:20:10] goes. Amen. He he totally changes. The
[1:20:12] blood works. Amen. You you you just you
[1:20:15] just plead the blood of Jesus Christ
[1:20:17] over a situation, you watch God to go to
[1:20:19] work. Amen. You your family got trouble,
[1:20:21] plead the blood of Jesus Christ over
[1:20:23] them. I mean, you got sickness in your
[1:20:24] house, plead the blood of Jesus Christ.
[1:20:26] I mean, you're going into a situation
[1:20:28] you you've never been in, like a job
[1:20:29] interview or something. What do you do?
[1:20:31] Plead the blood. Lord, I'm going into
[1:20:33] this unknown. Lord, I need you to go
[1:20:34] with me. Lord, I need you to be a
[1:20:36] barrier between me and the enemy,
[1:20:38] between me and the world, that you can
[1:20:39] live through me. Lord, cover me in your
[1:20:41] blood. Amen. Because he says now, sorry.
[1:20:44] And from Jesus Christ was the faithful
[1:20:46] witness and the first begotten of the
[1:20:48] dead and the prince of the kings of the
[1:20:50] earth. Unto him that loved us and washed
[1:20:52] us from our sins in his own blood. Amen.
[1:20:56] So if you've been washed now, it's no
[1:20:58] longer part of you. You know, it's like
[1:21:00] a boy gets covered in mud. See, sin
[1:21:03] restricts us from walking where we
[1:21:04] should really walk. Where where should
[1:21:07] we be able to walk with our Lord in the
[1:21:10] word as a Christian? But sin keeps us
[1:21:13] from him. But then the blood washes us
[1:21:17] from sin and it's like a boy covered in
[1:21:19] mud. You see any of your children
[1:21:21] covered in mud? They walk inside. What's
[1:21:25] the first question? Stop. What are you
[1:21:27] doing here? You can't walk here in that
[1:21:29] condition. You can't sit on that seat
[1:21:32] covered in mud. You can't go on your bed
[1:21:33] covered in mud. You've got to get washed
[1:21:36] before you can walk around the whole
[1:21:37] house at liberty. Amen. It's the same
[1:21:40] thing with you and I. Amen. When when
[1:21:42] when the blood's Yeah. Hey, the boy's
[1:21:44] still the same. The mud's not part of
[1:21:47] him. Hallelujah. That's like sin. Sin's
[1:21:50] not really part of us. Amen. We may be
[1:21:52] born with a sin nature, but it's not the
[1:21:53] real you. Amen. It's not the white dog,
[1:21:56] it's the black dog. Amen. So, so it
[1:21:58] doesn't belong to us. But now, when we
[1:22:00] get washed in the blood of Jesus Christ,
[1:22:02] sin nature leaves. Amen. All the all the
[1:22:04] sin that that back, you know, stops us
[1:22:07] from walking with the Lord, walking into
[1:22:09] every divine promise is gone.
[1:22:11] Condemnation's gone. Praise the Lord.
[1:22:14] Amen. That now we have a right like a
[1:22:16] boy who's just been washed. He's clean.
[1:22:18] You know, no parent says, "What are you
[1:22:19] doing sitting on that couch?" What are
[1:22:21] you doing in your bed? What are you
[1:22:23] doing in the kitchen? What are you doing
[1:22:25] here? No, they're allowed to walk there.
[1:22:27] That's right. Amen. They have liberty.
[1:22:29] Amen. Why? because they're being washed
[1:22:30] from the washed from the world and they
[1:22:32] can walk about their house wherever
[1:22:34] they'd like to. It's the same thing with
[1:22:35] the word, friends. This is our house.
[1:22:38] This is our house, right? And because
[1:22:40] the Lord has done such a complete work,
[1:22:42] we can walk into every divine promise.
[1:22:44] Amen. We can walk into healing. We can
[1:22:47] walk into joy. We can walk into love. We
[1:22:49] can walk into restoration. We can walk
[1:22:51] into peace. Amen. We can walk into the
[1:22:53] rapture. We can walk into everything.
[1:22:56] Amen. That that God has given us. Why?
[1:22:58] because we've been washed. Hallelujah.
[1:23:01] Amen. We have been given full permission
[1:23:04] to walk anywhere in the word that
[1:23:06] pertains to a believer. Amen. It's like
[1:23:09] it says in second Corinthians, Amen.
[1:23:11] where it says now where the where you
[1:23:13] know now the Lord is that spirit and
[1:23:14] where the spirit of the Lord is, there
[1:23:16] is liberty. And that liberty is to go
[1:23:19] free as a son or daughter of God. Amen.
[1:23:21] So you can as a slave, you can go
[1:23:23] certain places. You can't go certain
[1:23:25] places because you're not allowed. You
[1:23:26] don't have the authority to do it. But
[1:23:28] then when you become a son or daughter,
[1:23:30] you can go anywhere you want in your
[1:23:31] father's kingdom.
[1:23:33] Amen. No slave master can can raise his
[1:23:36] whip to you. Amen. No devil can raise
[1:23:38] his whip and say, "You don't belong
[1:23:39] here." You say, "No, I've been set free.
[1:23:42] I'm going free by the liberty of the
[1:23:44] spirit. I can go into every promise cuz
[1:23:47] it's every promise is mine." Amen. It's
[1:23:49] like brother Bram, you know, when he
[1:23:50] would speak in um it is the rising of
[1:23:53] the sun and he, you know, compares and
[1:23:55] contrasts two Cadillacs. He says now
[1:23:58] two, you know, one one has got the spark
[1:24:00] plug, the other doesn't have the spark
[1:24:02] plug. So, both say they're Cadillacs.
[1:24:04] They've got all these abilities,
[1:24:05] everything, but only one has the
[1:24:07] ignition to make it go. I tell you what,
[1:24:09] friends, God has given us a word that
[1:24:13] goes to its destination. I mean, when
[1:24:15] the prophet left this world, he left us
[1:24:17] with a car. that's got fire. Amen. It's
[1:24:21] got gasoline and it will travel to every
[1:24:23] divine promise. Amen. He's given a faith
[1:24:26] was released into this age. Amen. Of the
[1:24:28] original faith of the fathers. Amen.
[1:24:30] That will make us cause us to travel to
[1:24:33] every divine promise of God. Amen. It's
[1:24:36] like you look at, you know, you go on a
[1:24:37] natural drive. You're not questioning if
[1:24:39] your car will get there. You have faith.
[1:24:42] You believed your car will get you here
[1:24:44] today. If not, you would have taken
[1:24:46] another one or you would have walked or
[1:24:48] I don't know what but you would have got
[1:24:49] here somehow but not by your car.
[1:24:52] So you had faith that your car will get
[1:24:55] you here. How much more having faith
[1:24:58] that the faith he's given us will get us
[1:25:00] to every promise. It's already ours. It
[1:25:02] will take us to healing, take us to
[1:25:04] deliverance, take us to the Holy Ghost,
[1:25:06] take us to peace, take us to joy, take
[1:25:08] us to prodical coming home, take us to
[1:25:10] restoration, take us to
[1:25:12] ordained godly marriages. Hallelujah.
[1:25:15] Take us to home life that's just full of
[1:25:17] the Holy Ghost. Take us to every divine
[1:25:18] promise. Amen. God has left us that.
[1:25:23] Amen. So now what are we doing? We are
[1:25:25] actually driving in it. Amen. You got to
[1:25:28] look at your life. You've been driving
[1:25:30] places.
[1:25:32] When you first met the Lord, God gave
[1:25:34] you a faith to drive to
[1:25:35] salvation. Amen. You had all these
[1:25:38] habits hanging on your life. What'd you
[1:25:40] do? Then God drove you to
[1:25:41] sanctification. Praise the Lord. He
[1:25:43] drove you to the baptism of the Holy
[1:25:45] Ghost. He's driven you. Now, this is not
[1:25:47] in any exact order, but he's driven you
[1:25:49] to healing and deliverance, all these
[1:25:50] different things. The faith that God has
[1:25:53] given you has taken you there. Amen.
[1:25:57] Praise the Lord. So, if we have liberty
[1:25:59] to go free as a son or daughter of God,
[1:26:02] then why should we listen to what the
[1:26:03] devil has got to tell us? A says in
[1:26:06] Galatians, I think I might have this one
[1:26:07] here. He says
[1:26:09] that, see if we have it here. He, you
[1:26:13] know, the apostle Paul is speaking to
[1:26:15] the Galatians and he's rebuking them
[1:26:16] saying, why would you why would you turn
[1:26:19] from the things of the Lord? I'm just
[1:26:21] paraphrasing here. Why would you turn
[1:26:23] from the things of the Lord and turn
[1:26:25] again to the weak and beggely elements
[1:26:27] where until you desire to again to be in
[1:26:29] bondage? So why would you turn to these
[1:26:31] things that are just beggely if that's
[1:26:33] the right word elements? Now that word
[1:26:35] beggy of course comes from the word
[1:26:37] beggar or a porpa. So he's basically
[1:26:40] saying why would you turn to things that
[1:26:41] are basically a beggar to let you know
[1:26:43] and let those things rule you to you
[1:26:45] know that you come into bondage again.
[1:26:47] Now Satan is the beggar,
[1:26:50] right? Satan is the beggar on this
[1:26:51] world. He's been actually stripped of
[1:26:54] all power. The only power he has is
[1:26:56] deceit. Yep.
[1:26:59] Amen. That's that you know that's all he
[1:27:01] has. Now, a beggar, the only way a
[1:27:03] beggar can get someone to to to give
[1:27:05] them things is to try and convince a
[1:27:08] passer by to give them attention, to
[1:27:09] listen to them. That's the only way a
[1:27:10] begging, you see them on the street, you
[1:27:12] know, they're asking for money, asking
[1:27:13] for things. The only way that that
[1:27:16] person does what the beggar wants is for
[1:27:18] the person to stop, listen, and agree.
[1:27:22] The beggar can't
[1:27:23] forcibly mug someone. If they do,
[1:27:26] they'll get thrown in jail, right? But
[1:27:28] you know they don't physically but they
[1:27:29] should you know but all they do is sit
[1:27:31] there saying please I need money please
[1:27:33] I need this please I need this and it's
[1:27:35] like the devil he sits there like a
[1:27:37] beggar. Amen. He sits there like a
[1:27:39] beggar and he tries to get your
[1:27:41] attention you know with and he is only
[1:27:44] as powerful as you allow him to be.
[1:27:48] That's all the power what whatever power
[1:27:50] you surrender into his hand that's the
[1:27:52] power he now has.
[1:27:54] Amen. But but it's see it's like for
[1:27:56] example this just a natural example you
[1:27:58] I was with Gabriella in her school camp
[1:28:00] there was a high ropes course I don't
[1:28:01] know how how high was that Gabes where
[1:28:03] are you high yeah up to the ceiling kind
[1:28:06] of where the steeple is up there kind of
[1:28:07] thing now all the all the children you
[1:28:11] know what do you do you get in a harness
[1:28:13] you climb up this thing and they wanted
[1:28:15] them to climb up this ladder thing and
[1:28:16] walk along a beam and then let go and
[1:28:18] then just come down you be brought down
[1:28:20] by the harness right so all the kids
[1:28:22] could physically do
[1:28:24] So the only factor that stopped them
[1:28:26] either getting up there or walking along
[1:28:27] the beam was fear because they all had
[1:28:30] the ability to get up there, right? So
[1:28:32] some kids just let full uh fear rule
[1:28:35] them completely. They they didn't even
[1:28:36] get up there. Some part way good for
[1:28:39] them for trying. Others like Gabes got
[1:28:41] up there, walked along the beam, and let
[1:28:43] go and came down. One one boy got down,
[1:28:45] did some push-ups up there. He's like,
[1:28:47] "What can I do when I'm up here?" kind
[1:28:49] of thing. Did they feel afraid? They
[1:28:51] did. But did they let it rule them? No.
[1:28:55] Amen. So, it's the same thing with you
[1:28:56] and I. The devil will try and us
[1:28:59] by fear. He's trying to He's trying to
[1:29:01] get your attention. Look, this may
[1:29:03] happen to you or you or you feel this
[1:29:04] pain. Well, it might be this or it's
[1:29:06] cancer or it's this or whatever. He
[1:29:08] tries to put that fear on you to control
[1:29:10] you. But if you give it if you get if
[1:29:13] you allow it to rule you, then he's got
[1:29:15] control over you. Right? But if you push
[1:29:18] it back and say, "No, the Lord, I'm not
[1:29:20] afraid to go to the doctor. I'm not
[1:29:21] afraid to be diagnosed cuz the Lord is
[1:29:23] my healer. He's allowed these things to
[1:29:25] come into my life that his purpose would
[1:29:27] be manifest that he would get glory out
[1:29:29] of this testimony. What then? If you
[1:29:31] have that mindset, that attitude, you're
[1:29:33] not afraid. So the beggar has no
[1:29:36] control.
[1:29:39] Amen. Praise the Lord. So we don't want
[1:29:41] to see a beggar who finds a place to
[1:29:44] live becomes a squatter. So Satan was
[1:29:46] kicked out of heaven and he is a
[1:29:48] squatter on the earth. So, he may be the
[1:29:50] god of this evil age, but he's actually
[1:29:52] just a squatter. Someone who and he and
[1:29:54] he tries to squat on God's promises and
[1:29:57] try and tell you that they don't belong
[1:29:59] to you. Who's ever had the thought, "I'm
[1:30:02] not worthy to receive
[1:30:03] this." That is the devil squatting on
[1:30:06] your promise. Jesus died that you'd
[1:30:09] become worthy.
[1:30:11] By his worthiness, the promise is yours.
[1:30:13] Not your worthiness. It's actually not
[1:30:14] in the picture. His worthiness gives it
[1:30:16] to you. Amen. So, so what is that? If
[1:30:20] you identify Satan, you're just a
[1:30:21] squatter. Get out in the name of Jesus
[1:30:23] Christ. I don't have to listen to you.
[1:30:24] No, the Lord has given me this promise.
[1:30:26] Then what? It's
[1:30:28] yours. Amen. Sickness is just a
[1:30:31] squatter.
[1:30:32] Amen. Your body does not belong to the
[1:30:35] devil. It doesn't belong to the devil.
[1:30:37] Your body is the Lord's. Amen. When his
[1:30:40] blood dropped that day on Calvary and
[1:30:42] bathed the earth, what was he doing? He
[1:30:44] was claiming this earth belongs to me
[1:30:46] and your body's a part of the earth.
[1:30:48] Amen. The human spirit doesn't belong to
[1:30:51] the beggar. Doesn't belong to the beggar
[1:30:53] at all. Doesn't belong to Satan. No. You
[1:30:55] know, I know brother says that this is
[1:30:57] like a no man's land because God and
[1:31:00] Satan, you know, made the mind as a
[1:31:02] mutual
[1:31:03] battlefield. But it isn't no man's land.
[1:31:07] It's like no man's land because that's
[1:31:08] where battles are fought because neither
[1:31:10] side has control of that space which
[1:31:12] call means it's no man's land. This is
[1:31:14] not no man's land. This is God's land.
[1:31:17] Amen. Your human spirit is the Lord's.
[1:31:19] Your body is the Lord's. Amen. So
[1:31:23] anything the devil um anything the devil
[1:31:25] can try and put in those things
[1:31:27] complexes, spiritual wounds,
[1:31:28] unforgiveness, that's just a squatter
[1:31:31] that doesn't belong to you from the
[1:31:33] beginning. Amen. We were never. It's
[1:31:35] like Legion. He was under the devil's
[1:31:37] control, but he never belonged to the
[1:31:39] devil. None of us ever belonged to the
[1:31:41] devil. He's just trying to be a squatter
[1:31:42] saying that that you know he always says
[1:31:45] this one's mine. I say no. By the blood
[1:31:47] of Jesus Christ, no, we're all the
[1:31:49] Lord's.
[1:31:50] Amen. The only thing prepared for the
[1:31:53] devil is everlasting fire. That's what
[1:31:55] the Lord said. Matthew 25:41, he's
[1:31:58] prepared that place for the devil devil
[1:32:00] and his angels. Everlasting fire. That's
[1:32:02] the squatters. Amen. That's the beggar's
[1:32:04] habitation. That's where he's going to
[1:32:06] end up. That's where he belongs. We
[1:32:07] don't belong there. That ain't your
[1:32:09] inheritance. Amen. Our inheritance is
[1:32:11] walking on the streets of gold. Amen.
[1:32:13] Washed in the blood of the lamb, walking
[1:32:15] victorious. Amen. Amen. Praise the Lord.
[1:32:18] So there was
[1:32:20] Legion. The Lord found him, set him
[1:32:22] free, cast those devils out of him, gave
[1:32:25] him a right mind. Amen. Sat clothed at
[1:32:27] the feet of the Lord. And so what
[1:32:29] happened now is the voice of Legion
[1:32:31] changed. Amen. And he went from a a man
[1:32:34] speaking cursings and hatred and malice
[1:32:36] and strife and pain and complexes
[1:32:39] speaking and hurts and just you know
[1:32:41] trying to nitpick and always get the
[1:32:42] last word in his voice changed like we
[1:32:45] read there in Jeremiah 30:19. And out of
[1:32:48] them shall proce shall proceed
[1:32:50] thanksgiving and the voice of them that
[1:32:52] make Mary. Amen. So he became a totally
[1:32:54] different man. His his life changed.
[1:32:57] Amen. He met the master. Amen. He wasn't
[1:32:59] the same legion he was that brought him
[1:33:01] into the tombs. He was a totally
[1:33:03] different man. And so his voice changed.
[1:33:05] Why? Cuz now he could he could speak
[1:33:07] with thanks. Out of out of him came
[1:33:09] thanksgiving. Can you imagine when the
[1:33:11] Lord cuz he wanted to go with the Lord,
[1:33:13] you know, with him over the sea. But the
[1:33:15] Lord said, "No, go back to your
[1:33:17] hometown, go to your house and tell them
[1:33:19] all the great things God has done for
[1:33:21] you." So there is Jesus gets in the boat
[1:33:23] with his disciples cuz the um pig
[1:33:26] farmers have bid him to leave. So he
[1:33:27] gets in the boat and he and he's
[1:33:29] traveling back across the Sea of
[1:33:30] Galilee. And there's Legion now clothed
[1:33:33] waving, saying goodbye to the Lord as he
[1:33:35] goes and maybe as the mass dips under
[1:33:38] the uh you know, as the as the boat goes
[1:33:40] over the horizon, maybe Legion stops
[1:33:42] waving and he thinks to himself, I'll
[1:33:44] see him again. I'll see him again.
[1:33:47] Hallelujah. He's changed my life. But
[1:33:49] remember, the difference between us and
[1:33:51] Legion is is God doesn't just come and
[1:33:53] set us free. He comes and sets us free
[1:33:55] and lives in us. Hallelujah. But the
[1:33:57] same Jesus that Legion saw going, he's
[1:33:59] well, I'll see him again. So now Legion
[1:34:01] begins to walk walk back into his
[1:34:03] hometown and people begin to scatter and
[1:34:06] you know Jesus I mean I mean Legion's
[1:34:08] probably singing I'm so glad I can say
[1:34:09] I'm one of them and take the name of
[1:34:11] Jesus with you child of sorrow of woe
[1:34:13] and thank God I'm free. I'm free from
[1:34:15] this world of sin. You know and then you
[1:34:17] saying hallelujah and singing hosana he
[1:34:19] goes why? Cuz a thanksgiving come out of
[1:34:21] his life. He's met the master. He's been
[1:34:24] transformed. He's been redeemed. Amen.
[1:34:26] And then people see him and say, "Man,
[1:34:28] he's still crazy, but something's
[1:34:30] happened to him. Look, he's clothed.
[1:34:31] Something's gone on." And he goes to
[1:34:33] find where his family lived. Goes to
[1:34:35] find the family house, but it's boarded
[1:34:36] up. There's there's a foreclosure sign
[1:34:38] on the front door. And he asks the
[1:34:40] neighbor, "Where's my family gone?" "Oh,
[1:34:42] they're down the alley there in some
[1:34:44] shack." So he, so Legion goes that way,
[1:34:46] goes down to the alley, sees it, sees
[1:34:49] the shack, and you know, his eldest son
[1:34:51] looks up instead of a face of laughter
[1:34:54] and happiness, there's fear comes across
[1:34:56] his face, and he screams for his
[1:34:58] siblings, run, dad's come home, and his
[1:35:01] and Legion's wife comes out trembling
[1:35:03] and afraid and wondering what's going to
[1:35:05] happen. But then, you know, she starts
[1:35:07] to run as well, but Legion says, "Hold
[1:35:08] on, sweetheart. It's different now. Hold
[1:35:11] on." Glory. I know what it's like. It's
[1:35:16] different now. He's changed me. He's
[1:35:18] changed you. That's what that day on
[1:35:20] Calvary did to you. It changed your
[1:35:22] life. Made you a new creature. Amen.
[1:35:24] Gave you a sound mind. Gave you a joy
[1:35:26] that passes all understanding. A peace
[1:35:28] that passes all understanding. Amen. So
[1:35:30] there he was saying, "Honey, it's all
[1:35:31] over. It's different now. I What
[1:35:33] happened to you? Did you turn over a new
[1:35:34] leaf?" Cuz she's afraid. She's seen him
[1:35:36] try to reform himself before. try and
[1:35:39] just pray more and try and humanly it's
[1:35:40] good to pray more but you know try and
[1:35:42] be religious about it. She's seen him do
[1:35:45] that before but he says no honey I
[1:35:47] haven't turned over a new leaf. What
[1:35:48] happened? I met Jesus. I met Jesus. I
[1:35:51] met the one that that they talked about
[1:35:53] in church. I met him in the tombs. He
[1:35:55] found me. Amen. It wasn't in some great
[1:35:57] place. It was in the tombs. He'll find
[1:35:59] you wherever you are. Whatever state
[1:36:01] you're in, whatever prison you may think
[1:36:03] you're in. Whatever tomb you're in.
[1:36:05] Amen. He doesn't want you to dwell there
[1:36:07] anymore. He wants you to live in life in
[1:36:09] peace and joy. Amen. So she she's
[1:36:13] embraced by
[1:36:14] him. Amen. And the family comes back
[1:36:18] together. You know what happened there?
[1:36:21] A mountain of fear was moved. We sung
[1:36:24] that song about this mountain being
[1:36:25] moved. The do the
[1:36:28] impossible. Amen. I know I've run out of
[1:36:30] time, but I just want to I just want to
[1:36:32] go into this because Calvary has forever
[1:36:35] changed us.
[1:36:38] We are no longer the same people. The
[1:36:40] devil wants you to think you're just not
[1:36:42] there, but you're there. You're there.
[1:36:45] You're sealed to the day of your
[1:36:46] redemption. That's what Calvary has done
[1:36:47] for us. And then so Jesus would tell his
[1:36:50] disciples, he was, you know, we all know
[1:36:52] the story where where Jesus was hungry.
[1:36:55] He saw a fig tree, but there's no figs
[1:36:56] on it. And then so Jesus cursed it,
[1:36:58] saying, "There'll be no fruit from this
[1:37:00] tree, henceforth forever." They came
[1:37:01] back the next day. The thing had already
[1:37:03] withered up. And Jesus answered that,
[1:37:05] you know, and they all marveled, saying,
[1:37:06] look at this fig tree, look at what's
[1:37:08] happened. But then Jesus said, "Verily,
[1:37:09] I say unto you, if you have faith and
[1:37:11] doubt not, you shall not only do this
[1:37:13] which is done to the fig tree, but also
[1:37:15] if you say to this mountain, be thou
[1:37:17] removed, and be thou cast into the sea,
[1:37:19] it shall be done. And all things
[1:37:21] whatsoever you ask in prayer, believing,
[1:37:24] ye shall receive." So he was after
[1:37:27] natural food. That's why he cursed a
[1:37:28] natural tree. And he was speaking about
[1:37:31] a a mountain being moved there. I say
[1:37:33] friends, I don't need a fig tree to be
[1:37:35] cursed. I don't need squirrels to be
[1:37:38] spoken into existence. I don't need a
[1:37:40] storm to be spoken out of existence. We
[1:37:43] have other mountains that need to move.
[1:37:46] But this message has restored us back to
[1:37:48] mountain moving faith. I mean, you've
[1:37:51] got mountain moving faith this morning.
[1:37:53] Why? Because the creator of heavens and
[1:37:55] earth isn't just in heaven. Deities in
[1:37:57] you. That's what Calvary did. That that
[1:37:59] same God that said, "Let there be sun,
[1:38:00] moon, and stars comes and dwells in
[1:38:02] you." Amen. So now when you begin to
[1:38:04] pray, you believe, you shall receive.
[1:38:05] It'll be Hallelujah. Amen. So there's
[1:38:09] mountains that have to be moved. I can
[1:38:10] say there's been a mountain moved off my
[1:38:12] life.
[1:38:14] Hallelujah. Amen. So I think around 2007
[1:38:18] September is when the Lord found me.
[1:38:20] When I stopped running and I gave up, he
[1:38:23] filled my heart with his love. Changed
[1:38:25] my life. When I came to a point, Lord,
[1:38:27] take everything from me that's contrary
[1:38:28] to your word that you can come and dwell
[1:38:29] in me. That was my prayer. Change me,
[1:38:32] Lord. I don't know what to do, but you
[1:38:33] know what you're doing. Hallelujah.
[1:38:36] Around that time, the Moodley family
[1:38:37] were praying for a pastor for
[1:38:39] Wellington.
[1:38:40] Amen. So, so their prayers and also
[1:38:43] Christine, I think around that time, it
[1:38:45] it it sunk in her heart. Maybe her
[1:38:47] husband's not even saved yet. Amen. So,
[1:38:50] she begin to pray. They begin to pray.
[1:38:52] What happened? A mountain started
[1:38:54] moving. Hallelujah. A mountain started
[1:38:58] moving. Did they know who they are
[1:38:59] praying for? No. Did they know where he
[1:39:01] was? No. Do they know what condition he
[1:39:03] was in? No. But God did. God knew the
[1:39:07] mountain. Amen. And faith moved the
[1:39:08] mountain. Hallelujah.
[1:39:11] Amen.
[1:39:13] Oh, my Robin had a mountain of of of
[1:39:15] tumor in her cancer in her throat. That
[1:39:18] mountain had to be moved. Amen. That
[1:39:20] mountain was moved. Amen. By faith in
[1:39:22] the word, believing we shall receive
[1:39:24] what we've asked for. Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:39:26] There's a mountain over Ben Baileyy's
[1:39:28] life. her grand her grandmother,
[1:39:30] grandfather prayed for him. Amen. Others
[1:39:32] prayed for him. But God in his season a
[1:39:34] certain day. Amen. God said, "I'm going
[1:39:36] to move that mountain. I'm going to take
[1:39:38] that mountain off his life." Cuz in
[1:39:40] there is a son of God. Hallelujah. David
[1:39:42] had a mountain of sin over his life.
[1:39:43] Unbelief. God moved the mountain. Amen.
[1:39:46] Why? By faith. Amen. We're not looking
[1:39:48] at the circumstances, looking at the
[1:39:50] promise, believing we shall receive it.
[1:39:53] Hallelujah. He's given us mountain
[1:39:56] moving faith. That's what Calvary's
[1:39:57] done. Amen. That the life of God would
[1:39:59] be expressed out of a people that we
[1:40:01] could stand in the breach. Amen. Cuz if
[1:40:03] you don't pray, who's going to pray? If
[1:40:05] you don't seek the Lord, who's going to
[1:40:06] seek the Lord? God has placed you in the
[1:40:08] kingdom for a time such as this. Amen.
[1:40:10] That's why it's so important. Stand like
[1:40:12] Esther stood. Amen. Don't knuckle down
[1:40:15] to the beggar. He's got nothing. He's
[1:40:17] got nothing to give you. He's not for
[1:40:19] you and he's got no power against you.
[1:40:21] Because if God be for you, who can be
[1:40:23] against you? Hallelujah. We could go
[1:40:25] through many names in this room. There
[1:40:27] was a mountain, but it got moved.
[1:40:29] Mountains of sickness, depression, evil
[1:40:31] spirits, sin, unbelief, trouble,
[1:40:33] whatever it was, God moved the mountain.
[1:40:37] Hallelujah. Did it happen all at once?
[1:40:40] No. Does it need to?
[1:40:44] No. Amen. Like brother says in great
[1:40:47] shining light, when you said mountain be
[1:40:50] moved and it stands there, you say,
[1:40:51] well, it didn't happen. Oh, it did
[1:40:53] happen. When you said mountain move,
[1:40:55] maybe one little
[1:40:57] insignificant grain of sand turned loose
[1:41:01] out of hundreds of billions and billions
[1:41:03] of tons. One little grain move, but it's
[1:41:06] begin to take place. Amen. Hold that
[1:41:09] faith and watch that mountain disappear.
[1:41:10] Certainly, thou shalt say in thy heart,
[1:41:12] disease move from my child. Disease move
[1:41:15] from my body in the name of the Lord
[1:41:16] Jesus. And don't doubt right there. The
[1:41:19] good germs take on new armor and a new
[1:41:21] weapon. And the enemy begins to back up.
[1:41:23] Hallelujah. He is defeated because of
[1:41:26] Christ in drinking of his mirror at
[1:41:28] Calvary. Defeated the devil and every
[1:41:30] one of his powers. And he stripped him
[1:41:32] of everything he had. And he's nothing
[1:41:33] but a bluff. He he can go with uh
[1:41:36] through with it. He'll do it.
[1:41:39] Amen. That's why we we've received that
[1:41:42] mountain moving faith. This is the whole
[1:41:44] purpose of message that we can impart
[1:41:46] eternal life. I mean, by the life that's
[1:41:48] within us can can spread. That's why
[1:41:50] when Legion went back home and the Lord
[1:41:52] told him, "Go tell go tell what the Lord
[1:41:54] has done, what God has done." It's more
[1:41:57] than just a testimony of of Jesus did it
[1:41:59] here, but but now he's not with me. No,
[1:42:01] he's with us. Amen. There's power in
[1:42:03] your testimony. There's power in the
[1:42:05] life. You know the token. The Holy Ghost
[1:42:07] has absolute power. Amen. Why? It's the
[1:42:10] power of God. Amen. It's got absolute
[1:42:12] power. That power to conquer hell,
[1:42:14] death, and the grave. That power lives
[1:42:16] in you. Amen. and creates an atmosphere
[1:42:18] around you every day. Amen. That what
[1:42:20] can cause eternal life to be imparted to
[1:42:23] other people?
[1:42:25] Can a son of God do it? Yes, he can
[1:42:27] impart eternal life by the life you
[1:42:29] live. You let the Lord live. Like Paul
[1:42:31] said, the life I now live, I live by the
[1:42:34] faith of the son of God. Amen. So Legion
[1:42:37] went back and he didn't just, you know,
[1:42:39] and and he shared his testimony what to
[1:42:41] do to prove, to vindicate, to
[1:42:44] demonstrate Calvary works. Jesus
[1:42:47] delivers. He transforms and makes people
[1:42:50] totally new.
[1:42:53] Amen.
[1:42:55] What does Calvary mean to you? What that
[1:42:57] day do to
[1:42:59] you? Did it stuff you up with some
[1:43:01] theology? Did it make you think I've got
[1:43:03] all the quotes you together to make you
[1:43:05] some proud arrogant message person? Or
[1:43:07] did it make or did it make you a
[1:43:09] Christian sold out? Hallelujah. What has
[1:43:11] it done to you? It's done mighty things.
[1:43:14] Amen. has caused you to sell out. It's
[1:43:16] caused you to become a real Christian.
[1:43:19] Amen. This is what Calvary I think
[1:43:21] friends, this is the day. If there ever
[1:43:24] should be a time when we should rejoice
[1:43:26] in the work of the Lord, it should be
[1:43:28] this day. It should be this day. Amen.
[1:43:31] That we have he has made us living
[1:43:33] witnesses of his resurrection. Amen.
[1:43:35] Proof that he rose. Why? Because when he
[1:43:38] rose, you rose with him. Amen. He's
[1:43:39] transformed your life. You're no longer
[1:43:41] legion in the tombs. Whatever tomb
[1:43:43] you're in, you're not there anymore. and
[1:43:44] you ain't going back. Hallelujah.
[1:43:46] There's nothing in you to go back. Amen.
[1:43:48] God has broke that thing in the name of
[1:43:50] Jesus Christ. Amen. Why? Now you return
[1:43:52] back to where you're from, publishing
[1:43:54] throughout the whole city the great
[1:43:55] things Jesus has done. Amen. Why? It
[1:43:58] makes you a living
[1:44:01] witness. Praise the
[1:44:03] Lord. So what is this? What is this? Out
[1:44:06] of uh so I'm just going to finish with
[1:44:07] this. out of them shall proceed
[1:44:09] thanksgiving and a joy uh and a voice of
[1:44:12] them that make merry. Amen. So like
[1:44:15] Legion's voice became a voice of joy.
[1:44:17] What should our voice be? A voice of
[1:44:19] joy. A voice of peace. Amen. Why?
[1:44:23] Because God's got it all in his control.
[1:44:25] That's what Calvary did. Calvary, Amen,
[1:44:28] restored man back to his proper
[1:44:30] position.
[1:44:32] Amen. Having dominion over the enemy.
[1:44:35] Amen. But we can make merry because the
[1:44:37] Lord has done great things. He's done
[1:44:39] great things in our lives and he's doing
[1:44:41] great things. He's moving many
[1:44:43] mountains. Amen. He's moving many
[1:44:45] mountains. Many grains of sand are going
[1:44:47] down. Amen. Why? Because you believe you
[1:44:49] shall receive. I mean, don't look at the
[1:44:52] size of the mountain. God spoke this
[1:44:54] universe into existence. I mean, what is
[1:44:56] a mountain of sin in someone's life
[1:44:58] compared to this universe?
[1:45:00] At nothing. You can't even see this
[1:45:02] earth virtually from Pluto. Pluto is
[1:45:05] just the edge. Well, what is the last
[1:45:07] planet in the solar system now? But you
[1:45:09] know, you know what I mean? You can
[1:45:10] barely see this planet from the edge of
[1:45:12] our solar system. How much more the
[1:45:13] other side of the universe? You can't
[1:45:15] see it. And we think our problems are so
[1:45:17] big. Yo, don't let the devil think that
[1:45:18] your problems are are bigger than God
[1:45:20] can handle. God can deal with it. Amen.
[1:45:24] And he has placed the Lord by the
[1:45:26] baptism of the Holy Ghost has given us
[1:45:28] mountain moving faith. So don't expect,
[1:45:31] it's not always instant, but one grain
[1:45:33] of sand begins to roll and then another
[1:45:36] grain, then another grain, then a
[1:45:38] landslide, then the thing comes down.
[1:45:40] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:45:43] Amen. So let Yeah. Anyway, let's have
[1:45:46] the musicians, please, this morning.
[1:45:48] That's my Easter message to you. We have
[1:45:50] the voice of triumph because the Lord
[1:45:52] has triumphed gloriously over our
[1:45:54] enemies. He set us free, washed us in
[1:45:56] his blood. We're new creatures in Christ
[1:45:58] Jesus. Amen. and and he's given us his
[1:46:00] faith to live by. Hey, never ever
[1:46:03] belittle the power of the Holy Ghost in
[1:46:06] your life. It's making an impact. It's
[1:46:09] making an impact. It's working.
[1:46:13] Amen. Praise the Lord.
[1:46:19] Amen. Amen. Let's stand. Amen. This
[1:46:21] morning, I want to sing that song again.
[1:46:24] I've been touched by his fire. Amen. Can
[1:46:28] we sing that
[1:46:32] song?
[1:46:42] Amen. Jesus blinded all my
[1:46:46] darkness. He sparked my heart with
[1:46:49] it. His grace and mercy root of
[1:46:53] passion comes to my sin.
[1:46:57] Now like a city on a
[1:47:01] hilltop, I'll shine through the
[1:47:04] night. I am a lamp made for his
[1:47:08] glory. I will not
[1:47:12] hide.
[1:47:15] Amen. I've been touched by his fire.
[1:47:20] Let the world come and watch
[1:47:25] me. Shout it from the
[1:47:29] rooftop. Shout until
[1:47:32] everyone has
[1:47:34] heard. This love will never be
[1:47:38] extinguished. It's alive and wild and
[1:47:42] free. I'm overtaken by his
[1:47:46] power. His spirit in me. His spirit in
[1:47:52] me. His spirit in
[1:47:54] me. Oh, I touched my fire. So let the
[1:48:01] world come and watch
[1:48:05] me. Shouting

[1:48:20] the world come and watch
[1:48:25] me. Shout it from the
[1:48:29] rooftop. Shout it till everyone has
[1:48:35] heard. Jesus has changed my life. His
[1:48:38] name be lifted high. His holy fire is
[1:48:42] burning inside of me. Hallelujah.
[1:48:46] Jesus has changed my life. His name is
[1:48:49] lifting up. His holy fire is burning
[1:48:53] inside of
[1:48:55] me. I cannot hold it inside. I cannot
[1:48:59] keep it quiet. This holy fire is burning
[1:49:03] inside of
[1:49:05] me. I cannot hold it inside. I cannot
[1:49:10] keep it quiet. This holy fire is burning
[1:49:13] inside of me.
[1:49:17] Yes, I've been touched by his fire. So
[1:49:21] let the world come and watch me
[1:49:27] burn. Shouting from the
[1:49:30] rooftop, shouting till
[1:49:33] everyone has
[1:49:36] heard. Oh, I've been touched by his
[1:49:40] fire. So let the world come and watch me
[1:49:47] burn. Shout it from the
[1:49:51] rooftop. Shouting till
[1:49:54] everyone has
[1:49:57] heard. Hallelujah. Amen. Praise the
[1:50:01] Lord. Amen. We got to sing that song.
[1:50:03] Amen. There's power in the blood. Amen.
[1:50:06] Transforming power. Hallelujah. Never
[1:50:08] tasted and seen. Amen. Taste and see the

[1:55:37] Lord, in different ways, Father. We're
[1:55:39] all bound up in darkness, Lord. But you
[1:55:41] came to find us, Lord, and to loose us,
[1:55:44] Lord God, to bring us out of the prison
[1:55:46] that we found ourselves in, Lord. That
[1:55:48] prison of sin and unbelief, Lord. Thank
[1:55:50] you for washing us. Thank you for taking
[1:55:51] us out of the prison, Lord. That we're
[1:55:53] no longer in that place, Lord, like
[1:55:54] Legion. Never went back to the tombs
[1:55:56] again. He never went being bound again
[1:55:58] by chains and being a being a mad man,
[1:56:00] demonpossessed. He never went back to
[1:56:02] that, Lord, because you set him free,
[1:56:03] Lord. He is found in his right mind,
[1:56:05] clothed in your righteousness, Lord.
[1:56:07] Clothe, Father, Lord, and walking back
[1:56:09] to where he came from to proclaim that
[1:56:10] you are the same yesterday, today, and
[1:56:12] forever. That your blood atones, your
[1:56:14] blood still works. We thank you, Lord.
[1:56:16] We can stand in 2025. We can have the
[1:56:18] same testimony Legion had. Lord, cuz the
[1:56:21] same power that set him free has set us
[1:56:23] free today. Thank you. We can walk in
[1:56:25] liberty this morning. Lord, I just want
[1:56:27] to pray for everyone here, Lord. Those
[1:56:29] who don't know the power of your blood,
[1:56:30] may we just heard about it, Lord. May
[1:56:32] they know it, Lord, in the name of Jesus
[1:56:34] Christ. May this Easter season be a
[1:56:36] death, burial, resurrection for them,
[1:56:38] Lord God. They died to themselves, Lord.
[1:56:40] They're buried. Father, in baptism, in
[1:56:42] the name of Jesus Christ, they come
[1:56:43] forth in newness of life filled with
[1:56:45] your spirit, Lord. May you grant it,
[1:56:46] Lord, in the name of Jesus Christ. May
[1:56:48] there be no one here that only knows
[1:56:50] about you. May everyone here say, "I
[1:56:52] know him." Hallelujah. I know him. The
[1:56:55] power of his resurrection. Grant it,
[1:56:57] Lord. I commit everyone here into your
[1:56:58] hands, Lord. We love you, Lord. Those
