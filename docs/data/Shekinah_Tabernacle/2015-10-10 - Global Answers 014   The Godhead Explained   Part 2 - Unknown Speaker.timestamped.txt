[0:23] welcome to global answers please join us
[0:27] as we discuss the relevance of God's
[0:29] eternal word relating to events in this
[0:32] day and what it means to you and now
[0:35] your host Lonnie Jenkins hello friends
[0:39] welcome to another session of global
[0:41] answers it's nice to have you with us
[0:43] this is a special time for me and I hope
[0:46] it's a special time for you I'm flying
[0:49] solo for last week and in that few weeks
[0:52] now in the future because I want to talk
[0:54] to you about the Godhead is he one is he
[0:58] - is he three last time we went through
[1:01] the scriptures in the Bible to show how
[1:03] that it's easily could be perceived
[1:05] there is one there was two there's three
[1:07] but we never reached any conclusion as
[1:10] to how many there are we went through
[1:12] the scriptures and now after the
[1:15] scriptures now we're wanting to go into
[1:17] some graphics to depict what is
[1:20] happening scripturally visually so that
[1:25] you can see see what's going on now what
[1:28] you see on your television screen right
[1:30] now represents the invisible God so I
[1:33] want to read to you now out of
[1:35] Colossians chapter 1 and you'll see the
[1:39] setting that we're using Colossians
[1:40] chapter 1 speaking of Christ chapter 1
[1:43] verse 15 who is the image of the
[1:46] invisible God the firstborn of every
[1:49] creature first first to come out from
[1:52] the creation of God was this firstborn
[1:54] which is Christ for by him we're all
[1:57] things created that are in heaven that
[1:59] are in earth visible and invisible
[2:01] whether they be Thrones dominions
[2:04] principalities powers all things were
[2:06] created by him and for him that's the
[2:10] port we wanted to make sure you
[2:12] understood by him and for him why is it
[2:15] for him because we find in the very name
[2:18] of Jehovah that he is the self-existing
[2:21] one who continually unveils reveals
[2:24] himself he is so big that there is no
[2:27] way that any of us could comprehend this
[2:30] great invisible God if he were to unveil
[2:34] all at once but he's been doing it
[2:36] little by
[2:37] and we'll show you that as we go through
[2:39] more of the Scriptures and he is the
[2:42] head scuse me verse 17 and he is before
[2:44] all things and by him all things consist
[2:47] and he is the head of the body the
[2:50] church who is the beginning the
[2:52] firstborn from the dead that in all
[2:55] things he might have the preeminence
[2:56] verse 19 for it pleased the father that
[2:59] in him should all fullness dwell and in
[3:03] Colossians chapter 2 verse 9 it says for
[3:06] in him dwelleth all the fullness of the
[3:09] Godhead bodily so when we speak of the
[3:12] Godhead we're speaking of course of
[3:13] Father Son and Holy Ghost so that's all
[3:16] were in this one Tabernacle according to
[3:19] scripture again back to the picture we
[3:22] see on on your screen in this invisible
[3:25] God were these manifold attributes and
[3:28] since he is Jehovah God that wants to
[3:31] unveil himself then we find that this
[3:34] unveiling has to take place it's been
[3:37] going on for thousands of years so this
[3:39] invisible God making a way for
[3:42] manifestations such as Judge and
[3:44] Redeemer and healer and guide and
[3:47] comforter all these various attributes
[3:49] God has laid out a plan through which he
[3:52] can unveil himself now this invisible
[3:59] God these attributes are in the
[4:00] invisible God so we're going to shrink
[4:02] the invisible God back because that's
[4:05] not what we're interested in we're
[4:06] trying to show the manifestation of the
[4:09] invisible God
[4:10] so this invisible God recedes back and
[4:13] is not not the one that we're interested
[4:16] in we're interested in this
[4:18] manifestation so out of the invisible
[4:21] God comes a form called a theophany
[4:24] and the biblical term excuse me a
[4:27] theological term which means a word form
[4:31] body and so this theological form now
[4:34] comes out from God because God is going
[4:37] to declare himself so this is the
[4:39] beginning now of the declaration of the
[4:42] thoughts of God the attributes of God
[4:44] which is in him so now this invisible
[4:47] God begins to pour himself and his
[4:50] attributes
[4:50] into this Thea phonic form which will
[4:53] find and we showed you last time that
[4:55] this form is Christ before he ever came
[4:58] to flesh its Christ the very power
[5:01] through which all of heaven and earth
[5:03] was created so all that God was now he
[5:06] pours into this Christ's form and now
[5:09] this is a body form as the invisible God
[5:12] is moving from the invisible down
[5:15] eventually to meet his creation in flesh
[5:19] as a savior so he's moving from the
[5:21] invisible down down down in dimension
[5:24] wise coming closer and closer down to us
[5:27] so it doesn't finish when God actually
[5:29] pours his attributes into him the God
[5:32] Himself steps into this tabernacle and
[5:35] then now this is the son of God in a pre
[5:39] figure now watch watch this again now so
[5:42] we've got God with his attributes
[5:44] recesses back out of God comes this
[5:47] Theia phonic form the scripture would
[5:49] call it a celestial body and then into
[5:52] this form God pours his attributes and
[5:54] then steps into this and the scripture
[5:57] calls this form the logos the logos of
[6:00] God and now all those attributes that we
[6:03] had seen previously in the previous
[6:06] drawing when he was invisible are now in
[6:09] this attribute you can see the various
[6:11] ones they are now in this Christ's form
[6:13] so all that God was he pours into this
[6:17] Christ's form and then this now hopes
[6:21] this doesn't shock you becomes the
[6:24] Lamb's Book of Life because God had
[6:27] created before the foundation of the
[6:29] world
[6:29] his entire family in his great thinking
[6:33] the Bible says our names were put on the
[6:36] Lamb's Book of Life before the
[6:38] foundation of the world the scripture
[6:40] says that Jesus was the lamb slain
[6:43] before the foundation of the world where
[6:47] did this take place in God's great
[6:49] thinking and so now the materialization
[6:53] of thought the expression of thought is
[6:56] word and then this term logos that you
[7:00] see at the top of the screen there that
[7:02] logos then
[7:04] we see now we see our definition that I
[7:06] showed you last time that the logos of
[7:09] God is Christ so here's our logos with
[7:13] our attributes that we've seen before
[7:15] here all manifested together and this is
[7:19] now Christ it is a theophany it is a
[7:22] body for Jehovah it is the anointing it
[7:26] is the Sun and a prefigure now this
[7:30] becomes extremely significant if this is
[7:34] the firstborn among many brethren and it
[7:37] is the Bible said so we read it last
[7:40] time he's the firstborn among many
[7:42] brethren
[7:42] then each of God's sons must come into
[7:46] manifestation for the same purpose so
[7:49] here we see that this Christ this logos
[7:52] is a tabernacle in which God Himself
[7:56] steps to manifest himself now let's jump
[8:01] forward to Jesus and think about what
[8:03] the scripture said about him the
[8:06] scripture says God was in Christ
[8:09] reconciling the world to himself so God
[8:13] had stepped into this virgin-born
[8:15] Tabernacle born of the Virgin Mary
[8:17] God had stepped in there to manifest
[8:20] another attribute which would be
[8:22] Redeemer or Savior now a redeemer in
[8:27] scriptural terms in the Old Testament
[8:29] was called a go el gol in the Hebrew and
[8:33] that means that to be a go el he had to
[8:36] be kinsmen so God in spirit form is not
[8:40] kin to us so God had to create a body
[8:44] step into a human form to declare
[8:47] himself and beak into us to be our
[8:50] Redeemer scripturally now jumping back
[8:53] again this logos the firstborn among
[8:56] many brethren the scripture called Jesus
[9:00] of Nazareth this Christ now is what we
[9:03] jump forward again to Colossians and it
[9:05] says Christ in you the hope of glory now
[9:09] we have understanding it's not a little
[9:12] Jesus inside of me it's Christ the logos
[9:16] the anointed where
[9:18] inside the believer first Peter tells us
[9:22] we are born again by the seed
[9:25] incorruptible the Word of God Genesis
[9:28] 111 tells us every seed brings forth of
[9:32] its own kind so therefore that seed word
[9:35] that is in the believer is there for the
[9:38] purpose of bringing a declaration of
[9:41] Christ once anointed by a baptism of the
[9:45] Holy Ghost
[9:46] the final step now as we go back to our
[9:48] screen again the logos this Christ from
[9:51] Strong's Concordance as the logos
[9:54] something said including the thought the
[9:57] divine expression Christ so therefore as
[10:01] long as we have the word and the our
[10:04] understanding matches God's thought
[10:06] behind that word that's Christ as soon
[10:10] as we inject a misunderstanding
[10:13] theological term that's not right some
[10:17] conjecture or doctrine or dogma that's
[10:19] not scriptural then it's no longer
[10:21] Christ it's no longer the seed Word of
[10:24] God it's hybrid now with something from
[10:28] man's opinions man's the theological
[10:30] thoughts reasonings that have been
[10:33] injected in and cannot produce what God
[10:36] called for it to be reproduced if we
[10:39] look at the Christian churches around
[10:41] the world we will see various levels of
[10:45] sometimes good living sometimes clean
[10:48] living sometimes living just like the
[10:51] world when we look at statistics let's
[10:55] say the divorce rate we find the divorce
[10:57] rate in the world and the divorce rate
[11:00] within the Christian church are equal
[11:02] what does that mean that many people
[11:05] have missed out on getting Christ into
[11:08] their life because Christ doesn't
[11:11] divorce so now something else has been
[11:14] injected to kill the effect of the
[11:16] transforming power of the Word of God
[11:19] and that's why we're having this study
[11:21] to show you one about God and two to
[11:25] show you how important it is that we
[11:27] stay with a pure Word of God that God
[11:30] can produce
[11:31] in us that which he desires to produce
[11:35] so now Colossians 1:15 who is the image
[11:38] of the invisible God so this Christ this
[11:41] logos
[11:42] becomes God condescending down that we
[11:45] might be seen the firstborn of every
[11:47] creature so we find in Scripture that
[11:51] the worlds were created by the word this
[11:54] logos so before there was a Sun a moon a
[11:58] star a wind a molecule and Adam before
[12:02] that there was Christ he was the
[12:05] firstborn of everything anything that
[12:07] came out from God it started with Christ
[12:09] then out of that came the angels and all
[12:12] the creations of God verse 16 for by him
[12:16] we're all things created that are in
[12:19] heaven that are in earth visible and
[12:21] invisible whether they be Thrones or
[12:24] dominions or principalities or powers
[12:26] all things were created by him and for
[12:29] him and he is before all things and by
[12:33] him all things consist
[12:36] exist are held into place John 1:1 in
[12:40] the beginning was the word so now we see
[12:43] that the beginning was God's thoughts
[12:46] materializing so in the beginning was
[12:48] this logos and the logos the Word was
[12:53] with God how the second person know in
[12:57] his great thinking God and his thoughts
[13:01] and the Word was God because it is God
[13:05] being expressed the same was in the
[13:08] beginning with God we saw that already
[13:11] in graphic form all things were made by
[13:14] him and without him was not anything
[13:16] made that was made God creates by his
[13:19] word and the word is Christ Ephesians
[13:22] 3:9 and to make all men know see what is
[13:26] the Fellowship of the mystery which from
[13:28] the beginning of the world has been
[13:30] hidden God who created all things by
[13:33] Jesus Christ so we see now the name of
[13:36] the logos the name of the word is Jesus
[13:39] Christ because Jesus was the Word made
[13:42] flesh
[13:43] so he carried
[13:44] the name of the word Jesus right with
[13:47] him Ephesians 3:14 it says for this
[13:50] cause I bow my knees under the father of
[13:53] our Lord Jesus Christ
[13:55] of whom the whole family in heaven and
[13:59] earth is named so now we find the whole
[14:01] family name is Jesus Christ why because
[14:05] Jesus Christ is the word the living
[14:10] anointed word and we find that we
[14:13] ourselves are born again by that same
[14:16] seed the word to declare our portion of
[14:20] the word that's why Paul said you are
[14:22] written epistles read of all men so we
[14:25] come out declaring our portion of the
[14:28] word are based on our place in the body
[14:31] and the age in which we're living and
[14:33] then Ephesians 2:10 says for we are his
[14:37] workmanship created in Christ Jesus so
[14:41] in that creation you saw when all those
[14:44] little attributes of God were coming out
[14:46] of God and into Christ we were included
[14:50] in there because we saw that was the
[14:51] writing of the book of life the Lamb's
[14:54] Book of Life so we were created in
[14:56] Christ Jesus unto good works that's part
[15:00] of the German part of the seed that's in
[15:02] a believer which God has before ordained
[15:05] that we should walk in them so we find
[15:08] all that Scripture
[15:09] is in us and we are there to live it out
[15:13] now in the great creation way back
[15:16] before there was a heaven and an earth
[15:18] there were two powers one of course was
[15:21] Michael which was the chief angel the
[15:24] chief architect of heaven the chief
[15:26] angel of heaven and then there was
[15:28] another power called Lucifer who was
[15:30] really actually God's right-hand man in
[15:33] heaven but Lucifer found he was so
[15:36] beautiful that he thought he could have
[15:39] a better church a better kingdom than
[15:42] God himself so he divided the kingdom of
[15:45] heaven and then certain angels followed
[15:47] after him the scripture says because of
[15:49] his beauty and they fell then and now
[15:52] we're known as fallen angels
[15:54] so the fall took place in heaven before
[15:58] there was a creation here on earth and
[16:01] so with the fall in heaven now humanity
[16:04] is now choosing under what anointing
[16:07] will we be Christ the logos the word or
[16:12] under Lucifer's anointing but we must
[16:16] remember both are very religious both
[16:19] worship God but one is right one is
[16:24] wrong attached to one is eternal life
[16:27] the tests together is damnation so now
[16:30] we see the war that started in heaven
[16:32] has already come to earth so in God's
[16:36] great creation then the first thing to
[16:38] come out from God according to the way
[16:40] would have to be to follow the pattern
[16:42] was the Sun the first thing that came
[16:45] out from God in the net in the spiritual
[16:47] was Christ the logos and Christ becomes
[16:51] the light of the world and God follows
[16:53] the same pattern where they're natural
[16:55] or spiritual so out of out of natural
[16:58] spiritual creation came to light Christ
[17:01] out of the natural creation would become
[17:04] the Sun and then out of this Sun
[17:07] creation would be a break off things
[17:10] that came out and became creation which
[17:13] in the case of what we're speaking of
[17:14] now then out of there came these all the
[17:17] stars moons planets a little different
[17:19] than science says but it follows the
[17:21] spiritual pattern and then out of this
[17:24] formation a great clinker comes off of
[17:26] the earth that great clinker cools and
[17:29] forms and becomes planet earth back when
[17:32] in the beginning God created some
[17:35] previous civilization seems to be in
[17:39] Scripture was on earth and they were
[17:41] judged and destroyed and then the earth
[17:45] was covered over with darkness a mist
[17:49] over the face of the deep and so we find
[17:52] then in Genesis 1:1 in the beginning God
[17:55] created heaven and earth period and then
[17:59] perhaps millions or billions of years
[18:02] passed and then verse 2 the earth was
[18:06] without form and void darkness was over
[18:08] the face of the deep and that was the
[18:11] earth left
[18:12] in its state of judgment and then then
[18:15] out of that just a few thousand years
[18:17] ago God began to bring forth and Eden
[18:20] out of this chaos of judgment and if we
[18:23] were to go further into this we had find
[18:25] a very similar thing types right back to
[18:28] the human soul and that we were created
[18:30] with this soul life of God in us was
[18:33] overshadowed by the Fallen nature of man
[18:37] once man fell we became under the
[18:40] Dominion to the Prince of the power of
[18:41] the air Ephesians 2 tells us and then
[18:44] God has to send a light and drive back
[18:47] the darkness to bring forth that which
[18:49] he wants within each one of his children
[18:52] that's not our subject so we won't stay
[18:54] stay in that subject so we're gonna jump
[18:57] forward in time now not to creation of
[19:00] heaven and earth because it has not to
[19:02] do with the Godhead but rather we jump
[19:04] forward all the way past Adam and Eve up
[19:06] to Abraham and we pick up our study of
[19:09] the Godhead at that place because we
[19:11] find that Abraham had a visitation and
[19:14] when he was when he had come back from
[19:17] the slaughter of the kings here's
[19:19] something God's prophet told us in this
[19:21] day that there was an appearance as
[19:24] Melchizedek to Abraham and this is God
[19:28] and we can read about it in Hebrews
[19:30] chapter 7 and it says that this
[19:33] Melchizedek had no father no mother no
[19:36] beginning of days no ending of life and
[19:39] so therefore it has to be God Himself no
[19:41] father no mother no beginning of days no
[19:44] ending of life so Abraham had a
[19:46] visitation of God as the king of Salem
[19:50] the king of Jerusalem the king of Salem
[19:54] of course came down from a New Jerusalem
[19:56] which one day the elect lady will will
[20:00] be will go to so in addition to our
[20:04] visitation to Abraham by Melchizedek we
[20:07] find very this manifestations of God so
[20:11] here to Moses this logos appeared as the
[20:15] kind of a part of a man the scripture
[20:17] says that he was the rock that followed
[20:20] them in the wilderness he was a pillar
[20:23] of fire by night and a
[20:25] cloud by day this is all that same
[20:28] Christ this led the children of Israel
[20:31] just like his leading Christ leading the
[20:34] church today in the in the form of the
[20:37] Holy Spirit as we will see as we
[20:39] continue on so this same Christ that led
[20:44] the children of Israel he was with them
[20:46] in the wilderness but he had told them
[20:49] that he would that God said I will meet
[20:52] you between the wings of the cherubim
[20:54] and so down over the mercy seat in the
[20:58] Holy of Holies God said I'll speak to
[21:01] you from between the wings of the
[21:02] cherubim it's always Christ and he's
[21:05] called the Angel of the covenant and
[21:07] Moses was says you know don't offend
[21:10] this angel because he said he won't show
[21:12] you mercy that was that was Christ in
[21:14] the old in the Old Testament just moving
[21:17] forward God continually manifesting
[21:20] himself continually manifesting himself
[21:22] this Old Testament vision that we excuse
[21:26] me example that we saw here when the
[21:29] children of Israel were travelling they
[21:32] the high priest only could go beyond
[21:35] this veil right here and into the
[21:38] presence of God but this same symbolism
[21:40] this same layout was placed in Solomon's
[21:43] Temple which was the place of worship at
[21:45] the time of Jesus Christ
[21:47] so this veil but in Solomon's Temple
[21:50] hiding the glory of guide huygens
[21:52] Shekinah hiding the mercy seat
[21:54] that's the veil that rent from top to
[21:56] bottom at Calvary
[21:58] so prior to Calvary you it was death to
[22:02] go into the Holy of Holies
[22:04] now it's death if we don't go in we must
[22:07] go into the presence of God by the
[22:09] baptism of the Holy Ghost
[22:11] that's God's promise and the blood of
[22:13] Jesus Christ made a way for us this same
[22:16] God the way that God spoke to us through
[22:19] seven church aged messengers in the Old
[22:24] Testament he spoke through the prophets
[22:26] and so each prophet we have here just a
[22:31] series of them not necessarily these but
[22:34] each of these prophets had an anointing
[22:36] a measure of Christ
[22:39] and so they became Christ's bringing the
[22:41] word to the people to Israel in in each
[22:44] age and the symbolism of what the
[22:47] prophets were to Israel the messengers
[22:50] to each church in revelations chapter
[22:52] two and three do the same thing unto the
[22:55] Angel of the Church of Ephesus right
[22:57] under the Angel of the Church of Smyrna
[22:59] right so this messenger this man to each
[23:02] age becomes a manifestation of Christ to
[23:05] the aged and to show you how important
[23:08] that is some may say oh I follow Jesus I
[23:10] don't follow a man jesus said if you
[23:13] receive whomsoever I sent you receive me
[23:17] and if he sends a messenger and we
[23:21] reject the messenger we have rejected
[23:23] Christ God has chosen to work through
[23:26] man when we follow this same Christ
[23:31] coming into manifestation he was spoke
[23:33] to Israel through the prophets and then
[23:36] this we know that Mary was overshadowed
[23:40] by the Holy Ghost to bring forth a child
[23:42] and as this child was birthed the
[23:47] attributes of God were dropped into this
[23:49] child and he was born the word of God so
[23:53] the word was made flesh and dwelt among
[23:56] us but not yet quickened you notice on
[23:59] our description on our video excuse me
[24:01] our graphic here that he is the this
[24:05] life of the logos didn't come in to the
[24:08] child at birth and you'll see why in a
[24:10] moment but he was the fullness of the
[24:12] word when he was born and then he as he
[24:16] goes on in his ministry now here's some
[24:19] quotes from a prophet in this day
[24:21] it says God in every age as I spoke last
[24:25] evening he told the end from the
[24:27] beginning
[24:27] he told what would be in each generation
[24:30] God in the sundry times he sent forth
[24:33] the prophets when each time come for
[24:36] those things to happen for that age he
[24:38] sent forth prophets and the word of the
[24:41] Lord always comes to the prophets the
[24:43] Prophet for that age and then each time
[24:45] the only thing that the Prophet did was
[24:47] manifest exactly the promise to that age
[24:50] and when the day of the Lord Jesus
[24:53] on the scene he was the manifestation of
[24:56] the word for that age he was Isaiah 9:6
[24:59] unto us a child is born and so forth so
[25:04] this same same logos that was with
[25:09] Christ
[25:10] not yet birth to it yet he was the word
[25:13] confounding the Sadducees and Pharisees
[25:15] with his knowledge of the word because
[25:19] he was the word he worked in a carpenter
[25:24] shop with us
[25:25] we'll call him stepfather Joseph but
[25:27] he's not yet quickened to his ministry
[25:30] but now as the Jesus the Living Word
[25:34] goes down to the River Jordan
[25:36] meets the prophet in the water and when
[25:40] he's there in the water then the
[25:42] scripture says something very special
[25:44] happens as the Spirit of God settles
[25:47] upon him and we see the Spirit of God
[25:52] like a dove coming into this vessel and
[25:56] now the word is quickened into
[26:01] manifestation and now he is the fullness
[26:04] of the Godhead bodily on earth now he
[26:09] moves into his ministry after a period
[26:12] of temptation upon the Mount of
[26:14] temptation so we notice now that we're
[26:18] going to find that that pattern follows
[26:20] each believer seed of predestination to
[26:25] be quickened by the baptism of the Holy
[26:28] Ghost just as Jesus was quickened the
[26:33] word was there but it had to be
[26:35] quickened to bring forth the
[26:37] predestinated manifestation and these
[26:40] exactly the same truths for every
[26:43] believer friends if that seed of
[26:45] election is within you you need the
[26:48] baptism of the Holy Ghost to quicken
[26:51] that seed to bring forth you into
[26:54] manifestation what God has called you to
[26:57] do in this age god bless you
