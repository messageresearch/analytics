faithful and true hallelujah amen praise the lord amen hallelujah amen hallelujah amen i mean thank you brother ed thank you musicians god bless you all good to see everyone tonight praise the lord welcome amen level two i thought we normally go up levels but hey this seems to be the other way around um but yeah just keep camp in prayer i will find out and i think a couple of weeks when the government makes an announcement but worst case scenario it'll be us and whoever's ministering best case scenario everyone's coming so let's just keep that in prayer amen um and also if you could remember us in prayer we're going up to tauranga for christine's brother joseph is getting married um i'm officiating the wedding so if you could remember i i just prayed the lord to be there and really just do her work and he has to just watch over us um i mean if you pray for us as we travel and for that but andy's preaching on sunday so i'm sure we have a good a good buffet amen praise the lord um and amen let's go to um psalms 18. well we'll have a bit of a prayer service tonight um i think it'll be good amen how's everybody how's everyone tonight everyone good yeah praise the lord amen psalms 18 and 1 we'll read down to verse 6. amen says here amen says i will love thee oh lord my strength now notice david when he's saying he says my a lot in this because god was personal to him i'd like to just uh in a very condensed form just preach a bit or to try and touch on uh you can't serve god through someone else i kind of touched it on sunday but i want to just kind of go through this a bit but see i will love thee o lord my my strength the lord is my rock and my fortress and my deliverer my god my strength in whom i'll put in whom i will trust my buckler and the horn of my salvation and my high tower i will call upon the lord who is worthy to be praised so shall i be saved from mine enemies the sorrows of death can pass me and the floods of ungodly men made me afraid the sorrows of hell can pass me about the snares of death prevented me in my distress i called upon the lord and cried unto my god he heard my voice out of his temple and my cry came before him even into his ears hallelujah amen praise the lord and we're just going to go to uh john 16 i'm going to read one verse here of john 16 which will be verse 13. amen i like that david he knew god he wasn't worshiping god through someone else's experience wasn't because of his father or mother sister or brother is because he met god himself amen it must be the same way because if we if it's just us and god walking things can come things can go people can leave people can come trouble can come trouble can go but you'll just stay steadfast and you've got to make sure that it's not you and someone else and god it's you and god amen and then so jesus said here in john 16 um yeah john 16 and verse 13 uh how be it when he the spirit of truth has come he will guide you into all truth for he shall not speak of himself but whatsoever he shall hear that shall he speak and he will show you things to come i mean so he's going to tell you when he comes to you he's going to lead you this is a one-on-one there's a one-on-one you know we know the rapture isn't sure sure it's a body of people being translated but the rapture is individual christianity sure we're a body but christianity is individual you and god amen let's just bow heads and word of prayer tonight i mean if you want to be removed and pray just want to lift up your hand before the lord amen let's just give thanks shall we gracious lord jesus how great you are lord um lord it just thrills my heart well we can read lord the psalm of david there where he keeps saying my god my lord my high tower my buckler my salvation lord and we can put ourselves in those verses because we know that the same god he met we have met lord we're so thankful that you're not a lord you don't have grandchildren lord you have sons and daughters lord jesus we just want to praise your holy name tonight that we can come lord into your presence lord and we can say like david that you heard our voice you heard my voice you heard my prayer out of your holy temple lord we thank you dear god that you're a personal god and father i just want to ask lord may you be very real lord may he touch your hearts lord may our hearts be soft and tender lord in your presence and may you just minister your word to our hearts may you anoint speaker and hearer lord may you touch me as well oh god lord i want more of you as well and you see the hands that have been raised here i just asked you would meet every need we want to thank you lord that you never run out of power you never run out of ability you never even diminish an ability or power lord jesus disabled to deliver or lord with you nothing is impossible father we want to thank you lord and you said to him that believeth all things are possible to them that believe so lord we are believers tonight lord you've made us thus so we want to thank you dear god pray take this prayer meeting under your divine control and may it not be us praying but maybe you praying through us oh god take our vocal cords take our lips lord take our tongues and speak father pray through us oh god may your spirit just intercede and take over oh god father because you really know what we have need of lord more than what we even think we need so may just have preeminence in this service be it those who are streaming tonight those who couldn't make it lord i pray you'd be their portion as well lord may you grant it for your glory we ask all these things in the name of the lord jesus christ amen amen god bless you friends you may have your seats tonight uh so i just want to um take a bit of time here uh i just as i said i love it how david would say the lord is my rock and my fortress my deliverer my god my strength and whom i trust my buckler and the horn of my salvation and my high tower david knew god in a lot of different situations but the main thing is that god was personal to david he wasn't a it wasn't god david did not worship god through his father or his brothers now this is very important because brother branham when he preaches on the message in absolute he he preaches it a couple of times and many times you know there's actually kind of i can put it this way two different kind of absolutes one is the the word of god right that's you say the external absolute but the author has to be the internal absolute within you and that is the main one you've got to have because really you've got to think about it just say if suddenly every bible vanished off the face of the earth all the message books were gone what is going to guide our lives it's got to be the living word inside us and that's really how it should be anyway remember we know the holy ghost feeds on the word so we should read the bible pray every day you know listen to the message feed but what i'm trying to say is it's more than just ink on paper being being our guiding point right it's the lord himself you think about when the apostle paul was here most of the bible wasn't even written they had the old testament they had a collection of letters that were passed around that that the people felt were were the word of god and we know that they are and it was only years years after the apostle paul died i not sure exactly how how far down the track that someone actually can compiled what we call the bible so what did the believers do you know it was more than just them and and i'm all for this i have myself printed thousands of message books and sent them to places and given bibles and everything but it was more than just the believers the new converts being given a message book they had to have someone in them to make that word live as as brother branham would say you know he would say you know and he is recounting billy graham where billy graham would rebuke ministers saying you bunch of lazy preachers you know i come into the city and 30 000 people give their lives to christ and you know but i come back and there's not even 30. and he says it's you lazy preachers because you know instead of you going out and seeing how the people were and trying to disciple them and bring them in and you know it's your fault and brother ram said you know billy i admire what you're saying but the thing is what did the apostle paul do because he went into a city met some people maybe met one person and their and their souls got lit by the holy ghost they came back a year later there was 30 from that one amen why because you could say they came in contact with the absolute which is our lord jesus christ himself and that same one that david met where god was became it was him and god that's it that's got to be the same way for us amen brother brahm says in the message um absolute 1962 this is this is uh this is the 30th of december so the next day he preaches is this the time of the end sirs and anyway he says gracious father so so this is in prayer at the end of the message gracious father i know that sometime we must part it's got to be a time that when we're going to leave this world we don't know what time that is it doesn't make too much difference if our time is finished then we want to come our objective of staying here is to serve you and since on the road to destructions one day as paul was on the road to damascus and made havoc of the church uh light blinded him and oh god that light followed him for it was christ and he anchored there to an absolute that even death itself he could laugh in the face of it and say thanks be to god who gives us the victory through jesus christ you become a complete absolute to that apostle amen you were the amen to him the amen is the final say right you were the amen to him in every sentence you were the star of his life the guidepost you were the compass that guided him through the storm you were the revelation you were the vision you were his hopes his salvation even at the hour of death when he knowed he was going to it you were still his absolute you were daniel's absolute you were all the prophets absolute in the midst of the denominational difference and the trouble of their days and the pharisees and sadducees still there was a man who took you for their absolute and today lord men and women with compassion with love and hearts that are bleeding lord for a real experience of knowing god and to have an assurance of an absolute maybe all the people ever know before lord was to join church and we realized as i've tried to sincerely not to be different i you know my heart but tell them that you cannot join the church you join the lodge the methodist the baptist catholic and pentecostal lodges and i could say you could join the shekinah tabernacle lodge you don't want it there's no joining papers in this place you want to say you want to join you'll probably have some intense fellowship with a couple of deacons you know there's nowhere to join here there's nowhere to join we're not joiners amen amen you cannot join you see you join the lot right um but you're born into the church the mystical body of christ and become members of his body with the gifts of the spirit to make his great body move in action and power god that's what these hands meant this morning when they went up place me o lord take me mold me make me just make my position in life such an absolute tied to christ that i'll think of nothing else but that absolute grounded lord bless them heal the sick and the inflicted save the lost so he said that the apostle paul became tied to the absolute on the road to damascus and that was his revelation that was the vision that was his hopes of salvation everything was him amen and that has to be the same thing with you and i now i'm not saying it's not but you've got to realize i've got an absolute i've got a final you know what brother ram say the umpire in a game and it doesn't matter how how they can you know do the replays and do all the stuff you know that man or woman on the field who's the umpire they have the final say it's out it's out it's in it's in it's a foul it's a you know no ball knock-on whatever it is you know they have the final say and it doesn't matter what the armchair critics say that are watching or you know they talk about in the post-game commentary that means nothing it's what happens on the field and what the absolute the umpire says that's what stands right so it's the same thing with you and i it's what our absolute says i mean what declares to us that which is his word that's what matters it's not the armchair critic or the keyboard warrior or you know the people have all the different kind of opinions it's not even our opinion that matters it's god's word that we should stick to because he is our absolute amen but that absolute has to be in us and i'll say what your absolute is as you become you will become like your absolute if you're absolute as some social media queen you'll become like that person or king or whatever they are there's so many different ones you know but if you know and even you your own self could become your absolute your own self-pity you know people become unthankful and they can't receive things in love that it was given them because it's not given in the way they thought it should be given and so they rejected they turn it down what's happened is actually their own self-pity their own pride becomes their absolute because they're becoming like that pride they're manifesting their absolute the apostle paul manifested his absolute amen right so you become whatever your absolute is tonight you will become or you have become you are becoming right so i trust that you can look back in your life and say once upon a time my absolute was a lot of things my absolute once upon a time was a lot of things once upon a time my absolute was danny morrison some people don't know who that is by the younger generations he was a fast bowler in the black what i didn't even know it was called the black cats back then but anyway i wanted to bowl like him i practice it i you know he was my absolute and then there's some other sports style just kind of shifted shift and shifted but then one day i met the real absolute the lord jesus christ and then it doesn't matter what comes around and you know no i've got an absolute and this one works this one's satisfying this one actually is real hallelujah and he transforms you from glory to glory i mean so whatever your absolute is you know this church could become your absolute god forbid god forbid you know shekinah tabernacle is your absolute you know brother abraham says you know he says he says i think we're not really getting the people to christ maybe i'm just you know if i'm repeating a lot of things that brother john andy said forgive me but it just kind of anchored into my heart right but we're going to get the people to the lord to the absolute you know because if you're absolute as the lord then if i if i backslide and i quit your whole family quits the whole church quits if he's really absolute you'll continue on amen sure you won't have sorrow and trouble you know we're not exempt from those things but you'll still serve god amen and that's how we want to be though if the whole world say there's no no such a thing as god everyone just becomes an atheist if you really have the absolute or if they just become religious if you really have the absolute lord jesus christ inside you you'll continue on and that's how we want to be amen we you know we need him to be our absolute illness in this in this age of voices and opinions and and experts and whatever hashtags going let the hashtags go who cares about hashtags you know someone said i can't remember who said it but they quoted c.s lewis and he said in order to go somewhere you have to leave somewhere which makes sense so in order to come to church i had to leave my home that's not rocket science but if something is holding you back from more of the lord you need to leave it you need to leave that thing if it's unforgiveness if it's some little thing you do in the dark you know something that's caught your affections you need to leave that in order to walk on with god right the apostle paul left his phariseeism he left his reputation he left what gamalia thought of him and all the sanhedrin difference he had to leave that he said i counted it all but dung though i may have this absolute hallelujah so he had to leave that in order to gain something amen and we have to be the same kind of way we're gonna be willing to leave things just just let it go let it go chop it free say i'm done with this thing i want more of god who wants more of god there's more to have so it's a good thing hallelujah we haven't even touched the sides of the you know i just feel like you know i don't know what the biggest like you know you brothers were at that market thing in china you're the all the expo thing i feel like with god we've just literally walked in the front door and and and seen the first kiosk there's so much more of his word to enjoy and experience and to you know so let's not just stop here let's keep walking but if you walk through the front door you've got to leave the front door and keep walking it's still all of god's you're not leaving god to get more of god but you know there's more to have so we don't want to hold on to things that's why the apostle paul would say lay aside every weight and sin that does so easily beside us let's run the race so you've got to leave the weights and the sins to walk on or to run on rather amen so he had an absolute now you can see all the real believers down through the scripture met that same absolute and they didn't care what public opinion said or what the other believers were doing they were determined that they would walk with that absolute it sounds like i'm in a mix of a toilet and a shower and a subway pipe all at the same time up here i don't know what's going on not that i've been in such a place anyway but it sounds real funny up here now caleb and joshua were two of the twelve spies that went into canaan they heard the same preaching moses they all of those spies heard the same preaching from moses they saw all the same miracles they saw they they were in the miracle they walked through the red sea they experienced it you know it wasn't just a you know something they heard they they they heard the screams of the egyptians on the night of the passover you know they experienced all that but their absolute was different to the other 10 spies because the other 10 spies as absolute was based on what they could see with the five senses and that shifts you know who who's woken up and felt grumpy who's woken up and felt happy who's woken up and said i needed about five coffees at least and i can start functioning so so your five senses i mean how you feel goes up and down it changes like the weather right on steroids it changes but that's not an absolute that's a shifting absolute right so the other 10 spies they're absolute shifted that sure it was easy when when when moses was doing everything but then they had to actually testify of what they believed and because the absolute wasn't in them because it says even even in numbers god says that there's a there was a there's a different spirit with caleb and joshua which was the holy ghost right so they had an absolute like the apostle paul and if you really have the absolute of the word then whatever the promise of the word is for you you'll say that's my that's mine i'm gonna take it because you're titan because the absolute in you which is the lord wants to fulfill the promise of your day irrespective of obstacle trouble trial within without those things don't come into it you're tied to an absolute he following me right tied to an absolute so the other spies there absolute wasn't faith like caleb and joshua and they told the people they all saw the same land but they said there's giants they've got big walled cities where grasshoppers in their site and as i've said before i doubt very much they kind of phil took a survey for him and asked some questions do we look like grasshoppers what do we look like in your site a normal size b big c grasshopper d all of the above you know it was just something that they worked out in their mind we're like grasshoppers on their site well you know but the thing is because their absolute wasn't the absolute even though they would have said sure we're circumcised jews we believe in jehovah look moses is our prophet we believe the message of the hour but the absolute wasn't in them but caleb and joshua they saw the same people they saw the same cities they saw the same trouble they said let's just go take it now why because the absolute was in them hallelujah so they didn't look at circumstance they just looked at the promise and i'll say it was the absolute oh you're following me because that was anchored in them what they saw didn't matter it was the promise that mattered amen now brother braham says in the power of god he's talking about a boy flying a kite you know because storms come and go don't they i say the state of your mental alertness varies very much when you wake up you can have a good day a bad day a horrible day a terrible day you know there's a lot of different days you can have but if if you're tied to the absolute it doesn't matter how stormy life gets or how much trouble you can be pitched upside down in a free fall but if you're tied to that absolute amen it's something that is unmovable in our lives he's talking about a boy flying a kite he says we have an anchor amen that's in the veil like the scripture says we're anchored within the veil that's someone who's tied to the absolute that the absolute's in them there's a tie that cannot be broken we can't see it sometimes but we know it's there like the little boy was flying the kite they said where's it at said i can't see it said i know it's still there because i can feel it so this kiter went up into the clouds and he didn't know where it was but he still still felt the tension on the line hallelujah it wasn't just flapping in the breeze he knew it was there but why could he say that but the others couldn't because he's feeling a pull i mean he's feeling a tug i mean i feel the pull of the hour i mean but the others are just spectators but i don't think i'm looking at spectators i think i'm i'm looking at kite flyers oh look at that anchored beyond the veil i don't mean that as a joke but you know what i mean he says here so that's right we may not be able to see it times get dark the clouds may hide his blessed face for a spell remember the clouds may hide his face but it don't hide him it can hide the sun from you but it's still shining beyond the clouds and faith sees the sun beyond the cloud and here was moses mother in the conflict of testing of her faith and every child every son that cometh to god first must be tried god test your faith now look like god would just simply bypass the whole thing and and don't have any appropriate away and just cut the thing off but it's better that he gives you a test and then comes to you when you're in the test i like that don't you the well he comes to you in the test he said i'm going through a trial he wants to meet you in that trial where'd he meet the three hebrew boys in the fire not before the fire and the fire hallelujah so it's good to be in the fire now i um i like that don't you the greatest experience of my life is when i come up against the mountain i can't get over it under it or around it and and just stand still and god will move the thing back he will move no matter how dark the cloud is faith passes it yonder with an eye that looks beyond anything that the devil can set before you because god is our victory amen hallelujah amen now um this is from the this is from the um piece that was printed in the full gospel businessmen's um magazine where they printed the whole account of brother brown talking about going beyond the curtain of time and and this is just a portion of it this is the end of it he says whatever you do lay aside everything else until you get perfect love that we know perfect love is the holy ghost right it's not like you get the holy ghost then you're gonna get perfect love he is perfect love right so get to where you can love everybody even every enemy he says no matter if the plane is rocking the lightning's flashing or the guns of the enemy are upon you these things do not matter get perfect love so you're saying it doesn't matter what the state you're in or the circumstances who's been in a plane where it's rocking and pitching and you know first time with brother adrian to vanuatu there was a big storm and we were landing on a island with a you know dirt runway and it was so wet we skidded off it and the and the road has started cutting the long grass we're fine but you know you know we've had stuff like that going but it doesn't matter what's going on right if you have the lord those things don't matter amen you say but it's very real no no your absolute is more real than the circumstance because circumstances come and go troubles come and go but the absolute the lord jesus christ abideth forever hallelujah so he says these things do not matter now we could you'd say but but they do matter i'm going through something but relative to him relative to him living you're tied to the absolute they don't matter amen he says if you're not saved except jesus christ is your savior now if you have not been baptized in water be baptized now if you have not received the baptism in the holy spirit receive it now press on to that perfect love which will take you to that beautiful and joyful place beyond the curtain of time hallelujah amen and one account where he gives that uh he's singing at the end and and there's a song let us look past the curtain of time and he says lord let them look past the curtain of time wouldn't that help so well wouldn't it help you say well what is it when you feel the brush of angel's wings brother says you feel that real sweet humble feeling come upon he says that's that's angels coming around you that's the lord coming around you what is that that is actually the effects of beyond the curtain of time that's the land beyond the river drawing near to let you know you belong on that side you don't belong here you belong up there that's why you just you know he's such a presence his presence comes around you may be in prayer driving in the car washing dishes you may be at work you may be at school wherever you may be and then he drills near what is that that's him beyond the curtain reaching out hallelujah and in those moments you realize nothing really matters nothing else really matters i've got a home in glory land that outshines the sun amen and he wants you to to to realize amen this life may be shifting sands but he is not and if you're tied to that absolute like the apostle paul he had good days he had bad days and he lists off a whole bunch of bad days that we've never i've never been shipwrecked i've never been beaten i've never been stoned i never had to run for my life you know i've never had who's had anyone you know he had a lot of but he was tied to an absolute the absolute the lord jesus christ and that same absolute i trust is your absolute that he is your absolute hallelujah amen so that you don't we don't worship god through another person now what do you mean by that well your relationship with god if you're worshiping god through another person then how they they are doing dictates to you how your relationship with god is doing so if they're up you're up if they're down you're down if they do something that's absolutely sideways it just throws you right and sure these things will throw will will will throw us but if you're tied to the absolute it won't throw you all the way down right so are you worshiping god through your parents through your brother your sister your mum or dad you know that if they're up you're up oh god's real because look at my parents you know or my brother or the pastor or the deacons or whatever you know god's real cause of them but what if they fall what's going to happen to you and your walk see if you're tied to the absolute doesn't matter what happens to them you'll keep walking on amen i trust i trust that we're not serving god through someone else we're not serving god because of this church or serving god through this church brother and says the greatest deception the world's ever faced is right now because people are thinking they're worshiping god through a church through a system but they're not amen but i'm glad that he is our absolute amen is he your absolute tonight hallelujah that it don't matter what happens amen he's our god and he's going to see us through the apostle paul would say in ephesians 4 this i say therefore and testify in the lord that he henceforth walk not as other gentiles walk in the vanity of their mind having the the understanding darkened being alienated from the life of god through the ignorance that is in them because of the blindness of their heart who being past feeling have given themselves over unto lasciviousness to walk to work all uncleanness with greediness but ye have not so learned christ you haven't learned him it hasn't been a school to you it hasn't been a textbook it hasn't been a theory test it hasn't been a seven steps to becoming a believer this is not how you've you know you have not so learned christ but so so what he's saying is that the absolute you've met the absolute amen if so be that ye have heard him not heard of him there's a big chasm between hearing of him and hearing him amen when you really hear his voice and he speaks to you directly calls you something grips your heart that's hearing him amen and the voice of god is in the bride of christ where is god people say he's in his people amen sure he's in his word but the words and the people is the gods and the people amen so if so that ye have heard him and have been taught by him not been taught of him but been taught by him so he's the inside teacher the spirit of truth when he comes he will he will lead you into all truth amen so it does not say that you have heard of him and that have been taught of him no that ye have heard him he's called who's caught has he called you amen amen he called david and david said he's my god my salvation my buckler my shield my high tower i mean when i cried with my voice he heard my prayer hallelujah amen see there's no nothing between the believer in god the blood has annihilated every wall of partition there's no chasm no more he just filled it in hallelujah amen now as the truth is in jesus that ye put off concerning the former conversation the old man which is corrupt according to the deceitful lust and be renewed in the spirit of your mind and that you put on the new man which after god is created in righteousness and true holiness wherefore putting away lying speak every man truth with his neighbor for we are members one of another be anger and sin not let not the sun go down upon your wrath neither give place to the devil let him that stole steal no more but rather let him labor working with his hands the thing which is good and that he may have to give to him that needeth let no corrupt communication proceed out of your mouth but that which is good to the use of edifying that it may minister grace into the hearers and grieve not the holy spirit of god whereby you're sealed into the day of redemption don't grieve the absolute amen we want to live a life that pleases him not that we're trying to earn salvation we know we we can't do that eh people do because because people think it's man's effort can get them to heaven no it's one man's achievement that gets us to heaven the man christ jesus amen let all bitterness and wrath and anger and clamor and evil speaking be put away from you with all malice and be kind one to another tender hearted forgiving one another even as god for christ's sake hath forgiven you hallelujah amen i'm just going to read one more um i'm gonna read one more quote and then we're gonna pray but i trust is he your absolute is he your everything is he the finals is he the first say and the final say in your life amen he says now now this is how powerful the word of god is and you and i he said now this isn't the conflict between god and satan he says but god at the beginning gave his children the atomic weapon because he's the infinite god now seeing that there was going to be a conflict and there was going to be a battle god equipped his children with the right kind of ammunition the right kind of an attack the right kind of everything that they had need of that would sweep them all the way from eden to the rapture hallelujah what was it the word the word that's what defeat satan is the word now when i say the word i'm not it's when this becomes alive in you right because he is the word he's a person i mean so so if he is in you amen that that word will overcome satan battles come in your mind what happens the lord is the soldier on the battlefield right whole bunch of things he tossed two and three throw in your mind but if you really just surrender it to the lord he'll he'll he'll come on the scene change your thinking show up for what it is defeat that devil amen amen uh what is it the word the word that's what defeat satan is the word it'll defeat him anywhere any place now why do we want to substitute something else when we've already got the best thing there is the word and we find jesus on earth just to prove his this was the best equipment when satan come in hand-to-hand combat with jesus he never just reached over with his power and tied his hands he just took the same weapon that god gave in the garden of eden his word and said it's written it's written and he punched him right out of the ring with it that's right because it's god's best and look where it is it's not just for one or two in a church it's for every one of us who's us hello here we are me me i'm an us what there's no iron team but there's me right so amen we're in the ass every believer has a right to take this word and fight the enemy anywhere you meet him anywhere you meet the enemy this word is what you have to use and jesus proved it when he come so he equipped his children with the word for their protection against the enemy when the all-out warfare comes in the battles and and set an array then there's only one thing a real soldier can use a real christian soldier that's thus saith the lord walk right out there and meet the enemy with the assurance that nothing thousand may fall at my right hand ten thousand at my left but it won't come neither just remember that god made this statement and give this to his children and it's the best that's ever been yet amen so we have a weapon this world wants hypersonic missiles we've gone far beyond hypersonic we've got we've got dimensional traveling weapons hallelujah it'll take sweep them all the way from eden to the rapture so the word of god and the believer will defeat satan anytime anyplace anywhere amen so maybe let's um just finish there but but let's just sing a song that will go into prayer amen but are you glad there's that day when he tied you to him the absolute hallelujah many days you know up and down you know before that but then there's an anchor came into your soul oh did i read that no i don't think i read that if i can find it here sorry i've got it here i thought i'd have it here i thought i had it no sorry if you don't mind i'll just put it on my phone if it's oh yeah here it is from jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever the lord is here if i'm sick in body he's got me happy in my soul if things are good things are good in my soul and bad in my body or vice versa it makes any difference god is always there and i'm always stimulated with a pleasure that's a joy and speakable full of glory that's what he does for the believer so things can be good i'm rejoicing in my soul things are bad i'm rejoicing in my soul i'm healed i'm rejoicing in my soul i'm sick i'm rejoicing in my soul friends don't like me anymore i'm rejoicing in my soul friends love me i'm rejoicing in my soul there's trouble i'm rejoicing in my soul there's peace i'm rejoicing in my soul hallelujah with a giant speaker full of glory that's what he does for the believer amen hallelujah is that some kind of nirvana peace that we obtain to no no it's a realization that my life is in his hands and everything we go through is for a reason and we never can have a bad day if our life is in his hands because he is pr he has planned that day for you and i he's got a very good skill maybe a very interesting schedule but he has a schedule for you and i but it's all for a purpose and it's all for our good you can't lose being a christian one of my favorite quotes from the prophet amen um you know i had a song in my heart when i was walking here and it's just totally escaped me um let's just sing that song um set your wings to the winds of faith shall we i mean shall we stand tonight we'll just um we'll sing this and then we'll just have a time of prayer together amen there are two roads you may take i want to take faith every time amen there are you may take one by side one by faith the word of god all what you see what you believe is
