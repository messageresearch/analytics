[32:28] I'm thankful to be alive I'm thankful to
[32:30] be facing the enemy in this season
[32:33] Hallelujah so tonight as we have read
[32:36] there uh many many many months ago we
[32:39] spoke about
[32:41] H the power of your amen or what your
[32:45] amen means to you that
[32:48] was after Co sometime I can't remember
[32:50] where but while we are there let's just
[32:53] read another
[32:54] scripture Numbers Chapter 23: 19 to 21
[32:59] the Bible says God is not a
[33:03] man God is not a
[33:06] man he doesn't eat
[33:09] KFC he does not participate in human
[33:13] activities as we
[33:16] do God does not
[33:18] forget so God therefore is not
[33:24] a um I'd like to
[33:28] to participate with you God is not a man
[33:32] that he should lie neither the son of
[33:36] men that he should repent which means
[33:40] everything that God says
[33:45] goes which means everything that God
[33:48] says it cannot come
[33:51] back and we say let's try again so
[33:55] everything that God says sorry about
[33:57] that it
[33:59] goes
[34:03] um put this one on
[34:07] apologies
[34:09] now that scripture
[34:11] says that he should repent had he had he
[34:15] said and shall not do it if God says
[34:18] something there's no way in which it
[34:20] cannot happen his Word is Alive H
[34:23] Allelujah he is or had he spoken and
[34:27] shall not not make it good behold I have
[34:31] received Commandments to bless and he
[34:34] had blessed and cannot reverse it so
[34:38] this was the this this portion I'm
[34:40] reading it was it's about the story of
[34:41] the Prophet called balam balam balam bam
[34:46] Josh bam you know when he was talking to
[34:49] the king uh the king of the enemy I
[34:53] think it was his name is
[34:54] balak when he was talking to him and
[34:57] that man there had a deal that he should
[34:59] cast Israel so this is what came out of
[35:03] the lips when he said God is not a man
[35:05] that he should lie let's go to verse 20
[35:07] behold I have received a commandment
[35:10] balam says I have received a commandment
[35:13] to
[35:14] bless Hallelujah not to Cur and this
[35:17] cannot be reversed this is the prophet
[35:21] who intended deliberately and agreed
[35:24] with the Enemy to ciss the people of God
[35:27] but out of his
[35:29] lips he says I
[35:32] bless he ha not beheld iniquity in
[35:36] Jacob neither had he seen per has he
[35:40] seen perverseness in Israel the Lord is
[35:43] good is with him the the Lord is the
[35:48] Lord his God is with him and the shout
[35:52] of a king is among them one more
[35:56] scripture I just want to see if we can
[35:59] re make these scriptures relate or build
[36:01] build sort of a a context in what we
[36:04] want to talk about Jeremiah
[36:07] 29 um you we heard that he's not a man
[36:10] but let's hear now for I know God says
[36:14] for I
[36:16] know the thoughts that I think toward
[36:20] you this is very deep
[36:23] for I know the thought that I the
[36:26] thoughts that I think towards you sayth
[36:29] the Lord the thought of Peace not of
[36:33] evil to
[36:35] good to give you an expected end so this
[36:41] is if you just pause and think about
[36:43] this What God Says you'll realize that
[36:46] many a times human beings Humanity as it
[36:49] is we behave as if God did not think or
[36:53] God does not have a plan about us this
[36:56] is just for real many times including
[36:59] Christians we conduct ourselves or
[37:01] behave in such a way that it suggests
[37:05] that
[37:06] God could be still investigating how
[37:10] he's he planned about us you know it's
[37:12] like we've got a plan for ourselves am I
[37:14] wrong or
[37:16] right now tonight we just want to
[37:18] quickly speak about just before we
[37:21] pray I say here becoming the
[37:25] amen we know what the word amen means
[37:27] right but I want to to really give the
[37:30] emphasis or the context to that
[37:33] statement at the bottom the power of
[37:35] your confession and declarations by
[37:39] faith you see there is
[37:42] power in what you
[37:45] confess there is Authority there is as
[37:48] long as you are a son and you are a
[37:50] daughter of God there is
[37:52] power he said in Revelations 3 these
[37:56] things
[37:57] at the end in the Book of Revelation
[37:59] these things speaketh the
[38:02] amen so am I in the position right now
[38:06] sister naom to be the amen that he
[38:10] is because we we know that amen means so
[38:14] be it right does it mean in other
[38:17] explanations it means true truly so be
[38:21] it which means that is as is as you hear
[38:26] it amen so be it so the Bible says so
[38:30] speaketh the amen the true the true the
[38:33] true witness the beginning of the
[38:36] creation of God Jesus Christ himself so
[38:39] he wants you to be his word he wants you
[38:42] to be him to be like him to for him to
[38:46] be
[38:47] you that is why I wrote that word
[38:49] becoming the
[38:50] amen so whose amen should me and you
[38:56] be he
[38:58] him because he is the
[39:00] amen I hope you'll get me as we go along
[39:04] but I just want to focus on the power of
[39:08] your confession when I sit there on the
[39:12] floor or on the chairs there or I'm
[39:15] sitting somewhere working maybe I'm
[39:17] brother Armand cleaning the carpet maybe
[39:19] I'm sitting I'm driving maybe I'm doing
[39:22] some work in the office or whatever
[39:24] you're
[39:25] doing what is it that you are conf
[39:29] confessing huh what is it that I am
[39:32] confessing what what what am I
[39:36] confessing because he said everything
[39:39] that I said about you about me it shall
[39:43] not come God is not a
[39:45] man everything that he said he will do
[39:48] he will do is if he said I will heal you
[39:52] he will heal you but what am I
[39:54] confessing
[40:00] you
[40:01] see H God cannot hold you on Ransom he
[40:06] cannot hold you on to he cannot force
[40:08] you to to be like
[40:11] him but if he chose you that you are his
[40:16] you are going to come reflecting him the
[40:20] reflection and the image that you are
[40:21] going to be at the end is what he said
[40:24] despite all the challenges despite what
[40:27] whatever way you may want to go or I may
[40:29] want to go lack of Revelation lack of
[40:32] anything but if he said I will make you
[40:35] mine and you are mine you will be his at
[40:38] some point so that is not the point of
[40:40] discussion the point of discussion is am
[40:42] I part of that happening am I am I
[40:46] confessing on a daily basis because I
[40:49] like to be practical I'm not this person
[40:52] who preaches this H uh Big M mystery and
[40:58] hidden teaching there's people who are
[41:00] gifted to do that I want to I'm very
[41:02] practical to say on a daily basis I'm
[41:06] not well maybe I'm hurt maybe I'm
[41:09] injured maybe I'm not well in body but
[41:11] what am I confessing because he said I
[41:14] am the Lord your God who Health your
[41:16] diseases sometimes you will even hear a
[41:19] Christian saying or my
[41:22] my my sugar diabetes you know my my uh
[41:27] identifying with something that is not
[41:32] his saying my you know uh my my my poor
[41:38] estate you know like my so identifying
[41:41] and owning up to something that is not
[41:42] actually yours so my question is that if
[41:46] a Christian talks like that a Believer
[41:49] speaks in that way sister Vanessa saying
[41:52] ah you know
[41:54] my my blood pressure
[41:57] or my identifying you know my this is
[42:01] not your
[42:03] problem if it's not the
[42:06] devils and you a daughter of God then
[42:09] leave it in God's hands it's not for you
[42:12] so let's not own let's not confess
[42:15] because look the question is that if you
[42:18] speak like that I just want to us to
[42:21] unpack this if you identify yourself
[42:24] with those kind of things and and many
[42:26] times we do it consciously because of
[42:28] the way we are used to talk without
[42:30] listening to ourselves without even
[42:33] consciously or even actively hearing
[42:35] what I'm saying I'm talking to this man
[42:39] here we the enemy because he knows that
[42:41] you are a child of God and you are
[42:43] powerful and what you say goes just like
[42:46] God put because you are an unnature God
[42:48] did you hear the pastor some few weeks
[42:50] ago saying you are an amature God you
[42:53] the moment I know who I am it means
[42:55] everything that I speak or profess or
[42:59] Express even if you're
[43:01] joking even when you're
[43:04] joking it goes to that level a Son of
[43:06] God when you say something it
[43:10] happens now if you say my my cancer or
[43:15] my or my one my one the doctors are the
[43:18] it's not yours my problem is this
[43:22] there's two two or three possibilities
[43:24] when you talk like that it's either
[43:28] is either you don't know who you are
[43:33] yet or it's not you
[43:38] speaking because the enemy is able to
[43:40] use your mind to use your your lips the
[43:42] enemy so maybe we we need to deal with
[43:44] that enemy that makes you or me talk
[43:47] like that that's
[43:49] right because you cannot own something
[43:52] that's not yours you cannot be allow
[43:55] yourself to own
[43:57] no no confess right I must confess right
[44:02] I must confess love healing peace
[44:06] regardless of what is around me am I
[44:09] right correct me if I'm
[44:12] wrong but a Christian cannot own those
[44:15] things I'm just giving example of
[44:17] diseases but a Christian cannot own H
[44:21] who someone always say say we always
[44:24] happy we are always it's not like we
[44:27] don't have challenges Esther it's not
[44:30] like we don't have problems we do but we
[44:33] live
[44:34] beyond because remember we are not
[44:37] controlled by the situations of this
[44:39] world actually this flesh this flesh we
[44:42] are we are supposed to live beyond it
[44:44] there is a body that is living in us
[44:48] that operates not from
[44:51] here the same body that made Peter do
[44:54] you think Peter if you think of phys
[44:57] physics and really science do you think
[44:59] Peter could walk on
[45:00] water do you think it was Peter it was
[45:04] Peter in a different
[45:07] form you know we operate in three bodies
[45:10] we operate in in three levels there a a
[45:12] flesh there's a a a a a glorified body
[45:17] there's a theophan you know we operate
[45:19] within those bodies and my theop and
[45:21] your theop is not far he's right here
[45:24] walking beside you but the question is
[45:27] is you and me where do we operate
[45:30] from where are you operating from when
[45:32] you said I yeah I'm stuck with this
[45:36] problem it's
[45:38] mine who's talking there is that your
[45:41] theophany or is this guy this guy can be
[45:44] Infested by a lot of
[45:45] demons infested and the only pesticide
[45:49] to deal with that is the holy spirit is
[45:52] the correct confession amen
[45:57] I wrote here
[45:58] that you are saved by your confession
[46:02] not only your confession but your
[46:04] confession is of what he said about you
[46:08] in his word because when you confess you
[46:11] don't just confess more your own ways
[46:13] isn't it you confess his way his
[46:16] thoughts about you you confess what he
[46:19] said about you because my word your word
[46:21] cannot stand but his word which I
[46:24] believe and I confess that that is what
[46:27] actually makes the difference and that's
[46:29] what I'm talking about tonight that is
[46:32] what saves you if you believe you'll see
[46:34] as we go along what I'm talking about
[46:37] believe what he said confess what he
[46:39] said then it shall come to
[46:43] pass
[46:45] Hallelujah H confession comes in many
[46:49] different ways I wrote here you know uh
[46:53] it can come by means of you asking for
[46:54] forgiveness from someone you confess
[46:57] your mistakes and say brother Isaac
[46:59] forgive me my brother um you know
[47:02] yesterday when I passed the pizza shop
[47:05] you didn't see me but when I left at the
[47:08] door there at the piz I took one can
[47:10] there I stole it so please forgive me
[47:13] you see you're confessing your sin
[47:14] you're asking for forgiveness you're
[47:17] confessing and in there there's a
[47:19] blessing if you do that if you are a son
[47:22] of God it won't sit well with you so you
[47:24] confess so there's confession by means
[47:26] of asking for forgiveness or there's a
[47:28] confession of
[47:31] love for God so loved the world you know
[47:34] we have recently witness a beautiful
[47:36] beautiful beautiful event when a young
[47:39] man and a young woman confess love to
[47:41] one another you saw that that's a
[47:43] confession of
[47:46] love you can confess by means of your
[47:48] actions sister Analise you say I want to
[47:51] be baptized today and I want to make a
[47:56] public Det ation and
[47:58] confession by everybody if it could be
[48:02] possible to come and witness My
[48:04] Confession you know you're acting you're
[48:07] getting baptized right so there's many
[48:10] ways in which confession can be
[48:11] expressed by faith believing that you
[48:14] will receive what you are asking
[48:16] for what I mean by this is that we don't
[48:18] just confess here
[48:22] Loosely what we confess we are very much
[48:25] aware and are alert of what we are
[48:27] talking about because it is God's word
[48:30] we believe
[48:33] it you
[48:35] know
[48:37] um my wife always tells me of because
[48:39] she's the baby at home she her sister
[48:42] will maybe do something and she'll rush
[48:44] to Mommy to report and Mommy will say oh
[48:47] I'm going to I'm going to EIT
[48:50] her you know that
[48:52] confession excuse me
[48:58] to show that that confession is not
[48:59] actually a real one when she goes back
[49:02] to to the sister of the brother saying
[49:05] mommy said she's going to hit you you
[49:07] know what the brother says says okay
[49:09] she'll always tell tell you
[49:11] that the brother already knew that
[49:14] momy's
[49:16] confession doesn't it's from
[49:20] here if mommy wanted to to eat him or
[49:23] her she will come with a stick and show
[49:25] what did he do come come here come here
[49:27] and give him a back slab immediately or
[49:29] there and there because he meant the
[49:31] confession
[49:33] right our confession should really be
[49:37] coming from here when you say
[49:41] amen
[49:43] amen and I'm not discouraging you from
[49:46] saying amen I'm actually encouraging you
[49:48] because if you confess as a son and a
[49:51] daughter of God that comes to pass and
[49:54] if you don't confess it how can can it
[49:56] come to
[49:58] pass how can it come to pass if you
[50:01] don't confess it Aiden how can it it
[50:03] can't my boy you need to confess it and
[50:06] say this year sorry my brother I'm
[50:09] getting A+ because I told him that I
[50:11] want A+ I'm getting A+ and I will get it
[50:14] in the name of the Lord because the Lord
[50:15] said whatever I ask I do my part the
[50:19] rest is history so you do your part and
[50:23] keep on confessing Keep On Believing
[50:25] remember the man who eyes got open when
[50:28] he
[50:29] confessed when he said praise God I can
[50:32] see did he see according to this
[50:35] flesh did he see in the spiritual
[50:38] realm did he see yes in the spiritual
[50:42] realm that man already was seeing he was
[50:45] already that is why when he said praise
[50:48] the brother says continue you are healed
[50:52] when did Brother bham see that how did
[50:54] he see
[50:55] that spiritually that man was no more
[50:58] blind it's only that the flesh was still
[51:01] stuck and the flesh the the more the
[51:04] more he confessed it it it took a moment
[51:08] when the bab was cutting his hair that
[51:09] his ey the flesh could not could not
[51:12] hold it any
[51:14] longer because he operated from a
[51:16] different
[51:18] realm he confessed it you and me must
[51:22] confess it regardless sister J am I
[51:25] right we need to confess it boys I want
[51:28] to encourage you tonight that whatever
[51:30] God has promised you despite all
[51:33] problems AB despite all the challenges
[51:36] at your level my friend you keep on
[51:39] confessing it I've got ministers
[51:42] here I'm under expectation that's why I
[51:45] call their names I've got ministers and
[51:47] I'm under real expectation I don't I'm
[51:49] not meing my weight if the L tell
[51:53] is amen so so
[51:57] the list that I wrote here is not
[51:59] exhaustive confession in my actions my
[52:03] thoughts my thoughts yeah your thoughts
[52:07] because he
[52:09] said he said was it to brother bam that
[52:13] tell them that even their thoughts in
[52:16] heaven they speak louder than their
[52:20] words our thoughts my thoughts that is
[52:24] why God's thoughts are so powerful
[52:27] your thoughts are so powerful until
[52:30] nobody says take volume up in heaven the
[52:32] Lord can hear them very clear and my
[52:34] thoughts too they speak and they confess
[52:38] something so let us confess the real
[52:41] word of God and believe it amen let's
[52:44] just hear what the man of God says here
[52:46] then then we will
[52:48] close who is God in 1950 August the 15th
[52:53] and when the inspiration of the holy
[52:54] spirit is here to inspire you
[52:57] remember God will make your body to come
[52:59] into your confession your
[53:02] body your body will obey
[53:04] your
[53:06] confession your body will be
[53:11] compelled to change and agree to your
[53:13] confession that's
[53:15] right if you say you are a
[53:19] drunker you want to drink don't worry
[53:22] you'll soon be
[53:24] one if you say you are a Sinner and you
[53:27] want to
[53:29] sin you'll be you'll be right into it
[53:32] there's so much power in My Confession
[53:35] in your confession and the things that I
[53:38] confess if you say you are a Christian
[53:41] believe it all along God will
[53:44] bring your testimony will bring you
[53:47] right into
[53:50] it this is just to give you an idea of
[53:54] how and what things we can confess in
[53:57] our
[53:58] lives take take what the prophet says
[54:01] there and apply it to your life and to
[54:03] your needs to your desires there is
[54:06] nothing impossible for a daughter of God
[54:09] let not the devil intimidate or threaten
[54:12] you or anything keep confessing he will
[54:15] he will make it happen the Lord so my
[54:18] confession your confession very
[54:20] powerful let's just take a few examples
[54:23] in the Bible and then we we close let's
[54:26] take the first one I I I actually wrote
[54:28] here uh I wrote actually quite a few
[54:32] things
[54:33] faith and then I
[54:36] wrote uh
[54:39] confession then I wrote action then I
[54:43] wrote test you see where I'm going then
[54:47] I wrote patience those are the things
[54:49] that goes along with your confession
[54:52] right so I wrote them and then we will
[54:54] look at them and then we pray the
[54:56] purpose of me bringing this someone like
[54:59] this is really just to encourage you
[55:01] brothers and sisters to motivate you
[55:03] because you are not just human beings if
[55:07] you ever thought that are yes you are
[55:09] nothing when we say you are nothing you
[55:12] are nobody we mean you in this
[55:15] form but actually within your body your
[55:20] real you runs the blood of the Royal
[55:24] Family
[55:26] you have to believe it don't believe a
[55:29] lie of the devil saying oh who am
[55:32] I yes you're not you're nobody in this
[55:35] flesh in this physical form and the way
[55:37] you came and everything else you are
[55:39] nothing but because you've got a God in
[55:42] you who is a creator of the heavens and
[55:44] the Earth you can say I'm I'm something
[55:47] by his
[55:49] grace I'm a son and a daughter of God
[55:52] and not allow the devil to give you
[55:54] irrelevant things and you go along with
[55:57] it do you know how dangerous is a
[55:58] thought a thought is a very dangerous
[56:00] thing because sometimes a thought comes
[56:02] even so say so slick so subtle than even
[56:07] the way water or light can come through
[56:10] you know light is one of the finest
[56:11] thing that can go through here so many
[56:14] you know light can go um and air and
[56:17] water they you just not cannot control
[56:20] them easily and oil maybe liquids but a
[56:24] thought a thought
[56:27] that is why we are going to
[56:30] travel faster than the speed of a
[56:34] thought when we go home the real you not
[56:39] faster than light light is too slow
[56:42] light will be too slow for us actually
[56:44] already human beings have already trying
[56:47] to to go you know they've passed the
[56:49] speed of sound already sound you know
[56:51] when I say arand can can you just see
[56:55] how quickly it gets there does not take
[56:57] a millisecond what about
[57:00] light what about you know air
[57:05] so the speed of a thought is so is so
[57:08] fast there's a a quotation they say how
[57:11] many thoughts you you think in a day is
[57:16] scary so let's just look at this few
[57:19] five Concepts and then we go let's look
[57:22] at a man called
[57:24] Abraham when we confess our sins well
[57:27] sorry when not our sins when we confess
[57:29] our confession don't just take it
[57:31] negatively when you make a confession in
[57:34] your mind in your heart whichever way
[57:36] you make it for anything that I've
[57:37] already alluded to and many more when
[57:40] you make it
[57:44] believe our example here is Father
[57:47] Abraham this one is an AI generated
[57:51] Abraham confession without faith in what
[57:55] you are confessing is meaningless is
[57:59] baseless and is is is
[58:03] useless you have to believe apply faith
[58:06] in your
[58:07] confession believe it don't don't don't
[58:10] worry about left or the right just
[58:13] believe it right let's look at what
[58:16] Abraham did the Bible says in Romans
[58:21] 4 from verse 20 he St not you know what
[58:26] is to
[58:27] stagger he didn't W he didn't he was not
[58:31] wavering wavering around is that the
[58:33] right
[58:34] word to staggering and changing
[58:38] directions and and and and doubtful and
[58:41] not sure he didn't
[58:44] stugger he staggered not at the promise
[58:47] of God through unbelief he never doubt
[58:50] it he
[58:52] believed but was strong in faith giving
[58:55] glor glory to God and being fully
[59:00] persuaded that what he had promised he
[59:03] was able also to
[59:05] perform that is why me I think we are
[59:09] challenged as Christians as a Church of
[59:11] the Living God to believe we should
[59:14] actually be concerned if things don't
[59:17] happen to us what we ask for when we ask
[59:22] God and and things don't
[59:25] happen then we should go back to our
[59:27] knees and we should fast and we should
[59:30] pray and we should
[59:32] collectively because there is a
[59:33] testimony of a also a collective
[59:36] confession when they say when when where
[59:38] there's a will there's a way but where
[59:41] there's a will of many people can you
[59:44] imagine what happened when everyone
[59:46] brings their leak of fire into this
[59:48] specific need and we say today brother
[59:51] we are going to to pray for you we are
[59:53] going to deny oursel a meal and pray for
[59:56] this situation and agree that thing
[59:59] moves
[1:00:00] God that thing makes God to move and
[1:00:04] respect our confession and our faith
[1:00:07] because it is according to his
[1:00:09] word so there is power in Faith Like Our
[1:00:13] Father Abraham did he did not just tell
[1:00:16] the people that I'm going to have a
[1:00:18] child no no he meant it he believed it
[1:00:21] this confession of just saying it
[1:00:24] Loosely because I want to please my
[1:00:26] friends or I want to I'm just saying it
[1:00:28] from shallow mindedness it's not going
[1:00:31] to work it's either you believe what you
[1:00:34] are saying or you don't don't waste time
[1:00:37] by saying things and you don't believe
[1:00:39] them believe them be a daughter and the
[1:00:42] Son of God and have faith in what you
[1:00:44] are
[1:00:45] saying I don't know how else I can
[1:00:47] emphasize
[1:00:48] it Hallelujah another example that I
[1:00:52] said here is about a confession I
[1:00:53] brought little pictures
[1:00:56] so that the little ones cannot sleep can
[1:00:58] can can can pay attention and so that
[1:01:01] they can be able to say amen and once
[1:01:04] you say amen mean it because you are
[1:01:08] going to be that
[1:01:09] amen you will be that amen if if the
[1:01:12] Bible says you're going to be healed and
[1:01:14] you're going to be delivered and you say
[1:01:16] Amen you will be just believe it you
[1:01:19] will receive the Holy Ghost don't care
[1:01:22] what the enemy says I don't care what
[1:01:23] the enemy is showing you what he is
[1:01:26] preaching don't actually resist
[1:01:28] listening to
[1:01:31] him let's hear the the three Hebrew boys
[1:01:33] you know what I'm trying to say with
[1:01:34] these Concepts should I call them
[1:01:36] Concepts is that confession
[1:01:41] alone you know there's things that it
[1:01:43] goes along with and the list could be
[1:01:45] very long there's things you have to
[1:01:47] believe your
[1:01:49] confession the three Hebrew boys made a
[1:01:52] statement they
[1:01:54] said Shadrach Mish this is now from The
[1:01:57] Book of Daniel 3:16 to18 Shadrach mishak
[1:02:00] and abeto answered and said to the king
[1:02:02] oh Nebuchadnezzar we are not careful to
[1:02:05] answer thee in this
[1:02:07] matter it is if it is if it be so our
[1:02:12] God whom we serve is able to Deliver Us
[1:02:15] from from the burning fairy finess and
[1:02:18] he will deliver us out of thine hand oh
[1:02:22] King ah this is treason
[1:02:27] in other languages they say this is
[1:02:29] trison this guy is the king the king did
[1:02:33] not know what amount of
[1:02:35] frustration must he
[1:02:40] choose you're you're saying oh King you
[1:02:42] are praising me oh King but you say you
[1:02:44] can't obey me can you imagine the
[1:02:47] superpower of that day how
[1:02:49] Nebuchadnezzar would have
[1:02:54] failed but if not if God cannot deliver
[1:02:59] if not be it known unto thee Oh King
[1:03:02] that he will we will not serve thy
[1:03:06] Gods I want the young men of this church
[1:03:08] to speak like
[1:03:15] this to say no
[1:03:19] Nebuchadnezzar Let Me Be A mishak and A
[1:03:21] Shadrach and Abed I want the fathers and
[1:03:24] the mothers of this church to talk like
[1:03:26] that then you you check
[1:03:30] us our our our inspiration will will
[1:03:34] bless far and
[1:03:37] wide I I've got no doubt without what
[1:03:40] I'm saying that that can be the that can
[1:03:42] be the beginning of the end of this
[1:03:44] world of our Rapture to to come and
[1:03:50] go so young man said no
[1:03:56] you see the reason I'm addressing the
[1:03:58] young men and young women is that you
[1:04:02] don't realize that the enemy is
[1:04:03] attacking you you actually help the
[1:04:06] enemy to attack your your own self by
[1:04:09] confessing wrong
[1:04:10] things young people be careful I'm
[1:04:12] saying this because I was a young person
[1:04:14] I if I could sit down with you I'll tell
[1:04:16] you the mistakes that I did horrible and
[1:04:18] bad
[1:04:19] ones but I'm standing here right now as
[1:04:21] if I know
[1:04:23] anything and The Time Has Changed ched
[1:04:25] and evolved from the time I was a young
[1:04:27] man until now but all these men here
[1:04:30] sitting here and women they've passed
[1:04:31] your stage don't think you're at Labor
[1:04:34] my boy my girl I'm just giving you a
[1:04:37] warning with love you see I'm
[1:04:39] smiling because the devil is sh what Mom
[1:04:43] and Dad are
[1:04:45] saying help them to help
[1:04:49] yourself they've walked that road
[1:04:51] before I was so blessed on Sunday by the
[1:04:54] the service brother Colin when he was
[1:04:56] doing Sunday school he he he just blew
[1:05:00] me
[1:05:01] away because his testimony about his
[1:05:04] life and how he walked was just so
[1:05:08] wonderful I think I'm going to suggest
[1:05:10] brother Ben to ask you one time to come
[1:05:12] give us a
[1:05:16] testimony now let's quickly look to the
[1:05:20] issue of action you see you believe your
[1:05:23] confession by faith
[1:05:26] and you say it and then after that you
[1:05:30] act you
[1:05:34] act there was a man called
[1:05:38] Nehemiah Nehemiah
[1:05:42] was in slavery or in
[1:05:45] captivity and it came to pass that
[1:05:48] nemiah appeared before the king one day
[1:05:51] and the King asked him hey neiah why do
[1:05:53] you look so sad why is your countenance
[1:05:55] like
[1:05:57] that and nemiah explained to the king
[1:06:00] why go read the book of nemiah it's a
[1:06:02] powerful book it said they they read the
[1:06:05] the Scrolls from the morning until the
[1:06:07] evening they were reading crying praying
[1:06:11] and
[1:06:14] fasted and
[1:06:17] then where am
[1:06:19] I nemiah so Nehemiah came to a point
[1:06:24] where the king allowed and gave him all
[1:06:26] the material to go and rebuild the city
[1:06:30] so what I'm trying to bring to you here
[1:06:32] is about the rebuilding of the city what
[1:06:34] happened when they were rebuilding the
[1:06:36] city
[1:06:37] walls it was fight men as brother Isaac
[1:06:41] says you fight on the one hand and then
[1:06:44] on the one hand you are laying the
[1:06:48] brick you building the city this city of
[1:06:51] yourself so that the Lord can come and
[1:06:54] dwell in your life
[1:06:57] want to
[1:06:59] be over
[1:07:01] time so neiah acted nemiah did not just
[1:07:05] tell the king oh King we are here in
[1:07:08] slavery we were just wishing and praying
[1:07:10] King since we are here in the slavery
[1:07:13] land we we are your we are your servants
[1:07:16] we are your your subjects just give us
[1:07:18] good food and yeah we'll see how it goes
[1:07:23] can you see he's talking like he was he
[1:07:25] just one sympathy oh king king of King
[1:07:28] ah we can even worship your Gods we yeah
[1:07:31] Israel is doomed is
[1:07:32] dead can you see it's
[1:07:35] hopeless but nemiah said no okay my face
[1:07:37] is not just my countenance is not just
[1:07:39] down like that talk like a daughter of
[1:07:41] God and a son of God talk like you serve
[1:07:44] a God say yes I'm set I am set King but
[1:07:49] this is the reason I want unlimited
[1:07:53] permission of material and the us as we
[1:07:56] pass through the
[1:07:57] land to go and rebuild the city of God
[1:08:01] it was a big speech it was a powerful
[1:08:03] speech and the King did
[1:08:07] it and then Nehemiah they you know the
[1:08:11] story they build a city those were
[1:08:13] during the time of the great zerubabel I
[1:08:16] like talking about zerubabel they built
[1:08:18] a city and it was not easy but that
[1:08:21] followed their
[1:08:23] confession they confessed they believed
[1:08:27] then they're now acting and when they
[1:08:29] building the city there were there were
[1:08:31] enemies man who had that they were
[1:08:33] building a city and they came and
[1:08:35] attacked them but these guys it's just
[1:08:38] it's only that AI does not make it right
[1:08:40] I wanted a picture where they've got a
[1:08:43] Sal and they've got if someone can make
[1:08:45] it for me that would be nice you know to
[1:08:47] show that confession doesn't end up okay
[1:08:50] no there are times when you act for your
[1:08:53] confession all the time you act
[1:08:56] you live as if you have already received
[1:08:59] it h there is a sister who went to the
[1:09:03] supermarket she didn't have no scent and
[1:09:06] she went to the supermarket and she took
[1:09:07] a a big
[1:09:09] trolley and the children were hungry and
[1:09:11] starving and she pushed
[1:09:13] it she was collecting groceries she's
[1:09:16] got no she had no money
[1:09:19] nothing what is she doing she's acting
[1:09:22] upon her confession
[1:09:25] I can't remember the story very well but
[1:09:27] somebody at the te just was led by the
[1:09:31] Lord to say hey ma'am I I I just feel
[1:09:34] like paying for your for your
[1:09:35] groceries it was
[1:09:38] full if you knew the situation of that
[1:09:41] sister you were going to say
[1:09:45] shame you know as they say oh shame
[1:09:50] sister just leave this to please and
[1:09:52] just come to my house we'll give you
[1:09:54] some bread that we left yesterday we've
[1:09:56] got leftovers for you we'll see
[1:09:59] tomorrow come to our house because you
[1:10:03] don't know you don't believe in her
[1:10:06] confession you didn't confess her
[1:10:08] confession so you are coming across like
[1:10:11] the enemy but when the sister is acting
[1:10:13] there's a
[1:10:15] sister who said Lord there is
[1:10:20] drought I would like to have rain in my
[1:10:24] field there in Zimbabwe there's a sister
[1:10:26] who did that and it rained and it the
[1:10:29] rain fell on her her fi
[1:10:32] only can you believe that can happen the
[1:10:35] Lord is able to do those things the Lord
[1:10:39] today is able to do those things because
[1:10:43] he listened to your confession as a son
[1:10:45] as his son and his daughter and the Lord
[1:10:47] wants you to believe if you believe and
[1:10:50] then you are ready to receive
[1:10:52] it like shra
[1:10:57] like
[1:11:00] nemiah now also your confession if you
[1:11:03] believe it you are acting it and doing
[1:11:05] everything prarion it will also be
[1:11:07] tested oh yes it must be tested because
[1:11:11] God does not want things that did not
[1:11:13] pass his quality assurance program God
[1:11:16] has got a quality
[1:11:18] assurance process that the Holy Ghost
[1:11:21] allows for it to
[1:11:23] come because you are a genuine seat of
[1:11:28] God and the words that you are saying
[1:11:29] are genuine by genuine Faith genuine
[1:11:32] confession therefore you'll be
[1:11:37] tested there in Africa we buy things
[1:11:40] from China and we call them fun Kongs I
[1:11:44] don't know if you have them
[1:11:46] here where something is this mic
[1:11:50] Fong what do we mean by that is that
[1:11:53] brother Ben is that it can't do the
[1:11:55] quality of that mic cannot be like the
[1:11:57] original brand quality of producing or
[1:12:01] taking sound it's a Fong so a child and
[1:12:05] a daughter of God you who are sitting
[1:12:07] here listening tonight what you say is
[1:12:09] not a fun Kong is real genuine don't
[1:12:13] disbelieve what you say don't disbelieve
[1:12:17] what you hear from the word of the Lord
[1:12:19] from the Bible don't disbelieve just
[1:12:22] take it and be like you are not normal
[1:12:24] and just apply it
[1:12:29] regardless now it must be
[1:12:31] tested my example here is the man called
[1:12:34] job you know the story of Job he was
[1:12:37] tested to the limits to the extreme
[1:12:41] limits until his own wife said no Daddy
[1:12:45] Daddy I think you got it wrong just you
[1:12:48] know what just you see you about to go
[1:12:52] just ciss God just kiss him and die
[1:12:57] once can you
[1:13:01] hear a spirit of giving up and
[1:13:05] just that's how she spoke and job
[1:13:08] answered her and said you know you're
[1:13:09] speaking like a foolish a
[1:13:12] fool talking to
[1:13:14] fools the way you are speaking how can
[1:13:18] you be happy when God
[1:13:20] gives and you want to be like a weather
[1:13:23] and change when God takes
[1:13:26] don't you know that everything comes
[1:13:27] from God don't you know that you have
[1:13:29] got the
[1:13:32] ability to create those things to speak
[1:13:36] them into
[1:13:38] existence so you know the story of Job
[1:13:41] he was tested to the
[1:13:44] limits and this test was approved in
[1:13:50] heaven I can't read there but if you
[1:13:52] want to please go and read job
[1:13:57] 23 cuz job made statements
[1:14:01] there to to Really
[1:14:05] validate that I'm passing these tests
[1:14:08] and I'm passing this test with an
[1:14:11] A+ and God was under
[1:14:15] obligation to bless him even more than
[1:14:18] how he was
[1:14:20] before that's what will happen to you
[1:14:23] and to me when we believe God even
[1:14:26] during the most horrendous
[1:14:32] tests it's not your time to give
[1:14:37] up and then you need also to be patient
[1:14:39] as
[1:14:42] well Isaiah 40 says they I didn't have a
[1:14:45] picture for this one but but they that
[1:14:48] wait upon the Lord shall renew their
[1:14:50] strength if you wait upon the Lord you
[1:14:53] will renew your strength
[1:14:55] because your strength is going to come
[1:14:57] when you receive when you get from the
[1:15:00] Lord and you start to see like job how
[1:15:03] do you think job I mean he was renewed
[1:15:05] that man when when when all the disease
[1:15:07] was gone and and children came back you
[1:15:11] know and all his riches came back
[1:15:15] double do you think job continued to be
[1:15:19] weak his strength got
[1:15:21] renewed they shall Mount up with wings
[1:15:24] as eagles they shall run and not be
[1:15:28] weary and they shall walk and not be
[1:15:31] tired to faint is to be tired to
[1:15:35] faint right so that's what happens when
[1:15:40] you are patient with what you
[1:15:43] believe knowing very well that there's
[1:15:45] many or clouds of Witnesses in the Bible
[1:15:49] for you and for me do you have you ever
[1:15:52] sat down and thought about why why what
[1:15:55] could be the reason why
[1:15:58] God H did not create you in the in the
[1:16:02] the Third Church age there in the
[1:16:04] 1800s or in
[1:16:08] 1720 have you ever thought about that
[1:16:10] why why did God make me to come and
[1:16:13] appear and live here now especially now
[1:16:15] in 2025
[1:16:17] why have you ever thought about it
[1:16:20] because God have got a bigger purpose
[1:16:23] and God's purpose does not fail
[1:16:25] what God Said God said you going to
[1:16:27] Rapture you will Rapture he will make
[1:16:30] you Rapture are you
[1:16:32] ready are you ready to participate in
[1:16:35] the Rapture and believe it and have the
[1:16:38] rapturing faith of going home are you
[1:16:40] ready for that young young guys are you
[1:16:42] ready to to to from from 15 huh from 20
[1:16:47] I mean from 15 from 16 from 123 Liam to
[1:16:51] become 21 are you ready my boy are you
[1:16:54] ready to change and be the same age as
[1:16:57] dead and run and not
[1:17:00] faint that's ultimately what we are here
[1:17:05] preparing
[1:17:07] for I can't
[1:17:09] wait to to see how how brother Kuban
[1:17:13] will be when he's 21 I can't wait and
[1:17:16] I'm sure he can't wait to see me you
[1:17:19] know maybe I'll be a little
[1:17:23] taller I'm happy with my my heart but
[1:17:26] what I mean is our bodies will be
[1:17:28] perfect I cannot wait to spend that time
[1:17:31] with
[1:17:33] you now boys don't be deceived my
[1:17:38] girls
[1:17:40] sister you are going to be the same age
[1:17:43] with your
[1:17:45] daddy
[1:17:50] Jimmy same age so in closing brothers
[1:17:54] and sisters I want to say to you having
[1:17:57] said all those things the ultimate
[1:17:59] reason the ultimate goal our ultimate
[1:18:02] end product huh is that we are going
[1:18:07] home and we are we are about to
[1:18:10] change is that is that your project goal
[1:18:14] is that what your goal
[1:18:16] is every day saying yes I'll go to this
[1:18:20] work yes I'll do this I'll do that I'll
[1:18:23] work it's all right but my ultimate goal
[1:18:26] I'm going
[1:18:28] home that's the ultimate we are going to
[1:18:31] change and we are actually in the
[1:18:33] process right now we are changing right
[1:18:36] now your body you're busy changing
[1:18:40] moving into your your body to go home
