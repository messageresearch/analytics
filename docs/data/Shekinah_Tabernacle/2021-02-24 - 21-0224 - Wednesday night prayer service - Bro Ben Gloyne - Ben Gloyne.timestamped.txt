[32:43] bush is not burnt and when the Lord saw

[33:49] night Grant it Lord we invite you here
[33:52] will you come For Your Glory we ask
[33:53] these things in Jesus Christ's name amen
[33:56] amen amen God bless you friends you may
[33:58] have your seats tonight I'd just like to
[34:00] take a uh bit of a short thought thought
[34:03] here about being called to be set a
[34:07] flame now a call there's a reason behind
[34:11] a call and a call is uh it actually
[34:15] draws you you're like if I was somewhere
[34:18] or just say you know someone calls your
[34:20] name you're actually if you respond to
[34:23] that call that their voice draws you to
[34:25] where they are and so there's actually a
[34:28] drawing power in a call it's a
[34:31] force and there's a
[34:34] reason why there is that pull and that
[34:37] pull is that God would call us to set us
[34:40] a flame you know we're not here to just
[34:43] go through the motions of church or a
[34:45] religion this is not religion this is
[34:47] not even nominal Christianity whatever
[34:50] you want to put put it in some kind of
[34:51] box it's not some kind of religion this
[34:53] is God calling but he wants to call us
[34:56] to set us a lame he wants us to be on
[35:00] fire not in our own human ability but
[35:02] it's his holy fire in us
[35:07] so it says in uh Matthew 2 here it says
[35:11] when he arose he took the young child
[35:13] this is Joseph after he had the dream uh
[35:15] where where uh the angel came to and
[35:17] said you can now return back to the
[35:19] promised land he was in Egypt uh and he
[35:21] took the young child and his mother by
[35:22] night and departed into Egypt and there
[35:25] and was there until the death of Herod
[35:26] that it might be fulfilled which is
[35:28] spoken of the Lord by the prophet saying
[35:30] out of Egypt have I called my son so
[35:33] there was a call you know Christianity
[35:36] real the message is not a push amen it's
[35:39] not a forcing it's not a driving it's a
[35:42] pull Amen brother BR spoke about three
[35:46] pulls each one had a pull the third one
[35:49] has a pull that'll pull a bride into the
[35:52] presence of Jesus Christ and that's when
[35:54] the word comes open there's a drawing
[35:56] Jesus even said of himself
[35:58] he says when I be lifted up I will draw
[36:01] all men unto me so there's a pull
[36:03] there's a there's actually a force I say
[36:05] if the word the word should be the thing
[36:07] that pulls us it shouldn't be just
[36:10] fellowship or a church or something you
[36:12] do on a Wednesday and a Sunday there
[36:13] should be a pull towards the Lord Jesus
[36:16] Christ now we know that scripture
[36:19] repeats itself there's actually cycle
[36:21] prophecies come around again and and and
[36:23] it has compound meaning even even this
[36:26] what we just read about out of Egypt I
[36:28] have called my son that was speaking in
[36:31] the Old Testament of Israel coming out
[36:33] of Egypt but then G uh God was calling
[36:36] his greatest son Jesus out of out of
[36:38] Egypt but there was a call there's a
[36:39] pull and a pull has a force and the word
[36:43] of God is actually the most powerful
[36:45] force upon the Earth yes sir remember
[36:47] his Hallelujah so brother Braham would
[36:50] say in Jesus Christ the same yesterday
[36:52] today and forever how many ministers
[36:54] here knows it history church history and
[36:56] prophecy repeats s at least once or
[36:58] twice true you believe look at Matthew 3
[37:01] out of Egypt I've called I called my son
[37:04] refer that back and see if it wasn't
[37:05] Jacob that was his son too see history
[37:08] repeats itself so we have been
[37:12] called for a
[37:14] reason Moses if you think about Moses
[37:17] now people in this day and age they took
[37:19] about they talk about how people are
[37:22] raised at a disadvantage based on
[37:24] socioeconomic conditions and there if
[37:26] they have two parents or one or your
[37:28] broken family not broken family how rich
[37:31] poor their family is and they talk about
[37:33] the hindrances that has at people
[37:35] obtaining what they could you at what
[37:37] they could become in life now you take
[37:40] Moses the world was at Moses's
[37:43] fingertips he wasn't raised in a slave's
[37:46] home as an Israelite in Egypt he wasn't
[37:48] at the bottom of the barrel or the
[37:51] bottom of the rung he was actually at in
[37:53] the top he was raised in Pharaoh's
[37:56] Palace so there was nothing that he
[37:59] could not get a hold of when he was in
[38:02] Egypt that's right so there's no
[38:03] hindrance there was nothing you know he
[38:05] was he was raised to be potentially the
[38:08] next Pharaoh in Egypt and he could have
[38:10] been that you know he was raised being
[38:13] being being raised in royalty he would
[38:15] he would have been one of the commanders
[38:17] of the army so he was raised in great
[38:18] military knowledge he had a great
[38:21] experience of you know learning all the
[38:22] wisdom of the Egyptians he had
[38:24] everything there was nothing that
[38:26] hindered you know nothing in in humanity
[38:30] you know it's not like he couldn't go to
[38:32] university cuz he couldn't afford it or
[38:34] he couldn't buy a car cuz he couldn't
[38:35] afford it he couldn't go on holiday cuz
[38:36] he couldn't afford it he could do
[38:38] anything he wanted he was raised in
[38:40] Pharaoh's
[38:41] Palace but there was one thing he
[38:44] lacked and that was the key ingredient
[38:47] of his life and brother Braham says he
[38:49] says go down to Egypt to take over going
[38:52] down to take over a oneman Invasion and
[38:55] the silly party did it why he had fa in
[38:57] the God that he had experienced with God
[39:00] who made the difference now in
[39:02] everyone's life it's God that makes the
[39:04] difference it's not our first birth that
[39:06] makes a difference it's knowing god that
[39:08] makes a difference he is greater than
[39:10] every hindrance or obstacle or hardship
[39:12] or trial God is far greater than all
[39:15] those things and he makes the difference
[39:18] amen he didn't need his military
[39:20] training he didn't need his scholarships
[39:22] he needed an experience and the burning
[39:25] bush had what Moses lacked now that word
[39:30] lacked means you basically don't have it
[39:33] if you lack something it's not in your
[39:34] possession it's not yours you're lacking
[39:36] it so everything he had actually it
[39:39] wasn't how he was raised that feet uh uh
[39:42] fit that thing he lacked it was the
[39:43] burning bush had what Moses lacked and
[39:47] it was the main thing now you think
[39:49] about Moses you think about the Egypt
[39:52] could not could not give him what he
[39:54] lacked that's right Pharaoh's Palace
[39:57] could not give him what he lacked all
[39:59] the tutors and the scholarship and the
[40:01] learning could not give what he lacked
[40:03] now this may seem Elementary but I want
[40:04] you to think about it because we can
[40:06] emphasize so much this natural life and
[40:09] sure we should have a career jobs we
[40:11] should plan whatever more buy houses
[40:13] whatever but what we have need of to
[40:16] overcome in this day and age is not in
[40:18] our first birth it's in the pillar of
[40:21] fire amen so now so so all of his
[40:25] scholarship still M left him lacking his
[40:28] position as a prince left him lacking
[40:31] his military training left him lacking
[40:34] and I'll even say his first birth as an
[40:37] Israelite still left him lacking it was
[40:41] the burning bush that was what he needed
[40:44] everything he had need of was in that
[40:45] Pillar of
[40:47] Fire Hallelujah so nothing and his
[40:51] Humanity could stop him getting what he
[40:53] wanted but the thing he needed was in
[40:54] the pillar of Fire
[40:58] the word produces its own life this is
[41:00] in Christ the MYRY God revealed if I
[41:01] just go a bit slow I'm just going to go
[41:03] a bit slow okay so you
[41:06] know the word produces its own life you
[41:09] know sometimes we think that that it has
[41:11] to be a dynamic shouting jumping time
[41:13] for it to be anointed Jesus sat down and
[41:15] taught the people I say that's the most
[41:17] anointed preaching that's ever struck
[41:19] the world the word produces its own life
[41:22] but we know is however God manifests
[41:24] himself praise the Lord now the word
[41:26] produces its own life that Eve swap for
[41:28] personal knowledge see how the church
[41:30] has today through some man's
[41:32] understanding he says Moses had a great
[41:35] understanding of God till he met the
[41:37] burning
[41:39] bush then he saw his failure the burning
[41:42] bush had what Moses lack so he had a
[41:44] great understanding of God and we can
[41:46] have a great understanding of God until
[41:49] we meet God that's right it's good to
[41:51] have an understanding but don't just
[41:53] stay at the understanding meet the god
[41:55] that gives the understanding am amen and
[41:58] then he saw his failure so you know if
[42:00] you really want to see the failure in
[42:01] your life that we have need of in your
[42:04] life get into the presence of God yeah
[42:07] amen because it's good because God
[42:08] doesn't reveal uh what we would call a
[42:11] flaw in our Humanity to just leave that
[42:13] in us and say look you've got a flaw now
[42:16] the reason he exposes something in our
[42:17] lives is we say Lord take this from me
[42:20] mold me and shape me and he'll say sure
[42:22] I'll be waiting for you to ask me the
[42:23] whole time Hallelujah are we not happy
[42:26] about that
[42:28] I thought we'd be real happy he we got
[42:30] the we know the one who can fix us
[42:32] hallelujah doesn't matter what the
[42:34] devil's tried to pour onto us through
[42:35] our upbringing or hardship pain Strife
[42:37] whatever it may be amen but there's
[42:39] something that we we have what we have
[42:42] need of to meet every
[42:45] challenge amen I'm so glad yes now all
[42:50] of now I listed a lot of things before
[42:52] and I'm and and and I'll just go through
[42:53] the list again Egypt couldn't couldn't
[42:56] meet that lack learning couldn't meet it
[42:58] his position as a prince couldn't meet
[42:59] it his military training couldn't meet
[43:01] it and even his first birth as as an
[43:04] Israelite couldn't feel that lack that
[43:06] the pillar of fire had and I may be a
[43:08] bit extreme saying this but all those
[43:10] things I'll say just caused him to
[43:12] backslide and be a runaway Prophet on
[43:15] the back side of the desert because he
[43:18] tried to do it in his own humanity and
[43:20] he miserably failed and there he was for
[43:23] 40 day uh 40 years on the back side of
[43:25] the desert and he basically Al he was
[43:27] ordained to be the deliver deliverer of
[43:30] Israel but he just
[43:33] somehow came to a place in his life said
[43:35] well I might as well forget about that
[43:37] I'm just going to sit here and heard my
[43:39] father-in-law's sheep we must never ever
[43:41] come to that kind of spot in life where
[43:42] we just kind of sit back and say well I
[43:45] guess the victory can never be mine I
[43:46] guess that promise can never be mine I
[43:48] guess I can never be what what God was
[43:51] made me to be we should never think like
[43:52] that you know you may see a lot of
[43:55] opposition in your life just like when
[43:56] the 10 spies 12 Spies rather went into
[43:59] went into the promised land and they
[44:01] said we see Giants Well Caleb just said
[44:03] I see bread Hallelujah he said they're
[44:05] bread to us that's what Caleb said about
[44:07] the cities and the Giants and their
[44:09] armies and their fortifications he says
[44:11] this is just going to be our daily diet
[44:14] bread Hallelujah so you may have a big
[44:16] obstacle a big challenge in your life
[44:18] just call it bread Hallelujah that's
[44:21] what Caleb that you that's the category
[44:22] he put that in so I think that's a good
[44:24] way to
[44:25] be amen
[44:27] man now here was but the thing is with
[44:30] with with with Moses is Moses in spite
[44:34] of all of his failure and is trying to
[44:36] fulfill the promise in his own ability
[44:39] he was living under a promise and God
[44:42] when he ordain something it's going to
[44:44] happen it doesn't matter what the devil
[44:47] tries to do it doesn't matter how much
[44:48] he tries to make it you know many people
[44:51] think it's impossible How could a bride
[44:53] the devil thinks ever come out of my
[44:55] Eden that I've built but God says I'll
[44:57] show you she's going to come and we're
[45:00] marching to Zion that beautiful city of
[45:02] God
[45:04] hallelujah I mean but there he was he
[45:06] was a runaway Prophet but he met God in
[45:11] that Pillar of Fire and he saw it and he
[45:14] said I'm going to turn aside and see why
[45:16] this thing's not burning up because
[45:17] remember fire is a consuming thing amen
[45:20] you give it Fuel and it just burns on
[45:24] hallelujah amen and so there he was and
[45:27] then but then it wasn't just the it
[45:29] wasn't that physical manifestation of
[45:31] the Flames that he needed he needed that
[45:33] voice to speak out to him and that's
[45:36] what we need with this message to hear
[45:37] the voice behind the voice I me to see
[45:40] it's not a Kian speaking 1100 odd
[45:43] sermons this is not just a different
[45:45] move of Christianity or something that
[45:47] people think is control or conservative
[45:49] or whatever it may be this is not that
[45:51] this is the call of God but he calls us
[45:54] that we'll be set a flame so there was
[45:57] there was Moses one moment a backslid
[45:59] and Prophet run away just hiding On The
[46:01] Backs side of the desert but he met the
[46:03] pillar of fire and that and the voice
[46:05] boot said I have come down I've heard
[46:07] the Cry of my people that's why it's
[46:09] good to cry to God that's why it's good
[46:11] you may feel frustrated anger at the
[46:13] Devil just call out to God with that
[46:15] frustration and anger hmon just you know
[46:17] hmon was exposed by the voice of Esther
[46:20] it wasn't the king working it out it
[46:22] wasn't the guards in the palace it was
[46:24] actually a voice of a woman saying this
[46:26] man this wicked man hmon is trying to
[46:28] kill me and all my people we need to
[46:30] open our mouth and say the devil's on my
[46:32] case he's trying to destroy me he's
[46:34] trying to destroy my family amen and the
[46:36] reason that we should do that is because
[46:38] God gets
[46:40] mad Hallelujah that wrath of God we we
[46:44] better turn that wrath against the devil
[46:46] it's a good place to turn it on
[46:49] hallelujah oh but that's judging the
[46:52] Bible says judge righteous judgment yes
[46:55] you know I wish I had a picture of it
[46:56] but there was a meme where where it had
[46:58] Matthew 7 just like in a as like a
[47:00] screenshot you know from a from a phone
[47:03] and then it's just got judge not and
[47:05] then all the rest of the verses just
[47:06] scribbled out and said that's modern day
[47:09] Christianity that's true don't judge
[47:11] that's what the devil says Don't Judge
[47:13] Me no he's judged Jesus says the prince
[47:15] of this you the prince of this world has
[47:17] been judged
[47:21] Hallelujah so we should turn the wrath
[47:24] of God against the devil
[47:27] amen you know Hallelujah the lord loves
[47:30] you and I amen thank you do you know
[47:33] that he loves you and I we're accepted
[47:35] in the Beloved the punishment we should
[47:38] have taken Jesus Took on Calvary for you
[47:41] and I he already took our judgment he
[47:43] already took our punishment hallelujah
[47:46] amen God is not mad at you and I we may
[47:49] disappoint him and but but he'll put us
[47:51] back on the road sure he might correct
[47:53] Us in some kind of way but it's for our
[47:55] good but he's not M he's not waiting to
[47:57] just push a button the trap door opens
[47:58] and you go to hell that's not what he's
[48:00] waiting that's not our God hallelujah
[48:03] but our God is full of Wrath but it's
[48:05] going to be sent against his enemies and
[48:08] the enemy of the Bride is the enemy of
[48:10] God so if the devil's your enemy he's
[48:13] God's enemy amen hallelujah brother
[48:16] Braham says and not quite does not quite
[48:18] verbatim but he says you know the devil
[48:20] better be careful if he comes against
[48:22] one of God's children CU he's got Jesus
[48:23] Christ on his hands Hallelujah
[48:27] amen amen so Moses Moses was ordained by
[48:31] prophecy to do a job we know that
[48:34] Abraham was was uh he was given a
[48:36] promise by God that that his seed was
[48:38] going to sojourn in a Strange Land 400
[48:41] years I know you know this very well but
[48:42] we just going to go through you know you
[48:44] know go through it one more time you
[48:46] know seed would so journ and a strange
[48:48] 400 years they're going to be afflicted
[48:49] but then I'll I'm going to bring them
[48:51] out with a mighty hand with great
[48:52] substance and so when God was speaking
[48:54] that to Abraham though Moses is was not
[48:57] mentioned to Abraham and God's mind
[48:59] Moses was part of that prophecy and so
[49:02] there was a call the reason that God
[49:04] spoke to him in that burning bush is
[49:06] because there's a call for him to
[49:08] fulfill the next part of the Scripture
[49:11] it wasn't just for him to have a
[49:13] religious experience but there's another
[49:14] part of the scripture to be fulfilled
[49:16] you know who knows who knows that some
[49:19] of this is
[49:20] history some of this is current and some
[49:23] of this is
[49:24] future right and the call call of God
[49:28] the call of God is not to make us
[49:30] historians the call of God is that we
[49:33] are ordained or we're called to fulfill
[49:35] the next part that is the great thing
[49:38] that you're called not to you know
[49:41] anyone in this day and age can say God
[49:43] sent a
[49:44] prophet even the even the Pentecostal
[49:47] charismatic realm that they they discuss
[49:50] brother bam seven major Visions on the
[49:51] internet they can see the first ones are
[49:54] fulfilled they're talking about what's
[49:55] just happened in America and the they're
[49:57] talking about the driverless cars so a
[49:59] lot of people more than what the critics
[50:02] like to think a lot of people know about
[50:03] this message and they discuss it and
[50:06] there and and a lot of them are looking
[50:08] the anointing that was on William
[50:09] brandham it's going to return again I
[50:12] say it already has am mean because that
[50:14] same anointing on him is on the bride
[50:16] Hallelujah just like the same anointing
[50:18] that was on Elijah fell upon Elisha yes
[50:21] sir
[50:22] Hallelujah that same Mighty Angel is now
[50:25] in a bride in a amen multi membered body
[50:29] amen so it's easy to gather around
[50:32] history but we're not here to gather
[50:34] around history we have been called if
[50:37] this is all you get out of this service
[50:39] you say what's the what's the will of
[50:40] God for my life you've been called to
[50:42] fulfill the next part of the
[50:45] word hallelujah Moses you think about
[50:48] the impossibility that Moses in his
[50:50] Humanity faced 8-year-old man no Army
[50:56] behind him one man Invasion that was his
[50:59] job imagine going through the Customs
[51:02] gate I've probably said this before as
[51:03] well purpose of visit fills out the form
[51:06] holiday can't tick that one business
[51:08] yeah I guess he could tick that one
[51:10] visiting relatives yes you know other
[51:13] Invasion or Deliverance or you and then
[51:16] the custom guy looks at that looks at
[51:17] his passport go stamps and pass it
[51:20] thinks what a crazy man do you have
[51:22] anything to
[51:24] declare I'll just call it a stick
[51:27] it was a rod of Deliverance he is
[51:29] packing God's Rod of Deliverance he
[51:31] couldn't wait is it a firearm no you
[51:33] didn't fit in that kind of you anyway
[51:35] but you know they probably thought maybe
[51:36] what a crazy man in this Humanity that
[51:38] was crazy one spear could have endered
[51:40] the whole thing one God could have taken
[51:43] his head off done done and dtin but
[51:45] because he was set a flame by the word
[51:48] that he was ordained to fulfill he was
[51:50] built for the job I mean he went down
[51:52] one man Invasion he fulfilled that word
[51:55] hallelujah
[51:57] amen he came down he said to Pharaoh let
[51:59] my people go and Pharaoh eventually had
[52:01] to let his people go you know he plagued
[52:03] Pharaoh's Kingdom until Pharaoh had to
[52:06] consent Hallelujah it should be the same
[52:08] thing with you and I we should plague
[52:10] the devil's Kingdom amen we should lift
[52:12] our loved ones in prayer Hallelujah we
[52:14] should torment the devil in that way
[52:16] then eventually the devil says well I
[52:17] just have to let them go brother Braham
[52:20] says I think in total Deliverance you
[52:22] can pray in such a way till the devil
[52:23] has to let them go Hallelujah
[52:27] because what was the first sign that
[52:28] Moses did he took this staff he threw it
[52:31] down in Pharaoh's presence we know Cobra
[52:33] represented Pharaoh was on his crown
[52:35] that he had you know and God was telling
[52:37] the devil and Pharaoh I can loose you
[52:39] and I can bind you cuz he loosed it
[52:41] turned into a snake picked it up it was
[52:43] a you you know a stick again and he was
[52:45] telling the devil I can loose you I can
[52:47] bind you I'm on a mission to F fulfill
[52:50] God's word so you better get out of my
[52:52] way and what power's being put in our
[52:54] lives right now and the power of our
[52:55] tongue not to carry a stick around but
[52:57] in the power of the spoken word that's
[52:59] in you and I right now we can bind the
[53:01] devil we can loose the devil we can bind
[53:03] them we can loose them he doesn't come
[53:05] and say can you bind me now you know how
[53:07] about I do this for you no no you can
[53:09] bind them you can loose them it's in the
[53:12] power of your voice
[53:15] Hallelujah so he took Israel out because
[53:19] he was sent a flame now Caleb and there
[53:23] was a lot of people that were called
[53:26] Caleb and Joshua were part of that group
[53:29] you know I've been thinking quite often
[53:31] people get caught up with what other
[53:33] people have
[53:34] done amen and Peter said to Jesus about
[53:38] you know cuz one of the disciples would
[53:40] not taste death till he sees the kingdom
[53:41] come and all these things or you know
[53:43] and then Jesus just said to Peter real
[53:46] simply what is it to you yeah follow me
[53:49] what is it to thee about all this stuff
[53:51] follow thou me and that's really like
[53:53] Caleb and Joshua they could say well
[53:54] what about all these other people that
[53:56] didn't go with what is it to them we're
[53:58] following the promise of the day
[54:00] hallelujah hallelujah the Bible would
[54:03] tell us that Jesus knew why he came to
[54:05] the Earth he says for this cause I've
[54:08] come into the world to be the Lamb of
[54:10] God that would take away the sin of the
[54:11] world now in Hebrews 10: 7 this is the
[54:14] NIV version he says then I said here I
[54:17] am it is written about me in the scroll
[54:20] I have come to do thy will uh your will
[54:23] my God pardon me and this in the King
[54:26] James then said I lo I come in the
[54:28] volume of the book that is written of me
[54:31] to do thy will oh God so so he's
[54:33] basically
[54:34] saying it's written about me in here and
[54:36] I've come to fulfill this this is
[54:38] basically the crack of what he said
[54:40] Moses if it was written down that time
[54:42] he could have opened the scroll and
[54:44] pointed to the deliverer going to take
[54:45] out the people out of Egypt and put them
[54:47] in the promis land says I've come to
[54:49] fulfill this this is talking about me
[54:51] and this is why I'm here and this is why
[54:54] this is why God called me is because I'm
[54:55] here to fill the next part hallelujah
[54:59] amen thank you know the scribes and
[55:01] Pharisees as I said before it's easy to
[55:04] gather around history the scribes and
[55:07] Pharisees were doing that who's read
[55:09] that in the New Testament he says we're
[55:11] Moses disciples and the reason they were
[55:14] Moses disciples is because of tradition
[55:17] it was tradition in the in the you know
[55:19] in Israel that Moses was the prophet
[55:21] that wrote the first five books of the
[55:22] Bible and they had the Psalms and the
[55:24] different prophets but they were the one
[55:26] that followed Moses Moses gave the law
[55:28] so by tradition they were Believers or
[55:30] disciples in Moses but it was not out of
[55:32] Revelation it was just out of tradition
[55:35] and Jesus would even say to themo not
[55:37] think that I accuse you to the father
[55:39] there is one that accuse you even Moses
[55:41] in whom ye trust for had you believed
[55:44] Moses you would have believed me for he
[55:46] wrote Of Me amen but if you believe not
[55:49] his writings how shall ye believe my
[55:52] words see they were gathered around God
[55:55] sent a prophet
[55:56] and they were caught up in Moses the man
[55:59] but they didn't pay heed to what Moses
[56:01] actually taught because if they paid
[56:03] heed to what Moses taught they would
[56:05] have believed
[56:07] Jesus and then it's a and then I can say
[56:10] that it's because they because if you
[56:12] look at the Pharisees they added
[56:14] hundreds of man-made laws and Creeds and
[56:16] dogmas to the law of what he said if
[56:20] they really believed Moses they wouldn't
[56:21] have been adding stuff but they added
[56:23] stuff and they Justified their walk with
[56:26] God by what they
[56:27] added you know it was a strange thing
[56:30] for the Apostle Paul to go by scripture
[56:32] alone in his day it was a strange thing
[56:35] because they had all their midrash and
[56:37] all their Creeds and dogmas what the
[56:39] rabbis taught and all these things and
[56:41] you know but if they really believe
[56:42] Moses they would never have added those
[56:44] things and it's the same thing it's
[56:48] easy to say and believe yes God sent a
[56:51] prophet in this day you even look at the
[56:54] World War II post postor War to Healing
[56:56] Revival that the ministry of brother
[56:58] Bram initiated it's all there church
[57:01] historians say that his ministry was the
[57:03] spare
[57:05] head it's
[57:07] easy to to to say as a historical fact
[57:11] that is true and I'm not trying to do
[57:13] away with that no not at all but what
[57:16] can be done is it just is reduced down
[57:19] to
[57:20] information or that sermon he preached
[57:23] information or this series he preached
[57:25] information it's not information it's
[57:27] Jesus Christ revealing himself and he's
[57:30] called the people to a word to set them
[57:32] a flame because you know our God is a
[57:35] consuming fire yes sir so he is here to
[57:38] consume certain parts of ourselves that
[57:41] need consuming amen hallelujah for us to
[57:45] fulfill the next part of the part of the
[57:47] prophecy now we you know if we just look
[57:50] through the scripture on Mount Carmel
[57:52] God was a consuming fire
[57:56] Elijah would make the
[57:58] challenge he said you call on your God's
[58:00] prophets of Baal I'm just I'm just this
[58:02] not verbatim but I'm just ad liing but
[58:04] we all know the stories really
[58:06] well yes amen I trust for all Bible
[58:09] readers he said you call on the name of
[58:11] your gods and I will call on the name of
[58:13] the Lord and the god that anth by fire
[58:15] let him be God so the true God that
[58:18] answers by fire he's the real one see it
[58:20] goes beyond argument it goes beyond
[58:22] discussion and facts and figures and
[58:24] history and this and this and this no
[58:26] it's got to be the god that answers by
[58:28] fire that one's the real one amen
[58:31] hallelujah well what kind of fire does
[58:33] he does he answer by Holy Ghost Fire
[58:36] amen he says and the god that anth by
[58:39] fire let him be God and all the people
[58:41] answered and said it is well spoken
[58:43] jumping down to verse uh 30 of of First
[58:46] Kings 18 and Elijah said unto all the
[58:48] people come near unto me and all the
[58:50] people came near unto him and he
[58:52] repaired the altar of the Lord that was
[58:53] broken down why cuz the approach we know
[58:56] an altar is a is an approach to God so
[58:59] that approach to God had fallen into
[59:01] disrepair they had tried to do a
[59:03] man-made way and if you go look at that
[59:05] story there's the priest of Baal they're
[59:07] dancing they're jumping they're shouting
[59:09] and even they try and get in the flesh a
[59:11] little bit more they cut themselves and
[59:12] no doubt sincere people no doubt
[59:14] believing because Baal was the god of
[59:16] fire they believe so no doubt they
[59:18] believe sure he's going to answer by
[59:19] fire otherwise they wouldn't have done
[59:21] it and they put all their heart and
[59:23] their energy into it but not a single
[59:25] not single
[59:28] spark and so he and and so Elijah
[59:31] repaired the altar of the Lord that was
[59:33] broken down then the fire and and then
[59:35] then after he had built it and he put
[59:37] the sacrifice on and the wood and the
[59:39] water and all those things he prayed
[59:41] says Lord I've done all this according
[59:43] to your word may all the people know
[59:44] that thou art God and thou has turned
[59:46] their heart back again and then the fire
[59:48] of the Lord fell and consumed the sacri
[59:51] burnt sacrifice and the wood and the
[59:53] stones and the dust and licked up the
[59:55] water that that was in the trench and
[59:56] the people said Jehovah the Lord he is
[59:59] God Amen cuz the fire just didn't come
[1:00:02] down and have a nice Bri you know just
[1:00:04] didn't do a light searing and make a
[1:00:05] medium rare kind of offering it burnt up
[1:00:07] the offering and the wood and the stones
[1:00:10] and licked up all the all the water and
[1:00:12] just consumed the whole thing Hallelujah
[1:00:15] and that's the same thing with you and I
[1:00:17] now you say well what kind of altar do
[1:00:20] we fall
[1:00:21] upon God gives us Revelations they
[1:00:24] stones
[1:00:26] and the reason he gives us re
[1:00:27] revelations in his word is not that we
[1:00:29] would oh I know this and I know that and
[1:00:31] I know how this goes together this no no
[1:00:33] that's not the reason the reason he
[1:00:35] reveals himself in his word is that you
[1:00:37] lay yourself upon that Revelation and
[1:00:40] the fire of God Burns you
[1:00:43] up amen I trust that's not forign to you
[1:00:45] and I this is not a lecture theater I've
[1:00:49] never seen I've never seen a lecture
[1:00:51] dance around like sometimes we do up
[1:00:53] here I've sat in maybe too many lectures
[1:00:55] in my lifetime at University but I've
[1:00:56] never seen anyone do
[1:00:58] this right this is not a lecture
[1:01:01] theater amen a revelation is a
[1:01:04] stone you got to put those Revelations
[1:01:07] together then present yourself as a
[1:01:09] Living Sacrifice on top of it you say
[1:01:12] well how does that work well repentance
[1:01:14] is a
[1:01:15] revelation repentance is not because you
[1:01:18] get caught I'm sorry I didn't mean to do
[1:01:21] that actually you did cuz you did it you
[1:01:23] know so repenting is not because you get
[1:01:25] busted
[1:01:26] that's just cuz you get
[1:01:27] busted right that's not real repentance
[1:01:30] real repentance is when the Lord moves
[1:01:31] on your heart it's it's the goodness of
[1:01:33] God that leads you to repentance and
[1:01:35] it's that repentance is actually you
[1:01:37] actually have a Godly sorrow you're
[1:01:39] genuinely upset Lord take this Faller
[1:01:42] nature that I have that's caused me to
[1:01:44] do these things and turn it to you know
[1:01:46] that's no longer that way and that all
[1:01:48] it wants is to serve you actually turn
[1:01:50] from your sin and walk the other way
[1:01:52] that's that's a
[1:01:53] revelation even even though brother R
[1:01:56] says you don't need a revelation to be
[1:01:58] baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:02:00] Christ I'll say to really be be be be
[1:02:03] buried in his name and come forth in
[1:02:05] uness of not life that actually needs a
[1:02:06] revelation but to go through the ACT you
[1:02:09] don't need the Revelation do you
[1:02:10] understand because if you really have
[1:02:11] that Revelation I got to be buried in
[1:02:13] his name Hallelujah buried with him and
[1:02:16] baptism I come forth a newness of Life
[1:02:19] all those things are done that will fall
[1:02:22] on the Altar and be burnt up
[1:02:27] Hallelujah Jus you know we're here to be
[1:02:31] living
[1:02:33] sacrifices and all that's to be done and
[1:02:36] and and if you really look at the word
[1:02:39] the word is not disconnected things it's
[1:02:41] all Jesus Christ you know before you
[1:02:43] meet the Lord some people they say well
[1:02:45] here's the Thunders and here's the seals
[1:02:48] and here's the godhead and here's the
[1:02:50] church ages and this is how I should
[1:02:52] conduct myself it's all it's all
[1:02:53] unrelated things but when but when you
[1:02:55] meet the Lord you just see one person
[1:02:58] you see the Lord Jesus Christ and
[1:03:00] everything
[1:03:01] hallelujah
[1:03:04] hallelujah amen if he ever
[1:03:07] was if he ever was a consuming fire he
[1:03:10] still is a consuming fire right and he's
[1:03:13] here to consume up our first nature that
[1:03:15] we were born with he's here to burn it
[1:03:17] up amen so he's here to burn out all our
[1:03:21] sin to burn out all our indifference yes
[1:03:25] sir to burn burn out all our backbiting
[1:03:27] to burn out just using church as some
[1:03:29] background music
[1:03:31] somewhere to burn out our fussing to
[1:03:34] burn out all our P parties to burn out
[1:03:36] all of our pride to burn out all of our
[1:03:38] depression to burn out all of our
[1:03:40] unbelief to burn out our old nature to
[1:03:42] burn out our unforgiveness to burn out
[1:03:44] our stubborn nature to burn out our own
[1:03:47] will that we're born with to burn out
[1:03:48] all of our prejudice to burn out all of
[1:03:50] our Superstition to burn out all of our
[1:03:52] malice to burn out all of our Strife all
[1:03:54] of our fear all of our trouble in the
[1:03:57] home to burn it all out that's why he's
[1:03:58] here I just made a list he's here to
[1:03:59] burn out a lot of things that's what but
[1:04:02] you've got to put the fuel in the fire
[1:04:04] for it to burn right so if you don't put
[1:04:07] that in the fire well how do I put those
[1:04:08] things in the fire you say you going to
[1:04:10] be willing Lord burn it out of me am I
[1:04:12] don't want this thinging anymore you
[1:04:13] know the devil loves to make us think we
[1:04:15] own things you
[1:04:18] know spirits and things come along and
[1:04:20] and and they make us think a certain way
[1:04:23] but it never tells you this is how I
[1:04:25] think thinking I'm a spirit and here I'm
[1:04:26] just going to put these thoughts in your
[1:04:28] mind and this is how this is just my
[1:04:30] thoughts and not your thoughts no he
[1:04:31] comes along and makes you think this is
[1:04:33] how you should think he said to burn
[1:04:35] that out God's had to burn that out our
[1:04:38] God is a consuming fire Isaiah needed a
[1:04:40] cleansing one day after he saw the
[1:04:43] failure of the king king Uzziah was an
[1:04:47] incredible King but he got his heart got
[1:04:49] lifted up and pride because God blessed
[1:04:51] him to such a degree he thought he could
[1:04:52] do anything and never have any trouble
[1:04:55] and so decided I'm going to be a priest
[1:04:57] so he went into the temple who knows the
[1:04:59] story who reads the Bible right
[1:05:01] Hallelujah you know he takes the sensor
[1:05:04] and he goes to try and be a priest and
[1:05:05] the priests come in behind him say King
[1:05:07] you're not this is not your office
[1:05:08] you're a great king but you're never
[1:05:10] meant to be a priest and and he just
[1:05:12] thought I'm going to do it anyway and so
[1:05:13] he goes in goes to offer the incense
[1:05:15] whatever he was doing and he was struck
[1:05:17] with Leprosy and he had to run out and
[1:05:19] he was and he and he died a leper that's
[1:05:21] why we've got to stay in our calling but
[1:05:23] you see this this shook the prophet
[1:05:26] Isaiah because he leaned on the arm of
[1:05:29] that King and so he went into the temple
[1:05:32] now this is always the best place when
[1:05:35] things go
[1:05:36] wrong the best place to go is into the
[1:05:40] presence of God when things go wrong
[1:05:43] he's my source of strength he should be
[1:05:45] our source of strength amen YouTube not
[1:05:47] so much amen you know the news not so
[1:05:49] much what the neighbor says not so much
[1:05:51] you know my source of strength My Help
[1:05:53] Cometh From The Lord amen right
[1:05:57] Hallelujah and then he saw he saw a
[1:05:59] visit you know he had a visitation of
[1:06:01] God himself he saw the Lord high and
[1:06:02] lifted up in the temple now this is just
[1:06:05] my little mind but I think you know I
[1:06:07] don't believe he was the only one in the
[1:06:08] place that Temple was a busy lot of
[1:06:11] things were going on a lot of sacrifices
[1:06:13] priests doing their jobs worshippers
[1:06:15] coming along you know so Isaiah wasn't
[1:06:17] the only one there but he had a
[1:06:19] visitation from God hallelujah so you
[1:06:22] could be sitting in church and you could
[1:06:23] see Heaven literally opened up and the
[1:06:26] person next to you could be sitting
[1:06:27] there wondering when it's all going to
[1:06:29] end that's true Hallelujah but he had a
[1:06:32] real
[1:06:32] need Hallelujah he had to get the he had
[1:06:35] to get a hold of God I don't know what
[1:06:37] he was expecting but God normally gives
[1:06:38] us greater than we expect amen Glory
[1:06:41] Hallelujah and and then when he saw this
[1:06:44] he says woe is me for I'm undone because
[1:06:46] I'm a man of unclean lips I dwell in the
[1:06:48] midst of a people of unclean lips for
[1:06:50] mine eyes have seen the king the Lord of
[1:06:52] hosts then flew one of the serams unto
[1:06:54] me having a live coal in his hand which
[1:06:57] he had taken with tongs from off the
[1:06:58] Altar and he laid it upon my mouth and
[1:07:00] said Lo this has touched thy lips and
[1:07:03] thy iniquity is taken away and thy sin
[1:07:05] is purged now a live coal it means a red
[1:07:07] hot stone so it wasn't it wasn't just a
[1:07:11] you know a coal it was white hot it was
[1:07:13] a red hot stone it was burning Hots what
[1:07:15] happened something that was on fire
[1:07:17] touched his lips and purged him and took
[1:07:19] all of his iniquity and sinners you you
[1:07:22] know sin away Hallelujah that's why a
[1:07:25] fire came that's why you know we this is
[1:07:27] not
[1:07:28] psychology we could spend a lot of time
[1:07:30] saying what this not is I mean what this
[1:07:32] isn't but what this is is we need a
[1:07:34] burning bush experience this is why we
[1:07:37] come to church as a burning bush because
[1:07:39] it was more than a physical Bush that
[1:07:40] was God veiled in a pillar of fire came
[1:07:43] down and spoke to his Prophet amen and I
[1:07:45] believe that's why we come to church so
[1:07:47] we have a burning bush
[1:07:48] experience Hallelujah you say well I had
[1:07:51] that years ago you can always have
[1:07:52] another one that's right H you can
[1:07:55] always have it again you know you read
[1:07:56] through the book of Acts they they Reed
[1:07:58] the Holy Ghost on the day of Pentecost
[1:08:00] but they are refilled many times why did
[1:08:02] they need the refilling because the
[1:08:03] devil was trying to put things in their
[1:08:05] Spirit to stop them being Victorious
[1:08:07] Christians and God just came down and
[1:08:09] burnt it out Hallelujah that's why we
[1:08:12] need a burning out it's not because
[1:08:13] we've done something wrong but many
[1:08:14] times the devil tries to put something
[1:08:16] on us to try and disable our walk and
[1:08:18] stop us being Victorious that's why I
[1:08:20] said God burn it out of me yes sir
[1:08:22] Hallelujah whatever the devil would try
[1:08:24] and put on us put you know put in our
[1:08:26] spirit
[1:08:27] realm amen so a red hot coal touches
[1:08:30] lips something that was on
[1:08:33] fire Hallelujah brother Ram says in
[1:08:35] Israel in the church says brother I tell
[1:08:37] you it means a whole lot more than
[1:08:39] running up and shaking hands with the
[1:08:41] preacher a few drops of water sprinkled
[1:08:43] on you that's right brother it runs a
[1:08:45] whole lot more than walking up to the
[1:08:47] Altar and taking communion and walking
[1:08:49] back and sitting in your seat it means
[1:08:51] to selling out dying out brother and
[1:08:54] getting an oldfashioned backwards sky
[1:08:56] blue sin killing religion that don't
[1:08:59] wash you white it don't white wash you
[1:09:03] it washes you white what's a white wash
[1:09:05] it's just you're painted over it's just
[1:09:07] like a veneer gets over the top you know
[1:09:10] what is a you know a message face can be
[1:09:12] just a whitewash yeah we can play the
[1:09:15] part we can say the part we can play the
[1:09:17] role really well but that's just a white
[1:09:20] wash we need to be wash white on the
[1:09:23] inside of the inside Hallelujah cleanses
[1:09:26] you up Burns you out scars you out
[1:09:28] sterilizes you makes you a new person
[1:09:31] amen that's old sfas kind brother but I
[1:09:34] tell you it's it'll stick to your ribs
[1:09:36] get some of it that's right it'll hold
[1:09:38] you through the trials amen I feel like
[1:09:40] shouting pretty near it's pretty big yes
[1:09:42] sir he said Hallelujah I'm glad we I'm
[1:09:45] glad that's available amen aren't you
[1:09:47] glad that's available yes sir Hallelujah
[1:09:49] now Jeremiah God spoke to
[1:09:52] him and Jeremiah you know he had a real
[1:09:56] difficult job no one liked him he never
[1:09:59] had good news what does the Lord say
[1:10:02] today Jeremiah repent or perish comes
[1:10:05] back again what did he say this time
[1:10:08] what sermons he going to preach doesn't
[1:10:11] matter where he started where he ended
[1:10:13] was you better turn from your idols and
[1:10:15] get rid of them otherwise God's going to
[1:10:17] destroy you all take you into captivity
[1:10:18] that's basically his sermons what kind
[1:10:21] of church would that would that would
[1:10:22] have been Hallelujah are we happy to be
[1:10:25] in the house of little today maybe he
[1:10:26] would ask I don't know how you ask that
[1:10:28] question you know but but but he had a
[1:10:30] real hard job but the wonderful thing is
[1:10:33] the more opposition there is the greater
[1:10:35] the force of God behind you know
[1:10:37] combating it because the Lord said
[1:10:39] greater that is in you that is in the
[1:10:40] world to us I mean so so the greater
[1:10:43] sign who's ever done physics or maths or
[1:10:45] you know the greater than sign so
[1:10:48] whatever's behind you know the greater
[1:10:50] sign eats up the smaller well I might
[1:10:52] get this wrong but you know this one's
[1:10:54] greater than this one yes Hallelujah so
[1:10:57] this one can never be greater than this
[1:10:59] one unless the sign does this but when
[1:11:02] it comes to God it canot can't do that
[1:11:03] this is God on this side he's greater
[1:11:05] than this one am Hallelujah so it
[1:11:09] doesn't matter the the size of whatever
[1:11:12] is on this side of the
[1:11:13] equation it can be the biggest number
[1:11:16] you can fathom this one is always
[1:11:18] greater than that one hallelujah oh 200
[1:11:21] 100 what 200,000,000 demons released
[1:11:24] from the review fre has never been here
[1:11:26] on the Earth but now it's here that's
[1:11:28] still on this side of the equation
[1:11:29] hallelujah hallelujah one man on this
[1:11:32] side filled with the Holy Ghost or woman
[1:11:35] or child is greater than all of
[1:11:37] Hell Hallelujah brother R would say that
[1:11:41] that that a child of God that's just
[1:11:43] been you know made a new creature in
[1:11:45] Christ for like one second has greater
[1:11:46] Authority with God than the Archangel
[1:11:50] that never knew sin Hallelujah you know
[1:11:53] I don't know how much talking the
[1:11:54] archangels do but as soon as you start
[1:11:56] talking to God he says
[1:11:57] sh hold that
[1:11:59] thought you know my child's talking to
[1:12:02] me right now hallelujah amen but
[1:12:05] Jeremiah had a lot of
[1:12:07] trouble and he came to a point in his
[1:12:09] life he says I'm just not going to talk
[1:12:11] anymore he would say in Jeremiah 28 for
[1:12:14] since I spake I cried out I cried
[1:12:16] violence and spoil because the word of
[1:12:18] the Lord was made a reproach unto me and
[1:12:20] a derion daily then I said I will not
[1:12:24] make mention of him nor speak anymore in
[1:12:27] his name but his word so so that that
[1:12:30] was his decision but there was a greater
[1:12:32] force on the inside of his life that
[1:12:34] couldn't leave him in that kind of state
[1:12:37] he says but his word was in my heart
[1:12:40] amen as a burning fire shut up in my
[1:12:42] bones and I was weary with forbearing
[1:12:45] and I could not stay so he got weary it
[1:12:48] was like a he was like a powder Kake a
[1:12:50] pressure cooker that was building up cuz
[1:12:52] like fire in his bones he got weary I
[1:12:54] just Can't Hold This in anymore that's
[1:12:56] right Hallelujah that's how we should be
[1:12:59] there should be a goodness like Honey in
[1:13:00] the Rock just coming amen
[1:13:04] Glory
[1:13:06] Hallelujah brother bam says this and
[1:13:08] earnestly contend for the faith there
[1:13:10] there's a prayer he says father the best
[1:13:12] of my knowledge I have told the truth uh
[1:13:15] and all that I know how to say that that
[1:13:18] is the truth it's the faith and now Lord
[1:13:21] Jesus you who so wondrously said these
[1:13:23] words I'll be with you moving in you to
[1:13:25] the end of the world won't you come
[1:13:27] tonight and manifest your Resurrection
[1:13:29] in the power of deity the power of
[1:13:31] vision the power of healing the power of
[1:13:33] forgiveness of sins manifest yourself to
[1:13:36] us we waiting children hungry hearted we
[1:13:39] want to see the manifestation of the
[1:13:42] faith that was once delivered to the
[1:13:44] Saints no matter how many times you come
[1:13:47] Lord I still love it I want to see it
[1:13:50] again and again for I love you I want to
[1:13:52] be with you forever I thought that sums
[1:13:54] me up real well yes Hallelujah now the
[1:13:59] the disciples had a lot of
[1:14:00] opposition but the one that met Moses in
[1:14:03] the Burning Bush was the same one that
[1:14:05] became flesh in Jesus Christ and was the
[1:14:07] same one that came down into the upper
[1:14:09] room Hallelujah they came in touch with
[1:14:12] fire it was a consuming fire it was a
[1:14:14] holy fire now what was the reason that
[1:14:16] they came into that is because they were
[1:14:19] called to be part of the second part of
[1:14:22] the prophecy you know there was a
[1:14:26] prophecy about how Jesus would ride on a
[1:14:29] donkey into Jerusalem it went from
[1:14:32] prophecy but then it became
[1:14:34] history right it went from prophecy to
[1:14:38] history but there was another part of
[1:14:40] the word that had to be fulfilled is
[1:14:43] there had to be a resurrection yes and
[1:14:46] there had to be a people that match that
[1:14:48] prophecy yes sir when when Joel
[1:14:52] prophesied and he said I will pour pour
[1:14:55] out my spirit out upon All Flesh and I
[1:14:58] young men I may get this mixed up but we
[1:15:00] all read the Bible we know where I'm
[1:15:02] talking from you know young men will
[1:15:04] dream dreams old men will see Visions on
[1:15:06] my handmaids and my servants I'll pour
[1:15:08] out my spirit now when God prophesied
[1:15:11] that through the mouth of Joel he knew
[1:15:13] the people that he pour himself out upon
[1:15:16] God did he already had that in his mind
[1:15:18] he you know God never wonders I wonder
[1:15:21] who's going to fulfill this you know he
[1:15:23] doesn't sit there you know watching not
[1:15:25] that he has a big screen in heaven but
[1:15:27] like watching watching eating popcorn I
[1:15:29] wonder how this is going to happen how's
[1:15:31] it going to happen it's going to happen
[1:15:32] but how's it going to happen no he knows
[1:15:33] how it's going to happen and he releases
[1:15:36] his word in a season that there's a
[1:15:38] people that are connected with that word
[1:15:40] that are drawn to that word amen now if
[1:15:44] I can find a oh here we
[1:15:48] go and then I won't be too much longer I
[1:15:51] better not be too much longer I've
[1:15:52] already late but now but speaks about
[1:15:55] the Chinese
[1:15:57] laundrymen he says he says in America he
[1:15:59] said there' be Chinese who who who used
[1:16:02] to be laundrymen they didn't speak
[1:16:03] English and of course the Americans
[1:16:05] didn't speak Chinese so when someone
[1:16:06] would bring in some clothes to be washed
[1:16:08] that'd be that'd be good you know that'd
[1:16:10] hand it in the Chinese man would take a
[1:16:12] receipt re rip it in half and give one
[1:16:14] half to the customer and and he hold the
[1:16:16] other half and now it wouldn't and and
[1:16:20] you had to have the parts that marry
[1:16:23] up if I tried just say if this hanky
[1:16:26] came in right and I try I you know I
[1:16:28] decided one day I'm going to get a hanky
[1:16:29] I'm going to get it from the Chinese
[1:16:30] laundryman and I came in with a bit of
[1:16:33] paper that I ripped and said here's for
[1:16:36] hanky he would pick up the other half
[1:16:40] and he'd go like this and say no right
[1:16:43] cuz they don't match right so there's no
[1:16:46] way I'm going to get the hanky because
[1:16:48] these don't match but then if I came in
[1:16:50] with the other half then I received the
[1:16:54] piece of good
[1:16:55] yes sir now this is how prophecy this is
[1:16:57] just this this is just how I see it this
[1:16:59] is how prophecy is God has one ho he
[1:17:03] rips it in half one half is the prophecy
[1:17:07] and the other half is those who will
[1:17:09] fulfill the prophecy amen and they are
[1:17:11] made to come together
[1:17:14] perfectly just like Moses was ordained a
[1:17:17] deliverer is going to come he was the
[1:17:19] other half of the prophecy and that's
[1:17:21] why the Lord spoke to out of the burning
[1:17:22] bush cuz he was the other part of the
[1:17:24] prophecy and they had to come together
[1:17:26] now there were disciples gathered in the
[1:17:29] first coming of Jesus
[1:17:31] Christ Jesus came he went by fisherman
[1:17:35] he went he went to the woman at the well
[1:17:37] he went to Matthew as a tax collector he
[1:17:39] went to all the unlikelies of Israel
[1:17:41] amen
[1:17:43] glory now if you went to the woman at
[1:17:45] the
[1:17:46] well and said do you
[1:17:50] know that you are the
[1:17:52] Fulfillment of a prophecy
[1:17:55] she would look at you say that man has
[1:17:57] had too much son he's a crazy guy what's
[1:18:00] he trying to get out of me oh you got a
[1:18:02] Peter James and John you ask them Peter
[1:18:06] James and John there's going to come a
[1:18:07] time where God's going to the messiah's
[1:18:09] going to come he's on the Earth right
[1:18:10] now he's going to call a people then
[1:18:12] he's going to come and dwell he's going
[1:18:13] to die on the cross for them take all
[1:18:15] their sins away then he's going to send
[1:18:16] up into heaven pour His holy spirit Into
[1:18:18] You The Same Spirit that's in the holy
[1:18:20] of holies in the temple that was in the
[1:18:21] days of Solomon is going to dwell in you
[1:18:23] and you're going to be a living house of
[1:18:24] the living God he' say well that's
[1:18:26] something but then but but then he but
[1:18:29] then you'd ask now Peter James and John
[1:18:31] who do you think will fulfill that
[1:18:32] prophecy and they I doubt very much
[1:18:34] would say I think that's
[1:18:37] me because these were the fishermen that
[1:18:40] were literate they weren't they weren't
[1:18:42] where even the Apostle well Saul was
[1:18:44] before he became Paul scholar learned
[1:18:47] men raised up in the synagogue or maybe
[1:18:50] the next chief priest or high priest or
[1:18:52] you know the people that people would
[1:18:54] consider
[1:18:55] they're the ones to fulfill the
[1:18:58] prophecy now I'm going to jump from here
[1:19:01] to there and back again you would never
[1:19:04] think the woman at the well in her state
[1:19:07] would be one of the 120 in the upper
[1:19:10] room you wouldn't consider her would you
[1:19:13] Peter James Peter is the spokesman you
[1:19:15] know you're you're on the day of
[1:19:16] Pentecost here's a guy who tries to kill
[1:19:19] a guy with a sword attempted murderer
[1:19:21] who says he you know he'll never deny
[1:19:23] his you you know the one who he believes
[1:19:26] is the Messiah denies him three times
[1:19:28] curses while doing it fails miserably
[1:19:30] tries to go back to his old life fishing
[1:19:32] fails at that you know but there's
[1:19:34] something about the other part of the
[1:19:36] prophecy that when the Lord comes near
[1:19:38] they just want to go into his presence
[1:19:39] you know CU at the rising of the sun
[1:19:41] they hear a voice from The Shore Bank
[1:19:43] saying have you caught any fish I doubt
[1:19:46] very much Peter said Hallelujah none
[1:19:49] we've been fishing all day thank you for
[1:19:51] asking none haven't got any you know I
[1:19:55] doubt he was very happy about put
[1:19:57] yourself there you know these are people
[1:19:58] like you and I I've never seen a happy
[1:20:01] fisherman after all night fishing coming
[1:20:02] back with nothing skipping and dancing
[1:20:04] and saying well that was a great time
[1:20:06] you know and but then John had a look
[1:20:08] again said and told Peter it's the Lord
[1:20:11] and Peter doesn't worry about anything
[1:20:12] else he just jumps into the sea swims to
[1:20:15] where he is gets out on the bank he
[1:20:16] doesn't know if he's going to be
[1:20:18] received but there's something about
[1:20:19] that part of the prophecy that when it
[1:20:21] comes together with the other part of
[1:20:23] the prophecy it doesn't know how it be
[1:20:24] received but it'll come anyway and
[1:20:26] there's something with you and I trust
[1:20:27] I'm coming Lord Jesus anyway I don't
[1:20:29] know if I'll be cast out I don't know if
[1:20:31] be made fun of don't know if I'll be
[1:20:33] even accepted but here Lord Jesus I come
[1:20:37] Hallelujah and then Jesus asked him do
[1:20:39] you love me he asked him three times you
[1:20:41] know and then Peter answers at the end
[1:20:43] of it you know I love you
[1:20:46] anyway the ones who are to fulfill the
[1:20:48] prophecy naturally look like the most
[1:20:50] unlikely bunch of people glory amen and
[1:20:55] and here okay so now we want to jump
[1:20:57] from here to now this is the second
[1:20:59] coming of Christ sir there's a prophecy
[1:21:02] that there'll be people alive and
[1:21:04] remain right there's a Rapture and
[1:21:07] there's a people that are ordained to
[1:21:09] fulfill the prophecy you know when Paul
[1:21:12] was inspired to write first
[1:21:14] Thessalonians I believe God in his mind
[1:21:17] thought of you and I hallelujah amen he
[1:21:20] knew he knew when it would happen God
[1:21:22] did and knew who was going to take that
[1:21:24] rapture God did so when that was
[1:21:26] inspired to Paul he said you're the
[1:21:28] matching part and so this is why this
[1:21:31] message has called you and I I pray
[1:21:32] you've been called I pray this is more
[1:21:34] than a religion and this is what Mommy
[1:21:36] and Daddy do but there's a call in your
[1:21:37] heart there's a longing hallelujah what
[1:21:39] is that you've been called to fulfill
[1:21:41] the other part of the word not look back
[1:21:43] into history and say yes that's history
[1:21:45] but what's going to be fulfilled next
[1:21:47] it's the coming of the Lord hallelujah
[1:21:50] so here they are here we are are here he
[1:21:53] say here I am I'm here to fulfill the
[1:21:56] next part of the scripture and that's
[1:21:58] why that's why I've been
[1:22:00] called hallelujah it's because I'm here
[1:22:04] to fulfill the next part of the
[1:22:06] prophecy and I said I go back here and
[1:22:09] come back again but what I think I just
[1:22:10] leave it there he say what gives me
[1:22:13] purpose in life that should give you
[1:22:14] purpose in life Joseph was gripped by
[1:22:18] two dreams yes sir his whole life was
[1:22:21] gripped by those two dreams didn't
[1:22:23] matter if he was in prison or what kind
[1:22:24] of prison a slave whatever more his
[1:22:26] whole life was focused around
[1:22:28] that because he was part of a prophecy
[1:22:33] he didn't know he was part of that
[1:22:34] prophecy that Abraham was given that I
[1:22:36] told you about Moses Joseph was part of
[1:22:38] that prophecy because they had to go
[1:22:40] down and a Strange Land be there 400
[1:22:41] years how' they get down there initially
[1:22:43] by Joseph that's
[1:22:45] right that's why this message I trust
[1:22:47] has called you here's the word here's
[1:22:50] the people ordained and something in you
[1:22:53] says It just fits me so so
[1:22:55] well
[1:22:57] hallelujah amen praise the
[1:23:00] Lord amen now we're going to have a time
