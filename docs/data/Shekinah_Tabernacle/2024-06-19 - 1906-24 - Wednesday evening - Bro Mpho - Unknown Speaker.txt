========================================

he's no no it is God who gives you that desire and then he provide the desire I mean if it's done properly if it's done on the heart that has been anointed by the spirit of God and the Stony heart is he gives you the heart that is why sister hat right that is why sister right when the prophet said sister you ask anything that you will right now I mean a normal human being desire he even the prophet gave him the clue he said sister you can ask for for a million you can ask for this for this for this carnal things but God God provided a desire for her that's right and then he made her to request that desire are you are you following me Hallelujah so I I I wrote here and I said in because in our own human capacity and will our will our human ability our capability it is actually impossible to worship God it is impossible to worship God according to his will and his will is capacity his Godly capacity in in our own way we that is why he must remove the heart so that we can be able to worship Him according to his will according to his desire desire for us that is why he needs to do that in our own there's many there's many who are worshiping there's many even the Bible says in that day many are going to say Lord Lord didn't I do this in your name did not I do this did I not heal people did I not do this of course you did of course they did it's not us none of us there will be those ones who will be saying that but because H this reminds me of the message that the prophet preached about doing God a service without his without it being his will you see everything that we do we must make sure that our desire is a god provided one is aligned with God's desire for you amen are we together why why I say he will give you the right desire of your heart is that we have many desires that is we've got many desires we've got many needs and wants some don't necessarily go according to word as I've already said so the question is what is your desire and why that desire there's primary desires there's secondary desires you know there's deep desires there's shallow desires there's the needs there's wants you know there's wish lists at my workplace sometimes we have a meeting they say oh what's what's on your budget list I hear that term here here in New Zealand for the first time call they say what's on your bucket list as a bucket list for the first time I got lost then I learn I learned a bucket list mean a wish list if you say let me not dive it so some needs are shallow some are deep some are really heavy everyone has got desires needs wants in economics we talk about there's a need and there's a want so a want is something that you can live without a need is almost like something that you really need you almost cannot you need to live you need this thing you need water that is your need you need food you need clothes but you see I need that specific jacket it's no more a need it's a one can you see where desires can so my my my my desire should be aligned to what God's desire for me is for that thing I want to be a little bit slow tonight Brother David I don't want to rush but how can we show that our hearts most important desire are aligned with God's God's God's word God's heart how can we ensure that how can I make sure that God's need desire for me is aligned so this bringing to brings me to the point of saying okay on on Sunday my Sunday school class will remember and I deviated a lot but if you hear me touching on something that we spoke just say Amen if you remember what what is our purpose here on Earth why do we exist I want to show you that God had a desire the the the whole thing how it started even before God was God because there was a time when God was not God are we there but then he had a desire he had a need he had certain things in him that oh I've got these things but I I want to bring them out that's right and they started to think because you see God's thoughts are real they are not like my thoughts where I just they're not imagination God's thoughts are not imagination God's thoughts are are real like more than this thing yes this thing is just air but God's things are God's thoughts are real then he started to think then about you you emerged he started to to deliberately purposefully think about Hey Na oh yes and I wanted to be this way this way this country at this time Lou he said God took his time to started to think because he had desires he had certain attributes he had certain things in him and he said then then he said how am I going to fulfill those ones he started to have a desire to want to be God in that process he started to think about you that is why we say we were there with him before the foundation of the world that's what we mean because in his thought is is as real more than what we live the life that we call live here it's just that right now because of this limit we can't remember that we were there in the before the foundation of the earth before the Earth was created you he said oh fish I'm going to even tell him tell them to give him a nickname called fish philli he going to be fish Ben and then BB is going to be this one and then he thought about you he took time and he deliberately on purpose because he had a desire he had a desire to be a Healer he had a desire to be God he had a desire to be a father he had a desire he had desires and he wanted to fulfill those desires then then he he created you then you came to exist in God's mind right how many amens this uh because uh um what did I write here I was on the point of why do we exist that that is the very that is the very essence of why we exist on Earth right now why we exist is because of this explanation that I've just given you now that oh it was I can't say it's God's fault it was God's plan it was God's thoughts right now you exist everything that I I represent I see here is supposed to be actually fulfilling that desire for God are we together okay I'll confirm it for you let's read ecclesiastics I always struggle with this one e Ecclesiastes thank you brother chapter 12 I'll go slow tonight and then very soon we'll be done um 12 verse 7 listen to that one H I always like not to read on the computer but on my Bible 12 verse 7 are we all there are you listening young people young people are you listening to me I don't want to call you by name and I don't want to intimidate you I just want to be the nicest brother or uncle but I want you to attend L listen to what I'm reading now then shall the dust return to the Earth as it was and this remember the dust is just this this is not you this was not featuring anywhere when even God it was not the thoughts that I'm talking about this came later when God this this the flesh came later on right that is why he says the flesh will return to where it was to the Earth where it was and the spirit shall return unto God who gave it right listen to this vanity of vanities said the preacher all is Vanity so we want to make sure that our desires are not part of the vanity yeah and I'm not saying your desires Earthly desires are wrong all I'm saying is that they need to be aligned with God's desires first God's desire then my desire my desires becomes primary secondary right the moment your desires are aligned with God's desires then you are sorted I'm looking for this verse let's jump to verse 13 the verse 13 can I read it for you let us hear the conclusion of the whole matter therefore if I was even a Bible writer I was going to say therefore you know that word therefore it's like you're you're closing therefore sister Naomi let us now let us hear the conclusion of the whole matter matter is anything that has got what is matter students K what is matter anything that has Mama help the children teacher matter is anything that has got that can occupy a space and substance right anything substance you students are forgetting so the the whole the the the end to the whole matter whatever is matter the end the conclusion of everything is this fear God comma and keep his Commandments for this is the whole not partly this is the whole Duty of man this this this this this thing that the whole matter your whole existence your whole plan everything the conclusion of it is that fear God and keep all his because you've got a new heart M isn't it he gave you a new heart he gave you a new heart and through that heart in your own heart Stone one of this flesh we can't so once we've got a new heart he give you the new spirit the whole matter that spirit and that heart is going to make you to come to to align with this conclusion you're agreeing with me for God shall bring every work into judgment with every secret thing whether it be good or it be evil but my point here is that the conclusion of the whole matter is that it reminds me of a scripture that says seek ye first the kingdom of God first amen I'm going to be very slow tonight and uh I want to read for you here where the preacher Reverend Brenham said in the spoken we expectation he said if there's a desire to worship God if there is a desire to worship God even the hot and to and Indians in Years Gone by you know the hot and to there in Africa there in the years has gone by they worshiped objects because the very creation of worship was in their heart and they worship something they worship something as their creator and that showed that there was a Creator somewhere to worship a God that's the whole whole purpose of a human being if you find a human being who does not want to worship God you know that they've lost the whole purpose why they exist because that's the whole reason why God thought about you and he knew that you are going to do it that's why he thought about you he knew that you are going to fulfill with the purpose of the whole matter and he cre he thought about you he made you the way he made you and he chose you because he knew that you are going to first of all put him first worship because that's where everything is going to come out I was teaching the kids there I said hey if God we say God is his he's everything don't we sing that song and then we say we but we want things in our lives we want things and God is every and we want things in our lives right we don't want to remain with n and God is every and we want some sometimes we want everything you heard about the needs and the ones if I can tell you now I go to a family I say sister Joe what do you want I'll get a long list hey my sister I'll get a long list if she comes to me and ask what do you want Oh man she'll get A4 this both sides doublesided because we've got needs and desires and everything but this is this is the key thing if we want to want everything or desire everything that we want but actually we can just take God and then we've got everything that's right you see because because he's got if God is is everything and then we want some things then we just take him wholeheartedly the way the scripture says and then because in him there's everything the only difference is that this time everything is going to go according to this perfect will perfect underline that perfect who doesn't want a perfect receiving of something you know if you want a a dress a perfect one who doesn't want a perfect can you imagine that God would would be careful that you get that dress that you you you want because he ordained to be that way that is why I'm not I don't understand when people say no no go Jesus is just in the heart don't worry about the outside God is careful about everything amen everything he even was very careful to design the shape of your hair and how it will that's why that is why little Gabriel can't look like exactly at the D God is very careful he made B this way and Maggi but he knew Gabriel is coming he designed him this way so that because you are and the reason why each and every one of you is unique is because is because God you are special God took time to think about you he didn't think about me and then he think about someone by by the way no each and everyone God was very careful that your fingerprints your is it they call it the iris in the eye that there certain things in our bodies in nature they just show that God he purposefully created and thought about you even science man science to some extent I think they use Faith but they don't know that is faith if science can believe that ah we can make we can make something like a bed that can fly and and and they they persevere and they make it the right brothers and they make that thing it fall they make it they were using Faith so if if if faith for a human being to make a microphone something I can speak here and then it is audible there if faith can do that caral Faith how much more about this Faith you're talking about that is the one that God used to create the heavens and the Earth it's so powerful it's so powerful that to to not realize that faith is a substance man you must go to your knees man it is the evidence let's just continue and finish here we owe all our existence to worship and fellowship with him because otherwise he wouldn't have created us God wouldn't have made you and me if he knew that you're are not going to worship him in his purpose he would have because there there did somewhere where there say it says somewhere created to be just to be thrown away to be destroyed some were created to go to life some too that is why I'm saying God is a strange God don't ask me why he said he he he's a strange God and he doesn't want us to worship the god the strange Gods we owe all our existence to his Fellowship to his glory to worship Him the moment we put him as number one of all things our desires our everything is going to come from there amen our everything because he is everything to you he may not be everything to somebody but to you he is everything and everything that you saw desire he saw that he had certain qualities or I already spoke about this let me not repeat myself now a fully surrendered heart in order to clearly align your needs and your desires and everything we need need a full fully surrendered heart and life that's when God will then starts to make be a mechanic and take out that heart put a new heart because we are fully surrendered fully surrendered is that in other words you gave up on yourself you give up you come to a point in your life where you say I I then you once you give up and you surrender he knows because he was there when he was created he created you and he made you said then then he knows that ah she has reached now and then everything is done now now you you are now you are you you are be called No More em you are becoming you are now a what we call an amature God you are an amateure God you are you are a the world depends on you did I say that that listen if God can just remove us now here on this Earth it's done it's chaos that you'll never never never want to be here so you and me because the Holy Ghost is here the moment he takes us and change our bodies and we go home it's done so that which means that we've got so much power that we don't realize what we have if I give you a billion dollar and I say now here I'll come back in 10 years share with your sister if you want share with the sister in this row if you want or share with this Brothers this side it's up to you I'll come back in 10 years time a billion are you going to be bothered and be worried about oh I wonder if I've got it or I wonder when he comes are you going to be bothered you're going sister you're not going to be worried the you're just going to be eating the interest just the cream H and maybe because I said all your discretion use it do what you want I'll come back in 10 years you're not going to be worried about I wonder if he will want me to no no listen you have been given more than a billion you have been given you have been given that one may God help us and just Lift us our faith lift it up just just just induce it a bit so that we can realize that we are powerful than the way we think sometimes when you pray get mad with the devil so mad you cry and get so mad that no you can't do this to me do you know who you're dealing with they so mad with the devil so angry that you you go to God and say I want leave this to me let me deal with the devil according to your way oh you get so mad because he likes playing tennis ball with us and we give it to him so easily and sometimes we and we forget who we are we mustn't our desires our everything must be coming after God's desires aligned and then we know that even when you can the Lord can let you because if you go through trials and temptations you know you've got a billion remember you're not worried you know healing is yours and you you take a step back in the presence of God and you relax and you are peaceful you've got a billion and you said Lord your will I know it's coming I I'm not suspecting I know it's coming and I know you want me to go through this so I'm reled take me through the torture take me through the fire it's okay because I know that even if I'm in that fire with Daniel like Daniel you are there I know so don't panic when you are a daughter or a son of God don't don't second guess yourself and doubt no no because he was there creating you are you with me I'm so today I'm I'm so relaxed full surrender in order to clearly really be aligned or align our needs and desires with god let's give everything let's let the whole complete job to be done in our lives young people I'm so passionate about talking to you because many of you are still on the journey at the back you know children you know if we can hire a bus now and we want to go to Oakland young people are going to see the big seat did you know that they like the back seat I don't know why back seat even me I like back seat because it's a long seat at the back where we even sitting on top of each other at the back there and one thing we know our fathers don't have eyes here that's why we like back seat when we so young people I know that on this journey some of you are still at the back but you are in the same bus so I want you to hear me correctly to love the front seat yeah to have a plan to be in the front cuz Joshua was not leading in the back seat and you are joshuas you are calebs let's close I want to close with this one think about the children of Israel okay before we come to them let me read this for you from the believer's position in Christ preached in 5516 16 he says and Paul not by desire don't let it don't let it pass above your head not by desire of not by choice not by the will of man or his own human desire but by the will of God he was an apostle we need some more like that by the will of God he was on his road to Damascus to arrest I don't know how many of you had that I'll read it again by the will of God he was on his road to Damascus to arrest by the will of God think of it was going to arrest the very group that he was sent to be the Apostle off now you see how upside down it looks like in the human element that God does things God does things that is why God is not to be understood or to be analyzed and to be processed in this way no no God is to be believed full stop he's to be believed that's all not otherwise you get you'll confuse yourself and and be everywhere and and just be perplexed everywhere just the very things that you think that you won't do that may be the very things that you but remember you've got a billion I want you to remember this you've got more than a billion without money without price no billion can afford you Asha you've got it no matter what daddy says you've got billion more than a billion dollars it's yours that's not the point of discussion what friends are saying at school whoever wants to try just just tell him that my friend by the way I just want to let you know I'm a son of the king if you want to be my brother be nice to me just just remind your friends hey actually I I I'm the one who's supposed to be helping you because I've got something that is more expensive amen you better share Lun with me I'm joking don't say that sorry it's not a place to joke but I'm trying to emphasize a point that no devil must intimidate you at school amen no no I remember many many years ago my father said to me hey look at me I said yeah he said be a stupid because that's what they call there out there cool wise clever until the very SE they call it wise and cool cool he said to me be a stupid for Jesus you know to be a a fool for Jesus is way way way better than to be the to be an Einstein yeah the person with the most high top highq IQ here to be a fool because you have taken the very core of the matter you have it yeah so I'm saying to you brothers and sisters in losing I want to encourage you to say think about the children of Israel you know some people here on Earth we've got desires some needs healing some needs strength someone needs food money protection housing jobs satisfaction wisdom you can think think wild we need all those things but I to as I told you you don't have to worry about all those he knows you need them just have him once you have him you've got all those things because we saying he everything to us think about let's close with the children children of Israel when they were on a journey from Egypt to the promised land did you realize did you ever pause and think and realize that he's he's everything he was everything to them if you need heat right now in this room he is he does not even need brother KU went to hustle and go buy us more put them around the No No he can bring heat without this airons and and make this room warm he's everything sinen and seen good and evil he's the core he's the source but the reason is he created everything to bring glory and honor and some things with the human mind when you look at them it's almost like you say ah was God evil no he was not evil but he allowed evil for his honor and Glory but there's a th bread group of people which is you that he made on his side I just want you to take this with you at home that he's everything to you if you need to sleep you can sleep he's your sleep he's your peace he's your everything he he if I don't know how I can overemphasize this but his main desire is for you to desire him first then once you've you've done that you've got everything now everything is no more is just according to to the time and plan of God and the plan and the timetable and it will come you you want a wife or you want a husband or you want a a a car you want a job you you can even specify Lord I want a job with this salary he can give it to you he will I've got testimonies of people who said Lord I mean have you ever had I mean Shak Tabernacle is one of those churches in the whole world that I've come across this funny people not funny strange people you know that is why you are close to my heart as a people have you ever had a testimony of someone praying for a husband that they haven't seen this is funny and it turns out that on that day that she was praying the husband something you know so God is a strange God and he works on both sides don't worry about the when and the how those are five senses questions you've got a billion
