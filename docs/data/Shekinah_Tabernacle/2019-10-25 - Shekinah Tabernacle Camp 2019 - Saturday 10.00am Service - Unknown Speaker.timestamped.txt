[18:10] [Music]
[18:14] I feel like I'm in good company
[18:20] and I see I see a lot of familiar faces
[18:24] actually I know most of you if you few
[18:29] maybe that I haven't met but it feels
[18:31] really nice to see to see friends and to
[18:34] see believers to look out in the crowd
[18:36] and see see fellow laborers in the
[18:39] gospel to see the see redeemed ones the
[18:42] ones that the Lord's redeemed the ones
[18:44] as Lords the Lord loves and to see
[18:50] Christ and each one of you because
[18:52] that's what we that's what we look to we
[18:54] look to thee the unseen we don't really
[18:58] look at the scene like the sky here is
[18:59] the scene you know he makes a lot of
[19:04] mistakes and he messes up he does all
[19:06] these things but you know it's the
[19:07] unseen it's Christ's enemy hopefully
[19:09] that you can see cuz that's perfect
[19:12] that's great most of the time he's not
[19:16] overly great now and then I get it
[19:17] perfect but not often maybe you guys
[19:19] have more success than me but you know
[19:21] that's the that's how we overcome as
[19:26] believers with each other as when we see
[19:27] Christ in each other and we deal with
[19:30] the Christ and then in each other rather
[19:32] than the flesh you know everything just
[19:35] is just really really easy it's really
[19:38] found that it's not that hard you know
[19:41] the Christian walk is not hard when you
[19:43] just surrender to Christ and they live
[19:44] live very very easy you won every battle
[19:48] any circumstances just
[19:51] you know even when it's raining it's the
[19:52] sun shining when you work with Christ I
[19:55] mean so I'm just gonna open a prayer
[20:00] blessing that's just open a prayer first
[20:02] you can just stay seated
[20:03] Heavenly Father were so grateful that we
[20:05] can be here gathered here this morning

[20:28] that Lord you always come where you're

[20:37] want you Lord or may you feel welcome in
[20:40] our midst this morning Lord may you may

[20:52] commit the service to you bless the
[20:54] songs bless their ministry Lord or may
[20:56] we just fix our eyes upon the unseen
[20:58] this morning Lord upon the eternal
[21:00] things Lord or may the Spirit of God
[21:02] have full control and full Liberty in
[21:05] this place I rebuke any wrong spirit

[21:44] so much energy little guys so I've got
[21:47] two little children's songs and some of
[21:49] them are action songs well I've actually
[21:51] all our action songs are some of them I
[21:52] don't know the actions for
[21:54] if you're like a child up to the age of
[21:56] how's the child - about ten years old
[21:57] maybe eight ten years ten year olds will

[22:04] few songs but we all can join in right

[22:08] fun songs because there's another thing
[22:11] with children they're fun and if you're
[22:13] but if you're um older than that and you
[22:15] kind of want to come up anyway to do the
[22:17] actions you can maybe you never got to
[22:19] do it when you're a kid and you're
[22:21] formed of conflicts over it well we can
[22:22] break that today hey and maybe you just

[45:29] [Applause]
[45:48] go please and this song is called can
[45:52] you hear his voice I've put it into the
[45:55] system it should come up hopefully on
[45:57] the screen it's a song I wrote a few
[46:02] years ago and just it's been on my heart
[46:06] all week basically the song and then
[46:08] just some of the things that brother was
[46:10] ministering yesterday was in there as
[46:12] well and because we all got decisions to
[46:16] make all the time and to me that's the
[46:19] most important one is I want to know the
[46:22] Lord's mind I want to hear his voice in
[46:25] in my decisions I make and and there
[46:29] were some things in the ACA as well you
[46:30] got a die to yourself basically in what
[46:33] the Lord Jesus had to overcome was his
[46:35] own will and the will of men so you can
[46:39] have all these voices saying things but
[46:42] you got to listen to God's voice apart
[46:44] from all these other voices whether it's
[46:46] your own voice or someone else's voice
[46:48] and yeah so that and it might not be the
[46:51] most popular thing you know but praise
[46:57] the Lord him he came to be a servant of
[46:59] all that was what the Lord came for and
[47:03] and I think that's part of what we are
[47:05] here to do so yeah
[47:07] that's there was the inspiration of the
[47:10] song many years ago
[47:16] [Music]
[47:30] [Music]
[51:19] I mean find favor with God any men I
[51:40] mean it's just a nursing one or two
[51:43] worship songs before I invite brother
[51:44] beam up here this morning
[51:54] you deserve the
[51:57] [Music]

[1:00:44] to be in divine presence and I pray you
[1:00:49] take full advantage of it amen you know
[1:00:53] it's good to be in camping and the camp
[1:00:55] atmosphere but most of all we want to
[1:00:58] see Jesus a man like Paul said we want
[1:01:01] to know him in the power of his
[1:01:03] resurrection he meant I don't want to
[1:01:06] just say I came to camp in camp was nice
[1:01:08] but I want to leave with something of
[1:01:11] God in my life maybe I want to leave

[1:01:41] leave this camp my voice is gonna be
[1:01:44] stronger clearer amen
[1:01:50] you know let's just pray and we'll get
[1:01:53] into the Word of God a man if you have
[1:01:56] on his protocol question acknowledge to
[1:01:58] the Lord by uplifted hand amen let's
[1:01:59] pray Lord father truly you are awesome
[1:02:04] in this place and father we would ask
[1:02:08] ourselves where or what would we be if
[1:02:11] it wasn't for the grace of God nor we
[1:02:15] know without a shadow of a doubt most of
[1:02:17] us wouldn't be here but Lord you saw fit
[1:02:20] before the foundation of the world to
[1:02:23] play something divine presence Lord Lord
[1:02:26] to show us who we are and Lord not only
[1:02:30] that Lord reveal who you are to us so
[1:02:33] solo we thank you for times like this

[1:02:38] precious faith in the presence of a
[1:02:40] supernatural being Lord and Lord God we
[1:02:43] pray father that you will just increase
[1:02:46] your presence on the reality of your
[1:02:49] presence Lord God that you will just
[1:02:51] prove yourself Lord as we gather around
[1:02:57] your word Lord Lord you let your word
[1:02:59] know it manifest itself in the hearts of
[1:03:03] the believer Lord in the minds and the
[1:03:05] spirits of the believer Lord that we
[1:03:07] would know that Christ was with us as we
[1:03:10] saw joined in his place Lord and Lord
[1:03:13] God will be careful to give you all
[1:03:15] glory all honor Lord Lord whatever we
[1:03:18] have is because you gave it Lord nor
[1:03:21] that none of us come with the mindset to
[1:03:23] be seen but know the only one we want to
[1:03:26] see as you know the only voice we want
[1:03:29] to hear is your voice so lord we pray

[1:03:56] wonderful name of Jesus Christ the
[1:03:58] church amen
[1:04:00] they may have you have your Bibles let's
[1:04:01] go to First Samuel First Samuel amen
[1:04:12] it's maybe kind of late but brother when
[1:04:14] did y'all get a chance to plug up the
[1:04:16] monitors the floor monitors did y'all
[1:04:19] get a chance to get them going
[1:04:21] give me a little juice amen First Samuel
[1:04:28] chapter 16 and I'm gonna kind of read
[1:04:34] the scripture and then I'm gonna kind of
[1:04:35] go back with us a little bit after I get
[1:04:38] going by the grace of God first time he
[1:04:43] was 16 and let's not reading at verse 13
[1:04:49] then we go to Matthew 7 the Bible says
[1:04:54] in first time year 16 chapter I mean
[1:04:58] verse first time in 16 verse 14 no
[1:05:01] that's not at 13 then Samuel took the
[1:05:05] Horn of oil and anointed him in the
[1:05:08] midst of his brethren and the Spirit of
[1:05:12] the Lord came upon David from that day
[1:05:15] forward and Samuel rose up and went to
[1:05:20] Rhema but the Spirit of the Lord
[1:05:23] departed from Saul and an evil spirit
[1:05:27] from the Lord troubled him and Saul's
[1:05:32] servant said unto Him behold an evil
[1:05:36] spirit from God trouble at thee now look
[1:05:40] once the Spirit of God left Saul he
[1:05:44] didn't have to say anything the people
[1:05:46] around him saw that the evil spirit was
[1:05:48] on him now he saw his life begin to
[1:05:51] testify what kind of spirit was on him
[1:05:55] let's go to Matthew 7
[1:06:17] Matthew 7 and verse 15 the Bible says
[1:06:24] beware of false prophets which come to
[1:06:27] you in sheep's clothing but inwardly
[1:06:29] they are ravening wolves he shall know
[1:06:32] them by their fruits do men gather
[1:06:35] grapes of thorns and fakes of thistles
[1:06:37] even so every good tree bringeth forth
[1:06:40] good fruit but a corrupt tree bringeth
[1:06:43] forth evil fruit a good tree cannot
[1:06:47] bring forth evil fruit neither can a
[1:06:52] corrupt tree bring forth good fruit
[1:06:53] every tree that bringeth not forth good
[1:06:56] fruit is hewn down and cast into the
[1:06:59] fire wherefore by their fruits ye shall
[1:07:02] know them a mail-order blessed reading
[1:07:06] of his word you can have your seats
[1:07:17] pretty I'll bear with me this morning I
[1:07:20] don't want to take my time and just deal
[1:07:26] with this by the grace of God cuz I want
[1:07:28] I want you young people to see the life
[1:07:33] this is my subject the life of the
[1:07:35] Spirit the life of the Spirit now we
[1:07:41] know that we are trying means there are
[1:07:45] three things that make us up as humans
[1:07:48] and that's children of God would you
[1:07:50] have a body a soul in the spirit but I
[1:07:54] like to call it in the correct order you
[1:07:56] have a soul spirit body but I don't
[1:08:01] necessarily want to deal with your soul
[1:08:03] and I don't want to deal with your body
[1:08:07] but I want to deal with your spirit this
[1:08:09] morning because if I could say it like
[1:08:14] this
[1:08:14] the nature the life of your soul if
[1:08:18] you're a child of God that's already
[1:08:20] self it's already settled God already
[1:08:24] knows who you are now you may be living
[1:08:27] in sin but that does not change the seed
[1:08:30] within you honey if you're a child of
[1:08:33] God one day it's going to connect with
[1:08:36] the word and the true representation of
[1:08:38] your soul is gonna come out honey but I
[1:08:43] want to deal with that in between ground
[1:08:44] the spirit honey and not let's say your
[1:08:47] body because your spirit is that place
[1:08:50] that controls your body honey and you
[1:08:54] your thought processing your actions and
[1:08:57] all these things it shows the life of
[1:09:00] what's going on inside and I want you to
[1:09:04] understand I want to be really playing
[1:09:06] today that there are only two spirits
[1:09:11] two spirits holy good and evil holy and
[1:09:18] unholy righteous and unrighteous honey
[1:09:22] there's no in-between ground
[1:09:26] even you're serving God or you're
[1:09:29] serving the enemy your life will tell me
[1:09:36] what kind of spirit is motivating you
[1:09:39] and your spirit is very important
[1:09:43] because even right now if you get in the
[1:09:46] right spirit you hear God but the wrong
[1:09:51] spirit motivates you you won't even hear
[1:09:54] what God is saying Church first things
[1:09:57] first the Bible says they that worship
[1:10:00] Him must worship in what spirit and
[1:10:04] truth
[1:10:06] why spirit and truth because of the vs.
[1:10:10] fnatic says because God is a spirit so
[1:10:16] you know a lot of times you know in my
[1:10:19] my son used to play football
[1:10:20] one thing they used to do before they
[1:10:23] come out they get together in a circle
[1:10:25] and they start chanting you know they
[1:10:29] start what they say they will start
[1:10:31] getting in my rights for the game what
[1:10:33] are they doing they're getting in the
[1:10:34] spirit of the game you know they're
[1:10:37] trying to block out everything they may
[1:10:40] have heard that this other team is
[1:10:42] really great and they beat all the teams
[1:10:44] 40 to zero but they're trying to get in
[1:10:47] the spirit to say that's not gonna
[1:10:49] happen to us they're gonna get in the
[1:10:51] spirit we are with us and we are not
[1:10:53] losers so they're trying to get their
[1:10:55] minds right by getting in the right
[1:10:57] spirit and I'm telling you it's very
[1:11:01] important that you get in the right
[1:11:04] spirit hug because what if I was to come
[1:11:07] out here today and I was just no matter
[1:11:10] what your experience is I look at you
[1:11:12] and I say man you're going to hell
[1:11:15] doesn't matter what you do you're going
[1:11:17] to hell that'll affect you because words
[1:11:21] have power you know what I like talking
[1:11:24] I like using games and sports for
[1:11:27] analogies you just take the the greatest
[1:11:30] rubber pair you got you know and he
[1:11:33] comes out he gathers the team he's
[1:11:35] hey guys hey guys hey mate you know what
[1:11:40] mate we're gonna get our butts whooped
[1:11:43] today but we're gonna go out here and
[1:11:46] take that with him what would that do
[1:11:51] for his team he's the best plan he's
[1:11:55] telling everybody else that we're gonna
[1:11:57] get whipped what would that do for the
[1:12:00] spirit of the team it would literally
[1:12:03] take the life out of the whole team if
[1:12:09] the best player they got doesn't have
[1:12:12] any courage but what if he comes out and
[1:12:17] he says hey mate we are unstoppable hey
[1:12:23] mate we're gonna beat this team like
[1:12:27] they've never been beat before and did
[1:12:33] he begin to rally and everybody rallies
[1:12:36] behind him what is he doing he's he
[1:12:43] doing that by his spirit but I want you
[1:12:47] to understand that your spirit
[1:12:51] represents a life you can come to church
[1:12:56] you can sing and you can do all these
[1:12:59] things but if your spirit ain't right
[1:13:01] we'll be able to feel the life behind
[1:13:05] your song y'all know me but everything
[1:13:14] there's a spirit you know I was one who
[1:13:19] didn't buy my girls Barbie dolls no
[1:13:33] there's some life behind Barbie and just
[1:13:38] in case you don't understand let's look
[1:13:40] at Barbie a little bit swimsuit Barbie
[1:13:46] catwalk Barbie disco Bobby girlfriend
[1:13:51] Bobby some kind of Filth Barbie is
[1:13:54] always representing a man so you imagine
[1:13:59] when you buy Barbie that the spirit
[1:14:02] behind that doll gets on your daughter
[1:14:04] and you wonder why she wants a bathing
[1:14:07] suit
[1:14:07] you wonder why she wants jewelry and
[1:14:09] necklaces and high-heeled shoes because
[1:14:12] she's looking at catwalk Bobby you
[1:14:15] wonder why she wants a boyfriend because
[1:14:18] she's the girlfriend of King there is
[1:14:23] life behind everything but if I can look
[1:14:36] at when God anointed David you know the
[1:14:41] Bible says that that death Samuel went
[1:14:45] down to the house of Jesse and he said
[1:14:48] hey you know God told me to come down
[1:14:50] here because the next king is in your
[1:14:53] house so you whole life is gonna change
[1:15:03] the way we live is don't change how
[1:15:06] closings gonna change everything about
[1:15:08] us is gonna change our name my
[1:15:10] reputation everything's gonna change
[1:15:12] cuz I'll son my son it's gonna be a king
[1:15:17] just hearing about his son being a king
[1:15:22] jesse was happy why because he knew the
[1:15:25] life of that spirit he knew the life
[1:15:30] behind of a king what it means to be a
[1:15:33] king he had Dominion yet subjects yet
[1:15:37] rulership yet power all these things he
[1:15:40] had authority with His Word and just
[1:15:42] hearing that one of his boys was going
[1:15:45] to be a king he called sassy to get in
[1:15:48] the spirit
[1:15:49] and what was Jesse doing Jesse was
[1:15:52] getting in the spirit of being the
[1:15:54] father of a king
[1:15:56] Wow he wasn't even a king but he got
[1:16:03] excited because he was a father looking
[1:16:09] even know which boy was but all he knew
[1:16:12] probably was dead the anointing always
[1:16:15] there
[1:16:17] now where's my boys hey says hey go get
[1:16:24] this one go get down she got the first
[1:16:27] one probably tall dark and handsome he
[1:16:30] comes out there just ready to be
[1:16:36] anointed I wish some of you young kings
[1:16:40] and queens here was ready to be anointed
[1:16:43] I wish you will recognize or realize who
[1:16:50] you are that you are royalty that there
[1:16:54] is a life behind your seat give me a
[1:17:04] little bit more but now Church you you
[1:17:10] look first son he comes out and he
[1:17:12] stands there ready to be anointed I
[1:17:15] wonder if there's anybody in here ready
[1:17:18] to be anointed
[1:17:21] ready to be anointed Josh the anointing
[1:17:26] is he not are you ready for the
[1:17:29] anointing the Bible already says that we
[1:17:34] are royalty with Kings who were children
[1:17:37] of the Most High God no don't you do it
[1:18:04] don't you do it he might look like he's
[1:18:08] anointed he might look like the son of a
[1:18:11] god he's dressed right he has the right
[1:18:14] statue but I refuse him why because it's
[1:18:18] spirit ain't right look he was in the
[1:18:27] same house as David he had the same
[1:18:30] upbringing of David honey honey but he
[1:18:33] couldn't meet the criteria of the life
[1:18:36] behind that anointing God was going to
[1:18:45] anoint somebody earlier whose life can
[1:18:49] demonstrate the spirit behind the
[1:18:52] anointing so he's refused he brought it
[1:18:59] walks out I came to church for this and
[1:19:09] sat down it ain't nothing happened next
[1:19:16] brother comes out oh I want you to
[1:19:21] understand all these boys had an
[1:19:24] expectation
[1:19:27] all these boys were polish saying oh
[1:19:31] it's my turn it's my turn the staining
[1:19:35] of the horn it's my turn to be anointed
[1:19:38] they didn't go in there with a spirit
[1:19:41] saying it's not me they went in there
[1:19:43] saying oh it's my turn it's me what
[1:19:47] about you this morning can you have an
[1:19:50] attitude that says maybe it's me today
[1:19:54] Lord maybe I'm the one maybe I'm the
[1:19:57] chosen one
[1:20:02] maybe I'm the chosen one and the only
[1:20:07] thing that's gonna tell me that I'm not
[1:20:09] the chosen one is if God refuses me
[1:20:26] but Church another brother come same
[1:20:30] thing haven't refused fuse and then God
[1:20:32] had to tell Samuel because I think
[1:20:35] Samuel was probably getting a little
[1:20:37] discouraged because he knew God told him
[1:20:40] to go down there now I want you to
[1:20:43] understand this what's happening in
[1:20:45] Davis house has never happened before
[1:20:49] the last time God told Samuel to go
[1:20:53] anoint somebody it happened verbatim and
[1:20:56] that was so there was nobody else to
[1:21:01] strive with or anything God said go down
[1:21:03] in anointing and Samuel went down he
[1:21:06] anointed Saul David and Saul was
[1:21:10] anointed by the same message
[1:21:15] they were anointed by the same messenger
[1:21:22] so you don't tell me I don't care all
[1:21:25] the foolishness going on about this

[1:29:58] chose us about what we were going to do
[1:30:00] he chose us about what we're going to be
[1:30:09] he didn't choose me based upon my
[1:30:12] strength or based upon my knowledge or
[1:30:15] based upon how great my mind is he chose
[1:30:17] me because I came from him and I go back
[1:30:20] to him he chose me because why you can
[1:30:25] see this representation down inside of
[1:30:28] me even when I was in the nightclub
[1:30:33] I had the gene of God inside of me that
[1:30:42] young man that got up and testified even
[1:30:46] though he had problems with his flesh he
[1:30:48] was watching pornography he still had
[1:30:50] the gene of God inside of it there's no
[1:30:57] amount of sin that can stop you from
[1:31:00] coming into what God has for you so stop
[1:31:10] looking for a pity party they follow
[1:31:16] your knees is the Lord here am i anoint

[1:31:33] can close right here I goes right here
[1:31:39] if you just get in the spirit of the
[1:31:42] word right here in this moment and
[1:31:46] receive God in your life right here they
[1:31:50] don't take our preaching for God to deal
[1:31:53] with us
[1:31:54] [Applause]
[1:32:03] what I love about God he knows we're
[1:32:09] gonna fall short he knows we're gonna
[1:32:11] make mistakes that's why he gave his
[1:32:15] blood so when the devil comes hunting us
[1:32:21] he comes running to you saying you did
[1:32:24] this he comes trying to tear down your
[1:32:27] character what's your name says Chloe
[1:32:30] imagine the devil comes to God last
[1:32:41] night she was watching some things she
[1:32:43] should have been watching and because
[1:32:44] Chloe has accepted the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:32:46] as her Savior God listened to the devil
[1:32:49] and did he says I don't hear nothing you
[1:32:51] sing what are you talking about talking

[1:33:05] of the Lamb it doesn't matter what your
[1:33:10] mind says it doesn't matter what people
[1:33:12] may say all you need to know is that God
[1:33:15] has already made a way for you to be
[1:33:18] what he wants you to be whoo yeah yeah I
[1:33:26] did wrong but God fixed it
[1:33:30] oh yeah not by power not by might but by
[1:33:47] my what spirit save the Lord yeah I can
[1:33:58] feel it you know what's happening right
[1:34:00] now

[1:34:12] way he's scripturally placed the Bible
[1:34:14] says he belongs under your feet that's
[1:34:18] where he under your feet so you did it

[1:34:57] anything he can say is the exact
[1:35:00] opposite of the truth so he says you're
[1:35:04] not a child of God he's lying that must
[1:35:08] mean I am a child of God
[1:35:10] [Applause]

[1:37:34] to have a good meeting listen she says
[1:37:48] now in the meetings going on and evil
[1:37:50] spirits in the meeting that spirit is
[1:37:53] almost harmless until it can catch
[1:37:58] somebody that it can work through the

[1:45:08] reflection of the image you look in the
[1:45:16] mirror you see a man I'll tell you
[1:45:19] you're a man the only thing that's
[1:45:29] happening is seining is trying to
[1:45:32] pervert your mind he's trying to give

[1:45:39] something that you did not see about
[1:45:44] what you feel God is not a God of
[1:45:46] feelings bunch of nonsense

[1:46:09] they were fighting against bathroom
[1:46:19] means ridiculous you say buddies why's
[1:46:27] that ridiculous because you take a
[1:46:30] lesbian who gets all her rights to be
[1:46:32] able to go to the men's bathroom
[1:46:34] it does she feel liberated when she get
[1:46:36] in there no all of her mind when she
[1:46:39] gets in that bathroom she has a reality
[1:46:42] check because although she fought to be
[1:46:47] able to do what to me and do because she
[1:46:49] feels like a man when she gets access to
[1:46:51] that bathroom by the agent and she gets
[1:46:53] in there she uses it just like a woman
[1:47:01] so even though the enemy is telling her
[1:47:04] you're a man she's still hungry
[1:47:07] represents a woman that shows that the
[1:47:17] enemy is lying to her she don't feel
[1:47:21] liberated I'm going to use it like a
[1:47:36] woman
[1:47:42] that shows she's living a lie same thing
[1:47:52] with a man I keep going I get to go in
[1:48:00] the bathroom with the other girls and
[1:48:03] then he gets in there and he's looking
[1:48:05] for a stand up stall Wow cuz his mind
[1:48:11] didn't change the reality of who he is

[2:14:49] technical radios I remember one time
[2:14:53] yeah oh

[2:16:17] hear today you've been in these meetings
[2:16:19] these kind of meetings before or even in
[2:16:21] your church the reason why you're not
[2:16:23] saved is because a devil hung over you
[2:16:31] coat it if you walk out of here and you
[2:16:35] don't feel the persons of God in your
[2:16:37] life there's a demon give up
[2:16:53] give up to say lord help me cuz I can't
[2:16:58] help myself

[2:17:09] and that hovered over you and kept you
[2:17:12] hanging and kept hanging over you you
[2:17:14] wanted to do right
[2:17:17] you wanted to do right there's not a man
[2:17:21] that's got his right mind but what wants
[2:17:25] to do right but there is something won't
[2:17:28] let you do right is that right the
[2:17:31] congregation says that's the devil
[2:17:37] [Applause]
[2:17:39] Christ paid your healing and your
[2:17:44] salvation
[2:17:45] [Applause]
[2:18:01] come on magician something too close

[2:18:08] to say if you're here and you feel like
[2:18:12] you got struggles with distance
[2:18:13] struggles with that and and all these
[2:18:15] things going on let me tell you
[2:18:17] something God purposely gave me this

[2:19:15] house is garnished and swept and clean
[2:19:19] and the unclean spirit is cast out he
[2:19:22] says that spirit earlier goes through
[2:19:26] Dry places seeking rest so the devil is
[2:19:31] no good without a house
[2:19:58] once you make that confession that demon
[2:20:01] has to leave has to leave once you make

[2:20:16] say Lord I invite you into my life your
[2:20:23] house is no good empty cause the devil
[2:20:28] are go seeking dry places you go seeking
[2:20:32] places holy areas in your life that
