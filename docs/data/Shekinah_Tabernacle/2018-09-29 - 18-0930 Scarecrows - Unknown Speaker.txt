here this morning I mean if you have you've got your Bibles that's turn to numbers 13 and I think this is giving up the ghost so someone's gonna have to drive numbers 13 and verse 25 and I want to let's just read the scripture them all numbers 13 in verses 25 down to verse 33 this is this this is the 12 spies coming back they have spent 40 days searching out the land and here they are there come to give their report it says and they returned from searching of the land after 40 days and they went and came to Moses and to Aaron and to all the congregation of the children of Israel unto the wilderness of Paran to Kadish and brought back word unto them and unto all the congregation and showed them the fruit of the land and they told him and said we came and the land whither thou sent us send us us and surely it floweth with milk and honey and there is and this is the fruit of it that's go next slide up again nevertheless the people be strong that dwell in the land and the cities are walled and very great and we're over we saw the children of anak there the Amalekites dwell in the land of the south and the Hittites of the Jebusites and the emirates dwell in the mountains and the Canaanites dwell by the sea and by the coast of Jordan and caleb still the people before Moses said let us go up at once and possess it for we are able to overcome it Nix Nix lye please but the men that went up with him said we are not able to go up against the people for they are stronger than we and they brought up an evil report of the land which they had searched unto the children of Israel saying the land though through which we have gone to search it it is a land that eateth up the inhabitants thereof and all the people that we saw in it are men of great stature and there we saw the Giants the sons of anak which came of the Giants and we were in our own sight as grasshoppers and so we were in their sight Amen Lord bless us would you may have your seats this morning I want to I want to speak about scarecrows this is my topic today his scarecrows now we from this reading we see that the you know there were people in the land God told Abraham they would be in the land so it wasn't a surprise when yeah and so you know they weren't surprised that they that that the people were there God told them they would be there now the devil I'm just going to say this the devil will do everything he can to stop you possessing your inheritance in Christ he will stop you at every chance and our position as Christ is our position in the Word of God as the Bride of Christ as joint heirs with Christ as manifesting the full Word of God for this hour that is our inheritance the bride does not manifest just part of the word like in past ages but now the full Word of God is open and the very life that's in that word all the word is is manifested in a multi-member brave I mean so we're not called just to manifest part of Jesus or a little bit of him but the whole everything he is we become by his word when it comes into us and he anoints that word so everything that is in him belongs to the Bride of Christ and not just a part of things we're not just called just to look at it from afar off and say it's wonderful one day maybe I'll become like him maybe one day I'll possess all things no now is the day now is the hour where the bride is not just looking over Jordan saying one day no we're in the promised land right we're called to go and and possess our land but the devil will stop us from possessing the land now I'll just say this the people that the spy saw they were scarecrows they just in the field to scare off people they weren't the true inhabitants of the land the land and belonged to them they were just squatters they were just they were just living there the children of Israel because of an evil report because they saw these people in the land they brought an evil report they will more worried about the squatters that's who the inhabitants were then The Vindicator promise of God that the land belong to them they were more worried about what they saw with their eyes than what the word said that was theirs right so they shrunk back because of what they saw we should press forward because what we believe right we shouldn't shrink back now I'm going to call these so I'm going to call these people in land did your scarecrows there's a lot of scarecrows around the truth and their scarecrows that will pretend to be like the truth and there'll be scarecrows that will keep you away from even walking with the truth so we've got to forget the scarecrows right who cares about what other people say about it what has God given you to possess right so now a scarecrow is defined I actually went on the internet to to see what the definition of scarecrow was and it's an object made to resemble a human figure it's the setup to scare birds away from the field where the crops are growing it's also an object of baseless fear it's another definition so it's an object that is of baseless fear has no real you know the fears just baseless is no actual substance behind it it's just a mimic it's just a bluff or the devil's one big shadow he's just one big share at all is he's nothing but a bluff hello Jesus stripped him of all power Calvary and he's just a bluff and you were going to call his bluff you know when he comes you tries to horn you into his boot you just say boohoo where's the punchline I don't get it your hallelujah don't worry about the Scarecrow everything in the message belongs to me when God said there will be a bride that sinless virtuous maintenance image Brill tup to the full stature of Christ she is him I say that's my inheritance that's my portion that His Word will make me into his image I say yay Lord as for me in my house that's how Porsche so I'm going to go in and get what belongs to me hallelujah we don't want to just shrink back this message is more than just healing Amen or miracles it's a powerful with transforming word to make a people into the very image of Jesus Christ I mean that's what this message was sent for was to call you that you'd become one with the word I mean that every pilot would and you would say yeah they meant that you don't question it you know you're not worried by it doesn't matter what it may appear to be you say yes Lord I will be identified with the revealed son of man in the cellar I mean which is the word revealed hallelujahs is an object of baseless fear the people of those in those land was an object of baseless fear because God said he's the land God said I'll give you the land you go fight for it but it's yours hallelujah and the thing is so they were moring worried about the Scarecrow's thing God's promise for them and because the promise was not mixed with faith as the Apostle Paul says in Hebrews three and four they did not enter in because of unbelief they were called out people they became the church when they are in the wilderness because your church was called out right they were the Church of God but they weren't in their inheritance right that and the reason is they failed to see the value of the promised land they failed to see the true value and we've got to relook at what is the true value of becoming one with the word the true value of God manifesting in our lives the true value of eternal life it's very easy to say I have eternal life but do you see the true value of it I mean when the when God has loosed the seals of the book of redemption opened it for us giving it to our hand do we see the true value of the open word hallelujah you know denomination always comes in in the past that people form a group and they stay there we're not called just to camp down and stay we're called to possess all things so they fail to see the value of the promised land now the true value of the promised land wasn't that it was just flowing with milk and honey it wasn't just because it was a very nice place where they had vineyards and different things there wasn't the true value of the of the promised land the true value of the promised land was the resurrection there was a true value Abraham Sarah Isaac all they you know all the paid those ones they were buried in that land Abraham bought a parcel of ground from the sons of Heth to bury his bride in that place and he was buried in that place and Isaac was buried in that place and Jacob told Joseph when we're now down in Egypt don't bury me in Egypt swear that you'll take my body and bury me in the promised land now naturally you think well a would be a far greater place to be buried you have a big monument you can have all you know people will remember you and look at this pyramid him whatever more and you know but there is no value in there there is no value in Egypt there was only value of being buried in the promised land and Joseph told told told the children of Israel that when God visits you to take you from this land and take you back to the promised land you take my bones with you do not leave me in this place hallelujah and so why was that why wasn't a - good enough place to be buried they had their religion they had their temples they had their faith you know but the promised land was the only place where resurrection was going to come forth right and that's why they saw the true value of being buried in their land because they knew the resurrection was coming out of that land hallelujah it says in Matthew 27 when Jesus arose many of their Saint arose with them hallelujah so that's why they saw they saw the true value of the promised land and they and they said bury me in that place and it's the same thing with you and I don't bury me in a church don't bury me in a religion I wanna be buried in Christ if my life is dead and my oh I'm dead of my life is hid in Christ with God all come forth but if I'm just here with man's ideas and what I think in my opinion you'll die and you'll stay dead that's Egypt don't stay in Egypt don't stay in the wilderness well I felt a pull off out to be called out Here I am don't stay in the wilderness they had miracles in the wilderness God fed them God fought their battles they had tremendous things happen but there was still outside the land we don't want to just stay outside the land we want to be in and so the true believers like Caleb he saw the true valley of the promised land he was not willing to die in the wilderness he didn't want to stay in Egypt he was not willing just to come out halfway he wanted to go all in the way he wanted to go in all the way rather hallelujah because he knew the spiritual ones saw the true value of the land and that's why they took it they would not settle for anything less and it must be the same thing with you and I Amen sure the desert may have some kind of nice things to it I don't want to live in a desert I don't want to live on the other side of Jordan I want to be in in the lane and I don't just want to cross the river I want to take the whole thing take the whole word you're the devil will try and keep you from every promise he will fight you yeah yeah you've got to visit contest between God and Satan well how do you fall into that then which one do you believe as what is the one that'll win in your life right so there is our promised land today is entering into rest which is truly receiving the Holy Ghost really meeting the Lord for yourself Paul speaks about Hebrews three and four they didn't enter into rest he says there is a rest for the children of God right it's not keeping a day it's the Lord dwelling in you that's the true Sabbath the true rest now don't be alarmed by scarecrows a scarecrow is a mimic of the farmer in the field so it looks and the bit of the Scarecrow the more it will scare right if you just put a like I know you just you just put the guitar you just you just get a guitar and you put it in the field you say that's my scarecrow it's not going to scare any birds this is you and sit there right and you know you just you just draw someone in a but a cow ball put it there doesn't move it's not going to scare many birds but if you put some on those ass-kicker that's so lifelike that has some movement that appears to be like the real you're going to scare a lot of birds because they're getting skinned and you have people scarecrows living saying they're in the land quoting the open word living so much like the truth quoting the scripture and the and the quotes you know and and they look very much like they're genuine but they don't have the life but they're scarecrows and that's what the devil always puts in front of people they yeah he puts the puts the copy and he tries to get you look at the Scarecrow this is what it produces and ass-kiss some people - you shouldn't be scared of them don't worry about what you know what is it to thee follow thou me that's what Jesus he does disciples what is it to you about this and this and this who cares about this and that follow thou me what is it to thee right so we shouldn't be alarmed that there cuz God told Moses God told Abraham they'd be there and they found them right and so we shouldn't be surprised scarecrows are in the land because scarecrows will be in the land but don't worry about the scarecrows there's the food there's the resurrection there's eternal life is an open word to become one worth so scarecrows are designed to keep crows and other birds animals from where the fooders the more valuable the crop the bit of the Scarecrow right the more valuable so the more like the genuine a scarecrow is is the most effective to keep people away we shouldn't be worried about scarecrows there yo a scarecrow and the message can cause a lot of the message but there's no life right it can look like the genuine but don't worry about them they said they'd be there now do we have we have batteries how we doing we go the next next slide that's fine now I was reading this a while ago and it really struck me certain no we can't just take we can't take the world or our religion or our culture or preconceived ideas into the Promised Land we can't a lot of people tried to bring Pentecost into the open word you can't you you can't do it you can't bring the Pentecostal move into where the son of man is revealing himself I mean if you have the son of man you have Pentecost right we are Pentecostal people by experience not by organization but by experience that the same God that came down the day of Pentecost comes down now right because if you have the true Living Word I mean you have a Pentecost and then and we've been turned back to original Pentecost right God dwelling in his people once again now but look at this this is not that long after the day of Pentecost and certain men which came down from Judea taught the Brethren and said except ye be circumcised after the manner of Moses you cannot be safe but when Paul and Barnabas wait so have we jumped ahead what 1 2 6 no you were good but when when therefore Paul and Barnabas had no small dissension and and disputation were they made terming that Paul and Barnabas and certain others of them they should go up to Jerusalem unto the Apostles and elders about this question and being bought on their way by the church they passed through a fence and Samaria declaring the conversion of the Gentiles and they caused great joy unto all the brethren oak we go next one and when they will come to Jerusalem they were received of the church and of the Apostles and elders and they declared all things that God had done with them but there arose up certain of the sect of the Pharisees which believed saying that it was needful to circumcise them and to command them to keep the law of Moses and the Apostles and elders came together for to consider this matter to me this is one of a you know this is this is almost ridiculous the Pharisees killed Jesus and now these are sick is an offshoot of the Pharisee movement that's come to believe he's the Messiah but you see the problem as they were still Pharisees they were still they were still living something that was from a past age and they're trying to bring it into the present truth you can't bring something of the past into the present truth because you'll be like this you'll be a Pharisee you'll be an actor who's trying to bring the past into the present you cannot do that right every you know and so there are sick to the Pharisees which believed but you can see they didn't really believe because they are trying to get the people to become you know to be circumcised for the law before they became believers and so they're trying to bring the past into the present now this they had brought this they had brought their old walk of their old faith into a new and living way and mix the two together it didn't produce the life of Pentecost it didn't produce the life of the word and the people right so they were they were stuck this way and it's amazing that the that the that the believers actually spent time with these ones they're trying to bring the past and whether you say hold on no we're with the new and living way we don't have to keep the law of Moses anymore the when God comes and dwells in your soul though the law is fulfilled he he fulfills his own law right we don't have to keep a physical ordinance he lives it ain't meant just like sanctification God sanctifies the believer right you have to give you a will over to him completely and then he sanctifies you then he transforms you then he changes you it means it's the same thing today people try and bring their religious ideas so what I'm basically doing is I'm showing both types of scarecrow okay because there's those that we have we have life okay I'm showing both kinds because there's the ones pretending to be in the land and they're not in the land they're just squatters they're not part of the land and there's the others who try and pull us back into the past there's two times right so I'm just as I'm showing both okay and so now these people are still alive today it's always the devil's job to try and bring people back into what has been right and if he can't pull you back into what has been he'll push you too far into the future right and people try and run ahead of the pillar of fire instead of waiting for God to unfold his word and walk with them they try and go ahead because man man gets pride and they want to have something special and something different so they take quotes and courts and courts and quotes and then they find the conclusion they end with is very different to what the Prophet said but they trying to be Kingdom builders trying to establish themselves upon the earth or something special what's happened they're actually just scarecrows because you'll find that kind of way it doesn't produce the life of the message right okay so now brother Bram says this and deceive Church by the world it's a good message to go listen to he says all knowledge oh well we know all about it and some of them doesn't know the first alphabet of the Holy Spirit they deny it it reminds me of a little book I read one day in California about ten years ago I picked up from an old bookstore he says it sounded like it was just a 10-cent book had some but it had some good seats to it it seemed jokey and cunningly but I found something in there that sounded like God to me and some of them little story started out with us one morning a great and a great chicken pen there's certain little rooster that thought he had all the knowledge and there was to be known so he flies up onto a box beat his bill but against the box four or five times throws back his little head crowed like he'd never heard a rooster crow and the others he attracted their attention said ladies and gentlemen of his chicken pen I'd like to speak to you this morning on some great educational program we have just been designed I said I have I have required a lot of knowledge of my studying as he pulled on his little glasses over as Billy said I have decided that we chickens can better ourselves by more knowledge therefore I can tell you that we're that we will dig and work in a certain pin or hole we'll find a certain vitamin that can make us crow better prettier feathers and I can tell you how we are even better ourselves in many different ways and the little pellets and then with the little road of little red combs they just cackle this head isn't here darling and they certainly admired him oh he was just such a brilliant rooster reminds me some of these seminary preachers such a brilliant man there's no need of us hanging around with the rest of the chickens we all ought to go with him well before the little fellow had got a speech finished there was another little chicken that didn't have such bright feathers came running in from the rest of the chicken yard he said boys wait a minute I've just heard the latest bulletin on the radio the chickens went out for seats on the pandrol going to the slaughter tomorrow what good is your knowledge going to do brother all the knowledge we can accumulate what good does it do we're six foot of dirt we're all dying by inches and by minutes our knowledge means nothing we want to know him but they do that what they learn about other stuff that doesn't really matter as I was remarking some time ago about a little canary he thought he had all the knowledge that that had been known he knowed so much that he could tell all the rest of the Canaries about human beings so he flies up on his cage begins to speak about the human being I'm how he knowed all about them then all of a sudden a professor from Purdue walked up and began to speak some high polish words to him and the little fellow batted his eyes and turned his head and he had eyes he could see the professor he had ears he could hear him but of course he didn't know what he was talking about why he was just a canary brain he was just a bird brain that's all he's got he wasn't got a human brain so he can't think like human beings and neither can a human being think like God where he and all the worldly knowledge is no more than a canary brain all you do you just hurt yourself with it we have got to have the mind of Christ he says that's the reason people go and join organizations and substitute a handshake instead of the new birth they're trying to bypass the new birth they don't want the new birth and they they know we teach it in the Bible so they want to substitute something for it and the Pentecostal people are just as bad trying to substitute something they wanted in class it must be so classy we'll shake hands or join the church and be or be sprinkled and baptized or something they're afraid of the new birth he says sometimes I believe that Branum tabernacle is getting afraid of it well we all know that a birth I don't care where it is what it is we're about to to miss if a baby's born on a shock pile on a hard floor or pink decorated hospital room it's a mess anyhow a birth of a calf birth of anything else is a mess and the new birth is nothing less than a mess but people are so starchy we'll go over there and they shake hands we'll go over there they don't ball and cry and beat on the old and cry out we want too much we want too much to be human but what we need is a birth of dying out that brings forth life a seed an old potato a seed potato you take that potato and you put it in the ground until you have new potatoes that a potato has to rot our corn cannot produce new life until it's rotten and a man or a woman has never had the new birth until the intellectuals their old self is rot and dead died out at the altar scream get all messed up to a place the starch gets out of your collar and you are born again by the Spirit of God I don't care if you squeal speaking tongues jump up and down flop like a chicken with its head cut off you're bringing forth your life but we have substituted something for it we want the classical way sure amen there's got to be a reality you know we are not here just to learn things right well talk about the opening the word is not intellectual idea or something new that we can learn and acquire knowledge and talk about which excites us for a season as Jesus Christ revealing himself it's the son of man making himself known right but in order to really see him you must be born again I mean unless you're born again you cannot see the kingdom it doesn't make sense you cannot understand it right so but the Scarecrow's will keep us away of a new birth because reasonable comin sometimes we can be the worst scarecrow by our own human reasoning because nothing likes to die hallelujah I mean I believe in a real religion a real walk with God with God really meet you when they're in the upper room they didn't say well I guess we've been here long enough it's the day of Pentecost that sounds good to us you know let's just walk out no they really met God they were really changed they were transform they didn't just have like a camp experience and go out now they were changed they were transformed I'm in the very God that they walk was was now in them hallelujah now we know that the what have I done we driving I got I got a laser anyway revelation 6 1 & 2 let's go there let's do it the old-fashioned way who's got their Bibles we know that the today the pale horse rider is riding he's a mixture of the first three and so when we read about the first horse rider we know that the same power of deception is still riding it's still here is it Peter Scarecrow the devil's a scarecrow but he'll try the devil haunts he tries to grip you tries to scare you he tries to intimidate you don't be intimidated don't be scared don't be haunted you're a son or daughter of God he's you've been redeemed by the blood this message you know why this message is quickened to your soul because you have an eternal body in the heavens I mean though this earthly tabernacle be dissolved I have one eternal in the heavens waiting for me and the very reason that God spoke this word and quicken it to you is because you have a body I mean that this message is here to align you with your theophany that's why you be made alive that's why it's quicken you to this word it's because you have a body in the heavens already so if you have that body who cares about intimidation who cares what the devil can do who cares what the enemy can try and put down your throat the kids about it I've got a body that I will step into hallelujah so he's a pig bluff he's nothing but a bluff who cares about him I could cease to be but you don't be hallelujah all being a far greater state than standing here this morning hallelujah and the very reason God comes and quickens is word to your soul is because he's trying to get your attention you have a body I mean when this life is no more you shall be holy the devil has an expiry date and all of his works and they'll come to an end and they won't be remembered but yet you will still be hallelujah that's what this message has come to do align you with your theophany you know there's a it's like a natural you know we are growing into the image of God like a baby in the mother's womb cravings come you know sometimes they can be crazy but there's something in that food that the mother eats of them that the baby is calling for right it's the same thing with you there's something in you you may not even understand it but you're calling for a certain vitamin of the word because you need to grow to the full stature and then God will inspire a minister you hear a message and it will and something wanker in your soul because your body's saying I needed that I needed that Allu you so what why should we fear that's why Paul could just walk the way he did nothing moves me I've been shipwrecked I've been beaten I've been betrayed by by false brethren I've been what ever more he says none of these things move me but we're gonna cut your head off in the morning Paul I've got a crown of life hallelujah waiting waiting for me though this earthly tabernacle be dissolved I've won in Waiting eternal in the heavens he didn't worry was so real to him he's caught pass the curtain of time hallelujah you know eternity comes grips you hallelujah an eternal word came from your eternal home I mean to speak to you that it would get a hold of you that you would understand you're not a creature of time right you're just passing through brother I'm serious like eternity is like a big circle and time is just like a hickey on the side right because of sin but then one day soon we'll be done and we'll go back into eternity again and we came from eternity and we go back to eternity I mean yeah they pray you've got a revelation I came from God and I go back to him I was in his thoughts I become manifest and then I'm going to go back into heaven Allu yeah but everything else is Scarecrow's what do we say what are we gripped by people can be so impacted by things in their life what about being impacted by Jesus Christ he's never done anything bad amen you take the word of God that's never done anything bad to me amen he saved me he redeemed me he washes me he keeps me he cleanses me he makes me holy comfort me he guides me he gives me joy speakable full of glory he shows me where I'm going is any of that bad so why don't we just get so gripped by this word so gripped that everything else in our life is just out of that because we're being being consumed being gripped by a word don't let the devil distract you he will distract you to keep you away from the promise he will distract you with this world to choke out the Word of God in your life get us caught caught up in things here's some social media Alleluia amen what about Facebook what about this book what are the message I want to I don't want to become like social media they position their photos make everything fake you know it's not reality and people lap it up and they try and live in some imagination that's not even real that's why Hollywood and all the things in the world it's not even reality but yet the devil tries to put it down your throat saying this is what you need to become to be successful in this world and then you just tilt the camera out of the frame that he's telling you and you see broken lives and suicide and and drug abuse and all kinds of things and in rehab out of rehab and all this broken-down and stuff well why doesn't the devil show you that because that's what it produces right and he doesn't want and then and then he points you at things oh look at what happened to these people and these people in the message these people it's the same anointing that was bare like the king of Moab took Balaam around to the back parts of Israel and Israel was doing all kinds of wickedness all kinds of things and and the king of mob said surely if Balaam sees the back parts he'll curse them and then when the Spirit of God comes upon Balaam God's speaking now I see no Nik worry and jacob hallelujah but you'd say well naturally they'll do this and this and this failure and this thing in this thing that God sees R&C iniquity of my people they're walking with the pillar of fire to the promised land holy but the devil won't point you you know do you think bellick was saying now Balaam you see the pull or fire there you see this moon rock you see you see the brass serpent they have you see the word of promise they received from Sinai you see how do you think he would never have pointed those things out the devil never points out the true value of what's there Amen he wants you to see the false they are not the true value so I saw when the lamb opened one of the seals and I heard as it were the noise of thunder one of the four beasts saying come and see you know I saw behold a white horse and he that sat on him had a bow and a crown was given unto him and he went forth conquering and to conquer now we know that this is the Antichrist spirit in the first age because when you read revelations 19 there's another white horse rider and he's a sharp two-edged it's all coming out of his mouth he's called the Word of God his his vicious dipped in blood he's got many crowns that's not this guy right when in Revelations 19 is Christ riding forth to conquer this is a deception right because he has a bow and he has no arrows you'll never sword right so he's just waving around a weapon it's like carrying around again with no bullets trying to intimidate people this this power is still riding today right but he tries to come in as as it says in Daniel 11 it says and in his estate shall stand up a vile person to whom they shall not give honor of the kingdom but he shall come in peaceably and obtain the kingdom by flatteries so he'll come in because of personal advantage and try and take the kingdom by flatteries and it was in the first stage was the deed of the Nicolaitans which jesus said he hated right so they were believers that were there in the framework of Christianity but the head D and those deeds are just saying send euros nothing in concrete nothing on paper it's just a deed but we do it this way we do it that way this is just how you know and the purpose of that deed was to conquer the people and how you conquer the people's you take away a genuine union between God and man where God comes and lives in them right that's how you conquer them by taking the power of God away from their lives now so it's the same thing today it comes in today it comes in today don't worry we go back I was trying to blank it actually that's why it comes in today and says just get baptized and say you believe God then you're saved that's what that's what this spirit comes in it says and everything else doesn't pertain to salvation so it doesn't matter amen that's what it's it that's what this one D that's what the devil says just come and say you believe join the church get baptized you have salvation everything else doesn't pertain to salvation so what's happening is that the devil always tries to move the word out of its importance explains it away see that it's not important that but doesn't matter this but well historical and accuracy and mistranslation and don't trust listen it's trying to take the Word of God and dilute it in your mind that it's not important anymore but man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceeds out of the mouth of God Moses said it Jesus said it and then Jonathan says if you add or take away your name we'll be taking on the book of life right and we know in order to take the - you know take away from the word you don't have to delete it out of your Bible you just say it's not important that's taking away the same things being done today they kill the influence this is from the cedar discrepancy you want to hear message go listen to the cedar discrepancy anything that does not manifest the promise word of the arrows discrepancy it's a tear right it's not true anything can be so close like Judas was so close but here's discrepancy right here's a cedar discrepancy and says now same thing they've done today they killed the influence they say oh that bunch of holy rollers is nothing to them and why it's discrepancy meet the Word of God face to face and see what it is see if God interpreters would his own Word God's able of these stones to rise up to Abraham Amen the word had been thoroughly vindicated by them early Christians how God delivered them from everything in disease they had prophets they spoke in tongues interpreter gave messages that's proved to be exactly the truth every time but in the face of all that vindicated word the people voted it out and voted a denomination that's the mother of all organization both are fully matured now they started seeding again it died out but it bloomed again in the days of Luther as we know in the form of message hearing though it bloomed out and that they have Luther now what do they do immediately after that great man died they made an organization that bloomed out again in the days of John Wesley when them Anglicans with all their eternal securities and everything had it bound up into a place there's almost universalism well I think that means gods and everyone basically and what's happened God raised up a man named John Wesley Slade the whole thing and as soon as he died her man s brewery and then what happened they organized and they've got all kinds of Methodist think come along one or the other Alexander Campbell John Smith what more finally broke out Pentecost coming out coming out of all of it what happened then they did run well what did hinder you they went right back into the same mud you came out of right back into the same slop went back to discrepancy and made organizations they had to compromise on the word that's wise the first thing that has to happen and every time God would send something new they couldn't receive a nurse right discrepancy again and notice as I said the other day their first little husk that came forth from this root comes up into the leaves and up into the tussle back again into the stalk again it comes out that little husk of wheat almost looks like the grain itself and we thought it was but when you open it up there's no grain there at all it's only a supporter of the grain to grow by and it dies also and the life goes right out of it and goes into the grain my brother Graham said Pentecostal move was a good shook but just protected the grain but now the grains here hallelujah Amen you know he says in second corinthians i'm just going to go through this it doesn't pertain to salvation a little bit second Corinthians six seventeen and eighteen I don't have it on there since wherefore come out from among them and be separate saith the Lord touch not the unclean thing and I will receive you and be a father unto you you shall be my sons and daughters saith the Lord Almighty so there's the call come out from among them be separate touching not the unclean thing over there pertain no it doesn't pertain to salvation touchy not the unclean thing right you can't join yourself with idols or things of the world some kind of discrepancy you you've got to let it go you will if you see the true value of eternal life if you see the true value of the message you will cleave unto him hallelujah 1st Thessalonians 4 and we know we love to quote the rapture section of the of first Thessalonians 400 into 5 but the first part of her first Thessalonians 4 says furthermore we beseech you brethren and exhort you by the lord jesus that as ye have received of us how you ought to walk and to please God they are instructed how to please God and how to walk hallelujah amen oh yes amen you see but people say no it doesn't pertain to salvation it doesn't matter what's happened no that's just that white horse rider with a deception coming in and people agree with it because it panders to the flesh instead of walking after the spirit right we don't want to pander to the flesh we want to agree with God's Word if the spirit on you doesn't agree with God's Word you get another spirit because that spirit is Antichrist amen furthermore and he says and we know for ye know what Commandments we gave you by the Lord Jesus for this is the will of God even your sanctification that you should abstain from fornication that every one of you should know how to how to possess his vessel in sanctification and honor not in the lust of concupiscence even in it and that's just longings to things that are things that are forbidden says longing after things I wish I could have that I wish I could have that well the reason people long after things which mentally they know is wrong is because their nature has not been changed right they're still logging after just like the Childress or they came out of Egypt oh we won the garlic's and the league's of Egypt but they forgot their in slavery they were beaten their children were being killed right they were just tools and Pharaohs hands they weren't a free people all but I long after those things the devil will try and you know I'm going all the way I burned every Bridge you won't even find the foundation of the bridge I don't even know where it was I'm not looking I'm not looking for I came from all they know we're drowned hallelujah the enemy's been drowned sometimes it's nice to see a photo of him did say yet say can this happen to you take a selfie whatever you are don't know but you've got to remind the devil you died I'm dead too you can't kill me I'm already dead hallelujah I'm what you can't kill a dead man a man I like that now even as the Gentiles which know not of God now we have to have a testimony that we have to have a life produced that proves our testimony is right right by their fruits you shall know them this is again and deceived Church by the world he says today they say come join the church put your name on the book or bow down and say I confess Christ as the Son of God and get up this basis I just say a sinner's prayer repeat after me and now you're saved you're saved because the Spirit of God moves upon you writes the goodness of God that leads to repentance I mean that's why you've got to if you're sitting here and say well I don't really see why they're excited I want to go and do other things you say our God may your goodness come upon me it will be worth it to call upon him hallelujah today they say come join the church bow down as I confess Christ as the Son of God get up the devil did the same thing certainly the devil was baptized when Judas was baptized member here's the son of perdition the devil went out and preached the gospel when Judas went out and preach the gospel but the devil didn't get the Holy Ghost I mean that's it that's where the hidden powers at that resurrection that no positive beyond a shadow of a doubt amen he's here that same Holy Ghost the one that was on the Messiah still on his church he never leaves I'll be with you always even in you to the end of the world I'll be there the works I do shall you do also more than this show you do because they go to my father but the world compromises it are those days are past but what the devil wants just what the devil wants you to do that's what the devil comes in the miracles didn't really happen in the prophets of ministry it was just all manufactured he tries to explain it away those days are different we don't need God to vindicate his word anymore cuz churches are everywhere and you know what a bunch of hogwash what a bunch of nonsense I mean if God is not here if Jesus Christ is not here to be met what's the point right what's the point I'm in a feast it'll be with you even any to the end of the world you either will be a reason layer and throw it all the way I'm contending he's here to be met to to transform you hallelujah he's either real or he's not I think it's really that simple really at the end of they boil it down these are the true or false as he turned he's true how'd he know his true I met him he changed my life hallelujah and I there's nothing to go back to hallelujah well why go back to the Pigpen why go back to the slave pit well go back make bricks for Pharaoh amen and let him come and kill children do whatever more he wants to do why why go back to the slave pit when I have a resurrection in the promised land why go back to the world there's nothing there there's nothing a man's religion what what good will it do you Amen Alleluia are those days are past just what the devil wants you to do they want you to glamorize God wants you baptized God wants you to say oh I don't believe all the earth that's carrying on go ahead and live go and live in your sin live in your sin but until you rot till you rot to your own ideas to you rock to your old fashions and be regenerated again and born again that new life be altogether different from the one that went down hallelujah I went down a very different person I am today hallelujah very different not the same not polished up not reformed very different transform hallelujah Trust is the same with you one day you say God got ahold of me his word became a living reality the message became a living reality more than just taped some books and quotes in the Bible became a living reality that's what it has to be that's what we're going to rejoice in God look at the Scarecrow all this to this this person of this who cares about what they do what's he done to you hallelujah what has he done in your life what's the word done to you you got to keep focused on that hallelujah amen a corner of a grain of corn goes down yellow comes up green goes down hard case turn comes up flexible you take a seat hard removal goes dies and rots comes up green holy can really worship the Sun hallelujah it's made to absorb the sunlight holy that I can grow more hallelujah so I'd like to see a green tree well lujah worshiping God for the green leaves those leaves are made we have a science lesson those those leaves are made to absorb the sunlight I'll leave that it can grow push out I mean that's why we're going to stay green stay flexible polio weather where the Sun Rise come down you're built to absorb the word you're built to absorb the sunlight Amen again grown been grown to his image Alleluia isn't that right exactly you'll be like a tree planted by the water I shall not be moved I like my place glory Alleluia but the little blades flexes and rejoices and grows in strengthens itself it can never become a blade until the corners did rot and only did but rotten can't come back no more but the life goes out of it as I said a while ago birth is a horrible thing filthy duty the filthiest of filth but their life lace hallelujah that's the most of you see the true value of a birth hallelujah Amen when you reckon yourself filthy rich can your Methodist Baptist Pentecostal creats filthy diode at the altar then your then the new life comes and the Holy Ghost makes you and above that you see God hallelujah these signs shall follow them the bleed is a reality we don't just talk about him he lives we don't just learn about him we know him hello as I said last Sunday I'm just going to repeat it again I just don't know about my wife I know her we're married we live in the same house we go through the same things I know her hard I know you know how she is I haven't just read books the life and times with Christine and then I've seen the movie I've heard the musical yeah I know no no I am married to her hallelujah we don't learn about Jesus it's not learning about Jesus as he's not some idea don't let the devil put God as some concept degrade him to some concept he's a Living God he's the Messiah Zachary raise your Redeemer hallelujah your blood is your sacrifice is your grace I mean he's your covering is your glory hallelujah isn't he wonderful isn't he glorious isn't he tremendous how is he worth it all can he see the true value he didn't look like anything great to the world but in him was eternal life he was the resurrection the life hallelujah and those who are ordained could look past the veil and see eternal life holy just like the message that that may no look so pretty but in there's eternal life hallelujah if you're a danger see you can't help but seeing it I mean you're kneel to begin with I mean you must see it hallelujah how can the Holy spirt denies own word the author cannot done cannot deny zone word it's impossible so if the Spirit of God isn't if the spirit that wrote the Bible is in you you cannot deny the scripture you cannot dilute it you cannot explain it away you say this is God's Word right you cannot it's the same thing with the message because the the one who wrote the Bible spoke the message right and it's the same God now the Apostle Paul this is why I was quite are we back on it's normally it's like pilots it's normally pilot error early go can you go next one there we go I love this the Apostle Paul was not interested in people just becoming church people he said my little children whom I travail in birth again until Christ be formed in you I desire to be present with you now and to change our voice for I standing down to you but it was his burden he wasn't satisfied until that same pillar of fire that he met on the road to Damascus dwelt in his convert Holly the same God he met throughout this way he travails and birth until Christ be formed in them hallelujah should be the same thing with us I mean you really meet God nothing can explain him away no atheists note no religion nothing of the world can explain them away because you met him it goes beyond someone else's testimony becomes your testimony he becomes your testimony Allu you this is from the state of the scriptures fulfilled Moses we know was a man called of God a prophet while he was being called being a prophet he had to have a supernatural experience in order to be a prophet he had to meet God face to face and talk with him and another thing what he said had to come to pass or no one would have believed him so no man has a right to call himself thus until he's talked face-to-face with God on the backside the desert somewhere where he met God himself and all the atheists in the world could not explain it away from him he was there he knowed it happened every Christian should have that experience before they say anything about being a Christian your own experience and then we know God is not a cookie cutter but you'll be able to say this happened to me and this is the life that's made I mean because every of the Holy Ghost is in each one of us it will produce the same kind of life right it will produce a life of the word and one produced a church life or denomination life it will produce a life of the word and you can't help but it will just produce itself there's a life pushing out hallelujah this is in Christ a mystery God revealed but when Christ is identified and you identifying himself in you are a Christian you are christ-like which the word Christian me to be christ-like this is your identification right and now since here's our identification then we should be identified with him by living for him how loser when he comes at his word identifies himself in you right then you know because all health is against the revelation of man being breast into the kingdom of God and Jesus Christ revealing himself personally to you upon this rock I'll build my church jesus said to Peter the revelation of who Jesus Christ is in the season you live all hell is against that that's why the Scarecrow's will come just learn this just say this just conform to this now you're going to be built upon the rock of the revelation of the word in your hour hallelujah that is the rock that the church is built upon and it's only build upon men amen it isn't as your life worthy of the gospel if it's the word they sees here but there's once your thing you will do you'll be the fruit of the Spirit and the fruit of the Spirit is love joy peace faith long-suffering meekness gentleness patience your temper will not be oh just remember when you got that that poisons the Holy Spirit away from you see when you get to a place when you want to fuss with everybody you come along to these something wrong when you when you get to a place where a minister will read from the Bible that it's wrong to do certain certain thing you just remember there's no Christianity there at all if you bust up that's that's how by their fruits you shall know them that's what Jesus said see if it's the word and God said so that spirit in you will cope with the word every time because genuine Holy Spirit will cope with the word cuz the word has life and spirit Jesus hid my words of life and if you've got eternal life and here's the word how can you deny how can the word deny the word see what kind of a person could you make God that's one thing to know if you're a Christian when you fully agree upon every word of God Alleluia are we driving again now I read this last week but we he says therefore seeing we have this ministry if we have received mercy we faint not but every announced the hidden things of dishonesty not walking craftiness nor handling the word deceitfully but by manifestation of the truth commending ourselves to every man's conscience in the sight of God but if our gospel be hid its hid to them that are lost can we have the have the next one and whom the god of this world has blinded the minds of them that which believe not lest the light of the glorious gospel of Christ who is the image of God should shine unto them for we preach not ourselves but Christ Jesus the Lord and ourselves and ourselves your servants for Jesus sake for God who commanded the light to shine a darkness has shined in our hearts to give light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of of Jesus Christ we go next one please but we have this treasure in earthen vessels that excellency of the power may be of God and not of us we are troubled on every side yet not distressed we are perplexed and non despair persecuted but not forsaken cast down but not destroyed he says we have this treasure in earthen vessels he speaking about himself this treasure of eternal life this treasure of the very Creator who made all things that became our Redeemer now dwells in his church hallelujah the Word made flesh this is the treasure Paul didn't look like so much to the world but he hears that we have this treasure in earthen vessels that we would and we haven't handled the Word of God deceitfully to to to make it say one thing and make it say another but we have been a manifestation of the truth it has been clearly declared to you who we are and what we believe in the matter of life we have Amen and then so he's saying that we have this treasure in earthen vessel so this treasure of heaven this pearl of great price the Word of God is now hidden right we have this treasure in this earthen vessel amen so don't let the enemy ever try and try and diminish the treasure you have remember if he can push you won't can't push you one way try and push you the other way amen now the Christian experience is not something we manufacture right but it is a life pushing itself out brother Brown you know he he he uses the illustration a few times he speaks about when he's hunting and he and he goes to a stream that's bubbling and he takes a drink of this nice cold water he says now if I could speak to you mr. stream I'd say mr. stream why do you bubble is it because the rabbit hops long comes and drinks by you sees no that's not why I bubble is because mr. deer comes along and he has a drinking walks off is that why he publishes no he said well why why do you bubble like this what is it you know why you bubbling forth like this enjoy and Thanksgiving and he says he stand and if the stream could as he'd say there's something in me pushing out I can't help but bubbly something's a force behind me there's pushing the water through I mean it's making me bubble and it's the same thing with the Christian experience I mean it's not something we put on it's not something we manufacture but there's a life innocence pushing out I mean like the well of living water comes out of us hallelujah I mean it's because it's it's something within the worshiper when he's been identified with Christ because he knows that he is alive he don't want to become a tradition I mean when you really meet him you don't want to become a tradition and just settle down - this is how we do things not you want life to come forth you want a bubble you want your bubbling stream spreads out it doesn't just sit there like a stagnant pool it wants to gush out once the gush out to others to be a rocket a weary land I mean to give water to those who are thirsty hallelujah now Matthew 7 we go next one therefore all things whatsoever ye would that men should do to you do even to them for this is the law and the prophets into unit the straight gate for wide is the gate and broad us the way I'm talking about the Scarecrow if it doesn't pertain to you salvation talk about scarecrows right into unit the straight gate for wide is the gate and broad is the way that leadeth to destruction and many there are that will go in thereat because Strait is the gate and narrow is the way that leadeth unto life and few there be that find it so when people say it doesn't pertain to salvation that's the broad way that's not the narrow way that's just a broad way no don't worry just just just walk on as you feel led by your own heart the heart is deceitful man's heart is deceitful you can't trust your own leading you can only trust your own leading when you see it in God's word right because he is our God I just be true to yourself I don't want to be true to myself I want to be true to God's Word right because I want to be true to myself what am I going to become oh I just need to relax and I need to do this and you know pleasures of life whatever more that's not being true to yourself I mean I mean that is but you don't want to be true to yourself I'm just following my heart well who has the reigns of your heart who has the range does the word of God have the reigns just like a horse the horse is like your heart and then there's the driver on the coach has the reins who's driving your coach right whose truck is it the Word of God or is it or is it Satan because he'll take you down the Broadway you know a Broadway looks a lot nicer than a narrow way a narrow way I look at this word narrow in the Greek and it means it means a rut or a worn path yeah a rut is a very narrow narrow way a writer a worn path and it means actually the crowd like pushing pushing it there's no room there's a narrow way and it also means to afflict that means narrow to throng to suffer tribulation and trouble so Strait is the gate and suffer tribulation is the way or trouble will be the way or you know to be afflicted as the way it's not the easy way it's not the easy way or if it feels good do it now a hundred percent of time that's wrong because this body you know you're gonna have to drag this thing to a body change one day your body will thank you thank you you brought me here yet the drag that's like you to drag into church you got to brush his teeth you're going to feed the thing you've got to look after the thing watch the thing dress the thing you know you got to drag around Britain you got to make it pray you got to make it read you gonna make it listen no what would you rather you know humanely would you rather be on a dick chair on a beach somewhere sipping something fancy Oh would you rather be living everyday kind of life everyone if you're honest you'd say I'd be on the beach on holiday this thing only wants a holiday it only wants a holiday but that you got to keep the flesh subjection to the Word of God right because if you sit on a beach all day drinking fancy drinks you'll become lazy you'll become fat you'll probably die of a heart attack or something you know you have no character you have no character whatsoever the slightest huh you know waiter there's a breeze Oh move that class you know I that person taking my picture I can't stand this anymore begin there's no character that's what that's what this guy wants who are you pandering to I'm following my heart no I'm following God's Word hallelujah so narrow is the way so it's not a broad way it's a narrow way hallelujah and Strait is the gate we know straight there Str AIT means water repenting me baptized the name of Jesus Christ and to what are you baptized churches or him the word Jesus Christ so Strait is the gate and narrow is the way open doesn't pertain to salvation he's sure they sure because the first question should be Lord does this please you or does it not please you and if you're in a relationship he will tell you and if you really want to be in a relationship he'll tell you but if you have your mind made up actually that's this way and I'm just going to cover it with a religious veneer you just go on I don't want to be answered according to the idol of my heart God lines your prayer according to the idol of your heart the pins what they had idol is but if God's in there you have no Idol he's the idol as word as the idol hallelujah Amen an education can learn you or teach you mathematics can teach you history whatever more but cannot bring life to you your education will not do that God has one way of bringing light to you that's when you're ready to separate yourself from all things of the world and all the cares of the world and will cling only to God's promise right Paul was a Nazarite unto the Lord now we known as writers someone separated right he was separated from his Orthodox Church to the Word of the Living God Aaron was a Nazarite and the Lord he was separated from among the Brethren to bear the birthstones to be the high priest it was a total separation we're not to go back into the world no more or have anything to do with the world but cleave only to God Jesus is coming after a bride a woman a church that separated from the things of the world or the kids of the world she separated from the fashions of this modern age we live in she separate from the keys and the traditions of churches she's separated only to God and God is the word and as husband and wife as one so does the bride and the would become one for the woods living through the bride that's her credentials that's her identification hallelujah God calls for a total separation from unbelief and he does it you've got to give yourself to it all right I'm waiting for God to speak here it is are you looking for an answer it's like I'm waiting for a phone call when I turn off my cell phone they'll call any day now I'm waiting for it I'm not waiting for it I've turned off my phone I blocked the channel of communication I'll but I'm waiting from the call wherein the call me well have you turned yourself at all no why would I do that the same thing with people in God they block the communication they choke up anything you know they get so full of the world and and their affections and things on on the earth God can't speak amen but isn't it wonderful I'm glad you know I mean when the Lord was dealing with me I just got sick of the status quo of my life God was just stirring during the nest he doesn't want to leave you in that but you've got to respond otherwise I'll just get worse I just come easy this is the police come easy or come hard option one is always better howl ooh yeah now let's go back can we go back home brother Andy I'm just gonna read this it's from Christ to miss your God revealed we do you see the value the true value of becoming one with him the word is Christ I mean I mean our inheritance is in Jesus Christ the open word right don't worry about the Scarecrow's in there the glorious thing is to become one with that anointed word for your day now what is it the same word nothing can be added or taken from it so that same word moves from the head as it as the day comes closed down into the body down into the body vindicating that they are one now here's the head here's the word right so it comes down into the body vindicating that they are one holy this you want some vindication you see the word become flesh in you I mean that is that is your did there's the body vindicated I won they're husband and wife their flesh their flesh of his flesh word of his word lifers of his life spirit of a spirit see amen how do you know that be is the same record same fruit same word see manifest Christ same life same God same spirit same word same book Amen same science these things I do show you do also Oh hallelujah my notice the vindicated word in his body as his very victory and the reason of his death see the death not in the spirit when he died he only died in the flesh a spirit went to the went to hell and preached the souls in prison that's right can we go next one please brother Andy his flesh only died then he raised it up again and quickened quicken means made alive his flesh which is his body that's the word that's been laying dead for years but it gradually began to come in the and the Reformation now she's standing up on her feet oh I wish I had time to go back into Ezekiel and bring out them dry bones and show you he said can these bones live again he said prophesy how can prophesy come only through the Prophet it's the word of the Lord he hear ye ye dry bones the word of the Lord and in the last stage of Ezekiel's you know the mighty army coming forth was when Ezekiel prophesied over the bones and then life came in and they stood up as a mighty army holy as a living people once again and he said the only way that life can come is through the mouth of a prophet because that's God's that's God's mouthpiece to an H I'm it's a God has spoken a word in this age that life will come into the body I mean that life will come into the body I mean that the body and the head will be united as one I mean that's a vindication I mean you want to see proof Lord am i walking in the way you see his word living in you I mean that is the vindication you're part of the break because you're part of him hallelujah amen so it's when the prophet speaks the word that word is released and member if you take that as a natural place natural scene of a valley there were rocks in the valley there's maybe shrubs whatever more than that dry place but there are people right and when that word was spoken didn't make the rocks of life then make the trees and life it made the people of life so those people that were ordained those bodies are a dangerous seed that prophecy came to life hallelujah it's the same thing with you and I friend God has released his word on in this age and it's going to over the whole world and it's caused a lot of things to happen but it's after one thing the Bride of Christ to be quickened to be made alive hallelujah and God releases his life through the words I speak Jesus said they are spirit their life i immense it is life in the word that's why it's so vital don't worry about scarecrows people saying there's nothing total people saying it's this but it's not what they're saying it is don't worry about those things walk with Him the word will produce ya who's prepared ground who's prepared who's a prepared ground that means that when the seed comes in and the Holy Spirit waters that it will produce itself the life will produce itself you have confidence that the word will produce but don't try and choke it out with the kids the world and whatever is going on say Lord may our be fruitful for you you'll be fruitful for something it will either be the world will be God's Word right and we know that this world is like tears and thorns and thistles and weeds they grow faster he's healing spread out and grow well where'd that come from was in there those things gonna be plucked out but so don't pander to the world Pandit to God I mean you want to treat your family better give yourself to him you want everything you want God to sort out the situations in your home in your life give yourself down seek ye first the kingdom of God and His righteousness and these things shall be added unto you let's not add these things and then seek God and then his righteous then it'd all be fine no see key first of God seek you first his words Hickey first his will and his righteousness and these things will be added to you how lujah that's what's got to be we try and solve things always the wrong way how many how many percent of time we try and fix things with our own ability especially me no now we've got to fix this you know your wife comes to you this is happening this is happening and then she she just needs to let it out that's just like us and God sometimes we're gonna let it out pour out your prayer to him love this is happening to me it's the winter the King had a feast how's everything going she just pulls it out I'm under a death sentence my people are gonna know you got to tell them about what's going on all but he knows he wants you to tell them right the only way that you really build relationship you take with children or husband and wife you've got to speak about what's going on and then you can really connect about it you can't just be living in the same house not actually living together amen you can't just dwell there or not say anything to each other well you know ah but we're family you know we love each other you would express it you got to speak spend time go through things how you and it's and it's not just being in the same you know thing you don't express this how how'd you feel no I'm definitely preaching to myself now how did you this is how I felt when this was going on and there's a deeper kind of connection in yes I was there in this happened then you know you know what I mean you know what I think Allu you you got a you know but then you know men try and fix everything themselves but what about getting on your knees and really praying this is happening this just happened to us Oh Lord we have a token we have a token we can present with our prayer the life of God in us we can present with our prayer that he hears our prayers he can undertake and we're going to have confidence and then we pray you really pray through see the devil just wants us to say prayers he just wants us to go through emotion but when we really touch heaven that's what it wasn't try and ward you off that's why maybe some of you been sitting here thinking about everything else but now I can plan my week you know statistically speaking your week will take care of itself doesn't matter how good or bad if there's if the Lord would tarry there'll be Sunday and will still be alive and will be somewhere and the week happened sometimes we give too much worried about what's going to happen say Lord you orchestrate my week sure I have these things I need to do but Lord you take care of it you lead me through the week you show me what I need to do you you actually write my schedule that's what we need to do we need to commit our waste to him cast your cares upon him because he cares for you don't cast your cares upon your iPhone it doesn't care for you but sometimes we put so much things into the wrong we're looking at the wrong it's distraction its distraction we don't want to be distracted the devil always try and distract us from the real value of the word if we can just keep you from it it's like I'll just close with this he said you know you know Jesus asked ask the people asked his disciples who do men say that I am a prophet that was not enough they put value on him but not the right value but in Simon Peter said thou art the Christ the Son of the Living God he put there he saw it for what it was but the devil can just get you to lower your thinking on it lower your thinking on the word that's a good message there's a lot of cool testimonies you can hear about these eyewitnesses that you can see and this is neaten you know it's all that but it's more than that there's eternal life in that word so you don't want to just diminish it down to something I was raised this way this is just how voice being like this but when have you meet him when you've really had that encounter he's and he's become a living reality to you amen cast all your cares upon him I mean they stand to our feet shall we where'd the musicians please amen I'm so glad don't worry about the scarecrows amen this is Bao he's in a
