know the Rapture and you know um I was missing brother Chris Moritz in Canada and saying you know when these bodies have changed he's going to be one of the first people I'm going to visit now I just felt such a prison such a blessing you know it's going to happen I mean it's really going to happen you know the dead and Christ are going to raise these boys are going to be changed and what are 40 days about that's going to be upon the Earth until we go up and meet the Lord in the air and then what a time that's going to be amen amen so I trust you know what a provision our fathers made for us to get there hallelujah amen so let's just read here so the Lord answered me and said write the vision and make it plain upon tables that he may run that readeth it for the vision is yet for an appointed time but at the end it shall speak and not lie though tarry wait for it because it will surely come it will not tarry behold his soul that is lifted up is not in right in him but the just shall live by his faith hallelujah amen so let's just bow heads in a word of prayer amen remember in prayer and raise your hands a lot Hallelujah a gracious father we're so thankful that we can surrender all to you and Lord It's the best decision anyone could make is just give all their life to you oh God Lord you're more than life to us Lord we're so thankful that Lord You're Alive Lord Jesus will feel your presence here tonight Lord we just want to yield ourselves oh God may you do what you want to do in the service Lord Jesus take over o God we pray your blood with coverage and every one of us Lord any Spirit here that's not of you may be bound in the name of Jesus Christ that you'd have preeminence oh God may you anoint speaker and hear O Lord and fathers there's a prayer service where we know this is a House of Prayer but Lord this Wednesday we're having a prayer service and I pray Lord when we pray it wouldn't be us praying it be ye the Holy Spirit praying through us oh God lord may you grant it for your glory Lord we pray you'd be anyone who couldn't be here tonight Lord and second body let me think of uh Lord uh um uh fish Lord Jesus be with him dear God the Oliver family father on our house Lord whose unwell Lord touch them and be their portion we thank you Lord in Jesus Christ's name amen amen God bless you friends you may have your seats uh tonight so I want to talk about well I want to get into talking about prayer but you know as as we read here in habakook you know every vision is for an appointed time and but at the end it shall speak so so in order for a vision to speak it's got to put on flesh it's got to become reality it's got to be more than just words or even just the symbols it's got to become reality it's got to become flesh now we're living in a day where God is dwelling in his people once again we're the full power of Calvary is being expressed like never before I mean where the blood of Jesus Christ is so living in a people amen that we are that by his grace we we overcome the devil all of his Works we're not afraid of nothing that a spirit can do to us what could harm me of God is for you if God is for you who can be against you amen we're going to stand like they just realize God's for me I mean before I turned up upon the Earth he was for me and it was for me before I ever came here he made a way for me to go to heaven he's going to be for me for the rest of my life and for eternity amen but you see God you know it's amazing when you think about God where he thought in his mind the creation and the universe and you being here and you know he knew the world would be like it is like it is in you but but he wasn't he wasn't scared or in in any kind of dilemma or trouble when he saw that Satan would make the world like this he has full confidence in his salvation tonight amen he has full confidence in the power of his blood he does not ever get afraid or not a not a single thought of worry enters and into his mind can the enemy defeat me of course he can't defeat him how could you fight an enemy you think about the devil now he thinks he can outwit God and God knows in real time and even before it happens what he's going to do when he's going to do it and how he's going to do it you can't defeat an enemy that's got that kind of intelligence you know imagine you know a natural Army like the you know the ukrainians have been fed a lot of Intel from the Americans different things and the No Doubt the Russians get there and tell from other places but you know they kind of give a it's almost a guesstimation we think the enemy is going to do this and normally if they got the good enough intelligence they'll they'll be about right but sometimes they can be wrong but God's not like that he knows exactly when where what why how and he defeats the devil on every hand Hallelujah so the vision so when God saw a people remember Jesus Christ displayed everything that Adam lost he had dominion over nature he had dominion over every devil had dominion over everything yeah right I mean he conquered heldith in the grave he but he displayed everything that Adam lost in the garden the second Adam Jesus Christ manifested yes amen but now there's got to be a second Eve upon the earth a redeemed Church washing the blood of the Lamb amen Made In His Image so it was it's been sitting in the Bible prophesied through various types of Esther and Ruth and Rahab and different ones it's been you know it's been displayed through but now it's not a vision no more now it's speaking now it's become material where the word is not just think on paper no more but now it's living in human beings I mean it's not just a Theology of a discussion an argument it's gone well beyond that it's now this word by the Holy Ghost is put on flesh and you and I and it wasn't you wanting it it was God wanting it and what God wants he gets probably what God desires he has amen and nothing the devil can do can stop him from getting what he wanted to do amen all the nations and the promised land couldn't stop Joshua and Israel taking the inheritance nothing could stop a man and if God could not be stopped then he's not going to be stopped now I mean because he's the old powerful almighty God nothing could stop our lord Jesus fulfilling the prophecy is concerning his own life amen culture couldn't stop him unbelief couldn't stop him religion couldn't stop him arguments couldn't stop him fussing and fighting couldn't stop him Devils couldn't stop him Hal couldn't stop him the grave couldn't stop him the Romans couldn't stop him nothing could stop him from fulfilling the word that was prophesied for him to do and I say Friends by that same holy ghost that same quickening power will Quicken you to that same word that's prophesied of you Hallelujah so the vision is no longer a vision it's speaking Hallelujah amen you got to realize the Bible doesn't just reveal Jesus Christ it reveals you too if you're part of him I mean as as Paul would say in second Corinthians three ye are our Epistles written in our hearts known and read of all men for as much as ye are manifestly declared to be the Epistle of Christ ministered by US Written not with ink but with it but with the spirit of the Living God not in tables of stone but in fleshly tables of the heart I mean so Paul saying the word that was inspired to him was preached to the Corinthians and the Holy Ghost gave them Faith to receive that word and then they manifested that word so you're saying that the you are the living Bible that's basically what I'm saying you are living Bibles Corinthians and I'll say you right here are living Bibles I mean the bride of Christ is a living Bible some people don't like it saying oh we're the Living Word well actually we are the Living Word why because by his grace he transforms us gets rid of sin nature cleans up our lives and we receive the baptism of Holy Ghost we come a totally different person and then what happens the word puts on flesh Hallelujah remember if you say you're a Christian you're christ-like the only way you can be christ-like is not by human effort amen that's why we have all the religion we have in this day and unfortunately it's sincere people but it doesn't produce what the Bible said it should produce because it's man's effort if you pray enough if you listen enough if you do this enough if you give yourself enough no it's not it's not your effort see salvation and overcoming power is not based on what you can do it's what God has done it's faith and what God has done will produce the results Hallelujah I believe that remember salvation when we get to heaven we're not going to be gathered around the throne saying yes Lord you're awesome and thank you for bringing me here but I did this no every testimony is what he did in your life that's a true testimony you try to inject yourself into it it's not a testimony of God you're just trying to say look at me how great I am he's the great one in our midst and he'll always be the great one in our midst and he always will be the great one in our midst amen he's the one that we come to worship we don't worship any man we don't worship any man-made achievement we worship what God's achievements Hallelujah amen so he said that you admit so so that the spirit of living God not written in tables of stone in the fleshy table of the heart for such trust have we through Christ to godward not that we are sufficient of ourselves or think or to think anything as of ourselves but our sufficiency is of God who also hath made us able Ministers of the New Testament not of the letter but of the spirit for this letter killeth but the spirit giveth life I mean swear not here to kill people with letter dead letter but the spirit of God gives life gives life to the word that the word speaks amen puts on flesh and you're glad we have this kind of religion amen and you're glad this works Hallelujah aren't you glad it works how does it work he makes it work holy how did he do it I don't know but he did it how did he find you I don't know but he found you how did he turn you around how did he turn me around I'd actually don't know but he did it amen I don't know where how he found me but he found me he turned me around he saved me I wasn't looking for him but he was looking for me and that's what matters amen so I believe if he hasn't found you he's looking for you she might as well put your hand up and say Lord here I am reveal yourself to me Lord may I know you and your word hallelujah amen now there is there is always a predestinated people that want to line up with the word of God and it's not by their ability that they line up remember this is not remember if you're beating yourself up about your Victory it's because you've got you in the equation you give yourself to the Lord and He will give you Victory right remember the devil always wants us to get our Focus off of him right if we get our Focus off of off the law then we're defeated so who's the first guy he he he gets you to look at the man in the mirror right and if your focus is on you and what you think you are and you're you know this is not something that we earn this is not a this is not a coffee card thing you know you get a free coffee when you buy the tenth one you know what no this is not how this works we don't earn God's anything he earned it for us on Calvary amen so he's giving us the free coffee but we don't know yeah that may sound ridiculous but you know but people think that they have to earn something to get something you know God I've done this therefore you've got to listen to me no his blood puts us on speaking terms with him amen that's what breaks down the middle wall partition between us and God is his blood it's not what we have done it's what he has done but you see the devil wants us to focus on ourselves and not him let's keep our eyes on the Lord amen but there is a there is a always a people that are ordained to line up with the word of God now that is not just the letter of the word because that kills it's the spirit of the word or it's the heart of God in the word see many people come to the message with preconceived ideas and they think that's how it should be so for example men who are very strict think well yeah I'm the head of the home I'm the boss and the Lord's over their family that's not how brother Baron operated you know making sure that kids are basically seen and not heard just pushed in a corner Ultra strict on them and brother Adam said you should spoil your kids a bit more it's better to do it that side than the other side can't you say Amen spoil me parents spoil me of it where's that chocolate I heard that in chess today but you see preconceived idea of of children should be seen and not heard and that comes in they people get this whooped on my mind because they they're lining up with a letter of the word and not the spirit of the word amen men come along and they say yep I'm the head of the home they beat down their wife you know push you down that's not the spirit of the word that's culture coming in we're not here to bring our culture into Christianity remember this is not a white man's gospel any color gospel this is gospels from heaven right the gospel transcends culture right sure we're all built a bit differently but we should never bring our culture and how we were raised into how the word says we should have our families because 99 of how we were raised was actually we need to get rid of it and we say Lord change my thinking of my heart and my mode but everything how I operate everyday life change it to match your word Lord not I'm not here to bring preconceived ideas and say yeah this is how it should be they see people have lined up with the letter of the word bringing in their culture and things but now people have come to bring actually line up with the spirit of the word which gives life Hallelujah are you glad you can go back a generation and see it was like that they're Believers I'm not saying they weren't Believers don't get me wrong there's the people who begin to line up with the spirit of the word more than just a letter killing but you see now there's power when that begins to happen because the Dynamics of the Holy Ghost begin to get greater remember the enemy's moving on every hand but God is greater than the enemy right the remember when the enemy comes in like a flood the Lord says I'll raise up a standard against them and that standard is the anointed word in a people it means you look at this now she's he's about watch when the spiritual bride when she begins to have a Revival when she begins to come back and line herself up with the word of God watch then watch again you see how that the scriptures at that time there'll be a message sweep out to catch that bride catch that woman elect but I'm saying we're not just lining up the word that kills but the spirit of the word amen so people are going to line up with the heart of the word then God sweeps in to catch that licked woman away and we're living in that season it was a vision now it's here now it's speaking amen amen where it's not just the mechanics of of of church order and knowing Doctrine Doctrine but it's to make it's the Dynamics of the Holy Ghost coming in and making that word live amen I'm so glad this has gone beyond argument and compiling scriptures and quotes and having a stand that says no God comes in amen and takes over the church amen where it's not a man ruling over a bunch of people it's God shepherding a flock [Music] Hallelujah you know when you think about it that you know Jesus reputation was never made with the stiffened starchy his reputation was made with the Sinners so those he could who who actually crying out to be ministered to was where he got his reputation so so the woman at the well had five husbands and she was living with the six she was crying out she needed she was a broken woman yeah and she was looking for help and she knew that you know her father Jacob dug this well and so she had a religious kind of background but nothing could help her but Messiah said I need to go by the way of Samaria because I've got one of my daughters is there and she's hurting and she's broken but I don't want to leave her in that condition because that's not how I saw her before the foundation of the world and then so he made his reputation by revealing to her the things that she had gone through and her state but she but he did that that her eyes would come open and say the Messiah were looking for us here on the Earth right now Hallelujah the woman with the alabaster box amen the Lord's reputation was made amen she wasn't invited to Simon's Feast but she made her way in any way she broke that Alabaster Box At His Feet did not care what anyone else was doing around her amen and and he said thy sins by many are forgiven go in peace amen the lepers couldn't be helped by no one but they came to Jesus I mean he healed me I mean you know this Lazarus was dead in the grave four days his reputation was made being the resurrection of Life see it wasn't just talked about he manifested what he said he was and I pray to God that whoever comes through these doors amen as Christians our the reputation of the Lord Jesus Christ will be manifested that he heals the sick he heals the broken amen he comes troubled Minds amen he brings peace amen he brings understanding he brings identity and then he brings he he brings a belonging Amen to the word your people in the word I pray people can say this is what we are known for I came in these doors one way I left another way amen I came in Lost and looking and hungry and not satisfied by our left full and rejoicing and reinvigorated my life came alive Hallelujah he's real amen I trust that that could be our reputation amen when people come into your house and you begin to talk about the goodness of God the atmosphere begins to change it doesn't matter what they're in or what they've been doing I mean the atmosphere comes down and they know what these people are talking about it's not a theory it's not a learning it's real I mean because Jesus Christ is alive amen he's not just alive in these four walls he should be more alive out there than just in here I mean we come in here to get our our batteries boosted amen but it's out there where God can Minister Amen to to anyone hey Hallelujah that's the kind of Jesus I believe in amen amen we had we oh I don't care if this we had we had brother I'll call him brother Keith Thomas he was a he was a pastor he became an atheist in about 2002 where he thinks he's an atheist up to hear an evolution and he basically you know God moved on his heart came out of Catholicism he had a moment there and he was a he you know he told us of his walk with God such as simplicity something moved on his heart when he's just in his early 20s I've got to know God and he went to and he poured himself into Catholicism for a year because that's how his race didn't help him went to Evangelical Church Pentecostal church and God was doing things came across the message got baptized and but then you know he just got caught up in well he got made a pastor of a church and he said he never stopped to for God to satisfy that longing that he knew he had the Holy Ghost because he was pulling and confusion and especially in those days all kind of stuff politics and trouble and fussing and fighting and he's caught up and all that and we're saying to him because he's on Murphy Street there was where the boarding house was Mountain go back to that moment yes go back to that condition where it's not all confusing and you know what happens the Devil comes in and clouds your life well this is happening in the home the financial trouble this person is saying this about this person and now this problem with my children it all kind of you know becomes all confusing and busy and it's just like walking in a in the clouds fog who's had that kind of experience but God doesn't operate that way God has a still small voice and it's clear and he's alive and we're telling him just go back to that kind of condition and God will answer your longing and there's such an embass fear at the table and I knew he felt it and when he left he said you're doing a good thing I pray I pray it goes back to those moments because to me he didn't walk away from God he walked away from people's fussing and fighting and religious problems so I believe he's coming home that's what I said I call him brother Keith so remember him in prayer Hallelujah that's what our God does Hallelujah now oh okay A bit of wind this up quickly now a vision has to be spoken and that becomes material right the Apostle Paul says he says here he says we're just going to go down to verse 28 wherefore we're receiving a kingdom which cannot be moved let us have Grace whereby we may serve god acceptedly with reverence and godly fear for our God is a consuming fire now that word receiving it has a few meanings but it means something that's transmitted something that's been sent Hallelujah so the kingdom of God we know is the Holy Ghost within us because Jesus said the kingdom doesn't come with observation but the kingdom of God is within you speaking of the Holy Ghost that would come so now the Holy Ghost the kingdom of God we receive is something that's been transmitted down into our souls that God would take the word anointed with the Holy Ghost transmitted into your life and it would become flesh aren't you glad you got a receiving station Hallelujah and you guys you you got something in you that can receive the word of God Hallelujah and this is Sean where Peter was preaching in cornelius's house Cornelius was a devout man but he only knew the religion of the Jews he didn't he didn't even know the Messiah had come and been crucified and resurrected and the Holy Ghost poured out but an angel appeared to him when he was praying he said Cornelius your arms and prayers are come up before God now the angel didn't tell him how to receive the holy ghost or give him the Holy Ghost said go get Peter part of the body to come and preach and then then Peter comes in preaches about the crucifixion the resurrection and everything says well yet Peter spake these words the Holy Ghost fell on all of them that heard the word so what's happening the kingdom of God was transmitted amen through the body to them and they received the Holy Ghost and they are the circumcision which believer astonished why because they're back in the upper room again but it wasn't with the Jews it was with the Gentiles and they were astonished saying that same one who came down and filled us then is the same God who's come right here and filled these people hallelujah I'm so glad I can say I was there when the spirit came Hallelujah and I'm not talking about historical day of Pentecost Acts chapter two I'm talking about right here Amen in Our Lives who have seen the Spirit come again and again and again and he's filled people again and again and again Hallelujah I think we should brag on the Lord don't you think so I mean we should tell them as wonderful works that this word is alive it's not dead amen whatever you're going through our God is greater amen he's more than able to Lead You Through It Whatever trouble you're facing amen Our God has already led many people through the thing you're going through right now and he brought them out he'll bring you out the other side Hallelujah can any man Peter saying and they heard them speak with tongues of magnified God then answer Peter can any man forbid water that these should have should not be baptized seeing they have received the Holy Ghost as well as we and he commanded to be baptized in the name of the Lord then prayed they him to tarry certain days Hallelujah all right all right amen God's very good at repeating himself amen he fills every believing child with his holy spirit I believe you fully repented given your whole life I mean you baptized name of Lord Jesus Christ remission a sin and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost Hallelujah now prayer okay because we're going to have prayer but you know many times we forget prayer is always tied in with praise and Thanksgiving you know how the devil tries to disable the body of Christ as make us tense make us stressed make us burdened in the wrong kind of way because remember if God gives a burden he'll manifest that burden right but devil just gives a burden there's no answer to there's no way out and it's all questions and trouble and there's no answer and he you know we can't we can't really we can't walk with God like that but he wants us but the devil wants us to be in that state but it's good if you're in that state you realize that's not actually you that's not actually how you're meant to be he said devil you can carry your own bags I'm not carrying around your tenseness and your anxiety and your burdens and your stress and your high blood pressure and your problems you carry your own bags devil hey man you made it you have it back Hallelujah but you see when we get into a spirit of Praise when we pray then the spirit of God can take over and pray what he once prayed see it's not us really we shouldn't be us trying to work out what to pray sure we have our list who's got a list who has some needs it's good to have those on your heart but it's not now I'm going to write out a prayer and say it this is going to that's not how we should pray we should yield ourselves to the Holy Ghost and say Lord what do you want to pray you know you could have a prayer meeting every day of your life you say but there's only me invite God to your prayer meeting amen that's the best one to have in your premium you and him can pray together Hallelujah amen so he says this here now says rejoice in the Lord alway and again I say rejoice let your moderation be known to unto all men the Lord is at hand be careful for nothing but in everything by prayer and supplication with Thanksgiving how many times do we forget the Thanksgiving birth you know shall we pray we make supplication we make requests and God I'm so glad his phone lines never overloaded the signals never jammed I remember when Christy and I were there in Christchurch in the first earthquake and you know when the place was shaking and we were praying and God came down we had a wonderful time in prayer Christie was off praising the Lord and tongues and having a Rejoice today but the spirit of God was so there I wanted to open my eyes and watch what's going on but I thought no I'm going to pray and God just came down we had a glorious time but then you tried after all that was said and done we try and get on the um cell phone because you know Christine's Grandparents were in Christchurch and and it was just the second the network is overloaded God's Network don't get overloaded uh we can all be talking to him at once and he can talk to us individually all at once at the same time so I'm so thankful his signal don't get overloaded but how many times do we forget the Thanksgiving amen because it says in the Book of Psalms let's go to verse 34. I don't have this on my um I don't have this on on there um just came to mind but um you know it says it says a condition that when you should praise the Lord okay you can actually throw it up can you put up Psalms 34 and uh verse one okay so here's the condition because you say when should I bless the Lord and David or whoever wrote the said at all times his his praise shall continue to be in my mouth so at all times not just the good times not just the camp times not just the Happy Times the bad times the sad times the troubled times the burden times the times when things aren't going the way you think they should be going you should bless the Spain at all times at all times that covers the 24 said whatever condition you're in bless the Lord they say Lord my life is falling apart I bless your name amen Lord I'm in great trouble I bless your name Lord I don't know the answer this problem I bless your name that's how we should be at all times amen hallelujah we should always enter into prayer like this bless this night that's why when the lord gave the model prayer you know our father child in heaven Hallowed be thy name thy kingdom come thy will be done and then it wasn't to finish with with the for thine is the power and Glory forever and ever amen so the prayer starts with praise and to me it ends with praise and that's how we should pray we should enter into praise then you feel saying come on your heart then you pray for it then maybe you start praising him again something else comes on your mind pray for that you should just do it like that who's who's with me it's good it'll make you happy Hallelujah you think about where the Lord brought you from I mean let's just let's just be real folks where did he find you where did he find your winners he brought you Hallelujah yeah that's right and and it just gets better Hallelujah because we have this all of us in Heaven Too amen so there's just a foretaste of Heaven amen God comes down it's just a four taste it's just the fourth Taste of heaven love divine but then eventually we're not just living in the trickle of it we're living in the fountain when our bodies are changing we're up in glory so really we can't lose it's all good the world's falling apart it's all good I'm in great trouble it's all good Hallelujah you might think I'm crazy but I actually I did get brainwashed because my brain needed a washing it was filthy it thought about all kinds of filthy things but it got washed okay so yeah I've been brainwashed I'll just confess it to the world that's good holy amen that's a whiter snow praise the Lord so we should always have Thanksgiving amen we should bless the Lord at all times amen Hallelujah now you look at this I thought this is very interesting this is Psalms 22. and Psalms 22 is really when David is is looking at Calvary in in vision I don't have the whole thing here but just just look at this now he says my God my God why is thou forsaken me why thou so far from helping me and from the words of my roaring he was he was caught up in the spirit and he was looking at Christ on on the cross so I know what kind of stadiums and when the inspiration struck him but he was literally there in my opinion but then he says oh my God I cry in the daytime and thou Harris me not in the ninth season and am not silent but Thou Art holy oh that inhabitants the Praises of Israel amen so David had a revelation no he's looking at Calvary the great Agony our Lord would suffer there he had a revelation that God inhabits the Praises of his people that means if you want God to come down start praising him from her thanks thankful heart and God will step down into that praise he'll inhabit that praise it's not no no we know praise and worship is not rejoicing in a in a skill right praise and worship is from a thankful heart that what God has done amen so he inhabits the praise so if you want God to come down and anoint your prayer start praising him start giving him thanks for what he's done and what he said he would do Hallelujah amen amen I like the Psalms it's good praise ye the Lord Praise Him in a sanctuary Praise Him in the ferment of his power now that permanent word is the same as in Genesis was atmosphere so Praise Him in the atmosphere of his power and when you feel the power of God search through Praise Him hallelujah praise him for his mighty acts Praise Him according to his excellent greatness praise him with the sound of the trumpet praise him with the pulsory in the harp praise him with the timber in the dance Hallelujah wherefore dancing because it's in the word hallelujah amen amen if it's Holy Ghost dancing it's good dancing I mean praise him with string instruments and organs Praise Him upon the loud symbols Praise Him upon the high sounding symbols let everything that has breath who's got breath today praising the Lord Hallelujah I heard I think his brother Ron Spencer said the only excuse for you not to praise the Lord is if you're dead because let everything have breath praise you the Lord amen so if you've got breath praise him amen this is what we should do the lord loves praise he loves worship in spite of condition Hallelujah amen now when you get into that atmosphere and it can just be like that it's not a 10 minute workout this is not a warm-up like you're going to run a track and field or play a game you just from a thankful heart say Lord You're beautiful your face is all I seek when your eyes are upon this child Your Grace abounds in me his eyes are always upon you likewise the spirit so then the Holy Ghost can come in and take over likewise the spirit all also help with our infirmities for he for we know not what we should pray for as we ought but the spirit itself maketh intercession for us with groanings that cannot be uttered who's ever prayed such a way just you don't even know what you're saying that's the spirit groaning praying through you you say what did he pray for I don't know but he answered it amen for for us with groanings that cannot be uttered and he that searcheth the heart knoweth what is the mind of the spirit because he maketh intercession for the Saints according to the will of God amen see we're all intercessors not like our Lord Jesus Christ not for sin but for intercede for one another right but the devil doesn't want us to to to possess this office Amen to praise God then God can come down and pray through us like he wants to the devil can't stop you right he may hinder you but he can't stop you amen you know if we have an expectation God will meet the expectation Hallelujah amen I'm gonna I'm just gonna finish there maybe we'll just read this again let's have the musicians come we're gonna I was going to read Psalms
