[13:41] [Music]
[13:55] share it and if there's an opportunity
[13:58] I'll share it so they said opportunity
[14:00] but in through that all the you know
[14:05] Satan also tries to not get it happen
[14:08] but um so my auntie is going back on
[14:12] Tuesday she the Lord provided a flight
[14:16] for her back home and with everything
[14:19] going so there's a flight from Brisbane
[14:22] to South Africa but she needs to get to
[14:25] Brisbane and um so it's more her her
[14:29] taste him anybody it just shout it was
[14:32] yeah it was just amazing how the Lord
[14:35] was doing all of it and so she we were
[14:42] looking for flights and there was no
[14:43] flights from Auckland to Brisbane and we
[14:46] were really praying or was also praying
[14:48] that the Lord would give her the most
[14:49] direct flight back home because there
[14:51] was other flights but it's 60 hour
[14:53] flights and it's just too long you know
[14:56] um
[14:57] the Lord provides the most direct flight
[15:00] Auckland Brisbane Brisbane home and so
[15:04] we had to book a ticket from Auckland
[15:06] Brisbane and first there was no tickets
[15:09] and then the next morning she got us on
[15:14] a whatsapp group and I said there is a
[15:15] ticket is tickets so we booked
[15:19] but it was a lot of money and so it was
[15:23] about nine hundred dollars just from
[15:26] Auckland to Brisbane and so we booked it
[15:30] and the next morning there was tickets
[15:33] again but for more than half the price
[15:36] for only about $400 enim I said no
[15:40] that's not right
[15:41] so I Chantal was there there's more that
[15:44] morning and I said that's not right said
[15:47] let's pray let's pray because the Lord
[15:49] can provide that that I can make a plan
[15:53] that she doesn't have to buy that much
[15:54] because she already has to buy that much
[15:56] and I don't want it to buy that much and
[16:00] so that was also why in the beginning
[16:02] one of my you know I'm backtracking but
[16:06] think that when there is a flights
[16:08] that's not that much money for and that
[16:11] the Lord would provide that as well and
[16:13] so long story short arrow once enter
[16:16] email to a New Zealand they were so wats
[16:20] a group he's saying what's up to them
[16:24] and we were at Sony Amory splice and we
[16:28] were just talking about it and the
[16:30] tickets and I just said but I'm
[16:31] believing the Lord will provide
[16:34] I'm standing on that and I'm believing
[16:36] and I also was saying that the text came
[16:39] through that everyone sinned and said
[16:41] they will be happily if we're ebook they
[16:44] will happily refund that whole nine
[16:47] hundred and she can read book at a
[16:49] cheaper fly for four hundred I'm saying
[16:52] that is the Lord we serving there is our
[16:55] God praising Amen god bless you I just
[17:11] could not help it you know I just wanted
[17:15] to give the Lord all the glory in the
[17:17] own email but I don't have much but this
[17:22] morning the word of the Lord came to me
[17:24] you know I couldn't sleep last night in
[17:27] and I couldn't understand what is the
[17:29] problem and
[17:32] even up to now I don't know why couldn't
[17:33] I sleep in I was talking to my wife and
[17:36] we think of different things and but I
[17:39] don't know and I just woke up quite
[17:41] alien I started true to pray and just to
[17:44] speak to the Lord in and when I opened
[17:47] my Bible you know the Lord just sent me
[17:49] to this verse that I cannot read the
[17:51] whole chapter but just a few verses but
[17:54] I believe is the word of God that came
[17:55] to me you know not only to me but to me
[17:59] and God's people amen in that one is in
[18:02] Isaiah Isaiah 51 he came so wonderfully
[18:07] to me he says it was just like I was
[18:09] reading something that I never read
[18:12] before amen verse 3 for the Lord shall
[18:16] comfort Zion he will comfort all he
[18:18] waste places and he will make her
[18:23] wilderness like Eden and her desert like
[18:26] the Garden of the Lord joy and gladness
[18:29] shall be found there in Thanksgiving in
[18:32] the voice of the melody in verse 6 we
[18:36] say lift up your eyes to the heavens and
[18:39] look upon the earth beneath for the
[18:42] heavens shall vanish away like smoke and
[18:45] the earth shall wax old
[18:46] like command and they that dwell therein
[18:49] shall die in in that manner but my
[18:52] salvation shall be forever and my
[18:55] righteousness shall not be abolished
[18:57] how can unto me ye that know
[19:00] righteousness the people in wise heart
[19:02] is my law fear ye not the reproach of
[19:06] men neither be ye afraid of their
[19:09] revealing zhh first 10 are down not in
[19:12] which had dried the sea about not in
[19:16] which had dried the sea the waters of
[19:18] the great deep that had made the test of
[19:22] the sea a way of the ransom to pass
[19:25] Esther I even I am that comforted you
[19:30] who allow that thou shouldn't be afraid
[19:35] of men that shall die and in other wise
[19:40] he says who are you that you can be
[19:42] afraid to the to the people that can die
[19:45] you know and and and the son of men we
[19:48] shall shall be made as grass why should
[19:51] you be afraid and forget us and forget
[19:54] us the Lord that die maker that had
[19:57] stretches fought the heavens and laid
[19:59] the foundations of the earth and it's in
[20:02] fear
[20:03] continually every day because of the
[20:06] fury of the oppressor as if he were
[20:09] ready to destroy and where and wherein
[20:13] is the first the fury of the oppressor
[20:15] but I am THE LORD thy God that's verse
[20:18] 15 but I am the Lord our God that
[20:21] divided the sea whose whose Amen whose
[20:31] waves fraud the Lord of Hosts is his
[20:35] name um I just wanted to give a
[20:54] testimony guys we lift the wellington
[21:00] area about 30 years ago and there was no
[21:04] one to fellowship was down here it was
[21:06] just we got told that Wellington was
[21:08] spiritually did that it was all prayed
[21:10] out and so to look around and see all
[21:13] you guys down here and what the Lord's
[21:15] doing down here is just absolutely it's
[21:19] really amazing just do many Mikes a
[21:32] anyone else brother James I love this eh
[21:38] I wasn't actually gonna planning on
[21:41] sharing this but since we're doing
[21:43] shearing
[21:45] I've been spending at a time with
[21:48] unbelievers just with fellowship with
[21:51] mountain biking and things and I sort of
[21:54] believe that there's no you know these
[21:56] these situations don't happen for no
[21:58] reason you know where the bride and
[21:59] we're there to be approachable on
[22:02] different things but this is maybe more
[22:04] a prayer acquiesce but a guy that I was
[22:06] riding with a little while ago he's
[22:08] probably in his early twenties and he's
[22:10] had a real rough upbringing with his
[22:11] dad's a gang president of a gang and he
[22:16] had bought himself like a ten thousand
[22:18] dollar mountain bike really flash run
[22:19] and now he's getting back into the drugs
[22:22] and he was offering his bike around to
[22:25] people and willing to take 500 bucks for
[22:27] it just so he could get us next hurt him
[22:29] you know I just really felt on my heart
[22:32] when I heard it yesterday just to pray
[22:34] for him and just say Lord just he's
[22:35] right at that point you know where he
[22:38] could just go and he'll never come back
[22:40] and I just really felt to pray from his
[22:42] name was Maddie and so yeah I just have
[22:45] you filled on your heart to pray for him
[22:47] just the Lord would keep them because
[22:49] we're there for a reason you know we
[22:51] don't have these interactions for no
[22:52] reason and the law can place me there in
[22:55] that situation just don't succeed
[23:08] allworthy once upon a time we if we
[23:13] carried on the way that we were walking

[47:15] to the book of first kings and this is
[47:18] um this may be a bit different but
[47:22] that's alright
[47:23] God's in the different first Kings in 21
[47:28] and I've got a it's on the slides which
[47:32] should be in the queue yeah yeah and
[47:40] then we're gonna go to Hebrews chapter 4
[47:41] I mean when everyone's there or looking
[47:50] at the screen just say I mean I mean
[47:53] God's in control I mean we shouldn't we
[47:56] shouldn't worry
[47:56] I mean first Kings 21 and we're gonna
[48:00] read down to I believe it's it's verse 8
[48:03] here
[48:04] first Kings 21 and verse 1 then it came
[48:07] to pass that after these things their
[48:09] neighbor off the jezreelite had a
[48:12] vineyard which was in Jezreel hard by
[48:15] the palace of ahab king of Samaria in
[48:19] ahab spake unto neighbors saying give me
[48:21] thy vineyard that I may have it for a
[48:24] garden of herbs because it is near unto
[48:25] my house and I will give it thee for a
[48:28] bit of an yard then it or if it seemed
[48:31] good to thee I will give thee the worth
[48:33] of it and money and they both said to
[48:35] Ahab the Lord forbid at me that I should
[48:39] give the inheritance of my fathers unto
[48:40] thee and Ahab came into his house heavy
[48:43] and displeased because of the words
[48:46] which they both the
[48:47] her light had spoken to him for he had
[48:50] said I'll not give thee the inheritance
[48:51] of my father's and he laid him down upon
[48:54] his bed and turned away his face and
[48:57] would not eat no bread so he had an
[49:01] adult tantrum now I've got your
[49:05] attention good but G but G's Abell his
[49:09] wife came to him and said and unto him
[49:11] why as thy spirit so said that thou
[49:14] eatest no bread and he said unto her
[49:17] because i spake at an a both the
[49:19] jezreelite and said unto him give me thy
[49:21] vineyard for money or else effort please
[49:24] say I'll give thee another vineyard for
[49:26] it and he answered and when he answered
[49:29] I will not give it thee I will not give
[49:31] thee my vineyard and jitan Jezebel his
[49:33] wife said unto Him thus thou now govern
[49:37] the kingdom of Israel
[49:38] arise and eat bread and let thy heart be
[49:40] merry I'll give thee the vineyard of
[49:42] naboth the jezreelite amen and then
[49:46] we're going to go to Hebrews chapter 4
[49:48] I'm gonna read some familiar Scripture
[49:51] here Hebrews 4 and 12
[49:53] I think it's Hebrews 4:12 he's here
[50:10] I'm gonna read down to to verse 16 for
[50:14] the word of God is quick and powerful
[50:15] and sharper than any two-edged sword
[50:19] dividing only piercing even to the
[50:21] dividing asunder of soul and spirit and
[50:24] of the joints and marrow and is a
[50:26] discerner of the thoughts and tints of
[50:28] the heart neither is there any creature
[50:30] that is not manifest in a sight but all
[50:33] things are naked and open unto the eyes
[50:35] of whom which whom we have to do you
[50:37] can't hide nothing that's basically the
[50:39] sum total you can't hide nothing even
[50:42] your your your objectives your motives
[50:44] you know you can pull the wool over
[50:45] everyone's eyes but not God seeing then
[50:48] that we have a great high priest with
[50:52] that is passed into the heavens Jesus
[50:54] the Son of God let us hold fast our
[50:56] profession for we have not an High
[50:59] Priest which cannot be touched with the
[51:01] fee
[51:01] of our infirmities but was in all points
[51:04] tempted like as we are yet without sin
[51:07] let us therefore come boldly unto the
[51:09] throne of grace that we may obtain mercy
[51:11] and find grace to help in time of need I
[51:16] mean may the Lord bless the reading of
[51:17] his word you may have your seats this
[51:19] morning
[51:19] I wonder um what do we got next oh yes
[51:22] okay so I want to continue on I think a
[51:25] couple of services guys talk about the
[51:26] heart so I want to continue on talking
[51:28] about the heart of man now we we start
[51:31] here with with a hab and I said he had
[51:35] an adult tantrum hit and and what I want
[51:38] to talk about this morning is I want to
[51:40] talk about real love this is my title
[51:42] this may see me but we may go way up
[51:43] this way there will come way back here
[51:45] and we'll end up hopefully where we want
[51:47] to end up but I want to talk about real
[51:49] love and going beyond a crush now now
[51:52] when I use the term crush I'm not
[51:54] talking just two to two teenagers to me
[51:57] adults to because the society we live in
[51:59] has actually been engineered that people
[52:02] actually don't emotionally mature beyond
[52:04] a teenager this is actually how
[52:06] society's been built and so we want to
[52:10] look into this because you know as I say
[52:12] there's not just for teenagers for
[52:13] adults because there's been studies done
[52:15] that's actually proven it's not by I
[52:18] don't know how to blank that here we'll
[52:20] leave it up there you know it's been
[52:22] studies done not by Christians at all
[52:24] proving that actually the millennial
[52:26] generation which is my generation and
[52:27] and and the ones after us actually
[52:30] society especially when it comes to men
[52:32] and but same with woman too as as people
[52:35] physically become a man but emotionally
[52:38] there's still boys and it's actually
[52:40] based on you know your the whole culture
[52:42] of gaming and and the internet and
[52:44] entertainment and everything it actually
[52:46] emotionally stunts people and what
[52:49] happens is you end up like Ahab because
[52:52] here was a hab he was king right but
[52:55] then he had a crush he had a desire I
[52:57] want that guy's vineyard I want that one
[53:00] and so he had a desire that he wanted it
[53:02] but because it was against the Word of
[53:04] God and they both said no you can't have
[53:06] it what did he do he threw it at all
[53:07] tantrum he went in here I love reading
[53:10] this story to my girls in the picture
[53:11] bubble cuz you know I have zero know
[53:13] Jesus about walks and
[53:15] he's easy he's got his face against the
[53:16] wall and lying on his beard and they're
[53:19] just they're not eating us he she comes
[53:20] in honey what's wrong and he goes that's
[53:29] what he's basically doing it's
[53:31] ridiculous but this is what the guy did
[53:33] why because emotionally he was still a
[53:36] boy he was a king but emotionally he was
[53:39] a boy he couldn't handle someone saying
[53:42] no oh but I wanna you know he's like
[53:45] having a fuss and the problem is but you
[53:48] see is because what happens is something
[53:50] will always fill the void member he was
[53:52] meant to be king and if someone is not
[53:54] in their place
[53:55] something will fill that void so what
[53:57] filled the boy boy Jezebel filled the
[53:59] void she said I'll take care of this and
[54:01] she wrote letters and you know there's a
[54:02] conspiracy and they had named both
[54:04] killed under false charges and then na
[54:06] had got the got the got the vineyard but
[54:09] if he was a godly King this would never
[54:12] have happened and he would never have
[54:14] been killed in battle and all those
[54:16] things so he brought judgment upon
[54:19] himself because emotionally he was still
[54:21] a boy he threw an adult tantrum you know
[54:25] adult Tantrums they're just as bad as
[54:27] the kids you're facedown screaming on
[54:29] the ground they may look more control
[54:31] but the same same thing we don't want to
[54:34] grow up and just be throwing out old
[54:35] Tantrums all the day long because we got
[54:37] handle things anyway so you know see so
[54:41] the Word of God now we need to see the
[54:44] devil what he does is he comes up next
[54:46] to us and starts whispering in our ears
[54:49] and if we begin to agree with him he
[54:52] will take our spirits you'll take our
[54:54] fictions our reasoning our imagination
[54:55] our conscience our memory and he'll
[54:57] anoint it to such a degree that will
[55:00] believe his lie above the facts so we
[55:04] don't want to get you know you know I
[55:05] was singing do we have weight can we
[55:06] have that backup I always um I'm so bad
[55:10] with power would anyway Jeremiah 10:23
[55:13] but but we're gonna stumble through this
[55:14] but I trust that you know it'll it'll
[55:16] help us you know because it's not just
[55:19] as I say teenagers that go through
[55:21] crushes and things it's adults why do
[55:22] you think men leave their wives and they
[55:24] go marry this one they do have midlife
[55:26] crises and things why because they're
[55:28] emotional
[55:28] they've gone from just a crush to a
[55:30] crush and there's no anchoring real love
[55:32] in their lives I'm innocent but it's the
[55:35] same thing in you know you know and
[55:36] Christians and people are caught up in
[55:38] this this ministry then this ministry
[55:40] then this ministry but you know and they
[55:42] just keep wandering from one thing to
[55:44] another because it sounds good but if
[55:46] their heart is ever anchored in the Word
[55:48] of God that's like real love it stays
[55:50] it's got holding power they won't be
[55:52] swayed to nothing else they found the
[55:54] real thing so Jeremiah here says Oh Lord
[55:58] I know that the way of man is not in
[56:00] himself it is not a man that walketh to
[56:03] direct the steps this is Jeremiah
[56:05] talking now it's amazing the you know
[56:09] it's amazing Jeremiah and and this is
[56:11] very applicable to our day because
[56:14] before Jeremiah was there we know it was
[56:16] now forgive me if I get it wrong but I
[56:18] did Joe I'm Josiah
[56:20] I think it's King Josiah you know he he
[56:23] was a godly King and nnn he saw the
[56:26] house of God was falling down and he
[56:28] said we've got to repair this thing
[56:30] we're gonna repair it and then as they
[56:32] were appearing at they find the Word of
[56:33] God hidden hidden somewhere now to me
[56:36] that's crazy but you know the word has
[56:38] been left somewhere just discarded and
[56:41] then now when the temples being rebuilt
[56:42] they find the word then they begin to
[56:44] read the law and they begin to realize
[56:46] guys we're toast because we've done
[56:49] everything that Moses said if you do
[56:50] that if you follow the gods of the
[56:52] heathen if you do all these things
[56:53] you're gonna be taken out the land and
[56:55] they're reading this saying wigs we're
[56:57] in dire straights what are we gonna do
[56:59] about this and they and they and they
[57:02] read it to the king and you know he was
[57:03] repenting to then they went to the
[57:04] prophetess a hood longer namers have him
[57:07] pronounced a rope and God said this will
[57:09] happen but not in the days of King
[57:11] Josiah so now here comes Jeremiah and
[57:15] now what-what was prophesied before him
[57:18] has to come to pass and he is living in
[57:22] an hour where it's going to come to pass
[57:23] he's already had the vision that the
[57:25] Babylonians gonna come down and destroy
[57:27] Jerusalem he knows that it's that that
[57:30] it's over but yet he has to stand there
[57:33] and preach against the wrong to try and
[57:35] try and bring the people back to the
[57:37] Word of God and his world was falling
[57:40] apart but he's got to stand there in
[57:41] there
[57:42] that world falling apart and it's the
[57:44] same thing today you know have you ever
[57:46] put yourself in a Bible character like
[57:48] that how could someone could stand in an
[57:51] unstable world but yet stay true to
[57:55] their Commission we are we are walking
[57:57] in those same steps today this world I
[58:01] think I think brother John Andy's seen
[58:03] it how this world is I think he preached
[58:04] on balance or something this is an
[58:06] Easter or sometime you know this world
[58:08] is very unbalanced incredibly unbalanced
[58:12] and we're gonna be very careful we don't
[58:13] get caught in the unbalancing because
[58:17] this world is falling apart and
[58:19] unfortunately we can't stop it now he
[58:23] says here in leadership but now who lead
[58:25] you see if you can come to a realization
[58:27] that is not within yourself to direct
[58:28] your steps you know this this may sound
[58:31] ridiculous but this was me you know I
[58:33] wanted to become a doctor
[58:35] and you know but do you know why it is
[58:37] so so that it sounds like a good thing
[58:38] to do become a doctor you know why I
[58:40] wanted to become a doctor because when I
[58:42] was young I thought surgery TV shows was
[58:45] cool and I used to watch a comedy series
[58:50] called scrubs and I thought and that
[58:54] gave me the motivation to be a doctor
[58:57] yeah oh dear but the thing is you you're
[59:01] you can be so caught up in something and
[59:03] it's not reality it's just a fantasy
[59:06] world and you know it can be seen so I
[59:09] was like math of what a ridiculous
[59:12] fellow but that's how I was you mean
[59:15] what do you mean you get caught up in a
[59:16] and a TV show and you wanna you know
[59:18] make your whole life to do this yeah
[59:21] people do it people do it and a lot more
[59:24] vain things than being a doctor help us
[59:26] God keep us keep our keep our spirits
[59:29] right keep us keep us on the middle of
[59:32] the road you know I don't say there's a
[59:34] joke but you ought to say it I can't
[59:35] understand one side to be caught up in
[59:37] something at all want to do this and you
[59:39] know it's not within us to direct our
[59:42] steps if you just come to that
[59:43] realization Lord that's not actually in
[59:46] me to direct master I need something to
[59:48] direct me and if you have the Word of
[59:50] God this message to direct you you'll
[59:52] come out right
[59:54] I mean but if you don't have it you'll
[59:56] be teetering around like the rest of the
[59:57] world he says but now who leads you
[1:00:00] that's the question now now we're all
[1:00:02] led by something tonight I'll say this
[1:00:04] morning we have to be we're led now this
[1:00:11] world as I see this falling apart now
[1:00:13] brother Brown and I just I just picked
[1:00:16] us out of condemnation by representation
[1:00:18] remember in 1933 heared though what we
[1:00:20] call the seven major visions and the
[1:00:21] last one is what I've got underlined but
[1:00:24] his autumn automobiles will continue to
[1:00:27] get like egg-shaped finally they'll
[1:00:29] build one that won't need a steering
[1:00:30] wheel oh cool I can go probably buy that
[1:00:33] it's there
[1:00:35] we have the technology yep they've got
[1:00:38] it now it will be controlled by some
[1:00:41] other power then I see in the United
[1:00:43] States is one smouldering burnt over
[1:00:45] place it will be near the end this is
[1:00:48] what he said the others have come to
[1:00:50] pass this has to happen but I'll say
[1:00:52] this that it's like this will be a
[1:00:55] combination a culmination of multiple
[1:00:59] events they won't be in the height of
[1:01:01] their strength of moral authority and
[1:01:03] and power and then suddenly nickman
[1:01:05] Utley nothing rome wasn't built in a day
[1:01:08] and it wasn't destroyed in a day just
[1:01:11] like America they won't be destroyed in
[1:01:14] one day so the insanity that you see
[1:01:16] going on over there now is actually
[1:01:18] marching towards that it's all wrong
[1:01:23] what's going on that that poor man that
[1:01:25] was murdered by the police that was
[1:01:26] murder that was wrong that was
[1:01:28] absolutely wrong right you know but it's
[1:01:31] just it's just a symptom of that that
[1:01:34] it's marching just like Jeremiah he saw
[1:01:36] it there marching towards destruction
[1:01:38] and didn't matter what they what he said
[1:01:40] what he tried to do God vindicated as
[1:01:45] his minister everything they said now
[1:01:46] we're gonna go this way anyway and it's
[1:01:49] the same thing with America we can't
[1:01:52] stop it happening but we can't get
[1:01:54] caught up in it why because a spirit is
[1:01:58] manifesting to cause division see ya you
[1:02:01] know the old old saying divide and
[1:02:02] conquer where does that come from that's
[1:02:04] from the devil how does the house are
[1:02:07] you're a strong
[1:02:08] if it's divided it will fall right
[1:02:11] everyone's got their motive and
[1:02:13] objective for doing what they're doing
[1:02:14] but it's just a place the house is
[1:02:16] divided but we can't be caught up in the
[1:02:19] division right we have to actually say
[1:02:22] well unfortunately this has to be this
[1:02:25] way but we have a way out of here
[1:02:28] right and that's honestly this is this
[1:02:31] is really should be our main focus the
[1:02:34] ship is sinking get everyone we can on
[1:02:36] the lifeboat right it's like the Titanic
[1:02:39] slowly going down get everyone on the
[1:02:41] lifeboat we're going to get out of here
[1:02:42] oh no we can we can pump the water out
[1:02:44] no no you can't pump the water out the
[1:02:46] boats gonna sink right oh we can fix
[1:02:48] this world brother Bram said that that
[1:02:50] America could have an Abraham Lincoln
[1:02:52] and a George Washington and every county
[1:02:53] and every state and it still wouldn't
[1:02:56] help it and here was the George
[1:02:58] Washington Muir he was the first
[1:03:00] president yo you're the other signed the
[1:03:03] Declaration of Independence every man
[1:03:04] created equal all those things in
[1:03:06] Abraham Lincoln they mean freed the
[1:03:08] slaves you know you know he's here at
[1:03:10] the slave market in Louisiana saw those
[1:03:12] slaves being sold and he said even if it
[1:03:14] costs my life I'll hurt that thing
[1:03:16] hallelujah and he did it I meant you can
[1:03:19] have those kind of me and that kind of
[1:03:20] caliber in every state every county
[1:03:23] every state and it would still sink so
[1:03:25] that's why unfortunate going to save and
[1:03:27] get on the boat get on the gospel life
[1:03:29] ship how their because we're because
[1:03:31] unfortunately this world is sinking amen
[1:03:35] it doesn't mean where I'm not happy with
[1:03:37] what's going on I'm not praise the Lord
[1:03:39] Amen we're getting closer not only this
[1:03:41] I you know when I saw what's going on I
[1:03:44] was actually crying about it such a
[1:03:46] great nation and brother am said if they
[1:03:48] just accepted the gift of the Holy Ghost
[1:03:50] they would have had a millennium if the
[1:03:54] nation just accepted Christ when he was
[1:03:56] manifesting himself and his power all
[1:03:58] through the United States and Canada all
[1:04:00] the way through their multiple ministry
[1:04:02] signs and healings and wonders and
[1:04:04] things of faith he said if they just
[1:04:06] accepted the Holy Ghost they would have
[1:04:08] had a millennium just like just like
[1:04:10] Solomon's gift was except the buyers
[1:04:12] rather it's like they had a millennium
[1:04:13] in that day they had peace but it's the
[1:04:16] same thing with us if we just accept the
[1:04:17] gift of the Holy Ghost in this hour I
[1:04:19] mean you'll have a like a millennium in
[1:04:21] your
[1:04:21] in your heart hallelujah but
[1:04:24] unfortunately to reject that means chaos
[1:04:26] and they've got chaos they have ripped
[1:04:28] now they're sowing what they reaped and
[1:04:29] this country will do the same thing when
[1:04:32] I were an island no no this world is
[1:04:33] connected went on an island somewhere
[1:04:36] actually or was up it was actually
[1:04:38] Christine's um uncle uncle Peter said yo
[1:04:43] Switzerland as an island I thought no
[1:04:46] it's not it's connected with Europe now
[1:04:49] he meant that as in terms of like it's
[1:04:51] separate from everything else not not
[1:04:53] gia you know you're the geography of the
[1:04:55] place
[1:04:55] well no it's all in to open like this
[1:04:57] we're all in to open with everything
[1:05:00] else
[1:05:00] hey yeah if the house is on fire we're
[1:05:02] gonna burn down with it that's why we're
[1:05:06] going to stay level in an unlevel world
[1:05:10] you know the problem you know we had it
[1:05:13] was when the youth came up from Taranaki
[1:05:15] and stuff I was in a car with brother
[1:05:16] Kanan and these other brothers we're
[1:05:17] driving out to what's that cafe there by
[1:05:20] the airport we're into whatever that's
[1:05:22] called chocolate fish it was good anyway
[1:05:26] we're driving there and these two
[1:05:28] brothers are talking about different
[1:05:30] political systems and which one's better
[1:05:33] and how this one were working and in
[1:05:34] theory sure but the problem is you're
[1:05:37] dealing with unconverted fallen man so
[1:05:40] nothing's gonna work because this
[1:05:42] unconverted fallen man that devil can
[1:05:44] work through and selfish motives
[1:05:47] couldn't you know so you know theories
[1:05:50] all very well but your practicality oh
[1:05:53] so the greater the house the greater the
[1:05:57] destruction of the house you know so you
[1:06:03] can see why Jeremiah's called the
[1:06:04] weeping prophet tried to swing the
[1:06:06] people back but because it was
[1:06:09] prophesied it had to happen it happened
[1:06:13] anywho brother baron would say this and
[1:06:18] in the simona church age speaking about
[1:06:21] ahab speaking about anyone like going
[1:06:23] back to that he says why does he stand
[1:06:26] by our character and so on the reason is
[1:06:28] in romans 8 17 to 18 and if children
[1:06:30] then is is of God joint heirs with
[1:06:32] Christ if so be we suffer with him
[1:06:35] that we may be also glorified together
[1:06:37] for I reckon that the sufferings of this
[1:06:38] present time are not worthy to be
[1:06:42] compared with the glory that shall be
[1:06:43] revealed in us unless we suffer with
[1:06:46] them we cannot reign with them we have
[1:06:48] to suffer to reign the reason is that
[1:06:50] character simply is never made without
[1:06:52] suffering character is a victory it's
[1:06:54] not a gift doesn't just get given to you
[1:06:56] here have have got the character no no
[1:06:58] it's a victory well what's the thing
[1:07:01] you've got to overcome your own selfish
[1:07:03] first birth amen
[1:07:05] I mean we have to character as a victory
[1:07:08] not a gift a man without character can't
[1:07:10] rain because power
[1:07:12] apart from character is satanic but
[1:07:14] power with character is fit to rule a
[1:07:16] man just like just like Ahab he had no
[1:07:19] character so I was a satanic leadership
[1:07:21] over the nation through through a adult
[1:07:24] tantrum and as I see it society you say
[1:07:28] that's a big statement but it's true
[1:07:29] Society has been engineered to make us
[1:07:31] emotionally immature doesn't matter what
[1:07:34] age we are why can't we shout and
[1:07:38] rejoice we may get there but you know I
[1:07:40] was I was thinking a lot about what what
[1:07:44] brother John Andes were saying on over
[1:07:47] Easter time you know we can we can shout
[1:07:50] we can rejoice about abstract things but
[1:07:54] this message comes down to our everyday
[1:07:55] life that comes down to the the the the
[1:07:58] inner part of us you know it's just like
[1:08:00] when the first Exodus was was pronounced
[1:08:03] there and you're in Egypt the you know
[1:08:06] the token wasn't applied to win yo when
[1:08:08] Moses went out and did all the plays and
[1:08:10] did all the great outward things and you
[1:08:12] know the Nile turning to blood and the
[1:08:14] Flies and the frogs and the whatever it
[1:08:16] was the token came into the family it
[1:08:19] was applied to the house riders applied
[1:08:21] to the ER and you know the inner inner
[1:08:23] family life there's where the blood was
[1:08:25] really applied to it wasn't the outward
[1:08:27] bits it was in the in the inward bits
[1:08:29] that's why this message showed to me
[1:08:31] it's got to get to our address you know
[1:08:34] if it's just up here and you know
[1:08:36] thunders and and seals and you know if
[1:08:38] those things don't come down here
[1:08:40] it's just theory but if that comes down
[1:08:43] here it'll be a reality amen so you know
[1:08:46] that's why this is
[1:08:48] just where I'm going so can we drive now
[1:08:52] this is now this is just what came to me
[1:08:54] now though this is so to me the message
[1:08:57] has got to be everyday life how does it
[1:09:00] apply to me now this photo is as the
[1:09:03] Allied fighter command during world war
[1:09:06] ii during the battle of britain so so so
[1:09:08] here they are and they're armed you know
[1:09:10] this is this is the English coast here I
[1:09:13] think this is the you know this is the
[1:09:14] fringes the English Channel in there and
[1:09:16] they're talking about different fighters
[1:09:18] and you know where the bases are and
[1:09:19] moving the moving the fighters around
[1:09:22] and this is the missions they've got to
[1:09:23] do and stuff this is the Allied command
[1:09:25] you know now it's very easy to just talk
[1:09:27] about you know on on that kind of level
[1:09:29] you know we'll have the space here this
[1:09:32] radar here and hallelujah and this is
[1:09:34] going to happen and you know but what if
[1:09:36] you're a pilot and all you know is this
[1:09:39] but now I say okay okay suit up
[1:09:42] we're gonna go fight the Nazis and
[1:09:45] you're gonna drive one of these this is
[1:09:48] a Supermarine Spitfire oh but it was
[1:09:52] wonderful talking about it here but yeah
[1:09:55] and it's always something with
[1:09:56] something's like a far-off we can
[1:09:58] rejoice so we can say glory and
[1:10:00] hallelujah but then when it comes on
[1:10:02] home as though all this gets a bit
[1:10:04] personal and I prayed the would it just
[1:10:05] be personal I want to be a person I
[1:10:07] don't want to you know I don't want to
[1:10:09] look at a bunch of glazed over eyes and
[1:10:11] faces and you know he'll be done at
[1:10:13] about that time and we'll go out and
[1:10:15] what's for lunch and you know don't miss
[1:10:17] your blessing don't miss what God God
[1:10:19] could change your life now so we don't
[1:10:21] want our we want to be coming close a
[1:10:23] Lord speak to my heart today change my
[1:10:26] you know change my ways of thinking in
[1:10:28] my heart and so it's easy to do that
[1:10:30] right but then you go okay today you're
[1:10:32] gonna get in that and that's the cockpit
[1:10:34] now it's easier to say hallelujah there
[1:10:41] it gets a bit daunting Dawn daunting
[1:10:44] there right then but wait but when you
[1:10:48] jump in there oh boy
[1:10:51] where do you put the key you know daddy
[1:10:54] okay but the thing is if you know how
[1:10:58] this works then that's easy and that's
[1:11:03] real easy right that's actually the
[1:11:06] least of your worries
[1:11:08] amen so you know it's the same thing
[1:11:10] with the Word of God we're going to know
[1:11:12] how the devil works brother em scissors
[1:11:13] like it's like a boxer you know trains
[1:11:16] against their opponent and you see good
[1:11:18] sports teams they take footage of their
[1:11:20] opponents and they study they have a
[1:11:22] team of coaches and they study different
[1:11:24] players and how they act on the field
[1:11:26] and their different moves and all their
[1:11:28] even the subconscious things that
[1:11:30] players will do they will study it down
[1:11:32] to the nth degree and that's how they
[1:11:34] win right it's not the 90 minutes on the
[1:11:37] field that you win it's actually the
[1:11:39] preparation beforehand amen and it's the
[1:11:41] same thing even even with us if we don't
[1:11:44] know what our opponent does well say oh
[1:11:46] we're going at a rapture then what and
[1:11:48] we're on the ground or what happened
[1:11:51] there and we get caught up in some
[1:11:52] emotion or some fantasy like I did
[1:11:55] becoming a doctor you know because I
[1:11:57] watch the TV show oh boy
[1:12:02] I did know this is true the sex I'm not
[1:12:04] making this up this was me you know and
[1:12:07] we'll get caught up in some fantasy
[1:12:09] world and the devil's just taking us
[1:12:11] down some garden path and we'll end up
[1:12:14] with disappointment but if we know what
[1:12:17] he's doing
[1:12:18] then we can jump in the cockpit we can
[1:12:21] shoot him down do a victory lap and land
[1:12:23] you know we can we can do our fighter
[1:12:26] mission then we're done I mean the you
[1:12:31] know you're the word says in Psalms 119
[1:12:33] 100 105 how sweet of our words I don't
[1:12:36] think this is here know how how sweet of
[1:12:38] our words under the under my taste yes
[1:12:41] we do that honey to my mouth through thy
[1:12:44] precepts I get understanding therefore I
[1:12:46] hate every false way thy word is a lamp
[1:12:48] unto my feet and a light unto my path we
[1:12:51] need light in this day it's dark it's
[1:12:53] real dark you know we you know I was at
[1:12:56] Friday night
[1:12:57] you know the strokes came over and and
[1:12:59] and by the time they called me Cosway
[1:13:01] and home it was foggy then you see this
[1:13:03] valley manic
[1:13:04] through foggy and without lights that's
[1:13:07] just pea soup and you'll you'll hit
[1:13:08] something even though you may think I
[1:13:10] know the road and how it turns and you
[1:13:12] know but if you don't know where the
[1:13:14] road is because of the lights you'll
[1:13:16] crash into something that's like this
[1:13:17] you may say oh yeah I know the way I'm
[1:13:20] going it's all sorted out yeah but
[1:13:21] without the light of the word to shine
[1:13:23] on your path you're just you're just
[1:13:24] driving because of a knowledge as
[1:13:27] opposed to a reality amen so we want to
[1:13:33] see the message as I said it's got to
[1:13:36] come down to where we live if it doesn't
[1:13:39] then there's nothing more than theory or
[1:13:41] theology or a philosophy or an exchange
[1:13:44] of conceptual ideas who wants that today
[1:13:47] I'm glad every but no one said Amen I
[1:13:51] mean you know you know like the
[1:13:53] scripture says in 2nd Timothy 4 and 3 it
[1:13:55] says for the time will come when they
[1:13:57] will not endure sound doctrine but after
[1:13:59] their own lusts shall they heap to
[1:14:00] themselves teachers having itching ears
[1:14:02] the Internet makes it very very easily
[1:14:05] to do you don't have to travel you can
[1:14:07] just log in and keep yourself teachers
[1:14:09] because you want to hear something new
[1:14:11] but then how does it come down to your
[1:14:14] everyday life you know Paul would go to
[1:14:16] Athens and now nothing against the
[1:14:18] Athenians or or the Greeks in any way
[1:14:20] but but but the culture of Athens in
[1:14:22] that day was everyone just sat around
[1:14:24] waiting to hear something new it says in
[1:14:27] acts 17 19 to 21 and they took him
[1:14:30] taking Paul and brought him unto Aereo
[1:14:34] faggus however he say his name saying
[1:14:36] may we know what this new dot may may we
[1:14:40] know what this new doctrine we're of our
[1:14:43] speakers is for there bring a certain
[1:14:46] strange things to our ears that we would
[1:14:49] know therefore what these things mean
[1:14:50] for all the Athenians and strangers
[1:14:52] which were and which were there spent
[1:14:56] their time and nothing else but either
[1:14:58] to tell or to hear something new and
[1:15:00] that's how we can even become I want to
[1:15:04] hear something new and sure these may be
[1:15:06] new things to hear but you know if we're
[1:15:07] just chasing after something that's a
[1:15:09] little bit different and they just sit
[1:15:10] around doing this where was the everyday
[1:15:12] life where was the actual Christianity
[1:15:15] in motion I'll put it that way you know
[1:15:17] so so we don't want to
[1:15:18] just become that way I mean but but we
[1:15:20] wanted to actually affect our character
[1:15:22] affect our everyday life you know this
[1:15:24] word we hear will mold us and shape us
[1:15:26] that you know will people will see Jesus
[1:15:28] don't we want that now amen now as I
[1:15:36] said my subject today is real love going
[1:15:39] beyond the crush now the definition for
[1:15:42] the word crush this is just mr. Google
[1:15:45] Toby so says a brief but intense
[1:15:48] infatuation for someone especially
[1:15:51] someone unobtainable that's what a crush
[1:15:55] is a brief intense infatuation you know
[1:15:58] and and we know it's all part of human
[1:16:00] development right it's all part of your
[1:16:02] emotional development you know when
[1:16:04] you're about yay big girls are yucky you
[1:16:08] know but then you get a certain age
[1:16:09] kills aren't so yucky why because you're
[1:16:11] going from a boy to a man right and then
[1:16:14] you have a crush on one in the next
[1:16:15] minute you know you forget that one then
[1:16:18] you have a yo this is the one you love
[1:16:20] this one well you think you do you
[1:16:21] forget that one and then there's this
[1:16:23] one or this one
[1:16:24] you know and it's like but why cuz it's
[1:16:27] a brief but intense infatuation I mean
[1:16:31] but when you find the real one
[1:16:33] hallelujah glory to God Amen it's not a
[1:16:37] it's not just a crush that comes and
[1:16:39] goes and anchors and it just gets better
[1:16:42] and better all the time
[1:16:43] I'm out of trust you married ones know
[1:16:45] what I'm talking about
[1:16:46] Holly why because it's gone beyond a
[1:16:48] crash to a real love see it crushed just
[1:16:52] lasts for a moment amen
[1:16:55] if one even over the age of I don't know
[1:16:57] you know she'd know what I'm talking
[1:16:58] about here yeah you know that's like you
[1:17:02] get so caught up in sight now we know
[1:17:03] this is not just about people but it can
[1:17:07] be about things be about hobbies be
[1:17:10] about places to live different jobs all
[1:17:12] those it should be a brief I want to do
[1:17:14] this now and then next minute I saw I
[1:17:16] don't want to do this is dumb yes you
[1:17:20] know it's just it's just this kind of
[1:17:22] way cuz the brief intense oh yes and
[1:17:24] both but what's the problem as someone
[1:17:26] being led by their emotion as opposed to
[1:17:29] God leading them maybe the Word of God
[1:17:31] discerns
[1:17:31] it divides asunder spirit and soul so it
[1:17:35] actually can actually make a demarcation
[1:17:36] between this is just your feelings and
[1:17:39] this is your soul this is the word of
[1:17:41] God abiding in your soul guiding you
[1:17:42] because the devil tries to make it all
[1:17:44] mix into one and just live for the
[1:17:47] moment live in the now you know and the
[1:17:50] problem is our society is engineered in
[1:17:52] such a way that that's we are
[1:17:54] conditioned to to be such but I'll say
[1:17:57] life is not just a tick-tock video right
[1:18:00] it's not just a five-minute clip on you
[1:18:02] know you know on YouTube or something on
[1:18:04] Instagram or you know that's not how
[1:18:06] life is and people who are your
[1:18:09] influences they just show you this part
[1:18:11] of their life this small little fraction
[1:18:14] but they put it out there and and the
[1:18:16] thing is because the world is flooded
[1:18:17] with that those kind of people then what
[1:18:19] happens then there then our emotions
[1:18:21] begin to go and say I wish I could have
[1:18:22] what they had and you don't know that
[1:18:26] they just spent you know they're on the
[1:18:28] verge of burnout because they're running
[1:18:30] out of material and they're all stressed
[1:18:32] and they've got to find this and it's
[1:18:33] just you know there's just one big
[1:18:35] pressure pressure cooker of a life or
[1:18:37] but I want that what's happened and a
[1:18:39] big your emotions are being been grabbed
[1:18:42] by fantasy world and this isn't just
[1:18:47] with young people this is this is all of
[1:18:48] us and I say why do people have midlife
[1:18:50] crisis and they go buy some big crazy
[1:18:53] Carroll they go do some crates like
[1:18:55] their life can just go on and then bomb
[1:18:57] what's happened it's because our lives
[1:18:59] change it's not just us when we go them
[1:19:01] from from children to to adults but you
[1:19:04] know we go through your women go through
[1:19:05] middle you know menopause and your men
[1:19:08] go through the same kind of thing you
[1:19:10] know there's a change in life every so
[1:19:11] often and and we're going to be real
[1:19:14] careful when we come up to those changes
[1:19:17] you know because unless the Lord guides
[1:19:20] us through it you know brother Ram I
[1:19:22] heard brother brown tell him talk about
[1:19:24] sister heady right sister Edith I think
[1:19:26] it was and you know she was she was well
[1:19:29] she was in a wheelchair but there wasn't
[1:19:30] a problem at that time she was you know
[1:19:32] all thought she was dying and you're all
[1:19:35] stressed and troubled and things and
[1:19:36] brother and said you know she's just
[1:19:38] going through menopause you should go
[1:19:40] down go go down visitor you know sit
[1:19:42] with her tell her she's looking good
[1:19:43] she's fine and you
[1:19:45] you know trying and Carriger you hear it
[1:19:47] on tape who said that what because she's
[1:19:50] going through that struggle and it
[1:19:52] wasn't because she wasn't a believer
[1:19:53] it's just because she's trapped in this
[1:19:55] thing that's the same thing with us you
[1:19:57] know we are we are not immune from from
[1:20:00] change in age you know you know life is
[1:20:02] a constant change as I said I think last
[1:20:05] Sunday you know many of us want to go
[1:20:07] back to our childhood and we've taken a
[1:20:09] snapshot in our mind of our favorite
[1:20:11] part of our childhood and we want to go
[1:20:13] live in that but actually what it is is
[1:20:15] just a composite of different nice
[1:20:18] memories merged into one and the reality
[1:20:21] of where you were and what you remember
[1:20:22] can be two different things right
[1:20:25] because also you were thinking with a
[1:20:26] child's mind back then you don't know
[1:20:29] the struggles of your parents you know
[1:20:30] what was going on maybe in the nation or
[1:20:32] in the neighborhood or whatever you're
[1:20:33] just living in this little bot bubble
[1:20:35] you thought if I could only go back and
[1:20:37] live in that we can't go back living
[1:20:38] that we can't go back living up us we're
[1:20:41] going to keep walking on you know we you
[1:20:44] know even even families we know brother
[1:20:46] and says this this your families go
[1:20:48] through day times and they go through
[1:20:49] night times everything's running fine
[1:20:51] then it's like they hit the side of the
[1:20:53] road and go along the gravel it's a
[1:20:55] nighttime there's trouble there goes
[1:20:56] daytime again he says always those
[1:20:58] things kind of run they meant so but we
[1:21:01] you know we just got to keep walking on
[1:21:03] we're gonna stay balanced in a very
[1:21:05] unbalanced world and it's our emotions
[1:21:08] because this world is so supercharged by
[1:21:10] emotion feelings and they're there's
[1:21:12] nothing you know you're like a crushed
[1:21:14] people but thing is you know those
[1:21:16] things can last beyond just a brief
[1:21:18] moment to actually for quite a while
[1:21:20] years you know people will start
[1:21:22] relationships just because they hooked
[1:21:24] up or they just like each other and they
[1:21:25] just see where it goes that is never
[1:21:28] gonna last
[1:21:29] that is never oh he's got such nice big
[1:21:32] feet or his nose is smaller you know
[1:21:34] that's why you know why do you like her
[1:21:36] while she's got black here and when
[1:21:37] heaps of other people gobble you know
[1:21:39] but but there's nothing there's it's
[1:21:41] only a emotional connection physical
[1:21:44] connection there's nothing deeper than
[1:21:46] that that will hold them right but I
[1:21:48] think oh this is how it is because what
[1:21:50] I see in the movies and it's just like
[1:21:51] I'm in a movie you don't want to be
[1:21:52] trapped in a movie or some awesome
[1:21:55] podcast or something on Netflix or
[1:21:57] whatever streaming channel there is
[1:21:59] you know you don't want to be caught up
[1:22:00] ah that's how life is no that's not even
[1:22:02] how their lives are I think I told you
[1:22:04] you know he's they're flatmates that
[1:22:06] love Shortland Street and they used to
[1:22:08] watch it you know religiously every day
[1:22:10] and then the Omnibus on the weekend you
[1:22:15] know but they would be so outraged when
[1:22:18] characters would do things I can't
[1:22:20] believe he did that I can't believe she
[1:22:21] cheated on him I can't believe this
[1:22:22] happened
[1:22:23] and I'm like number one it's a script
[1:22:28] number two if that was just boring
[1:22:31] everyday life do you think people would
[1:22:33] watch it you know if you know people are
[1:22:36] just watching some say that's just what
[1:22:38] I go through every day well turn them
[1:22:40] enough we'll go do something else people
[1:22:42] want an escape you know but they got so
[1:22:46] engrossed with these characters they
[1:22:47] were so outraged when they did stuff you
[1:22:50] know why because they're emotionally
[1:22:52] involved with a TV show just like I was
[1:22:54] with scrubs wanting to be a doctor lord
[1:22:58] help us Esau I'll never end up on that
[1:23:01] path okay good luck you know this is
[1:23:10] everyone with me today I trust you're
[1:23:13] thinking a bit deep what's guiding me
[1:23:15] Lord remember the decisions you make now
[1:23:17] you will be in five years the decisions
[1:23:20] you make right now you will be in five
[1:23:21] years time you know sometimes you say
[1:23:23] how did I end up like this well five
[1:23:25] years ago you made a decision and you
[1:23:27] started walking a certain way and this
[1:23:29] is what the result of your decision is
[1:23:30] that so should be lured by your may my
[1:23:32] choices be your choices my decisions be
[1:23:35] based on your word and nothing else
[1:23:37] no not how I feel if I'm up from down
[1:23:40] left the right lord I just want to walk
[1:23:42] with you
[1:23:45] amen so as I said human development a
[1:23:50] crash is part of normal human
[1:23:53] development but this world has been
[1:23:55] engineered to keep us all teenagers just
[1:23:59] going from one thing to one thing to one
[1:24:00] thing to one thing try this do this do
[1:24:02] this play this through the stop this you
[1:24:04] know that's how society has been
[1:24:06] engineered
[1:24:07] that's stability you you look at
[1:24:09] unfortunate people's lives are very
[1:24:11] unstable why
[1:24:12] because they've been engineered a
[1:24:13] certain way remember the reason we think
[1:24:16] the way we think in this country is
[1:24:18] because of this country right the
[1:24:21] culture the socio economics whatever the
[1:24:23] founding whatever documents all those
[1:24:26] things we think a certain way because of
[1:24:28] it but if I was raised in Australia it
[1:24:31] just wouldn't be my accent that would be
[1:24:33] different or if I was raised in South
[1:24:35] Africa cuz my dad's from Cape Town I
[1:24:36] would think a different way or if I was
[1:24:38] from America or Canada or Europe if
[1:24:40] we're in Switzerland would think a
[1:24:41] certain way because of the spirit and
[1:24:43] the culture and the place but when we
[1:24:46] are born again right I have a Kiwi
[1:24:49] passport but I'm not a Kiwi no more
[1:24:51] right physically maybe yes but but my
[1:24:55] daddy's in heaven right so I'm not a
[1:24:57] white man I'm not I'm not a Kiwi I'm I'm
[1:25:00] a child of God and that's my identity
[1:25:02] that's what I want to be identified with
[1:25:04] when everything's said and done
[1:25:06] hallelujah and that speak and and what I
[1:25:09] love that's why I love about this
[1:25:10] message you go anywhere around the world
[1:25:12] and you find people of the same spirit
[1:25:14] you know I was with I was with brother
[1:25:17] Adrian in Vanuatu once upon a time and
[1:25:19] we were we were in Port Vila and we went
[1:25:21] to a pastor's house and and so his wife
[1:25:26] did not speak English she spoke French
[1:25:28] because Vanuatu the course is all the
[1:25:31] local languages but because of the
[1:25:33] French and the and the British they they
[1:25:35] colonize parts of the island half them
[1:25:37] speak English and half them speak French
[1:25:39] and she didn't speak English and but but
[1:25:42] I could speak a bit of both Lama because
[1:25:44] I knew pigeon from from Papua New Guinea
[1:25:46] and we had this very broken up
[1:25:47] conversation about the Lord and it was
[1:25:49] glorious why cuz the spirits the same
[1:25:52] you know and as any yeah you go to
[1:25:55] Africa same spirit same kind of people
[1:25:57] he come here saying go be able to rally
[1:25:59] the same kind of people Papa you get any
[1:26:00] same kind of people you know I met
[1:26:02] people in Papua New Guinea and they and
[1:26:04] they they they live in the back of the
[1:26:06] back of the beyond rural rural rural you
[1:26:09] know just like barely generators working
[1:26:11] kind of you know you meet them all you
[1:26:14] just have a great time why because it's
[1:26:16] the same huts the Holy Ghost same
[1:26:19] citizenship same language Amen same same
[1:26:22] founding document you know holy same
[1:26:25] outlook on life
[1:26:27] amen but we must never let anything
[1:26:29] divide that amen so so the effect of you
[1:26:34] know there's been a lot of studies done
[1:26:37] where we're now we're living with a
[1:26:39] generation of men in the world that
[1:26:42] emotionally still boys because of the
[1:26:45] effect of gaming social media internet
[1:26:47] culture and those things that we have
[1:26:48] today whether we like it or not and it
[1:26:51] says the millennial generation which is
[1:26:52] me and younger so we're to say Lord take
[1:26:58] us beyond just being a boy man you know
[1:27:01] we don't want to be a bunch of boy men
[1:27:02] we don't want to raise our sons and now
[1:27:04] I can say that because of having one I
[1:27:07] don't want to raise my son as a boy man
[1:27:09] you know sits on his computer all day or
[1:27:11] does that y'all just just just wants to
[1:27:13] have fun all day and you know nothing
[1:27:15] serious and you know we want to say lord
[1:27:18] help us to raise our family sure they're
[1:27:21] kids they can have fun but when they get
[1:27:22] older when you become an adult you put
[1:27:25] away childish things yeah so you know
[1:27:29] help us Lord amen so it can be it's not
[1:27:35] just young people that are fashioned
[1:27:38] this way it's old people now you know
[1:27:41] yeah anyway we'll leave that one see
[1:27:45] real love doesn't shift it has a real
[1:27:48] resting place it's not based on
[1:27:51] circumstance
[1:27:52] it's not based on appearance it's not
[1:27:54] based on money or no money wonderful
[1:27:57] mirror you know heaps of travel no
[1:27:59] travel big car no car broken car doesn't
[1:28:04] matter about those things
[1:28:05] real love is not based on that you're
[1:28:07] going through a hard time you go through
[1:28:09] it together you guys are a good time you
[1:28:11] go through it together you guys through
[1:28:13] a trouble time you go through it
[1:28:14] together you stay together because love
[1:28:16] keeps you together hallelujah so real
[1:28:20] love is very different to what the world
[1:28:22] calls love today cuz what the world
[1:28:24] calls love today is just a crush always
[1:28:27] so in love Nick minute I can't stand
[1:28:29] that guy hold on what went wrong from
[1:28:32] here to here actually the beginning was
[1:28:34] wrong because the beginning the
[1:28:36] relationship wasn't built on the Word of
[1:28:38] God it was actually built on just
[1:28:39] attraction
[1:28:40] let's see where this goes yo so many
[1:28:42] people they just live together for years
[1:28:43] then I should we get married uh yeah
[1:28:46] that the kind of just stumbling along in
[1:28:48] something with no plan no goal what's
[1:28:51] the what do you want at the end of the
[1:28:52] day what are you looking for because
[1:28:55] remember the ones we marry are actually
[1:28:57] a reflection of our character the ones
[1:29:00] are attracted to actually reflecting our
[1:29:01] character I mean so if you're attracted
[1:29:05] to someone in the world well that's
[1:29:07] probably what's in you but if you're
[1:29:08] attracted to someone who's real godly
[1:29:10] who knows the Lord that's the one you
[1:29:11] want because that one will stick with
[1:29:12] you through thick and thin amen now
[1:29:16] brother Brahim says here in divine love
[1:29:17] and sovereign grace he says and when
[1:29:20] that poor fellow standing there in the
[1:29:22] depths of my soul I felt so for him now
[1:29:24] this was the maniac who wanted to kill
[1:29:25] him and just as I was feeling sorry the
[1:29:27] Holy Spirit began to speak and the man
[1:29:29] fell across my feet it's wonderful to
[1:29:31] see what God can do in love love as the
[1:29:34] mightiest force there is amen
[1:29:36] do you know God is love he that loveth
[1:29:39] is of God now I don't mean affectionate
[1:29:41] love I mean godly love affectionate love
[1:29:44] creates lust but what I'm talking about
[1:29:47] is godly love real love you say well you
[1:29:54] know where is it there was a there was a
[1:29:56] man one day and and and he took a step
[1:29:59] wrong and he ended up living in tombs
[1:30:01] he's a maniac he is demon possessed
[1:30:05] he got enticed by something and it took
[1:30:09] him down that road
[1:30:10] he wasn't one day saying normal normal
[1:30:12] part of society Nick minute he's there
[1:30:14] that was he opened a door by an issue
[1:30:17] what happens when people get caught up
[1:30:20] in something like you know something
[1:30:22] they can't obtain they actually open a
[1:30:24] door to a spirit and that spirit there
[1:30:26] begins to lead them down a path it's
[1:30:29] never it's never actually to be you know
[1:30:31] a helpful part of the family that's
[1:30:34] never to be actually a helpful part of
[1:30:35] society until actually what can I get to
[1:30:38] actually feed this thickness that's
[1:30:39] leading me a mint and and and even it
[1:30:43] says here in Luke I believe it says that
[1:30:45] the spurts drove him down there the
[1:30:48] spirit and him drove him into the tombs
[1:30:50] so he has been driven by something as I
[1:30:54] that's what put that quote up we're all
[1:30:55] led by something and the spirits lead
[1:30:57] him to become isolated to cut himself
[1:31:02] liver and where death was this is you
[1:31:06] know he didn't he didn't he wasn't born
[1:31:07] in that condition he ended up in that
[1:31:09] condition because he opened the door to
[1:31:10] something right so so the spirit led him
[1:31:13] there to be isolated and that's why the
[1:31:15] thing is we're going to be real careful
[1:31:17] when we become real isolated within our
[1:31:18] own families I'm just going through
[1:31:21] something I'm just dealing with zero I'm
[1:31:22] just and it becomes this very internal
[1:31:25] looking kind of life we can't become
[1:31:28] that way that's dangerous and because
[1:31:32] because it it starts with I'm just
[1:31:33] dealing with this and then it goes to
[1:31:35] know and understands me and then you
[1:31:37] just begin to withdraw from the ones
[1:31:38] that can actually help you right and
[1:31:41] then if you can't find help from them
[1:31:43] because or they don't understand me I'm
[1:31:45] gonna stay over of them you'll find out
[1:31:46] from something and that issue that
[1:31:48] actually crowd that open door the spirit
[1:31:50] comes in and it will draw you somewhere
[1:31:51] else and you don't actually get help
[1:31:53] from that thing but member spirits come
[1:31:55] great together so lord help us oh here
[1:32:02] we are I'm glad there's someone
[1:32:05] tech-support prays a lot and they
[1:32:07] arrived at the country of the gadarenes
[1:32:09] which is over against Galilee and when
[1:32:11] he went forth to land they meet him out
[1:32:13] of they met him out of the city a
[1:32:15] certain man which had Devils long time
[1:32:18] and wear no clothes neither abode in any
[1:32:20] house but in the tombs and when he saw
[1:32:24] Jesus he cried out fell down before him
[1:32:25] and with the loud voice said what have I
[1:32:27] to do with thee Jesus thou son of God
[1:32:29] Most High I beseech thee torment me not
[1:32:31] for he had commanded the unclean spirit
[1:32:33] to come out of the man for oftimes it
[1:32:35] had caught him and it he was kept bound
[1:32:38] with chains upon me and in fetters and
[1:32:40] he break the bans and was driven of the
[1:32:42] devil until the wilderness spirits drive
[1:32:47] people to do things you know I you know
[1:32:52] I might be wrong about this but I
[1:32:53] remember reading an article about the
[1:32:55] there was a there was a guy in Norway
[1:32:57] that killed a hundred odd hundred and
[1:32:58] forty odd people youth at a camp a few
[1:33:01] years back with a you know just just
[1:33:03] machine gun them and and and he said
[1:33:06] well
[1:33:07] right about him that actually before he
[1:33:09] went to go do the thing he kept being
[1:33:11] sick and he didn't want to do burners
[1:33:12] like something just drove him to do it
[1:33:14] was the spirit the demon spirit drove
[1:33:17] him to do it you know it's not really
[1:33:20] man is not really made to kill one
[1:33:22] another it's got to be a spirit or
[1:33:25] saying they she to take life that that
[1:33:28] comes into us now I just want to wait I
[1:33:36] want to read this account now here's a
[1:33:39] young lady and and she's actually living
[1:33:43] in an illusion because of hurt a young
[1:33:47] lady last night in an interview she said
[1:33:49] and she said a minister's daughter had
[1:33:52] had some kind of a little love affair
[1:33:53] and she had lost her mind about it she'd
[1:33:56] gone a breakdown a very beautiful young
[1:33:58] woman and about 23 years old and when
[1:34:00] she was a little girl about 12 she was
[1:34:02] in Chicago and sitting in the meeting or
[1:34:04] Elgon that was and sitting in the
[1:34:06] meeting and the Holy Spirit went out
[1:34:08] through the audience and called her who
[1:34:10] she was and said you've got a murmuring
[1:34:11] heart the doctor says you can't live to
[1:34:13] 15 years old but thus saith the Lord
[1:34:15] you're healed she never even left even
[1:34:17] so she never even felt a heart trouble
[1:34:20] since but last night she had a different
[1:34:23] kind of a heart trouble it was a
[1:34:25] spiritual heart trouble her lover had
[1:34:27] run off and married some other woman and
[1:34:29] yet she was still in love and this boy
[1:34:32] telling that he was in love yet with her
[1:34:35] and his father had caused it I said Oh
[1:34:39] nonsense he didn't have to marry the
[1:34:41] other girl he did it because he failed
[1:34:43] to have the right kind of love for you
[1:34:46] so so so here's this girl 23 years old
[1:34:49] had a breakdown had broken heart because
[1:34:52] someone who said that he loved her
[1:34:54] basically lied to her had just had an
[1:34:57] infatuation had a crush and when I
[1:34:59] married someone else but he's trying to
[1:35:01] say no it's my dad cause this that's a
[1:35:03] lie but someone is just trying to cover
[1:35:06] themselves but no see he's but the
[1:35:10] reason is he fell to have the right kind
[1:35:12] of love for you he can seem so real so
[1:35:14] oh well yeah this is just us as how
[1:35:16] we're gonna be next minute what's
[1:35:18] happened but see but
[1:35:21] see now see that's exactly but see being
[1:35:23] all wound up into that the girl sit in
[1:35:26] there in such a stupid oh I know Johnny
[1:35:29] loves me I know see that's all she could
[1:35:32] see she lived in one little world by
[1:35:35] herself she formed herself in there see
[1:35:39] she didn't start this way but because of
[1:35:42] her she ended up this way because she
[1:35:45] became so obsessed with this Johnny that
[1:35:47] she believed loved her but yet the
[1:35:49] reality was he didn't love her he went
[1:35:52] and married someone else that was the
[1:35:54] reality because she was so caught up in
[1:35:55] her mind about it she says I know Johnny
[1:35:58] loves me and she makes fun little world
[1:35:59] and she just came just in this little
[1:36:01] bubble by herself he say well that will
[1:36:06] that can't happen
[1:36:07] it does happen this is the power of the
[1:36:10] human spirit when it's even been wounded
[1:36:13] he'll get caught up in a fantasy world I
[1:36:15] say but there's healing there's healing
[1:36:18] for these things
[1:36:19] I mean it's what I love about there's no
[1:36:21] case God can't fix I mean there's no one
[1:36:24] that God can't put right there's no one
[1:36:26] that God can actually make them from
[1:36:28] unbalance to balanced again and I took
[1:36:32] her by the hand I said listen to me and
[1:36:34] the Lord showed me a vision you see that
[1:36:36] she know do I know nothing about that
[1:36:38] something had taken place some
[1:36:40] transaction between them and when that
[1:36:42] was said then that snapped her right
[1:36:45] quick and I pray God would just snap
[1:36:46] some of us out of things I mean I said
[1:36:49] now while you're out of that look to
[1:36:51] Calvary there you're going out here and
[1:36:53] trying to drink and Anna ministers
[1:36:55] daughter of Pentecostal ministers
[1:36:56] daughter and doing the things you're
[1:36:58] doing trying to drown that sorrow that
[1:37:01] man and somebody that don't care the
[1:37:03] snap of their finger for you I said look
[1:37:05] yonder the Calvary girl that's the only
[1:37:07] way back we got to get to ourselves
[1:37:10] focus to whether we live or die single
[1:37:13] drown as Calvary Christ that's the thing
[1:37:16] God wants us to come back to us I mean
[1:37:19] so she is trying to drown her sorrow
[1:37:20] living in this world by herself oh I
[1:37:22] know he loves me drinking away drinking
[1:37:25] away the sorrow instead of coming out of
[1:37:27] it that's why the Lord discerned
[1:37:29] something in her life that snapped her
[1:37:30] out of it she actually came back to
[1:37:31] herself while her spirit was wandering
[1:37:34] wandering around it wasn't in reality is
[1:37:36] all caught up in this little life and
[1:37:38] she just tried to drown her pain the
[1:37:40] wrong way and then but God came on the
[1:37:42] scene and she snapped out of I said now
[1:37:44] look to this don't look to the bottle
[1:37:46] don't look to your fantasy world look to
[1:37:47] look to the cross where you can really
[1:37:50] get healing and deliverance hallelujah
[1:37:54] amen
[1:37:56] and maybe I'll just I'll just leave it
[1:38:00] there
[1:38:01] let's friends don't get caught up in a
[1:38:03] fantasy world don't get caught up in
[1:38:06] some great no the devil will will will
[1:38:08] will offer you the world but it'll give
[1:38:10] you none of it and it's just like a
[1:38:13] carrot dangled before a donkey and the
[1:38:15] donkey can never get the carrot but it
[1:38:18] will do everything it can to get the
[1:38:19] carrot don't look to those things we've
[1:38:22] all been hurt before thing you yeah
[1:38:24] that's the thing about living in this
[1:38:26] world we get hurt we get wounded there's
[1:38:28] misunderstandings people you know come
[1:38:30] and even intentionally just use us and
[1:38:32] throw us on the roadside and you know
[1:38:34] but don't look to those things look to
[1:38:37] Calvary look to your deliverance
[1:38:40] I mean don't don't don't live in a
[1:38:43] fantasy world you say well this is this
[1:38:47] is all kind of very different maybe it
[1:38:49] is but it's not
[1:38:52] we need real love not a fake love this
[1:38:57] world is just all full of fake love you
[1:39:01] know it's just all of us don't get
[1:39:03] caught up in it
[1:39:04] get real love now brother Graham sees
[1:39:10] this here I can find it
[1:39:17] this is from enticing spirits they'll
[1:39:22] finish with this with our heads bowed
[1:39:24] just a moment absolutely with our heads
[1:39:29] bowed just a moment I wonder if there's
[1:39:31] someone here this morning
[1:39:32] his brother Brown I'm sick of tired of
[1:39:34] these little old things he's sick of
[1:39:37] living in a fantasy world he's sick of
[1:39:40] living in this idea that he could never
[1:39:41] obtain that's not even real he's sick of
[1:39:44] living there you want a real life you're
[1:39:47] gonna have a but real life is boring in
[1:39:48] a real life is wonderful real life is
[1:39:51] the best life that's the only life there
[1:39:53] is it's not living through a computer
[1:39:55] screen living off you know the internet
[1:39:57] it's actually real life I'm sick and
[1:40:01] tired of these little old things I've
[1:40:03] got pity things that have hang on me so
[1:40:06] long I'm always talking out of turn I'm
[1:40:09] doing things I shouldn't do and I know
[1:40:11] it's not becoming of a Christian I don't
[1:40:13] want to do that God knows I don't and I
[1:40:15] don't want to listen to that old spirit
[1:40:17] anymore because what is it there's a
[1:40:19] spirit what was what was keeping her in
[1:40:21] that world the spirit was talking to her
[1:40:23] keeping her in that world I Johnny loves
[1:40:25] you yes he loves you I know he loves you
[1:40:27] you know keeping it that way kept her in
[1:40:29] this own little world I don't want to
[1:40:32] listen to that old spirit anymore that's
[1:40:36] a thing that's kept me down all my life
[1:40:37] a fantasy will always keep you down why
[1:40:41] do why do so many rock stars movie stars
[1:40:44] they take their lives and they glamorize
[1:40:46] it why because they because they get
[1:40:48] given the world you can be this great
[1:40:51] thing but then the brokenness and the
[1:40:54] abuse and everything that comes along
[1:40:55] with it that's never portrayed on screen
[1:40:57] the emotional damage and the scarring
[1:40:59] and the hurt that they carry and it
[1:41:01] becomes too much they begin you and many
[1:41:03] of them overdose and things at certain
[1:41:04] ages they kill themselves why because
[1:41:06] what they think they're going to obtain
[1:41:08] in the reality of it has two very
[1:41:09] different things
[1:41:10] I mean and money will never buy you
[1:41:12] happiness and will never buy you have it
[1:41:15] doesn't matter what people try and tell
[1:41:17] you yo it doesn't matter what influence
[1:41:19] it puts a picture on the internet about
[1:41:21] some great lifestyle that they have I'll
[1:41:22] never buy them happiness because always
[1:41:24] trying to live in a moment create a
[1:41:25] moment you know the great thing about
[1:41:28] traveling is the people you meet
[1:41:30] that's the thing it's not the places for
[1:41:33] people that's the thing that makes
[1:41:35] traveling actually really great it's not
[1:41:37] the places but they try and say this
[1:41:38] place is amazing and you go there you're
[1:41:41] standing on this windswept rocky peak
[1:41:42] and it's freezing and you say this
[1:41:44] doesn't look like the filter they put
[1:41:45] through their photo but people try and
[1:41:50] catch an illusion it's like a mirage you
[1:41:53] know is it oh there's water there they
[1:41:55] get to there's no water it's here it's
[1:41:57] over there people are chasing something
[1:41:58] and it keeps them down all their lives I
[1:42:02] mean it's the thing that kept me down
[1:42:05] all my life from having real love and
[1:42:06] freedom in Christ I want you to pray for

[1:42:26] brethren and don't do that I don't you
