[6:42] May God bless you saints. Welcome to the
[6:44] house of the Lord. Just stand this
[6:47] evening as we open in a word of
[6:48] [Music]
[6:54] prayer. Thank you, Lord, for this
[6:56] wonderful evening you've given us, Lord.
[6:58] That we could be here, gathered in your
[7:00] presence once again, Lord, to hear from
[7:02] you, the master and creator of all
[7:05] things, Lord Jesus. And Lord, I pray
[7:07] that you just speak to our hearts this
[7:10] evening, Lord, as we've come prepared to
[7:12] hear from you, Lord Jesus. Lord, I pray
[7:14] that it wouldn't just be a routine
[7:16] coming here, Lord, but that we'd see the
[7:19] privilege, Lord Jesus, we have to be
[7:21] able to come and to speak to you, the
[7:23] master and creator, Lord. And Lord, we
[7:26] we're so blessed, Lord Jesus, that you
[7:28] chose us, Lord. Lord, I pray you just

[7:41] you just speak to us tonight, Lord
[7:43] Jesus. We've come expected, Lord Jesus,
[7:45] to hear from you, Lord. And Lord, I pray
[7:47] you be with those that w that aren't
[7:49] here this evening. Be their portion,
[7:51] Lord Jesus. Those that are unwell, be
[7:53] with them, Lord. And pray you just heal

[8:07] It's not an
[8:09] E. Can we start with the verse,
[8:12] please? There's a light in the window
[8:17] and tables set in splendor and someone
[8:21] standing by the open
[8:25] door. And I can see a crystal river. So
[8:30] I must be near forever.
[8:33] Thought I've never been this home safe
[8:37] before. I see the bright light shine.
[8:42] It's just about
[8:45] time. I can't see my father standing at
[8:50] the
[8:51] door. This world has been
[8:54] wilderness and I'm ready for
[8:58] deliverance. Lord, I've never been this
[9:02] homesick

[9:10] sweet faces all
[9:12] familiar and no one's feeble
[9:18] anymore. And how this lonesome heart is
[9:22] crying. I'm going to spread my wings for
[9:25] flying. Lord, I've never been this home

[10:12] soul.
[10:15] And how the king of glory under has
[10:20] given me his promise. And I've never
[10:24] been this home sick
[10:28] before. And I see the right light shine.
[10:33] It's just about
[10:35] time. And I can't see my father standing
[10:40] at the door.
[10:43] This world has made a
[10:45] wilderness that I'm ready for
[10:50] deliverance. Lord, I've never been
[10:53] this before. I see the bright light. I
[10:57] see the bright
[11:00] light. It's just about
[11:03] time. And I can't see my car standing at
[11:09] the door.
[11:11] This world has been
[11:14] wild. I'm ready for
[11:18] deliverance. Lord, I've never been this
[11:22] sick

[30:17] glad that we have a captain that can get
[30:19] into the darkest places, the deepest
[30:21] dungeons, the furthest place. And David

[30:26] behold, you're there." Amen. He can come
[30:28] anywhere. Amen. He's not afraid to get
[30:30] his hands dirty. He got them bloody. He

[30:36] there. Hallelujah. Amen. Hallelujah. He
[30:38] God cares. Amen. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[30:41] Okay. I want to speak on uh the subject
[30:42] hurt not the oil and the wine. Amen. And
[30:44] so let's just read from Revelation 6:5.
[30:47] And it says, "And when he had opened the
[30:50] third seal, I heard the third beast say,
[30:54] come and see. And I beheld and lower a
[30:57] black horse. And he that sat on him had
[30:59] a pair of balances in his hand. And I
[31:03] heard a voice in the midst of the four
[31:05] beasts say, "A measure of wheat for a
[31:08] penny, and three measures of barley for
[31:10] a penny, and see that you hurt not the
[31:13] oil and the wine." Amen. You may be
[31:14] seated. Hallelujah. I'm so glad that he
[31:17] said that. Aren't you glad that the
[31:19] voice of our Lord Jesus Christ in the
[31:21] midst of any sort of chaos or pressure
[31:23] that would come on uh these people in
[31:25] this age here and you know that these
[31:27] things still happening today. But I'm so
[31:29] glad that over all of the things that
[31:32] happened in this time for these people,
[31:34] the Lord said to the devil, "Hurt not
[31:36] the oil and the wine." Amen. And so
[31:38] that's going to be our subject tonight.
[31:39] And you know, I just want to speak, you
[31:40] know, because we're in an hour where
[31:42] there is so much pressure. We're in an
[31:44] hour where there is just so much going
[31:45] on. There is so much stimulation. There
[31:48] is It's coming at us from every angle.
[31:50] It's coming at us through every screen.
[31:52] It's coming at us from every billboard,
[31:53] through every mall, through every shop,
[31:55] through every It's a drive. There's a
[31:58] drive for our intention. There's a drive
[32:00] for our affections. There's a drive and
[32:02] it's pulling us. And it's pulling our
[32:04] youth. It's pulling our children. It's
[32:06] pulling the adults. It's pulling
[32:07] everyone. It's looking. It's finding.
[32:09] It's It's designed around you. There's
[32:11] an algorithm for you. You know that.
[32:14] There's an algorithm for you. And
[32:15] there's probably a hundred of them. And
[32:16] they're aimed at you. And they're coming
[32:19] from every medium, every media, every
[32:21] angle. And they're wanting to help you
[32:23] in this world to do things for this
[32:25] world and to buy money and to spend in
[32:27] Satan's kingdom and to do all of that
[32:29] sort of stuff. But it ain't going to
[32:30] help you get up there. Amen. Hallelujah.
[32:32] It's not designed to get us up. It's not
[32:34] designed to build us up. It's designed
[32:36] to busy us. It's designed to pressure
[32:38] us. It's designed to distract us. It's
[32:41] designed to fill our minds with
[32:43] pressure. So much pressure. This is an
[32:45] hour of pressure. But let me tell you,
[32:47] God spoke a word. He said, "Hurt not the
[32:49] oil and the wine. Hurt not the oil. Hurt
[32:52] not my people getting the spirit." Amen.
[32:54] Hurt not my people getting in the
[32:56] spirit. Hurt not my people getting
[32:57] filled and refilled and refilled again.
[33:00] Amen. Hurt not that ability for my
[33:02] people to have my spirit. Hurt not the
[33:04] oil, the wine, and all these things that
[33:06] the Lord said. He gave a mandate on the
[33:08] devil. He said, "Devil, you can't touch
[33:10] my people's oil. You can't touch the oil
[33:12] of my people. You can't touch their
[33:14] baptism of the Holy Spirit. You can't
[33:16] touch their experiences in church. You
[33:18] can't touch their experiences when
[33:19] they're struggling because my oil is
[33:22] going to be poured out upon them. I'm
[33:23] going to pour it out over them so their
[33:25] cup is filled to overflowing that they
[33:27] can't even contain it. Amen. And do you
[33:29] know what the Holy Spirit is? When our
[33:31] prophet went over up into heaven and he
[33:32] came back, the Lord said, "The very Holy
[33:34] Spirit that you preach is perfect love.
[33:38] Divine love." And this is the hour of
[33:41] divine love. This is the hour where
[33:42] we're coming right up into that perfect
[33:44] love economy. That perfect love
[33:46] environment. An environment where we
[33:49] come into a higher economy where the
[33:50] pressure comes off. Where the fear
[33:52] disappears because perfect love casts
[33:54] out all fear. So there is a mandate upon
[33:57] the enemy that says hurt not my perfect
[34:00] love. Hurt not the perfect love of my
[34:02] people. Hurt not the environment. Hurt
[34:04] not the atmosphere of my people. So that
[34:06] they can be changed. They can grow. They
[34:08] can change. They can rejoice. They can
[34:10] have a They can have stimulation.
[34:12] Hallelujah. They can get in the spirit.
[34:14] Amen. Hallelujah. There's so many
[34:16] pressures. There's financial pressures.
[34:19] Amen. Oh boy, those ones are really
[34:21] tough at the moment. And we know that.
[34:22] We can feel that. We see it all over the
[34:24] country. Amen. So many pressures,
[34:26] especially in that economic realm. Amen.
[34:28] It drives us to have to work. It drives
[34:30] us to have to do so many things to try
[34:31] and make ends meet. has drives our
[34:34] families in many cases where both
[34:36] parents have to work. And so the
[34:37] children have to go and there's there's
[34:39] all these pressures that come on and
[34:41] then what do they do? They go and say,
[34:42] "Ah, you know what we'll do? We'll just
[34:44] crush it a little bit more and we'll
[34:45] make them suffer and we'll make them
[34:47] have to strive." And you know what? That
[34:49] pressure comes on. But God said, "Hurt
[34:51] not the oil and the wine. Even when
[34:52] there's pressure on, even when it's
[34:54] tough, even when you ain't got no money
[34:55] in the bank, even when you can't even
[34:57] buy food, hurt not the oil and the
[34:58] wine." There will still be a rejoicing.
[35:00] There will still be a people that have
[35:02] oil in their vessel. There will still be
[35:03] a bride that can see in the dark.
[35:06] Hallelujah. There will still be a bride
[35:08] that can rejoice and be filled and
[35:10] refilled. Amen. When our teenagers are
[35:12] struggling, there will still be oil for
[35:14] them. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. When our
[35:16] children don't know what's going on at
[35:18] school, they come back confused. There's
[35:20] oil for them. Hallelujah. There's a
[35:22] refilling for the parents that are
[35:24] striving and struggling. A refilling
[35:26] tonight. Hallelujah. If you need a
[35:28] refilling tonight, claim it. Lay hold of
[35:31] it. This is your night for a refilling.
[35:34] Amen. This is for you. Hallelujah. Hurt
[35:36] not the oil and wine. That means the
[35:38] devil can't stop you getting a refilling
[35:40] tonight. There's a mandate on the word.
[35:41] There's a mandate on him. He can't stop
[35:43] you getting a refilling. He can't stop
[35:46] you catching on fire. And you know what
[35:48] Jesus said? The fan is in his hand. As
[35:51] John the Baptist said that the fan is in
[35:53] the hand of Jesus. What is he here to
[35:54] do? Fan that fire in your life.
[35:57] Hallelujah. So that you can rejoice no
[35:59] matter how much pressure comes on you.
[36:01] No matter you got no money in the bank,
[36:03] ban that fire. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[36:05] Hallelujah. Hurt not the oil. Amen. Hurt
[36:08] not the oil. We'll get to the wine soon.
[36:10] Amen. I'll be good. I need
[36:16] drink. Praise God. Amen. Somebody's
[36:19] pulling. Hallelujah.
[36:21] Hallelujah. Somebody's pulling. Amen.
[36:25] There's financial pressure. so much
[36:26] pressure. There's social pressure, man.
[36:28] The hard one, you know, especially for
[36:29] the youth, especially for those that are
[36:31] finding who they are, looking for their
[36:34] identity. I tell you what, there's so
[36:35] many sources to try and tell us who we
[36:38] are. But let me tell you, there's one
[36:39] true source that you should look at, the
[36:43] word of God, the message of the hour.
[36:46] And those that believe it and are filled
[36:47] by the Holy Ghost that are an example,
[36:50] that's really truly, you know, this
[36:53] pressure of identity. There's your
[36:55] identity. Your identity is already
[36:56] locked up in Christ. It's locked up in
[36:58] heaven. It's already part of that
[37:00] eternal part of God. And when you
[37:02] receive the Holy Spirit, you receive
[37:03] your identity. Amen. You receive a part
[37:05] of yourself. You know, in John 14:20, it
[37:07] says that in that day. And I believe
[37:09] that that's this day. If there's any day
[37:10] that that's that day, it's this day.
[37:11] Amen. This is that which the prophet
[37:14] Joel spoke of this. Let me just clear to
[37:16] you right now. This is that. Hallelujah.
[37:19] I want you to say that. This is that.
[37:22] Amen. Say you say it with conviction.
[37:24] Amen. This is that which the prophet
[37:26] Joel spoke of. Amen. This is my true
[37:28] identity in this day. Amen. In the day,
[37:31] in that day, Jesus said when he was
[37:32] talking in John 14, he said, "You shall
[37:35] know that I am ever present in my
[37:39] father.
[37:40] You are also present in me." That's
[37:44] already good enough. That's already good
[37:46] enough. Hallelujah. Before we even say
[37:48] the next thing, that's already good
[37:50] enough. Do you know what he says? And I
[37:51] am in you. Hallelujah. Woo. Oh, that's
[37:54] some real unity right there. That's a
[37:56] real oneness of God right there.
[37:57] Hallelujah. That shows me who you are.
[38:00] And when you receive that, you find out
[38:01] who you are. You receive that part of
[38:03] you that you have been striving,
[38:05] hallelujah, to have. Hallelujah. So many
[38:08] especially coming up through because we
[38:10] cannot have an experience of mom and
[38:11] dad. We can't have the experience of
[38:14] grandma. We can't have the spirits of
[38:15] pastor. We, you know, that's their
[38:17] experience. We got to come through the
[38:19] same channels. We got to come through
[38:21] the same battles. We're going to cross
[38:23] the same Jordan. We're going to go
[38:25] through the same Red Sea. We're going to
[38:26] go through the same wilderness. But we
[38:28] get the same Jesus. We get the same
[38:30] captain in our land taking the battle.
[38:32] And he's fighting a battle. We're
[38:34] fighting a battle that he's already won.
[38:36] Hallelujah. What does it do? What is
[38:38] this? Hurt not the oil and the wine.
[38:39] Hurt not that oil. Hurt not that
[38:42] provision that I've given for my people
[38:44] to overcome. the social pressures, the
[38:47] identity pressures, the spiritual
[38:49] pressures. So many pressures, mental
[38:52] pressures. Far out. There's medicines to
[38:54] awake. There's medicines to go to sleep.
[38:56] There's medicines for everything. Image
[38:59] pressures. This image that's been raised
[39:01] up. That thing that people so desire.
[39:04] That thing that that that the world is
[39:06] chasing after. That image that's been
[39:08] raised up, you know, and that image of a
[39:10] teenager. that image of a of something
[39:13] that you've seen on that social media,
[39:15] something that you've seen on that
[39:16] platform and somebody that struck your
[39:18] attention and you liked it. You liked
[39:20] what they do, you enjoyed that and that
[39:23] image. And then what does that do? It
[39:25] puts a pressure on you. It puts a
[39:27] pressure in your life for you to try and
[39:29] become that. And you know what it is?
[39:31] It's a stimulation of your affection,
[39:33] something that you like. But take a
[39:36] pinch and go, Lord, is this you? Lord,
[39:38] where is this coming from? Who told me
[39:39] that, Lord?
[39:41] Because Eve got told something too,
[39:43] remember? That's right. And Eve was in a
[39:45] garden in Eden. She was in a perfect
[39:47] condition. And she still stopped. And
[39:50] she listened to that serpent. She
[39:51] listened to that narrative. She should
[39:53] have, you know, she should have really
[39:54] gone, "Hold on a minute. Who's talking
[39:56] to me?" Cuz even if that serpent's
[39:58] telling the truth, he's a liar. Even if
[40:00] he's telling something that seems
[40:02] resonating in my memory, true, he's a
[40:04] liar. He's a father of lies. And even if
[40:06] he's saying something that's true in
[40:08] your memory and that's been under the
[40:09] blood, he's a liar. He's a liar fully.
[40:14] So, it's always good to question who
[40:16] told you that? Who's who's saying that?
[40:18] Where does this come from? Hallelujah.
[40:21] Because if it doesn't build you up and
[40:22] build you and place you in your position
[40:24] in Christ and bring love in an
[40:25] environment of faith, then it's probably
[40:27] not the Lord. Amen. It's probably just
[40:30] some naughty old voice, some narrative,
[40:32] some image, something from YouTube,
[40:35] something from whatever other those
[40:36] platforms, man, I can't keep up with
[40:37] them. Oh my. Now, you see now this
[40:41] pressure that would come on through this
[40:42] black horse, you know, this black horse
[40:44] that came down in that age under that
[40:45] seal, you know, they really struggled.
[40:47] What did he do? He came to press the
[40:49] people down. He came to give them
[40:50] economic pressure. He came to give them
[40:52] religious pressure. They got pressure.
[40:54] They got pressure. They got pushed down
[40:56] until that church got so pressured they
[40:58] became an underground church. And that
[41:00] seed of that church went down in the
[41:02] ground and suffered and they weren't
[41:04] even allowed to read the L Bible. They
[41:06] weren't allowed to even say the Lord's
[41:07] Prayer in the native tongue. They had to
[41:09] say it in Latin. They had no idea what
[41:12] it was meaning. That's what the devil
[41:13] would do. That's what the devil desires
[41:15] to do for our people. That's what the
[41:17] devil desires to do for us to try and
[41:18] pressure us to try and push us down. But
[41:21] let me tell you, there's a mandate on
[41:22] him. Hurt not the oil. Hurt not the
[41:25] wine. Hallelujah. Hurt not my people,
[41:27] let them be filled. Let them be
[41:29] rejoicing. Let them have their free
[41:31] filling tonight. Hallelujah. Whatever
[41:34] pressure you're under today, you don't
[41:36] have to leave here under that pressure.
[41:37] You can be pressurized. Amen. You know,
[41:40] like a diver when he goes down and he
[41:42] goes into the ocean and he he has to
[41:44] equalize the pressure in his ears. Amen.
[41:46] Let me tell you what the Holy Ghost can
[41:47] do for you tonight. Let me tell you, he
[41:49] can reressurize you. He can equalize
[41:51] you. He can put you into balance. He can
[41:53] give you a balanced approach. He can
[41:55] allow you to wake up happy, go to sleep
[41:57] happy, dream happy. Oh boy, fellowship
[41:59] happy. You can just be happy all the
[42:02] time. We don't have to be miserable. We
[42:04] don't have to be down. We can be happy.
[42:06] We're meant to be happy. We're made to
[42:08] be happy. We're designed to be happy.
[42:10] And we were happy before the world
[42:11] began. And we'll be happy when it's
[42:13] finished. So, we might as well be happy
[42:14] now. Hallelujah.
[42:17] Hallelujah. Might as well just be happy.
[42:20] Hallelujah. And if there's anything
[42:22] shadowing that tonight, don't let it
[42:24] leave. You just you just cast that thing
[42:28] down and you say you that that devil,
[42:30] that that oppression, that pressure,
[42:32] that black horse weighing out the
[42:35] balances, maybe it's not financial.
[42:38] Maybe he's weighing out the balances of
[42:39] your hormones.
[42:41] weighing out the balances of your
[42:42] chemicals in your body, teenagers, older
[42:45] women, middle-aged women, should I say,
[42:48] with all of those changes in life, and
[42:50] it gets hard and the mind and the devil
[42:53] takes advantage of that identity
[42:56] crisis. Oh, let me tell you that even
[42:59] under that pressure of that black horse
[43:01] and he's weighing out the balances and
[43:02] the devil's trying to confuse, let me
[43:05] tell you, the Lord gives a mandate. Hurt
[43:07] not the oil. Be filled. Be equalized.
[43:10] Come into balance by the Holy Spirit.
[43:12] Come into balance because he's been
[43:14] told, "Hurt not the oil and the wine."
[43:18] Hallelujah. Amen. You know, I just
[43:20] highlighted this thing and I heard a
[43:22] voice, amen. Who's heard a voice in this
[43:24] hour? Who's heard a voice of the
[43:26] resurrection? Who's heard the voice,
[43:28] Amen, of the seventh angel? Who's heard
[43:30] the voice behind the voice of the
[43:32] seventh angel? And that voice brings
[43:35] life. That voice is life. That voice is
[43:38] the resurrection. Hallelujah. You heard
[43:40] a voice. John heard a voice. Have you
[43:42] placed yourself in John's shoes tonight.
[43:44] Have you placed yourself because this is
[43:46] your journey too. Well, you do have a
[43:48] that we have a dark age in our life. We
[43:50] go through those things in our life. We
[43:51] go through times where it's hard. But
[43:53] let me tell you, even when it's down and
[43:55] you're in the valley, that's your
[43:56] valley. It ain't the devil's valley. You
[43:58] don't have to give it to him. You don't
[43:59] have to bow down to his chariots. You
[44:01] don't have to bow down to his demons.
[44:03] You can own your valley and be fruitful
[44:06] in your valley by your river. Planted.
[44:11] Amen. Solid. Hallelujah. Balanced with
[44:15] nutrition. Spiritual nutrition. All day,
[44:19] all night. Planted deeply. Solid.
[44:24] I believe I'm looking at solid people
[44:26] right here. I believe I'm looking at
[44:28] timeested memorials. Amen. Because you
[44:31] know what I'm talking about. You know,
[44:33] hallelujah. But that doesn't mean that
[44:35] you don't get battles. That doesn't mean
[44:37] that you don't have struggles. We all
[44:39] do. We have our valleys. But those
[44:41] valleys are not made for you to be
[44:42] oppressed, depressed, down, and stay
[44:44] there. Those valleys are made for you to
[44:46] conquer.
[44:48] Don't we remember in the time of Joshua
[44:50] how Manise and Ephraim were complaining
[44:53] to Joshua that that they only had this
[44:55] there's this small area. And Joshua
[44:58] said, "Well, go take your bellies." Oh,
[44:59] we can't. The iron chariots are too
[45:01] many. They'll hurt us. They were afraid.
[45:03] They let fear. But let me tell you,
[45:05] there's no fear that cannot be cast out
[45:07] by perfect love right now. If you're
[45:08] afraid of something, let perfect love
[45:10] come. We're in a revival of perfect
[45:12] love. This is perfect love in our lives.
[45:14] This is what the capstone is. This is
[45:16] what Jesus is all about in this hour.
[45:19] It's to what? Cast out the fear, cast
[45:21] out the confusion, cast out the
[45:23] imbalances, bring balance, bring joy,
[45:25] bring freedom, liberty. Hallelujah.
[45:28] Hallelujah. Woo. Hallelujah. Let me look
[45:32] at this timer. Oh, good. We got five
[45:34] minutes.
[45:37] Hallelujah. This word hurt is an
[45:39] interesting word.
[45:41] Hallelujah. Remember he said that hurt
[45:43] not. He's telling the devil something
[45:45] here. This is what he's saying. You
[45:47] cannot be unjust to my oil, to my bride.
[45:52] You cannot be that hurt means to be
[45:54] unjust. This is what this word means to
[45:56] to do wrong. You cannot do wrong to this
[45:58] oil. You cannot stop this. Amen. Morally
[46:01] or socially or physically hurt to
[46:03] injure. You cannot be an offender.
[46:05] Hallelujah. To my bride. She will have
[46:07] my oil. She will enter in. She will be
[46:09] refilled when she needs it. She will
[46:11] have fellowship. She will get delivered.
[46:13] Her children will get delivered. Her
[46:15] people will come back because we don't
[46:16] give up. We don't give up. Amen. And
[46:20] when we get down, we just get fired up.
[46:22] Amen. Because he's fire. He's a
[46:23] consuming fire. And he raises up a
[46:25] standard in your life to overcome every
[46:27] obstacle to overcome those chariots. Man
[46:30] is saying Ephraim they had to overcome
[46:31] something that Joshua said you are more
[46:33] than able to do it. You are more than
[46:34] able to conquer those chariots. And if
[46:36] you just look at your circumstances and
[46:38] you look and you see oh it's too hard
[46:40] they might hurt me. Just let the perfect
[46:42] love of God cast out the fear man say
[46:45] cast out the fear Ephraim and walk
[46:47] forward with the name of the Lord
[46:49] because my captain's going before you.
[46:51] And he says, "Hurt not the oil and the
[46:53] wine." Hallelujah. You cannot hurt this.
[46:56] This word hurt, it means a bodily
[46:58] injury. Amen. Maybe the body gets
[47:00] injured sometimes, but hurt not the oil
[47:02] and wine. There's healing in the house.
[47:05] Hallelujah. There's healing. There's
[47:08] restoration. There's perfect love.
[47:11] There's an answer to every
[47:15] challenge. Hallelujah. a bodily injury
[47:18] or a wound, mental or emotional distress
[47:21] or anguish or
[47:23] suffering. No matter
[47:27] what, that went real fast. No matter
[47:30] that's 18 minutes now. No matter what
[47:33] we're going
[47:34] through, no matter how hard the pressure
[47:36] is, no matter if we feel like we're in
[47:39] hell or we feel like we're on the
[47:41] mountain, we feel like we're ostracized
[47:44] or we feel like we've been unjustly
[47:45] treated. That doesn't matter. Hurt, not
[47:48] the oil.
[47:50] You, no matter where you're at right
[47:52] now, the oil can come straight into your
[47:55] life. Perfect love can come and change
[47:57] the situation. whatever the need is in
[48:00] your prayer request tonight in this
[48:02] prayer meeting. Hallelujah. There is
[48:04] nothing too hard for the Lord. Amen.
[48:07] Hallelujah. This this this wine.
[48:10] Hallelujah. You know when you start
[48:12] drinking wine, you know it does
[48:13] something to you. Let's say naturally.
[48:15] You know, let's say that you decide that
[48:17] you want to drink some wine, which you
[48:19] shouldn't because you don't need to
[48:20] because you've already got spiritual
[48:21] wine. But let's say you did. Amen. If
[48:23] you did, you're going to change your
[48:25] thinking, going to change how you talk.
[48:26] You'll probably start dancing.
[48:27] Naturally, you'll probably start doing
[48:28] things that you don't normally do.
[48:30] That's right. You know that something
[48:32] that you don't normally do, you'll start
[48:34] speaking things that you probably
[48:35] shouldn't have said. Hallelujah. That
[48:37] were true. You started becoming honest.
[48:39] The real you starts coming out. The real
[48:41] you. And that's the you that the wine of
[48:44] God's Holy Spirit, the wine of
[48:45] revelation makes you become honest,
[48:47] makes you become transparent, makes you
[48:49] become a real true person to who you
[48:51] are. And who you are in church is who
[48:54] you are at school. Who you are at school
[48:55] is who you are at home. Why? Because
[48:57] you're drinking the wine and you just
[48:59] say it how it is. You're not afraid.
[49:00] You're not ashamed. You got some Dutch
[49:02] courage. Hallelujah. You know what Dutch
[49:04] courage is? It's when someone's had a
[49:06] few too many to drink and they just
[49:08] start saying anything. They feel
[49:09] invincible. But let me tell you, when
[49:11] you drink the wine, hallelujah, of
[49:13] revelation and you are stimulated by
[49:15] God's word. Hallelujah. And you've been
[49:17] established in the word and you don't
[49:19] have anything to be afraid of. You're
[49:20] not ashamed of who you are cuz you got
[49:22] healed. And the real you is the one that
[49:24] people love. The real you. The real you.
[49:28] Youth young people. The real you. Not
[49:33] ashamed. No secrets. Nothing. Just the
[49:36] real you. You can be the real you in
[49:38] front of your mommy and daddy.
[49:40] Hallelujah. You can be true. Hallelujah.
[49:44] And this is what it takes. Let's be
[49:46] honest. Let's be true to each other.
[49:49] Don't be afraid. Amen. Let perfect love
[49:51] come and cast out all fear. Let's have
[49:53] the musicians.
[49:57] This wine is very powerful. And this is
[49:59] what the Let me just read this as the
[50:01] musicians come and then we'll bring
[50:02] invite brother Ben and u can you sing
[50:05] that play that song this joy that I
[50:06] have. Just
[50:08] think the oil and wine is not governed
[50:11] by the world. It's not governed by the
[50:12] world. It's not governed by Rome. It's
[50:14] not governed by YouTube or governed by
[50:17] how many likes you get on your post.
[50:19] Governed by your Instagram feed. It
[50:21] ain't governed by any of that stuff.
[50:23] Hallelujah. It's it comes from God. It
[50:26] comes from the shikina of glory. It
[50:29] comes from the place where no man can
[50:31] touch. Hallelujah. And it comes through
[50:32] a door that no man can shut. Hallelujah.
[50:35] And Jesus says, "I've opened a door,
[50:38] especially for these young people here.
[50:39] I've opened a door for all. We've walked
[50:42] through that door." Amen.
[50:45] No man can shut it. And this oil that I
[50:48] give, this joy that I have, this faith
[50:51] that I have, this message that I have,
[50:52] this family that I have, the world
[50:54] didn't give it to me. And if the world
[50:56] didn't give
[50:59] it away, Hallelujah.
[51:02] The oil that I have, the world can't
[51:04] take it away. And even no matter where
[51:07] I'm at, no matter how hard I might have
[51:09] fail and fall on my
[51:11] face, hurt not the oil. I might be down
[51:14] so dry in a desert
[51:18] suffering inconceivably in the
[51:21] mind. We however hurt not the
[51:24] wine. Let that wine pour out. Amen.
[51:26] Because it's here for you. What is your
[51:28] expectation? Amen. Why do we come? Why
[51:30] do we gather? We gather for a reason. We
[51:33] gather to drink wine. We drink. We
[51:35] gather to get covenant oil. We gather
[51:37] for deliverance. We gather to bring our
[51:39] fire together to hear the word, to be
[51:41] stabilized, to be strengthened, to be
[51:43] changed. We never have to leave here the
[51:45] same. Is that right?
[51:51] Hallelujah. One more quote. I just want
[51:53] to read a quote here. And I thought it
[51:55] would be quite nice to read about the
[51:57] wine. Amen. Just as that music plays.
[52:01] Hallelujah.
[52:03] He says here then I Oh, man. I've been
[52:06] down there. Wine is a stimulation.
[52:09] Glory. I feel it right now. Stimulated
[52:11] with joy. Shouts. Amen. I heard some of
[52:14] those tonight. Amen. See, and when it
[52:17] does, it has the same effect upon them
[52:19] that wine does upon a natural man.
[52:21] Because when the revelation has been
[52:23] given of a truth of God and the true
[52:25] believer filled with oil, good. and and
[52:29] the re revelation is revealed. The
[52:31] stimulation becomes so great that he
[52:35] makes himself behave abnormally. Right?
[52:39] Glory. See, that's what's the matter
[52:41] with them now. Now, if you want
[52:43] scripture for this, just start reading
[52:45] Acts two. Amen. Where they are at, they
[52:48] had the promise they had been given to
[52:50] them. When all of the promise of the
[52:51] Holy Spirit was poured out on them, it
[52:53] was scripturally a vindicated.
[52:55] Hallelujah. What if they had said, "Oh,
[52:57] now wait. He told us to wait up here for
[52:59] our ministry. And after eight days, they
[53:01] said, "Well, I tell you boys," Mark said
[53:03] to Matthew, "I believe we already got
[53:05] it, fellows. Don't you think so? See, we
[53:09] already got it." Well, while we're
[53:11] waiting on our ministry now, we ought to
[53:12] be going out and
[53:14] preaching. Well, we let No, let's wait
[53:16] another day. Let's wait another day.
[53:18] That's good. That's some good counsel
[53:19] there. And I just skip down a bit and it
[53:21] says, "This is Peter now after a few
[53:23] more of those questions." And he says,
[53:25] "Then then I can see Simon cuz he had
[53:27] the keys." Amen. There's a key right
[53:29] there. Amen. Excuse the pun. You know,
[53:31] now wait a minute, boys. The scripture
[53:33] has got something to say about this. He
[53:35] never told us just how many days to
[53:37] wait. He said, "You stay here until
[53:42] Hallelujah. until Amen. You stay there
[53:45] until Joel's prophecy come to pass."
[53:47] Amen. Until Isaiah's prophecy is a
[53:49] vindicated here. What are they doing?
[53:51] They are looking back to the president.
[53:53] They're looking back to what God has
[53:54] done. They're looking back to the
[53:55] prophecies and they're taking that word
[53:57] and they're finding themselves in the
[53:59] vision of the word. This is the this is
[54:01] a very important thing. I want you to
[54:03] catch this. If you catch something, I
[54:05] want you've got to see yourself in the
[54:07] word. You've got to know who you are in
[54:09] the word. You've got to find where you
[54:10] at. Where is your situation? Because let
[54:12] me tell you, there's many places where
[54:14] your situation is already written. And
[54:16] it shows you the same God will do the
[54:19] same for you as he did for them. Amen.
[54:21] You got to anoint that word. Anoint that
[54:23] promise tonight for your people. Who
[54:24] you're praying for, brother Ben. Who
[54:26] you're praying for, whatever it is that
[54:28] you need, anoint that word. Find it in
[54:30] the scripture. God will show it to you.
[54:32] Hallelujah.
[54:34] Amen. Amen. God bless you, brother Ben.
[54:37] Lord. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. God bless
[54:40] you,
[54:46] brother. Hallelujah.
