say satan you are defeated you are a defeated be you have no right to hold the bride of christ you have no right to come and put your medicine this church you have no right to try to cause the vision you have no right in this whole plan it is not yours you don't even have a say in it so we cast you out in the name of jesus christ if there's any spirit contrary to the holy spirit in this place lord bind that spirit and cast in the name of jesus christ the spirit of doubt the spirit of confusion lord we bind that spirit tonight in the name of our lord jesus christ lord may you the captain of those now come down and take the service lord for your glory and your honor we pray in jesus christ's name amen amen amen hallelujah church it is wednesday evening amen and we came to fellowship with god okay it must be emotional because he is an emotional god okay you can't tell me when jesus christ was walking to the cross that he didn't have emotion in him you can't tell me when god was lying on the cross saying it was finished there was no emotion in him he saw all of us you're not here this is no mistake so let's just set the playing field right if there's anything that is in hindering you tonight throw it away entering there's more important things on this earth more important things than our everyday worries there's more important things than tomorrow there is now it's the i am the very present god not the tomorrow sorry i get excited because i thought when we went through easter i thought man that was it you know we but i can't cry anymore i was standing here we were doing the sacrifice and for the first time in my life i could see ben break him i could see the lord jesus christ being broken for me i never had that before it does something to a grown man to see another man that was innocent die for me which don't even deserve it if you knew where i came from if you knew my life you would say you did not deserve that but yet yes yet he did it for us so let's throw everything away now let's do a reset let's have church let the revival fires burn that's why we come here not to fall asleep not to get bored but really enter in now i encourage you maybe it's just a simple thing we showed tonight but put on your spiritual cap seek god and everything that's said and i promise you he will reveal himself to you he's that type of god he will reveal himself to you okay he's a sovereign almighty god where you think least he can reveal himself he will reveal himself brother in the deepest trial when you're at your weakest point he can reveal himself to you on top of the mountain brother ed when you and your wife is there he can reveal himself to you everywhere god is is around us we just choose to look the other way but that don't make it that god's not here amen that's pretty much all amen that's what it's about come on church man that's what it's about amen amen thank you musicians amen hallelujah praise the thank our musicians sister god bless you brother isaac [Applause] god bless you god bless you joshi i love you god bless you brother phil i love you brother james god bless you sister elizabeth god bless you you guys can be seated amen let's give the land and lord a handcuff of applause oh no the messages you stand up we haven't opened a word yet we haven't invited him yet so sorry i got ahead of myself brother ed can you put on that first little little um quote the i love quotes but i don't i don't live by quotes i live by the word of god okay so i want you to remember everything i say here there is nothing new all of it comes out of here some of it comes out of the message a lot of it comes out of here but most of it comes from the cloud okay so when the lord puts a thought in your heart and it's been bothering you for two or three weeks how am i going to put it together then sometimes it's better just to let go and let god so i've got notes but i ain't going to guarantee i'll be staying on them tonight okay so if it looks like it's going this way it's for someone don't worry then it's not for you okay amen so let's go that first quote is that on see if i can we wait okay faith look at this quote faith is based on forgiveness huh that's not my sermon but i read this today and i thought man that could be something brother isaac could preach on one day he liked those one words forgiveness okay but that's that's not it let's see how this one works we're gonna go to amos eight i think that there we go amos eight amen so i'm gonna try to follow with two computers because i made a little couple of notes but i'm gonna promise not to stay on the notes i say to the lord lord if you take over i will do whatever you say so it says here in amos 8 i've got it in my bible as well this was a sword that was just lying there on the on the table if anybody's missing this sword i borrowing it for tonight david could borrow goliath sword to cut off his own head i can borrow this sword to just you know advance the fight it says there in amos 8 and verse 11 and we're going to maybe read verse 12 as well he says behold is everybody there amen he says behold the days come say of the lord that i will send a famine in the land not not a famine for bread nor a thirst for water but a hearing of the words of the lord and they shall wander from sea to sea and from north and even to the east they shall run to and fro to seek the word of the lord and shall not find it are we in that time have we looked around how many of you would quote the scripture and people laugh at you is that so far-fetched so my title tonight is the army of the lord jesus christ that is the this is the the thing that i want you to realize i am a regimental man i grew up in a family that that works with structure okay and i've learned that god is not always in structure he's in between the structure okay he sits right in where everybody feels a bit uncomfortable that's where god works if you are comfortable in this church i'm telling you god i'm dealing with you and then you need to go back on your knees and pray and say lord reveal to me something because i like these cheese too much i'm sitting too comfortable i'm falling asleep i'm missing something because if god is not dealing even if you're on the mountain he will still teach you stuff he'll still put you through trials but you need to remember when you get comfortable here there is major problems but we're not going to preach that now but i'm just saying okay so you all can have your seat and we're going to shoot and see if we can get this this enemy the devil away from us so in 2 corinthians 3 and this is where it comes in with the army of the lord jesus christ it says here ye are our epistles written in your hearts known and read of all men for so much as you manifest declared to be the pistol of jesus ministered by us written not with ink listen to this not just written written not with ink okay but with the spirit of the living god okay not on tables of stone as with moses didn't say with moses i added that but in fleshly tables of the heart so what he says is you have to have to be in this gospel to be to be even a warrior for christ you still have to have a heart you still have to because christ as as much as he walked on this earth and every devil he defeated under his his feet he still had a heart he had authority but he had a heart so let us not get hard and calloused let us expose this tonight i pray the lord come knocks at your door and just remind you that you cannot help anyone else even yourself if your heart is of stone no matter how much law you have in you no matter how much scriptures how much brother ben quotes and brother branham quotes in brother isaac sermons and brother munpo sermons that don't help you nothing it's about revelation but if you have a heart if you push back before you accept before you take anything if you push back you're going to find yourself alone and you're going to find yourself in the outskirts of a war being fought by a multi-member body and you think how did i get here now i'm jumping way ahead but i just want to say i'm not even preaching that tonight that's another service but it's so important because what satan does is he causes the vision he starts pushing you away he pushes you away from your helplines don't go to the prayer meeting he says don't go to this meeting don't go to the youth group don't go through that oh you don't want to be part of brother falls this and just not tonight but do you know that that separates the army and if you are a general fighting against another person what you want to do is you want to cause the vision you want to push them aside because it's easy to handle one two three with a big army and i'm gonna talk about the army of satan i want you to realize that this is a very very great war and unfortunately for us we find ourselves smack back in the middle of it and you go why me i want to tell you why not you i want to encourage you this is not a fight this is what the lord showed me because i had a pity party by myself one day i thought man i can't take it anymore there's always this and then that and then that doesn't work in the sound resolution and but at a stage god just went and and like he flicks you on the ear you know when you was doing something naughty like and he goes but see you're looking at it wrong your perspective is man's perspective but you're not seeing what i'm trying to do and why do i have to repeat myself to you can't you get it the first time see the people that got god's message the first time is the ones that went into the land the one where the message was revealed to them and it sunk into their hearts god didn't have to talk to us he only spoke once and i'll show it as well he doesn't need to talk to you twice needs to talk to you once but your attitude import that is so important that you have the right attitude so as i'll go i'll keep a whole couple of slides because i just went way ahead so we've got the the mighty campaign and he said unto them go ye into the world and preach the gospels to every creature that's all that's our standing orders brother ben that's it then we've got in this campaign of the lord we've got you the soldier me the soldier that that's a that's that's part two hopefully lord willing okay i'm going to talk about campaign tonight then we have the army of god now you see this guy he's praying for all of us he's on his knees because before you go into a battle you get on your knees i've seen photos because i've googled so many photos to get the right one so some of these photos i had to change just because you don't always want to show everything ask brother isaac it's real hard to get photos on the internet but this was the best one i thought hey you know if we're a multi-member barney and the rest of the army is not there he's praying for reinforcements okay so let him pray okay he's in the right position then we got this this guy this guy the spy in the camp i wanna i wanna expose that guy to the help of our lord jesus christ i wanna expose him every day in my life because this guy has no face he just he just creeps he's a slicker he just creeps in everywhere he's as sly and slick as you can get them man he can sell ice to an eskimo and make him pay for it double the price just remember that this guy's slick but this one the five star general asked brother ben can it be a seven star general because he had the seven stars come on he's five stars just don't do it right jesus christ he is the general and let us tell you if we can expose this guy and we can have preeminence in our life about the lord jesus christ and we just follow some basic rules we will have a good warfare amen because the battle belongs to the lord let us never forget it amen so and and the lord jesus christ is our final sermon because i pray that when we do that that you would actually see what the lord does in our life every day we forget it we're so used to miracles we forget it war so this is a bit of boring stuff i'll try to go as fast as i can through it but the reason i had it in is because you have to build a little bit up before we get to the the juicy bits okay so war what is war what good is in war but what is war so the definition of war or what i could find on it is war is an intense arm conflict no matter if it's a sword or a fist or words or whatever it's intense it it makes your heart pump it it has emotion in it it it it shakes you up man whoa if if a bomb should drop right next to us now it will shock all of us if have you ever heard a cog in a crash a ball and you're like oh you what went on and you're like and it shocks you because something just happened now war is that to the extreme war doesn't stop it doesn't stop until everybody that's in war either makes peace or is dead there's no rules there's no written rules and war that says that once you there's a gentleman's agreement an actor wall but i'm telling you if you can get a spy in the other guy's camp you will send them because you need intel to make sure that when you get to the next part you can win war is ugly nothing good on it even caleb and joshua would fought in the war and the things that they have done you can't tell me they went back to their home and to your wives and just hugged them and said i'm a happy man when you take someone's life when you hurt someone it does something to you even if it's under the promise of god and it looks so good in the scriptures be careful before you make war be careful it comes back and i'll prove it generally it's character of that it's militant groups but i don't care about that generally it's characterized by extreme violence aggression and destruction now you tell me what is the devil about yeah what is the devil about have you seen guys that's full filled in the world that's stuck on drugs you tell me that that's not violence you tell me that's not something acting out on persons we've got witnesses everywhere i used to be in the world drinking you think me acting out when i was drunk and stuff like that the things i've done was anything not to do with war there was something driving me to do stuff that my body didn't want to do because my body wants peace my body wants to live it wants to be a tabernacle of god but the war that's made on my body is producing something that i don't like and it gives you all these of emotions someone comes to him and says what are you doing you're like amen now there is aggression where does that come from you can't tell me i've never seen a guy hit another guy in a fight being happy about it and they're not being angry there you go boy and he eats him back sorry come on have you ever seen a fight like they're not play fighting i mean like these guys got shirts off they're going to punch it and he goes here you go come on man there must be a feeling about it there must be a motion but most emotion leads you sometimes astray so you get the intent is to kill and destroy that's war to divide and conquer is the liberal against the legalist it's the left wing and the right wing you need two wings to fly you're gonna let you know i put that in myself because i thought that was very inspired you need both sides you need them they have to be there okay it can't be this way can't be that way has to be that way but you need them to fly it's crucial it's crucial you've got the law moses is law you've got grace jesus is law but jesus's law don't overwrite moses law because it's all still part of the law because he said he came to magnify that law so you still need the law okay you can't just go grace grace and do whatever you like feel you like want to do and say grace you will be crowned misgrace you will not find grace you will be the the laughing stock of everyone because you think you can do what you want to get away with it there is still law okay but there is grace we have to find the middle here as a congregation as as people walking in step with the general we need to we need to find the balance god will help us but we need to keep an endeavor to keep the bonds of peace which we have so i'm not telling off we're going on i'll show you more pictures children there's lots of them i try to get as much pictures i can to get this through now look there this is war look very hard at this picture people die people get wounded yet this guy is very liberated what is it about so if i beat you i win so if you lie on the floor dead and i conquer 17 others of you i win that we really win you think a sinner out in the world we want to send them to hell you think brother branham when he said they said they didn't even know who was his friends or his enemy he treated everyone the same why do we want to be these guys that's on the charge for god where's the balance where's the soft heart just remember that where's the soft god i'm not saying if that is the enemy the lord will make it happen we'll get there but you must be knowing that your perfect will of god when you go forth to to attack your enemy you must know that it is time to strike and the only way you know when it's time to strike is when he says strike but be sure be very very sure this is where it all began children who knows this picture why do you know this picture what happened there michael threw lucifer out of heaven this dude look at his fist can everybody see that first does he look happy okay so here's my backing because i think people don't believe me and there was a great war in heaven michael and his angels fought against the dragon and the dragon fought against and his angels and prevailed not amen neither was their place found for them anymore in heaven so something happened in heaven and there was no more place found for these dudes and the great dragon was cast out that old serpent called the devil and satan which deceiveth the whole world the whole world don't you get deceived the whole that is he straight this is what he does this is he is the king of deception he is the best king of the saints he'll sell you everywhere give him that credit that's what he does but but when he gets exposed there's no deception anymore when sin comes to the surface even with us when the lord is poking at somebody say hey spiritual caps now something's coming and saying hey that emotion you have in you something that is that is creating this negative feeling towards someone there's something there i want you to expose that and once you expose that then god can deal with him because it's not you doing the fight he's the five star general or the seven star so this guy deceives the whole world and he was cast into the okay so let's throw satan out of heaven he ends up here garden of eden now i could not find a nice garden of eden picture leave her over so this is the garden of eden i just see because it's the full word and it's restored that's the garden of eden for me that's the only way i could see it because it wasn't an apple every picture has a snake and apple in it like for crying out loud don't you read your bibles man okay i had some notes here and i'm on the wrong page stop come on i'll just say apple apple apple apple we should hand out more apples eh people realize they're naked when they eat apples boy we're gonna have problems as prophet said it i'm not i'm not saying anything new prophet said it why need the word of god we need we speaking to myself need the word of god to be our training manual our weapon of choice okay if you're in doubt when you feel you're a bit out of your field take this word spend time with him i say with him because this is him in print form okay he'll reveal you to your heart and you'll reveal through you but you need to put something in to get something out okay god don't just do miracles all the time he waits for you to give to take a step so that he can he can come because remember this is this is a thing that god does i think people and and i sometimes forget it as well you have to put a foot forward so that god can come behind i'm looking for the word what is that word and confirm that he's with you the prophet said i'm going to pray for you now but i need him to come but the prophet had to start praying and he will talk to jesus and he'll speak to him and say lord as you healed this one and lord you healed this one and you're amazing god and his enemies he's here now so sometimes we just need to put the step forward so that lord can start confirming that hey my child i am with you okay but don't you think that the enemy is not up for the challenge see what we forget if i go is that the next one just before i jump in but this is really important this is this is i'm still the earth hey ah okay so it's one back so see this guy satan he was actually in heavenly places with christ jesus okay think about this you think that we can just easily step over the devil and trample on him because he's under our feet and under us be careful this man spent time with god though you are from god you are still a little bit blinded to a lot of things and you still going through a lot of training but your enemy has already been there and the whole big problem of this guy which i'll show next is he does not believe he's an unbeliever though he spent in the presence of god he was at every song he led most of the songs he was right there in heaven he experienced heaven yet he does not believe and you know what he can't he can't believe he knew what happened here so if this happened and the book says it happened and the book says it's going to the lake of fire you think he's all of a sudden going to start believing the book because it's his despise genesis reveals him and that and revelation says where he's going you think all of a sudden he's just going to tell everybody the bible is true guys come on we're not playing era this is war this is this i'm talking about the campaign so we're on earth this is where it happened but here this is what brother branham says joseph meeting his brethren so he's talking about the two seats in the garden of eden and he says since when when he fell and after the hearing after god said to eve why has thou done this since he goes it's the super serpent he beguiled me he turned to satan and he said your seed are going to have m i'll put enmity between your seed and the woman's seed and since that day see this is what i want to tell you boys and girls the war started not just in heaven it came down to earth and now these two seeds started fighting on earth and was kept in cain killed abel god raises up seth then moses destroy all the children in in egypt because there's a deliverer coming all the firstborns and the younger the two years gets killed moses has to go in a little bushel and be pushed down the river because he wanted to kill that seed of god then then it says here and he comes off and then he was looking for him and he's just jumping a bit because he was an abraham was in everyone but yeah he says he went to john the baptist so satan goes off with his head but the spirit move on and the spirit went into jesus christ with his god in flesh he killed him see the the war the intent the killing i want to kill i want to hurt i wanna i wanna i wanna win i i wanna remember these words i remember them it's coming back then he killed him on calvary but god raised him up again that's okay and then all of a sudden he goes away but then now god send this holy spirit and his holy spirit is now each one of us and do you think that he stopped with jesus christ you think you stopped then no you got the holy spirit he's coming after you mario karo you got the holy spirit he's coming after you because that same seed that's the same promise that god said i would put enmity that's still going to jesus christ throws him in the lake of fire because even if he gets bound for a thousand years he's going to get loosened again and then god's going to come back and deal with him and throw him in the lake of fire so even after he sees oh i'm licked he's still going to give it a go and he will be loosed for that season because he's still he's programming his kill destroy conquer divide kill destroy and that's what he's doing in every churches in believers in families families man he's a slicker but our lord is going to deal with him amen that's a promise we just have to we just have to to try to get a bit of a word in season that can give us an encouragement to say lord i'm not fighting this fight in vain i'm not standing for jesus christ in vain okay there must be something into you say this but just a little bit more lord just once more lord yes i've made a mistake but you know what i'm still on this side you have to pick a side children you have to pick a side no matter how old you are there's coming aside a time where you're gonna have to pick a side you're gonna have to because if you don't pick a side the side will be picked for you because the way the tree leans the way it falls so don't you think i'm preaching to do i preach to parents everyone there's a time where you gonna have to pick a side and if you don't and your court gets called and the lord says come up the way the tree leans is the way it falls and i'm not trying to do to preach hell death and brimstone the way the tree leans the way it falls so you don't pick a side that that little that little name come on man who have your children raise your hands is younger than i am name was how old i was judging about seven seven eight let's let's make it let's make it bigger let's say how many kids here the children here is eight years old and i am eight years in ayah okay let's say name was eight years old where is he now he can't make a choice for himself he's lying in a coma his brain is not working so he's not by his mental faculties yes the lord can do a miracle and healing but what if this is his day now if his mom and dad is under the lord jesus christ there is a covenant understand but why wait why wait if you know you're playing for the winning side if you know where you are you know who you are you know you pick the side you know you're walking forward you've got a direction you've got purpose you've got drive but if you don't know where you are you have no direction you have no purpose you're just a vagabond and a stranger roaming around being led by the devil because god can't lead you because you didn't pick a side you have to pick a side let's play soccer okay who's on this side okay who's on this side oh josh you're the last one bigger side oh i'll take either one side because brother i don't want you playing against me okay you at least pick the side but he can't now go and say no no i'm going to want to play for this side a bit and then i'm going to jump over the fence and play the guys will get confused man hey are you for us or against us are you playing with me or against me amen sorry i jumped off topic there pick a side okay so there it said about the two religious spirits now the one i minded other one is humble the one is led by the spirit by can we hear that spirit by spirit boy so it must be it must be revelation it must be revealed to you and i'm going to talk about it this is what this slide and then i think i'll because i've been at it a while sorry about that i was gonna run the timer but i forgot to push play here we go what does that say lilia why so why did satan get cast out of heaven why isaiah 14 verse 12 says how thou hat fallen from heaven o lucifer son of the morning how they have been cut down to the ground which that weakened the nations for thou has said in thy name so did he speak did he say the words i don't like you what did he think it did he go i don't agree with you brother armand or did he think it because i'm going to come to the greatest battle there was no word spoken here it was in here but what did he say and i want to i want you to say i will every time you see the word i will and he says ascend into heaven exalt above the throne in the stars and of god also upon the mount of the congregation i'll sit on the sides of the north ascend above the heights of the clouds be like the most high that's a lot of his will hey it's too much me and not enough him this was this guy's problem i want to go here mom i want to do this dad love i want to go play this i want to go do that i want i i i our life our life is for each other when i was back in the world my wife is a witness it was i will i want i need but when i met him it's what do you want how can i help you what can god do through me to get further in the kingdom brother father's going to do an outreach i will be there that's the i will i want to hear i will be there when the battle is raging i will be there when you're crying and you need prayer i will be there if you need someone to look after your kids i will be there i will they see that i will change this now the eyewall is now for you you said i will that means you said i will be there for you brother so when i'm fighting in the battle and i'm gonna show it the last bed i need to know who's right who's left his foot and who's behind me because if i can't trust you if you're not fighting the same direction and you go off in your own direction you expose the flanks and the enemy can come in and kill steal plunder divide i'll be like the most high i can do whatever i want to because jesus gives me grace you tell me that i can wear whatever i want i can cut my hair i can wear skirts that's this high i can do whatever i want because this time and jesus christ has grace you are being fooled by the enemy you go to a function you dress up i'm sorry you go to my wedding which i invite you to i expect you to dress according to what the wedding invite says because when i went to the nightclubs i dressed up when i went to my friends for the birthday party i came into my best shoes because i wanted to show off who i am but for our lord jesus christ we can give him all the false you're coming to the house of god and forgive me just like you want i came in with jandals sister shannon the right i came in with sweet shirts and then i fed the lord and some brother said to me hey can you shape up a bit guess what i said i will pray meeting on a wednesday night i just don't want to go i just don't want to go if there's one out of the camp there is a place where people can come in and hurt i'm not being legalistic forgive me but we are marching forward and we are in a campaign and we come to meet our lord jesus christ and we had easter where a man lost all his clothes got striped and hurt and beaten and and persecuted stood before his own people with nothing on for you you can't even dress up for him shame on us man it's not a doctrine it's i want to you take it as a doctrine your attitude needs correction i'm sorry it's what i see it's what's inside here your battle there's your homework that is our battle go this week and spend time with the lord and go listen to the greatest battle ever fought he said dave the satan is not going to make it easy for you he'll bring doubt he'll be frustrations he'll take the very brother in church standing right next to you and he'll rub you up because that's what he does if you get offended you never took it back to him i got offended one day with a brother in church i was so angry at him i wanted to punch him in church i was standing downstairs still a lot of people know this testimony i was standing downstairs i was looking at him and i thought i said these words and that's what was my saving grace i said lord help me understand this person because i don't come to church to feel like this i come to church to worship the living god you better have to show me lord what is going on what am i missing and guess what he showed me because i directed my prayer to him i didn't run to anybody else i didn't reason i didn't justify myself all i did i said hey can you please help me i'm missing something and guess what it came and it felt like a big two by four who knows what a two by four is brother andy a piece of wood this long this thick eye hit me right in the teeth in church and god said to me you never took the time to listen to his testimony who are you to call god i went and sat down and i cried and i changed my ways and since that day our promise is the lord is my witness i i don't judge any of you because i haven't walked in your shoes now earlier tonight i walked in brother ed shoes for a while because i didn't have my shoes here confession i did event brother so because i didn't have shoes okay but see take time i'm not an angry person don't get me wrong i get very emotional take time to get to know each other you know how did you get into the message brother you know when did the lord call you where did you come from brother isaac we've got your testimony online what a testimony that man has resolved amen no matter what nobody says i respect him he's got resolve because he says something and he does something no matter how he gets there that's not what he wants he's going to do it brother ben how did you meet the lord you said i was printing books when i was 20 six years old 23 years old printing books making tapes that on his journey so when i see this man going to papua new guinea i say lord bless him because he's got a burden he wants to spread your word so i get behind the word get behind the marching orders i'm not out of line i don't judge i don't think wrong the moment the devil goes chase don't like you i say but i love him he hates that he thinks you're you're weird cool because i like weirdos because if you put a lot of bolts in the car you need the knots if you don't have nuts the car falls apart you need nuts so let me be a nut i like it this way okay i'm about to close sorry this is our campaign now can you guys read this i will he said and restore to you the years that the locusts have eaten that the cankerworm that the caterpillar and the palmer were and the great army which i sent among you so god's saying i kicked satan out of heaven i did it but i can restore i how many times did he say that five times like satan how many times once because god don't speak twice he spoke to to to noah he says noah bought me a boat and 120 years later noah was still building a boat only spoke once once god don't need to talk to us time and again and if you find yourself reasoning time and again over the same thing it's not god speaking that was under inspiration that's not god speaking because if you said lord you will then he will when those words come over your lips saying it will be done then it will be done god don't have to tell anybody twice he's sovereign so here comes god and he starts the plan of restoration on that cross and he takes the beating and he takes the scoffing they rip out his beard they make fun of him they mock him they laugh at him but guess what he said i will and he only said it once he was standing in front of pilate and they were making fun of him and he said nothing because he didn't need to say anything pilate asked him a question he said to him back a question he says who do you think i am he didn't entertain no devil i think i'll close with this one now i want to ask you life or death free moral agency lies with us children free moral agency means you got the choice means you can pick parents means you can choose your outcome you can have your kneeling you can't have your healing brother branham said to one lady in the prayer line today he says if you just believe that it's yours go rejoicing she still limped off the stage and everybody was quite quiet he says just remember if you can believe it is yours all of a sudden halfway down the hallway people start screaming and shouting that lady's running in the church what's that if you can believe prophet believed he did it time and time and time again it's if you can believe so here's your choice life or death it depends on the response you give is what you're gonna receive the law in the bible is you give you receive so what you give what love your neighbor as you love thyself that's the second commandment you give you receive you treat people like dirt dirt's coming your way and will bury you yeah these two thieves hang on the cross and one starts getting to his center what cena he's he's his reasoning always is his conscience he's he's starting to wake up because just before he was coughing as well he was coughing as well both thieves so now he gets to his his senses there we go and he says and indeed and we indeed justify for we receive the due reward of our deeds at least he's honest he says but this man has done nothing amiss and he said unto him unto jesus lord he recognized this was his time and he says remember me when thou comest into thy kingdom and jesus said unto him verily i said unto thee that they shall thou this day to today thou shalt be with me in paradise so look at this picture of war and this is where i close and we can go into prayer now i don't want you can pray loud if you're not you can pray in your heart i want to ask you something very personal tonight are you fighting like these guys on the outskirts there are you a one-man band fighting your way to victory or do you get stuck in with these guys because look we are shekinah we are a small little battalion like that and we all huddled together real nice and tight and you know what if i didn't put any deodorant on you're going to smell me because we're going to get real close because the closer we get the less space between us for the enemy to come in the closer we get if you find yourself always being on the outskirts when there is a church meeting in get closer fellowship talk to one another get to know one another this is not a time to go on to your own things you think it's later than you think the prophet already preached that with the fleshing red light if you find yourself as one of these guys that's called brother isaac knows it he's wrote a song and he says no man's land it's the death of mania come on good man let us not find ourselves in no man's land let us huddle up closer if your brother smells tell him next time hey you can use bruising on please because now you're saying it out of love because man stinks things okay but if he doesn't put the odor on on just get closer anyways because what your enemy don't want to be in that space if your shoulder is against his shoulder you tell me the enemy pushes his nose in there he's dead so get closer anyway there's a time where we as a church should remember this is not a game this is life or death and if little shekinah little shekinah starts becoming like these guys here and there's confusion and chaos bro we're in trouble so i ended with a positive note amen brother cadre said that i like that quote why not you why not now why wait for your journey with the lord the king of kings the the the winner of every battle that's going to go forth why not start it yeah why wait for tomorrow tomorrow is boring man days where it's happening so do you want to enroll can everybody stand up i want to sing a song can everybody enroll in the army of the lord can anybody tell me honestly you do not want to be in the winning side who does not want to be in the winning side please raise your hand so i take it you all want to be in the winning side amen so let's enroll in the lord's army and from there on what we'll do is we'll go into prayer and we pray and we thank the lord and if there is a ought against a brother if there's someone that hasn't made their mind up if this word does not impress you i asked tonight that you would ask the king of kings the five-star seven-star general to come and knock at your door because it's fun being here it's not boring amen amen so let's play let's sing i am in the army of the lord i'm in the we how does it go i may never march in the end how does it go ah there

him to help understand all these big fancy words that the parents or the preachers preach up here because sometimes i don't even understand it usually anything that comes out of andy's mouth has to have a definition i also don't know what he's saying it's just he's got salubrious words so i asked that you would ask the lord tonight children that he would open the word for you now as well so that when you sit here it won't be boring but it will be awesome and remember you only gonna get what you you're only gonna get what you so if you don't ask you ain't gonna get ah okay i'm just saying so let's go and slow it down let's play lords army real snow i'll sing it and they all close your eyes and then after i'll go we can go into prayer [Music] cause i may never march in the infantry i'll
