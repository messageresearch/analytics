perfectly Blue Clear day they only really come when there's a storm when there's rain coming in you know and it's often in those times where we're in some sort of a storm or something you if you look back in your life you realize the promises of God came there and he and he brought you through he gave you a promise and he brought you through so the one you're going through now is no different what

service I love the I love having the last word you can fix everything everything that was said about Canada I just want to be clear about something that brother brandham did say that he's going to be a Canadian citizen in the Millennium so praise the Lord I've had a wonderful time at camp this year and uh just so enriched so refreshed amen and uh I just want to say thank you Lord this morning amen God has been so good and it's been just a real blessing for us to be with you all and uh it's going to be hard to leave we just feel ourselves so connected with you we're part of the same family amen and so we just want to thank everybody for the role that they played during this camp and and just want to show by way of appreciation just in words if we can do it in a simple way like that just want to say thank you and uh I know there's many different uh hearts and roles that are played positions that needed to be filled and and each and every one of you all the musicians brother Isaac you and your group and just all the song songs that were sung and uh the ministering of the word brother Andrew I I am enriched I'm encouraged in the Lord amen and uh so I I'm also going to go home with new Strength new Vigor amen and uh we just want to thank the Lord for those things amen because without him these things would not be possible and also just especially want to thank brother Ben Sister Christine for their love amen just want an example of the love of Christ you have been to Us Praise the Lord and uh we can we see that the Lord has been so mindful he's been so kind to us so generous to us this this camp and uh just been a real blessing and um you know it's amazing just how the Lord does things yesterday as our brother was speaking I I was planning on speaking on the glor glory of the cloud this morning and here our brother brings out the the the cloud and uh and and was preaching on the cloud and and he even used the very quote I was going to use today which is it is for you amen and uh and uh obviously surprisingly he used the same picture I was going to use isn't that amazing wow but it's it's just the Lord and then our brother comes up here today brother Isaac he comes and he says that he saw the bow in the cloud amen and that's where I was going to end so I as far as I'm concerned it's over we're we're finished but uh I just feel I feel that the Lord um maybe just wants to close it off in in maybe a different way that I was planning and um I want to encourage you when when we when we think about the cloud as well and those things that you know there's there's uh we're going to read a portion of scripture today in Hebrews 12 you can turn there so long Hebrews 12 and verse1 we we see this kind of last ad admonition to the church this um you know at the endend of the day this is what you must do and and he makes a reference even to the cloud you know when when he makes a reference to those that are waiting for us he says there are a great cloud of witnesses a cloud of witnesses and it's amazing how he would describe those that are waiting for us with those with that terminology a cloud and here we see when the Lord comes he comes in clouds of Glory uh when when he came in our when he came in our day he also showed himself in a cloud amen and so it's not surprising that the robe that is on the believer the robe that is on those that are waiting for us it is a cloud amen so that cloud is for us it's our robe amen and it's the same robe that he is wearing so we just see how perfectly the Lord is putting all these things together for us and I want to just maybe go uh The Next Step today and just by way of of of finishing off the services just kind of as a way of reminder let's keep the let's keep the faith let's lay aside every weight amen God has spoken so clearly this Camp uh we've had the rains literally and spiritually amen we had just so many confirmations during this Camp God has been so clear about who you are in Christ and uh I just you know I just want to go sit somewhere in a in a in a room by myself and just absorb it amen just absorb everything and I want to encourage you that when you go your separate ways this afternoon go find a place where you can just absorb everything that's gone on this Camp don't get too busy with life right away just take it take a moment and absorb the things that the Lord has done absorb the the things that were done in the prayer line remind yourself of What the Lord Has Done For You amen build a memorial you know stack some Stone somewhere and and and let it be a memorial a testimony for What the Lord Has Done For You don't don't forget what God has done for you at Camp amen hallelujah so we are we are here one more time we want to just just ask the Lord now as we just close our eyes to just bless us in his service father we come before you Lord humbly thankfully Lord giving you praise giving you honor Lord knowing that you have orchestrated all these things we just see how how mindful you are how perfect you are Lord God how we've been so blessed we want to give you thanks for our brother Andrew who's come across the oceans Lord to be here and and Lord we just want to say we've been encouraged in the Lord Lord we give testimony today that we feel a new Strength Lord and we feel that you have fan the the flames in our hearts Lord we just give you praise this morning we thank you for this assembly we thank you for this congregation these people the visitors oh God Lord Brother Ben and Sister Christine Lord his family we ask for a blessing upon this congregation and these people father and Lord as we just come one more time lord we want to just as as we would look at the last page in the book we want to just bring a conclusion to these things today by your grace Lord and that you would just by way of reminder Remind us that you are with us Lord we do not have to fear we have you on our side Lord and and we can go from this place Lord and we can take this presence with us because you are with us you're even in US Lord wherever we go and we take courage in that we take a peace in that today and so we just thank you for that Lord as we read your word will you bless it and just let it be anchored in our hearts in Jesus Christ's name amen Hebrews 12:1 it reads like this wherefore seeing we also are compassed about with so great a cloud of witnesses let us lay aside every weight and the sin which does so easily beset us and let us run with patience the race that is set before us looking unto Jesus the author and finisher of our faith who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross despising the shame and is sat down at the right hand of the Throne of God verse three for consider him that endured such contradiction of Sinners against himself lest ye be wearied and faint in your minds you may have receiv just for a moment so here in Hebrews we we've just come out of the the the faith chapter you know the he the heroes of the faith and and how that they accomplished the great feats the things that they were called to do in in their in their personal walks with the Lord you know we heard about Enoch we we read about the different ones Abraham Sarah and and these were the heroes of the faith and goes into great uh uh uh uh uh detail about the things that they suffered and they faced and yet by faith they overcame and they have a testimony amen and we glean from those testimonies today but we want to really look at at yourself today you have a testimony God is doing something in your life amen he's doing something right now and and but the admonishment is is this this is the admonishment this is what he's telling us to do that there there's nothing wrong with a message there's nothing wrong with the Bible there's nothing wrong with the Holy Ghost but there is something that we have to do amen we have a part to play wherefor seeing that we have this witness that we have that we are surrounded by so great a cloud of witnesses amen there's so many uh uh beautiful things come to my mind this great cloud of witnesses a voice that has come to our day to tell us who we are what we are and that there's so many of those voices in that in that same Cloud amen uh Dressed the same way let us then lay aside every weight how many here has ever run a race we used to run relays in South Africa and and I was on the the fourth leg you know and you know when we prepared for that race we did not get a little backpack and start stuffing it full of things and and then you know put on a a belt with you know water bottles and this and that no this is the last leg this is this is going to be it this is you know keeping your eyes on the prize everything you forget about packing you forget about the troubles you forget about school workor tomorrow you know you forget about all those things you're laying aside amen you are shedding weight is what you're doing you are preparing for that last lap you are you are there because you know you're going to need every last bit of energy you're going to be as you need to be as light as possible you're going to want to draw from all your strength and to do that you don't want anything to hinder you amen so you're dressed appropriately your your mind is in the right place you're focused on that end goal amen and you're just waiting for that baton to touch your hands and you're going going to be at full speed amen but if you had to be weighed down with something it would bring you off balance it would cause you not to be at Optimum performance amen and yet even though God will bring us through things my brother and sister it is important that we lay aside the weights that so easily beset us so easily you know it's amazing just a little thought this this mind is so fragile this this just a little thought can throw you off his word hasn't changed amen by his stripes we were healed that has never changed and yet a little diagnosis or a little thought or a little feeling you know will cause us to to add weight to to our lives and before you know it you're walking around like this and and you're dwary and you're sorrowful but the word has not changed concerning you that word is fixed amen so our job is to shed the weight to resist the devil to cast down reasonings that's our job and that my brother sister we need strength we need faith for that but my my admonition to you today is you have it you have that Faith you everything you have need of for this journey is built in Greater is he that is in you but somehow we allow these weights to come and so the the next verse there says that we can look unto Jesus looking unto Jesus it's continual thing looking therefore unto Jesus who is the writer of your life who is the author in other words he's your composer he's your creator Creator he made you amen he's in control he's governing your life and so he's the author and the finisher he will bring you to completion he will refine you amen he is the finisher he's you know when you build a house you have the rough roughing uh Crews that come in and they build the framing and and you know that's kind of rough you know they just kind of slap it together and and then they have the guys that do the the roughing work they do the electrical the plumbing and all these things but there comes a season when the finishing Carpenter comes in amen it's to refine it it's to straighten everything out amen he's got a lot of work to do because where they were a little bit lazy and slack he's going to make it look good amen he's the finisher he's the finisher of our faith amen he comes in and he refines everything he makes it it makes everything line up according to the blueprint so that's the Lord we can look unto him who's the author and the finisher of our faith who for the joy that was set before him he endureed the cross amen so he saw the purpose he saw the plan and so for the joy of that he endured the cross so what is he saying don't grow weary don't get lazy don't get tired amen the we we had this uh we had our camp start off this year with with pressing in amen pressing forward amen and so he's saying don't don't be weary don't grow weary amen verse three for considering him that endured such contradiction of Sinners against himself lest you be wearied and faint in your mind so he's warning us there is a there's a season coming there's this time and I believe we're living right in it amen where the there there'll be such pressure on the people that they will weary the Bible even talks about men's Hearts failing for fear you know it's just a condition of the mind it's not a condition of the word it's not a condition of the Holy Spirit and power that's within us it's a condition of this world that we live in that that influences our minds but he's saying don't be weary in other words don't do that have you ever talk to a child and you and you say you know you see them doing something wrong and you say don't do that it's really just that simple just don't do that if you don't do that then you'll be it'll be better for you and and we want to complicate it well I'm doing this because of a strain in my family I'm doing this because of of fear or because of my pressure at at school I'm doing this because you know I want to in I'm doing it just don't complicate it lay aside every weight hallu that's right first John 5 and4 says for whatsoever is born of God how many here is born of God overcometh the world is that simple so it's that he didn't say you know based on certain conditions you will overcome the world whosoever is born of God overcomes the world you're an overcomer it's it's a condition of the Overcomer it's a state of being of the Overcomer it's a state of mind of the Overcomer who soever is born whatsoever is born of God overcometh the world and this is the victory that overcometh the world even our faith your faith so we want to talk a little bit about the old gang because I believe that last night after the prayer line I believe the old gang is dead that old gang the the gang that used to to gang up on you you know used to come with their their bullying and their pressures and and their little uh you know their their fears and their torments and the habits and temptations that gang is dead okay but let's just identify the devil here a little bit amen we want to expose him he's a bully right the Devil is a bully and to be a bully it implies that you are intimidating somebody through threats through insults it doesn't say through facts it doesn't say through anything like that it's about it's about creating an imaginary world so that you can manipulate and control that individual that is bullying right bullying is to intimidate someone through threats through insults or through aggressive behavior if you can't get somebody to do what you want them to do you become aggressive you become you start to shove them you start to push them around amen you start to to do things to them why because you want to control them well the devil does this in our lives if he cannot get you to do what he wants you to do he starts to be get he starts to get aggressive he starts to bring sickness he starts to bring this and starts to bring that what's he doing he's trying to manipulate you he cannot control you amen he cannot he cannot change who you are in Christ but he's trying to manipulate you he's trying to get you off balance why he doesn't have any strength he does not have any power but if you can give him power he suddenly has power he has he's a liar amen he's he's a deceiver he has no power to create he cannot do anything good for you amen all he can do is steal from you amen the the devil is powerless that means he has no resources he has no strength everything he says and does is a lie it's a facade it's it's a propaganda amen it's a day we're living in amen it's a day of false news right fake news that is the devil this is his kingdom amen so he's come to his uh his strength which is really nothing there's nothing there the the greatest thing that he has is the weakest thing he has amen it's really it's really sad actually you almost feel sorry for him right because he really has no strength but you see if he comes to you and he says you know what are you sure that you are a Christian are you sure that that that that God loves you and then you start to reason you accept his invitation right to reason and then you open your mind and you say now obviously you're not going to the word you've bypassing your safety right and you're you're going you're on his territory now right and he's playing games in your mind now remember the word hasn't changed concerning you right God hasn't changed his mind concerning you but the devil's coming trying to manipulate you so that you right can't run the race trying to weigh you down so he comes and he tries to manipulate you with your mind amen we're in the head age right we're in the mind age and so he tries to manipulate your mind why because when you say yeah maybe you're right you're actually giving him strength you're actually giving him power see he does not have any power you're the one with the power but as soon as you accept his lie you're actually giving him strength you're giving him the weapons you know it's amazing what they're doing with Israel right don't defend yourself don't don't this don't do that and if you if you don't listen to us we're not going to arm you Israel's strength is not based on America's support Israel's strength is based on the word they will be there till the end there will be a third temple in Millennium amen they're going to be there so their strength is based on the word of God but the devil will try and bully you he will threaten you these threats are are empty because the price has been paid you don't even exist anymore you're hid in Christ he tries to ident identify you and he tries to say who you are don't listen to him he doesn't have a clue who you are he doesn't know who you are you're hidden you're a mystery to him he tries to use your strength your power to frighten you it's amazing how a bully can only use you right he cannot come with anything original he has to use your life to threaten you with that right he tries to rob you essentially a bully is is is a is a thief right he he steals your joy he steals your freedom he steals your ability to maneuver right he he he causes you to walk differently where you would walk down a certain hallway at school maybe if you knew the bully was there you would go another way right so he hinders the way you live right he he in other words takes your lunch right your your Mana your food he tries to steal those things away from you but you know what my brother and sister the point is you're in possession of your own lunch you possess the food you have it you you have to literally give it to him for him to succeed now obviously this is more serious than just your lunch he wants to take your joy he wants to take your health he wants to take your inheritance he wants to get you to slip up he wants to move you off the word but we know this bride cannot fail she's not like the first bride amen it's not like Eve in the garden of Eden so Satan though here's here's a here's a very important fact a little key to remember in the in the coming months years if the Lord would carry right Satan is only interested in destroying you and your family he's only interested in destroying you so when you get that bad feeling when you get that worry or that anxiety remember that's the devil trying to destroy you don't give him room just lay it aside the word is our place of safety amen now the devil wants to distract us off the word he wants to rob you from your joy your blessings but remember the word has not changed concerning you the message has not changed there's nothing wrong with the message there's nothing wrong with the word amen so these things are fixed and we must remember that as we go forward the love of Christ his choosing of you right his election of you the the things that he has said about you is fixed amen amen amen so everything else is like this fog and the devil gets in that fog in the message the manifestation of the spirit he says now how do you get saved here's a good question how do you get saved he says let's take it in a childlike form where every believer no matter if what church you belong to or who your pastor is if he's a right man he will tell you that you can only be saved through faith not through Works in other words there's nothing that we can do he's already done it we have faith in what he has done amen through faith says he says now you believe that he saved you now first thing that comes from the heart you believe it then you walk up and you confess it and say I accept Jesus as my personal savior I believe he saved me wow that's pretty simple I believe he saved me there's not a physical thing in the world that you could prove that you are saved your eyes are the same color you got the same shirt on that you hat on you go outside and here's where he uses this phrase he says you go outside and the old gang is waiting the old gang says they ain't nothing to that but you believe there is something to it don't you so there's there's this Warfare right in the mind the old gang is always ready to gang up on you there's nothing to that what proof do you have what sensation did you have what emotion did you have did you feel anything and yet you came to the service and you said amen to the word you said Lord I believe that there's something in me that's reaching out to you is a deep calling to a deep Lord and on the basis of what you said that if we believe on the Lord Jesus Christ down the house shall be saved that is for me and I believe it just that way I'm going to lay aside everything else and I believe that I am saved amen well the old gang will come and he'll say there's nothing to that but you believe there is something he says what if you say well I'm going to see how it works out I'm going to see how this week will play out I'm going to see if I'm really saved don't do that that's not how this works it's based on the word of God Amen it's based on the his promise to you he says now he says you're saved he says now what if you say well I'm going to say how it works out it'll never work out until you keep your testimony going so many of you you confessed uh uh him as your personal savior last night as your personal healer you confess that Amen in his presence he says now keep your testimony going tomorrow morning when you wake up say Lord by your stripes I am healed Lord according to your word I am safe keep your testimony going whatsoever things are lovely whatsoever things are true think on these things amen you believe that you are saved you act like you are saved you say that you are saved and you associate with those that are saved and it works salvation so there's an atmosphere if you truly believe that you are saved my brother and sister this when he says you act like you are saved he's not saying to put on like an actor that you're saved he says act like it believe it take God at his word say I am saved in the face of of the old gang say it anyhow I am saved because Jesus Christ said so at Thy word Lord amen I am saved you believe you are saved you act like it he says and the same thing will take place by Divine Healing that's right you believe you are healed you act like he healed you you say you are healed amen we have too many testimonies to look back at you know where people had had received their healing in the prayer line and he says you just go thanking the lord nothing had happened yet he said just go thanking the Lord because it's happened anyhow amen it's going to come it's he cannot fail amen and and there will be a time and season when that when that will click amen the the the wheel will connect amen everything will come right and you are healed anyhow amen and he is a high priest of your confession to make good anything that you confess that he's done for you there it is so today we don't we don't face just one bully we Face a whole gang ganging up on you intimidating you but remember they oper at from a position of fear of insecurity and not love they want to make you feel small incapable inferior they want to push you around they want to manipulate you blackmail you and control you belittle you extort you and you know as you let him do that to you it will grow in confidence the first time you say you know you can have my life lunch you know the first time you do that you've given him power now he knows you have a weak spot he knows you've got a weak spot and you know what next time he comes he'll do the exact same thing he's growing in confidence what what is happening you're feeding the black dog right you're feeding that evil you're giving him room when you have the authority to say no amen go ask shamgar if this works amen year after year that bully came onto his his land his inheritance and try to take his resources try to take his food try to take his provision but there came a season when he realized wait a second greater is he that is in me this is my land this is my promise amen he was not an army he was not trained in the Army he was not a soldier he was not he he couldn't call on on some Special Forces Unit he couldn't call for a big air strike or anything like that but he had God and he had the word of God he had the promise concerning him and all he just looked around in his field amen looking around in your field and he just picked up the first thing he saw which was a Jawbone of an ass my brother and sister it wasn't because of that bone that he had in his hand it was because of what was behind the faith that he expressed there was a god behind that confession amen hallelujah you don't have to be bullied around you don't have to be pushed around we decide to do that we let him push us around he'll grow in confidence because it works until they do it to the wrong person amen you get this big brother right I remember being bullied I probably shouldn't tell the story so you might have to delete this out of the sermon but I remember in high school I was being bullied by this guy it didn't last very long but he he came up to me and and he says and he kind of shoved me like that against the the lockers and and you know and I don't know I don't know what was going through my mind but he shoved me up against the lockers like that and then he said you're a Christian right and I said yes and uh I don't know why he picked on me there was a lot of Christians in the school but he picked on me and and he and he did this and and he says you're a Christian right and and then he uh just as he said it I was I was just saying uh yes I'm a you know he hit me like this on the side of the head uh and um and and uh and you're just you're just waking up right what's happening here you know and it's and at in this you know you don't really get a whole lot of time to think this through you're just being bullied right it just kind of catches you off guard it's just wham bam you know what's going on here what's happening you know this is not normal right this is unusual behavior and so he what is he trying to do is trying to intimidate me right now I had a choice right but I'm trying to figure out okay he's trying to use the word again against me he's actually trying to use what I believe against me and so he and so when he hit me like that he says he says well if you're a Christian aren't you supposed to turn the other cheek you know what I did is I turned the other cheek and he hit me again I thought at that moment that you know maybe he'll get the point and you know he won't hit me but this was a bully see he's not interested in the truth he's not interested in the principles of the word he's not interested in any of those things he wants to intimidate you to rob you and you know what's funny I never thought past that scripture until that day but at that moment when he hit me again I realized it doesn't say anything else and I think he realized that as well after he hit me the second time man now it was like I've done my part I won't tell you the rest of the story but he never bullied me again never touched me again why because you have a right to defend yourself and you know that's what they're trying to do to Israel they're trying to tell them you don't have a right to defend yourself well that's their land nobody has a right to tell Israel they should not defend themselves they're surrounded by every kind of enemy enemies that want to see them wiped off the face of this Earth they have a right to defend themselves and somebody in Israel has to stand up and say I have a right to defend myself you have a right to defend yourself prde you have a right to stand against sickness say you have a right to stand against that devil it belongs to you the land is yours healing is yours Joy is yours happiness is yours and when you go from this Camp remember that that bully is going to be waiting at home for you that old gang is going to wait for you at school th those old habits and temptations they're going to be waiting for you but you have a right to say you cannot touch me anymore Hallelujah right you have no right Hallelujah will not bully me anymore you have to stand up for yourself you have to make a decision in your mind that this is not about my old family strain you know it's amazing you know that how the devil will use little things like that and just you know he'll it's amazing how elaborate and how beautiful he can present things and it oh it makes sense yeah so I guess it must be true excuse me old family strange you know it's amazing even a bastard born child brother Brandon fixed that he says the new birth fixes that I don't know who who was my mother and father I don't know where I was born from I don't know what kind of family strains are coming through my blood it doesn't matter you're a new creature I said you're a new creature in Christ Jesus all things are passed away that devil has no right to afflict you like that it's not about your your old family it's about your new family don't let him bully you like that don't let him push you around on those things stand up and defend yourself Satan you have no right to talk to me like that I'm a new creature in Christ Jesus I'm a Son of [Applause] God hallelujah I feel like an evangelist this morning praise the Lord it feels good huh Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah the message the power of decision power of decision that's right he says now friends I'm not trying to be rough but you can't baby Devils that's right you got to let them know who's boss I'm just reading the message for you you got to let them know who's boss uh excuse me greater is he that is in me than he that is in the world he says we're the boss now amen because Jesus is here our big brother our brother of redemption is here oh I love it amen I'm going to walk through the the hallways at school differently because big brother is with me I don't have to fear that bully anymore I can walk any hallway in the school from now on because greater is he that is in me do you see what I'm saying it doesn't matter where you go any you don't have to be afraid anymore even if you go through the valley of the shadow of death thou art with me you know I don't know I don't know um I think your national sport here is still rugby isn't it I used to play rugby and you know I used to be wing and it's amazing how they play this this this game of intimidation you know they'll put the big guy up against the little guy and you know they're try to unbalance things right to find weak spots and so forth and I remember being wing and and man that flanker used to come off the back into that scrum and and you know it's almost like he's got this grin on his face because he nose the little guy is on the wing and you know it's coming you know he's got the ball right but you know it's amazing how that I don't know why they designed rugby like this but you know the position of the wing he's kind of on the Blind Side of the field you know why not put two or three guys on The Blind Side but they you know they it's like I don't know it's a British game I guess but they put it on the put this guy on The Blind Side of the field in other words he's alone out there right they've got the big the PowerHouse the scrum you know they're they're there in the center of the field and and they're the where all the big muscle is you know all the big guys you know where you kind of want to hug close to them in a rugby game you know you know if you mess with me he's going to get to you you know this is he's my buddy you know we're on the same team you know he's just you know Rippling muscles and you know he's just you know you feel good because he's on your side right and then you've got the fast guys you've got the guy who can kick you've got all these specialty kind of uh skilled players on your team and man it's a great sport okay so we come over over here on the wing side and it's like you kind of stand there on the edge of the field and there's your big scrum team you know they've got they've got all the big guys there and they you've got all your fast Runners on that side all your buddies you know they're kind of a little bit of a distance away from you all of a sudden and here you are and the whole field is open on this side and it's just you and it's like the enemy knows that the enemy knows that you walk alone with God sometimes amen that you are there and and maybe you are the small guy on the team you're not really designed for these things amen so you've so you're kind of off balance you you feel like you are not evenly matched do you hear what I'm saying you feel like you're not evenly matched yet you have a position on the field now you have a choice as that big guy breaks free from their scrum remember the muscle team right there he comes Breaking Free from their side of the scrum he comes on The Blind Side of the field because he knows there's going to be this little weak guy standing there the idea is to intimidate by fear amen so I mean he comes running down that side side and he's got he's frothing at the mouth you know he's sweating he's you know and he's just you know he's just intimidating you you know what I'm saying he's coming down and all you see is it's like slow motion and you all you can picture is I'm going to get crushed this guy is going to destroy me but you have a choice to make why because you're in the position you have authority I'm the wingman amen I have a position I might not be big enough I might not be designed for this kind of uh off balance amen but yet you're in position do you see what I'm saying you have a job to do now if you let fear overcome you you're going to be crushed you will be crushed amen but if you know the weak spot because of training you see training Faith cometh by hearing right so now you stand there in a whole different way you see this guy Breaking Free you're not afraid because you know how to bring him down you know he's trying to intimidate you with his muscles and all these things but it doesn't matter if you wrap up his legs he going to fall like anybody else it doesn't matter how big he is it doesn't matter how fast he is it doesn't matter how well he's trained my brother and sister if you just apply this basic rules of combat if you apply the basic rules rugby is like combat right if you apply the basic rules of of rugby you will bring him down amen it doesn't matter so you have authority you have Insight you have Revelation on what his weak spot is amen when he breaks free and he's smiling at you I smile back at him I've got you you're not coming over this line amen you're going to come this far far and no further amen why because I'm going to wrap up your legs and you're going to come falling down you see what I'm saying it depends on how we see things but see the devil wants to put us in a position of a victim I'm a victim I'm going to get hurt I'm going to get crushed oh he did it to me before oh it's going to hurt my brother and sister you know there was a um I'm sorry this is not in my notes but there was a there was a champion of of New Zealand John alamu that big guy right I mean oh they feared him on the rugby Fields right they feared him he would just plow over people but you know the South African rugby team figured him out right they figured him out yeah they realized you know when they when that guy broke free you know what they did they had prayer meetings they said come we need to gather together because we can bring them down if we stay together if we stand together don't leave somebody exposed on the field yes he's big but we can bring him down if we stay together and they would grab a hold of each other as they went in to tackle that guy and yes it it would be hard and it would be heavy but they had somebody with them they felt the strength of one another on the field hallelujah hallelujah I'm talking about bullies in our lives Don't Be Afraid we have all the resources to overcome gather together grab a hold of one another like that prayer line last night there's no bully big enough David and Goliath we need to talk about David and Goliath amen they showed up to the battlefield with anticipation you can imagine how they felt coming to that Battlefield that day the army of Israel and the army of the Philistines what a setting amen and they both these armies in their battle array coming with they've got their own Kings they've got their own uh Champions they've got their own uh archers and weap of warfare and man what a what a scene huh and can you imagine Israel showing up to the Battlefront we have our King we have our our weapons of warfare we've been trained in the in the Battle of and and the and the Art of War and all these things we know Maneuvers we know all these things amen and then they show up to this Valley and they can look across the other side and something happens no doubt is Israel was not planning on losing the battle that day they didn't show up to this battle you know like oh we're going to lose and oh well I guess we just need to go through the motions no you show up to win you're going to imagine those young soldiers the younger generation that was standing there it didn't matter that Saul had his head in the wrong place but you you think of those young men that was standing there that day they were there to do battle they were there to fight the enemy they were there to to win a victory for Israel but something happened on this day I want to show you the power of fear but it had to be given to the enemy 1st Samuel 17:2 says and Saul and the men of Israel were gathered together and they pitched by the valley of Ella and set the battle in Array against the Philistines everything was in order amen they had their cook there they had everything everything was good right it's not like they were lacking anything they had everything the enemy had you know they even had their own champion and the Philistines stood on a mountain on the other side and Israel stood on a mountain on the other side and there was a valley between them there's a CM there's a there's a dividing line but something was different this day this is not going to be a regular conflict you see the Philistines had figured out if we come head-to-head with these guys you know it doesn't bode well for us we need to change the tactics we need to play a different strategy we got to have a different maneuver because they beat us on on these uh on every other strategy they they seem to overwhelm us they seem to overcome us we don't understand it so we got to change our game so they start to play a different game and this game is going to be a battle of the mind not a battle of man against man Army against Army this was the regular way of of of of of warfare of that day you know man against man spear against Spear Shield against Shield they said we got to change this you know they were afraid of is Israel well we got to change this because you know they know that they can defeat us we got to that's where we got to attack them is in the mind we got to change our battle strategy let's attack it attack them in the mind and verse four says and there went out oh my how many hairs met this Champion there went out a champion out of the camp of the Philistines named Goliath of gath whose height was six cubits and a span verse 5 says and he had a helmet of brass upon his head and he was armed with a coat of mail and the weight of the coat of was 5,000 shekels of brass oh man weighing out the enemy it's amazing how you know the whole Army shows up there's no details given about the armies but there's so much detail given about this Champion you know it's like they had a lot of time to look at this guy in other words they stopped long enough to really hone in on the details of this bad guy this bully they saw everything they saw how many shackles of weight and they saw the kind of spear he had they saw how tall he was you know you stop long enough the devil will start playing games with your mind just stop long enough you hear that music you hear this or you smell this and you stop long enough and you start to remember things you start to see things the mind right the devil is playing a trick on your mind had a helmet of brass you think any of these things any of these facts I mean it's amazing you can have those War uh strategists you know that and analysts that look at at a battle and they'll say there's so many of these guys so many of these guys and do you know those things just don't matter how many times has the underdog won the battle in in the face of great odds in the face of of whatever the numbers were it doesn't even matter what about Moses against all of Egypt do you see what I'm saying this is the kind of God we serve it doesn't matter how strong the enemy looks it doesn't matter how many there is there's always more of us amen don't let the devil play games with your mind but I love how the scripture here you know and he had gaves of brass even the language is so dramatic right gaves of brass upon his legs and a target of brass between his shoulders you know thankful for that you know this um I got to be careful here but you know in the Bor War there was there was uh it was interesting you know how the British would have targets literally on their chest shoot here right here this guy he has a target of brass I'm just reading the scripture here he has a target of brass between his shoulders between his shoulders right shoot here here I mean it's my point is we see the enemy's weak spot we noted it's been well identified it's been well laid out this is where his weak spot is if you just wrap up his legs he will come down if you resist the devil he will flee cast down reasonings the target is well painted it's almost like somebody went ahead painted a Target all over the enemy amen shoot here it'll kill him right and the staff of his spear was like a Weaver's beam who cares and his Spear's head weighed 600 shekels of iron who cares amen and one bearing a shield went before him who to do do you see what I'm saying it depends on how you approach the story but brother Chris he was he was so tall he's a they call him a champion I don't care what they call him amen I'm a Son of God I don't care what label they put on it cancer depression right suicide I don't care what label they put on their Champion I'm a Son of God I care only about the label that I have who cares about what they call that enemy who cares about those things my brother and sister those things sometimes you know somebody will say you've been diagnosed with cancer and it's like this wave of fear a champion came out from the philistine Camp his name is cancer who cares you know that even cancer will not stand in front of you we've seen two cases in our church where people have been healed from cancer specifically where it's documented well you know well known we don't have to fear the the champion of the enemy's Camp it doesn't matter what they call him it doesn't matter the size of his Spear and and even was brother Chris he was big he's a big guy big guy how many here is afraid of fighting a giant how many here would would honestly be afraid of fighting a giant right when we think of giants how big would a giant have to be for you to be afraid of him he would have to be ginormous you know that this guy was not that big I know you know he was not that big if you go look it up he was he was not even 10 feet you know he was not even 10 ft it's amazing that he wasn't 10 ft you know that because 10 would be like a nice complete number Perfection fullness he's not even that he's just like 9 ft n something you know somebody actually took the trouble to go measure him out he he's not he did not even reach the full length you know he's just like this half-baked enemy right 9 N now if if I'm standing on the stage I'm not very tall okay but 9'9 would just be like right here you know he wouldn't be you know what I mean he would fit through the doorway here and he would he do you know what I'm saying he's not that big but it's amazing how the whole Army of Israel halted in their Advance stopped at the valley looked across and a champion comes out and he's got this little guy in front of him who cares about the little guy you know um it's as simple as like you know you take care of the little guy and us five we'll take care of Goliath where were the Mighty Men where my question is where were the soldiers where were the Special Teams where was The Archers you know it would take one Arrow to bring down Goliath one measly little arrow you know I could just see excuse me I could I could just see Goliath coming out of his Philistine camp with his big boasts Target on him and some little Archer from the Israeli side right just being like Oh who's that guy and here's here's the boast of the Philistine just about to come out hero right do you know what I'm saying why are we so afraid but it's amazing how that little Archer you know I mean there was probably a hundred of these archers hundred of them you know just start shooting arrows Man start throwing rocks do whatever you got to do but get rid of that Philistine he doesn't have power over you but the longer you sit around the longer you wait oh he he has a message for you all right but if you let him speak oh you you're giving him power now right oh Israel right right who cares what he has to say I you know that's so frustrating right you're just wasting our time wasting my time eating up my day I could be fellowshipping with my family I could be in prayer I could be reading I could be listening to a message and here I am stuck in front of this Valley and I'm actually you know literally like like waiting in respect because we're you know we're so British right we're so respectful you know you have a turn to say your peace don't give him a a chance to say his peace they actually allowed this devil right this Champion to speak up I say don't let him resist the devil I love Israel's war tactics they strike first if they get a wind that the enemy is coming they don't wait for them to strike right they don't wait for for reasoning to develop they don't wait for you know okay this is where I've been for the last 10 years and and this is the cycle that I'm in yeah you're creating this world because it's not the world that he has given you to live in amen is we're in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus there's therefore now no condemnation so why do we fear why do we allow these Cycles to to develop in our lives we allow those things we literally give him the space okay devil I I'm ready now we can sit nicely here's your cup of tea here's my cup of tea and and and I'm here to listen and and hear you out you don't have to hear him out nobody cares what he has to say cuz it's not true it's not true amen amen or you're incapable well he said that greater is he that is in me that is on the world but my brother and sister why are you sitting at a table arguing with the devil why have you given him room you know to me the story of David and Goliath is such a it's such a mindblowing experience this Army of Israel would allow this man even to step foot out of line don't let the devil even move without your permission don't let him do a thing don't let him come into your home don't let him come into your families don't let him come into your body don't let him come into your mind without anything he's not allowed to if you see him get out of line my brother and sister you pick up a bow and arrow and you shoot him Hallelujah resist the devil you feel that little anxiety coming Satan I resist you you have no right here amen what does that guy think he's doing right do you see what I'm saying my brother and sister take the word of God at Thy word Lord you feel that little pain come off that to remind you what the doctor said and don't go sit at the table and have a debate about it just say by your stripes I'm Healed I'm a Son of God Satan you have no right to afflict me anymore amen and he stood and Cried unto the armies of Israel it should never have gotten this far and said unto them why are you come out to set your battle in Array why did you come to fight us wait a second do you know what I mean you know have you ever had somebody come and ask you questions and it's like why is he asking me these questions trying to belittle me he trying to make me feel inferior it's trying to cause confusion but the funny thing is we try and answer his questions and in trying to answer his questions we give him power because now we're feeding him he doesn't know anything why have you come to fight us uh we've come here to destroy you you're our enemy amen am not I a Philistine and you Servants of Saul yeah right even the devil knows that he is the Son of God right choose you a man for you and let him come down to me like I said we should never have gotten to this place we wait for some great ministry to rise we wait for some choose you something to match me you know our churches should never get get to a place where we're trying to match what they're doing in the denominations choose you a man choose you somebody to can that can confront me that can match me in his mind he's thinking you know he's a little bit taller than everybody else maybe by 3 feet 2 and a half fet something like that right which is not a big deal but he thinks he's a little bit bigger so he's saying why don't you choose yourself a champion you know if you guys are Israelites I'm a Philistine in other words I'm changing the Battle Tactics I'm going to just set new rules who who came up with these rules anyway right the the the Israelites should be standing there and going he doesn't get to make the rules you know it's amazing you know we look at the um I don't mean to pick on America again brother that's the last service but you know in the Civil War they would they would like line up across the field from each other man for man and it's like you get to shoot first and then we will fire a volley who came up with these rules just attack do you know what I'm saying why are we following these rules you know and then they would uh the snipers kind of were developed in this era and they and they would have a guy hiding up in a tree and he would shoot out the the the the officers and the commanders and so forth to break down Communications and so forth but you know those snipers in that day it was kind of a cowardly thing but if you're asking me it's brilliant it's brilliant amen you see we've been given weapons our weapons of our Warfare are not carnal but the devil wants us to match him man for man he wants us to match him in a carnal way with reasonings and with explanations and with emotions and with feelings he wants us to match a man for man when we have a god when we have a word the weapons of our Warfare are not carnal but we have spiritual weapons amen bring you out a man I mean like I say what a stupid thing to do uh uh I guess the rules are changing we have to Now find somebody do you see the confusion there and he knows you're not going to find somebody exactly as tall as him right what they should have done is said okay we accept your challenge gone back rallied the Army and attacked we're not going to listen to this guy's rules we're not going to listen to his dictates we're not going to let him manipulate us match him man are you kidding me do you see what I'm saying my my brother and sister we're going to go through this week we're going to go through next month and you're immediately going to be faced with this thing you're going to be matching the devil on his ground and he's going to make you believe that you have to come up with some explanation you have to feel good that you know he's going to say you know you felt so good at camp now you feel like this whose rules are you playing by anyway when he said that he is my joy he's my salvation Hallelujah don't don't go into the valley and match him man for man there's no rule book saying that you have to do that but see the bully knows that if he can get you to believe you have to do that then he can manipulate you he can control you that's why I say sometimes you hear these things and it's like what have you been listening to who have you been listening to listen to The Voice he'll tell you who you really are amen praise the Lord I don't want to keep you too long but let's let's just move through this little story here and if he be able to fight with me and to kill me then will he be your servants we will be your servants but if I Prevail against him and kill him then shall you be our servants and serve us okay like I say I'm trying to preach it in a light that that makes you realize how silly the devil is but his boast can be so convincing you know it's amazing how that whole Army halted came to a complete standstill just with that one voice we also have a voice amen it's inside of us and the Philistines said I defy the armies of Israel this day give me a man that we may fight together together you know what's amazing my brother and sister is even in this the Lord heard that and he said well if you want to play by those rules I will send you a man but he will not be a man that you think he will be amen I will be in him he God did not play by the devil's rules he did not come and mess around with the devil amen you know what he did he came with his man amen he the king of kings he was the champion of Israel David was not alone on that field it was not a stone that killed Phil the Philistine the prophet says that the Holy Ghost God got a hold of that stone God got in the Supernatural got in that stone and found its Mark between that Philistines helmet crushed his head amen because there was a mind battle the God knows where to strike the enemy one man with one big boast trying to intimidate the whole Israelite Army causing fear and basically paralyzing the army of Israel when Saul and Israel heard those words of the Philistine they were dismayed wow big surprise right and greatly afraid yeah if you're going to listen to him see this was not the regular enemy this was not regular tactics and yet it caused the whole Army the whole advance to come to a complete standstill one day you know it's amazing how that he came out there and he made his boast and the and the and Israel did not have a clue what to do not a clue he would come out one day and he would make this boast and that one day you know maybe the the soldiers and the Israelites side they would say well you know Saul is is he's got a plan you know they're they're over there they're making a plan he's he's he's going to choose a champion he's going to find a way for us you know they're believing it's it's amazing how you know that your family sometimes can be can have such faith and trust in their in their father or their mother they're going to do something about it but on the other side the father and mother's in such fear they're so so paralyzed by the the thing that's happening but the whole Army is depending on the headship the whole Army is depending on their leader to make the right decision to do the right thing amen and one day would lead into two I guess maybe today then two days would lead into three days and as these days progress my brother and sister it becomes more and more complicated more and more stories come up more and more rumors more and more explanations we're just waiting for the right season we're just waiting for him to get tired out there we're just waiting for this we're just waiting for that right next Sunday I'll do it more explanations not to have Victory when it would take a moment like I said it would take one Arrow to defeat that enemy it would take one spear it would take just a small group of men who cares if 30 30 Brothers went out there on the battlefield and took down that Philistine who cares we're not playing by the devil's rules am amen and more reasoning Creeps in as time goes on the Philistine says Drew near this is verse 16 the Philistine Drew near morning and evening and presented himself for 40 days 40 days you would think somebody would get tired of that and I'm sure they had many psychologists suddenly among them trying to help them cope trying to help them put Band-Aids on their emotions and their feelings and they're this and we're a victim and and we're not strong enough and you see how sad it gets and when it was right there at the beginning somebody should have risen somebody should have stood up and said enough is enough you don't have to wait 40 days this next go around you don't have to wait for the cycle to play out we're not playing games with a devil we're the boss amen we're calling the shots the devil may try a different strategy a new angle but God has already seen his move God has a counter move coming amen his word will meet every condition he sees the trouble that you may have been in but he calls a stop to the enemy amen and so Jesse said unto David his son isn't that amazing I want you to notice David was not in that atmosphere of reasoning and doubt and fear he was in his father's house amen he was he was in his position he was tending to the Sheep and he tells him to take food take an epha of this porch corn and these 10 Loaves and run to the camp run the race go quickly his father tells him go quickly amen here's the champion coming amen you go quickly to your brethren go to the front lines go to where the battle is amen and carry these 10 cheeses how many here likes cheese I love cheese and the captain of their thousand and look how thy brethren farare go and knock on the door of your brother and how are you doing brother we haven't seen you in a long time but I bring you some good tidings I bring you the word today amen I haven't seen you in a long time and why are you depressed what's what's going on here we haven't heard news of the victory we haven't we haven't received a testimony of your defeat over the Philistines amen we have not heard news from the camp of Israel so I've come to find out how are you doing and what are you doing amen but he doesn't just come rebuking there's no condemnation he just comes with food amen have you have you taken a look it's almost like hey we need to talk right do you know who you are do do you know here eat a little bit of this eat a little bit of this hidden mana come to camp this this year amen find out who you really are amen how are you doing what's your condition like why have I not received the testimony of you defeating the Philistines come and find out how your brethren are doing Hallelujah and he brings food with him amen CU his word will meet the condition there was trouble in the camp but he brings food a young boy comes with food I love how God does things he's going to prove he doesn't need an army he doesn't need soldiers he doesn't need any of these things but he has seen the bully you know when I when I did this at church I had a picture of four kind of gangster looking guys on the screen you know we've had four horse riders riding through the ages the church ages trying to bully this church into submission but God sends a man Hallelujah God sends a voice amen with food and he said at one time in the face of a man who knowed god brother brandham saying this he says not just a military trained man he knowed nothing about it but he knowed God that little old David the Bible said he was a ruddy little bitty old fellow come out there stoop should fered a little sack on his side here excuse me and a little script bag with some sheep food in it come up there to find to visit his brothers he said you mean to tell me that you'll let that uncircumcised Philistines stand there and defy the armies of the of the Living God saying the days of Miracles has passed oh my what a man was that was he says the least man in the whole bunch just a little kid David who was not even part of the regular army he was not a soldier he was not there he had not gone through the training and Maneuvers he did not need those things you might say brother Chris I don't know all the right quotes I don't know just what to say I don't know how to respond or what to do it doesn't matter you have God you don't have to understand everything just take God Amen he says but he know he said one day a lion come in and got his got my father's sheep and took it out I went after him with my little slingshot and I brought him back a bear come in and I slew the bear he said and the same God hallelujah that delivered me from The Lion and from the bear will deliver that uncircumcised Philistine into my hands and stop him if you could oh Saul he says they just brought him up before Saul the general and Saul said you know you know what Saul was going to dress him in his insecurities that's the robe of Saul at this moment amen here you need armor you need to protect yourself you need to this and and here's a little bit of psychology here's a little bit of emotions here's a little bit of Feelgood and really all these weights that got added onto David to the point where he says I don't even understand how this works it's so complicated oh sometimes we can get so complicated we can't even move but David recognized his strength his power was not in those things our strength is not in our security insecurities our strength is not in our reasonings my brother and sister our strength is in the word you see what I mean by laying aside just stop stop the cycle you know you say well I go through this every time just you got to break that next time that starts just lay it aside just say I'm not doing this go the other way just throw down Saul's armor amen he says now try on my vest he put on that great big thing on poor little David was bowlegged with it on he come to find out that his ecclesiastical vest didn't fit a man of God so he said throw the thing off I don't know nothing about it I don't know nothing about this here all this here how you how to say Amen just right and how the your word and grammar has to be just right like in those Catholic you know the cathedrals those those holes of death right ah man you know just you got to say it just right and it's just everything done so perfectly but there's no but there's a Philistine out there right who cares about all these great things here the treasures and the the the Big Show and those things and yet you can have all those things and yet that enemy out there has paralyzed your faith you know what happened he says you just throw that thing off you don't know nothing about it just let me go the way that I have trusted God let me go with what I can trust in amen you know what happened sure he was persistent not one quiver in his blood walked out there and picked up five rocks j s u s wrap the slingshot in five fingers f a i t h faith in Jesus Christ and here he come trus in God to do the rest like I said like that little wingman just standing out there just be in position just be at the right place at the right time God will take care of the rest Hallelujah why because greater is he that is in me oh the enemy might see a little boy the enemy might see a little wingman standing there small in stature not strong enough but he doesn't see what's behind the veil on Hallelujah that's all you have to do have faith in Jesus his death burial Resurrection his omnipresence his being right now his promise his gifts his manifestation that's all you need to do have faith and meet any kind of obstacle if it's called cancer Paralis whatever it is meet him on those grounds the god that can raise up your sinful soul from a life of sin can surely set you free from any sickness or disease that you've got you've got to have that you've got to have that kind of Faith be persistent hold on to it don't turn loose from it you see that's right but you can't Bluff it it won't take a bluff you might be all right to Bluff around here Get Over Yonder and meet a witch doctors and them them Devils out there don't you try to Bluff them you've got to have what you're talking about on the mission field correctly now it says your intellectual group here in America sorry I didn't see this we'll just include everybody amen you're an intellectual group here in America they take intellectual things that's the reason the ministry didn't go too good here just intellectual but I wasn't sent to that group anyhow I was sent to the group like Abraham was one that was called out yes sir praise the Lord hallelujah see we're not bluffing where the it's a real thing I'm going to skip through some of this go look up bully and the message and all these great Heroes of the faith and draw strength from what they did amen and look at the Simplicity of how they defeated the enemy and their in their lives let me close with this I just I like this story I think you know we um it's such an interesting day we live in you know it's such a weird um kind of a fluffy yeah generation you know don't don't discipline your children don't don't correct anybody you know in school you you don't fail anymore you just you know um you meet expectations or you or you you know have room for improvement or you know don't don't be negative you know don't be they just want to neutralize everything there's no more conviction there's no more strength there's no more identity that's the plan of the devil is to make you think you can do whatever you want you know everybody's a victim anyhow so just kind of find your own way find find a find your own identity no your identity is already written and you'll only have freedom once you recognize who you are in Christ you'll only have real happiness real satisfaction when you I just receive who go God is and who you are in Christ amen amen otherwise the devil will beat you around that bush he will make you dress certain ways he will make you you know follow the Fashions what are you you are struggling for life you are you're in a sad pitiful condition the devil beating you around then you come from this fashion to this fashion one day you're a hippie the next day you're a rock and roll guy the next day you're you're some you know whatever heavy metal I mean you know all these different Fashions the devil trying to say these are the rules we got to play by this is your ident ID it this is who you are no it's not right do you see what I'm saying manipulating you bullying you you'll only be happy when you come his way there's only real Joy real peace try I've been tempted by all those things I went through high school I went through public school I went through all those things and I'm here to stand today that there is a keeping power in the name of Jesus Christ and I'm happier here today I am so happy with who I am with what Christ has done for meu you don't have to follow the Fashions of this world you know I have I'm so disconnected my wife has to tell me what to dress how to dress what colors to put on right yeah I'm happy in Christ amen be happy with who you are with what God has done for you who he's made you to be the devil will try and make you something you're not and that'll be a losing battle you'll never be satisfied but I think you know we we've come to this place kind of like where it's a woke Society it's there's a victimized kind of mentality you know it's so much so you know you hear the news where they say like you know this person was was harassed or this person was was um molested and so they are this victim and then suddenly there's 50 other people that were molested by the same person and then they have to spend years in court trying to dissect who was actually molested who was not actually who's just here trying to get a a free handout who's this and but it's this Spirit of like oh this is a freebie right this is a I I can be a part of this group I want to be a part of the victim group do you know what I'm saying my brother and sister we got to be careful with that spirit it's okay to recognize that you got hurt and it's okay to recognize the enemy it's okay to recognize his tactics but when you see him take a foot into your door slam the door shut you're not a victim you're an overcomer in Christ and yes he's done horrible things he's done crazy things to us my brother and sister and we go through lonely places but we are more than Overcomers don't settle for anything less hallelujah it's time to lay aside the weights in other words lay aside I'm a victim lay aside my hurt oh I wasn't treated right or I was I was I was not justly uh uh treated or maybe unfairly treated or maybe a business deal went bad or maybe you know it's how many here do business with Believers right business with Believers I love doing business with believers they're just they're Fair they're honest amen don't let the devil lie to you amen if you've had a bad experience that's not the truth that's just somebody who let the devil in the door amen and had a weak moment but we are honest we are fair Believers amen you see what I'm saying it's a mindset how many here believes that we are divided go read the message on on that opinion you know the prophet says that we are not divided amen we are one body who said we are divided anyhow oh but brother Co look at this and don't do you see what I'm saying we are not divided we got to change the way we talk we got to change our confession we got to we the devil's been lying to us the devil's been trying to subdue us when we're supposed to be subduing the devil that's right don't let him intimidate you amen he says when you got the message just keep going amen you say I can't walk up again no I'm getting weak he says just keep on going don't stop I'm closing musicians can come laying everything aside everything aside you see what I'm saying today lay it aside yes I've been betrayed yeah so was Jesus you're in good company by the way CU when you look in the scriptures and you see who was betrayed I would rather be the one being betrayed than the one betraying so I'm in good company do you see what I'm saying find the good in it my brother and sister look to God and and if you were betrayed it doesn't matter he said he would never leave you nor forsake you he who is greater who is bigger who's your savior who's omnipresent omniscient who's a very present help in time of need he's everything you have need of just keep going laying aside everything just keep cutting through brother you got the sword in your hand hand just keep chopping away I went into a football stadium the prophet saying this one time so I guess we did rugby today prophets going talk about football so he went into a football stadium one day and I was going to preach amen and I stopped at the door and looked up up there it said it's not the size of the dog and the fight it's the size of the fight and the dog so that's what wins the battle greater is he that is in you than he that is the world Amen you say well look look at all the great churches that are against this I don't care what size they are it's the fight that's in the dark that's what counts it's the faith that's in the individual oo it's the faith that's in you you know how simple that is God I believe a little dark come you know darkness comes a little fear comes a little anxiety Lord I believe anyhow amen you just keep doing that you know what's amazing if you want to change your environment your Your Atmosphere you have power to do that you know that you have power to do that and it comes from here I was at uh in a commercial kind of a environment um doing electrical work and I I'll be honest with you I got

time when you get up tomorrow morning when you get up when you get up out of your bed he says the first thing you do is you say I do this in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and I thought whoa what what are you saying dad he's like he's like Chris haven't you realized you're in a battle there's there's somebody maybe at work that needs to be saved there's somebody you're in a battle Chris you need to press through and the way you press through is change your thinking Have Faith H you know don't look at the job don't look at the conditions don't play by the devil's rules there's something

of his grace his Mercy we have a purpose we have one purpose amen God told him to hold a Revival he's washing the windows on down he said we don't allow revivals around here who gave him the right to

devil knew that that that the Lord was working something in my life when I was doing that job and doing that commercial work you know and um changed my atmosphere it changed the way I approached work I changed my attitude I showed up to work early you know I I prayed you know you just you're just in a different atmosphere and you know two years later I saw the reason for why those things happen you know sometimes it takes a long time time but but nonetheless you're fighting a battle you're fighting the good fight of Faith amen don't be wearied don't let your mind become weary amen change your attitude change your approach and and I didn't know that there was a testimony coming at the end of two years now what if I'd let myself be U become uh uh succumb to those those conditions and and those lies of the devil my brother and sister I would never have found out what was happen what was going to happen at the end of two years I would have changed my job and I and I can promise you I would have been just as miserable at the next job would not have solved anything amen but here two years later you know I got a I got a call from the the boss and he said um Chris you know can you come to the office I showed up to his office and he said uh we have an interesting kind of a job for you to go do we had the RCMP has called us and asked for a man to come and do electrical work for them and uh you know we need somebody who does not smoke who does not drink he has a clean record huh here's Chris working away I'm speaking of the third person right it's because I'm telling my story so here here I am working away not realizing what's happening I've just created this atmosphere but there's a testimony ringing out right all the other guys there they were they were kind of you know druggies say smoke you know how traits people can be sometimes not all of them are like that but this this job was just like that that's why it war on me right just made me weary but my brother and sister I was taking back the land amen and at the end of this job they said Can can we have a a guy do you know anybody and they said yeah we know a guy he doesn't drink he's kind of odd he's always happy but he's got no track Rec he's got no criminal record he's got you know he's living a clean life he doesn't even hang out on our trailer where all the pornography is and stuff he he eats his lunch in his truck is such a weirdo but yeah you can trust him he's not going to be influenced he's not going to be swayed by anything he's not going to be bullied he's not going to be bribed that's what the RCMP the the police were looking for right and so they said okay fine we'll take that guy and so I got this call you know and it's amazing how the Lord does something you know he he honors your confession and suddenly what was a boring job suddenly became super exciting you know Air India flight 182 I think it was that went down they it was a mystery and then and then they realized it was a terrorist attack well they took that airplane in all those pieces and they brought it to Canada and first they had it in Toronto there I believe and and they were doing a uh you know like a investigation and trying to put all the pieces together then they were threatened there right and so they they moved that whole operation to Vancouver BC and it was in an underground parking lot and kind of like all hush hush right and uh and they were putting it together but they needed it they needed an electrician to put Power to things and connect things up how does that work right how does that happen here I show up at this job it was going to be so exciting now I mean you're working with police and tactical teams and and and you you have to sign a a way for you know not to foreclose anything or anything for five years and you know so on and and you're not allowed to talk about these things it's all hush hush and and I get to work with these forensic guys and these policemen and and investigators and they show me how through 3D uh uh illustrations and things they can put the plane back together how the explosion happened we know what happened here and this I mean this is how I SP spend my days for like the next 6 months working with these policemen and it was great it was exciting but how did I get there that's why I say my brother and sister change your thinking it's

four actually because I want to thank Sharon and Emma was Emma working in the taking their time in the morning and the getting up early and starting the coffee machine and doing all that and um now one of you I've often said one of our successes the reasons why we've been successful here is because the attitude have in our fellowship is we always respect the ministry and especially the pastor we it's just something we've always pushed because there's a blessing in that um but I must say brother Ben and Sister Christine make that extremely easy you know it's like this is not hard this why doesn't everyone do it you know no um so um let's I see brother EDS making his way up here I come come up here brother Ben Sister Christine they they um it hasn't been an easy year for them not going to lie to you you know they they it's been it's been hard for them they've battled through you know we don't see that we just we just sort of come here and they're praising the Lord and Ben sister Christina's you know but they they do go through a lot and it's not easy for them to come up on the stage you know it it isn't easy for them and you know the the truth be none they probably won't get much recognition to the other side of everything you know and and not much understanding you know of really what they have to go through you know that that's just the that's just the way that it is sometimes you know and and even the Lord has it that way he just sort of you know he knows hey you can do this just carry on through but you know but we in our hearts as people we we get a little snippet of what they go through and we we we just want to like we can't sometimes we can't do any do anything give them something we we try do what we can but you know it's just even to just appreciate to know you know look we do really love you being here and we we really love having a pastor and a pastor's wife we just love it so much like I was sitting there thinking I'll be so sad if like they live somewhere I'd actually cry I'd be like oh no you know like if we didn't have you anymore I'd be so sad you know I that's you'd be tooa like I I would Cry tears now I don't cry man I'm a big man you know but I would seriously be in my heart be very sad you know I and I genuinely mean that you know so I I I can't really say enough but I just I I think we all really appreciate that you've had a hard year it's been rough but you just did it anyway you know and and and we've and and we've had all this you know and and really you know if if if you didn't want to take the burden of everything then this wouldn't actually be here I want to acknowledge that you know it's got to the Buck's got to stop somewhere you know that's how we offr as humans and the buck stops with you bro and that's a hard job you know and thanks man really mean it and thank [Music] you um now brother Kubin and brother Ed are going to lead us in the last song and then brother um kubin's going to close
