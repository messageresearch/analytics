[38:18] very much sweating even before I start
[38:21] but please forgive me we won't be long
[38:24] tonight and um
[38:26] so I was just asking you whether you
[38:28] love the Lord
[38:30] because we need to mean it when we say
[38:32] we love the Lord
[38:33] and I'm there isn't I'm sweating
[38:37] tonight you know ministers feel that
[38:40] they are unworthy to stand here and it's
[38:43] true we aren't ready
[38:45] Who Am I who are you who are we to stand
[38:48] in the in the presence of the Living God
[38:50] you know and the presence of God's
[38:53] children the bride and then talk
[38:55] you know but God made it that through
[38:58] the foolishness of preaching he can save
[39:00] man
[39:01] so I'm very nervous and and feel
[39:05] unworthy feel unprepared
[39:07] uh yet I think I have prepared but is
[39:10] the Lord who does the work
[39:13] so my challenge to you tonight not the
[39:15] challenge in a rude way you know we
[39:18] bring our attitudes to church so uh each
[39:22] one comes with an attitude
[39:24] we have an attitude this this evening
[39:26] the key is which attitude you have
[39:31] is it a God's attitude a positive
[39:33] attitude an expecting attitude or is the
[39:36] wrong one ah how is my attitude tonight
[39:39] so so if I'm never saying I'm so
[39:42] unsettled by Marion and I'm so
[39:45] and easy
[39:47] I I want to believe that you are
[39:50] supposed to be the same way
[39:52] all right ah it cannot be me the
[39:55] preacher only
[39:57] amen this is the service of the Lord I'm
[39:59] I'm feeling I'm standing in front of
[40:01] people who are ordained by God
[40:04] the the apple of God's eye
[40:07] the people who God will die for them
[40:10] in the presence of God and you you came
[40:14] prayed up to receive to hear from God
[40:17] not me forget about me
[40:20] from God
[40:21] and then you are standing in front of
[40:23] him if you remove this little vessel and
[40:27] you see God preaching to you ah how will
[40:30] your attitude be
[40:32] I think I'll be nervous
[40:35] I'll count my steps I won't be
[40:38] scattering and talking and say with
[40:41] someone and my my thoughts are outside
[40:43] there that is so disrespectful for God
[40:47] and that is why I said do you love him
[40:50] ah one day he said to Peter do you love
[40:53] me
[40:54] and he asked him three times and Peter
[40:57] cried
[40:58] I believe
[40:59] except you know you know everything Lord
[41:03] because he was asking him with emphasis
[41:05] are you sure you love me
[41:09] so
[41:10] I pray that when we say we love the Lord
[41:13] we want to mean it from the bottom of
[41:15] our hearts and be nervous not nervous of
[41:20] you know afraid of he's gonna kill me or
[41:23] what no no the sensitivity of being in
[41:25] the presence of God to know as brother
[41:28] Marcus was saying that to know this is
[41:30] life or death
[41:32] I cannot come here with the wrong
[41:33] attitude I can't come here with a
[41:35] negative one I can't come here like I'm
[41:38] going to you know for Bunnings
[41:41] oh my God no amen come on no I better
[41:44] not come huh I better not come I cannot
[41:47] come here sorry sorry to bug you and
[41:50] sleep
[41:51] or I sleep with my eyes open with my
[41:54] mouth open but I'm sleeping
[41:57] my mind is there
[41:59] walking there and training and thinking
[42:02] about another brother or the meal I ate
[42:04] tonight
[42:05] or the problems of tomorrow or yesterday
[42:07] really in the presence of God
[42:11] do I love him enough
[42:13] yes Lord you know when a man if you you
[42:16] love your wife you love your children
[42:18] you love your husband then you love your
[42:19] your your loved ones eh and you tell
[42:23] them every day how much you love them
[42:25] you think love for them every day and
[42:28] then you you you you express it to them
[42:31] but
[42:32] why are we not doing it for the Lord
[42:34] like that
[42:35] if we love him
[42:37] why why do we have reasons why we are
[42:40] not doing it
[42:42] do we love him enough
[42:44] but that's not our title tonight I just
[42:46] thought I should pass past that tonight
[42:49] let's just continue with that scripture
[42:52] of Genesis verse 15. and the angel of
[42:56] the Lord called This is now Abraham has
[42:58] walked the the road of Moriah he has
[43:02] gone to Mariah he has walked three days
[43:04] the Bible says he has walked three days
[43:06] right and then uh you can think about
[43:10] what was happening in his mind and in
[43:12] the mind of the servants and in the
[43:14] Bible says in the mind of Isaac at least
[43:16] the Bible tells us what Isaac was
[43:18] thinking says Isaac was not sure where
[43:22] the the animal is going to come from
[43:24] Isaac was
[43:26] Isaac
[43:29] was wondering what's going to happen
[43:32] right he walked like Jenny Abraham was
[43:35] not worried or or second thoughts in his
[43:39] mind because God told him go there
[43:42] Abraham knew very well that he's going
[43:44] to sacrifice his son for God that's what
[43:46] Abraham knew the sons and the brothers
[43:49] they knew they did not know the servants
[43:51] and Isaac they were wondering three days
[43:57] verse 16 says
[43:59] oh there's 50 and the angel of the Lord
[44:01] called unto Abraham Out of Heaven the
[44:03] second time
[44:05] and said
[44:06] by myself have I saw said the Lord
[44:11] for because thou has done this thing
[44:13] this thing of trusting in me this thing
[44:17] of believing in me fully
[44:20] Against All Odds this thing of believing
[44:24] in me where is really impossible
[44:28] how can you go and kill your son for for
[44:31] because you have done this thing
[44:34] and has not withheld thy son thine only
[44:38] son
[44:39] that in blessing
[44:42] I Will Bless thee and in multiplying
[44:44] I'll multiply we know the scripture
[44:47] let's quickly go to verse 18. and in in
[44:50] thy seed which is you
[44:54] you and me are the seed of
[44:57] which means we also have to walk the the
[45:00] road of Mount Moriah
[45:02] if God tells us go to Mount Moriah which
[45:05] means we because we are deceit right
[45:07] isn't it you know they say
[45:10] I'll tell you in my language and then
[45:12] I'll translate it for you maybe brother
[45:13] Indian brother Ben will understand me
[45:16] in my language they say
[45:19] um
[45:30] this is now I want to give you a direct
[45:32] translation
[45:34] you see a cow
[45:36] or a goat or any four-legged animal when
[45:39] it works
[45:40] where the front hoof is going to where
[45:43] the front right hoof where it's going to
[45:45] start to step to step when it works the
[45:48] back one is also going to step there
[45:51] when it works there's there's a very
[45:54] serious symmetry symmetrical movement
[45:56] wave steps the back the backward the
[45:58] front one the front one I mean the back
[46:00] one is going to step right where the
[46:02] front one is tipped that's you
[46:08] or this way
[46:11] right the Shepherds will know that and
[46:13] it is the shepherd who's going to look
[46:15] at the footprints of that cow and I will
[46:17] tell you how long has it been
[46:20] which cow was was that one that stepped
[46:23] there and look at this ah these are the
[46:25] seat of Abraham they are working like
[46:27] this they are working like Abraham now
[46:30] these are the seeds but what I want us
[46:31] to do tonight is to speak about
[46:34] and this title sorry I went too far
[46:39] okay
[46:41] but the real Pride of the real bride's
[46:44] Faith must be tested too sorry I forgot
[46:47] the E.T there
[46:49] the real
[46:50] but but but the real bride's faith must
[46:54] be tested too
[46:56] it can be only Abraham
[46:58] and it cannot be that we pick and choose
[47:01] what tests should we get from God
[47:04] and it's true we must come to a point of
[47:08] Faith being tested as long as we are the
[47:11] bride
[47:12] Shalom bright so we must come to the
[47:14] test
[47:15] let me show you
[47:17] let's move on I'll show you what I'm
[47:18] talking about let's go to and the next
[47:22] slide there
[47:23] some of the comments that we are going
[47:25] to be reading in the course I've taken
[47:27] them from those sermons and the prophet
[47:29] has taught we can you can go and read
[47:31] them I can share with you this slide if
[47:35] you want or our technicians who can give
[47:36] it to you if you want me to share it for
[47:39] you on Facebook I can't do that for you
[47:42] or Instagram
[47:45] sister now
[47:47] I can share on you via email I can share
[47:51] it for you in any method then you can go
[47:52] and read and and come and share together
[47:55] with us now
[47:57] faith of Abraham must be reflected in in
[48:00] us today
[48:02] the faith of Abraham remember where the
[48:05] friend who has walked the big one must
[48:08] also walk because you are the seat of
[48:10] Abraham and God spoke about you he said
[48:13] in blessing I will bless you and your
[48:16] seed so The Blessing of Abraham tonight
[48:19] are yours
[48:21] the Sirens of Abraham tonight they are
[48:23] yours The Temptations of Abraham are
[48:27] yours everything about Abraham is yours
[48:29] do you want to be like Abraham
[48:32] you also want to lie
[48:34] you already lied
[48:37] but we are also prophetic in our
[48:40] blessing
[48:41] ah you you if you do something wrong and
[48:44] the world wants to accuse you the Lord
[48:46] says Ah no no go to end that one that
[48:48] you say is wrong go ask him to pray for
[48:50] you
[48:54] you're the seat of Abraham right
[48:56] so Abraham came to a point where he had
[48:59] to go to Moriah
[49:01] and to be tried imagine not having
[49:04] children for so long I believe when I
[49:06] read some of the Jewish history that he
[49:08] was a rich man
[49:10] he was a rich man I don't know how truth
[49:13] is it is but some says that Abraham at
[49:15] some point he had a motel you know when
[49:18] you drive from here to to Auckland you
[49:21] pass a place called taupo and other
[49:23] places beautiful places they say along
[49:25] the way Abraham had a motel where he
[49:28] just built a motel for free
[49:30] you come you lost you wash your feet you
[49:33] sleep I don't know I've got no I didn't
[49:36] cross-reference they said
[49:38] but I just like that kind of over here
[49:42] that Abraham had a motel or a place
[49:45] where people would launch as The
[49:47] Travelers in cameras dusty and dirty
[49:49] they just come in large for free you can
[49:53] think of those white towels
[49:55] and they shower in the morning
[49:57] and they maybe stay a week
[50:00] and be fed
[50:02] and they go
[50:04] three
[50:06] that's you
[50:07] if this is true this is what me and you
[50:10] are supposed to do
[50:11] if it's true
[50:14] now our works and and our conduct on a
[50:17] daily basis must be able to show that we
[50:21] are Abraham's seat
[50:23] on a daily basis the pastor made their
[50:26] statement or was it brother and you
[50:28] Isaac I can't remember I said you know
[50:30] sometimes we we want to do things for
[50:32] God
[50:36] 1924.
[50:39] do you understand what I mean or 15
[50:41] hours into in a day
[50:44] not 24 7. part-time
[50:48] and you know what is very strange is
[50:51] that with our lips
[50:53] we don't do that with our lips
[50:56] we are 24 7 7.
[50:59] but our it is our actions
[51:01] it is our fruits that shows that ah
[51:04] these people they're just talking about
[51:06] me am I still Audible
[51:09] so we need to be able on a daily basis
[51:13] to show that we are I said too much to
[51:17] my wife or someone I said ah someone
[51:19] dreamed a dream and I said ah oh yeah it
[51:22] was little
[51:23] I said ah
[51:25] that dream no no no no no no no no no
[51:28] because I was having a problem with the
[51:30] dream sorry my girlfriend I was having a
[51:33] problem with the dream I said ah you
[51:34] can't you can't because he was dreaming
[51:36] boxing people and and sorting them out
[51:40] I said ah that dream
[51:43] shooting them
[51:44] I said ah no no we must set your
[51:48] subconscious because what what because
[51:50] you see
[51:51] the Bible says at some point the Bible
[51:53] says somewhere that
[51:56] might I'm just rephrasing it the
[51:59] multiplication of Dreams is brought by
[52:02] who knows that scripture that too many
[52:04] dreams sometimes are brought in by too
[52:06] much worry
[52:08] nothing against dreams dream is a
[52:10] dreaming is a gift
[52:12] but we just need to be able to to make
[52:15] sure that our subconscious in our spirit
[52:18] is directed from the soul from the Holy
[52:21] Spirit then you get a perfect dream that
[52:23] is very prophetic that is a blessing you
[52:26] know not that I just did not
[52:28] I killed him and I get happy
[52:32] I I I know you're sleeping but I don't
[52:34] agree
[52:37] that's not my topic anyway
[52:39] um
[52:40] now
[52:42] you are the Bride of God right today
[52:45] we're gonna take it easy I'm gonna sit
[52:47] back and you can sit back
[52:49] right can I sit back and you also relax
[52:51] that no no
[52:53] of the Bride today I wanted to title
[52:56] this message the ex of the Bride because
[52:58] we've got the acts of the Prophet
[52:59] there's a book but the Peregrine wrote
[53:01] it huh we've got the Acts of the
[53:03] Apostles in the Bible we've got the acts
[53:06] if we were to go into live another
[53:08] hundred years
[53:09] what what what kind of act we're going
[53:12] to be written about us
[53:15] are we having Acts
[53:17] what kind of Acts what were they going
[53:19] to say about sister pulling
[53:22] what were they going to say what were
[53:24] they going to say about David
[53:26] of the leaves in in in in Willington New
[53:30] Zealand
[53:31] that was a young man
[53:34] then what what did wow
[53:36] ah what happened a boy called Liam of
[53:40] the strawberries with the origins from
[53:42] South Africa
[53:44] what what the son of Armand of of of
[53:47] guavas of strawberries that's how we are
[53:49] going to write write about you the act
[53:52] of an a young man believer called Liam
[53:57] what
[53:58] we hear about the Acts of the Apostles
[54:00] we hear about that the acts of brother
[54:02] branium
[54:04] how are our ex today
[54:07] okay I know we've got good acts we serve
[54:10] the Lord in everything but the majority
[54:12] of those eggs
[54:14] our lives on a daily basis is was it
[54:16] gonna just be a church way and just to
[54:19] be religious
[54:20] okay
[54:25] I just want to I'm not I'm not yet used
[54:28] to this thing
[54:30] um
[54:31] in the message works is Faith expressed
[54:33] we know that works don't save us our
[54:36] works will never ever save us but our
[54:38] works demonstrate The Faith from inside
[54:41] ah in fact our faith brings works
[54:46] it is those works that shows us what
[54:49] level of faith
[54:51] or what kind of faith or what category
[54:55] or what type of faith is it a saturated
[54:58] one is it a hot hot one or is a mild one
[55:01] ah or is it a very very very hard
[55:05] those who knows Nando's will identify
[55:08] with this
[55:10] what what faith is it you know when you
[55:13] eat that hot spice you don't become the
[55:15] same when you eat the chilies that hot
[55:17] one what is it that one in South Africa
[55:20] brother we have we have paprika
[55:24] that hot hot chilies oh my mom plants
[55:28] them it's called is it sarona
[55:32] oh goes chili from Brother here for
[55:34] brother and that one but then they make
[55:36] some concoction what
[55:37] and you eat it you feel something is
[55:39] coming from
[55:47] you take it you react
[55:48] there is a reaction
[55:51] when the word of God comes into your
[55:53] heart is there a reaction what kind of a
[55:56] reaction is it
[55:59] yes there's an action but what kind
[56:02] is it the reaction that brings you
[56:03] closer to God
[56:05] because that's where we start we say
[56:07] faith is worth expressed right but the
[56:12] issue my brother and sister is not even
[56:14] much there yet that is where we are
[56:16] supposed to be already the issue is that
[56:19] our faith must come to a level where it
[56:21] gets tested
[56:24] like our Father Abraham
[56:28] the child
[56:29] the leg and I
[56:32] will return
[56:34] he know that something had to happen he
[56:37] knew
[56:38] and he didn't know just how God was
[56:40] going to do it oh yeah also it looks
[56:42] like he didn't know how God was going to
[56:44] do but I think Abraham knew that God
[56:46] told him to slaughter the child
[56:49] he know he knew and isn't his question
[56:52] he knows that God promised it right how
[56:55] that was not an issue let's read Hebrews
[56:59] 11. but without faith it is impossible
[57:03] to please him we know the scripture
[57:06] do we read it
[57:08] we do it
[57:10] for he that cometh to God must believe
[57:13] that he is he is and that he's a
[57:15] rewarder God don't just ask you to
[57:17] believe and not reward you
[57:19] he rewards you
[57:21] because it is in through the works of
[57:23] that faith that you get tested right and
[57:25] a faith that is not tested it's not the
[57:27] faith of Abraham
[57:29] I don't believe so brother Ben Abraham's
[57:32] Faith must be tested if people here on
[57:34] Earth can do products and do things and
[57:37] test them if the Devil Himself tries and
[57:40] tests his his Legions that they are
[57:43] faithfully and he promotes them
[57:46] how much more about God he actually
[57:48] copied from God God tested his own faith
[57:52] he said let there be he never said once
[57:56] I mean he never said twice
[57:58] he said let there be light
[58:00] and he waited and there was light
[58:02] so that was Faith expressed and it was
[58:05] expressed in the ways let there be in my
[58:08] life let it Let There Be and something
[58:10] will come let's just believe it you see
[58:13] Faith but the prophet says he says faith
[58:15] is very simple
[58:17] but the devil wants to complicate it
[58:20] faith is just
[58:22] it's very
[58:25] simple
[58:27] but you can miss it
[58:31] right
[58:34] if I say to Reuben
[58:37] you know Reuben
[58:42] this verse this first love Lord verse
[58:44] what do we say here in
[58:46] New Zealand huh
[58:48] is cloth eh
[58:50] planol
[58:52] washcloth the other side wash clothes
[58:56] back home we call it vast lab isn't it
[58:58] Brotherman by masalapi vaslap
[59:02] if I say to even
[59:04] you believe this verse love
[59:07] I can throw it it can stand here on air
[59:10] how many believe that
[59:13] okay
[59:15] you don't believe
[59:17] if I say to Ruben Ruben this first love
[59:20] can stand can I can I throw it and it
[59:22] can stand do you understand me Reuben do
[59:25] you believe me if Reuben does not
[59:27] believe what I'm telling is not gonna
[59:29] stand
[59:30] but if I know that this thing is going
[59:32] to stand here and I'm telling him right
[59:34] no matter how hard right but God because
[59:38] he was himself alone and he knew and
[59:40] believed he didn't have to to second
[59:42] guess himself he just said let there be
[59:44] like I thought you wanted me to show you
[59:46] if the verslap cannot stand but you
[59:48] don't believe it
[59:51] so if Reuben believes
[59:53] that if I throw this in front of you
[59:55] it's just gonna land here and stop
[59:58] not Taking Chances bringing glory and
[1:00:02] honor for God it will stand
[1:00:04] how many believes it
[1:00:08] I can sense a bit of doubt
[1:00:12] of course it shouldn't be to to to bring
[1:00:15] you know attraction and self self
[1:00:18] attention and you know it must be to
[1:00:20] bring glory and honor it must be to
[1:00:22] boost your faith it must be you know for
[1:00:24] something as the purpose of God it will
[1:00:27] stand
[1:00:29] I believe it to stand
[1:00:31] okay
[1:00:32] let's talk about it next time
[1:00:35] but now without that Faith anyway
[1:00:37] without faith it is impossible to please
[1:00:40] him that means Faith No discussion for a
[1:00:43] bride you have it and you are accepting
[1:00:45] it or you don't accept it you have it
[1:00:47] tonight you have the faith of God
[1:00:49] because he said hey sometimes we have
[1:00:51] the faith and we don't even know that we
[1:00:52] have it
[1:00:55] sometimes we have the faith for the
[1:00:58] things that are given to us you see how
[1:01:00] cruel and a a robber the devil is he
[1:01:03] realized that there's nothing he can do
[1:01:05] to you and he just he's just he's a
[1:01:08] toothless dog he there's nothing he can
[1:01:10] do he's got no one else no more teeth
[1:01:13] he's he's so he he just he does cover
[1:01:15] your blessings like this right
[1:01:17] everything is yours given and then you
[1:01:20] fall for that you you want to to fall
[1:01:23] for it
[1:01:28] may God help us
[1:01:30] even so
[1:01:32] if it hath not works faith
[1:01:35] is dead
[1:01:38] let's not put it the other way around
[1:01:40] it's not work that saves you it's the
[1:01:42] faith that saves right
[1:01:45] let's let's hear further here about the
[1:01:47] patriarch Abraham a little bit more how
[1:01:50] tested he was God promised it he's going
[1:01:52] to be he's going how is it going to be I
[1:01:55] can't tell you but God said so I will
[1:01:57] send Jesus Christ the second time he
[1:02:00] will come in a physical form
[1:02:02] I'll ask my family when we had a prayer
[1:02:05] meeting the other day I said huh
[1:02:08] as we are sitting around the table
[1:02:10] praying
[1:02:11] what will your reaction be if somehow in
[1:02:15] the middle of the prayer you open your
[1:02:17] eyes maybe the corner of your eye and
[1:02:19] you just see a man standing
[1:02:22] also worshiping
[1:02:25] maybe not a man with white comments and
[1:02:28] everything that's an ordinary man but a
[1:02:30] holy man tending
[1:02:32] I said I said to my family what will you
[1:02:34] what will you do
[1:02:37] if right now where you're sitting you
[1:02:38] can see a being sitting next to you
[1:02:41] with your physical eyes What will What
[1:02:44] what will you do you start to cry and
[1:02:46] and be genuine and serious
[1:02:50] it is now that's that time when because
[1:02:52] those beings are there
[1:02:54] the prophet says your father is just
[1:02:55] here
[1:02:56] and you can feel him you my job and your
[1:02:59] job is to pull and talk on him because
[1:03:02] he's trying to talk come closer to you
[1:03:04] let's focus on him tagging and being
[1:03:07] closer to us then it shall come to pass
[1:03:10] that you will see
[1:03:12] a sister prayed so hard that God can
[1:03:15] show some things
[1:03:17] you know heavenly
[1:03:20] and the Lord showed it
[1:03:22] but because this flesh is such a a Hong
[1:03:25] Kong
[1:03:27] you know I said Hong Kong
[1:03:33] and from Kong is something that's not
[1:03:35] original
[1:03:37] this flesh is a Hong Kong
[1:03:39] it is such is such a fake
[1:03:42] it will just start to get nervous and
[1:03:45] just want to die because the presence of
[1:03:47] God is there but there's someone inside
[1:03:50] you who will take over this flesh and
[1:03:53] that flesh will know and just Worship
[1:03:55] the Lord yeah
[1:03:57] so what I'm trying to say brothers and
[1:03:59] sisters is that our faith is so real and
[1:04:01] the things in the spiritual realm are so
[1:04:03] real that we shouldn't underestimate
[1:04:05] them they are so genuine and so life
[1:04:08] right
[1:04:09] so life and then uh now that was Abraham
[1:04:14] and a God promised him it didn't matter
[1:04:16] to Abraham how long is going to take how
[1:04:19] God is going to do it he didn't want to
[1:04:21] operationalize God's faith he said God
[1:04:24] what you are telling me is that actually
[1:04:26] you doing it in me I don't care whether
[1:04:29] my son dies whether he rise or what
[1:04:32] happens but you knew I wanted a son so
[1:04:34] he knew all that Abraham so that was
[1:04:36] what he promised and we are looking for
[1:04:39] that hour to approach huh
[1:04:42] us we are looking for that hour to
[1:04:44] approach to take our Isaac to Moriah
[1:04:48] in principle are we ready
[1:04:50] because the time is about to happen the
[1:04:53] time is around the corner the prophets
[1:04:55] in 64 already he said it won't be long
[1:04:59] it won't be long it is 64 before I was
[1:05:01] born
[1:05:02] very few of us here were born in 64.
[1:05:06] very few were born in 64.
[1:05:08] maybe before open before maybe it's just
[1:05:12] oppa and Omar and Omar I can count
[1:05:15] I can count Without You sisters telling
[1:05:17] me your age I can count
[1:05:19] now the prophet said it won't be long at
[1:05:22] that time already it won't be long
[1:05:25] so how far are we now
[1:05:28] how far are we
[1:05:33] time-tested faith
[1:05:35] it is not every challenge or difficulty
[1:05:38] and or bad times in your life that talks
[1:05:41] about time-tested faith
[1:05:44] just because the just because there's a
[1:05:46] trial there's many people who go through
[1:05:47] trials there's many people who go
[1:05:49] through situations but does not mean
[1:05:51] that those are Faith tested Faith trials
[1:05:56] it could just be the devil is just just
[1:05:57] it's just on you or whatever whoever but
[1:06:00] if you are a daughter and a son of God
[1:06:02] everything
[1:06:04] must come via your faith everything
[1:06:06] about God everything must bring glory to
[1:06:09] God your tests your tires you must look
[1:06:12] at them with the eye of faith so that
[1:06:15] they can bring glory and honor to God
[1:06:18] about our lives huh do you believe me
[1:06:22] every situation in a Believer it's life
[1:06:25] must reflect if it's a child if it's
[1:06:29] happiness if it's whatever
[1:06:31] including you see that means that
[1:06:34] whatever we do we must be careful
[1:06:37] however we live we must be careful
[1:06:40] whatever however we think we must be
[1:06:43] careful
[1:06:46] I said to you I'm so nervous do you
[1:06:48] think I'm nervous of you
[1:06:50] I'm not nervous of any of you you are my
[1:06:53] brothers and my sisters I'm not scared
[1:06:54] of you I can tell you outside and say I
[1:06:57] know Brother David I'm not scared of you
[1:06:58] and truly I'm not scared of you you are
[1:07:00] not scared of me right so it's not about
[1:07:02] a human being it's about being in the
[1:07:04] presence of the Lord so now whatever we
[1:07:07] do because we are in the presence of God
[1:07:10] we are
[1:07:12] uh what's the word we are question ties
[1:07:15] we are made our way we are alert we are
[1:07:18] sensitive to the spirit of God
[1:07:21] not about the church this church
[1:07:25] are we together
[1:07:27] so it's not every trial for anyone
[1:07:29] whenever it happens the devil can cause
[1:07:32] Havoc he can cause whatever he does but
[1:07:34] when he comes to you he says everything
[1:07:37] must bring glory to God everything must
[1:07:40] bring somehow the fact that I don't know
[1:07:43] how it relates to my situation that's
[1:07:46] not me because you are a bride you are a
[1:07:49] bride and you are a bride of God you are
[1:07:52] a wife of God
[1:07:55] you know the meaning that they say the
[1:07:58] best thing that a man can have
[1:08:00] brother Ben
[1:08:02] Bailey
[1:08:04] the best thing that a man can have I was
[1:08:07] reading a message choosing the bride and
[1:08:09] while I'm reading it by the end he said
[1:08:10] that sleep of brother of American
[1:08:14] brother what's his name
[1:08:16] yeah preaching talking about choosing
[1:08:19] and I was reading I was busy reading I
[1:08:22] wanted to come and talk about choosing a
[1:08:24] bride and I said ah no no no no no let
[1:08:26] me leave that for brother
[1:08:28] our it I was so much intrigued and I was
[1:08:32] going to have to talk about brother Ben
[1:08:34] and all the young people here you see
[1:08:36] but I didn't want to put them on the
[1:08:38] spot but it was it would have been more
[1:08:40] about Christ and the bright you and the
[1:08:43] bright I mean you and the Lord sorry hit
[1:08:46] the bride and the Lord so so so so so
[1:08:48] everything
[1:08:51] I forgot my point that I wanted to say
[1:08:53] it but it must bring Glory it must bring
[1:08:55] honor it must bring praise
[1:08:57] to God if not it's yours put it aside
[1:09:01] if it cannot bring something about the
[1:09:03] Lord
[1:09:04] if it can bring Praises about you
[1:09:09] one side
[1:09:10] forget about it it's just going to be a
[1:09:12] distraction for you
[1:09:14] it's just going to be a head for you
[1:09:16] it's just going to be a derailleur for
[1:09:18] you it's just going to be something that
[1:09:20] brings you closer to the devil than God
[1:09:22] if it's about me
[1:09:31] this makes the Fulfillment and
[1:09:33] manifestation if it's about me if it's
[1:09:36] not about God if everything that I want
[1:09:38] to do or most things are not about God
[1:09:40] huh then that just delays my growth you
[1:09:45] know this makes the Fulfillment and
[1:09:46] manifestation a true Faith difficult
[1:09:50] it makes Faith difficult to prosper and
[1:09:52] to win that man that that man the
[1:09:55] prophet says she said
[1:09:57] hair and muscles and it's such a big
[1:10:00] thing faith it makes it very difficult I
[1:10:03] make it difficult for him
[1:10:05] if I do not focus on the Lord with my my
[1:10:10] actions daily
[1:10:11] and I allow the devil
[1:10:13] a week week
[1:10:16] no myself nothing
[1:10:20] I make him to appear like he's stronger
[1:10:22] than that man that called faith that the
[1:10:24] prophet talks about
[1:10:27] the Loose Ends we spoke about this Loose
[1:10:29] Ends last time you know and the prophet
[1:10:31] says notice there she is who the bride
[1:10:34] right now she's lost you are losed from
[1:10:39] everything of the world you are loose
[1:10:40] from Evil thoughts from whatever that is
[1:10:43] why
[1:10:45] he the Bible says
[1:10:46] um
[1:10:47] not what does he say he says
[1:10:52] I want to paraphrase I forgot the
[1:10:54] scripture move away from all evil and
[1:10:57] all the things of the world and the
[1:10:58] appearance of the world of the things of
[1:11:00] the world he who loves me and who he who
[1:11:03] love the world the Bible says the love
[1:11:05] of God is not in that person if you love
[1:11:08] the world and the things of the world if
[1:11:10] you love the world and the appearance of
[1:11:11] the world
[1:11:13] what is the appearance of the world
[1:11:14] today I mean we've spoken a lot about
[1:11:16] the appearances of the world we have
[1:11:18] spoken a lot about things of the world
[1:11:19] but if you love them
[1:11:22] then the love of God
[1:11:25] sorry
[1:11:27] if you love the things of the we just
[1:11:29] have to be honest with each other if I
[1:11:31] love the world me brother and Paul if
[1:11:33] I've got some elements of life in the
[1:11:35] world then the love of God is not in me
[1:11:38] and I mustn't shy away and make it as if
[1:11:40] he's in me I must go bow down to God and
[1:11:43] say Lord remove
[1:11:47] the things of the the incest this Zeal
[1:11:50] of one or when I want to talk to do
[1:11:52] things of God I become
[1:11:54] not so active I become
[1:11:56] uh what's the word
[1:11:59] um
[1:12:00] and occupied I become not interested but
[1:12:03] when you want to do the things oh the
[1:12:05] things over there you jump you're the
[1:12:07] first one the things of the world
[1:12:09] activates you anything why
[1:12:12] why is it like that this is the Magi
[1:12:16] why when I think about the things of the
[1:12:18] world as and as ah I'm coming or I mean
[1:12:26] the young one but the point here is
[1:12:30] I must be very zealous and a very
[1:12:34] passionate very zealous when it comes to
[1:12:36] the things of the world that is an
[1:12:38] indication that there's something in
[1:12:40] there that is an expression of your
[1:12:43] faith in God
[1:12:46] think about it my brother my sister just
[1:12:47] be alone
[1:12:49] just be alone each one just switch off
[1:12:51] just think about you are in an airplane
[1:12:53] in your own booth alone think about it
[1:12:57] why why when I think about doing God's
[1:13:00] things spiritual things don't tell me
[1:13:02] about school and then business and then
[1:13:04] work no no no let's wait we'll come to
[1:13:06] those God knows about those ones what
[1:13:08] God is interested is a spiritual things
[1:13:10] that are giving you eternal life things
[1:13:13] that you are imparting eternal life to
[1:13:14] others
[1:13:16] I currently playing every day saying no
[1:13:18] no no no pray for me that I can get a
[1:13:20] promotion every day I'm asking you yes
[1:13:22] of course I must ask I must pray for the
[1:13:25] Lord to prosper my business when I pray
[1:13:27] for Isaac's movies to move on in the
[1:13:29] Lord to prosper and bless him but the
[1:13:31] real focus of what we want the the front
[1:13:34] one must not be these physical things
[1:13:37] the priority every day must be Lord me
[1:13:41] bring me closer Lord I'm prepared to put
[1:13:44] everything aside are you prepared
[1:13:47] I must be prepared
[1:13:49] that must be the priority right now I

[1:15:16] threads that are hanging everywhere even
[1:15:19] if she can do this they won't go away
[1:15:21] she must take a scissor
[1:15:23] and it must be a sharp Caesar and it cut
[1:15:26] them and as much she she's very careful
[1:15:29] she's very careful because she spend
[1:15:31] hours designing the dress sewing cutting
[1:15:34] and sewing it with a pattern she spends
[1:15:36] sleepless nights the Lord spent a lot on
[1:15:41] you
[1:15:42] now the Lord this is moving Loose Ends
[1:15:45] he cast them sometimes we were the first
[1:15:49] the Lord can allow us to shake us
[1:15:52] have you ever done a a clothing like
[1:15:56] this on the line before you hang them if
[1:15:58] you're standing next to the person doing
[1:16:00] that and that water splash on you is so
[1:16:01] painful
[1:16:03] or you just go to the drawing nowadays
[1:16:06] ah come on

[1:16:15] and train them prepare them to be
[1:16:18] mothers no no not not Pakistan

[1:16:30] good Mothers and a good wives we must
[1:16:33] prepare them
[1:16:34] and that means fathers must prepare Sons
[1:16:39] and you cannot prepare someone if you
[1:16:41] are not prepared we must prepare Sons
[1:16:44] and Daughters to become good Godly wives
[1:16:49] notice them about how to look for a boy
[1:16:54] train them in the way of the Lord in the
[1:16:57] scriptural way I'm out of my topic now
[1:16:59] but that's what we need to do mothers
[1:17:02] I I I can't wait for the day where
[1:17:05] elderly sisters will have a meeting just
[1:17:07] to talk about the young people saying
[1:17:09] them
[1:17:10] talk about God talk about situations
[1:17:13] how do you come on disease because some
[1:17:16] things we may not say them on the pulpit
[1:17:17] yes
[1:17:18] some things we might not say them here
[1:17:21] but Hannah needs to know them
[1:17:24] Anna needs to know that ah when happy
[1:17:27] comes from work I give me a cup of tea
[1:17:29] she needs to understand that
[1:17:34] [Applause]
[1:17:36] sorry because Hannah did this to me so
[1:17:39] I'm sorry I'm not trying to it's because
[1:17:40] she she said
[1:17:43] I said I was responding to him
[1:17:45] the fact of the matter is that
[1:17:49] we must produce products
[1:17:52] for God
[1:17:54] the world is looking at us
[1:17:56] they are benefiting from our lives
[1:17:59] our children must come out of that oven
[1:18:03] hot
[1:18:05] have you ever have you ever felt a paper
[1:18:07] coming out of a photocopier
[1:18:09] machine
[1:18:11] or bread coming out of an oven is hot
[1:18:14] and is is thick
[1:18:18] it's not just flat it's throwing ice
[1:18:20] from the oven fully baked
[1:18:22] fluffy soft
[1:18:25] ready to be eaten right
[1:18:28] this loose ends are not wanted
[1:18:30] we don't want Loose Ends that means a
[1:18:34] we are not looking for Loose Ends there
[1:18:36] in the world we are looking for loose
[1:18:38] ends here on this dress that is about to
[1:18:40] be worn
[1:18:41] that is about to be put on we are
[1:18:43] looking for Loose Ends where
[1:18:46] if we are in denial and say there's no
[1:18:47] Loose Ends we deceive ourselves if we so
[1:18:50] James says if I say I'm not a sinner I'm
[1:18:52] lying to myself well expose the Loose
[1:18:55] Ends Lord in my life
[1:18:58] I want to see them Lord so that you can
[1:19:01] cut them
[1:19:02] I always say even when you pray and you
[1:19:05] don't know what to pray for ask God to
[1:19:07] give you something to pray for
[1:19:09] ask for the need of the need of the need
[1:19:13] don't let the devil seek you and say you
[1:19:15] can't ask for that he said if you ask
[1:19:17] anything in my name I will give it to
[1:19:20] you anything
[1:19:22] what does anything mean
[1:19:25] it means if I've got a problem
[1:19:29] that is blocking this Pro this problem
[1:19:31] to be solved and then this one is
[1:19:34] blocking I must pay for the whole chain
[1:19:36] to be crushed
[1:19:38] have you ever played that game of block
[1:19:40] blocker is it blockers well just break
[1:19:42] things
[1:19:43] the Lord must
[1:19:46] break everything
[1:19:47] but I'm just
[1:19:50] break everything remove it the thing of
[1:19:54] the thing of the thing of the same that
[1:19:56] is causing a problem
[1:19:57] the Lord
[1:19:59] must show it to you amen that's what the
[1:20:02] Lord must do in my life in your life
[1:20:05] now this church amen let me not talk
[1:20:07] about idiot so you see those are some of
[1:20:10] the things that
[1:20:12] come in our lives
[1:20:15] um
[1:20:17] sorry let me go here
[1:20:19] these are some of the some of the Loose
[1:20:21] Ends things that come in our lives
[1:20:23] eventually if we are not able to expose
[1:20:26] them and cut them because we are born
[1:20:29] with them this flesh not us this flesh
[1:20:32] is born with those things and the devil
[1:20:35] capitalizes on that weakness of being
[1:20:37] born in sin and all those things come
[1:20:40] ah so we need a spiritual eye of
[1:20:43] understanding for us to be able you know
[1:20:45] not to have all these things and and be
[1:20:48] able to say
[1:20:50] this side no
[1:20:52] complexes you know what is a complex
[1:20:56] the pastor spoke about the complexes but
[1:20:59] I just thought I can expand a little bit
[1:21:00] with a personal example do you allow me
[1:21:04] yes ichino
[1:21:07] you see
[1:21:08] a complex is a very gender dangerous
[1:21:11] thing it's a strong loose end it needs a
[1:21:13] big Caesar
[1:21:15] and sometimes you have a complex and
[1:21:16] you're not even aware that you have a
[1:21:19] complex
[1:21:20] a complex is something like
[1:21:23] you see where I grew up I grew up in a
[1:21:26] country of segregation in my country we
[1:21:29] call it apartheid
[1:21:30] upper side means to separate to live
[1:21:32] apart I grew up in a country like that
[1:21:35] where blacks there actually I was
[1:21:38] telling my kids there's nothing like
[1:21:39] blacks or or white we are just ethnic
[1:21:42] ethnic groups I'm not politicizing eh
[1:21:45] there's no white in my view and and look
[1:21:48] I'm not changing your views
[1:21:50] I'm just trying to make a point I grew
[1:21:53] up in a country like that my dad at some
[1:21:55] point he was I wish this could be
[1:21:56] switched off I'm you know my dad at some
[1:21:58] point he just stopped in them driving
[1:22:00] and he found an accident and a family of
[1:22:03] the white people or Africans or white
[1:22:05] people
[1:22:06] was involved in a car accident and the
[1:22:08] police just stopped them they just
[1:22:10] stopped every taxi every every every
[1:22:12] every car that I had black people they
[1:22:13] just stopped them and they start to beat
[1:22:15] them just beat them
[1:22:17] for what no
[1:22:19] that's the I'm trying to show you a
[1:22:21] complex eh you must listen carefully
[1:22:23] so you you grow up like that you grow up
[1:22:26] looking at the white brother and like
[1:22:28] anything like this you just just by
[1:22:30] looking at him you hate him
[1:22:32] you grow up like that you grow up
[1:22:34] knowing this is my enemy it only takes
[1:22:36] God now you grow up the devil capitalize
[1:22:39] on that because he created all these
[1:22:41] things and you grow up like that until
[1:22:44] God takes over and change that and it
[1:22:47] can be a stronghold day even Believers
[1:22:50] you can find a pastor saying I love the
[1:22:52] Lord praise the Lord but still hating
[1:22:54] your head brother
[1:22:56] or still hating an African brother
[1:22:58] and that's the spirit our sharing with
[1:23:01] Andy last time that the spirits that the
[1:23:03] devil plants in all the the countries of
[1:23:06] the world eh he he categorizes them in
[1:23:09] this country this spirit this country so
[1:23:11] in my country it was that spirit and you
[1:23:13] are blessed to to have the Revelation to
[1:23:15] find that oh this is the Devil he's not
[1:23:18] part of me God bring a big sister for
[1:23:20] this one Lord and God cuts it you see
[1:23:23] now a complex comes like this
[1:23:26] and then you you you sit there and then
[1:23:29] you you say the Lord anoint you with the
[1:23:31] spirit and then you say the Nature has
[1:23:33] changed and but you are brother and poor
[1:23:35] but now if every any white person who
[1:23:38] can do something like brother Alma like
[1:23:40] this the moment he does something wrong
[1:23:42] or something that I perceive to be wrong
[1:23:43] then that that that thing comes closer
[1:23:47] that's what happens it comes closer why
[1:23:49] because it hasn't died so if you have
[1:23:52] not defeated that complex if God the
[1:23:53] Lord has not cut it be careful
[1:23:56] are you a bride
[1:23:58] are you a believer
[1:24:00] so we might be very careful same here in
[1:24:04] New Zealand same
[1:24:06] back in 1972 the way Isaac showed me a
[1:24:08] newspaper when he lived in India he
[1:24:10] showed me a newspaper where in New
[1:24:12] Zealand people who were protesting that
[1:24:14] they don't know in the Box the Box will
[1:24:16] come here and and then the people who
[1:24:18] were against that kind of a thing that
[1:24:19] no they must come they support what is
[1:24:22] happening there because there was also
[1:24:23] segregation in one way or the other so
[1:24:26] when you look at a person like that and
[1:24:28] you allow a spirit like that kind of a
[1:24:31] complex you don't even want to talk
[1:24:33] about it we must cross these things
[1:24:35] because they are not for us
[1:24:37] they are not for us and then and then
[1:24:39] when I look at Armand I'm even proud
[1:24:42] proud to say who are you more than my
[1:24:43] brother
[1:24:44] and we can sleep on the same bed he
[1:24:46] looked there I look there or we look
[1:24:48] together he's not on me
[1:24:51] because and from the bottom of your
[1:24:54] heart
[1:24:55] right it's not something that you make
[1:24:57] up
[1:24:58] the time of pleasing one another is over
[1:25:01] the time of time to be nice to one
[1:25:04] another are over
[1:25:07] brother why are you treating this boy
[1:25:09] different from this one
[1:25:11] like the things they do in their schools
[1:25:15] so you shall say Lord you know when when
[1:25:18] you do something stupid when I grew up
[1:25:20] we just said
[1:25:23] we said the Lord must have said ah shame
[1:25:26] forgive them Master Lord forgive them
[1:25:29] even Stephen said forgive them
[1:25:32] so we are so high in our faith that our
[1:25:35] works show that we are Beyond
[1:25:38] segregation Spirits we are Beyond family
[1:25:40] Spirits we live beyond no matter what
[1:25:43] happens Brother Andy no matter so those
[1:25:47] kind of spirits we must know that they
[1:25:48] are dead in our lives they are dead
[1:25:51] and we don't means our weights now if
[1:25:54] you allow them in your life let me tell
[1:25:57] you what you're doing
[1:25:58] you're bringing everybody here you're
[1:26:00] pulling everybody back
[1:26:02] it's like someone who's sick at the
[1:26:04] corner the deacons anointing with oil
[1:26:06] and or a family that needs comfort and
[1:26:09] they use your attitude still like that
[1:26:12] me it has here that's why it must start
[1:26:14] with me with me
[1:26:17] the way I think the way I look at you
[1:26:19] the way I reacted the way I behave alone
[1:26:22] before I come to you to greet you alone
[1:26:25] with God
[1:26:27] ah it's nice to be a believer because we
[1:26:30] can tell each other everything
[1:26:32] so that that will pull everyone back
[1:26:35] you're making this church suffocate
[1:26:38] my attitude can cause a problem to a
[1:26:42] healing of someone not even a physical
[1:26:45] healing much
[1:26:46] spiritually hidden
[1:26:48] just because of my attitude
[1:26:51] because I allow that old nature
[1:26:54] always said you know we leave our
[1:26:56] country and we come here and we change
[1:26:58] it you know it's very very true and I
[1:27:00] agree with my brother but you know you
[1:27:02] know what happens to Spirits excuse me
[1:27:03] Spirits can spirits don't die
[1:27:06] and I don't know how they cross the Seas
[1:27:09] we fly
[1:27:10] you know they can follow you
[1:27:13] overseas everywhere
[1:27:15] they can follow you if you go now to my
[1:27:18] country you'll find these guys who drive
[1:27:19] taxis
[1:27:21] do you saw the man they have pulled in
[1:27:23] front of you they're all people sorry
[1:27:25] sorry
[1:27:26] not even sorry there's nothing wrong so
[1:27:30] someone said to me if you go to Nigeria
[1:27:33] if you got most of the countries
[1:27:35] developing candy if you go to New York
[1:27:36] Las Vegas
[1:27:38] and one day takes Same Spirit
[1:27:42] I'm telling you because the devil
[1:27:44] categorizes people he says are these
[1:27:47] these races
[1:27:51] or there's countries there's countries
[1:27:53] you know until Americans when they come
[1:27:56] when an American comes here if he is not
[1:27:57] repented you can see this an American
[1:28:00] is perfect
[1:28:03] ah yeah you can see that ah this is
[1:28:07] suffering from the spirit of being
[1:28:09] pompous you're like huh
[1:28:12] you know Americans the nose is up
[1:28:14] there's the spirit on the country
[1:28:17] so the devil puts those Spirits in
[1:28:19] different countries and then he put them
[1:28:21] in different people oh there's women and
[1:28:23] there's men
[1:28:25] until my daughter tells me Papa who told
[1:28:27] you I can't play that game because I'm a
[1:28:29] girl I said no forgive me
[1:28:32] I just I just apologize
[1:28:34] the Bible says there's no more Greek
[1:28:36] there's no more what
[1:28:39] there's none of those things the context
[1:28:41] of the scripture was that don't group
[1:28:43] people of God say no no you know you're
[1:28:46] a girl you can't do that girls and boys
[1:28:49] huh they must play together they must
[1:28:52] they must we must mixed
[1:28:55] it was in front of God we are just his
[1:28:58] children we are a bouquet
[1:29:00] flowers
[1:29:02] I just wanted to heed that thing that
[1:29:05] you know you know Abraham Lincoln said
[1:29:07] you know even if he takes my life I want
[1:29:09] to eat that thing
[1:29:12] it and that man didn't even know the
[1:29:14] prophet maybe but he wanted to hear the
[1:29:17] spirit
[1:29:18] that it must not even cross the minds of
[1:29:20] people
[1:29:21] that you look at your brother and you
[1:29:23] think ah
[1:29:25] white men wait what
[1:29:27] he said brother
[1:29:29] it's not Asian it's not what it's a
[1:29:32] brother it's not kiwi it's not South
[1:29:34] African I'm just me and David
[1:29:38] I look him as my son he looked at me as
[1:29:40] his death secondary day
[1:29:45] I said to Malachi Malachi I've got a
[1:29:48] deal for you my friend he was visiting
[1:29:49] my house I said ah man I feel like I
[1:29:52] feel like you know I feel like I want to
[1:29:54] be your uncle
[1:29:56] he said ah I said yes
[1:29:58] I said but the deal is that a you can
[1:30:01] come here every month
[1:30:03] yeah every month you can I'll make up a
[1:30:05] 10 for you and the boys and then in
[1:30:07] exchange of you calling me Uncle from
[1:30:09] now on you listen to me doesn't call me
[1:30:10] brother
[1:30:13] and I feel good hey Malachi
[1:30:17] so
[1:30:18] the way we look at one another it must
[1:30:21] that must be broken
[1:30:22] otherwise your faith is going to be
[1:30:26] weakened
[1:30:29] your faith when it comes time to
[1:30:31] challenges you won't pass those
[1:30:33] challenges because there's upstairs
[1:30:35] Loose Ends this dress must be worn this
[1:30:39] trouser this suit is ready to be worn
[1:30:42] sister Tessa this two-piece is ready but
[1:30:45] there's some loose ends sister the
[1:30:48] sister of the Lord must cut
[1:30:50] those things so that my faith can stand
[1:30:52] the test of times out there when I walk
[1:30:54] have you ever walked with one that the
[1:30:57] the pants is like this something is that
[1:31:00] the disease is or the jacket you know
[1:31:04] where we teach this like this and then
[1:31:05] you talk confidently people say
[1:31:08] ouch
[1:31:10] it's embarrassing so the Lord wants to
[1:31:13] seem all those things so that we can be
[1:31:15] a perfect well adore well done bright
[1:31:20] perfect one Sister Christine isn't it
[1:31:22] that's what the Lord wants to do brother
[1:31:24] Ben and he's doing that for us and we
[1:31:26] allow him to cut those things not not
[1:31:29] blog him not say no no no no no no we
[1:31:31] allow him to remove them the Loose Ends
[1:31:33] notice there she is loose you are free
[1:31:38] it's not even an issue anymore for you
[1:31:40] just give it to the Lord to remove that
[1:31:43] thing
[1:31:43] today if you still root and he'll remove
[1:31:46] it to the root you know when they remove
[1:31:48] a what a what do you know a what
[1:31:51] a what when they remove it
[1:31:56] they go to the root they chase it in
[1:31:59] order to Chase
[1:32:01] is to burn it
[1:32:03] [Laughter]
[1:32:06] was in Zulu
[1:32:08] to banish to chaser
[1:32:10] so let her change it then says which is
[1:32:14] it
[1:32:15] so it must be chest chiseled
[1:32:18] I don't know a better way so everything
[1:32:21] that is not of the Lord in our lives
[1:32:23] and we mustn't shy away to say Lord
[1:32:26] chisel me
[1:32:28] until the image of Christ comes and
[1:32:31] chisel me Lord if there's a loose and
[1:32:33] show it to me that I can pray against
[1:32:35] you Lord
[1:32:36] I take you so seriously I love you so
[1:32:38] seriously Lord why can't I tell you
[1:32:40] every morning that I love you why can't
[1:32:42] I speak to you daily my father why why
[1:32:45] why do I want to be serious when it
[1:32:47] comes to church woman
[1:32:48] how many read that message is that
[1:32:50] sister Robin sent every day Faithfully
[1:32:53] every day reading them not with an
[1:32:55] obligation that oh she said I must read
[1:32:57] again not that's the wrong attitude
[1:33:01] with excitement that oh sister you
[1:33:03] didn't send today
[1:33:05] you didn't send she said oh sorry I
[1:33:06] forgot you said because you can't wait
[1:33:08] there
[1:33:09] that's
[1:33:11] that's what I'm talking about
[1:33:13] I'm going to finish
[1:33:19] it's homegoing time now
[1:33:21] for the bright we are about to go
[1:33:24] but thank God the little bride has made
[1:33:26] herself ready
[1:33:28] I can see here I can see the dress ready
[1:33:33] it ain't going to be it ain't long just
[1:33:35] hold on
[1:33:37] the prophet says it it won't be long I
[1:33:40] don't know how long I don't know when
[1:33:42] nobody knows that but we know it's close
[1:33:46] now real
[1:33:49] this was 1960 what four
[1:33:54] what's that this year he's talking about
[1:33:56] these movements at least what's the
[1:33:58] right word Atlanta
[1:34:01] movements and all those organizations
[1:34:03] watch it watch that watch nature natural
[1:34:07] what what's happening
[1:34:09] this Earth is like a big trombone
[1:34:13] he does he's out of his own cater the
[1:34:17] Earth itself is sending that sound you
[1:34:19] know they say climate change they say
[1:34:21] all they don't know nature is groaning
[1:34:23] everything is showing some animals I
[1:34:26] went home I went to the felt some
[1:34:28] animals that I grew up knowing that is
[1:34:31] extinct now
[1:34:33] some animals you'll find them well they
[1:34:35] never used to be
[1:34:37] you find them
[1:34:39] some are gone because the Earth is
[1:34:42] groaning everything nature
[1:34:45] the egg is wobbling
[1:34:48] it's making it a big out of his orbit
[1:34:50] you know it's going like this it's drunk
[1:34:53] with sin of this world
[1:34:56] is drunk it's just one to best
[1:35:00] and yet every day we see everything you
[1:35:03] open the news they want you want to hear
[1:35:04] the news opening they say hey we greet
[1:35:07] you all in the name of our Lord Jesus
[1:35:08] Christ
[1:35:10] you don't see the news like that
[1:35:12] everything you see negative negative
[1:35:15] because the mentality must be of
[1:35:17] Preparing People to go to hell for
[1:35:20] tribulation that's what the devil is
[1:35:22] doing to prepare this world what are you
[1:35:24] doing to prepare yourself what news
[1:35:29] are you updating yourself every morning
[1:35:31] which ones
[1:35:34] the ones that you are reading are the
[1:35:35] ones that are preparing and they are
[1:35:37] showing you which direction are you
[1:35:39] going amen
[1:35:41] homegoing time now watch no matter how
[1:35:45] many churches rise up what else they are
[1:35:48] blind to Christ
[1:35:50] and held to that law and God gave them
[1:35:53] ropes every one of them because they
[1:35:56] went down in
[1:35:58] I can't see better there
[1:36:00] in my title so the lord gave them
[1:36:03] ropes so he's talking about those ones
[1:36:06] that died amen
[1:36:10] this thing
[1:36:13] I'm gonna try to make it I'm not seeing
[1:36:15] well there but that's fine don't worry
[1:36:17] now
[1:36:19] now Faith is so simple that's what I was
[1:36:21] trying to tell you earlier on it's so
[1:36:23] simple and the way it's so simple it's
[1:36:27] like God himself
[1:36:29] God can God manifest himself in so
[1:36:31] simple ways
[1:36:33] that sometimes we we miss it
[1:36:36] so simple they missed it
[1:36:40] they missed to see that he was God he
[1:36:42] was the son of God
[1:36:44] they missed
[1:36:46] God manifesting himself in Simplicity
[1:36:49] you know that's that's someone that the
[1:36:51] prophet preached in the seven churches
[1:36:52] God manifesting himself in simply
[1:36:54] Simplicity to a point where you can miss
[1:36:58] him
[1:37:00] me and you can miss God because we are
[1:37:02] looking for
[1:37:04] they say it's the figment of our own
[1:37:06] imagination sometimes misleads us our
[1:37:09] old nature
[1:37:10] so
[1:37:11] now
[1:37:12] it's so simple the scripture says faith
[1:37:15] is a substance
[1:37:17] of things have hoped for
[1:37:21] and is an Evidence of Things Not Seen
[1:37:24] and evidence you know when we say
[1:37:27] evidence
[1:37:28] we don't even mean circumstance
[1:37:30] circumstantial evidence no no we mean
[1:37:32] hardcore evidence
[1:37:34] that's how faith is it is so real real
[1:37:40] that that you can touch it but yet you
[1:37:43] can see it
[1:37:46] now you came to change this this night
[1:37:49] and you just jumped into your car
[1:37:51] to come to change why didn't you think
[1:37:53] first whether the car will start
[1:37:55] in a plane oh hey honey wait
[1:37:58] wait just don't talk don't talk let me
[1:38:00] try it what did you do that
[1:38:04] did you say hey you know what ah
[1:38:07] I don't know if this car will reach
[1:38:08] Church
[1:38:09] because you believed
[1:38:12] that's how Faith Works you believed okay
[1:38:15] maybe this example might be too
[1:38:16] simplistic because you'll say I've put
[1:38:18] petrol and I trust my car no no no you
[1:38:21] don't trust your car
[1:38:24] it is faith
[1:38:26] Faith works like that you must see me
[1:38:28] when I wake up rushing for the train at
[1:38:30] Trantham station in the morning I jump
[1:38:31] in that car before I even close the
[1:38:33] doors already revising
[1:38:35] because I believe the car is gonna move
[1:38:38] that's very how it works it's not Faith
[1:38:40] doesn't question
[1:38:41] no faith doesn't question whether uh you
[1:38:45] you gave me this Bible and I say ah
[1:38:47] David I don't know if I should tell him
[1:38:49] I was thinking that you know that
[1:38:52] doesn't negotiate he says Thank You Lord
[1:38:54] you gave me this Bible thank you
[1:38:57] think I take it
[1:38:58] even if you you it's not there yet with
[1:39:01] my visible eyes you up as my dad told me
[1:39:03] I bought your Bible
[1:39:06] it's as good as I have it to me
[1:39:08] I have a Bible because my dad told me I
[1:39:11] have it
[1:39:12] so for me I'm already paging the pages
[1:39:15] of the Bible
[1:39:16] that's how Faith Works to trust you know
[1:39:19] you know that little Daniel when his
[1:39:21] father talked to him and say he told me
[1:39:24] I don't know if I can tell it brother
[1:39:26] me he told me and I could see faith in
[1:39:29] that boy's eyes he told me without
[1:39:30] missing his ways foreign
[1:39:47] then we talk like friends he tells me
[1:39:49] things because friends talk things
[1:39:51] so I I I took it quickly to Spirit
[1:39:55] I see faith in that boy because his
[1:39:57] father told you and I'm telling you
[1:39:59] nothing is gonna stop
[1:40:01] himself with Elijah in South Island him
[1:40:05] he sees himself he's already there
[1:40:08] you can't come and tell him he's not
[1:40:10] happening no that does not work
[1:40:13] that's how it is you say Lord you said
[1:40:16] it father I never said it you said I
[1:40:19] have it
[1:40:20] here here's your weight Lord God wants
[1:40:22] us to remind him
[1:40:24] and say Lord was it not you who opened
[1:40:26] the Red Sea
[1:40:28] Lord was it not you
[1:40:30] was it not you that day when the Lord
[1:40:33] his word pricked you and you repented
[1:40:35] and you cried
[1:40:36] you I remind him Lord it was you that
[1:40:39] day you spoke to me
[1:40:41] was it not you Lord who who you know who
[1:40:44] who brought me brother Ben the first
[1:40:46] time I saw brother's house I just look
[1:40:49] at this brother anyway eating on the
[1:40:51] table there because I like to check
[1:40:53] people
[1:40:55] just to understand them I look at him
[1:40:58] and I say God bless you brother God
[1:40:59] bless you because I'm talkative you know
[1:41:01] I must admit
[1:41:03] then he says hello hello bless you then
[1:41:05] I try to engage him and I think this guy
[1:41:07] does not want to talk too much
[1:41:09] then I just see him talking tell him
[1:41:12] about the band that I know oh my God
[1:41:14] what happened to the car yeah the car
[1:41:16] the story of the car
[1:41:17] and I said ah maybe it's a brother who's
[1:41:19] going somewhere then I didn't realize
[1:41:21] that this is my friend
[1:41:22] and the Revelation came much later
[1:41:25] so
[1:41:26] God looks at you
[1:41:29] and you are underrating yourself
[1:41:32] and he says but
[1:41:33] so God is just going to allow the devil
[1:41:36] it's a tool not a the devil is not a
[1:41:38] vessel of God he's a tool
[1:41:40] he's just gonna allow that tool to get
[1:41:43] to you just to wind you up a little bit
[1:41:45] for you to know who you are
[1:41:47] because you it's like have you ever seen
[1:41:50] a situation where you know this child
[1:41:52] knows this thing and you come on yeah
[1:41:57] that's what God is doing and we
[1:41:59] sometimes just can't seem to see
[1:42:02] here we are
[1:42:03] and what we have
[1:42:05] and what we are losing
[1:42:07] ah
[1:42:09] Maybe
[1:42:10] we it's time it's time we wake up my
[1:42:12] friend
[1:42:13] don't you think
[1:42:15] I may be a mile from the bridge
[1:42:18] but I have been given a full earnest
[1:42:21] deposit
[1:42:23] I you can't tell me I don't have bread I
[1:42:26] have been given I might be a mile away I
[1:42:29] might be two kilometers it might be
[1:42:31] tomorrow
[1:42:32] but I have a break there
[1:42:35] I may be a mile from the bread but I can
[1:42:39] I can be just as happy with that quarter
[1:42:43] of in my hand
[1:42:44] as I as I can when I got the bread as if
[1:42:48] I've got it in my hand because I've got
[1:42:50] the pictures of power
[1:42:52] of the bread
[1:42:54] that's the faith we've been given
[1:42:57] it's the faith that is given us the
[1:42:59] earnest of our expectation it has given
[1:43:01] if God is the substance it's the
[1:43:03] evidence
[1:43:04] is that the deposit has been paid oh
[1:43:07] it's past nine
[1:43:09] the deposit has been paid
[1:43:11] when the deposit has been paid
[1:43:12] everything is ready for me it's just to
[1:43:15] move on to move into the house or just
[1:43:17] to collect the car
[1:43:19] my father has got the key waiting for me
[1:43:21] they're at the dealership
[1:43:22] is paid up already in full
[1:43:27] so I'm still saying yeah

[1:43:33] father that that is it are you sure is
[1:43:36] it real dead hey yeah yeah why are you
[1:43:39] nervous
[1:43:40] about what the father has promised you

[1:43:48] was it not him who said let there be the
[1:43:51] f
[1:43:52] was it not you who called you in the
[1:43:55] mouth of sin was it not him
[1:43:57] when you were drinking not thinking
[1:43:59] about him or was it you who went to look
[1:44:02] for him
[1:44:03] he found you now it's not the time for
[1:44:07] me and for you to doubt him on small
[1:44:09] things but he had come to church and
[1:44:11] then come here no we come here with
[1:44:13] great expectation we come here with
[1:44:15] great humility no humility knowing that
[1:44:17] we are coming before God meaning
[1:44:19] business no time for me to come here and
[1:44:21] start thinking about the season
[1:44:23] everybody who's here who's no no no no
[1:44:25] oh no it's not oh that one I don't know
[1:44:27] please man

[1:44:33] right
[1:44:34] we are you are the bride
[1:44:36] the bride knows she's the bride you can
[1:44:38] you can ask if the bride that is in here
[1:44:40] when you look at them you see this one
[1:44:42] is a bright
[1:44:43] when I look at there now I see a bride
[1:44:45] isn't it

[1:45:31] that's how that's that's why this topic
[1:45:34] fascinates me the the one of young
[1:45:36] people getting married because he talks
[1:45:38] about the bride and the bridegroom
[1:45:42] no devil must tell you you look nice
[1:45:44] today

[1:46:20] friend so that's that's the bride and
[1:46:23] the bridegroom that's how we are and we
[1:46:25] spend a lot of time in our everything
[1:46:28] thinking about him I can tell you if
[1:46:31] there's a machine now to measure
[1:46:33] Maggie's mind on a daily basis
[1:46:37] you will see what's going on in there in
[1:46:38] that mind
[1:46:41] how much time do you spend thinking
[1:46:43] about him the little time at work you
[1:46:47] know when you think of him your heart
[1:46:48] goes like this oh Lord you saved me you
[1:46:52] know you know they will tell you what
[1:46:54] the game was when I think of you my
[1:46:55] heart goes like
[1:46:57] no
[1:46:58] because you are in love
[1:47:00] you see and even us who are Alzheimer's
[1:47:04] we must pray for the for the we must
[1:47:06] pray for that refresh you know when you
[1:47:08] take a computer
[1:47:09] that when I think of my wife now my
[1:47:11] husband
[1:47:12] you know and when she looks at me that's
[1:47:15] that's about bright
[1:47:17] and the blood group every day because he
[1:47:21] has done so much more than your mind can
[1:47:24] fathom or can imagine
[1:47:26] I'm just gonna wrap it here brothers and
[1:47:28] sisters what I wanted to also read for
[1:47:31] you was these scriptures
[1:47:34] um
[1:47:36] Malachi chapter 4.
[1:47:38] because
[1:47:41] we've been called
[1:47:44] to be for our hearts
[1:47:46] to go like back to our forefathers in
[1:47:49] faith huh
[1:47:51] you know the scripture let's read it and
[1:47:53] he shall turn the hearts of the fathers
[1:47:55] to the children and the hearts that
[1:47:56] verse the heart of the children to the
[1:47:58] fathers is you and me now lest I come
[1:48:02] and smite the Earth with the case but I
[1:48:04] want us to read that middle middle
[1:48:05] sentence the heart of the children to
[1:48:07] their fathers our our forefathers in the
[1:48:11] gospel in the Lord the apostles now we
[1:48:15] are we are we are being called back our
[1:48:17] hearts our hearts Our lives our doings
[1:48:20] our everything back to them it must be a
[1:48:23] through a reflection of what happened in
[1:48:25] their lives
[1:48:26] what is going to happen today with this
[1:48:29] bride with those children must be like
[1:48:31] that previous verse that top verse their
[1:48:34] hearts of the fathers to the children we
[1:48:37] receive and our hearts back to them
[1:48:40] if they suffered
[1:48:42] if they exercise faith
[1:48:44] if they were just walking in the shadow
[1:48:47] their Shadow just touched a sick man and
[1:48:49] they they get healed that's what must
[1:48:51] happen to you and to me
[1:48:53] today our hearts must go back to the
[1:48:56] heart of our forefathers Our lives our
[1:48:58] everything lest God is going to come and
[1:49:00] smite everything
[1:49:02] so we are we've got it we it's in US is
[1:49:06] on us
[1:49:07] that all these things that I'm talking
[1:49:08] about must pass
[1:49:11] and our hearts must now be a true
[1:49:14] replica
[1:49:16] actually even more
[1:49:19] because the Lord said there verily
[1:49:21] verily I say unto you that believeth he
[1:49:24] that believeth on me the work that I do
[1:49:26] shall you do also even Greater Works
[1:49:29] than this shall you do
[1:49:31] that's what he because you are the gem
[1:49:33] you know what a gem
[1:49:35] if you read Hebrews chapter the last
[1:49:38] book of Hebrews or Hebrews chapter 11 he
[1:49:41] says those guys wanted to live with like
[1:49:43] like they wanted to live in our time
[1:49:45] because we are at the very end of the
[1:49:48] end they are going to ask you say Robert
[1:49:50] how did you make it
[1:49:53] right and and only then
[1:49:56] you know we'll have a true picture and
[1:49:58] understand it by and by now we are still
[1:50:00] limited and but let's wake up and not be
[1:50:02] limited let's understand who we are if
[1:50:05] the angels are going to to be amazed at
[1:50:07] the kind of songs you'll be singing
[1:50:10] thank God for the Isaac has already
[1:50:12] started the angels are going to look and
[1:50:15] say because they never fought like you
[1:50:18] they're going to say wow
[1:50:20] wow
[1:50:22] Angels get billing them they're going to
[1:50:24] be amazed make them make it what is that
[1:50:27] thing that we make when when the people
[1:50:29] the bride passes and we stand this and
[1:50:31] aisle
[1:50:32] angels are going to say wow
[1:50:35] and they look at you you
[1:50:38] say they wish they can talk to you and
[1:50:40] ask you
[1:50:42] how did you overcome
[1:50:45] I just want to spend 50 years with you
[1:50:47] please
[1:50:48] just explain to me
[1:50:51] I don't want to say 50 years but because
[1:50:54] in heaven there's no this time that we
[1:50:56] are talking about it's Eternal time
[1:51:01] in heaven there's no like this time as
[1:51:03] we know if there's no you see it's
[1:51:05] everything is just eternity
[1:51:07] so 50 years or 20 years or 100 million
[1:51:10] years won't be an issue
[1:51:12] there's no rush have you ever sat and
[1:51:15] thought about just in closing how is
[1:51:17] going to be in heaven
[1:51:19] and what you're going to do don't you
[1:51:21] want to be there don't you think it's
[1:51:23] worth two spend every minute
[1:51:27] about God's business
[1:51:30] I'm not saying we must not live our
[1:51:32] lives but every opportunity we get
[1:51:36] amen you must use it
[1:51:38] and may God help us on that note that
[1:51:42] our hearts can go back to the hearts of
[1:51:44] our fathers the devil must know that
[1:51:46] when a Son of God passes here this is
[1:51:48] the son of God
[1:51:50] this is the daughter of God I'm not
[1:51:51] gonna I'm not gonna try
[1:51:54] the devil must know that he can use my
[1:51:56] lips my mind
[1:51:58] for him
[1:51:59] he must know that not for nothing
[1:52:02] not for nothing
[1:52:05] so I think I will leave it here
[1:52:09] trusting that you have been blessed
[1:52:12] trusting that you have been encouraged
[1:52:15] if you if you are wearing your spiritual
[1:52:17] jackets as per the Marcus says I'm sure
[1:52:20] you have picked up some few golden
[1:52:22] nuggets
[1:52:24] they are ones I'm sure you have taken a
[1:52:25] bit of ten five percent fifteen percent
[1:52:28] the adults I'm sure you've taken you
[1:52:30] know at least 80 percent eh
[1:52:33] but the key is that our faith must come
[1:52:37] to a point where it gets tested
[1:52:41] because we are in a journey we are
[1:52:43] crossing over
[1:52:45] if the prophet in 64 said it won't be
[1:52:47] long
[1:52:50] it won't be long for real
[1:52:52] it's probably way later than we think
[1:52:57] and we've got no time for shenanigans of
[1:53:00] the devil and thoughts and things no no
[1:53:04] no no the moment you get that thought
[1:53:06] crash it like the devil must know he'll
[1:53:08] get a beating
[1:53:10] when he comes closer to you about silly
[1:53:12] stuff of him they belong to him
[1:53:16] I want to be so free
[1:53:18] that even Freedom will feel unworthy
[1:53:21] you know Freedom will feel that it's not
[1:53:23] worthy to be around me
[1:53:25] so free
[1:53:27] of all the devil's Shenanigans so may
[1:53:30] God bless you may God really enrich you
[1:53:33] it's my prayer as a church
[1:53:35] as individuals our visitors may the Lord
[1:53:39] shine upon you as you travel alone thank
[1:53:41] you for sharing with us tonight may the
[1:53:43] Lord bless you may the Lord really
[1:53:46] really
[1:53:47] test you
[1:53:50] it's my prayer I'm not Hashem
[1:53:54] because the Bible says we must count it
[1:53:56] all joy
[1:53:58] basically we should be saying Lord
[1:54:02] if you're going to use the devil bring
[1:54:03] him on
[1:54:05] that must be our tissue
[1:54:07] bring him on
[1:54:10] and Lord I'm in your hands
[1:54:13] you already overcome for me but try me
[1:54:19] try me
[1:54:22] and if you challenge yourself like that
[1:54:25] then you're going to be ready
[1:54:27] you're not going to say Try Me Lord and
[1:54:29] then you go and forget to pray and say
[1:54:32] ah no I was so tired you were what
[1:54:36] tired
[1:54:37] this flesh must be subject
[1:54:40] that this flesh must be subject
[1:54:43] if we say there are Services there's
[1:54:45] going to be Outreach or or someone is
[1:54:48] going to preach there we must support
[1:54:50] that because we are looking for the last
[1:54:52] we must not give excuses
[1:54:54] we must support and pray over it and go
[1:54:57] there
[1:54:58] huh if they say a mission of God who
[1:55:02] must support and go pray and go there
[1:55:05] physically to support it
[1:55:07] one hour I'm finished
[1:55:09] please let's stand on our feet
[1:55:12] I if I've just been all over the show
[1:55:16] forgive me
[1:55:18] but I pray that the little bit that I
[1:55:20] spoke through the help of the Lord is a
[1:55:22] blessing unto you and it just encouraged
[1:55:25] you
[1:55:26] and it has said the musicians can come
[1:55:28] and it just really motivated you and
[1:55:32] really challenged you
[1:55:34] to come closer to the Lord
[1:55:37] these things are of the devil that he's
[1:55:39] trying to bring in our lives they are
[1:55:41] not ours they are his he knows we are a
[1:55:44] golden people we are a bride
[1:55:48] and he must know that the certain things
[1:55:50] that he can test you anymore
[1:55:53] Hallelujah
[1:55:55] the song in your heart
[1:55:59] I give myself I am that's the song
[1:56:02] As we sing that song we are just going
[1:56:04] to be Reverend again and we're going to
[1:56:06] pray
[1:56:07] and then maybe maybe in your heart
[1:56:10] you've got a desire
[1:56:14] you know
[1:56:15] there was a young woman
[1:56:17] who
[1:56:19] the prophet was baptizing people and and
[1:56:21] said let's close our eyes
[1:56:23] and be Reverend and she she clothed her
[1:56:26] eyes she later became his wife she
[1:56:30] closed her eyes and she she had
[1:56:33] [Music]
[1:56:36] that voice
[1:56:38] so
[1:56:40] if we are Reverend before God and say
[1:56:42] let's close our eyes and be reverent and
[1:56:44] pray
[1:56:45] we we just want to observe the presence
[1:56:48] of God that nothing should disturb us
[1:56:50] not in front of my eyes because the eyes
[1:56:53] bring thoughts
[1:56:55] and lift up our hearts and our hands
[1:56:58] before him
[1:56:59] and not look sideways
[1:57:02] then then God have time to move
[1:57:05] as the angel passes
[1:57:08] touches you
[1:57:12] maybe maybe you want to pray for someone
[1:57:14] who's really needy
[1:57:17] as as we are we are Reverend before God
[1:57:21] I I want to pray that God can just just
[1:57:24] touch my heart more I pray that God can
[1:57:28] touch my heart to love him more
[1:57:30] I pray that God can can really
[1:57:34] you know just induce himself more in my
[1:57:36] life is that your desire tonight
[1:57:39] is that your prayer tonight
[1:57:42] Heavenly Father
[1:57:44] you can see the hands and the hearts
[1:57:46] that are lifted before you I don't know
[1:57:48] them I don't know what is in their
[1:57:51] hearts but you know them
[1:57:54] and you Lord you understand
[1:57:57] heavenly father I'm sorry if tonight I
[1:58:00] didn't speak so well
[1:58:02] Maybe

[1:58:07] but Lord you know
[1:58:10] my ambition my intention my purpose and
[1:58:14] my attitude you know everything law
[1:58:16] I pray that you just take everywhere

[1:58:25] it can be a blessing not a stumbling
[1:58:27] block not a case Lord but it can be
[1:58:31] viewed in a right way father and I pray
[1:58:34] my heavenly father tonight that you can
[1:58:36] bless your people you will care so much
[1:58:38] about them than me Lord Lord I pray that
[1:58:42] you bless and go with us home right now
