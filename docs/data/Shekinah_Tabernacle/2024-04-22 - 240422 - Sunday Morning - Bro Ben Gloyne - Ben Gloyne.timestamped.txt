[42:30] this is david speaking to to solomon
[42:35] and he says behold
[42:37] maybe maybe let's just go up to verse
[42:38] five let's just go back up to verse five
[42:40] and david said solomon
[42:42] my son is young and tender in the house
[42:44] that is to be billed for the lord must
[42:46] be exceedingly
[42:48] magnifical of fame and of glory
[42:51] throughout all countries i will
[42:52] therefore now make preparation for it so
[42:55] david prepared abundantly before his
[42:57] death then he called for solomon his son
[42:59] and charged him to build a house for the
[43:00] lord god of israel and david said to
[43:03] solomon my son as for me
[43:05] it was in my mind to build a house unto
[43:08] the name of the lord my god but the word
[43:10] of the lord came to me saying thou has
[43:12] shed blood abundantly and hast made
[43:14] great wars thou shall not build a house
[43:16] unto my name because thou has shed much
[43:18] blood upon the earth and my sight behold
[43:21] a son shall be born to thee which shall
[43:23] be a man of rest and i will give him
[43:25] rest from all his enemies round about
[43:27] for his name shall be solomon and i will
[43:30] give peace and quietness unto israel in
[43:32] his days and he shall build and house
[43:35] for my name and he shall be my son and
[43:37] i'll be his father and i will establish
[43:39] the throne of his kingdom forever i mean
[43:41] over israel forever now my son the lord
[43:43] be with thee
[43:45] prosper thou and build the house of the
[43:46] lord thy god as he has said of thee
[43:50] only the lord give thee wisdom and
[43:52] understanding and give the charge
[43:54] concerning israel that thou mayest keep
[43:56] the law of the lord thy god then shall
[43:59] thou prosper if thou
[44:01] take his heed to fulfill the statutes
[44:04] and judgments which the lord charged
[44:05] moses with concerning israel be strong
[44:08] and of good courage dread not nor be
[44:12] dismayed
[44:14] and
[44:14] let's just go to genesis we're going to
[44:16] go to genesis 45
[44:19] and we're going to read from verse 24
[44:20] just down to verse 28

[44:28] this is this is now joseph has revealed
[44:30] himself to his brethren he's uh sent his
[44:32] brothers back to get his family
[44:35] and he's and so now word is coming to
[44:37] jacob now he says here in genesis 45 and
[44:40] 24
[44:41] he says so he sent his brethren away and
[44:43] they departed and he said unto them see
[44:46] that ye fall not out of the way
[44:48] and they came out of egypt and came into
[44:50] the land of canaan unto jacob their
[44:52] father and told them saying joseph is
[44:54] yet alive and he is governor over all
[44:56] the land of egypt and jacob's
[44:58] heart fainted for he believed them not
[45:01] and they told him all the words of
[45:03] joseph which he had said unto them and
[45:05] when he saw the wagons which joseph had
[45:08] seen to carry him the spirit of jacob
[45:11] their father revived
[45:13] and israel said it is enough joseph my
[45:15] son is yet alive oh i will go and see
[45:18] him before i die

[46:38] once again lord in jesus christ's name
[46:41] amen amen god bless you may have your
[46:43] seats this morning so
[46:46] it's a bit of an unusual uh
[46:48] group of scripture but
[46:51] brother brown makes a very uh
[46:52] interesting statement in the message how
[46:54] can i overcome
[46:56] he says now i want to take my subject
[46:58] this morning of this how can i overcome
[47:00] now i chose this because i think it's a
[47:02] time that we should never let the spirit
[47:04] of revival die
[47:05] we've got to keep in revival constantly
[47:07] revived every day paul said he had to
[47:09] die daily that christ could live and we
[47:12] must never let that revival die within
[47:15] us so so the very purpose of him
[47:17] preaching the sermon how can i overcome
[47:19] is that the spirit of of revival would
[47:21] remain among the people within us and
[47:24] and and and i pray this is what we want
[47:26] i mean we want the spirit of revival
[47:28] just to grow and get stronger we don't
[47:30] want it to die we don't want it to go
[47:32] away but we know it's the devil's job to
[47:34] take us to try and take us out of
[47:36] revival amen but it's god's job to keep
[47:38] us in revival so it depends which one we
[47:40] side with is is what's going to happen
[47:42] in our life so i'm so glad that we can
[47:45] side with the spirit of god i mean that
[47:47] we can keep the spirit of revival among
[47:49] us now
[47:50] we read here in in first chronicles 22
[47:53] because i well i just picked up lily's
[47:55] bible a few days ago and the book mark
[47:57] was on this chapter and you know i just
[47:58] started reading i thought it's very
[48:00] interesting how how when david was
[48:02] giving his last commandments to to
[48:04] solomon he would give him these words he
[48:08] says he says if thou
[48:09] take us he to fulfill the statues and
[48:11] judgments which the lord charge moses
[48:13] with concerning israel be strong and of
[48:15] good courage dread not nor be dismayed
[48:18] now if we go back into uh joshua chapter
[48:21] one we see the those kind of
[48:23] instructions were given to joshua joshua
[48:25] we know was instructed to take the
[48:27] people over from you know you know out
[48:29] of the wilderness into the promised land
[48:31] the first words of well let's just go to
[48:33] joshua chapter one shall we let's um
[48:35] let's have a bit of a reading here um
[48:37] this morning
[48:40] where if we go to joshua chapter one
[48:43] and if we go to verse
[48:45] uh well we can just read from verse one
[48:47] it says now after the death of moses the
[48:49] servant of the lord it came to pass that
[48:51] the lord spake unto joshua the son of
[48:53] none moses minister saying
[48:55] moses my servant is dead now therefore
[48:57] arise go over this jordan now and all
[48:58] this people under the land which i do
[49:00] give them even to the children of israel
[49:03] every place that the soul of your foot
[49:04] shall tread upon it shall be given unto
[49:07] you as i said unto moses and then he
[49:09] outlines the the you know the um
[49:13] there in verse 4 the the boundaries of
[49:15] the land he says there shall not be in
[49:16] verse five any man shall be able to
[49:18] stand before the all the days of thy
[49:20] life as i was with moses so shall i be
[49:22] with thee i'll not foul thee nor forsake
[49:24] thee that he says be strong and of good
[49:26] courage for under this people shall thou
[49:29] divide for an adherence the land which i
[49:31] swear unto their fathers to give them
[49:33] and then he repeats it only be thou
[49:35] strong and very courageous that thou
[49:37] mayest observe to do according to all
[49:39] the law which moses thy servant
[49:41] commanded thee turn not from it to the
[49:43] right hand to the left and thou mayest
[49:45] prosper wheresoever thou goest this book
[49:47] of the law shall not depart out of thy
[49:49] mouth but thou shalt meditate there on
[49:51] day and night that thou mayest observe
[49:53] observe to do according to all that's
[49:55] written therein for then thou shall
[49:57] there now shall make thy way prosperous
[50:00] then thou shalt then thou shall have
[50:02] good success have i not commanded thee
[50:05] be strong and be of a good courage be
[50:08] not afraid neither bow that be thou
[50:10] dismayed for the lord thy god is with
[50:12] thee wherever thou goest so this is now
[50:15] there was a you could say there was a
[50:17] dispensational change among the
[50:19] believers
[50:20] they had been in the wilderness they had
[50:22] been you know there and the going around
[50:24] the mountain 40 years and all the things
[50:26] happened there the church splits and the
[50:27] trouble and everything going on but then
[50:29] finally there came a time where god said
[50:31] you've gone around this mountain long
[50:33] enough i never wanted you in the
[50:35] wilderness anyway turn northward cross
[50:37] jordan and go possess the land so there
[50:39] was a there was a change remember
[50:40] brother abraham said that you know you
[50:42] know moses representing the law could
[50:44] never take the people into the promised
[50:45] land it was grace that had to take them
[50:47] and jo and joshua represented that and
[50:49] so now here they are in this
[50:51] dispensational change if i can put it
[50:53] that way and god is telling joshua be
[50:55] strong
[50:56] be of good courage don't be dismayed you
[50:59] know and so so he he's telling joshua
[51:02] this because joshua needs to hear this
[51:03] because there'll be things that will
[51:04] happen in the land that will make him
[51:06] dismayed there'll be things that could
[51:07] potentially make him be afraid but he's
[51:10] told be strong and very courageous so
[51:12] what you're about to do be strong in it
[51:14] have courage don't be afraid and because
[51:16] he says the lord thy god will will go
[51:18] with thee wherever you go so the reason
[51:20] you cannot be afraid is because god is
[51:22] with you i mean the reason you don't
[51:23] need to be dismayed is because god will
[51:25] sort it out god will fight your battles
[51:27] i mean so there was a there was a charge
[51:29] given to him
[51:30] be of good courage
[51:32] and then we can even drop down in joshua
[51:34] and i have it here somewhere where
[51:36] joshua's final words to the children of
[51:38] israel he now gives the same um the same
[51:42] commission to the children of israel
[51:43] when he's about to
[51:45] die so you could say in his last sermon
[51:47] he gives us these words so we're in
[51:49] joshua 23 now
[51:51] and we're just going to read this i just
[51:52] want to show you that there seems to be
[51:54] whenever whenever god is
[51:56] is is moving and he's changing you could
[51:58] say what what is happening
[52:01] he gives this charge be strong and very
[52:03] courageous
[52:04] don't be dismayed
[52:06] amen footsteps of possession wherever
[52:07] you put your foot on whatever promise
[52:09] you lay your hold upon it's yours amen
[52:11] sure you have to fight but it's yours
[52:13] amen so we're in joshua 23 verse 4 he
[52:17] says behold i have divided unto you by
[52:19] lot these nations that remain to be an
[52:21] inheritance for your tribes from jordan
[52:23] with all the nations that i have cut off
[52:25] even unto the great sea westward and the
[52:28] lord your god he shall expel them from
[52:30] before you and shall drive them out of
[52:32] your sight and you shall possess their
[52:34] land as the lord your god hath promised
[52:36] unto you but
[52:37] but be ye therefore very courageous to
[52:40] keep and to do all that's written in the
[52:42] book of the law of moses that ye turn
[52:44] not aside they're into the right hand or
[52:46] to the left so so the commission that
[52:48] that was given joshua he passes on to
[52:50] the future generation the next
[52:52] generation because remember they had to
[52:54] possess the whole land it wasn't just
[52:56] what they had which was good they had to
[52:57] take the whole promise not just part of
[52:59] the word the whole world had to you know
[53:01] we fight not against flesh and blood but
[53:03] against spiritual powers spiritual
[53:05] wickedness and high places and so the
[53:07] devil's job is to try and rob us from
[53:09] our god-given rights that's that's why
[53:12] he's here he's a bluff he's an accuser
[53:14] he is the you know he's the one just
[53:15] like in um in a zechariah there was you
[53:18] know joshua uh was the high priest there
[53:21] and he was he was a raid and filthy
[53:22] governor so yeah or zerubbabel was i may
[53:25] get it mixed up but i trust you
[53:26] understand where i'm reading from and
[53:28] and satan was standing at the right hand
[53:30] of the high priest that was arrayed and
[53:31] finally i'm with the right and dirty
[53:33] rags to resist him but then the lord
[53:36] said the lord rebuked thee satan you
[53:38] know and and the devil was cast away and
[53:40] then and then god uh you know and then
[53:43] the high priest was instructed take off
[53:44] the filthy rags and put on the priest
[53:47] garments put on the high priest garment
[53:49] so the enemy was there to withstand that
[53:52] man the high priest coming into his
[53:53] office and don't you think the same
[53:55] devil will be withstanding you amen
[53:57] because he knows
[53:59] he remembers the day he lost the stinger
[54:01] of death he remembers the day he lost
[54:03] his keys
[54:04] you know and he can try and reason it
[54:06] all he wants but he knows jesus came
[54:08] into hell robbed him of the keys of hell
[54:10] death and the grave he knew the day when
[54:12] he was absolutely defeated but he's
[54:14] going to still withstand you to try and
[54:16] stop you coming to you into your
[54:18] position because we've received a word
[54:20] in this hour i mean where the apostle
[54:22] paul said that we're joint heirs with
[54:24] christ right we're made in the image of
[54:26] the lord and now we're here to fulfill
[54:28] that promise and he knew how powerful
[54:30] remember nothing could stand before our
[54:32] lord jesus cancer couldn't stand before
[54:34] him legions of demons couldn't hold a
[54:36] predestinated seed i mean you know he
[54:39] couldn't get drowned on the sea of
[54:40] galilee nothing can stop him
[54:42] superstition couldn't stop him religion
[54:44] couldn't stop him trouble in the church
[54:46] couldn't stop him nothing could stop him
[54:48] fulfilling his job and you and then we
[54:50] come down 2 000 years later and you see
[54:52] the prophet of god you know he was told
[54:54] nothing shall stand before thy prayers
[54:56] not even cancer amen so and and you
[54:58] could see nothing no enemy that came
[55:00] before him could stand before him
[55:03] amen every kind of sickness trouble
[55:05] whatever it was it couldn't stop him
[55:07] unbelief couldn't stop him religious
[55:09] prejudice couldn't stop him jealousy
[55:10] couldn't stop him nothing could stop him
[55:12] he walked on victorious i mean though he
[55:15] had a lot of trouble in his life we know
[55:17] we're not exempt from trouble but yet no
[55:19] demon power could stop him and god did
[55:22] not do that in our generation just to
[55:24] say well you could look back at that and
[55:25] say how neat that was no god was showing
[55:28] the power of the blood and he's showing
[55:29] the power of his salvation in a redeemed
[55:32] son of god i mean a redeemed man right
[55:35] brother brown was born in sin like we
[55:36] were he needed saving he needed the holy
[55:38] ghost like we do right but so god would
[55:40] take god would take a man and show this
[55:43] is what calvary achieves
[55:45] amen and now he doesn't just put it out
[55:47] there to say well that's him and now you
[55:49] could never you could never live a
[55:51] victorious life
[55:52] like that no he did it to show you this
[55:54] is what my blood does
[55:56] i mean to show you a living example this
[55:59] is a victorious christian
[56:01] amen and as he was called to be a
[56:03] victorious believer so we are called to
[56:05] be victorious believers that no
[56:07] weapon formed against he shall prosper i
[56:10] mean no no trouble no complex no pain no
[56:13] hurt amen none of those things amen are
[56:16] called to hold us back i will try
[56:18] right we have a real enemy he's not make
[56:21] believe he's not a thought he's a real
[56:23] enemy and he works 24 7 to try and stop
[56:26] you coming to your position because he
[56:28] knows as as the lord jesus came into his
[56:31] position and and the devils just had to
[56:33] fly for their lives they cried out you
[56:35] know have you come to torment us before
[56:37] the time you know they knew that number
[56:38] was coming and and they thought has it
[56:41] really come already have you come to
[56:43] torment us you know even before the time
[56:44] and though you know but now we're coming
[56:46] down to the day where they will be
[56:47] destroyed they will be tormented they
[56:50] will all the things they've done to
[56:51] humanity they will they've they've
[56:54] they've sowed now they're gonna reap the
[56:56] devil sowed now he's going to reap
[56:58] amen and he's going to pay for every
[57:00] single sin that he ever caused anyone to
[57:02] ever do
[57:03] glory to god
[57:05] amen but now we see here
[57:08] where there's a challenge now we never
[57:10] want to let the spirit of revival die
[57:12] now we read about jacob
[57:14] because jacob jacob had a very um
[57:18] you know this part where joseph was was
[57:20] um
[57:21] taken you know his
[57:22] his own sons you know sold them into
[57:25] slavery and
[57:26] lied about it took us took his um coat
[57:28] of many colors and he put it in goat's
[57:30] blood and seen a wild animal oh we just
[57:32] happened to find this in the desert and
[57:34] you know cooking up the story and and
[57:37] and jacob was was heartbroken for a long
[57:39] time
[57:41] though he was a prophet though he was a
[57:42] believer right we're going to meet jacob
[57:45] one day
[57:46] we're gonna we're gonna say jacob what
[57:48] was like to wrestle with the angel and
[57:50] he could actually ask us what it was
[57:51] like what was like for you to wrestle
[57:53] with the angel
[57:54] hallelujah because there comes a time
[57:56] where god gets a hold of you and you
[57:57] just get a hold of him say i want more
[57:59] than just a touch i want that you go
[58:01] till you change me
[58:02] you change my name you change my walk
[58:04] you change all that i am hallelujahs
[58:06] we'll be able to sit down and have
[58:08] fellowship and say i can relate to you
[58:10] jacob because i have the same kind of
[58:11] experience i mean i tried to work out my
[58:14] own survival just like he did hatch
[58:16] plans send gifts to esau and all these
[58:18] things but you know god has a way of
[58:20] just stripping everything from us
[58:21] because he wants you he doesn't want
[58:23] your schemes he wants you
[58:24] hallelujah so i thank god that's how god
[58:27] operates
[58:28] so jacob now
[58:30] he would he would spend now i just did a
[58:32] quick search so my maths and you know
[58:35] math was never my strong point but yes
[58:37] joseph was about 17 years old when he
[58:39] was sold into slavery
[58:41] and when he was 30 he became second in
[58:44] charge of all egypt that's when he was
[58:45] exalted to the right hand of pharaoh and
[58:47] so there was the seven years of of of
[58:50] plenty
[58:51] and then i think it after about two
[58:53] years of the famine is when joseph
[58:56] revealed himself to his brethren and
[58:57] jacob came down to egypt
[59:00] so
[59:02] if i can so that's about 22 years
[59:05] that jacob lived
[59:07] and i'll put it this way with an
[59:08] unrevived spirit
[59:10] that's a long time to be brokenhearted
[59:13] and he thought he was going to carry it
[59:15] to his grave
[59:18] so
[59:19] trauma
[59:21] the trauma in jacob's life it was real
[59:22] trauma he thought his son his favorite
[59:24] son he thought he was really dead
[59:26] you know so that trauma
[59:28] caused him to live
[59:31] just functioning but not as his former
[59:33] self
[59:36] trauma's a real thing pain's a real
[59:37] thing
[59:38] you know we are human beings
[59:41] okay some people
[59:42] realize they're human so pain affects us
[59:46] right we're not immune from pain we're
[59:48] not immune from trials we're not immune
[59:49] from hardship you know with and and even
[59:52] even it can be the
[59:54] you know many times trauma can blindside
[59:57] us
[59:58] well i don't expect this to happen well
[1:00:00] if we expected it to happen we would
[1:00:01] have bypassed it
[1:00:03] right so so this is how jacob was he was
[1:00:06] he was in such a way
[1:00:08] that
[1:00:09] i'm not sure if i have it in my notes
[1:00:10] but but when but when you know his sons
[1:00:13] brought the coat of many colors remember
[1:00:15] they just sold they just sold joseph
[1:00:17] into slavery maybe the silver was still
[1:00:20] um chinking in there you know clicking
[1:00:22] in their pockets as they go trying to be
[1:00:24] sad and upset and trying to you know try
[1:00:26] and put on this act
[1:00:28] because they knew he was alive
[1:00:30] they knew where he was going but they
[1:00:33] they put on this act they found the you
[1:00:35] know
[1:00:36] they took his coat of many colors dipped
[1:00:37] in the goat's blood and they come to
[1:00:39] their father maybe maybe they just you
[1:00:41] know i don't know how they pretended to
[1:00:42] cry they're all upset you know but the
[1:00:45] silver's still in their pockets of that
[1:00:47] payment
[1:00:48] and they're trying to say you know we
[1:00:49] found this in the wilderness just seemed
[1:00:50] to happen i don't know what's going on
[1:00:52] and then jacob was so brokenhearted he
[1:00:54] says he refused to be comforted
[1:00:57] so even so so his family his whole
[1:00:59] family his daughter-in-law's and his
[1:01:00] whole family his sons tried to comfort
[1:01:02] him but he said he but it says the bible
[1:01:04] he refused to be comforted
[1:01:06] so
[1:01:07] he lived in this pain
[1:01:09] and it caused them to to no doubt
[1:01:11] whenever joseph's name was was mentioned
[1:01:14] it just just brought the pain all back
[1:01:15] again
[1:01:17] and
[1:01:17] but i want you to notice now that we
[1:01:19] know that god was working out something
[1:01:22] as joseph would tell us brethren when he
[1:01:24] revealed himself in egypt he says don't
[1:01:25] be angry this is all done that life
[1:01:27] would be preserved so there's a bigger
[1:01:29] picture here than you know sure your
[1:01:31] jealousy caused me to go down and you
[1:01:32] know go down through the suffering but
[1:01:34] god has allowed it that i would end up
[1:01:36] here your lives would be saved you know
[1:01:38] our lineage would continue on god's hand
[1:01:40] was in all this even though many times
[1:01:42] in the dungeon i looked up and i did not
[1:01:44] see where he was but he was working and
[1:01:47] we can i'm sure we can look back in our
[1:01:48] lives and we can be in our darkest
[1:01:50] moments and we can and just know god's
[1:01:52] hand was there
[1:01:54] hallelujah his unseen hand and then so
[1:01:56] now notice notice jacob jacobs jacob's
[1:02:00] heart or his spirit was not revived when
[1:02:03] he received word from his sons that
[1:02:05] joseph was alive
[1:02:07] sometimes it takes more than word
[1:02:10] more than a word
[1:02:11] to revive someone's spirit
[1:02:14] it takes spirit and it takes the word
[1:02:17] and the spirit together to quicken
[1:02:19] someone revive them back to life
[1:02:21] i mean so so it wasn't it wasn't the you
[1:02:24] know even even the right words
[1:02:26] that they can be true
[1:02:28] sometimes that's just not enough it
[1:02:30] takes the spirit of god to bring and
[1:02:32] anoint that word right amen so i'm not
[1:02:35] saying don't don't try and comfort one
[1:02:37] another with words and nice things no no
[1:02:39] do that but say lord anoint it when i'm
[1:02:42] speaking to someone when i'm sharing
[1:02:43] things when i'm trying to comfort them
[1:02:45] might not just be words that i should
[1:02:47] say because if this is happening maybe a
[1:02:49] real heart in it
[1:02:50] i mean may there be the spirit of god in
[1:02:52] it
[1:02:53] so so you see it wasn't but but it's
[1:02:55] when he saw the evidence
[1:02:57] that joseph was alive remember the
[1:02:59] wagons that came with them back into
[1:03:01] canaan they didn't leave with those
[1:03:03] wagons they weren't their possession he
[1:03:05] saw he saw something coming with them
[1:03:06] more than just their words that he's
[1:03:07] alive evidence was coming
[1:03:10] though he never saw he never saw joseph
[1:03:12] that time when he saw the wagons that
[1:03:16] came with them out of egypt then his
[1:03:18] spirit revived when he saw the evidence
[1:03:22] amen when he saw the evidence that his
[1:03:23] favorite son was alive he came back to
[1:03:26] he revived his pain was gone and that
[1:03:28] was the expectation i'm going to see him
[1:03:29] again
[1:03:30] it wasn't the end of the story 20 years
[1:03:32] ago but now now there's going to be a
[1:03:34] wonderful reunion hallelujah and it's
[1:03:36] the same thing with you and i when we
[1:03:38] see the evidence of god
[1:03:40] amen when we see the evidence of god
[1:03:42] more than just words more than nice
[1:03:44] sermons more than nice songs but when
[1:03:47] god sends the evidence there's a land
[1:03:49] beyond the river i mean there's a place
[1:03:51] in eternity for you there's a there's a
[1:03:53] mansion there's a theophany body amen
[1:03:55] that you're about to step into when god
[1:03:57] sends the evidence you say well what is
[1:03:59] the evidence you know you know you
[1:04:01] sometimes just feel the presence of god
[1:04:03] strike you
[1:04:05] and and maybe it might convict you to do
[1:04:07] right or maybe you say oh you've got to
[1:04:08] surrender more or something do you know
[1:04:09] what that really is brother it says it's
[1:04:11] like your theophany bumping into you
[1:04:13] it's actually eternity bumping into you
[1:04:16] and it bumps into you and the more we're
[1:04:18] in revival the more you know what i love
[1:04:19] about this this is god's work we are his
[1:04:22] workmanship we're not our own
[1:04:24] workmanship this is not us trying to get
[1:04:26] ourselves to glory no this is god
[1:04:28] getting us to glory remember brother
[1:04:30] graham said the bridegroom call will
[1:04:31] come right through this message so a
[1:04:33] bridegroom call has been sent
[1:04:35] more than when we want we didn't even
[1:04:36] want it when we were born but god put
[1:04:38] something in us that we wanted it
[1:04:40] something to receive it so god has
[1:04:42] prepared a place for us so now what
[1:04:44] happens is it's actually eternity comes
[1:04:46] and bumps against you
[1:04:48] it's your theophany bumping against you
[1:04:50] and eventually it won't just be a bump
[1:04:52] and a bump but it'll you'll speed up
[1:04:55] it'll slow down and it'll be a
[1:04:56] connection
[1:04:58] and our bodies will be transformed
[1:05:01] hallelujah this is what's going on this
[1:05:03] way you know we actually have the
[1:05:04] evidence of heaven
[1:05:06] hallelujah more than just a putting a
[1:05:09] picture up of an empty tomb in jerusalem
[1:05:11] which is all perfectly fine but we've
[1:05:13] got more than that i mean but we have
[1:05:15] the god of heaven amen has come down
[1:05:17] among you and i hallelujah he's
[1:05:20] gathering of people from around the
[1:05:21] world that's actually the evidence and
[1:05:23] they're and they actually can that
[1:05:24] revives us
[1:05:26] hallelujah jacob jacob's spirit was
[1:05:28] revived
[1:05:29] i'm a son of abraham
[1:05:32] god's in control of my life
[1:05:34] this was all predestinated by god god is
[1:05:36] displaying himself in this my son's
[1:05:38] actually alive i don't have to live in
[1:05:40] this nothing could comfort him until the
[1:05:42] evidence
[1:05:43] that his son was alive awakened him
[1:05:45] again and it's the same thing with you i
[1:05:47] pray to god
[1:05:49] if we have trauma in our lives if we
[1:05:51] have hurt in whatever way
[1:05:53] we look and see the wagons
[1:05:56] we look and see the evidence of heaven
[1:05:58] we you know by faith we see his spirit
[1:06:00] moving among us touching our lives and
[1:06:03] it revives us
[1:06:04] hallelujah that that we don't have to
[1:06:06] sure the pain is real sure the loss is
[1:06:08] real the hurt but you know we don't have
[1:06:10] to let it let it define us
[1:06:14] amen we let the overcoming power of god
[1:06:16] define us i mean that's that's really
[1:06:19] what we should have and then i believe
[1:06:21] that's what we do have
[1:06:22] hallelujah where god has sent a word you
[1:06:24] know you know brother bram said about
[1:06:26] rebecca and the camels

[1:08:20] approaching hallelujah so i'm so glad
[1:08:23] that we are
[1:08:24] his handiwork
[1:08:26] amen we're not our own
[1:08:28] amen i think we should have greater
[1:08:30] confidence in our lord now than ever
[1:08:32] before if that you can but you combine
[1:08:36] every day of your life this moment right
[1:08:38] now you should have greater confidence

[1:08:44] hallelujah so we need to
[1:08:46] we need to keep that spirit of revival
[1:08:50] among us he says and he says in the
[1:08:53] easter seal in 1965 says now this is
[1:08:56] this is your own life this is my life
[1:08:58] it's where if it isn't the truth what
[1:09:00] i'm fixing to say that i'm one of the
[1:09:02] most foolish people in the world i've
[1:09:04] given my life for something there's
[1:09:05] nothing to and so have you but if it is
[1:09:08] the truth then i owe everything that i
[1:09:09] am i are everything i could be to the
[1:09:12] cause of which we're standing for and i
[1:09:14] think that we must never lose our
[1:09:16] enthusiasm you say well that's just an
[1:09:19] emotional workup no no brother the
[1:09:20] prophet tells us after the seal is open
[1:09:22] we should never lose our enthusiasm we
[1:09:24] should never lose our vibrancy and our
[1:09:26] excitement i mean the lord should excite
[1:09:28] us
[1:09:29] hallelujah he says as we see easter
[1:09:32] approaching it's just does something
[1:09:34] down in me i know that that's the day
[1:09:36] that the thing was sealed forever in the
[1:09:37] sight of god now we notice it's the same
[1:09:40] spirit that raised him from the grave
[1:09:41] that is dwelling in us now how could
[1:09:43] that be the spirit that raised up god
[1:09:45] jesus from the dead has has dwelling in
[1:09:48] us now now it is the spirit that
[1:09:50] quickens it's not the word that quickens
[1:09:52] it's the spirit that quickens the word
[1:09:54] or gives the word life it gives it wings
[1:09:56] to fly gives it access it's the spirit
[1:10:00] that does it so it's now the spirit that
[1:10:01] comes upon the people causing the word
[1:10:04] to live amen and that's what remember
[1:10:05] that's god's doing
[1:10:07] it's not even your doing no matter you
[1:10:09] think god is sovereign
[1:10:11] so he so it's not parliament in heaven
[1:10:14] now the government says well yeah we
[1:10:16] should come to 113 joshua stokes valley
[1:10:18] because
[1:10:19] the majority voted no no god chooses
[1:10:22] god chooses it's not it's not our choice
[1:10:24] though we may call upon him which we do
[1:10:26] god has to respond to that call by his
[1:10:29] own sovereign choosing just like us when
[1:10:31] god puts in our heart lord i want you i
[1:10:33] want to meet you where are you you know
[1:10:34] it's god's sovereign choosing to put
[1:10:36] that in you to begin with and to respond
[1:10:38] to that call so aren't you glad god is
[1:10:40] sovereign he said i'm going to meet you
[1:10:43] i'm going to change your life i'm going
[1:10:44] to walk with you amen remember jesus
[1:10:46] said to his disciples you have not
[1:10:48] chosen me i've chosen you amen so god's
[1:10:52] great sovereignty he pours his spirit
[1:10:54] out upon us to give us access to every
[1:10:56] divine promise hallelujah because he
[1:10:59] wants to see that promised word
[1:11:00] fulfilled in our lives he doesn't just
[1:11:02] want us to talk about it though that is
[1:11:04] good he wants to see it manifested in
[1:11:06] our lives amen so i'm so glad that the
[1:11:09] anointing is here of the word you know
[1:11:11] i'm so glad that we don't just worship
[1:11:13] him in spirit and know a truth or just
[1:11:15] truth and no spirit we are both
[1:11:17] amen we have wings to fly not lopsided
[1:11:20] flopping along like some seagull but an
[1:11:21] eagle soaring in the heavens
[1:11:23] amen it gives us access amen it's the
[1:11:26] spirit
[1:11:27] that does it now it's so important to
[1:11:29] keep
[1:11:31] uh an atmosphere of revival
[1:11:34] amen remember because you know what
[1:11:36] happens we have a glorious time and the
[1:11:38] devil tries to push back
[1:11:40] i say
[1:11:41] yeah we should we should expect a
[1:11:43] counterattack
[1:11:45] you know he's got a playbook and he
[1:11:47] sticks to the same playbook no matter
[1:11:49] what generation so the lord does
[1:11:51] something and the devil wants to try and
[1:11:52] steal it from us now we should exploit
[1:11:55] his counter-attack and then just attack
[1:11:56] again
[1:11:57] maybe we should keep pushing forward
[1:11:59] amen so we should expect oh we've had a
[1:12:01] tough week who's had a tough week
[1:12:04] i'll say i've had a tough week i've been
[1:12:05] up and down and everywhere in here but
[1:12:07] you know the more the devil fights we're
[1:12:09] going to realize the more the victory is
[1:12:11] on its way
[1:12:12] he's doing his last kick and the okama
[1:12:15] you know sure he can kick all he wants
[1:12:17] my god's greater than his kick emma no
[1:12:19] weapon formed against us shall prosper
[1:12:21] he has an expiry date
[1:12:24] you know one of the only first afrikaans
[1:12:26] words i learned young was frot
[1:12:28] you know the devil's gone fraud he's
[1:12:30] gone off
[1:12:31] you know he's got moldy his expiry date
[1:12:33] he doesn't want to read his expiry date
[1:12:35] but he's he's gone off
[1:12:37] right he has come to his end remember
[1:12:39] we've come to a time where really time
[1:12:41] is no more
[1:12:42] and he you know and he knows his sh his
[1:12:45] time is short
[1:12:46] hallelujah but but our time has just
[1:12:48] begun
[1:12:49] hallelujah why because we as eternity
[1:12:51] rolls on we're going to still be i mean
[1:12:53] but as we go into eternity he's going to
[1:12:55] come to nothing he's going to be he's
[1:12:57] going to be annihilated in the lake of
[1:12:58] fire amen hallelujah so he will kick but
[1:13:01] we're going to realize no we're informed
[1:13:03] against us shall prosper i mean we're
[1:13:05] going to look beyond like jacob if only
[1:13:06] he you know if only god gave him access
[1:13:09] to that unseen realm he could say no my
[1:13:11] son's not dead
[1:13:14] he's alive
[1:13:15] this is all part of god's plan though
[1:13:17] i'm in a lot of pain i miss him i want
[1:13:18] to see him you know but but this is all
[1:13:21] working out for my good
[1:13:23] he said how could 22 years of brokenness
[1:13:25] be for his good well it was for his good
[1:13:26] it preserved his life
[1:13:28] all that to happen that may seem a bit
[1:13:30] far-fetched but if we just look beyond
[1:13:33] lord jesus help us look beyond
[1:13:35] and and and realize this is working out
[1:13:37] for my good amen
[1:13:39] amen so he said now i remember so this
[1:13:42] is this is a
[1:13:43] calling jesus on the scene 1964 he says
[1:13:46] now i remember one night in in vandalia
[1:13:49] illinois walking into the meeting and
[1:13:52] had been no more in the meeting over
[1:13:54] five minutes he wasn't a feeble person
[1:13:56] around the place anywhere wheelchairs
[1:13:58] pushed out and piled up blind was seeing
[1:14:00] deaf and dumb speaking and just simply
[1:14:02] it the spirit of god was present and he
[1:14:04] just healed the whole group of them now
[1:14:06] that's when you can do something when
[1:14:08] revival's going but let the revival fire
[1:14:11] die down then you can hardly the people
[1:14:13] are still christians but they're not
[1:14:15] revived into that spirit that great
[1:14:17] atmosphere that does something it's just
[1:14:20] like in a forge in a blacksmith shop
[1:14:22] where you've got to get the iron hot
[1:14:24] before you can pound it on the anvil if
[1:14:26] you don't you'll never straighten it out
[1:14:28] and that's what it takes to have revival
[1:14:30] if everyone is under the heat of the
[1:14:32] holy spirit that's brought down the
[1:14:34] powers of god and a revival moving then
[1:14:36] there is prayer meetings going day and
[1:14:38] night every minute every year why the
[1:14:39] people wouldn't even leave the grounds i
[1:14:42] mean so he's saying that when the spirit
[1:14:43] of revival leaves it doesn't mean the
[1:14:45] people are lost it doesn't mean they
[1:14:46] weren't believers they're still
[1:14:48] christians but they're not they're not
[1:14:50] revived into that spirit that great
[1:14:51] atmosphere that does something so we can
[1:14:54] drop out of revival but that doesn't
[1:14:56] mean we're not overcomers it doesn't
[1:14:57] mean we're not believers
[1:14:59] right
[1:15:00] right it just means that spirit that the
[1:15:02] devil has well god has allowed him to
[1:15:04] come into our lives where god wants to
[1:15:06] use that to make us stronger but the
[1:15:08] devil uses that wounding aiming to pull
[1:15:10] us out of that spirit of revival but we
[1:15:12] can go through the same motions we can
[1:15:14] read the same quotes we can read the
[1:15:15] same scriptures sing the same songs
[1:15:18] and but yet we're still christians
[1:15:20] but yet be out of that spirit of revival
[1:15:23] i want you to notice brother brown said
[1:15:25] these things after the seals came open
[1:15:28] right yeah and he said it i just say a
[1:15:30] lot of things like brother danny steven
[1:15:31] he says well someone asked him well when
[1:15:33] did brother brown say that and he just
[1:15:35] said well when he was a prophet he said
[1:15:36] that
[1:15:37] so
[1:15:38] you know but some people like that kind
[1:15:40] of thing but you know let's say saying
[1:15:41] that we must never lose our enthusiasm
[1:15:43] we've got to stay in the spirit of
[1:15:44] revival you say well that's just healing
[1:15:46] revival with god does that we have more
[1:15:48] than just a healing revival
[1:15:50] we have divine healing meetings every
[1:15:51] service i don't know if you've realized
[1:15:53] but we have we have healing meetings
[1:15:55] every service we have deliverance
[1:15:57] meetings every service amen it's all the
[1:15:59] time
[1:16:01] hallelujah because it's just part of the
[1:16:02] word and we we believe the full word
[1:16:04] don't we i mean but we want to be in
[1:16:06] such a way in that spirit of revival
[1:16:08] where we can be shaped and molded into
[1:16:10] the image of the word
[1:16:12] right where god where our hearts are so
[1:16:14] full of love
[1:16:15] that
[1:16:16] doesn't matter how the word comes it may
[1:16:17] cut us in half but yet praise god and he
[1:16:20] moulds and shapes us into what he wants
[1:16:21] us to be
[1:16:22] hallelujah so i'm so glad we can stay in
[1:16:25] the spirit of revival i'm so glad that
[1:16:28] we can if we don't feel in revival we
[1:16:30] can get back into it
[1:16:32] amen that the devil has got nothing on
[1:16:34] us
[1:16:35] he's got nothing on us amen he's a
[1:16:37] defeated being we've got to really you
[1:16:39] know we're going to call him for what he
[1:16:41] is
[1:16:41] i really um so um brother tim pruitt had
[1:16:44] a have their easter camp their youth
[1:16:46] camp and there's one where it's just
[1:16:48] skits
[1:16:49] and then one of the skits you should go
[1:16:50] watch it but it's but it's a a court
[1:16:52] trial there's the believers god's the
[1:16:54] judge and there's the devil and you know
[1:16:56] they're having a go and you know and
[1:16:58] what i love is is it's all real
[1:17:00] testimonies that the young people are
[1:17:01] sharing about healing and deliverance
[1:17:03] but man you should hear them talk to the
[1:17:05] devil
[1:17:06] you know they they really put him in his
[1:17:08] place it's not a well mr devil if i have
[1:17:10] time can i please no no they tell him
[1:17:13] satan you heard me bound last camp but
[1:17:15] i'm free amen there was sickness in my
[1:17:17] family now they're healed you put that
[1:17:19] on my mama that of that cancer but now
[1:17:21] it's gone and all these things they
[1:17:22] they're just having a real go
[1:17:24] maybe because it's something physical
[1:17:25] that they could just but you know we we
[1:17:28] have the right by the blood of jesus
[1:17:30] christ to tell the devil where to go
[1:17:33] and where to stay
[1:17:34] it's not a please would you mind is no
[1:17:36] satan

[1:17:39] right to afflict me you have no right to
[1:17:41] trouble me you have no right to try and
[1:17:43] put this on me get out of the name of
[1:17:45] jesus christ i'm sick of you hanging
[1:17:47] around here i'm sick of this deadbeat
[1:17:49] atmosphere because of you being here get
[1:17:51] out in the name of jesus christ and i'll
[1:17:53] tell you this if you've just given your
[1:17:55] life to god two seconds ago you have
[1:17:57] that authority to put him in his place i
[1:18:00] mean it's not something now i've got to
[1:18:01] obtain something no by the blood of
[1:18:03] jesus christ you have every right to say
[1:18:05] satan get out in jesus christ's name we
[1:18:08] do not have to put up with his dead
[1:18:10] feelings we have to put up with any any
[1:18:12] of his deadness coldness you know this
[1:18:14] is not a freezer this is a furnace
[1:18:16] hallelujah so i think we should just
[1:18:19] rejoice and just say satan get out
[1:18:22] he will come he will try and come back
[1:18:24] because he's a creature of habit
[1:18:26] amen but i want to be you know i i think
[1:18:29] i heard brother donnie reagan say this i
[1:18:31] really like it you know i want to be
[1:18:33] such a believer that when satan sends a
[1:18:35] certain import devil against me that
[1:18:37] devil begs for mercy
[1:18:39] i don't want to go to his house
[1:18:41] i've got such a beating have you seen
[1:18:42] the scars that cast a still on my leg
[1:18:44] don't send me to those people please
[1:18:46] whatever you do what have i done wrong
[1:18:48] please i want to be that kind of person
[1:18:50] you know i don't want to be that kind of
[1:18:52] person where the devil says go get that
[1:18:54] guy and the guy and he says well it's
[1:18:55] going to be a working holiday this is
[1:18:57] going to be easy you know i don't want
[1:18:58] to be that kind of christian i want to
[1:19:00] be i want to be the kind of christian
[1:19:02] that the devil is dragged kicking and
[1:19:04] screaming against me
[1:19:06] amen why because our god lives
[1:19:09] hallelujah
[1:19:10] amen that's how we should be amen so so
[1:19:13] that
[1:19:14] just going back to solomon and joshua so
[1:19:16] that same you say commission was given
[1:19:19] to be strong and very courageous don't
[1:19:22] be dismayed there'll be times when we
[1:19:23] are dismayed
[1:19:25] who's had those times i've had those
[1:19:27] times you don't know how you're ever
[1:19:29] going to get through it but you know you
[1:19:30] just you know it's like your morale is
[1:19:32] just shot you kind of
[1:19:33] what's even the point
[1:19:37] how can i go on
[1:19:38] but yet there's something in you says
[1:19:40] you can
[1:19:41] that's a lot just keep going on
[1:19:43] amen you know
[1:19:46] if we burn every bridge
[1:19:48] there's nothing to go back to
[1:19:51] if there's no exit ramp you've burnt
[1:19:53] every bridge
[1:19:54] here i am here i stand
[1:19:56] amen then you can keep pressing on
[1:19:59] i mean but it's the lord that will keep
[1:20:01] us pressing on
[1:20:02] amen now
[1:20:05] what i love about so
[1:20:07] it's very interesting well i find this
[1:20:09] is my me my little mind joshua's talking
[1:20:11] to god and god says keep all the word
[1:20:15] i don't know what it what was going
[1:20:16] through his mind i don't know what he
[1:20:18] was thinking so do i need to keep this
[1:20:20] feast or i mean i mean which part of the
[1:20:23] word do i need to keep
[1:20:24] you know i mean keep all the word but
[1:20:26] where do i begin
[1:20:28] and but
[1:20:29] i i think it's a lot more simple than
[1:20:31] that
[1:20:32] because jesus would come
[1:20:34] and and he would be
[1:20:36] he would speak first to the devil in
[1:20:38] matthew 4 where where the great
[1:20:39] temptation came
[1:20:41] and um and then he said you know because
[1:20:43] you know the devil wanted him to make
[1:20:45] bread take the stones make it into bread
[1:20:46] so he could eat
[1:20:48] but then but then the lord reached into
[1:20:50] deuteronomy and says man shall not live
[1:20:52] by bread alone but by every word that
[1:20:54] proceeds out of the mouth of god
[1:20:56] and then jesus would make it even more
[1:20:58] simple
[1:21:00] because we have a lot of word right
[1:21:05] the pharisees would come
[1:21:07] because he had put the sadducees to
[1:21:08] silence this is in matthew 23
[1:21:11] and then one of them asked which was a
[1:21:12] lawyer asked him a question tempting him
[1:21:14] saying master which is the great
[1:21:16] commandment in the law which is the
[1:21:18] great one
[1:21:19] so
[1:21:20] humanly people will emphasize certain
[1:21:22] parts of the word they enjoy the most
[1:21:24] because we're human
[1:21:26] right some people you know so some
[1:21:28] people will if it's just now this is
[1:21:30] just carnal understanding
[1:21:33] because all revelation actually
[1:21:34] expresses one person
[1:21:36] the lord jesus christ if it's knowledge
[1:21:38] it's all disconnected thoughts
[1:21:41] so someone in their carnality might
[1:21:44] emphasize
[1:21:45] serpent seed more
[1:21:47] or they might emphasize
[1:21:49] revelations 5 more
[1:21:51] or the cross more in their carnality but
[1:21:54] if if they have a revelation they'll see
[1:21:56] all of those things are actually
[1:21:58] expressing one person
[1:22:00] well how is serpent's head express god
[1:22:02] well it tells me i'm a son of god
[1:22:04] right it's not just you know all about
[1:22:07] cain's line everything i know because
[1:22:08] when you read down the lineage of adam
[1:22:11] it says then man began to call upon the
[1:22:13] name of the lord there's not that phrase
[1:22:15] in cain's lineage it's only in adam's
[1:22:17] lineage so if god put something into me
[1:22:19] to call upon his name
[1:22:22] maybe you don't know where the answer is
[1:22:23] but there's something in you saying
[1:22:24] there's more to life law
[1:22:26] what is there when we die what's life
[1:22:28] all about that's actually calling upon
[1:22:30] the name of the lord you may not know
[1:22:31] his name as jesus at the time but he
[1:22:33] will show himself to you so to me it
[1:22:36] just shows that i'm a son of god
[1:22:38] praise the lord we know it explains the
[1:22:40] blood covenant all those things you know
[1:22:42] virgin birth all those things but to me
[1:22:44] it shows me that i'm a son of god now so
[1:22:47] so he's asked the question what is the
[1:22:49] great commandment in the lord jesus said
[1:22:50] unto him if thou love the lord thy god
[1:22:52] with all thy heart with all thy soul and
[1:22:55] all i know thou shalt love the lord thy
[1:22:56] god with all thy heart with all thy soul
[1:22:58] with all thy mind this is the first and
[1:23:01] great commandment and the second is
[1:23:04] is like unto it thou shalt love thy
[1:23:06] neighbor as thyself on these two
[1:23:09] commandments hang all the law and the
[1:23:11] prophets
[1:23:12] that means to the whole sort of so to
[1:23:14] keep the whole word
[1:23:16] is to love the lord thy god with all the
[1:23:18] heart with all our soul all thy mind and
[1:23:20] and to love thy neighbor as thyself
[1:23:23] it's all encapsulated five books of
[1:23:25] moses are encapsulated in two phrases
[1:23:29] hallelujah
[1:23:30] because if you think about it
[1:23:32] if you love the law with all that you
[1:23:34] are
[1:23:36] you'll be a true living worshiper
[1:23:38] right and
[1:23:40] the second is thou shalt love thy
[1:23:42] neighbor as ourselves as you love the
[1:23:44] lord with all that you are all carnality
[1:23:46] has to go all human understanding all
[1:23:50] all carnality now
[1:23:52] we are all built differently so i'm not
[1:23:53] talking about our personalities will go
[1:23:56] you know i said it a while ago i said
[1:23:58] i'll still be me up in heaven there
[1:23:59] weren't many gay men's but that was fine
[1:24:03] but you know i'll still be me armand
[1:24:05] will still be armand could be will still
[1:24:07] be ben christine will still be christine
[1:24:09] we'll still we'll still all be our
[1:24:11] personalities because god made us a
[1:24:13] certain way he we he's not a cookie
[1:24:15] cutter we're all different right but he
[1:24:17] says that the second one is thou shall
[1:24:19] love thy neighbor as thyself so so what
[1:24:20] i mean by that is
[1:24:23] to take out all carnality it does not
[1:24:25] mean that that our personalities go
[1:24:28] okay amen and so the second is thou
[1:24:30] shall love thy neighbor as thyself so if
[1:24:33] you love your neighbor as yourself now
[1:24:35] notice he does not say thou shalt love
[1:24:37] thy neighbor that you enjoy to be around
[1:24:39] as i self thou shall love thy good
[1:24:41] neighbor thou shalt love thy rich
[1:24:42] neighbor thou shall love thy generous
[1:24:44] neighbor as thyself you know he does not
[1:24:46] say any of that
[1:24:49] you thou shall love thy day but you
[1:24:50] enjoy or thou shalt love the brother or
[1:24:53] sister you enjoy the best that you click
[1:24:54] the most with as thyself no thy neighbor
[1:24:58] you know some neighbors are good
[1:24:59] neighbors some neighbors of bad
[1:25:01] neighbors some neighbors you wish you
[1:25:03] never had neighbors but they are all and
[1:25:05] i'm talking about the world now you know
[1:25:07] so so but you are called to love that
[1:25:09] person irrespective
[1:25:11] of who they are what they say what they
[1:25:13] do nationality whatever age whatever you
[1:25:16] know as yourself
[1:25:19] so now if you treat now you think now
[1:25:21] how do i want to be treated
[1:25:23] do i want to be kicked down do i want to
[1:25:26] be told i'll never make it do i want to
[1:25:28] be told you know what's the point in
[1:25:30] trying with you
[1:25:32] do you want to be told those things
[1:25:35] do you want to be told there's no he's a
[1:25:37] hopeless case
[1:25:38] do you want to be told what's the point
[1:25:40] they've gone too far they'll never get
[1:25:41] it they'll never there's no way that god
[1:25:43] can ever reach them they're they're
[1:25:45] unhelpable they're unlovable
[1:25:47] i don't want to be treated like that
[1:25:51] i want to be treated
[1:25:53] there's a rapture for you
[1:25:55] i want to be treated you're welcome here
[1:25:57] i want to be treated that you're a vital
[1:25:58] part of this body i want to be treated
[1:26:00] that that no one can take your place
[1:26:03] no one can take your place you are
[1:26:05] absolutely essential in god's economy
[1:26:06] that's how i want to be treated i want
[1:26:08] to be treated that the blood has
[1:26:09] cleansed me from all sin honorably
[1:26:11] honorary treated that my past has been
[1:26:13] forgot forgiven and forgotten
[1:26:15] that's how i want to be treated
[1:26:17] hallelujah only treated that though i
[1:26:19] fall someone will pick me up
[1:26:21] though i fail though i'll be forgiven
[1:26:23] and i'll be picked up though i say the
[1:26:25] wrong thing my personality just grates
[1:26:26] everyone like a cheese grater yet
[1:26:30] yet
[1:26:31] they're still grace for me
[1:26:33] i want to be treated that they're still
[1:26:34] understanding for me i want to be
[1:26:36] treated that i'm not just cut off
[1:26:38] because well
[1:26:40] yeah that guy
[1:26:42] you know that's how i want to be treated
[1:26:44] i want to be treated that i'm not used
[1:26:46] or abused or manipulated
[1:26:49] that's how i want to be treated so
[1:26:50] you've got to love your neighbor as
[1:26:52] yourself you know unfortunately some
[1:26:55] people don't love themselves
[1:26:57] they think they're worthless they think
[1:26:58] they're useless they think they'll never
[1:27:00] get anywhere where does that come from i
[1:27:04] do not read in the bible
[1:27:06] that we are in that condition
[1:27:09] god's covenant with me
[1:27:11] there's nothing in it that says i'm
[1:27:12] useless i'm worthless i'll never get
[1:27:15] anywhere
[1:27:17] maybe in the niv
[1:27:19] not inspired version
[1:27:22] if you read a different version of the
[1:27:23] bible that's fine
[1:27:25] but you know maybe it may be a man's
[1:27:27] opinion
[1:27:28] they will say that but that's not in
[1:27:30] that's not in god's covenant with me
[1:27:33] hallelujah
[1:27:36] so if
[1:27:38] if if you have in your mind that you're
[1:27:40] useless you're worthless you're you're a
[1:27:43] waste of you're using up someone else's
[1:27:45] oxygen
[1:27:46] that's the devil lying
[1:27:48] that is the devil lying to you you say
[1:27:50] well what's the point of my life
[1:27:52] there's a point
[1:27:54] there's a point to express redemption to
[1:27:56] the earth there's a point that this open
[1:27:58] word will become manifested in you
[1:28:00] there's a point that jesus christ will
[1:28:01] be made flesh in your life there's a
[1:28:03] point that you'll walk with god and will
[1:28:05] be not because god will take you that's
[1:28:06] the point of your life there's a point
[1:28:08] that you'll be a light to this dying
[1:28:10] world that's the point amen that you're
[1:28:12] an attribute of god you'll be manifested
[1:28:14] upon the earth that's the point of your
[1:28:16] life you say well it's pretty hard at
[1:28:17] the moment just keep going
[1:28:19] just keep walking
[1:28:21] just keep walking say lord send your
[1:28:23] wagons
[1:28:24] send the evidence
[1:28:26] to revive me hallelujah send the
[1:28:29] evidence amen send your spirit oh god
[1:28:31] i'm hearing broken hearted and dare i
[1:28:33] don't know the way out but send your
[1:28:34] wagons i want to look beyond the curtain
[1:28:37] of time i mean to see everything's going
[1:28:39] to be okay you know you know if god
[1:28:41] struck your heart everything is okay
[1:28:43] you know if god has changed your life
[1:28:45] everything's okay
[1:28:47] you say well he hasn't done much for me
[1:28:49] but has he put something in in you that
[1:28:51] you want him
[1:28:54] that is a supernatural act of god
[1:28:56] because my bible tells me that no no one
[1:28:59] seeks after him not one
[1:29:01] the apostle paul's in the
[1:29:03] in the book of romans so if there's
[1:29:04] something in he says i want you lord
[1:29:07] that's god
[1:29:09] that's god that's a deep calling to the
[1:29:11] deep where'd that deep come from not
[1:29:13] from your humanity
[1:29:15] not from your upbringing though it may
[1:29:16] be a good upbringing but it's from god
[1:29:18] god put that in there before the
[1:29:20] foundation of the world and here you are
[1:29:22] there's something lord there's a hunger
[1:29:25] there's a longing there yo i may fail i
[1:29:28] may be a terrible believer but there's a
[1:29:29] longing
[1:29:31] hallelujah
[1:29:32] and the prophet asked well
[1:29:34] it's like a fish you know what was there
[1:29:37] first the water or the fin well the
[1:29:39] water was there then the fin on the fish
[1:29:40] is back so if there's a deep air there's
[1:29:42] a deep there first calling to the deep i
[1:29:45] mean it says heaven was calling he put
[1:29:47] it in here
[1:29:49] heaven was there first he put this
[1:29:50] calling that you would connect
[1:29:53] hallelujah
[1:29:55] amen so now
[1:29:58] everything's actually all right amen
[1:30:00] hallelujah
[1:30:02] because we're all said and done i know
[1:30:04] where i'm ending up in the back of the
[1:30:06] book
[1:30:07] hallelujah
[1:30:08] hallelujah i'm rejoicing on streets of
[1:30:10] gold
[1:30:11] amy well what about this what's going on
[1:30:13] in time well remember this is not the
[1:30:15] end of the story remember brother kaido
[1:30:18] stood here i think the second service we
[1:30:20] had upstairs and he preached a service
[1:30:21] to be continued
[1:30:23] hey man he preached to me continue he
[1:30:25] says he says you come to an end of a
[1:30:26] drama
[1:30:27] and and you know used to be on tv you
[1:30:30] know they have half an hour episodes
[1:30:32] they come to the end and there's some
[1:30:34] dramatic scene and say to be continued
[1:30:37] what's going to happen next week you
[1:30:38] know
[1:30:40] but that's like our life
[1:30:42] that's like our life there's always a
[1:30:44] you know the devil thinks now's the end
[1:30:45] but god says to be continues hallelujah
[1:30:48] and then we can just rejoice because god
[1:30:50] has the final say amen
[1:30:53] hallelujah if jacob could only see god
[1:30:55] has the final say
[1:30:57] amen but i'm so glad god revived him
[1:31:01] his spirit revived
[1:31:04] amen now that word revived because i i
[1:31:06] was i was i think
[1:31:08] well i was googling in the bible program
[1:31:11] you know revival revive and you know
[1:31:12] different different words and this is
[1:31:14] the first time
[1:31:16] that the word revive is used

[1:31:21] it means to to to make
[1:31:24] alive
[1:31:25] it means to quicken
[1:31:27] it means to recover it means to repair
[1:31:30] it means to restore to life it means to

[1:35:35] amen
[1:35:37] hallelujah now
[1:35:39] if we can just come here but okay
[1:35:44] hallelujah now
[1:35:47] our lord jesus is
[1:35:49] is a supreme deity
[1:35:51] this may i'm sure this is not news to
[1:35:52] any one of us
[1:35:54] but we are not being we are not serving
[1:35:56] some lesser god
[1:35:58] we are not serving a god
[1:36:00] we are not serving part of god
[1:36:02] but we are serving the very lord of
[1:36:04] glory the fullness of god here bodily
[1:36:06] dwelt in him
[1:36:07] i mean all that god was he poured into
[1:36:09] christ all that was poured into christ
[1:36:10] is poured into the church
[1:36:12] amen so
[1:36:13] now we're not serving
[1:36:15] now
[1:36:16] we're not serving just an idea we're
[1:36:19] serving the creator god himself jehovah
[1:36:21] god i mean we're serving the one who
[1:36:23] made heavens and earth
[1:36:25] he's the one who's called us he's the
[1:36:27] one who will keep us
[1:36:28] now brother brahm says it in a few
[1:36:30] places in his in his ministry
[1:36:33] he says now
[1:36:35] he says don't be afraid to trust it i
[1:36:37] see as he says now all around through
[1:36:39] the building tonight i'll say this
[1:36:40] morning if the lord jesus has risen from
[1:36:42] the dead and i've told you the truth and
[1:36:44] god is obligated to his word to make it
[1:36:46] so see he says don't be afraid to trust
[1:36:48] it it's either the bible is the truth or
[1:36:50] it's not the truth if it isn't the truth
[1:36:53] it's the biggest deceiver that was ever
[1:36:54] written for it's got millions deceived
[1:36:57] i've stood any time with the crown on
[1:36:58] one hand the bible and the other before
[1:37:00] the mohammedans and say one is right and
[1:37:03] the other is wrong let god the real god
[1:37:05] speak don't be afraid he'll never
[1:37:07] forsake he'll never leave now the lord
[1:37:09] jesus when he was here on earth the
[1:37:10] works that he did which we've just
[1:37:12] quoted he promised that he would come
[1:37:14] again before the end of time and would
[1:37:16] do the same things he said i that he
[1:37:18] would do it through his church now he
[1:37:20] said i'm the vine you're the branches
[1:37:22] now the vine doesn't bear fruit the
[1:37:24] branches bear fruit now if a
[1:37:26] if it's a pumpkin vine it'll be a
[1:37:28] pumpkins if it's a watermelon vine it'll
[1:37:30] be a watermelons if it's a cantaloupe
[1:37:32] vine it'll be a cantaloupe it's a
[1:37:33] grapevine it'll bear grapes if it's a
[1:37:35] christian vine it'll be a christ the
[1:37:37] life of christ the works of christ then
[1:37:39] our spirits have to be energized by
[1:37:42] something i mean so so our spirits are
[1:37:45] not energized by intellectual ideas of
[1:37:48] man they are not they're not energized
[1:37:50] by social norms our spirits are
[1:37:52] energized by the spirit of almighty god
[1:37:55] hallelujah you know brother brown would
[1:37:57] use this all through his ministry too i
[1:37:59] had a look you know where where he would
[1:38:00] he would relate the story
[1:38:02] when a woman from the christian science
[1:38:04] church would come to him after he
[1:38:06] preached and said you know i love the
[1:38:07] preaching but there's one thing i've got
[1:38:08] against you
[1:38:10] and brother i said well one thing i'm
[1:38:11] thankful for that and she says your
[1:38:13] problem is is that you make jesus divine
[1:38:16] and brotherhood says but he is divine
[1:38:19] but she says no he couldn't be divine
[1:38:22] she said you believe the bible i said i
[1:38:23] do she said look i'll prove to you by
[1:38:25] your own bible that he cannot be divine
[1:38:28] he was just merely a man a good man and
[1:38:30] then so she you know and then and then
[1:38:33] um
[1:38:35] um and then he says and then she says i
[1:38:37] don't want to hurt your feelings because
[1:38:38] christ died it was christian science you
[1:38:40] see said now your healings and things i
[1:38:43] believe in that every bit but she said
[1:38:45] you make jesus to be divine and by the
[1:38:48] way says why he's either divine or the
[1:38:50] biggest deceiver the world ever had see
[1:38:52] i said it was either god or he was
[1:38:54] nothing see and she said oh my mr
[1:38:56] branham he couldn't be divine and and he
[1:38:58] said well i want your scripture and he
[1:39:00] went to the short and she sorry i went
[1:39:02] to the shorter scripture in the bible
[1:39:04] and john 11 says jesus wept
[1:39:06] see he can't be he can't be divine
[1:39:09] because he wept at the tomb of lazarus
[1:39:11] and then brother ram said well you know
[1:39:13] your argument
[1:39:14] is shallower than a supra broth made out
[1:39:17] of a chat of a chicken that half starved
[1:39:19] to death because
[1:39:21] right after right after
[1:39:23] he wept
[1:39:24] he went to the tomb and cried out
[1:39:26] lazarus come forth
[1:39:28] amen so there was the man part speaking
[1:39:30] there was the god part speaking he says
[1:39:32] he absolutely was divine
[1:39:35] amen you know
[1:39:37] he was you know there on the cross he
[1:39:39] cried out i thirst but on easter morning
[1:39:41] he broke the seals of hell death and the
[1:39:42] grave and ascended up triumphant he was
[1:39:44] more than a man he was he that was god
[1:39:47] in the man that's right and the same one
[1:39:49] lives in us tonight as a spirit of the
[1:39:51] holy ghost yes sir now brother ram says
[1:39:54] the greatest of all revelations now the
[1:39:56] reason i'm going down this way is
[1:39:57] because if we can really just keep on
[1:39:59] our hearts the one who has found us
[1:40:02] the one who has called us the one who
[1:40:04] speaks to us the one who guides us the
[1:40:07] one who is leading us through life and
[1:40:08] we just keep that on our heart
[1:40:10] it's not a church guiding us
[1:40:12] it's not even a prophet if i could say
[1:40:14] it that way that's guiding us it's not
[1:40:16] man's opinion that's guiding us it's not
[1:40:18] our own enthusiasm that's guiding us
[1:40:20] it's the lord jesus christ the word
[1:40:22] himself guiding us
[1:40:24] amen says the god who made all things
[1:40:27] is guiding us because remember he is the
[1:40:29] revival giver
[1:40:31] hallelujah so he says the greatest of
[1:40:33] all revelations is the deity the supreme
[1:40:35] deity of our lord jesus christ he says
[1:40:38] you can't get the first base until you
[1:40:40] believe that
[1:40:41] amen when peter said repent and then and
[1:40:44] then see the deity be baptized in the
[1:40:46] middle of jesus christ for the remission
[1:40:47] of your sins and then you're ready to go
[1:40:50] in the spirit the first thing you know
[1:40:52] they have to know is the deity of christ
[1:40:54] i'm alpha omega i'm the a to z there's
[1:40:56] no more but me i was at the beginning
[1:40:58] i'll be at the end i'm he that was which
[1:41:00] is is to come the almighty think of it
[1:41:02] that's the one that's what the trumpet
[1:41:04] said that's in revelations 1. so the
[1:41:06] greatest revelation really is the
[1:41:07] supreme deity of jesus christ
[1:41:10] amen
[1:41:10] now
[1:41:11] jesus was not hated for being a
[1:41:13] religious or a man or a prophet or a
[1:41:15] teacher from god
[1:41:17] that was not what caused the people to
[1:41:18] kill him
[1:41:20] because even even nicodemus would come
[1:41:22] and say you know you're a teacher come
[1:41:24] from god we know that that didn't cause
[1:41:26] him to gather a mob and try and kill him
[1:41:28] but when he came down to a place and
[1:41:29] said i and my father are one that is
[1:41:32] that is what caused the great
[1:41:33] persecution of the lord because he says
[1:41:36] i and my father are one then they go to
[1:41:37] pick up stones again to stone them but
[1:41:40] then they say but but yeah but then he
[1:41:42] says but many a good work i've showed of
[1:41:44] you of my father which one of these do
[1:41:46] you stone me then then they said the
[1:41:48] jews answered him this is john 10 33
[1:41:50] saying for a good work we stone thee not
[1:41:52] but for bless me and because thou being
[1:41:55] a man maketh thyself god so so when he
[1:41:58] said i am my father one i knew exactly
[1:42:00] what he was meaning
[1:42:01] this man is claiming to be god in the
[1:42:03] flesh
[1:42:06] but that yo that was the that was the
[1:42:07] big complaint
[1:42:09] that's what caused the crucifixion of
[1:42:11] our lord
[1:42:12] right what was the what's the biggest
[1:42:14] complaint against brother brown he makes
[1:42:16] jesus christ god
[1:42:18] he says he says he says he's the supreme
[1:42:20] deity he's not just part of the godhead
[1:42:22] he is the godhead
[1:42:23] that's such a big complaint people
[1:42:25] cannot stand that
[1:42:28] but what i love about
[1:42:30] sunday
[1:42:32] is where thomas no no sorry this is
[1:42:33] after the resurrection sunday thomas
[1:42:35] thomas would say unless i see the holes
[1:42:37] in his hands and his feet aside i'll not
[1:42:39] believe unless i put my fingers in and
[1:42:41] things and then when the lord appears to
[1:42:43] him
[1:42:44] you know and he and then and then he
[1:42:45] says to thomas put your finger in my
[1:42:47] side different things thomas says unto
[1:42:49] him my lord and my god
[1:42:52] see it a revelation this is not just his
[1:42:53] law but it's his god in the flesh amen
[1:42:56] this is the supreme deity right here i
[1:42:58] mean to open his eyes
[1:43:00] hallelujah
[1:43:02] amen matthew 28 jesus would say all
[1:43:04] power is given unto me in heaven and
[1:43:05] earth go therefore and teach all nations
[1:43:08] baptizing in the name of the father and
[1:43:09] of the son of the holy ghost teaching
[1:43:11] them to observe all things whatsoever i
[1:43:13] have commanded you and lo i am with you
[1:43:14] alway even until the end of the world he
[1:43:16] says amen now we know that name that one
[1:43:18] name is the name of the lord jesus
[1:43:20] christ which is the name above every
[1:43:22] name
[1:43:23] amen it is not just a name that's why
[1:43:25] it's such a curse word
[1:43:27] in the earth is because there's power in
[1:43:29] that name there's no power in the name
[1:43:30] of muhammad there's no power in the name
[1:43:32] of buddha but there's power in the name
[1:43:34] of jesus christ amen there is supreme
[1:43:37] power in that name now
[1:43:39] that's why the devil loves to try and
[1:43:42] use it as a curse word because he knows
[1:43:44] because it says in philippians that that
[1:43:46] that that name is given above every name
[1:43:49] and that everything is going to bow in
[1:43:50] heaven and earth and under the other is
[1:43:52] going to bow to that name the devil's
[1:43:53] going to bow in the name of jesus christ
[1:43:55] i mean one day in a supreme way but in
[1:43:57] our lives he has to bow to that name
[1:43:59] hallelujah when we realize that it's not
[1:44:01] that that our god
[1:44:03] how incredible it is
[1:44:05] you know you know there's overcomers out
[1:44:07] of every age and and i'm just going to
[1:44:08] close with i'm going to read it quote
[1:44:10] two more scriptures then then we're done
[1:44:13] there's overcomers in every age
[1:44:15] we're called to be part of that group
[1:44:17] hallelujah god's made us to be part of
[1:44:19] that group
[1:44:20] when john saw the saw the vision of the
[1:44:22] church um you know the book of
[1:44:23] revelation and and he would write the
[1:44:25] letter to the latest in church age god
[1:44:27] just said the overcomer
[1:44:30] him that overcometh will sit in my
[1:44:31] throne as i've sat down in my father's
[1:44:33] throne so they're going to sit in my
[1:44:35] kingdom that's what it means to sit in
[1:44:36] my throne they're going to sit down in
[1:44:37] my kingdom
[1:44:38] hallelujah so so so he just
[1:44:42] wrote down he that overcometh but in
[1:44:44] god's mind he had your name there
[1:44:47] he already had your name there you were
[1:44:49] associated with that verse in god's mind
[1:44:52] that's why in this day and age right now
[1:44:54] you're overcoming glory
[1:44:56] you may be in the
[1:44:57] midst of the biggest battle of your life
[1:44:59] but you're gonna overcome
[1:45:00] remember never give up never give up
[1:45:03] never give up never surrender never
[1:45:06] retreat it's charge
[1:45:08] i mean i only know one one bugle note
[1:45:10] charge
[1:45:12] not retreat not hold fire fire
[1:45:15] hallelujah charge
[1:45:17] amen why because we are actually part we
[1:45:20] are part of that great group you think
[1:45:22] about it
[1:45:23] okay well how how we overcome as well
[1:45:25] there came a time in your life where the
[1:45:27] world overcame you
[1:45:30] yep
[1:45:32] unbelief overcame you trouble you know
[1:45:34] just the world but then the lord gave
[1:45:36] you faith to rise up above it
[1:45:39] so what happened now now you've overcome
[1:45:41] it because it doesn't overcome you
[1:45:43] so now if you've overcome that part
[1:45:45] you're going to overcome the next part
[1:45:47] because you're actually built to be an
[1:45:49] overcomer that's like david david was
[1:45:51] built to be king
[1:45:52] so the lion came along well who died not
[1:45:55] david the bear came along who died not
[1:45:57] david goliath came along who died not
[1:45:59] david where did he end up on the throne
[1:46:01] because he was built to be on the throne
[1:46:03] amen as as a little shepherd boy before
[1:46:05] that it was in him to be king
[1:46:07] god anointed that seed and it became to
[1:46:09] life and then so what was in him became
[1:46:11] manifested
[1:46:12] hallelujah why because he was built to
[1:46:15] be king
[1:46:16] amen we are built to be overcomers it's
[1:46:18] just our nature it's what we do
[1:46:20] hallelujah
[1:46:23] amen but then we also got to recognize
[1:46:25] that the one in us has already overcome
[1:46:27] all things
[1:46:28] hallelujah i love this is one of my
[1:46:30] favorite quotes from how can i overcome
[1:46:32] he says overcome means to recognize the
[1:46:34] devil in every one of his tricks
[1:46:36] hallelujah lots of people say there is
[1:46:38] no devil it's just a thought don't you
[1:46:40] believe that that's a real devil he's
[1:46:42] just as real as you are or anybody a
[1:46:45] real devil and you must recognize him
[1:46:47] real so you're going to recognize your
[1:46:48] enemies real he's really it's not a
[1:46:50] figment of your imagination it's not
[1:46:51] having a mood swing or a bad thought as
[1:46:53] the devil
[1:46:54] it's a real he's a real creature you
[1:46:56] must know he's a devil then the same
[1:46:58] time that you recognize him and know
[1:47:01] that he's a devil he's against you then
[1:47:03] to overcome you must recognize that the
[1:47:06] god in you is greater and mightier than
[1:47:09] he is that the one that's in you has
[1:47:11] already overcome him
[1:47:14] hallelujah so sickness comes trouble
[1:47:16] comes god doesn't scratch his head and
[1:47:18] say now how is this going to work
[1:47:20] i've never faced this problem before
[1:47:22] this is this is this is something new
[1:47:25] he never looks at the devil that way
[1:47:27] says no no i've already taken care of
[1:47:29] this i've already overcome this
[1:47:31] it was you know
[1:47:32] same you know i've been here before
[1:47:35] i've been here before i've dealt with
[1:47:37] him before and here i come again
[1:47:39] hallelujah he's already overcome
[1:47:42] amen now so you must recognize that the
[1:47:45] god in you is greater than mighty than
[1:47:46] he is that the one that's in you has
[1:47:48] already overcome him and by his grace
[1:47:50] you're more than a match for him
[1:47:52] amen you know i love grace grace is an
[1:47:55] enablement to do the word
[1:47:57] hallelujah so his grace that god's grace
[1:48:00] is upon us amen to overcome that's real
[1:48:03] overcoming when you recognize you look
[1:48:04] back and say i'm going to do this i'm
[1:48:06] going to do that no no you're defeated
[1:48:08] but there's no condemnation in them
[1:48:10] which are in christ jesus that walk
[1:48:12] after the flesh
[1:48:13] so that walk not after the flesh but
[1:48:15] after the spirit then you recognize that
[1:48:17] you've overcome
[1:48:18] and you know he's a devil you can't say
[1:48:20] i've got sickness and i i don't believe
[1:48:22] it's a sickness oh yes it's a sickness
[1:48:24] your cancer you say i don't believe it's
[1:48:26] a cancer it's a cancer it's a cancer but
[1:48:28] remember greater is he that's in you
[1:48:30] than he that's in the world you must
[1:48:32] realize that the holy spirit that's in
[1:48:33] you has already overcome this thing
[1:48:37] so whatever your problem is right now
[1:48:39] put in that category of this thing
[1:48:42] so the holy spirit in you has already
[1:48:43] overcome this thing and he's in you and
[1:48:45] you can overcome by him he says that's
[1:48:48] exactly sensible that's exactly the way
[1:48:50] the scripture is written he says
[1:48:52] overcoming
[1:48:53] hallelujah
[1:48:55] now i'm going to read i'm going to read
[1:48:58] can you put this up can you put up
[1:49:00] psalms 145 verse 8 and then we're going
[1:49:03] to go to ephesians chapter 2 then we're
[1:49:04] going to close i just want to read these
[1:49:06] two things because when you realize that
[1:49:08] the mercy of god is over your life
[1:49:11] it's not his wrath it's not his judgment
[1:49:14] it's his mercy is upon you
[1:49:16] oh my just should just revive us no
[1:49:19] matter where we are
[1:49:20] his mercy's upon me
[1:49:22] i can be in the
[1:49:23] deepest ditch though
[1:49:25] the worst spot of my life but his mercy
[1:49:27] is on me
[1:49:28] hallelujah
[1:49:29] i mean do we have psalms 145 and i just
[1:49:32] like to read it all together maybe you
[1:49:33] can turn there as well
[1:49:36] i saw this up i think it was uh oh no it
[1:49:38] was um
[1:49:40] yeah rfbf had had had this up when um
[1:49:43] yeah before by the youth without borders
[1:49:45] i trust you've been watching them if you
[1:49:47] haven't go back and watch them
[1:49:48] amen
[1:49:50] praise the lord we thank god for those
[1:49:51] meetings he says the lord is gracious
[1:49:53] and full of compassion slow to anger and
[1:49:56] of great mercy now verse 9 is the one i
[1:49:58] really want to get to
[1:50:00] the lord is good to all and his tender
[1:50:02] mercies are over all his works
[1:50:05] all thy work shall praise you o lord of
[1:50:07] thy saints shall bless thee she says his
[1:50:10] tender mercies are over all his works
[1:50:13] now maybe just to save time but in
[1:50:15] ephesians 2 and 10
[1:50:17] it says for we are his workmanship
[1:50:19] created in christ jesus unto good works
[1:50:21] which god hath before ordained that we
[1:50:23] should walk in them
[1:50:25] so if we're his workmanship his tender
[1:50:28] mercies are over us
[1:50:30] amen he's there guiding us
[1:50:33] nurturing us
[1:50:35] keeping us
[1:50:36] sustaining us because his mercy
[1:50:39] what are you living under i'm living
[1:50:41] under the mercy of god the mercy of god
[1:50:43] is upon me his tender mercies are upon
[1:50:46] me
[1:50:47] amen
[1:50:48] hallelujah so you say well
[1:50:50] you know
[1:50:51] if we could just just just take stock
[1:50:54] take stock of life
[1:50:56] now i'm not talking about how much money
[1:50:58] you have how much you don't what you'd
[1:50:59] like what whatever i'm not talking about
[1:51:01] those things take stock of life
[1:51:04] what is that
[1:51:06] well then well then okay let's take
[1:51:07] stock
[1:51:08] the one who made heavens and earth
[1:51:11] the very lord of glory
[1:51:12] the one who said let there be and the
[1:51:14] sun moon and stars the one who actually
[1:51:16] created the wasted to destroy
[1:51:19] the one who prophesied that there will
[1:51:20] be a new heavens and new earth the one
[1:51:22] who said that sin is going to be done
[1:51:23] away with the one who purchased our
[1:51:24] salvation on calvary the one who's been
[1:51:27] gathering a bride through seven church
[1:51:28] ages the one who's come down in this end
[1:51:30] time to gather a people for a rapture
[1:51:32] him has put his tender mercy
[1:51:36] upon me
[1:51:37] he has taken me and said you are my
[1:51:40] workmanship you may not known it for a
[1:51:42] long time but there came a time where
[1:51:44] you realized
[1:51:45] i'm god's workmanship
[1:51:47] and if his tender mercy is upon me you
[1:51:50] know i think i think it's with abraham
[1:51:51] it says well god is blessed shall be
[1:51:53] blessed
[1:51:54] amen so if god has called you
[1:51:57] you're blessed
[1:51:59] amen you are blessed and what god has
[1:52:02] blessed shall be blessed and god cannot
[1:52:03] reverse his blessing
[1:52:05] hallelujah
[1:52:06] so i'm so thankful for his tender
[1:52:07] mercies upon us
[1:52:09] amen but i pray that today we'll just
[1:52:11] look and we'll see the wagons coming

[2:13:15] anyway you know this song
[2:13:17] there is not a friend
[2:13:20] like the lord jesus
[2:13:22] amen
[2:13:24] it's a bit strange
[2:13:26] after the meetings i did enjoy the
[2:13:29] meetings
[2:13:31] and then the devil was dead he really
[2:13:33] attacked he really came for me amen
[2:13:39] he stayed up troubles at work my wife
[2:13:42] lost her older sister amen
[2:13:46] when we were coming to work
[2:13:49] to church
[2:13:50] when we were coming to church today
[2:13:54] uh she had a really severe backache
[2:13:57] she couldn't even sit you know it was
[2:14:00] really severe
[2:14:01] it attacked my daughter as well so
[2:14:05] i had a choice to turn back home
[2:14:08] or to continue to the service so i
[2:14:10] decided we go to the services now
[2:14:14] so
[2:14:16] that's why we came here amen
[2:14:19] now it reminds me
[2:14:24] reminds me of a boxing match amen
[2:14:27] so
[2:14:28] there are rules
[2:14:30] that you have to follow in a boxing
[2:14:31] match when you get knocked down
[2:14:34] they start counting
[2:14:36] as long as you hit the canvas you're on
[2:14:38] your back
[2:14:40] one
[2:14:41] two
[2:14:42] three
[2:14:43] when they get to 10
[2:14:45] and you are not up
[2:14:48] you have lost it
[2:14:49] they ring the bell
[2:14:51] then whoever knocked you down has one
[2:14:55] it doesn't matter if you are leading in
[2:14:56] the points
[2:14:58] but if you get knocked
[2:15:00] and you don't rise up after 10 if they
[2:15:02] get to 10
[2:15:04] you are out
[2:15:05] so when i stepped in church i hadn't
[2:15:07] even
[2:15:08] thought of singing a special
[2:15:10] i just came in we came in late when
[2:15:12] brother
[2:15:14] bo
[2:15:15] sisters episode here
[2:15:18] starting to sing that's when i thought
[2:15:20] of singing
[2:15:21] but it was in this song
[2:15:24] but i didn't come prepared to sing
[2:15:27] just think about singing and i had
[2:15:29] chosen another song
[2:15:32] and brother isaac didn't call me
[2:15:35] he did look at when a man came but he
[2:15:37] didn't call me
[2:15:40] now i understand why he didn't because
[2:15:42] we were meant to sing this one here
[2:15:45] now on sunday morning just before
[2:15:48] the song service i opened my bible
[2:15:51] randomly but i had been thinking of this
[2:15:53] scripture this scripture kept coming
[2:15:56] about elijah is actually first kings
[2:15:59] chapter 18 verse 40. so i opened my
[2:16:02] bible
[2:16:03] and it went directly to this
[2:16:06] to this song
[2:16:07] so
[2:16:09] in my bible in the king james
[2:16:12] it's just right at the top at the corner
[2:16:14] where it says
[2:16:15] the lord he is god the lord he is god
[2:16:21] and then it goes to when elijah led all
[2:16:24] those prophets of bowel he says don't
[2:16:26] let any one of them escape
[2:16:28] so he led them to the brook kildren
[2:16:31] and he killed them all
[2:16:33] and after that this is strange
[2:16:36] that they'd been in a drought for three
[2:16:38] and a half years
[2:16:39] but elijah says
[2:16:42] ahab
[2:16:43] get uprise and it for i hear the sound
[2:16:47] of abundance of rain
[2:16:50] so
[2:16:52] i have read that scripture before but it
[2:16:54] never struck me
[2:16:55] so he is killed there's been a showdown
[2:16:58] he has killed the prophets of baal
[2:17:01] and then he says i hear the sound of
[2:17:03] abundance of rain
[2:17:05] what touches me about this scripture is
[2:17:07] that there is no sign anywhere of a
[2:17:09] cloud
[2:17:10] he just tells ahab get in your chariot
[2:17:13] rise and eat because i hear the sound of
[2:17:16] abundance of rain
[2:17:18] and then after that
[2:17:19] he starts praying right and then he
[2:17:22] sends gazing seven says go on up the
[2:17:24] mountain and look beyond the sea and
[2:17:26] tell me what you see
[2:17:28] rain is coming but yeah goes up the
[2:17:31] mountain he looks towards the sea
[2:17:34] there's no sign of rain
[2:17:35] there's no cloud there but elijah said i
[2:17:39] hear the sound of abundance of rain i
[2:17:41] don't think anyone else there had
[2:17:43] anything but the prophet is saying i
[2:17:45] hear the sound of abundance of rain
[2:17:48] chaos comes down says i don't see
[2:17:51] anything
[2:17:52] there's nothing there and he was saying
[2:17:54] the truth because he had been told
[2:17:57] go up and check and tell me what you say
[2:18:00] so he comes gives a report there is
[2:18:02] nothing
[2:18:03] i don't see anything
[2:18:04] he says go back up again saw this man
[2:18:07] seven times going up the mountain he
[2:18:09] must have been worried is is this man
[2:18:12] still sane
[2:18:13] i'm telling him there is nothing over
[2:18:15] the sea go back the third time
[2:18:19] he must have been kissing and
[2:18:21] grumbling
[2:18:22] then the seventh time he says i see a
[2:18:25] cloud
[2:18:26] the size of a man's hand
[2:18:30] i was given that scripture on sunday
[2:18:31] morning
[2:18:33] now i come on sunday
[2:18:36] the song says i see a cloud the size of
[2:18:38] a man's hand
[2:18:40] someone out there is waiting for
[2:18:41] blessings
[2:18:43] if you were not waiting for blessings
[2:18:46] how else do you want god to talk to you
[2:18:49] that's how god speaks
[2:18:51] you are waiting for a
[2:18:53] blessing and he says hey
[2:18:55] it's there it's coming elijah says i
[2:18:58] hear the sound of abundance of rain gas
[2:19:00] doesn't see it but when he saw a cloud
[2:19:04] and then it didn't end there
[2:19:07] elijah says okay now get in your chariot
[2:19:11] this is not the normal rain this is
[2:19:14] serious rain you got a right now fast to
[2:19:17] jezreel because if you are caught in
[2:19:18] this rain it's gonna flood and
[2:19:20] everything so
[2:19:22] [Music]
[2:19:23] i have gas in the chariot
[2:19:26] and he said shall we give you a lift
[2:19:27] come on elijah come on he says no don't
[2:19:29] worry about me just get in the chariot
[2:19:32] and get to jezreel don't worry about me
[2:19:34] i'll find my way to jezreel and you know
[2:19:37] what happened
[2:19:39] how
[2:19:40] i think that man is the officially the
[2:19:43] one that holds the 100 meter
[2:19:46] recorder it's not usain bolt
[2:19:50] it's elijah
[2:19:51] it's elijah
[2:19:53] it's not written down but it's elijah
[2:19:55] who holds the record
[2:19:57] because the bible says he ran faster he
[2:20:01] overtook the horses and the chariots how
[2:20:04] fast was that men running
[2:20:07] how fast was that man running
[2:20:09] to overtake horses and chariots
[2:20:14] ab looked he says i've never seen
[2:20:15] anything like this the man just tricked
[2:20:18] past shh
[2:20:21] i see a cloud the size of a man's hand
[2:20:24] reason i wanted to sing
[2:20:26] was to tell the devil
[2:20:29] i'm still standing
[2:20:31] they knocked me down
[2:20:33] they started counting
[2:20:35] but before they go to 10 i was still up
[2:20:38] i'm up i just wanted to tell the devil
[2:20:41] i'm still in the battle
[2:20:43] he can't defeat me i'm still in the
[2:20:45] battle
[2:20:48] that's why i want to sing this song
[2:20:50] there is not a friend

[2:36:51] that went through my back and i haven't
[2:36:52] had it before and it went sort of into
[2:36:54] my abdomen
[2:36:55] and it was like it became so
[2:36:57] overwhelming that i had to leave the
[2:36:58] service and set out the back for a few
[2:37:00] minutes because it was going to make me
[2:37:02] you know you feel like you're going
[2:37:02] gonna faint just that nauseous pain so
[2:37:06] painful
[2:37:07] and um
