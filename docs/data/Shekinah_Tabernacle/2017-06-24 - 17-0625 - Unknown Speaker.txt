Christine's got a testimon this year Hallelujah knows I don't share testimonies often so he's not letting me get out of [Laughter] it God is so good to me and I'm just yeah so thankful for what he's done um I just want to share because I think a lot of you know that I've had quite a bit of trouble with um my sinuses like since March I had um teeth pulled out because cuz there was cyst growing through and the sinus cavity and different things like that so I've had a lot of trouble with that and it wasn't healing and I was in a lot of pain and this is um middle of March um may now so I had had a second operation like thing where they tried to fix this but it didn't wasn't successful so I was driving up to tango and I was a lot of pain I remember I was all black inside my mouth I was really sore and I was driving up to Tonga and I just was asking the Lord why because the devil started attack me like oh do you have faith now where is your Fai faith and I've seen the Lord do so many miracles in my life I've seen him I've had sister disappear when I was on the waiting list for operations I've had I've had grow fall off my face I've had so many miracles I know he's a Healer I know he's Mighty and I know that's not anything I doubt but I was like where is my faith and the Lord spoke to me driving up to Tonga that time so clearly he said this is a light Affliction just for a moment but with a far more exceeding weight and glory and when he spoke that to me it was I just shouted all the way to to I couldn't I was just rejoicing and it didn't matter whether I was in paying or whether I wasn't I knew I'd heard from the Lord and I knew that's what he said to me so I've held on to that ever since I've stopped worrying about it I'm just thankful to the Lord and then I saw the specialist um it was was also a miracle because it was so quick it was the same day that I rang up that when I was referred so normally it's months someone had canceled and I got to go in and they said that I've got two um large holes in the sinus which need to be repaired and I've got to sent to me to a bone missing which theyve got to fix so um I went home from that feeling like whoa now that is something I've been afraid of all my life is surgery so I'd had a very minor thing I thought oh well that's kind of like it but all you know it's not really that and I've always been had a great fear of being sedated it's because it's like out of controls so I've had this massive here and so I was went home from this and El Marie Rings me up and she says what's happened I've had you on my heart the whole day something to do with your mouth and I told nobody I think I might have told Chantel cuz she was there or something but I told nobody about it so the Lord had just put it on her heart so strongly and she um when she rang me she said I don't know why but the Lord has told me like I feel like I've got to tell you about my dad and I asked her if it's okay if I share this because it's quite personal but and she said that her dad had had a fear of being stabbed his whole life he just had this fear and that when he he was brutally murdered he was stabbed but she said that when he it took quite a long time before they killed him but he said to her mother who was lying there that he is no fear and that the Lord was with him and he knew that and she said he died a Victorious man because and so he had to go that way to overcome that fear and I felt the Lord speak to me so clearly whether it's the or Audible Voice I don't know but he said to me that's why you have to go through this so you know I'm with you even in a surgery something you fear and I am so excited cuz tomorrow is my surgery I'm so excited to know that the Lord's going to be with me and there's something Supernatural it's more Supernatural for me now than if he just healed me and I know it sounds funny to say because I've already experienced him as a Healer like that but I haven't experienced him as a comfort in this time like that before so I'm very excited to know that and um yeah looking forward to it and thank you for all your prayers especially for tomorrow amen amen praise the Lord hallelujah I'll be with you I'll never leave you nor forsake you amen can we just stand um I just want to sing let's just sing um well let's just sing that song um I'm so glad Jesus

pray You' have preeminence in the service Lord we Just Surrender ourselves to you Lord take control for your glory Lord in Jesus Christ's name may you grant it father amen amen thank you musicians amen God bless you all amen it's good to have everyone here today have Mom down from Oakland God bless you amen let's go to um Hebrews I want to go to Hebrews um chapter N I believe it is so now we'll go from Hebrews 9 verse 11 but Christ being come and high priest of good things to come by a greater and more perfect Tabernacle not made with hands that is to say not of this building neither by the blood of goats and of carbs but by his own blood he entered and once into the holy Place having obtained Eternal Redemption for us amen for if the blood of bulls and of goats and of Ashes of a he sprinkling the unclean sanctify to the purifying of the flesh how much more shall the blood of Christ Christ who through the eternal spirit offered himself without spot to God Pur your conscience from dead Works to serve the Living God am and for this cause he is the mediator of the New Testament that by means of death for the Redemption of the transgressions that were under the first testament they which are called might receive the promise of Eternal inheritance amen amen may the Lord bless his word you may you may have your seats and also I want to read another scripture from from John chapter 8 and Jesus speaking to the scribes and Pharisees in John 8 and verse3 it says as he spake these words many believed on him and we're going to read down to uh verse 36 then said Jesus to those Jews which believed on him if you continue in my word then are ye my disciples and indeed and you shall know the truth and the truth shall make you free they answered him we be Abraham's seed and were never in bondage to any man how saith thou we shall be made free Jesus answered them verely verely I say unto you whosoever committeth sin is the servant of sin and the servant abideth not in the house forever but the son abideth ever if the son therefore shall make you free ye shall be free indeed amen hallelujah now we read there in if you go read the book of Hebrews Paul you know the Apostle Paul is constantly contrasting between the blood of bulls and goats and the natural high priest they had the you know the aonic priesthood the sprinkling of you know of the blood of bulls and goats and he would contrast that with the blood of Jesus Christ and he says a few uh in a few places in the book of Hebrews that it's by one offering he did not you know the the high priest under the order of Aaron they had to go on once a year into the holiest place they had to offer their blood you had to offer the blood once a year you know but the blood of Jesus Christ was offered once amen it wasn't it doesn't have to be offered again our lord Jesus when he you know when he died that day on Calvary he paid the full price of redemption for every man woman and child you he died for the sins of the world so no one can say that Jesus has never done anything for them because he's already paid for our sin he's cleared our sin dead if we will receive it Hallelujah and he did it once so he didn't need to do it again he doesn't need to pay off any interest he doesn't need to do anything else it's already done hallelujah that's why he said the last few words he said is it is finished amen so now the reason the reason that he had to Die the way he did to purchase our Redemption is because he wanted man to be free amen and it's amazing when you know the scribes and Pharisees the very religious ones that Jesus even came to redeem they were rather in uh indignant that day where he said who you know we are Abraham's seed why should you know we have never been in bondage to any man but they had not realized that they were been in slavery because they were under slavery of a religion that could never free them they were under slavery to a religion that they could never climb above their fallen nature are you following me they were under a religion it was God ordained God told them to kill you bulls and goats and offer blood and have priests and do different things but it could never free them it only put them in prison because the law was only rarely given that man would know that they are in trouble that's right amen that man would know that they are under they are in prison I mean that's the only reason for the law it did not free anyone brother brandom said said that the law was just a policeman that put you in jail but the grace of Jesus Christ gets you out of jail Hallelujah so we can be really free this morning amen amen and I want to really pose the question to you are you free are you really free to worship the Living God Amen are you really free from your pasten are you really free from a guilty conscience that's right amen are you free from the things maybe you did yesterday right are you free of these things because realr Christianity is not to make you to reform you to make you a better person real Christianity is the life of God comes into you I mean changes your nature and your desire amen that you are not ens slavery to anything amen I am the most freest person today am mean I am not afraid of falling in sin I'm not afraid of falling into my old life I mean as I've said if I lived in a brewery I would be sober every day I live there Hallelujah because there's no desire in me for those things anymore I am free Hallelujah and the beautiful thing is I we don't deserve it we do not earn it I mean it is a free gift from God I mean Freedom real freedom to be a real person I mean a real son and daughter of God like you're meant to be is a free gift amen and it's nothing you can it's nothing you have earned that's right it's not on good behavior right hallelujah it's not because you're a good boy and girl you you you earn a new star on your on your wall thingy or you lose one cuz you're bad it's a free gift Hallelujah nothing wrong with rewards though and saying all that amen so now this is the question Jesus was asking them he say you are not free and they were not happy with his his his answer because he said You shall know the truth and they thought they knew the truth right they could have said to them what do you mean we shall shall know the truth we have the we have the word that God said through Moses and the prophets we know the truth but because it was under the blood of bulls and goats it could not make them free indeed amen they were still under a religious bondage they could never be free but Jesus came and he was actually the one who gave the law on Mount Si amen but he came to say the son if you know the truth the truth shall make you free it is not us that makes ourselves free the truth will make you free there is a law or a power behind the truth that it will make you free Hallelujah I'm so glad you know it will make you free Hallelujah now I believe it amen he says now if the sun therefore shall make you free you are free indeed amen right verse 36 so he's not saying you'll be partially free or free some of the time you'll be free indeed if you're free indeed there's nothing holding you back amen if you're free indeed there's no shackle binding you down you're free indeed you're totally loosed to do whatever you feel to do right Hallelujah so if we are called to run in this run in this day to run this race with patience there's no there should be no encumbrance there should be nothing holding us down amen you following me we can run amen amen so we have been called to run and we have been given the ability to do so y so I want to ask you the question now I've asked it already but I really want to just put this in are you really free you say well I'm a Christian I believe in the Lord Jesus that he died for me and he died on the cross fre but are you really free amen because it's it's the devil likes to hold our past against us I mean he likes to whip us with it you know he likes to you know every time that we have failed he likes to hold it against us amen when we try and rise up in faith and receive a promise he's always whispering in our ear but you do this and you did this wrong and look what's happened to your life and look what you've caused and all the damage you've done but you've got to you've got to make peace with the fact amen that if God has called you to Salvation which he has that's why you're present here today amen if there's something in your heart that wants him it's because God put it there and you've got to just put your past under the blood of Jesus Christ amen because our success and going in a Rapture is not based on what we can do but in saying that we yield ourselves say Lord I want to live a life let every breath all that I have never cease to worship you it should be that way but we're not going to get there on our ability that's right amen amen but it is our response to what he has done for us that's why we serve him Hallelujah I want to read you the um the definition of Grace hallelujah hallelujah this is under this is in the New Testament I've said this before but I love it so Grace in the New Testament now the Greek it means graciousness as gratifying of manner or act especially the Divine influence upon the heart and Its Reflection In The Life That's Grace yeah when there's Divine influence upon your heart and it's reflected in your life yes amen that's why when I think it's in Zechariah when he sees the when he sees the um when he sees the temple of God he sees the whole body of the redeemed and he sees the Capstone come down it comes down with Grace Grace with shoutings unto it amen because that Capstone is Jesus Christ coming to cap every believer Hallelujah so when you really see who he is there should only be a cry Grace Grace amen because because Grace is magnified in this hour amen Grace has been magnified because the Greater Grace is the greater the influence upon the heart amen and the greater the influence upon the heart the greater it's reflected in the Life Hallelujah so now this is the hour we alive to keep us free Hallelujah because we must understand that just as the first church was birth and freedom amen they were not bound by religion anymore they were not bound by the law of Moses they were not bound by you dead worship you they were purged from dead worship and formalism but then the enemy tried to come in and he did you read it in Acts about 15:16 how people who are fully not converted they came in and they tried to say people have to become Jews before they become Christians so there was now Spirit coming in trying to bind the people back from what they were heed from Hallelujah when Jesus came he didn't want to just you know he wanted the people separated from those dead things that's why it stand there see you bunch of wied wols you know he he told the people exactly what the scribes and Pharisees had done with the word of God and he made no butts about it he told them exactly you Generation of Vipers snakes amen you are of your father the devil and his works you do what is the devil's works if he can't get you bound down in the world or get you bound down in religion that's his Works someone say amen amen that's why this world is full of religion and people are not free right Amen in their good intentions they try and serve God but they're bound because the devil gives them a lot based on scripture amen and so he he he told them exactly what they were because of the spirit that was working in them and so now he identified those things that when the church was birthed at Pentecost it would be free and then the biggest battle that the Apostle Paul and the Believers had in the very early stages of the church was fighting the Antichrist Spirit trying to bind the people again amen that's why Paul says he says he fought the Beast at Ephesus he wasn't in an arena fighting lions I mean he wasn't fighting four-legged beasts he was fighting he was fighting Antichrist spirits in people because the Beast if you read the word beast in the Bible is an untameable thing it will not be yoked it will not be led it will not yield itself that's right amen because that's what that's what the devil is he's untamable he will not be tamed that's right right amen so he says he fought the beast in Ephesus so he was contending that's why Jude said earnestly contend for the faith that was once delivered to the Saints and that faith is total freedom amen that faith is total Liberty amen that we do not need to bow down to any humanistic spirit amen we do not need to bow down to any laws of man amen but Jesus Christ is our God and he is the one that we worship amen hallelujah and we must worship Him in spirit and in truth and we can in this hour Hallelujah huah we can be free we are I believe we are a free people amen but don't let the devil ever try and get you to bow down to something that doesn't belong to the Lord amen amen because if he cannot remember the devil he doesn't care you know how religious we may be but if we are just bound up by something amen he just wants to hold us back a little bit oh we're we're conservative who says we're conservative that's right in our worship who says we have to fit a certain mold that's right amen who says have to fit a certain mold based on our ethnicity amen of how we worship or you know how we praise God or you know who says he says we've got to fit some kind of man's idea of how things should be if it's contrary to the word of course we should never be that way but if it's pleasing unto the Lord we should definitely be as God has made us amen you take a you take a natural party you pass the wine around you know and eventually after a few drinks the very quiet ones will be shouting and jumping and they'll be like like everyone else amen hallelujah the loud Ones Will Be You Know The Quiet Ones will be the same as the loud ones because all inhibitions of God people don't really care about what other people think of them and it must be the same way with us we shouldn't care what other people think Amen brother B he saw a he saw a lady rejoicing and shouting in a service and he thought if I only had half the victory she had amen because remember there's always a dance there's always a worship Hallelujah when there's victory men you take the children of Israel hallelujah amen they they they they come out of bondage they're not slaves anymore they pass through the Red Sea and a few moments few hours before Moses says stand still see the salvation of God for these Egyptians you see you'll see them no more forever Hallelujah then they cross the Red Sea the enemy tries to follow them amen the Sea comes over their enemy they're all drowned Hallelujah Miriam takes a tambourine up they begin to dance and rejoice I mean there's a real worship there's a Pentecostal meeting going on because their enemy is dead Hallelujah that's just a natural enemy friends hallelujah amen but there was a worship they didn't say pray they didn't do some dead George and chant and walk on they were happy cuz their enemy Was Defeated am mean there was joy in the camp amen and we know the joy of the Lord is our strength you're following me but the thing is now if the enemy came along and said well well he couldn't because they were dead it was so real the devil couldn't come along and say oh the the Pharaoh's Army is going to come get you you're still a slave now they'd say look you see that guy floating there that guy floating there that guy there that horse that they dead amen amen they were drowned and it's like our past you've got to recognize your past is dead amen that God has destroyed your path thank you Lord hallelujah that's why it says in the book of Hebrews by one off offering amen he has perfected for every them that are Sanctified he doesn't need to offer his blood again he doesn't need to do it again amen amen and it's the same he's trying to break the cycle off the Hebrews that doesn't have you don't have to go from year to year meeting to meeting camp to Camp church service to church service but it's by one offering amen you following me they are perfected forever them that are Sanctified so he's trying to get them to see and it's the same thing with us forget your past amen amen if it's under the blood of Jesus Christ you know it's done you don't need to be beaten by it you don't need to beat yourself up about it it's under the blood amen you've got to put it under the blood amen don't let guilt hold you back cuz guilt is a lie Hallelujah God wants us to be free hallelujah how can we be free he see we think that it's God putting our guilt upon us no no amen that's what the devil tries to get you to think oh but you did this and look at what if you if you weren't this way this person wouldn't have ended up this way and you were like this your children wouldn't be like this and if you did this forget it stop this is not this is not I'm sorry this is not a Catholic religion of Perry yeah of of doing some good works to try and atone for what you've done we don't need to atone for anything he atoned hallelujah hallelujah he's our atonment Hallelujah you follow me he did it if he did it I don't need to do it right am mean why would I try why would I try and Purge myself am mean of my conscience just put it under his blood amen amen amen you think God doesn't understand amen you think he holds your the devil holds your past against you God doesn't hold your past against you amen that's right am mean if it's an unconditional Covenant between you and God he's not going to hold it against you amen hallelujah glory amen you've got to recognize I know my voice is not behaving but just just bear with me you got to recognize he's come to make you free amen amen don't let reasoning come in Hallelujah don't let reasoning come in you know you take the woman at the well she and it's one of my favorite parts of the scripture you know she because of her upbringing and her you know her past led her down that track so where once she was probably a good girl at home she was now stuck as an outcast in her Village that's right amen she could not find love even though she was looking for love because she was married five times and the one she man she was with wasn't her husband she could not find what she was looking for amen right she was stuck and it was her choices because of the pressure at home LED her down that way amen now did Jesus come and hold that against her no when he came he says I need to go by the way of Samaria in other words he could have said there's a woman Hallelujah she's in a state but she's one of mine Hallelujah and so she he said I must go this way amen so he planned the whole because he knew that she would be there at that time Hallelujah even though she was in no doubt her guilt would have held her she would have felt bad for the way her life had become right amen Why didn't it work out with the first guy I don't know why didn't it work out with the second guyy I don't know third guy fourth guy fifth guy sixth guy and here here She is hallelujah amen she could not stop but you must understand things things can happen in our past you know the Apostle Paul he speaks of and and I think I believe it's Hebrews chapter 12 we won't read it but he speaks about a root of bitterness he says do not let a root of bitterness come unless it defile you amen so what can happen and what does happen is bad things can happen to people and their whole life can be now a manifestation of that pain amen where where where they will choose to do things that they hate to do but they'll end up in places and dark places because of pain of what has happened to them maybe when they're a child amen right amen that's what happens and it is not their fault it is the devil that has done that to them amen but there comes a time where you can be free of those things Hallelujah where are person can go free when they can remember Jesus didn't just die to heal us physically right spiritually he came to heal us amen so wounds that's why he said let's go to let's go to Luke chapter 4 Luke 4 and8 Hallelujah now this is before because he comes out of the you know there's a Temptation he has you know Satan tempts him in the in the desert for 40 days or he's he's fasting 40 days he's temped the devil and then after that he returns to Galilee and this is his first announcement uh Luke 18 I mean Luke 4:18 well Luke 17 uh 4:1 17 because it says and there was delivered unto him the book of the prophet Isaiah and when he had opened the book he found the place where it was written so he was looking for a scripture the spirit of the Lord is upon me because he hath anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor he has sent me to heal the brokenhearted amen this is his purpose this is why Jesus came amen am mean to heal the brokenhearted to preach Deliverance to the captives and recovering of the sight of the blind to set at Liberty them that are bruised to preach the acceptable year of the Lord and he closed the book and he gave it again to the minister and sat down and the eyes of all of them that were in the synagogue were fasted on him and he began to say say unto them this day this scripture is fulfilled in your ears Hallelujah so he was declaring this is what I'm about to do amen I'm going to heal the brokenhearted so people who have been brokenhearted can be healed amen amen to to preach the gospel to the to the poor that can be physically or poor in spirit he has sent me to heal the broken heart to preach Deliverance to the captives amen now when you go to his ministry he doesn't go straight to the jails and open all the jail doors that's right he's not talking about just physical captives he's talking about spiritual captives where people have become enslaved by the devil amen but he says that I have come to deliver the captives and the recovering of the sight to the blind amen hallelujah that can be spiritual blindness as well amen and to set at Liberty them that are Bru amen he's also talking about a spiritual bruise amen where people can have bad things happen to them and it can bruise their Spirits now and they're actually enslaved by that bruise amen just like the body if it's bruised it is hindered in its function the same thing can happen when bad things can happen to us amen it can bruise it can produce a complex and our whole life can be now motivated by the pain of that bruise amen but he said I've come to set them at Liberty amen if he said I've come to set them at Liberty he can set them at Liberty Hallelujah you take the man who was who was Legion you know he he had a thousand devils in him you know he you know in his life he was a normal person and then he opened a door to one spirit and maybe he was looking for Comfort or something you know bad things can happen to us and then we go and find comfort and something try and drown our pain and sorrow amen I've been there and then he opened the door for another Spirit to come in the next thing he knows he's naked living among the tombs as a you demon possessed right Hallelujah now here's a man you think legalistically people would think there's no way he's gone too far he hadn't gone too far Jesus says we need a cross to se Hallelujah he knew that man was there amen so he couldn't save himself amen but then the son of man himself came Hallelujah then after a brief meeting he was that save man he wasn't that same man thank you Lord hallelujah he has found cloth and in his right mind amen now he could either be beaten down by his guilt or he could Rejoice I'm not that person anymore I've been free amen amen hallelujah amen amen so this is why the Lord came to set people free now the woman at the well she was bound amen she was bound there her life her past had bound her in such a way that this was now her l in life and humanly speaking without God ever coming upon her path that was her that's right that was her she was stuck and no doubt she would think how did Life come to this spot amen and many times we think how do we get into dark places like this but the reason we can get into Dark Places is because God wants to Deliver Us from those dark places amen hallelujah so now here comes the Lord and he doesn't condemn her for her past right amen he doesn't condemn her but there's something in her it says we know when Messiah cometh amen he'll tell us all things Hallelujah and in that moment she didn't have that problem amen she wasn't the woman at the well like she thought she was you know the problem is people get used to the condition they're in don't they we get used to it doesn't matter if it's wonderful F or terrible we become creatures of habit and we begin to actually worship our pain and worship our bad situations because we're used to them amen that's true it's Human Condition whatever state we're in we get used to that state amen and we just begin to well this is me and poor old me and wo is me and sure bad things happen and they're terrible you many 100% of the time but it's what do you want to own that thing that's right do you want to own that thing or do you want to be free amen cuz there's the two choices you can be free or you can remain bound amen hallelujah and it's nothing based on what you think you are in terms of are you worthy we're all unworthy we're just you just got to go beyond that come to that conclusion Lord I'm unworthy but yet I come Lord I don't deserve it but you've offered me full full Redemption amen Lord I could never earn this I don't want to try he doesn't want you to try that's right hallelujah amen amen doesn't matter what we think we are that's the problem humans humans put like to put things on scales because we're creatures of time and when it comes to comes to good and bad we always put good and bad on scales well this is not so bad this is really bad amen like a pickpocket that's not so bad compared to a murderer that's really bad amen but it's all the manifestation of sin it's all the attributes of so with God he doesn't put things on scales it's either black or it's white amen amen and he's not looking at well have you been a good boy or girl to deserve my my salvation even if you've turned it down God will come back around again amen amen hallelujah amen amen and so now he we put things on scales God doesn't put things on scales yes it's will you receive it or will you not receive it I'm so glad it's that that way amen it's not a seven seven Monon course to becoming a Christian it's not that way at all it's not a seven Monon course of how to clear your conscience it's not that way at all just put it all under the blood amen hallelujah I've done some horrific things well Moses killed a guy amen King David premeditated murder killed Uriah amen took bash Sheba committed adultery you know the story amen all these things are in the Bible for a reason amen the that Rahab was the only one who received the spies in Jericho he was a person come on friends go who's with me today he you with me it's the reason these people are put it wasn't the pious holy man in Jericho we've been waiting for you I'm holy now I'm going to receive salvation cuz I'm holy no it wasn't that kind of person they had their temples they had their religion they would have been calling upon their gods but here was a woman in in this kind of state and brother said it was cuz her parents put her out of the house amen because of the parent delinquency she ended up that way that's incredible because when when salvation comes to her house says I want a I want a sure token give me a sure token that me yeah I'll be safe and the spies say you just take the Scarlet thread take this rope that you're going to let us out of the out of the city by put it on your window th and thy house will be saved hallelujah hallelujah so the same parents that caused this to happen to her she brought them in hallelujah hallelujah think about it I mean so here she is in her State amen and salvation comes to her house and everyone who came under that token was safe in the time of Destruction and there's a reason that is put there in the Bible is because God is wanting you to know it doesn't matter what state you are in I mean we see destruction coming upon the Earth Hallelujah but just receive we've heard that we've heard what God has done amen and then we see he's risen out of History he's not a god of History anymore he's reality we're living in this we are living in this Bible Hallelujah give me mercy Hallelujah that's what she said give me mercy hallelujah hallelujah she received what she wanted amen that's why she's put there her past isn't so wonderful humanly speaking she was a she was a harlot but God wasn't looking at her har tree God is looking at will you take will you receive my promise hallelujah thank you Lord amen and all those stories are down through that's a reason brother Braham says that the Jews if it was if this was just just human humans writing a story why would such a proud Nation like the Jews put all that shame in those dark things about their about their heroes in the Bible and the but he's saying it's not a human book God inspired the people to write it that's right amen imagine Moses now cuz he wrote the first five books of the Bible and he's inspired to write Exodus or wherever it was that he murdered the uh you know slave uh slave master that's right no doubt he would have said I don't want to write that about myself tell them you've got a temper Moses I don't want to write that about myself but because he was a prisoner to the spirit of God he wrote down exactly what God told him to write Hallelujah no doubt King David I don't know if they would have gone over the Chronicles and read the read The Chronicles of the Kingdom but then the scribers whoever wrote it inspired to write about basima no doubt in this Humanity don't write don't write that down right Hallelujah I'm great King David don't write that down but God inspired them to write those things down amen you take you know there's all kinds of stories like that you know Abraham surely you no doubt if he could look over Moses's shoulder when Moses is writing the Book of Genesis no doubt maybe Abraham would have said to Moses don't write down where I backslid and went down into G here yeah amen that's right don't write it down right told Sarah you're my sister don't say we're married because they'll kill me to get you amen don't don't write it down basically I threw you under the bus to preserve me twice don't write it down amen he wouldn't have wanted that written down he with me Hallelujah but God inspired them amen but then when when when it comes into the New Testament amen through the blood of Jesus Christ now Paul is inspired to write about their lives Hallelujah and he would pick up his pick up his pen and when he would write the epistle to the Romans he'd say by faith Abraham staggered not at the promise of God but was strong giving praise fully persuaded that he' do that which is promise he staggers not hallelujah it's because through the blood of Jesus Christ amen when God is writing the commentary of their life he doesn't see their failure I mean he doesn't see the he doesn't see the humanity all he sees is the faith they had in the promise amen hallelujah it's the same thing with us we're all we we are we are people like their people we have pressures like they had pressures amen we have the same gray matter they do you with me we have the same human Spirit they did amen so there sure there's things in our lives we're not we're not too pleased about but you've got to come to a conclusion yes amen if God has saved me who's saved amen who's committed their life if he has saved you amen if he has saved you he saw what you have done are you following me he saw what you did he did not stop the woman at the well remember I just want to hit I just want to hit this real good if it's based on what our the the goodness of our past then why did he allow the woman at the well to become the woman at the well amen why did he allow Moses to kill kill a guy why did he allow David to do premeditate murder commit adultery that's right why did he allow all these things amen but it's because it's not based it's not based on your past amen and your and your ability it's purely based on God's salvation and God's election and it doesn't matter what state we find ourselves in Hallelujah that's why the woman at the well is so so precious is because it didn't matter what she the state Jesus found Hallelujah that's right amen and it's all the way you let's go to The Upper Room a moment let's just review the 120 that are there here's the here's the head Minister few you know 50 days about 50 days before this he had a sword in his hand it was dark in a in a garden he's trying to protect his protect his savior protect his Messiah he drew a sword because he the reason he cut off the guy's ear is because he wasn't a swordsman yes if he knew how to use the thing Jesus would have had to put his head back on that's right amen here's Peter pressure comes down he's following the Lord and there's the pilot judgment Hall and Jesus there being tried and here he is on the outside cuz he says I'll go with you to death right he promised I'll go with you to death Lord here I am boots and all pressure comes on little woman comes along aren you of those disciples amen I don't even know who this guy is another one comes along you're a Galilean you speak like him you must be you know I don't even know and then another person comes he begins to swear and curse and you know and before that Jesus looks in his eyes before this all happens he says you'll deny me before the crows you'll deny me three times then after after the third denial I'm not going to do a rooster impression but you know fill in the gap come and here's this man I'll stand with you none of the others said it none of the others said it here he is I'll Stand he buckles under a little bit of pressure he buckles and he runs alah denies the very one he says I'm going to serve this man to the end my goodness Hallelujah so here's so here's him he's the head he's the he's the pastor of the church that's not looking too good attempted murderer denies the very God he believes in amen here he is and then we got another guy there Thomas he says unless I see the holes in his hands and his feet I won't believe he's risen so he doubts the resurrection oh where's the faith in this place you following me that's right the woman at the well would have been there Hallelujah Mary Magdalene had seven had had had Seven Devils cast out of her amen there were former lepers there there were literate fishermen amen no one in in their human mind would join that church amen imagine the Facebook pages against them the biography of Peter you know I heard he tried to kill a guy we have witnesses what kind of holy Christian turn the other cheek kind of guy as this trying to kill people right where you know oh he's just like you know it's just all a hash it's just all made up but these are the people where are the priests there where are the ho men there where are the Levites there they weren't there that's right it was all the outcast the lost and undone they gathered themselves Hallelujah I'm so glad I can say them in that number amen hallelujah but that's the ones that Jesus gathered it wasn't them Gathering themselves it was Jesus Gathering them Hallelujah and so here they are that's the first church hallu they all have very dark places in their lives amen but Jesus delivered them all and they could use those dark places to enter into someone else's burden that they could be free amen amen imagine the shock of your life you're there on the day of Pentecost God comes down you know you're standing on the outside people are laughing these people are drunk Peter stands up and he and he begins to speak a word over you know you hear him preach you've never heard anything like this before Hallelujah and then you and then you become a Believer and then a few days down the road there's a testimony service amen and Peter stands up and tells about his old life Hallelujah there's a woman at the well amen everyone would be shocked amen how could they how could these people be in this place because God called them into this place hallelujah hallelujah so the woman at the well she didn't stay as the woman at the well thank you Lord hallelujah hallelujah and now she was free amen because anything in life can make you bitter or can make you better but it depends what you want it to do right Hallelujah and she was free and it's like a scar a scar is either awesome story or you can be bound up by that scar it depends how you look at it have you have you been freed you say I survived hallelujah amen that's someone who's been freed from from whatever happened but if they're still clutching oh was terrible no doubt it was terrible amen but scars are cool amen because it shows God healing power hallelujah look at this break and this break and my arm was up around like this and this and this oh oh that's pretty cool oh you should have seen it but I'm in one piece Hallelujah and that's what God he wants to do amen this is not like some AA meeting being survivors we're not survivors we're Overcomers we are more than Victorious through him that loved us we are more than conquerors Hallelujah so we're not a bunch of survivors oh I survived life no we don't we don't just survive we overcome and we've got some cool War Stories to back it up hallelujah amen amen so are you free amen here's the question are you free really free to Worship the Lord right glor or does the devil hold your past against you amen remember God God spoke to Joshua before they got across the Jordan circumcised the males again he says this they have rolled away their approach of Egypt off you there were people who were born in the desert there were there were young men because it was 40 40 years there in the wilderness there were young men there that never saw Egypt they were never slaves but yet they had to be circumcised again there had to be a reality that the reproach of their forebears had been done away amen and it must be the same with you and I that we can't hold on to the bad skeletons in the closet that happen in our parents' lives or our grand par lives or whoever what has happened has happened that's right go back in time and change it amen go I can't well then you can't don't hold on to the guilt of it go back last week change what you said to that person well I can't what are you going to do you going to hold on to it that's right or you going to put it right put under the blood of Jesus Christ and move on amen that's all you need to do is it that easy yes sir amen amen out of a sincere if you got saying right with someone go do it what their response is is up between them and God Amen and then you pray say Lord forgive me of what I've done tell them about it out a sincere heart and it'll drop into the blood of Jesus Christ and God doesn't remember it anymore Hallelujah many times the Devil comes along with our past and we say Lord forgive me that I did that and here he is saying what huh what are you talking about let's look at my record praise God there's only a blank page next well I don't have a yeah this is your record of life this is a Saint's record of life and we we stand there say Lord forgive me I did this and did this and did this and he looks and says I'm sorry it's not what are you talking about I don't forget yes amen he forgets your sins it goes to the Sea of his forgetfulness you're following me so if it was really a real thing a real it's what brother Bram says you're not forgiven you're Justified as if you never did it in the first place that's what real so we're not just forgiven it's we are justified by faith hallelujah hallelujah so we never did it in the first place amen that's why he takes up the record says well okay what day did you do it September 18th 2015 what time about 5: in the afternoon it's not there but I remember it no it's not there are you sure I'm sure he's sure of all things amen so if it's not on his record why are you worrying about it amen amen if it's not on his record why do you hold on to the guilt of it that's right it's the devil trying to hold things against you that's right yeah true hallelujah how you free yes I am thank you because we have to understand Peter says in Acts chap 10 to Cornelius he says God is not a respector of persons right so he's not partial one to another he is not a respector of persons all he have to do is come God's provided way amen amen so he's not a so he doesn't so if he was a respector of persons he could hold your past against you yes now if you want to read that that's in Acts 10:34 and Peter opened his mouth and said of a truth I perceive that God is no respector of persons but in every nation that that Feth him and worketh righteousness is accepted with him so he's not a respector of persons you come his provided way then he'll accept you amen but now we are called I'm just going to try and wind this up but in this day we are called to be free amen amen this day is the day of the restitution of all things restoration of all things so Adam and Eve they were not bound by anything before sin came in were they no they were free they were free people now God wants to prove his victory of Calvary to take a people still living in the sinful world Amen but make them free Hallelujah that the law of the spirit is in a people in such a way that their past doesn't hold them down their flesh doesn't hold them down their memory doesn't hold them down but they are free to worship God hallelujah this is the time of restorate it's like the slaves in in in America when the emancipation of Proclamation was proclamation of emancipation was written that's the bill to free all the slaves and on a certain day certain hour they were free when the came up they free on a certain day amen hallelujah so here they were one moment they were slaves but then when the sun came up amen amen as soon as the light hit them they were free Hallelujah and it is the same thing today amen that the gospel light is shining amen because it was because in those days like bit of a drama just say they're all in the valley the youngest ones could climb up to the top of the mountain to see the sun rising but the old ones couldn't climb up there so when the young ones went up there and the light struck them but it was still dark in the valley they could look back down and call and say we're free because the sun's up and it's the same thing today we've had a prophet climb up the mountain amen and he called down saying we are free amen we're free from denomination we're free from our path the blood of Jesus Christ cleans us from all sin Hallelujah there's nothing holding us here anymore and he calls it down and we hear the word but then it takes while for the sun to come up and when the sun strikes Us in the valley that's when it becomes more of a reality Hallelujah I know so it's up to you now now the declaration has come we're free you don't have to stay as a woman at the well you don't have to stay in a slave I mean you say it happen when I was a child you can't change it but you can change what it does Amen you can so and I've seen it happen many times God heals someone of the pain and the things of the past and they are free and they are not a walking wounded they free amen hallelujah so it's up to you the sun is shining yes amen the sun is shining the declaration has come from the word you are free Hallelujah that's why brother tells the eagle story he's not making some nice analogy he's declaring we were in the chicken yard yes but then we saw Mommy eagle fly over scream come up higher and something in it says yes I can do it I've never done it before I don't even I thought I was a chicken yes amen and that and that baby could either sit there say why didn't you find me earlier why have I been raised in this place you know and and and and take it as some complex and pain or they could look at it and say I want to be up there with you what do you want to do do you want to be free amen amen I just leave the question with you we are free to worship God in this day we are free to walk with him in this day amen there is nothing that the devil can put on someone that Jesus could not redeem them from amen there is nothing nothing can hold a person if they want to be free you say well don't let the devil lie to you and say well that's just a nice words that's just a nice phrase I can never be free that's the devil's lie that's right amen cuz he who the son has set free is free indeed Hallelujah so don't let your past Go Let It Go Amen Let the pain go Amen Let The Hurt go just let it Goen don't take ownership anymore you say well I've held this on for years let it Goen Let It Go I don't know what will happen just let it go you Lord what are you afraid of that's right amen don't you know we're not called to have some stockhom syndrome where if you don't know what that is is where a person was was was actually held hostage and they were with the captive for so long they didn't want to go free it's a real thing you don't have to have it that's right amen walk out of the prison that's right walk out of it Glory don't hold on to it anymore are you free are you really free amen if you're conscious just just put everything right and walk free amen we have some musicians to come because we are called to be free in this day hallelujah we're free people like brother Braham tells the story of the soldier boy you hear it he's so so he's up preaching in Canada the service has ended they're singing something like I love him because he first loved me and you can hear the prophet on tape he screams out you won't commit suicide soldier boy that's the devil talking to you deny him and be a real gentleman amen he just goes back to singing again and everyone's looking around saying who is that for cuz there's no one in uniform everyone's in a in a suit or whatever and then now he didn't he didn't receive his freedom then few days after that on the road Alaskan Highway the middle of nowhere hundreds of miles from anything there's a little town and brother brandham and brother bisc few others are there and they're having lunch in like the basically the only hotel for miles and then a man comes in and then another man comes in behind him and the and the first one comes in he comes and shakes brother BR say brother BR brother Bram you remember that Soldier Boy boy here he is here he is you called him out the meeting here he is and then brother says wait let's just have lunch and you have lunch they I'll talk to him he begins to eat his soup you go what brother bis's testimony he begins to enter into the burden for the soldier boy then they have lunch and they walk out brother bam and the soldier boy they walk down this way they have a private conversation brother bis and the other guy down here and then brother bis's watching them they both bow their heads brother Brown and the soldier boy they pray they stand up you they they walk back and the soldier voice says I'm free I'm free I'm free Hallelujah and his whole face was different from that moment he was free and then they're driving in the car brother Bisal and brother Bram they're driving in the car and brother Bram asked him do you know this guy he said no I have no idea who he is he says well because you don't know him I'll tell you he says he was in the Army and he's committing homosexual act with other people in the Army he tried to commit suicide all kinds of things doctors could never help him but then when God revealed that there in that in that walkway there he was free amen yes amen so no doubt the guilt of everything he did maybe he was trapped into it in the Army but he was a slave to that and his whole life was now manifesting what had happened but then Jesus Christ came and said him free thank you Lord amen amen and he is the same yesterday today and forever amen so I'll leave it I'll leave it with you amen I want to sing once my heart and soul was FedEd now I want to sing I want actually want to sing um I want to sing I love him because he first loved me Hallelujah I trust you know what this song means yes amen amen but I just asked the question you say well I'm not free you just talk to the Lord right now just put it all under the blood you can't no one can change the past so don't be a slave to your past amen let's just let's just say yeah yeah this this song y yeah I like this song stand with me we're a free people amen hallelujah there is a name my love to he I love to sing his [Music] word it sounds like you to S my ear the
