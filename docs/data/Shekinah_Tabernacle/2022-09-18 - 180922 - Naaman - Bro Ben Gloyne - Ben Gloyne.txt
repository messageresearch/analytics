I walk with the Heavenly done let me go all the while with a song and smile fill my way every day amen praise the Lord you can all take your seats here this morning amen so we have a few notices the first notices is that we have a youth service on this afternoon at 2 30 right here so we are looking forward to that I believe we have brother ketta who's going to be song leading and brother Jimmy is ministering in brother Dave is ministering so I believe we're in for a great time this afternoon amen now the other notice is is that on the Friday just path was brother Ben's last day at his job at the science lab [Applause] so as of I guess now he's um officially a full time with us and I think it's a significant occasion yeah and um I'm gonna get him to come up and just just speak a little bit about it but I just want to say something first before he does um because I think at the moment you know these are moments and and we're we are we are going to be blessed but we have also been a part of that moment that the fellowship here and striving for the work of the Lord you know we talked about it last night and we concluded that there's a lot of guys that can get a test tube and test wheeze you know there are many other guys and girls out there that can do that I don't want to make light of it but you know but someone that wants to actually dedicate their life to the ministry of the word of God the Bible says that the Harvest is great but the labor is a few and I think for someone that wants to do that I'm all for it I'm so happy that the kingdom of God can have us the Son of God that's a minister of God that wants to push the gospel of the Lord forward um and what I wanted to say about it was just that we we keep it in the right perspective of of our expectations because brother Ben knows that I'm sort of like I want to look after brother Ben and and I want to make sure that we all do as well you know and just because he's now full-time it doesn't mean that he's at our beck and call to to drain him of every last ounce of energy that he's got although I believe if you really need it you can go oh yes I understand but but you know we we want to make sure we look after him make sure we keep the the expectation correct like I've said to brother Ben and Sister Christine man on a well if it's a school day at three o'clock go down and pick the children up and go take them out for ice cream or something and have a good time don't don't burden yourself and be like feel like you've got to just I know if I see the president and I'm at the park with the children oh no are they going to think that I'm I should be working you know you know it's not like that it's like like if brother Ben is in a good place mentally that's right and he's in a good place spiritually that he's relaxed and he can actually enter into the presence of God and somebody comes up when he's in that atmosphere and he could minister to them or speak a word to them and they come around or something like that and it has a result because he's in the right frame of mind then how much is that worth if he if he relaxed all day with the children and got in a good frame of mind put it that way you know so it's not about it's he doesn't have to it's about making sure that he's in a good place that he can Minister the word of God and I think there's a scripture that says obey them that have the rule over you and submit yourselves for they watch for your souls as that as they that must give account that they may do it with joy and not with grief so I want to make sure that he can do it with joy we don't want to put this pressure on like I know Sister Christina's she likes it she doesn't like it she's not she's a giver she's not a taker so she wants to I think she feels like she she won't mind me saying this because I think it's a good attribute that she's a giver but I think she'll feel like oh no I can't go and Ben and I couldn't go down and pick the children up after school we've got to be working you know and but but we want to let her know that it's not like that you know you know we want you to be happy and relaxed and and enjoy be happy in yourself enjoy yourself like because because they've got the working for the kingdom of God is hard it's hard mentally sometimes you know you're you get in a place and you you as Paul said you know he's enlisted all the things that that all the hard things he went through and then he said on top of that the care of all the churches the weight that comes upon me is I have to have a burden for the the church now brother Ben has a burden for the church and that weight is upon him lets upon him whether he works a hundred hours a week or no hours a week that's upon him um and I one of my favorite scriptures is in Deuteronomy that says Thou shalt not muzzle the ox that treateth out the corn ER I really like that one you know that someone that labors let them eat let them have enjoyment don't just have this ox I like I love the goddess like that he he sees this oxus laboring and treating out the cornea saying if it wants to I put his mouth down and eat something don't stop it it's working hard you let it eat and Paul said you know do you think he's saying that for the the Oxford not really you're saying that for us you know that they that minister in the word of God should also be partakers but also there's another scripture that says let the elders that rule well be counterworthy of double honor especially they watch labor in the word and indoctrine for the scripture saith Thou shalt not muzzle the opposite treteth out the corn the laborer is worthy of his reward so so that's going to be our fellowship's thrust towards you is that we want you to be happy and don't feel pressured like now that you're full-time you've got to do all these things you don't you can just serve the Lord the bubble just be happy in the Lord and feel no pressure so that you can come here and be the spirit of God can flow through because that's what we're after and if whatever place that you need to be in to get that then you go there whatever that might be and we're confident in the Lord so I'd just like brother Ben just to come up because I think it's the moment so you come up and speak [Applause] foreign thank you brother Isaac appreciate that yeah love you all run this together let's take a Rapture that's why we're here I but lots of words actually it was weird walking out of work last time yeah it was great though last time I put my lab coat in the bin last time I did everything last time it was amazing but um you know it's actually it's funny how you said about anyone can do it anyone can do it but uh quite a few months ago we were watching one of the torchlighter series and there was a there's one there is cartoons about different testimonies of Believers Through the Ages and there's one about a uh some men they wanted to go contact some unreached tribes on the Amazon and they gave their lives in that but their wives actually took the gospel to these people but they were these young guys before they're married they're at University and one guy had a real burden of permissions he says look yeah yeah he's talking to this other guy who's being a lawyer or something training to be a lawyer he said you know anyone can do what you want to do but very few people are heeding the call for Missions and it kind of hit me like here you know because you know we're replaceable with anything but God's call is special yes and um yeah and then before we went to Canada I was thinking you know what am I doing here just keep coming in my mind and um yeah just praying about it and just felt you know like um when brother Abe Pana was here before covert um I met him before that time eight years before that and he was a teacher full-time but then when he came here to minister to us he was full-time in the ministry and I asked him what what happened I was expecting some big testimony you know God said do it and he said well there's a need and I could so that really come back in the way of my mind recently as well so you know I remember actually when we had our knife shop um I was in the back I was because things were difficult and I was praying said Lord what what should we do and he said to me I called you to preach the gospel so basically forget this thing not that we did but you know he's like because I'm about the shop he's no I called you to preach the gospel so it takes me a while to listen but eventually I get there so God bless you all love you so much and um I believe running in for good things you know let's see the dead in Christ race let's go home let's find every last one so we can go home so yeah God bless you thank you so much thank you amen this is Stan this morning and just think some some worship songs to the Lord next thing um I have a maker [Music] he falls [Music] my life [Music] He Knows My Name [Music] is [Music] is [Music] he knows my

brother Isaac amen good to see everyone here today praise the Lord who's ready to have church hallelujah amen praise the Lord let's um let's go to the scripture this morning we're going to go to Second Kings um apologies to everyone in taranaki who uh heard a bit of this when I was there um but last Tuesday no two Tuesdays ago before we went up the uh this came on my heart and um I felt we're still not done with it but it's kind of like and you'll only understand this if you've ever been there but it's like you go to a restaurant and you order the same thing but you get a different meal every time you know who's ever been to that kind of place it's kind of like that with the word of God you think it's the same thing but it'll be totally different thing amen some of the ingredients may be the same but hey it's a surprise anyway let's go to Second Kings chapter five um it's great to see you all here love you all and praise the lord it's just so good to be a believer in this hour so glad we have real stability and a strength and a power I mean it's not you it's him I mean that we can we can depend on so I mean let's go to Second Kings five and one and we're just going to read down to verse three just yeah just a few verses here says now Naaman the captain of the host of the king of Syria was a great man with his master and honorable because by him the Lord had had given Deliverance unto Syria and he was also a mighty man in Valor but he was a leper and the syrians had gone out by companies that have brought away captive out of the land of Israel little maid and she waited on naaman's wife and she said unto her mistress would God my Lord were with the prophet that was in Samaria for he would recover him of his leprosy what a fake amen let's bow heads in a word of prayer if you have a knee just want to raise your hand to the Lord this morning amen God knows all about our life I'm so thankful that's the case let's pray gracious father we want to thank you so much we can Lord we have learned to trust in you Lord you've never put us to shame oh God Lord You Lord when we call call you upon the scene Lord we surrender our whole lives oh God and Lord we allow you to be God and allow you to take over our God you always come and Lord you fight our battles we so appreciate your goodness in our lives dear God and we want to thank you that we could assemble in this place One More Time Lord we want to be in your presence Lord You're the one we've come to see to today so I pray Lord you'd bless this day Father's service this morning may just take it under your Divine control Lord may be the Unseen guest as we have Lord as we have lunch together and look at the youth service may you move in Mighty power as well there dear God we thank you Father Lord we have a few prayer requests from India Lord there's a brother Samuel and his wife Lord they've got bad sore throats and fevers and coughs Lord I pray you would Lord touch them Father he's asked for prayer and there's a pastor there Lord he he has a son who who's got a bad fever as well Lord may you touch the sun Lord May heal them Lord and father may he be their portion today and Lord Lord your bride around the world oh God may you move in power May touch lives and let my Souls be added to the kingdom father may you grant it we love you with all our hearts we thank you for this opportunity Lord to be in your presence together may you receive all honor glory and praise in Jesus Christ's name we want to submit Our Lives into your hands amen amen God bless your friends you may have your seats this morning um it was so I just uh I was kind of lost for words before but I had to it was weird to leave work because you kind of had to close a chapter of your life you know he had to kind of die to that kind of that's who I was that's not who I was so kind of mixed emotion but the Lord's good amen so we want to look into here Naaman being a leper it's amazing the um leprosy we know the Bible speaks of as a type of sin we know you know this is probably very Elementary to us all but I just want to go into this because you know it's amazing what can be happening in secret in our lives can affect our whole life and not just our life but the whole church you know it's amazing we're really you know we know Church troubles don't start in the church they start at home and they don't just start at home in the kitchen but they really start in the bedroom that's really where the biggest trouble is is is relations between husbands and wives can really stop the whole spirit of God flowing through that couple like it should you know where the Bible would say uh the Apostle Paul would say you know let the husband Render unto his wife do uh benevolence and likewise also the wife under her husband the wife hath no power over her own body but the husband and likewise also the husband has no power over his own body but the wife defraud you not one another accept it be consent for a time that you may give yourselves through fasting and prayer and come again uh come together again that's Satan tempt you not for your in uh con tend to I don't know how to even say that word inconsistency or something but you see he says here now don't defraud one another now that defrauding is not uh stealing money like committing uh uh you know monetary fraud but that fraud is actually an emotional withholding right because because the devil has taken the greatest uh sign of you know or the greatest act of love right we'll just say the word six okay because the devil wants to hide things under the carpet don't mention these things openly because he likes to keep it secret right so so the devil has has taken that and that was God's grass expression of love between a man and a woman and has totally destroyed it in this age and made it something that it is not at all but you see so so we don't want to look at it just as an act because the world just looks at as a pleasurable act but it's a spiritual act as well it's two coming not just two bodies coming together but but it's it's Body Spirit Soul coming together as one as a real Oneness so now what happens is is if there's a defrauding going on that that means there's actually a blockage between the that couple but the thing is what happens is like Neymar no doubt when the leprosy begin to set it and we'll come into that he would have tightened his armor up more he would have covered up more he would have been appeared more Pious in his station as a general but there was sin in his life he was trying to cover up so some people can try to appear more religious or more holy or more message whatever's tag you want to put in but they're just hiding something in them that needs to come out right so so here was you know so we don't want to so so the Apostle Paul says don't defraud one another there should be a bit of spice in life but put it that way you know it's not just to have children like yo Sarah said that hey yo Sarah said within her heart when the angel came and said you're gonna have the promised son she said will I have pleasure with my Lord again so it wasn't just to have the act of having a child actually no there's pleasure's all part of it yes right but it's not just two bodies coming together it is two people spirits Spirit soul and body connecting so it's not just an act the world has made it an act but don't don't let what they've done influence you yeah you know and then even in the world a lot of women or even men they'll withhold sex from their partner just to try and get leverage over them right that is a modern feministic idea yes don't let that Spirit come in and affect your marriage we should give ourselves because remember in a marriage just like with you and the Lord you put him above yourself right so you'll put his needs above your needs so we should put our spouse's needs above our own needs amen right there's a little bit different from the rest you know from from the meal in taranaki but hell yeah but you see but you see those things can affect the whole church so it's not just oh it's just between me and my wife or me and my husband no that'll affect the whole body because the spirit of God can't move through that family like he wants to because there's this problem but the thing is see we can be you know the greatest moment in our life should be our defining thing so if you're still in Egypt under slavery those Spirits tormenting you is what defines you right but then you come through the Red Sea and what defined as well at that point was the enemy was dead and they were free that was their defining moment right they were no longer defined by slavery they are now defined by freedom Hallelujah and then they went into the promised land so so Caleb taking his Mountain was what defined him it wasn't being a slave it wasn't the marks of the slave whips on his back the scars and the memories those did not hold them back but he got what he he wanted amen so what defined and remember we think of Caleb what do you think of Caleb no I think of give me my mountain and he got his mountain right that's what defined him so so it should be what defines us is we've met the Lord amen right so nothing of our power should influence our current state right those things are just a tormenting Spirit to try and hold us back there but we're not called to be held back there we're free indeed amen amen amen so so whatever you did in your past don't let that get in your way between your marriage right we're meant to be new people in Christ amen so amen that just came out that's kind of free but you know we're gonna we're gonna look at you know our lives affect everyone it's not just our family and things but naaman's whole life was name and secret that he was trying to manage affected the whole country it's amazing leprosy everyone knew uh leprosy it was a dreaded disease no one could no one had a cure you know they were you know anyone who got there proceed they just went to a leper colony whatever position they were in before they got leprosy did not matter when they got leprosy right so Naaman if God didn't intervene in his life he would have ended up in a leper colony and all he would have had is just a memory of being the captain of the host of Syria but that would not have defined him in the leper colony so Sinners a way of coming in right right sometimes you know many times we don't look for it but it finds us because the devil wants to try and Rob us of who we are in the Lord he wants to Rob us of our Victory and he just wants us to be fighting over something that's really nothing I mean that we can actually go to the Lord and get it eradicated out of our lives right so so we don't ever want to try and hold yo yo it's amazing when when even just natural sickness comes in we think we can manage it this is manageable you know no doubt maybe when when um you know when um Naaman first got the first spot on his hand or wherever it was he saw the leperous spot and no doubt all the emotion you know the wave of emotion would have come over him of you know the where where this is gonna take him but then he began to think it no doubt within himself but I can manage this that's not so bad you know and we've got to be very careful when things come into our lives you know we should know the spirit of God enough that when the enemy comes and we can identify him right when that when that when that real hard heaviness real you know that your spirit comes in and you feel it's wrong maybe I can't describe it very well but you know it's not God you know and the spirit of God comes as that sweetness is that love and your faith just raises and all you want to do is praise him and you love them and you love one another but then the enemy comes in as just as heaviness and unbelief and you know we should have a right in a prayer meeting or anywhere if the spirit's wrong to call a halt and say something's wrong here you know you know in Azusa Street there was a sister in those meetings that if a man stood up to preach and it was just it wasn't inspired by God she'd just stand up and say it's not inspired and she was right you say oh I don't know if we have the boldness for that kind of thing so maybe it's a bit radical but sometimes we've got to just go say hold on the spirit's not right you know and I'm not just talking about church but in our family if there's a real heaviness a real division a real you know a burdensome feeling going I said hold on something's not right here and we should we're called not to live under that kind of thing we should just go through the motion someone just starts spouting off unbelief and they'll never be free and that's not a testimony this is wrong and we should say hold on that's not how God's speaking now that is the devil speaking will not put up with us if you're going to notice separate between the person and the spirit right because many times we just go like this and we think it's the same thing it's not the same thing right so we should have a right to actually call the halt but the thing is if we're like Naaman we'll try and manage it but the reason he was trying to hide is because he didn't know there was a solution we have a bomb we have a bomb it's not made in China it's made in heaven amen it doesn't have an expiry date and it works on everything on external and internal wounds right it it works everywhere from head to toe everywhere that's the blood of our Lord Jesus Christ that is our bomb from Gilead amen so so Naaman he did not know the solution to his problem he thought well this is just where it's going to go but you know it's amazing you know brother Brown would say we are our best and our worst at home we can put on a mask we can put on a facade we can put on a good behavior when we're around other people but when we're at home it's when we really take the armor off we really let down our garter for the good and the bad so you know no doubt there was a time when the you know first spot may be formed in his hand and just like I was saying about issues in the bedroom you know there's a covering up to try and cover up soon maybe maybe no doubt you know he put his armor on more when he you know walked you know you know went out of the home maybe put on some more robes and you know it's amazing When sin comes into her life there's a distance that comes between people you know so because because he was carrying a secret and that secret actually made him live under a fear what if people find out what if what if what if one of my lieutenants and someone finds out I've got this I've got this leprosy my whole life is over my Prestige is gone my pride is gone who people think I am is gone because they're Who I Really Am is not who I really am to them because they think he's healthy strong he's in charge he's a general but here's a man with Leprosy trying to hide it and so here he was with this and yo so no doubt he would have you know become more distant from his men maybe people who are you know in his chain of command that maybe he'd eat with or whatever more he'd become more distant from them and maybe they'll think well he's just maybe more Pious than he was before he's really reached another plane and the message I tell you he's just he's just really well that third pull is gone something but no it wasn't but it wasn't that but it was dressed up like that but I was a sin he was trying to hide because he is afraid if someone found out a secret you know I'm so glad we don't have to carry leprosy I'm so glad we don't have to be spiritually sick we can be spiritually healthy strong and well all the time we can have such an immune system because the devil wants to put things on us but we don't have to own it right we are sure identified but we're going to realize that the spirit within us has already overcome that thing whatever it is right amen so now here he is he's trying to you know he's trying to hold you know hide things away but you know there comes a time when all things are exposed there Comes A Time you know you can delay it you can make it quick you know but but but to live in that time of torment and fear and worry why live through it amen why why let it pre you know why let it continue on when you can just get rid of it get rid of it from the very get-go you know there are other kinds of leprosy too another form well I mean I mean I mean a source of it right Miriam would be struck down by leprosy because she made fun of Moses you know and she made fun of Moses because because he married the Ethiopian girl but the problem is she got so caught up in his Humanity because remember Miriam was older than Moses Miriam followed Moses in the in the ark and the bull rushes you know would have helped raise him would have changed his diapers would have fed him a bottle I'll just bring it to modern terms you know would have changed him would have bath them would have got anointed him when he spat food at her face and trying to figure you know so so she saw him grow up so she became so familiar with his Humanity that when it was God speaking through him or God actually manifesting something because remember because Moses was a type of God even even God's hidden you be God to the people Moses will be your Prophet so his actions were actually manifesting what God did so he took a gentile bride because all Christ types in the Bible take a gentile broke right there pointing to you and the Lord right so so he was actually acting out Redemption yeah but but because because she was so caught up in Moses Humanity she thought there's the foolish thing and made fun of it so we're going to be very careful that we don't get too common with one another that when God speaks we actually think it's just that that person and pride puts up a wall and we miss what God's doing and what could actually happen sin can come into our lives because we don't accept what God is trying to say to us because of the vessel that it's coming through I'm not just talking about people who stand behind the pulpit but talk about Justin Fellowship you're going to be able to differentiate is that God or is that or is that the person now if you're full of Pride you'll just say it's the person but you should take it on board don't just don't just bat it away take it on board think about it yes yes because it may be God trying to get your attention about something so Miriam would get leprosy because she got caught up in Moses Humanity when he was acting out he was foreshadowing Redemption for us so let's not let's not let ourselves get too common in that way that when God speaks we just say you know it's them because that's just carnal Pride we don't want to be like that so it wasn't really knowing back in those days how leprosy was transmitted that's why they're putting a leper colony now aren't you glad that we had a prophet stand in this day and he'd say Sinner's not drinking sin is not adultery Sinner's not lying or swearing or cheating or sin is not those things sin is unbelief so Malachi 4 stood in this generation to actually tell you this is what leprosy really is this is how it's transmitted its unbelief comes into a person's life right and then it manifests leprosy right because leprosy I think it's a bacteria or something so it's not even a you know it's something you can't even see with your eye right that's why but that's why he gave a special microscope to diagnose viruses that's the same thing we had a set of eyes come in this generation brother Branch here I'm standing in Two Worlds he can see the Eternal and he can see right now that's why he could say look I'm looking at you 40 years ago this happened you know because he's standing in Two Worlds so he had a set of eyes that could look beyond our natural sight so the same thing with sin he could look beyond the natural and say no no you got to go further you're not looking at it right yeah yeah leprosy is sin or sin is unbelief that's how it's transmitted so unbelief comes in pain comes in complex comes in whatever it is remember it's a bruised cell in our spirit that the devil wants to work through right so and it can be an insecurity yes yes right it can be it can be it can be Pride it can be we get we we compare ourselves with ourselves carnally I'm better that my family's better than your family my dad's bigger than your dad kind of mentality you know when you're young my dad can beat up your dad or my uncles are bigger than your uncle so you know but but you bring that into the spiritual level people say well I'm glad my family's not like that family well my family's not like that how do you know you know you've got to be very careful that you don't stand in that judgment seat right because what they're going through you should get 10 times worse yes and with a religious Pride you'll never go and dip in the Jordan to get what you need because remember the manifestation of especially the wife is actually the condition of the Father's Heart the husband's heart is manifested in the wife right so because remember brother Brown preached a sermon is your life worthy of the Gospel he did not say is your wife worthy of the Gospel he never said that but people have taken that condition because brother M says well the woman types the church so you better line up because if you're not lined up people will think that we're not lined up and but it's just actually problem in the husband is manifested in the family right that doesn't mean children will not go away with so on and not saying that but you know there's a manifestation what's going on here isn't there right so we got to be real [Music] uh we're gonna look at ourselves right and say you know am I in my position because the greater position you get into the more surrender it takes to get there the more remember Jesus sure he came to the Jordan he was baptized right Jordan is a death to self but then his final act before he went to Calvary is he had to say Lord not my will but thy will be done so he had to have a death in Gethsemane to go to Calvary I remember Calvary the death Resurrection was the greatest manifestation of his ministry that was the reason he was there right he wasn't just there to heal the sick race he did have power over nature he demonstrated all those things to say this is what a redeemed son does everything Adam lost Jesus manifested amen right and so everything that Adam lost was he lost perfect fellowship with God perfect one with Oneness with God he lost eternal life and he lost Dominion over this earth right and then so now brother bam says when when the lamb takes the book he redeems us back to everything that Adam lost he says now this and the Sevenfold book of seals of redemption that lamb took within himself the only one who could do it he took it from the right hand of him that sat upon the throne now the claim his redempted to claim his rights to claim for you and me what he redeemed us from to see back to everything that Adam Lost In the Garden of Eden he redeemed us back to that amen now with the Lamb with the book in his hands we are ready to ask his grace and mercy upon us to open the seven seal book to us and to let us look past the curtain of time to me it was astounding he tied those two things together he has opened the book and he has let us look past the curtain a tongue that's why the Holy Ghost gets off the the word gets a hold of Our Lives actually showing because that's him and getting a hold of you and that's actually giving you sight there's a lamby on the river you've got a body Over Yonder wait we got a father Over Yonder Hallelujah it actually reveals you that this is not your final destination you're going there so he so so everything Adam lost has been now restored to us right we're not waiting for it to come it's not coming we're not tracking tracking the package coming on our phones right we're not looking where is it what Depot is it you know what church has messenger has got it where is it no it's here right it's been coming to the seventh age messenger now it's now it's here right so so now the word restores this fact a perfect Oneness with God and to me that's not just with God that should be with your spouse amen right because the manifestation of Oneness is is sure it's here but it comes out here yes right so so the relationship you have with God is manifested in the race if you have with your family yeah and with one another because by this shall all men know your my disciples because you love have one love one for another amen right so so there should be a manifestation of that Oneness this way because it's this way yes yes right so so he so so he's so we have so Adam he so so so Adam he lost perfect one's Oneness with God and his wife eternal life and Dominion but God has restored all those things to us amen so that's why it's so vitally important to realize that and if you do not have perfect Oneness or Dominion United overcoming power in your life he said Lord what are you trying to show me because he wants to take us higher that's why he allows trials to come into our life wants to take us higher right are we all together okay I hope this is here we are I don't know if this is a chili burger or what but this is oh well this is where we are right so you so we need to look at the see Naaman Naaman When sin came into his life he thought he could manage it and it just made him distant from his from his family made him distant from his men because he was trying to appear more separated and Pious now because we're springing to religious terms right he's trying to look more Sanctified but really he was hiding a secret and that was because he was afraid that the people would find out and he would be had to go to a leper colony you know it takes see the thing is that people if we if we have a plan B in life we we won't meet the Lord if you have a plan B yes you won't meet the Lord that's right Simon the Sorcerer one of the Holy ghosts to further his former life because he used to sell potions they considered him a man of God and in Samaria right and then so Peter comes along lays hands upon the people receives the holy ghost that says Simon went got baptized joined the church was a Believer saying praise the Lord but he says how can I get this and he saw that whatever wasn't working so he said to Peter can I give you money then it seems like I'm praying but nothing's happening so can I just give you money for this because I got money and then Simon says no there's iniquity in your heart that's why you have not received the Holy Ghost yet because he was wanting to take that because his motive of receiving it was to use it for his former to to further his former life he wasn't willing to die to what he was just like the Rich Young Ruler he loved his identity was in his was in his money it wasn't actually in the law because if he was sincerely just following God because he says look I've kept these Commandments I've done all this so it looks like his sincerity was all wrapped up in that being a good message believer but the problem is actually his identity wasn't wrapped up in that it was wrapped up in his money right and that's why he wasn't willing to let that go oh hello yes so we can't have plan B see the good thing about naming is he didn't have a plan B he didn't have a plan B he only had one plan amen right and it's got to be the same with us we're going to realize it's it it's Christ or nothing I'd rather take him but the thing is see the devil loves to be carried around he's like not not you know he's like a he's just like something that literally wants to be on your shoulder and control your life you know and he wants to be protected he wants us to be his stronghold he wants us to protect them and to and to explain why he's there you know he will give us all the reasons Under the Sun why sin is ruling our life he will give us all the reasons why but really we should say well hold on why is this thing governing me I'm sick of this guy amen but if you love him if you have any kind of positive feelings towards sin or whatever you used to be you'll never be free of it because that's like like chains that hold them to you but if you really hate him he's gone if you're really getting sick and tired of sick and tired of why am I not getting it or why am I stuck why is this if you really get sick of that and identify the thing I'm sick of this thing holding me back then you can be free but if you love the thing if you say no this is who I am well that's who you'll be but I'm so glad that this is not a place just to stay who we were let's go higher on the Lord let's get more of him let's become more like him every day we shouldn't just sit back and say well I'm just I've always been this way Moses was a backslin prophet for 80 years yeah I don't think we have any 80 year olds here but he was in that condition for a very long time and and he he actually thought this is just this is who I am I'm a shepherd on the back side of the desert I've got this high-tempered wife and this is just how it's going to be the reason that was that way is because God had to mold him because he was out of his position right because when when he really came into his office then he would have to deal with those kind of things on a big scale yeah so God was actually using it remember everything in life is God's agent if you can't identify it as God's agent then you'll get frustrated and you get annoyed at God and people are not surrendered to God get angry at God but if you're really surrendered to God that's a good sign to know you've actually sold out is that whatever you go through in life you just love him you don't get frustrated and angry yo you say Lord this is your will for my life you know what I need praise the Lord amen hallelujah my path is different to someone else's path but hey praise God you're taking me through hey man so we could just race to that but you see see he so so he was he was that backslin Prophet for 80 years but then God called him maybe he thought well this is just he got really used to where he would take the sheep in different seasons he had 40 years in Midian to do it he got really used to how it worked season after season Time After Time well it's it's this time whatever month we go here we go there he got used to that going through the motions while we're having camp in October let's go to camp and shout and then we come back well there's Christmas coming up we're gonna go here for Christmas and this is gonna go on but you know sure but we should just get caught up in well that's just how life is going to be we can have all of that routine but then God can live in power in that routine amen right Hallelujah see but he was out he he just thought of yo here's a man who God said you're going to be God to the people and he was just happy with just being a shepherd on the back side of the desert out of his position praise the Lord but you see when God spoke to him then that was it yeah so we can't get into a point where I would say well this is just how I'm going to be because this is how I've always been no God's God God God God's a change maker amen he brings change he wants his change in our lives not our own change amen amen we may get in a real real you know people who can get comfortable in complaining yeah making it comfortable in trouble they're not happy unless there's trouble I've seen people Believers not in this country but you know they get they're only happy when there's trouble they are only happy when their husband is down or their wife is up down or whatever but when they're doing good now they're unhappy because they're used to living in that kind of a way that is not our ordained position we are not called to live in that kind of way where it's only trouble makes us happy no peace and joy and love and the Holy Ghost should make us happy we should be happy when our family's doing happy we should be happy when the church is doing happy we should be happy when we we hear of some believer in the back of Mozambique somewhere meets the Lord we should be so happy because that's part of the body just like us you know so but so we should not be happy when there's only if you're happy just because there's drama you need to change where your happiness Lays but we can just get so caught up in that but because we people identify with that Spirit then they say this is me but if they really hate that then they can be free right so so we don't want to have a plan B we never want to have a plan B so here comes Naaman he is compensating for his leprosy but then like any any Senate comes out eventually it can be 40 years it can be two minutes it can be however long but it'll come out in its season What's Done in secret will be broadcast to the world right but the thing is we think when we first when the devil gives us a bit when that first spot strikes our life we think we can manage this this is really not that bad surely would have been a great shot come over naaman's face when he saw that first spot on his hand wherever it was he thought I can cover this up this is fine he goes out of the bathroom goes out to the kitchen wherever or wherever his wife is how you doing honey just fine he's got leprosy he's got trouble right and the more we cover up the more distant we can come from everyone yet yet with the same quotes you know the same armor on right right but it's when you take the armor off see what we are at home is really Who We Are Who We Are by ourselves is who we are really we can be one thing to you know we can be many things to many people but who you are alone is who you are yeah really so Naaman when he was all alone all he could see was leprosy now it's amazing that that that his servant girl you think about this she she would be living with her captives uh cap girls rather the ones who took her captive she lived with she served them the ones that ripped her from her family at a young age the ones who brought trauma and pain into her life she was living with now don't you think it would have been really the because Israel was eye for an eye tooth for a tooth or if we just take it into our language they deserve it you know there's there's a Revenge spirit in this country oh yes that that person deserves that oh that's that's Karma you know they deserve that yeah and so not that we believe in karma here we know right reap what you say all those things it's a scripture principle perverted right right but the thing is she could have thought well this he shouldn't have done that he deserves this because look what he's done to my people look what he's done to me I'll never see my parents again I'll never be in my happy little home again but there was something within her because when she how she was raised and how she saw the prophet of God operate in Israel she knew nothing was impossible with God Amen she was born under that kind of Supernatural atmosphere where she saw that God could do anything remember up to that stage there was no case of lepers he had ever been healed that was a hundred percent fatality or mortality whatever rate 100 percent statistically had never been done before but then she just cried out oh I wish to God that my Lord was there in Israel with the prophet of God and that Prophet would make him well and what an incredible thing to reveal the source of Deliverance to a people that are oppressing you isn't that incredible you know because they were they made her do mean things you know that yo clean this go here do this get up now yo her life was not her own and she could have lived just with the with the with the thought of a lost childhood and a lost family in the what could have been of life but she she Rose above that amen Amen to actually give give Naaman her own Master a source of deliver these Source the only source in the whole world of of Deliverance Hallelujah amen so she so she could you know she cried that out and you know it's amazing they actually listened to what she had to say he was a servant girl and really they you know normally well back in those days it it is said today but not outwardly they'd say our God is greater than your God that's why we conquered you our God gave us Victor over your God and so they could have thought oh this Hebrew God's nothing because look we are we are invading their country we're taking them captive but but there would have been such an atmosphere around that little girl we've got to be careful that we don't just ignore what our children say to us that's right God can step into a body yes and speak a word yeah it can be this big yes we're gonna be we're gonna be quite sensitive where did that come from it can be out of the mouth of babes the work can come they might not even be aware of what they're saying that's right and so she said this and then it so moved them they you know they listened to what and they said hey we've got to write a king I mean we're going to go to the king of Syria to get him to write to the king of Israel to to get this all arranged so you see from with Naaman is is he was living under a different kind of atmosphere it wasn't a supernatural atmosphere and brother Brown says there are so many voices this is what really sparked this a few weeks back he says there's so many voices on the earth in the Earth today that um he says there's so many voices in the Earth today that are absolutely it's absolutely a hard thing because it deadens the voice of the supernatural there's so many intellectual voices great voices of mighty men who are intellectual at their own intellectual conditions can even Shake Nations they're just not overnight people but they Shake Nations bringing great organizations together great campaigns flowery and a person can be a little bit confused it's enough to confuse them of how that these things can go on and prosper and there's voices that raise up and do these things and it causes the voice of God to be played way back somewhere the true voice of God so in other words it says it makes the voice of God become background noise the supernatural voice of God where God can come in and speak directly to you you can be listening to a message he's listening to a song you'll be hearing preaching and the supernatural voice of God can come in and speak directly to your life see we're gonna or he can just put it in your heart I don't like that I don't want to do that I don't want you to do that anymore this doesn't please me that's a super let's see it's more than just a voice see the supernatural voice of God guides our steps should do right that we shouldn't be led by our own carnal understanding but God should direct our steps I remember when I became a a few years ago now but but I just became a new Christian just met the Lord and I was going to a um going to a youth camp there down in Christchurch and and I had to get the money out to pay for the fees and so I was at Uni and and there were two ATMs on campus one was right by what used to be me be my favorite Pub before I got delivered to that Spirit of alcohol and the other one was on the other side of Campus so I went to the one on the other side of campus and it was on a Thursday night or some night where where that Pub Ebon was there because I wasn't there because I got set free but so I went to this ATM that was far away from it but it was out of order so I said well I'll go to the one right by the pub store just to get the money and I went around these buildings and these trees that were blocking the noise the music from the place and as soon as I went around past there and I heard the noise of it the Lord spoke in my heart said he said I don't want to go there he didn't even say you don't want to go there he says I don't want to go there so I didn't get the money out there but you see there are places where God likes he doesn't like to go and we should be sent to it no we shouldn't be living in fear Lord is this pleasing or not no just just be surrender to him he'll guide your steps we can rest in his leadership I trust you can right but there's places he doesn't like and places he likes so we should be sensitive to those things so so Naaman was not sensitive of those cards thanks for the never been in that kind of atmosphere so he was still operating in a political idea and he says well I'm the I'm the general of Sirius I'll get my king to write to their King because that's the Diplomatic channels that I'm used to that's the way I'm used to being you know you're dealing with you know like the Queen's funeral you know the yeah the royal family doesn't just come and sit with everyone well everyone doesn't sit with a royal family you know there's certain places where there you know there's hierarchy where people sit in different things and you know with the ceremonies and the funeral and you know where they sit in the chapel and different things they don't just walk in the front door and find a seat you know and and not everyone can just approach them there's different hierarchies they're normally you know different leaders will speak to different leaders on the same level if it's a very important Summit it's the presidents of countries will speak it's not just some Deputy foreign minister of or some minister of some you know thing that's not related to what they're talking about will come and speak to the president of that country they'll feel it offended say this is an important this is an important Summit why are you sending this Lackey this guy just came out of Diplomatic School right you know surely if this is important to you you come yourself this is how neyman was used to operating so so that's why he went to the king of Syria the king of Syria wrote the letter and then and then he sent it to the king of Israel and then the king of Israel because he he is blinded to the supernatural himself he just rents his clothes and say oh my God that I can heal this person can I really do this he's just trying to pick a fight with me he was caught we we must never get caught up in this kind of thinking yeah just a political well this is our church goes and this is this and you know natural carnal thinking yeah right I hope that's not too vague but you know we shouldn't be we shouldn't be caught up in those kind of things we should always have a spiritual mindset yes why would you be thinking spiritually that God can come upon the scene and help right so be because of the king of Israel really knew what he had in his land he would have never just rented his clothes say this is just the king of Syria wanting to fight me no actually hold on I know the man who knows Jehovah God and he can he can he can speak and he can make him well so so rents is closed but then Elisha heard what the king of Israel had done now it's amazing name and up to this point he's had to expose his secret he's hidden it for so long but when he goes to the king says I've got leprosy his whole Secret's exposed by just exposing the Secret's not enough you got to get you you got to dip yeah man you got to go to God's provided place and get liberated because some people say well I've done enough no no have you been changed yet have the spots gone have you actually prayed through have you actually surrendered it at all because your brother around preaches so much about the doors within a door speaking of the heart yes and there's the private life he says you know people say you better not middle in there preacher that's my own private life but Jesus wants to go in there he doesn't just want to come in the front door as Savior and then that's it all right he wants to he wants to go through the whole house and if he wants to renovate the whole house amen if the Australian team said Lord is this color right on the wall does that painting really work there there's really that hobby really match what you are does it really can I really identify as a Believer when I do those things right and then if you still have a bit of Pride that you'll say no you can sit there you can have a biscuit don't come any further but if you're really surrender to him you say Lord you can renovate my whole house and and I and I trust that's our hearts desire right whatever things that we hold so dear are we willing to give those things to him I trust we are today amen so the king of Israel went his clothes he's a little upset thinking there's a fight that's gonna you know he's basically in his mind preparing for war and then and then Elisha sends to the king you know bring him here and then so here comes Naaman he brings all this gold and different things to pay for this and it comes No Doubt with many men around him because here's the general he doesn't drive his own car no no you know he's in the back someone's chauffeuring him so someone's driving The Chariot he's in the back and this trumpeters and his banners and all kinds of pump going on because Here Comes Damon but he's a leper but in his pride he thinks he's still something he thinks he's something but he's nothing oh amen right and when we get to that point where we realize actually we're not something the Lord is everything will it come humbly to our god right we can't come say well I've got something to give you God you should be you should appreciate that I've I've come to surrender my life that's not how it works God is not a respecter of persons amen so here comes Damon and then he comes to the prophet's house no doubt he's expecting in his mind some diplomatic group to welcome him and there'll be ceremonial speeches if we're so happy Damon that you're here in our country and you've heard our God is real and we're under expectation you'll be healed and different priests stand up and they give their little five minute little sermonette and different things and you know gifts exchange and let's play what he's expecting But Here Comes the guy out the front door and some common ropes and he's just a servant of the prophet and he says go dip in the Jordan seven times that made the Bible says that so so Caesar and second Kings uh five and ten and Elisha went sent a messenger onto him saying go and wash in the Jordan seven times and thy flesh shall come to thee uh come again to thee and thou shall be clean now you would think that a man would just say okay I'll go do that but you see this guy's a message believer he he's got a station in the church he's got an office in the church he's been there a long time they've won a lot of Victories as Believers because he's been there they've won a lot of Victories right God's been moving yeah but then because he's got the sin in his life see we've got to be willing to actually lay aside what people think of us we're gonna link to lay it aside not just say but I'm this person no no don't worry about that amen leprosy needs to be cleansed right sin's got to be dealt with and then so Naaman wasn't leaping for joy then he's Yo Daddy was told just go dipping the Jordan seven times he says and Naaman was rough and he went away and said behold I thought he would surely come out to me and stand and call him the name of his God and strike his hands over the place and recover the leper so he had in his mind this is how God's gonna do it and how many times we go to God In Prayer in our mind knowing how God's going to answer you know we already have in our mind well God you can do it this way and God says no I'm not going to do it your way amen I'm gonna do it when you're in condition for it to happen when you come to the point where you're ready for the miracle to happen that you don't say I prayed and this happened take us many times we can go to God expecting a testimony because we want to be associated with the testimony but actually all of our testimonies are his testimony right it's not our testimony my brother Adam said about when the pillar fire came down on the Ohio River he says I was just there when he came down that was his attitude towards the whole thing he says I was just there when he came down yeah so it wasn't I was in the river and this happened and then God you know God no he said I was just there when it happened you know it should be the same thing with us well what happened there well I was just there and he did that you know it wasn't anything I did really it's just he what he wanted to do man so he went away Roth and then he even went away because he began to compare Rivers well this church is better than that church oh this message really isn't we got a better movement Christian Movement out in the world yeah he's saying that the rivers of Damascus were better than the one of Jordan you mean this muddy thing this muddy thing you could never put it on a postcard we've got way better Rivers Where We Are but in his country there was no God that could heal there was no God that could clear celebrity they had all the form all the temples everything they had they had all the doctrine but no power and their God to heal and so so you know but he was getting mad so he got rough and he actually drove away in a rage it says in in chapter 12. it's not Maddie got he wasn't just upset or even you know in a bit of disbelief saying I didn't know it would happen this way he got mad at how many times do we get angry at the very word that gives us instruction to be free because of pride even though we know all the quotes know how it all goes together he gets provided away we can When God Says just give it to me just actually surrender it you don't have to hold on to this anymore it's actually quite easy look and live believe on the Lord Jesus Christ don't know the house shall be saved amen you know there's actually you can be free of this but he went away in a rage now as he's speeding down the motorway in his religious rage maybe having one of the messages blow you know the prophet blasting in his ears whatever servants catches up with him and says hold on oh great name and live forever maybe the servants are thinking this guy's ridiculous what he's doing is not even making logical sense he's come all the way to get the answer the answer's been given to him and he won't even take the answer that doesn't make that doesn't make logical sense you know if neyman could just get himself out of the situation and look at it for what it was he'd think that goes crazy to go away in a reach and sometimes we're going to really look at a situation get ourselves out of it then we can see it clearly right but our own Humanity blinds us to really the way we should take because we're in it but if you actually take the same variables the same scenario but take yourself out of it you'd give yourself most of the time speaking to myself to totally different answer to if you're actually in it because there's the eyes taken out right so so his servant would come to say surely if there wasn't surely if the prophet gave you a hard thing to do wouldn't have you done it they really begin to think yes that's true and as rage begin to subside and then he goes to the Jordan and now God knows how to get rid of all of our Prestige he knows how to get rid of all of our pride amen he knows how to get rid of all of what we think we are for him to step on the sink see there's a problem in this day this is a day of people's rights so we we think we have a right to be angry we have a right to hold something against someone we have a right to to to put up a wall against someone or not forgive some web rights but brother says we're sheep we give we forfeit our rights maybe as a person you have a right to hold grudges but as a Christian you do not you don't right or maybe you have a right to hold something you're passed against yourself even as a person short but as a Christian you don't you don't have that right we give up all of our rights amen hey man wait wait forfeit remember true forgiveness really is when you actually surrender the right to hold that thing against that person that's when you really forgive when you actually surrender that right to hold it against them yeah right because we say oh we forgive but hold on Is that real forgiveness or is that just words coming out of our mouth because we've been taught that way right we've got to have a real we really forgive we surrender the right to hold it against them but they did this um our sin made Jesus go to Calvary we did that to him what did he do to us what has he done to us as being bad not one thing my Jesus has never never done anything but religion has done bad things but Jesus is not religion that's right our lord Jesus is not religion right so so we think here but this person did this I'm going to treat them this way we were his enemy and he went to Calvary for us right he conquered hell death in the grave for you and I he didn't do it for himself he did it for you yes right so if he did that for us I'm sure we can we can actually give over the right to hold something else against someone so here Here Comes Damon he comes in his chair it comes by the Jordan it's real money that time of year he knows how to make it uncomfortable there's no nice little pool there where it's all clear and nice no it's a muddy because God knows how to get rid of our Prestige and then so he takes him there and maybe his heart sinks and says oh do I really have to and his servant says seven times seven times because they believe what the prophet said right they believe what the prophet said that's right and then so he rolls up as takes off his shoes maybe takes off his best vest I don't know and because it tipped onto the muddy Jordan and he because I feel the mud come between his toes baby steps in some oxygen weed and you know all those things and you know he's like oh what am I doing here but if he could just see what's going to happen sometimes we get prayer or we go through something and we're just so caught up in the moment of the what we need to do we kind of Miss what we're going to go get yeah you know and then so he goes into the Jordan and it's icy cold shaking shivering all those men are watching he goes down once he feels the same well that didn't work what's the point but then the servant said six more times and no doubt the servant that would have said that would have been the one he told to do the most God knows how to turn everything on its head to get rid of our pride he knows how to do it yes and then so he dips still the same he goes again but then as he's dipping his pride and is what he thinks he is his Persona his position herself just washes away and he now surrenders he now surrenders to God's provided way Hallelujah and that's how we're going to be God says just give it up come unto me all ye that labor I'll give you rest you know give to me your sin you shouldn't you don't need to be on drugs to be happy you know you don't need to be on some substance or living in a fantasy world reading books of just some fantasy romance or something and living in some other way come unto me amen amen you don't have to live a different way come unto me you don't have to live with that pain come to me I'll take it from you you know and then he goes down the sixth he goes down the seventh time and he comes back up and then he hears a different kind of response from the bank no doubt they begin to shout hallelujah all right we're gonna shout when God does something and he's a look at his hands and looks he says all the leprosy is gone Hallelujah so finally show his PR his pride went for the lepers he went amen so he could Now put on the same armor amen he could now not have a distance between his fellow Brethren anymore or his family he went back totally restored Hallelujah it should be the same thing with you and I there's water there's there's a water of the word we can dip into this morning that can take all anxiety all torment all pain all sorrow all whatever it may be all Pride God can take it from us if we're willing to Humble ourselves and say Lord yeah it cleans me a lot hallelujah hallelujah and then he went after that he went back to the prophet and and and and the prophet wouldn't take money because we know God yeah that's not how it works you don't buy a miracle yeah yeah right but then he says can I have some Earth so that I can take back and I can you know I you know I can worship there he says even forgive me this but I'm gonna when I go back I'm gonna go to the house of my you know the god there because the king leans on my arm when we worship imagine that going to a temple the king actually holds the hand of a man that that God they're bowing to could not could not heal think about that they go back into that Temple you go read it they go back into the temple the king holds his hand as they worship no doubt they bow and they hear the priests say how great this God is but they both know that God can do what just happened Hallelujah it should be the same thing with you and I people think oh everything's so great but where's the power of God where's the power of God in the word because we live in a time where the Holy Ghost has been released without measure I mean there's no creases no Darkness there's nothing that can hold him back in this hour he's been brother man says the end time message releases the Holy Ghost upon the people where this word has restored us back to a true Pentecost back to an indwelling of the Holy Ghost and the people where that holy spirit of God that comes within us has the power to cleanse us from all leprosy to cleanse a small complexes all trouble there's not nothing too hard for God that we cannot be delivered from amen hallelujah believe you so I'm just gonna leave it with that because I I'm I'm dead sure there's nothing too hard for our God yeah but if we if we're with it give all your money to the poor take up your cross and follow me yes I'm so glad to do that is that all I have [Music] I don't know but the thing is because his identity was so wrapped up in it and the devil said you can't give that up what will people think of you Naaman had to come to a point because no doubt that would have crossed his mind when he saw the leprosy what are people going to think of me now but he had to be willing to go beyond that for the sake of himself and his marriage and his family all these things he had to go beyond that but then also to follow the instructions of the word to get washed so what a so what are what are you holding on to yeah I trust it's him not not not some hobby or something you just do in secret right what are you wrapped up amen Our God I believe we have a water we have a place we can dip into into the spirit of God and be cleansed from anything amen amen I am I'm I believe it so I asked you the question this morning do you need a wash do you need a wash if you do you can come dip amen we have God's provided away as holy spirit's hear the words here that he can cleanse you from anything but let him take your pride and all those things because remember when you go back home if you still got leprosy you still got leprosy why live with it for another day why not go home cleansed knowing that our God delivered that leprosy does not define you but God's Deliverance defines you Hallelujah let's have the musicians this morning I'm just going to leave it there now God is able amen I'm so glad there's a water we can wash from Hallelujah praise the Lord hey man we don't know that song is a fountain open in the House of David do we I don't think we do no that's okay I mean let's stand amen let's sing that song out it's a bit of a fast one but let's sing that song there's power in the blood there's power in the blood of the Lamb Hallelujah amen hallelujah I mean
