School on Zoom for the girls to watch to appreciate that thank you yeah thank you very much amen praise the Lord um we're gonna go to uh Matthew 11 this morning and we're going to read the last three verses of Matthew 11 then we're going to go to Second Timothy 3. uh so Matthew 11 and from verse 27 here and it's great to have Oma and Omar Omar with us God bless you welcome amen amen praise the lord always good to see you amen uh so we have Matthew 11 27 and down to verse 30. he says all things are delivered unto me of my father and no man not the son but the father neither uh knoweth any man the father save the son and he to whomsoever the son will reveal him a man takes Revelation to know God he says come unto me all ye that labor and a heavy laden and I'll give you rest take my yoke upon you and learn of me for I am meek and lowly in heart and you shall find rest unto your souls for my yoke is easy and my burden is light amen praise the Lord and then we're going to go to Second Timothy quite a contrasting scripture here but um I pray that the Lord will tie this together II Timothy 3 and 1. I'm going to read just down to verse 5. we could continue on but I just want to take the first five five verses here this morning so he says now know this also then the last days perilous times shall come and we're living in the last days for men shall be lovers of their own selves Covetous boasters proud blasphemers disobedient appearance unthankful Unholy without natural affection truth truth Breakers false accusers incontinent Fierce despise of those that are good traitors heady high-minded lovers of pleasure more than lovers of God having a form of godliness but denying the power of from such turn away my what a description amen let's just bow heads in the word of prayer this morning you want to be a room in a prayer you want to raise your hand to the Lord amen let's just let's pray together shall we gracious Lord we want to thank you we can come before you Lord we want to just declare that you are our King Lord You're our Lord you are savior you are everything dear God and Lord we want to live a life Lord to to to honor you Lord that's pleasing in thy sight not that we would want to try and earn anything Lord be no salvation is a free gift Lord You Paid It all that down Calvary but Lord but out of response of what you've done for us Lord we want to live a life to praise you and give you honor and Glory because we love you and we want to ask Lord as we've read your word this morning I pray Lord that there be such a move of the Holy Ghost this morning may he touch every life father may may all unbelief be Cast Away Lord May every Spirit contrary to you be bound in the name of Jesus Christ and may he have free course in our lives oh God minister to our hearts changes mold us oh god father even the Lord our blind spots in our lives may he take those away as well oh God and Father we just want to commit Our Lives into your hands we thank you dear God that uh Lord those who are sick in body they can still be part of the service law because of the streaming so Lord I pray you'd be with them Lord may you touch my family and heal them Father the girls and Lord anyone else who's unwell today I pray you'd be their portion Lord thank you that by your stripes they they are healed Lord we want to thank you we can claim your bloodstains oh God for not just for salvation but for healing of the body and may there be healing of the spirit too oh God as well and may may be with everyone dear Lord we commit Our Lives into your hands in Jesus Christ's name amen amen God bless you friends you may have your seats this morning I want to talk about um you know Dave and um Ben visited me last night and they said so what are you what are you preaching on tomorrow is your pride so we're going to talk about Pride today you know it's amazing how you know we read a couple of very contrasting scriptures there it seemed to be that one is describing the uh the people in the end time and and it's very opposite to what the Lord is saying to say come unto me all ye that uh labored heavy laid and I'll give you a rest take my yoke upon you Lord of me from meek and meek and lowly in heart you shall find rest for your soul so you know there's there's there's one group because of the spirit of the world they are proud blasphemers despise those that are good we you know read the description and I pray we don't fall into that category at all because it says having a formal of godliness but denying the power thereof you know lovers of pleasure more than lovers of God so these people believe in something they have some kind of Faith or religion you can say they're Christian whatever more so we don't want to fall into that kind of bracket you know we want to we don't want Pride to govern Our Lives now um uh uh brother Bram sees this and and and it was so Blissful you know I just put this message on and uh this is from Christianity versus idolatry and and he says now he says now in studying in the early history of the church he said broadbeans and hazeltines and many of their comments on it and I see and fathers and yesterday I just wound up with the complete life of Saint Martin that the Catholic Church refused to canonize God did that um of his great life and how that the same signs and wonders followed that man right down through his life how he raised two people from the Dead cast out evil spirit spoken unknown tongues seen visions and things and what a great man but yet in the very secret of his power was in humility before God and we find today that the church yet teaching its power and teaching the signs to follow the believer we find them puffed out beg me little you and that uh and that isn't like the early church you see they were humble they were kind to one another sweet and understanding and it was so and it's so different today and I wonder if a lot of this hasn't sidetracked us from the real kernel of the message that we want to Humble ourselves keep keep yourself the more humbly you can be the greater God will use you amen so brother Bram saying you know he wasn't saying the message wasn't there he wasn't saying that they didn't have it but he's wondering if all these things hadn't sidetracked them from the real Colonel of it and the colonel is actually the seed part it's actually where you know the seed is the kernel and you know the colonel is the you know where the life is you know where where the DNA of the plant is where everything that will ever grow from that plant is in that DNA it's the Life part of it so you know you know it's like the kernel is the grain or the seed it produces the life it's got life within it it has the DNA in it which can produce so when he's saying that you know it hasn't sidetracked us from the real kernel of the message he's asking the question where is come let's just pray this morning shall we gracious father we just come before you this morning morning Lord see Sister Martin Lawrence just collapse there dear God I pray father you touch your body father I pray Lord whatever's going on there Lord I just pray father you restore her to perfect health oh God we commit her into your hands Lord we thank you for your healing touch Lord in Jesus Christ amen amen amen so we see so so he so he's asking the question have a lot of things not sidetracked us from the kernel of the message where where the life can be produced and that Colonel is having humility with God to being able to Humble ourselves to the word of God because Jesus said I am meek and lowly I am humble so you've got to be in the same humbleness as he is Amen to be joined with him see it's got to be you know see see we can know the message we can know the Bible from from cover to cover and the you know the concordances and everything and know the doctrine just right and the church children how is your dress and conduct ourselves but yet be sidetracked from the part that will produce the life that's in the word and we want the life and the word don't we how's everyone today everyone everyone's here hello good morning welcome Hey man so you know we want to see the life live not just be you know we know the message is not just the Bible's not just something to argue about it's it's it's it's that God would put on flesh in our lives right the word would become material in us so now so he's asking that question have you know have we really been sidetracked and and I pray to God we have not been sidetracked from the kernel of the message amen that we want to Humble ourselves and all the Lord Jesus will live through us that he will manifest his word through US amen because now but yeah I'll say this now just because you know Salvation if I put it this way just because you may not be yoked with the Lord that his power doesn't manifest through you doesn't mean that you're not saved right see there's salvation but then there's living a Victorious Life and if we want to live a Victorious Life we've got to stay yoked with the Lord Jesus Christ now if you have the baptism of the Holy Ghost you are yoked with him right you are yoga with them but you've got to surrender yourself to him lay aside everything that you can be yoked to him because when he talks about a yoke it's not like he just has a yoke and he puts it on your shoulders then walks off like it's some heavy thing that bears you down and now you've got to carry this heavy big weight and you know no no the yoke is like too oxen pulling together well he's actually saying join up with me connect with me amen that it's not just now you walking around with some Grievous weight on your shoulders no he says his burden is light his yoke is easy so so that yoki's talking about is actually when it's like two oxen that are that are pulling together now in that team of oxen one is always stronger than the other one's always the lead Ox right so he's got to be the lead Ox in your life well if you're yoked with him he's gonna be okay we're turning here now we're turning okay we're plowing here now we're plowing now we're going here okay okay we're going here Lord yo it's going to be that kind of a life Lord wherever you go I'll follow all right man because you're going right with me you're not going to leave me alone amen amen you're right with me so you know because it is possible now this may be dwelling on the negative a bit uh you know yo but it says in Ephesians 4 and 30 grieve not the holy spirit of God whereby you're sealed into the day of redemption so it's possible that we can grief his Spirit Away by our conduct things we say the things we do we get carnal and and that does not mean we become unsaved but what happens is that the Holy Ghost is because he's like a dove flies up into the rafters waiting for us to repent then he comes back again because our Nature's got to match his nature righteous like brother bran would say in the you know the message of church and its condition speaking of when the Lord Jesus was baptized and the spirit of God descended upon him like a dove and you know you know and he brings out so simply that the Lord Jesus had the same nature as a dove because like nature comes to like nature he says if if the Lord had a nature of a wolf then the spirit of God would never come and Abode upon him like that see it's the same thing with us we're going to have that lamb nature because allow your spirit a nature of a dove and a lamb are very similar very timid kind of creatures they're not mean and vicious and cruel they're not those kind of creatures they're meek and lowly and so if we want the Lord to abide in our lives we need his nature not the nature we're born with but his nature amen and so you know even like you know because we can grieve him you know so so that word grieve it means to passively to be sad we can make the Lord sad remember he's not an emotionless being he has emotion he has feeling right he's going to be rejoicing more than us I think when we get on the other side because now his he has his bride that he's loved the apple of his eye is now with him for eternity he's going to be rejoicing Hallelujah amen just like we're going to be rejoicing but I think he's going to be happier than us amen because what was in his mind is now made flesh in front of him praise the Lord the same thing when he looks at you even right now he he rejoices all Heaven rejoices when one one Soul comes to him that's not the angels and him just sitting there on the throne like this no no he's rejoicing more hey man why because in his mind he saw you redeemed he saw you give your life to him and he purchased your salvation on Calvary amen so when it actually becomes flesh it makes him Rejoice how much more when the Lord reveal something to you and then it happens you're rejoiced you're not amen Hallelujah so now so it's possible that we can grieve him away you know make him sad you know how about how would it be if if you could live so close you know look that that you do something wrong at the end of the day the Lord says you know that made me sad what you did today you say Lord I'm sorry because we know when we're in the flesh hey Reno when we've been carnal but then we also know when the Lord is Abiding and controlling Our Lives I trust you know the difference between those two things if you don't I say Lord just meet God and you'll really understand that I think it's not based on circumstance condition what everyone else is doing it's based on what the Lord has done in your life amen you can be in the middle of a storm upside down you can have the peace of God that rules in your heart amen so now when we come to that place you say Lord I'm sorry then that sweetness when he returns because you know we have two natures amen the the believer has two natures the Apostle Paul would would speak about the struggle through um um in detail in Romans 7 he'd say for I know that in me that that's a that's my flesh dwelleth no good thing for to will is present with me but how to perform that which is good I find not for the good that I would um for the good that I would I do not but the evil which I would not that I do now if I do that I would not it is no more that I do it but sin it dwelleth in me I find in a law then that when I do good evil is present with me for I Delight in the law of God after the inward man but I see another law in my members warring against the law of my mind bringing me into captivity of the law of sin which is in my members o Richard man that I am who shall deliver me from the body of this death I thank God through Jesus Christ Our Lord so then with the mind I myself serve the law of God but with the flesh the law of sin so he's saying this too there's two laws going on one in his mind which is the law of God and one is in his members and so he's saying that you know when I want to do good I don't you know I do evil or you know there's definitely you know there's this wrestle going on but now I'll say this if the spirit of God is within you that will bring your flesh subject but it depends who you yield to you can yield to your carnal nature see a Believer who doesn't know God doesn't have the law of Christ in his mind he doesn't have this balance right he just has the carnal nature with a religious covering right so so there's no overcoming power there but someone who really knows God there's those two forces of fighting and it's what we yield ourselves to is who will actually govern our lives right so I pray that we just yield ourselves to the Holy Ghost remember his yoke is easy as burden is light Hallelujah because we want him to live right we want him to have complete control over every emotion every thought everything we do we want the Lord the word to have his way Amen brother bam says about he says then Paul said them with my mind and I have the mind of Christ you see he said I serve God with my mind but my flesh how did he word that there at the last but with the flesh the law of sin what is it my flesh says tonight you're too tired your throat is too sore you've been out in the wind all day you shall not go to church tonight now that's the law of the flesh so he's not saying as in sin as an evil Deeds right he's just saying your body says I'm too tired I can't be bothered you know you know I think I've said before quoting Donnie Reagan you had to drag your body into a rapture you drag it to prayer you drag it to church you drag it into the Waters of baptism you drag it to the altar you make the Holy Ghost come and dwell in the soul and you'll eventually drag it to a body change and it will thank you one day it'll thank you amen have a good talk and say thank you drag me to church thank you drag me there I didn't want to I want to sleep in I didn't want to get up I didn't want to listen to that I didn't want to open my bible but thank you I appreciate that amen why because the natural man I mean who doesn't like a lion yeah let's be honest I do amen but there's something with us saying I want to gather I want to worship I want to praise God I want to serve him today I've got 24 hours I want to use it for him amen I want to I want to use it that he would be glorified he says you know you shall not go to church tonight that's the law of the flesh you might as well call them up and tell brother Neville's that send the questions down and tell them to answer them but you see I promise to do it see now at the mind on the inside the holy spirit said you keep your promise but the flesh said you're too tired see now the flesh say now there's no need now he's coming down to younger people yo you know the flesh is now there's no need you please you pretty little thing you're the prettiest little thing in school now don't you pay any attention to that Holy Roller mother of yours or that fanatic father see you're the best looking girl in school you're the prettiest boy the best looking boy the best built you're the most popular there there is in the city you see and you yield your members to that and where do you come out the little end of the horn every time so you'll come to an end where it's going to be disaster but Paul said my mind wants to I mean sorry Paul said My Flesh wants you wants to always yield to that your flesh does too see but the law of the spirit of God in the heart overcomes the Flesh and makes the body obey what the heart says do hallelujah amen so it's when the Holy Ghost takes control it'll make the body yield Hallelujah amen now the Lord says he's making making mild and humble that's our lord Jesus now he wasn't a push around we understand that being being humble and meek is not just anything can push you around Any Which Way but he was surrendered to the word of God for his life amen he was willing to submit himself to what God said he should do in this life amen that's that's real humility Amen to being humble does not mean you're pushed around or anyone can push you around no true humbleness is bound to submit yourself to the word of God that it or he is always right and we are wrong he's always right Jesus is always right always right all the time doesn't matter how much evidence you think you have on your side he's always right amen and I believe us recognizes the word is always right that's right Hallelujah amen if we realize he is always right then he can lead us and and if we realize he's always right then Pride can't have its way now we're going to get the pride too so so that yoke uh in the Greek it means to join a coupling you know actually and it means literally the beam of the balance connecting two scales who's seen an old set of scales yeah so so he's saying that that yolk is actually the bitter you know the beam that connects them and your brother um I mean I mean the Bible says a false balance is is I mean false scales is an Abomination to the Lord so without that yoke to bring a balance how can we even discern between good and evil how can we actually actually make right judgment calls amen but if that balance is in our lives amen then then we can actually make true discernment we can give true judgment call right amen but but if it's not there then we'll just go by our feelings in our nature and you know whatever we want to agree with because of that it's our flesh guiding us but we don't want ourselves to guide us we want him to guide us amen says the beam of a balance is connecting scales of pair of balances which is a yoke so in the Lord so when the Lord is calling come unto me and take my yoke upon me he's not just calling that to that age he's speaking it to every age down Through the Ages and he's calling that today amen that that to to be coupled with him connected with him now the reason we talk about what is the kernel this is the kernel of the of the message is being living a humble life with God that he can live is because that's where the life can come forth because remember it says in James 4 and 6 but he giveth more grace wherefore he saith God resisteth the proud but giveth Grace unto the humble now that word Grace part of it means a Divine influence upon the heart and Its Reflection In The Life so he gives Grace the Divine influence Upon Our Hearts to manifest the word he gives that Grace into the humble but he actually resists the proud remember God is not a respecter of persons he does not give us free free passage just because we claim to be the elect he treats everyone the same righty treats everyone the same he's not a respecter of person so if pride comes in up in our hearts he actually comes an opposing Force against us I don't want to fight God you're always going to come up second best the devil's gonna realize one day he's going to come up sick and best and he's been defeated down Through the Ages no matter what he's tried to do but he just doesn't wise up why because of pride pride is blinding yeah the word proud or pride in the uh in the in the New Testament uh one of the definitions says it's like a smoke it's like something that shroud surrounds it blinds people can't see because of Pride now Pride started in the heart of Satan that's where it started let's just let's just go into that because you know we've got to realize that really in reality we should have no part of the devil no part of his attributes no part of his nature amen we should be totally by the blood of Jesus Christ free of him well he's on one side you're on the other side there's no meeting ground to actually have any kind of Fellowship any kind of discussion no we're opposing so all that he is I'm against and all that I am he's against and that's fine I don't mind I'm against him I'm not on his team I'm not carrying his water bottles I'm not doing anything for him I'm not on his team right I'm not being his yeah I'm not his cheerleader at all as well that's for sure amen we are totally against him so Pride started in the heart of Satan now if we go to Ezekiel 28 and 17 I just got this one one verse here but Ezekiel is actually by Vision exposing what was in the heart of the devil we're just going to take this one verse he says thine heart was lifted up because of thy Beauty thou has corrupted thy wisdom by the reason of thy brightness I will cast It To The Ground I will lay thee before kings that they may behold thee so this so thy heart was lifted up that's actually that that's Pride coming in and the reason of his pride is begin to look at himself and look at the other angels and say I'm better than them all look how beautiful I am look how perfect I'm way better than these other guys here you know I'm like the top dog you know and God created him that that way and he wasn't with and but somehow he seemed to attribute his greatness with himself but his greatness was because of God made him thus and so a key denominator with pride is always points to self it manifests in different ways but it always points to self this is a key this is a key point and I hope we just okay you got to keep it in your heart you know when it comes to Pride it started in the heart of the heart of the devil because the devil said look how great I am and then because of sin that attribute has been injected into the human race and that's why you know we've got to realize it has no part in Us by the blood of Jesus Christ God can eradicate that thing and it stays dead and it's gone and there's no more Pride God kills Pride it's not just oh I've got to cope and you know you know you know get some coping mechanisms how to not appear proud no no no he just kills it right so so God kills Pride so because it's not meant to be part of us because it actually started in the heart of the devil amen so now Pride so so Pride so it was the pride because he started to think about how great he was Pride changed his thinking and he believed it was all about him it changed his whole thinking because there was a time because when he was created that Pride wasn't there but it seemed obviously that you know Angels had a kind of free moral agency they could think they could reason and then he began to reason with himself I'm better than this guy I'm better than this angel look how look how beautiful I am look in the mirror and maybe you know do some flexes and whatever more and look at all this and you know uh and then and then Pride came in because of who who he thought and he and he actually thought himself greater than he was and so Pride Pride this is from Mr Google said this pride is the mindset of self of being a master rather than a servant a focus on self and the service of self a pursuit of self-recognition and self-exaltation and a desire to control and use all things for self that's a that's a common denominator now Pride always causes trouble Pride it says in Proverbs Proverbs 13 and 10 only by Pride cometh contention but with the well-advised is wisdom so Pride come so my pride contention comes right with humility contention doesn't come with peace contention doesn't come with pride contention comes right humility doesn't bring a debate it doesn't bring Strife it doesn't bring problems but Pride brings contention quarrels debate and strife that's what Pride does it says in Proverbs 28 and 5 he that is of a proud heart stirth up Strife but he that putteth is trust the Lord shall be made fat Hallelujah that's a spiritual fact that's right Hallelujah one day I'll have a quote you know I'll be this big and he pays a lot amen but but he's talking spiritually right just physically see although anyway we'll leave that one alone um praise a lot but heathens were proud hat stirs up Strife so if there's pride in someone Strife is stirred up they can't help it because it's part of their nature part of their fallen nature Proverbs 28 25 I remember if you want to write that down either there's a proud so so there's something within them they just stir up strife and now surface Strife in your life this was me I thought I was clever if there's Strife in your life it's probably not your wife it's probably Pride that one's free because because remember the common denominator in every situation in your life is you you are the common denominator you are the the one constant you're not even a variable you're the constant if you know about math equations you are the constant in the equation is U so if there's Strife around you trouble break your your separation of friendship family well oh I don't talk to this person because listen it's because of you you know so so this Strife is because of pride so we're going to be very just just do a self-examination do I actually bring do people like to be around me because of peace you know and actually leave my presence feeling better than when they came or do they actually don't really want to be around me because of you know strife because of the atmosphere that we carry what is that atmosphere is it atmosphere of the Holy Ghost which brings peace and actually refreshes them and you and you don't need to necessarily talk about the Lord you just have Fellowship just talk about anything but people walk away feeling oh so good to visit them I just enjoy spending time why because the Holy Ghost is there brother bam says it's those leaves green leaves of Fellowship that people come under rest under the shade tree and they just feel refreshed they go on so that's peace but Strife is not that kind of a way or Pride does not produce that kind of an atmosphere I mean because Pride doesn't like being told that they're wrong it doesn't like to speak about certain subjects especially when the conclusion or the thrust of the conversation is that they need to change their ways or consider others needs more than their own Pride doesn't like to talk about those kind of things now it says in First Peter 3 and 7 it says likewise your husbands dwell with them according to knowledge give honor unto the wife as unto the weaker vessel as being is together of the grace of life that your prayers be not hindered so it's actually speaking that the whole reason yo husbands prayers can be hindered is not because of their wife but because of them see Fallen man loves to blame one another what did Adam do he's fallen and you know God calls Herman even the serpent and God gets to the bottom of this thing he knows what's going on but he wants them to know he knows what's going on and then God says actually to to God says to no sorry Adam says to God the woman you gave me cause this whole trouble the woman you gave me so he didn't take responsibility he knew what he was doing he went with his eyes open Eve was deceived Adam was not but because he had such a love for his wife he opened with his eyes open allowed sin to come and take dominion over all of creation he allowed Sid to come in because he went with his eyes open but then when he fell he's saying no no it's not me it's these people it's actually God it's your fault because God the woman you gave me I was unhappy eyes alone but you're the one who brought this one and and she was part of him so we can never come to a place where we blame everyone else for our problems because the constant in the equation is you [Music] yeah that's what I do because I don't want to do this what do you see but but honestly you know I'm preaching to myself I don't just want to get too heavy in this that's why I'm kind of bringing it kind of like this right there's a purpose but you see so you got to really think now so so we have to but Pride will never want to dwell with their wife according to knowledge now remember it says dwell with them according to knowledge so that so that means it's not just living in the same house having the last the same last name or whatever people do these days you know saying now we're husband and wife no you've got to dwell with them according to knowledge you've got to understand them but Pride will pride is in the man's heart he'll never want to come down and actually understand his wife if it if it means that he has to change according to bring a greater Unity because Pride puts a wall up pride is a defense but it's not the right defense the word of God is the right defense and if you're one there should be no wall anyway s right amen so because Pride does not allow a complete connection or a complete Oneness talk about between husband and wife now or even between you and God because God's opposing you if you're proud now Strife comes because of carnality as well yeah the Apostle Paul would actually blast the Corinthian Church remember the Corinthian Church our spirit filled they had the gifts operating they had God in their midst they were saved they were Believers but they had come into a carnal mindset and he says and I Brethren could not speak unto you as spiritual but as under carnal even as unto the babes in Christ Jesus I can't even come speak to you spiritual things because of your carnality and what you're doing I I've got to come and speak to you as babies you should be up here adults mature stable in your walk but because you've actually surrendered you know actually become carnal because of fussing and stewing going on I've got to talk to you like babies we're gonna go back to the start basically you know you should be way up here but you're down here because of cardinality so being being a carnal Christian actually hinders your walk Pride will hinder everyone's walk right if if there's any Pride if there's any attribute of Satan in your life because the blood is not taking it out it will hinder your walk but God has had a cleanse us of all of his Works remember it wasn't meant to be ours in the beginning and it's not ours now Hallelujah so if you've got a proud Spirit that's actually not part of you you may think it's you but it's not you but if you can discern actually this is not me then you can get rid of it amen amen amen he says I feed you with milk and not with meat for a for here and two you're not able to Bear it neither um neither yet now are you able for a year yet carnal for for whereas there is among you envying Strife divisions are you not carnal Walkers meant because there's all these troubles and carnal you know you know divisions and envy and stuff you're carnal your life is showing your kernel it even says in Proverbs or Psalms it says even a child is non-biased doings you know so our actions really show what we are to help us Lord Jesus to be yielded and humble and meek amen because carnal means to pertain to the flesh it means that you know by implication animal unregenerate carnal fleshly so it's actually walking according to this unregenerated flesh thank God we're gonna have a body change we need it Hallelujah I'm glad we're gonna be real happy when these bodies are changed amen with that with that's done away with but you see see so that's how you know we can't walk in that way because the devil may want us to have his pride but it doesn't belong to US unless we take ownership of it so man so remember just just coming back to my thought before Pride manifests itself in different ways but it's Common Thread is all about self right so so whether so so Pride must be the main so someone with pride must be the main focus whether it's through a pity party or wanting to be the main one Pride manifest in different ways now the Bible says that Mary Magdalene had um Seven Devils cast out of her by the Lord brother bran would say this he says he says everybody who's ever been free from the Devil by the power of Jesus Christ knows where they're standing no one can ever come and uh into his great divine presence ever be the same person anymore you're changed there's something happens to you oh you can stand off and and psychology and imagine this and accept that a certain thing in some theories or something like that but we don't believe in theology we believe in the power of the resurrection of Jesus Christ and when you come into His presence there is something that happens in your life that changes you and you're never the same anymore a man that's ever been in the presence of Christ so you're saying we don't believe in just changing our thinking changing our habits no it takes the resurrection power Jesus Christ to take us from sinner to Saint to transform our lives from Lost to found right to give us a new nature that's what we believe in no no he talks about Mary Magdalene so she had Seven Devils cast out of her and he says pride and envy that was two of them and she thought she was so pretty and there was no one like her what that's probably it's all about me look how great I am you know look how you know she was the end thing but when Jesus spoke and said be thou clean all that left her she become a new person she wasn't so pretty anymore in her own sight so she didn't think she was ugly but she didn't she didn't think above what she was because her main focus in life wasn't herself anymore it was him all right man but she wrapped herself in the robe of meekness and gentleness and followed the master she loved him I mean so that was the main focus in her life was him it wasn't herself because Pride went out every winner Hallelujah it should be the same thing with us when Pride leaves the main focus is not ourselves it's him I mean because ourselves are not the object of our love and affection he is amen amen now he would say and I stand at the door and knock because there's many things in the heart of man and there's many doors remember there's multiple Chambers in the heart just just physically I think there's four main Chambers I might be wrong but it's just there's another little Dory says called Pride he says oh what a horrible little black Devil's all pinned up in the heart of Pride thinking you're better than somebody else well I wouldn't see my children over there they don't dress right the people that goes there isn't in my class if the Lord Jesus in your heart we're all one class because of one Spirit we're all baptized into one body Pride just feels a little it's a little complex you have so pride comes in because of complexes we'll come back to that soon but you see pride Pride is very tired very closely to an arrogant spirit and it can't be corrected when someone tries to correct it it overreacts it's a manifestation of manifestation of Pride and overreaction as a manifestation of Pride now King Ahab was too proud to be humble to Humble himself to the word of the Lord he would go down and see Neighbors maybe you know I think he just looked out his window we won't read it but you know just to dramatize it to the First Kings 21 if you want to read it later you know he looks out his window and he sees naboth's Vineyard and it's right next to his house he says I want that Vineyard but he didn't want it for a Vineyard he wanted to turn it to a garden of herbs so you want and you know and he goes the neighbor this is his name off I want to buy your Vineyard or if you don't want to sell it I'll give you another one that's better but their neighbors would say to him no it's not right for me to sell the inheritance of my father so basically he quoted the scripture saying no no it's actually against the word to do what you want me to do and I'm not willing to go against the word and you know what he did Ahab was the king went to his house he was heavy and displeased he went and laid on his bed he turned his face to the wall and would eat no bread what did he do he threw a tantrum he overreacted by a simple person saying no he threw a tantrum you know he's the king you think here's the king he's not just some lonely guy who's living in some little Hut somewhere in Israel he's the king of Israel and one of the subjects says no the word says that's wrong I'm not going to do it and instead of saying I understand that's okay peace be unto you he goes into his Palace pulls up pulls himself against the wall and starts crying having a tantrum I'm not gonna eat I'm heavy it's all displeased you know read this to the girls the picture Bible say you know Jezebel comes along what's wrong honey you know and he'd say he won't sell his Vineyard to me you know throw the Tantrum yo well what's he doing it's Pride it's Pride manifesting because isn't it amazing you think so so Ahab this is not the first time someone's ever spoke the word a lot to him you know you think after Elijah comes into the throne room and says there's not going to be rain or due till I call for it and the place dries up and in that same Elijah system come up to Mount Carmel we're gonna have a showdown who's got and then that same Elijah calls fire down from heaven consumes consumes a sacrifice and that same Elijah says now get in your chariot because it's going to be rain you better get back to your house and that same Elijah now causes the rain to come and that same Elijah runs in front of his Chariot and beats him home you would think that he would actually humble himself to the word of God but he was too proud to do it and that's why when he came and tried to buy neighbor's Vineyard he threw a tantrum when naboth said no it's an overreaction when someone is correct that tried to be corrected and they're proud they overreact oh what's the use of it all then throw it all in all these things no that's an overreaction because of pride he was too proud he overreacted and it was a bit of an adult tantrum but that tantrum that Pride resulted in his own destruction because it because Jezebel took over wrote the letters to the elders had a had a trump charge pushed up against naboth he got killed and then Elijah came back said because naboth has killed the dogs in a lick your blood you're gonna die and so don't let Pride destroy you Pride destroyed him don't their pride destroy you amen that pride is because he wasn't willing to submit himself to the word of God rather expose it and let God destroy it [Music] praise the Lord he says in demonology now now pride is also manifested in wanting to be a big shot wanting to be front and center he says here he says now no no so this is the message demonology a religious realm no matter how much teaching you've got how you can drum That Into You God is not in big words God is in an honest heart you might stand here speak big words like I don't know what but that doesn't bring you closer to God you can stand and practice how to repeat your sermon and say these things that don't get you closer to God you can learn all the dictionary until you sleep with one that still doesn't get you closer to God a humble submitted heart and the Simplicity is what brings you to God and that's true amen a humble heart God loves no matter if you don't know your ABCs that don't make any difference just a humble heart God dwells in a humble heart not an education not in schools not in theology seminaries not in all these other different places not in big words or In classical places God dwells in the human heart and the law we can break yourself down the more simple you can become greater in the sight of God he says let me give you something I can see your fields are full of wheat out here who's in a wheat field yep a full head of wheat always bows a little old sprig sticks up here and flopping around like it knows everything so he's talking about people now right it ain't got it but but one expects some others ain't got it in the head right or rather I mean it doesn't have it in the heart a holy head will bow to the power recognize Jesus Christ as the Son of God and believe his works so so Pride will manifest saying look at me here I am I'm front and Cedar this is all about me and if and if they're not put fun and sinner then their pride is hurt and they'll pull away but someone who is humble doesn't care if they're front and center are in the back right David said I'd rather be the dormant in the house of God I'd be satisfied with that I'd rather just be the doormat you know to be you know I'll be happy just to be that part of the building not front and center see humility doesn't care where they are in the body as long as they're in the body that's how I feel anyway I don't know why I'm standing here but you know I'm just happy to be saved I'm happy to be a Christian I'm real happy to no I've got eternal life that that satisfies me I mean hey man if this is the last time I ever preached praise God I'm not a Christian because I stand here no no that's for sure amen see so so someone who's flopping around like that thinking they know everything they ain't got it in the head make them bow amen what it's Pride manifesting see the Holy Ghost comes into you to take all the away from you see people say I can't give up this I can't do this I can't do that the Holy Ghost takes the cats away I can never overcome Pride the Holy Ghost takes that away I can never actually get rid of this bitterness and unforgiveness and trouble he takes it all away see right it makes women stop cutting their hair makes them quit wearing shorts and slacks no excuses makes them quit tattling oh yes that's what it's for to make you live a holy life it'll unfollow the instructions of the Bible every time a woman say it's just too hot I have to wear these and it gives me a headache to let my hair grow but there's no excuse with the Holy Ghost it's there to make it so it'll follow the word just exactly that's what the Holy Ghost just to do is to make your man make you man turn your head from these half-naked women and quit lusting after them and the church members and that's what it's to do it'll make you quit you you smoking and drinking and wanting to be a big shot it takes that out it'll take that out of you it'll humble you when you do that it's what the Holy Ghost is for it's for a holy life that's right makes you quit gossiping makes you quit playing cards shooting craps I have no idea what the Caps whatever those are and all those um all these other things that you do around the corner it'll it'll make you quit your carrying on the way you're doing living untrue to your wife that's what I'll do that's right it'll quit you wanting to marry someone else's wife that's exactly right why it takes all those things out Amy wanting to be the big shot the main one front and center that's Pride the Holy Ghost is here to take that out but see pride doesn't manifest just in that way of wanting to be the big front and center it also manifests in a pity party amen because see see people who get a complex that no one cares no one helps no one's worried about me that's actually Pride manifesting because it's all about them right because remember that's a common denominator self look at me see pride doesn't just enter into a person to think that they're there that they're great or you know to make them think that it's all about me all about this pain and hurt you know they weren't a nurses singing and they want everyone's attention to be upon them that's Pride so someone who has a pity party hey if we've got pain in our life you should tell someone about it pray about it and let's get it done right it's actually like here take this bomb I want it out of my life take this poison away that's what pain and hurt is it's not meant to be part of you no you don't need it don't carry it around just just get rid of it let the Lord take it from me but people will actually have the same pain and hurt but they want to hold on to it because it draws attention to them they think they're important because of it what is that Pride so we don't want to be those kind of people hey amen they see pride doesn't just enter into a person because they think they're great or better it can enter them by pain or trauma now brother Brian would would um this is an in in a prayer line he's speaking to a woman he says no this isn't a and if I told you I would know that it left you because right now you're standing and it's bothering you weary and the sun's looking gloomy and everything like that so this is this person's Outlook and everything seems like a phobia and you get scared at things and it isn't normal see it isn't right standing longer and longer you just uh we just make it it just keeps just you just keep thinking like that you're wanting to get well and I'm going to ask Jesus how now to heal you I believe he will don't you sister all right you come a little closer now you've had quite a struggle in life anyhow you know what I'm speaking of there I don't have to say it because this is uh live here you see but you know what I'm speaking of and he says our heavenly father so he prays for her by your spirit looking down through the stream of time oh you're here dear Jesus you're so lovely and kind and we love you with all your I mean with all of our heart and our sister standing here has been bound by an oppression of Satan foul Spirits have tried to put Pride upon her but Thou Art here to remove this curse of the enemy for he said the last words from a sacred lips as as you were leaving the world you said these signs shall follow them and my name there's your cast out Devils help me dear God this Jewel of Faith against the enemy so he's saying because she's had quite a struggle in life it's opened a door that the and she's Bound By An oppression of Satan and these foul Spurs have tried to put Pride upon her so it's not just thinking you're the big shot you're the great you're better than these people that brings Pride it can be trauma because remember pride is a defense so here she was had had quite a struggle in life and that opened a door for that demon of Pride to step in see that's why you've got to realize Pride manifests itself in many different ways but there's underlying causes so if we've had member if we've had quite a struggle in life those things are actually made to make us better not better but it depends what we yield ourselves to it can make you bitter or it can make you better it's your choice it depends what you want it to make you you know because everything in life if you let the Lord take it can be a power in his hands like in the Old Testament there were Cities of Refuge in the in the Land There were six Cities of Refuge where someone who who accidentally killed someone saying happened they could run into that City and be safe until the until the case was was was judged right now the seventh is always a mystery it's always actually Christ himself like you know Jesus was at the at the feast in Cana there the wedding feast and and there were six water pots brought before him he was the seventh he turned all them into wine right the woman at the well she had five husbands she was living with a man she wasn't married with so six men were in her life but Jesus was the seventh which actually undid the first six right she could actually instead of living under a complex of pain and hurt trying to find love in the wrong places she found real love I meant the seventh seal is a mystery but it's Christ himself becoming one with the bride right winding up the end time plan so the seventh is always a mystery amen but you see now just like Cities of Refuge in the Old Testament they a lot of them were actually Philistine cities garrisons are the enemy enemy City so they're in the promised land but the enemy was dwelling in there but then when Joshua and the Israelites came in they became Cities of Refuge like Ramos Gilly at different places you know they were they became a City of Refuge at one time they were enemy Garrison but when God came in it became a City of Refuge so now when pain and Trauma comes in it can become a stronghold of the devil in our lives epic can become a complex Pride can come in strife and envy whatever more can come in because of pain and hurt trauma produce just like natural trauma if I had a big bruise you know something hits me on the arm and it bruised forms so the bruises formed because of that blow right and it can affect my life it can stop me using my arm properly you know whatever more but when healing comes and it can take it away amen and then when someone else is at that same kind of injury I can really enter into their burden because I've experienced the same kind of pain right but then but then if I but then after after at least me and I still have a victim mentality it can still govern my life like it's still there we're not victims we're Overcomers right we are not victims we are Overcomers right because once someone's overcome something we are victorious over it and it doesn't rule us anymore we actually can use it as a token of God's grace to show someone else so it was an enemy Garrison but then it became a City of Refuge so pain can come into our lives and the devil can come and it can become a stronghold of the enemy like the woman of the well she came to the well at that time because she wasn't welcome with the other woman to get water she was ostracized from her Village even though she lived there she wasn't allowed to to partake of you know all the things they did she wasn't welcome so that was a that would be a lot of pain in her day and she was living with this thing and probably thinking well this is just how life is going to be and she got married all those times failed everyone and then decided what's the point of saying I do let's just I live together and you know she's living under this complex and hurt and pain and then out but there she is Jesus knew she'd have those things but then the Lord comes away she recognizes this is the Messiah her life was never the same so then now Church yeah after the upper room the Holy Ghost I believe she would have been one of those there or when Philip came and preached and Peter laid hands upon they received the Holy Ghost she was one of those numbers we're going to meet her one day we can actually find out what her name is oh you're the woman at the well praise God Hallelujah your testimony help me your testimony gave me strength your test row gave me overcoming but I could draw strength from your pain yeah yeah because the Lord turned it from pain into praise Hallelujah so there she was now after the upper room and now she's filled with the Holy Ghost sainted woman transformed life and then someone else comes into the church and they're a woman at the well too maybe they've only just been married once or twice whatever all but you're trying to look for love in the wrong places all this pain and hurt no one loves men feeling rejected not accepted all these things complex is carrying in and then and then and then then they walk into the church and they see her rejoicing see people rejoicing and the first thought the devil puts into people's minds is they these people will not understand me that will not be able to relate because they were never where I was and they don't know my struggles and just try us one time have like a set of speed dating speed testimonies and actually actually hear a bit of you know so what's your story what's your story what's your story and you may realize these people are just like me Hallelujah and that woman at the well I hope that wasn't a bad joke saying speed dating but you know but yeah but actually sit down and talk to people about where did they come from and no doubt the woman who's still the woman at the well speaks the one who was the woman of the well maybe first glance saying this woman won't understand me and then she sits down and says sister let me tell you something this was my life this is where I was stuck the hurt the trauma maybe for my childhood and this what happened and this is what led me to the first man it didn't work out I was hoping that you know and I thought surely the second one I'll find peace and love but it just broke apart again and you know the cycle of pain and grief and rejection and you know but then one day I went to the well and I was actually thinking yeah it was just another day it was just another church service I was just going through the motions but there was a man at the well and and we begin to talk and here's a Jew as a Samaritan you know we had no dealings but they were going to reveal my life and speak to me and show me all I ever did and I said we know we're Messiah cometh he'll do these things he just said I'm him I ran into the city I dropped my water pump my life has never been the same Hallelujah and she could say now I can pray for you because you can say Lord Jesus I've walked in these steps I know what it's like to be in these steps that she's in and really enter into her burden and she can get set free Hallelujah amen that's that's not just you know that's reality we actually enter into one another's burdens or people who come in because we say no we've been there praise the Lord so what does it turn into it was it was a Garrison of the enemy complex is paid and hurt because of trauma but then the Lord uses that same testimony so she can enter into someone's burden it becomes a City of Refuge where that person actually run into him be safe be delivered Hallelujah just like brother bam said when his little show and Roses baby was dying you know with um TB or whatever it was and you know her eyes were crossing because of the pain you know then she passed away she was you know buried there with her mother and you know he said that every child with cross eyes that walked you know came across the platform not one of them left with the cross eyes because that pain and great trauma that that that that the prophet you know suffered the Lord used that to deliver people so but Pride will say well poor me and why did this have to happen and why does this know but when it comes into when actually turns into a real testimony you're not feeling sorry for yourself you're just glad you're not there anymore and it's not something hidden because you're delivered right if you're still kind of battling with it you want to keep it hush-hushing away but if you're really free so how I'm free I was bound by this thing but now I'm not bound by this thing I know what it's like to be delivered I know what it's like to be free I know it's like for things to consume my mind and my affections everything but now I was like to be that or cat friend that I can walk free Hallelujah so she was bound up by trouble she had quite a struggle in her life and the foul Spirits had tried to put Pride upon her so we can't let Pride come in because of pain no we should let the Lord come in because of pain Hallelujah amen hallelujah amen now Pride makes the Lord unwelcome Pride makes Jesus unwelcome Simon the Pharisee was full of pride he invited Jesus to that feast to leave him in the corner with unwashed feet unwelcome and pride made him unwelcome we don't ever want to come to a place where the Lord is actually unwelcome in our presence we never want to get to that place because humility will say Lord oh the king of glory come in come and dwell with me Lord this is why I love your presence I love you being I feel so honored you're coming to my life you come into my house you'd visit me but Pride pushes them away so we don't ever want to let Pride I don't want to be Simon the Pharisee I want to be the woman with you know that washes his feet we're real hot felt worship and praise and thanksgiving pull my whole life out see I can see some people wrestling don't wrestle just just get rid of the pride don't look at yourself look at him because she walked out of that meeting Justified by sins be forgiven they go and sin no more you know she walked out free Simon the Pharisee with his pride was just condemned all the more I would walk out free Hallelujah if you want to be yogged up with the Lord you've got to say Lord I want to be humble I want to surrender myself to your word take all myself all my pride all that I am I want to Lad all aside and give you everything I want to give up my I want to give myself away Hallelujah this is such a joy we can be yoked with the Lord Jesus Christ amen that we can actually get to the kernel of the message the colonel of it where the life of God can be manifested through us the word actually puts on flesh it's not just quoting quotes and throwing scriptures around but the Lord himself dwells in US manifests his word why because of a life of humility Hallelujah amen so I'm just gonna I'm just gonna finish with that maybe I've just given another introduction of an introduction but Pride manifests itself in various ways the common I'm just going to give a summary the common denominator is all about self it's all about self either I'm better than everyone else I'm glad I'm not that brother or that sister or that family oh I'm glad you know it's Pro we are never even people in the world never think you're better than them never ever think you're better than anyone it's God's grace that found you it's God's grace that called you it's God's grace that keeps you it's it's all the lord it's not it's not anything we do oh you know not one of us when we get on the other side say well I did this that will never be an out near our vocabulary near our thinking will be I did this well I got here no no he got you there amen he keeps you today he'll keep you until he takes you into Glory it's his doing right but Pride says look at me and this is what I know no no we just got to dump that all out and say Lord Jesus fill me with you and you do what you want to do Hallelujah amen see you're such a valuable lesson to me the first time before I went to Papua New Guinea to do Mission work I had such a burden to share this message with people who who barely speak English at best and I was trying to work out what am I going to do what am I going to take what do you know should I take this many bibles this many books and what you know what should I take but then the Lord came down such in such a powerful way put me on my knees the prince of God did in my room I couldn't even pray anything he said not by power or by might but by my spirit save the Lord he said you go and I'll do the rest and I went he brought the people he did everything I just was there just like a bystander watching the whole thing go take place and that's how we should be let God do everything Lord I mean just and and prayer say Lord what should I be doing because it's really it's not you telling God what to do in prayer it's prayer is actually prayer changes our minds in the situation it's not you trying to change God's mind to do what you want done it's Lord thy will be done on Earth as it is in heaven amen that's how it should be do but Pride will try and dictate to God what it once done lucky some errand boy God is not out here and boy God is not some little mascot that goes does our bidding like some little you know whatever no he's the king of glory we're here to do his bidding we're here to live a life that's pleasing to him amen so we want to be meek and lowly that's the colonel of the message to live a humble life that God can live through us but prior to his points to itself it's all about me whether I'm better than this person or because of a pity party feeling sorry for myself Spirit you know it's all about me so this person didn't do this this person oh no one visits me no one sees this no one no I'm not that they didn't shake my hand all these little things but you know to have friends you must first Show Yourself friendly it's a scriptural principle yeah it's a scripture if you want to be free have friends you got to be friendly you'll never see someone who's got a big circle of friends that's unfriendly right that'll be one way to make your circle of friends lower right so you know but if it's all about me then that's pride and remember Pride brings strife so if there's Strife in your life as I said it's probably not your wife it's you but you know Pride isn't willing to actually come to a point where it's actually I need changing pride is Wise It's the other person's fault we're to say Lord Jesus change me if I'm the common problem and if I'm butting heads it's my head that's budding right so change me Lord to stop this hey someone's got to break the cycle someone's got to break the cycle of fasting and fighting and stewing and it Mars up and say Lord start with me start with me you know what Insanity Einstein said Insanity was doing the same thing over and over again expecting a different result that's Insanity so if you keep butting heads there's strife and trouble and it just oh yo you do the same thing you wreck the same way no that's got to die you've actually got to give it to the Lord for the Lord to change you take it out of you that you can that that he breaks the cycle in your life I'm glad he's a cycle breaker Hallelujah I'm glad what I've said today is not us trying to do it now it's him but you want to give it to him give your pride give everything you are say Lord just do open heart surgery on Me Lord I don't want to fulfill the the conditions of the last day being heady high-minded lovers of pleasure more than lovers of glory god incontinent false accusers fears despise of those that are good traitors I don't want to be that kind of a person Lord I want to be meek lowly surrendered that you can have your way amen let's have the musicians this morning just finish it there amen it cleans it out Lord amen Hallelujah I'm so glad we can but isn't the Lord wonderful just take my yoke upon me let me take my yoke upon you my yoke is easy my burden is light and learn of me he said learn of me the only way to learn of someone is actually you submit yourself to them and let them teach you right amen that comes the real humility amen oh lord your brother Isaac you have to help me out you got a song amen amen yep that's perfect amen let's stand
