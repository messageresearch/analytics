hallelujah amen god bless you all um can i hear anyone can anyone hear me who have your hand you can hear me i mean i need an aiming corner somewhere but yeah god bless you you know i was thinking about um you know any sickness either in your body or in your spirit you know it's actually a you know it's a devil troubling you so i was thinking if that devil's there why what do you make him make it real uncomfortable for him and just give the lord a whole bunch of praise you may also make it uncomfortable for the devil while he's at your house amen so i think we should just praise the lord and give him glory today amen because he's done so many great things our lord jesus is great yes god bless you great to see everyone i'm just going to try and um change my view a bit because i've got a slideshow i'd like to um share here um so i'm just going to try and get this going and i've only got one screen but um see how this goes here so okay so can everyone see that just changes a bit um amen if you want to unmute yourself maybe or maybe i'll just um that's all fine uh yeah so yes i'd like to say god bless you all thank you for your prayers you know christine said to me i think it was last night or the night before i can't remember she said you know are you are you um going to be okay to preach on sunday and i said to her well you know if brother ron spencer can preach for two years with stage four cancer i think i can stand here you know and zoom and talk to you this morning so you know praise the lord for um brothers like him who just keep pressing on so i believe we can keep pressing on too amen so let's um we're just going to go to the scripture here um so with my notes i don't need to i don't know what the next slide is well i do i prepared it but you know i go to hebrews chapter 12. i pray everyone's doing well amen either in body or in spirit and both you know this enemy that we're facing right now is a defeated foe uh it's just another one of god's trophies that we're going to put on god's wall of god's amazing grace you know the devil's got nothing over us he's a defeated being so we can just rejoice in the victory of our lord jesus christ this morning i mean we're just going to read from hebrews chapter 12 very um a very uh familiar piece of scripture uh i trust you everyone we're gonna read the first two verses here and um yeah god bless you all good to see everyone good to see everyone's camera on and yeah god bless you um so i'm gonna try and i've only got a laptop screen here and i'm just anywhere i think i can see pretty much everyone so yeah praise the lord okay so hebrews 12 and one we're seeing we also are compassed about was so great a cloud of witnesses let us lay aside every weight and sin that so easily beset us and let us run with patience that race that has set before us looking unto jesus now that's that's uh part of my title this morning looking under jesus the author and finisher of our faith who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross despising the shame and has set down at the right hand of the throne of god amen and then we've got another reading from 2nd corinthians 4 and 16. i'm going to read down to verse 18 one of my um i've got a lot of um favorite bits but i like this for which cause we faint not but though our outward man perish yet the inward man is renewed day by day for our light affliction is but for a moment worketh for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory while we look not at the things which are seen but at the things which are not seen for the things which are seen are temporal but the things which are not seen are eternal amen praise be to god this is bow he's in a word of prayer amen this morning gracious father we love you so much we want to praise your mighty name thank you dear god we can make the devil uncomfortable when it comes to our house lord we can make him uncomfortable by praising you and giving thanks unto you and rejoicing in you and lord we love you dear god just like lord like the prophet he said when the devil got into his car when he was driving along he said well devil i'm going to sing to you all the way so he sang all the way until the devil got out of the car and lord i believe we can do the same kind of thing we can make the atmosphere so uncomfortable for the devil we can make it so full of praise and glory unto you the devil just is not comfortable anymore being around us no more so that's what we want to do lord in our lives not just in this moment lord but in every moment in our lives just may our our lives be a worship and a praise unto you in everything we say do and think oh god may you grant it father and dear god you see many of us are sick in body lord we're on well father's cover 19 virus this devil and different sicknesses have afflicted us oh god and lord these people with trouble lord jesus and their spirits father i pray lord you touch each one of us lord by your mighty hand oh god we want to thank you that by your stripes we're healed lord i want to thank you dear god that you've already made an atonement lord to heal us of all diseases father and all troubles in our spirits oh lord i pray dear god as we read your word may you anoint it to our hearts oh god i want to get myself out of the way lord may you speak lord for your great glory lord i pray you would be walking in every lounge every place that we're watching the service lord you're a personal god you're not a god there's a distant place somewhere but you're here with us now so i pray your presence will be very real oh god to each and every one lord for your glory in jesus christ's name amen amen god bless you friends you may have your seats this morning um i'd like to i think as i said my title is uh looking away to jesus and um i think this is the most important vital uh thing well i i think the word thing is not the right word to use but it's the most vital you could say commandment or exhortation we could ever hear i believe in this season is that we must look away to jesus now the prophet says here this is this is from the sermon look away to jesus he says now for a text i'm going to take this look away to jesus and he says look away from the world to jesus moses made the serpent and here the prophet was later speaking of it that that would happen looking away to jesus so you know to say oh look away to jesus it can seem very eerie fairy but to me it's actually a very concrete uh instruction because he's saying look away now it's interesting we where how the prophet says look away to jesus because what uh what i believe the lord is saying in this age is that as there's lots of things we'll be looking to that we need to turn our focus from and turn our focus on to the right thing and that right thing is our lord jesus christ so so notice he doesn't say look to jesus says look away to jesus because there will always be something upon this earth that will have our attention and the devil wants our attention like never before and this world is a tension-grabbing world and everything it's not just advertising but every part of life there's an attention parting uh grabbing part of it and so we must look away from those things to our lord jesus christ so that's why i like it how the prophet really said look away from the world to jesus amen now we know many great things are happening in this world and i want to but you know i believe that if we can put it in its right spiritual context we can really say well we can see it for what it is right so you know brother brandman you know i've got a quote uh here um later we'll come to it he says i always want to look at everything through the word so we're going to start with a few things here it's interesting i this is for the next time i speak i want to talk about lies and this will maybe in some way may make a slight kind of well i'll come back to this when i talk about lies but lies are a very interesting uh subject because lies are not just you know white lies lies uh full-blown lies they can be lies to save face they can you know be lies to make yourself sound better or make someone sound worse to distort truth there's many different facets of lies and and and where they come from and you know the influence that make them but anyway that's next time but you know there's a lot of there's a lot of i could use the word because it's today's trending misinformation in the world today but if we have the right information which is from the word of god then we can discern what's going on and we can place it in its place just like brother ferdi was saying that you know what's happening with russia right now is is the backdrop now uh before we read this quote here so i can't blank the um um slides but you know brother brown um you know he says well let's just read this first i know some of you already read all the way through now see don't worry about russia russia is a small pebble on the beach don't worry about communism you will watch romanism when it's uniting with churches there's nothing written in the scripture about communism ruling the world and i go by the word regardless of what anyone else goes it's the word i believe it's romanism that takes the world and romanism is the mother of organization there never was an organization till rome and every one of them came out of it and the bible said so she's the mother of harlots i could stay half a day on it again but i guess i might as well move on so he's saying this in greatest bad level thought because this is the battle of the mind but the thing is every spirit in the world wants to get your attention to capture your mind for you to receive that spirit and become one with it are we are we together this morning right that's what every spirit wants to do the reason that we do not fall under the spirit of this world is because we have a contrary spirit to the world we're the spirit of christ right but if you if you lay aside the spirit of christ and take the spirit of the world again you'll agree with the world you'll look with the world you'll think like the world you act like the world because you have that spirit but if you you know cast off the spirit of the world receive the spirit of christ right if you truly do are born again receive the holy ghost then you your spirit can't jail with the spirit in the world now this was so so the prophet says that russia is a small pebble on the beach now to me i think that's a very powerful statement because you know he was told in 1933 to watch russia watch the king of the north we know in that time i think brother ferdi spoke about this on sunday and i thoroughly love that service it touched my heart deeply but you know you know in those days it was the soviet union so it was when russia became russia again i mean that's easy what watch it you know and we know what what what russia is doing in this hour as was prophesied but the thing is the prophecy is that's just a small pebble on the beach we don't even need to worry about it don't he says don't worry about communism watch that romanism watch that compromising lukewarm religious spirit come in and mix everything together see that's the thing that we have to go to get so but the thing is so with russia now what what i loved how we used the word russia is just that's just the backdrop all right now the backdrop now brother isaac could um um surely enlighten us all on this kind of thing but you know i think i think when when when a when a playwriter or a filmmaker are putting a play together they they think of a scene and they think of what the main characters are doing in the scene and then they think about what is the backdrop based on what the characters are doing right so so it's not the backdrop dictating what the characters are doing it's the other way around hello yes so so i can't hear anyone so i need to see something going on if you pull some muscles waving well i yeah i'll appreciate it yeah so so it's not the it's not the it's not the backdrop dictating to the main characters what's going on it's the it's it's what the main characters are doing which he dictates what the backdrop's doing so now if the bat drop is rising up as it is as she is you know she's like you know you know they say russia is a beer you know and she's like she's woken up and she's you know she's going after her cubs that have lit you know lift the knees you know like ukraine you know wants that soviet block back you know so but that's the backdrop and we know the backdrop is prophesied to to drop a bomb on the vatican and blow up the united states we know that but that's the backdrop so so the main characters have to be doing something in order for the backdrop to come into position second right so if the bride of jesus christ is coming into her position he said the reason the backdrop is doing what it's doing is because the bride is in her position for a rapture amen so that's why we can rejoice and we can just trust in the fact no no we are not remember we're not catching up to the backdrop we are not catching up to the backdrop this is not how this works no the backdrop is catching up to the main characters right which is the bride christ and his bride are the main characters amen so he says and i go by the word regardless of what anything else goes so he'll go by the word regardless of people's emotion public opinion hysteria what's trending i'm going to go with the word and that's why we have to bring everything subject to the word of god we have every thought every feeling it can be very close to our natural birth our natural identity whatever more but we must bring it all subject to the word of god that we can go by the word of god amen now brother barum had this dream now now this is a dream from um that he shares when he preaches the sermon is this the time of the answers now i want you to look at this because as time goes on i'm afraid as this delay goes above this appeared delay goes on more people are wandering away and and that'll make sense when i finish when i'm reading what i'm reading he says and i and he and he said i dreamed a dream and there it was i just sat still and i listened and watched he said and i dreamed that there was a some great big hill like out in a field there was some bluegrass or something was said and on the top of this hill where the water had washed away the soil there was a top rock um up on top of the hill like a top of a mountain it was rock no grass and where the water had washed down it cut some of those some kinds of readings on those stones and you were standing there interpreting this reading on these stones so i think this is junior jackson's dream you know i might be wrong but so you're saying brother brown was there interpreting these readings on these stones i said all of us and here it is the way he put it he said the brethren from georgia and all around we're all standing together listening to you interpret the mysterious writings on those stones that mountain and said then you picked up something like some i'm i'm up from the air something like a wrecking bar or a crowbar wasn't it brother something like that a wrecking bar real sharp and said that's how you done it i don't know and you said you struck the top of that mountain and and ripped it around and lifted the cap off um cap of it off it was in the shape of a pyramid and you ripped the top of it off now that was in now that was months and months and months before the pyramid message was preached and said brethren that was white stone granite and you said the sun or the light had never shined on this look on this watch this that's the instructions look on this watch this and that's right because in the formation of the world the world was formed uh before there was light we all know that god moved upon the water and then in the beginning he he spoke for light and naturally down under there and in the age that formation was that light had never come upon that stone he says look upon this light had never come upon it before and when all of them got up and i told them who watched that and all of them come up to look in but he said while they were looking in he looked out of the corner of his eye i believe it was and watched me i slipped off to one side started going towards the west towards the sitting of the sun going up a hill down a hill going up a hill going downhill getting smaller and smaller and went all the way out of sight and he said then then when i did that he said then the brethren turned around after a while said did he vanish where did he go he said tooks some took out that way some took out one way and some another but very few stayed and looked on to what i told them so so in this in this dream brother braham is standing there and there's the there's a stone which is the word it's got it's got writings in it and he's standing there in the dream interpreting the word to the people and then as he's doing that he grabs this crowbar and he takes he takes the top of the mountain off like the pyramid and the sun had it was shot upon it so now this is the word coming open because remember john john was about to write what those seven thunders were right but he was forbidden to write it so what happened is now the light had never struck there yet it had never become manifest yet until the days of the voice of the seventh angel so brother brown takes the word because that's his commission he opens it to the people takes the book gives it to the prophet he opens it to the people right and and we're instructed now to look upon this look upon this revealed word but then now when the prophet left people are wondering oh where is god now you know oh god seemed to prophet but what's going on now and some people they just wander off on this doctrine or this opinion or this idea they just wonder if it says but very few stayed and looked on to what i had told them right so we want to be the kind of people that stay and look right looking upon the word because remember as we behold him we become him right as we behold the word we become the word amen so we can't just wander off on our own opinions no matter how many quotes are associated with it i mean we want to stay and look i mean so so there's the challenge now because people people can get disenchanted they can you know you know things cannot go their way or something could just happen and they can start to look on other things but we don't want to go down that track we want to stay and look yes now i'm just going to go into because um i think was brother methanol or one of the brothers at camp they they're talking about demon powers fighting now we know that in in heaven before the angels fell um you know before the devils fell they were angels right devils fallen angels now in heaven there's hierarchy of different powers of of angels you know it's not like there's just if i can say it this way michael and gabriel and then there's all the other angels the same no no no there's different powers of angels right just like in just like in the human race you can say there's this uh i hope this doesn't come out wrong but you know there's smarter people there's richer people there's poorer people you know there's different abilities within human beings right we just you can't make yourself einstein you're either born einstein or you're not you know or you can't make yourself bait home and that gift is already within you you know you can't you know i could i could i could spend a life or ten thousand lifetimes trying to play the piano like just a little i'm never going to get there right it's just not in these hands you know but because i'm not made that way right right well i try and learn to sing like analysts i can't do it right no matter how how many how many how many lessons i could ever get it ain't gonna it just ain't gonna ring true so you know because there's different abilities within people just like in angels there's different classes there's different abilities there's different powers and right so now when so when those angels fell they did not lose that power right or that or that strength within the kingdom so so it went from they had a place within heaven's kingdom and then they fell and then now they have a position in hell's kingdom right so this is shown here in daniel 10 because remember we want to be a scripturally trained church that's the only church that will stand in this end time that's where you want to be so so in daniel 10 he says and he said unto me oh daniel this is daniel he's been praying because he wants to know the answer to to the vision or the dream he's just had he says and he said unto me there's the angel coming to him oh daniel a man greatly beloved understand the words that i speak unto thee and stand upright for unto thee am i now sent and when he had spoken this word unto me i stood trembling then he said unto me fear not daniel for i was for from the first day that thou didn't set my heart set thine heart to understand and to chasten myself before thy god thy words were heard and i am come for thy words isn't that amazing god hears as soon as we start amen when we when we set our hearts to understand when we chase ourselves humble ourselves before the lord i mean an answer is actually already on its way i mean but we've got to understand just because the answer doesn't come straight away doesn't mean god hasn't heard our prayer right but it's the enemy trying to stop that answer coming to us so we need to you know we need to keep perseverant in prayer until an answer comes if it's a no praise the lord if it's a yes praise the lord whatever the answer is i'm happy amen i liked how brother cabin said on sunday how brother ferdi's talking about you know their new bodies and their hairstyles and different things and you know brother could be said i'm you know i you know i think it was uh you know i'm open for anything you know i like that kind of answer because it shows you know he doesn't have his mind made up you know a real christian doesn't come to god with his mind made up god does how i want you to do it you know he's just open for god's answer so so i really like that amen so he says now uh verse 13 but the prince of the kingdom of persia was stood me one in 20 days so now that that prince of the kingdom of persia wasn't the literal king of persia right it was the anointing that was upon the kingdom it was that demon power that was upon the kingdom and and so that this this power was stood this angel coming for 20 days and this angel could not bring the answer until a stronger angel came to help him says but lo michael one of the chief princes came to help me and i remained there with the kings of persia now i am come to make the understand uh what shall befall my people in the latter days for yet the vision is for many days so so the you know this so this angel though it's you know one of god's angels one of god's messages a mighty angel was not powerful enough i mean to to to basically push this demon power of the king of persia i mean kingdom of persia aside to bring the answer to daniel though daniel was a true believer seeking god waiting for the answer to come this angel needed a more powerful angel than itself for him to bring the answer to daniel right so we can yeah i'm sure we can just see from this one example that there are hierarchies of angels powers that's right amen and so just because and angel fallon became a demon it's amazing god because god built them a certain way he actually let them with that ability though they have fallen you know just like man you know you take some of the most gifted people in the world right now and you know it blows their mind how they'll solely get sell their life just for a few million dollars and just for a you know a few moments of you know drug fuel destruction upon this earth but yet they have the most powerful gifts many of them started off singing in church choirs and different things but it's amazing when as soon as they took a step towards the wrong god didn't strip them of that power god didn't take their gifts from them he just let them go right along but it just shows we'll have to give an account for the gifts that we have in our lives amen that's right brother amen so now in this in this war that's going on oh yes okay okay so so i'm going to take this sorry as i said in my notes i've just got my slides i actually don't know what slides coming next so i know roughly in my mind because i put it together so um so now when it comes to demon powers there's this just like just like in a natural civilization you know we have our we have our mayor right who's in charge of the city or or councillors who's you know then we have the mayor who's in charge of the city then we have then we have the um mps and we have the prime minister then we have our governor general then there's the queen that's the hierarchy of the of the english or of the new zealand system right of our government now we know some of it's symbolic some of it's not but but there's still a hierarchy and then even even in the law today the governor general can actually dissolve parliament they they have a right to do that and it actually has happened in in australia before where the government general dissolved parliament they actually made the you know you know change of government or whatever because there was trouble going on so even though it appears symbolic there's still some authority in those positions now it's the same thing in demon realms there'll be a demon over a suburb and a demon over a town a demon over a city a demon over a province and a demon over a country and so so here's and there's and there's even brother brown i think he uses the words we'll see in the next slide or two tribes of demons and he says and then so so when i looked at the man so so now this is brother maybe standing on the platform in oregon and that demon possessed man's coming before him he says i'm going to tear you limb from limb you know there's that great challenge going on it says and when i looked at the man i heard myself talking i don't know whether it may sound strange but it was the holy spirit speaking the holy um the bible said take no thought of what you shall say it will be added then and it said because that you have defied the spirit of god tonight you will fall over my feet he said well i'll show you whose food i'll fall over and he drew his great arm back and he started to hit me like that i said satan come out of the man just about like that in the name of the lord jesus and yeah right back to strike and he started going oh and his eyes rolled back he started going around and around and he fell down until he laid across my feet and i couldn't move anyway so there both had made a challenge the spirit of god and the spirit was and the spirit that was in him both of them made a challenge so something had to happen the audience was waiting and the fellow and um and the policeman said is that man dead i said no sir said is he healed i said no sir he worships that spirit he won't give it up see but would you move him off my feet and so then when they got over there i just turned around to the audience i said as i was saying faith is the substance of things hoped for and a man sitting in a wheelchair just raised up in a lady on a stretcher and nowhere everything in there was healed right there and they just packed them away and the next morning was a great big truck going down the street people saying only believe walking behind this great big truck full of stretches and wheelchairs and everything amen now now brother brown shows what it was what was it the chief of that tribe of demons had made the challenge and lost it you see and so that's when the spirit of god struck the building and everything was healed amen so it goes to show that the devil tries to put his spirits upon the people they need to hold back the promises of god but when the chief one is broken all the others run for cover i mean breaks out and he has his full liberty i mean and the people and i pray it's the same thing where you and i are sitting right now i mean the chief i said the chief of this tribe of sin has been broken by the blood of jesus christ i mean you know all superstition all fussing fighting whatever more has been broken we we we are not here to live under our privilege i mean the devil's being defeated i mean i say lord just just just just have free reign in our lives amen hallelujah amen so so so now this was just so so this is just in a tribe of demons a local tribe of demons but now when you take this into a national scene when it comes to wars against countries you know all that is actually two demons fighting we're going to look at this for what it is okay so so now right now in the world the demon that's over russia is fighting over the demon that's over the ukraine they're fighting each other right it's two it's two demon powers clashing he says now we find that because that people do this and cause these great fusses and so forth now as long as satan controls it there's going to be wars and troubles and war jesus said in in saint uh saint matthew 24 said you'll hear of wars and rumors of wars and wars and war why because the prince of the earth the satan the power of the nations is a national spirit here a national spirit adherence devils they can't get along with one another did you ever take a bunch um did you ever take a bunch in the eskimo country up there where they go on dog sleds northern alaska and way up there around in the northwestern territory when the god there was tying off these dogs called huskies and he'd tie one here and taiwan out there and taiwan over here i said why are you doing that he said they're so full of the devil they'll kill one another see just kill that's all they think about well that's the devil you see he's a killer he just the nation just even devils fighting devils see they're just fighting one another amen they're just fighting one another so what's going on in the ukraine and yeah with russia that's just devils fighting devils right because one is trying to usurp the other one wants to dethrone the other so that's just all war is because if man was in his right mind without any demonic influence it'd be peace i believe because no one in their right mind would want to kill another right but as demon power gets on people i mean they you know you know they come under the spirit that's under their country and they just want to kill each other but you know i'm glad we're going to a place where there'll be no more death and no more fighting there'll be no more devils fighting each other they'll be burning that's where they'll be i look forward to that moment hallelujah amen so now this is so so this is this is this is what's going on in warfare but now it's actually the same thing when it comes to an uprising within a country like a revolution that revolution is actually other devils within the country are rising up to try and dethrone the one that's that's controlling the country that's a revolution everyone together right just like the french revolution there was one spirit ruling the country then another spirit rose up and dethroned that other demon power but there was a lot of bloodshed and killing i mean for that to take place so now here's the thing we've got to be very careful in this hour what spirit we let ourselves be used by because the thing is when it comes to a revolution you know jesus says our kingdom my kingdom is not of this world if my kingdom was of this world then my servants would fight right so he's saying now my kingdom is not like the kingdoms of this world where where where because the kingdoms of this world is just demon power fighting each other in jesus day there was the roman demon you know the demon over the roman empire was suppressing the jewish nation right there was a demon power ruling the jewish nation and it was wanting to rise up and take its place again as being you know a free people if i can say it that way i hope this doesn't come out i hope people don't take me the wrong way so now because every nation under heaven is is controlled by the devil jesus jesus was even given them by satan himself during the great you know during his great um trial there in the desert he says you know he showed him all the kingdoms of the world and it wasn't just at that moment it was all down through time so he would have shown him new zealand he would have shown him canada america different part you know china russia all these countries you know he says i'll give these all to you if you just bow down and worship me now jesus did not say to him satan those aren't yours he did not say that he did not challenge that at all he just says no no because he knew he's going to fall into it anyway she says get behind me satan you know you know worship the lord thy gods but the thing is now when it comes to demon powers fighting with the nations we've got to be very careful we don't fall under the influence of that one demon power fighting the other demon power we're going to stay we're going to stay away from that stuff remember look away looking away to jesus right don't look to what's going on in the nation or going on in the world and being caught up in the spirit of it because that's what the devil wants us he wants us to look away to the world god wants us to look away to jesus to him right so so the devil's saying look to me look away from the word look away from your source of strength look away from where you can get your deliverance from and look to me and what is there hatred malice strife envy variance you know false accusers and continent despises those that are good unholy without natural affliction truth breakers false accusers you know that's that's the attributes of being under his his demon influence so it's just demons fighting it's just devils fighting devils no matter how sympathetic we may be no matter how sorry we may feel for those who are fighting right and i'll just talk about our nation for a bit no matter how sympathetic we may feel for for the cause we don't want to get caught up into devils fighting devils the kingdom we are of is not of this world amen now brother anne makes a few statements because i think it's very interesting in this day we must be very careful where we're at this age we live in now if you've already read that well you've already read it but you know i'll read it soon but i want to say this this is the age of people's rights this is lady osea that's the that's the that's the spirit in this world not just one part of the world the whole world so we must be very careful that we don't just have the spirit of ladocia when we kick back against things you know it's all but it's you know and but people can put a religious veil over it but it can just be actually the anointing of laodicea upon a person kicking back against whatever whatever the government's doing we've got to have a real clear motive and objective that's pure before the lord you know we can't just have a rebellious nature that's suddenly found a cause that it can rally to now he says listen once more this is in 1963 after the seals open i'll say where brother brown was a prophet he says but i know that there has to be a law here a fire marshal's law just so many we have to leave so much isles and so forth and they and that they cannot help because that we are as christians we've got to do that for the bible said jesus told us to give caesar those things that pertain to caesar and then to god the things that belong to god so we try to and if we do not obey caesar it's very doubtful we'd obey god and as long as caesar's laws don't interfere with gods we must obey god first and then these fire hazards and so forth well they know how to take care of that and they told us now someone may take this and say well but wouldn't the fire laws actually interfere with gods because it stops people coming into the meetings wouldn't people think that but obviously the prophet of god could see no no this is caesar's laws it's not actually stopping us believing what we believe so it's actually okay he has to render to see the things of the season he says he says if you don't obey caesar it's very doubtful you obey god see i'll say it like this some people just follow the message the part of it that they want to follow the part that they agree with is the part that they follow but the parts they don't agree with well that's your second pull see we don't need to worry about that the word's open yeah we've moved on there's more no no no all of this is actually just an excuse because they just agree with what they want to agree with this is not a smorgasbord religion friends i'm not here just for a part of the i want the whole oh i want the whole land we got we told take the book not just the contents not just the cover and the cover and the maps and the no take the whole book and eat it right the good bits the bad bits whatever bits you think they are you know i like more sweet food people more like savory food but if they're sweet and savory in the book i've got to eat the whole thing right i don't just want to eat the bits you know i i've never made it a rule maybe we should make it a rule but i always you know i made this word up a few years ago and i unfortunately haven't well i shouldn't anyway i shouldn't make it a joke but you know i made this thing called you know we should have something called presert which is dessert before the main right you know if you're a sweet tooth you know i would like that kind of thing but cc because my preference is i have a sweet tooth so i'd rather the sweets and in the main but some people don't like the sweets they just want the main so you know so the thing is analyst agrees with me i go all right now um but the thing is you know you can't just have the bit you want you need the whole you need the whole word you can't just have the bit that caters to your preconceived idea that you already enjoy or maybe you know that you gravitate towards you need the whole thing so i find it very powerful how the brother graham says if you don't obey caesar it's very doubtful you'd obey god amen so lord lord check our motive and objective right now and he says christianity ain't what you say it's what you live it's what you do it's an example you're the salt of the earth i said then the law says jesus says give you give caesar them things that belong to caesar you break the speed law out there what are you doing you're doing wrong you sin give caesar what caesars and gods what's god's well you say well the law is wrong i can't help what wrong it is it's wrong to break jesus commandment and if you do don't give caesar the things that ceases that ceases then you did what jesus told you not to do and the transgression of the law of sin that's right we're all guilty we do it but when you see yourself wrong stop it people are watching you people don't go to church they'll read you see what you do so now the prophet is saying that this word here to give caesar that which is caesar's supersedes amen our opinion of how wrong the law is because we we have to we have to agree there's many laws in this country that are wrong right we may not agree with them all but he says now if you break that law then you're breaking jesus commandment which is higher than the law because he says well the you know because people say well the law's wrong why should we have to have mandates and all this kind of thing he says well sure but i can't help what the wrong is it's wrong to break jesus commandment right so it's wrong to break what jesus has said give to caesar that's which ceases now the reason i believe the whole reason for this is is because if you start breaking the law because you start kicking against authority then you actually fall under a demonic influence that's trying to rise up to dethrone the one over the country already i don't want to join sides with that i want to look away to jesus amen now he says this why did the why did russia wake up why did the nations wake up why has man being able to achieve when scientists 300 years ago french scientists rolled the ball at a certain speed across the earth and proved by scientific research if a man ever made the terrific speed of 30 miles an hour gravitation would take him off the earth according to his weight according to the weight of the ball now he's going 17 000 miles an hour so each still trying to climb on he's just recognized that lately why has to be that way why the church used to stand i mean used to stood on the rock of jesus christ no matter what anyone said they stayed right with that word the message of the hour luther wesley went uh went down sorry and went through there and now they've turned back to traditions what has done it past 25 years israel has worked has recognized that they're in the homeland for something it was prophesied that that have to be gathered again hosea said so we read it a while ago god help us to understand it all right at the same time the bride has recognized the evening light see this is so important friends just to begin to recognize the hungry pentecostals have begun to recognize that their organizations hasn't got anything that they're looking for they're so twisted and tore up see it's a time for recognition recognition you've got to recognize the world has recognized the nations have recognized science is recognized the devil is recognized as time that he can wreck woman wreck the church wreck the people he's recognized it and god has recognized that there's a people on the earth that he's predestinated to life he recognized this is the time to send his message he's did it the people has recognized the bride time has realized the evening light i mean that's why it's so important we can see what all the backdrop is doing but the backdrop is not the main event amen the back you're the backdrop it's just showing where the world is but the reason the world's in this condition is because the bride is in her condition i mean we have recognized the evening light i mean there's transforming power in this world you have any i mean if you could just think about really what happens when we really look away to jesus i mean the power within him i mean what he can do to a life what he has done to our life yeah i'm so glad you always go back to this previous slide how this is he says the bride is beginning has you know where are we the hungry pentecostals have begin to recognize that their organizations i mean are so tore up and things so so he's saying about now he said he says it you know the writers recognize the evening like just begun to recognize friends i'll say we have not just begun to recognize we have recognized i mean we have not just recognized god seen the prophet i remember we've recognized that this word is put on flesh again i mean it's not just flesh in him but it's flesh in you and i i mean the bible is not just in print form it's in you and i i mean manifesting himself the word is put on flesh in your eye i mean to me if we can just recognize this that we're not looking for a great big thing it's happening right now i mean the bride's revival is going on right now amen we're not looking for the opening of the word it's open amen we're not looking for the you know for the fullness of the holy ghost to pour himself into the church it's already going on i mean the god is pouring himself out more and more and more getting us ready amen for the rapture hallelujah is quickening powers becoming more alive more real amen hallelujah this is what's going on but we've got to look away from the world to look to that i mean we've got to look away from what's trending in the world and social media you know different people under delusions writing all kind of nonsense who cares about what they're going to do i'm going gonna i'm gonna touch that next time i speak by the way because that's all about lies but you know forget it forget it i can't help you amen now isaiah the lord says through isaiah tell me tell ye and bring them there yeah let them take counsel together who has declared this from ancient time or who hath told it from that time have not i the lord and there is no god else beside me a just god and a savior there is none beside me look unto me and be ye saved all the ends of the earth for i am god and there is none else so god is saying look you got to look unto me and then here in psalms 121 a song of degrees i'll lift up mine eyes from the hills from whence cometh my health so he's asking so i'm lift lifting my eyes up into the hills from whence comes my help to me it's really a question he answered in his next breath my help cometh from the lord which made the heaven and the earth he will not suffer thy foot to be moved he that keepeth thief will not slumber see our god is not asleep he's not taking a break he's not on a sabbatical he's not journeying somewhere but he's very present in this time of trouble amen he may feel far away but he's not far away behold he that keepeth israel shall neither slumber nor sleep the lord is thy keeper the lord is thy shade upon thy right hand the son shall not smite thee by day nor the moon by night amen the lord shall preserve thee from all evil amen let's just say that he'll preserve me from all evil amen not just some evil all evil he shall preserve thy soul amen my soul is preserved in the lord and the lord shall preserve thy going out my coming in from this time forth even forever more hallelujah amen see the psalmist says he had my help cometh from the lord he wasn't ashamed about that i mean we should we should be able to look straight into the face of the devil and say devil my help cometh from the lord i mean you've come against me you've come against my family but you've got jesus christ on your hands right now i mean brother braham said that if you know the devil comes against any of god's children he's got jesus christ on his hands you better be careful amen amen amen micah says here therefore i will look unto the lord i will wait for the lord i mean i'll wait for the god of my salvation my god will hear me rejoice not against me oh my my enemy when i fall i shall arise when i sit in darkness the lord shall be a light unto me hallelujah amen so don't rejoice devil i shall arise i say the bride is rising right now amen now this is just me where a person looks to is where they draw their strength from so where you really look to where you're i say um i can't remember who said it it was quite a while ago but but your your your crutch your support is really your religion your mind your main support thing so people people will look to all kinds of things and they'll draw strength from it now the word strength is more of a positive word because in actual fact a lot of people look to negative things and they draw i can't say it's strength but they're trying to draw some spiritual sustenance or some kind of nutrients from it so now if people are looking to the news they're actually looking for more than just information but they're looking to draw strength they're looking to draw something you know you know if if this is their main crutch because we know there's nothing wrong with reading the news but some people get so obsessed with it and geoplot um politics and different people's opinions and different things they're actually drawing strength and i'll and actually say it this way if there's if there's something in here drawing it's because it's a spirit in here drawing right so what it feeds on what it feeds on actually dictates what's in here as your source of strength so some people's source of strength will just be they'll just they'll just bury themselves in entertainment that's where they're trying to draw strength from some people bury themselves in social media platforms that's that's where they draw their strength from right some people draw their strength from youtube or tick-tock or something that's where they draw their strength from but they're not getting strength out of it right there's no strength in those things you know some people draw their strength from you know pain they have pain in here so they go via social media other things and they read about other people's pain and they're actually drawing strength it's actually the spirit of them is drawing strength from the other person's pain they're actually worshiping what's what what has happened to them or what they feel they're going through right so people so where people look to us where they draw their strength from but the thing is those kind of things they can't help no one but that's where people think you know but but they have a need in their lives and they try to draw strength from it that's what they're looking to you know we can say we're believers we can say we message believers and praise the lord but the thing is what are we drawing our strength from we've got to be drawing our strengths from the revealed word of the hour because if you look at it now in this in this open book here that we've been we've been given in this day by the seventh angel in this is rapture and this is peace and this is strength and this is joy and this is overcoming power and this is understanding who i am and this helps me to be comfortable in my own skin and this helps me understand everyone else in the body even and this helps me appreciate my family and this helps me to be more long suffering and this gives me a joy that passes all understanding right in this amen and this in this takes away superstition and this takes away your man's opinion and this takes away you know being worried about what everyone else thinks and what's going on in the world all of that is and if you look unto jesus right look away to jesus if you look away from other things because you know you look at someone who's who's got a depressive spirit they withdraw themselves but then they feed that depression on other things because they're trying to draw strength i mean from something but it's that spirit within them is drawing strength from the wrong thing i mean but if the holy ghost is truly within a person amen they they will see actually the only place i can draw strength from is the word of god and they will actually get strength from what they draw from amen you know people who draw their strength from the world they don't get strength right it's like someone who lives on mcdonald's all their lives they're drawing strength from something but there's no nutrients in it it can't sustain them it can't make them stronger it makes them weaker it just ruins their immune system it makes them fatter makes them more lethargic they can't think they have less of a drive these are all been proven things if you've you know i'm probably showing my age but that you know that you know that documentary super size me which came out a few decades ago now the guy lived on mcdonald's for a month any any any documented his physical changes and even his emotional state it just all went downhill see we don't want to be like that but but this thing is people draw their strength from different things and unfortunately it's like living on mcdonald's for a month they become weaker they become less you know they become more lethargic they become more double-minded they become more withdrawn they become more you know you say they become less thankful less appreciative less loving it's all about you know because why they're feeding off the wrong thing i'll say if you're doing that amen don't let your crutch be some little thing on the internet but look away to jesus look away to him because in him you can get life is life and life more abundantly in him you can get joy you can actually draw joy i mean from the rivers of water amen you can draw peace you can draw love you can draw understanding i mean you can draw such a stability oh god you can draw a clear mind i mean you can draw being level headed i mean you can draw i mean real discernment where you can actually people can tell you all kinds of things and actually the discernment of god will say no hold on the spirit behind that amen the intent of that of that of that statement and all that literature is trying to destroy me and and you can discern and withstand it i mean i trust you're all together this morning i mean so i just i want to ask you that question so where are you drawing strength from because it's what you're looking to amen i trust i trust rule we are all drawing our strength from the lord jesus christ the revealed word this day amen he says in the message thirst here by your desire you can tell who is on the throne of your heart by what you love that's what tells see you say well i think them things are all right brother branham well just remember now in your heart you know what's there yes sir by what is feeding your soul what your soul is thirsting for and you can see it satisfies if it isn't a word then there is something wrong because the holy spirit lives on the word only now i just want to say this the devil wants to tell us that there's no fun serving god there is no the devil tries to tell our young people there is no fun there's no satisfaction there's nothing even it's just not cool to serve god i tell you it is the funnest thing to serve the lord amen it is the greatest thing to serve the lord amen to come under his anointing to go to to step into his presence i mean to dwell in his presence i mean is the most satisfying the greatest thing you can ever you can ever be in that the heavenly realm where we're going to be in eternity comes down into your room and you feel his presence amen that that's that's to me that's what serving god's all about i mean there can be the mechanics of reading your bible and praying and going to church and listening to sermons but it's the dynamics that when his holy spirit comes in amen and the word becomes alive and there's just a joy leaps from your heart and it's just so wonderful you sing songs and you hear lyrics you just want to start crying and rejoicing and see see that is the satisfaction amen that comes amen from serving the lord and of course knowing you know where you're going amen when when your life finishes but you see now we want to have the right desire in our hearts don't let the devil derail your desire into something else i say look away to jesus amen now the thing of it is so now now we're going to look at what do people look for because to say look away to jesus now some people have uh many different ideas of what it means to do to look to jesus it depends what you see when you look right now think of it as now now these next few statements are from the message look away to jesus says the thing of it is that people look for those things speeches instead of the word this is what they're looking for the word being manifested is evidence that it's right i mean the word being manifest i mean they'll never look at that they have to have an intellectual conception to know go to the seminary learn how to bow how to stand in one place and and that rule chokes up a minister to death it's really filled with the holy spirit amen now that's intellectual so the evidence i mean the word being manifested is the evidence that it's right hallelujah amen so so when the word because god interprets his word by bringing it to pass amen so he said a virgin shall conceive i mean mary was found with child had had emmanuel when that happened it didn't need no interpretation it came to pass i mean when he said i'll pull my spirit out upon all flesh amen and then my hand made you'll prophesy i've been with dream dreams young men see visions all those things and then we saw on the day of pentecost they meant a bunch of what were acting like drunk people the pillar of fire came down separated himself into 120 upper room they are shouting rejoicing screaming staggering like drunk people i mean that was the interpretation of joel's prophecy it didn't need interpreting god brought it to pass right so now so the word became manifested and that was the evidence that it was right now here we are in this end time and the bride around the world amen is becoming more aware of who she is and we see our lord jesus christ moving more i mean in every service you see camp meetings around the world god moves more in power i mean the young people were becoming more alive on fire i mean the promises are becoming more real i mean the quickening power is moving upon the people i mean the word is more richer it's greater i mean it means more to us we're being molded and shaped into his image what's that that is that is the word becoming manifested i mean that is actually proving that's the evidence that it's right i mean that is proving that there is actually that's the proof that there'll be a restoration the end time is correct hallelujah and we're living in it amen we are living evidence that the word is right because it's being manifested in our lives hallelujah now when moses looked so i've got a couple of pictures here for the children i mean when moses looked amen he looked away because many times we've got to look away from our disappointment we've got to look away from our regret to look to jesus now regret and disappointment can be a real cage but we're going to look away from those things see moses was a backslidden prophet he was he was 80 years on the backside of the desert you know he he he just said well i'm just going to be i'm going to just look after my father-in-law's sheep and i'm just going to raise my children here and this is my portion of life but he knew he was that promised deliverer i mean but he just somehow was willing to live below his privilege and here he was but he looked away from those things and he looked to jesus now we know that the same angel of the lord that was in the burning bush there is the same i mean became flesh you know as jesus christ we understand that right jehovah of the old as jesus of the new so he looked away from his regret and trouble and he looked into the lord and when he looked away to jesus of you know if i can put it that way and he saw everything he needed was in that pillar of fire everything that moses lacked was in that pillar of fire amen he lacked the ability to free his countrymen he lacked the ability to fulfill the prophecy he has ordained to fulfill amen he was ordained to fulfill the prophecy given to abraham that the children of israel amen would would would be in bondage 400 years but then god would bring them out to a mighty hand he couldn't fulfill it in his own ability everything he had needed to fulfill that prophecy was in the burning bush in the pillar of fire and i'll say the same thing with you and i today everything that we lack is in the pillar of fire today amen everything we lack is in him we cannot we are born under prophecy you know that amen hallelujah there's a prophecy that there'll be the lamb's wife the weddings i mean the marriage of the lamb has come and his bride has made herself and unto him was grounded ships should be arrayed and fine and clean and white which is the righteousness of saints hallelujah amen that's a prophecy right we can't fulfill it in our own selves so everything that we lack to fulfill that prophecy that we're born under that prophecy is in the prophet of fire praise the lord amen so he looked away from his his regret and 40 years back son of the desert all those things he looked away to jesus and he saw everything that he had need of was in the pillar of fire i mean moses when he was in egypt he had a choice to make one day while he was the great general in the army he looked out of the same window that pharaoh did pharaoh seen the israelites and of nothing but a bunch of mud dogs but slaves are no good all the egyptians looked upon them the same but moses couldn't see no beauty in them because they were ragged they were poor they were beaten they were rejected people by the world so when moses looked at them he looked he saw something different he saw god's heritage he saw god's promises amen and moses standing with a foot on the throne and yet by faith looked at the unseen moses refused refused to be the son of pharaoh because he knowed he was the son of abraham phew i knew i know you know i'm a fanatic i'm fanatically about one thing that's jesus christ and his promises amen i like that we should be fanatics about jesus christ and his promises moses had rather be a son of abraham than to be the son of pharaoh why he couldn't see it in the natural if he's the son of abraham the muppets was for him the slave whip what was it but he had recompense to the reward for he endured as seeing him who was invisible who made the promise there you are i mean peter looked up peter looked one way one day and when peter walked up into his presence jesus said your name is simon you're the son of jonas he knew right then when he looked the first time on jesus he knew that was the fulfillment of what the word of god said he would be amen i wonder if you found the same thing when you looked at him for the first time i wonder if the promised word manifested itself to you when you looked at him amen when you looked at him did you see you know i trust when you first looked i mean you saw more than a healing ministry you know i trust when you first looked you saw more than a prophet i trust when you first looked you saw more than just a sermon i trust when you first look you saw more than just you know bible days are here again but i trust when you look you you heard the voice behind the voice and you and you heard messiah calling you you heard the very christ of the bible step out of history and manifest himself to you and i i mean i trust that's what when you look away to jesus i trust that's who you see as you see messiah amen living in our midst once again praise the lord i'm sorry but yeah pray for me i'm just running a bit out of steam but but we'll get through now the woman at the well she had a look one time and what did she see she expressed it in the city she said come see a man who told you things i've done isn't this the very messiah when she took her first look at jesus she saw messiah hallelujah i love that amen i trust you see messiah when you see this message more than books and tapes i mean more than good doctrine more than just true bible teaching but i trust you see messiah you see jesus jesus christ himself people can look at the same thing today and call it mental telepathy they call it spiritualism they call it any kind of devil name they can they can call it because they don't know what they're looking for amen what are you looking for i mean i'm looking for rapture i'm looking for the one who died that down calvary i mean i'm looking to meet him in the air i mean i'm looking to see the fulfillment of every promise that god has made i mean i'm looking to see if people made this image i mean i'm looking for messiah the word made flesh that's what i'm looking for amen i wasn't looking for an intellectual church i wasn't looking for a different lifestyle i wasn't looking for just a nice group of people i was looking for jesus christ the god of the bible amen praise god amen people who look at the same thing today so i'm just going to start from here again people who look at the same thing today and call it mental telepathy they call it spiritualism they call it any kind of devil name they can call it because they don't know what they're looking for amen they don't understand they're looking for a creed looking for a jew for a genius to set the church in order they're looking for more members and fail to see the blessed lord jesus christ in his identified word right my lord jesus you know sometimes we can get discouraged after we look and we can try and go back to what we used to do peter when he looked the first time he saw messiah he saw the christ but then even after the resurrection because he was so discouraged in himself and his failure to try and stand for the lord he just said to his disciples let's just go fishing he said i you know i go fishing and they said unto him well we'll go with you and they went forth and entered into a ship and immediately that night they caught nothing it's amazing how the you know god is actually so good to put us on a heap of discouragement sometimes god is so good i mean to put us on some kind of ash heap like peter was put on because he doesn't want us to look away to the world he wants us to look away to him because the reason he wants us to do that is because there is more of him for us that we know nothing about i mean peter was just not that many days from the day of pentecost i mean for the infilling of the holy ghost amen to go from just because remember he knew what it was like to preach under the anointing because he was sent jesus sent him and the disciples and the century off to preach the gospel cast out devils he knew what it was like to heal the sick aiming to preach under the anointing but he didn't realize the greatness of being filled with the presence of god i mean more than an anointing but god dwelling in his in his very soul amen so he got discouraged he says look you know because what happens many times is people we never realize we never think about the valleys and the trials that we will have to go through after we give our lives to the lord he doesn't charge the whole walk amen he gives us a glimpse of glory we see our names written in the land's book of life right we hear from our theophany we know we have an eternal body waiting in the heavens we know it's all there right we know he's going to take us away amen we know we're going in a rapture but he doesn't show us the trials and the deep struggles and the pain and the hurt that we you know that many times we have to go through those things amen we don't we're not showing those things right so what can happen is we can be discouraged by by by those things and it causes us to look to something else and this is what happened with simon peter is because remember this here in john 21 that i didn't read verbatim but but here it is on the screen for you to read you know he he was carrying this weight of discouragement this is like he says how was a lead balloon amen and he didn't know the deliverance from it because he denied the lord three times curse while doing it all those things so there he was living with this thing so he's so he must have thought in his heart because he never would have thought it would have ended up like this jesus being crucified even though jesus told them and you know but their eyes weren't open to it and so so he's walking along with this discouragement and many times we you know if if if if we could write down you know what our christian walk would entail when we start and where we are right now those two lists wouldn't be the same thing in terms of battles and you know things he didn't know these things were going to happen right so he got discouraged so he looked away he says i'm just going to look back to my old life i go fishing but they caught nothing and the lord does that because it because the lord wanted peter to come back to him here's another picture for the children here they are fishing and and it and it's dawn and i don't know if you can see it but you know here just on the seat bank here there's a white figure glory and there's and there's there's a fire there's the lord jesus cooking breeding fish upon the fire and no doubt this is john here on the bow of the ship and he's just told peter it's the lord because i heard that voice from the seashore saying have you caught any fish you know no doubt they were real grumpy when they said no i haven't caught a thing you know and and then john looks again because remember john john is represented in the bible he's like the eagle prophet amen who can look from eternity to eternity and he looked past what peter can see he says it's the lord there on the you know you know on the on the seashore so peter area is jumping out he's jumping out because he looked he looked away to jesus he didn't know how he'd be received when he looked away but he knew he had to go anyway hallelujah there's something about a previous mad seed of god we may miserably fail but there's something within us saying i just want to get back to where jesus is amen so he jumped in the water he swam to where the lord was why what's happened he looked away from his own discouragement in himself in his own disappointment and his own deeds he looked away from those things amen and he looked at jesus and when he looked away and he saw jesus and he went swimming to him amen he was asked those great questions peter do you love me it's so amazing it's such a simple question eh jesus doesn't ask complicated things like what were you thinking what was going through your mind when you did this and what you know they said no do you love me see the lord comes down to the core of the man do you love me peter amen and then so peter says you know you know i love you and then he asked them three times in the third time peter says well peter answered that same thing i just said lord you know i love you amen and peter we know he had to go through those things but he had to look here to look away to jesus amen now hallelujah he had to look away now it's the same thing with us we need to look away to jesus more than ever before i'm just going to wrap up with this statement i think i've got i've got one more slide after this now brother braham says that my purpose is so you know we should we should we should live we need to look away from our feelings sometimes we need to look away from how we feel sometimes we need to look away from those things and look to jesus right because remember we shouldn't live by how we feel we should live by how we what sorry we should we shouldn't live by how we feel we should live by what we believe right so if we feel rejected if we feel despised if we feel misunderstood if we feel this brother did this the sister said this and this and this i'll stay no no we shouldn't or i'm feeling grumpy you know i'm feeling upset we shouldn't live by how we feel because our feelings change like the weather right we should live by what we believe i mean the joy the lord's my strength he saved my soul i'm going to heaven amen we're on the winning side the blood of jesus christ has cleansed me from all sin he's faithful and just to forgive me i mean hallelujah i fear for my theophany i mean my lord is more than enough i love it how the apostle paul says that my sufficiency is of god i mean so what makes me sufficient is my sufficiency is god's own sufficiency i mean so you know we have this sufficiency of the lord amen in this hour he says now my purpose is as we all know by the scripture that divine healing has already been secured for every believer amen hallelujah that makes me happy it's part of jesus suffering he was wounded for our transgressions with his stripes we were healed we are healed for as moses lifted up the bra serpent in the wilderness so must the son of man be lifted up same cause and that was a type christ is the antitype and then if the old atonement could produce healing how much more should the new one a which has the which has got uh better things to produce divine healing now jesus was lifted up for the same cause that the bra servant was he was made sin because the serpent was made out of brass and brass is a symbol of divine judgment and serpent showing the serpent's curse from the garden of eden where sin and sickness entered and jesus cannot nobody cannot preach jesus christ as the atonement without preaching divine healing no one can preach the gospel without preaching divine healing because see you don't he see you don't have to have certain things like if the animal had got a hold of you you don't have to just cut its foot off or cut its arm off or whatever he he's got around you just kill him from the head and you've got it and that's the way jesus did when he died for sin he killed everything that sin ever did he completely redeemed us we're now drawing the remuneration from our great the earnest money of our complete deliverance and his coming again it means we're just drawing the earnest money right now amen of everything he's done so he's completely redeemed us amen as he died down calvary to purchase our salvation who's fully saved not not pastor who's fully saved so if we're fully saved and we're fully healed amen because it's one of the same act amen so that's why we can look away to jesus i mean to look away from our symptoms and our worries and our troubles and our sickness sure they're there but look away from them the world's falling apart we can't put blinkers on and say it's not but we've got to look away from the falling apart of the world and look to the one who can deliver us amen we're going to look away from the shifting sands of man's opinion and look to the one who's a firm solid rock to stand upon which is the word of god amen so i just want to leave it there i want to encourage you all friends look away to jesus amen he's the author and finisher of our faith hallelujah amen so let's just bow heads in the word of prayer uh this morning and then i'm going to turn the service back over to brother armand amen let's pray gracious father how we love you we can look away to you lord so glad lord jesus that you have made yourself so real in this end time lord you've revealed yourself to each and every one of us that we can look away lord many people are trying to look away to other things but lord it's because they don't know they can look to you i'm so glad you opened our eyes that we can look away to you oh god look away from this world and look to you dear god i pray for it lord for each and every one lord jesus who's lord looking away to the wrong things father may you just be merciful to them lord i pray to god that it wouldn't be our hurts or our pain or lord our disposition or whatever it is that makes us look away to the wrong things father may lord jesus you be the one that we're drawing strength from father i pray we just do a quick spiritual health check on ourselves oh god too to just look at the food lord to see the effect of what we're spiritually eating on lord is it making us rejoice is it giving us a real peace no matter how we feel or what trial we're facing is it giving of us a peace and a stability or is it or are we feeding off the wrong things just wearing us down all the time father i want to thank you lord jesus that you're victorious and i just want to address satan say satan take your hands off everyone here in the name of jesus christ take your hands off god's property you're a defeated being and your end is coming very soon and we'll rejoice in that moment our lord jesus defeated you that down calvary and you're still a defeated foe this morning so satan i command you by the blood of jesus christ take your hands off every man woman and child under the sound of my voice for the glory of god dear lord jesus i want to thank you that by your stripes were healed thank you lord that your a rock and a weary land lord you're still that unexhaustible fountain that we can drink from and be satisfied we love you so much dear god i pray father you just touch each

you for this message um whatever reuben was listening to uh informations this week as well and that is just the week before we um there was a big wrong speech that i was talking about uh danny reagan was actually talking about that prince of persia and how gabriel couldn't get there you know he couldn't get there because those those angels were keeping him back and it's just a confirmation that sometimes we don't we don't look to the unseen we look at the obvious but we forget that there's far greater things happening around us and the lord has everything in control so we just thank the lord for his mercy and and i encourage you eat it right eat good eat healthy eat eat what i would say is feed on the word eat the word pray the word forget about the world tick tock youtubes those things
