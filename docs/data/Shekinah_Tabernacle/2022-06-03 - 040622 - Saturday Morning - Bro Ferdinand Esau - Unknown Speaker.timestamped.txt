[7:14] hallelujah
[7:16] [Applause]
[7:17] amen
[7:18] amen
[7:20] well it's
[7:22] it's great to have each and every one of
[7:23] you here
[7:24] it's like to say thank you so much for
[7:26] coming and and
[7:27] bringing a lick of fire
[7:29] to celebrate with us
[7:31] um i just want to read a scripture
[7:35] we're going to read psalms 100
[7:37] you can
[7:38] keep your seats if you wish
[7:40] he says
[7:41] make a joyful noise unto the lord all ye
[7:43] lands serve the lord with gladness come
[7:45] before his presence with singing
[7:47] know ye that the lord he is god it is he
[7:50] that hath made us and not we ourselves
[7:52] we are his people and the sheep of his
[7:55] pasture i trust that will be
[7:57] that's that's the theme of our
[7:59] fellowship here it's not man's doing
[8:02] or human ability it's god it's been the
[8:04] lord the whole time enter into his gates
[8:06] with thanksgiving and into his courts
[8:08] with praise be thankful unto him and
[8:10] bless his name for the lord is good his
[8:13] mercy is everlasting and his truth
[8:14] endureth to all generations
[8:18] amen praise the lord
[8:19] i pray that you know brother brown would
[8:21] make some comments i used to think that
[8:23] a juniper tree was a bad thing to be
[8:25] under it's actually a very good thing to
[8:26] be under
[8:28] and uh he would speak here this and what
[8:30] heroes are elijah says elijah rubbing
[8:32] his eyes raising up a little frail
[8:34] shaking hands took a hold of the bread
[8:36] and eat it and then the great angelic
[8:38] choir came out formed a little panoramic
[8:40] around him like that and began to sing
[8:42] the songs like no mother could coo her
[8:45] baby to sleep
[8:46] let him sleep again then father turned
[8:48] around said you know i love him so much
[8:50] the journey's great he has had
[8:53] a lot to go through with yet i'm not
[8:55] through with him i must feed him again
[8:57] so he called the angels and dumped in
[8:59] another big bundle of vitamins and
[9:01] cooked up another corn cake and sent him
[9:04] a cruise of water and stroked his brow
[9:06] and fed him again he says i'm so glad
[9:09] that there's a juniper tree when we all
[9:11] get war and tore up we can go under that
[9:13] juniper tree and find spiritual vitamins
[9:16] to travel any kind of a trip
[9:18] we've been through a journey all of us
[9:20] this last 10 years has been a phenomenal
[9:22] time
[9:23] but i pray that whatever you know we may
[9:26] feel wore out stress troubled whatever
[9:28] it is but i pray that this would be a
[9:30] juniper tree time where we leave this
[9:32] with strength for the to continue on in
[9:34] the journey that the lord will send his
[9:37] greatest angels rub your brow you know
[9:39] refresh you
[9:40] serve you the best angelic food
[9:43] of god's word
[9:46] and he says this here that um
[9:50] this is another uh what here if they are
[9:52] elijah again he says and he was wore out
[9:54] his nerves were all on edge and just
[9:57] like the people today we needed juniper
[9:59] tree i preached to tired people nervous
[10:01] people pray for nervous people and it's
[10:03] a nervous neurotic upset world right now
[10:05] that we're living in if he said that in
[10:07] 1959 how much more in 2022
[10:10] uh everybody's just on the edge so as to
[10:13] say or to speak it's like it's like just
[10:16] any little thing so upsets them god's
[10:19] people is that way so he's not just
[10:20] speaking of the world he speaks god's
[10:22] people's that way too it doesn't mean we
[10:24] don't have the victory doesn't mean we
[10:25] don't have eternal life but we know
[10:26] we're built to the same material that
[10:28] the world is as well
[10:29] i mean the world is that way we all need
[10:32] a juniper tree a place to rest he says i
[10:34] trust that this convention will be a
[10:37] juniper tree
[10:39] and i pray that this time here will be a
[10:41] juniper tree for all of us we'll walk
[10:43] out of this place refresh renew
[10:45] reinvigorated in the holy ghost
[10:48] amen and you know what i what i
[10:50] appreciate sure you know the so so the
[10:52] brothers who are ministering got brother
[10:53] ferdi this morning we have brother
[10:55] taswell tonight and brother freddie this
[10:57] sunday morning then brother alpha sunday
[10:59] afternoon and you know some people think
[11:01] well it's like a political thing two
[11:03] churches basically together but it's not
[11:04] that way i trust we've gone beyond
[11:06] carnal ideas of man
[11:08] but the reason i ask them to preach is
[11:10] because they've been very important and
[11:12] key parts of our growth as a church
[11:14] and so i felt that was very important
[11:16] but
[11:17] what i love about
[11:19] ministers is they don't know what you're
[11:21] going through but god knows all about
[11:22] you
[11:23] and you know
[11:25] brother abraham said in christ is
[11:26] mystery god revealed he says he said the
[11:28] pregnant person with the seed of god the
[11:31] word and they're manifesting itself so
[11:33] surrendered to the will of god that the
[11:35] word and the word alone manifests itself
[11:37] in that person the prisoner to an
[11:39] individual and he says that he says a
[11:41] person could be so yielded to god
[11:44] that god the word has prominence in that
[11:46] man
[11:47] and the and then there's the discerning
[11:49] of the thoughts and tense of the hearts
[11:51] manifest through that person so god can
[11:53] speak to our address today he can come
[11:56] right down
[11:57] your life maybe go past through the past
[12:00] 10 years of your life and speak to every
[12:02] situation
[12:03] god can do that
[12:04] and i and i pray we're under expectation
[12:07] i want to i want to touch from god i i
[12:10] have a need i i want more of him
[12:12] and this is why i've come
[12:14] to these meetings that the lord would
[12:16] speak to my life and touch me
[12:18] amen you know what i love about this
[12:20] weekend it seems to be uh it's nice how
[12:22] god does things you know this weekend is
[12:24] 50 days after easter
[12:26] so it's pentecost it just happened that
[12:29] god arranged it this day i believe
[12:32] so we celebrate easter
[12:34] but it's that quickening power that came
[12:36] on the day of pentecost the abstract
[12:37] title deed came down struck off all of
[12:39] the claims the devil had on the people
[12:42] and this message takes us back to a true
[12:44] not a denominational but a true
[12:45] pentecost
[12:47] so i pray this will be a pentecost
[12:48] weekend we're going to refill us with a
[12:51] fire of the holy ghost the word will put
[12:53] on flesh like never before this message
[12:55] will live in a people that's what i'm
[12:56] looking for
[12:58] so i'm believing that's going to happen
[12:59] to us
[13:01] amen so god bless you we love you thank
[13:03] you so much brother malcolm so good to

[18:46] people fellowshipping inside that if we
[18:48] are congregating in the foyer area to
[18:50] keep it down or to take it away from the
[18:52] doors so it'll be comfortable for
[18:54] everyone that's inside here
[18:56] mothers and babies there's a mother's
[18:58] room at the back

[19:16] by the time we finish off here we'll be
[19:17] leaving here about 2 30 lunch will be
[19:19] cold so we won't go there we'll just
[19:21] stay for three o'clock service because

[20:21] god bless you all amen
[20:23] [Applause]
[20:32] praise the lord it's wonderful to see
[20:34] all of you this morning
[20:36] and
[20:37] we are going to be in for a fantastic
[20:39] time of fellowship in christ for this
[20:42] weekend this is going to be the best
[20:44] weekend you've ever had in your life
[20:48] that's what it's going to be
[20:49] and
[20:51] the lord is going to pour out his spirit
[20:53] upon us in a powerful way
[20:55] the ministry is going to be anointed as
[20:57] it's going to be speaking as if it was
[20:58] the oracles of god speaking to us
[21:01] we didn't come here just to
[21:03] not get something
[21:05] we came here to receive from christ and
[21:06] if we're under expectation then we will
[21:08] receive the lord's got so much for us
[21:10] yes he has so much that he wants to give
[21:12] us
[21:13] he wants to give it to us more than what
[21:15] we want to receive it
[21:16] that's that's that's not just saying
[21:18] that for a line to say here that's
[21:20] actually the way that it is he's so
[21:22] desperate to pour out his spirit upon us
[21:24] and to fellowship with us if he went
[21:26] through all the effort
[21:27] all the effort that he made
[21:29] to to reveal who he was and to come and
[21:32] die on the cross and all that he he
[21:33] didn't do that just so that at the end
[21:35] it could be a
[21:36] just average he did that so that he
[21:38] could fellowship back with us
[21:40] and he did that so we could be here and
[21:41] meet him the whole plan of salvation is
[21:44] for this moment right here this is it so
[21:47] we are going to have such a good time in
[21:48] the lord and
[21:49] and i we really do sincerely appreciate
[21:51] everyone here that's that's um
[21:53] you're all fellow laborers in the gospel
[21:55] you know from different fellowships we
[21:57] all we all labor in our different areas
[21:59] and serve the lord in our different ways
[22:01] in different places so there are local
[22:03] people here which this is our
[22:06] like our uh
[22:07] our um vineyard area that we're looking
[22:10] after and you're you've all got your
[22:12] different areas but we're all fellow
[22:13] laborers in the gospel and
[22:15] you support us we support you and on
[22:17] this occasion you are coming here and
[22:19] supporting us and and what we are doing
[22:21] and showing your appreciation for us and
[22:23] we're so grateful for that
[22:25] and the song service
[22:27] for this weekend is going to be
[22:31] a little bit different because what we
[22:32] are going to do is um as a as a church
[22:35] band different ones we've actually
[22:38] written quite a few songs over the years
[22:39] that shekinah has
[22:41] [Music]
[22:43] written you know different folk would
[22:44] get inspired to write this song and that
[22:46] one and they
[22:47] they have come out over the years and
[22:49] they've been
[22:50] a little um
[22:52] markers on our journey that maybe in
[22:53] this time the church was going through
[22:55] this and then this song came out then
[22:56] that's next time this song came out here
[22:58] and there
[22:59] so we thought it would be just because
[23:01] this is like our anniversary we're like
[23:03] you know what let's just do our songs
[23:06] is that all right
[23:11] some of them you will know and some of
[23:12] them you won't
[23:14] but i think you'll be blessed and i
[23:16] before we do each one i don't want to
[23:18] talk between each song but i just want
[23:19] to say a bit about each um you know if
[23:22] we're going to do a segment of songs i
[23:23] just want to explain a bit about what
[23:24] what these songs were who wrote them and
[23:26] what they mean to us
[23:27] um
[23:28] because i think when you know the story
[23:29] to it it just gives it a bit more impact
[23:32] um
[23:33] so the
[23:34] way we're only going to do four per
[23:36] service because we've got some fantastic
[23:37] specials throughout in the service too
[23:40] just letting you know we've got the
[23:41] doves medley first then we've got the
[23:44] eagles
[23:45] then we have got sister amy and sister
[23:48] kim after that so those are the three
[23:49] specials
[23:50] this morning
[23:52] um
[23:53] but the the two praise songs that we've
[23:55] got the first song we're going to do is
[23:57] a song called lead me to the rock who
[23:58] wants to be led to the rock
[24:00] amen and this song was actually written
[24:03] by brother andy
[24:05] stand up brother andy
[24:09] [Music]
[24:12] [Applause]
[24:16] we were actually at the notes for
[24:18] christmas i think and brother andy went
[24:19] up and through the bush area that
[24:22] brother matu has there that he
[24:24] you've got to be careful when you walk
[24:25] up there because he he he walks his dogs
[24:27] out there every morning and they kind of
[24:28] do what they do
[24:30] every morning so
[24:31] you go there to have some quiet time
[24:33] when you're kind of
[24:33] [Music]
[24:35] stepping in places you regret but um
[24:37] andy brother andy went up there and he
[24:39] said the lord just gave him these words
[24:41] and it was lead me to the rock that is
[24:42] higher than i
[24:44] lead me to the lord most high
[24:48] and he he pinned out basically the whole
[24:50] song up in the bush here and he had it
[24:51] he had a bit of a tune roughly so so he
[24:54] came into the lounge here and he said oh
[24:55] isaac i've got this
[24:57] all these words and i've got this little
[24:58] tune maybe it goes like this and so we
[25:00] sat down there on the couch and
[25:01] and within about maybe 45 minutes i
[25:03] suppose the song was in existence lead
[25:06] me to the rock it all just kind of came
[25:07] together so that was the first one and
[25:09] then the next one we're going to do
[25:10] after that is a song called go tell john
[25:13] and
[25:14] this is a song um
[25:18] you know when when john was in prison he
[25:21] got a bit despondent he said uh he said
[25:23] go he says his disciples go on ask jesus
[25:26] is it you or should we look for another
[25:27] maybe it was under his juniper tree you
[25:29] know is it you do look for another
[25:31] and jesus just said go tell john that
[25:35] the lame walk the blind sea
[25:37] the death here the
[25:39] those that are in prison are free he
[25:40] said the interpretation is it's
[25:43] happening
[25:44] it's it's see the interpretation of the
[25:46] word of god is that it comes to pass so
[25:48] it's like you don't have to worry
[25:49] anymore john
[25:50] it's actually the evidence is that it's
[25:52] happening that's how you know it's true
[25:53] because it's unfolding of itself you
[25:55] don't need to worry about it and
[25:56] and the song is based around that one
[25:59] that was one of my ones um

[53:55] were all gathered around him
[53:58] as a boy in the temple
[54:02] speaking with such wisdom
[54:05] they were all amazed at what he said
[54:11] and in the middle of it
[54:17] there was
[54:22] jesus the one crying in the wilderness
[54:27] joined the baptizer
[54:30] he spoke of one who was to come
[54:34] baptizing with fire
[54:37] when john baptized him
[54:40] the heavens were opened
[54:44] and caught descended like a duck

[54:55] there was jesus
[54:58] [Music]
[55:08] [Music]
[55:12] to bring life to his daughter
[55:15] he spoke with authority
[55:18] straight from the father
[55:22] no one could explain away his powers
[55:28] and in the middle of it all
[55:34] there was jesus
[55:40] and on a hill just outside of town
[55:44] a man hung there
[55:46] bleeding dying for the souls of men to
[55:51] captives bring freedom
[55:54] but three days later
[55:57] his tomb was empty
[56:01] he conquered death and the grave
[56:06] and in the middle of it all
[56:12] there was jesus
[56:19] so no matter what you're facing
[56:22] no matter where you've been
[56:26] in hot times or in good times
[56:29] keep your eyes on him and in the heat of
[56:33] the battle

[57:52] it but he's always there and he loves
[57:54] you and he cares for you with all of his
[57:56] heart there is no intention inside of
[57:58] him that wants your destruction

[58:02] that's all he wants for mankind if we
[58:04] just receive it he's got so much to pour
[58:05] out upon us
[58:06] amen let's just um
[58:08] we'll stand this morning the um we'll
[58:10] just sing a few worship songs
[58:12] um
[58:13] so the two
[58:14] that we're going to sing this morning
[58:15] the first one
[58:17] the first song is a song called you
[58:18] chose me
[58:19] and um
[58:21] this one i got the verse for the song
[58:24] a few years back and it was one of those
[58:26] ones that were just sitting in the back
[58:27] of my mind and then
[58:29] one time i was sitting in the my office
[58:32] and i just started playing the song and
[58:33] then it came to the pre-chorus but and i
[58:36] i remember being in there tears
[58:38] streaming down my face when i
[58:40] i was just singing the words and you
[58:42] bore my sin on your shoulders when you
[58:44] could have had it all you chose me to be
[58:46] the one that you would die for the one
[58:48] that you would save it was a
[58:51] i enjoyed the writing experience of this
[58:53] one because
[58:56] it meant something to me you know when
[58:57] you think about what the lord did for me
[58:59] and the other one we're going to do
[59:01] after this
[59:03] is a song called
[59:04] not today and this song it was a unique
[59:07] song um it's the only time i think that
[59:09] it's happened like this but um
[59:12] it was a church service and
[59:14] we had a normal service and brother ben
[59:16] was ministering i shouldn't say normal
[59:17] services or powerful service actually a
[59:19] very powerful service and um
[59:21] throughout the service the song was just
[59:23] coming in the back of my mind as the
[59:25] service was progressing i felt bad
[59:27] because i'd have to i'd be writing down
[59:28] things during the service
[59:30] but um
[59:33] i wouldn't usually
[59:35] do this but i just felt like you know
[59:37] i'm going to go out there and say let's
[59:38] just sing the song that i've just had
[59:40] coming during the service i didn't even
[59:42] know how the chords went or anything i
[59:43] was just assuming it would be like maybe
[59:45] c then f then d thinking in my mind
[59:48] but
[59:49] we we got up and we did it after the
[59:51] service and it was a very powerful time
[59:53] um maybe went off half an hour or 45
[59:55] minutes i've just um
[59:56] so so this was one of those different
[59:58] ones the verses i wrote later but the
[59:59] chorus just came
[1:00:02] like this you know and then by the end
[1:00:03] of the service we're singing it so um
[1:00:06] yeah we hope i trust these to be a
[1:00:07] blessing to you we'll just sing these
[1:00:08] two and then have brother ben up
[1:00:11] amen
[1:00:14] uh
[1:00:17] [Music]
[1:00:39] nails got hands
[1:00:42] and
[1:00:43] thorny bands
[1:00:46] were
[1:00:47] in
[1:00:48] not
[1:00:49] for your love for me
[1:00:54] unfailing
[1:00:56] love
[1:00:57] that shows calvary
[1:01:00] [Music]
[1:01:02] then such
[1:01:07] condemned desires
[1:01:10] [Music]
[1:01:17] [Music]
[1:01:22] it took my place
[1:01:26] he took my place
[1:01:31] [Music]
[1:01:42] [Music]
[1:01:51] you chose me
[1:01:52] to be
[1:01:53] the one that you would die for

[1:37:43] africans you're just noisy
[1:37:46] i know that
[1:37:47] you know i know you say brother i'm just
[1:37:49] a i'm just a a i'm just a kiwi
[1:37:52] i'm just a kiwi brother and we kiwis we
[1:37:54] don't give we don't express our emotions
[1:37:58] i know that devil
[1:38:00] you know what i mean and so people think
[1:38:03] because we're from africa we make a

[1:41:12] thousands and thousands 10 000 times a
[1:41:15] thousand times a thousand you mathematic
[1:41:18] mathematicians calculate that

[1:41:49] i'm just following the lord amen
[1:41:53] amen but i also want to say we're not
[1:41:57] pentecost that gets emotional
