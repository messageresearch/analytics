[6:30] good.
[6:32] This one here is not going this up here.
[6:34] Can you
[6:37] Praise the Lord. It's good to be here.
[6:38] It's good to um be able to
[6:42] um have an opportunity to be amongst
[6:45] people that have surrendered their life
[6:48] to the word of God and to the spirit of
[6:51] God. And that
[6:54] as a result the presence of God dwells
[6:57] in you and around you. And so when when
[7:00] we come here we feel we [music] create
[7:01] an atmosphere because the spirit of God
[7:04] is amongst each one of you and you're
[7:06] all like coals and embers that when we
[7:09] come together with the whole place gets
[7:10] warm. You know you notice some when we
[7:11] have like last week was such a powerful
[7:14] service. you know, and by the end of the
[7:15] by the end of the service, the whole
[7:16] place is just on fire with the spirit of
[7:18] God and the presence of God is there.
[7:19] And it's it's just like that. And that's
[7:21] what we that's what we want. Um that's
[7:24] what we desire. You know, we we
[7:26] we people have got ideas and things, but
[7:28] ultimately we want the word of God to
[7:29] come into our heart and we want the the
[7:31] spirit of God to just touch our life and
[7:33] to to refresh us. [music] You never come
[7:36] out of the refresh out of the presence
[7:38] of God disappointed. You always come out
[7:39] happy. So let's um let's stand this
[7:41] morning and just um commit this time to
[7:43] the Lord. Heavenly Father, we're
[7:44] grateful, Lord, that we can come each
[7:46] with our lick of fire, each with the the
[7:48] part of you that's in us, Lord, and come

[8:08] your word, faith in you, faith in
[8:10] everything you've said, Lord. Lord, we
[8:12] thank you for this blessed hope that we
[8:13] have, Lord, that this world is not our
[8:15] home that we're just passing through,
[8:16] Lord. That there's there's more to
[8:17] [music] it than just what we see around
[8:19] us, Lord, but there's an eternal

[12:01] Amen. [music] Lead me to the rock. I
[12:03] feel like moving around, but I feel
[12:04] slightly restricted. It's rather
[12:06] annoying. You can move around for me.
[12:08] Okay.
[12:11] &gt;&gt; You don't know what you've got till it's
[12:12] gone.
[12:15] Years
[12:23] [music] and years I labor
[12:27] toil and tears for my me
[12:32] since my [music] destiny prisoner.
[12:37] Don't need [music] a slave.
[12:42] But every day that I saw you
[12:48] was [music] growing closer
[12:53] was the longest
[12:57] I
[12:58] sound
[13:00] when [music] I
[13:04] [singing]
[13:07] [music]
[13:09] was free. Heat. Heat. Heat. [singing]
[13:13] [music]

[13:37] The enemy had me stumbling in darkness.
[13:42] [music]
[13:43] Spirit should save her.
[13:47] [music]
[13:48] Then I heard the prophet speaking.
[13:53] I heard the voice behind [music] the
[13:55] door.
[13:57] He opened up the word and let [singing]
[13:59] the light shine in.
[14:02] Said you know [music]
[14:05] when I heard when I heard you [music]

[16:10] has set me free.
[16:15] Amen. You're a free people this morning.
[16:17] Amen.
[16:20] Where do I go
[16:23] when [music] there's no one else
[16:25] [singing] to turn? Who do I talk to?
[16:30] Oh, [music and singing] when no one
[16:32] wants to listen. Who do I lean [music]
[16:35] on?
[16:37] Oh, [singing] when there's no foundation
[16:40] stable, [music] I know he is able. I go
[16:43] to the rock. I go to the rock.
[16:47] I go to the rock of [music] my
[16:50] salvation. I go to the stone that build.
[16:55] I run to the mountain and [music] the
[16:58] mountain says [singing] my
[17:02] earth all around me sinking sand.
[17:05] [music and singing] On Christ the solid
[17:08] rock I stand. When [music] I need a
[17:11] shelter, when I need a friend, I go to
[17:14] the road.
[17:17] Where do I hide
[17:21] when the storms [music]
[17:22] [singing] have all my soul? Where do I
[17:25] run to
[17:28] [music] when the [singing] waves of
[17:30] sorrow?
[17:32] Is there a refuge
[17:36] in the time [music and singing] of
[17:38] tribulation
[17:42] consolation? I go to [music] the rock.
[17:47] I go to the rock of my
[17:49] [music and singing] salvation. I go to
[17:51] the stone that is rejected. I run to the
[17:56] mountain [music]
[17:57] and the mountain stands by me.
[18:02] [music] The earth all around me sinking
[18:05] sand on priceless [music and singing]

[19:03] The earth all around me seeking sand
[19:06] [music]

[19:13] [music and singing]
[19:17] The earth around the earth around

[19:23] the solid rock I stand. When I [music]
[19:28] need a shelter, when I need a friend, I
[19:31] go to the rock.
[19:36] Amen. You can um you can take your seats
[19:38] this morning.
[19:40] I'm just going to put this here. I've
[19:42] just got a little testimony that I'd
[19:44] like to um share with you for five
[19:46] minutes if that's all right. It's um
[19:52] I'm a very shy person naturally. I'm and
[19:54] I'm a I'm a I'm a natural loner,
[19:58] believe it or not. Like I could I if I
[20:02] had it my way, I'll be up in the bush
[20:04] with nobody just
[20:06] doing not much. Okay. But so this whole
[20:10] life that I live is not by choice
[20:12] [laughter]
[20:13] being up here doing all this. So you end
[20:15] up to be like a bit of a you do sort of
[20:16] a lot of public stuff which is not
[20:18] really my thing but I've accepted over
[20:20] the years that that's the way it is. So
[20:21] then you have to do it. So um I just
[20:25] want to share a little testimony about
[20:27] this stuff like this cuz I kind of stuff
[20:28] happens to me publicly and I it's but
[20:30] it's to you know I want to give the Lord
[20:32] glory for it and and it seems to be just
[20:35] the way that works. So,
[20:38] does that work there? Okay. Um, you
[20:41] know, I've been working on this film for
[20:44] about it would be 5 years in, uh, like
[20:48] January, so in another two months, it's
[20:51] been like a 5year project to make this
[20:53] certain film. So, um, I can click it. Um
[20:58] so 2021 that let's say January I started
[21:02] writing a script for it and I had an
[21:05] idea before that but I wrote that till
[21:07] about took about 6 months to write the
[21:08] script and then I we did all the
[21:10] pre-production planning and planning
[21:13] about 30 or 40 different locations and
[21:16] 97 1970s props and everything you could
[21:18] imagine. We're going flat out doing
[21:20] that. And then we all through 2002 we
[21:23] film this
[21:25] and I edit the whole thing, most of it.
[21:27] Then we we do little pickup shots in
[21:30] September and like the stuff even did
[21:31] that in September of that year. And um
[21:35] and then we we shot the last big scene
[21:39] which was a World War II scene in
[21:42] January of um
[21:44] 2023.
[21:46] And we get everything we need for it.
[21:49] You know, like this this thing costs
[21:51] well in the uh uh
[21:54] 1 2 3 4 5 six figures well into it. But
[21:56] we get everything we need to do it. But
[21:58] then it all just comes to a grinding
[22:00] halt. Like this whole project just was
[22:02] and it and life as I knew it came to a
[22:05] grinding halt for like I couldn't do
[22:07] anything for like two years. It was just
[22:08] like and this so this this project was
[22:11] kind of like essentially I almost gave
[22:14] up and it was like it was dead. It's
[22:15] like man I came that far then it was
[22:16] just like this dead project. So for two
[22:18] years it was just like I could not get
[22:20] this thing to move
[22:22] and then uh till the start of this year
[22:24] it was I don't know something just you
[22:26] just keep going and going and then cuz I
[22:28] think I told you that before you just
[22:29] get told to walk forward. So I and I
[22:34] this year we we we started the um I
[22:37] thought we're just going to get this
[22:38] thing done somehow someway. I talked to
[22:40] Jess and we were just going to like
[22:41] we'll figure something out. Um, so we
[22:43] did this fundraising little campaign.
[22:45] What we got from that was nothing like
[22:47] what we needed. It was not even going to
[22:49] be a drop in the bucket, but we did it
[22:50] anyway. It's more of a I think I did it
[22:52] more of a thing for me to at least feel
[22:53] like I'm getting somewhere on it, but I
[22:55] knew it wasn't really going to achieve
[22:56] anything on the grand scheme of it. Um,
[22:59] but you know the story the the we ended
[23:01] up getting a the main cost was VFX and
[23:02] we ended up getting this become a good
[23:04] friend of mine who we this Academy
[23:06] Awardw winning VFX guy did all the VFX
[23:07] essentially for free and then we had
[23:09] enough to the sound guys were doing
[23:10] their thing and the and then we had
[23:12] enough because he didn't charge anything
[23:13] we had enough to sort the sound out and
[23:16] then sort the colorist out which are the
[23:17] three we need VFX sound and color were
[23:20] the three big things we needed right so
[23:22] so we had all those components in place
[23:25] and so that's been I've been at that all
[23:27] year happening thing each week I've been
[23:29] doing stuff and guys have been doing
[23:31] this and that since yeah for the whole
[23:33] year and um
[23:36] now we've got um
[23:40] and then I I locked in a date of when
[23:42] this thing was going to be finished and
[23:44] screened right which was 19th of
[23:47] December and the 21st of December was
[23:48] the the screening date for this thing
[23:51] because when you lock a date in then you
[23:53] have to finish it and and this this
[23:55] isn't really a like this is it's not a
[23:57] massive a big deal. It's not like a big
[23:59] blockbuster, but but we've booked um
[24:01] we've booked the cinema in Wellington,
[24:02] which was the biggest one we could get
[24:03] for that date, and we've booked this one
[24:05] here in Masterton, which was the biggest
[24:07] one we could get there. So, we booked
[24:08] the biggest cinemas cuz these and these
[24:10] cinemas, as we speak, are like there
[24:12] every seat's taken in these cinemas to
[24:13] watch this film. That's [snorts]
[24:16] that's happening in like three or four
[24:18] weeks, the screen. So, this is like a
[24:20] this is an event. It's not like, oh, if
[24:22] we don't get it, if we don't meet the
[24:23] deadline, it doesn't matter. It's like
[24:24] there's hundreds of people turning up to
[24:26] watch this thing. It's like this. So,
[24:28] but I kind of had this
[24:31] I had this idea about two weeks ago. I
[24:34] was like, I think I'll just go cuz I've
[24:35] got to deal with other stuff. I haven't
[24:37] been paid for about 2 years. I might
[24:38] might go and earn some money. I think
[24:39] I'm a bit over not being not having any
[24:41] money. So, I like flag. I'll just go
[24:43] flooring and I'll deal with this um film
[24:46] stuff on the side at nights and stuff,
[24:48] you know. I was like I'd do flooring for
[24:50] 12 months and at least be like a normal
[24:53] man, go to work in the morning,
[24:55] [laughter]
[24:55] get paid.
[24:57] Um, so I did that for two weeks and that
[25:01] these there were guys working on the
[25:03] film just doing their thing and I was
[25:05] just kind of keeping up. I I did know
[25:07] what was going on cuz I I had my finger
[25:08] on the pulse. I it's not like I left it
[25:10] to the side. I was they were doing their
[25:11] thing. Um, so I thought and then then
[25:16] two weeks into it, I had big big big
[25:17] plans and then this happened to me,
[25:19] which was this. So, and it essentially
[25:23] ruined all my plans. I'm like, I was
[25:24] just getting into this new found way
[25:26] that I was doing things. This has just
[25:27] ruined everything. I can't floor like
[25:29] that, and I can't do much like that. And
[25:30] it's like, you know, and you you you
[25:35] wonder, you think, this is kind of
[25:37] strange. just like I I kind of had this
[25:38] planned everything was going to work out
[25:40] and I was going to do these things but
[25:42] it but you know you just think oh the
[25:44] Lord's got some sort of plan which is
[25:45] what I was actually texting I think it
[25:46] was brother John Andy's at the time we
[25:48] were texting about something and I said
[25:48] oh it's all right the Lord's got a plan
[25:50] a better plan than what I've got anyway
[25:52] so but
[25:55] I have to say that happened on a Sunday
[25:58] and then on the Monday I stayed home and
[26:00] thought well I can't do anything now I
[26:01] might as well just work on the film
[26:02] full-time cuz we're showing it in a
[26:04] month you know I better look into this
[26:05] thing get it sorted
[26:07] And and it was
[26:10] um after only a day of I just was home
[26:14] all day and I was working on it and
[26:15] working with this this sound guys and
[26:17] then within about 24 hours it dawned on
[26:20] me actually these I don't want to I'm
[26:22] not going to tell you who these guys are
[26:23] cuz I don't want to I'm not going to
[26:24] talk bad about people but this
[26:26] particular sound company I realized that
[26:28] they cannot pull off what they said they
[26:30] were going to pull off and and they've
[26:31] been they have been they might hear this
[26:33] so I won't say too many bad things but
[26:36] it's been
[26:37] It hasn't been pleasant, right, from for
[26:39] a year. But like they could not pull off
[26:42] what they said they could pull off and
[26:44] it was going to be to a substandard
[26:47] like and I didn't actually know this cuz
[26:49] they were kind of like it was all sort
[26:50] of like they were they they they didn't
[26:53] know how to do it essentially. They know
[26:55] how to do some stuff but this major
[26:56] componentry which is all the foley and
[26:58] this proper stuff that makes the film
[26:59] come to life in the sound department
[27:01] they could not do it. They did not know
[27:02] what they were doing but they didn't
[27:03] tell us that. And I was waiting for
[27:05] stuff and I was putting the pressure on
[27:06] to find stuff. But it was through being
[27:07] home for that day and into the next day.
[27:09] I thought like like I got mental
[27:11] clarity. I thought I've got to stop this
[27:13] right now and change everything because
[27:14] this is not going to happen. Like these
[27:17] guys are not going to do it and we're
[27:18] going to go to the screening and it's
[27:19] just going to be it it's going to be
[27:21] rubbish. You know, like people are going
[27:22] to watch it and go, "What was that? The
[27:24] sound is massive in film." And um
[27:29] and yeah, it just happened that on that
[27:31] the next day there was a guy I was going
[27:33] to use over in um Bulgaria. He's done
[27:35] stuff for me before. And he he said I
[27:37] said, "I need help, man. I'm in a total
[27:39] pickle here. I need I need this done in
[27:40] like three or four weeks." And he he
[27:43] said, "Look, it's your lucky day. I've
[27:44] got nothing on right at the moment. I've
[27:45] got a month spare." He's got his whole
[27:47] company. This is how in dire straits we
[27:49] were. He's got his whole company working
[27:51] on the film. So that happened on the
[27:53] 21st. He's going to struggle to get it
[27:56] to me on the ETH, which in film you need
[27:59] to export out all these DCPs, which what
[28:01] is what the theater plays. And these are
[28:02] massive files. They take like a day or
[28:03] two to even you push export, you know,
[28:06] and it takes like a day or two to export
[28:08] this thing out. You got to wait for it.
[28:09] Then if it's wrong, you got to do it
[28:10] again. You don't get many chances at
[28:12] this cuz the screening's on like the
[28:13] 19th. So you got to get it to the
[28:15] cinema. They've got to play it, make
[28:16] sure it all works and all that. So, and
[28:19] he and and this guy is he's got his
[28:21] whole company on this thing and he's
[28:22] going to struggle to get it finished on
[28:23] the 8th. And there was one guy thinking
[28:26] he was going to do the whole thing by
[28:27] the eighth.
[28:28] It was like, but the the thing about it
[28:31] was I didn't know this was happening,
[28:33] but the Lord knew it was happening. And
[28:35] and that's what I it kind of it struck
[28:37] me. I'm like, you know, the the cuz I
[28:39] would have this is like this like a ship
[28:42] here, you know, like I would have gone
[28:43] on for another week or two just flooring
[28:44] cuz you get quite busy. You focus, you a
[28:46] week goes by, you just check out a few
[28:48] things at night and it would have been
[28:49] two weeks before I really would have
[28:50] picked up we got a problem. And like a
[28:52] big ship, you can like if you need to
[28:54] turn this point in order to get it to
[28:55] over here. If you let it like this, I'm
[28:59] not I can't stress how much this was the
[29:01] problem. The Lord has solved it. Like if
[29:03] it was two more weeks, this thing would
[29:05] not have been sorted. It would just we
[29:06] couldn't have reached it. But pretty
[29:08] much something dawned on me and I knew I
[29:10] just got this. It's like the Lord
[29:11] saying, "You need to change it today.
[29:13] Change it now. Otherwise, you're not
[29:14] going to get this thing done." And he
[29:15] like, "Stop me. Put me at home. Change
[29:17] it now and do it all." And it's like I I
[29:20] still marvel because I think I did not
[29:22] know this was happening but the Lord
[29:23] just stepped in drastically and and
[29:26] because I think he wants it to be
[29:28] finished and to show there. I think he
[29:30] does you know cuz I didn't I don't plan
[29:33] this you know I had other plans. I would
[29:34] have my testimony today would have been
[29:37] oh can you pray for me? I'm in dire
[29:38] straits almost, you know, cuz this has
[29:39] happened in the film, you know, or maybe
[29:41] next week I would have asked for prayer.
[29:43] But um yeah, I just I just wanted to
[29:47] Yeah, I just want to give the Lord
[29:49] thanks and just just share what's been
[29:50] happening because you know, you go along
[29:52] in life and you I'm glad that the Lord
[29:54] knows more than we do. Now, I've been
[29:57] fortunate in this situation to see the
[29:58] answer of this pretty fast cuz sometimes
[30:00] you this happens to you and it might be
[30:01] a year or two before you know why it
[30:03] happened. So, we don't always get things
[30:05] and we suddenly neck a few days later.
[30:07] Wow, I see why that happened. You know,
[30:09] but sometimes we do, sometimes we don't.
[30:11] But I'm convinced that in all things,
[30:13] the Lord's got a control of our life.
[30:15] Even if it looks like it's bad,
[30:18] &gt;&gt; it's not, you know, and it's it's I just
[30:20] want even this to be an encouragement.
[30:21] Even if your situation looks like it's
[30:23] bad, it's not. The Lord knows you. He
[30:24] knows what you're going through. He
[30:25] knows everything. And he's looking out
[30:26] for you. He's looking out for me. And he
[30:28] wants to achieve his purpose in your
[30:30] life
[30:30] &gt;&gt; and in my life. And I'm glad he's
[30:33] faithful.
[30:35] &gt;&gt; You know, he's he's faithful enough that
[30:36] he'll override our feelings like, "Lord,
[30:38] why did you do that to me?" He's like,
[30:40] "You'll see." [laughter]
[30:41] He's faithful enough that he'll do that
[30:43] to us. And I'm so happy that he's like
[30:45] that. Like he's he has my best interest
[30:47] at heart and he knows what's best for me
[30:49] even when I don't. So, yeah. So, let's
[30:51] um that was my testimony wanted to share
[30:53] this morning. Let's stand and just sing
[30:54] one or two songs as we um
[30:59] just before we call up brother Ben.

[44:04] scripture to Colossians chapter 1 and um
[44:07] also we're going to go to uh Acts um 3.
[44:15] It's so true, brother Isaac. All things

[44:35] Amen. And he is the head of the body,
[44:37] the church, who is the beginning, the
[44:40] firstborn from the dead, that in all
[44:41] things he might have the preeminence.
[44:43] For it pleased the father that in him
[44:45] should all fullness dwell. and having
[44:47] made peace through the body of his cross
[44:49] by him to reconcile all things unto
[44:51] himself. By him, I say, whether they be
[44:53] things in earth or things in heaven, and
[44:56] you that were sometime alienated and
[44:58] enemies in your mind by wicked works,
[45:00] yet now hath he reconciled in the body
[45:03] of his flesh through death to present
[45:05] you holy and unblameable and
[45:08] unreprovable in his sight. He makes you
[45:10] in that condition. That's right.
[45:12] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. I think we'd be happy
[45:13] for a while, can't we, with that? Amen.
[45:15] All the way into eternity. If you
[45:16] continue in the faith grounded and
[45:18] settled, and be not moved away from the
[45:20] hope of the gospel, which ye have heard,
[45:22] and which was preached to every creature
[45:24] which is under heaven, whereof I, Paul,
[45:26] are made a minister, uh, who now rejoice
[45:30] in my sufferings for you, and fill up
[45:33] that which is behind of the afflictions
[45:34] of Christ in my flesh, for his body's
[45:36] sake, which is the church, uh, whereof I
[45:39] made a minister according to the
[45:40] dispensation of God, which is given to
[45:43] me for you to fulfill the word of God.
[45:45] uh even the mystery which has been hid
[45:47] from ages and from generations, but now
[45:50] is made manifest to his saints, to whom
[45:52] God would make known what is the riches
[45:55] of the glory of this mystery among the
[45:57] Gentiles, which is Christ in you, the
[45:59] hope of glory, whom we preach, warning
[46:02] every man, and teaching every man in all
[46:03] wisdom, that we may present every man
[46:06] perfect in Christ Jesus, where unto I
[46:08] also labor, striving according to his
[46:10] working, which workketh in me mightily.
[46:13] Amen. And and I'm just going to read uh
[46:14] I don't have it on the PowerPoint here,
[46:16] sorry. But in Acts chapter 3, uh we have
[46:20] uh Peter and John there. We're just
[46:21] going to read uh verse 6, but Peter and
[46:23] John have go by the gate, beautiful.
[46:25] They're going into the temple and
[46:26] there's a lame man there that was lame
[46:28] from his mother's womb. And um this is
[46:30] just a bit of a context and and we just
[46:32] read verse six here. I don't know if you
[46:34] want to put that up or not. Um so and
[46:36] then it said, "Then Peter uh well, let's
[46:39] read from verse uh four rather. And
[46:41] Peter fastened his eyes on him with John
[46:43] and said, "Look on us." This is the lame
[46:44] man. And he gave heed unto them,
[46:47] expecting to receive something of them.
[46:49] Then Peter said, "Silver and gold have I
[46:51] none, but such as I have give I thee. In
[46:53] the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth,
[46:55] rise up and walk." And he took him by
[46:57] the right hand and lifted him up. And
[46:59] immediately his strength and ankle bones
[47:01] receive strength. And he leaping up
[47:03] stood and walked and entered with them
[47:05] into the temple, walking and leaping and
[47:07] praising God. Amen. Let's bow our heads
[47:10] in a word of prayer this morning. Amen.
[47:13] If you have a need, just want to raise
[47:14] up your hand to the Lord. Say, Lord,
[47:15] remember me. Don't pass me by. He always
[47:17] comes where he's invited. Gracious
[47:19] father, we just want to lift your name
[47:22] up high. Give you, Lord, praise you onto
[47:24] your great name this morning. Thank you,
[47:26] Lord. We can sing truly all our lives.
[47:28] You've been faithful, Lord, that you are
[47:30] mighty, Lord. You're awesome, Lord God.
[47:32] We I just pray, Father, that Lord, as
[47:34] the service goes on, may you just take
[47:36] the highest place in all of our lives,
[47:38] Lord. May you be the principal theme of
[47:40] our lives. May you be our all and all.
[47:42] Father, not just here, but those who are
[47:44] streaming, those who are unwell in body,
[47:45] I pray you touch them. And dear God, you
[47:47] see the hands that have been lifted.
[47:48] Lord, I pray you just meet every need
[47:50] behind that hand. And as we've read your
[47:52] word, I pray you'd anoint it to speaker
[47:53] and hear, Lord. Do what you want to do,
[47:55] Lord, in this service. We give you right
[47:57] away to do whatever you want to do in
[47:58] our lives. So come change us, mold us,
[48:00] renew us, transform us, Lord. Meet us,
[48:02] save us, Lord. Whatever heal us, dear
[48:04] God. Whatever we Lord, whatever you want
[48:06] to do this service, Lord, we just want
[48:08] to stand back and say, Lord, have your
[48:09] way. We love you, Lord. We thank you.
[48:11] And may you bless this time in Jesus
[48:13] Christ's name. Amen. Amen. God bless
[48:15] you, friends. You can have your seats
[48:16] this morning. So, I want to, if I could
[48:18] take a title, I want to speak about the
[48:20] body of Christ, which is you and I this
[48:22] morning. Now, we read we read here in uh
[48:25] Colossians that he is the head and and
[48:27] and we are the body. Now, this is this
[48:30] is a very powerful thought where uh when
[48:32] because many times we well some people
[48:34] think of well well he's the body and
[48:36] we're just the church but we're actually
[48:38] being made one where that all that
[48:40] Christ is all that God poured into
[48:42] Christ he poured into the church okay so
[48:44] every attribute every every part of his
[48:47] divine nature all that he is is actually
[48:49] living and walking in you this morning
[48:50] so I pray that that you know this will
[48:52] become very real as we go through this
[48:54] I'm just going to just going to go on a
[48:55] bit of a journey but you see there's
[48:58] this great mystery and this is what the
[48:59] message of the hour is. If anyone asks
[49:00] you what is this message you believe it
[49:02] is Christ in you the hope of glory that
[49:04] is the opening of the seals that's the
[49:06] you know the church ages that's all the
[49:07] restoration of the truth it is for
[49:10] Christ in you the hope of glory that's
[49:11] the purpose behind the message okay so
[49:14] now this is a great you know I was just
[49:15] reading this and just think about as
[49:17] Paul would say that God would make known
[49:19] unto us the riches of the glory of this
[49:21] mystery so there's great riches within
[49:23] this that Christ in us the hope of glory
[49:25] now it says in Romans chapter 5 that Um
[49:30] here we are. He says uh for if when we
[49:32] were enemies we were reconciled to God
[49:34] by death of his son. Much more being
[49:36] reconciled we shall be saved by his
[49:38] life. And not only so but we also joy in
[49:41] God through our Lord Jesus Christ by
[49:44] whom we have now received the atonement.
[49:46] Now this word atonement is actually a
[49:48] word which means at onement. So you're
[49:50] no longer two, you're one. Okay? Now
[49:52] this has this is more than just two
[49:54] parties coming close together, right?
[49:57] that there's actually both becoming
[49:58] completely one. And the reason I bring
[50:00] this out is because the atonement has a
[50:02] far more deeper meaning than well, I'm
[50:04] just at one with God uh in terms of uh
[50:07] you know uh what I'm trying to say is
[50:09] that the fact is that the magnitude of
[50:11] it is is all that Christ is he's poured
[50:13] into you,
[50:14] &gt;&gt; right? There's no longer you can't see
[50:16] like you know like if my hand was you
[50:20] you you can't see any surgical uh scar
[50:24] from my hand being attached to my arm
[50:26] there. My body is at perfect at one with
[50:29] itself.
[50:30] &gt;&gt; Okay? There's no join. There's no
[50:32] connection. Right? All that's in my mind
[50:35] now is manifested through my body. Okay?
[50:38] So a true you could say the atonement is
[50:42] manifested in me by my hand being part
[50:44] of my arm. You can't see you know it's
[50:46] not just my hand is close to my arm.
[50:48] It's part of it. It's one. You can't see
[50:50] where one starts and one finishes.
[50:51] Right? It's the same thing with us in
[50:53] Christ. You can't see where God starts
[50:54] and you you know you know God ends and
[50:56] you start like there's a join somewhere.
[50:58] You become perfectly one. Okay. So that
[51:01] means that all that Christ is now he's
[51:03] poured into you. So now when you look at
[51:05] a person right now so like I'm thinking
[51:07] so maybe I'll think subconsciously I'm
[51:09] thirsty so now the thought will go to my
[51:11] hand the hand will pick up the bottle
[51:13] I'll open it and then I'll drink it
[51:15] right so my actions are just the
[51:17] expression of my thought okay so so now
[51:20] with a believer if God is in you then
[51:22] your action should be an expression of
[51:23] his word right because you're at one
[51:25] with him right so it's not like it's not
[51:27] your carnal mind trying to be a
[51:29] Christian it's actually God in you being
[51:31] the Christian through you right this is
[51:32] really what it means to be at one with
[51:34] God that your mind is sure you have your
[51:36] human mind but there's a greater mind
[51:38] within you I mean the mind of Christ so
[51:40] that all that he is now is in you right
[51:42] so so so if um you know so my character
[51:46] that I am is now manifested through my
[51:49] actions so if I'm a stubborn person or a
[51:51] selfish person that may be just in my
[51:53] mind but now it'll come through my life
[51:55] my attitude how I talk the things I do
[51:57] the things I don't do is because of
[51:59] what's in my thinking now or my spirit
[52:01] comes through my bo you know through my
[52:03] body Right? So you can see what I am in
[52:05] my heart by my actions. Okay? So it's
[52:08] the same thing now with God in his body
[52:10] which is the church. Right? You see all
[52:12] that God is. You see living, walking,
[52:13] talking, breathing, moving, acting
[52:15] through you and I.
[52:18] Amen. Now that means that now that's a
[52:19] perfect atonement has has taken place.
[52:21] Now this is me in my little diagram. So
[52:23] I want to show you this now. So before
[52:25] before God ever came your way, there was
[52:27] a chasm. There was a wall, middle wall
[52:29] of partition. So there was you and there
[52:31] was God. There's a great chasm, right?
[52:33] You were far off. But God didn't want
[52:35] you a far off. He didn't want you
[52:36] wandering in darkness doing your own
[52:38] thing. He wanted to bring you and and
[52:40] bring you and atone you to himself that
[52:42] he could express his word through your
[52:44] life perfectly. Okay? So, so he didn't
[52:47] want you because because you're part of
[52:48] him from the beginning, right? And his
[52:50] thinking, he didn't want you just
[52:52] wandering around in chaos cuz there's
[52:54] one thing God can't do. He can't lose
[52:55] one of his attributes. It's impossible
[52:57] for him to lose you. Amen. If you're his
[52:59] attribute, you you can't be lost. You
[53:01] may wander, stumble, up and down, in and
[53:04] out, whatever more, but God's going to
[53:05] get you because you're part of him. Cuz
[53:07] he came looking for you. Amen. Not just
[53:09] anyone. It's whosoever will, let him
[53:11] come. But he came looking for you. Amen.
[53:14] So now there's a gulf that was between
[53:15] us and us and you know, God and and and
[53:18] we could not bridge that gulf. Not one
[53:20] man could not save another. It took God
[53:22] to become a man to redeem us. I just
[53:24] want to labor these kind of elementary
[53:25] points because I trust it'll mean
[53:27] something now. And then Well, that's
[53:29] interesting. Okay.
[53:31] Why is that not there? Anyway, there's
[53:33] meant to be like a red line between God
[53:35] and man. Okay. So, the blood now brings
[53:37] us together, but there's not a gap. True
[53:41] atonement doesn't mean you're just
[53:43] close. Cuz some people can be, oh, I'm
[53:45] close to God. Like, I'm in church and
[53:47] I'm, you know, I feel him close. And God
[53:49] doesn't just want to be close. He wants
[53:50] to be in you. I mean, he wants to live
[53:52] through your life. He wants to be where
[53:54] it's no longer God like there's no gap.
[53:56] It doesn't matter how close that gap can
[53:58] be. Like even even the pyramid, they say
[54:00] the great pyramid, you can take a razor
[54:02] blade and you can't even put it through
[54:03] the blocks. That's not true atonement
[54:06] cuz the blocks are just close together.
[54:07] True atonement is just be one big piece
[54:09] of stone.
[54:10] &gt;&gt; Amen. With all it shape and everything,
[54:12] that'll be a true atonement. You can't
[54:13] see where one block ends and the other
[54:15] block starts. If it was a true
[54:16] atonement, as like you and I, God has
[54:19] now joined us that we are now one unit
[54:22] like here in the bottom. See? See? It
[54:24] goes from this to this. Now where does
[54:28] the go where does God start end and
[54:30] where does the man start and vice versa
[54:32] no one unit that's true atonement Christ
[54:35] in you the hope of glory he makes you
[54:38] one so he says now he says now Christ
[54:40] you are sometimes a far off okay let's
[54:42] go down to so for he is our peace and
[54:44] made both one and hath broken down the
[54:46] middle wall of partition between us
[54:48] having abolished in his flesh the emnity
[54:50] even the law of commandments contained
[54:52] in ordinances for to make in himself of
[54:55] twain one new man so making peace So
[54:57] it's one new man that he's made. So and
[55:00] that he might reconcile both unto God in
[55:02] one body by the cross, having slain the
[55:04] emnity thereby. So now this this is this
[55:08] this fact is
[55:10] we ain't us and God ain't two different
[55:13] people. We are his body. He's our head.
[55:16] Right? He does we are not a headless
[55:18] body. This message came to resto restore
[55:21] true headship of the word of God in our
[55:23] lives. So now with the believer, we and
[55:27] the word become one. Us and God become
[55:29] one. You can't find a gap, a separation.
[55:32] I trust this means something. It meant a
[55:33] lot to me. Okay, it made me happy. So
[55:35] hopefully it'll make you happy at some
[55:37] stage. See, now so in Ezekiel, he would
[55:39] say this that God would God would bring
[55:41] up residence. You know, many people say,
[55:44] "Well, God is on the throne of my
[55:46] heart." Who's heard that saying?
[55:48] &gt;&gt; Is he the king of your life? Is is is is
[55:50] he on your throne? And if he's on your
[55:53] throne, that means he's the ruler. He's
[55:55] the Lord. That means what he says goes.
[55:58] Okay? It's not actually not you. You're
[56:00] the temple that he lives in. So, he's
[56:02] going to express his will. Amen. So,
[56:03] when the Holy Ghost truly comes into
[56:05] someone, their thinking changes, their
[56:07] actions change because the king was once
[56:10] Satan. He got dethroned. God takes up
[56:12] his rightful place and then he begins to
[56:14] rule. Okay? So, that means all of his
[56:16] nature can be expressed. All that he is
[56:19] can be expressed. Not just a part of
[56:20] himself. See, this is more than just
[56:22] healing. This is more than just
[56:23] prophesying. This is more than just No,
[56:25] it's that eternal life can be
[56:27] administered. I mean, because all of his
[56:29] attributes are now are within you. Cuz
[56:31] remember, the Holy Ghost that's in you
[56:32] is not a different spirit to him. It's
[56:34] not a Yeah, I know I've been through
[56:36] this. Maybe this is the conclusion of
[56:37] how many months we've been down this
[56:39] trail, but you know, you know, this is
[56:41] that we don't have a religious spirit.
[56:43] We don't have an argument. We don't have
[56:45] a nice idea. We have the living God. I
[56:48] mean the one who made heavens and earth
[56:49] comes and dwells in you and then because
[56:51] he is within you. If he says body move
[56:53] you move body pray you pray body fast
[56:56] you fast. Is it because the thoughts
[56:57] come down transmitted down a mean into
[57:00] your life and you and and he leads you.
[57:02] He motivates you. He guides you and
[57:04] because it's his thinking. It's his word
[57:06] and he will never lead you contrary to
[57:07] his word. I mean he'll never take you in
[57:09] a place that's outside his word because
[57:11] he is his word and you become one with
[57:13] him. And if you keep your human will
[57:16] surrendered to his. Amen. and he'll lead
[57:18] you into all truth. Amen. So, he says,
[57:20] "I'll put my spirit within you." See,
[57:21] many people, they just get a new spirit.
[57:24] God, you know, because, you know, we
[57:25] can't even live with ourselves half the
[57:27] time. Brother Bram says, you know, we
[57:28] have a stony heart to begin with. We
[57:30] don't even believe that the word is
[57:31] true. Then God gives us a new heart, a
[57:33] soft heart. We can actually say, "Yes,
[57:34] this scripture is right." But that's not
[57:37] that's not the end thing. Amen. It's
[57:38] when God when he says, "And I'll put my
[57:40] spirit within you." Amen. You know, if
[57:42] you're struggling in your Christian
[57:44] walk, you say, "God, fill me with the
[57:45] Holy Ghost or refill me, Lord. Refresh
[57:48] me in your presence, Lord." Amen.
[57:49] Because he says, "And I'll put my spirit
[57:51] within you and cause you to walk in my
[57:53] statutes, and you shall keep my
[57:55] judgments and do them." Why? Cuz the
[57:57] king is in residence here. Amen. It's
[58:00] not a religious spirit. It's the king.
[58:01] It's not a national spirit. It's not an
[58:03] antichrist spirit. It is the spirit of
[58:05] almighty God is in residence here.
[58:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:10] The Apostle Paul would speak about how
[58:12] we are the body. We are the body of the
[58:14] Lord Jesus Christ. He says, "So ought
[58:16] men to love their wives as their own
[58:18] bodies. He that loveth his wife loveth
[58:20] himself." So a man who really loves
[58:22] himself loves his wife.
[58:25] I trust there's some brothers here who
[58:26] really love themselves. Amen. For no man
[58:29] ever hateth his own flesh, but
[58:31] nourisheth and cherisheth it even as the
[58:33] Lord the church. For we are members of
[58:36] his body, of his flesh, and of his
[58:37] bones. Amen. So the apostle Paul is
[58:39] bringing this parallel that we are the
[58:42] body of Christ. Amen. We are his body.
[58:44] We are his bones and his flesh. Amen.
[58:47] And so if any man hates his own wife, he
[58:50] hasn't the right revelation. He is
[58:52] living under legalism. He's still under
[58:54] the blood of bulls and goats. He has not
[58:55] received the atonement. Amen. Because
[58:57] what does God do? He's not He loves his
[59:00] body. He cherishes his body. Amen. We
[59:03] are his victory. Amen. We are his
[59:05] greatest achievement upon the earth is a
[59:07] redeemed people filled with his spirit.
[59:09] This is God's great design of his plan
[59:12] has been I want a people who out of
[59:14] their own will, not out of fear, not out
[59:16] of obligation, not out of a duty, but
[59:18] out of a love, amen, will serve me, walk
[59:20] with me, worship me, give their all to
[59:22] me, and I'm not going to force them. I'm
[59:24] not going to put pressure on them, but
[59:26] I'm going to woo them, amen, by my
[59:28] spirit. I'm going to brood over them.
[59:29] And amen, their hearts are going to come
[59:31] open to me. And that seed that's in
[59:33] their soul is going to come to
[59:34] expression. Amen. And they're going to
[59:36] be made in my image.
[59:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's what he wanted. So he's
[59:39] never hated. He doesn't hate his body.
[59:41] He's not He's not ashamed of his body.
[59:44] He's proud of his body. Amen. And it
[59:47] should be the same thing with a husband.
[59:48] You know, we should never see my
[59:50] ambition. My ambition. You want to hear
[59:52] my ambition? I want to see that woman
[59:54] lifted up high that God can live. I'm
[59:57] not just talking about her. I'm talking
[59:58] about this whole church. That's my life.
[1:00:00] That's what I want to see is that God
[1:00:02] would come down and fill every fiber of
[1:00:04] every being and be manifested and be
[1:00:07] glorified through every life. That's my
[1:00:09] whole ambition. I believe that's God's
[1:00:11] ambition. Amen. He wants to lift up a
[1:00:13] people washed in his blood without spot
[1:00:15] or wrinkle or any such thing that God
[1:00:17] can just flow through so freely. There's
[1:00:20] no jam. There's no complex. There's no
[1:00:21] log. There's no problem. Amen. That they
[1:00:23] hold on to. Amen. That stops God living.
[1:00:27] &gt;&gt; That's me.
[1:00:31] &gt;&gt; If I do that, I've lived a good life.
[1:00:34] &gt;&gt; I've lived a life of purpose.
[1:00:37] &gt;&gt; Amen. And anyone who comes, any man or
[1:00:39] woman or child that comes under the
[1:00:40] blood of Jesus Christ really receives
[1:00:42] the atonement. That's the thrust of
[1:00:44] their life. That's their their ambition.
[1:00:46] They're not wishy-washy floating along.
[1:00:47] They have a purpose. Lord, I want to see
[1:00:49] you live. I want to see every divine
[1:00:51] promise be manifested in the body of
[1:00:53] Christ. I don't want to push you down,
[1:00:54] hold her back. I want to push you
[1:00:56] forward. You can do it. Amen. Why would
[1:00:58] the Apostle Paul say, "Run this race." I
[1:01:01] mean, let us run. Amen. He's not saying,
[1:01:03] "No, hold back and quit and just no, you
[1:01:06] can't do He said, "No, run this race.
[1:01:07] You're made to run." Amen. You're built
[1:01:09] to overcome. Amen. You are built of
[1:01:11] stuff that the devil can't can't knock
[1:01:13] over, can't crush. Amen. You're made of
[1:01:15] a material which is far greater. Amen.
[1:01:18] Than than than than any substance of in
[1:01:20] creation naturally. I talk about your
[1:01:22] what's in your soul, that seed of God.
[1:01:25] Amen. That is made of the word. Amen.
[1:01:27] And God wants to see that word come to
[1:01:28] manifestation. Amen. That's why he sent
[1:01:31] this message. Amen. To get a hold of
[1:01:33] your life. If I'm preaching, I'm going
[1:01:34] to preach for a little bit. And you got
[1:01:35] to realize that you're the body of
[1:01:37] Christ. Amen. And he loves his body.
[1:01:39] Amen. He cherishes his body. We are all
[1:01:42] members of that same body. Amen. So why
[1:01:44] on earth would we think we're not worth
[1:01:46] anything? You're very valuable. You're
[1:01:48] more valuable. Elon Musk couldn't buy
[1:01:50] you with his money.
[1:01:52] &gt;&gt; The UN, whoever he they you they have
[1:01:56] they don't have the thing that can
[1:01:58] purchase you. Amen. By the blood of
[1:02:00] Jesus Christ who was shed on Calvary.
[1:02:02] Amen. That was the only thing that God
[1:02:04] could give. Amen. The highest price that
[1:02:07] had to be paid was his own life. And he
[1:02:09] gladly gave that price cuz he said,
[1:02:11] "You're my body. I'm not leaving you
[1:02:13] separated from me. I don't want to have
[1:02:14] a chasm. I don't want to have a gulf. I
[1:02:16] want to be one with you. I want you to
[1:02:18] receive this atonement that all that I
[1:02:20] am, I pour into you." Amen. That you can
[1:02:22] amen that that he can live through us.
[1:02:25] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. We are all members of
[1:02:27] his body. Don't ever think you're not
[1:02:28] part of part of the word of God. That's
[1:02:30] the devil lying to you. He's not a part
[1:02:32] of you. Jesus said he has no part of me.
[1:02:34] I've got no part in him. That's why he
[1:02:36] the devil tries to tell you you got no
[1:02:38] part of the word because he doesn't have
[1:02:39] any part of the word. But you've got all
[1:02:41] part of the word. Amen. When Jesus died,
[1:02:43] he was thinking of you. Amen. He wrote
[1:02:45] an inheritance for you. Amen. Of peace,
[1:02:47] love, joy, overcoming power. Amen. To be
[1:02:49] made in his image. That's what God
[1:02:51] thought of when he died on Calvary. That
[1:02:53] healing would be yours. Restoration
[1:02:54] would be yours. Peace would be yours.
[1:02:56] Amen. A dominion would be yours. Amen.
[1:02:58] that this the authority of the believer
[1:03:00] would be manifested in your life.
[1:03:03] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. M slowed down. We got
[1:03:04] to realize, no, you've been given a ring
[1:03:06] of authority. Amen. Where where the
[1:03:08] prodical son came home and the father
[1:03:10] said, "Give him the best robe." Not just
[1:03:12] a robe, but an adoption robe, a placing
[1:03:14] robe, a robe of authority. What the
[1:03:16] father was wearing now, the son was
[1:03:18] wearing. Give him a ring. Amen. It
[1:03:20] wasn't just any ring. It was a seal of
[1:03:21] authority upon his finger. Amen. And
[1:03:24] God, you know, the father knew that son
[1:03:26] now had the character, amen, to use that
[1:03:28] ring, amen, to to seal the word of God
[1:03:30] to be manifested. And just like Esther
[1:03:32] was given the ring of Hmon. Well, it
[1:03:34] wasn't Hmon's ring. It was the king's
[1:03:36] ring. Amen. But Hmon took it out of
[1:03:38] deceit. Amen. But what happened? It was
[1:03:40] restored into the into a hand of
[1:03:42] character.
[1:03:43] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Where she could write a law,
[1:03:46] amen, to to to get deliverance for her
[1:03:48] people. Amen. That the vengeance of the
[1:03:50] king could come upon the enemy. Amen.
[1:03:53] And what has God put in your hand? What
[1:03:54] does he put on your your finger? A ring
[1:03:57] of unmmerited predestinated grace before
[1:04:00] the foundation of the world. You got to
[1:04:02] realize that you're packing something.
[1:04:04] Amen. That is far like Peter said to
[1:04:06] that lame man, such as I have give I
[1:04:09] thee.
[1:04:10] &gt;&gt; He didn't have money. He didn't have a
[1:04:12] sevenstep program to walking. All those
[1:04:14] things are maybe fine, but he didn't.
[1:04:16] But what was he carrying? He was
[1:04:18] carrying mercy. He was carrying
[1:04:20] deliverance. He was carrying liberty. He
[1:04:22] was carrying God. All of his attributes
[1:04:25] were now walking in two feet past that
[1:04:27] man. And he was looking like, "Oh, maybe
[1:04:29] they can help me naturally." And Peter,
[1:04:30] cuz God moved on him, was saying, "I've
[1:04:32] got far more than what you're
[1:04:34] expecting."
[1:04:36] &gt;&gt; And maybe you're not expecting much in
[1:04:37] church this morning. I tell you what,
[1:04:39] there's one greater. Amen. The one that
[1:04:41] walked in Peter and John by the gate,
[1:04:42] beautiful is now walking by your way
[1:04:44] this morning. Amen. That he can such as
[1:04:46] he has. He gives unto us. Amen. Through
[1:04:49] his word. Amen.
[1:04:51] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:04:53] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, I think we can rejoice. You
[1:04:54] got to realize, what am I carrying this
[1:04:56] morning? It's far greater value. You
[1:04:58] can't buy it. You can't earn it. You
[1:05:00] can't solve it. It's God.
[1:05:02] &gt;&gt; He wanted to pour himself into your
[1:05:04] life. Brother says that God wants to
[1:05:07] give us the Holy Ghost more than we want
[1:05:09] to receive it.
[1:05:13] &gt;&gt; So, if you've got a hunger to be filled,
[1:05:15] he's got a far more desire to fill you.
[1:05:18] &gt;&gt; Amen. He's not trying to hold it back.
[1:05:20] No, he just pours it out without
[1:05:21] measure. He's a very generous God. I
[1:05:24] mean, he's not a He's not a frugal God.
[1:05:27] He's very generous. He pours his spirit
[1:05:28] out without measure. And especially at
[1:05:30] this end time where where where the
[1:05:33] moving of the Holy Ghost has been
[1:05:34] totally undamned by the dams of creeds
[1:05:38] and dogmas of men. Amen. Brother Bram
[1:05:40] said that the Holy Ghost, the full power
[1:05:42] of God moving was bound at the church
[1:05:44] door, but now that's been busted open.
[1:05:46] Amen. There's been some dams that have
[1:05:48] been blown up. Amen. that the flow of
[1:05:50] God can just move service after service,
[1:05:53] prayer time after prayer time. You read
[1:05:54] the Bible, God just pours out his oil
[1:05:56] and wine and you stagger around cuz it's
[1:05:58] so great. Hallelujah. Was that cuz
[1:06:00] there's no restriction to the moving of
[1:06:02] God. Amen. God doesn't want to be
[1:06:04] restricted. He doesn't want you to be
[1:06:06] restricted. He don't want He doesn't
[1:06:08] want you to be held back with a well,
[1:06:09] what? No, it can't be me and I've done
[1:06:11] too much wrong and I've done this and
[1:06:13] thought this. That's irrelevant. I mean,
[1:06:15] the blood is greater still than
[1:06:16] anything. There is nothing under the sun
[1:06:19] the blood of Jesus Christ can't solve or
[1:06:21] fix.
[1:06:22] &gt;&gt; Otherwise it's limited. It's unlimited.
[1:06:27] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Now
[1:06:30] Jesus was asked about uh marriage all
[1:06:32] these things and they twain shall be one
[1:06:34] flesh. So then they are no more twain
[1:06:36] but one. Twain means two. They become
[1:06:39] one. Right? So we're not twain of with
[1:06:43] God. There's not two of you. There's one
[1:06:45] of you. All right. I I will be with you
[1:06:48] even in you to the end of the world.
[1:06:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:54] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. But you see the thing
[1:06:55] is what happens is there's always a
[1:06:58] there's a controversy about God and man.
[1:07:01] Religious spirits don't like to talk
[1:07:02] about God being in men.
[1:07:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. They'll talk about Calvary
[1:07:08] only as a place of forgiveness, but they
[1:07:11] don't want to talk about what it should
[1:07:12] achieve. Why did he go up Calvary? to
[1:07:16] take your sins far away. Why did he do
[1:07:18] that? To cleanse you. Why did he cleanse
[1:07:20] you? So he can fill you. That he can
[1:07:23] walk in you. That all he is can be
[1:07:24] poured into you. That's why he died on
[1:07:26] Calvary. It's more than just a
[1:07:28] forgiveness. So the forgiveness is
[1:07:29] great. I knew I know what it's like to
[1:07:31] be forgiven. But it's not just now
[1:07:32] you're forgiven and go go away in the
[1:07:34] same state you came in. No, he wants to
[1:07:37] transform us in such a way that the way
[1:07:39] we come is not the way we go. Amen.
[1:07:41] We're a totally different person. A new
[1:07:43] creation. Not a patched up job. Not a
[1:07:46] reformed people. No. But a transformed
[1:07:48] people. Amen. Made in his image. A
[1:07:50] totally new person. Old things have
[1:07:52] passed away. All things become new.
[1:07:54] Hallelujah. This is what he wants to do.
[1:07:56] And I believe this is what he has done.
[1:07:58] Now, but you see, there's always this
[1:07:59] controversy. People don't like to talk
[1:08:01] about God being in a people. I'm just
[1:08:05] here to just to clear this out
[1:08:06] completely
[1:08:08] &gt;&gt; cuz the devil doesn't care how much you
[1:08:11] talk about God.
[1:08:12] &gt;&gt; He just doesn't want to see God to live.
[1:08:15] &gt;&gt; Yeah. So you can testify all that.
[1:08:16] People are not worried about talking
[1:08:18] about God 50 years ago. I'm not living
[1:08:20] 50 years ago. I wasn't even a thought in
[1:08:23] my parents' mind 50 years ago. I just
[1:08:25] hit 40 this year. I wasn't around. That
[1:08:27] wasn't my revival. Now is my revival.
[1:08:30] Now is my time to see God live. I'm not
[1:08:32] I'm not a history is interesting, but
[1:08:34] I'm not a biblical historian. Oh, back
[1:08:37] 2,000 years ago. If he's not the same
[1:08:39] God today, let's just go home. But if he
[1:08:41] is the same today, I think we should
[1:08:43] give our all and just push in like never
[1:08:44] before. Amen. Cuz we realize that he is
[1:08:47] the same yesterday, today, and forever.
[1:08:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:49] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. So now, Brother Bram
[1:08:51] says in the seat, he's not air with the
[1:08:52] shook. But she said, "But when you come
[1:08:54] to say, I and my father are one." This
[1:08:57] is what Calvary came to achieve that you
[1:09:00] and the father would become one
[1:09:03] &gt;&gt; and other things. Then the shuck pulls
[1:09:05] away from it. The shuck doesn't doesn't
[1:09:08] like that kind of talk. How dare you say
[1:09:10] you and God are one. Well, that's what
[1:09:11] that that that's why he died. That's
[1:09:14] what Christianity is to be Christlike.
[1:09:16] Right? The only way to be Christlike is
[1:09:18] if Christ is in you. Otherwise, the
[1:09:20] Apostle Paul was preaching error by
[1:09:22] saying, "Christ, Christ in you, the hope
[1:09:23] of glory." I believe the doctrine of the
[1:09:25] Apostle Paul. Brother did too. We're
[1:09:28] being restored back to it. So, I think
[1:09:30] we should say what Paul says, not some
[1:09:32] Baptist theology that doesn't change
[1:09:33] anyone. We should actually talk about
[1:09:35] what the Apostle Paul said, that God can
[1:09:38] transform you. He can change you. That
[1:09:40] faith can come in and things drop off
[1:09:42] your life. That he gives you victory.
[1:09:44] You don't just talk about victory.
[1:09:46] You're a living victory. The things
[1:09:48] that's once held me down are not even
[1:09:50] holding me down anymore. They're not
[1:09:51] even a thought in my mind. They don't
[1:09:53] bother me no more. And if they bother
[1:09:55] me, it's just a memory that's bothering
[1:09:57] me. And you got to put that in its place
[1:09:58] and say, "No, I've been liberated.
[1:10:00] &gt;&gt; I'm free. I'm walking in newness of
[1:10:02] life. I'm not walking in the oldness of
[1:10:04] my dead life. I'm newness of a new life.
[1:10:07] I'm walking in it." How did you get
[1:10:09] there? He put me in it.
[1:10:11] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:10:13] &gt;&gt; But the real genuine bride church will
[1:10:15] bring forth the entire word of God in
[1:10:17] its fullness and in its strength. For
[1:10:19] he's the same yesterday, today, and
[1:10:20] forever. Amen. So, so this is this is
[1:10:24] you and I. The genuine bride church will
[1:10:26] bring forth the entire word of God in
[1:10:28] its fullness and its strength.
[1:10:31] The strength of this word is not weak.
[1:10:34] &gt;&gt; We don't serve a weak God. We don't
[1:10:36] serve some kind of a wimpy God. We serve
[1:10:39] the all powerful, allconquering,
[1:10:40] almighty, fearless God. He wasn't afraid
[1:10:43] to go to hell for you. He wasn't afraid
[1:10:46] to take the keys of hell, death, and the
[1:10:47] grave off Satan. He wasn't afraid to
[1:10:49] look a religious spirit in the eye and
[1:10:51] say, "You bunch of wited walls." I mean,
[1:10:53] he wasn't afraid to stand on the
[1:10:54] promises of God, he wasn't ashamed. And
[1:10:58] when that same God comes into you, it
[1:11:00] makes you unashamed. Amen. And when
[1:11:02] people come to you and try and say,
[1:11:03] "This message isn't true and it doesn't
[1:11:05] work and it's false doctrine," I say,
[1:11:06] "Hold on. It said I would meet God. I
[1:11:09] met God. It said I'd receive an upper
[1:11:11] room experience. I've done that. It said
[1:11:13] I'd go from glory to glory. It's done
[1:11:16] that. It said that it would actually
[1:11:17] make me one with the word himself. It's
[1:11:19] done that. Amen. So if someone comes
[1:11:21] along and says, "No, it doesn't work."
[1:11:23] They say, "You've come far too late."
[1:11:25] And I say, "Well, what's it what is your
[1:11:27] religion done for you?"
[1:11:29] &gt;&gt; This is what this has done for me. Years
[1:11:31] ago, we had people say, you know, leave
[1:11:33] the church and all these things. I said,
[1:11:34] "Well, but we see the love of God among
[1:11:36] the people." Yes.
[1:11:38] &gt;&gt; Isn't that what Christianity should be?
[1:11:40] By this shall all men know you are my
[1:11:42] disciples cuz you have love one for
[1:11:44] another.
[1:11:44] &gt;&gt; And it wasn't just because we all just
[1:11:46] got along like some big happy group. No,
[1:11:48] it's cuz the love of God was binding us
[1:11:50] together. So if that's the achievement
[1:11:52] of the message, what's the problem?
[1:11:55] &gt;&gt; But the problem is a religious spirit
[1:11:57] tries to come in and make us lukewarm,
[1:11:59] formal, and powerless. And I'm not
[1:12:01] interested in it being a lukewarm,
[1:12:02] formal, and powerless. I'm interested in
[1:12:04] receiving all that God has poured into
[1:12:06] me to be lived out of me. That's what I
[1:12:08] want. That's what I live for. I just
[1:12:10] want to see him live.
[1:12:12] &gt;&gt; So why should you know? So, so never let
[1:12:14] something come along and say and reduce
[1:12:16] this message to an argument. This
[1:12:18] message is not an argument. It is Christ
[1:12:19] in you, the hope of glory.
[1:12:21] &gt;&gt; Amen. It's far more. Amen. It's far more
[1:12:23] than just an argument. Now,
[1:12:27] the Lord would say, I am the true vine
[1:12:29] and my father is a husbandman. Every
[1:12:31] branch in me that beareth not fruit, uh,
[1:12:33] he taketh away, and every branch that
[1:12:36] beareth fruit, he purgeth it, that it
[1:12:38] may bring forth more fruit. Now ye are
[1:12:40] clean through the word which I have
[1:12:41] spoken unto you, abide in me, and I in
[1:12:43] you, as the branch cannot bear fruit of
[1:12:45] itself, except it abide in the vine, and
[1:12:48] no uh no more can ye except ye abide in
[1:12:52] me. I am the vine, and ye are the
[1:12:54] branches. Amen. So the branches bear the
[1:12:57] fruit, the branches bear the life. Amen.
[1:13:00] It's not the vine. The vine just sends
[1:13:02] its life into the branch and the branch
[1:13:05] produces the life. So, and if you look
[1:13:07] at a vine and a branch, you know,
[1:13:10] where's the connection? Where does the
[1:13:12] branch begin and you know the vine stop?
[1:13:15] It's one whole unit. There's been an
[1:13:17] atonement, you could say, taken place.
[1:13:20] They are one. So, all that's in the vine
[1:13:22] comes into the branch and produces a
[1:13:25] fruit. So, all that was in Christ was
[1:13:26] poured into you, right? the life because
[1:13:29] what he is the strength of our life.
[1:13:31] Amen. Brother Bram says now he don't
[1:13:33] have no hands tonight but my hands and
[1:13:35] your hands. He has eyes and mine and
[1:13:37] yours. That's what he's using. He is the
[1:13:39] vine. We are the branches. Is that
[1:13:41] right, brethren? And the vine doesn't
[1:13:43] bear fruit. The branch bears fruit
[1:13:45] energized by the vine. Is that right?
[1:13:47] And if the first branch that came out of
[1:13:49] that Pentecostal vine wrote a book of
[1:13:51] Acts, if that tree ever puts forth
[1:13:53] another branch, it'll write another book
[1:13:55] of Acts cuz it won't put forth a
[1:13:57] pumpkin. Amen. And then a watermelon,
[1:13:59] then a pomegranate, it'll bring forth
[1:14:01] the same fruit every time cuz it's the
[1:14:03] same life going through the vine. He
[1:14:05] says, "Now, do you understand?" So if
[1:14:07] it's that same life, it's not going to
[1:14:09] produce a dead formal group that argues
[1:14:11] and fusses and fights. That's a pumpkin.
[1:14:14] We ain't pumpkin fruit bearing
[1:14:16] believers. We bear the fruit of the
[1:14:18] vine. Amen. Which is joy, love, peace,
[1:14:21] gentleness, faith, being longsuffering.
[1:14:24] All the fruits of the spirit, they are
[1:14:26] produced. Amen. What was the book of
[1:14:28] Acts? The book of Acts was God
[1:14:29] demonstrating himself in a body.
[1:14:32] More than healing, more than prophecy,
[1:14:34] it was God. That was just fruit
[1:14:36] manifested out of the life that was
[1:14:37] within them. Amen. And so, if God ever
[1:14:40] puts forth another branch,
[1:14:43] he'll write another book of Acts. And
[1:14:44] you got to realize, so what am I? I'm a
[1:14:47] branch of God. God put me forth out of
[1:14:50] the vine. It wasn't me trying to grow
[1:14:52] myself in. I wasn't grafted in to
[1:14:54] produce my own fruit. Amen. No, it was
[1:14:56] him grew me out.
[1:14:59] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. [snorts] Amen. So
[1:15:01] therefore, if it's the life of the vine
[1:15:04] that's producing the fruit, Amen. then,
[1:15:06] because you know, like Jesus says, by
[1:15:08] their fruit you shall know them.
[1:15:10] &gt;&gt; It's not by their talk or by their
[1:15:12] argument. It's by their fruit. What life
[1:15:14] do they live? What's their track record?
[1:15:18] I trust we can see a track record behind
[1:15:20] us of Christianity. A real a real
[1:15:22] Christian life.
[1:15:24] Amen. Says, "Likewise, the Spirit
[1:15:26] although also helpeth our infirmities,
[1:15:28] for we know not what we should pray as
[1:15:30] we ought, but the Spirit itself maketh
[1:15:32] intercession for us with groanings which
[1:15:34] cannot be uttered. And he that searchth
[1:15:37] the heart knoweth what is the mind of
[1:15:38] the Spirit, because he maketh
[1:15:40] intercessions for the saints according
[1:15:42] to the will of God." So there's this
[1:15:44] energizing from the the life in the
[1:15:46] vine. Amen. Which bears which which
[1:15:48] which can speak through you, can
[1:15:50] intercede through you. Why? Because it's
[1:15:53] him within you praying. It's him within
[1:15:55] you interceding. It's him within you
[1:15:57] groaning, giving you a longing. It's not
[1:15:59] your it's not your desire. It becomes
[1:16:02] his desire if you're become one with
[1:16:04] him. Right? It's not your motivation,
[1:16:06] your human ability. It's him leading,
[1:16:09] guiding you, praying through you. You
[1:16:11] you you receive a burden for someone who
[1:16:14] put that there. That was him.
[1:16:16] &gt;&gt; Cuz he's within you. He wants to
[1:16:17] manifest himself out of you. Amen.
[1:16:19] Because we're being made to intercede to
[1:16:21] stand in the gap.
[1:16:23] &gt;&gt; That's part of him. Didn't he stand in
[1:16:25] the gap for you and I?
[1:16:27] &gt;&gt; Right? And if he's in you, won't you do
[1:16:29] the same thing?
[1:16:30] &gt;&gt; Cuz he is in you, right? Didn't he love
[1:16:32] his enemies? Forgive his enemies? If
[1:16:35] he's in you, you'll do the same thing.
[1:16:37] You can't help it because it's him in
[1:16:38] you doing it. [snorts]
[1:16:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. We all understand. All that he is
[1:16:43] is in you.
[1:16:44] &gt;&gt; Oh, but I'm just a believer. No, don't
[1:16:46] don't don't just make that something
[1:16:49] like I just come to church and that's
[1:16:52] all I do. No. If you're a real believer,
[1:16:54] he's in you.
[1:16:55] &gt;&gt; You're part of his body.
[1:16:57] &gt;&gt; You're part of the body of Christ. Amen.
[1:16:59] So, all that he is is in you to be
[1:17:02] manifested. Now, some people will say,
[1:17:04] "Well, does that mean you just humanly
[1:17:06] go around and do what you want to do?"
[1:17:07] No, we're not a bunch of superheroes
[1:17:09] that wear our undies on the outside,
[1:17:11] running around at night and trying to
[1:17:12] save the day using our power because
[1:17:15] what what do they do? We know it's just
[1:17:16] a perversion, but they their human will
[1:17:19] will govern the powers that they have,
[1:17:22] &gt;&gt; right? It doesn't work that way with a
[1:17:24] believer.
[1:17:26] &gt;&gt; We don't use the Holy Ghost. The Holy
[1:17:27] Ghost uses us.
[1:17:29] &gt;&gt; Amen. It's like, I need to get the Holy
[1:17:30] Ghost. No, you just got to let the Holy
[1:17:32] Ghost get you.
[1:17:33] &gt;&gt; Stop stop pushing and pulling up and
[1:17:35] down and fussing and stressing. No, just
[1:17:37] let the Holy Ghost get you. Make a full
[1:17:39] surrender. That's and then and then what
[1:17:41] happens? He you become under his control
[1:17:43] and then now he can use you. Right? So
[1:17:46] if he wants you to speak to someone,
[1:17:48] that's him doing it.
[1:17:50] &gt;&gt; It's not you saying, "Well, I've got
[1:17:51] well all power of heaven and earth is in
[1:17:53] me because he's in me. Therefore, I can
[1:17:54] do what I want and humanly I can just
[1:17:56] dispense whatever." No, it's God living
[1:17:59] through you. Remember because like I
[1:18:01] said on Wednesday, the spirit is the
[1:18:03] sixth sense. God gave man five senses.
[1:18:06] They wasn't to control you. They're to
[1:18:08] contact your earthly home. But the sixth
[1:18:10] sense, which is faith, it leads you. It
[1:18:12] controls you. Amen. Because what happens
[1:18:15] is he comes onto the throne of your
[1:18:16] heart. He rules. So it's now his faith
[1:18:19] leading you. Like the apostle Paul would
[1:18:21] say, it's no longer I that liveth, but
[1:18:23] Christ that liveth in me. And the life I
[1:18:25] now live, I live by the faith of the son
[1:18:27] of God.
[1:18:28] &gt;&gt; Right? So now it's actually him
[1:18:30] controlling you and I because he's the
[1:18:32] intelligence. We're the body,
[1:18:34] &gt;&gt; right? So what he wants to do is lived
[1:18:36] out through you and I.
[1:18:38] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:18:39] &gt;&gt; Amen. Is this, you know, is this really
[1:18:42] the case? I thought, you know, because
[1:18:44] many people, I'm not saying here,
[1:18:45] they'll just take it like there's like
[1:18:47] God in his church or God in the
[1:18:49] believer. No, they're like this. This is
[1:18:52] atonement. So when the apostle Paul was,
[1:18:54] you say, well, what does Jesus say about
[1:18:56] this? I'm glad you asked that question.
[1:18:58] Okay. So, here is the Apostle Paul. He's
[1:19:00] on the road to Damascus, you know, and
[1:19:02] and in his in his heart, he's going to
[1:19:04] destroy all the Christians there. And
[1:19:06] Jesus, when he appeared to the Apostle
[1:19:08] Paul, the Apostle Paul fell down on the
[1:19:10] earth, and he heard a voice saying unto
[1:19:11] him, "Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou
[1:19:14] me?" He didn't say, "Why are you
[1:19:15] persecuting my believers?" Or, "Why are
[1:19:17] you persecuting my church?" He says,
[1:19:19] "Why are you persecuting me?" Amen.
[1:19:21] Brother Brham made the statement, "She
[1:19:23] is him." Right? She is him. Okay? That's
[1:19:25] a scriptural that's a scriptural quote
[1:19:27] cuz it's this right. So God did not say
[1:19:30] why are you persecuting them? Why are
[1:19:32] you persecuting me? Because why? Cuz God
[1:19:35] had given them the atonement. They had
[1:19:36] become one with God. That when Paul was
[1:19:39] handling the church, he was handling
[1:19:41] Christ.
[1:19:42] &gt;&gt; He was handling the believer. He's
[1:19:44] handling God in flesh when he took them
[1:19:46] to prison. And I say we got to be very
[1:19:48] careful how we handle one another. I
[1:19:50] mean, we got to have spiritual
[1:19:51] discernment to look beyond the veil and
[1:19:53] see the word in flesh. Amen. How we
[1:19:55] treat one another. The side comments and
[1:19:57] gossip. Those things, those things
[1:19:59] should not even be spoken among us. It
[1:20:02] should be good things spoken. It should
[1:20:04] be respectful things, kind things. Amen.
[1:20:06] Thoughtful things, not degrading things.
[1:20:08] We should be building each other up.
[1:20:10] Amen. Not just that, we should not be
[1:20:12] tearing one another down. And if you do
[1:20:14] that, if you're just all that that
[1:20:16] brother, this sister, I say, "Hold on.
[1:20:18] Maybe maybe take the glasses off
[1:20:21] &gt;&gt; and actually say, "Lord, reveal to me
[1:20:23] who they really are
[1:20:25] &gt;&gt; beyond their humanity."
[1:20:27] &gt;&gt; And I think you might get a voice like
[1:20:29] this saying, "Why are you persecuting
[1:20:30] me? Why are you rubbishing that person?
[1:20:33] Why you rubbishing me?"
[1:20:37] And he said, "Who are you, Lord?" And
[1:20:38] and the Lord said, "I am Jesus whom thou
[1:20:40] persecuteth."
[1:20:42] So if you touch, you're like brother
[1:20:43] Aaron makes a statement. He says if the
[1:20:45] devil goes after any of God's children,
[1:20:47] he's got Jesus Christ on his hands
[1:20:50] &gt;&gt; cuz Jesus Christ is within them. Amen.
[1:20:53] So, so God would say, "You're
[1:20:55] persecuting me, Saul, because you're
[1:20:57] touching my body."
[1:21:00] It's like if you cut my fingers off or
[1:21:02] try to, you're harming me cuz they're
[1:21:05] part of me. You can't divide, you can't
[1:21:07] remove my finger, it's part of me,
[1:21:10] right? And so, it's the same thing with
[1:21:12] you and I. We are part of the body of
[1:21:14] Christ. We are his body.
[1:21:18] Amen. And all that he is is now poured
[1:21:20] into you and I. And as he being the
[1:21:22] groom, the bride has come forth because
[1:21:23] it's part of him. And it can only be the
[1:21:25] manifestation of the fulfilling of all
[1:21:27] the revelations as as others has spoken
[1:21:30] of the bride. It can only manifest if it
[1:21:33] does something different from the groom,
[1:21:35] it isn't the bride. Amen. So if it's
[1:21:38] something different from the word, it's
[1:21:39] not the bride. Amen. Because she is the
[1:21:43] flesh of his flesh, bone of his bone,
[1:21:45] life of his life, power of his power.
[1:21:47] She is him.
[1:21:49] As man and woman are one and woman taken
[1:21:51] from the um from his side, she has taken
[1:21:54] a spirit, the feminist spirit from him,
[1:21:56] the flesh of his flesh, both made both
[1:21:58] mechanics and dynamics, the wife, the
[1:22:01] spirit of him and the flesh of him and
[1:22:02] put together as made both mechanics and
[1:22:05] dynamics. So it's not just the word, it
[1:22:07] is the anoint as the Holy Ghost on the
[1:22:09] word to make it live. Brother Bram said,
[1:22:11] "I'm not so interested so much in the
[1:22:13] mechanics. I want to see the dynamics of
[1:22:14] it. I want to see it live." So both of
[1:22:18] these things are in you and I. Amen.
[1:22:22] Praise the Lord. Now,
[1:22:25] so until the church becomes both
[1:22:27] dynamics and mechanics and the spirit of
[1:22:29] God that moved him to do the things that
[1:22:31] he did, if he hit on 16 cylinders, so
[1:22:33] will the bride. Amen. For he said in
[1:22:35] John 14:12, "He that believeth on me,
[1:22:37] the works that I do shall he do also.
[1:22:39] I'll give him a charge of my dynamics
[1:22:41] and his mechanics that the world will
[1:22:43] not be able to withstand it. I'll raise
[1:22:44] him up again at the last day. That's the
[1:22:46] Easter message. The dynamics and the
[1:22:48] mechanics together. The mechanics
[1:22:50] without the dynamics is no good. Neither
[1:22:51] is the dynamics without the mechanics.
[1:22:53] Amen. So, it's the spirit and the word
[1:22:55] coming together. And where is that
[1:22:57] coming together? In his body.
[1:22:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, all that he is is there. Now,
[1:23:01] God loves to God loves to display his
[1:23:04] attributes. And the only way he can
[1:23:06] display his attributes is when he
[1:23:08] becomes flesh.
[1:23:09] &gt;&gt; Like he says he you know he says that he
[1:23:11] loved fatherhood. God loves fatherhood
[1:23:14] for he was a father but the only way he
[1:23:16] could express it was to become a son a
[1:23:19] man. So his his his attributes can only
[1:23:23] be manifested really when it's put in
[1:23:25] flesh.
[1:23:27] So now this is why he uses his body
[1:23:30] because he wants all that he is is to be
[1:23:32] poured through you and I. Okay? So it's
[1:23:35] the same thing. Now if c if god is in
[1:23:38] you then mercy is in you.
[1:23:41] &gt;&gt; Okay. In the old testament there was the
[1:23:43] there was a tabernacle in the wilderness
[1:23:45] right there was the three rooms of it.
[1:23:47] In the inside is the holy of holies. The
[1:23:49] ark of the covenant with the blood is
[1:23:50] the mercy seat. Right? And mercy comes
[1:23:53] from that seat. Okay? Now that is
[1:23:55] actually representing the human body. We
[1:23:57] all know this, right? So now if the
[1:23:59] blood has been applied to that throne,
[1:24:01] right? And then what's under the mercy
[1:24:03] seat? It's the word. Amen. There's the
[1:24:05] there's the pot of mana and there's and
[1:24:07] there's Aaron's rod are in that room.
[1:24:10] Okay. So now what is it? There's a
[1:24:12] evidence of a life coming forth. Aaron's
[1:24:14] rod budding into almonds, right? There's
[1:24:17] mana. There's that word that never gets
[1:24:19] old within your soul. I mean, it's
[1:24:21] always fresh and wonderful. Tastes
[1:24:22] sweet. I mean, that's why I'm a sweet
[1:24:24] tooth. I believe. If you're savory,
[1:24:25] that's fine. But I like being sweet
[1:24:27] tooth. You see? And then what is there?
[1:24:28] There's the word. There's the law. But
[1:24:30] it's under the blood, under the mercy
[1:24:32] seat. I mean, so therefore, what are you
[1:24:34] being governed by? Not by that two
[1:24:35] tablets of stone of thou shalt, thou
[1:24:37] shalt not. We're not governed by that,
[1:24:39] friends. We're governed by the atoning
[1:24:41] blood on the mercy seat. I mean, why?
[1:24:43] Because the blood is applied to you.
[1:24:45] That life of God comes into you. And
[1:24:47] then what happens now is all that's in
[1:24:49] that ark now can be actually expressed
[1:24:51] through your life.
[1:24:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:54] Praise the Lord. That's why you speak to
[1:24:56] a real believer, so it's just like mana
[1:24:58] comes forth.
[1:25:00] &gt;&gt; The why? Because the word is alive to
[1:25:01] them. It's not stale. It's not rotting.
[1:25:03] It's not having to be preserved or put
[1:25:05] in the freezer to make it live a bit
[1:25:07] longer. No, it's alive. Amen. That's why
[1:25:09] it's so important where you you know
[1:25:11] that mana pot's fresh because the word
[1:25:14] still has meaning. It's still got power.
[1:25:16] It's still sweet. Amen. There's a
[1:25:17] goodness of God that flows out of
[1:25:19] someone's life. Amen. It's not some
[1:25:21] bitter thing. And oh yes, but you know
[1:25:23] there's no butt. So actually the only
[1:25:24] butt is but God rich in mercy. Amen. He
[1:25:27] can do it all. Amen. And hallelujah. But
[1:25:29] I like that. That was just fresh. But
[1:25:31] you see he said then there was the blood
[1:25:32] on the mercy seat. So it wasn't a
[1:25:34] judgment seat. You take someone who's
[1:25:36] always judgmental. Believer or not
[1:25:38] believer. I tell you what, they just
[1:25:39] need some blood put on that seat. So
[1:25:41] it's not a judgmental attitude and
[1:25:44] things coming out and trying to, you
[1:25:46] know, just you just tear and criticize
[1:25:48] everything down. No. Mercy can be
[1:25:49] dispensed.
[1:25:51] Amen. Because we got to understand that
[1:25:54] the mercy seat is not a piece of
[1:25:56] furniture. The shadow was, but it was
[1:25:58] pointing to a reality,
[1:26:00] &gt;&gt; right? Just like the seven golden
[1:26:01] candlesticks, that was a shadow pointing
[1:26:04] to a reality. The brazen altar, all
[1:26:05] those pieces of furniture, it's just a
[1:26:08] shadow. And why why would you know it's
[1:26:11] amazing how you know the Jews, they're
[1:26:12] looking for a red heer for waters of
[1:26:15] separation according to the scripture.
[1:26:16] You know, brother Bram says that real
[1:26:18] red heer is Christ. The waters of
[1:26:20] separation is the revealed word. But
[1:26:23] they're looking for shadows. I'm not
[1:26:24] looking for shadows. I'm looking for the
[1:26:26] real.
[1:26:26] &gt;&gt; Amen. I want the reality. If they found
[1:26:29] the ark of the covenant, that would all
[1:26:30] be very exciting. But it's just a
[1:26:31] shadow.
[1:26:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. It's it's pointing to you and I.
[1:26:35] &gt;&gt; Where God can be living, walking,
[1:26:37] talking through a people where his
[1:26:39] mercy, his love, his grace, his
[1:26:42] forgiveness can be manifested through
[1:26:44] you.
[1:26:46] Because as I said, the mercy seat back
[1:26:49] there or the ark of the covenant back
[1:26:51] there is just a shadow. Brother Ram says
[1:26:53] the real the real mercy seat was hanging
[1:26:56] on Calvary. The real one
[1:27:00] cuz the mercy seat is a person, right?
[1:27:03] He is he is a God rich in mercy. Amen.
[1:27:06] He is still on he is still interceding
[1:27:08] in the heavens,
[1:27:09] &gt;&gt; right? He's still actively working on
[1:27:12] your behalf, working for his bo,
[1:27:14] interceding for his body upon the earth.
[1:27:16] Amen. And that's why the blood is still
[1:27:18] here. Amen. Mercy is still here. But
[1:27:20] where is God going to manifest that
[1:27:22] mercy through through you and I?
[1:27:24] &gt;&gt; You say, "Well, how could that be if
[1:27:26] he's there and here?" Well, he said to
[1:27:27] Nicodemus, you know, no man's ascended
[1:27:29] to heaven but the son of man which is in
[1:27:31] heaven.
[1:27:31] &gt;&gt; And he was standing on the earth talking
[1:27:33] to Nicodemus. I'm not trying to confuse
[1:27:35] you a bit, but he's basically saying,
[1:27:37] I'm here and I'm there. Yes,
[1:27:39] &gt;&gt; God can be in more than one place. His
[1:27:42] corporal body's up there.
[1:27:44] &gt;&gt; We're going to meet him in the air.
[1:27:45] We're physically going to meet the Lord
[1:27:47] in the air. That's what believers
[1:27:48] believe. That's what the prophet taught,
[1:27:49] right? So, we're going to But where
[1:27:51] where is that mercy? Cuz all that he
[1:27:53] was, do you believe he's the fountain of
[1:27:55] mercy? Do you believe he has grace and
[1:27:57] truth? Do you believe he is has the
[1:27:59] power to forgive? Amen. To to atone, to
[1:28:02] reconcile. That ministry of
[1:28:03] reconciliation is in you and I. The
[1:28:06] scripture says if he is in you all those
[1:28:09] attributes can come out of you.
[1:28:11] &gt;&gt; If you got a religious spirit they
[1:28:13] won't. But if you have the spirit of
[1:28:15] Christ you got to realize actually mercy
[1:28:18] can be dispensed through me. Well well
[1:28:20] how can that be dispensed? Through
[1:28:22] prayer through a through a w you know
[1:28:24] through God speaking through your lips.
[1:28:27] You know someone can be bound up in
[1:28:28] their mind and then you walk by. Mercy
[1:28:31] flows. They become unbound. They get
[1:28:33] liberated. You know, someone can think
[1:28:35] maybe they've crossed the line, you
[1:28:37] know, cuz the devil's got them in a lie.
[1:28:39] They haven't crossed the line. If you
[1:28:40] got a hunger for God, you haven't
[1:28:41] crossed no line, right? But then they
[1:28:43] can be bound in that. Then what happens?
[1:28:45] You sit next to them. You begin to speak
[1:28:46] about the goodness of God. And and if
[1:28:48] you got a hunger, that means you haven't
[1:28:50] crossed the line. And what does that do?
[1:28:51] That's mercy coming to them. I mean,
[1:28:53] someone's lost. They're hungry for God.
[1:28:55] You can tell them your testimony of a
[1:28:57] God that lives. You can show how your
[1:28:59] candle got lit. What is that? That's
[1:29:00] mercy coming to them.
[1:29:03] That's not some scary thing.
[1:29:05] &gt;&gt; I know. I know you don't think it's
[1:29:07] scary, but I just want to like I just
[1:29:08] want you to realize what's in me.
[1:29:11] We don't have some dormant God living in
[1:29:13] us. He's not some dormant statue that
[1:29:16] just lives in our soul. He's living.
[1:29:17] He's speaking. He's working. He's
[1:29:20] expressing himself. He's revealing
[1:29:22] himself. He wants to grow in your life.
[1:29:24] He wants to live through your life. He's
[1:29:26] not a dormant thing.
[1:29:28] Amen. So, the real genuine lamb of God
[1:29:31] was hanging in plain view on Calvary,
[1:29:33] the real mercy seat.
[1:29:35] Oh, well, what about when he leaves the
[1:29:37] mercy seat in heaven? Well, it's because
[1:29:39] that's when the last name in the book is
[1:29:41] dipped in the blood and then he changes
[1:29:43] his garments cuz you're not going to
[1:29:46] meet your wife when you're covered in
[1:29:47] blood. I put it that way. You're going
[1:29:50] to change your garments, right? You're
[1:29:51] going to be dressed up. Then he's going
[1:29:53] to meet us in the air. You say, "Well,
[1:29:54] does that mean there's no more blood for
[1:29:55] anyone else?" Absolutely not. Because
[1:29:57] there's still mercy for the Jews.
[1:30:00] There's always going to be mercy because
[1:30:02] he is mercy. He is his attributes,
[1:30:06] right? Are we all together?
[1:30:07] &gt;&gt; You think, well, that he is mercy. So if
[1:30:10] he's in you, you'll be merciful. The
[1:30:13] biatitudes are more than just a nice
[1:30:14] thing. He sat down and he's expressing
[1:30:17] the characteristic of him in a people.
[1:30:20] Blessed are the merciful, for they shall
[1:30:22] obtain mercy. Well, that's the attribute
[1:30:24] of God, that mercy coming up. Blessed
[1:30:26] are the meek, you know, blessed are they
[1:30:29] hunger and thirst, they shall be filled.
[1:30:30] He's actually expressing this is what a
[1:30:32] Christian should be. He's painting a
[1:30:34] picture of a character that he's going
[1:30:36] to form in a people.
[1:30:40] Listen, as the father sent me, so do I
[1:30:42] send you. He didn't only send you. He
[1:30:44] goes with you. I'll be with you even in
[1:30:46] you to the end of the world. All that
[1:30:47] was in God was poured out into Christ.
[1:30:50] And all that was in Christ was emptied
[1:30:51] out into the belief of the church. God
[1:30:53] is with you. Lo, I'm with you always,
[1:30:55] even to the end of the world. That's a
[1:30:56] declaration of God's word. That's what
[1:30:58] the Bible says. That's what I believe. I
[1:31:01] just colored in the title, proof of of
[1:31:03] his resurrection,
[1:31:04] &gt;&gt; cuz he's proving now this is actually
[1:31:06] the proof of his resurrection is God
[1:31:09] living through a people.
[1:31:12] Amen. I believe it. So therefore, now if
[1:31:15] if God has seven compound names, they're
[1:31:18] in you. If Jesus is in you, I'm just I
[1:31:22] I'm just kind of repeating. I I just
[1:31:23] want this to sink in. Let's just kind
[1:31:25] of, you know, let's just roast this for
[1:31:27] a little bit. Let's cook it a little
[1:31:29] bit. Okay. I want this to be seasoned,
[1:31:31] right? I just want So So now he is what
[1:31:33] is he? He is Jehovah Gyra. The Lord will
[1:31:36] provide himself a sacrifice. Amen. That
[1:31:39] means that attribute is in you. If Jesus
[1:31:41] is in you, right? I am Jehovah Rafa. The
[1:31:44] Lord is our healer.
[1:31:45] &gt;&gt; Right? Where does healing come through?
[1:31:47] Through his body. Amen.
[1:31:50] &gt;&gt; Cornelius was praying in his house. Acts
[1:31:52] chapter 10. An angel comes to Cornelius.
[1:31:56] He says, "Your prayers and arms have
[1:31:57] come before God." He doesn't say, "No,
[1:31:59] I'm going to tell you the gospel and I'm
[1:32:01] going I'm going to tell you what God has
[1:32:02] done in your day." He says, "Actually,
[1:32:04] go get part of God's body. Go get
[1:32:06] Peter." He's in Japa because m because
[1:32:09] God's word manifests through his body.
[1:32:12] &gt;&gt; Right? So Peter came. We know the story,
[1:32:15] right?
[1:32:16] &gt;&gt; Yes. You say, "Well, God doesn't use his
[1:32:18] body." He does use his body. He wants to
[1:32:20] use you. Don't let the devil try and put
[1:32:22] some blockage in your mind thinking,
[1:32:23] "Well, God can use maybe the pastor or
[1:32:25] the deacons or someone. He can't use
[1:32:27] me." He can use all of us.
[1:32:29] &gt;&gt; If God is in you, he can use you.
[1:32:31] &gt;&gt; Whatever attribute he wants to display
[1:32:33] through your life, he can display it.
[1:32:37] Amen. He is He is Jehovani, the buckler,
[1:32:39] the shield of peace. He's Jehovah
[1:32:41] Shalom.
[1:32:43] You ever come, you ever been troubled
[1:32:44] and you're talking to a believer? Peace
[1:32:46] just comes. Where'd that peace come
[1:32:49] from? From one to the other.
[1:32:55] All these all these names,
[1:32:58] redemptive names gathered up in one
[1:32:59] lovely big name, Jesus Christ. And in
[1:33:01] their rest all the fulfilling of the
[1:33:03] compound redemptive names of Jehovah. So
[1:33:06] all his attributes are in you. His
[1:33:10] church is not a bunch of people who
[1:33:12] argue doctrine.
[1:33:14] This just stood out to me. I was
[1:33:15] listening to this. He says, "Now, if I
[1:33:17] take if I take the Presbyterian doctrine
[1:33:19] and you Pentecostals till you don't know
[1:33:22] and tie you Pentecostals till you don't
[1:33:23] know, I can take the Baptist doctrine
[1:33:25] and show you Pentecostals a million
[1:33:26] things you know nothing of." That's
[1:33:28] right. But that's not it. Amen. That's
[1:33:30] not his church. That's not his church.
[1:33:32] His church is himself revealed. Amen. So
[1:33:36] if you have someone who's arguing
[1:33:37] doctrine and fussing and fighting is the
[1:33:39] message right and wrong and this is
[1:33:40] right and wrong. That's not his body.
[1:33:43] That's just people arguing.
[1:33:46] You with me? This is not that that that
[1:33:48] is not even close to what it is.
[1:33:50] &gt;&gt; What it is is himself revealed
[1:33:52] &gt;&gt; through a people his word putting on
[1:33:54] flesh that you become a living epistle
[1:33:56] read known of all men. Amen. That
[1:33:58] everything they read about Jesus and and
[1:34:00] the Holy Ghost doing in the Bible they
[1:34:02] see it in your life.
[1:34:03] &gt;&gt; Amen. That is what the church is. It's
[1:34:05] himself being made known to the world.
[1:34:08] Amen. Do you see it expressed by the
[1:34:10] word itself that he is God? Amen. This
[1:34:14] is this is what his church is.
[1:34:16] Transcends argument, transcends all
[1:34:17] these things. No, it's that God all that
[1:34:19] he is can be is poured into you that he
[1:34:21] can pour himself out to this world.
[1:34:24] Amen. He is the thing. He was the
[1:34:26] prophets. I'm going to I'm going to wind
[1:34:27] this up. Um he was the prophets. He was
[1:34:30] in them. He was in the Psalms. He was
[1:34:32] the history. He's the things to come.
[1:34:33] He's the same yesterday, today, and
[1:34:35] forever. Hebrews 13:8. If you're writing
[1:34:37] it down, he should be then he should be
[1:34:39] the principle. Uh that is what he is and
[1:34:42] we believe it, don't we? Then if he is
[1:34:43] that, then he should be the principal
[1:34:45] theme of our talking. He should be the
[1:34:47] principal theme of our thinking, of our
[1:34:49] singing, of our walks. Amen. He should
[1:34:51] be the principal theme of our life.
[1:34:54] Amen. If he is the principal theme of
[1:34:55] the Bible, and the Bible's in us, then
[1:34:57] it should be the principal theme of
[1:34:59] everything we say, do, or think should
[1:35:00] be Christ. If he's the king in our
[1:35:03] lives,
[1:35:04] &gt;&gt; if we are his body, it's his thinking
[1:35:06] coming through us, then all that we
[1:35:08] should do is actually he should be the
[1:35:10] principal theme of our lives. You
[1:35:12] realize that we actually have an
[1:35:14] incredible high and holy calling that
[1:35:17] God could display himself to the world
[1:35:19] through you and I. What kind of people
[1:35:21] ought we to be? You say, "Well, I have
[1:35:23] my humanity." Let's go beyond that for a
[1:35:25] second. What kind of attitude should we
[1:35:27] be carrying?
[1:35:29] Is she an attitude of Lord your mercy so
[1:35:31] great Lord I want Lord you want to use
[1:35:33] me as a pipe as a channel to this world
[1:35:36] here I am Lord whatever you want me to
[1:35:38] do Lord Lord may I have a loving kind
[1:35:41] thoughtful attitude towards everybody
[1:35:44] amen may I have a good me and even
[1:35:46] against your enemies you should have a
[1:35:47] good attitude
[1:35:49] &gt;&gt; oh but they they're so cruel and mean
[1:35:51] and they say all these things it should
[1:35:53] be actually father forgive them they
[1:35:54] don't know what they do
[1:35:57] we anyone who wants to see someone lost
[1:35:59] or have a terrible life, they have they
[1:36:02] have actually got a wrong mind.
[1:36:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. Actually, if you have the mind of
[1:36:06] Christ, you should want to see good in
[1:36:08] everyone. See everyone prosper, everyone
[1:36:10] do well, everyone find the Lord,
[1:36:12] everyone be there on the other side,
[1:36:13] that should be our heart,
[1:36:15] &gt;&gt; right? So, if he is within us now and he
[1:36:18] can dispense mercy, grace, healing,
[1:36:21] peace, the Holy Ghost can get a hold of
[1:36:23] someone through our life, what kind of
[1:36:25] people should we be? what kind of
[1:36:27] attitude you'll be carrying around. Not
[1:36:29] a selfish attitude and what I can get
[1:36:31] and me and fussing and fighting and
[1:36:32] what's not convenient. I'm not going to
[1:36:34] do it. We shouldn't have a selfish bone
[1:36:36] in our bodies. He didn't. And we're his
[1:36:38] body.
[1:36:40] Amen.
[1:36:43] Now, I'm just going to maybe let's have
[1:36:46] the musicians this morning and we're
[1:36:47] just going to finish.
[1:36:54] Brother Ram says this, and to me this is
[1:36:56] more than a quote. He says, "If I told
[1:36:58] you if I was John Dillinger or the
[1:37:00] spirit of John Dillinger was on me, you
[1:37:03] would look me to have guns and act like
[1:37:05] John Dillinger. But if I told you I was
[1:37:07] an artist and the spirit of a great
[1:37:09] artist was on me, you'd expect me to
[1:37:11] paint pictures of an artist. Is that
[1:37:13] right? If I told you I was an expert
[1:37:15] mechanic and the mechanic spirit was on
[1:37:17] me, you'd expect me to know what was
[1:37:19] wrong with your car. If I tell you that
[1:37:21] I was born of the spirit of God and the
[1:37:24] spirit of Jesus Christ was on me, you'd
[1:37:25] expect me to do what he did, act like he
[1:37:28] did. That's his spirit working through a
[1:37:30] human being. Do you believe that? His
[1:37:32] spirit working on a uh worked on a brass
[1:37:34] serpent one time. Do you believe that?
[1:37:36] And and on the pool of Bethesda uh uh
[1:37:38] water chopped up, troubled water ever
[1:37:40] who stepped in there believing they
[1:37:42] received their healing. Is that right?
[1:37:44] Could the water say, "Look what a great
[1:37:45] water I am." No. It was the angel on the
[1:37:48] water that done the healing. Not the
[1:37:49] water, the angel. When the angel went
[1:37:51] away, it was just water. Men are just
[1:37:53] men, but it's God's agency. God doesn't
[1:37:55] fall upon denominations. God doesn't
[1:37:58] fall upon mechanical devices. God, the
[1:38:01] Holy Spirit fell upon men. Man is God's
[1:38:04] agent. And the hardest thing that God
[1:38:06] has ever had to do was to get one mortal
[1:38:08] to believe another.
[1:38:11] &gt;&gt; So, you are God's agency.
[1:38:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:38:13] &gt;&gt; Amen. If he is in you, all that all that
[1:38:15] was in Christ is now poured into you.
[1:38:17] Then God can use you as an agency to
[1:38:19] manifest all of his nature, all of his
[1:38:22] character, all of his attributes to this
[1:38:25] world.
[1:38:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. Christ in you, the hope of glory.
[1:38:31] We have an we are blessed people
[1:38:34] &gt;&gt; to have God deity is not just in heaven.
[1:38:36] It's in you.
[1:38:38] &gt;&gt; And God wants to manifest all that he is
[1:38:39] through your life. Amen. Let's stand,
[1:38:42] shall we? This morning.
[1:38:47] Amen. I just want to sing. Let's sing
[1:38:49] something happy. Eh, let's sing um I
[1:38:51] have a reason to worship.
[1:38:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:38:53] &gt;&gt; I have a reason to praise you.
[1:39:08] Before
[1:39:11] [music]
[1:39:21] the [music and singing] world began, you
[1:39:23] knew my name. You held me in your hand.
[1:39:29] When the earth [music]
[1:39:30] was silent, I was there with you. Sing
[1:39:35] your praise.
[1:39:38] I [music] came to you.
[1:39:43] I took [singing] my first bre
[1:39:48] [music]
[1:39:50] sing.
[1:39:53] I have a reason to worship. [music]
[1:39:57] I have a reason to praise you.
[1:40:01] [music] I have a reason to lift up my
[1:40:05] hands [singing] and rejoice. I have a
[1:40:07] reason to see.
[1:40:11] When I was lost in [music] the darkness,
[1:40:15] you came [singing]
[1:40:16] to find me.
[1:40:20] I heard you [music and singing] calling
[1:40:22] my name. Took my sin and my shame and
[1:40:25] you save me.
[1:40:28] Now I can call you [music] my savior.
[1:40:33] I can call you redeemer.
[1:40:37] I can call you [music] my healer, my
[1:40:40] father, [singing] my friend. I can call
[1:40:42] you my [music] king.
[1:40:46] When I started my journey, I didn't know
[1:40:51] that I [music] was not alone.
[1:40:55] You were there [singing] with me in
[1:40:58] every high and every low.
[1:41:04] He started [singing] to call [music] me
[1:41:08] from eternity.
[1:41:13] Salvation rung [music] out through your
[1:41:15] blood. I redeemed.
[1:41:19] I have a reason to worship.
[1:41:23] [music]
[1:41:23] I have a reason to praise you.
[1:41:28] I [music and singing] have a reason to
[1:41:29] lift up my hands and rejoice. I have a
[1:41:33] reason to see. [music]
[1:41:36] When I was lost in the darkness, [music]
[1:41:41] you came to find [singing] me.
[1:41:45] [music]
[1:41:46] And I heard you call in my name, took my
[1:41:49] sin and my chain, and you save me.
[1:41:53] [music]
[1:41:54] Now I can call you my savior.
[1:41:59] I [music] can call you redeemer.
[1:42:04] I can call you [music] my healer, my
[1:42:06] father, my friend. I can call you my
[1:42:10] king. [music]
[1:42:14] Hosana.
[1:42:16] Jesus [music and singing] has conquered
[1:42:18] the grave.
[1:42:23] [music] Hosana.
[1:42:25] I was lost. Now I am saved.
[1:42:30] Hosana.
[1:42:32] Hosana.
[1:42:34] Jesus [music] has conquered the grave.
[1:42:41] Hosana. [music]
[1:42:43] I was lost. Now [singing] I am saved.
[1:42:48] [music] I have a reason to worship.
[1:42:52] I have a reason to praise you.
[1:42:57] I have a reason to lift up my hands and
[1:43:00] rejoice. I have a reason to sing.
[1:43:06] When I [music] was lost in the darkness,
[1:43:11] you [music] came to find me.
[1:43:15] I heard [music] you call in my name.
[1:43:18] Took my sin and my shame and [singing]
[1:43:20] you save me.
[1:43:24] Now I can call you my savior.
[1:43:27] [music]
[1:43:28] I can call you my healer.
[1:43:33] I can call you [music and singing] my
[1:43:34] healer. My father, my friend. I can call
[1:43:38] you my healer. [music]
[1:43:42] I can call you my healer. My father,
[1:43:45] [singing] my friend. I can call you
[1:43:48] [music] my
[1:43:50] king.
[1:43:52] &gt;&gt; [applause]
[1:44:02] &gt;&gt; He will [music] fill your heart
[1:44:04] [singing] today to overflow
[1:44:08] as the Lord commanded you. Bring your
[1:44:12] [music] vessels not a few. For he will
[1:44:15] fill your heart today to overflow
[1:44:20] with the Holy Ghost [music]
[1:44:24] and power.

[1:44:33] as the Lord commanded you. Bring your
[1:44:36] vessels not a few. He will [music] fill
[1:44:40] your heart today [singing] to overflow.

[1:44:57] as the Lord commanded [music] you. Bring
[1:45:00] your vessels not [singing] a few. He
[1:45:04] will [music] fill your heart today to
[1:45:07] overflow
[1:45:10] with the Holy [music]
[1:45:12] Ghost.
[1:45:16] It is joy [music and singing]
[1:45:18] I speak joy and full of glory. Full
[1:45:24] glory.
[1:45:30] Hang on. Full and
[1:45:34] unspeakable
[1:45:35] and full of glory. [music]
[1:45:38] Full [singing] of glory.
[1:45:41] full of glory. [music]
[1:45:43] It is joy unspeakable and full of glory.
[1:45:48] [singing] And the has [music] never yet
[1:45:52] been so good. I have [singing] found his
[1:45:56] graces all.
[1:46:00] He supply [music]
[1:46:02] every need.
[1:46:05] While I sit and learn at Jesus,
[1:46:10] I am free. Yes, freed.
[1:46:14] Oh, it is joy. It is [music and singing]
[1:46:16] joy unspeakable and full of glory.
[1:46:22] Full of glory. [singing and music] Oh,
[1:46:24] it's full of glory. It is joy
[1:46:28] unspeakable [music]
[1:46:29] and full of glory. And the heart
[1:46:32] [singing]
[1:46:33] has never yet been told.
[1:46:37] I have found [music]
[1:46:38] the pleasure [singing] I once with his
[1:46:43] joy and peace within.
[1:46:47] Oh, what a [singing] wonderous blessing
[1:46:51] I [music] am from the awful
[1:46:56] love. Oh, it is joy. It is joy
[1:47:00] unspeakable

[1:47:11] unspeakable and full of glory
[1:47:14] [music and singing] and the has never
[1:47:17] yet been told.
[1:47:20] I have found that hope so brighting.
[1:47:25] Living in the [music and singing] realm
[1:47:28] of grace.
[1:47:30] Oh, the Savior's presence is so neat.
[1:47:35] [music] I can see his smiling.
[1:47:40] Oh, it is joy. It is joy unspeakable and
[1:47:44] full of glory. [music]
[1:47:47] Oh, glory. It is full of glory. [music]
[1:47:52] It is joy unspeakable and full glory in
[1:47:57] the heart has never yet been told.
[1:48:03] I have found the [music and singing] joy
[1:48:05] no tongue tends to
[1:48:09] waves of glory [music] roll.
[1:48:13] It is like a great [singing]
[1:48:17] flowing
[1:48:20] within [music and singing] my for it is
[1:48:23] joy. It is joy unspeakable
[1:48:27] and full of glory full [music] of glory
[1:48:32] [singing]
[1:48:33] of glory. It is joy unspeakable and

[1:53:51] that I could do it sitting down because
[1:53:54] when Jesus spoke the sermon on the
[1:53:55] mount, I believe it says he sat down and
[1:53:56] taught the people.

[1:54:16] big band or the newbies and everyone
[1:54:18] meet here at 1:00. Okay, let's just
[1:54:20] pray. Thank you, Lord Jesus, that we can
[1:54:21] be here today. Thank you for your
[1:54:23] presence amongst us, Lord. Thank you for
[1:54:24] a word, Lord, that builds faith, Lord,
[1:54:26] and that, Lord, for not only your
[1:54:29] eternal word, Lord, that's that's
[1:54:32] bound us together with you, Lord, and
[1:54:33] made us one with you, Lord. But then
[1:54:35] there's there's brethren like brother
[1:54:37] Ben, Lord, that will minister that word,
