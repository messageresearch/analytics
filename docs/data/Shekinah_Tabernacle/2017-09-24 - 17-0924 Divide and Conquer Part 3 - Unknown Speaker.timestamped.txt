[42:03] Nehemiah 4 and 1 and so while I'm away

[42:18] time and yeah I just trust that yeah god
[42:22] bless you till we see each other next
[42:24] week into next week so let's read
[42:27] Nehemiah chapter 4 and verses 1 to 9 and
[42:31] then we're going to read one scripture
[42:34] from Proverbs 25 and 28 I mean we're all
[42:49] there but it came to pass that when
[42:55] sanballat hurt that he builded the wall
[42:57] he was wroth and took great indignation
[43:00] among the Jews and he spake before his
[43:02] brethren and the army of samaria and
[43:04] said what do to these feeble jews will
[43:07] they fortify themselves will they
[43:09] sacrifice or they make an end in a day
[43:11] will they revive the stones out of the
[43:14] heaps of the rubbish which are burnt and
[43:16] the answer is yes they will
[43:18] Tobiah em was by him and he said even
[43:21] that which they built if a fox go up he
[43:25] shall even break down their stone wall
[43:27] here o our God for we are despised and
[43:31] turn their approach upon their own head
[43:33] and give them for a prey in the land of
[43:35] activity and cover not their iniquity
[43:38] and let not their sin be blotted out
[43:39] from before thee for they have provoked
[43:42] me to anger before the builders so we
[43:45] built the wall and all the wall was
[43:47] joined together under half their all for
[43:48] the people had a mind to work it came to
[43:51] pass that when Sanballat and Tobiah
[43:54] and the Arabians and the ammonites and
[43:56] the azure delights heard that the walls
[43:59] of jerusalem were made up and that the
[44:01] breaches begin to be stopped then they
[44:03] were very wrong so they got more men and
[44:06] conspired all of them together to come
[44:09] in to fight against Jerusalem and two
[44:11] hundred nevertheless we made our prayer
[44:14] unto our God and set a watch against
[44:17] them day and night
[44:17] because of them and now let's go to
[44:21] proverbs chapter 25 and we're gonna read
[44:25] proverbs 25 and verse 28
[44:42] is that I mean is everyone there you
[44:48] know it's not fair when it's SWAT kept
[44:52] it to what it you know it's harder when
[44:54] you gotta turn the pages of the Bible
[44:56] but hey as long as we read the same
[44:58] things as fine I've in proverbs 25 and
[45:02] 28 he that hath no rule over his own
[45:05] spirit as like a city that is broken
[45:08] down and without walls
[45:10] Amen may the Lord leases were this
[45:12] morning you may have your seats now I'd
[45:17] like to continue my thought about divide
[45:20] and conquer and I'd like to pick up
[45:22] where I was in the first part of this
[45:24] about rebuilding the city and we know
[45:30] from the scripture that Jerusalem the
[45:34] rebuilding of Jerusalem here under
[45:37] Niemeyer and under under Israel and
[45:39] under them that were anointed to rebuild
[45:41] the city and it is the same so in the
[45:44] natural there in the Old Testament it
[45:46] isn't a spiritual in the New Testament
[45:48] so so we are Jerusalem we are that city
[45:52] that's being rebuilt and there comes a
[45:56] point in life where you must recognize
[45:58] God the work he started in your life he
[46:01] will complete it so once we were in
[46:05] chaos once we were broken down once the
[46:09] enemy could just come in and go out and
[46:11] have his way and you know but then there
[46:13] came a time where we're a place of
[46:15] worship was was restored we're a temple
[46:18] was built but that still does not mean
[46:22] that there is the enemy can still have
[46:24] access into that place maybe there's you
[46:27] become the hot place of God's worship by
[46:29] coming under by receiving the Holy
[46:31] Spirit you are you are placed in God's
[46:34] provided place of worship which is Jesus
[46:37] Christ and so a place of worship as is
[46:39] established but then the walls have to
[46:42] rebuilt in your life there has to be a
[46:44] defense against the works of the enemy
[46:46] and now you see here when the believers
[46:49] were anointed a near Myers day to
[46:52] rebuild Jerusalem notice the people
[46:56] around or I'd say the spirits around
[46:58] them they didn't say well we'll just
[47:00] leave them you know let them rebuild
[47:02] this place and we'll see how they do
[47:04] they became angry they became rough
[47:07] Rothfuss anger they were angry at what
[47:10] the believers were doing they were not
[47:12] happy with what they were doing because
[47:14] we won't read it but if you read the
[47:16] book of Nehemiah but earlier than
[47:18] Chapter four they actually wanted to
[47:20] help build but then the Jews that
[47:22] believers said no you have no part in
[47:24] this you have no part in this
[47:26] restoration only God's children have a
[47:28] part in this restoration which is you
[47:30] right and so now they got rough when the
[47:36] walls were being rebuilt now when when
[47:39] you read about them rebuilding Jerusalem
[47:41] they didn't just you know it wasn't just
[47:44] a level place and then they laid the
[47:45] entire foundation I mean they laid the
[47:48] entire bottom section and it all went
[47:50] together that they were rebuilding
[47:51] different parts so there's one stitch
[47:54] and there was totally rebuilt there's
[47:56] another section where the enemy could
[47:58] just step across a few a few stones on
[48:00] the ground right so so it was being
[48:03] rebuilt at different stages now same
[48:06] thing with you there's some things that
[48:08] devil will never come against you to
[48:09] tempt you with because because there's
[48:12] nothing in you that wants that you know
[48:14] there's no there's a defense
[48:15] there's your the wall has been rebuilt
[48:18] in that part of your life
[48:19] so if would come to something like you
[48:21] get got delivered from like alcohol or
[48:23] or smoking or whatever it may be the
[48:26] devil will never come and try and attack
[48:28] you at that again because why would he
[48:30] try and you know why would he build a
[48:32] you know a siege Tower and try and dig
[48:35] under a wall and you know attack a
[48:37] well-fortified piece of a wall of a city
[48:39] when he can just step down here a little
[48:41] bit and just walk across why would you
[48:44] do that that makes no sense so it's the
[48:46] same thing with you and I there's
[48:48] there's parts of our lives that are
[48:49] fortified and there's a garrison
[48:52] there's trained men on the wall and
[48:54] there's the you know this the is not
[48:56] just the barrel mints but the hoarding
[48:58] that's been put up you know if you know
[49:00] anything about castle warfare how they
[49:02] just wouldn't have the stone wall but
[49:04] actually build another part that's
[49:06] called the hoarding over the top of it
[49:07] whether when the arches could stay
[49:09] they're on the battlements they could
[49:11] fire through slits and the and the
[49:13] enemy's arrows couldn't hit them so it's
[49:15] all fortified you got your catapult
[49:17] ready you're all there
[49:18] and so there's parts of your life the
[49:20] devil's not going to attack you then why
[49:22] would he he's not dumb you know he looks
[49:25] stupid he's very cunning
[49:28] he's a very intellectual smart enemy and
[49:31] he studies you a good general studies
[49:34] their opponent and they look at their
[49:36] strengths and look at their weaknesses
[49:38] and you don't try and go I'm just going
[49:40] to hit them in their strengths then you
[49:42] always try to exploit the weakness
[49:43] because you want your victories to be a
[49:46] glorious victory you don't just want a
[49:49] you know a close victory or is even I
[49:52] can't remember the word but there's a
[49:54] type of there is actually worse off than
[49:57] the defeated because in the long term
[49:59] they lose so many men that in the
[50:01] campaign next he ends up in a defeat
[50:03] even though they may win one battle got
[50:06] me bored at school but it is such a
[50:07] thing and so we you got to watch the
[50:11] breaches and your life member we're
[50:14] being rebuilt
[50:15] we're being rebuilt we're a pile of
[50:18] rubble we were a pile of rubble I mean
[50:21] but then God came is it God said I'm
[50:23] going to restore save the Lord I'm going
[50:25] to rebuild the people in my image amen
[50:28] to the enemy can be he can be rampant he
[50:31] can be attacking on every side but
[50:33] there'll be a people I mean there'll be
[50:35] a fortress there'll be a place of
[50:37] defense
[50:38] hallelujah where the enemy can't get in
[50:40] there's no breach there's no gap
[50:42] hallelujah
[50:43] there's no way he can get in but we have
[50:47] to be rebuilt
[50:48] hallelujah and we are being rebuilt
[50:51] aren't you glad immense that's why the
[50:55] enemy when the when the church comes
[51:00] it's been in every age when a people
[51:01] begin to embrace the truth in the enemy
[51:04] gets mad the end the enemy comes against
[51:07] those people it's not about thee you
[51:09] know you go back into Jesus's day you
[51:12] could have joined the Pharisees or the
[51:14] Sadducees or the road Ian's if I'm going
[51:17] to be go for it I may not understand
[51:19] what you're getting into it's a bit
[51:21] different kind of religion
[51:23] go for it but then what imagine one day
[51:26] said now I'm gonna follow this Jesus of
[51:27] Nazareth let's say away from this man
[51:30] had nothing to do with them human people
[51:33] became angry the scribes and Pharisees
[51:36] they became angry how can we destroy him
[51:38] they filled with Ross why because the
[51:42] people were being gathered to be rebuilt
[51:45] how they should have been rebuilt in the
[51:47] beginning I mean that we weren't where
[51:49] it meant to be slaves to the enemy and
[51:52] be a city like without walls but would
[51:55] have a defense when the enemy comes in
[51:58] like a flood or raise up a standard
[52:00] hallelujah so we're not just tossed to
[52:03] and fro by every every feeling or every
[52:06] doctrine or every change in the change
[52:08] in the you know culture or wherever we
[52:11] are or we stand firm and sink or drown
[52:14] good times or bad times pestilence
[52:18] famine whatever it may be victory
[52:20] victory
[52:21] I'd rather die fighting for him I'd
[52:26] rather die on the field standing for my
[52:29] lord amen then there'd be a traitor or
[52:33] or surrender I'd rather die with a sword
[52:36] in my hand
[52:37] wouldn't you amen so it's that yeah
[52:40] that's how we should be if I perish I
[52:42] perish
[52:43] Amen but I don't want to die coward I
[52:46] don't want to just give up to the enemy
[52:48] he doesn't take prisoners Amen he
[52:52] doesn't he has nothing good to give you
[52:55] so we you know Paul says that we are not
[52:58] ignorant to the devil's devices so we
[53:01] should know exactly what he does and how
[53:03] he does it because we can identify what
[53:06] he does and we then it's not a surprise
[53:08] when he comes against us you know that's
[53:11] why it's so it's so precious in this day
[53:14] when you look at the anointings that
[53:17] have been on the church from from from
[53:19] Calvary that's the Holy Ghost but in
[53:20] four different ways he not come on it on
[53:23] the church yeah the first one was the
[53:25] line anointing the word went forth from
[53:27] boldness now as to combat the Antichrist
[53:29] spirit what he was doing and then he a
[53:32] minute changed from that anointing to an
[53:34] ox anointing where the people were told
[53:37] repeat a recant or burn and they said oh
[53:40] I'll take the burden and they took it
[53:42] and they were tortured and they rejoiced
[53:45] and they overcame because the anointing
[53:50] that was upon them it wasn't humanly
[53:52] them doing it it was God's anointing
[53:54] caused him to overcome and then of
[53:57] course the devil changed his tactics
[53:58] again and then it came a man's anointing
[54:01] and intelligence that's where this time
[54:03] of the Reformation where where great
[54:05] learning men you knew multiple languages
[54:08] could translate the Bible you know they
[54:11] could understand telogen s--
[54:13] but those those those creatures are man
[54:16] and ox and an eagle I mean a man an ox
[54:19] and a lion they're all earthbound they
[54:23] can't see very far but then the last
[54:25] ones the anointing of an eagle and an
[54:28] eagle is Fleiss high he flies high up
[54:31] and he can see very far so these so the
[54:34] man or the lion or the Hawks they can
[54:36] just be walking around what's going on I
[54:39] can't see over that hill let's ask
[54:42] brother Eagle what's going on 15 miles
[54:45] north the enemies there 7 miles
[54:48] southeast there he's he's just over the
[54:53] hill but you you would he's asleep
[54:56] attack but they wouldn't know that if
[54:58] they're just walking along you know
[55:00] sometimes that ambush is a surprise on
[55:02] both sides but an eagle can see and
[55:06] that's why it's so precious the
[55:08] anointing that's come upon the bride in
[55:10] this last age we've been lifted up and
[55:13] we can see from eternity to eternity and
[55:16] we can see what the enemy is doing amen
[55:20] we're not stumbling along blind I trust
[55:22] you not we're not ignorant of his
[55:25] devices remember his killing machine is
[55:28] very it's become very efficient he's
[55:33] refined as methods the enemy has his
[55:36] killing machine yo is not a it's very
[55:39] calculated you just taken the natural
[55:42] you know marketing campaigns and and
[55:45] advertising and certain products there's
[55:48] a lot of research and development
[55:50] that goes into new new technology or new
[55:54] you know big companies they put out new
[55:56] products that's not just I do you think
[55:58] this will work yard might work let's try
[56:00] it there's a lot of planning there's a
[56:03] lot of you know strategy you know they
[56:06] they pick certain times in the year when
[56:08] they release things and it's to show
[56:10] that the it's not a head and mists of
[56:13] fear how even just natural business
[56:15] works
[56:16] it's a refined it's a refined thing now
[56:20] if that's the way just in case your
[56:22] business how much more now you know even
[56:25] you take McDonald's and how the
[56:28] restaurants are made and how the seats
[56:30] are and how the lighting is and how the
[56:33] music is and the decor and the colors
[56:36] and all the and how the food that's all
[56:38] actually been thought out and it's
[56:41] actually been tested and they've done
[56:43] studies and they say well this is how it
[56:45] works this is how we'll do it
[56:47] that is true so if that's the case just
[56:51] a natural how about a being you know
[56:54] that that that walk in the garden of God
[56:57] that was the anointed cherub that
[56:59] covereth loose you're the devil himself
[57:02] Lucifer how much more him that's had
[57:04] thousands of years to study you to study
[57:08] you're not the first human he studied
[57:10] you're not the first one you know he's
[57:14] been studying man since he since he made
[57:16] me go through the serpent look through
[57:18] the bushes and so Adam and Eve they're
[57:20] in the garden he studied them he's
[57:23] looking for a weak point he found a weak
[57:25] point and here we are and soon for the
[57:28] world is what the bride has redeemed but
[57:30] he studies you now if that's the case
[57:35] when you study something I'm laboring on
[57:38] the spawn so when you understand he's
[57:39] very efficient at what he does he's very
[57:42] good at what he does I'm not giving him
[57:44] too much credit because our God is
[57:46] greater than her I mean it we have
[57:48] nothing to fear but we just can't walk
[57:49] on blindly that's why it's so glorious
[57:52] we're where we've been anointed and we
[57:54] were lifted up and we can see what he's
[57:57] doing and then some eagles that there
[57:59] eat snakes and they grab the snake and
[58:02] they lift them up hallelujah and
[58:04] soon as the snake goes off the ground it
[58:07] can't a cat moves like it should
[58:09] actually loses its power you seen those
[58:11] kind Eagles I mean it's just like you oh
[58:14] there's the enemy grab them by the
[58:15] talons lift up into heavenly places
[58:18] hallelujah now I've got you boy what you
[58:20] gonna do amen we have no we don't need
[58:25] to be scared of anything you know we
[58:27] don't know to be we don't need to be
[58:29] afraid of what tomorrow faces I mean
[58:31] you're what we may face we don't need to
[58:34] be scared what's going to happen I know
[58:36] what's going to happen this body is
[58:39] going to be changed I'm going to walk on
[58:41] streets of gold I mean the Bible speaks
[58:44] of the enemy will be under your feet I
[58:47] mean this maybe let's maybe go to Psalms

[1:03:13] promise in the Bible every promise in
[1:03:15] the Bible is mine every chapter reverse
[1:03:17] every line I mean we talk about healing
[1:03:19] or deliverance but I'll tread upon him
[1:03:22] he's going to be under my feet
[1:03:24] hallelujah
[1:03:25] so now if that is the case we're gonna
[1:03:28] be a walled city I'm just gonna bring it
[1:03:31] back into near my that means the enemy
[1:03:32] won't be able to - he may come against
[1:03:35] us but we'll we'll stand and the
[1:03:38] beautiful thing I'd say I just love I'm
[1:03:40] I just loved kind of warfare and oh yeah
[1:03:43] but in a city that have little gates
[1:03:46] hidden gates in the wall and they call
[1:03:48] it a sally port where the where the
[1:03:50] defenders would actually rush out and
[1:03:52] that attacked the your attack the
[1:03:54] attackers had rush back into their city

[1:04:10] it's not just let the enemy know this is
[1:04:13] a warfare of attack and advancement I

[1:07:46] looking at the wrong thing a yonder is
[1:07:48] covenant are you a believer you say well
[1:07:53] I don't even know if I have the Holy
[1:07:55] Ghost are you a believer do you believe
[1:07:57] it's promise I mean do you believe he
[1:07:59] died for you you're in the right you're
[1:08:01] in the right category Alleluia amen
[1:08:05] because many times we you know the Bible
[1:08:09] speaks in Ephesians of picking up the
[1:08:11] shield of faith before you quench the
[1:08:14] fiery darts the enemy holding the shield
[1:08:16] of faith now it's your faith that
[1:08:18] quenches the darts because he fires he
[1:08:21] fires thoughts into your mind you know
[1:08:24] and then you can't stop the thought
[1:08:26] coming but it's your faith will paralyze
[1:08:29] that that error that does you know where
[1:08:32] it comes you and says you can't receive
[1:08:35] that the promise is not for you you
[1:08:38] don't even know you don't understand
[1:08:39] what this is about
[1:08:41] I'll tell you I don't understand a whole
[1:08:44] bunch in here I know the author really
[1:08:46] well brother Graham said well I may not
[1:08:49] know the barbary well but I know the
[1:08:50] author really well if you know the
[1:08:52] author really well you're in the right
[1:08:54] place anyway so I'm not even sure binome
[1:08:57] all that well as they're pulling your
[1:08:59] heart
[1:09:00] amen because his he is a is a seed that
[1:09:04] he's placing us before the foundation of
[1:09:05] the world and he says all that the
[1:09:08] father has given me already given me
[1:09:11] will come to me
[1:09:13] amen and all that come to me I'll no
[1:09:16] wise cast out and then we find ourselves
[1:09:19] you say yeah we get a burden I trust
[1:09:22] you've been there and if you're still
[1:09:23] there just say thank you you know you
[1:09:26] get a burden I'm not happy with my life
[1:09:29] I want to know what is this all about
[1:09:32] you know it's more than just living in
[1:09:34] food and work and my family what you
[1:09:37] know and I feel a pull and then I come
[1:09:40] to this this this place where the floor
[1:09:43] is uneven and all the things like this I
[1:09:45] love this place hallelujah you know and
[1:09:49] I hear a word you may have heard it
[1:09:51] somewhere else it doesn't matter
[1:09:52] wherever the truth is and there's
[1:09:53] something pulls in my heart what is that
[1:09:56] is it God saying this one of mine I'll
[1:09:59] catch you child come to me
[1:10:03] hallelujah now the enemy looks for weak
[1:10:06] spots in our life just thank him for
[1:10:08] those things you can't buy a burden to
[1:10:11] meet him you can't buy or work out a
[1:10:15] longing to know him it's there and he
[1:10:20] calls you and he calls you and you can
[1:10:23] you can even run or try and hide it you
[1:10:25] can't hide it I just give up then we
[1:10:29] know God does not always the Spirit of
[1:10:31] God does not always strive with man amen
[1:10:35] so the first little inkling of it I'd
[1:10:38] say Lord Jesus Here I am I give up
[1:10:41] amen because I think I think every
[1:10:44] believer has the same feeling when they
[1:10:46] meet him why didn't I why did I not do
[1:10:48] this years ago
[1:10:50] amen and you'll find the same thing why
[1:10:52] did I not just give up years ago I could
[1:10:55] have given him even more of my youth of
[1:10:56] my strength amen
[1:11:00] now he attacks us he looks for weak
[1:11:04] spots and he tries to attack us there
[1:11:06] now Jesus we read about in Matthew three
[1:11:10] and four where Jesus went into the
[1:11:12] wilderness
[1:11:13] and and he fasted for 40 days then it
[1:11:17] says the devil came against them that
[1:11:19] was his only weak spot he tried to tempt
[1:11:23] him there I'll read something this is an
[1:11:26] this is from raising Drossos daughter in
[1:11:29] 1956 he was a god man he was divine he
[1:11:33] was virgin born God Jehovah God
[1:11:37] overshadow a little virgin and brought
[1:11:39] forth the virgin born son of God and
[1:11:42] that was a tabernacle or the dwelling
[1:11:45] place of Jehovah himself Jehovah walked
[1:11:48] in a tabernacle of flesh and paid the
[1:11:51] price for sin don't you never let him be
[1:11:54] a prophet he was the god of the prophets
[1:11:57] sure was he was more than a good man he
[1:12:00] was the god of the good men Elisha even
[1:12:05] now out here on this little old sea
[1:12:07] tossed about there's when he's on the
[1:12:09] boat now tossed about ten thousand
[1:12:12] Devils of the sea swore they drown him
[1:12:15] while he was laying back they're tired
[1:12:17] you know the devil takes advantage of
[1:12:20] you when you get tired of war out amen
[1:12:24] who's ever been tired of worn-out then
[1:12:27] the devil comes he begins a fire is that
[1:12:29] just put up a sign business days are
[1:12:32] closed later he has to obey you you
[1:12:37] understand I'm trying to make a joke he
[1:12:40] has to obey your voice the redeemed he
[1:12:43] is under the redeemed feet that means
[1:12:46] the redeemed are in control that means
[1:12:49] who's redeemed
[1:12:50] we're going to be in a heaven
[1:12:52] interactive service today who's ready if
[1:12:54] you're redeemed therefore he has to obey
[1:12:56] your voice so if you say go away and
[1:12:58] come back later what does he have to do
[1:13:00] I guess I got to go away come back later
[1:13:03] you know but we we we start having a
[1:13:06] conversation I mention someone coming to
[1:13:08] your door at 3:00 in the morning and how
[1:13:10] are you and you know someone you don't
[1:13:12] even know I talk to you for a little bit
[1:13:14] you'd be polite beats a no I've got to
[1:13:17] go to bed come back at another time but
[1:13:19] yet the devil comes in when we're worn
[1:13:22] and tired out you open the door you make
[1:13:24] him a cup of coffee you sit him down
[1:13:26] you know and you don't want to he's like
[1:13:28] the salesman you never want to see but
[1:13:31] you listen to him you put up with them
[1:13:32] oh yeah that's right yeah true true yeah
[1:13:34] yeah remember he's been studying you
[1:13:36] oh you think you're a believer you think
[1:13:38] you can overcome you know are you always
[1:13:40] feel and then you always think these
[1:13:42] things and if you thought you know - you
[1:13:44] know the Bible says to the pure all
[1:13:46] things are pure and you think this way
[1:13:47] and you do this and you sit there yeah
[1:13:49] that's right that's right and what are
[1:13:51] you doing
[1:13:52] why entertain him why entertaining Satan
[1:13:57] show him the door and if you only have a
[1:14:00] cat door push him through there just get
[1:14:04] rid of him tell him no come back later
[1:14:07] I'm too tired to talk to you and I don't
[1:14:10] even want to talk to you anyway shun the
[1:14:12] door amen he caught Jesus wait he just
[1:14:17] get you a little tired and worn out and
[1:14:19] get discouraged hello
[1:14:23] certainly he caught Jesus right there at
[1:14:25] that weak spot tired and weary he was
[1:14:28] lying back in the back of the boat
[1:14:30] rocking around and the Bible said the
[1:14:31] storm came down upon the sea and big
[1:14:34] tossed the boat and the disciple said
[1:14:36] Karis out not that we perish he said Oh
[1:14:39] where's your faith he would have been
[1:14:41] pretty tired they didn't have big boats
[1:14:43] in those days and it was going up and
[1:14:46] down like a bottle stopper on a you know
[1:14:48] on a on a big sea and he's asleep he was
[1:14:51] worn out from the meetings he just had
[1:14:52] and the devil comes and tries and gets
[1:14:55] him there amen
[1:14:58] what was he doing crossing a rough sea
[1:15:00] that night because one solon and
[1:15:02] gatherer was ready to receive him one
[1:15:05] soul he would come from glory to
[1:15:07] Shreveport
[1:15:08] I would say he had come from glory to
[1:15:10] Stokes Valley I mean for one soul that
[1:15:13] was ready to receive him I'm so glad he
[1:15:15] does I remember that this man that was
[1:15:18] read to receive him was a sick man he
[1:15:20] was mentally sick he was a maniac that
[1:15:22] was the maniac in the tombs hallelujah
[1:15:25] he say well I'm not in a very good place
[1:15:27] that man was ready to receive him and
[1:15:30] you're not in that place hallelujah you
[1:15:34] know we we put too much emphasis on
[1:15:36] ourselves
[1:15:37] and we look at ourselves too much look
[1:15:40] at the state of this wall Nehemiah do
[1:15:44] you really think this is going to hold
[1:15:47] up in an invasion
[1:15:48] he could have see it now he could he
[1:15:50] could look at that look at the state of
[1:15:51] you and how victorious you think you are
[1:15:53] we could look at that or he could say
[1:15:55] you see that temple over there you see
[1:15:58] that temple we rebuilt that temple
[1:16:01] that's God's temple God dwells on that
[1:16:03] temple he come on that we'd be back here
[1:16:06] the Prophet Jeremiah said in 70 years we
[1:16:09] would return and we have returned and
[1:16:11] we're building and the Bible says that I
[1:16:14] will restore thus saith the Lord
[1:16:17] hallelujah and with and we're being
[1:16:19] restored I'm living the fulfillment so
[1:16:23] nothing can hinder God's work
[1:16:25] hallelujah so what are you looking at
[1:16:27] hey looking at what you think you are
[1:16:30] he's saying no I'm under a word I'm
[1:16:33] under a word this is gonna be rebuilt
[1:16:36] and I'm being rebuilt thank you go back
[1:16:39] to what you were a year ago
[1:16:41] six months ago however long ago and
[1:16:44] compare yourself from there to today and
[1:16:46] you'd begin to say the battlements have
[1:16:49] been built there's some soldiers there's
[1:16:52] some gates being put up oh yeah there's
[1:16:55] the temples their sacrifices their
[1:16:58] hallelujah he says now that this been
[1:17:06] said so this in Hebrews chapter 4 the
[1:17:09] rooms is that dispensations change when
[1:17:12] Jesus Christ with Jesus Christ from law
[1:17:15] to grace from works unto grace from
[1:17:18] something you do that something God did
[1:17:21] upon your own merits are upon his
[1:17:23] parents changed when Moses came out of
[1:17:26] the wilderness with the law he said thou
[1:17:28] shalt not commit adultery thou shalt not
[1:17:30] steal thou shalt not kill
[1:17:32] keep the Sabbath day holy when Jesus
[1:17:35] came out of the wilderness as is not a
[1:17:37] toy when Moses come the devil tempted
[1:17:39] him and soon as the devil tempted him he
[1:17:42] heeded to it Moses had a weak spot how
[1:17:45] many knows what it was
[1:17:46] temper right and as soon as he had seen
[1:17:50] them worshiping the gold
[1:17:51] and cough he threw down the commandments
[1:17:53] and broke them showing that the priests
[1:17:55] showing that the priesthood would be
[1:17:57] broken and God them to him again but
[1:18:01] when Jesus came out of the wilderness 40
[1:18:04] days of fasting he was hungry
[1:18:06] the only week's body had when there be
[1:18:09] good to have that's the only weak spot
[1:18:11] you have I believe will come to there
[1:18:14] amen because the weak spots you once had
[1:18:17] they're being rebuilt they're not weak
[1:18:19] spots anymore
[1:18:20] hallelujah and the devil came to and
[1:18:23] said if thou be the Son of God turn
[1:18:25] these stones into bread do a miracle
[1:18:27] here let me see you do it and I'll
[1:18:29] believe you jesus said it's written man
[1:18:31] shall not live by bread alone but by
[1:18:33] every word that proceeds out of the
[1:18:34] mouth of God he knowed he didn't heat he
[1:18:37] knowed he didn't meet Moses there for he
[1:18:41] went to the word that Jesus wouldn't he
[1:18:43] used the word to combat the works of the
[1:18:45] enemy took him up to the pinnacle of the
[1:18:48] temple said if thou be the Son of God
[1:18:49] cast thyself down and he coated not
[1:18:52] quoted but coated the scripture said
[1:18:55] it's written off he'd give the angels
[1:18:57] charge concerning lease at any time you
[1:18:59] dash your foot against a stone he'll
[1:19:02] bear thee up so he came against Jesus in
[1:19:05] this weak spot
[1:19:08] now I trust you say well oh I've got
[1:19:13] some weak spots and if you know where
[1:19:15] they are then you can cover them you
[1:19:19] know it's like a boxer when you know
[1:19:22] brother BAM says we'll just study our
[1:19:23] opponent and if you study your opponent
[1:19:26] then at the same time you should be
[1:19:27] studying yourself because your opponent
[1:19:30] is studying you and so if you have a
[1:19:33] weak spot just like a boxer if they need
[1:19:37] to just have the enemy's got a real good
[1:19:38] Chuck
[1:19:39] and they don't know how to combat it
[1:19:41] they'll get a sparring partner that's
[1:19:43] got a real good lift up so they can
[1:19:46] combat what the opponent will do when
[1:19:48] they're in the room so we need to do the
[1:19:50] same thing we need to study him you need
[1:19:53] to study yourself because he may come
[1:19:56] against you or something and then the
[1:19:58] person seeing this you could say how
[1:20:00] could they would be tempted by this and
[1:20:01] that's because
[1:20:04] the person one person has a wall where
[1:20:06] and the other person just has a few few
[1:20:09] stones but they never came to step
[1:20:11] across you study your apartment you
[1:20:17] should study your opponent now when it
[1:20:20] comes to rebuilding it's not just us
[1:20:23] personally being rebuilt
[1:20:24] I said that's why the devil he entices
[1:20:26] yo his marketing scheme is so good
[1:20:30] because he's trying to entice you but
[1:20:33] our God is greater than those things we
[1:20:36] don't have to walk along with blinders
[1:20:38] on or live up in a mountain someplace we
[1:20:40] can walk in this dark world but there's
[1:20:43] nothing in us to wants it amen
[1:20:46] we can look at thanks at all I don't
[1:20:48] want that thing I just want to keep
[1:20:49] walking on hallelujah I'm glad I'm glad
[1:20:53] we can be like that by a spirit we can I
[1:20:56] mean we don't need to fear anything now
[1:20:59] the family unit is being rebuilt as well
[1:21:02] we have come to a place where the
[1:21:05] scripture and we'll read it in in
[1:21:08] Ephesians of different places where Paul
[1:21:11] writes about the family unit and we have
[1:21:14] come to an age where the family unit has
[1:21:16] been restored and we because as parents
[1:21:22] now we are not to make the cycle for
[1:21:26] ourselves and our children we are not
[1:21:29] called to make little so for example I'm
[1:21:32] not called to make little Benjamins in
[1:21:35] my three three girls I am called to make
[1:21:38] disciples of Jesus Christ in them right
[1:21:42] so how I raised them shouldn't be they
[1:21:46] are being molded I am I am being
[1:21:49] reproduced in them you could say how
[1:21:51] they act and what they do but it's God
[1:21:53] should be made in them is that is that
[1:21:57] clear so so through me they are
[1:22:00] following him they're not following me
[1:22:03] only so we need to look into the
[1:22:08] scripture amen see Paul see follow me as
[1:22:12] I follow Christ but Paul did not want to
[1:22:15] make little Paul's when he went around
[1:22:16] preaching
[1:22:17] that would have been his worst nightmare
[1:22:19] he when he went around preaching he
[1:22:21] wanted to see I travail until Jesus
[1:22:23] Christ be formed in you I travail endure
[1:22:25] so he wanted to see Jesus the same God
[1:22:28] he met would would meet these ones that
[1:22:30] he preached to and the same God that
[1:22:32] manifested in his life was now on them
[1:22:34] and that's that's the kind of disciples
[1:22:37] he wanted to make and that should be the
[1:22:39] same thing with our children is that the
[1:22:41] same God we have met that they would
[1:22:44] meet him as well now there's an
[1:22:48] influence in 1963 he says I picked up
[1:22:54] one day when Billy Sunday's Tabernacle
[1:22:57] as I was at one of the first meetings
[1:22:59] there and I liked it so much and I hung
[1:23:02] it I took it and hang it in my house and
[1:23:05] I kept it until it fell apart I'm still
[1:23:08] talking about rebuilding I'm just going
[1:23:10] to more of a family a family way and it
[1:23:14] was saying like this go no place you so
[1:23:19] go no go no place you would not want to
[1:23:22] be if Jesus should come that was the
[1:23:27] same be saying nothing that you would
[1:23:30] not want to be saying if Jesus should
[1:23:32] come and it went on with many things
[1:23:34] saying in other words whatever you do or
[1:23:36] say or whatever action you're performing
[1:23:39] do not do it if you do not want to be
[1:23:42] caught in that position when Jesus come
[1:23:44] if we could only do that I'm sure to be
[1:23:47] a great influence upon our associates
[1:23:49] and you know the right there's two ways
[1:23:52] of to do anything that's right and wrong
[1:23:54] because I had my little son Joseph in my
[1:23:57] lap the other day and I said to me he's
[1:24:00] 8 years old and some little boy had
[1:24:02] stepped on his toes and he and the
[1:24:04] little boy had a fight
[1:24:06] I said Joseph don't do that but daddy he
[1:24:09] did such-and-such I said but that
[1:24:11] doesn't matter see what he did just
[1:24:13] remember Joseph you love your father he
[1:24:16] said Ye steady he said remember that
[1:24:18] people are going to look at your life as
[1:24:20] a minister's son and then if you do
[1:24:22] anything wrong
[1:24:24] then they're going to say does this
[1:24:25] minister permit his child to do such now
[1:24:28] we know they do it anyhow but
[1:24:31] we know that but as Christians we know
[1:24:33] that we are trying to bring up our
[1:24:35] children right but it's a good thing to
[1:24:38] keep that forefront so before them
[1:24:41] before them all the time to do what's
[1:24:43] right
[1:24:43] don't never take that other side and I
[1:24:48] see it because you see it doesn't only
[1:24:49] reflect on you Joseph but it reflects on
[1:24:51] your mother it reflects on your sisters
[1:24:54] it reflects on your sister and the very
[1:24:56] sorry on your father and the very cause
[1:24:59] of the family that we're standing for
[1:25:01] and then what we stand for it flex on
[1:25:04] that on Jesus Christ and you don't want
[1:25:06] to do that I said our Lord told us if
[1:25:09] anybody smite us on one cheek turn the
[1:25:11] other and of course that's kind of hard
[1:25:13] for a little boy with a hot temper to
[1:25:15] begin with to think such things but
[1:25:17] place it before him anywhere anyhow see
[1:25:21] that he should not do it he's triumphant
[1:25:26] influence so we should put influence in
[1:25:27] front of our children amen
[1:25:29] not to take the wrong side but take what
[1:25:32] the what what the Bible says to do amen
[1:25:39] let's read go to Colossians on access go
[1:25:44] to it let's just go to Ephesians chapter
[1:25:45] 6 and we I think we're just going to
[1:25:51] basically hold for the rest the service
[1:25:53] on here
[1:26:03] actually
[1:26:08] now Ephesians six and for our patients
[1:26:14] six and one down to four and then we're
[1:26:21] actually going to go back into Ephesians
[1:26:22] chapter five where you're going to start
[1:26:23] and we're gonna go up because we expect
[1:26:27] our children to be good and to obey and
[1:26:29] to listen and and you know toe the line
[1:26:32] but the influence you place upon them so
[1:26:35] I read that quote because little Joseph
[1:26:38] Branham was born with a nature that is
[1:26:40] dad and he received from his family so
[1:26:43] he received a certain kind of nature so
[1:26:45] there that that is in us whatever nature
[1:26:48] does we can be high-tempered high-strung
[1:26:50] we can be so relaxed that you know
[1:26:52] people think you have no care in the
[1:26:54] world you know whatever spectrum you
[1:26:56] know you're in the spectrum we have we
[1:26:58] are born with a certain nature but we
[1:27:01] have to raise our children such a way
[1:27:03] that they don't lean upon that nature
[1:27:05] necessarily but they lean upon how God
[1:27:08] because member a man has no control of
[1:27:11] his spirit is like a city with no walls
[1:27:14] so now the devil looks at your nature
[1:27:18] and he'll use your nature against you
[1:27:20] and if you have no defensive of the
[1:27:22] Spirit of God and you know God's Word
[1:27:24] then you're in your absolute and how you
[1:27:28] respond to things will be based on your
[1:27:30] nature okay but if God is in you and as
[1:27:35] word as it you know you know it's not
[1:27:37] just in here what I'm trying to say but
[1:27:39] as word is in here and it's a life
[1:27:41] that's what I'm trying to say if it's
[1:27:43] the end of life and when things come
[1:27:45] your way then God can teach you and say
[1:27:47] don't respond that way as you would
[1:27:51] tanley but respond according to my word
[1:27:54] because if you respond according was
[1:27:57] word then you have a wall then you have
[1:27:59] a defense as if I'm with me right
[1:28:04] so effecient six and one children obey
[1:28:06] your parents in the Lord for this is
[1:28:07] right honor thy father and mother which
[1:28:10] is the first commandment with promise
[1:28:12] that it may be well with thee and thou
[1:28:15] mayest live long on the earth so
[1:28:19] children
[1:28:21] whose hello all the children can I have
[1:28:26] your attention now all of the children
[1:28:28] who wants to serve the Lord young child
[1:28:31] yeah gonna be a christian and serve the
[1:28:33] lord yep
[1:28:34] well this is actually how you serve at a
[1:28:37] young age and I didn't hear anything
[1:28:41] from the kids sake but this is actually
[1:28:45] how you serve God at a young age you
[1:28:48] obey your parents in the Lord for this
[1:28:51] is right
[1:28:52] so anything that they tell you to do
[1:28:54] that is in the Lord you obey it and you
[1:28:57] honor them you know what it means to
[1:28:59] honor someone treat them better how even
[1:29:03] how you'd want to be treated have the
[1:29:05] best seat can I get you anything a
[1:29:07] thirst you have you know you know
[1:29:09] someone comes in awe how can I honor you
[1:29:11] how can I treat you with respect how can
[1:29:15] I you know how could I give you
[1:29:16] reverence and really show my
[1:29:18] appreciation and love for you hello
[1:29:22] children are we here it says honor your
[1:29:25] parents honor your father and mother and
[1:29:28] the Lord for this is right and so he's
[1:29:31] giving instruction now if you want to if
[1:29:34] you really want to serve the Lord even
[1:29:36] at a young age on your father and mother
[1:29:39] but this is right this is godly
[1:29:42] instruction it's well they're all rigid
[1:29:47] and they I'll just say this the younger
[1:29:52] generation now here I sell movies over
[1:29:53] at all but the young and you and you
[1:29:57] only realize this when you get older the
[1:29:59] younger generation doesn't really does
[1:30:01] not have experience of what it's like to
[1:30:04] really be in this world when you're
[1:30:07] young you know especially when you hit
[1:30:09] about 18 you think I know it all why
[1:30:12] doesn't the world just ask me how to
[1:30:14] solve the problem I'll fit you know you
[1:30:15] think you're bulletproof and you know
[1:30:17] everything but then you walk a little
[1:30:19] bit in life and you begin to realize man
[1:30:21] I really don't know too much and when
[1:30:25] you're about 18 17 18 you think man mum
[1:30:27] and dad know nothing they're
[1:30:29] old-fashioned they don't understand
[1:30:31] what's going on and then you begin to
[1:30:32] experience life a little but
[1:30:34] and then you realize they actually know
[1:30:36] quite a lot because they've experienced
[1:30:39] a lot of things amen and so but the
[1:30:44] younger generation we always make a
[1:30:46] mistake when you're young because you
[1:30:48] think they don't know what they're
[1:30:49] talking about and that is not honoring
[1:30:52] your father and mother they meant
[1:30:55] because if you really if you and problem
[1:30:59] is hindsight is a great thing to look
[1:31:01] back and say yeah they were right back
[1:31:03] there but you need to actually
[1:31:04] understand there's a reason why Paul is
[1:31:06] saying honor thy father and mother
[1:31:08] because you've got to realize they
[1:31:10] actually know what they're talking about
[1:31:12] they've actually the same devils every
[1:31:16] all of us are fighting an enemy doesn't
[1:31:19] matter what age but the same Devils that
[1:31:22] our parents fought we fight or we will
[1:31:26] fight it just changes its name you take
[1:31:30] one you know you take music for example
[1:31:33] our parents fought maybe a demon of rock
[1:31:35] and roll
[1:31:36] but then the popular genre just changes
[1:31:38] but it's the same spirit and now we
[1:31:40] fight against that the younger
[1:31:42] generation fights against that and so we
[1:31:45] have to we but the thing is now as
[1:31:47] parents we have to be aware of that well
[1:31:51] why are they fighting this well it's
[1:31:54] because you fought it and the devil
[1:31:56] studied you and he knows if it can work
[1:32:00] against the parents that are working
[1:32:01] against the children I mean that's why
[1:32:05] we're going to be that's why we're going
[1:32:06] to be careful but we're going to be
[1:32:08] aware but then children you know I was
[1:32:11] where were we were an arm we're in
[1:32:13] laughs a lots play Lane yesterday had a
[1:32:15] good day
[1:32:16] I did but anyway I was just looking at
[1:32:22] everyone and there's a big room full of
[1:32:25] people I was looking anywhere I thought
[1:32:27] if one is actually alone this world is
[1:32:31] alone if one is you know people are
[1:32:35] there it may be a birthday party they're
[1:32:37] doing things but everyone just looks
[1:32:38] alone the devil is coming and he
[1:32:42] separated us we can be living in this
[1:32:45] world as a lonely place we can be living
[1:32:48] in
[1:32:48] house full of people full of family but
[1:32:51] we can be alone
[1:32:53] because the devil draws our attention
[1:32:56] away and we try and draw strength from
[1:32:59] from something on the internet or
[1:33:01] Facebook or whatever it is and he's just
[1:33:04] and he gets it in our minds they don't
[1:33:07] understand what I'm going through but we
[1:33:11] forget and we listen to that
[1:33:13] yeah they don't because they're old well
[1:33:16] they're young wherever you are in the
[1:33:18] you know but we forget our parents fault
[1:33:20] the same Devils that we fight so they
[1:33:23] actually can relate that's why it's so
[1:33:25] important you got to think like brother
[1:33:27] Brahim said think just say a 14 year old
[1:33:29] whatever I'd you to think those thoughts
[1:33:30] yes I mean so I've got to think five and
[1:33:34] a half year old thoughts
[1:33:36] Allu yeah you know I've got to think
[1:33:39] four year old thoughts and two and a
[1:33:41] half year old thoughts to actually
[1:33:43] understand what they're going through I
[1:33:46] mean you have to because you got to go
[1:33:48] down remember
[1:33:49] God came when we were lost and undone
[1:33:52] what did he do he came down to your
[1:33:54] level wherever that was
[1:33:56] Emirates all all cinesín there's not
[1:33:59] players that may manifest in different
[1:34:00] ways unbelief is unbelief
[1:34:02] so wherever we're in darkness he came
[1:34:04] down to where you were he didn't he
[1:34:08] didn't just stay up there where I could
[1:34:10] not go when I could not go to where he
[1:34:12] was he came to me the same with our
[1:34:16] children we have to go down onto their
[1:34:18] level you got to be able to relate to
[1:34:21] them but they just doing all these
[1:34:23] things day you got to be able to relate
[1:34:24] to them because you got to bridge maybe
[1:34:26] the devil wants to make a gulf between
[1:34:28] the parents and the children he was to
[1:34:31] create a gulf and how does that golf
[1:34:33] normally start well the children say he
[1:34:35] doesn't understand me and the parent
[1:34:37] says I don't understand him and now we
[1:34:40] can't relate to each other and now
[1:34:42] there's a gulf and then then what
[1:34:45] happens well if there's a gulf and I
[1:34:47] can't relate to to this one even though
[1:34:49] I love them or love her parent I'll try
[1:34:53] and find fulfillment in something else
[1:34:55] oh yes they turned us in it and it's
[1:35:01] this
[1:35:02] but spheal different kinds of things
[1:35:04] before but the devil just rebrands and
[1:35:07] changes its product but ultimately he
[1:35:10] just wants to separate and make and
[1:35:13] that's why this world especially this
[1:35:14] this this world of New Zealand such a
[1:35:17] high suicide rate one of the highest
[1:35:20] suicide rates in the world and we have
[1:35:23] everything this is the first world and
[1:35:27] yet people suicide depression massively
[1:35:31] high levels why because people are alone
[1:35:34] they live in families they have
[1:35:36] community but they're alone we're not
[1:35:39] called to be alone
[1:35:40] nothing was made to be alone when God
[1:35:43] looked at ad missus it's not good that
[1:35:45] man should be alone and so but you say
[1:35:48] well I am I'm not alone I have all my
[1:35:51] family around me and thinks but can you
[1:35:53] really relate to them do you ever do you
[1:35:55] ever even just talk to them have a
[1:36:00] relationship do you amen
[1:36:05] yeah there's been studies but these
[1:36:06] other studies that disprove it but I
[1:36:08] believe is true there's a people have
[1:36:11] been done studies and children's welfare
[1:36:13] and and and their success in life and
[1:36:17] different things they have actually
[1:36:19] attributed it to just families having
[1:36:21] meals together because what now now
[1:36:25] there's community now there's actually
[1:36:27] more than community now this
[1:36:28] relationship and a family now there's
[1:36:31] stability because this is my identity
[1:36:33] this is where I belong
[1:36:36] Amen do you know where you belong amen
[1:36:40] and so and it's such a big impact what
[1:36:44] do you mean just having you know I was
[1:36:45] okay so if I'm not plugging putting a
[1:36:47] plug in for life a lots but there's a
[1:36:49] right of buddies cause you sit and you
[1:36:51] go around in a circle I went on that
[1:36:53] thing I don't know how many times
[1:36:55] yesterday but the thing is it was it
[1:36:59] wasn't
[1:37:00] it's like Gabriel we wanted everything
[1:37:02] we were just on Mia for hours literally
[1:37:05] but and she said daddy let's go on this
[1:37:08] one it's gone this one the same just
[1:37:10] different causal time but she wanted
[1:37:13] children are looking for the hair
[1:37:15] experiences with the appearance I mean
[1:37:19] the things I remember growing up it's
[1:37:22] not sitting on a computer playing
[1:37:23] computer games till dawn till dusk and
[1:37:25] then you know those are the things I
[1:37:28] really remember things I remember is
[1:37:29] being outside playing war playing
[1:37:33] cricket you know going to the beach
[1:37:35] spending time with my yeah my dad used
[1:37:38] to take a sailing on the weekends going
[1:37:40] to the living holidays or even just just
[1:37:42] being at home doing doing things but
[1:37:46] that builds because that builds memories
[1:37:48] and that so that builds you know that
[1:37:50] builds relationship you say this is very
[1:37:53] elementary it is but sometimes we forget
[1:37:56] so that would have been if we could get
[1:38:00] Gabriel you know up here and you say
[1:38:02] well how was yesterday
[1:38:03] I'd anyway with me on these cars we had
[1:38:05] a great time and endless and Lilia too
[1:38:07] and I would look at it say well I'm just
[1:38:11] sitting on this car this is not such a
[1:38:12] big deal to me you know but to the image
[1:38:15] it's five has a far greater impact you
[1:38:20] understand so we may look at all this is
[1:38:21] just this and this is you know we just
[1:38:24] going through our day but they think
[1:38:26] this is this is great I'm spending time
[1:38:28] with daddy and mummy and we're having
[1:38:29] this is this is us now we have to come
[1:38:35] down to their level the older generation
[1:38:40] and you can see it even in the Bible we
[1:38:42] have Solomon's son Israel so Solomon's
[1:38:47] son becomes king now there's a prophecy
[1:38:48] that the that to it you know there's
[1:38:51] going to be a split in the in the
[1:38:53] kingdom and the son now he consults the
[1:38:57] the the men that were with his father
[1:39:01] Solomon because the people come to him
[1:39:03] and say don't taxes so much don't give
[1:39:06] us so greater burdens like your father
[1:39:07] did and then so the son is now on the
[1:39:11] throne and I forget his name just now
[1:39:12] forgive me for that he asked the
[1:39:14] advisors that his father had the older
[1:39:17] men and they said listen to the people
[1:39:19] but then he asked his friends as peers
[1:39:21] and they said this is how you show them
[1:39:24] that you're a real man what greater
[1:39:27] taxation on them give them greater
[1:39:28] burden
[1:39:31] and he listened to them he listened to
[1:39:33] his peers and it was a bad mistake
[1:39:36] because he lost most the kingdom yeah I
[1:39:39] mean that's why I said you know but they
[1:39:42] didn't have the experience that the
[1:39:43] older mean here it says an in verse 4
[1:39:48] and ye father's provoke not your
[1:39:50] children to wrath but bring them up in
[1:39:52] the nurture and admonition of the Lord
[1:39:55] so says don't don't provoke them don't
[1:39:58] make them angry this isn't in Colossians
[1:40:01] 3 and 20 and verse 21 maybe we'll jump
[1:40:04] there really quicker I know probably
[1:40:05] timers timers escaping us just now but
[1:40:09] these things you say well don't
[1:40:15] underestimate simple things you say well
[1:40:21] this is not some great big thing it is
[1:40:23] because remember if you're making
[1:40:24] disciples you have to start somewhere
[1:40:28] you gotta start somewhere and then you
[1:40:31] go from there you know what's the good
[1:40:33] of me telling telling my girls and
[1:40:36] because you know they're down on a level
[1:40:38] Jesus loves us this we know for the
[1:40:41] Bible tells us so and he died on the
[1:40:43] cross to take us to heaven these are
[1:40:44] fundamental and they mean probably more
[1:40:46] to me than when I tell them that they
[1:40:48] mean to them he died on the cross to
[1:40:51] take us to heaven he gave us life and in
[1:40:55] our place because we should have died
[1:40:57] but he died in our place to take us to
[1:41:00] heaven and Jesus loves us and his angels
[1:41:02] are with us and we have nothing to fear
[1:41:04] and He loves us so much and look how
[1:41:06] wonderful he is and he's alive those are
[1:41:07] the things we talked about what good
[1:41:09] would it be to to say now this is the
[1:41:12] seven seals but telling telling us
[1:41:15] telling them Jesus loves us and he died
[1:41:18] taking us to heaven that is the seventh
[1:41:19] this part the seventh seal is redemption
[1:41:20] but what is the good of actually saying
[1:41:22] now brother Graham said this and he's a
[1:41:24] big you know here's a timeline and this
[1:41:26] is where everything happened and they're
[1:41:28] like five and a half you know you can't
[1:41:31] and and this is what this means and you
[1:41:33] know we were thought in God's mind and
[1:41:35] you know the seed fare our thought found
[1:41:37] us and you know that's a dandy I want an
[1:41:42] ice cream
[1:41:43] so they wouldn't build to understand you
[1:41:45] gotta start somewhere it's just like
[1:41:48] when you start in school you learn how
[1:41:50] to write you don't start with algebra
[1:41:53] and you know working out the velocity of
[1:41:55] a mass in three-dimensional space if
[1:41:59] anyone's done engineering you know you
[1:42:01] don't you don't you don't start with
[1:42:02] that you start down here and then you
[1:42:04] got there but you have to be careful we
[1:42:09] we rejoice in these things and they're
[1:42:12] glorious
[1:42:12] but you gotta be able to break it down
[1:42:15] because ultimately hey God found us in
[1:42:17] the darkness he lifted us up to where
[1:42:19] where he is and so we have to do the
[1:42:22] same thing you know any of God's got to
[1:42:24] be in us that we can lift our children
[1:42:26] like we can hear a sermon about about
[1:42:28] the token about Rahab and and Esther and
[1:42:31] all those glorious things we rejoice in
[1:42:34] but then we're going to break it down to
[1:42:35] them what did so what happened to do wha
[1:42:41] what what are you talking about this ah
[1:42:44] I like that you know you gotta be able
[1:42:47] to break it down to them can you do that
[1:42:49] they just don't understand what I'm
[1:42:51] saying you've got to make it more
[1:42:53] simpler because we can't assume just
[1:42:56] because they come to church that they
[1:42:58] actually catch what is going on or they
[1:43:01] understand things you know yeah there's
[1:43:05] been people people raised in the message
[1:43:11] 15 16 years old they thought it was
[1:43:14] still an apple in the garden because
[1:43:17] pictures in a children's Bible and the
[1:43:21] parents assume they'll just understand
[1:43:23] soup and seed and all these different
[1:43:24] things just by osmosis just by absorbing
[1:43:28] it but just because they're people sit
[1:43:31] in church and they hear that doesn't
[1:43:33] mean they catch it that's why you've got
[1:43:36] to have fellowship about these things
[1:43:38] you say well that's too that's too much
[1:43:40] for a child maybe it is I don't know but
[1:43:42] you be able to break it down because
[1:43:45] they will but you can't tell the rules
[1:43:46] an apple
[1:43:48] it wasn't an apple
[1:43:50] because why did Jesus have to be virgin
[1:43:52] born why it'd have to be blood you know
[1:43:54] why did why are we in these why do we
[1:43:57] need redemption why are we in these
[1:43:58] hybrid fallen conditions where did this
[1:44:00] all come from you go start somewhere
[1:44:05] now Colossians 3 and 20 and 21 children
[1:44:08] obey your parents in all things for this
[1:44:11] is well pleasing unto the Lord who wants
[1:44:14] to please the Lord as a chapel children
[1:44:18] the hands wrapper well yeah maybe you're
[1:44:21] fine but it's a lot of who is young here
[1:44:24] who who's a child I'm a child too but
[1:44:29] this is well pleasing to the Lord
[1:44:31] yeah actually want to say now this may
[1:44:34] be a double-edged sword then we say
[1:44:35] children you want to please Jesus yeah
[1:44:38] we do we do do you want me to tell you
[1:44:41] how to do it yeah we do
[1:44:43] you gotta obey us and all things but
[1:44:46] it's a it's a commandment it's a
[1:44:49] commandment it is well pleasing unto the
[1:44:51] Lord
[1:44:52] fathers provoke not your children to
[1:44:55] anger at least they be discouraged see
[1:44:57] Paul links are two together children
[1:44:59] obey your parents fathers do not provoke
[1:45:01] your children to anger they men now
[1:45:10] let's go back to Ephesians again
[1:45:17] go back to Ephesians 5
[1:45:30] that's gonna skip now no wait before you
[1:45:33] say that we might even get there but it
[1:45:38] says fathers provoke your children not
[1:45:40] to anger because how children relate to
[1:45:44] God will be based on how you treat them
[1:45:48] subconsciously because God is our Father
[1:45:51] and subconsciously they'll begin to
[1:45:54] think how you daddies are to them
[1:45:56] nothing that's how God is to them so for
[1:46:01] example so we have to ask and not just
[1:46:04] dads but mums as well how our character
[1:46:07] in our nature has to be a divine word
[1:46:11] that we need when they hear about God's
[1:46:14] character in God's nature they should be
[1:46:16] able to say that's like mommy and daddy
[1:46:18] that's like Daddy because we don't want
[1:46:22] to it can be the hardest thing is
[1:46:23] because you're putting an image you're
[1:46:25] putting an image in front of your
[1:46:26] children whether you say it or not
[1:46:28] you're actually saying because God is in
[1:46:30] me this is how God as a person and how
[1:46:34] he is because I'm dead I don't live
[1:46:36] anymore it's no longer either liveth but
[1:46:38] Christ liveth in me so therefore my
[1:46:40] nature and what I say and the things I
[1:46:43] do and how I act and how I treat and
[1:46:45] that's how God would and flesh amen so
[1:46:49] we have to be very all God help us that
[1:46:52] the image we put in front of them this
[1:46:54] is Jesus the image we put in front of
[1:46:56] them because an image like you say well
[1:46:59] I talked to them about the Lord and we
[1:47:02] sing songs and we come to church that is
[1:47:04] them growing up mostly there's just a
[1:47:07] small part of what they think Jesus is
[1:47:09] it's actually how you treat them as and
[1:47:12] printing upon them this is how God is to
[1:47:14] me and so we have to be very careful
[1:47:19] that how we treat them and how we speak
[1:47:24] to them that's how God would in flesh
[1:47:29] and all children say Amen thank you so
[1:47:35] you say well how can that be so if your
[1:47:40] father is distant and people will begin
[1:47:42] to think that God is distant
[1:47:44] you know if well father never took
[1:47:47] interest in me my dad never took
[1:47:49] interest in me then people begin to
[1:47:50] think God doesn't really care about me
[1:47:52] he doesn't care about the details of my
[1:47:54] life now is that true that's not true
[1:47:56] God has interested in every part of us
[1:47:59] you know sometimes we may pray and think
[1:48:02] well this is such a simple little prick
[1:48:03] but he wants you to tell him about it
[1:48:06] hallelujah he wants you to tell him how
[1:48:09] your day is been you think well he he
[1:48:14] already knows about it but he wants me
[1:48:16] because he wants to build he wants to
[1:48:18] build a relationship with you and how is
[1:48:21] the best way to build a relationship
[1:48:22] when the child or in case us with God we
[1:48:25] open ourselves up and begin a talk from
[1:48:27] our hearts to him amen
[1:48:31] now if the father is always angry we
[1:48:33] think God's always angry if we can never
[1:48:37] please father then we can think we can
[1:48:38] never please God and people always think
[1:48:41] they could never obtain the promise they
[1:48:43] can never measure up they can never you
[1:48:45] know become what they call to be in him
[1:48:47] because fathers always angry always
[1:48:49] raises the benchmark all this is wrong
[1:48:51] this is wrong as wrong as wrong and it
[1:48:53] builds a complex Amen so the father's
[1:48:58] character nature should be God's nature
[1:49:00] she's in 2nd Peter 1 and 4 it says
[1:49:04] whereby are given unto us exceeding
[1:49:07] great and precious promises that by
[1:49:10] these we might be takers of the divine
[1:49:13] nature having escaped the corruption
[1:49:16] that is in the world through lust this
[1:49:18] is we are to be partakers of his divine
[1:49:20] nature amen to be a Christian is to be
[1:49:26] christ-like and the only way he can be
[1:49:28] christ-like of us Jesus Christ is in you
[1:49:32] so we have to have his divine nature
[1:49:35] proverbs 22 and 6 says train up a child
[1:49:39] in the way he should go and when he is
[1:49:41] old he will not depart for
[1:49:43] as I said it's like natural training
[1:49:45] when it comes to anything you don't
[1:49:47] start off with the algebra and the and
[1:49:49] you know and those things matrices and
[1:49:52] as I see the object moving through the
[1:49:54] three-dimensional space and the effects
[1:49:56] that the everything has on it you start
[1:49:57] with one plus one is two so to train up
[1:50:00] a child you could have start at the
[1:50:01] simple things and then as they grow you
[1:50:04] grow with them in terms of their
[1:50:06] training now don't ever think that if
[1:50:12] you're in God's service your children
[1:50:14] will automatically turn out fine don't
[1:50:17] you ever think that for a second you say
[1:50:20] well we're in the New Testament now
[1:50:22] we're under the blood of Jesus Christ
[1:50:23] I'm doing I'm doing the Lord's perfect
[1:50:26] well therefore my children are just
[1:50:28] going to push a button that's like God
[1:50:29] will push a button and then they'll be
[1:50:31] there don't ever assume that because
[1:50:35] that is not God has given us children
[1:50:37] and we're to be stewards over them to
[1:50:40] look after them to raise them to nurture
[1:50:42] them in the faith now this is an Old
[1:50:45] Testament example but it's the same
[1:50:49] today because man does not change let's
[1:50:53] go to 1st Samuel - and we may finish on
[1:51:01] this point then I thought time has got
[1:51:05] away on us First Samuel - and in verse
[1:51:09] 12 they were reading here it says so
[1:51:17] Samuel - and 12 it says now the sons of
[1:51:21] Eli were sons of Belial they knew not
[1:51:26] the Lord now Eli was the high priest in
[1:51:30] those days if you're running who Eli was
[1:51:33] so he was the high priest and he was he
[1:51:37] was in a god-ordained position but his
[1:51:40] children his sons did not know the Lord
[1:51:43] so he did not raise him in a way that
[1:51:47] they could actually walk step into his
[1:51:49] footsteps should the Lord take him off
[1:51:50] the scene because ideally isn't that
[1:51:52] what we want if the world if time goes
[1:51:56] on
[1:51:56] and say the rapture is I've know 50
[1:52:00] years away I don't believe it is but
[1:52:02] just say you know timers going on and
[1:52:04] all these children here are now adults
[1:52:07] and they have have taken our place and
[1:52:09] we're in the grave someplace what would
[1:52:11] we want for them that the same God that
[1:52:14] we know they know so the same God that
[1:52:17] lives in this generation will live in a
[1:52:18] future generation that's what we want
[1:52:21] but but his children did not know the
[1:52:24] Lord he failed as a dead even though he
[1:52:27] is high priest no well what why is this
[1:52:33] it's because when he corrected his sons
[1:52:38] he didn't actually enter emblem in their
[1:52:41] correction now let's go down to this guy
[1:52:48] so we're at First Samuel 2 and we'll go
[1:52:51] down to verse 22
[1:52:53] so first amulet to him ago verse 22 and
[1:52:58] we'll read down to verse 25 now when God
[1:53:05] Crixus he doesn't just he sends warning
[1:53:08] and then judgment there's been god
[1:53:12] creaks so there should be the same thing
[1:53:14] with us we can't just send warning and
[1:53:16] warning and warning and warning because
[1:53:20] and now I'm very much preaching to me
[1:53:22] right now but our voice should not be
[1:53:26] just idle noises and the ears of our
[1:53:29] children it can't just because that's
[1:53:32] they'll think God is that way Oh God
[1:53:34] doesn't know it just like you know when
[1:53:37] we say hey stop doing that or do this
[1:53:39] we'll come here you know we're not
[1:53:41] making them robots for they should pay
[1:53:42] attention daddy's speaking mummy
[1:53:45] speaking and it's like when God speaks
[1:53:49] Oh God speaking I need to listen to this
[1:53:51] this is important yeah
[1:53:54] now when sorry to you thank you now Eli
[1:53:58] was very old and he heard all that his
[1:54:01] sons didn't and all Israel how they lay
[1:54:04] with the woman that assembled at the
[1:54:05] door of the tabernacle of the
[1:54:06] congregation and he said unto them why
[1:54:09] do you say
[1:54:10] things for I hear of your evil dealings
[1:54:13] with by all those people that name my
[1:54:16] sons it is not good it is it is sorry
[1:54:19] for it is no good report that I hear you
[1:54:23] make the Lord's people to transgress if
[1:54:25] one man sin against another the judge
[1:54:28] shall judge them but if a man sin
[1:54:30] against the Lord who shall entreat for
[1:54:32] him
[1:54:33] no was standing they hearkened not under
[1:54:35] the voice of this father because the
[1:54:37] Lord would slay them now he just said
[1:54:40] you shouldn't do this
[1:54:41] why didn't he really deal with them it's
[1:54:47] because he didn't raise them in the
[1:54:48] right way just you know just this is
[1:54:52] real elementary but think about it their
[1:54:55] their relationship had degraded to such
[1:54:57] a point now this is just me that has his
[1:55:00] sons his sons are not one fair God and
[1:55:03] to really obey what their father was
[1:55:06] saying even though he is the high priest
[1:55:10] they their fear of God was lost and they
[1:55:14] was sitting right before the tabernacle
[1:55:16] there and in our human mind we think how
[1:55:20] could they sin around the church like
[1:55:21] that so close and being a priests office
[1:55:23] wouldn't they fear God dealing with them
[1:55:25] well you'd think so but their fear of
[1:55:29] God was not there and they didn't listen
[1:55:31] to their death because he didn't deal
[1:55:34] with him now well when did this start
[1:55:37] with no grown up nose went up yeah now
[1:55:42] let's go down to verse 34 because now
[1:55:47] it's going to add speaking of Samuel
[1:55:49] because we know he owes Eli and then
[1:55:51] Samuel became the high priest but the
[1:55:55] prophets Oh Samuel well I may have that
[1:55:58] wrong but first samuel turn in 34 it
[1:56:02] says and this shall be a sign unto thee
[1:56:04] so this is actually a proper comes and
[1:56:06] speaks against Eli and this shall be a
[1:56:09] sign unto thee that thou shall come upon
[1:56:12] that shall come upon my two sons on hoth
[1:56:16] my and and phineas and one day they
[1:56:19] shall die both of them and I'll raise me
[1:56:23] up
[1:56:24] faithful priests that shall do according
[1:56:26] to that which is in my heart and in my
[1:56:28] mind and I'll build a mature house and
[1:56:31] he shall walk before mine anointed for
[1:56:35] ever now this is this is Samuel I will
[1:56:40] raise me a faithful priest and he'll do
[1:56:43] all that which is my heart of our mind
[1:56:44] he'll do it now Samuel did that but now
[1:56:50] if we drop down to 1st Samuel 8 in 1
[1:56:58] samuel was a faithful priest amen he
[1:57:02] wasn't like Eli he was a faithful priest
[1:57:06] but he didn't raise his children right
[1:57:13] 1st samuel 8 and 1 and it came to pass
[1:57:16] when Sammy was old that him his sons
[1:57:19] judges over Israel now the name of his
[1:57:23] firstborn was Joel and they moved sick
[1:57:25] and was was ever I can't pronounce that
[1:57:27] they were judges in Beersheba and his
[1:57:30] sons walked not in his ways but turned
[1:57:33] aside after Luca and took bribes and
[1:57:36] perverted judgment well what's happened
[1:57:41] the same failings of Eli in a regard now
[1:57:46] came in to Samuel but Samuel and himself
[1:57:48] was a faithful priest he was he did
[1:57:51] everything God put in his mind and hard
[1:57:53] to do well how would how would this now
[1:57:57] humanly this is me because Samuel saw
[1:58:00] the sins of Eli sons and Eli and their
[1:58:02] failings so he would have thought in his
[1:58:04] mind I'm just gonna serve God with all
[1:58:05] my heart I'm gonna do everything 110%
[1:58:08] and I believe he did but he neglected
[1:58:12] that which was closest to him and they
[1:58:16] did not walk in his steps the way they
[1:58:18] should have okay
[1:58:21] I'm saying all these things because just
[1:58:23] because whoa we're the Bride of Christ
[1:58:25] amen we're going in a rapture amen we
[1:58:30] are living the perfect will of God for
[1:58:32] our lives walking according to his word
[1:58:34] amen
[1:58:35] we are spotless
[1:58:37] deemed in the blood wash pure and white
[1:58:39] Amy but don't neglect don't just say
[1:58:46] well God will take care of them I'm busy
[1:58:48] I've got things to do this world is a
[1:58:52] busy place it's been made very busy
[1:58:55] sometimes I pray lord I wish I'd lived
[1:58:58] in the day where I wasn't connected 24/7
[1:59:00] to everything at once would have been so
[1:59:03] nice I'll send you a letter wait a few
[1:59:06] miles for it to come across the sea you
[1:59:08] know
[1:59:09] snail mail see no mail today oh no
[1:59:12] there's no mail today you know but we
[1:59:16] live in a connected age there's a
[1:59:18] pressure in this age but let's not
[1:59:22] neglect those things which actually most
[1:59:23] dear to us amen because in order for the
[1:59:30] family to be united to be restored there
[1:59:34] has to be a relationship amen and there
[1:59:37] has to be one goal
[1:59:39] I trust you parents have a goal I want
[1:59:42] them there with me amen
[1:59:45] that's really the five people well that
[1:59:48] includes me the most see in all the
[1:59:51] world sure this might you know my
[1:59:52] parents bikes you know that family you
[1:59:55] know my my natural family that way but
[1:59:58] if there were five people that would go
[2:00:00] in a rapture
[2:00:01] I'd want me my wife and my three girls
[2:00:06] that would be my heart that be my
[2:00:08] greatest heart's desire
[2:00:09] I believe it'd be far more than that but
[2:00:11] you know what I mean wouldn't you be the
[2:00:13] most wouldn't that make you the most
[2:00:14] happy sure you'd be happy to see
[2:00:16] everyone else maybe where's my children
[2:00:18] where's my wife oh they're here
[2:00:20] hallelujah there'd be the most joy
[2:00:23] wouldn't it that's why we need to focus
[2:00:27] if we need to rearrange our lives you
[2:00:30] say well I got a busy schedule I got
[2:00:31] busy you really just prioritize and get
[2:00:38] rid of stuff that's not important just
[2:00:41] just get rid of it amen we have some
[2:00:46] musicians to come
[2:00:50] say well this is a bit different it's
[2:00:55] always different but I want you to think
[2:00:57] about these things because we can't
[2:01:01] neglect those things that are most near
[2:01:03] India because it's just like brother
[2:01:04] Steve person see that and you know the
[2:01:06] camp we had last October the youth camp
[2:01:09] he said their heart will be attracted
[2:01:11] somewhere else their affections will be
[2:01:14] somewhere else you know when up when our
[2:01:16] children look at us they should really
[2:01:18] out the heroes should be us when they're
[2:01:23] young you know they should be when our
[2:01:26] grub on will be just like mommy or just
[2:01:28] like Daddy they're my heroes amen that's
[2:01:31] how they should be and if that is the
[2:01:38] case that means their heart hasn't
[2:01:40] wandered out somewhere it was it's more
[2:01:43] obvious when they're young when they're
[2:01:44] all those not so obvious because they
[2:01:45] you know growing everything but amen
[2:01:49] let's stand shall we build up the breach
[2:02:00] justice has been helpful yeah it's um do
[2:02:06] you have a song brother Isaac I'm sorry
[2:02:08] I'm blank I'd love to I'm saying we're
[2:02:12] looking for a city here among the
[2:02:15] shadows here and dissapointment often we
[2:02:18] so sadly roam we do but don't be
[2:02:23] discouraged by disappointment you say
[2:02:26] well I thought this would work out this
[2:02:27] way you can look in the Bible there's a
[2:02:30] lot of disappointment of the believer
[2:02:32] but yet they walked on anyway here in
[2:02:38] the shadows
[2:02:41] [Music]
[2:02:49] Oh
[2:03:38] Aaron
[2:03:57] Oh
[2:04:13] [Applause]
[2:04:55] Oh
[2:05:36] [Music]
[2:06:08] Oh
[2:06:16] amen remember as parents we're equipped
[2:06:19] just like a prophet or ministers
[2:06:22] anointing to do his job
[2:06:23] moms and dads you anointed to do a job
[2:06:25] TV hallelujah amen this is can we sing
[2:06:30] when the saints go marching in
[2:06:31] [Music]
[2:07:35] Oh
[2:07:57] because my life
[2:08:12] Oh
[2:08:30] we
[2:08:40] Oh
[2:08:49] Oh
[2:09:23] [Applause]
[2:09:35] [Applause]
[2:10:03] we're the same
[2:10:20] and all when we sound
[2:11:08] father I pray more than these words
[2:11:12] today father may we not be discouraged
[2:11:15] the Lord may be encouraged Oh God that
[2:11:18] are being rebuilt father help us to
[2:11:20] fortify and my lord build up the breach
[2:11:23] in though God in our lives
[2:11:25] father the enemy can't come and the
[2:11:27] winning will and go out when he will but
[2:11:29] father when he come together so you'll
[2:11:31] see a solid father of milk fortress on
[2:11:34] God that he can't he can't penetrate he
[2:11:36] can't get through just maybe grab that
[2:11:39] thought I just asked father as parents
[2:11:43] just help us I pray may we not be caught
[2:11:47] up in the busyness of life may we always
[2:11:50] just have it on our hearts that we want
[2:11:53] to just have a greater relationship but
[2:11:56] with each other but Lord also with our
[2:11:58] children just may you grant and help us
[2:12:01] to keep the family unit close Lord just
[2:12:04] cemented together by your divine love
[2:12:06] and father as we as we raise our
[2:12:10] children
[2:12:10] help us Lord that we do not make
[2:12:12] disciples of ourselves we do not
[2:12:14] reproduce ourselves of the people and
[2:12:16] our children but Lord that you are
[2:12:18] formed of them Lord and when they look
[2:12:20] at us they see you father not a not a
[2:12:24] few
[2:12:25] you but exactly your nature your
[2:12:28] temperament Lord everything you are Lord
[2:12:30] when they look in our eyes they see you
[2:12:32] oh god please make it greater by your
[2:12:35] grace father we are unable to do this
[2:12:37] job in our own strength
[2:12:38] Oh Lord we thank you Lord the weakness
[2:12:40] we just raise our hands and say Lord
[2:12:43] take those bodies of clay take a slaught
[2:12:46] may we step out to one side and may you
