witch when a man hath found he hideth and for Joy there on Golf and South all that he hath that he and byeth that field again the Kingdom of Heaven is like unto a merchant man seeking goodly pearls

Jesus Christ's name we commit Our Lives into your hands any other needs Among Us Lord I pray you'd meet them for your glory in Jesus Christ's name amen amen God bless you friends you can have your seats this morning um so I want to talk about pearls and treasure in the field amen praise the Lord I was watching uh we're watching The Chosen or something and I think uh Jesus is saying you know the Kingdom of Heaven is like a pearl and you know that got me going and so you know um you know we know the Parables they have a far deeper meeting than just a you know there's a you know there's a meaning in them and we know a Merchants so I want to kind of I know it speaks about the treasure in the field and in the goodly pearl but I want to do the vice versa today but they do tie together I believe so uh yo so we know a merchant he you know you know he trades Goods to make a profit that's what a merchant man does he's like a businessman right he's in trading stuff to to to earn a profit and things and you know people are you know people Through the Ages have been seeking and trading Pearls of Wisdom they've been looking for little pieces or nuggets of um sound advice and words to live by and uh and it is very true today that people are are taking different parts of philosophies and religions and try and live by them you know there's a big universalism of just blending all the religions all the good parts of every religion together and living by those by those uh philosophy fees and that's that's like seeking goodly pearls people are just trying to find good advice to live by in this world that's falling apart but it's when the pearl of great price when when a person really finds that great pearl of great price which is the Lord Jesus Christ his word I mean then and it's when they see the great value of him they gladly forsake all sell all to have him because if you think about just a merchantment you're trading and you're selling pearls and different things it's the value that they place in the pearl is if they'll keep it or if they'll sell it if they if they value something of a low value they'll gladly trade it for something of a higher value you know there's um I think in America there's been someone who's traded from a paper clip to a house people have done that kind of thing they've traded up and up and up till they finally get a house but you know that person doing that kind of thing would never trade something for what they have if they didn't think what they were going to get was greater value than what they had and so it takes a it takes a real Revelation to to see when you finally come across a pool of great price more than a philosophy more than just a religion more than just a good code of ethics or a way of life but when you meet the resurrection and the life I mean when you really esteem him the greatest value that they can be ever had in the you know you know in your own all of creation then you'll gladly sell all that you have to have him you know there was a brother Brown would tell a story of a boy who'd go up into his attic he wanted an ice cream he had no money and he and he was searching around the house to try and find something to trade for an ice cream and he went up to the attic and he and he and he found a stamp you know it didn't look like much to him little old stampany and he took that and he took it to the Dairy Corner Dairy and he you know and he asked the person you know running the dairy you know can I have an ice cream and then so they so of course you know the dariona says well what are you gonna pay with and he said well I've got this stamped you know can I can I can I have a can I have an ice cream for this stamp and now they now the now the owner of the dairy looked at that stamp and he placed a greater value on on the stamp than the boy did because the boy just thought the valley of that stamp is ice cream but then this man thought well this is worth well more than ice cream and he gave him a dollar for the stamp and you know the boy thought he'd just get 25 cents and then that and then that Dariana was very pleased with himself because he got this thing of Great Value he thought and he sold it for for um 500 to a stamp collector then that stamp collector sold it to another one for thousands of dollars and the value just kept going up and up and up of that stamp and the thing is that that stamp because it was such a rare stamp had a great value but none of them realized it but it was only the ones who were trained to look at the stamp realized it was of Great Value their boy had no idea it was worth probably thousands tens of thousands of dollars he thought it was just worth an ice cream you know so we'd never want to just you know put a very low value on this word we have on this message of the hour we don't ever want to just say it's well it's worth an ice cream you know this is worth more than an ice cream I mean this is eternal life it's like you know this Bible I can't remember how much it was bought for but the ink but the words in this book have eternal life in them you know it's more than just the value of the of the printed material but it's what's within it amen it's Priceless amen if you really have a revelation that the words of eternal life are in this word you won't trade it for nothing amen yeah but the thing is we'd ask the question why on Earth would a would a would a boy sell a stamp which is worth tens of thousands of dollars for an ice cream it wasn't his fault he didn't you know he wasn't a state you know he's just a boy he wanted ice cream as boys do and a lot of grown-up Boys still like ice cream but you see you know he had to he he didn't know the value of it and the reason he didn't know the value of it is because he wasn't taught the value and you know if if the parents really had a realization what was in their house they wouldn't have left it in the Attic they would have put it probably in a frame on the mantelpiece it would have been there probably their prized possession of a very rest amp and if it was placed in that position then then no doubt the boy you know he would have got to a certain age and you know because kids come to a point they first probably say no or please but then they say why you know they ask why why why why there's no ending to the why and because it's not an answer why you know and they said the boy would have looked at that stamp and said why is that there and they could have begun to tell him that stamp's Priceless it's the most valuable thing we have in this home is that stamp and then so he would never have taken it and traded it for an ice cream he would have left it there and said man we're really rich in that stamp there's a lot of value and it's the same thing with the word of God what value do we place on the message amen do we just put it in the Attic of our life and say well it's not really worth that much or is it on the mental piece of our heart say man where's the most valuable thing we have the word of God for this day that will transform our bodies take us up into heaven that's a very valuable thing we have in our possession amen we should never diminish the value of it amen but you've got to have the Revelation I pray you do that this that we have the pearl of great price we have the Lord Jesus Christ himself amen we have more than a philosophy more than just a movement or an idea or a religion but we have the very God of creation amen who knows our end in our beginning and where we're from and you know where we're going and who we are and you know he he made us and he's redeemed us on Calvary so we should Place him at the very highest value not something to argue about nothing you know yo this word is nothing to fuss over it's nothing to debate it's not you know that's not what it's about amen if you look at it just to that you haven't seen it as a pearl of great price you just got an idea to trade back and forth we want to take him as the pearl of great price now we understand that a pearl is an entrance it's a Gateway as as um John when he saw the you know New Jerusalem up you know up in glory he would see that the gates of that great city were Pearl it was a you know Pearl Pearl was the gates now we know that the that the you know every part of that city is is symbolic as the Book of Revelation is a book of symbols and so but a pearl you know you know there's a reason the gates are Gates of pearl because a a a pearl is an entrance into the city now we know a pearl is created when an irritant gets into an oyster or or a mollusk any kind of shellfish you know you can either either naturally and irritant or get in there or a human intervention will cause it to go in there then the oyster or the mollusk starts secreting a fluid in order to coat that irritant and it becomes the Pearl so as an irritation comes into the sea creature and that around it forms a pearl so it's an irritation causes this thing of Great Value to be formed now we need to look at our trials very differently amen our trials are not to break us our trials are not to destroy us our trials and our Temptations are actually not meant to ruin us but they're actually to create an entrance into the blessings of God and to the reality of Jesus Christ we know that there's no temptation it says in First Corinthians uh 10 and 13 there hath no temptation taking you such as common to man so basically whatever you're facing everyone else faces you know we're not special cases you know we sorry you know people do understand what you're going through because a lot of people have gone through it before you ever stepped into it amen but the thing is there's a difference between a Believer and an unbeliever an unbeliever sadly has no hope they have no way out they have a they don't have a higher strength hey man that could actually draw them out of a trial can actually give them strength in the trial they can they think it's just their human ability and how they can work out a way some shady deal or something to try and you know get out of a situation but a Believer has a way of Escape amen because he says now for there's no no temptation taking you as such as common to man but God is faithful he'll not suffer you to be tempted above that year Abel but with but will with the Temptation also give you a way of Escape that ye may be able to Bear it I mean so there is a way of escape the Lord gives amen that we can they were able to Bear any trial or temptation but we've got to look for that amen we can't just sit there with our blinkers on and say poor me while it's me and I'm going through this no God has allowed that to come into your life because he wants to make it an entrance into his power amen into His blessings into the reality of God that's why he's put trials in Temptation into your life praise the Lord Hallelujah why because it's a pearl it may be an irritant it may bug you and fix you amen but God is creating an entrance amen into his realities I'm so thankful God does that he's not a god of frustration or confusion amen but everything happens in life is for a purpose but we're going to look for that purpose amen we can't just look there with blinkers and be poor me and I've got trouble and what was me and pity party time take down the banner of the pity party no I mean this is a celebration of an entrance amen into the Eternal God hallelujah amen because so so we must think about these things it's time to rejoice in our trials because God is using them to create an entrance Into His blessings and power amen it's working for your good praise the Lord second Corinthians 4 and 17 for our light Affliction which is but for a moment worketh for us a farmer exceeding an eternal weight of Glory Hallelujah the Apostle Paul knew what it was like to have afflictions he was Shipwrecked he was beaten he was stoned he was thrown into prison more than once he was chased from City to City he had trouble with from without the church and within the church he had all kinds of things but he says it's just a light Affliction and it's working for a moment there's an expiry date on this trouble amen it's going to come to an end Hallelujah and it's working for me a far more exceeding Eternal weight of Glory Hallelujah if we could look at our trials as those things they're working for my benefit this is not for my destruction this is for amen my resurrection for my glory amen for my shaping amen that God would make me into His Image more and more holy how's your gate how's your entrance praise God Amen he says while we look not at the things which are seen But at the things which had not seen for the things which you've seen are temporal but the things which are not seen are Eternal amen so I pray we can look at look at these irritants in our life amen as an entrance a Gate's being formed Hallelujah praise God amen the real brother Brahm says the real gospel glows with power Eagles hear that I mean they don't look for a shine they look for a glow glowing with humility glowing with love glowing with power I mean that's what the real Eagle hunts they can't scratch in a barnyard and please him you'll never be able to do it they'll never you'll never tell it to him because he won't believe it but let that voice scream from Heaven I was he that was dead and alive again something takes place I am the same yesterday today and forever and it shall come to pass in the last days I'll pour out of myself upon All Flesh glory to God it'll Quicken your mortal language it'll quickly your mortal tongues um it'll give you the Eve I'll give you the evidence that I'm going to bring you in the resurrection with me hungry hearted Eagles reach that just as hard as they can it's the pearl of great price that they sell everything else to go by amen see a real a real Eagle a real child of God will look for the resurrection amen as that pearl of great price the resurrection and the life I mean we're not looking for a you know just a just a way of life we're not looking just for having nice Church community we're not looking for you know to have nice families only and those all those things are fine but the pearl of great price is the resurrection Hallelujah and that's what we look for are you looking for that amen if the Lord has revealed to you that in this word is the resurrection amen there's power in this word to transform you to take you from this world to the next amen it's like Jesus would tell of the story The you know that you know there's a certain rich man there's a bigger Lazarus the rich man you're both died the rich man went to hell the you know your your uh Lazarus the poor man went to Abraham's bosom and then so the rich man was being tormented in the flames and he saw afar off he saw he's he saw Lazarus the poor man in Abraham's bosom and he cries out to him you know cries out to Abraham Sin Sin Lazarus with a bit of water on the tip of his finger they can put on my tongue that I'll be you know you know you know I'll be um relieved or whatever because I'm being tormented in this flame and Abraham said there's a great Gulf between me and you you know he can't come to you you can't come to him and then he says Doug can can you please send send someone that can tell my family I've got family who are not dead and they're going to come to this place so they live the same kind of life as I lived I don't want them to come to this place and then and then Abraham says no they have the law and the prophets they won't believe you and if one is raised from the dead and what Jesus is saying is actually there's power in the word that they have already amen that if they believe it in faith they won't go to where that to destruction they'll go into life eternal that means if we could really put the value on the word that it does have eternal life in it amen it's more than just red and black ink on paper but there's really just like the message it's more the Kentucky and speaking more than healing lines and discernment and prophecy but it's God being made real Amos Jesus Christ revealed in that word amen Hallelujah now an entrance uh uh gives power amen so a door you know you know a doorway is always an entrance to something and as as um John would would be told to write in the Book of Revelation in your Revelation 3 and uh it's a it's a uh and to the angels of the church in in Philadelphia right these things saith he that is Holy he that is true he that hath the Key of David he that openeth and no man shutteth and Shadow of the no man open Earth I Know Thy Works behold I have set before then open door and no one can shut it for thou has a little strength and has kept my word and has not denied my name now we know that the Philadelphian age was the previous age but but but it laps over into this age and all the blessings of of all the Ages come down into the last stage and also all the cursings and the warnings come down to the last day just well and so this open door we know if you look at history there was a great missionary time in the Philadelphia Church age but it's a but but it's not just that because we know scripture has compound meaning but a door was going to be you know you know I've set before then open door so there's an entrance that's going to be opened up to the church and so brother Brown says now then we can see Jesus as the door he is the daughter of the sheep and notice that it speaks now um of the door opening what is that but a revelation of him and that Revelation is going is opening up to bring us strength to illuminate the word and to glorify his name it was in the midst of the last two ages of the revelation of the deity of Jesus Christ blossomed out before us yes we knew he was God how else could he be um how else could he be our savior but to know that he was the only God or God Alone he was the Alpha and Omega that was that Jesus was both Lord and Christ make him the Lord Jesus Christ the Father the Son the Holy Ghost all one person that had been long lost since the first church ages but now we're seeing it again the revelation of who he was has come back and he got hit it's not a three-person god with one personality for it takes a personality to make a person but there is one personality there is but one person they who who believe in three persons have a three God godhead and are guilty of breaking the first commandment but the revelation of the godhead is back and now the true church can be built in strength again after all this time she finally knows who her Lord is once again we are baptizing in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ just as they did at Pentecost so so there's been a restoration of behold You Know Thy Lord as one God amen that yo yo because what's happened through history is they've taken a manifestation of God and make it a separate God Amen but we know that God is not one like your finger is one like brother Bram said because there's got your finger and there's one manifestation but God has different manifestations either Pillar of Fire He's A Cloud by day he appears as an angel how many of you know you know you know you know he came in a bodily form to Abraham there in Genesis 18 you know he came in different forms and he came in flesh Amen to redeem us Born Into the human race is our Kinsmen redeemer is the Lord Jesus Christ to redeem us back to himself and then he went back as being the pillar of fire again he is the Holy Ghost he's all these different forms amen but you see now this door is opening why is to that the church can be built in strength again that means it's very important we realize that we're being built in strength we're not being built in weakness and an unbelief but in faith and power of the Holy Ghost Amen to this this is what Revelation has come to do he's going to give us strength to illuminate the word and to glorify his name now we need a strength like we've never needed in this day amen because this is the darkest age he's ever been upon the earth I mean but it would as I would say in Deuteronomy 33 25 the second part of the verse it's a as thy day so shall thy strength be amen so so as the days are so shall your strength be so the darker the world is amen the more strength we have amen the lighter that you know so because remember guide away sins the power of His Holy Spirit to combat what the enemy has done and we know that the power of the Holy Ghost is always greater than what the enemy can do Hallelujah so we're not standing here useless or I mean faithless or unable or you know pushed back in a corner and we're just going to survive no we're not just going to survive we're going to overcome amen God is going to have a people upon the Earth he's going to show the power of his blood amen and a people and he's going to make a bunch of Overcomers and they're going to overcome this age and we are those Overcomers I mean we're part of their body right amen so because it's not our own strength that we would ever ever have our own mental ability amen that we could overcome it takes a supernatural strength to come into our lives by the baptism of the Holy Ghost and that's how we can overcome amen when we we've got to master the thought of our own human ability when we realize we cannot do it but he must do it then it can be done but when we think we can do it it'll never be done we'll always be here buddy I hit against a brick wall getting nowhere but we realize we can't do it Lord you must come and do it then he can do it Hallelujah amen so we don't need physical strength we need spiritual strength we need Faith muscles I mean that's why this door of Revelation has opened up now we know any Revelation is just a revealing of what's already here amen that's that scriptural Revelation is an opening of the word amen where it's been sitting there for thousands of years but God comes and makes it live praise the Lord so you know so so this is what this door of Revelation this opening I mean causes us that he's going to give us strength and I believe even if you say you're weak let the weak say they are strong have a good confession about yourself I'm more than an overcomer I mean I can do all things through Christ which strengthens me amen he's redeeming by his blood I am his workmanship I made it his image amen I've been washed in his blood I'm without spot or wrinkle or any such thing because of what he has done for me amen don't confess what you think about yourself confess what he has done for you that's all that will stand is our confession what he has done for you because when you confess what he has done for you then the power of that confession comes into your life and it manifests Hallelujah oh really is that true well Joshua and Caleb said let's go take the land he's given it to us they took the land amen the others confess we can't take it they didn't take it have a positive confession Hallelujah so as our days are so shall thy strength be amen so we're strong people the Lord is our strength the joy of the Lord is our strength that's why we should never be unhappy in the Lord we should be happy doesn't matter what's going on in life that's that's nothing to do with it you say well actually no it has a lot to it makes me feel down with Paul and Silas were in a prison they're beating in stocks in the inner prison they didn't look at the stocks and the beatings and the pain they just begin to sing I live because the joy of the Lord was their strength and God shake the place set them free and then and and and met the Philippian Jailer and all you know all those things happen why because they didn't look at their circumstances they looked to the one who is leading them was that amen praise the Lord we're gonna look to the one who's leading us amen now as he said to illuminate the word now illuminate means to Enlighten spiritually or intellectually let's just forget intellectual bit because not our brains that are being stimulated a member Speedy spiritually enlightened Amen to make his word More Alive to us amen because you know as as brother Ryan would say I'm putting on the whole armor of God he'd say now God just brings his word more positive all the time he don't have to refortify it and bring something else up he just makes his word more real all the time and the Bible says when the enemy comes in like a flood the spirit of God raises the standard against it now that now if the enemy comes like a flood God's fortification to his people to fortify them as the word of God and he just raises the word a standard against him amen so he makes his word more real all the time he says he doesn't have to re-fortify us we have the fortification but it's the value you put upon the fortification that matters amen so so he what does he do he makes his word more positive all the time that's why the promises of God maybe Years Gone by we're trying to grasp and say how can this be and how's this going to work but now he's fast forward to 2023 and we say amen that's true it's here hallelujah you know the promises are just become more positive all the time Hallelujah what is that Illuminating his word to you you know it's like you could read a scripture 99 times it couldn't be nothing to you but the hundredth time it just it's like wow I never saw that before but you have seen it before but not spiritually seen it was that God illuminates the scripture for your present need I'm so glad he does that don't you amen his word is our source of strength now don't turn off on me I mean we're going to get somewhere okay if you've got to stand up and wake up we'll do that you know but you know you know the Lord he he gives us strength through by Illuminating his word amen he wants to make his promises more alive the Rapture is more real now than it was when we first believed amen the other power of healing of the holy ghost moving of spiritual gifts of the restoration of the power of God Amen where we are in history becomes has more is more real today amen being the bride of Christ is more real today than when we first believe what he's illuma a door is opened amen it's more than just God sent a prophet now it turns from the prophet to the prophecy amen and the prophecy is the bride adorned in the word of God I mean a people that match him amen Made In His Image Hallelujah Hallelujah isn't that right amen and what what every promise is becoming more alive was that God is Illuminating his word hallelujah amen that's why it's so important read the Bible listen to the message amen pray and you'll find the quotes from the scriptures become more alive to you Hallelujah was that God Illuminating his word to you when he does that amen and it's to glorify his name because how can how can Illuminating his word and how can giving strength not glorify his name it doesn't glorify the one he's been strengthened no it glorifies the one who gave the strength it glorifies the one who gave the Revelation it's not well I know everything look at me I've got it all together because I worked it out if you've worked it all out you've got one thing wrong that you think you're right right no you're going to realize no he's the one who gives Revelation it's not our ability to put quotes and scriptures together that'll get us in a Rapture no it's walking with him it's knowing him he'll lead us and guide us into all truth amen so we've got to say how can I not glorify his name you know you look at the promises of the scripture amen just of healing you know of the gifts you know your healing and different things the supernatural power of God you go back a hundred years or just over 100 years those things were just a longing for the church and but then Azusa Street broker then the restoration of the word happened even through the ministry of brother Brown and all these things were just things that people wanted and now we live in the season of it Hallelujah so how could it not bring bring Glory upon you know you know across our lips of his blessed name and how great he is because remember it's really you know you know the parable says that the merchant man found the Pearl but really the Pearl finds you amen the pearl of great price found you it's not you finding God do you think I'm seeking after God no God's seeking you amen that's why the reason you have a hunger is because he put that hunger in you because he wants to draw you to himself I think I think his brother Isaac said yo yo no man can come to unless my father draws him so if you have a longing it's the father drawing you holy you're a blessed person to have that kind of feeling what's More Than A Feeling Just better burden along it'll say that's the Deep calling to the Deep amen and if there's a hunger in you for God there's a God to respond amen and he's the Lord Jesus Christ Hallelujah so so we see God fulfill his word in this hour the third pull and manifestation how can we not glorify his name Hallelujah amen now the treasure in the field now uh you know I was reading this I think it was strange um why wouldn't why wouldn't they why wouldn't Jesus say when he found the treasure he just he just took the treasure but it says he bought the field now yeah you think it's odd because normally if you find a treasure oh yeah I'll just take that with me and off I go but but he says that he that he sold all that he had I mean no and so and when he had found he hideth and for joither of God and South all that he had that he buy at that field so so he leaves the treasure in the field but he buys the field to get the treasure now normally you just think well you just steal the treasure and it's yours but no he had to buy the field to get the treasure now there's a there's a um saying that one man's trash is another man's treasure once again it's value what value do you put upon it right someone can have a you know like there's um uh you know there's a show my parents used to watch a lot Antiques Roadshow you know people would take an antique or something for you know take it to these experts and they would value it and you know and some people walk in with this thing doesn't look like much but it was worth thousands and thousands of pounds you know it was worth a lot because but but but the value that the person bought you know yeah the person who owned at the valley they put on it was way less than the value of the expert and maybe I thought this is just a trinket this is just some dumb old painting or some funny vars that you know but no it was worth a lot of money and so so one man's trash is another man's treasure some of those things they picked up at flea markets or you know garage sales whatever more but they're worth a lot of money why because one's man's trash another man's treasure so it's all about the value that you put upon it now there's treasure in the field so the reason the reason that the that that Jesus is saying you've got to buy the field where the treasure is it's because so then there's no more dispute about the treasure because if someone's just found with a treasure it's potentially just stolen goods where'd you get that from in that field you stole it give it back right but if you say where'd you get that treasure in that field whose field is it mine well it's yours right so so the field must be bought in order that there's no dispute on the treasure now Lord Jesus made it very clear that his field was bought now I'm going to get into this a little bit now now and in the Old Testament one of the first or maybe the first uh times when a piece of land is bought is when Abraham would buy a parcel of ground to bury his wife in now he would go to the um he would he would go to the sons of Heath and now the children of Heath is in the promised land and and and he talked with them and said no I want to buy a field you know my wife has died I want to buy a cave for her to be buried in and they were willing to give him the cave of Mac Pella just because of who Abraham was but God was showing something through Abraham you know and saying no no you can't give it to me I want to buy I must buy it that there's no dispute that this burying ground is mine and you know they Define the borders you can go read about it and Genesis 23 and you know what's the full price you know they you know you know they had a they had a negotiation going on you know I wanna I want the defined borders of this field and I want the price of the field and you can't give it to me I want to buy it now the devil was going to give all the kingdoms of the world to Jesus one day he says no you can't give it to me I'm gonna buy it amen that now that comes now there's no dispute amen when I dethron you and I take on my Throne I mean there's no dispute thing that belongs to you because I bought the whole world Amen that's what our lord Jesus did he bought the whole world Hallelujah that down Calvary his blood came upon the Earth to purchase not only you and I but this whole whole earth back to Adam's Fallen race amen so so Abraham would buy this buy this film that had the cave of macpeller in it he paid the price and it became his possession for a burying place for his loved ones and so his beloved wife was was buried there in that cave Hallelujah and so now now this is a field now a lot of people as I've said and I'm kind of repeating myself I really want this to stick a lot of people think this is a good philosophy to live by it makes nice people being a Christian is just you know you know we have we have nice fellowship and everyone's friendly and you know the message just gives me Bible truth and it's a nice thing to believe and you know the Miracles are amazing to hear but no there's something within the field of the word there's a burying place there's the burying place within the field of the word amen that is the place we want amen it can be a very nice place but it's the bearing place I mean because now Abraham was was spiritual remember remember when he was there in the promised land he met he met the king of the New Jerusalem he met Melchizedek and then and then when he met God he just had a confession I'm a I'm a Sojourner in this land sure it's been promised to me but I'm just a pilgrim I'm looking for a city and maybe if someone say well are you looking for Damascus or Hebron are you looking for maybe uh maybe Cairo if it was called that in that day you know whatever the capital of Egypt was or some great big city he says no no I'm looking for a different city well where is it is it is it here on no it's here and you'd look around there's just fields and it's a there's a river and then where's this where's the city all right it's going to come down it's going to come down on the spot how do you know I met the king of that City Hallelujah so he knew he had a revelation the resurrection was going to take place in that field take place in that land and that's why Joseph Joseph told told the Israelites he said don't bury don't leave my bones here in in Egypt sure he could have had probably one of the greatest tombs ever made was would have been for Joseph but he didn't want to be buried in a nice tomb in the world in Egypt he would be buried in the promised land because in the promised land a resurrection was going to take place so I was very a bit why because he saw more than just a nice land he saw there's actually in the Slanders the resurrection I trust that you see in the land of the word of the message there's Resurrection in this land that I trust has been quickened to your soul there's a resurrection in this word there's a body change in this word amen it's more than just nice ideas and quotes and things to live by but there's a resurrection in this field Hallelujah amen Ruth would Ruth was a mile bite she would she would come into a field one day amen we know the story where where where Naomi and her husband and two sons they they left they left the promised land they went into Moab because of a famine now this is just me now now we know everything had to work out for Nomi to come in right but if you look at her on one hand if they had a revelation that the resurrection was going to happen there they would never have left the land it doesn't matter how bad it got how hard things got how much food they didn't have I mean I realized no Moab may be a good land but the resurrection is not there it's here in this field amen and people I believe if they if they really had a revelation it doesn't matter what Storms Come What persecution comes what Trouble Comes what trial comes we're not leaving this word for nothing there's a resurrection in this world I mean in this field is a resurrection Hallelujah so so she would she would marry one of Naomi's sons and but of course we know sadly that you know Naomi's um husband died her two sons die and then and then Ruth and then offer which is the other daughter-in-law you know um they're there were through Umi says I'm going to go back to Israel because I had his grain there again there's food and um Naomi tells her daughters-in-law just stay here there's no point coming home with me you just stay here and offer offer you know whipped and she went back home but Naomi said I mean sorry Ruth said to know me I'm gonna go with you where your people are will be my people your God will be my God where you die I'll die she was being brought into a field Hallelujah now what's amazing about this is that is that it says in the law now maybe jumping around a bit but in the law now it says an ammonite or a moabite shall not enter into the congregation of the Lord even to their 10th Generation shall they not enter into the congregation of the Lord forever so the law said they weren't allowed in they weren't welcome but if there's a desire in a human heart Grace will overshadow the law and make a way every time Hallelujah so so the law said she wasn't allowed in but Grace overshadowed that law in the form of Boaz amen and brought her into the lineage of Jesus Christ amen and that's what I love about our lord Jesus is it sure there's the law saying we're condemned we're worthy of hell we're gonna but Grace overshadows the law Hallelujah when we needed a Kinsmen just like she needed a Kinsman she needed a boa she needed an Israelite to redeem her having to bring her into the covenants of Israel I mean so we needed a Kinsmen Redeemer to come and redeem us back to God doesn't matter how good we think we're hell how holy we think we are we needed someone to come from Glory I mean without someone coming amen we'd be lost amen because remember we're all born and born by sex born lost amen but so so one had to be born to the human race created in the womb of Mary as a human being to redeem us back to God and only God could be the one who's who has made there amen amen because why the word became flesh and dwelt Among Us amen so Grace law required a substitute required a you know the penalty paid and Grace met the requirement and our Lord Jesus Christ brother Graham says this he says in the breach message and God create required a Kinsmen Redeemer and he must be a human oh my what are we going to do now law required a kinsman redeemer now we couldn't take an angel he he had to have a man because we're not kin to the angel we're kin to one another the angel never fell he's a different kind of a being got a different body he never sinned or nothing he's different but the law required a kensan redeemer and every man on Earth was born of sex now don't you see where it come from oh that's where sin started you see where it's at now where he comes you'll see to The Serpent and see now notice required a kinsman redeemer a redeemer a kinsman redeemer must be born of the human race here that leaves us out on a limb but let me sound a trumpet to you the Virgin birth produced a product amen the Virgin birth produced our kinsman redeemer none other than the almighty God became Emmanuel one of us Emmanuel the kinsman redeemer was met you see how God makes a requirement and there's nothing we can do but then Grace steps in and overshadows that law and produces the product amen hallelujah so the law said she wasn't allowed in but Grace overshadowed that law but why is that because you sound she found herself in a certain field it wasn't just any field in Israel it wasn't just any field around Bethlehem but it was boaz's field the Mighty Man of wealth it was his field so Grace brought her into into his field now sure there was food in that field there was grain in that field so there was there was something to survive by but the treasure in the field wasn't the grain to Ruth the treasure in the field was Boaz himself I mean that was the pearl of great price to her amen because when Grace stepped in in the form of Boaz to Ruth amen it changed Hallelujah it changed it changed her that her identity of being a moabite was gone and her identity was now found in him Amy because remember gray steps in not because of who we think we are or our current state our current state is irrelevant you may be hurting you may be bleeding on the inside you may be broken you may be lost you maybe have a million questions that don't matter to God I mean that doesn't hold you that doesn't separate you one bit from the grace of God no it's not our current state that doesn't that doesn't hold us back gray steps in because we have a desire remember Ruth had a desire know me your God will be my God your people will be my people will your die I'm gonna die she had a desire amen and Grace stepped in and met that desire so if you ever hunger for God this morning God's here to meet that desire Hallelujah now we're going to understand that she had more than just now a good a good land to live in Hallelujah there's a lot in this field I know I'm probably repeating the same thing but I I just want God to Anchor it into our hearts there's a resurrection in this land and this message is a body change Hallelujah so so here she comes in I mean she becomes Mrs Boaz of Bethlehem amen now the promised land was and and then she was buried in that Promised Land right now the promised land was a good land it flowed with milk and honey that was a good place to raise family plant Vineyards farm the land have cattle sheeps and goats but it's so much more than that amen it was there was a resurrection in that field or that land that's really all that mattered amen because there's a resurrection in that place now now Boaz would tell Ruth he would say Do not glean in another field neither go from hence but abide here fast by my maidens so Boaz is telling for the lord of the Harvest is telling her himself don't go to other fields don't go into a different kind of way stay in this field of the message I mean stay in the word of the son of man don't don't go off into some Presbyterian Catholic Roman Catholic idea some of the new age thing stay in the field of the word I mean stay in there that's where it's Commander don't go out and glean anything else stay here and get your food your spiritual food amen and you know Brother Brad was saying here she was gleaning behind picking up these little greens and the lord of the Harvest fell in love with her her being an alien what a picture my I just love that and then he said whose dams was this and they begin to speak and say it is a moabite who come and with know me and he went out to her and spoke peace to her and said don't you leave this field God be merciles stay put don't be tossed about every wind of Doctrine stay in the word amen it's like Jesus would say when he'd say in in in John 8 and 31 then said Jesus to those Jews which believed on him if ye continue in my word then you are my disciples indeed now that word continue means such a verb it's a doing word it means to stay it means to abide it means to dwell it means to endure to be present to remain I mean to stand so he says if you continue so if you dwell if you abide in my word if you endure in my workers tribulations troubles are going to try and push you out of the field amen but if you stay if you be present if you remain then you are my disciples indeed right but it's more than just saying yeah but but there's a blessing that comes with this right and you shall know the truth and the truth shall make you free amen so now now we know the truth is not just a collection of ideas right it's not just some evidence that points to a conclusion oh that's true no the truth is a person Jesus said I am the way the truth and the life amen so you shall know the truth in other words you'll become one with the truth I mean I'm going to join myself too like Boaz joined himself to root they were married amen so you shall know the truth you'll be intimately you shall intimately know the truth you're going to intimately know the Lord Jesus Christ and his word you know his heart you know his desires and what there's a power now in him to make you free see it's not us that frees our ourselves now you shall know the truth and the truth shall make you free so if you abide in his word amen the truth shall make you free if you remain in his word the truth will make you free if you dwell in it the truth will make you free what there's a power in the truth to free us from every entanglement every snare every trouble from the devil every mind battle every complex there's power in the Lord Jesus Christ the looseness of all those things I assume the sun is set free is free indeed Hallelujah that's why he says abide in the word stay in the field don't don't go looking up on specialty doctrines and eighth Messengers and all kind of nonsense no just stay in the field of the of the word amen Hallelujah so it's very important but you see now this res there's Resurrection in that land in the Promised Land see some people just become believers they see a land flowing with milk and honey of revelation of true Bible Doctrine the mystery of God revealed see this land of the word will produce genuine Bible believing Christians it'll produce real families it'll produce real fathers mothers real young people amen people say okay so I'm not sure that's fine just say in the word and you'll see it produce it right you'll see it really transform your life if you let them transform you he'll transform you I mean into the image of his word but there's so much more to it than that see the treasure in the hidden treasure in the field is the rapture it's the resurrection Hallelujah that's that's the treasure in the message is a body change hallelujah it's more than just good quotes and good families and good church and good preaching good singing good whatever good young people all those things are great and I appreciate them but there's a resurrection in this land I mean there's a resurrection in this message Hallelujah amen brother man was saying in Exodus let's forget Joseph that I mentioned before when he died years later Jacob was taken back bird with Abraham Joseph and when he died he said don't bury my bones down here why take my bones when you go out bury them in the promised land why he knew that there was a resurrection the first fruits of the Resurrection that Jesus was coming and when he come and they did it for him and they said and then on Easter morning when he arose up to Matthew 27 the Bible said that many of the bodies of the saints that slept in the dust I mean of the Earth come out of the graves of the resurrection and entered into Glory with him who was it Abraham Isaac and Jacob amen they were spiritual they had discernment that they knowed that the resurrection was not going to take place down in Egypt it was going to take place in the promised land and Brethren tonight I know that from leaving the Baptist Church so forth I got a lot of criticism and so forth by seeing the spiritual meaning of the coming of the Lord for those who are in Christ will God bring with them at the resurrection you can have all your Fanatics you want and have all your big denominations but bear me in Christ for them that are in Christ God will bring with them at the resurrection amen bury me in Christ don't bury me in a church philosophy don't bury me in a religion or even just a bunch of quotes bear me in the resurrected Lord Jesus Christ hallelujah amen that's exactly where we need to be buried amen because Joseph had her Joseph had a revelation that Messiah was going to stand in that Promised Land one day Hallelujah that's why and if people had a revelation of this word that there was that Messiah is in this word that Jesus Christ is revealed in this message amen they would never leave it if they see us Messiah revealed amen that the message reveals Jesus Christ in the scripture that it wouldn't bother anyone about you know doesn't matter about storms and all the stuff see the mess is not about brother Branham it's about Jesus Christ revealed through him and when you get that Revelation doesn't matter what the storms come trials persecution you'll never leave the word because you see it's Jesus Christ there but you see unfortunately a lot of people are you know some people are like the half tribe of manassar and Gad and Reuben they settled on the wrong side of the Jordan River amen they they were coming up to the Jordan and the numbers 32 it says the children of Reuben and the children of GAD had a very great multitude of cattle and when they saw that land oh of Jesus which is on the east side of Jordan and the land of Gilead that behold the place was a place for cattle it says in verse 5 wherefore they said if we have found Grace in thy sight let this land be given to thy servants for a possession and bring us not over Jordan so it's amazing when you think about it they'd come right to the Borderland remember the the resurrection and type is in the Promised Land but yet because they had so many cattle they thought this place is perfect for what we've brought with us to me it you know it's crazy when you think about it that they were so close but yet the things they brought with them kept them out of the land you know if for me if I was them and and you know I was given an inheritance that that it wasn't um for cattle I'd rather shoot the cattle sell the cattle or get rid of the kettle you know whatever thing that I brought with me out of Egypt I wouldn't want that hindering me from crossing the Jordan amen where it's malice or Pride or something you know you know people people have a pride in what they used to be that's got to die or some kind of forgiveness you know some kind of bad attitude religious ideas Traditions justifying yourself or justifying besetting sins that are stopping you from Crossing Jordan amen never say well I'll just dwell right here on the east side of Jordan that's the wrong place to settle down because there's no Resurrection on the wrong side of Jordan I mean there's you know sadly there's no part there's no Rapture on the wrong side of Jordan you've ever come you've got to Cross Jordan amen now we know Jordan represents a death to self where you really die out to your old self and your old ways and what you used to be and you truly are born again your Nature's changed I mean you've you know you have a skeptical you know um way of thinking about the word and you need all this different you know you're skeptical unbelief way of thinking but then when you really die out to that and faith comes in what you become a new creature in Christ when the Holy Ghost comes in and transforms you what's that you've crossed Jordan you're in the Promised Land and it's amazing when you when you read about this you know that that that Moses says that you're basically you're doing the same sin that the ten spies did that they said we couldn't take the land by by settling down on the wrong side of Jordan what is it is unbelief actually kept them out of the land and now if you read the rest of this they are told by Moses that you have to go fight with the rest of the children of Israel that you'll get that they'll get their inheritance so people can come to church they can sing they can preach they can play they can pray they can be a witness they can they can you know do all kinds of things but yet they're still on the wrong side of Jordan and they will fight and help all the rest of the Bride take their inheritance in the promised land but yet they're still out of it because this is what they did because I said because Moses said you got to go on before everyone and you've got to fight that everyone else will take their inheritance but they're on the wrong side of Jordan see we don't want to just be part of a church and receive blessings you know the Holy Ghost comes down we get blessed Wednesday and Sunday Wherever We Gather we don't just want to be part of a church like they'd be on the wrong side of Jordan we want to come in and meet the Lord that's not just that that we're not just living off external blessings but it's now an internal blessing that is well of Living Waters flows out of us the Holy Ghost amen that changes our nature that we're not just living and looking in and just besetting sins and things hold us back and but no no we've sold out we've burnt every bridge remember the one who saw the treasure in that field sold all that he had to get the field just like the pearl of great price sold all that he had to get that Pearl amen so the things you hold as Treasures in your heart you're willing just to sell it all to take the Lord Jesus Christ amen we don't just want to be around the message we don't just want to be a part of the church Amy we want to be part of the Lord amen that the message is not just something that we listen to it's within us the Lord Jesus Christ is within us himself amen so whatever you do friends don't let anything keep you out of the Promised Land well I've got a Life to Live I've got things I want to do meet the Lord he'll give you five greater things to do and there won't be any regret with those things there won't be any I wish I never did that there won't be any regrets Hallelujah isn't that right we you know we want to cross the Jordan if you have you should just be praise God he's revealed to me there's a resurrection in this land and the reason he reveals it to you is because you're part of the Resurrection amen Ruth probably didn't she had no idea that you know she just found herself in a field but then Grace found her in that field as like us you know we maybe stumble into a meeting heard the message somewhere maybe even growing up in it but one day Grace Finds Us in that state amen and and God quickens himself to us he becomes alive to us changes us forever what happens amen we've seen this Resurrection in the land in this field Hallelujah praise the Lord why are you saying all this we've got to get Beyond just we have a nice Church we've got to get Beyond These are nice people we're to get Beyond this is maybe our special meetings and this is happening and no you got to know him you got to know him you've got to hear the voice behind the voice and realize that it's not brother Brandon preaching sure this is Humanity but God has been forget about the man speaking it's Jesus Christ being revealed through that man I mean he said yo people say well I don't know 16 people who ever wrote this book oh it's man it's been translated hundreds of times look beyond that God protects his word if God is his word he will protect his word that every generation will have a true translation of his word amen so we're going to look beyond that and say actually no this is a pearl of great price I had a lot of philosophies just be a good person be a good you know we should never just raise our children just to be good this message is not just being out be quiet shut up sit here eat this dress this do this do that that's not what being a Believer is we don't just raise our children to be good people if you're majoring on those things you've missed the whole Vision actually the vision is children the Lord found us Hallelujah he lives in us he found us one day I was in darkness now I'm in light he found me amen I was in this field of the world and I found this pearl of great price I found this treasure amen's mother it's worth more than gold and riches and careers and whatever more it's going to take me to Heaven it's him in this place amen that he found me that's what we should be majoring on our God is real he's not dead his promise is a true even though time should carry his promises are still true snap out of just looking at Natural Things and look at the spiritual oh look at that that's how we should be Jesus found us well what about the rest of the world well I'm just happy I'm in and Lord it'd make me a influence that the rest of the world can come in because people think well it's not fair well actually
