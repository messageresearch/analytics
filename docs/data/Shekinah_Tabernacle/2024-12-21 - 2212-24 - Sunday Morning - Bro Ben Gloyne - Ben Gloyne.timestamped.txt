[0:51] [Music]
[1:30] I
[1:32] [Music]
[2:21] s
[2:24] [Music]
[2:45] [Laughter]
[2:49] me thank you we going okay I'll start
[2:53] again I'm very happy to be here this
[2:55] morning I'm happy to see you all I'm
[2:57] happy to be to have an opportunity to
[2:59] meet with the Living God this morning
[3:01] I'm happy to be able to sing praises to
[3:02] the Lord and I'm happy to be able to um
[3:05] hear the word of God this morning I
[3:08] think this is one of the best things we
[3:09] can ever do on this Earth really is to
[3:11] get in the presence of God and here we
[3:13] are this morning lying at the cusp of it
[3:15] all even now you know we're in it so
[3:17] we're going to have such a good time and
[3:18] just as I was um trying to get a few
[3:21] songs together last night the song kept
[3:23] on coming to me which
[3:25] was um lift up your heads oh your Gates
[3:28] swing wide you Everlasting
[3:30] and the song used to be a toad a song
[3:33] actually because every time we would go
[3:35] there there was a time where they were
[3:37] having a real Revival and there was
[3:39] there were a lot of new people coming
[3:40] and I think over the course of two or
[3:42] three years it just exponentially grew
[3:44] and it was just an amazing time to go
[3:46] there each every couple of months and
[3:48] just be a part of that and they always
[3:49] seem to sing the song So it always
[3:51] always related the song to them but then
[3:54] when we came
[3:55] here I don't know how this happened but
[3:58] over time brother Kubin sort of snatched
[3:59] the song from them and it became his
[4:03] song so every time we sing it I always
[4:05] think of brother Kubin and um I am going
[4:08] to come and ask you to pray so make sure
[4:10] can you make sure he's got a mic um but
[4:13] you know I said to him last week you
[4:14] know when when the anointing comes down
[4:16] and we're just worshiping the Lord I
[4:18] often sometimes I have my eyes closed
[4:20] and I'm just worshiping and it feels so
[4:23] good that I can just play naturally and
[4:24] worship I feel so happy that I can just
[4:26] express everything naturally when I want
[4:29] to but then in the back I hear Kubin
[4:30] start to clap and it's so far at a time
[4:33] you wouldn't believe it you know it just
[4:35] goes and no matter what we're playing
[4:37] man that clap is just going to do
[4:39] whatever it
[4:40] wants and it makes me feel so good I
[4:43] said to him last week don't ever stop
[4:44] doing that if you want to clap you clap
[4:45] as loud as you can man and you clap you
[4:47] clap as out of time as you can cuz it
[4:49] means something to me it means it means
[4:51] you just want to express it and you just
[4:53] want to praise the Lord you know it's so
[4:55] good and we all just praise the Lord in
[4:57] our own different way but that's just a
[4:58] a special way that brother Kubin do so
[5:00] can I ask you to come up and open up in
[5:02] prayer brother Kubin and let's um let's
[5:03] stand this morning
[5:08] [Music]
[5:10] amen let's give a clap for brother
[5:13] [Applause]

[39:52] 10-14 just a bit of a um I guess a
[39:56] context I was going to speak on
[39:57] something and then last night my
[39:59] thoughts just went to a totally
[40:00] different direction so U I just pray
[40:03] this all kind of ties together today uh
[40:05] but here
[40:08] the uh this is the Angel speaking to the
[40:10] Shepherds he says and the and the angel
[40:12] said unto them fear not for behold I
[40:14] bring you good tidings of great joy
[40:17] which uh shall be for all people for un
[40:19] he was born this day in the city of
[40:21] David a savior which is Christ the lord
[40:24] and this shall be a sign unto you you
[40:26] shall find the babe wrapped in swaddling
[40:28] clothes laying in a Manger he said
[40:30] suddenly there was uh with a with the
[40:32] angel a multitude of the Heavenly hosts
[40:34] praising God and saying glory to God in
[40:36] the highest and on Earth peace and Good
[40:38] Will toward men amen so let's uh let's
[40:42] pray this morning amen let's bow our
[40:43] heads and amen gracious father we're so

[41:27] in Jesus Christ's name amen amen God
[41:30] bless you uh everyone you can have your
[41:32] seats this morning so I want to talk
[41:34] about God's God's wrapped gift so God's
[41:37] gift to the age amen God's gift to you
[41:39] amen so I want to talk about that today
[41:41] seeing it's the Christmas season and I
[41:43] guess really uh this could be for any
[41:45] any any Sunday but this is a good um
[41:48] time to speak about it because you know
[41:49] really as as this world has gotten
[41:51] busier and you uh the hustle and bustle
[41:54] of life has just really increased I
[41:56] think it's time when we we really take
[41:58] stock of really what Christmas is all
[41:59] about so am mean so God God God always
[42:02] sends a gift to every age and God's I
[42:05] just going to make some uh as we go
[42:06] along I'll try and keep up with the
[42:08] slideshow and everything but you know uh
[42:11] see this see this gift we know is God's
[42:13] Gift of eternal life which which which
[42:15] should be in you Christ in you the hope
[42:17] of glory the scripture would say now we
[42:19] know God's gifts are always
[42:20] misunderstood they're always uh they're
[42:22] always misunderstood by the world and
[42:25] even when you think about you know uh uh
[42:27] the day of Pentecost when you know when
[42:29] the Holy Ghost had come the you know God
[42:31] was now dwelling in his people once
[42:33] again the gift of eternal life was now
[42:35] in the church the greatest the greatest
[42:37] event really you know the death barri
[42:39] resurrection of Our Lord which of course
[42:41] ties in the resurrection his
[42:43] resurrection ties them with the
[42:44] resurrection of the living Saints here
[42:46] they were quickened from Death To Life
[42:47] filled with the Holy Spirit even the
[42:50] even the people said that you know what
[42:52] does this all mean they thought they're
[42:53] just drunk with new wine so they were
[42:55] misunderstanding what was going on and
[42:57] that's always what happens when God's
[42:59] Gift comes people misunderstand really
[43:02] the effect of it you know where where
[43:04] Peter would stand up and say no no hold
[43:06] on you're misunderstanding what you see
[43:08] these people aren't drunk but they're
[43:10] filled with the Holy Ghost this what you
[43:12] see in front of you is the Fulfillment
[43:13] of the prophecy of Joel so people will
[43:16] misunderstand the message of the hour
[43:18] right they'll misunderstand God sending
[43:20] a prophet they'll say it's a cult or
[43:22] it's a people following a man or it's
[43:24] just Pentecostalism with the gifts and
[43:26] you know you know with a Twist added to
[43:28] it see cuz people always try and put you
[43:29] in a box they always try and put God's
[43:31] Gift in a box because they misunderstand
[43:34] what's going on so don't be don't be
[43:36] surprised if people misunderstand when
[43:39] you try and share with them the hope
[43:40] that you have within you amen of of the
[43:43] resurrection of this word that's coming
[43:44] to this age to transform our bodies
[43:47] right because people want to what are
[43:49] you are you Baptist are you Pentecostal
[43:51] are you what what is this you know you
[43:52] Jehovah's Witness are you what you know
[43:54] but no we believe the full word of God
[43:56] you know as as the king I mean as Paul
[43:59] would say to King AG grippa in the way
[44:01] that is called heresy do I worship the
[44:04] god of our fathers believing all the law
[44:06] and the prophets we just believe the
[44:07] whole word of God around here right so
[44:10] people want to always
[44:12] misunderstand what's going on what what
[44:15] what God's gift is they think it's
[44:17] something else because they see the
[44:18] manifestation of it they want to put
[44:20] that in a box trying and work out what
[44:21] it is but but we can say no this is not
[44:24] this is not a uh you know something that
[44:27] you a box that you know God can't be put
[44:29] in a box right you know this is no this
[44:32] is the word spoken by Malachi 4 of
[44:34] turning the hearts of the children back
[44:36] to the faith of the fathers amen this is
[44:38] the revealing of the son of man this is
[44:40] the full restoration of the word amen
[44:43] this is the prophecy of Joel saying I
[44:45] will restore right all these things are
[44:47] included but you see it's the wrapping
[44:50] see what happens is they were caught up
[44:51] in the wrapping because God's Gift went
[44:53] from Jesus into the church right and so
[44:57] God's gift is always wrapped so we're
[44:58] going to go through the wrapping and the
[45:00] inside but it's the inside that counts
[45:02] okay so the wrapping does show what's
[45:06] inside but the wrapping is not the most
[45:07] important thing I'll say the wrapping
[45:10] can be the biggest stumbling point of
[45:11] the gift amen cuz you know Israel see
[45:14] see God's gift to Israel when they were
[45:16] in Egypt was Moses god heard their cries
[45:19] God came down to fulfill the word and
[45:22] what did he do he said I've heard the
[45:23] cries of my people when he speaking to
[45:25] Moses at the burning bush he says behold
[45:28] I'll I'm sending you he says I've come
[45:30] down to deliver them but I'm sending you
[45:31] what did he do he wrapped himself up in
[45:34] humanity and A Man Called Moses as a
[45:36] prophet messenger and so now what
[45:38] happened is those people who stumbled at
[45:41] the wrapping did not get the gift of
[45:43] dwelling in the promised land I mean you
[45:45] see they would say in Exodus 14:11 you
[45:48] know they'd say to Moses I think this is
[45:50] when they were uh by the Red Sea he said
[45:53] you they said unto Moses has out you uh
[45:56] because there's no great in Egypt has
[45:58] thou taken us away to die in the
[45:59] wilderness my question is did Moses take
[46:01] them out no God took them out God
[46:05] delivered them Moses tried once upon a
[46:07] time he killed one Egyptian he failed
[46:08] miserably I mean so it wasn't but you
[46:10] see they caught up in the rapping they
[46:13] caught up in the veil of the Prophet
[46:14] they didn't they were missing they were
[46:16] missing the the gift that God had sent
[46:18] them amen and how much more you know you
[46:21] could say about the same with our lord
[46:23] Jesus how how people would stumble at
[46:25] the rapping he is God's gift to the
[46:27] world but he was a lonely man of Galilee
[46:30] he dressed like any other man he wasn't
[46:33] dressed in some you know fancy kind of
[46:35] clothing he didn't look different you
[46:37] know you know we see many traditional uh
[46:39] pictures of Jesus that everyone's got
[46:41] brown hair and you know white skin
[46:43] whatever more but he's blonde and he's
[46:44] tall and he's this and no he would have
[46:46] looked like everyone else that's right
[46:48] right but it's but it's the rapping
[46:50] people stumble you know Jesus you know
[46:52] when you know when he came the people
[46:54] wanted a great King to deliver them they
[46:57] wanted a great man to come and beat down
[46:59] the Romans and drive them out and
[47:01] restore their sovereignty but what did
[47:03] God said God sent a baby in a Manger
[47:06] that was the answer to their prayer you
[47:08] see God sends what we need what not what
[47:10] we want see he sends what we need not
[47:13] what is according to what we think it
[47:15] should be and how many people will will
[47:17] will throw away the gift of eternal life
[47:19] because they disagree with the rapping
[47:20] oh it doesn't gel with me it doesn't
[47:22] agree with me I'll tell the
[47:23] predestinated seat of God will gel with
[47:26] the gift of God
[47:27] I mean they will J with eternal life
[47:29] doesn't matter if they're rich poor fat
[47:31] thin whatever whatever doesn't matter
[47:33] what skin color nationality language
[47:35] amen if there's a seed in there they'll
[47:37] say yes and they will not just look at
[47:39] the wrapping they'll get the gift in the
[47:42] wrapping that's right amen so they were
[47:44] expecting a great Mighty conqueror but
[47:46] God sent them a baby God sent them what
[47:50] they needed amen and it's the same thing
[47:52] but see you've got to accept it the way
[47:54] God sends it and be happy about it not
[47:57] just not just you you got to be so Lord
[47:59] thank you how however you come Lord I'm
[48:01] happy about that amen amen see when God
[48:04] anchors a little something in your heart
[48:06] and it says this is it believe it hold
[48:08] on to it that's God's word he promised
[48:10] he'd confirm it to you and if he
[48:11] confirms the word hold on to it am mean
[48:15] you see the wrapping uh so now I don't
[48:17] mean to I because I just want to get
[48:19] this picture of a gift because on
[48:21] Wednesday there's going to be a lot of
[48:23] exchanging of gifts go on right so I
[48:25] want you when you receive rece a gift or
[48:27] give a gift I pray that you'll see Nails
[48:29] God hands and eternal life which is him
[48:32] be given and received it will be more
[48:35] sure you probably there's things under
[48:37] the tree or whatever you do that you
[48:39] wanted but may it transcend that when
[48:42] that takes place you say thank you Lord
[48:44] for that gift of eternal life so when I
[48:45] talk about the rapping I'm talking about
[48:47] the Lord but I just want to just kind of
[48:48] solidify this this in our minds right
[48:51] you see the scribes and Pharisees did
[48:54] not like how the rapping behaved
[48:57] Jesus right he was always doing things
[48:59] contrary to what they thought the
[49:01] Messiah would do we know brother Braham
[49:03] says many times that when they would
[49:04] talk about the Messiah they'd say well
[49:06] he's going to come out of this Bible
[49:07] school or God's going to you know turn a
[49:10] crank and a you know a Stairway is going
[49:11] to come down from heaven and you know
[49:13] he's going to walk down and come to the
[49:14] high priest and say here I am or it's
[49:16] going to be brother so and so because
[49:18] he's a very smart kind of man but God
[49:20] bypassed all of that and was born in a
[49:23] manger but he was born we know exactly
[49:25] where his word said he would be born
[49:28] right but you see Jesus constantly did
[49:30] things that did not agree or gel with
[49:33] what the scribes and Pharisees thought
[49:34] the Messiah would do it's amazing you go
[49:36] read the gospels how many times Jesus
[49:38] healed or did something on the Sabbath
[49:40] day which wasn't contrary to the word
[49:42] but it was contrary to what they thought
[49:43] the word should be so it's amazing when
[49:46] he would come into their church and he
[49:47] would heal people they were some were
[49:49] tormented or sick for very many long you
[49:52] know for a very long time this you know
[49:54] this lady here that was loose from her
[49:55] infirmity I think it was 18 years or
[49:57] something that she had this problem you
[49:59] know and the and the synagogue leaders
[50:01] did not rejoice at this they weren't
[50:03] happy with God's Gift even being in
[50:05] their Church they were upset when he
[50:07] acted contrary to what they expected a
[50:09] person to act like but here was the
[50:11] resurrection and the life that was
[50:13] sitting in their Pew singing their songs
[50:15] listening to their word and he got up
[50:17] and began to do what he does and they
[50:18] got upset I pray we never get into that
[50:21] category of thing where where where
[50:23] things appear a little bit out of order
[50:24] and things don't seem quite right but
[50:26] it's God doing it amen cuz we got to
[50:28] realize that when God does something
[50:30] it's never out of order but but maybe we
[50:32] never have an attitude I don't agree
[50:34] with that but yet it's God the whole
[50:36] time right so so so they got upset they
[50:39] were got annoyed where where where it
[50:40] healed us you know they said basically
[50:43] don't come on the Sabbath to be healed
[50:44] there's six other days of the week why
[50:46] didn't you come and do it then but that
[50:47] was the day because he wanted her to
[50:50] rest amen after being suffering for so
[50:53] long and that's what the Lord wants to
[50:54] do he wants to heal us heal our Spirits
[50:56] heal our bodies we can rest and not just
[50:58] that but our souls most more importantly
[51:01] right but they got upset by what the
[51:02] gift was doing in their midst so they
[51:04] wanted they do they didn't want him
[51:05] there they they did not welcome him amen
[51:09] it's the same thing with you know and
[51:11] they and they could not identify because
[51:13] he came he came so different to what
[51:16] they
[51:17] expected they they weren't uh you know
[51:20] they didn't welcome him but you see the
[51:21] real believer isn't interested in the
[51:23] rapping that's right however God comes
[51:25] he's just happy you know they're more
[51:28] interested in the effects of the gift
[51:30] than they are the rapping people want to
[51:32] debate the rapping oh he came from
[51:34] Kentucky and he said this and he said
[51:36] this and all the debates and things
[51:38] about the prophet I'm not interested in
[51:39] the rapping thank God he sent us a
[51:42] prophet thank thank God he he sent
[51:44] Elijah to the Earth to restore us back
[51:45] to the original faith of the word I'm
[51:47] thankful for that but I'm more
[51:49] interested in the effects of his message
[51:51] more than the messenger himself amen
[51:53] it's like when Jesus would um find a man
[51:56] who was born blind and there be a you
[51:58] know there came a big debate about him
[52:00] you know they were you know he you know
[52:02] he was brought in before the scribes and
[52:04] fares because people said oh this is not
[52:07] quite him he looks like him he said no
[52:08] I'm the man that was born blind you've
[52:10] known me my entire life but now I can
[52:12] see and they would debate back and forth
[52:14] well why are you you know how can you
[52:16] see what happened and you know this man
[52:19] had never seen the rapping before he was
[52:21] blind y That's Right amen but then his
[52:23] eyes came open when he washed in the
[52:25] pool right because because the Lord
[52:27] Jesus Took clay and to me he took that
[52:29] clay that needed become that eyeball put
[52:32] it into put it upon him he said go wash
[52:34] in the pool of salom right so he had
[52:36] never seen the rapping before he had no
[52:38] time to be caught up in the wrapping but
[52:40] to me if he saw the Lord before he would
[52:42] have accepted him anyway right but you
[52:44] see thing so but then the the scribes
[52:46] and Pharisees were all caught up in the
[52:48] wrapping of the gift they couldn't they
[52:50] couldn't accept the fact that this that
[52:52] that that the Lord Jesus had had healed
[52:54] someone had opened someone's eyes and
[52:57] this had and and someone who had been
[52:59] born blind no one in the history of the
[53:02] world had ever been healed of being born
[53:04] blind and here was here was it right in
[53:07] their midst and so they then they call
[53:09] in the parents and of course they're
[53:11] afraid you got to I don't have all the
[53:12] scripture here but go read John 9 yeah I
[53:15] you I like this chapter you know but but
[53:17] the parents were afraid to testify yes
[53:19] it was Jesus who healed their son
[53:21] because the scribes and Pharisees said
[53:22] if anyone confess the lord they're going
[53:24] to be put out of the synagogue right you
[53:26] see so what happened is they said well
[53:28] he's of age ask him and then you know
[53:30] you they just said to him you know give
[53:32] God the praise we know this man is a
[53:34] sinner so basically give God praise we
[53:36] know God's healed you but this guy this
[53:38] rapping is contrary to what we think God
[53:40] would be amen a righteous man but you
[53:42] see this man born blind as I said before
[53:44] had no trouble with the Lord with the
[53:46] rapping he was just interested in the
[53:48] effects of God's Gift in his life amen
[53:51] and I pray it's the same thing with the
[53:52] message of the hour in your life amen
[53:55] you just you're just interested in the
[53:56] effects it saved you from sin
[53:58] transformed your life the Bible became a
[54:00] new book amen oh you you see where you
[54:02] are in time it's changed your nature
[54:04] changed your life it has transformed you
[54:08] all we can say is once I was lost now
[54:09] I'm found once I was blind once I was in
[54:13] religion but now I see the true Promises
[54:15] of the word and I Reed the Holy Ghost
[54:17] like they did in the book of Acts that's
[54:18] good enough for me amen
[54:22] amen you see even even the woman at the
[54:25] well was unsure about the rapping
[54:26] because of of of of cultural ideas and
[54:30] understandings but you see God God never
[54:33] um God allows the believer to go beyond
[54:36] those things cuz he would say when Jesus
[54:39] would say to her give me a drink uh she
[54:42] basically said we have no dealings why
[54:44] are you talking to me I'm a Samaritan
[54:46] you're a Jew there's segregation here we
[54:48] don't talk to one another but then but
[54:50] then Jesus began to talk to her about
[54:52] living water and you know all these
[54:54] things and finally you know finally
[54:57] uh he would um she would say we she said
[55:01] I know when Messiah cometh he will he
[55:04] will tell us these things and and he
[55:08] said to her he that speaks there am he
[55:10] so what did he do she looked she looked
[55:12] beyond the wrapping and saw eternal life
[55:16] saw the gift Hallelujah aren't you glad
[55:19] he came to you and did the same thing in
[55:21] in your life I trust we're all together
[55:23] here this morning amen you see you got
[55:26] to see how see every believer I your I
[55:29] believe will actually be the same way
[55:31] they are actually comfortable with the
[55:32] wrapping God takes away those
[55:34] preconceived ideas and then we become
[55:36] comfortable yes this is God I can see it
[55:39] in the Bible I can see it in the word I
[55:40] can see the message in the word that
[55:42] that makes the believer
[55:44] comfortable amen look at the Shepherds
[55:47] they had no problem with the Angel's
[55:48] message they could receive it and
[55:50] believe it and follow it because they
[55:52] were comfortable in a Manger it was like
[55:54] their second home they had no trouble
[55:56] amen receiving that Angel's message and
[55:59] even even the um you know even the um
[56:01] wise men so we go from the very poor to
[56:03] the very rich they had no trouble
[56:05] following the star you know if they had
[56:08] trouble they would have said no we're
[56:09] going to stay in Jerusalem this is where
[56:11] all the Palaces are this where all the
[56:12] nice places are but they were happy to
[56:14] go to go to a little out of the way
[56:16] Bethlehem it wasn't actually a big place
[56:18] to a little house to a poor family that
[56:21] was where that was where God's gift was
[56:23] they had no trouble being identified
[56:25] with that amen amen I trust it's the
[56:28] same with us oh well I'm you know raised
[56:31] a certain way or I've got a certain
[56:33] background I trust that doesn't hinder
[56:35] when it comes to really receiving God's
[56:37] Gift of eternal life you say well I was
[56:40] raised differently I believed
[56:41] differently we all believed
[56:43] wrong amen amen we all believe something
[56:46] wrong but go and God had to correct us
[56:47] and change us and meet us and transform
[56:49] us irrespective of how we are raised or
[56:51] whatever right but you see there's
[56:53] something in us that says Lord I want
[56:55] your gift
[56:57] you've given it to me I want to open it
[56:59] and receive it and enjoy
[57:01] it
[57:03] amen praise the Lord you see the problem
[57:07] is when people get caught up in the in
[57:09] the rapping it's because of jealousy
[57:12] it's really people's attitude towards
[57:13] the rapping dictates where the people
[57:15] receive the gift of God's Gift of
[57:17] eternal life which is him it's really
[57:19] their attitude towards the rapping okay
[57:21] as we talked about the scribes and
[57:23] Pharisees their attitude was not right
[57:25] they did not like the rapping that it
[57:28] that it came in okay even the you know
[57:32] um he said you know they would say say
[57:36] to this man you know um we just go to
[57:40] verse verse 30 I mean verse 36 here then
[57:44] said they to him again what did he do uh
[57:47] what did he to thee how opened he Thine
[57:49] Eyes he answered them I have told you
[57:51] already and you did not hear wherefore
[57:53] will you hear it again will you also be
[57:55] his disciples then they reviled him and
[57:57] said Thou Art his disciple but we are
[57:59] moses' disciples I'd like to be uh
[58:02] accused of being jesus' disciples
[58:05] wouldn't you like that amen we know that
[58:07] God spake unto Moses as for this fellow
[58:09] we don't know from whence he is the man
[58:11] answered and said unto him why therein
[58:13] is a marvelous thing why why here in
[58:15] sorry is a marvelous thing that ye know
[58:18] not from whence he is and yet Heath open
[58:20] mine eyes now we know that God heareth
[58:22] not Sinners and if any man be a
[58:24] worshiper of God and doeth his will he
[58:26] that heareth God I mean see he he God
[58:29] heareth
[58:31] Amen so it's the attitude they had the
[58:34] wrong attitude towards towards how the
[58:36] gift was wrapped you know David if you
[58:40] know if we look through the scripture
[58:42] David King David was was was God's gift
[58:45] to Israel in his time remember God
[58:48] always sends a gift right it's Christ
[58:50] manifested in the age we live okay so
[58:53] God uh David was God's gift to Israel he
[58:56] was a king after God's Own Heart that
[58:58] sounds like a gift from God to me I mean
[59:00] but you see Paul uh sorry Saul's
[59:03] attitude he could not accept that gift
[59:06] into his kingdom because he had an
[59:09] attitude of jealousy and hatred and we
[59:11] know on multiple times he tried to kill
[59:14] David and he made him a fugitive because
[59:15] he wasn't willing to surrender himself
[59:18] and his position to allow God's gift to
[59:20] take over
[59:23] amen and it was the same thing with the
[59:25] scribes Pharisees they they uh they did
[59:29] the same thing they even knew when when
[59:30] Nicodemus who was a ruler of the Jews
[59:32] came to came to Jesus by night he said
[59:35] we know you're a teacher come from God
[59:37] for no man can do these Miracles that
[59:39] thou doest except God be with him so
[59:40] they saw the effects of the gift but you
[59:43] see they were jealous they politically
[59:44] minded so they weren't willing to
[59:46] surrender to the gift to let the Lord
[59:49] Jesus take over because you see now
[59:51] naturally when we receive a gift we
[59:53] control the gift you get a phone you
[59:56] control the phone you get a bike you
[59:57] control the bike you get whatever you
[59:59] control it right but this gift is sent
[1:00:01] to control you am mean you become a love
[1:00:04] prisoner to Jesus Christ this this gift
[1:00:06] takes over your life you don't take over
[1:00:07] it but you see the scribes and Pharisees
[1:00:10] just like Saul they had a jealous nature
[1:00:12] so they didn't want to you know allow
[1:00:14] allow um you know allow it to rule even
[1:00:19] pilate realized that because for Envy
[1:00:21] which is jealousy they delivered Jesus
[1:00:23] to be crucified they were jealous of
[1:00:25] this man because they studied the word
[1:00:27] but yet this man would come didn't have
[1:00:29] any learning didn't have any Bible
[1:00:31] school education but made the word live
[1:00:34] cuz he was the word hallelujah see and
[1:00:37] when when you receive the GI God's gift
[1:00:39] you become the word go because the word
[1:00:41] comes and dwells in you amen amen see
[1:00:45] they were so concerned but you see this
[1:00:46] is what jealousy does jealousy causes
[1:00:48] you know it causes people to do crazy
[1:00:50] things to maintain a status quo just for
[1:00:53] a person or position or a party and this
[1:00:56] is what even the scribes and Pharisees
[1:00:58] they were jealous of Jesus but they were
[1:00:59] afraid that they would that that the
[1:01:01] Romans would come if people believed on
[1:01:03] him and take away both their place and
[1:01:05] nation and yet this gift of God they
[1:01:07] wanted to get rid of was the very thing
[1:01:10] they were looking for isn't that an
[1:01:12] amazing thing the very thing people look
[1:01:14] for people want to get rid of because of
[1:01:16] jealousy they want to keep the status
[1:01:18] quo this is how things have always been
[1:01:20] this is my position in the church this
[1:01:22] is how people think of me this is what
[1:01:24] my family thinks of me this is what my
[1:01:25] work Place thinks of me but what about
[1:01:27] receiving the gift God's Gift of eternal
[1:01:29] life I'd rather think of what God thinks
[1:01:32] of me more than what man thinks of me
[1:01:34] glory amen the Lord amen even even Jesus
[1:01:38] would say and this is the will of him
[1:01:40] that sent me that everyone that seeth
[1:01:42] the son and believeth on him may have
[1:01:44] everlasting life and I'll raise him up
[1:01:47] at the last day so you see this gift
[1:01:49] that see see God's gift we can see see
[1:01:53] he doesn't see he has seen but seeth
[1:01:56] tense am you say well where is where is
[1:01:58] Jesus with the nail scarred hands we
[1:02:00] don't see him in that form but we see
[1:02:02] him as his word right because remember
[1:02:05] the word in every age is
[1:02:07] Messiah amen so God's God's purpose or
[1:02:11] desire is that this is God's will that
[1:02:13] everyone would see the son which is the
[1:02:15] word and Believe on him that he that
[1:02:17] that may that they may have everlasting
[1:02:19] life that God will raise him up in the
[1:02:21] last day amen you say well this is so
[1:02:24] how we see him we see the Lord we see
[1:02:26] him as his word because he is his word
[1:02:29] we see him living in our day amen amen
[1:02:32] we see you know when we look in the
[1:02:34] mirror you should be able to see the
[1:02:36] Fulfillment of Malachi 4:5 God has
[1:02:39] literally turned my heart back to the
[1:02:40] faith of the fathers God has literally
[1:02:42] turned me back to believe I believe the
[1:02:44] whole Bible right you should literally
[1:02:46] be able to see Among Us Luke 17:30 the
[1:02:49] son of man being revealed brother Ram
[1:02:51] says that the son of man Jesus Christ is
[1:02:53] revealed in human beings amen not not
[1:02:55] just in a one man Ministry you say that
[1:02:57] was the prophet it was but that Ministry
[1:03:00] of the son of man continues on Amen so
[1:03:02] we should be able to see Jesus Christ in
[1:03:04] one another amen amen this is this is if
[1:03:07] you received God's Gift right we should
[1:03:10] see the word of God being a discerner of
[1:03:12] the thoughts and tense of the heart and
[1:03:14] how often do we see that irrespective of
[1:03:16] who stands behind this Pulpit God's word
[1:03:18] speaking to people addressing
[1:03:20] conversations all these things what is
[1:03:21] it that's the word of God Discerning the
[1:03:23] thoughts and Tents of the heart we see
[1:03:25] these things yeah amen we see he is the
[1:03:28] same yesterday today and forever amen
[1:03:30] Hebrews
[1:03:32] 13:8 praise the Lord but you see so as
[1:03:35] many as received him gave you power to
[1:03:38] become the sons of God so this gift has
[1:03:40] power in it now I may be jumping back
[1:03:42] and forth a bit with this but you see
[1:03:44] see this gift is more than just yes I
[1:03:47] acknowledge Jesus but what's the effect
[1:03:49] of it in your life oh yes I believe God
[1:03:52] sent a prophet but what but what's the
[1:03:53] effect in your life should be a
[1:03:54] transforming power and I believe it is
[1:03:57] amen I believe I see it amen amen praise
[1:04:01] the Lord
[1:04:02] am amen
[1:04:04] now every gift is going to be opened by
[1:04:08] somebody right if I gave you a gift I
[1:04:12] would think you would open it yep I mean
[1:04:15] it's pretty normal what you think but
[1:04:17] there's after Christmas there's a lot of
[1:04:19] regifted gifts there's a lot of regifted
[1:04:22] gifts I think trade me and and Facebook
[1:04:24] Marketplace and whatever you know I
[1:04:26] think it becomes flooded with gifts that
[1:04:28] people don't want but it'll eventually
[1:04:31] get to someone that wants it that will
[1:04:33] receive it right and it's the same thing
[1:04:36] with our Lord you see cuz he came to his
[1:04:38] own but his own received him not so what
[1:04:41] happened I could say he got regifted now
[1:04:43] God knew who would receive him right he
[1:04:46] knew he knew the Jews would turn him
[1:04:48] down because they had to because
[1:04:49] remember when um Jacob was blessing the
[1:04:51] sons of Joseph Jacob's hands were
[1:04:53] crossed right so the blessing that
[1:04:55] should have gone to the older went to
[1:04:57] the younger so through the cross the
[1:04:58] blessings the Jews should have received
[1:05:00] came on you and I so we're the full
[1:05:02] beneficiaries of God's Gift Hallelujah
[1:05:05] so so so the Lord knew the Jews would
[1:05:07] turn him down because he knew he was
[1:05:09] going to take a gentile bride so he knew
[1:05:11] exactly who would receive this gift
[1:05:14] remember it's for everyone but he knows
[1:05:16] who's going to receive it he the Lord is
[1:05:18] not going to be surprised when you sit
[1:05:20] down at the wedding supper
[1:05:22] table he's not going to be shocked oh I
[1:05:24] didn't expect you here no I've been
[1:05:26] waiting for you I've been looking for
[1:05:28] you I've been I've been excited to see
[1:05:30] you come amen so you see things get
[1:05:34] regifted and eternal life has been
[1:05:38] regifted but it will eventually come to
[1:05:41] somebody and it did Hallelujah here we
[1:05:44] are amen you see it's like Jesus would
[1:05:46] give the parable of the invitation to
[1:05:48] the wedding suffer um suffer supper to
[1:05:51] his um you a king made a made a feast
[1:05:53] for his son sent out the invitation you
[1:05:56] know some said I've got a you know I
[1:05:58] bought some land I've got to go see it I
[1:06:00] bought some oxen or I married a wife
[1:06:02] they made excuses what they do they
[1:06:03] basically regifted their seat to someone
[1:06:06] else then he went to the highways Hedges
[1:06:09] wherever and you know people and they
[1:06:11] said basically um the king commanded his
[1:06:13] servants compel people to come someone's
[1:06:16] going to receive the gift amen and and
[1:06:19] praise God we're we were in the hges and
[1:06:21] the highways and the you know the
[1:06:22] unthought of places God God because God
[1:06:25] knew that you would receive his gift
[1:06:27] amen hallelujah praise the Lord amen
[1:06:31] now those who those who
[1:06:34] receive uh the gift partially well
[1:06:39] actually let's just let's just remember
[1:06:42] as I said before this gift takes over us
[1:06:46] right it rules us okay we don't rule it
[1:06:50] amen but people who only receive parts
[1:06:52] of God's gift or actually want to rule
[1:06:55] it never ever get the full benefit of it
[1:06:58] okay so King Saul received parts of
[1:07:00] God's Gift David he and and and and he
[1:07:03] only received the parts of David that
[1:07:05] suited his own ends so he needed a giant
[1:07:09] killer God sent him David amen that was
[1:07:12] a part of God's Gift remember he was ano
[1:07:14] David was anointed king but Saul used
[1:07:17] him as a as a giant killer as a man to
[1:07:20] fight his battles as a worshipper to
[1:07:23] drive that evil spirit out of his life
[1:07:25] out of Saul's life so he used he used
[1:07:27] parts of parts of David but he did not
[1:07:30] receive the full benefits of having
[1:07:31] David in his kingdom as being his King I
[1:07:34] mean Simon the Pharisee invited invited
[1:07:37] the Lord Jesus to his Feast not to be
[1:07:39] have the head head head place at the
[1:07:41] feast but to make him a spectacle and
[1:07:43] leave him in the corner with unwashed
[1:07:45] feet amen the Roman soldiers received
[1:07:47] him just to Mock and crucify him amen
[1:07:50] see some receive him just to debate
[1:07:52] about him argue about him and tell them
[1:07:54] how much they don't believe in him
[1:07:57] remember he's the word that's what
[1:07:58] people do amen so sadly they ain't
[1:08:01] receiving God's wrapped gift in the way
[1:08:02] it should be received you see you know
[1:08:06] uh balum balum would would would use
[1:08:09] God's gift just for a money-making
[1:08:11] scheme now I'm not talking about any of
[1:08:13] us but I just want you to see we want to
[1:08:15] receive the full benefits of God's Gift
[1:08:17] okay so balum would use the gift of God
[1:08:19] in his life for a money-making scheme he
[1:08:21] had a genuine prophetic gift he was a
[1:08:23] prophet he knew the wrer to God in terms
[1:08:26] of sacrifice but he only did it to make
[1:08:28] money as ailing prophet and sadly
[1:08:31] believers who enter the ministry or
[1:08:33] follow the lord for only for material
[1:08:35] gain are sadly in the same bracket as
[1:08:37] balum some people become Believers well
[1:08:40] God you said if I follow you I'll get
[1:08:41] this or I'll become wealthy I'll get
[1:08:43] rich or I'll have a great family
[1:08:45] whatever more we don't follow God
[1:08:47] because of that we don't let this gift
[1:08:48] take over our lives because of something
[1:08:50] we can get out of it amen we're just
[1:08:52] happy we receed the gift God never
[1:08:55] promised promised us a flowery bed of
[1:08:56] East he never promised us an easy road
[1:08:59] but the road's worth it because of
[1:09:01] what's at the end of the road amen and
[1:09:03] he's on the road with you amen
[1:09:06] hallelujah so but you see Moses on the
[1:09:09] other hand isn't it amazing you know
[1:09:11] balam balam got bought out for the for
[1:09:13] for some riches from Moab but yet Moses
[1:09:17] because he really saw God's Gift he he
[1:09:20] esteemed the reproach of Christ greater
[1:09:22] riches than the treasures of Egypt so he
[1:09:25] had he had the whole bank account of the
[1:09:26] superpower of the
[1:09:28] age but he esteemed following Christ
[1:09:31] greater riches than that but yeah balum
[1:09:33] for a room full of silver sold out how
[1:09:36] many how many you know balum got sold
[1:09:39] out for just a small portion of what
[1:09:42] Moses could have had aren't you glad
[1:09:45] that that the Lord allowed us to weigh
[1:09:47] up whatever in the world Amen and and
[1:09:50] and it far was far outweighed by this
[1:09:53] gift of eternal life
[1:09:56] Judas only followed Jesus because he
[1:09:58] cared about the
[1:09:59] money he was a
[1:10:01] thief so so people will follow the lord
[1:10:04] for their own selfish
[1:10:07] gain some only followed for the Loaves
[1:10:09] and
[1:10:11] Fishes some people just like a free meal
[1:10:14] I like a free meal too food's good but
[1:10:16] you see I'll be honest I like food but
[1:10:18] you see that's not what that's not why
[1:10:20] we're
[1:10:21] Christians I mean we are not we are not
[1:10:23] message Believers because of a a free
[1:10:25] meal but you see it's amazing they
[1:10:27] followed him onto the other side of the
[1:10:29] sea just for another free meal they went
[1:10:30] a long way they were really serious in
[1:10:32] this getting a free meal but you see
[1:10:34] Jesus said you you did not come here
[1:10:36] because you saw the Miracles but because
[1:10:38] you ate the Loaves and the fishes so
[1:10:40] they had their own bellies as their
[1:10:43] interest for following so as I say sadly
[1:10:47] they were missing God's gift they got
[1:10:50] some benefits from it cuz everyone does
[1:10:52] you come into the presence of God you'll
[1:10:53] be benefited but but don't just let it
[1:10:56] be an external blessing let it come on
[1:10:58] on the inside of the inside I mean let
[1:11:01] it change you let it awaken your soul I
[1:11:03] mean let it live through you amen not
[1:11:05] just be an external blessing you know
[1:11:07] people will come to church cuz the
[1:11:08] people are nice and
[1:11:10] friendly or the worship is great or the
[1:11:12] atmosphere is amazing you know we had
[1:11:14] remember when we first started Church
[1:11:16] you know we had we had um was it um
[1:11:19] sister bronn's stepmom or potential
[1:11:22] stepmom at that time came to church and
[1:11:24] she said you know
[1:11:25] um she was from Sydney and she said you
[1:11:27] know we you know she's been in Hillsong
[1:11:29] she's been in the great big what what
[1:11:31] the world will call great big worship
[1:11:33] and there we were in this little place
[1:11:34] with a dripping ceiling and moldy it was
[1:11:37] a scary place it was it was you know it
[1:11:40] was the opposite of Hillsong the very
[1:11:41] polar opposite One keyboard and a guitar
[1:11:44] and she said I've never been in this
[1:11:45] kind of a presence before of the
[1:11:48] Lord you know people say they feel the
[1:11:50] love of God in the church the
[1:11:51] fellowship's great all those things are
[1:11:53] fine but there just benefits of being
[1:11:55] around the
[1:11:56] wrapping amen we should be like we
[1:11:59] should be like Simon Peter to whom to
[1:12:01] whom shall we go for thou alone has the
[1:12:03] words of eternal life me and we know and
[1:12:06] we believe that thou art the Christ the
[1:12:07] son of the Living God I mean when you
[1:12:09] can see that this message is more than
[1:12:11] just the wrapping of God into a prophet
[1:12:13] but eternal life being revealed amen you
[1:12:15] say to whom shall we go there's nowhere
[1:12:18] else to go Lord because you've revealed
[1:12:19] yourself through this word amen amen
[1:12:23] hallelujah amen I'll tell you Simon
[1:12:25] Peter went through a rugged road but he
[1:12:27] got God's Gift that's right he he got to
[1:12:29] a place where he allowed God's gift to
[1:12:31] take control of his life hallelujah
[1:12:33] praise the Lord hallelujah but I'm so
[1:12:35] thankful that there's some that really
[1:12:37] really did receive God's Gift amen you
[1:12:40] look at you look at David's Mighty
[1:12:43] Men David's Mighty Men knew David was
[1:12:46] coming into Power David's Mighty Men
[1:12:48] knew he was anointed they look Beyond
[1:12:50] the Veil of a even like David's older
[1:12:53] brother would say to him when David came
[1:12:54] to the battle against Goliath you're
[1:12:56] just a naughty boy they could look
[1:12:58] Beyond now we know by this stage he was
[1:13:00] older than this he was a man he was
[1:13:02] mature but yet they could look Beyond
[1:13:04] the Veil of a fugitive of a of a man who
[1:13:08] is on the Run hated by his own King they
[1:13:10] could look beyond that wrapping and they
[1:13:12] could see this is God's anointed gift
[1:13:14] for my age and they gathered themselves
[1:13:17] to David and isn't it amazing you know
[1:13:19] they came discontented in debt and
[1:13:21] distressed but they didn't stay that way
[1:13:25] you you allow God's gift to take over
[1:13:27] your life and there'll be times of
[1:13:29] distress and discontent and debt but you
[1:13:31] won't stay that way amen God will
[1:13:34] transform you because remember they did
[1:13:36] not they did not start off as mighty men
[1:13:38] they came in this condition but because
[1:13:40] they could look beyond the wrapping and
[1:13:42] see God's Gift the anointing in the gift
[1:13:44] came upon them and they did Mighty
[1:13:47] exploits of Faith doing incredible Feats
[1:13:50] amen slaying many hundreds of enemies by
[1:13:53] themselves doing incredible things
[1:13:54] because the anointing in God's gift came
[1:13:57] into them and they became like the gift
[1:14:02] Hallelujah is it amazing you can look
[1:14:04] back in your life and you can see I'm
[1:14:05] becoming more like the Bible all the
[1:14:07] time can you see that in your life I
[1:14:09] trust you can you can see God you you're
[1:14:12] you're allowing me to trust you more
[1:14:14] depend upon you more rejoice in you more
[1:14:17] have more confidence in your word than
[1:14:19] ever before who's had that kind of a
[1:14:21] thing you look back and before you're
[1:14:23] like this but now you're more hey the
[1:14:25] trials are harder but there's a greater
[1:14:27] stability you think about the things
[1:14:29] that have come against you even recently
[1:14:31] if they came against you when you first
[1:14:32] met the Lord you would have been over
[1:14:34] right but God's God's allowed you to be
[1:14:36] shaken as you've gone along the roots
[1:14:37] have gone down into Christ more
[1:14:39] intertwined more deeper deeper deeper
[1:14:42] and now you can draw more water up you
[1:14:43] can draw more of his presence and his
[1:14:46] word up and you can have a greater
[1:14:47] confidence God I don't understand but I
[1:14:50] know you know the way amen because you
[1:14:53] are God's gift to me and I have full
[1:14:56] confidence though my mind says
[1:14:58] everything's going wrong my heart says
[1:14:59] something but your word says this is
[1:15:01] true and you're all right and I can
[1:15:03] trust in you I'm I'm Anchored In Your
[1:15:05] Word in spite of what's going on in here
[1:15:07] something in here says I've got a hold
[1:15:09] of you Hallelujah cuz you got think
[1:15:12] about a tree in a storm really you say
[1:15:14] well the roots are holding the Rock and
[1:15:16] the soil actually really the soil's
[1:15:17] holding on to the tree that's how I
[1:15:20] think about it
[1:15:21] anyway amen because the tree can have
[1:15:23] all the roots at once but it's got no
[1:15:25] soul to be and it's going to go down the
[1:15:27] hill
[1:15:30] amen praise the Lord see
[1:15:34] God's God's gift will always find a
[1:15:38] place some
[1:15:41] people it will it will search until
[1:15:43] there's somewhere to settle as I said
[1:15:47] regifting right but God has in his mind
[1:15:50] where it's going to end up even even
[1:15:52] when Joseph and Mary would come and they
[1:15:55] go to Bethlehem he was born in a manger
[1:15:57] cuz there's no room in the
[1:15:58] end here comes God's Gift into Bethlehem
[1:16:02] and and sadly well I guess he had to be
[1:16:04] born in a manger but you know imagine
[1:16:05] the opportunity if you really if you
[1:16:07] were that inkeeper sure you're stressed
[1:16:09] you got lots of guest is there's the
[1:16:10] there's meals and there's things you got
[1:16:12] to look after and all those things but
[1:16:14] Here Comes Here Comes Here Comes Mary
[1:16:17] and Joseph and Jesus Emmanuel is about
[1:16:20] to be born I think you'd make some room
[1:16:23] when you're in I think you'd upset some
[1:16:25] people to make them welcome now we know
[1:16:28] he had to be born in a manger but just
[1:16:29] for argument sake I think if really if
[1:16:31] you could look if they could have looked
[1:16:33] beyond uh Mary and Joseph and what they
[1:16:36] could see and see God's gift they would
[1:16:37] have made
[1:16:38] room and then even Jesus would say to
[1:16:41] the scribes and Pharisees he says you
[1:16:42] seek to kill me because my word has no
[1:16:44] place in you aren't you glad there's
[1:16:47] room in you for for his word hallelujah
[1:16:50] aren't you thankful for that amen that's
[1:16:53] why we love him because he's room in our
[1:16:54] hearts for his
[1:16:55] work amen there's a place where he can
[1:16:58] rest
[1:17:01] hallelujah
[1:17:02] amen now so I'm just trying to keep here
[1:17:06] with my notes a
[1:17:12] bit that's why it's so important we make
[1:17:14] room brother BR says what we need today
[1:17:16] is a fresh outpouring of the Holy Spirit
[1:17:18] upon Hearts that's humble we need a we
[1:17:20] need a real Christmas a birthplace if
[1:17:22] you could just realize you're nothing
[1:17:24] but a stable
[1:17:26] I'm nothing but a stable I mean God
[1:17:28] didn't go to Jerusalem or to Shiloh to
[1:17:29] ramoth Gilead he came to a stable that
[1:17:31] was polluted when you let God when you
[1:17:34] when you realize in yourself you're
[1:17:35] nothing but a stinking stable but
[1:17:37] welcome open your doors when these great
[1:17:39] big places and ends are turning him away
[1:17:41] open your doors of the manger of your
[1:17:43] heart and let Jehovah come in to that
[1:17:46] and watch what takes place for he is the
[1:17:48] word he said if you abide in me and I in
[1:17:50] you ask what you will I mean yeah let
[1:17:53] them come into you and watch what takes
[1:17:55] place then ask what you will and it'll
[1:17:57] be done for you now we know with gifts
[1:18:01] gifts have to be
[1:18:03] opened right there's not one gift really
[1:18:06] you you know when I was a child it
[1:18:08] didn't take long for that rapping to get
[1:18:11] off right cuz I wanted that gift my name
[1:18:14] was on it I wanted that gift gifts have
[1:18:16] to be
[1:18:17] open in order to release the gift
[1:18:20] inside now God's gift to us was open
[1:18:24] that down
[1:18:25] Calvary he was M more than any other man
[1:18:28] you think about rapping no I why I felt
[1:18:31] bad even last night trying to put this
[1:18:32] together thinking how can I Lord equate
[1:18:33] you just to
[1:18:35] rapping god with us Emmanuel amen but
[1:18:38] you see he was torn apart he was M more
[1:18:40] than any other man his boat uh his bones
[1:18:43] were all out of joint they pierced his
[1:18:45] side and his feet and his hands and you
[1:18:48] know all these things but you see God
[1:18:51] God allowed his gift to be opened hey
[1:18:54] Amen in order to release the gift inside
[1:18:58] and it came at great price but yet the
[1:19:01] but yet in that great moment amen the
[1:19:03] wrath of God was satisfied the Judgment
[1:19:05] of God that we should have received went
[1:19:07] upon God's Gift amen
[1:19:10] hallelujah amen the penalty for sin was
[1:19:12] paid that day amen so you and I can
[1:19:16] Embrace and receive and enjoy God's
[1:19:18] great gift of eternal
[1:19:20] life amen amen I tell you friends if
[1:19:23] youve really if you've really received
[1:19:25] that gift of eternal life your life will
[1:19:28] never be the same amen you'll become
[1:19:30] more than a religious person you'll
[1:19:32] become more than a person with a kind of
[1:19:34] an alternative lifestyle amen but it
[1:19:37] will transform your life amen like even
[1:19:40] with Solomon Solomon's age in the Bible
[1:19:42] because Solomon was a gift of God to to
[1:19:45] Israel at the time and they had a
[1:19:48] millennium because they rallied around
[1:19:50] that gift they rallied around God's Gift
[1:19:53] God God gave Solomon that Mighty gift of
[1:19:55] discernment and they rallied around it
[1:19:58] they had peace all around them am mean
[1:20:00] they had a they had it was a golden age
[1:20:02] for Israel because they rallied around
[1:20:03] that gift and brother bam says now what
[1:20:06] if we what if we now get because we know
[1:20:09] the gift the gift of God in this day is
[1:20:11] the Holy Ghost right what if we really
[1:20:15] rallied around it amen because this gift
[1:20:18] has come open amen the gift was open
[1:20:21] 2,000 years ago that we can look in and
[1:20:24] receive and partake and embrace this
[1:20:26] gift of eternal life now so what if we
[1:20:28] really embraced Embrace this gift of
[1:20:31] eternal life what if we really rallied
[1:20:33] around the Holy Ghost now I'm I'm not
[1:20:35] saying you're not but think about the
[1:20:37] power and what could happen if we really
[1:20:40] laid aside everything and embraced God's
[1:20:42] great gift to us am mean well we didn't
[1:20:45] just rally around what people did
[1:20:46] Generations ago of church splits and and
[1:20:49] doctrines and fussing and fighting and
[1:20:51] things of the past what if we just let
[1:20:53] that all go and just press to the mark
[1:20:54] of the High Calling of Christ I mean
[1:20:57] what if we what if we laid aside maybe
[1:20:59] the Troubles of this past year didn't
[1:21:01] rally around those memories those
[1:21:03] negative things and rallied around God's
[1:21:06] Gift of eternal life what if we laid
[1:21:08] aside hurt instead of rallying around
[1:21:11] hurt we red around God's Gift of eternal
[1:21:14] life what could really happen in our
[1:21:16] midst in our individual lives if we said
[1:21:18] Lord forgetting the things in the past
[1:21:21] see the Apostle Paul knew forget the
[1:21:23] things in the past
[1:21:26] leave them leave them
[1:21:27] there but rally around rally around the
[1:21:31] gift of eternal life you see this gift
[1:21:34] is God's quickening power it's more than
[1:21:37] an argument it's more than it's more
[1:21:39] than fussing or fighting or arguing
[1:21:42] about certain things you see when people
[1:21:44] receive gifts gifts change people amen
[1:21:47] you give a child a scooter for the first
[1:21:49] time or a bike for the first time
[1:21:51] they'll be doing things they never did
[1:21:53] before they receive that gift they'll be
[1:21:55] going places and they'll be going at
[1:21:57] speeds and they'll be getting injuries
[1:22:00] that they never could get without that
[1:22:02] gift amen amen because the gift changes
[1:22:06] them amen they begin to be adapted to
[1:22:09] the gift that they have received now how
[1:22:11] about now that's just a kid receiving a
[1:22:13] bike or a scooter How much more when
[1:22:15] eternal life comes in amen should that
[1:22:18] not change the places we go the things
[1:22:21] we do amen the things we talk about amen
[1:22:24] a kid without a scooter can't talk about
[1:22:26] scootering can't talk about trying to do
[1:22:28] tricks or you someone with a bike you
[1:22:30] can't talk about those things if you
[1:22:31] don't have the gift but when they have
[1:22:33] the gift the whole vocabulary changes am
[1:22:36] mean about what they can do and what
[1:22:37] they want to do and what the thing can
[1:22:39] do am mean now how about you and I
[1:22:40] friends when we receive the Holy Ghost
[1:22:42] amen this message of the hour the God's
[1:22:44] Gift of this day messiah in our manger
[1:22:47] of our hearts amen we will go places we
[1:22:50] never used to go we will do things we
[1:22:52] never used to do amen we will stop doing
[1:22:54] things we used to do like a kid with a
[1:22:57] bike who's going to walk that kid ain't
[1:22:59] going to walk hey I got a bike I biked I
[1:23:02] bike to school I don't walk anymore I
[1:23:04] Bike to School amen right so we'll
[1:23:06] travel in ways we never used to travel
[1:23:08] why because the gift has changed us
[1:23:11] hallelujah amen and so should should
[1:23:14] that not be with us this morning that
[1:23:16] God's Gift of eternal life that we have
[1:23:18] received and I pray if you haven't
[1:23:20] received it you will receive it that you
[1:23:22] look beyond the religion look beyond the
[1:23:23] wrapping amen amen but you'll be able to
[1:23:26] embrace you'll Embrace Jesus Christ the
[1:23:28] word and it will change you you'll think
[1:23:30] differently amen you'll act differently
[1:23:32] you'll speak differently you will your
[1:23:34] attitude will be different why because
[1:23:36] you've received the gift of eternal life
[1:23:40] am mean the Apostle Paul when he
[1:23:41] received God's WRA gift isn't it amazing
[1:23:44] the Apostle Paul wasn't looking for it
[1:23:47] he was trying to destroy it he was
[1:23:50] trying to rub out this he was trying to
[1:23:52] get rid of God's Gift of eternal life
[1:23:54] that's what he was was trying to do when
[1:23:55] he was persecuting the church but you
[1:23:57] see God's gift we don't go looking for
[1:23:59] it it comes looking for you amen so even
[1:24:02] this morning God's gift is looking for
[1:24:04] some people today amen maybe just even
[1:24:06] out on the streaming God's Gift of
[1:24:08] eternal life is looking for people I
[1:24:10] mean see God comes searching for us and
[1:24:12] when the Apostle Paul met the Lord on
[1:24:14] the road to Damascus he found a new way
[1:24:17] of life that completely changed what he
[1:24:19] knew and thought and did I mean the
[1:24:21] people he once hated he embraced
[1:24:25] hallelujah amen he used to drag them off
[1:24:27] into prison have such a burning hatred
[1:24:29] I'm going to destroy these people
[1:24:30] they're horrible people but then after
[1:24:32] the road to Damascus he I love these
[1:24:34] people I want to be around these people
[1:24:36] I'm identified with these people they
[1:24:38] are my people once the scribes and
[1:24:40] Pharisees were mine now these people are
[1:24:42] mine Hallelujah the places he hated
[1:24:45] became the places he loved I mean he
[1:24:48] hated the places Christians gathered he
[1:24:50] wanted to shut those places down but
[1:24:52] then after he received God's gift of
[1:24:54] eternal life right say after God's Gift
[1:24:56] of eternal life embraced him and changed
[1:24:59] him those places he hated became the
[1:25:01] places he loved amen the name he hated
[1:25:05] became the name he loved amen and he
[1:25:07] loved that name so much after he
[1:25:09] received that gift of Return of life he
[1:25:11] said it's a name above all names
[1:25:14] hallelujah amen I trust that's how you
[1:25:16] feel about him you see the the the name
[1:25:19] of Jesus Christ is more than just a
[1:25:21] debate point or a name of God or a nice
[1:25:25] idea it is the name above all names you
[1:25:28] see when you receive this name you when
[1:25:30] you receive the gift of eternal life you
[1:25:32] will realize it is the name above all
[1:25:34] names hallelujah amen his life all he
[1:25:38] did was completely different because why
[1:25:41] he received God's Gift of eternal life
[1:25:45] amen when the when
[1:25:47] the when the people of God were in the
[1:25:51] upper
[1:25:52] room they gathered they gathered no wait
[1:25:55] let's just go to this and maybe I'll
[1:25:57] leave that one there but you see now
[1:26:00] people who people who receed God's gift
[1:26:02] it changes our nature it changes our
[1:26:04] Outlook I'm just going to close with
[1:26:05] this thought see it matures us we go
[1:26:08] from glory to glory like David's Mighty
[1:26:10] Men they started off in debt and
[1:26:12] discontent and all these things but but
[1:26:15] but David after he became King on the
[1:26:17] throne he gave them leadership over
[1:26:20] cities you see this is when they Embrace
[1:26:23] God's Gift of etern life in their day I
[1:26:26] mean God placed them David placed them
[1:26:28] as kings over cities rulers over cities
[1:26:30] in Israel and it shows that when you
[1:26:32] really Embrace God's Gift of eternal
[1:26:34] life it's not just for now actually this
[1:26:37] is just training ground this is just a
[1:26:39] small thing but God is giving us
[1:26:42] character through you know as a victory
[1:26:44] not as a gift but as a victory through
[1:26:46] troubles and circumstances that when
[1:26:48] we're transported over to the other side
[1:26:49] of the into the Millennium what God
[1:26:52] gives us Dominion because we're going to
[1:26:53] rule and reign with
[1:26:56] Christ
[1:26:58] hallelujah amen I'm just going to
[1:27:02] abruptly stop right there but I want to
[1:27:03] ask you the question have you really
[1:27:06] received this God's Gift of eternal life
[1:27:08] or have you just received a Doctrine
[1:27:11] have you just received an argument or
[1:27:13] you know you just a religious person or
[1:27:15] have you really received him has he
[1:27:18] changed you like he did the Apostle Paul
[1:27:21] you you love him more than anything see
[1:27:23] when when you receive this God's Gift of
[1:27:26] eternal life it's like the pearl of
[1:27:27] great price it is the pearl of great
[1:27:28] price you're willing to sell everything
[1:27:30] that you just Embrace that Pearl and it
[1:27:33] changes your nature it changes your
[1:27:35] outlook it changes your attitude it
[1:27:38] changes your thoughts towards people it
[1:27:40] changes how you treat people how you
[1:27:42] treat yourself the things you do it
[1:27:44] changes every part of your life amen
[1:27:48] amen I trust it's done that for you
[1:27:50] today has he been born in the manger of
[1:27:53] your heart this is what Christmas is all
[1:27:55] about the world is doing what it's doing
[1:27:57] but maybe we have a different kind of a
[1:27:59] Christmas Even just in our hearts when
[1:28:00] we give gifts to one another give gifts
[1:28:02] to our family even family that don't
[1:28:04] even know the Lord maybe be like Lord
[1:28:06] when we place this gift in their hands
[1:28:09] may you somehow by your Supernatural
[1:28:11] presence may they see nail scars may
[1:28:14] they see eternal life wants to be given
[1:28:16] cuz really think about it when you
[1:28:17] gather around the table even when we
[1:28:18] come to church what's our heart's desire
[1:28:20] Lord he part eternal life Lord give your
[1:28:23] gift Lord may they may they have an open
[1:28:25] heart to receive your gift of eternal
[1:28:27] life Lord and when we go see our family
[1:28:30] go see work colleagues what is really
[1:28:31] our heart of hearts if we could give
[1:28:34] anything to anyone what would it be it
[1:28:36] would be
[1:28:38] him so may we this this Christmas season
[1:28:41] when we see family don't get caught up
[1:28:43] in the stresses and family politics and
[1:28:46] all the hurry and all the scurry and all
[1:28:48] those things going on May we not be
[1:28:50] caught up in that may we be caught up in
[1:28:53] Lord you know know my desire I want to
[1:28:56] give that person you Lord change their
[1:28:59] heart Lord that they will have room
