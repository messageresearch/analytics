[4:52] good
[4:54] morning welcome to the house of God um
[4:56] this
[4:57] morning it's good to be here it's good
[4:59] to be uh warm and
[5:05] dry if I
[5:09] um I think apart from the example of
[5:12] the flood I think rain is always a sign
[5:16] of God's
[5:17] blessing you know Elijah he said it
[5:20] won't rain there' be no rain in the land
[5:22] till I call for it and when there was no
[5:26] rain there was there were big troubles
[5:27] in the
[5:28] land but maybe the first year they were
[5:31] okay cuz they had supplies of different
[5:32] things and they had Wells that they
[5:34] could draw water from and they still had
[5:36] the streams that flowed from the snow
[5:39] that was
[5:40] melting in the spring and the summer but
[5:42] you know as the drought went on year
[5:44] after year the second year got a little
[5:45] bit harder it was less less water in the
[5:48] reservoirs there were there were there
[5:50] was less rain uh less water in the
[5:54] creeks and in the
[5:55] rivers you know and and life got harder
[5:58] and harder you know and by the third
[5:59] year it was getting really hard cuz they
[6:01] couldn't now grow the C the crops they
[6:03] needed and things you know and it's the
[6:05] same in a and and anyone that that you
[6:07] know you know when when people live
[6:09] their life without the spirit of God you
[6:11] know it just gets drier and drier and
[6:13] dryer till it's
[6:14] not possible to live anymore under that
[6:17] condition but we're grateful today that
[6:19] like the rain that's falling on us now
[6:21] the we're living in a time of Latter
[6:24] rain and and and the spirit of God is
[6:26] falling upon us and it's going to
[6:28] continue to fall Upon Our Hearts and and
[6:32] make our land the land of our life make
[6:35] it
[6:36] fruitful you know even though there may
[6:38] be a drought all around we've got our
[6:41] our we're planted by the rivers of
[6:42] Living Water you know we we've got the
[6:45] we're we're refreshed daily by the
[6:47] spirit of God so that's that's going to
[6:49] be our portion this morning we're going
[6:52] to be refreshed this morning there's
[6:54] going to be we're going to be like uh
[6:55] we're not going to be like dry sticklers
[6:58] who's been to Tucson ARS
[7:00] owner I went there uh Shannon's from
[7:03] there so we went there to visit her
[7:04] family and um back then I was a young
[7:07] fellow I thought I was a real Bush man
[7:09] so I used to go into the
[7:11] desert
[7:12] and and live off the
[7:16] land so I decided to eat what they call
[7:18] a prickly pear cactus you know that one
[7:22] cuz I eat those you know so me being a
[7:25] Bushman I thought man I'm going to try
[7:26] one of these things so I got this little
[7:28] prickly pear managed to pull one off of
[7:31] this cactus plant they grow these little
[7:34] these little fruits and you could break
[7:36] it open and eat the fruit eat from the
[7:40] inside but these things I didn't know
[7:42] this once I ate it man I had all these
[7:44] tiny little prickles all through my
[7:47] mouth come to find out you know the
[7:49] ancient Indians sift the thing first cuz
[7:51] there's so many tiny little prickles in
[7:52] it they sift it before they eat it I
[7:54] just got straight into it man but it's a
[7:57] it's it's everything there is just and
[8:00] it's
[8:01] it's sticks at you and Spears you
[8:03] everywhere you turn everything you stand
[8:06] on is going to pierce
[8:08] you but you know when it starts to rain
[8:11] if that place ever got rain everything
[8:12] would go soft again all those all those
[8:14] little sharp things would go soft you
[8:16] know so let's all just that's what we
[8:18] want to be like just soft you know you
[8:20] you're you're refreshed by the spirit of
[8:22] God and we we're just nice soft and

[21:34] morning we have two specials we've got
[21:36] we're going to start with uh Sister
[21:39] Louise and then um Stephanie and
[21:47] Co I just wanted to First give a
[21:49] testimony um as you know you've been
[21:53] praying for me because I've been sick I
[21:54] hadn't been to a doctor for about 3 or 4
[21:56] years so I finally ended up going to the
[21:59] doctor and they took blood tests and
[22:03] various things um but it wasn't until
[22:06] afterwards at the time they said
[22:08] something about testing my thyroid and
[22:11] at the time I thought oh that'll be
[22:12] interesting because about probably 20 or
[22:14] 25 years ago um Joe Hansen came and
[22:19] stayed with me um at the time she was
[22:21] Joe M too um and she noticed that I had
[22:24] a sort of lump on my throat and thought
[22:27] it was thyroid and being a nurse she
[22:29] kind of knew his stuff so anyway I got
[22:31] it checked out and sure enough I had a
[22:34] you know a bit of a thyroid problem so
[22:37] at the time they put me on a waiting
[22:39] list I'm still waiting um
[22:43] and we prayed about it and over time it
[22:47] it went it was one of those things that
[22:48] you kind of it just happened really
[22:50] gradually and then so one day notic oh
[22:51] it's gone so when they said they were
[22:53] testing my thyroid the thought was
[22:56] that'll be interesting anyway I just
[22:57] want to give God the Glory you know like
[22:59] after all these years it's been like 25
[23:01] years he healed my thyroid problem so so
[23:04] the blood test came back clear so I'm
[23:06] really grateful for that and the song
[23:09] that came to me after I um after that
[23:12] happened um was can you

[43:07] never able to come to the knowledge of
[43:09] the truth now as Janice and jambus
[43:12] withstood Moses so do these also resist
[43:15] the truth men of crup Minds reprobate
[43:18] concerning the faith but they shall
[43:20] proceed no further for their Folly shall
[43:22] be um be manifest unto all men as theirs

[43:36] pass me by this morning amen gracious
[43:38] heavenly father as we bow our heads once
[43:40] again Lord we do not come here just to
[43:42] go through a religious motion or a
[43:44] ceremony or Lord we've come to meet with
[43:46] the almighty God we've come to meet with
[43:48] the creator of heavens and earth Lord
[43:50] Jesus that you would come and change our
[43:52] lives you'd make us more like you father
[43:54] that burdens would be lifted sickness
[43:56] would depart Lord Jesus sorrow would be
[43:58] replaced with joy father unbelief would
[44:00] be taken away and Faith would be
[44:02] deposited in its place Lord that you
[44:04] would have your way in this in this
[44:05] service Lord we submit ourselves under
[44:07] your Mighty hand asking you to forgive
[44:09] us of our sins and our wrongs Lord
[44:11] cleanse us of all iniquity wash us in
[44:13] your blood once again and may you take
[44:15] complete control of all of us for your
[44:17] glory Lord those who are streaming who
[44:19] couldn't be here today as well be the a
[44:21] portion heal their bodies father give
[44:23] them strength Lord watch over them
[44:25] Father we commit them into your hands as
[44:26] well For Your Glory we ask all these
[44:29] things in Jesus Christ's name amen amen
[44:32] God bless you friends you can have your
[44:33] seats uh this morning so I want to talk
[44:37] about the hardness of this age so I'm
[44:40] going to probably talk a little bit
[44:41] slower cuz Brother Jimmy's going to be
[44:43] translating as I'm speaking so I'm
[44:45] probably if it feels like we're in the
[44:47] slow lane well we're just going to go in
[44:48] the slow lane but we're going to get
[44:50] there so it's not that I don't I feel
[44:52] like splitting out of my skin right now
[44:54] uh the atmosphere here and I'm trying to
[44:56] keep it all together but you know
[44:59] there's a hardness in this age there's a
[45:02] real uh resentment against Christianity
[45:04] in this age there's a real you know
[45:06] people you know you tell people that
[45:08] you're a Christian and they label you
[45:10] with all kinds of things that the devil
[45:11] has thrown in there am me to take away
[45:14] discredit overshadow put doubt unbelief
[45:17] on the power of God and what real
[45:20] Christianity is now this was prophesied
[45:23] this is why I started actually in um so
[45:25] I'm going to keep
[45:30] I started from this verse there's many
[45:32] things here this is speaking of our day
[45:33] because because Paul said that in the
[45:35] last days perilous time shall come now
[45:37] this is this is the last days I'm sure
[45:40] we can agree that this is the last days
[45:42] amen the world is heading for a nuclear
[45:44] war it is it is it cannot be reversed
[45:47] amen prophecy will be fulfilled Rome's
[45:50] going to be be be blown up by bombs
[45:53] America's going to be smoked bombs and
[45:54] craters as was prophesied the first six
[45:58] visions of brother Braham have been
[45:59] fulfilled the seventh sure is on its way
[46:01] America is tearing itself apart amen
[46:04] we're not uh we're not shocked by these
[46:06] well it is shocking to watch to see it
[46:08] unfold but we've been we've been warned
[46:11] before the time it would be here and
[46:13] this is where we're living so we're
[46:14] living in perilous times but you got to
[46:16] realize it doesn't matter how perilous
[46:18] it gets how dark it gets how Troublesome
[46:20] it may be am mean our God is greater
[46:23] he's mightier he won't leave us alone
[46:26] we're not not here alone okay we're not
[46:30] we're not defeated we have come to win
[46:33] he's anointed us to win okay you got to
[46:36] remember that this may seem a bit
[46:38] negative but it's actually very positive
[46:40] because we see prophecy but if you can
[46:42] see the darkness for what it is you
[46:44] don't want it amen you shun it you you
[46:46] but you understand it you say that is
[46:48] that is the devil I want no part of that
[46:50] in my life amen so so there is this
[46:53] there's this piece here where where
[46:55] poorly lists all these attribut Ro of of
[46:57] this anointing that's in this age and
[46:59] and I pray none of us have any even near
[47:02] of this thing in our lives amen but he
[47:04] says now as Janice and jambus withstood
[47:06] Moses so do these also resist the truth
[47:09] men of crap Minds reprobate concerning
[47:11] the faith but they shall proceed no
[47:13] further sry I've gone to the English
[47:15] have I not um yeah we're going to be
[47:17] jumping around a lot but he says now as
[47:19] Jus and jous withstood Moses so now the
[47:21] Apostle Paul is now take us back into
[47:24] the days of the E first Exodus to say is
[47:27] going to be there's going to be the
[47:28] conditions of the first Exodus are in
[47:30] this Exodus now we understand that
[47:33] there's been three times there been in
[47:35] Exodus right the first time was in the
[47:37] book of Exodus where Israel was taken
[47:39] God sent a Vindicator Prophet the pillar
[47:41] of fire God himself was in attendance
[47:44] and and he he threw Moses brought Israel
[47:47] out of slavery into into the promised
[47:50] land right the second time of the great
[47:52] Exodus when when that Pillar of Fire
[47:54] didn't God didn't send a prophet he came
[47:56] and self the god Prophet amen and he
[47:58] brought a people out of traditions of
[48:01] man and called religion into the baptism
[48:03] of the Holy Ghost that is the second
[48:06] Exodus now but now we're living in the
[48:08] time of the Third Exodus where God is
[48:10] taking a people who are filled with the
[48:12] Holy Ghost and he's taking them from
[48:13] this world into Glory this is the great
[48:16] season that we're living in today amen
[48:19] but you see the conditions of the first
[48:21] Exodus have come around in the Third
[48:24] Exodus now we're just going to we're
[48:27] just going to speak a bit I just want to
[48:28] come down to this piece because we very
[48:31] much live in this time now Exodus 1:8
[48:34] says now there arose up a new king over
[48:36] Egypt which knew not Joseph so there
[48:39] came a generation uh or a king over
[48:42] Egypt that did not know the power of
[48:44] Joseph they did not hold the testimony
[48:47] of Joseph where Joseph we know God sent
[48:49] him into Egypt not just to save his
[48:51] Brethren and you know all of his all of
[48:53] his family but Joseph coming into Egypt
[48:56] save the whole world if you think about
[48:58] Egypt if Joseph hadn't been there there
[49:01] would have been famine or there was
[49:03] famine but they would have probably
[49:05] resorted to cannibalism they would have
[49:06] lost everything Egypt would have been
[49:08] destroyed as a nation they would have
[49:10] been a total chaos of a ruin of a
[49:12] civilization it would have ended right
[49:14] there but that gift that God sent into
[49:16] their midst saved saved that nation and
[49:19] made it the mighty super power that it
[49:21] was in that day you see and and and and
[49:23] if you look at history especially
[49:25] Western history where there's been
[49:27] Revival amen you God has sent a
[49:29] messenger into a country and and and the
[49:32] people for a big part of that embraced
[49:34] that and it actually impacted the whole
[49:36] of society where the rulers would would
[49:39] believe what the messenger was saying
[49:42] amen they still were very greatly
[49:44] impacted by that message coming to that
[49:46] country and it delivered them Amen
[49:48] brother brah would say the reason that
[49:50] the French Revolution never crossed the
[49:52] British channel was because the anointed
[49:54] preachers of God Amen preached the word
[49:57] of God and it kept that chaotic spirit
[50:00] away from the country amen you look at
[50:02] America the reason that it is what it is
[50:04] today is because a 100 odd years ago you
[50:07] know they had many great Awakenings
[50:09] there was a great cry and a great desire
[50:11] to see God live and it caused the
[50:13] shackles of Rome to be broken it caused
[50:16] Liberty to come into those colonies and
[50:18] they became the great nation that they
[50:20] are today but the reason that it's
[50:22] falling apart today is because they had
[50:23] an opportunity to embrace the Holy Ghost
[50:26] they had an opportunity to actually
[50:28] really receive the Gospel but they
[50:29] turned it down in the 50s and that's why
[50:32] the thing has fallen apart but you see
[50:34] now now we're living in a season because
[50:36] even brother bram's day you know he knew
[50:39] all was known throughout America during
[50:41] the healing revivals when he preached
[50:43] there and remember the Deep cth to the
[50:45] Deep who's seen that film that was
[50:48] preached in Washington
[50:49] DC I think he was acquainted with Nixon
[50:52] or different ones he knew he knew
[50:54] powerful yo Congressman upshore was a
[50:56] congressman and he was healed in one of
[50:59] the meetings and you know Congressman
[51:01] upshore made sure his testimony got into
[51:03] everyone's hands that was a leader he
[51:05] even said that he translated into
[51:07] Russian and sent it to Stalin cuz he
[51:10] wanted even Stalin to have a chance to
[51:12] see that God
[51:14] Lives there's a lot of influence that
[51:17] post World War II healing Revival that
[51:18] God uh God uh spearheaded through
[51:21] brother brandham changed America it
[51:23] changed Canada it changed many parts of
[51:26] of the world but now we're living in a
[51:28] season where the world doesn't know it
[51:31] anymore they don't know Joseph there's
[51:33] leaders that have risen up they don't
[51:34] know Joseph they don't know the power of
[51:37] God they're not God-fearing anymore
[51:39] they're not interested in anything God
[51:41] has done so we're living in this time
[51:44] very much now I'm not talking about
[51:46] politics today I'm not talking about the
[51:47] election or whatever more but I just
[51:49] want you to know we're living in a
[51:50] season where there's leaders there's
[51:52] most of the world does not know Joseph
[51:55] and his abilities and his I'm talking
[51:56] about God himself now I'm talk about
[51:58] Joseph right and so we're living in this
[52:01] day now excuse
[52:06] me brother bam uh describes or God
[52:09] describes
[52:10] this thank you for the prayers as well
[52:12] I'm feeling a lot better William's back
[52:14] fighting forit Gabriel is fine so I
[52:16] really appreciate that amen but you see
[52:19] God would describe this age uh in the
[52:21] Book of Revelation is a lady oan age
[52:23] it's a and it's a wretched miserable
[52:25] poor blind and naked age now the word
[52:30] comes uh that word comes from two Greek
[52:32] uh Words which means endur and trial it
[52:34] has nothing that uh that's the word
[52:36] wretched it has nothing to do with
[52:38] trials that come to a true Christian for
[52:41] God describes a Chris and trial is
[52:43] blessed and his attitude of one of joy
[52:45] is his description is phrased as
[52:48] wretched and
[52:52] miserable well okay I'll just clear out
[52:55] the flues and hey we'll be good okay now
[52:59] because the Christian attitude uh his
[53:01] attitude one of joy is his description
[53:03] his phras is riched and miserable how
[53:05] strange is in this age of Plenty in this
[53:07] age of progress in this age of abundance
[53:09] How can there be trials well now it is
[53:12] strange but in this age of Plenty and
[53:13] opportunity when everyone has so much
[53:16] and there's so much more to be had with
[53:18] all that the uh inventions uh to do our
[53:21] work and so many uh things to give us
[53:23] pleasure suddenly we find mental illness
[53:25] taking such a toll is to alarm the
[53:27] nation when everybody ought to be happy
[53:30] when really nothing seem to be unhappy
[53:32] about millions are taking sedatives at
[53:34] night pet pills in the morning rushing
[53:36] to doctors entering institutions and
[53:39] trying to drown out unknown fears by
[53:41] alcohol or even I could say they run to
[53:43] entertainment they run to gaming they
[53:45] run to streaming they run to Social
[53:48] Media they run to something to try and
[53:50] drown out the fear now you think what
[53:53] really really the place where Liberty is
[53:55] should be the House of God Amen where it
[53:58] should be known among the nation that
[54:00] really if you really want freedom go to
[54:02] Christ right that that should be known
[54:05] you think about the revivals of 200
[54:07] years ago of Charles finny and different
[54:09] ones great great men of God brother B
[54:11] speaks about they would preach in a
[54:13] place they'd go into one one of them I
[54:15] can't remember who it was he'd go into a
[54:17] building and and just attest the
[54:18] Acoustics no microphones no speakers
[54:21] it's stand at the pullit just say and
[54:22] just scream out repent or perish and
[54:24] people who heard him would actually get
[54:26] on their knees and repent there' just be
[54:29] whole towns would be changed pubs would
[54:31] be cleared out all these things you see
[54:33] this is how God used to move and he
[54:35] still is the same but there's a hardness
[54:38] in the world today because people have
[54:40] seen the negative of religion people do
[54:44] not want what God has because they
[54:46] associated with a bunch of hypocrisy and
[54:49] and evil living and Scandal and
[54:51] moneymaking and all these things you see
[54:53] that's why people don't run to run to
[54:56] the Lord anymore but there's a spirit of
[54:57] hardness in the age now he says yes this
[55:02] age boasts of its tremendous stores of
[55:04] worldly Goods but the people are less
[55:06] happy than ever this boast this age
[55:08] boasts of its spiritual attainments but
[55:11] the people are less sure of themselves
[55:13] than ever this age boast of better moral
[55:15] values but and it is more corrupt than
[55:18] any age since the flood now this age
[55:23] does boast its moral Integrity it does
[55:25] you all all the all the all the social
[55:28] rights and everything that done but you
[55:30] see what has happened is we've come back
[55:32] into a time where because there's a
[55:34] pharoh that has risen up that knows not
[55:36] Joseph is that there is a great time of
[55:40] of of children being murdered in this
[55:42] day you know I would hate to think of
[55:44] the number of children that are murdered
[55:47] in the womb now irrespective of how they
[55:50] got there it's still alive you know
[55:53] there's a slogan my body my choices it's
[55:56] should be my body my responsibility and
[55:58] that should go to men and women are we
[56:01] together on that my my yeah but that's
[56:03] not the baby in the womb is not the
[56:05] mother's body it's its own life right so
[56:09] just as just as in the first Exodus all
[56:11] the all the Hebrew all the Hebrew boys
[56:14] were
[56:15] throwing were thrown into the
[56:18] river now I'm just so I'm just trying to
[56:20] find where I have this here I'm sure I
[56:23] have it no maybe I don't I thought i'
[56:27] did oh yes here we
[56:29] are Pharaoh this Pharaoh that knew not
[56:32] Joseph charged the people every Hebrew
[56:34] son's got to be thrown into the river
[56:35] keep the woman alive keep the daughters
[56:38] alive you see and there's a great there
[56:40] there's been Millions around the world
[56:42] that had been killed in the womb right
[56:45] and it's the same thing being see it's
[56:46] being children just like in in in moses'
[56:49] day here in this Exodus time they thrown
[56:52] they were thrown into the Nile now what
[56:54] has happened really with a large
[56:56] percentage of these things is that
[56:58] people sacrifice those children to the
[57:00] God of this evil age because they want
[57:01] to keep their lifestyle you know they
[57:03] want to keep partying they want to live
[57:05] a life of pleasure they want to keep
[57:06] doing what they do and now that child is
[57:08] going to hinder their lifestyle they're
[57:10] going to just be an old Mama now instead
[57:12] of trying to be some sexy thing on the
[57:14] street trying to trying to live a life
[57:16] of Glamour and pleasure and so what they
[57:18] do is they sacrifice now you say this
[57:20] may be a gross exaggeration and you can
[57:23] take it like that if you wish to but I'm
[57:25] saying is people sacri rice children to
[57:27] the God of this evil age even to neglect
[57:30] children being raised in a home that's
[57:33] because when when when fathers would
[57:35] rather spend time in front of a
[57:37] screen you know gaming or doing
[57:40] something instead of looking after their
[57:42] family that's what are they doing
[57:44] they're sacrificing their children to
[57:46] worship a
[57:47] god you see so there's many of these
[57:50] things going on now the Nile was more
[57:54] than a river in Egypt it was a source of
[57:57] life now I'm not sure what era from we
[57:59] got some egyptologists here or amateur
[58:02] Enthusiast ones which is fine but I'm
[58:04] not sure what era of the Egyptian
[58:06] Kingdom this came out of but the river
[58:07] became known as the father of life and
[58:10] the mother of all men it was considered
[58:13] a manifestation of the god Hai I don't
[58:16] think it's a very happy one you know
[58:18] happy but I wouldn't call it happy it's
[58:21] an idol it's cursed who who blessed the
[58:24] land with life as well as with the
[58:26] goddess uh matat at Ma with apost thing
[58:29] a who embodied the concepts of Truth
[58:32] Harmony and balance so sacrificing these
[58:35] babies to a goddess which embodied the
[58:39] concepts of Truth Harmony and balance so
[58:42] there's got to be balance in the world
[58:44] it's just another Pool of genes that's
[58:47] what people say you know oh we're just
[58:48] an animal we're not an animal we have a
[58:50] soul amen we're very different to an
[58:52] animal you know DNA wies were at least
[58:54] 99% the same name is a
[58:57] chimpanzee but a chimpanzee 4,000 years
[59:01] ago was doing the same thing a
[59:02] chimpanzee does
[59:04] today 4,000 years ago what were we doing
[59:08] we were building pyramids and doing
[59:09] whatever if you take the Egyptians but
[59:11] now 4,000 years later an Egyptian can be
[59:13] in space Oh yes they do we live a very
[59:15] different kind of a life why because
[59:17] there's part of us that's not sure we're
[59:20] we're we're animal here but there's a
[59:22] soul there's a there's an image of God
[59:25] that needs to be expressed and and man
[59:27] is made to be a Creator to you know to
[59:29] to to subdue the subdue the world and
[59:32] things the Chimpanzee is still a
[59:34] chimpanzee because they don't have a
[59:36] soul so so don't ever let some
[59:38] unbelieving teacher try and RAM it down
[59:40] your neck you're just you're just like
[59:41] an animal you're just a worthless you're
[59:44] just a number in a system you're more
[59:46] than a number you we're far more than
[59:48] that amen I mean one soul is worth more
[59:51] than 10 million worlds
[59:53] amen amen so we're very important to God
[59:56] so never never let anything tell you
[59:58] that you got nothing you know there's
[1:00:00] nothing to you no you're part of God if
[1:00:03] amen I believe that amen amen so don't
[1:00:05] you know so so they would they were
[1:00:07] sacrificing these babies to to to the to
[1:00:11] the Nile Amen to to keep their lifestyle
[1:00:14] keep control now the same thing happened
[1:00:16] in the second Exodus where where Herod
[1:00:19] after after the wise men had come and
[1:00:21] you know they had come to Jerusalem
[1:00:22] because they thought well we'll surely
[1:00:24] find the Christ child here but they were
[1:00:26] you know that you know Jerusalem was
[1:00:27] more surprised about God fulfilling
[1:00:29] scripture in their day than they were
[1:00:32] Magi from a foreign land and so and then
[1:00:36] but then of course you know the uh the
[1:00:37] wise men they go to Bethlehem they find
[1:00:40] they find our lord Jesus and then
[1:00:41] they're about to go back to Jerusalem to
[1:00:43] tell Herod where where the baby is but
[1:00:45] God warns him in a dream leave and go go
[1:00:48] home another way and so then when Herod
[1:00:51] you know when the penny finally drops
[1:00:53] and he F and he realizes actually the
[1:00:55] wise men AR going to tell him where the
[1:00:57] Christ is then he commands his men to go
[1:01:00] into Bethlehem and kill all the children
[1:01:02] two years and
[1:01:03] down why because they're trying to kill
[1:01:06] the Christ child they're trying to stop
[1:01:08] the serpent Bruiser raising up now I
[1:01:11] want to say these things is because we
[1:01:13] are ordained to stand on the head of the
[1:01:15] serpent I mean we are ordained that
[1:01:17] every devil would be under our feet I
[1:01:19] mean every work of Darkness would be
[1:01:21] ashes under our feet we are born for
[1:01:23] that purpose and just like Moses was was
[1:01:26] born for that purpose to raise up Amen
[1:01:28] to take that all that demon power in
[1:01:30] Egypt all the power of Egypt under his
[1:01:32] feet and bring out a people amen
[1:01:34] foreshadowing Christ that wouldn't just
[1:01:36] he wouldn't conquer a national Kingdom
[1:01:38] but he had conquer hell death in the
[1:01:39] grave amen that Christ would he would
[1:01:41] bruise the head of the seed of the
[1:01:43] serpent amen as prophesied amen he was
[1:01:47] tried to be killed by Herod to stop that
[1:01:49] happening are you f Genesis chapter 3
[1:01:51] that's where I am if you're wondering
[1:01:53] God told God told Adam and Eve that the
[1:01:55] seed of the woman would bruise the head
[1:01:57] of the seed of the serpent that was a
[1:01:59] prophecy of Christ coming right but as a
[1:02:01] Shadow Moses was that same thing amen
[1:02:05] and because we are the children of God
[1:02:07] we are ordained to do the same thing
[1:02:09] that God would live in us that every
[1:02:11] spirit that comes against us will be
[1:02:13] under our feet amen that we're tread on
[1:02:15] the head of serpents amen as it says in
[1:02:18] the Book of Psalms amen this is this is
[1:02:20] what we're uh anointed to do so this
[1:02:23] world has been engineered to try and
[1:02:25] kill us before we can come to our
[1:02:27] position I mean that's why it's so
[1:02:29] careful after someone has a real birth
[1:02:31] the devil's here to try and hinder the
[1:02:33] growth of that
[1:02:35] child but God ain't going to let it
[1:02:39] happen now I'm trying to lay a bit of a
[1:02:42] background to really get where I want to
[1:02:44] go now this this word reprobate now
[1:02:48] sorry I don't I don't have this in
[1:02:50] espanol um but now this word reprobate
[1:02:54] it means not standing the test not not
[1:02:56] approved and it was properly used of of
[1:02:59] metals and coins so so a coin would be
[1:03:01] given to you in the olden days and and
[1:03:03] it would be given to certain Smiths and
[1:03:05] gills to test if that coin was genuine
[1:03:07] CU imagine if you're walking around with
[1:03:10] uh counterfeit gold coins in your in
[1:03:12] your purse you think man I've got all
[1:03:14] this gold and then you take it to
[1:03:16] someone and they examine it and they say
[1:03:19] no this is fo's gold you know this isn't
[1:03:22] genuine this isn't genuine gold it would
[1:03:24] be considered reprobation
[1:03:26] so it wouldn't be
[1:03:28] manifesting what it's meant to be
[1:03:29] manifesting now Janice and jambus were
[1:03:32] were were reprobate concerning the faith
[1:03:35] of the day and so men will rise again in
[1:03:38] this end time as Janice and jambus and
[1:03:41] they'll be reprobate they won't be
[1:03:42] genuine concerning the faith now the
[1:03:45] faith is not a faith it's not a
[1:03:47] denominational Faith it's the
[1:03:48] restoration of the full word of God Amen
[1:03:51] as as prophesied in Malachi 4 so they
[1:03:54] would be reprobate conc turning the
[1:03:56] faith but I want you to notice this now
[1:03:59] when Moses when Moses went in before
[1:04:02] Pharaoh he cast his rod down first God
[1:04:06] had commissioned
[1:04:08] him take that take thy rod throw it on
[1:04:12] the ground turn into a serpent Moses ran
[1:04:14] maybe for the hills you know but he came
[1:04:16] back God said pick it up by the tail and
[1:04:18] it turned into a staff again and so
[1:04:21] Moses went in before pharaoh and he's
[1:04:23] commanding Pharaoh let my people go he's
[1:04:25] not asking he's commanding and then so
[1:04:28] and then so when when Moses Moses throws
[1:04:31] down his
[1:04:33] staff then
[1:04:35] Pharaoh maybe we'll just stay with the
[1:04:37] picture but then when when Pharaoh saw
[1:04:40] his staff turn into a snake then Pharaoh
[1:04:43] said well I've got I've got Ministry
[1:04:45] that can do the same thing I've got
[1:04:47] Janice and jamus I've got these
[1:04:49] magicians and they got their Stars they
[1:04:51] threw it down and it became a snake so
[1:04:54] they did the same thing that Moses Mo
[1:04:56] did and what happens is but but the
[1:04:58] intent of Moses and Janice and jambus
[1:05:01] are two very different intents Moses is
[1:05:03] there to bring Liberty Moses is there to
[1:05:06] break a slave mentality Moses there to
[1:05:08] break the break the task Master's rods
[1:05:11] amen Moses is there to deliver people
[1:05:12] out of Egypt that they don't live in
[1:05:14] that condition no more and the true
[1:05:16] gospel does not the true gospel is here
[1:05:19] to break a slave mentality now that
[1:05:21] slave mentality is I'll never overcome
[1:05:23] this God can't do it yes sure he did
[1:05:26] something in the past but he can't do it
[1:05:27] today you know I'm always going to be
[1:05:29] this way I Was Born This Way my
[1:05:31] Situation's too bad and people surrender
[1:05:34] themselves to those kind of Lies that's
[1:05:36] a slave mentality and what happens is
[1:05:38] Janice and jambus what they wanted to do
[1:05:41] is keep the people in the Kingdom of
[1:05:43] Egypt so there's Ministry around the
[1:05:45] world and they want to they're Kingdom
[1:05:47] Builders all they're interested and is
[1:05:50] adding numbers to their movement to
[1:05:51] their denomination that's all they and
[1:05:53] they want to hold the people in that in
[1:05:56] that mentality and they'll say yes you
[1:05:59] know and and they keep people in a slave
[1:06:02] mentality because they make the grace of
[1:06:04] God something it's not they make the
[1:06:06] grace of God basically God puts blinkers
[1:06:08] on his eyes and don't see our problems
[1:06:10] and doesn't fix us he can't do it no the
[1:06:13] grace of God is sure you've got this
[1:06:15] addiction sure you've got this Spirit
[1:06:16] ruining your life but the grace of God
[1:06:18] looks beyond it and and they preach
[1:06:20] those things in that manner and they
[1:06:22] keep people in that state of a slave
[1:06:25] mental
[1:06:26] but the grace of God is here to break
[1:06:28] the Yoke of the enemy the anointing
[1:06:30] destroys the Yoke amen the true
[1:06:32] anointing of God destroys the Yoke it
[1:06:34] doesn't give you a seven-step plan to
[1:06:36] coping with your problems no the word of
[1:06:39] God brings Liberty and complete Liberty
[1:06:42] amen doesn't give a partial Liberty
[1:06:44] we're not you know on the weekends we're
[1:06:46] with God and during the week we're with
[1:06:47] the devil you under no sir we are we are
[1:06:50] full custody and soul custody with our
[1:06:53] Lord Jesus Christ amen Hallelujah but
[1:06:56] you see this is what this is the problem
[1:06:57] with denomination it holds people in a
[1:06:59] system amen you can look through church
[1:07:02] history and whenever God sheds light on
[1:07:04] his on his word the church doesn't
[1:07:07] Rejoice the church doesn't break down
[1:07:09] its barriers it doesn't delete out its
[1:07:11] full stop after its lift list of beliefs
[1:07:14] and and and and lets God change it they
[1:07:16] say no this what this man is preaching
[1:07:19] is contrary to what we previously
[1:07:21] believe and therefore he is wrong look
[1:07:23] at y I was thinking of I was thinking of
[1:07:25] um
[1:07:27] uh John hus he was 100 years before
[1:07:31] Luther he received virtually the same
[1:07:34] Revelation that Luther received that
[1:07:35] just shall live by faith and many
[1:07:37] different things so close to what Luther
[1:07:40] was preaching that when Luther rose up
[1:07:41] with what he believed they said you're
[1:07:43] just believing you're just preaching
[1:07:45] what hus believed but you see John hus
[1:07:48] when he came to the end of his life he
[1:07:50] was he was alone he had he he died on
[1:07:53] the stake everyone forsook him
[1:07:56] the church said rant he said I
[1:07:58] cannot and he died alone at the stake
[1:08:02] but he said in a 100 years someone will
[1:08:04] raise up with the same teaching and you
[1:08:06] won't be able to stop it and 100 years
[1:08:09] later I think virtually to the day
[1:08:10] Martin Luther nailed the thesis on the
[1:08:12] uh Church door there in wienberg I think
[1:08:14] it was amen and the revolution I mean
[1:08:17] you it was a revolution the Reformation
[1:08:19] amen spread through Europe and people
[1:08:20] broke the shackles of Rome I mean but
[1:08:22] you see he stood alone but you see the
[1:08:25] Catholic Church did not rejoice and he
[1:08:27] was a Catholic priest I think he was hus
[1:08:29] was I you know Luther was as well and he
[1:08:31] didn't want to start a new church no he
[1:08:33] wanted to change the one he was in but
[1:08:36] you see there were Janice and jambres
[1:08:38] there amen putting shade on his teaching
[1:08:40] trying to keep the people in that system
[1:08:43] of
[1:08:44] Catholicism and that cycle has repeated
[1:08:47] down Through the
[1:08:49] Ages amen
[1:08:51] Lord amen so so that is Janice and jamb
[1:08:55] intent is to keep people in a human
[1:08:57] Kingdom we're not here to build human
[1:09:00] kingdoms we're not even here to build
[1:09:02] the name of this church forget the name
[1:09:04] of this church we just have a name but
[1:09:06] no brother Bram said his mission is that
[1:09:09] God would take men and women and make
[1:09:12] them powerhouses of the Holy Ghost built
[1:09:15] into the fullness of the stature of
[1:09:17] Christ and when he finishes the church
[1:09:19] age book his last um his last paragraph
[1:09:21] he says this one thing I want to see is
[1:09:24] that man and God would have a true
[1:09:26] spiritual relationship am mean that man
[1:09:29] would walk with God in the revelation of
[1:09:31] his word he said basic he said that is
[1:09:34] basically my summary of my entire life
[1:09:38] that is the summary of the angel of God
[1:09:40] coming and commissioning brother Braham
[1:09:42] that's a summary of the seals opening
[1:09:45] amen that's a summary of the truth being
[1:09:46] restored as that there be true spiritual
[1:09:49] relationship between God and man
[1:09:50] restored upon the Earth but you see
[1:09:52] Janice and jambus want to keep people in
[1:09:54] uh as slaves right say Let My People Go
[1:09:58] amen we're not slaves we're free people
[1:10:00] today you don't have to listen to the
[1:10:01] lies of a serpent amen you can walk
[1:10:04] free amen but you see what happened is
[1:10:07] when Janice and jambus did the same
[1:10:08] things it hardened the heart of pharaoh
[1:10:10] and the people and you see now this is
[1:10:12] why when you go maybe you speak to
[1:10:14] someone and maybe you use exactly the
[1:10:16] same words as a denomination you you
[1:10:19] maybe you share same testimonies as
[1:10:21] happens even in Pentecostal moves it
[1:10:24] hardens the heart of people because they
[1:10:25] say well that happens there what's so
[1:10:27] special about you you understand you are
[1:10:30] you with me class today see there's a
[1:10:32] hardening of people's hearts because of
[1:10:34] what Jenice and jambus do but you got to
[1:10:36] understand it doesn't stop the genuine
[1:10:39] it doesn't stop the genuine amen these
[1:10:41] things have allowed to come upon the
[1:10:43] Earth to test the genu do people really
[1:10:45] want to know
[1:10:50] God because Janice and jous they did the
[1:10:53] same enchantments as Moses did but one
[1:10:58] difference
[1:10:59] is one serpent got fat the others got
[1:11:02] eaten it wasn't Moses's he didn't have
[1:11:05] to say Janice can I have my staff back
[1:11:07] now no Moses one gobbled up the others
[1:11:11] went on his
[1:11:15] way and
[1:11:17] then and then it just says here in verse
[1:11:19] 14 Pharaoh's heart is hard and he
[1:11:21] refused to let the people go because of
[1:11:22] what Janice and jambus did and it was
[1:11:24] the same thing it was exactly the same
[1:11:27] thing when Moses was told by God to go
[1:11:30] uh pour water upon the land and then all
[1:11:32] the waters will turn into blood Janice
[1:11:34] and jambus did the same thing they did
[1:11:36] they did exactly the same thing and so
[1:11:38] Pharaoh's heart was hardened and his
[1:11:40] house and neither did he set his heart
[1:11:42] to to to to set them free so the bogus
[1:11:45] dollar begins to begins to actually uh
[1:11:49] cause so much trouble that people don't
[1:11:50] see the genuine and that's why we've got
[1:11:52] to live such a life that if that that
[1:11:55] people may may be maybe uh I can't
[1:11:59] remember the phrase but they can be
[1:12:00] staunch atheists they can be staunch a
[1:12:03] stch can be atheist but if they see you
[1:12:05] they say if there's ever a Christian
[1:12:07] it's that
[1:12:08] person amen that's how we should live
[1:12:11] Lord if they Lord use me to be a genuine
[1:12:14] example of Christianity amen that when
[1:12:17] people see me they don't see a
[1:12:19] counterfeit they may get confused
[1:12:21] because I sound like a lot of what they
[1:12:22] say but remember Moses did it first and
[1:12:25] JIS and jambus copied right brother
[1:12:27] Braham came with the gift of healing the
[1:12:29] two signs right and he said after that
[1:12:32] there's all kind of people that you know
[1:12:34] you know people preached you had to see
[1:12:35] blood on your hands or oil on your face
[1:12:37] or Balls of Fire on the platform or you
[1:12:39] know all kinds of fanaticism rose
[1:12:41] up because it was what Janice and
[1:12:43] jambres raising up with similar things
[1:12:46] but who did it first and people you know
[1:12:48] because brother Bram took people by the
[1:12:49] hand that he saw the he saw the patn and
[1:12:51] different things on his hand and could
[1:12:53] discern what was wrong with the person
[1:12:55] before the gift of discernment came into
[1:12:56] manifestation and others would say they
[1:12:58] smell Devils they see colors all kinds
[1:13:00] of things and what is it as Janice and
[1:13:02] jamb is bringing confusion among the
[1:13:04] people to keep people in
[1:13:08] Chains but who did it first the prophet
[1:13:10] did it first amen as as as uh Jesus
[1:13:14] would would speak the there shall arise
[1:13:16] false Christ and false prophets and show
[1:13:18] great signs and wonders and so much that
[1:13:19] if it were possible they would deceive
[1:13:21] the very elect so we know a Christ is an
[1:13:23] anointed one amen so says that many
[1:13:25] false anointed ones would rise so there
[1:13:28] are people who are genuinely Anointed
[1:13:30] with the Holy Ghost but they're not
[1:13:31] genuine in their hearts this is the age
[1:13:34] we live and that's why it's so important
[1:13:36] that when we judge everything we always
[1:13:39] judge it by the fruit amen where is
[1:13:41] Judge it by the fruit Jesus Jesus would
[1:13:44] say by their fruits s sorry we're going
[1:13:46] to this one instead he says by their
[1:13:47] fruits you shall know them he says you
[1:13:50] don't get you don't get good fruit off a
[1:13:52] corrupt tree it brings forth evil fruit
[1:13:54] so you so he's saying look at the life
[1:13:56] that the tree produces it can have a big
[1:13:59] explanation about what it does and what
[1:14:01] it can do and what it's made of but just
[1:14:03] get the fruit how do you know an apple
[1:14:05] tree you get an Apple off an apple
[1:14:08] tree right you eat the apple that's an
[1:14:10] apple orange tree all those kind of
[1:14:12] things so it's the life see we must
[1:14:15] never put this a a supernatural gift
[1:14:19] above the life of God above what the
[1:14:22] word is meant to produce there's many
[1:14:24] Supernatural gifts in the world does it
[1:14:26] mean we run after them all there's many
[1:14:29] who who who who have great testimonies
[1:14:31] even no it's the word of God that's the
[1:14:33] most important thing amen it's the word
[1:14:35] of God right it's the life that's
[1:14:37] produced by that word you say well I
[1:14:40] know a lot of train wrecks along the
[1:14:41] life of people who claim to be the
[1:14:43] message but what about the genuine what
[1:14:45] about the genuine believer you see the
[1:14:47] devil will never show you the genuine
[1:14:49] believer he always show you the mistakes
[1:14:51] and the trouble and the problems and
[1:14:52] whatever more but what about the genuine
[1:14:55] yes that's I've said to many people go
[1:14:57] around church and ask people their
[1:14:59] testimony I've said to people go ask
[1:15:02] them their testimony ask them why are
[1:15:04] they Believers yeah isn't that the proof
[1:15:07] of the pudding is the testimony
[1:15:10] thereof amen amen I think I think
[1:15:15] so amen I trust you all with me
[1:15:19] amen amen see it's it's when we really
[1:15:23] know him then the Life of Christ comes
[1:15:25] forth because many will come to him in
[1:15:28] the end time say Lord have we not done
[1:15:30] many great things in your name he says
[1:15:32] depart from me I never knew you they
[1:15:34] cast out devils in many mighty
[1:15:36] things they said he never knew them now
[1:15:39] God knows everybody but he didn't
[1:15:41] intimately know them he never dwelt he
[1:15:44] they never receiv received the true
[1:15:45] baptism of the Holy Ghost you see and
[1:15:48] this is why this is why we must go we
[1:15:50] must take it back always back to the
[1:15:52] scripture amen right the word of God
[1:15:54] what
[1:15:56] to me I I follow the message because it
[1:15:58] reveals Jesus Christ in the scripture
[1:16:01] right I follow what brother R teaches I
[1:16:04] take it back into the Bible I never find
[1:16:06] it go outside the Bible I always find it
[1:16:09] back in the scripture right this was the
[1:16:11] absolute of the Prophet amen amen this
[1:16:14] is why I follow it What attracted me was
[1:16:16] his
[1:16:17] preaching when I heard him preach Jesus
[1:16:20] Christ came out of History he was alive
[1:16:23] I remember sitting there in my flat
[1:16:24] making Homebrew drunk and loss as can be
[1:16:27] hearing and preach crying I'd sat in
[1:16:28] church many different churches before
[1:16:30] that but that voice spoke to me because
[1:16:32] why he took the scripture say look you
[1:16:34] can meet God today he's alive there's a
[1:16:36] genuine baptism of the Holy Ghost he can
[1:16:38] transform you he can free you from sin
[1:16:41] he's just preaching the Bible what he it
[1:16:43] changed my life amen more than even the
[1:16:46] supernatural well what about the
[1:16:48] supernatural in his life that was just
[1:16:49] to vindicate what he was preaching was
[1:16:51] the truth amen and God over Vindicated
[1:16:54] it that you would know
[1:16:55] we're the true
[1:16:57] voices
[1:16:59] amen praise the
[1:17:02] Lord amen you see Pharaoh's Pharaoh's
[1:17:06] denomination said they could do the same
[1:17:08] thing carnal
[1:17:13] impersonation and it hide in the heart
[1:17:15] of the
[1:17:16] people now in Jesus's day so I'm going
[1:17:18] to skip through because I feel like we
[1:17:20] kind
[1:17:23] of see the negative is always thrown
[1:17:26] everywhere now let's just look at these
[1:17:27] guys for a for a second because that
[1:17:30] Spirit of Janice and jambus has never
[1:17:32] died Spirits don't die amen that's why
[1:17:35] you got to be careful whatever comes out
[1:17:37] of your mouth it should be a positive
[1:17:39] confession of the word of God Amen right
[1:17:42] it's like you know Jesus is there by the
[1:17:45] tomb of
[1:17:46] Lazarus and um and then the you know the
[1:17:49] Jews that were with with Mary and Martha
[1:17:52] comforting them basically trying to keep
[1:17:53] them in their sorrow said you know he
[1:17:56] could heal others but this one he
[1:17:57] couldn't save this one he couldn't help
[1:17:59] that's why he wasn't here the case was
[1:18:02] too hard you know so that is that
[1:18:04] unbelieving spirit will say sure he's
[1:18:07] done other things in the past but he
[1:18:08] can't do it now he can't help me now the
[1:18:11] trouble's too big now look Lazarus is
[1:18:13] dead if he was really the resurrection
[1:18:15] and the life why did he stop him dying
[1:18:18] but Jesus in John 11 it's interesting he
[1:18:20] actually says I'm glad for your sakes
[1:18:22] that I wasn't there telling telling his
[1:18:25] disciples that Lazarus is dead I'm glad
[1:18:27] for your sakes that I wasn't there that
[1:18:28] you would believe so a lot of times in
[1:18:31] life hardship comes on because God
[1:18:34] actually wants to raise our faith you
[1:18:36] know all of us want a testimony but are
[1:18:39] you willing to actually be the one in
[1:18:40] the
[1:18:41] testimony are you willing to let God use
[1:18:44] you as a
[1:18:45] testimony oh I need proof of the Living
[1:18:48] God he wants to use you amen I mean cuz
[1:18:51] it's you know cuz it's one thing to
[1:18:52] share someone else's testimony but when
[1:18:54] it's your testimony that's a very
[1:18:56] different thing amen but you look at
[1:18:58] these guys after after Jesus rose
[1:19:02] Lazarus from the grave then they then
[1:19:04] they had a meeting what are we going to
[1:19:06] do then from that day
[1:19:09] forth it says here in in in verse 53
[1:19:13] from then from that day forth they took
[1:19:14] counsel together for to put him to death
[1:19:17] and they even wanted to put Lazarus to
[1:19:19] death too
[1:19:24] [Music]
[1:19:25] but this is this is the spirit of Jenice
[1:19:27] and jambus because there was a there was
[1:19:29] a pressure put on don't follow this man
[1:19:34] they that Spirit wanted to keep Israel
[1:19:36] look at their condition in that day look
[1:19:39] at them under these religious leaders
[1:19:40] what Liberty did they have what promise
[1:19:44] of Moses did they have living in their
[1:19:45] lives apart from the fact they were
[1:19:47] living in the promised land what did
[1:19:49] they have did they have Liberty did they
[1:19:51] have did they have their own Nation were
[1:19:53] they free to live however they wanted to
[1:19:55] live no they were taxed by the Romans
[1:19:58] they were trotten down they you know all
[1:20:01] this trouble had come in but what was
[1:20:03] the reason because they knew not Joseph
[1:20:06] they didn't know the power of God they
[1:20:08] didn't even ask the question like Gideon
[1:20:10] Gideon was a scriptural man when the
[1:20:12] angel of the Lord came he said if God is
[1:20:14] for us we are the if God is with us we
[1:20:16] are the
[1:20:17] Miracles they weren't asking that
[1:20:19] question they were just trying to
[1:20:21] politically survive and just keep their
[1:20:23] little thing going on
[1:20:26] what was it it was that Spirit of Janice
[1:20:28] and jambus holding the people down but
[1:20:30] now when the Messiah came not just a
[1:20:32] prophet but when the Messiah came Amen
[1:20:35] to set them free not from Rome but from
[1:20:37] sin and self and death am mean to
[1:20:39] fulfill the promises that the prophets
[1:20:41] have been speaking would come and there
[1:20:43] he was they did not get happy they got
[1:20:46] angry and the more Jesus did the angrier
[1:20:49] they
[1:20:50] became amen but then even among
[1:20:53] themselves
[1:20:55] even among themselves they had the
[1:20:58] supernatural Jesus uh um this is in
[1:21:01] Matthew 12 but but when the Pharisees
[1:21:03] heard it they said this fellow does not
[1:21:06] cast out Devils but by beab the prince
[1:21:08] of devils and Jesus knew their thoughts
[1:21:10] and said unto them every Kingdom divided
[1:21:12] against itself is brought to Desolation
[1:21:14] and every city or house divided against
[1:21:16] itself shall not stand and if Satan cast
[1:21:19] out Satan he is divided pardon me
[1:21:22] against himself how shall then his
[1:21:23] kingdom stand and if I by beab cast out
[1:21:26] Devils then whom do your children cast
[1:21:29] them out therefore ye shall be your
[1:21:32] judges so they had the supernatural in
[1:21:34] their midst
[1:21:36] themselves what's all going on that
[1:21:38] Spirit of Janice and jambus to harden
[1:21:40] the hearts of the people Amen to cause a
[1:21:43] rejection of the
[1:21:46] Messiah this is in the second
[1:21:48] Exodus amen they see that Spirit Never
[1:21:53] Dies it wants to keep people bound and
[1:21:57] that's why it's so important friends
[1:21:59] we're not here to be slaves we're not
[1:22:02] here to be I pray we not a single person
[1:22:05] stands behind this pulpit and preaches a
[1:22:07] slave mentality amen this message did
[1:22:09] not come to bind people and change that
[1:22:13] they could never become the Sons and
[1:22:14] Daughters of God to fulfill the word of
[1:22:16] God now this message came that men and
[1:22:18] woman would raise in faith amen would
[1:22:20] know God in the power of his
[1:22:22] resurrection amen that all doubts would
[1:22:23] be dispar little discouragement would be
[1:22:25] gone I mean a a a burning Faith would be
[1:22:28] in their hearts amen that God Lives he's
[1:22:30] more than able to do it whatever he's
[1:22:31] promised he can do it in his time he'll
[1:22:34] do it we're children of God Amen and
[1:22:36] this is what the message has come to do
[1:22:38] amen we are not here to be beaten down
[1:22:40] the devil may try and beat you down just
[1:22:42] like he tried to beat Moses down but
[1:22:44] Moses said no God has commissioned me
[1:22:46] amen I'm going to take my people out
[1:22:48] amen cuz God has commissioned me to do
[1:22:50] it amen and God has commissioned us to
[1:22:52] do the same thing amen that that that
[1:22:55] there'll be Liberty in every life
[1:22:57] Hallelujah say that that that is
[1:22:59] impossible no we can be so
[1:23:01] free Hallelujah that all the cares of
[1:23:04] Life can
[1:23:07] go all regret can be gone all guilt can
[1:23:10] be gone under the blood of Jesus Christ
[1:23:13] amen and that's more than a euphor that
[1:23:15] comes and goes that's a reality in my
[1:23:17] life I known whom I have believed I mean
[1:23:19] you see the Apostle Paul when he was
[1:23:21] when they said I'm you know his head was
[1:23:23] going to be chopped off he didn't start
[1:23:25] writing a list of regret he said I've
[1:23:27] got a Crown of Life Hallelujah that's
[1:23:29] set before me and not just me only but
[1:23:31] all those that love his glorious
[1:23:33] appearing Hallelujah I mean when he
[1:23:36] stood before King AG grippa those chains
[1:23:39] on him what caused those chains that
[1:23:42] Spirit but the word of God is not bound
[1:23:45] the word of God cannot be bound amen God
[1:23:48] used God used that against them but even
[1:23:51] just for the Apostle Paul's benefit for
[1:23:53] a reason
[1:23:55] but when he's standing before king of
[1:23:56] gripper in the chains I ask you the
[1:23:58] question who was really the chained one
[1:24:00] in that room was it Paul or was it king
[1:24:03] of gripper I say it was king of gripper
[1:24:05] and chains all of his court and his pump
[1:24:07] and who he thought he was and his
[1:24:08] Splendor and I'm in charge of this place
[1:24:11] they were in Chains of sin they were in
[1:24:13] Chains of Darkness they were actually
[1:24:15] the prisoners and Paul was the free
[1:24:17] one we got to look at our lives
[1:24:19] differently we look at our lives
[1:24:21] differently and have love and concern
[1:24:23] for those who are changed
[1:24:26] amen that should be our burden Lord
[1:24:27] loose those chains off my brother loose
[1:24:30] those chains off my sister amen I
[1:24:32] remember when when when when the family
[1:24:34] and I we went to Canada I know I've
[1:24:36] shared this but I'll share it again
[1:24:37] we're there at the youth camp and even
[1:24:39] before we go to the camp you know
[1:24:41] Christine's praying about going and the
[1:24:42] Lord says there's going to be a s spirit
[1:24:44] of suicide there at that camp and there
[1:24:47] was a girl there we didn't know we
[1:24:49] didn't know the people and uh her
[1:24:51] friends came forward for prayer saying
[1:24:53] uh um you know pray for our friend she's
[1:24:56] got this the suicidal Spirit she's tried
[1:24:58] to take her life a couple of times and
[1:25:00] you know pray for her I didn't know she
[1:25:02] was there was she was there I thought
[1:25:03] she was back in I think Quebec wherever
[1:25:05] they were from I can't remember so
[1:25:07] praying for her and then in that same
[1:25:09] service as the after service everyone's
[1:25:11] praying and singing and I think it was
[1:25:13] the song even my chains are gone I can't
[1:25:14] remember which one the spirit of God
[1:25:16] came down and and and and she was set
[1:25:19] free of that suicidal spirit and one of
[1:25:22] her friends who was praying for her at
[1:25:23] that time she said she literally felt
[1:25:25] chains fall at her
[1:25:27] feet so they are
[1:25:30] chains if you're if you're bound if if
[1:25:33] negativity is consuming your
[1:25:36] life that ain't meant to bind you am
[1:25:39] mean that's not you that's the enemy
[1:25:42] amen if there's if there's suicide or
[1:25:43] just the you're empty I'm worthless I'm
[1:25:45] not mean nothing that's not you that's
[1:25:48] not God God would never call you
[1:25:50] that you are the purpose of his being
[1:25:54] he died for you I mean he gave his whole
[1:25:56] life for you he cares very much he's not
[1:25:59] indifferent he's not distant somewhere
[1:26:01] he cares for you more than you realize
[1:26:02] but the devil wants that Janice and
[1:26:04] jamus wants to come along and say no
[1:26:05] you're not important you're just young
[1:26:07] or whatever you've lived your life
[1:26:09] whatever more no you're very important
[1:26:11] to God amen amen but the Rage of those
[1:26:16] guys caused caused Paul caused the Lord
[1:26:19] to be crucified it wasn't the oh the
[1:26:21] Romans killed him no was that spirit it
[1:26:24] was that Christ rejecting Spirit I'm not
[1:26:26] even saying the Jews did it was that
[1:26:28] Christ rejecting Antichrist Spirit
[1:26:29] that's still in the world today caused
[1:26:32] the
[1:26:33] crucifixion it caused Paul to be bound
[1:26:36] but he had to go to Rome so God uses
[1:26:39] everything anyway you see so these
[1:26:43] things hinder or try to
[1:26:48] hinder because there was pressure on the
[1:26:50] people if any man confesses see
[1:26:53] nevertheless among the chief rules also
[1:26:54] believed on him so it wasn't just the
[1:26:57] the common folk in Israel some of the
[1:26:59] chief rulers believed he was the Messiah
[1:27:01] can you imagine you've been studying the
[1:27:02] Torah all your life you know it from jot
[1:27:05] and title from Genesis 1 to Malachi 4
[1:27:09] and 6 you know it you can you can repeat
[1:27:11] it and then you're seeing a man live it
[1:27:14] don't you think that you know don't you
[1:27:16] think that they would put two and two
[1:27:18] together in their
[1:27:19] mind where's he from Bethlehem what
[1:27:22] scripture would come to mind where's
[1:27:24] raised up nazarus where would the
[1:27:26] scripture would come to mine look what
[1:27:27] he's
[1:27:28] doing don't you think there' be two and
[1:27:31] two come together be like hey this I've
[1:27:33] read this this and I believe God would
[1:27:35] actually bring it to their remembrance
[1:27:37] to give them a a space of Mercy to get
[1:27:40] to realize hey this is me doing this
[1:27:42] receive it receive it can you see the
[1:27:44] word living in your midst amen but there
[1:27:47] was precious say because of the
[1:27:48] Pharisees they did not confess unless
[1:27:50] they should be put out of their
[1:27:52] synagogue control
[1:28:00] control amen we go through many
[1:28:03] things but
[1:28:05] sadly as janison that spirit is hard
[1:28:08] ined the world now that doesn't mean the
[1:28:11] elect can't be found out
[1:28:14] there nothing can hold back a child of
[1:28:16] God nothing can hold back a child of God
[1:28:19] but we got to realize that this is the
[1:28:21] reason why the world is so indifferent
[1:28:24] I think it was you know well my
[1:28:26] grandmother so I think it was in the 20s
[1:28:29] or 30s you know they used to have tent
[1:28:31] meetings out the back of Park in East
[1:28:32] Coast there you know she was a Catholic
[1:28:34] but they'd go along there was actually
[1:28:36] in New Zealand there was a genuine
[1:28:39] Christian
[1:28:41] culture right but then now what's come
[1:28:43] to light in all these things the effect
[1:28:45] of Janice and jambus on this nation and
[1:28:48] and it's been around the world look at
[1:28:49] all the scandals of the Catholic
[1:28:51] church is it going to change no she'll
[1:28:54] keep going
[1:28:55] on you know and you know there's been
[1:28:57] this big um you know uh abuse inquiry
[1:29:01] not just among State institutions but
[1:29:03] also religious ones trying to help
[1:29:05] people and all these poor people whose
[1:29:06] lives have been so destroyed because
[1:29:09] they go to a place that can help them
[1:29:10] and their lives just get messed up is
[1:29:13] there is there a real genuine change in
[1:29:16] those
[1:29:18] places you say
[1:29:21] well why did that happen because that
[1:29:25] Spirit not the people that did that
[1:29:26] Spirit anointed people to cause people
[1:29:29] to be damaged and become in a slave hold
[1:29:32] people down but to harden the
[1:29:35] country oh you're like those people oh
[1:29:38] what about them oh you oh I'm a Christ
[1:29:40] oh they say they're Christians too oh
[1:29:43] you talk about Jesus on the cross they
[1:29:44] talk about it too you talk about the
[1:29:46] resurrection they did too oh you sing
[1:29:49] that song they sing it too the same
[1:29:51] thing Janice and jambus did after Moses
[1:29:54] did it casting the rod down became a
[1:29:57] serpent see they can even say the same
[1:29:59] things like us they can do the same
[1:30:01] things like us without the life you see
[1:30:05] but what is it now it's hard it's
[1:30:07] hardened the heart of the
[1:30:12] world people who push a Prosperity
[1:30:17] Gospel H this is hard youo the gospel
[1:30:20] has become big
[1:30:21] business big business around the world
[1:30:24] I mean there's there's there's church
[1:30:26] denominations that literally run
[1:30:28] portions of countries even a papa you
[1:30:31] know the government has asked the big
[1:30:32] like the Catholic 7th Day Adventist and
[1:30:34] Baptist and different ones who got big
[1:30:36] parts of that country Methodist
[1:30:37] different ones and said you need to take
[1:30:40] greater care of the people in your
[1:30:41] regions they have literally
[1:30:44] forfeited parts of their country to
[1:30:46] those churches to look after Healthcare
[1:30:48] education all those
[1:30:50] things it's big business
[1:30:54] you say well it's doing a lot of good
[1:30:56] but people up there say well if I follow
[1:30:59] this and I reject that where am I going
[1:31:02] to get my Healthcare from who's going to
[1:31:04] who's going to educate my children this
[1:31:06] is real problems up there because
[1:31:08] because over there if you leave a church
[1:31:10] you know the whole family is in an
[1:31:12] uproar the village is in an uproar you
[1:31:14] can't just leave one and change to
[1:31:16] another one you certainly can't leave
[1:31:18] denomination and accept the truth
[1:31:19] there's a lot of persecution the
[1:31:20] Believers have faced and continue to
[1:31:23] face face because of
[1:31:25] that and then so now even with the
[1:31:27] prosperity side you
[1:31:29] know people see churches just pulling
[1:31:32] for money they just want to make money
[1:31:34] and it hardens the hearts of the people
[1:31:37] they think these people don't care about
[1:31:38] the ones they're pulling money from they
[1:31:40] just care about their
[1:31:41] wallet that's all they care about they
[1:31:43] don't care about the
[1:31:45] people and it
[1:31:47] hardens the hearts of the
[1:31:51] people but in spite of all those things
[1:31:55] there's still a genuine there's still a
[1:31:57] genuine Lord Jesus Christ there's
[1:31:59] genuine Christians upon Earth I'm just
[1:32:01] going to wrap up with this there's a
[1:32:03] genuine Spirit of Hol of the Holy Ghost
[1:32:05] that creates genuine Christians right so
[1:32:08] this world may be hard you say it's a
[1:32:11] pretty dark picture I say there's
[1:32:13] nothing that can hold back a child of
[1:32:16] God Amen doesn't matter how deep in sin
[1:32:19] Legion Legion had Legions of demons in
[1:32:21] him in the tombs by himself cutting
[1:32:24] himself among the tombs did that stop
[1:32:26] God going his way no did that stop him
[1:32:29] coming out I mean all the religion the
[1:32:32] Apostle Paul had did it stop him coming
[1:32:36] out no sir amen the woman at the well
[1:32:40] the things that she was raised up in and
[1:32:41] trouble and things she had did that stop
[1:32:43] her no cuz when the genuine came her way
[1:32:47] amen God set her free and Friends God's
[1:32:51] hands upon the Earth are your hands God
[1:32:53] God's feet are your feet God's tongue is
[1:32:57] your tongue he wants to use your voice
[1:32:58] your life amen that to to live a genuine
[1:33:02] Christian Life that no matter how hard
[1:33:04] this world is there's still a genuine
[1:33:06] somewhere that when someone looks at you
[1:33:08] in spite of your fault your failures
[1:33:10] your Humanity they see you they say
[1:33:12] there's a genuine Christian I may not
[1:33:14] agree with this with this church stuff
[1:33:17] and the things they do and how they
[1:33:19] dress but there's something in them
[1:33:20] that's real am mean they live what they
[1:33:23] speak
[1:33:24] amen now I I believe I'm
[1:33:27] looking I believe I'm looking at those
[1:33:29] kind of people amen I I sincerely
[1:33:32] believe that amen that there is not a
[1:33:35] that that we are not these

[1:34:01] hard okay but it was prophesied to be
[1:34:04] this
[1:34:05] hard that there be such an indifference
[1:34:08] but in spite of the
[1:34:09] indifference God is here to set the

[1:34:17] is not just our words but it's our life
