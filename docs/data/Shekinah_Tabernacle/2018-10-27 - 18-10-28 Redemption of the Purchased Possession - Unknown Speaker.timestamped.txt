[19:54] amen
[20:05] Ephesians 1 we're gonna read we're gonna
[20:07] read down from verse three familiar
[20:11] piece of scripture to us all I trust but
[20:16] blessed be the God and father of our
[20:19] Lord Jesus Christ to us blessed us with
[20:21] all spiritual blessings in heavenly
[20:23] places in Christ according as he hath
[20:26] chosen us in him before the foundation
[20:27] of the world that we should be holy and
[20:30] without blame before him and loved
[20:31] having predestinated us unto the
[20:34] adoption of children by Jesus Christ to
[20:36] himself according to the good pleasure
[20:38] of his will to the praise of the glory
[20:42] of His grace rouen Heath made us
[20:45] accepted in the beloved and whom we have
[20:47] redemption through his blood the
[20:48] forgiveness of sins according to the
[20:51] riches of His grace ruin he had the
[20:53] bounded toward toward us and all wisdom
[20:56] and prudence having made known unto us
[20:59] the mystery of his will according to his
[21:02] good pleasure which he hath purposed in
[21:04] himself that in the dispensation of the
[21:06] fullness of times he might gather
[21:07] together in one all things in Christ
[21:09] both which are in heaven and which are
[21:12] on earth even in him in whom also we
[21:14] have obtained an inheritance being
[21:16] predestinated according to the purpose
[21:19] of him who worketh all things after the
[21:22] counsel of his own will that we should
[21:25] be to the praise of his glory who first
[21:28] trusted in Christ and whom ye also
[21:30] trusted after that ye heard the word of
[21:33] truth the gospel of your salvation and
[21:35] whom also after that ye believed you are
[21:38] sealed with that holy spirit of promise
[21:39] which is the earnest of our inheritance
[21:41] until the redemption of the purchased
[21:44] possession and to the praise of his
[21:47] glory I mean let's bow our heads in a
[21:49] word of Prayer shall we if you want to
[21:51] be remembered just want to raise your
[21:52] hands to the Lord
[21:53] gracious father we are so glad we can
[21:55] stand on your promises Lord and we just
[21:58] want to thank you we can gather this
[22:00] morning Lord and in your presence and
[22:02] just asking as we have read some of your
[22:04] Holy Scripture I just pray father you
[22:06] just come a night your word father
[22:08] anoint speaker and hear O Lord may your
[22:10] word live in every heart hear father we
[22:13] just want to Lord just want to just
[22:15] surrender the service
[22:16] to your hands Lord me may the service
[22:19] Leaf human control Lord may it just be
[22:21] under your control
[22:22] further may you have preeminence Lord
[22:24] not only here but in all of our lives
[22:26] father because you're a personal God
[22:28] father may we just be your love
[22:30] prisoners to your word and we want to
[22:32] pray father also Lord for the meetings
[22:34] up in Taranaki Lord brother Craig
[22:36] ministering Lord may there be a great
[22:38] revival break out there father bless
[22:40] each one that's attending the services
[22:42] Lord we want to commit our lives into
[22:44] your hands be with those who are sick
[22:46] Lord who those who are not here father
[22:47] be their portion Lord in Jesus Christ's
[22:50] name we ask these things amen
[22:52] I mean god bless you everyone you may
[22:54] have your seats this morning so I want
[22:57] to ice like the first aw I just like to
[22:59] thank brother Isaac again for preaching
[23:01] last Sunday he said at the end of that
[23:03] sermon that he did not use a single
[23:05] quote of brother Branham to show the
[23:07] message that the seventh angel brought
[23:08] was not something outside of Scripture
[23:10] but it is Scripture I mean so what we
[23:12] believe is not something that's added to
[23:14] the scripture it is the scripture right
[23:16] so we want to what I want to go into
[23:19] today is that that I want to speak about
[23:21] the redemption of the purchased
[23:23] possession and that we should be the
[23:26] praise of the glory of His grace as we
[23:28] read here that we are so Paul is
[23:31] speaking that in the fullness of the
[23:33] dispensation of times as we read here he
[23:36] would gather all one in Christ and that
[23:39] we have obtained we are predestinated
[23:41] unto the adoption or to the placing of
[23:44] sons and we are living in the age of
[23:46] adoption where a people will come to
[23:48] their position in Christ that everything
[23:50] that Adam lost in the garden has been
[23:52] restored to man and this is where we
[23:53] want to go today and that so now there's
[23:55] a bride upon the earth that's not living
[23:57] under her privilege she's living
[23:59] according to her privilege in Christ
[24:00] Jesus and I believe this is who we mean
[24:03] to be right so we're not meant to be the
[24:05] devil's footstool or be his puppet
[24:06] driven around by his spirit but he's he
[24:09] at his places under the bride's feet so
[24:12] if the Devils on your case you got to
[24:13] tell them you're out of your position
[24:15] Satan get back under my feet in Jesus
[24:17] Christ name so we have a right to
[24:19] enforce upon Satan everything that Jesus
[24:22] purchased for us he's given us a great
[24:24] inheritance in him and so it's it's it's
[24:27] time for us to really look into what
[24:29] he's given us
[24:30] and to possess it amen so now that that
[24:33] we should be but the whole reason of
[24:35] this is that we should be the praise of
[24:37] his glory now Redemption we know as as
[24:40] the act of saving or being safe from sin
[24:43] evil or error and it's the action of
[24:46] regaining or gaining possession of
[24:47] something in exchange for payment or
[24:49] clearing a debt so to be redeemed now is
[24:53] not just a not just a nice phrase but
[24:55] it's a reality where a people have been
[24:59] redeemed from the clutches of Satan and
[25:01] you can see that redemption in their
[25:03] lives right it's not a just a phrase or
[25:06] something nice when we talk about but
[25:08] it's a reality I have been redeemed I
[25:10] was bought with a price
[25:11] so one time I was under the spirit of
[25:14] this world walk he could in a prince of
[25:16] the power of the air but as but the
[25:18] blood of Jesus Christ loosed me from his
[25:20] clutches and I'm not in prison anymore
[25:22] I'm free right so so Redemption is a
[25:25] reality I mean you know as we read that
[25:28] we would be the praise of his glory that
[25:29] we should be the praise of his glory I
[25:31] mean that that that has that what he has
[25:33] done his work should be manifested in us
[25:36] that we would we would bring forth as
[25:38] price thank you I'm free Thank You being
[25:40] redeemed
[25:41] thank you your word has become a living
[25:43] reality in my life
[25:44] I mean so the bride today is no longer a
[25:47] slave to anything right the bride of
[25:50] Jesus Christ is an independent woman as
[25:52] brother Brown says she's not hooked up
[25:54] with any of man's ideas man's Creed's
[25:55] man's organization she's a free she's a
[25:58] free woman amen so she's not hooked up
[26:01] with anything but Jesus Christ the
[26:03] Living Word right so to be if we're no
[26:06] longer slaves I mean we are completely
[26:09] free I mean so the bride has been has
[26:11] been washed of any religion of man
[26:13] fashions of this world
[26:15] entertainments whatever may be culture
[26:17] we are free of all things
[26:19] Allu you now someone who is free acts
[26:24] completely different to someone who's a
[26:26] slave or a prisoner right someone who is
[26:28] a prisoner cannot you know they you know
[26:31] the warden tells them what they do you
[26:33] know they're there they're pressed into
[26:35] a mold where this do this you know and
[26:37] they have no freedom in themselves but
[26:39] so and and they're stuck in prison bars
[26:41] behind prison bars and they
[26:43] want to be there but the nature that we
[26:46] were born with wanted us to be there
[26:48] right because we united with this world
[26:50] by our first birth that's why you've got
[26:52] to be born again that's why your spirits
[26:54] got to be change that's why that
[26:55] laughing is going to come forth I mean
[26:57] because your first birth you were born
[26:59] wrong we were born in slaves in sin
[27:03] shape that iniquity come to the world
[27:04] speaking lies that's why we were to be
[27:06] born again hallelujah that we that we
[27:09] would receive the right life I mean to
[27:12] someone who's in prison it's very
[27:14] different to someone who's free and
[27:15] those who are free are free to walk with
[27:18] God hallelujah now in the Old Testament
[27:21] they had the jubilee trumpet and the
[27:24] jubilee trumpet when it sounded those
[27:26] who heard it had a right to go free they
[27:30] drop what they were doing there they're
[27:32] their slave master or whoever it was
[27:34] that they're in bondage to they don't
[27:36] have to listen to that voice anymore
[27:38] they heard another voice they heard
[27:40] another call so they had the right to
[27:42] drop immediately what they are doing and
[27:43] walk free and it's the same thing now
[27:46] but they had to choose to do it right if
[27:49] they chose not to do it then and and
[27:52] they preferred to stay with their master
[27:53] then they would be taken to the table
[27:55] bored in the air with an awl and they
[27:57] were a slave for the rest of their days
[27:59] so they had to they had to choose to be
[28:02] free and that's a thing this world the
[28:04] devil's made this world's very
[28:06] comfortable he's made it very
[28:08] comfortable that we don't want to you
[28:09] know that that many people want to stay
[28:11] in the muck and mire of slavery but
[28:13] there's a call and if you want to go
[28:15] free you can't go free and walk with God
[28:18] you have a choice right
[28:21] the Jubilee trumpet today is the gospel
[28:23] trumpet it is this message that is
[28:25] blasted forth amen
[28:27] I know one day I heard freedom when I
[28:30] heard this mess it depends where you're
[28:32] listening you may hear a man from
[28:34] Kentucky but I pray you heard the voice
[28:36] behind the voice and I heard freedom you
[28:38] don't the stay in bondage you read the
[28:40] Saints stay in slavery you can go free
[28:42] if you chose and something in me says
[28:44] that sounds just right I'm sick of being
[28:47] stuck in this state being bound by Satan
[28:49] I want to walk with God and I went free
[28:51] hallelujah and so this is this is part
[28:54] of Redemption where people have been
[28:57] purchased
[28:58] you know if something is yours it's your
[29:00] property right you don't share it with
[29:03] anyone if you've paid it off and full
[29:04] it's yours right and you have legal
[29:06] right to do what you want with that
[29:08] piece of property because it belongs to
[29:10] you
[29:10] right no one can tell you what to do it
[29:12] belongs you and you have the proof you
[29:14] have the paperwork to prove it's mine
[29:16] right and so God the bride we are not
[29:19] our own we are brought with a price and
[29:21] that's the part that's the blood of
[29:23] Jesus Christ so god when he became a man
[29:26] to die in our place to redeem us he was
[29:29] laying claim on his children these are
[29:31] mine Satan they do not belong to you
[29:33] they're never your property I am laying
[29:35] claim to what is mine hallelujah and
[29:38] this message is a claiming message grace
[29:40] placing his hand upon his bride
[29:42] Satan lists woman's mind I'll not share
[29:45] her with you she doesn't belong to you
[29:48] she has no part in you and you have no
[29:50] part in her and we have to come to that
[29:52] realization friends we don't belong to
[29:54] the devil we have no part in him here's
[29:57] no part in us we have no luck with him
[29:59] he don't we don't belong to him in any
[30:00] way in any fashion doesn't matter how
[30:02] big or small we are not his hallelujah
[30:06] that's why I'm glad the word is a
[30:08] separator
[30:09] it separates some unto and some away I'm
[30:12] just being glad I'll be separate to the
[30:14] Lord by the Word of God hallelujah so we
[30:17] should just rejoice hey man he sees in
[30:20] Revelations 3 and 20 behold I stand at
[30:22] the door and knock who is behind the
[30:24] door we were behind that door I mean we
[30:27] know Christ has kicked out of the
[30:28] religious system of this day but we were
[30:30] locked in there
[30:31] if any man hear my voice who's heard his
[30:35] voice and open the door that's your
[30:37] doing you would open the door look come
[30:40] and dwell in me I will come in them and
[30:42] sup with him and he with me
[30:44] hallelujah you know I'm glad we're
[30:51] living that out hallelujah amen so we're
[30:55] not our own were bought with a price
[30:57] Jesus isn't Luke 19 and 10 for the Son
[31:00] of man has come to seek and save that
[31:01] which was lost I mean so he sought you
[31:04] out hallelujah because you are lost now
[31:07] God wants to restore Adam's fallen race
[31:10] now we read in Ephesians that we were
[31:16] let's just put that back up here it is
[31:18] that year sealed with the Holy Spirit of
[31:21] promise which is the earnest and that
[31:24] would earn astiz the pledge you like a
[31:26] down payment of our inheritance and
[31:28] their word inheritance means airship so
[31:31] we had joint ears let's our inheritance
[31:33] so we have a position in Christ until
[31:35] the redemption of the purchased position
[31:38] and to the praise of his glory so he
[31:40] knows that ultimately the fullness of
[31:42] our redemption is the change of our body
[31:43] right with what we have received that
[31:46] bride has received a down payment right
[31:48] the Holy Spirit in our soul as a down
[31:50] pat it's a pledge God's given you a
[31:52] promise by giving you his spirit I what
[31:55] I began I will complete and it will be
[31:58] completed with the change of your body I
[32:00] mean that the life that ye receive that
[32:02] quickening power in you is the power
[32:04] that will change this body holy that
[32:06] you'll leave this dimension go to the
[32:08] next now in order to redeem the right
[32:10] price must be paid and the right price
[32:13] was paid I mean the blood of Jesus
[32:15] Christ the blood of God was shed upon
[32:17] the earth that was the that was the
[32:19] purchasing price hallelujah but then the
[32:23] second thing now because God doesn't
[32:25] want a dispute right he doesn't want the
[32:27] devil's the devil's the accuser of the
[32:29] Brethren he wants to he want to try and
[32:31] find a foothold and doesn't matter how
[32:33] small said that he can lay claims on you
[32:35] and by your first birth he had claims on
[32:38] you right by by the new birth all that
[32:40] is struck off then he has no claims on
[32:42] you no more and an order for a for
[32:45] something to be bought first the right
[32:47] price must be paid but then also
[32:51] anything what is what that what that
[32:55] sorry that piece of property there has
[32:58] to be a search on that piece of property
[32:59] that any historical dispute has to be
[33:03] struck off right and once those disputes
[33:06] have been settled then the piece of
[33:07] property can go into the hands of the
[33:09] one who purchased it right so now God
[33:12] made sure that every claim the devil
[33:14] could have on the believer was struck
[33:16] off and we're living in that our right
[33:19] the bride everything's been struck off
[33:20] you hallelujah
[33:22] we're going to realize where our free
[33:23] people this morning
[33:24] I mean it's just like buying a pre piece
[33:27] of property a title search is done on
[33:29] that property to make sure there is no
[33:31] dispute on who would own it Alou you God
[33:35] gives us that he says in the Easter seal
[33:38] and God gives you a promise potentially
[33:40] and you'll receive it and you're going
[33:41] to be raised up this body's going to be
[33:43] glorified with him at the end time but
[33:46] you see you have to have a clearance on
[33:48] that deed and the clearances win
[33:50] everything against it's been stricken
[33:52] off and you've got the abstract to it
[33:54] you've got the seal it's yours
[33:55] everything in it belongs to you amen and
[33:58] when you believe on Jesus Christ our
[34:00] Savior and repent in a baptized and come
[34:03] up to believe him God recognizes our
[34:05] repentance and our faith towards them
[34:06] sends down the abstract which is the
[34:09] Holy Ghost and the abstract is the
[34:10] assurance is the guarantee that
[34:12] everything that it was ever held against
[34:14] you you thoroughly repented wholly and
[34:17] the property is bought and you hold the
[34:18] abstract for the insurance let somebody
[34:21] try and put you off the land say he
[34:24] belongs and you with the abstract in
[34:26] your hand let him try to do it there
[34:28] ain't a law in the land can do it
[34:29] because you hold the abstract and
[34:31] there's no devil no church or any
[34:33] theology they could overstep the
[34:35] boundaries of God's proof and abstract
[34:37] that the baptism of the holy ghost has
[34:39] recognized us in Christ Jesus we're just
[34:42] as sure to raise as he raised because
[34:44] potentially we're already raised in him
[34:47] amen so when God gives us the Holy
[34:50] Spirit he's actually showing everything
[34:51] that the devil lays claim on you has
[34:53] been struck off I mean everything that
[34:55] he said on but they did this and they
[34:57] believe this and they are born this
[34:58] wrong way that's all been struck off the
[35:00] bride how loose that's why we can stand
[35:03] with a with a clear abstract deed is
[35:06] everyone following what I'm saying we
[35:08] can stand and and the devil can't push
[35:10] us around

[35:13] evidence I mean that we've been redeemed

[39:56] believed amen that's why you know you
[40:00] know the Apostles they came under great
[40:02] pressure but they had an abstract deed
[40:04] they had something the rich young ruler
[40:05] didn't have they had something that the
[40:08] scribes and Pharisees didn't have they
[40:09] had the assurance of eternal life and
[40:11] that's why they could stand in front the
[40:13] Sanhedrin who should we please mean Oh
[40:15] God
[40:15] who should we follow mean and God you
[40:17] tell us hallelujah amen and that's why
[40:22] we can stand like them doesn't matter
[40:23] what pressure comes on intimidation
[40:25] whatever more no I'm a believer I'm a
[40:28] believer and the reason I believers cuz
[40:30] I met him he was there I was there we
[40:33] became one Poli yeah me and my me and
[40:36] his would became one I trust it's the
[40:38] same thing with you

[40:42] life out of the blood that comes what
[40:44] does that and what what does that life
[40:47] does comes and confirms that the tokens
[40:50] been purchased for that token confirms
[40:53] that the blood that the blood brought
[40:55] for you the blood purchased your
[40:58] Redemption the token is the evidence of
[41:00] at the blood he was wounded for our
[41:02] transgressions bruised for our
[41:03] iniquities the chastisement of our peace
[41:05] was upon him with the stripes we were
[41:07] healed see blood blood blood
[41:09] then when the token comes it shows
[41:10] you're identified with that sacrifice
[41:13] hallelujah Amen the devil can't keep you
[41:15] from it that's when I stand at the
[41:17] platform here to face everything there
[41:19] is and around the world and devils God's
[41:21] Word promise that as long as I know that
[41:24] the Bloods been applied and holding that
[41:26] Holy Spirit here in my heart the devil
[41:28] has not one word to say against that yes
[41:31] sir we'll walk with the apostles of trod
[41:33] yes sir because the token paid the way
[41:35] the token is the evidence that the ways
[41:38] been paid for and we have accepted it
[41:40] and to prove it God gave us the token
[41:42] the sign that we was received who's been
[41:45] received hallelujah to God Amen now as I
[41:50] said that we have a purchase that we
[41:53] have an inheritance or an issue now we
[41:58] know the reason Jesus died to redeem his
[42:00] bride is that he wants to restore Adam
[42:03] and Eve in the garden again right so he
[42:06] wants to restore a people he's the
[42:07] second Adam there's got to be a second
[42:09] even as the Bride of Christ from Calvary
[42:11] down to now as the multi-member D the
[42:14] bride and he wants to take these people
[42:16] and he wants to restore the
[42:18] I'm back to what a de nieve were in the
[42:19] beginning right as he's he's the adamant
[42:23] and we're the eve right so now if that's
[42:26] the case Adam and Eve had dominion over
[42:28] the earth right they had Dominion they
[42:31] were told subdue it
[42:32] you know you're in charge of this place
[42:34] everything upon the earth was under
[42:36] their rulership and this is and that's
[42:39] what God wants to do is he wants to take
[42:41] your people when the devil still here
[42:43] wins sinners rampant when darkness
[42:45] covers the earth but taking people to
[42:47] manifest as victory to show that there's
[42:49] a people that have been redeemed that
[42:51] everything upon this earth is under
[42:53] their feet I mean what good would it be
[42:55] if that you're you know of God just died
[42:58] on Calvary for us and then the devil got
[43:00] deleted he just disappeared and this is
[43:02] all what a wonderful victory my children
[43:04] have now there's no enemy to face right
[43:07] there victory can't be proved but he
[43:09] allowed it to be the darkest of ages the
[43:11] darkest have time the most deceptive
[43:13] time that there is upon the earth that's
[43:15] when his bride comes to a full maturity
[43:17] halia because God wants to show the
[43:19] devil this is what my offering did this
[43:22] is what my blood does this is what my
[43:24] word transferred through a profit vessel
[43:26] a man received into a heart of faith
[43:28] does hallelujah he was assures victory
[43:34] you know we like to you know people
[43:37] wouldn't great great things and they
[43:39] celebrate they do or more that's just a
[43:41] little shadow compared to God what
[43:43] happened are we off away on we wrong
[43:47] amen you have not received the spirit of
[43:50] bondage again to fear but you ever seen
[44:27] the family I can I can sign some papers
[44:31] now they're adopted into my family now
[44:33] they're one of my children placing so
[45:10] now we are living in a we are living in
[45:13] an abduction H we are where the we're
[45:16] the first church change as the Apostle
[45:18] Paul said in Ephesians four is till we
[45:21] all come to the fullness of the stature
[45:23] the image of Christ to a perfect man so
[45:25] they hadn't come there yet but they were
[45:27] pointing towards that but in the word
[45:29] Ephesus means to a men into relax
[45:32] so they and get the high call in Christ
[45:34] but then they relaxed and then
[45:35] eventually the church went down to the
[45:37] dark age now brother Graham says we've
[45:39] come to Ephesians again right the bride
[45:42] has come through in Ephesians and
[45:43] Ephesians is the placing of a people in
[45:46] the body
[45:47] the book of Joshua parallels the book of
[45:50] Ephesians Joshua's ministry was to fight
[45:52] tribes in the land right that they would
[45:54] drive out the inhabitants and that would
[45:56] be placed in the land
[45:58] so what Martha's preached on the
[46:00] mountain I mean will become men
[46:02] officious people would go to the land
[46:04] and possess their here right and now we
[46:06] have received the Josh
[47:23] in direction because God's placing you
[47:26] on the body
[47:27] Allu amen so now we're joint is joint is
[47:32] with Christ now under thee under the
[47:34] blood of bulls and goats when you read
[47:37] the law you see that woman in Israel
[47:39] were second-class citizens to the man
[47:41] but then and that was showing that the
[47:45] blood of bulls and goats could not
[47:46] elevate the church to be joint heirs
[47:48] with Christ with God they were under
[47:50] here but now under the blood of Jesus
[47:53] Christ as as as Peter writes one of his
[47:57] epistles that the man and the woman a
[47:59] joint is together right so he's showing
[48:02] now that the woman the bride is not a
[48:04] second-class citizen but the blood
[48:06] elevates her to be joint is are you
[48:09] following me so now there's a so now
[48:11] we've been elevated we're not seeking
[48:13] class citizens in the kingdom Alleluia
[48:16] he's made us join here so he called you
[48:18] out of darkness this is read
[48:20] his word called you out of darkness he
[48:23] purchased your salvation holy that's why
[48:25] faith when you really see Calvary it's
[48:27] more than a story you see it I mean you
[48:30] know it happened you don't you don't you
[48:32] haven't lent it right real faith is not
[48:35] learning something real faith is seeing
[48:38] it real faith is knowing it to be a
[48:40] reality
[48:40] holy is a win when the crust becomes a
[48:43] reality to you do you see it you realize
[48:45] he he's your Redeemer
[48:47] I mean he's purchased your salvation it
[48:49] changes your trust it change you holy
[48:52] and he's showing now I'm gonna take your
[48:53] purchase you now I'm gonna place you

[48:58] the devil place you above the works of
[49:00] this world place you above any bondage
[49:02] of sin that you'd have dominion over all
[49:04] the works of the devil

[52:00] secret things will be revealed the dark
[52:02] things will be made plain we shall know
[52:04] as we are knowing and we shall be like
[52:06] him this is the heritage of the
[52:08] overcomer who has overcome by the blood
[52:09] of the Lamb and the word of testimony to
[52:12] Jesus Christ how we long for that day
[52:15] when the crooked roads will be
[52:16] straightened and we will be with them
[52:18] time without end may that day hasten its
[52:20] appearance and may we hastened to obey
[52:22] his word and thereby prove our
[52:25] worthiness to share his glory he that
[52:27] hath an ear let him hear what the spirit
[52:28] saith unto the churches
[52:30] how tragic it is in this first age did
[52:32] not listen to the spirit and see it
[52:34] listened to men but thank God in the
[52:37] last age there will be a group rise up
[52:39] the true bride of the last day and she
[52:41] will listen to the spirit and that day
[52:44] of gross darkness the light will reach
[52:45] turn by the pure word and they will
[52:48] return to the power of Pentecost to
[52:50] welcome back the Lord Jesus Christ
[52:52] hallelujah I I believe I'm looking at
[52:55] some of them I mean that they obey the
[52:58] spur because you're a spurt breath
[52:59] witness with him his spirit is the word
[53:02] right so a spurt brace would assume that
[53:04] we are the sons of God because a spurt
[53:06] agrees with all the word hallelujah so
[53:08] she will obey the spirit and you're glad
[53:10] to obey his spirit you look at see as I
[53:13] said make the valley full of ditches how
[53:15] much water do you want people people
[53:17] want the blessing but they don't want
[53:19] the sacrifice but if you really want the
[53:21] blessing you'll give the sacrifice
[53:23] hallelujah that we can walk with the
[53:25] apostles of trod it's worth it I tell
[53:28] you
[53:28] amen so they will return to the power of
[53:31] Pentecost to welcome back the Lord Jesus
[53:32] Christ and we have been restored back to
[53:35] everything the first church had right
[53:37] before the before the Ephesian Age
[53:39] started and I think 1865 whatever it was
[53:42] there was a period of time where the
[53:45] church hadn't begun to fall right we're
[53:47] being restored back to that hallelujah
[53:50] amen we have received a spirit of
[53:53] adoption or placing in the body amen now
[53:56] as I said this is the place or the
[53:58] position that man fell from the
[54:00] beginning now Adam and Eve before the
[54:02] fall down owners Adam Wright Eve was
[54:05] only named Eve after the fall which
[54:07] means the mother of all living
[54:08] right so they all caught by one name
[54:11] they were in perfect harmony before the
[54:13] fall and they had dominion over all the
[54:15] earth
[54:16] that was before the fall and this is
[54:18] what we are now hallelujah this is this
[54:21] is who we are now there's harmony
[54:24] between the bride and Christ right there
[54:27] is a harmony we have our battles but
[54:29] that that that doesn't correspond to a
[54:32] tension between our us and our Savior
[54:34] right sometimes we you know we need to
[54:36] demarcate very clearly I'm in a trial
[54:38] that doesn't mean your connection with
[54:40] God's not there that doesn't mean that
[54:42] relationships under strain right that
[54:44] actually means relationships good
[54:46] hallelujah Amen so now we need to eat to
[54:50] rejoice my Bible tells me he broke down
[54:53] the middle wall of partition he
[54:56] abolished in his flesh the enmity
[54:58] a lot of commandments contained in
[54:59] ordinances for to make in himself of
[55:01] twain one new man so making peace that's
[55:04] what my Bible says about me what he did
[55:06] then he might reconcile both under God
[55:08] and one body by the cross having slain
[55:10] the enmity they're buying and came and
[55:13] preached peace to you which were far off
[55:14] and to them that were nigh for through
[55:17] him we both have access by one spirit
[55:19] unto the father hallelujah we're no more
[55:22] strangers or citizens but fellow
[55:23] citizens with the Saints of the
[55:25] household of God that's what my Bible
[55:27] tells me see so the Lord tells me
[55:29] there's nothing between me and you right
[55:32] we've become one he you know the Apostle
[55:36] Paul speaks about the mystery of Christ
[55:39] and his church's husband and wife -
[55:40] becoming one flesh amen and we're living
[55:44] out that minute at that mystery right so
[55:47] we're one so they're in perfect harmony
[55:50] when you die to yourself you you enter
[55:53] into perfect harmony with God
[55:55] right because it's no more how do you
[55:57] know you're redeemed you no longer once
[55:59] your own will because you surrendered
[56:00] your will over to him right the second
[56:03] Adam Jesus Jesus Christ manifested
[56:05] everything the first Adam was he had
[56:07] power over nature he also showed us God
[56:10] by having power over the devil and all
[56:12] sickness and death itself and they were
[56:15] and so as Adam and Eve were called Adam
[56:18] before the fall so Christ and His Word
[56:21] bright is called the name of the
[56:23] bridegroom Jesus Christ amen in the
[56:26] bride only does his will amen
[56:29] yes sir amen so now we've come to a
[56:32] place where we are joint heirs with him
[56:37] now see here in 1st Corinthians 11 and 7
[56:40] for a man indeed ought to not cover his
[56:43] head for as much as he is the image and
[56:45] glory of God but the woman is the glory
[56:48] of the man so now just like in a natural
[56:53] marriage the woman is the revelation of
[56:55] the man so really what what the man what
[56:58] is in the man's hat will be in the woman
[57:00] will be manifested in her if there one
[57:02] right so now we are the glory so so the
[57:07] woman is the glory of the man so so how
[57:09] we treat our wives husbands I wish
[57:11] is she really our glory what do we think
[57:14] of ourselves right and so now if that is
[57:18] just naturally that's why when people
[57:20] put their wives out like prostitutes on
[57:23] the street dressed up as the world
[57:24] they're not really considering that
[57:26] their wife is the glory as they glory
[57:28] right because God doesn't want to share
[57:30] our ice with no body why would we share
[57:33] our wives with anybody on the street
[57:34] because to look upon a woman lust after
[57:37] her she sure you've committed adultery
[57:38] in your heart already right so if God
[57:41] saying no I'll not share her with
[57:43] anything he doesn't want to share you
[57:45] with anyone right he's not a yo-yo yo-yo
[57:49] he doesn't say the devil well you can
[57:50] have wrong winds they are all heaven for
[57:52] the rest of the week that's not how it
[57:53] works he is jealous of you with a godly
[57:56] jealousy he's jealous over you
[57:58] he's protective hallelujah he doesn't
[58:01] want the devil to handle you in any way
[58:03] now if that is you know if that is the
[58:06] heavenly how much more should that that
[58:09] should be they'll be manifested in the
[58:10] earthly right if God is as I said of God
[58:14] if you know redemption husbands fathers
[58:17] then that redemption will be manifested
[58:19] through you to your family right you'll
[58:21] want to lift them up not not tread them
[58:24] down lift them up Oh God
[58:26] reach through me to my children reach
[58:28] through me to my wife then that the
[58:31] revelation I have of you will become
[58:32] manifested in them
[58:34] Pulu yeah that's why it's such a danger
[58:36] we don't want to learn someone's
[58:38] revelation we want to receive the same
[58:40] revelation they have right you don't
[58:42] want to learn my revelation or even the
[58:44] prophets revelation you want to receive
[58:46] the same real revelation he had you
[58:48] following me right we can learn it's
[58:50] like it's like the Apostle Paul this is
[58:53] the revelation of Jesus Christ
[58:54] many people just learn the revelation we
[58:57] don't want to just learn it we want the
[58:59] same God that gave them the revelation
[59:01] gave give us the revelation of the word
[59:03] same thing with the prophets message
[59:06] Amen sanella
[59:08] that's how we should be so the woman is
[59:10] the glory of the man so the bride is the
[59:12] glory of the Lord Jesus
[59:14] this is glory this is praise this is
[59:17] what he's made hallelujah so now if the
[59:19] woman is the glory of the man then the
[59:21] woman will not be beaten down brother
[59:24] so the vision of us of a woman that
[59:27] looked like his mom but wasn't his mom
[59:29] and a man with a three-sided club that
[59:30] looked like his damn it wasn't as dead
[59:32] and every time the woman tried to get
[59:34] back up this man would beat her down
[59:35] with the club for that three-sided club
[59:37] that trinitarian spirit Club because
[59:40] because that woman and the vision was
[59:42] that was the bride wanting to rise up
[59:44] and she couldn't rise up cuz that spirit
[59:47] was beating her down but then he said no
[59:49] you got to deal with me and face my
[59:50] faith muscles built out hallelujah and
[59:53] then and that spirit had to steep back
[59:55] right should be the same thing with us
[59:57] friends I mean we don't want to beat our
[59:59] families don't want to lift them up
[1:00:01] hallelujah that's why I see father's
[1:00:05] don't provoke children to anger at least
[1:00:07] they'd be discouraged right they get
[1:00:10] frustrated I can never please this man
[1:00:12] therefore I can never please God so
[1:00:13] what's the point we don't want to be
[1:00:15] like that we need wisdom I mean so the
[1:00:18] woman is the glory of the man hallelujah
[1:00:21] so now the bride is the glory of Jesus
[1:00:24] Christ this is what he thinks of you and
[1:00:27] the citizen from desperations he sees in
[1:00:32] the Holy Ghost as the token that the
[1:00:33] blood has been applied because it
[1:00:35] follows the blood all the way from the
[1:00:37] book of redemption see that was the
[1:00:40] purpose of us coming that's what he
[1:00:41] followed in every age every age he has
[1:00:43] followed that to see that it's brought
[1:00:45] forth and they could not be perfect this
[1:00:48] is speaking of the whole whole bride
[1:00:50] through seven Church ages every age has
[1:00:52] followed that to see what it's brought
[1:00:54] forth and they could not be made perfect
[1:00:55] without us and now the entire Holy
[1:00:58] Spirit visits the church making God and
[1:01:00] human flesh as he did before Sodom the
[1:01:03] burning there which was a type then
[1:01:05] Abraham he appeared to him and all the
[1:01:07] things that he hasn't done down through
[1:01:09] the ages of the church age he is now
[1:01:11] doing back to the word because the
[1:01:14] messages and the messages and the
[1:01:16] messages has to wind up in the entire
[1:01:18] word and in the last days the seven
[1:01:20] seals being open was to pick up every
[1:01:22] straggle that's been left off in it and
[1:01:24] make the whole thing in one great body
[1:01:27] of the bride that them who lived back
[1:01:29] there were was not perfect until this
[1:01:31] church be perfected this bride group and
[1:01:34] the last days to bring them in and all
[1:01:37] together be take
[1:01:38] upsie it's how important is for us to
[1:01:41] come to our position right because when
[1:01:43] we come to our position in Christ then
[1:01:44] now come out of the grave the life in
[1:01:47] you will bring them forth hallelujah
[1:01:49] isn't that wonderful you say well Lord I
[1:01:52] can't do it he doesn't want you to do it
[1:01:53] he wants to do it you just gotta yield
[1:01:55] yourself to his word to his spirit and
[1:01:57] it will manifest in you I mean if you've
[1:02:00] been cooled out Egypt we're not here
[1:02:02] just to die in a wilderness we call the
[1:02:04] garbage Jordan and not just go over
[1:02:05] Jordan but take the whole land
[1:02:07] hallelujah take our entire inheritance
[1:02:10] the token Jesus Christ the Holy Spirit
[1:02:13] is among us we should reverence that we
[1:02:15] can't humble ourselves enough taking off
[1:02:18] your shoes you're getting on your knees
[1:02:19] wouldn't expel it wouldn't satisfy it
[1:02:21] wouldn't suffice it but a life that now
[1:02:23] brings forth the fruit of the Spirit now
[1:02:25] what is the fruit of the Spirit see love
[1:02:27] joy and peace longsuffering so forth
[1:02:29] holy that's why it's so incredible he's
[1:02:32] among us Jesus Christ is among us to
[1:02:35] manifest his word in us hallelujah
[1:02:39] now Daniel Daniel was seeing when these
[1:02:44] things would be and now we will daniel
[1:02:48] was seeing when these things were
[1:02:49] because he saw until the time of the end
[1:02:50] and he and and here's desiring he's and
[1:02:55] and he's told many shall sleep in the
[1:02:57] dust of the earth shall awake some to
[1:02:59] everlasting life and some to shame and
[1:03:01] everlasting contempt and they that be
[1:03:03] wise shall shine as the brightness of
[1:03:05] the firmament and they that turn away
[1:03:07] and they didn't turn away to
[1:03:09] righteousness as stars for ever and ever
[1:03:10] but Thou O Daniel shut up the words and
[1:03:13] seal the book even to the time of the
[1:03:14] end
[1:03:14] many shall run to and fro and knowledge
[1:03:16] shall be increased so Daniel Caesars
[1:03:19] vision to the timely anyone's and see
[1:03:20] when it's going to be God says it's
[1:03:22] sealed up but it will be made known and
[1:03:24] the time of the end where many shall run
[1:03:27] to and fro travel around the world are
[1:03:30] we living that day don't we and
[1:03:31] knowledge shall be increased where are
[1:03:34] we from the last you go back a hundred
[1:03:35] years world will one finishes you know
[1:03:38] they just had those rudiment you know
[1:03:40] technology was very basic narrower in
[1:03:43] space it wasn't that long from you know
[1:03:45] from from 1918 it wasn't that long till
[1:03:48] people were in space technology advanced
[1:03:51] and such
[1:03:51] Gracie's and this time the book will
[1:03:53] come open now it says that and they that
[1:03:56] be wise shall shine as the brightness of
[1:03:59] the firmament now of the firm permanent
[1:04:01] as it speaks of not only the sky but
[1:04:04] also the heavens and what's that that
[1:04:06] shows is the brightness up there is the
[1:04:08] Stars so those that are and the stars we
[1:04:11] know the stars represent you it's also
[1:04:14] God's first Bible right so all those
[1:04:17] stars have to be in position that that
[1:04:20] it it speaks the Bible right so every
[1:04:23] and it speaks of your position in Christ
[1:04:25] so what so those stars represent you and
[1:04:28] a falling star attracts a lot of
[1:04:30] attention but it's falling but those
[1:04:32] that are in their position all those
[1:04:33] that are together they they speak the
[1:04:36] plan of redemption right so those that
[1:04:38] are those that are wise show-cell shall
[1:04:42] shine as them right so they come into
[1:04:44] their position in Christ and they're now
[1:04:46] manifesting what they should be in
[1:04:48] Christ the word you follow me so those
[1:04:50] that are wise and we know there's no
[1:04:53] that's not worldly wisdom that's
[1:04:55] god-given wisdom he's saying that in
[1:04:57] that time the book will be open the
[1:05:00] inheritance everything Adam lost will
[1:05:02] come open he says this again in Daniel
[1:05:04] 12 and 8 I know these may be
[1:05:05] foundational but here we are and I heard
[1:05:08] but I understood not then said I o my
[1:05:10] lord what shall be the end of these
[1:05:12] things he said go thy way Daniel for the
[1:05:15] words are closed up and sealed to the
[1:05:16] time of the end many shall be purified
[1:05:18] and made white and tried but the wicked
[1:05:20] shall do wickedly and none of the wicked
[1:05:22] shall understand but the wise shall
[1:05:24] understand
[1:05:25] hallelujah trust you've been purified
[1:05:27] and made white and tried hallelujah the
[1:05:30] trial of our faith Amen so he's speaking
[1:05:33] of a future time now here we come to the
[1:05:37] time of the end
[1:05:39] John we understand represents the Bride
[1:05:42] of Christ he comes down through seven
[1:05:44] Church Ages and he's taken up to a door
[1:05:46] and him and he's opened up into an
[1:05:47] eternal realm and then this place he
[1:05:49] sees he sees God on the throne and the
[1:05:52] four and twenty elders around the throw
[1:05:53] and the cherubs I mean yeah yeah you're
[1:05:57] the cherubims
[1:05:58] and he sees in the right hand of him
[1:06:00] that sat upon the throne a book sealed
[1:06:01] on the backside sealed with seven seals
[1:06:05] this is everything Adam lost right
[1:06:07] there's all symbolic was everything Adam
[1:06:08] lost and I saw a strong angel
[1:06:10] proclaiming with a loud voice who's
[1:06:12] worthy to open the book and to loose the
[1:06:13] seals thereof and no man in heaven nor
[1:06:16] in earth neither under the earth was
[1:06:17] able to open the book neither to look
[1:06:20] thereon so no man was seen to be found
[1:06:23] worthy all the prophets were there the
[1:06:24] redeemed her around there but no one's
[1:06:26] there that's found to be worthy and
[1:06:28] here's John who laid on Christ's bosom
[1:06:32] you know saw him being take away to be
[1:06:34] crucified saw him resurrected but now
[1:06:36] he's weeping because he knows if no man
[1:06:39] has found worthy to take this book
[1:06:40] everything's in jeopardy right this book
[1:06:44] represents you well cuz when brother
[1:06:46] Browns preaching in the breach he goes
[1:06:49] he goes to bow is taking Ruth amen
[1:06:52] any-any saying that this act is the same
[1:06:55] as that act where bow is a redeems Ruth
[1:06:58] marries her hallelujah redeems her from
[1:07:02] who would I hurt then now now she comes
[1:07:05] in Amen it becomes part of the promise
[1:07:07] of God by uniting herself with Boaz now
[1:07:10] she's part of the economy of Israel
[1:07:13] hallelujah
[1:07:14] so now brother Graham says this is the
[1:07:15] most sublime act in all the scripture
[1:07:17] the Lamb taking the book hallelujah
[1:07:20] because this is God this is this is the
[1:07:22] lamb because now what let's just let's
[1:07:24] just read as I wept much because no man
[1:07:26] was found worthy to open to read the
[1:07:28] book neither to look thereon and one of
[1:07:30] the elders he had to be weak not behold
[1:07:33] the Lion of the tribe of Judah the root
[1:07:34] of David hath prevailed to open the book
[1:07:36] and to loose the seven seals thereof and
[1:07:38] I beheld and lo in the midst of the
[1:07:40] throne and the four beasts and the midst
[1:07:42] of the elders stood a lamb as it had
[1:07:44] been slain having seven horns and seven
[1:07:46] eyes which are the seven spirits of
[1:07:48] spirits of God that went forth into all
[1:07:50] the earth so he looks again he sees this
[1:07:52] lamb appear hallelujah now here he comes
[1:07:56] and this is why it's so it's so
[1:07:58] important Jesus purchased our salvation
[1:08:01] but then he purchased but now it comes
[1:08:04] to claim right and this is what is
[1:08:07] happening in this day thank God our Lord
[1:08:09] Jesus is laying claim on his bride and
[1:08:11] taking her and placing her in her
[1:08:14] rightful position as joint heirs with
[1:08:16] him right and that's why this is such an
[1:08:19] important scene because now without the
[1:08:22] lamb with that our Lord taking the book
[1:08:24] loosing the seals opening the
[1:08:26] inheritance back to Adam's fallen race
[1:08:28] the whole things in jeopardy
[1:08:30] hallelujah so now here he comes he steps
[1:08:32] forth and he's found to be worthy to
[1:08:35] open the book how Lucy everything that
[1:08:38] Adam lost remember he he was God over
[1:08:40] the earth but by trying to save his wife
[1:08:43] and falling amen
[1:08:45] he forfeited as God ship over the earth
[1:08:47] and now Satan is God over the earth
[1:08:48] right the god of this evil age the
[1:08:51] scripture says he is amen
[1:08:53] because and so that title deed couldn't
[1:08:56] go into the hands of Satan so it went
[1:08:57] back to the original owner and it's been
[1:08:59] waiting it's been waiting Amen but then
[1:09:02] now there comes a time rel Lord Jesus
[1:09:04] redeemed us he's been interceding and
[1:09:07] he's still in the city on our behalf
[1:09:08] right he's still in the city on our
[1:09:10] behalf and then now it comes to claim
[1:09:12] what belongs to him and that's why it's
[1:09:15] so glorious witness word came your way
[1:09:17] I trust that still means something to
[1:09:18] you when the message came your way and
[1:09:21] it echoes something spoke to you on here
[1:09:23] that's a lamb saying you belong to me
[1:09:25] I'm calling your name I mean your name's
[1:09:27] in the book and I'm calling your name
[1:09:29] out of the book you say well he never
[1:09:30] verbally said my name but something
[1:09:33] spoke to you the word spoke to your soul
[1:09:35] hallelujah and that's God laying claim
[1:09:37] on you hallelujah amen so he prevailed
[1:09:43] to open the book to loose the seven
[1:09:44] seals thereof and I beheld so step forth
[1:09:48] amen and he came and took the book out
[1:09:53] of the right hand of him that sat on the
[1:09:54] throne and when he had taken the book
[1:09:56] the four beasts and four and twenty
[1:09:58] elders the four beasts four and twenty
[1:10:00] else fell down before the lamb having
[1:10:02] every one of them harps and golden vials
[1:10:04] full of odours which are the prayers of
[1:10:06] saints now they could release these
[1:10:08] priests because you go read about Adams
[1:10:11] lineage and you know in Genesis it goes

[1:10:15] upon the name of the Lord because
[1:10:17] they're calling on God God when are you
[1:10:18] going to restore Eden when you're going

[1:10:33] streets of gold hallelujah soon and very
[1:10:36] soon it's all done now is the season and
[1:10:40] they sung a new song saying thou art
[1:10:42] worthy to take the book to open the
[1:10:44] seals thereof for thou was slain and has
[1:10:46] redeemed us to God by their blood out of
[1:10:48] every kindred and tongue and people and
[1:10:50] nation hallelujah and I trust that
[1:10:53] that's that's your song we've been
[1:10:55] redeemed
[1:10:56] amen he's taken the book he's loose the
[1:10:58] seals this is important

[1:11:10] Almighty God the title deed to the earth
[1:11:12] and to eternal life when Adam four
[1:11:14] footed it when when Satan's dirty hands
[1:11:17] could not take it so went back to its
[1:11:19] original owner God himself we're gonna
[1:11:21] find it just a minute there he sits on
[1:11:23] the throne with it in his hand the title
[1:11:26] deed oh it makes me feel religious the
[1:11:28] title deed to eternal life abstract
[1:11:30] title deed to eternal life when Adam
[1:11:32] four-footed up for wisdom and set of
[1:11:34] faith and went back to the hands of the
[1:11:36] original owner Almighty God what a great
[1:11:38] thing all right waiting what's it doing
[1:11:40] it's in the hands of God waiting for
[1:11:42] redemptions claims he made a way for
[1:11:44] redemption he made a way back and
[1:11:46] someday the Redeemer is to take it back
[1:11:48] you see where we're getting to now let's
[1:11:50] watch this fellow sitting on the throne
[1:11:52] all right waiting for redemptions claims
[1:11:54] its Redemption what is this book of
[1:11:56] Redemption this title deed abstract all
[1:11:58] did you say abstract what does abstract
[1:12:00] mean means it searched all the way back
[1:12:03] to its beginning like that little drop
[1:12:05] of ink this morning when it struck that
[1:12:07] bleach it went all the way back and when
[1:12:09] sins been confessed and fall into the
[1:12:11] blood of Jesus Christ oh my it gives an
[1:12:14] abstract straight right back to the
[1:12:15] crater again you become a son of God
[1:12:17] abstract title deed is held in the hands
[1:12:20] of the Almighty
[1:12:22] oh my it's Redemption means all legal
[1:12:25] possession of all that was lost by Adam
[1:12:28] and Eve oh my what that ought to do to a
[1:12:31] born-again Christian it's legal position
[1:12:33] to that abstract deed title deed of
[1:12:36] eternal life means that you possess
[1:12:37] everything that Adam and Eve lost or
[1:12:41] whatever brother the possession of that
[1:12:43] deed Adam could not meet the required
[1:12:45] of redemption after he found he lost it
[1:12:47] he had sending it cipro himself from God
[1:12:49] was on this side of the chasm so he
[1:12:52] could not redeem it he couldn't do it
[1:12:53] because he needed Redemption himself he
[1:12:56] could not do it but the law required a
[1:12:58] kinsman redeemer the law of God required
[1:13:01] a kinsman redeemer you want to market
[1:13:02] down kinsman redeemer we find it in
[1:13:04] Leviticus 25 we don't have time to
[1:13:07] thoroughly search this cause you know
[1:13:08] each text would take your night seat but
[1:13:10] God's law received a substitute now what
[1:13:13] if God had not offered to make a
[1:13:15] substitute but love constrained him to
[1:13:17] do it
[1:13:18] that man was without a way back there's
[1:13:21] no way for him to get back he was gone
[1:13:22] but the grace of God met this kinsman
[1:13:26] redeemer and the person of Jesus Christ
[1:13:28] law required at Grace met its
[1:13:30] requirements or Amazing Grace how sweet
[1:13:32] the sound
[1:13:33] God's law required an innocent
[1:13:35] substitute and who was innocent every
[1:13:37] man was born sexual after sex everyone
[1:13:39] and the only one that wasn't had full
[1:13:41] foot the rights to eternal life to be
[1:13:44] the king of the earth oh when I think of
[1:13:46] that scripture for thou has redeemed us
[1:13:48] back to God we may reign to be kings and
[1:13:51] priests upon the earth oh my what the
[1:13:53] kinsman redeemer
[1:13:54] oh what a story we would have here
[1:13:56] notice the law required a kinsman
[1:13:59] redeemer to redeem a lost substance
[1:14:01] grace met this requirement and the
[1:14:03] person of Jesus Christ a kinsman must be
[1:14:06] born of the human race hallelujah so the
[1:14:09] law required it grace provided in the
[1:14:11] person of Jesus Christ our Lord amen
[1:14:13] when we could not get back he came down
[1:14:22] Daniel was looking it was sealed in his
[1:14:24] time now it's come to a time when it's
[1:14:26] open hallelujah and then we see this
[1:14:29] book now is taken and John is there and
[1:14:32] he sees a mighty angel descending in
[1:14:34] revelations 10 and before revelations 10
[1:14:37] you see the bottomless pit opens up
[1:14:38] smoke comes the devil's come out of hell
[1:14:41] I mean but as that's happening and a
[1:14:43] mighty angel comes down upon the earth
[1:14:45] with an open book hallelujah so this is
[1:14:47] the book that they that that the Lamb
[1:14:50] took in Revelations 5 now that same God
[1:14:52] has come down upon the earth with that
[1:14:54] book open and he cries out with a loud
[1:14:57] voice as a lion Roth and
[1:14:58] he cried seven thunders uttered their
[1:15:00] voices and when the seven thunders
[1:15:02] uttered their voices I was about to
[1:15:04] write it so John heard it he was about
[1:15:06] to write it down I heard a voice from
[1:15:08] heaven saying unto me seal up those
[1:15:09] things which the seven thunders uttered
[1:15:11] and write them not and the angel which I
[1:15:14] saw stand upon the sea upon the earth
[1:15:15] lifted up his hand to heaven and swear
[1:15:18] by him that liveth for ever and ever who
[1:15:20] created heaven and the things that there
[1:15:22] are now and the earth and the things
[1:15:23] that there are now and the sea and the
[1:15:25] things that and there are that there
[1:15:27] should be time no longer and that means
[1:15:29] there shall be no more delay so remember
[1:15:32] this is all symbolic but this is
[1:15:33] Christ's coming down memory read on
[1:15:35] Wednesday that God's final move will be
[1:15:37] a greater outpouring of the Holy Spirit
[1:15:40] right so this mighty angel descending is
[1:15:42] the Holy Spirit coming down Christ and
[1:15:44] his fullness right the Holy Spirit feels
[1:15:47] not in portion like in Wesley's day or
[1:15:49] Zeus's Street day or Pentecostal day or
[1:15:51] Luther's day this is the fullness of God
[1:15:54] coming down into the church again
[1:15:56] brother Brennan see the Son of Man will
[1:15:58] be manifested in the church body
[1:16:00] hallelujah so now here he comes the
[1:16:02] anointing comes down with an open book
[1:16:04] so here's the title deed that of
[1:16:05] everything Adam lost God has come down
[1:16:08] to unite that deed to a people right
[1:16:11] that they'd become one with that word
[1:16:13] that that word will be manifested in
[1:16:15] them
[1:16:16] hallelujah hope that means something to
[1:16:18] you I mean just like Moses they're on
[1:16:19] Mount Sinai he receives the law the
[1:16:22] purpose of that law was that they would
[1:16:24] God's their land and they become one
[1:16:25] with that land right see here he gums
[1:16:27] and then it comes down the mountain he
[1:16:29] preaches that word Caleb and Joshua
[1:16:32] heard that word they became one with
[1:16:34] that word Caleb was now burnt up I won't
[1:16:37] mine here it's give me my mountain when
[1:16:39] am I going to be in my possession when
[1:16:41] am I going to manifest this law that
[1:16:42] came to me hallelujah that's the same
[1:16:45] thing with you and I friends I trust I
[1:16:47] mean when the word comes open you know
[1:16:49] this became a new book to me over ten
[1:16:52] years ago I was reading it and it was
[1:16:54] and once upon a time it was Paul was
[1:16:57] writing to someone and this was to
[1:16:58] someone else but then it became a
[1:16:59] personal book it was Peter writing to me
[1:17:03] and whenever I turn it's actually I'm
[1:17:05] writing to you personally today
[1:17:08] hallelujah so wasn't someone else's
[1:17:11] covered
[1:17:11] testimony it was now mine they made with
[1:17:15] me hallelujah so now it's very important
[1:17:18] you say so so John he heard these seven
[1:17:21] thunders but he was told not to write it
[1:17:24] but they were sealed up right at not
[1:17:27] right seal up those things see even John
[1:17:30] he heard it but he has told don't write
[1:17:32] this because there comes a time he says
[1:17:37] but in the days of the voice so when are
[1:17:39] these things gonna be but in the days of
[1:17:41] the voice of the seventh angel when he
[1:17:42] should begin to sound the mystery God
[1:17:44] should be finished as he has declared to
[1:17:46] his servants the prophets so these seven
[1:17:48] thunders just like Jesus he's setting
[1:17:50] upon it as his father glorify thy name
[1:17:52] and a voice spoke from him and I've
[1:17:54] glorified I'll glorify it again some
[1:17:56] heard the voice the others heard a
[1:17:58] thunder so the thunders of the voice of
[1:18:00] God not interpreted it's all in the
[1:18:02] scripture right so it's not these seven
[1:18:04] thunders not saying that's added to the
[1:18:06] word it's in the word well you've got to
[1:18:07] come a time when it comes open when it
[1:18:09] becomes plain and brother has asked the
[1:18:11] question are the seven thunders the
[1:18:13] revelation 7 seals he says yes they are
[1:18:15] yslow sunders were we're held in the
[1:18:17] seals when the seals were loosed then
[1:18:19] the thunders were loosed the voice of
[1:18:21] God was loosed upon the earth right and
[1:18:23] now has been searching for hearts amen
[1:18:25] to come and manifest and then that word
[1:18:27] becomes flesh and her people hallelujah
[1:18:30] amen and that's why it gives us power to
[1:18:33] actually overcome the enemy I mean
[1:18:36] because there's always the question well
[1:18:37] if we've been restored back what do we
[1:18:39] have that that the first church age did
[1:18:41] it they didn't have the seals open they
[1:18:43] didn't need that power right because
[1:18:45] when God releases his word he releases a
[1:18:47] power in that word hallelujah and so now
[1:18:50] when he releases that word amen it gives
[1:18:53] the people power when they receive it by
[1:18:55] faith that gives them overcoming power
[1:18:56] to overcome the conditions of their day
[1:18:59] hallelujah so here we are down he says
[1:19:02] now he says when the days of the voice
[1:19:05] of the seventh angel when he should
[1:19:06] begin to sound the mysteries of God
[1:19:08] should be finished should be completed
[1:19:10] as he hath declared it to servants the
[1:19:12] prophets now we know that God doesn't
[1:19:14] send a heavenly angel to preach God uses
[1:19:17] man while he always uses man right
[1:19:19] because God doesn't change his method he
[1:19:21] says it Amos 3:7 I'll do nothing until
[1:19:24] revealed to my servants the prophets
[1:19:25] first right so this the seventh angel is
[1:19:28] an earthly angel earthly messenger so
[1:19:31] the days of his voice then the mystery
[1:19:33] of God will be completed will be
[1:19:34] finished and that's why brother Browns
[1:19:36] ministry was recorded Rakas the days of
[1:19:39] his voice and the days of his voice the
[1:19:40] mystery gotta be finished because God
[1:19:42] will unfold the word to a people as they
[1:19:44] walk with Him and they begin to see the
[1:19:46] mystery of God has been unfolded in this
[1:19:48] day hallelujah so now here we are but
[1:19:52] this is not the end of it because now
[1:19:56] we're told that's just like the lamb why
[1:19:59] did Jesus died and died for himself he
[1:20:00] died for you he came to redeem you to
[1:20:03] take you back into your place right and
[1:20:05] so now the whole purpose God's whole
[1:20:07] purpose of redemption his focus is you
[1:20:09] God wants you in your place hallelujah
[1:20:13] and it's not subservient right when God
[1:20:16] calls people it's not that you know it's
[1:20:19] like a you know it's like a wife their
[1:20:21] position is not just chief cook and
[1:20:23] bottle washer now that went real quiet
[1:20:28] oh they're in their place no that's just
[1:20:32] not it if we're joint is right if what I
[1:20:37] am in Christ
[1:20:38] I'm joint heirs with him so that should
[1:20:41] be reflected down into the family you
[1:20:43] want to see something that supernatural
[1:20:44] you see a family that's actually in its
[1:20:46] order under the Word of God that's
[1:20:48] supernatural that's incredible and so
[1:20:50] now so so so now woman in her place is
[1:20:53] not just a cook in a bottle-washer
[1:20:54] right God doesn't just use a scissor now
[1:20:57] do these little things and you know no
[1:20:59] he has fellowship with us he whispers
[1:21:01] his love secrets in our ear he lifts us
[1:21:03] up to where he is I mean he actually you
[1:21:05] know he gives us burdens he shares his
[1:21:08] heart with us did he have a burden or
[1:21:10] God move I want to see Souls come in
[1:21:14] heal this person God sharing his burden
[1:21:16] with you right God sharing his burden
[1:21:19] he's not just using you as a server not
[1:21:21] telling what's going on he he shares
[1:21:23] this burden with you and should be the
[1:21:25] same thing with our wives they actually
[1:21:26] have a spiritual what do you call it
[1:21:29] input yeah I mean they share spiritual
[1:21:34] and put into the family right not just
[1:21:36] that
[1:21:37] cooking a bottle-washer then your
[1:21:38] spiritual input their there their view
[1:21:41] actually matters right that's like that
[1:21:44] you know we we're all part of the body
[1:21:47] of Christ as this I feel this is coming
[1:21:50] out okay right but we shouldn't tread
[1:21:53] down our our families lift them up amen
[1:21:58] so now God speaks but then also you see
[1:22:01] here but that's not the end of it and
[1:22:04] the voice which I heard from heaven
[1:22:06] speak to me again Saint go and take the
[1:22:08] little book which is open which standing
[1:22:10] upon me I'm the hand of the angel which
[1:22:12] standing upon the sea and upon the earth
[1:22:14] and he went give me the little book and
[1:22:18] he said take it and eat it up so now
[1:22:20] these people john represents the bride
[1:22:23] you got to become one with the word you
[1:22:25] can't just sympathize with the message
[1:22:27] oh that's what that he believes mommy
[1:22:28] believes this is okay now you're going
[1:22:30] to become one with it you become one
[1:22:32] with Jesus Christ and living word right
[1:22:34] and then now John takes the book he eats
[1:22:38] it up and as in his belly it's bitter
[1:22:40] but as mouth that sweetest honey and he
[1:22:43] did that and I took the little book out
[1:22:46] of the Angels hand and ate it up and it
[1:22:48] was in my mouth sweet as honey as soon
[1:22:49] as I had eaten it my belly was bitter he
[1:22:51] said unto me thou must prophesy again
[1:22:53] before many peoples and nations and
[1:22:55] tongues and kings now we know in history
[1:22:58] John did not after his on the Isle of
[1:23:00] Patmos he went to pasture the church at
[1:23:02] Ephesus and there he died so he didn't
[1:23:04] fulfill this but this is actually the
[1:23:07] fulfillment the commission to the bride
[1:23:09] in those last days you got to become one
[1:23:11] with the book right become one with
[1:23:13] everything Adam lost you must become one
[1:23:15] with it and you got to speak it forth
[1:23:16] you have to prophesy again you were to
[1:23:19] speak the contents of the book I mean
[1:23:21] that's why it's important we should talk
[1:23:22] about what God has done what God has
[1:23:24] given us hallelujah if I'm a journeyer
[1:23:28] with Christ I should talk about it
[1:23:30] that's why you got to respond I mean
[1:23:32] with God's looking for a response from
[1:23:34] you hallelujah so we're going to speak
[1:23:36] the contents of the book and so now that
[1:23:40] is more than just repeating what brother
[1:23:42] Bram said though that is good but it's
[1:23:44] the life that was in the Lord Jesus
[1:23:45] lives out of you that's how it has to be
[1:23:50] Amen that thou must prophesy again so we
[1:23:52] have the Great Commission now right to
[1:23:55] go prophesy before many peoples nations
[1:23:57] tongues and kings there's the bride
[1:23:59] around the world see everything Adam
[1:24:01] lost has to become manifested spoken of
[1:24:03] and the stay an hour Amen that should
[1:24:07] make us happy Allu you so now we're
[1:24:11] living in this day now Moses now I'm
[1:24:17] just gonna it's gonna wrap up with us
[1:24:20] now Moses in Deuteronomy for we ask this
[1:24:22] question for us now of the days that
[1:24:24] were passed which were before thee since
[1:24:27] the day that God created man upon the
[1:24:28] earth and asked from one side of heaven
[1:24:30] to the other
[1:24:31] whether thou has seen any such a thing
[1:24:34] as great thing as this great thing is or
[1:24:36] hath been heard like it did ever people
[1:24:40] hear the voice of God speaking out of
[1:24:41] the midst of the fire as thou has heard
[1:24:43] and live or hath God si to go and take
[1:24:47] him a nation from the midst of another
[1:24:49] nation by temptations by signs by
[1:24:51] wonders and by war and by a mighty hand
[1:24:53] and by an outstretched arm and by great
[1:24:56] terrors according to all that the Lord
[1:24:58] your God did for you in Egypt before
[1:24:59] your eyes and to thee it was showed that
[1:25:02] thou mightest know that the Lord he is
[1:25:05] God and there's none else beside him out
[1:25:08] of heaven he made thee to hear his voice

[1:26:00] restoration we're living in the time of
[1:26:01] the full redemption right we're living
[1:26:04] in the

[1:26:08] that quickening power is coming to us of
[1:26:10] his holy spirit hallelujah has there
[1:26:13] ever been a day where God we've heard
[1:26:15] the voice out of the mists of the fire

[1:26:40] good what about the days when Jesus was
[1:26:42] in Basil's flesh that would have been
[1:26:44] wonderful but this is a better day this
[1:26:47] is a greater day because death is going
