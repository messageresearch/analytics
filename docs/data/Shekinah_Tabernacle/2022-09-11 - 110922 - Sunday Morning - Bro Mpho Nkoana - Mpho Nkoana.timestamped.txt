[14:32] we have a special birthday this morning
[14:34] it's a sister Chantels 21st birthday
[14:42] and I think we have a special too
[15:20] foreign
[15:28] I finished writing my first song just
[15:31] this week
[15:32] um it's called The Ballad of the East
[15:34] Coast Railway
[15:35] um I took a long time to get to the end
[15:36] of this song because
[15:38] my family kind of assumed it was a sort
[15:40] of politically oriented song so I had
[15:41] this idea if my heart wasn't in that I
[15:43] could meddle it into one of those
[15:45] awesome gospel train songs luckily a
[15:47] friend talked me out of this he said if
[15:48] you want a gospel Train song Write a
[15:50] gospel Train song and what with one
[15:52] thing and another it kind of turned into
[15:53] a Rapture song so then I looked upon my
[15:55] works and like wow does this mean I can
[15:57] sing it in church as well as at the folk
[15:58] Club
[15:59] think I can sing it in church as well as
[16:01] at the folk Club so I'm going to try it
[16:03] and find out

[44:52] Talia you can display it there my girl
[44:54] brother outside is to me is possible and
[44:57] then we can just enjoy it this morning
[44:59] just relax there's nothing that is out
[45:02] of cater we are not short this morning
[45:05] amen this morning everyone who was
[45:08] supposed to be here is here amen and
[45:11] remember the Lord does not count the
[45:14] numbers no the Lord does not go one two
[45:17] three ah they are short I must add today
[45:20] no the Lord weighs us the Lord can put
[45:23] one man right here
[45:25] he's standing the pulpit and you preach
[45:27] the service and Heaven says hallelujah
[45:30] that's what the Lord because the Lord
[45:32] weighs us he he weighs the spirit his
[45:35] presence right that is why God you can't
[45:38] count him and say he's one
[45:40] the Lord your God is one but you can't
[45:42] say God is like this finger one
[45:44] his presence
[45:46] Hallelujah so we have read that but our
[45:49] topic today I would like us to look at
[45:52] this topic that is very very doctrinal
[45:55] issue and but but such powerful uh if
[45:59] you come to think of it if you just take
[46:00] your time and study it and you will find
[46:04] that it's not as as a subject that
[46:07] brother can come here just in one
[46:09] service and we preach and we finish it
[46:10] it is a long and a deep subject it means
[46:14] you when you know when you eat beautiful
[46:16] food nice food have you ever gone to
[46:18] Sister Hannah and he cooks for you
[46:21] Korean food you know when you eat that
[46:23] food
[46:24] you relax
[46:27] you you sit back
[46:30] and then no rush
[46:33] and then you just take it bit by bit
[46:37] that's what I would like you to do this
[46:38] morning we are not rushing in fact
[46:40] anyone can sit on their row if you want
[46:43] and just press your feet
[46:46] and relax
[46:47] because we are in the presence of the
[46:49] Lord amen so I would like us to take
[46:51] that posture this morning and look at
[46:53] the believer's position in the mystical
[46:56] body of the Lord that I love this body
[47:00] of the Lord there's a Psalm that says
[47:04] I love this family of God
[47:12] so
[47:13] we get into one
[47:17] you see that family is so closely
[47:20] knitted into one it is it is Mystical
[47:24] you know you know what the meaning of
[47:26] the word mystical if you go up a little
[47:28] bit my girl
[47:29] a mystical when I I went to Dr Google
[47:34] and I went to the dictionary I checked I
[47:36] found that mystical they say is having a
[47:40] spiritual meaning or what I like is the
[47:43] reality that it is neither apparent to
[47:46] the senses to these five senses that's
[47:48] right it is it is it is
[47:52] a reality yeah
[47:54] yeah it is a reality you see this thing
[47:56] is a reality
[47:58] from at least for the five senses okay
[48:00] but it is very upper it's not clear you
[48:04] don't need any explanation for me to
[48:06] tell you that this is a highlighter and
[48:08] it's pink
[48:09] and it has got a lead and
[48:12] everything about it is Pink right so
[48:15] it's not something that you your senses
[48:19] can mistaken it for blue or for a pen or
[48:24] a pencil it's clear
[48:26] you know a highlighter do you see a
[48:27] highlighter so but but a mystical body
[48:29] you
[48:31] apparently
[48:33] or even you can't say no no not
[48:36] everybody can say oh that's the body of
[48:38] the Lord
[48:42] [Music]
[48:44] Holland and Germany all they are like
[48:46] this is this is their body no it's a
[48:48] mystical body right an idiot Squad and
[48:52] it's not obvious today to this
[48:54] intelligence right right that is why he
[48:57] said I will come and be in you that only
[49:01] you and I will know but the world won't
[49:03] see the world won't know the word will
[49:06] say come on what body are you yeah
[49:09] that's right but because it's a mystical
[49:11] body all right let's take it easy this
[49:13] morning I'm not gonna
[49:15] we're gonna try to just make it like
[49:18] more a teaching and and I know when you
[49:20] are teaching
[49:22] people tend to lose you along the way
[49:24] and sleep so I don't want you to lose me
[49:27] because this is very enriching it has
[49:30] been very powerful and a blessing to me
[49:32] and I would like it to be a blessing the
[49:35] same way to you amen amen mystical body
[49:37] not obvious to the to the to the canal
[49:40] eye right but it is clear to the
[49:43] spiritual eye are we together it is a
[49:46] mystical body of the Lord and is across
[49:48] the world Amen it's across the globe
[49:50] right and he's gonna take it and he saw
[49:54] that body that bride he saw him and he
[49:57] planned for her he come into that
[50:00] mystical body himself the Lord Jesus so
[50:03] we are going to speak about the position
[50:05] of that believer in that body
[50:09] huh why not say position I don't mean in
[50:13] cashier when we've got about the Cubana
[50:15] the Deacon when we've got brother Ben as
[50:17] the pastor when we've got brother Andy's
[50:19] that no no I don't mean those positions
[50:21] those are physical
[50:23] positions that we have for the
[50:25] administration of the Church of this
[50:28] building and how we manage this how we
[50:31] must be orderly those are good for the
[50:34] church order right but I'm talking about
[50:37] your position as a believer in this body
[50:41] right you will follow me three things we
[50:44] are going to talk about I've highlighted
[50:46] them over there three things only and we
[50:48] go home but my desire is that by the
[50:51] time we go home that it has already
[50:53] soaked in you have really you've really
[50:56] really unpacked and even went further as
[50:59] the Lord speaks to you because remember
[51:00] as I speak the Lord talks to you right
[51:04] the Lord himself is doing the preaching
[51:06] something ignites something in your
[51:08] heart
[51:09] right it's not everything that I say
[51:12] here that is gonna bless you some things
[51:14] the holy spirit is going to speak to you
[51:16] it's ah and we see you jumping for
[51:20] something that I did not necessarily say
[51:22] you see you're smiling and happy and you
[51:25] say Amen yes that's what I read
[51:27] yesterday thank you Lord
[51:30] why because the Lord Jesus the holy
[51:32] spirit is busy ministering so give him
[51:35] space amen open your heart then he will
[51:38] talk to you don't look at me right amen
[51:42] three things we're gonna speak about and
[51:44] we go home
[51:46] what we talk about possessing the land
[51:48] and the positionally being placed
[51:52] possessing the land and positionally
[51:54] being placed then we'll talk about
[51:56] keeping and maintaining your position
[51:59] your possession
[52:01] your possession is that if you have this
[52:05] book
[52:06] as yours it is your possession you own
[52:09] it now I'm saying keeping and
[52:12] maintaining it
[52:14] right within your position in the weight
[52:19] because
[52:22] imagine if I have this book and you want
[52:25] to borrow it right
[52:27] and you find that men some pages are
[52:30] torn
[52:31] it is not it's not maintained
[52:34] huh would you think that is the book
[52:36] that I love
[52:38] something that is yours you keep it and
[52:41] you maintain it
[52:43] because it is your possession my girl
[52:45] sister Elise isn't it it's your position
[52:49] you make sure that you you you you you
[52:51] fight for this position
[52:53] because it is yours you you cannot allow
[52:56] something that is your position that did
[52:59] not come so easy Malachi you can't allow
[53:01] it to go easy and the devil just play
[53:03] around with it fine isn't it because it
[53:06] came at a big cost
[53:09] right yeah now the last part we'll talk
[53:12] about put we will discuss how position
[53:16] your position in the weight determines
[53:19] your position in other words
[53:22] uh you might not get your possession if
[53:26] you are not in position
[53:28] you have to be in your position that's
[53:30] right in order for you to proceed to
[53:34] possess thank you brother otherwise you
[53:37] might miss your possession and take
[53:39] someone's position that's right
[53:41] you see now let's let's go let's read
[53:44] there that that thing that I highlighted
[53:47] over there but I want to study it in the
[53:49] middle of the paragraph the assistant
[53:50] Talia and say second second sentence of
[53:53] that bottom paragraph
[53:55] but once you come into the kingdom of
[53:58] God through the blood I like what the
[54:00] songs the brother was singing this
[54:02] morning he just could not come out of
[54:04] that blood jar brother Jim was just in
[54:06] the blood I I thought he he stick in the
[54:10] blood
[54:11] that's why I felt so immersed in the
[54:14] blood of the Lord in those songs this
[54:16] morning and I said that brother because
[54:18] right now he's got the atmosphere right
[54:20] now the Holy Spirit knows what you are
[54:22] going to be talking about how can the
[54:24] brother talk about the blood and I want
[54:25] to talk about the blood do you think
[54:28] this we discussed before no we never
[54:31] even discussed the sermons we only
[54:32] discussed songs yesterday
[54:35] yes we didn't talk about the same one
[54:37] but he goes and talk about those songs
[54:41] and bring the song that talks about the
[54:43] blood and I prepare someone that comes
[54:46] and tell us that the blood brought the
[54:49] testimony the public testimony of the
[54:52] Crimson blood of the Lord you are in
[54:55] here in Fellowship where God can bless
[54:58] you
[54:59] and you can shout and praise the Lord
[55:01] and the power of God's working why it is
[55:05] God himself his own body the mystical
[55:10] body of the Lord Jesus Christ here on
[55:13] Earth operating upon the basis of the
[55:16] shed black and that's what I want you to
[55:19] get it as we start right there's a
[55:21] mystical body
[55:23] on Earth of the Lord it is in operation
[55:27] right and it is operating on the basis
[55:31] of the shared blood
[55:34] can I put this page aside now
[55:36] only 12 pages
[55:39] then we'll be done one one down others
[55:42] is just scriptures we must allow the
[55:44] Lord we just read scriptures the Lord
[55:46] talks to us and we just enjoy that you
[55:49] know we just enjoy that
[55:51] let's read the next page there telescope
[55:54] down a little bit page two
[55:56] thank you so much not upon the basis of
[55:59] Methodist Baptist Pentecostal Shekinah
[56:01] Tabernacle not on the basis of a church
[56:05] no that mystical body comes on the basis
[56:08] of the head blood that's how it operates
[56:10] right let's let's see there not upon the
[56:13] basis of water baptism huh
[56:16] I thought if I get baptized that is the
[56:19] basis ah
[56:21] although it is good it is all right but
[56:25] not upon the basis of water baptism not
[56:28] upon the basis of draining a church
[56:31] I thought if I'm a member of Shekinah
[56:34] cabinet
[56:37] not upon the base of joining a cat it is
[56:40] good
[56:42] actually I can say it is necessary
[56:45] but it is upon the basis of shared blood
[56:48] amen that's right you might have a
[56:52] fellowship with the church the
[56:53] congregation but you will never have
[56:55] fellowship with God till you come on the
[56:58] basis on his basis his terms his terms
[57:02] is through the blood
[57:04] that's why he came and died at the cross
[57:06] are we together that's the first thing
[57:09] that we need to conquer to concretize in
[57:11] our
[57:12] Minds
[57:14] I don't want to see our minds because I
[57:17] was talking to someone I said where's
[57:18] the mind
[57:20] yeah so we must concretize it to
[57:25] understand that
[57:27] we come on the basis of the shared blood
[57:29] he died even now when I sin when I do
[57:33] something wrong mama said the Lord can
[57:36] only look to me through the blood
[57:39] is dripping
[57:41] it's dripping even this gospel the Bible
[57:44] says is dripping with blood of the
[57:45] Believers but the Lord Jesus the
[57:48] powerful bleach
[57:49] of the blood when he looks through to me
[57:52] he see pure white but yet I'm a sinner
[57:55] saved by grace why because he looks
[57:58] through me through the blood
[58:00] they say if you take a red color and a
[58:02] red color
[58:03] red sins
[58:06] filthy
[58:07] that great you know that red that is
[58:09] dirty and you take another rate of the
[58:12] blood of the Lamb then you look at them
[58:14] through the light
[58:15] of the Gospel of the word you see white
[58:20] right and why the snow Hallelujah now
[58:24] let's read paragraph 47. and through the
[58:27] blood you become part of him into the
[58:29] same cell that he came out of
[58:32] man how can that be
[58:35] how can I come out of the same cell that
[58:39] he came out and and the Very presence
[58:41] and a part of God comes into you this is
[58:45] magnificent brother and sister
[58:47] the the same thing of God comes through
[58:50] in me
[58:52] yes you
[58:54] because there's something that is called
[58:57] amnesia
[58:58] it made you not to know who you are
[59:02] and one day we are going to realize who
[59:04] actually we are
[59:07] and it will say
[59:10] had to wait in Afrikaans
[59:14] I don't know if it's a swearing weight
[59:15] or not when you say when you say it says
[59:19] one not really I almost said
[59:26] when they were going to say oh man
[59:29] and it will just and it will be over
[59:31] right now there's still some blurries it
[59:35] lasts that we call this flesh we can see
[59:39] we can see it's revealed but one day we
[59:42] are going to see the reality of
[59:44] realities
[59:45] and that day you will know and that day
[59:48] is the day that you will be ascending
[59:50] going home
[59:51] when you will finally realize that ah
[59:54] this you know you know when you close
[59:57] something and it finally just clicks
[1:00:00] that's it gone
[1:00:02] and the Very presence and the part of
[1:00:04] God comes into you by faith you purchase
[1:00:07] it and that same holy spirit that was in
[1:00:11] the Lord Jesus Christ comes in you and
[1:00:14] then you are Sons and Daughters of God
[1:00:17] yes adopted amen by the Lord Jesus
[1:00:21] Christ into the body
[1:00:24] of Christ
[1:00:26] amen that cannot make a Methodist
[1:00:30] that makes a son and a daughter of God
[1:00:33] Amen let's read just two two more
[1:00:35] scriptures just just as a base for this
[1:00:38] because I I'll explain to you now why
[1:00:41] Ephesians chapter two the three
[1:00:44] scriptures Ephesians chapter 1 chapter 2
[1:00:46] chapter 3 those are the ones that the
[1:00:47] prophet you know said
[1:00:49] you know in this book of adoption how
[1:00:51] many of you read this book man this is
[1:00:53] go and read this book
[1:00:56] you know I your wife will just say
[1:01:00] Armand what's wrong with you there
[1:01:03] Sister Sister
[1:01:04] command is everything okay downstairs
[1:01:08] meanwhile he's busy with this if you go
[1:01:11] and read this book just take your time
[1:01:13] because the prophet prays for services
[1:01:15] in here different days so go go and read
[1:01:18] it and then you will you'll come and
[1:01:20] tell me
[1:01:22] and
[1:01:24] Ephesians chapter 2.
[1:01:26] verse 8 I'll read 8 19 20 21 22 only
[1:01:30] and through here through here we both
[1:01:32] have access by one spirit and to the
[1:01:34] father right now verse 19. now therefore
[1:01:38] you are no more strangers and foreign
[1:01:40] You Are No More Strangers you used to be
[1:01:42] foreigners
[1:01:44] and strangers
[1:01:46] but no more
[1:01:47] but fellow citizens
[1:01:50] right I got to see I got a residence
[1:01:53] of New Zealand
[1:01:56] I'm not yet a citizen
[1:01:58] I'm just a fellow residence now now
[1:02:00] three years from now
[1:02:02] maybe they'll call me and say hey come
[1:02:04] come get your certificate you are now a
[1:02:06] fellow citizen
[1:02:10] just imagine if the world can give
[1:02:12] someone a citizenship and say you are a
[1:02:16] citizen you the only thing you don't
[1:02:18] have is the blood of kiwi but you are
[1:02:21] now everything to you are right sign
[1:02:24] here
[1:02:26] if the world can do that how much more
[1:02:29] about the Lord Jesus him the Bible says
[1:02:32] he put his sleep Gene inside you the
[1:02:35] cell that brought his blood comes inside
[1:02:37] you you are you you there's no you pick
[1:02:40] up you see the adoption of God it's not
[1:02:42] like the adoption when New Zealand
[1:02:43] adopts me
[1:02:44] one day if maybe I'll go to jail they'll
[1:02:47] say I don't know we revoke your
[1:02:49] citizenship
[1:02:51] no it's not like the law
[1:02:57] sorry my boy you become a Pure
[1:02:59] Thoroughbred son and daughter of God
[1:03:02] from your gym from yourself
[1:03:05] that's how adoption for the Lord wake
[1:03:07] adoption for the Lord works like this
[1:03:09] pure you become original
[1:03:12] [Music]
[1:03:13] how can you say something is original
[1:03:15] when he's adopted that's our adoption
[1:03:18] for the Lord Works yes he makes you a
[1:03:21] son and a daughter you you become a son
[1:03:24] and a daughter when you were not
[1:03:27] that is why it's called a mystical body
[1:03:30] because the senses of this flesh can't
[1:03:32] understand it
[1:03:33] right you see you become a son and a
[1:03:36] daughter you become a god you
[1:03:39] can you believe that you are a God and
[1:03:41] amateur God
[1:03:43] you are
[1:03:44] that's right amen let's read it
[1:03:47] fellow citizens I mean fellow but fellow
[1:03:49] citizens with the Saints and of the
[1:03:52] household of God
[1:03:53] I love to be in the household of God
[1:03:56] and are built upon the foundation of the
[1:04:00] Apostles and Prophets Jesus Christ
[1:04:02] himself being the Chief Cornerstone
[1:04:07] of this household right there's 21 in
[1:04:11] whom all the building fitly framed
[1:04:16] remember I said I love this family of
[1:04:18] God so jointly together they are so
[1:04:22] neatly together to a point whereby we
[1:04:25] are told that the pyramids when they
[1:04:27] build them
[1:04:30] they didn't put Marta in between there
[1:04:32] and some super glue no
[1:04:35] those rocks were cut and they were
[1:04:38] fitting together that you can't even put
[1:04:40] the razor blade in between there
[1:04:42] a human being can do that
[1:04:45] it's not even a discussion whether God
[1:04:47] can do that or not is it it's told to us
[1:04:49] they were they were trying to copy that
[1:04:51] the devil was trying to copy what God
[1:04:53] can do whatever technology intelligence
[1:04:56] that human beings can do the devil saw
[1:04:59] it somewhere
[1:05:00] and he's trying to copy so God
[1:05:03] has a family that feeds jointly together
[1:05:07] framed you are framed here in New
[1:05:11] Zealand when they build your house they
[1:05:12] say they make a frame
[1:05:14] so that all the pillars and the timber
[1:05:18] can be gently fit together
[1:05:20] when they were not when they were coming
[1:05:22] from different trees they are now one
[1:05:24] building
[1:05:26] fit together and at the concrete the
[1:05:28] foundation is Christ himself the
[1:05:30] Cornerstone
[1:05:34] and I built upon the foundation of the
[1:05:36] Apostle let's read verse 21 in whom all
[1:05:38] the building fitly framed together
[1:05:40] growth unto the Holy Temple in the Lord
[1:05:43] in who he also are builded upon for an
[1:05:47] habitation of God through the spirit can
[1:05:50] we say Amen habitation it means
[1:05:54] a brilliant place you know like you know
[1:05:56] when we say a habitation is a dwelling
[1:06:00] environment
[1:06:01] yeah that's what the building that was
[1:06:04] that family for the cohabitation not
[1:06:07] cohabitation for the habitation of God

[1:06:16] bottom there my girl
[1:06:18] then we can go to our first part our
[1:06:21] first point
[1:06:24] let's read this verse 15 Ephesians 350.
[1:06:28] in whom the whole family in Heaven and
[1:06:31] Earth is named who
[1:06:34] the Lord Jesus Christ right the whole
[1:06:36] family in heaven on Earth is named that
[1:06:40] he will he will grant you according to
[1:06:42] the riches of his glory to be
[1:06:44] strengthened this with might by his
[1:06:47] spirit
[1:06:49] in the Inner Man
[1:06:52] if you stop a little bit and ponder
[1:06:54] about this
[1:06:55] he will he will according to the riches
[1:06:58] of his glory to be strengthened by my
[1:07:01] with might by his spirit
[1:07:05] his spirit in the Inner Man
[1:07:07] right the inner man who's the inner man
[1:07:09] it's the spirit right yeah
[1:07:11] left underline that will come back to it
[1:07:13] we underline it

[1:07:17] so Spirit to Spirit right
[1:07:21] that Christ might dwell in Your Heart by
[1:07:24] faith
[1:07:25] that ye being rooted and grounded in
[1:07:29] love man I just love how the Bible talks
[1:07:31] me I I think no philosopher will ever
[1:07:35] talk like this because because it's just
[1:07:38] only us understand Hallelujah
[1:07:42] now that we have read I don't want us to
[1:07:44] take more time
[1:07:46] but let's jump to Corinthians First
[1:07:49] Corinthians 12 all these scriptures the
[1:07:51] three of them that I read Ephesians 1 2
[1:07:53] 3 that are really the introduction to
[1:07:56] adoption to how we are adopted how how
[1:07:59] we were adopted right
[1:08:02] I mean in the back part of our minds
[1:08:04] let's put this scripture
[1:08:07] First Corinthians
[1:08:09] 12.
[1:08:10] let's read it just listen to it just
[1:08:12] just enjoy listening to it carefully we
[1:08:15] are not right we are not dressing okay
[1:08:16] amen thank you
[1:08:18] let's read verse 8.
[1:08:22] sorry
[1:08:23] verse 8.
[1:08:26] four
[1:08:27] to one is given by the spirit now here
[1:08:31] this Paul is talking about
[1:08:33] your blessings remember the riches of
[1:08:36] His blessings we read in Ephesians 1
[1:08:38] and Ephesians 2 we read about them right
[1:08:40] now here Paul is talking about some of
[1:08:43] those blessings some some of them
[1:08:45] remember this they said in which they
[1:08:47] say they say plethora there's a
[1:08:50] multitude of blessings you will never
[1:08:52] finish the gift The Riches of Heaven ah
[1:08:58] you cannot be exhausted correct yes
[1:09:01] so this is just some of them
[1:09:03] that we are already accessing them from
[1:09:05] Earth already
[1:09:07] four to one some you know to one less
[1:09:10] you can say yeah to Megan thank you for
[1:09:12] that beautiful song sister you've got a
[1:09:13] gift you you you you've got a gift my

[1:09:23] some you give them the spirit of wisdom
[1:09:26] that's what the Bible says fought one
[1:09:28] given by the spirit the word of wisdom
[1:09:30] we come to Sister Maggie to the other

[1:09:35] Same Spirit right and to one may Again
[1:09:38] by faith to another Faith by The Same

[1:10:10] to give you such things and this is just
[1:10:12] this is just still just blessings 101.
[1:10:18] this is just blessing one oh because the
[1:10:21] Bible says healing healing healing
[1:10:22] healing is the bread to the children not
[1:10:24] in a proud way but it is something that
[1:10:27] we we daily can eat bread
[1:10:31] right
[1:10:32] now
[1:10:34] let's go down there in verse 12. for as
[1:10:36] the body is one have many members and
[1:10:41] all the members of the one body being
[1:10:43] many
[1:10:45] are one body we are many but we are one
[1:10:48] body yes another one is sitting in a
[1:10:51] prison in in North Korea maybe right now
[1:10:53] another one is in Kuwait another one is
[1:10:56] in
[1:10:57] Madagascar another one is in Chile
[1:11:00] another one maybe it's in Argentina
[1:11:02] another one maybe is in Mauritius
[1:11:04] another one in India another one is in
[1:11:08] in a country called
[1:11:11] in Africa there have you heard of that
[1:11:13] country another one may be sitting in in
[1:11:16] Mongolia
[1:11:17] you've got a mystical body him he knows
[1:11:20] you he knows her and the prophet saw
[1:11:22] them Matthew he saw the matching and
[1:11:26] some of them were went out of line a
[1:11:29] little bit and the prophet says stay in
[1:11:31] line
[1:11:33] he says it was right at the very end
[1:11:35] there as as they were marching the bride
[1:11:37] he saw you and he said they were of
[1:11:39] different nations he thought they were
[1:11:41] matching matching matching into the
[1:11:44] Rapture and some of them were at the end
[1:11:47] there we're out of Step a little bit he
[1:11:50] said the prophet of God because with the
[1:11:52] the prophet of the Lord
[1:11:55] you see with God he does not use this
[1:11:57] time that we use of Monday last week you
[1:12:00] did this no he's an ever-present help
[1:12:03] in the time of need so the prophet can
[1:12:06] see something that happened
[1:12:08] in the Garden of Eden in him present
[1:12:11] tense he can see it now like now yeah
[1:12:14] right that's why he saw Adam and Eve
[1:12:16] that God made them some some clothing on
[1:12:20] the sheepskin what
[1:12:22] I know it's the sound of that skin of
[1:12:25] the ship hitting he saw them he saw the
[1:12:29] Lord Jesus Christ and his oh he was in
[1:12:31] such a pain at the same time he saw you
[1:12:33] at the end
[1:12:35] everything you see they say he's
[1:12:37] subconscious and conscious are like this
[1:12:39] so close to each other that was just see
[1:12:42] everything alive like that
[1:12:44] he can Venture into that Realm
[1:12:46] I want to be in that realm
[1:12:50] amen Amen brother and uh now
[1:12:55] many of us
[1:12:56] and body huh how is that possible all
[1:13:00] the members that one body being many are
[1:13:03] one body but also so also is Christ
[1:13:07] but let's be stating for by one Spirit
[1:13:09] we are all baptized into one boat oh is
[1:13:13] there baptism so this baptism it looks
[1:13:16] like it's more than just water
[1:13:20] that that water is just a physical
[1:13:23] uh showing of the real baptism we are
[1:13:28] baptized into the board into one body
[1:13:31] baptized yes
[1:13:33] whether we be Jews or Gentiles whether
[1:13:36] we be born or free and have been all
[1:13:38] made to drink into one spirit
[1:13:44] I used to have an uncle
[1:13:47] my wife's uncle
[1:13:49] when he he drinks
[1:13:51] when he trains
[1:13:53] you do something wrong he says uh you
[1:13:56] I'm drinking and you get drunk
[1:14:01] I drink and you get drunk don't do such
[1:14:04] things
[1:14:05] so we we we were all baptized and we
[1:14:10] were made to drink into one spirit and
[1:14:14] we do all different things and according
[1:14:16] to the riches that he gave us is
[1:14:19] everybody following me we just read in
[1:14:21] the scriptures now I just want us to to
[1:14:23] go with the thought of this adoption
[1:14:25] maybe at the end we'll hit
[1:14:28] the vain
[1:14:29] when you are digging digging digging for
[1:14:32] gold digging digging digging stone stone
[1:14:34] stone oh you hit the vein man you find
[1:14:37] just a pile of gold
[1:14:39] yeah you call everybody stop because you
[1:14:43] hit the vein I want at some point we hit
[1:14:46] a vein
[1:14:48] we got it amen amen and then
[1:14:51] verse 14 for the body is not one member
[1:14:55] but many right we all know those
[1:14:57] scriptures okay so let's let's just
[1:15:00] quickly start with our first point and
[1:15:02] quickly run through those three points
[1:15:04] and then we close there isn't the reason
[1:15:07] I'm reading those three scriptures
[1:15:09] and this kind of a background is that
[1:15:11] the prophet in this message he says the
[1:15:14] book of Ephesians it paralyzed the book
[1:15:17] of
[1:15:22] what what we find in the book of
[1:15:24] Ephesians or in the Book of Joshua we
[1:15:26] actually find it in the book of
[1:15:28] Ephesians spiritually you must look at
[1:15:30] it this way why
[1:15:34] when the children of Israel were taken
[1:15:36] out of Egypt
[1:15:37] right they were taken out of Egypt okay
[1:15:40] we know that salvation we are told that
[1:15:43] it's called there's three stages are we
[1:15:45] together justification
[1:15:48] all right next one
[1:15:50] sanctification and the third one
[1:15:54] baptism ah my good students man you're
[1:15:57] like you get eight a plus amen but three
[1:16:01] stages now they went out of Egypt right
[1:16:04] and they were in the journey the side of
[1:16:06] Jordan and then they crossed into the
[1:16:09] promised land right so
[1:16:11] the book of Ephesians that's what now
[1:16:14] talking to us Beyond Jordan after
[1:16:19] they've closed Jordan that's why the
[1:16:21] book because they were a physical Church
[1:16:23] Israel everything they were doing were
[1:16:25] on the physical side but they were
[1:16:27] shadowing us
[1:16:29] they are a shadow to us
[1:16:31] so if they are a shadow to us that means
[1:16:34] there might be something in the New
[1:16:36] Testament that is a replica of the
[1:16:38] reality of that shadow
[1:16:40] Ephesians is one of them
[1:16:42] Ephesians is one of
[1:16:44] them
[1:16:46] because Ephesians just tells you
[1:16:49] where as a believer
[1:16:52] your you are positionally placed way if
[1:16:56] you go read the book of Ephesians
[1:16:57] together with this book not only this
[1:16:59] book there's many other sermons like
[1:17:02] and a believer's position in Christ like
[1:17:06] the message called Christ who has read
[1:17:08] that one Christ in 55 so there's many
[1:17:11] the word of God is not just like one
[1:17:13] feather
[1:17:14] only and you think you've got the whole
[1:17:16] chicken no no it's not like
[1:17:20] no the word of God you must look at it
[1:17:23] and and have it comprehensively and eat
[1:17:27] the whole thing
[1:17:28] the sweet ones and the big towers
[1:17:32] because you eat the whole chicken don't
[1:17:34] tell me you never ate feathers of a
[1:17:36] chicken and the shell of the egg you ate
[1:17:38] them as long as you ate all the chicken
[1:17:40] you ate them
[1:17:43] so you ate you drink the whole medicine
[1:17:45] if you ate an egg full egg you have
[1:17:48] eaten feathers and everything
[1:17:49] [Music]
[1:17:51] built in there amen and shelf you think
[1:17:54] you broke and throw them in
[1:17:56] they were inside
[1:17:58] you ate them
[1:18:01] so comprehensively
[1:18:05] right yeah now let's read I want to show
[1:18:08] you this parallel of Joshua and
[1:18:10] Ephesians right in the book of Exodus
[1:18:14] chapter 3.
[1:18:15] he says
[1:18:17] can you go down to eat a bit my girl
[1:18:20] they correct
[1:18:22] that's in page here four right
[1:18:25] we're starting with that point
[1:18:26] possessing the land and positionally
[1:18:28] being placed okay we we know that
[1:18:30] there's three stages that we are we are
[1:18:32] all made sure to know that justification
[1:18:34] sanctification and baptism of the Holy
[1:18:37] Spirit and all of them is a build up to
[1:18:39] that it's not you can't get one and then
[1:18:41] not get the other no no that's why
[1:18:43] they're going to resurrect and we
[1:18:45] Rapture with them how can they Rapture
[1:18:47] without the Holy Ghost they're going to
[1:18:49] rap and you and me and me so must go
[1:18:51] through those stages
[1:18:54] I know that justification Martin Luther
[1:18:57] sanctification and now yes that's the
[1:19:00] typing of it but you as an individual
[1:19:02] must go through those stages yeah I'm
[1:19:05] not sure where you are now but I want to
[1:19:07] believe that you've already crossed the
[1:19:09] Jordan if not don't you worry
[1:19:12] if we have just left Egypt it's okay
[1:19:15] we remember we are more than 2 million
[1:19:19] we are working
[1:19:21] if you are still in the wilderness in my
[1:19:23] language they say it doesn't matter who
[1:19:25] left first
[1:19:27] doesn't matter
[1:19:28] some were hired in the morning
[1:19:31] some were hired in the evening
[1:19:34] all of them got the same don't you worry
[1:19:38] if you don't understand
[1:19:40] and then you can't get that meat oh that
[1:19:43] is called a little bone put the bone
[1:19:46] aside and a child the meat
[1:19:48] how can you throw the meat and the bone
[1:19:50] together
[1:19:51] huh I've never seen that the baby wet
[1:19:55] wet and want to clean them the Navy and
[1:19:57] everything and we chucked the baby and
[1:19:59] they paint the nappy in the bin no we
[1:20:01] don't do that huh
[1:20:04] we eat the meat
[1:20:07] right
[1:20:08] now what am I trying to say I'm trying
[1:20:10] to say that
[1:20:12] when when they crossed listen listen to
[1:20:15] the promise of Exodus 3 verse 8 to 9.
[1:20:18] it says and I am come down to deliver
[1:20:21] them out of the land of the Egyptians
[1:20:23] and to bring them up out of the land and
[1:20:26] to the good land and a large unto a land
[1:20:30] flowing with milk and honey underline
[1:20:33] this milk and honey
[1:20:35] because I never saw them eating milk and
[1:20:37] honey but the Lord said it
[1:20:39] the length of milk and honey will I take
[1:20:42] you to and to the place of the canonites
[1:20:45] and the hitters and the amorites and the
[1:20:48] parasites and the heavy size and the
[1:20:51] jebusitis you can hear those guys will
[1:20:52] kill you man just listening to those
[1:20:54] guys
[1:20:56] if you just meet a jebusite now outside
[1:20:59] let you know
[1:21:04] let's look at the parasites it's like
[1:21:06] parasite
[1:21:08] so the Lord is gonna give the milk and
[1:21:11] honey in that land yes
[1:21:14] Milton
[1:21:17] now therefore Behold The Cry of the
[1:21:19] children of Israel is come unto me me
[1:21:21] God and I have also seen the oppression
[1:21:24] where with the Egyptians oppresses them
[1:21:27] that's the background of how
[1:21:29] they started to get out right because
[1:21:32] God remembered this promise right let's
[1:21:35] pack that one there we had it right
[1:21:36] let's go to Joshua
[1:21:39] excuse me now God talks to Joshua
[1:21:42] remember Joshua
[1:21:44] is
[1:21:46] the Holy Spirit Joshua means Jehovah
[1:21:49] savior right
[1:21:50] are we together Joshua means Jehovah
[1:21:54] that's what it means so Joshua now we
[1:21:57] have crossed now that
[1:22:00] you have crossed Jordan we are on that
[1:22:03] side of Jordan we are now actually
[1:22:05] taking the land we are now taking what
[1:22:08] our possession
[1:22:11] men
[1:22:13] they are parasites there are all sorts
[1:22:16] of size they
[1:22:18] right
[1:22:19] be strong Joshua verse 6 and of good
[1:22:23] courage For unto these people shall now
[1:22:26] provide child thou divide
[1:22:29] for an inheritance the land
[1:22:32] which I I swear unto their fathers to
[1:22:35] give them God promised them knowing that
[1:22:38] the Jewish eyes are there and all these
[1:22:40] canonized and every night is there God
[1:22:43] said that is your land of milk and honey
[1:22:46] milk and honey imagine and yet you are
[1:22:49] still going to fight but it's yours
[1:22:51] it's yours but you are going to have to
[1:22:54] fight for every peace but it's already
[1:22:57] given to you guaranteed but what kind of
[1:22:59] language is there
[1:23:01] can you see you catch it
[1:23:03] it is not the land that you are given
[1:23:06] and now you just say oh no no no no
[1:23:07] let's eat take it easy it's our skies
[1:23:10] god let's just walk in no there's going
[1:23:14] to be battles my dear leader there's
[1:23:16] gonna be Harvest there but one thing for
[1:23:19] sure is ours and it's already been given
[1:23:23] before the foundation of the world
[1:23:24] that's right all what Joshua has been
[1:23:26] told here is that he must be of good
[1:23:28] courage because he has given a great
[1:23:31] task and that Joshua is our Holy Spirit
[1:23:33] he's the that is why the prophet had to
[1:23:36] leave Moses had to die Moses could he
[1:23:38] had to move up the scene so that Joshua
[1:23:41] can take place so that Joshua can take
[1:23:43] the people into the land and divide for
[1:23:46] them The Inheritance it cannot be Moses
[1:23:48] brother Brendan cannot cannot cannot
[1:23:50] take you into heaven
[1:23:53] going to be in all these mystical body
[1:23:56] at the same time
[1:23:58] his family Moses of our time
[1:24:02] took us out come out of them Revelation
[1:24:05] 10 verse 7. he took us out that Mighty
[1:24:09] he came took us outcome out of her and
[1:24:12] we came out
[1:24:13] after coming out now we walked the
[1:24:16] journey opened up the Red Sea we saw all
[1:24:18] the Red Seas and everything we ate the
[1:24:20] Manna we drink water that was bitter and
[1:24:22] it was sweet everything right I don't
[1:24:24] want to preach I want
[1:24:25] and then
[1:24:26] we get to cross the Jordan when we close
[1:24:30] Jordan there was a place called
[1:24:31] cardespania
[1:24:33] that place that God Espana was a problem
[1:24:37] because others believe that they can't
[1:24:39] go through there but there was two guys
[1:24:42] whose names were named Joshua and Caleb
[1:24:45] they said but we can take this place why
[1:24:49] God spoke to him man
[1:24:53] you can take that land we have already
[1:24:56] saw the result you have seen the
[1:24:58] promises you have seen everything you
[1:25:00] have even already seen the shadow why do
[1:25:03] you want to believe that you can make it
[1:25:04] you have already made it
[1:25:07] only thing that the Lord is asking be of
[1:25:09] good courage for there is an inheritance
[1:25:14] do you know what is an inheritance yes
[1:25:16] and inheritance is a massive thing so
[1:25:19] the Heavenly inheritance no executor
[1:25:22] here on Earth can manage it the estate
[1:25:24] is too big
[1:25:26] complicated it's big
[1:25:29] your inheritance is you man but that's
[1:25:34] why B that is why those double sides
[1:25:37] they must be moves
[1:25:43] now
[1:25:45] you're going to divide them an
[1:25:46] inheritance which I saw to their fathers
[1:25:49] okay verse 7 be strong and be courageous
[1:25:52] let's go to verse eight now listen to
[1:25:54] this
[1:25:55] therefore God says to Joshua therefore I
[1:25:58] want to this book
[1:25:59] this book of the law shall not depart
[1:26:02] out of thy mouth
[1:26:04] the book in the mouth
[1:26:06] John said that he ate the book yeah ah
[1:26:11] and it was sweet and when it came it was
[1:26:14] better
[1:26:16] The book must never depart from you this
[1:26:18] book
[1:26:19] today is in the form of the Bible boys
[1:26:22] it must not depart from your mouth this
[1:26:25] book then
[1:26:27] that's what the Lord says to Joshua day
[1:26:30] it must never depart
[1:26:32] you must meditate upon it day and night
[1:26:36] and that thou mess may have observed to
[1:26:39] do according to all
[1:26:41] can we say all all that is written there
[1:26:45] in and then Thou shalt make thy Way
[1:26:49] Prosper us
[1:26:51] and then Thou shalt have good success
[1:26:54] only if you be courageous
[1:26:58] you take this book of the law of God
[1:27:01] remember now they live in the time of
[1:27:05] the law we live in the law now today the
[1:27:07] law of Grace me and you that's the law
[1:27:11] that you must take and never allow it to
[1:27:14] depart not the paper
[1:27:17] the word of God to meditate upon it day
[1:27:20] and night because when you do that
[1:27:23] that's when you meet the captain because
[1:27:25] when you meet him you meditate about him
[1:27:28] he comes closer to you if you don't
[1:27:32] you have not following this instruction
[1:27:34] and you are calling yourself a a real
[1:27:37] true picture of what happened during
[1:27:39] Joshua's time
[1:27:41] no don't let God
[1:27:43] don't let your father down he has paid
[1:27:46] too much of a price yes I meant now
[1:27:50] in the message adoption now what is the
[1:27:53] land promised to the New Testament
[1:27:55] believer what is it let's go down a
[1:27:57] little bit just to see
[1:27:59] um
[1:28:03] what what what what is the Promised Land
[1:28:06] huh in the New Testament the promised
[1:28:08] land is the holy spirit okay for it
[1:28:11] shall come to pass in the last days Joel
[1:28:14] 2 28 that I will pour my spirit upon All
[1:28:17] Flesh and your sons and your daughters
[1:28:20] shall prophesy and upon my handmaids and
[1:28:23] my make servants we I will pour out my
[1:28:26] spirit and they shall prophesy let's
[1:28:28] quickly jump to the next one
[1:28:30] I want to read the way it says uh
[1:28:35] you know you know he is talking about
[1:28:36] when Joshua after they crossed Jordan
[1:28:39] Joshua went through the camp and he was
[1:28:41] working that's what he's doing Joshua
[1:28:43] our Joshua he's walking through the camp
[1:28:45] making sure everybody is ready everybody
[1:28:49] has done everything right
[1:28:51] because we have crossed right go through
[1:28:54] the midst of the camp and clean your
[1:28:55] clothes and sanctify
[1:28:57] huh clean your clothes
[1:29:00] remember the three stages
[1:29:07] let no man come to his wife and within
[1:29:10] three days you will see the glory of the
[1:29:12] Lord and is
[1:29:14] the process of getting ready to inherit
[1:29:16] the promise
[1:29:17] when you get ready to inherit the
[1:29:19] promise you don't play games
[1:29:21] you did
[1:29:24] you clean
[1:29:25] you get ready
[1:29:28] now the promise to Israel was God gave
[1:29:32] Abraham the promise of the land of

[1:29:45] what about you
[1:29:47] he's between the lines this is a love
[1:29:50] letter your promise is forever no God
[1:29:52] does not change his mind When God Says
[1:29:55] something he's done he does not reverse
[1:29:58] it when he says our man he called you
[1:30:00] before
[1:30:02] yeah yeah and then whether you like it

[1:32:59] here at church more no no it's reality
[1:33:02] it must be engraved in your heart we are
[1:33:05] going to pause because I can't finish
[1:33:07] this anymore
[1:33:08] and it's so long and it's so nice
[1:33:14] and just take a sip
[1:33:20] right
[1:33:21] where are we sister Talia
[1:33:24] we are in the paragraph
[1:33:26] middle from 39 thank you
[1:33:30] do you notice Joshua before they crossed
[1:33:32] Jordan Joshua said go through the midst
[1:33:35] of the camp and clean your clothes and
[1:33:36] sanctify every one of you and let no one
[1:33:38] come to his wife and within three days
[1:33:40] you are going to Cross Jordan
[1:33:42] Over Now The Promise
[1:33:45] to Israel was God gave Abraham and God
[1:33:49] does not go back right let's go to the
[1:33:51] next paragraph
[1:33:52] there was three stages okay we spoke
[1:33:55] about that let's not waste more time on
[1:33:57] that one
[1:33:58] I want us to go to the bottom one and
[1:34:00] that that's that's where
[1:34:02] the believer comes
[1:34:04] he comes first to a recognition that
[1:34:07] he's a sinner this is just a
[1:34:09] continuation of the stages
[1:34:10] we passed that stage are we together we
[1:34:13] passed we have already recognized that
[1:34:14] we are we were Sinners that's why we
[1:34:16] repented we got baptized ah we already
[1:34:19] passed that stage I want us to zoom into
[1:34:21] this go down
[1:34:23] um down to the middle of the paragraph
[1:34:24] where he says now then being justified
[1:34:27] by faith and he becomes a partaker and a
[1:34:30] peace with God through Christ baptized
[1:34:33] into the name of Jesus Christ to Omit
[1:34:35] him into the journey you get it into the
[1:34:38] journey thus he becomes a surgeoner and
[1:34:41] a pilgrim he is on his journey to what
[1:34:44] a promise that God made
[1:34:46] us you and me right but Believers the
[1:34:50] Believers that Kenneth and Joshua outfit
[1:34:53] that was going on to the promise they
[1:34:55] moved on over into the land and took the
[1:34:57] land and settled down in the land as a
[1:35:00] possession right and we never stop at
[1:35:04] justification we move let's not stop at
[1:35:08] Believing on the Lord Jesus Christ and
[1:35:09] the Lord Jesus being baptized and let's
[1:35:11] not stop because he cleaned us up for a
[1:35:16] life of for from a life of sin but now
[1:35:19] we we press on into the position to a
[1:35:23] promise
[1:35:24] of the baptism of the Holy Spirit which
[1:35:27] is our actual
[1:35:29] possession he was in there there's
[1:35:32] everything that you need amen
[1:35:34] some of them don't even know that you
[1:35:36] need they're in there
[1:35:39] for Peter said unto the day of Pentecost
[1:35:41] for the promise is unto you and unto
[1:35:44] your children
[1:35:46] and to them that are far off into the me
[1:35:49] huh and as even as many as the Lord Our
[1:35:53] God shall call you notice Joshua after
[1:35:55] crossing over the land and taking the
[1:35:58] land and then divided the land Israel
[1:36:02] here Manas are here and this one day God
[1:36:05] yeah Benjamin here he divided the land
[1:36:07] that is why we are given different gifts
[1:36:11] that is why we are given different
[1:36:14] inheritances same land same Nation but
[1:36:17] he's going to give to a prophecy he's
[1:36:19] got a gift of that he's got a gift of
[1:36:20] what he's got a gift of huh why because
[1:36:23] manasa but one body one is the hand one
[1:36:27] is a head when you say I when you say
[1:36:30] this when you say that one body
[1:36:33] the land has been divided amen and we
[1:36:36] must keep our land
[1:36:39] we cannot afford to lose it
[1:36:42] right the fullness of the word of God as
[1:36:46] we read in the Bible should dwell in US
[1:36:49] there'll come a time when the fullness
[1:36:51] of God is going to tell in you right now
[1:36:53] is still in a measure you're still
[1:36:56] within a measure but you you know you
[1:36:58] you you you you can feel that way you
[1:37:01] can feel that the Lord is with me but
[1:37:03] you're still having it within the
[1:37:04] measure they're gonna come a time
[1:37:07] when when everything that our man can do
[1:37:10] I can also do hahaha when everything
[1:37:13] that I can do he can do amen they'll
[1:37:15] come in right now he's still within a
[1:37:17] measure he's in a hand and I'm still
[1:37:19] maybe an ear and maybe for the agency
[1:37:22] you say me
[1:37:26] you see right now we are still given
[1:37:28] different parts of our but once we get
[1:37:31] there all Heaven is yours man
[1:37:34] all Heaven is yours what you want is
[1:37:36] there Hallelujah
[1:37:40] no I want to pause because this sermon I
[1:37:44] would like to come and preach it again
[1:37:45] one day maybe we'll finish it on your
[1:37:47] Wednesday we'll focus on our two points
[1:37:49] but before we finish
[1:37:51] uh the book is part of inheritance
[1:37:56] right that book is part of our
[1:37:58] inheritance it is part of the placement
[1:38:00] in position the inspiration anointing
[1:38:03] from the book reveals the positional
[1:38:05] placement right it reveals who you are
[1:38:09] and you get placed I was sitting here
[1:38:11] and praying one night and the Lord said
[1:38:14] go and talk about being positioned
[1:38:16] positionally
[1:38:18] being placed positionally and I start to
[1:38:21] write I write I write I write then half
[1:38:25] of the things that I wrote I haven't
[1:38:26] arrived to them yet but he says
[1:38:29] you must be placed positionally
[1:38:33] when you are placed positionally then
[1:38:36] you you've got the whole understanding
[1:38:39] the whole view of who is who in this
[1:38:41] body
[1:38:42] you you don't grab the duty in the body
[1:38:46] of another part of the body because you
[1:38:48] have been placed
[1:38:49] and the placement is within the word of
[1:38:52] God hallelujah
[1:38:54] there's so much to talk about if there
[1:38:56] is going to divide the land he must then
[1:38:59] we must be able to keep and maintain
[1:39:02] that land
[1:39:03] we must be able to do that we must be
[1:39:07] able to remember and there was those
[1:39:11] people there in that land
[1:39:12] they they were fighting
[1:39:15] we'll come to see later on when you talk
[1:39:17] of the other two points that uh that
[1:39:20] that battle is around our spirit and and
[1:39:23] there's Kings there
[1:39:25] of that land
[1:39:27] you say you've got the Holy Ghost yes
[1:39:29] Joshua is in us he walks in around the
[1:39:32] camp but hey guess what they are the
[1:39:35] kings of the jebusites with funny names
[1:39:37] even worse than the country names
[1:39:41] you will hear about them
[1:39:50] huh did I take very long brother Jimmy
[1:39:52] very sweet I didn't know yeah I mean
[1:39:55] it's just half past level now
[1:39:58] but you may finish quickly
[1:40:00] do you allow me just 20 more minutes
[1:40:03] maybe we can grab that point
[1:40:05] and we leave the last point and we can
[1:40:08] grab that point and just chew it in as
[1:40:11] part of the head always say just chew
[1:40:13] just when you eat building you don't lie
[1:40:15] no no no no no no no no
[1:40:19] you know what you do
[1:40:22] you listen to how it tastes
[1:40:24] carefully and you listen to it
[1:40:30] while you are listening
[1:40:33] that's how
[1:40:34] [Music]
[1:40:37] so
[1:40:38] let's just take that point and chew it
[1:40:41] and just absorb it right
[1:40:44] keeping and maintaining your possession
[1:40:47] now
[1:40:49] we've crossed the lane
[1:40:51] we've done we are done with Jericho
[1:40:54] the request done I'm no more drinking
[1:40:56] I'm no more doing all sorts of things
[1:40:58] right I'm in the Lord now now it's time
[1:41:01] now once you enter Cannon remember
[1:41:04] there's still Wars
[1:41:06] they're still battles but Joshua yes
[1:41:09] Joshua is dead and the captain of the
[1:41:11] house is also there right but Joshua is
[1:41:14] there to fight and be in the front for
[1:41:17] you but you must walk do the walk yeah
[1:41:20] and every piece of land where you put
[1:41:23] your foot on is yours
[1:41:25] did you hear that
[1:41:28] uh this is to encourage you to motivate
[1:41:31] you to refresh you that hey it might be
[1:41:34] tough at times it might be difficult it
[1:41:38] might look impossible you might be
[1:41:40] discouraged but the Lord Joshua the Holy
[1:41:44] Spirit
[1:41:46] he's there
[1:41:47] to encourage you to motivate you to
[1:41:50] revive you to remind you
[1:41:54] that remember the land is yours just
[1:41:57] keep walking
[1:41:59] keep walking
[1:42:01] right
[1:42:02] because the more you walk every piece of
[1:42:05] land
[1:42:06] promise
[1:42:09] everyone if you are working here and
[1:42:12] there was no minerals here in this in
[1:42:15] this sport here there was no gold
[1:42:17] and diamond and all the natural
[1:42:19] resources and then maybe maybe two
[1:42:22] meters away from there there is there is
[1:42:24] just a
[1:42:26] do you know
[1:42:28] a drum
[1:42:29] do you know that 200 drum container what
[1:42:32] do you call it
[1:42:34] that 201 blue one okay those plastic
[1:42:37] ones a big one
[1:42:38] that we used to have the steel ones you
[1:42:41] used to push it with water
[1:42:43] you know maybe there's a gold there of
[1:42:45] that size the moment I do that it's mine
[1:42:48] just amazing the moment I step on the
[1:42:50] ground that is also my everything
[1:42:52] underneath it and above
[1:42:54] and the base above it their mind
[1:42:56] everything
[1:42:58] is yours so the key is to keep
[1:43:01] working amen no matter how hard no
[1:43:05] matter how difficult why why should I
[1:43:08] tolerate that because it's already been
[1:43:11] given to you
[1:43:12] it's already yours
[1:43:15] you forgot remember you left Egypt
[1:43:18] you left Egypt and remember you opened
[1:43:20] the Red Sea for you
[1:43:21] remember he killed the first bonds of
[1:43:23] pharaoh for who
[1:43:25] that was Moses we came out of them we
[1:43:28] came out of Egypt the Lord did so many
[1:43:30] things along the way there was mixed
[1:43:33] small tissues and those Miss multitude
[1:43:36] their purpose they were agents agents of
[1:43:39] the devil that were planted among the
[1:43:41] people of God that wanted to take them
[1:43:43] back to Egypt kindness and jambres and
[1:43:46] then and when the prophet of God
[1:43:49] disappeared and he went to the mountain
[1:43:51] to speak with God they started to say a
[1:43:54] book is not his
[1:43:56] sorry to say that
[1:43:58] but we can't allow that
[1:44:01] the seven Church eight book
[1:44:03] the prophet authenticated this and he
[1:44:06] read it and he approved it that's it
[1:44:09] right so we cannot allow no no but
[1:44:11] that's not what the prophet's book
[1:44:12] that's evil doctrines yes we are we have
[1:44:15] passed that we came out of Janice and
[1:44:18] dembrose they must die amen
[1:44:22] that'll be
[1:44:24] so
[1:44:25] how do we keep our our positions
[1:44:29] let's go to
[1:44:31] spoken note of adoption also at adoption
[1:44:34] one
[1:44:36] and now after you are in
[1:44:38] you're in now you're in
[1:44:42] that don't mean that you are out free
[1:44:44] from war
[1:44:46] you still have to fight I tell you I'm
[1:44:49] going to pay 7A
[1:44:51] you still have to fight for every inch
[1:44:54] of ground you stand on
[1:44:56] see so see Canon did not represent great
[1:45:01] Heaven because his war and troubles and
[1:45:04] killings and fightings and so forth but
[1:45:08] it did represent this
[1:45:10] that it must be a perfect walk
[1:45:13] you see now let me show you how you keep
[1:45:16] your position let's let's go let's read
[1:45:18] the story of David how many knows David
[1:45:21] the story of David okay let me just
[1:45:24] start off by saying I wrote some few
[1:45:25] statements there I say you see your
[1:45:27] position in Christ is determined
[1:45:29] determines and reveals your possession
[1:45:33] he if you're not within your position
[1:45:36] you
[1:45:37] know not really clearly see your
[1:45:39] possessions or even easily acquire them
[1:45:42] because you are out of position
[1:45:44] if you think of
[1:45:45] a game of soccer huh or a game of rugby
[1:45:49] you must be in position of you must run
[1:45:51] around but you must keep your position
[1:45:53] if you are a flank
[1:45:55] and you find that on the flank is empty
[1:45:57] you were running you wanted to make it
[1:45:59] right
[1:46:00] lose your position we take you out we
[1:46:02] must replace you
[1:46:04] in in rugby or in game in soccer
[1:46:06] whatever right but now you keep your
[1:46:09] position
[1:46:10] while you are supporting other fellow
[1:46:12] team members
[1:46:16] the Bible says that uh you know in first
[1:46:19] Samuel chapter 17 and I'm watching my
[1:46:22] time
[1:46:23] and earlier this is David's brother
[1:46:26] Elliot
[1:46:28] remember you are David and you're going
[1:46:30] to have aliens
[1:46:33] he's eldest brother
[1:46:35] had when he spake unto The Man David was
[1:46:39] sent home to come and visit them to give
[1:46:41] them some fresh dry fruits to give them
[1:46:43] some water to see how the oil is doing
[1:46:45] and report to the father now he arrived
[1:46:47] now the Big Brother hear him talking to
[1:46:49] the men at War
[1:46:51] he hears him ah your flesh your brother
[1:46:55] who is still small in the in the in the
[1:46:57] in the in the faith he hears you
[1:47:01] say I am healed say ah the Lord is
[1:47:04] giving me this he hears you and he comes
[1:47:06] to you and says hey hey
[1:47:08] and Elliott's anger was kindled
[1:47:10] sometimes your brother's Elders gonna be
[1:47:12] kindled upon you
[1:47:14] against David and he said why come is
[1:47:17] down down hida
[1:47:19] he was not asking him softly he said
[1:47:21] sorry I remember he was asking him
[1:47:23] Ashley
[1:47:24] David invested in
[1:47:27] he says to you I know your high pride
[1:47:30] and your naughtiness of your heart for
[1:47:33] now I'd come down here that you might
[1:47:35] see the battle
[1:47:36] just imagine why is David not if he came
[1:47:39] to see the bed why is he naughty now why
[1:47:43] is he proud
[1:47:44] yeah sometimes the devil can use your
[1:47:48] brother your sister just remember it's
[1:47:51] not your brother it's the devil watch
[1:47:53] out be careful no your sister know the
[1:47:57] devil
[1:47:58] right
[1:48:00] he's a daddy's brother
[1:48:03] they know that David killed Elio
[1:48:06] they know
[1:48:07] they know that David was anointed by
[1:48:10] someone they know
[1:48:12] right
[1:48:14] but when you say oh I am healed you know
[1:48:16] the Lord has healed me oh no I'm gonna
[1:48:18] get that job or that deal I'm gonna get
[1:48:20] it oh you know my child is going to be
[1:48:22] healed and restored my husband my wife
[1:48:25] when you confess those
[1:48:27] your big brother come and say no you
[1:48:30] must be careful
[1:48:31] huh I know your pride win
[1:48:34] he talked to you like that
[1:48:37] and then what must you say David just
[1:48:40] said
[1:48:42] what have I done now in verse 20 can you
[1:48:44] see 29 yeah David says what have I done
[1:48:47] now
[1:48:48] is there not a Cause
[1:48:51] he doesn't talk too much he just asked
[1:48:53] his big brother your flesh can be your
[1:48:56] elium
[1:48:58] and he wants to dispute your faith when
[1:49:01] you are David inside there saying her my
[1:49:04] hobby my husband is gonna be restored my
[1:49:07] wife will be delivered my child will be
[1:49:10] delivered
[1:49:12] your ellipses are
[1:49:13] take it easy actually you're not even
[1:49:17] supposed to be here in the middle I know
[1:49:18] your pride to you I know you're
[1:49:20] naughtiness if you hear those words you
[1:49:22] must know that it's early up yeah
[1:49:24] because he knows he was not anointed
[1:49:27] so you don't listen to such things just
[1:49:30] ask him what have I done
[1:49:31] what have I done to you your body to
[1:49:33] tell me that I can't get my inheritance
[1:49:36] what have I done
[1:49:38] verse 30 and he turned from him and
[1:49:41] toward another they speak like the same
[1:49:43] manner
[1:49:45] sometimes you'll find the whole lot is
[1:49:47] against what you are saying
[1:49:49] doesn't mean you are wrong
[1:49:53] all sorts of accusations can come your
[1:49:55] way remember job
[1:49:57] all his friends they blamed you
[1:50:00] just know who you are does not be in
[1:50:03] your position and know that you are a
[1:50:05] son and you are a daughter no amount of
[1:50:08] accusation can determine your
[1:50:10] destination and your inheritance
[1:50:13] just don't take a lie of Satan
[1:50:16] don't take anything negative even from
[1:50:20] your eyes even from your flesh
[1:50:23] don't take it be in the spiritual realm
[1:50:26] where everything the devil says is wrong
[1:50:30] I told you before even if the devil can
[1:50:32] tell you the truth tell him is the lion
[1:50:36] it's not it's not true to talk at that
[1:50:39] guy
[1:50:40] he's not a truth talker even if he tells
[1:50:42] you the truth tell him you lie
[1:50:45] how can you speak the truth it must be a
[1:50:47] lie
[1:50:48] now David
[1:50:52] and he went to everyone he was talking
[1:50:54] there then they were blaming him
[1:50:56] everybody talking the same manner the
[1:50:58] Bible says
[1:50:59] and then investor
[1:51:02] uh
[1:51:04] 32.
[1:51:07] right listen to the man who takes his
[1:51:10] inheritance
[1:51:11] and David came to the he came to the
[1:51:13] king and David said to Saul
[1:51:16] let no man's heart fail
[1:51:19] because
[1:51:21] of him who this philistine
[1:51:24] right
[1:51:26] thy said and will go and fight with this
[1:51:28] philistine Goliath
[1:51:31] how can this boy says if you come to
[1:51:34] think of it
[1:51:35] if now just think about this we are in
[1:51:38] the house
[1:51:39] my wife and everybody were sitting there
[1:51:41] and we hear a big bang
[1:51:46] on the door
[1:51:48] and I want to try to stand up my my son
[1:51:50] here for instance Papa wait wait
[1:51:53] I'll handle that
[1:51:56] I I I'll I'll I'll check by the door
[1:52:02] Elia
[1:52:05] Elliot he wants to say what I know
[1:52:09] you're nothing
[1:52:16] now just I'm trying to bring you to the
[1:52:19] day when David said to the king
[1:52:22] my Lord
[1:52:24] don't worry let not every man here
[1:52:27] soldiers super soldiers seniors and a
[1:52:31] head of the chief of the general of salt
[1:52:33] he says let all of them please my Lord
[1:52:36] let them not worry
[1:52:38] I will fight this for this time
[1:52:41] how do you think Soul thought about that
[1:52:43] right yeah yes
[1:52:45] okay let me practicalize it then now
[1:52:47] comes
[1:52:48] in this house and the Malachi is
[1:52:52] dead hold on it's just going to the room
[1:52:56] I'll manage that I'll handle it for you
[1:53:01] I don't know what Andy will say
[1:53:03] but me I'm gonna say I know you're
[1:53:06] naughty
[1:53:09] why because I'm operating on the flesh
[1:53:14] any up what's the problem even Saul was
[1:53:18] the problem but he was a make-believer
[1:53:21] neither done it no here he ended up
[1:53:23] saying to David okay okay okay my son
[1:53:25] I'll give you my armor
[1:53:27] you see he wants to give you David no no
[1:53:30] David wants no one's armor
[1:53:33] he's got a testimony
[1:53:35] Lord they know these eliabs What the
[1:53:38] Lord Has Done For Me
[1:53:40] in fact in such a day
[1:53:42] I was working here here and I read me a
[1:53:46] month I read in the Bible Conference
[1:53:48] with God and the Lord spoke to me I know
[1:53:50] that
[1:53:51] amen that's my testimony nobody no
[1:53:54] brother no devil will ever remove that
[1:53:56] from you that's right no one amen what
[1:53:59] the Lord did for you no one not that no
[1:54:02] amount of devil so why sometimes we
[1:54:05] allow the devil
[1:54:07] the aliens and the big brothers and
[1:54:09] ourselves to give us a doubt that we can
[1:54:12] overcome Goliath amen no
[1:54:15] keep working all I have the head will be
[1:54:18] cut keep walking
[1:54:20] right so that's our job and then they
[1:54:23] tell him they tell him they tell him and
[1:54:24] then he says my Lord I'll fight that
[1:54:26] philistine
[1:54:27] and the Soul said unto David Thou Art
[1:54:29] and thou art not able to do against this
[1:54:31] Philistine to fight this to fight with
[1:54:34] him for thou art but just a youth he's
[1:54:36] just a baby thingy
[1:54:38] what are you telling me I'm not even
[1:54:40] supposed to be discussing with you who
[1:54:41] must go to the door
[1:54:46] wanted the king to sort out David and
[1:54:50] Ascend him home
[1:54:53] and
[1:54:55] David said unto Saul die seven kept his
[1:54:59] father's sheep my Lord
[1:55:00] yeah so he's saying Daddy you are not
[1:55:03] here
[1:55:04] I was here and I had the same look
[1:55:06] during the day
[1:55:08] and when I head I opened the door I
[1:55:10] found is the devil and I said I command
[1:55:13] you in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ
[1:55:15] the one who died at the cross get thee
[1:55:17] behind me
[1:55:19] huh I said then someone listens now you
[1:55:22] did that
[1:55:23] so and and they came a lion and a bear
[1:55:26] and and took out of one of my flock out
[1:55:28] of my flock and I went out after him and
[1:55:31] I smoked the devil and they delivered
[1:55:34] out of his mouth and then when he rose
[1:55:36] against me I caught him by his bed and I
[1:55:39] smiled and flew him wow
[1:55:41] the devil
[1:55:42] so that
[1:55:44] can you see that
[1:55:48] I'm a repentful father I'm gonna say
[1:55:49] okay the Lord be with you
[1:55:52] and then he goes to the door and he
[1:55:55] sought out he sought the devil out with
[1:55:57] a slingshot amen
[1:55:59] of Grace and salvation
[1:56:03] huh and I even promised him you know us
[1:56:06] all promised David things
[1:56:11] promise anyone who defeats I'll give him
[1:56:13] I'll give them my daughter
[1:56:17] yes the whole reason why our Lord come
[1:56:18] to Earth
[1:56:20] born the way he was it was to eventually
[1:56:23] die and redeem sinful men me and you
[1:56:27] it is undebatable it's undebatable that
[1:56:30] you are a son of God we are not
[1:56:33] discussing about whether you are a
[1:56:35] daughter or a son of God that's
[1:56:37] unquestionable that's not what we are
[1:56:39] talking about we are talking about being
[1:56:41] in the land as their daughter and
[1:56:44] keeping your position
[1:56:46] maintaining it every day and night
[1:56:51] he said the Lord to Joshua and I'm
[1:56:53] finishing move not to the left or the
