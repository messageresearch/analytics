[50:10] seats now I want to I want if I could
[50:13] take a title I want to speak I just want
[50:15] to ask you the question is every door
[50:17] open is every door on your life open
[50:20] this is where we're going to go today so
[50:22] is every door open now who wants who who
[50:25] wants a greater walk with God amen amen
[50:28] who wants a Revival or a greater Revival
[50:31] amen now everyone wants that the
[50:33] Christian world you know it's it's like
[50:36] every time a coconut there's a prophecy
[50:38] comes out of a Pentecostal Church
[50:39] charismatic church God is going to move
[50:41] here we're going to have a Revival
[50:42] there's a great Revival breaking for and
[50:44] they and they're always looking for
[50:46] those things but the thing is uh you
[50:50] know people people want Revival but
[50:53] they're not prepared to be ready for the
[50:56] Revival amen so so the world wants all
[51:00] the power but they're not willing to
[51:02] give up what they have to give up to
[51:03] receive that power of that life amen
[51:06] amen so they want they want to stay in
[51:08] the state they're in and but then they
[51:10] just want to add what God can give to
[51:12] them but it doesn't work that way we
[51:14] have to empty ourselves out we have to
[51:16] get rid of we have to open every door if
[51:19] we want God to live you know he can't
[51:21] just be welcome in your entrance or in
[51:24] your kitchen or in your maybe maybe just
[51:27] one part of your life he's going to be
[51:28] welcome every part of your life amen
[51:31] amen you can't just you can't just take
[51:33] him as your savior he's got to be your
[51:35] Lord he's got to be your king amen Paul
[51:37] said Paul a prisoner of Jesus Christ and
[51:39] he was his prisoner amen amen and God
[51:43] you know brother BR makes a
[51:46] statement he says he says Paul so this
[51:49] is in the sermon Paul the prisoner of
[51:51] Jesus Christ in 63 I'd like to make the
[51:53] statement that God always has to take
[51:55] any man that will serve him truly to be
[51:58] his prisoner a man has to surrender
[52:01] every ambition he's got everything that
[52:04] he is e everything his life soul body
[52:08] will Ambitions everything else and
[52:11] become a complete a prisoner to Christ
[52:14] who is the word to serve God you might
[52:17] have to walk contrary to your better
[52:20] judgment maybe a certain organization
[52:23] you might think that they could lift you
[52:24] up and give you something great that you
[52:26] might flesh but what do you find
[52:29] yourself you find yourself defeated
[52:31] after a while until God can get a man
[52:33] that's willing to become a prisoner to
[52:35] them God is looking for prisoners he's
[52:39] always done it you might search it
[52:41] through the scripture a man has to be a
[52:43] prisoner to Christ against everything
[52:46] therefore you cannot be connected with
[52:48] anything but Christ even your father
[52:50] your mother your brother your sister
[52:52] your husband your wife anybody you're
[52:54] only connected with Christ and him only
[52:56] then God can use you until then you
[52:59] can't going out sometimes I speak rough
[53:02] to people see I'm trying to get you to
[53:04] cut loose you have to have a starting
[53:07] place like I sometimes call about women
[53:09] bobbing their hair wearing these clothes
[53:11] and holding and maintaining their
[53:12] Christian profession you say that's a
[53:14] little thing well you've got to start
[53:16] somewhere so begin right there in your
[53:19] abcc and cut loose the worldly looks
[53:22] anyhow and become a prisoner to Christ
[53:24] and then just keep on Cutting Loose
[53:27] everything till finally the last lines
[53:29] Cut Loose then you are a prisoner then
[53:32] you become in his grip he's got you in
[53:35] his grip amen amen
[53:38] see now we understand we're in a battle
[53:42] yeah and it says in 2 Corinthians 10:4
[53:45] for the weapons of our Warfare are not
[53:47] carnal But Mighty through God to the
[53:49] pulling down of strongholds in Ephesians
[53:51] 6 we understand it tells us that to put
[53:53] on the whole armor of God that you may
[53:55] be able to stand against the Ws of the
[53:57] devil so we're in a battle and in a
[53:59] battle you take prisoners you take land
[54:01] you take buildings you take hostages you
[54:03] know you know you take these things in a
[54:05] war and it's a Warfare between God and
[54:08] Satan we understand that so Satan's
[54:10] taking prisoners and God's taking
[54:12] prisoners amen but Satan takes prisoners
[54:16] he he tricks them into trapping them and
[54:18] then they're bound and then they realize
[54:20] that they're stuck but God Only Takes
[54:22] willing prisoners he doesn't take anyone
[54:25] against their will he will never Force
[54:27] the Holy Ghost into you he'll never
[54:28] Force Christianity into you he'll never
[54:31] Force anything upon you until you
[54:33] surrender and give it to him until
[54:35] you're willing to open every door in
[54:37] your life but if you don't open every
[54:40] door then he can't he can't do what he
[54:42] wants to do that's why I was praying
[54:44] there I said Lord do surgery this
[54:46] morning amen amen and and I always when
[54:49] I speak these things or study these
[54:50] things I always apply it to me too I I
[54:52] said Lord whatever has to happen just I
[54:55] want to open every door take it off the
[54:56] hinges God amen amen I don't even want
[54:59] it there Hallelujah yes now the word
[55:01] prisoner in the Greek it means to be a
[55:03] captive as bound so someone who's bound
[55:06] up now a prisoner now now if you think
[55:09] someone who who who has to go to prison
[55:12] a prisoner is someone whose life is
[55:15] totally out of their own hands yeah they
[55:17] are not in control of where they live
[55:20] they're not in control and where they go
[55:23] They're not in control of what they eat
[55:25] they're not in control of what they wear
[55:27] they're not in control of the things
[55:28] they do all of those things are out of
[55:31] their control they have no say you know
[55:34] have you ever you know imagine a prison
[55:36] trying to get to the warden's office I
[55:38] want a change of
[55:40] cell I I don't like these stripes or
[55:42] whatever they wear I don't know I want
[55:44] better food sure they all would voice
[55:46] those things but the warden will say no
[55:48] you're my prisoner this is not a
[55:50] democracy and a you say I say we meet an
[55:52] agreement no you're in
[55:54] prison amen and the warden dictates the
[55:58] conditions of the prison and what they
[55:59] eat and what they wear and what they do
[56:02] and if we're a prisoner of Christ
[56:03] remember a prisoner someone someone
[56:06] who's on the run so for example if you
[56:08] had control of any of these things that
[56:10] you can choose where you go you're not a
[56:12] prisoner you're free to move that's
[56:14] right you know where you sleep and what
[56:16] you eat and what you do you're not a
[56:17] prisoner because your yourself is in
[56:20] control of something amen so someone who
[56:24] who is on the run is not a total
[56:26] prisoner they have to be totally you
[56:30] know sleep here now yes eat this now yes
[56:33] do this now what's happening now you're
[56:35] going to do this and they have they can
[56:37] fuss about it they can fight about it
[56:39] but they're still
[56:40] prisoners God is looking for those kind
[56:42] of people this is what God this is what
[56:45] this is what it boils down to the bride
[56:47] of Christ will be a
[56:49] prisoner every part of her life every
[56:52] part hallelujah what she or he wears
[56:55] yeah amen what they do what they say
[56:58] what they watch every part amen every
[57:01] part of your being doesn't you're not
[57:03] your own the scripture says you're
[57:05] bought with a price every part well I
[57:07] have a right to wear these clothes or
[57:09] wear these shorts or cut my hair or do
[57:11] whatever no you don't that's you may but
[57:13] if you're a prisoner you don't and if
[57:15] you want to be a prisoner you say not my
[57:17] will but thy will be
[57:18] done amen you you got to be
[57:21] willing God is looking for people that
[57:25] will become prisoners to
[57:26] him
[57:29] amen you have to be willing now in a
[57:32] war there is ground that you have to
[57:36] take amen there's territory that you
[57:38] have to drive the enemy out of and if
[57:41] the enemy's been so so you know if the
[57:44] enemy is still in a place but you say
[57:46] well I have the majority of control you
[57:48] don't have full control there's still a
[57:50] dispute over the territory amen the
[57:53] enemy has to be fully driven out of a
[57:54] place and you can say this belongs to me
[57:58] yeah and it's the same thing if you take
[58:01] that at a piece of ground or a building
[58:04] or a city you know every every building
[58:07] every room has to be cleaned out of
[58:10] enemy yeah otherwise there's still a
[58:12] dispute Who belongs to what now it's the
[58:16] same thing with you and I there's more
[58:18] than just one chamber to you you're more
[58:21] than just one room that's right amen
[58:23] that's why people accept them as savior
[58:25] but they won't make him Lord amen and
[58:27] they may just make him Lord over a few
[58:29] things you can have this part of me if
[58:32] that's the case you cuz you're the
[58:34] you're your own enemy that's right amen
[58:36] before God met you you were his enemy
[58:39] you were scripture says we were enemies
[58:41] of
[58:43] God Amen that's right so unless you're
[58:45] willing to surrender see a prisoner does
[58:48] this I have no weapon in my hand I
[58:51] Surrender amen but so so in order to say
[58:56] take this building you'd have to clear
[58:58] every room you'd open have to open every
[59:00] door now God doesn't bust down doors you
[59:03] have to be willing to open you have to
[59:05] be willing to let them come into any
[59:07] part of your life yes sir amen and we're
[59:10] going to go into some stronger things
[59:11] but I want you just to keep all these
[59:13] things in
[59:15] mind so you have to be willing to open
[59:18] every part of your life oh I want
[59:20] Revival are you willing to open every
[59:22] part if you're not willing to open every
[59:24] part God's not going to pour himself in
[59:26] amen
[59:28] amen now the human heart is exactly the
[59:30] same way as a
[59:32] building you know there's there's
[59:34] there's more than one door to the heart
[59:36] and Jesus has to have full access in
[59:38] order that that life to become a
[59:40] prisoner to
[59:41] his and the scripture says for for as he
[59:45] thinketh in his heart so is he the first
[59:46] part of that verse proverbs
[59:49] 237 so it's not it's not in here
[59:52] remember brother brah he speaks about a
[59:54] man has a conscious and a
[59:56] subconscious and it's and and he says
[59:58] it's like a ship so there's the man
[1:00:00] who's driving the boat who says Go full
[1:00:02] steam ahead or reverse or whatever and
[1:00:04] then that order goes down to the engine
[1:00:06] room remember in the old days they'd
[1:00:07] have a they'd have a you know
[1:00:09] acceleration wheel thing and then that
[1:00:10] would turn up PSA to go full steam ahead
[1:00:13] then the same thing would happen down
[1:00:14] the engine room full steam they say okay
[1:00:15] boys shovel the colon yeah and that's
[1:00:18] how they drive the boat but it's so
[1:00:20] ultimately it's not the man who's
[1:00:22] steering the boat who is actually in
[1:00:24] control control it's the man in the
[1:00:25] engine room because if the captain says
[1:00:28] full steam ahead but all the guys in the
[1:00:30] engine room are sleeping with their
[1:00:32] shovels there not pumping any colon the
[1:00:34] boat's not going to go anywhere it's the
[1:00:36] man in the engine room that has control
[1:00:38] so it's not the man it's not the man up
[1:00:41] here who mentally wants to be right it's
[1:00:44] this man that's right this man down here
[1:00:47] is in control in your heart I mean this
[1:00:49] part of you cuz many people verbally say
[1:00:51] I believe the message I believe the word
[1:00:53] I believe Jesus up here but it's got to
[1:00:55] sink down into here yes and when this
[1:00:58] man says I give up am amen then God has
[1:01:01] control of the boat amen amen glory we
[1:01:05] want to we all want to go on a Rapture
[1:01:08] amen we all want to be his this is this
[1:01:10] is the one thing you must be born again
[1:01:12] amen and to be born again you must be
[1:01:14] willing to open every door to to truly
[1:01:17] be
[1:01:19] birthed now he says Us in do in uh he
[1:01:24] says doors and door and 65 if you
[1:01:26] haven't listened to this go listen to it
[1:01:28] now you say is that right brother Bram

[1:03:50] me and jump up there in the middle of my
[1:03:52] work and go to speak in tongues and it
[1:03:54] would humiliate me no stay out of there
[1:03:57] oh there you are see yeah you'll let
[1:03:59] Jesus come in you'll join the church put
[1:04:01] your name on accept Jesus as your savior
[1:04:04] but what about being your lord when he's
[1:04:07] got full sway see he can only be your
[1:04:10] lord if he's got full sway he can't have
[1:04:13] a little he can't just have you know a
[1:04:15] kingdom is not you know if this country
[1:04:19] rose up and said we're a republic well
[1:04:22] the Queen of England isn't Queen over
[1:04:24] this nation anymore amen or if there's a
[1:04:26] dispute like a civil war breaks out or
[1:04:28] something you know then then this place
[1:04:31] is disputed she's not fully Queen over
[1:04:32] the domain amen and if there's part of
[1:04:36] you that's actually say no you can't you
[1:04:38] can't rearrange this part of my life God
[1:04:40] that he not your lord
[1:04:44] yet when he's Lord he's or It All
[1:04:48] Belongs to him see you've completely
[1:04:51] surrendered to him now but that little
[1:04:53] pride oh you you mean for us woman we
[1:04:55] have to let our hair grow well that's
[1:04:57] what he said now if you read 1
[1:04:59] Corinthians 11 it says about long hair
[1:05:02] and that word long in the Greek means
[1:05:04] select grow and it's only used twice in
[1:05:06] the Bible in that in in that verse and
[1:05:08] it says if you cut it you might as well
[1:05:10] shave it off he says and the hair is
[1:05:11] given for a covering amen so to let grow
[1:05:15] is to not to cut it that's what the
[1:05:17] scripture
[1:05:18] says so that's why he says
[1:05:20] it
[1:05:22] oh we're going to have to quit wearing
[1:05:24] manicure or or makeup stuff that's what
[1:05:27] he said well what do you think about
[1:05:29] sewing Circle wood what would they
[1:05:31] that'd call me old fashioned praise God
[1:05:33] now you may think you're going down a
[1:05:35] legalistic line but I'm going to show
[1:05:36] you no it's not I'm going to get to it
[1:05:40] because if you let him and and in this
[1:05:42] in this message you hear him he says you
[1:05:44] let him come in and do it yes amen but
[1:05:47] you have to be willing to open the door
[1:05:50] oh he oh I'm waiting for him to change
[1:05:51] me have you opened the door if you
[1:05:53] haven't if he hasn't changed you you
[1:05:55] haven't opened the door that's right
[1:05:56] it's really that Elementary yeah amen
[1:05:59] amen well just keep your pride go ahead
[1:06:02] he'll stand at the door that's all the
[1:06:03] father he can get but when you really
[1:06:06] open that door let him come in he'll
[1:06:08] clean it out of you shorts will go out
[1:06:11] of here in the garbage can and makeup
[1:06:12] will go back to the garbage can and the
[1:06:15] bar will starve to death if he's just
[1:06:17] got to cut woman's here to a real
[1:06:19] believer now I'll say oh yes it does too
[1:06:22] that's what the Bible said that's right
[1:06:24] see there's a little word there that you
[1:06:26] don't want a meddling well my pastor I
[1:06:29] don't care what your pastor said that's
[1:06:30] what the Bible said it's a shame for a
[1:06:32] woman to do so well you say you ought to
[1:06:34] teach us things brother bandam it's how
[1:06:36] to get the Holy Ghost and how to do this
[1:06:39] how you going to learn algebra if you
[1:06:40] don't learn your ABCs he's your example
[1:06:44] try to be like him and the spirit in you
[1:06:46] the spirit in you will help you to do
[1:06:49] that make your life like his yeah
[1:06:51] there's a door there I want to call
[1:06:53] another door door there's another door
[1:06:56] there just next to that door that's the
[1:06:58] door to your private
[1:06:59] life oh you don't want him messing with
[1:07:02] that now I want you to go he says now if
[1:07:05] I want to go out to a little cocktail
[1:07:07] party what is it to you what church is
[1:07:09] going to tell me what I'm going to do
[1:07:11] ahuh there you are see a tenth of my
[1:07:13] wages who's going to tell me what to do
[1:07:15] that's my own private life I make this
[1:07:17] money I have my own life I'll wear
[1:07:19] shorts if I want to that's my own
[1:07:21] American privilege I'll say New Zealand
[1:07:23] privilege whatever nationality you want
[1:07:25] to put that is true sure but if you're a
[1:07:27] lamb not a goat SE a lamb is what he's
[1:07:30] after now a lamb have you ever who's
[1:07:33] who's ever worked on a farm who's ever
[1:07:36] done docking who's ever picked up a lamb
[1:07:39] who's ever picked up a lamb now I done
[1:07:42] some docking in my life growing up help
[1:07:45] help pick up the lambs now when you pick
[1:07:47] up the lamb he struggles a little bit
[1:07:49] just a little bit but when he feels your
[1:07:50] firm hands he quits he quits fighting
[1:07:54] amen when he feels your firm hands he
[1:07:57] just you know he just doesn't kick and
[1:08:00] so they only kick a little bit if you
[1:08:02] hold them Loosely but if you hold them
[1:08:04] tight they just give up who's
[1:08:07] experienced that you understand so
[1:08:10] you've got to realize that he has you
[1:08:13] amen you've got to that's the reason
[1:08:14] people kick and they say well I don't I
[1:08:16] don't know if I can do that you got to
[1:08:18] realize that he has you amen because I
[1:08:21] believe I'm looking at lambs and Lambs
[1:08:23] only check if they if if they don't
[1:08:25] think that the person's got them but as
[1:08:27] soon as you pick them up tight they feel
[1:08:29] your I was just a boy when I did it I
[1:08:31] wasn't like that I was like 10 picking
[1:08:34] up Lambs helping them dock the Lambs but
[1:08:36] you know you've got to realize that he
[1:08:38] has you and and if you realize that he
[1:08:42] has you you won't kick amen he you know
[1:08:46] you won't kick but if you don't realize
[1:08:48] that he has you you'll keep kicking he
[1:08:51] has you amen you're engraved in the palm
[1:08:53] of a
[1:08:54] of his hands the scripture says amen he
[1:08:57] says can a woman forget her child yes
[1:09:00] maybe but I can never forget Israel and
[1:09:02] you're the spiritual Israel amen amen
[1:09:05] you got to realize that he has you
[1:09:07] there's the same just continue down the
[1:09:10] same quote a sheep has wool that's the
[1:09:12] only thing it has and it can't
[1:09:14] manufacture that wool you're not asked
[1:09:16] to manufacture the fruit of the spirit
[1:09:19] but to Bear the fruit of the spirit and
[1:09:20] as long as it's a sheep it'll bear don't
[1:09:23] have to manufacture the glands and
[1:09:25] everything's in the Sheep it'll make the
[1:09:27] wool because the inside of them has the
[1:09:29] glands and the adrenaline and the stuff
[1:09:31] that makes wool and when you're a
[1:09:32] Christian you'll cope with the word I
[1:09:34] don't care what anyone else says you
[1:09:36] don't have to work up nothing and bring
[1:09:39] down nothing pull and pump up you're a
[1:09:41] Christian you just automatically bear
[1:09:44] the fruit of the spirit see and that's
[1:09:46] the way it is see but people today they
[1:09:49] don't want you fooling with their
[1:09:51] private life only thing you do just just
[1:09:53] open up every door around and say come
[1:09:56] on in Jesus watch what happens when you
[1:09:59] see in the book you're supposed to do
[1:10:01] this you'll do it why you're a sheep to
[1:10:03] begin with but if you just want to sit
[1:10:06] keep him at the door just say see this
[1:10:08] is this is just keeping him at the door
[1:10:11] just say I've joined church I'm as good
[1:10:13] as you see I've accepted Christ or I've
[1:10:15] just added this in here I've accepted
[1:10:17] the message I've been baptized I believe
[1:10:19] brother BR is Malachi 4 maybe that's
[1:10:22] just what You' done but did you make him
[1:10:25] Lord amen did you make him
[1:10:29] Lord you have to be willing because
[1:10:32] let's go to 1 Corinthians
[1:10:36] 13 Paul was a
[1:10:39] prisoner amen he's looking for prisoners
[1:10:41] you say have you made him have you just
[1:10:43] let every door have you opened every
[1:10:47] door amen because I believe I believe
[1:10:50] God it says in Hebrews I think 13 our
[1:10:53] God is a consuming fire amen so if
[1:10:56] there's something in your life that you
[1:10:58] just can't seem to overcome open the
[1:10:59] door let that fire come in and consume
[1:11:01] it amen amen I believe I believe God is
[1:11:05] present to purge whatever needs purging
[1:11:07] you just have to open the door amen amen
[1:11:11] 1 Corinthians 13 and verse1 now these
[1:11:14] when it speaks about charity here it
[1:11:15] speaks of divine love and it's saying
[1:11:18] about this is the attributes it comes
[1:11:20] down this is the characteristics of
[1:11:21] divine love cuz every says well we love
[1:11:24] one another and we do love one another
[1:11:26] but as I said I think maybe last Sunday
[1:11:29] don't just you know well you say well we
[1:11:31] have love for each other in the church
[1:11:33] absolutely we do cuz God's present but
[1:11:36] don't just don't just put that as the as
[1:11:39] the defining thing well that means I
[1:11:41] have the Holy Ghost amen because you can
[1:11:45] just be part of I could say you could
[1:11:46] just be part of come under the anointing
[1:11:48] that's in the church and because you're
[1:11:50] under that anointing you say well I'm
[1:11:52] part of it I'll say this Israel coming
[1:11:55] out of Egypt they're under an
[1:11:57] anointing they all Miriam took the
[1:11:59] tambourine after they crossed the Red
[1:12:00] Sea they all danced and had a wonderful
[1:12:03] time and they could say well I came
[1:12:06] under the anointing therefore I'm going
[1:12:07] to go into the land but when they came
[1:12:09] to the land when they came to that
[1:12:11] judgment seat of kades barer will they
[1:12:13] take the land they said no we cannot
[1:12:15] take the land but they're all part of
[1:12:17] the church you got to think about you
[1:12:19] know you got to go
[1:12:20] beyond you got to go beyond you know I
[1:12:23] just love everyone we must if God is in
[1:12:26] here and you come under the anointing of
[1:12:28] the Holy Ghost you will love one another
[1:12:31] amen but it has to be it has to be it's
[1:12:35] more than that amen amen if the spirit
[1:12:38] in you if the spirit that wrote the
[1:12:40] Bibles in you
[1:12:42] yeah you have the fruit of the spirit
[1:12:45] you have the character of Christ you
[1:12:48] will love one another you will cry out
[1:12:50] for the Abominations done in the world
[1:12:52] and and and cry you know have a burden
[1:12:54] for lost souls you will do all those
[1:12:56] things but
[1:12:58] ultimately you got to have all of that
[1:13:01] if the life is in you it'll Express that
[1:13:04] and then you cannot deny in here cannot
[1:13:06] deny this because the Same Spirit wrote
[1:13:08] this word amen amen but some legalistic
[1:13:11] people say well you got to cope up the
[1:13:12] word but there's no evidence of the life
[1:13:15] I'm not taking one you got to take the
[1:13:16] whole thing amen amen right
[1:13:20] amen see and you say well I can't I
[1:13:23] can't I can't there's things in here I
[1:13:26] can't do yet open the door amen just let
[1:13:28] them come and do amen that's all you
[1:13:31] need to do God help First
[1:13:34] Corinthians
[1:13:36] 13 He says verse one now look at Paul
[1:13:40] here this
[1:13:43] incredible I speak with the tongues of
[1:13:46] men and of angels and have not charity
[1:13:48] remember Divine love and I become as a
[1:13:51] sounding brass or a tinkling symbol
[1:13:54] and though I have the gift of Prophecy
[1:13:55] and understand all Mysteries and all
[1:13:57] knowledge and though I have all Faith so
[1:14:00] that I could remove mountains and have
[1:14:01] not charity I am nothing so he's
[1:14:05] actually saying because some people say
[1:14:07] remember you got to take the whole thing
[1:14:09] some people say when the spirit of Truth
[1:14:10] has come you Alle you and guide you into
[1:14:11] all truth absolutely so some people
[1:14:14] validate their experience with God by
[1:14:16] saying I understand the
[1:14:17] word I'll show you what it means he says
[1:14:21] here without divine without the life of
[1:14:24] God in you you can understand all
[1:14:26] Mysteries y can you can hey you can just
[1:14:29] go on the internet go Lonnie Jenkin some
[1:14:31] other Bible teacher you know and you can
[1:14:33] learn their Revelation that's right and
[1:14:36] it's only learned Revelation doesn't
[1:14:37] produce any life right yeah and you can
[1:14:40] listen to the message and because people
[1:14:42] have given their lives to put it all
[1:14:44] together right amen so you can just
[1:14:46] learn what they have some of them
[1:14:48] mentally just learned it but others have
[1:14:50] it's been a revelation to their soul and
[1:14:52] their life has shown on it and so you
[1:14:54] can just learn what they've put together
[1:14:55] and say I
[1:14:57] understand amen and it becomes it just
[1:14:59] becomes another Bible school if you just
[1:15:01] learn it so he says that I know all
[1:15:04] Mysteries and in the days of the voice
[1:15:06] of the seventh angel all Mysteries
[1:15:07] should be finished y amen and we must
[1:15:10] also remember before we continue reading
[1:15:12] the word of the lord always comes as I
[1:15:14] said you got to be willing to be yoked
[1:15:15] up with the word amen you and the word
[1:15:18] have got to become one when you ask the
[1:15:20] question whose interpretation of the
[1:15:22] Bible should I yolked with the Catholic
[1:15:25] the charismatic the Pentecostal just a
[1:15:27] whole take all of them and bring them
[1:15:28] together no the word of the lord always
[1:15:31] comes to the prophet I'll do nothing
[1:15:33] until I reveal it to my servants the
[1:15:35] prophets Amos 3:7 amen so a prophet a
[1:15:38] Vindicated prophet's word becomes the
[1:15:41] interpretation of this amen that's right
[1:15:44] is that and so we have to so whatever
[1:15:47] that Prophet says this word is then you
[1:15:50] have to subject yourself to his
[1:15:51] interpretation amen oh that's just
[1:15:53] blindly following a man no it's not it's
[1:15:56] God's system all the way through Moses
[1:15:57] had the interpretation cor and Dayan
[1:15:59] raised up said you think you're the only
[1:16:01] holy man in Israel we're all holy amen
[1:16:04] we all can hear from God and and God
[1:16:06] said to Moses separate yourself and the
[1:16:09] Earth swallowed them
[1:16:10] up amen but Joshua and Caleb recognized
[1:16:13] that the words came out of that man's
[1:16:15] mouth that was God speaking to them amen
[1:16:17] and they subjected themselves to the
[1:16:19] Revelation that came out of his mouth
[1:16:21] and they took the land amen and Paul
[1:16:23] said to the Corinthian Church them that
[1:16:25] are spiritual among you let them
[1:16:27] recognize that Comm the Commandments I
[1:16:29] teach you are the Commandments of the
[1:16:31] Lord amen amen so the spiritual on had
[1:16:34] to recognize this is not Paul's idea
[1:16:36] this is this is God's idea and he's the
[1:16:38] one who placed law and Grace and wrote
[1:16:40] most of the New Testament and and the
[1:16:42] true church in that day and in this day
[1:16:45] must yield themselves to his
[1:16:46] interpretation of the word yes sir and
[1:16:48] brother Brandon because he's a true
[1:16:50] prophet of God preached the same thing
[1:16:51] Paul preached amen so you got to be you
[1:16:55] say well he's from Kentucky he says all
[1:16:57] these different things you got to
[1:16:58] recognize it's not him saying these
[1:17:00] things he says many times he says no if
[1:17:02] I've said that I can't I'd be very bold
[1:17:05] to make this challenge he says no if I a
[1:17:08] true servant of God and I've told the
[1:17:10] truth let him he says he's obligated in
[1:17:12] one place God is obligated to come and
[1:17:14] back up what I've said and then the
[1:17:17] pillar of fire comes down into the place
[1:17:19] hearts of the people have discerned all
[1:17:21] these different things God comes down
[1:17:22] confir his word over and over again amen
[1:17:25] that's a bold statement and he said it
[1:17:27] more than once in front of thousands of
[1:17:28] people if I be the true servant of God
[1:17:31] let him come and vindicate what I've
[1:17:32] just said and God Vindicated God is
[1:17:34] actually saying this is me speaking this
[1:17:36] is me speaking this is not him speaking
[1:17:38] this is me speaking so the you say all
[1:17:41] of is stuttering and all these different
[1:17:43] things no it's the Revelation
[1:17:45] contained in in the message is perfect
[1:17:48] yes amen amen it's the Revelation
[1:17:50] contained so if you have that revelation
[1:17:53] this is not him speaking it's not some
[1:17:54] new doctrine being cooked up but it's
[1:17:56] the words being open and the word comes
[1:17:59] to the prophet to reveal it to us
[1:18:00] hallelujah so then you got to say I have
[1:18:02] to yield myself whatever he says amen
[1:18:05] I'm got to yield myself to what he says
[1:18:07] y amen amen that's
[1:18:10] right they had to do it in Paul's agej
[1:18:13] they have to do it you know you had all
[1:18:14] the way through the word of the lord
[1:18:16] always comes to the
[1:18:18] prophet
[1:18:20] amen so now is that okay that's just
[1:18:25] because otherwise otherwise we're just
[1:18:27] another denomination and we have a
[1:18:29] council of opinion and academic idea and
[1:18:31] thought that's not God's program that's
[1:18:34] never been God's program and it never
[1:18:36] will be God's program especially not in
[1:18:38] this day amen amen oh what about Martin
[1:18:41] Luther and all these things they were
[1:18:43] anointed to open the word to people it
[1:18:45] was still God's Channel but then what
[1:18:47] happened Luther died they they made an
[1:18:49] organization then they make Bible
[1:18:51] schools and they just go down the the
[1:18:53] same rut that the you know the
[1:18:55] generations before them did and and you
[1:18:57] hear Brother BR he says the Pentecostals
[1:19:00] in his day he said if the first genuine
[1:19:02] ones rose up from the grave and saw that
[1:19:05] the very thing that they came out of
[1:19:08] their children and the generations after
[1:19:10] have gone back to that vomit as a dog
[1:19:13] you know turns to his vomit and a hog to
[1:19:14] its wall he says you've done exactly the
[1:19:16] same thing what they do make Bible
[1:19:18] schools and it becomes an intellectual
[1:19:20] understanding of man that is not there's
[1:19:23] no Vindication in that what has God
[1:19:27] backed up that's right because whatever
[1:19:28] God backs up you should listen to amen
[1:19:31] and this message has been over
[1:19:32] Vindicated hallelujah it's been over
[1:19:34] again and again and again amen you can
[1:19:36] hear it on
[1:19:38] tape
[1:19:39] amen Now 1 Corinthians 13 sorry we go
[1:19:42] back
[1:19:43] there he says and though I bestow all my
[1:19:47] goods to feed the poor this is verse
[1:19:51] three and though I give my body to be
[1:19:54] burned and have not charity it profiteth
[1:19:58] me nothing so he's saying even though I
[1:20:01] do all all these religious acts and I
[1:20:04] help help my you know help feed the poor
[1:20:07] give my body as a you know I'm going to
[1:20:09] be a m for Christ you got to be careful
[1:20:12] do you have that charity or is it just
[1:20:15] some religious spirit driving
[1:20:17] you because if if you don't have that
[1:20:19] Divine love it profits me
[1:20:21] nothing now this is the attributes of
[1:20:24] this charity suffereth long and is kind
[1:20:30] charity envieth not charity vaunteth not
[1:20:33] itself is not puffed up that vth means
[1:20:35] the boast to be a bragger look at me in
[1:20:38] my religion look how great I am right
[1:20:42] amen does not behave itself unseemly
[1:20:45] seeketh not her own is not easily
[1:20:47] provoked thinketh no evil rejoiceth not
[1:20:50] in iniquity but re Joes in the truth
[1:20:54] beareth all things believeth all things
[1:20:56] hopeth all things endureth all things if
[1:21:00] you've opened every door this is you
[1:21:02] amen if you've opened every door he
[1:21:03] comes in this is you now sure we fall
[1:21:06] and fail all these different things but
[1:21:08] there should be something in you amen
[1:21:11] you
[1:21:12] know I used to watch a lot of movies
[1:21:14] listen to what you know a lot of music
[1:21:16] watch a lot of
[1:21:18] TV r18 all that stuff before I met the
[1:21:22] Lord I enjoyed
[1:21:24] it yep I'll just say amen for me I did
[1:21:28] I'll be honest but then after I met God
[1:21:31] there was something came in here said
[1:21:32] that is disgusting amen and I want to
[1:21:34] have nothing to do with that and it
[1:21:37] wasn't IL legalistic thou shall not thou
[1:21:39] sh there's just something in you you
[1:21:40] know when you grow up who likes broccoli
[1:21:43] who I mean who doesn't like
[1:21:45] broccoli I do like broccoli but I'm just
[1:21:48] raising my hand okay now you think
[1:21:51] there's something in you that doesn't
[1:21:52] like the broccoli
[1:21:54] yeah it's
[1:21:57] green amen so you think there's
[1:22:00] something in you that doesn't like the
[1:22:01] broccoli I don't I remember and my
[1:22:03] daughters do the same thing when I was
[1:22:04] young I never tried the thing I said I
[1:22:06] don't like it I don't like it I remember
[1:22:08] doing that being young and they do the
[1:22:10] same thing never even tried it it's the
[1:22:13] same thing now if there's something in
[1:22:15] here that like broccoli I need broccoli
[1:22:17] and I do like broccoli there's something
[1:22:18] in here that likes broccoli amen but if
[1:22:21] there's something in here that says I
[1:22:22] can not stomach
[1:22:23] that amen I won't eat it you take that
[1:22:27] from food you take that into everything
[1:22:30] you take it you know you take it into
[1:22:31] the you know just like why don't it's
[1:22:34] not see I don't have TV not because Thou
[1:22:37] shalt not watch
[1:22:39] TV
[1:22:40] I in here is repulsed by what I see even
[1:22:46] between documentaries there's all kinds
[1:22:47] of stuff they just throw in there I mean
[1:22:51] you see you know you you see Disney
[1:22:53] Channel there's there's there's Mickey
[1:22:54] Mouse and all these different things and
[1:22:56] then in between time there's rock and
[1:22:57] roll and dancing and all this stuff to
[1:22:59] catch the children right
[1:23:01] amen so what if there's something I'm if
[1:23:06] there's something that's in here that
[1:23:07] says I don't like that and I'm a
[1:23:09] prisoner I'll say yes Lord amen that's
[1:23:11] right amen even if the flesh likes it
[1:23:14] that's why entertainment's so big cuz
[1:23:15] the flesh likes it and we're still in
[1:23:17] this flesh but if there's something in
[1:23:19] here that that this has been taken
[1:23:21] captive yeah and something in there says
[1:23:23] I don't want that anymore I say I don't
[1:23:25] want that anymore there's nothing in me
[1:23:26] that wants it I know I've shared the
[1:23:28] testimon many times about drinking but
[1:23:30] after the Lord after I opened every door
[1:23:32] and he took it out of
[1:23:34] me there was nothing in me that said
[1:23:36] there was nothing in me that wanted it
[1:23:37] anymore I didn't have to go oh no you
[1:23:41] know there's nothing in me that wanted
[1:23:44] it really amen but if I hadn't opened
[1:23:47] every door and the thing is when it
[1:23:50] comes to opening doors now the reason
[1:23:53] that people do not is they begin to
[1:23:54] reason yeah and people's reasoning
[1:23:57] always boils down to I'm not as bad as
[1:23:59] someone else amen this is how reasoning
[1:24:02] because to reason you have to have
[1:24:04] something to compare with yeah y That's
[1:24:08] why you know you look at where do we go
[1:24:09] on holiday then you begin to reason well
[1:24:12] I like this place cuz it cuz this other
[1:24:13] place doesn't have this so you go here
[1:24:15] you reason and then people don't open
[1:24:18] every doors because they reason I'm not
[1:24:20] like this person or I'm not like that
[1:24:21] person
[1:24:23] now I'm going to come to that in a
[1:24:25] little bit let's just go to actually
[1:24:27] let's go to that then we'll drop down to
[1:24:29] to something else now let's go to Second
[1:24:34] Corinthians no actually sorry before we
[1:24:37] go there let's go to Matthew chapter
[1:24:44] 7 mother
[1:24:46] just this is how it came to me so this
[1:24:48] is how it's coming out so Matthew chap
[1:24:50] 7:21 people always reason this
[1:24:53] I'm in the message they're still
[1:24:55] reasoning amen I'm the bride there's
[1:24:57] still reasoning amen so you got to and
[1:25:00] the word says what to cast down
[1:25:02] reasoning am because if you reason you
[1:25:05] say I don't need to change amen if the
[1:25:08] Lord saying hey the word says I say this
[1:25:11] because it's not you know when God
[1:25:13] speaks he doesn't say the word he says
[1:25:14] I'm saying this I want to I want to lift
[1:25:17] you higher than what you have am me I
[1:25:19] want to take full control I want you to
[1:25:20] be my love prisoner right that's it but
[1:25:23] then there comes a people Matthew chap 7
[1:25:26] and we're 21 down to verse
[1:25:29] 23 so this is Jesus speaking he says not
[1:25:33] everyone that saith unto me Lord Lord
[1:25:36] shall enter into the kingdom of heaven
[1:25:39] but he that doeth the will of My Father
[1:25:42] which is in heaven what is his will for
[1:25:45] you Lord open every door I want to open
[1:25:47] every door to you take full control of
[1:25:49] me amen amen amen that is and and if if
[1:25:52] you do that then you will be doing the
[1:25:53] father's will because you're not doing
[1:25:55] your own will there cannot be two Powers
[1:25:57] ruling at the same time it can't be your
[1:25:59] carnal nature and God ruling you one has
[1:26:03] to die for the other one to come amen
[1:26:06] amen many will say to me in that day
[1:26:08] Lord Lord have we not prophesied in thy
[1:26:11] name and in thy name have cast out
[1:26:13] devils and in thy name done many MTI I
[1:26:15] mean many wonderful works and then will
[1:26:18] I profess unto them I never knew you
[1:26:21] depart from me ye that work
[1:26:24] iniquity now often we take the scripture
[1:26:27] and we say well that's denomination
[1:26:29] that's false anointed ones but it has to
[1:26:31] apply to
[1:26:32] everyone and so there'll be people now
[1:26:35] and this is just like the Rich Young
[1:26:36] Ruler he begin to reason he said Lord
[1:26:40] what must I do he said good Master what
[1:26:42] must I do to have eternal life and and
[1:26:44] Jesus said you know the Commandments you
[1:26:46] know honor thy father and mother do all
[1:26:48] these things and he says I've kept these
[1:26:50] from my youth and Jesus Jesus if he was
[1:26:53] lying Jesus said you're a liar you're a
[1:26:54] hypocrite amen but Jesus didn't dispute
[1:26:58] that he actually acknowledged by not
[1:26:59] saying anything that he was telling the
[1:27:01] truth amen he was a good I'd say
[1:27:04] Christian believer he was a good message
[1:27:06] believer amen cuz he kept the word of
[1:27:08] Moses but he said this is the one thing
[1:27:11] you lack sell all you have give to the
[1:27:13] poor take up your cross and follow me
[1:27:15] now it says in one place he ranted Jesus
[1:27:18] so he actually planned the whole thing
[1:27:20] now when he comes this way then I'll be
[1:27:21] a to intercept that I'll get my chance
[1:27:23] cuz there's always people around him so
[1:27:25] so he he planned this meeting but then
[1:27:28] when Jesus began to talk to him like
[1:27:29] this what happened he be to reason
[1:27:32] because if he didn't reason he would
[1:27:33] have said of course and he would have
[1:27:34] sold all he would have taken up his
[1:27:36] cross and followed him but he began to
[1:27:38] reason he said but I can do good with
[1:27:41] what I have I can help people more if I
[1:27:44] just keep my business keep my riches you
[1:27:46] know and he begin to
[1:27:48] reason and the reason he was he he he
[1:27:51] walked away said he wasn't willing to do
[1:27:53] it is because he wasn't willing to open
[1:27:54] his heart every part of his life he had
[1:27:58] opened it a little bit cuz he was a
[1:28:00] Believer amen but when it came to his
[1:28:02] personal life his pride of what will
[1:28:05] people think of me when I give all to
[1:28:06] the poor what will my parents think of
[1:28:08] me or my you know you know my friends so
[1:28:11] he wasn't willing to open that
[1:28:13] door now to do iniquity
[1:28:16] iniquity is in the Greek it's a
[1:28:18] violation of
[1:28:20] law so so it's a or or it's to trans or
[1:28:26] it's a transgression of the law now in
[1:28:29] order to so so this is in my language to
[1:28:32] work iniquity is to know something but
[1:28:35] don't do it amen I'm just going to bring
[1:28:38] I'm I'm bring this right on home amen so
[1:28:42] if someone is a worker of
[1:28:43] iniquity Jesus comes
[1:28:46] along and he says I want all of
[1:28:49] you but then if that person begins to
[1:28:51] reason
[1:28:52] and say well I don't need to change a
[1:28:54] part of my life even though he puts his
[1:28:56] finger on it that is actually a worker
[1:28:59] of
[1:29:00] iniquity if you're not willing to give
[1:29:02] all of you amen then that is because
[1:29:06] it's the because you must open every
[1:29:09] part of your life and then he can take
[1:29:11] you as a prisoner but then if you're not
[1:29:13] willing to do that remember it's to to
[1:29:17] to know something but not to do
[1:29:19] it amen and the only way that we can
[1:29:22] really be prisoners of Christ is to give
[1:29:24] all every part of our
[1:29:26] life amen so so actually to hold part of
[1:29:29] yourself back is actually working in
[1:29:33] equity because these people because no
[1:29:35] doubt these people you you know brother
[1:29:37] Bram he you know he tell stories like
[1:29:39] people they you know God God gets a hold
[1:29:41] of them and then they you know maybe go
[1:29:43] to a church and maybe they start
[1:29:44] preaching but then they come across like
[1:29:46] the truth of the
[1:29:48] baptism but then they begin to reason
[1:29:50] and say well if I begin to teach that
[1:29:52] then they'll kick me out what is that to
[1:29:55] know something but not to do it that's a
[1:29:57] worker of iniquity and you see these
[1:29:59] people have reasoned because no doubt
[1:30:01] when the truth came their way they said
[1:30:04] but God is blessing us we see the sick
[1:30:06] being healed you know we've seen
[1:30:08] prophecy come true we've seen all these
[1:30:10] different things they said Lord Lord
[1:30:12] have we not prophesied in their name
[1:30:14] cast out Devils done many wonderful
[1:30:17] works and he didn't say no you're
[1:30:19] telling a lie he just says the from me
[1:30:22] you that work iniquity I never knew you
[1:30:24] so he didn't say they actually making it
[1:30:26] up that was genuine Miracles done the
[1:30:29] devil was genuinely cast out people
[1:30:30] genuinely healed prophecy genuine
[1:30:32] prophecy happened amen but so they begin
[1:30:36] to reason but God's blessed me I see the
[1:30:39] hand of God in my life amen I see him
[1:30:42] come on the scene when I pray but he
[1:30:43] answers my prayer amen
[1:30:46] amen so they begin to reason and then
[1:30:49] they ended up in this state
[1:30:53] amen and Paul says do not shun to
[1:30:55] declare I have not shun to declare the
[1:30:57] whole counsel of God so I cannot shun to
[1:31:00] tell you these things amen amen that you
[1:31:02] don't want to begin to reason and say
[1:31:04] well I understand the word now I have a
[1:31:06] closer walk with God now and I've got a
[1:31:08] better family now and everything's going
[1:31:10] better now don't begin to reason when
[1:31:13] he's calling you higher the reason he
[1:31:14] wants to you to open the door of every
[1:31:16] part of your life is because he wants to
[1:31:17] lift you higher than what you have am
[1:31:20] amen but then the problem is
[1:31:23] now uh let's go to 2 Corinthians chapter
[1:31:26] 10 I just want to read this let's just
[1:31:27] read the scripture
[1:31:30] together see they reason they reason
[1:31:33] with them you know that's why they ended
[1:31:36] up in that state and I I said before
[1:31:38] reasoning always it boils down to
[1:31:41] comparison
[1:31:43] yes yes and we see this now in 2
[1:31:47] Corinthians 10 and and and and verse
[1:31:49] 12 oh I mean 1 Corinthians in
[1:31:52] sorry made that mistake last
[1:31:55] night he says this
[1:31:59] here first Corinthians I'm sorry sorry 2
[1:32:02] Corinthians um chapter 10 and
[1:32:07] verse2 now is everyone there yeah he
[1:32:11] says for we dare not make ourselves of
[1:32:15] the number or compare ourselves with
[1:32:18] some that commend themselves but they
[1:32:21] measuring themselves by themselves and
[1:32:24] comparing themselves among themselves
[1:32:26] are not wise amen amen so if you compare
[1:32:30] yourself so for example if I compare
[1:32:32] myself with someone
[1:32:33] else I'm not wise amen amen well I'm a
[1:32:38] better believer than this brother I'm a
[1:32:40] better believer than you know my family
[1:32:41] is in better order than this family
[1:32:43] right you become you're not wise that's
[1:32:46] right Paul says You must never compare
[1:32:47] yourself with yourself amen or commend
[1:32:51] them or or compare ourselves with some
[1:32:54] that commend themselves how do you
[1:32:56] commend yourself I'm the
[1:32:58] best look what God's shown me I had such
[1:33:01] a great time the other day amen amen
[1:33:04] that is commending
[1:33:06] yourself Jesus said pray in secret that
[1:33:09] you'll be rewarded openly don't be like
[1:33:12] the Hypocrites that pray on the street
[1:33:13] corners amen many things I think you
[1:33:18] know people who really pray in secret
[1:33:20] and then they just see God's hand
[1:33:22] in in different
[1:33:24] situations they say praise God Amen and
[1:33:27] that's what Jesus said pray in secret
[1:33:28] and then you'll see it openly what
[1:33:30] happened and then he gets the glory not
[1:33:32] you yes because remember the problem you
[1:33:36] know this is why the prophet had to be
[1:33:37] Tak it off the scene 50 odd years you
[1:33:39] know you 50 years ago just say if he was
[1:33:41] still alive
[1:33:42] today and he was still preaching no
[1:33:45] doubt we all would make like it be like
[1:33:47] a pilgrimage to Jeffersonville or
[1:33:49] wherever he would be it's oh brother BR
[1:33:50] you would be so caught up in the man but
[1:33:53] Jesus never wanted us to be caught up
[1:33:55] with any man he was just the one to
[1:33:57] induce us to Christ and then we become
[1:33:59] one with Jesus Christ the word amen amen
[1:34:02] so we're not caught up in in in the man
[1:34:04] but it's the message that he brought
[1:34:06] which is Christ amen so he had to be
[1:34:08] taken off the scene that people stop
[1:34:10] raising up men to follow yeah amen right
[1:34:15] because then you begin to you know and
[1:34:17] then that's how things can happen as if
[1:34:19] we put now we should put confidence in
[1:34:21] one another and when you say brother
[1:34:23] sister pray for this you're not
[1:34:24] approaching the person you're
[1:34:25] approaching the god in the person amen
[1:34:27] and we should absolutely do that yeah
[1:34:29] you understand but then if we lift up
[1:34:32] someone out of their wrong position and
[1:34:35] say I'll just get brother son sister s
[1:34:37] to pray for this it'll all be over no
[1:34:41] you've you've actually lifted them
[1:34:44] up you understand sure there's a there's
[1:34:46] a there's a right way of do you know you
[1:34:48] know there's Ministry and different
[1:34:50] things that you know you should say pray
[1:34:51] me you but if you liftt people you if we
[1:34:54] gather around personality I'll put it
[1:34:55] this way if we gather around a
[1:34:58] personality you know of any believer
[1:35:00] that's wrong yes because we begin to
[1:35:03] compare ourselves with them that commend
[1:35:05] themselves how do they get in that
[1:35:07] position to begin with they begin to
[1:35:08] commend themselves and charity does not
[1:35:10] boast
[1:35:11] itself
[1:35:14] amen so if we compare ourselves with
[1:35:16] ourselves we're not
[1:35:18] wise amen that's right and the you
[1:35:21] Proverbs chapter 4 it says the principal
[1:35:24] thing wisdom is the principal thing
[1:35:27] therefore get wisdom and with all thy
[1:35:28] get and get understanding so so if we
[1:35:31] compare ourselves well our church is
[1:35:33] better than this church or our church I
[1:35:34] wish it was like that church or you know
[1:35:36] or I wish our music was like that music
[1:35:38] I wish our preaching was like that
[1:35:39] preacher or you know we're comparing
[1:35:41] ourselves with ourselves and we become I
[1:35:44] just say foolish amen
[1:35:47] amen we should never this is the mirror
[1:35:52] amen if I had a message book it's to me
[1:35:54] the same thing it's it's revealing
[1:35:55] Christ in here amen that is the mirror
[1:35:58] but if we compare ourselves with this
[1:36:01] then we become wise amen amen and then
[1:36:05] it says even in the scripture I don't
[1:36:06] have it actually I have the link I made
[1:36:08] some
[1:36:11] um I have uh no okay okay so to compare
[1:36:14] in the Greek it means to measure and
[1:36:16] compare which is you must study what
[1:36:19] you're
[1:36:20] comparing uh to to actually weigh it up
[1:36:23] so to compare you actually have to study
[1:36:24] you have to observe
[1:36:26] it but in second
[1:36:28] Corinthians 3
[1:36:32] and8 he says but we all with open face
[1:36:35] beholding as in a glass the glory of the
[1:36:37] Lord had changed into the same image
[1:36:39] from glory to glory even as by the
[1:36:42] spirit of the Lord so if you are
[1:36:43] comparing yourself with him amen if
[1:36:47] you're comparing yourself with him we
[1:36:49] actually changed from glory to glory and
[1:36:51] this word change in the Greek is
[1:36:53] actually where we get the word
[1:36:54] metamorphosis from you're actually
[1:36:56] transformed amen amen but if you compare
[1:36:59] yourself with some brother or sister you
[1:37:01] are not going to be transformed amen you
[1:37:03] just having your heart well and then if
[1:37:05] you go down that road you end up like
[1:37:08] the I believe it was the um Pharisee and
[1:37:12] the Publican that went into the temple
[1:37:14] and the and the Pharisee prayed he stood
[1:37:16] and prayed and he said uh you know you
[1:37:19] know he prayed within himself down as
[1:37:21] the man thinketh in his heart I thank
[1:37:23] thee that I'm not as other men are
[1:37:25] exalters unjust adulterers even as this
[1:37:27] Publican I fast twice in a week I give
[1:37:30] tithes to all that I possess so this is
[1:37:33] remember he's he this man is actually
[1:37:35] foolish he's not wise because he's
[1:37:37] comparing himself with everyone else
[1:37:39] around him I thank you Lord I'm not like
[1:37:42] this guy and this is this is where this
[1:37:45] is where this leached if you compare
[1:37:47] yourself with yourself yeah that's right
[1:37:49] amen a proud arrogant Pharisee
[1:37:52] and look at the works I do I thank thee
[1:37:54] Lord I'm not like this other person in
[1:37:56] church I listen to three messages a week
[1:37:59] I take notes amen I come to every
[1:38:01] meeting amen I thank you I'm not like
[1:38:04] this
[1:38:06] guy I'll just put it into today's
[1:38:08] language all those things what he did
[1:38:10] all you know he says you know I fast
[1:38:13] twice in a week I give tithes of all
[1:38:15] that I possess all those things are
[1:38:17] fine amen all those things are good but
[1:38:20] what he had turned it into he was
[1:38:21] reasoning now I do these things I'm a
[1:38:23] better religious person than this guy
[1:38:25] I'm a better believer than this guy then
[1:38:27] the Publican comes in and he and he was
[1:38:30] a standing a far off he could not even
[1:38:32] lift as much of his eyes into heaven but
[1:38:34] smed his breath saying God be merciful
[1:38:35] to me a sinner wait he's opened the door
[1:38:38] amen I tell you this man went down to
[1:38:41] his house Justified rather than the
[1:38:43] other for everyone that exalteth himself
[1:38:46] shall be abased and he that humbleth
[1:38:48] himself shall be
[1:38:50] exalted
[1:38:52] amen so we're not to compare ourselves
[1:38:54] with ourselves but if you do that then
[1:38:57] you won't open every door amen but if
[1:39:00] you say
[1:39:01] Lord I'm the one you know deal with me
[1:39:06] come into every part of my life just
[1:39:08] like this Publican guy said he didn't
[1:39:10] compare himself with anything he he just
[1:39:12] knew he was
[1:39:13] wrong amen he didn't justify any of his
[1:39:16] actions now what about
[1:39:19] us amen I'm going to yeah yeah I'm going
[1:39:22] to wind this
[1:39:24] up but you can't whatever you do don't
[1:39:27] reason amen God is only going to take
[1:39:31] prisoners in a Rapture y you say well
[1:39:33] I'm
[1:39:34] predestinated he is waiting for
[1:39:37] you amen we know God is
[1:39:40] Sovereign and his will is supreme but
[1:39:43] he's a gentleman yes you know brother
[1:39:46] Bram says I think it's an I know it
[1:39:48] not he um I don't have the quotes here
[1:39:52] but you go listen to that sermon in Noth
[1:39:54] 65 he just stands up he opens the Bible
[1:39:56] he's not expecting to preach and he
[1:39:58] reads Revelations 3 about th and know
[1:40:00] not Thou blind miserable naked poor
[1:40:02] Richard and then he he in there he
[1:40:05] speaks of a story of two people who live
[1:40:08] next to each other they're both woman
[1:40:10] they're both Christian
[1:40:12] one I think one is like Methodist and
[1:40:15] one is another one and then the one
[1:40:17] who's meant to be closer to God than the
[1:40:19] other one um
[1:40:21] she notices The Other Woman begins to
[1:40:23] commit adultery with someone else and
[1:40:25] and and and have a divorce and do all
[1:40:27] these different things and she says to
[1:40:28] her husband how terrible that that woman
[1:40:30] is I see what she's doing but she was in
[1:40:33] the wrong as well because she was
[1:40:35] miserable wretched blind and didn't even
[1:40:37] know it amen but what was happening she
[1:40:40] was comparing herself with someone else
[1:40:43] and she didn't even recognize that she
[1:40:44] was actually the one undone as
[1:40:46] well amen she was
[1:40:49] reasoning and he said I think it's in
[1:40:52] that sermon he said the Rapture has not
[1:40:56] gone because the bride is not
[1:40:58] ready amen and in and in my little mind
[1:41:02] I thought the Rapture has not gone
[1:41:05] because every door is not open in every
[1:41:07] heart of the
[1:41:08] Bride amen oh we're waiting for more to
[1:41:11] come in are we right yeah we got to get
[1:41:15] ready that's right we we we don't just
[1:41:17] need to get reports from Ethiopia and
[1:41:20] different places bringing people in we
[1:41:22] have to get ready amen cuz if what if
[1:41:24] they're ready and we're not ready now
[1:41:26] you're holding up the now we're holding
[1:41:28] up the program right amen but if we're
[1:41:30] ready I believe that'll hasten Paul
[1:41:33] Peter I believe it is about hastening
[1:41:35] the coming of the Lord amen amen amen he
[1:41:38] says the bride is not ready that's why
[1:41:40] and we know that was 50 years ago many
[1:41:41] of us were not even born not even
[1:41:43] Believers sure but you got to bring it
[1:41:45] down this is
[1:41:48] 2016 we're not going to be here much
[1:41:50] longer I've heard that for years we're
[1:41:53] not going to be here much longer that's
[1:41:55] right amen but the thing that because
[1:41:58] when the bride comes into her position
[1:42:01] how does she come into her position she
[1:42:02] opens every door amen Lord rearrange my
[1:42:05] life amen do what you need to do yes to
[1:42:08] get me ready that's how she that's how
[1:42:10] she gets into her
[1:42:12] position amen because of she if if and
[1:42:16] that's what he's looking for Amen
[1:42:19] brother was a to
[1:42:22] Christ and that was an example of what
[1:42:24] the rest of the Bride would be like at
[1:42:26] the end
[1:42:27] time
[1:42:29] amen so we have to never compare
[1:42:33] yourself with someone else and never
[1:42:35] reason say but I'm at least I'm not like
[1:42:37] the person on the street or in some dark
[1:42:39] denomination don't don't compare look at
[1:42:42] this look at this and say search me oh
[1:42:45] God Amen try me today take every door I
[1:42:49] want to take the hinges off God he
[1:42:52] amen you say well I've never done
[1:42:55] anything wrong the Rich Young Ruler did
[1:42:58] one thing wrong he turned down eternal
[1:43:01] life and he ended up in
[1:43:03] Hell amen because of his reasoning well
[1:43:07] I haven't done anything wrong I'm I'm a
[1:43:09] good boy and he was a good boy you know
[1:43:11] he hadn't done anything
[1:43:12] wrong but he didn't open that
[1:43:16] door amen
[1:43:19] amen and Friends

[1:43:37] he's got you you just got to recognize
[1:43:39] he's got you and he doesn't have you
[1:43:42] just to throw you off the cliff at the
[1:43:43] End Amen he's got you to lift you up to
[1:43:46] take you from this
[1:43:47] world Amen and that's the only way
[1:43:50] you'll get there
[1:43:51] you won't get there by your reasoning or
[1:43:53] by or by comparing yourself or thinking
[1:43:55] I know it all or I'm a good Christian
[1:43:57] the only way is he lift you up amen amen
[1:44:00] amen and when that lamb you know you
[1:44:03] take that lamb you can cut its tail off
[1:44:05] you can do you know but it's just kick

[1:44:09] that it can't it can't
