but Lord you've been longing Lord I just think often of Lord when you thought of us before the foundation of the world and Lord Jesus now time has come into manifestation and it's about nearly you know six odd thousand years or however long it's been Lord but you've been waiting for this moment for us to be expressed upon the Earth that you can reveal yourself to us and that you can walk with us and show us your love and show us your care and your compassion and reveal yourself to us but also to reveal to ourselves who we are Lord Jesus is as your Prophet taught us that you had to show Abraham what he was Lord God as a father of the faith as an overcomer is one that didn't walk by the five senses but just by walked by divine revelation Lord I believe we're made of that same material as the father Abraham dear God I pray you just continue to show us who we are in you we love you so much you want to commit the service into your hands just pray you'd have preeminence in every life I just pray dear God that we wouldn't be distracted in our minds we wouldn't allow our minds to wander Lord Jesus will be focused and locked in Lord Jesus Lord I believe like the woman that touched the Hem of your garment Lord when she saw you walking she got locked in she got focused I've got to touch His Garment I've got to be made well he can heal me Lord may we have that same kind of

tell you young people it's possible I'm not that old I'm not that old I'm young I'm in your category even if I can tell you my age you can be surprised so it's very possible that problem that's bothering you it bothers at me that same Spirit that's better than you my sister it both at me I know your pains I know your struggles but I wanna tell you there is the blood of the lamp Jesus Christ is too big the blood of the lamp is too fresh and is still falling if you can only submit yourself into the plan my sister if you can only submit yourself into the blood my brother you will be a different man altogether too you can stand up and testify that Jesus the same yesterday today and forever his Stone leaves even till today [Applause] praise the Lord Hallelujah I was grateful I was born in a message by the grace of God but I never knew God did you hear me right I was born in the message but never knew God never one day did I miss church but I never met ahead in my own experience with God until that time when I said oh God I am tired of this life I am tired of just following behind girls brother you know you become a slave whereby when you see a girl you just want to sniff it brother but God can redeem you redeem you my brother brother oh man I'm a true living testimony so I wanna show you young people it is possible for you to hold on on to this message live your holy life then be an overcomer tune hallelujah praise the Lord and even even the youths that are in the internet I'm speaking to you too the same Angel who's speaking here can visit you tonight Hallelujah it's very very possible it's very very possible Hallelujah our theme is you young gays young boys young people we do have maybe I'll stand as a representative of the youth tonight Pastor Ben and I will tell you what we're experiencing so that you can find solutions to that yeah praise the Lord because there's no one wants to stand for the Youth and tell out what's happening through their life we just we thank God for the Ministers of God they come they preach the seven Thunders that Divine revealed mystery truth hidden in the seven shoes praise God praise God but underneath there is a

something hard for me until when he came into my life until when I had an appointment with him oh Hallelujah I remember one day brother when we had gone somewhere out in the missionaries to preach the gospel in The Villages under a small heart not in a muddy roundhouse the Holy Ghost came in day I thought I was a child of God but the Holy Ghost came down spoke to my life Direct said I need to make this and that and this and that right I came out of the room right at that same time when I saw the minister who was there confess my life I came back again but I never finished everything brother you

that hard spirit will break tonight it's not by coincidence that you are here God knew it before the world became brother that is why that's why when I stand to preach brother I don't back off because I know God in his plan before the end of the world he wrote in his diary that on the 25th of October I want Alpha to be preaching so there's no spirit there is no devil that will defy me right now why because the whole host of Heaven is behind me is behind us and I'm not preaching my own ideas it is the Holy Ghost himself he will defend himself tonight [Applause] Hallelujah praise the Lord too many akans in the church too many ananias and sapphires they lied to the pasta they think they're lying to pass the ban unless you lie to the Holy Ghost but let me tell you brother one day is one day when you will enter in the doors of Shekinah that Tabernacle that you used to enter every day and you see the Holy Ghost having taken a corner yeah when you get there they'll tell you your husband is dead why because there's something that you like there's something that you're doing wrong praise the Lord I don't know why God chose me to preach this gospel I want to be loving everyone I love you Saints

something else when you're greet him brother you'll be just like or the tip with the tip of a finger but you say you want to spend eternity with that brother which eternity are you talking about

are exactly you want the world you want the church where are you make a choice make it brother I'd rather pick to two people I would rather preach to two people that are full of the Holy Ghost rather than preaching to a bunch of people full of the spirit of the devil Hallelujah oh man praise the Lord Brother you know your life the prophet says everyone should take stock of his own life every day in the morning Lord since when I woke up in the morning did was I saying the right things was I walking with the right friends did I did I do everything right every single day take stock of your life

around the streets they might have offended you I offered them Hallelujah but you don't have time with your kids you don't have time even of reading the Bible how can you overcome the politics of this world how can you overcome the internet of this world brother when it comes to reading the phone you are always 24 7. but when it comes to a Bible brother you read one verse then proof praise the Lord conversation anything that's not right reveal it now we will walk straight and do it the prophecy is in one of the spoken ways God doesn't doesn't take you responsible of you being a sinner but he takes you responsible of you remaining a sinner because he has made a way for you to move far away from being a sinner into a saint now the prophet is saying Lord reveal it to us once you show us we will do it we need to give sleepless nights to the pastor knocking at the pastors though Pastor I want the Lord to forgive me you thought I was a young man that was holy come I need to have a conference with you person you start started in your life as you see me here I've got three girlfriends hey you start making your life right from the ground brother receiving the Holy Ghost is not just easy as if you are sitting on a cup of coffee drinking or on a couch drinking cup of coffee there's a lot of cleaning that needs to be done that is why Peter said repent first thing one repent and be baptized in the name of Jesus but we just want to be baptized then we jump step number one we are baptized this try sinner then we come up as a wet sinner when you mean it brother when you really mean it brother you come to the pastor with tears on your cheek crying Pastor I've been living like a man you thought I was a young man but I'm already living with five womens already I know

consecration brother I don't mind to be to be to be made humble I will confess all my life I will send the devil away but I'll receive the Holy Ghost that I lose all the pride let I lose all the status that you give me but I lose everything but I save my soul hallelujah what does it tell me for me to be walking around as a as a nice brother but living like something else in the inside white outside but dead rot on inside oh man may the Lord help us to this little technical I believe the word that are on earth goes to this Tabernacle this is the prophet talking to you Saints now I never said all of the finest people do you get the prophet the prophet preached three kinds of believers on every Gathering there is three kinds of Believers you like it or not is just like that that is why sometimes the way it becomes so hard because it's too fetching for those three kinds of believers [Music] I say some of the finest people on Earth go to this Tabernacle but day by day entering from meeting to meeting I see a great need in the Tabernacle this is a prophet King now a grade in it that's for a Feeling for a consecration we need a consecration my brother you need to concentrate your life once again before the Lord that is why he's saying come let us reason together my child I know you have sinned brother he knows he knows that we have sinned he's saying come now I know it I know

Tabernacle a consecration a Deeper Life a closer walk with God that's our desire that's my desire to have that deeper walk with God a close walk with God brother you know what what takes away the move the presence of the Holy Ghost it sins the prophet the Bible says if an evil spirit if a spirit comes upon you the Holy Ghost is so timid once you do yes in the Holy Ghost moves away sit on a branch somewhere waiting for you to converse once you confess that thing from you it's an uncovered sin so what do we do we get rid of this unconferred sin then we have a closer walk with God we stay alive concentrate oh man a Deeper Life and the closer walk with God ah man I've promised them from uh to do this have a message for them hallelujah praise the Lord I'll just quickly read my course then we close Saints Hallelujah praise the Lord see these the time is already gone already praise the Lord now I see some of the Tabernacle folks here I'm saying to this this is a prophet preaching in the message why Christ speak Hallelujah I see some of the Tabernacle folks here I'm going to say this about the big sister he's talking about Jeffersonville Hallelujah one thing that the Tabernacle needs up there at our church is a rededication every feeling of the Holy Ghost that's what you need bro yes you might say you've been filled with the Holy Ghost but you need every dedication of the Holy Spirit a refill of the Holy Spirit brother we are in a journey brother as we travel brother we we meet Heights Hallelujah is you're driving a car brother as you drive a car you fueled it but sometimes you see it going empty why because you are in a journey it's your only Journey you're using that you with the fuel you're using the fuel when it goes down you go back by the pump refill it again we are traveling on a journey brother's sister this Christian walk is not easy sometimes you get tough moments nobody said when you get the Holy Ghost everything will be easy no but as soon as you get the Holy Spirit you have started a battle with the Devil all the armies of the devil are now against you so we fighting brother sometimes when you just come from home you when you come from work you're enjoying everything you're just singing songs of Zion where as soon as you get home brother the wife is saying this the kids are going that's why then you wonder what's happening you wonder

this what have I done nothing what what you just need to recognize we're not fighting a human being it's a spiritual war it's a spiritual world that we're fighting Hallelujah a refilling of the Holy Spirit write everyone to get down to the altar everyone young and old nice beautiful whatever everyone to get down at the altar pray until they get a renewing of the Holy Ghost not a two-minute prayer brother sister on this situation a two-minute prayer will not help you it needs a prayer like Jacob brother sister the prophet saying Jacob didn't pray for 15 minutes he didn't pray for five minutes he prayed all night he prayed all night holding to an angel hold it to an angel you say Lord the angel of God you know my name is called Jacob I'm a deceiver change my life for God this is what we need to do tonight everyone to come down at the altar pray until they get a change of life Hallelujah praise the Lord renewing of the Holy Ghost the whole church be filled with the power of God not some of the church the whole church that's what we need not only the Tabernacle there but the body of Christ Universal Hallelujah meaning you and me we need to do that Hallelujah it needs a refill I like a referral Hallelujah I need a refill of the Holy Ghost praise the Lord I need a refill of the Holy Ghost Lord you might deny me the monies of this world I don't care you might deny me the cause of this world I don't care but Lord don't deny me the Holy Ghost I will do everything possible for me to get the Holy Ghost for God if I need to repent of everything I'll do it father oh Hallelujah

baptized with the whole with baptized with water and he shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost and for sure my brother I tell you once you repent you repent your life being baptized with the Holy Ghost brother when we come we lay hands on you you surely gonna get the Holy Ghost some they don't need even the lying of the hands brother just say Lord now I'm in a church environment I don't have the time to go and see my brother but Lord as soon as I get out of my this room Lord I'll go and see my brother I'll go and see my precious sister and say sister forgive me I was having an evil thing against you I was having an evil mind against you just forgive me just forgive me my brother I just thought something bad against you Hallelujah praise the Lord oh man faith I don't want to take much of the time but praise the Lord just want to see where we can cut off from here praise the Lord some few calls to read I think any man or woman that's the prophet reading from the spoken radar by Christ speak again I think any man with a woman boy or girl I think in an intellectual conception of what they think uh the word is and so forth never can have a full Foundation stand until they have met the light that brings the world to reality praise the Lord I think no church in this practice no matter how intellectual fundamental it might be that church cannot thrive until the Supernatural is made known brother sister the prophet is saying no matter if you do everything right put on your long hair put along your long dresses do everything right but without that supernatural being no man known to you you cannot make it that's why we need the Holy Ghost in our lives that's why we need the power of God that's why we need our own Pentecostal experiences with God Hallelujah I need a Pentecostal experience tonight I need a visitation tonight I need God to visit me tonight I'm calling on the Lord to touch me tonight say Lord help me my unbelief o God I'm not worthy father your word is spoken to me Lord I've seen where I'm going wrong I've seen what I've been doing wrong yes people they might respect me father but I don't want to leave this horrible life anymore I'm dropping everything further only so that I can receive the power of the Holy Ghost the blood is still there my problem the blood is so flowing the blood is still flowing for you my brother he is ready to forgive you he is ready to forgive you my sister no matter what you have done no matter you have met the people he still loves you he still welcomes you his hands are wide open he's saying come back my child come back my son I love you I died for you on the cross that's why I went and died for you on the cross that's why I sing I sing a song I could not pay brother you couldn't pay it bro you couldn't pay brother but God and brother sister to be a sinner so that you can be a saint he decided to leave his throne to put all this human nature he decided to leave me strong so that he can go die for you my brother don't lose his Mercy my problem I beg you tonight don't lose his grace tonight he's saying my child I'm ready to give you all I'm ready to forgive you tonight praise the Lord praise the Lord I just want to try and paraphrase then we close so everything is already right now praise the Lord I feel the presence of the Lord is already touching people God is there my brother just open up your heart the Holy Ghost is here right now say Lord I need the Holy Ghost these meetings were made for me to receive the Holy Ghost these meetings were made for me to have that life change amen praise the Lord there's a story The Blood Brother talks about when you went into a restaurant I don't know if I'll be able to read it I don't know we'll see what the Lord leads I'll just try and paraphrase it Hallelujah when he had gone into a restaurant Hallelujah then you saw this elderly lady who was dancing and playing Hallelujah with the policeman who all know the story Hallelujah dancing and the little ones with thee Hallelujah young people praise the life I had time out of love to read it but all the same just try and paraphrase it then we finished Hallelujah brother Branham he was there started to condemn that lead started to condemn that lady started to say so many things against that lady Hallelujah praise the Lord can I have one of the slice Brothers praise the Lord then as brother pranam was condemning that lady the lord gave him a vision of a world that's the world he showed him the world as the words he showed him the world the world began to change the colors changed into a red world can I have another slide my brother that's the vision that the prophet was seeing and the Lord started to speak to the prophet you condemning that one but I took your sins those sins that made the world to be read they are yours can I just the allow me to just read exactly what the prophet says just forgive me Saints I don't like taking much time that much praise the Lord praise the Lord all right I'll try and read the best I can praise the Lord then I began to say I've cut everything all right I'll just go straight to where I want then I begin to see something moving in front of me it looked like a little while a well going around like this I kept watching I saw the world turning around I washed it wait was spraying something off Hallelujah the world was being painted now being sprayed Hallelujah looked it was sprayed of red Crimson blood crawls around the world just like a world going around like a comet it had a world around us I looked at this world just above it I saw I saw Jesus in The Vision he was looking down I see my soul standing down here on Earth doing the things that I shouldn't do and every time that I sit I sinned God would have killed me because the day you eat of of it dare you die God's holiness and Justice requires you'll have to die then I looked there kept rubbing my eyes I said I'm not never want to sleep to sleep it's in a vision I kept watching as I stood behind the door I seen my own sins come up every time they would start to hit the throne his his blood acts like a bumper on a car it quoted our seed shake the blood would run around his face I seen him raise his hands and said father forgive him he doesn't know what he's doing I seen myself do something else it shook him again pump it would have God would have killed me right then but his blood was watching me it was holding my sins I thought oh God did I do that surely it wasn't me but it was then I went walking like this I was
