everyone I mean God bless you all so just a reminder we have the sunday school meeting after after the service and also these are these are band practice as well let's let's go on the scripture to seeking Kings in chapter 3 do we have this it'll be there seeing kings chapter 3 and we'll start reading from verse 7 seeing Kings three and seven seas here and he went so this read from verse six and kingj Ahura went out of Samaria at the same time and numbered all Israel and he went and sent two Jehoshaphat king of Judah saying the king of Moab hath rebelled hath rebelled against the king of Israel and King Jehovah and he went out and sent two king went to Jehoshaphat the king of Judah saying the king of Moab has rebelled against me will thou go with me against Moab to battle and he said I will go up I am as thou art my people as thy people and my horses as thy horses and he said which way shall we go up he answered the way through the wilderness of Edom so the king of Israel went and the king of Judah and the king of Edom and they fetch the compass of seven days journey and there was no water for the host and for the cattle that followed them and the king of Israel said alas that the LORD hath called these three kings together to deliver them into the hand of Moab there's no mention of God telling them to go but Jehoshaphat said is there not a prophet of the Lord that we may inquire of the Lord by him and one of the king of Israel servants answered and said here is elisha the son of shaphat which poured water on the hands of Elijah and and Jehoshaphat said the word of the Lord is with them so the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat and the king of Edom went down to him and Elisha said unto the king of Israel what have I to do with thee get thee to the profits of thy father and the profits of thy mother and the king of Israel said unto him nay for the LORD hath called these three kings together to deliver them into the hand of Moab and Elisha said is the Lord of Hosts liveth before whom I stand surely wear it not that I regard the presence of Jehoshaphat the king of Judah I not look toward thee nor CD but now bring me a minstrel and it came to pass when the minstrel played that the hand the Lord came upon him and he said thus saith the Lord make this valley full of ditches for thus saith the Lord you shall not see wounds neither shall you see rain yet that the valley shall be filled with water and you may drink both ye and your cattle and your beasts and this is but a light thing in the sight of the Lord he will deliver the Moabites enter into your hand amen and this just let's go to Luke chapter 2 just as a context how's that slideshow coming along are we dear here we are okay Luke Luke chapter 2 Matthew Mark and Luke we have it here look - and we're gonna read from verse 41 this is now his parents went to Jerusalem every year this is Jesus now this is Mary and Joseph was speaking of every year at the Feast of the Passover and when he was twelve years old they went up to Jerusalem after the custom of the feast and when they had fulfilled the days they returned as they returned the Child Jesus tarried behind in Jerusalem and Joseph and his mother knew it not sorry you're not tarry and you're not but they supposing him to be have been in the company went a day's journey and they sought him among their kinfolk and and acquaintances and when they found him not they returned back into Jerusalem seeking him and it came to pass that after three days they found him in the temple sitting in the midst of the doctors both hearing them and asking them questions and all that heard him were astonished at his understanding and answers and when they saw him they were amazed and his mother said unto him son why hast thou thus dwelt dealt with us behold my father and I have sought thee sorrowing and he said unto them how is it that ye that ye sought me wist ye not that I must be about my father's business amen may the Lord bless his word you may have your seats this morning now like a Titleist message this morning it's a very may be a very simple thought to many but you've got a my message this morning as you you got to go back where you left them wherever you left them you ought to go back to that spot now we read there and second Kings there was a there was an alliance between Israel and between Judah and Edom was servant I think two to one of those kings and they had decided that they would they would go and they would attack the Marv bites and we see that they found themselves in a predicament where they were seven days in the desert there was no water there you know they and and they begin to say well the Lord has brought us out here to perish but in life if we are led by him he doesn't lead us out to perish he leads us by his hand and where he is is the fullness of joy where he is as joy unspeakable full of glory he is the fountain that can never be quenched he's not a little bubbling trickle of some tap that's just leaking but he's an inexhaustible fountain Amen when Moses spoke to the rock and the wilderness it wasn't just a little trickle that came out of the rock it was a gusher because that water that came out of that rock it watered a million odd people and they're animals that's a lot of water that they needed so would have just been a trickle because if you're in the back of the line you would have died of thirst before you got to get any water it was a gusher came out hallelujah and we know that that rock and the wilderness was Christ amen he is not a little trickle of some blessing I mean he's greater than we can even imagine amen he's an inexhaustible fountain hallelujah and Jesus said you know come and drink of me and out of you will come amen a fountain of water hallelu speaking of a spirit but now in order for that fountain to come forth we had to stay in communion with him with the staying in fellowship with him right and so but then if we go our own way we break that fellowship and we many times presume that he is with us you can't presume that Marian Mary and Joseph they they they went up to Jerusalem you know they went up to the feastin and they and they he was with them for a stage but then when they turned around to walk back to their old life they begin to find out where is he where's where is this Messiah where is the very God that would redeem us where has he gone and they had to retrace their steps until they found where he was they had to go back where they left them they weren't they weren't planning on leaving him there they didn't say no now Joseph didn't say to Mary now honey this is what we're going to do we're going to go to Jerusalem we'll leave Jesus there and we'll come back to Nazareth where they were you know there wasn't a plan but situations in life many times can cause us to leave him behind I meant because because we we know our God he came from glory I mean to bridge the chasm between you and him hallelujah when we were alienated in our minds I mean we were his enemy I mean he came down to bridge the way to bridge the gulf I'm so glad it made me hot in this place but let's just rejoice I mean because this this world wants to make us just indifferent it wants to make us hard it was to make us calloused and wants to make us just flow fly by and watch the world go by I mean that's what the world wants to make us that's not our Porsche but you can get adjusted have you ever seen you know they say there's an experiment if you throw a frog into a pot of boiling water it'll jump out but if you put the frog in and the water's room temperature then you slowly turn up the heat that begins to swim and it swims and then it dies because it slowly gets used to the temperature but then it's too much and it dies we don't want to get adjusted we don't want to get adjusted oh you know the water gets hotter ice just a different season is it a different season you know is it is it just how this is meant to be we don't want to get adjusted to the world and not just the world but our condition I mean because our condition give come callused and i've experienced this very recently and and indifferent and just just you know you can put up a wall and become hardened and you can go your own way presuming that he's with you we mean to be lambs we're meant to be soft gentle amen not not calloused and you know we are soldiers we are we're we're battle-scarred veterans I mean but that doesn't make us hardened against our king I mean that should make us love him more hallelujah we're meant to be soft I mean we mean to be like Lambs I mean we're meant to be like doves this is this is a disposition of what we mean to have doesn't matter what Nathan your characteristics you can be you can be very quiet like a church mouse you can be very boisterous but down in your heart I mean we're meant to be like a lamb meek gentle Lord what is your direction what are you seeking to do what do you want to do in my life now if we if we if we barricade our hearts and barricade our lives and say no this is just how it is amen that's not being like a dove or a lamb we don't want to be like that are you with me let's not get just adjusted or something bad happened to me now I've gotta put up a defense no you don't have to you don't have to put up a defense necessarily you know say Lord come and heal that wounding hill that wounding come and repair that breach doesn't matter if anyone else's change change me I'm going to heaven by myself I don't at the end of the day now don't get me wrong I want you all there but your state I'm not going to let someone else's state hinder me that's in that right I'm not gonna let someone else's state hinder me in my walk it's my walk with God it's not you and me in him it's when it cut now we know we're a body we understand that I'm not disregarding that we're a body if one part of the body suffers we all suffer if one part rejoices we all rejoice right but when it all comes down to the end of the day it's me and him it's not me you and him boil it's me and him so at the end of the day how's my relationship with him that's not how my relationship with everyone else I mean if it's just me you know that's all I really care about what is your relationship with him how's that doing yeah how's your relationship with him going you got to check up sometimes maybe that's just a checking up kind of service but but is that a do you love him more now are you more like him now or you less like him have you gained ground or have you lost ground have you built a bunker or a you are you going forward we don't want to build bunkers I'm not interested in defense we're told to attack we're told to possess the land I meant the rest'll whatever's behind you will take care of itself let's press on I mean let's take what belongs to us hallelujah so they they presume they wait seven days into the desert and then they begin to say here we armed out in the middle but this is how we are sometimes we walk with God we think we're walking with God he's back there he never told you to come here but you're presuming and it's normally how other people treat you causes you to go that way right if it's not under prayer and you haven't really you know it's so easy to hold onto things isn't it it's so easy to hold on to a grudge or have a little bit of unforgive not in here maybe but in here I mean that's why you can't just have a you know repentance you know you can't ever dried out repentance and you don't just repeat you you have one time when you're opinio give your life to God right but then there comes times in your life where you got to go back to that place and you say God break me over mould me over again that's not to get saved again I'm not talking about that but we can get calloused in our and ourselves and we can lose our love for one another and that affects our relationship with God because he says if you love me you love one another by this all me know you are my disciples because you love one another and if you don't love your brother you don't love him that's why toys where the iron sharpens the iron the Balmer the grinding goes on amen and then we and then we begin to hold something eat someone but that is actually inadvertently transferred to our walk with God because we're just looking through those glasses we don't want to be like I don't want to be calloused I don't want to be distant if you're distant from God don't stay distant just takes a heartfelt prayer of sincerity and really repenting but guess what other people say I don't care what I don't I don't care how other people think you know when I when I act or what however I am as presence I don't care about other people I don't shut because other people will see me shouting I don't cry because other people will see me cry I'm worshiping him I'm worshiping him I don't care about anyone else I just want to forget about everyone else and just worship Him we shouldn't we shouldn't don't let the devil ever dictate to you what'll he think of what will she think forget about those kind of thoughts who you here to worship we're not her we're not here to worship one another we're not here to be to be man pleases or for other people to come pat you on the back and say oh that was wonderful I meant that's not why we gather we gather that God would come down hallelujah he would soften hearts he would trust closer to him I mean his his nature would come and become our nature hallelujah that everything we carry through the week we're washed by the water of the word the scripture says so the devil tries to put things on you during the week and you come in here the word and it washes us holy that's why eat sometimes we walk out of service me especially and you feel scared out you feel so light you're feeling so good because he because the people tries to put thee put things on you and subconsciously you hold on to those things and it becomes a grievous weight then he washes you then our God wash us and you feel so much better hallelujah it's how it should be you got to look at now how is your relationship how is it is it is it better than what it was initially or is it become stale has it become casual has it become indifferent how's your relationship with God has it become just your routine this is what I do hey we're creatures of habit as it's just a habit to read your Bible pray listen to the message come to church has just become habit or is it something now if it is that way they are in the desert they had to dig there was a rock there the rock that was smitten the wilderness that followed Israel that rock was still there which was Christ they had to dig he said make the valley full of ditches to get the water they are instructed dig it wasn't fortify yourselves and prepared for the attack dig that's what they had to do it wasn't get all the doctrines straightened out in the end and in all those things dig you got to dig you want to take you have to impress dig a me off but God will do it for me no you have to say take it Lord I don't want this I don't want to be in this condition anymore I don't want to be indifferent to you I don't want to be indifferent to my to my brothers and sisters I want to go back to my first love that's thinking that's thinking because if you really if you're serious and you begin to pray say Lord I don't you know any and you feel broken and you really sincerely from your heart say take this from me and then that's digging that's digging if you hold on to it that's not digging how much water do you want do you want a trickle do you want nothing do you just want the idea of water I don't want theory I want reality Christianity is a reality it's not a theory it's not a nice idea I mean when he is the rock that was smitten amen he is the bread of life that came down out of heaven that was a reality I mean when he was wounded for my transgressions his iniquities was upon me the chastisement of his peace you know you know of my peace was upon him by His stripes I was healed that's not theory that's a reality it's going to be a real thing hallelujah he's broken down every wall that's going to be a real thing hallelujah that he's not a it's not a theory don't let it be a theory don't let it just be a song with some scripture that you put on your fridge or or you post on wherever it's got to be a reality hallelujah and I'm glad that it is a reality amen when when when the first age the Ephesian age was rebuked because thou has left one thing I hold against you thou has left thy first love that was the main problem in their walk I don't want that to be my main problem on my walk thou has left thy first love what happens when your first lovers left it just becomes something you do and it becomes a drudgery and it's not alive and it's not wonderful you say well are you going by feelings if you love someone you feel it if you enjoy being around them there's something you just you feel it right we don't go by feelings but the love brings the feelings and then they're right faith does bring feelings but we don't go my feelings I mean you understand that peace when you get the Peace of passes all understanding that is a feeling but you don't go walking by the fact you have that feeling but it comes you understand what I'm saying if you're full of joy it's not something you just put on you really feel the joy I mean the joy of the Lord is our strength you really feel that joy that's a reality he says thou has left thy first love what happened something came in an Indies Christ spirit came in and it tried to make the church formal weak and powerless and it went from the blazing fire of Pentecost and have cooled down into a form we don't want that that's not our portion Amen but if we if we want to really possess that of not leaving our first love we got to dig we've got to dig we're gonna dig friends there's a rock it can be covered up by all things of life which is just a bunch of sand that has no foundation and you can't you can't satisfy your thirst and a desert when you have no water and this there's a desert I mean I'm just gonna speak this is just how it's gonna be you go to dig they hate to dig a mint and they did not stop digging and I believe you know we don't just want to dig in and and uncover a little bit of the Rock of Ages which is Christ have a little bit of water we should just you just where you say well well I've hit the rock then keep digging keep don't just get rid of the malleus get rid of the strife give her the envy get rid of the bitterness keep thinking it out get rid of the formality get rid of just the casual approach to the whole thing just take it all out get rid of the indifference keep the keep digging to the whole rockers uncovered hallelujah that's what we're called to do and we have the ability to do it I mean our relationship with god should be so wonderful hallelujah it should never plateaus or become indifferent or cold I haven't done the devil blows cold wind into your life it's not our portion don't stand for it don't put up with it for a second I mean if you begin to feel like you're cooling off say God relight the fire come and mold me keep my hat I don't want a concrete house I want to haunt this like it's got like a baby skin on it so soft and supple that he can just take it in his hand and just one small movement of his finger and my whole life has changed he doesn't have to get a sledgehammer and begin to begin to work on me just just one little touch of his finger and everything's different that's how it's got to be friends we need to dig they had a rock we need to dig as your walk with God going this year not talking about trials not talk about while I'm in a trial I'm out of a trial know your relationship with him what's your it's an actually trials that that that doesn't matter we all have trials God uses a trial to mold our character I wouldn't worry about them just because you're in a trial doesn't mean your relationships bet just because you're out of a child doesn't mean your relationships good but how is it through the trial how is it every day how's your how's your relationship are you soft and subtle and pliable in his hand hey that way or you had and calloused and just you won't move because that that's a wall but this person did it to me Jesus was that he was the meekest man now Moses at his time was the meekest man all the earth that was Christ in him Jesus that was a portion of Christ in him but then the fullness of God here bodily a man became flesh he and Jesus was the meekest man all the earth he was on the cross he wasn't calloused he wasn't hard he says I always do the will of my father I always do that which pleases him there's no gulf between him and God you know but remember as a man because he was a man he was fully God but he's fully meant there's no gulf between him and God he didn't he didn't wander off the path and then God had to come and you know get a hold of him and bring him back on the path again he was you say but I'm in this I've been this fallen flesh we are in this fallen flesh but that's why he has a blood that's why he has you're his Holy Ghost in you I trust I mean to keep this thing we have to die daily we have to surrender everything we have out of sincerity to God all of our thoughts our ambitions this thing has to stay in subject and it's not you keeping it in subject there's a big difference it sounds quite quite similar oh we have to keep it in subject but it's not your ability that keeps it in subject it's being surrendered to his Holy Spirit because if you take the reins you're going to end up in the ditch and you have to be calling more than the AAA to get you out but if he has hold of the reins then it's totally different different walk and he's good because we can easily take them back that's why Paul says lay aside every weight and sin that's so easily beset suss easily besets us lay them aside we call the lay things aside a distance between you and God will manifest in different ways in your life your character will be different your relationship with your family will be different and it won't be better it'll be worse and many people they can give very hard and harsh and very domineering and many times that is actually because their walk with God is not good and they're trying to hold on they're trying to keep it all together sometimes we've got to fall apart sometimes we have to fall apart we actually have to because he takes us and he heavy ever see ever seen a vessel someone's molding clay shaping of us but then they just pick it up they throw it back onto the wheel and they begin to mold it again sometimes it has to happen it's not a bad thing it's actually a very good thing but the thing is clay has no free moral agency it's just clay you have a choice he picks you up I'm gonna throw you on the wheel and if you say no okay I'll put you on the shelf and then you sit and clay sits there and it becomes dried out and becomes hard and it becomes brittle it doesn't become flexible anymore that's what clay does we are like into clay but then the master comes again he doesn't want remember he is the fountain he is the inexhaustible fountain how much of the fountain do you want in your life how close to him do you want to be he's broken down every every every Gulf his blood puts us on speaking terms again but you don't want the you don't want the relationship to be like strained or under tension we all am i all speaking someone's language this morning you don't want it to be strained intense and you know I'm gonna do my thing and this is how it's gonna be and you know we don't want it to be like that we want it to be like this this is the age where man becomes one with God and it's not ten years away it's now 2018 why did he die on the cross that God and man would be reconciled that would become one that's what he wants us to be now they had to dig and it was their digging which got them the victory where we have I won't be too much longer to be honest he says this we've riddled us now another thing about a lamb we have to be lambs remember another thing the lamb is the lamb is willing to submit its rights now this isn't the church in its condition if you even want to hear a service and you say Lord check me up according to this one you go listen to this one because he doesn't put it out there he brings it in here the church and its condition what is your condition this morning I'm not trying to I just want you to think about let's be sober-minded Lord how we doing he's always doing real good but how are you doing in the relationship he doesn't he doesn't have to say sorry and make things right he's already made things right he died on Calvary to make things right when you could not go to where he was he came to you hallelujah so it's errand it's our in Lord Oh am I going my own way presuming that that that you'll with me we don't just want to be caught up in tradition this this can become a tradition oh we have church and we have prayer meeting we have church and we have camp and we you know if you had this service and this one and this one it can become a tradition it's got a there's got to be something of the word that anchors in your soul it's got to be alive we're eating in something I mean it's like you have a real good meal it's wonderful and there's something in you you enjoy it it should be the same thing this now some day we will eat because it's just like energy to them that's fine if you're in that category that's fine okay but some people they love to eat and they love the flavors the the symphony of flavor you know now the is not just fuel you just eat it too this is a symphony of flavor a little earlier brother Andy but but if it becomes just fuel there's something wrong I mean it should be this is this is a life this is eternal life and if I had a message book I'll put them together because to me it's the same thing the message reveals Christ in here it's not a different it's not a different thing and so this is eternal life in print this is God do you know this is God in print form this is God in print form doesn't matter what people say about translation God is in these words God is in these words and if you and faith take this into your heart you'll see it manifest this is this is there's no book like this book there is no book like this book but to you FFT you it's like any other book how's your relationship with God amen because if it's just like another book then something's wrong but if it's something if it's wonderful I I love to read the girls well we'll get back to that I love this sometimes when I read the girls of bedtime story picture Bible I enjoy it more than they do and we worried about the resurrection I wish I should just bring the picture of it and and Mary's there and she comes to the tomb the tomb is open she and she comes in with the other woman and there's the angel sitting there he's not here he's risen they run off she comes out weeping and broken and there's a man standing there hallelujah and and he says why do you weep why do you weep what's wrong what's wrong with you you know because she she had a relationship with this Jesus - but things of life changed and she didn't know what was going on and she is weeping why do you weep and she turns around looks him in the eyes and she thinks he's a gardener tell me where you've taken his body and I'll carry him away oh I don't think she couldn't maybe you would have been pretty hard to drag her body around but that was her I want to take this this one I don't know what's happened to him but I want to take him with me carry him away and she he says one word Mary and her eyes come open it's you it's the lawn I love that picture I should shut to you one day but it's more than emotion it means a lot to me because that was a prophecy the Rays of death bear resurrection was a prophecy and we're living out the fulfillment of that prophecy I mean where the world does the world will do what it will do but here comes the resurrected Jesus hallelujah and he comes by your way oh man you shouldn't if you just feel indifferent about this eye you should pray say God make this alive to me I mean this means the world to me here comes our God he steps out of history he steps out of his word hallelujah and he proves himself Here I am I've come to speak to you I mean nothing you'd learn a bunch of stuff I mean but you'd become one with me hallelujah that when the time comes you'll walk from this this dimension into the next dimension hallelujah isn't that wonderful isn't that glorious I mean that God when this world is falling apart there's atomic bombs hanging and did they're in missiles they're all over the world they're gonna they're gonna be let loose one day I mean this you know a great the Great Tribulation is going to see it in the Prophet told us that World War 2 was just like an amateur tribulation and that was a horrible thing that was it just as a amateur thing what's happened when it's going to be the real thing but we're not called to go into that we're not called to go into that he's come he is here his everything he is apart from his physical body is here upon the earth we got to meet his physical body in the year but his spirit is here his spirit is here everything he is is here my bridegroom is with me I mean our God is with us hallelujah our King is here I mean we don't need to wait to to crown him king of kings and Lord of lords over there we can crown them now amen use your life to crown him now well only you can use your worship the crown enough isn't it isn't he worthy isn't he wonderful haloo doesn't mean everything to you he should do hallelujah he stepped out of history heat the son of man is still here there was Jesus Christ the Son of man is Jesus Christ he's still present he's still with us oh when I get to heaven oh really rejoice he's here I mean we'll meet him in the air his physical body show we'll meet him there buddy everything is is here hallelujah that makes me happy it should make us very happy are you going by feelings not if you love him you'll feel it they will be I believe in a hearts out religion by the brand believed in a half out religion amen we should have hot found religion are you going by emotion no when I don't feel that I I still love him I mean when I feel as dead as a post I know he still is and he'll take care of me so it doesn't matter how I feel I'm in his hands and I don't want to get out hallelujah I became his prisoner I'm not looking to make a jail break hallelujah locked me in the in the prison Lord I want to be there I don't want to even have an open door I'm not looking for a way out I mean I found my way in and there's a fountain holy it isn't an exhaustible fountain and I've been drinking from the fountain and it just gets more glorious every day hallelujah I had to do don't let thee you know it's like you have like a what do you call it you're a flood and what happens with the flood all the dirt and stuff gets washed down and then you and then after the flood is done you know you can be real deep and sludge when the enemy comes in like a flood no this is just me and fellowship here when the enemy comes in like a flood what does he do he brings a lot of sludge with him he tries to cover up the rock of ages' amen you got to dig when the enemy is warring against you remember he will he may war with you every day of your life but you should be rejoicing because you have something he wants and you will not give it to him hallelujah it's actually counted a privilege when the devil fights you because he's one afraid of you and Tory wants to destroy you because you are not his prisoner hallelujah I'm Gladys that case all the guns of hell are against me glory that means I'm not on this side hallelujah brother but if it's all peace in the valley something's wrong I'm so glad hey let the heathen rage let them imagine a vain thing let the let hell breathe it's whatever breath upon the earth let them do all those things I have my bridegroom let his guns be trained I'm not worried God has confidence in her salvation he will keep her salvation he's not afraid of a challenge he's never been afraid of a challenge amen and he does not change he's the same yesterday today and forever we have to stay like lambs go back you say well I'm not the Christian I once was go back to where you left him you have to go back he says now another thing I read a bit of the spool just start from the top now another thing the lamb is actually hold on I love technology there you go I'll read it from here and another thing the lamb is the lamb is willing to submit its rights now God wants us to be lambs but there's so many times that we don't want to submit our rights for food our rights so many of you say well I've got rights brother branham that's true but are you willing to fulfill forfeit your rights are you willing to give your rights that God would that God could lead you this is in here good luck well trying to read it there if you don't know Spanish but but that he could are you willing si you have to be willing to have a foot for foot your rights that he can lead you who wants to be led who wants to be led you have to forfeit your foot give it over what do you think about it and every part of your life how you dress where you go how you treat your your your family how you treat each other all those things I know that's you say but but that's legalism no you got to give your rights over in order to be a prisoner a real prisoner cannot cannot choose where they sleep cannot choose what they eat cannot choose what they wear cannot choose where they go the warden and and so the police off yeah you're the prison guards but it's the mind of the warden you know they are living out what the warden thinks to do they're in control imagine if I was in prison I sit down mr. warden sir I don't like these stripes it's very unflattering you know or I want to I don't like the Dacor of my salad like this and this in the inner now if he's a real warden he'd say no you are my prisoner amen you are my prisoner but if I'm not a prisoner oh I'll just say mr. warden I want a different cell I actually don't want to be in this prison anymore I'm just gonna go and if you walk out the door well you know the prisoner anymore right cuz you know you know captive he wants love prisoners Jesus Christ wants love prisoners I want to be lead by him it doesn't matter what other people say about it I want my relationship with him to be the best I've got one life to live amen and it's your relationship with God is the most important thing because that will produce character member we only take our character with us but I want to live a life that it'll be well done my good and faithful servant it was well done I enjoyed my walk with you upon the earth this is God speak I enjoyed it we had a lot of great fun we had a lot of great times together we went through some scrapes but it was worth it wasn't it hallelujah I delivered you out of them all yes you did Lord hallelujah amen I comfort you when you're comforting I mean when you're mourning amen I mean I comforted you I guide you through some very dark places yes Lord even through the valley of the shadow of death but I fear no evil because with me hallelujah isn't that right hallelujah now that's what the matter with our churches today and the great majority that the gentleness of the Lamb of God we're supposed to be lambs but we've become everything else but lamps and that's the reason as soon as we get that attitude the spirit of the Dove of the Holy Spirit takes her flight and leaves when you know the Lamb he takes his flight and leaves now you don't want to get used to that they were seven days in the desert that's a long time but this it's a hot place and very cold at night they got acclimatize to being in the desert oh but now we have no water that's a long time to go isn't it with animals soldiers everything but they got used to it Joseph and Mary they win a few days without Jesus oh where has he gone we have to go back where we left them don't get acclimatized what did he do and there's nothing now this is me but I believe it's very true you can't justify being distance from God you cannot justify it doesn't matter what anyone has done to your seed or whatever or hearsay or gossip or whatever it doesn't matter nothing can justify you being distant from God because you put that thing above your relationship with Christ who you who do you have a relationship with do you have relationship with gossip and malice and strife and envying and pain and hurt is that the one you are united to it's did all that die on Calvary for you amen did that create the world did that before the foundation of world chose you in him no Jesus did the Word of God did my best an update oh there we go oh yes it's Spanish on the bottom sorry now it says here and that's the reason today that we're wondering what's the matter with the Pentecostal church now it's because we've taken on a different nature we've taken our nature that we want our rights we're going to do what we know that's right to do and we become arrogant arrogancy manifests in different ways right we become arrogant we become hostile we become indifferent we let temper come in we let selfishness come in how's your walk with God we are no different member we are men and women like any other men and woman any other every other age had their battles every age had their bells we're not exempt just because the mystery of God has finished in this day the son of man has been revealed the seals are open you know all those things all those wonderful things that men have been looking for to manifest and now here just the book is open all those things have happened just because that's happened doesn't mean we're exempt from the works of the enemy that doesn't give us a free pass the enemy has always fought the believer he didn't quit when Moses walked into Egypt saying let my people go he he just turned up the heat more Pharaoh's heart was hardened I will not let them go and you go all the way through the scripture the devil doesn't just you know as soon as God comes on the scene he doesn't just get a white flag and say I give up you're gonna win he he fights all the more and he's the same the devil is actually he doesn't change so we're not exempt from these things I'm gonna finish with that we don't want a difference to come in or temper or selfishness if you have those things in your life where you become hostile or arrogant I'll say and this is from personal experience if you have those things in your life God has lift your your carnal nature has come back to the forefront again and the Dove is taking its flight that's why you have to have a real repentance from your heart and the Dove will come back again I it is what it is so now I'm just gonna leave you with that question how is your walk with God today how's it doing I'm not talking about trials and what's going on how's your relationship is it better than it was or have you become indifferent and cool and it's just become what you do if it is you don't have to stay that way and you're welcome to come for prayer or just pray in your seat but if you want deliverance from something you're more than welcome to come for prayer and I'm gonna place myself on the altar too so this just bow heads in a word of Prayer and if you want to come forward you're welcome but let's just pray all together gracious father Lord you are the Lamb of God and father we have to have the same nature as you Lord that that you can abide Lord we want to sing truly hereby it's he abides in me I'm rejoicing night and day as I walked in there away for the comforter abides with me father we thank you Lord that that song is a reality Lord God we thank you you abide but father comes times and I walk where we we do grieve you and Lord out of situations of life and you take your flight waiting for us to come back to that spot where we left you Lord we don't want to walk many days farther without feeling your spirit without feeling tender and and feeling that love Lord there's something about you Lord when you come Lord and and you speak to our hearts and Lord you move upon our lives and but father when we're distant from your Lord that doesn't happen that way and it just goes all up into our head and father I just pray for each one here Lord may we break up that fellow ground Lord may we dig we thank you we can dig Lord through real heartfelt repentance father I pray you be merciful to each one here Lord we wanna we just want to walk with you hand in hand no because if you're with us Lord all of the hardness and trials of life it doesn't matter Lord if we know that you are with us Lord it means the world so I pray for each one here forgive us Lord of our our indifference Lord letting that Lamb nature leave us father that nature of a wolf come back we don't want to be a wolf lord you can't abide on a wolf we have to be a lamb Oh heavenly dove mould us over take us to your house place us on your wheel Lord may we feel your clay Lord your hands on our clay Lord bring the water Lord we don't want to be brittle and Lord like Dustin and hide that we'll just fall to pieces but we want to be flexible in your hands Lord as Lord as you molds and shape us into a vessel of honor father may you grind it Lord forgive us a very Lord all of our wrongs and lord I pray your spirit would fall on each one now Lord if there's Lord I know these people here that have left you someplace further bring it to their remembrance that they can put that right with you Oh God father may we're not reason your way but we don't want to reason your way O God but father we were to say we're wrong Lord takes a real man or woman of God to say they're wrong and father we are wrong we've been wrong forgive us Lord Jesus take us back to you father we know you you will receive us you're waiting for us to come back to you O God so father may you grant it Lord in Jesus Christ
