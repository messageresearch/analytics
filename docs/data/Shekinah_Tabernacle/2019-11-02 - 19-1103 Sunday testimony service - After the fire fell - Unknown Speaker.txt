thee and consider these saying now this is this is our testimony this is my testimony saying is this the man that made the earth to tremble that did shake the kingdoms what set him what said it was

night we had this time of singing until the early hours of the morning 3:00 a.m. or something can man I still haven't got my voice back but you know there's been times when we've sung I remember down in Christchurch at the can and we're singing in the kitchen has this amazing atmosphere and it seems like every time we come together and we get into this place where the spirit can just flow and everyone's on one Accord and it and we just sing with all their hearts and it's worship and each time it's just coming up higher and higher and I just love it and then I come through this week and the devil just really pounded my throat and thought how can I even song lead you know that our God is tremendous and he's greater and it doesn't matter what the devil does you know the Bible says when we get over to that other side we won't even remember the devil no more not even the memory of hallelujah when I'm in need I call on the Lord and he hears me me [Music] [Applause] right [Music] to I've got to man by yes he is Almighty [Music] about guys [Music] me Kasturi sir ser me financial [Music] just loves a paradox just stay in your position come into action oh god it's true man stress you the

[Applause] came down promised glory Plus [Applause] hallelujah amen if you feel like dancing this morning you just dance don't feel no shame don't be worried don't even worry what is happening around you this is you and the Lord it's time to rejoice we've got to do things a little bit different this morning because we want to have some testimonies you want to hear what the Lord did for you it can so maybe you could have your seats and actually before we do that then brother and Pol has got a song special how about you place us were there and then we'll have some testimonies god bless you brothers and sisters I greet you all in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ amen he's still my Savior my Lord and Savior amen so I just say I'm not seeing as you all know but this song was laid on my heart this week and when we were having a prayer at home and then I said to my to my wife hey I want to sing this song alone because sometimes things are more meaningful when you do them alone sometimes the impact in your heart comes so strong when you do it alone that is why Jesus Christ he died alone for you and me amen so as I'm going to sing this song I just want to encourage you but the camp was also wonderful for me really I had a wonderful time I don't know how you're feeling but I'm still feeling camp inside me and then but but you know the Lord brings us to the service to be uplifted to be encouraged you know to be motivated to be corrected isn't it so Justin just think about someone who who might be sitting behind you next to you in front of you that maybe maybe that person have got a bed in you know maybe that president have got have got something in their hearts that that just needs you to bear them before God you know and and if you do that you know God will hear just imagine if that person is answered or helped because of your prayer how would you like to happen just imagine there's somebody sitting next to you if you just mention the name of that person before God and then God just give them happiness won't that be wonderful but I wanna sing a song that talks about my life amen maybe brother it can put it there for us if he's out of shooting just take the words Amen sister a little maybe you can just help me it's a saying I'm gonna I'm gonna go my own kin because my voice the more the devil takes my voice the more the Lord gives me anointing amen it says all my life long I have painted forward round from some cool spring that I hope quench the burning of the first I felt with him Oh hallelujah I found him who my soul so long as cliff Jesus II despise my longings through his love I know Edie warned them hast around me till my strength was almost gone on longed my soul for something better only still to hunger or Oh hallelu we are I

hallelu yeah hallelujah oh my soul so long escape Jesus I despise my longing the new Islam I know well of water ever springing bread of life so rich and free oh I'm told wet never failing my ratima is to me lifting it together oh my so long as Creek is I said he's fast my logic Louise llama yeah my soul [Applause] [Music] my son [Music] despise my long live hallelujah amen what a testimony Jesus satisfies all my longings hallelujah the more that God has delivered you out of the more that that is so real to a brother Andy he satisfies all my longings when I don't find that satisfaction in the world I say this to the young people this is my testimony it didn't matter what I achieved when I lived their life of sin that there was nothing that could satisfy there was nothing I would see the goal and I would get there and I go this is that now I'm gonna be happy I just never said it only in Jesus will you find your satisfaction amen just want to welcome our visitors - from Ozzie brother raff I said it ro I can't spell my own name and sister now we welcome you it's nice to have you we love having visitors [Applause] he's got a testimony for us this morning [Music] you know I had such a good time again you know you you I was just so I was gone I went beyond the split and when brother cadre preached and he said let's go to heaven I went to heaven that night you know after all of the you know there was some sound barriers that got broken that night amen there was lots of elbow room for young people breaking through people that have been mown down by the devil and cut down two stumps lives that were almost ready to commit suicide all of that the devil got defeated that they've all got wasted and you know seeing that I was just so grateful that I just got beyond anything and I was just walking I don't know if anyone saw but I was going like this and it was like these burdens that had been built up for so long for people praying for people and you're just watching him cry out to the Lord it was just so rewarding and I was just so amazingly blessed more than just another testimony so that song that brother importers sung there was exactly the Sunday school that we just I mean you do we just taught that on Sunday school so jesus said come unto me and I will give you rest from your burdens and I will satisfy your soul and I know the young people in my class were probably listening that going well it's amazing [Applause] greetings brothers and sisters I'm just thankful to the Lord that army with amongst you guys is I'll be watching you guys online and because fellowship was far away from where we lived and I'm just so grateful that I can come somewhere and she amongst brothers and be encouraged by the church and to be the Lord knows their needs and he's our provider and we're here for a purpose and to do his will and he and two receivers to receive His blessings today that I might live this week and do what he's given us from today until whenever so love ezel it's such a blessing to have there down there live streaming and we were so blessed by a tow and then we moved here so I think my audience god bless the Saints okay I'm just gonna testify just what happens when you're at the camp I had this barren for one of my sons who we've been talking about accepting the Lord as your Lord and personal Savior for quite a few months and then he would be saying no he wants to make sure that his life is right with God before he goes ahead he wants to have an experience with God before he goes ahead then Saturday morning as I was preparing myself to go for the kitchen duties and the Lord speaking to me saying speak to him explain to him that you don't have to be right before you come to me that's why I take a drunkard I cleanse them I take a man who's busy smoking cigarettes I cleanse them so go talk to him but that morning I didn't have the time I quickly went and then afterwards I called them and say let's go and rest there was after the festival has a lot go and rest but just before we arrested and then I told him the message that I had for him and then we spoke about it for about maybe five ten minutes or so and then he understood what we were talking about then we went and rested the evenin service when you went they one of the codes that brother Qaeda put up was exactly that and then I even looked at him and then he said yes mam I saw it and then I just accepted that as as more of a confirmation and as something that I can only wait for just the manifestation to happen and then on Wednesday night when brother Abe was busy preaching as well he put up the same quotation about where you need to wait for the Lord to be the one cleansing you you just come as you are I just cannot progress exactly what you've said but when you got home I said did you see that he said I saw it and it exactly what you told me about the kind you say I said okay we just wait on the lot and just pray about it and then we we move on and then the second one was when you know you always have a burden for each one of your kids for their own needs then I had a need for the other one for the Holy Ghost and then as we were going for the morning prayers I remember after we finished praying the other morning and then my husband was praying for the exact same thing and then we just kept on praying and praying and praying while brother Qaeda was busy giving the testimonies of the sisters who the other ones they may he touch me on that right me attacked me on the left I was just in the spirit praying for him but I said Lord it's not me I'm praying for so I'm not gonna say for the left shoulder over the right shoulder I'm just playing that before we live the service that you may touch him only to find that he was busy praying in that moment saying lord I need the Holy Spirit and as a proof that I have the Holy Spirit may brother Kyle pray for me and while he's praying for me I can't believe he's dead the right of the left but he was praying that his dead would be holding him on one of the shoulders and when a Qaeda would be holding him on one of the shoulders and then I was closing my eyes I was worshiping I don't know how it happened but as I looked I saw him being plateful I had no idea what is happening and then all of a sudden when I opened my eyes again he is busy it's him as brother Kyrie gets his dead they're busy praying for him when we went to the room the following money is that you know what do you know what happened yesterday I said no only I only know that I prayed for you and then that got me taught you that Boracay to me pray for you even without you going up and then that's when he related the story to me that actually you know the confirmation for him that he had received the Holy Spirit I was sitting there thinking the Lord saying you know what it doesn't have to be in very big things that you see the lot you need to be able to see the Lord even in the very small things for for you to be able to then be able to come and see bigger things how do you expect to have faith to heal cancer how do you expect have faith to be able to heal depression or in other bigger things when you don't see him even the smaller things I just want to thank the Lord for being with me for just answering my prayers for blessing me honestly speaking Kemp was a real blessing but as brother James saying then the following week it was hectic but who is there thing they're not aiming [Applause] god bless you I can't give a testimony and not sing the song is in the system is called just to be more like you Lord and I wrote a few years ago and it has to do with being able to judge right and there was a sermon that was been ministered up North End like Jesus keeps all of his appointments and he was just saying it's just imagine if someone like the woman that came to watch Jesus someone would walk side into the church right now and go and wash one and she wouldn't look dressed properly she would look after the world and just start taking off the shoes and start crying over the feet and just washing it and all that well how would we judge it you know and and then like was this camp I mean there's so much happening but I just stick with this and for me I've gone through sure depression myself just in the last year or so and it's been amazing because I never thought I would ever go anywhere near it amazing because particular okay and I would have probably walked past her years ago I saw her years ago up north I will I didn't even consider here because the state that she was in but I had to go through what I had to go through to reach out to her this time and I know it was the Lord you know so we have sometimes I don't know it can be maybe opinion or judgment fulness or something like that or not standing but the Lord will lead us through places where we then can understand and think like he does to act like he would to make the right decision and that was my testimony and I'll just sing the song to you [Applause] [Music] [Music] thank you better just to talk like you're talking to act like you X just to be more like you Lord just to see Lexi and to be like you up just to be like you know just to live to honor your name and to be like you love just to die to ourselves and surrender ourselves and to be like you we will [Music] bless your holiness [Music] magnifier [Music] to be No this do you like it see like you see just to be [Music] just to judge like a judge and to love like you do just to be [Music] just a little to honor you and to be [Music] and to be [Music] [Music] we can the breath [Music] to be we want to be I want to be you [Music] [Applause] [Music] then I go brother James I got a small testimony which is uh so this is the first camp that we we tried to sound everything was new and everything went wrong might so you're standing in front of a lot of people and the whole purpose that we they is we are in the Lord's army we are serving the Lord everything we do is for the Lord but see the more you try the more you fail now I want this to sink in the more you try the more you fail now in in by default by nature I'm very OCD when it comes to things working and it needs to work and it always needs to work and it has to be right and enough batteries and enough mics and everything has to be right and this camp everything was wrong I had people singing in the mic dies and then I had people giving them a mic and I didn't unmuted and everything went wrong and then you sit there at the back in you and you you have a one-on-one talk with the Lord and say Lord why did everything go wrong I was serving I'm in my line of duty you know I'm standing here just wanting the base for your kingdom why is it going wrong and it and it cuts because you want the Lord's work to be perfect you want it to be so perfect like yes perfect and sorry I'm feeling really sorry for myself and I'm sitting behind that that shot and now I'm also by myself because I have to listen to what the full-backs is doing cause we brother Qaeda is hoarse so there's a lot of things going on and I'm sitting Lee and I'm saying Lord I'm missing something again I'm missing something cause everything can't go this wrong all the time and it's just like he says and it doesn't speak to me but the thought just came I've got everything in control nothing's out of cater and I'll never forget brother by the cadre was preaching that Sunday night Anna and I walked around the corner to see what's going on because he was at the stage where people were praying and they were laying hands upon him and the ministers was in the anton chains were being broken and I looked and I saw a young man I never forget it on his knees at the altar and it was two ministers praying for him and he got what he wanted and that whole weekend doesn't matter what you think went wrong for him it went right okay so that's why we there so don't look at what's going wrong you'll miss your blessing look at what's going right okay so all praise be to God he once again delivered and you'll always deliver and we'll always judge them faithful okay amen don't know what is here but I'm just really thankful to the Lord that he's so mindful and as you know I broke my ankle a few weeks ago and do this whole thing I was asking what listen have I got to learn because just before Kent this is not convenient I still have to do everything but now I'm just slower and it's painful and what is the lesson and I read in the scriptures and just spoke to me and said that you're the teachers will no longer be in a corner but I'll be playing this is the way and I was confident the Lord was showing me then we had in the family all show is his he had to break that little lambs League just hold it close because it wasn't listening and I really thought that was that was me and I said Lord I feel like I'm in your arms but I'm still kicking around I just want to just listen to what you've got to say and then again I realized that so often I look at myself what am i doing it might been a good enough Christian in my sins because I love the Lord with all my heart there's nothing I love more than him and I want to please him with all my heart and I just so long does he is raisin to be there and so often I look at myself in the code but you're failing you're not good enough you knows not sincere enough for if eternal you know things are so important to you then why are you focusing on something natural or just constantly these mind bezels and it Kemp like so many times the Lord has just spoken to me no you are mine I've chosen you I've done it and you're you know and I'm so thankful and it Kemp there was that night on I think at Sunday and Saturday night whose singing no longer a slave to fear and he says I have chosen you from my mother's womb and it just spoke to my heart so much and I said Lord brother KJ was saying you know that the woman was bone lead him come and pray and put his hand on my shoulder and these things I said lord if this is you just confirming it confirm it to me one more time let my husband who's busy up the front let him just stand out now come to me and pray with me that we can stand together and hope believes us and he just stood up right there at the front and looked around looking for me and walk straight to the back and put his hand on me and the whole he goes just came down on us both and I said Lord oh never doubt you [Applause] global issue Saints wonder which symbol I can hide behind Thank You sisters I'll share that your audience of me I was really blessed with their father here when he brought up the young kids and actually broke the situation there was a mine concept coming around through the church I felt and they're all going to be wondering how we're going to start this in right being brought the young kids up in an out of every heart in a break every spirit and it strengthened those weak change to realize that God can come through the little ones and I felt like I was a little one that morning and why I say this is because edy put me right up the front and usually I'm the guy that hides right behind the back there one day or consistency's brother Phil is your turn to shine now the point that made me shine was in the time of him preaching about Dupree and what we have all been through in what we've gone through little stages to me I saw people crying I saw people have been released I saw people being healed I saw people who had no more holding inhibitions to themselves their heart was being opened the onion peel was coming off bit by bit those same people that I saw the next day were the ones they were pulling standing up pulling pulling because there's something bubbling bubbling and it wasn't me thank you [Applause] princey I mean this Kimber was awesome blessed me so much that's always obvious also speaking to me Allah o honorable service on Saturday morning 10 o'clock I truly pray to God God please speak to me was before him I was so happy at church but own and touch only at workplace I was so struggling I was so hard in pressure I'd know God ID now can I hand it all to stop because you are expending as well about three clinics it so much paperwork to do it's a quite hard for me but I want to lay his side and to keep it to God so Cal please speak to me I want to be free I don't want you I want to carry all the stuff thank you so much and God spoke to me through Braddock hydrate he said you go free in the name of Jesus go free in the name of Jesus is twice Satan you can hold her you turn her loose so she may worship the true and the Living God this day savage and had to come to your house don't be afraid that's God don't be afraid that God his book - I said well he's here today that's the Holy Ghost over you go free in the name of potatoes you know when you think I'll speak twice you know that's come you know and in Egypt I mean I mean he had a dream twice so that about God a meet Joseph said that he will do a temple he will do it that's why I mean twice about for dreams so I believe that God will

prayer and accept our you know he answered our prayers I just believe that I just give all the glory to God and it does be free because who yeah chosen people thank you so much [Applause] [Music] praise the Lord brothers and sisters I greet you in the wonderful name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ as we all stand and testify how great our God is and how wonderful he is to us we sometimes we we take it for granted so we could see the hand of the Lord move over the weekend the Labor weekend from day one from Friday evening we could see the Lord's hand in everything that we had to do from from the organization to the setup of the auditorium the preparations in the kitchen and the dining hall the preparations for all the rooms for visitors everything was ordained by the Lord there was nothing out of place maybe we in our humanity like my brother said you know we thought this wasn't working right or that wasn't making making sense so this wasn't gelling but I'd like all our parents all our adults in the church first to stand up please now look look around look around look at look at the number we have now this number is around 20 or maybe 20 20 plus 4 what the Lord has done and the way that he has used each one of you to put your hearts and put yourselves one side but put your hearts to the Lord's hand and let him work and provide and make this camp possible so I'd like you to put your hands together for yourselves and for your brothers and sisters because without you without you seniors standing in your position this couldn't have come to pass now ask for the children to stand up our children from our church each one of you stand up please right y'all have been the true light in testimony in the church camp throughout the church grounds when when when our brothers and sisters from Auckland and from discipline and Taranaki and and and the South Island and everywhere that came through even there's a family there from Hungary that came through with their children when they see y'all y'all were the true lights because y'all played with every child you'll enjoyed yourself you're stood in your position of duty when you're recalled David you stand up David you stand up right because it's not about missing the opportunity y'all stood in your did your jobs Caleb in the back there you'll skid and did your jobs we appreciate each one of you alright David even you did a double portion I saw you working hard in the kitchen well done well done those things stand out when we at the back and we'll look at our our our children and we see that the Lord is using them and working with them and making them do things out of their comfort zone we like to shy away we'd like to be like brother full and and be in the back but he had to get the front seat alright [Applause] everything is in the Lord's hands there's nothing that will will be missed I would also talk black take this opportunity now to ask for forgiveness from my brothers and sisters I know it was your camp it was your place to shine it was your place to be comfortable we had sisters and brothers doing their kitchen work and toilet duties and sitting up and all the background work while everyone came to the auditorium and you came late to church and I moved your places and I took your Bibles and I shuffle things around we were the host party our duty was first to make sure our gifts are comfortable our gifts are seen to and taken care of in whichever way possible so if I moved your Bibles if I moved your spaces if you didn't get the same seat again forgive me but the Lord knows why the Lord knows why you know we we have to make all our our gifts feel comfortable first because without everyone coming together to the camp the camp wouldn't have taken the next level we we as a church and the camp together wouldn't have gone to the next level it's only by the hand of Lord you know we had small camps before we use a small chapel we used the dining hall only and at this time he's provided our needs and he's exceeded it abundantly for everything that we had to do from start to finish you know which ever brother or sister played a part in this whichever child it's only for the glory of God so please forgive me if I moved your seats and your were uncomfortable and you'll had hard plastic seats and whatever it was the Lord was they we got feed we got fed from day one till the Monday and we still got fed on witness day again and we're gonna get frayed again today so you won't go starving alright the Word of God is good please his name Amen right just also to echo brother come in say thank you so much every single one of you if I actually named all of you who helped I'm gonna be naming everyone cuz all of you gave so much and we really really appreciated it and you know I am we wondered because the last camp we did all together you know we'd had slow cookers and braai so it was like what 50 80 people and slow cookers and rice cookers is completely different then why do we decide 300 at some of them 300 people fed everybody happy perfect amount of salad perfect amount of meat perfect amount of leftover curry for everybody just young I mean so thank you all for your help that meant that we could be in the services Oh your extra help your all went over and above you all really did you came you don't have to but you all came and really helped us and we want to thank the Lord so much because even the lady from the camp rang me the next day and she said do you want to know how the Lord looked after usually said that oven because we had one oven that was our a good oven and it had fitted about seven bain-marie trays in it so that was our main cooking oven she said I blew up the day after we left so we would have been stuck so yeah just thanking the Lord for providing I just fell I just say something so I know I had to stand up but there's so much the Lord was just kind of speaking but specifically he touched so much on this one spirits and depression and things and and as if he said it just for me which I know he said it for many people it was well worth it to be there and I'm you know no one ever wants to talk about things that are uncomfortable or you know things that are hard because everyone feels like no one's going to understand there you know maybe they don't they don't want to talk about it or whatever but but he specifically and to be honest I think I think I've ever even read the quote before that I remember I think it was 52 and I tend to listen to a lot of more of the messages that are later on because they are much clearer than the older messages but he brought up that one little boy oh I had a spirit attached to money was 12 years old and that's why you felt you couldn't give his heart to the Lord and you know God does deal so much with children and you know we think all they're just they're just little kids they're just preteens or just teens no they're they're a soul that God is trying to get a hold of and uh if i brother branham talks so strongly about 12 13 you know being the age of accountability you know the devil is so strongly before then trying to get a hold of them as well it's not just the lord who wants to touch their lives you know so just sort of encourage you that no matter what age your small children are oh they're 5 or 6 or 10 or 16 or 18 you just pray them through because you know the Lord said that these kind don't come out just by haphazard Ness it takes fasting in prayer and I I know this by experience that it's true don't ever give up because saying God's timing sorry so I really thank the Lord for what he brought there by the cadre through the weekend because it really brought peace in my heart as well so I say thank you God bless you and I'm just gonna stand over here if you don't mind it is a very big thing for me to stand up so I'm just gonna stand here no I've got my Jersey okay um so it was an incredible incredible camp as you all know I think I've shared a bit with sister Shannon it was a huge man battle for me and the Friday and the Saturday I think just from we have come from listening to tapes Tang and her never being part of a church every time there is a new minister or someone that stands up in the front it takes me time to feel comfortable so I struggled on Friday I felt the spirit of the law but I struggled on Saturday I thought Lord just help me how I see my brothers and sisters standing and rejoicing and I want to do that too and something happened I don't know win I don't know how but I started screaming and even like lost nod I was thinking wow it's so embarrassing why did I do that what was the screaming good me you know did you make yourself do that I didn't I'm not that is not me and that was on the Saturday morning and from then I was like completely different I couldn't you know I like to sit it's comfortable for me my legs and which the Lord is He healed me from to you I couldn't keep from standing I was so excited and then the Saturday evening service every every service there was just some little victory I was sitting in us just thinking oh Lord the morning was so good I just need you to be a God and I need you to come and just clean up the stuff you know I've got all these things that are attached to you from years of pain and struggle and and within five minutes per grade I was said we gonna mow down all this weeds Wow like it's such little things but that's huge you know that's being connected on one spirit and then obviously the Sunday morning service was incredible and Sunday evening was a breakthrough I was praying a lot for a certain young man because I wanted him to have the freedom I wanted him to just have a breakthrough and joy and I think we all know something happened at some point when brother Ben went up and he once started praying there was this huge breakthrough and all of a sudden it felt like time Stood Still you know I love to write songs and I have so many other testimonies I'd love to share with you guys this is the start maybe but it is I've always put convicted and profess it as well that I'm too scared to go to the front I don't have the strength to go to the front I can't I can't I can't and I also feel like the devil gives us things sometimes to realize when we delivered from them to realize what a great power he is so that suddenly evening when that when everyone was just touched by the Lord and luck whether any said I felt like the heavens just opened and we were no longer on earth I remember opening my eyes I found myself all over the hall for some reason usually I stay in one place I was there with me I was there I don't know what happened but I was moving around I think eyes by Shannon are thoughts by I don't know what happened but as every way and and you I remember opening my at some point and I looked around and I saw you beautiful people and I thought wow Lord this is this most incredible lover cannot even explain it I try trying to explain it to my dad and I couldn't you can't explain it and I thought right now I could walk up there right now and sing to everyone I have no fear whatsoever no fear and when I realized that something said that's it you see he takes away all of that like and I also realized that's why you had it before to realize how how God can change and it's not me it's completely the Lord the fact that I felt such freedom and peace can only be God because I know what a stronghold that had on me that feeling of not being able like even now like your body my body shakes it takes over you takes on a spirit but at that moment I had none of that I felt like I could go do any one which is probably why I was all over the show and just be with the it just testify and sing and praise and yeah it was incredible um there's also another thing that happened a few weeks ago with Caleb and I in the car and talk about it yep yeah I'm gonna talk about it okay so um alcohol wouldn't start and it was on a day when we were just before we were moving I had found lice in my hair which it was a very traumatic event for me and really traumatic um because there was one at what you know people have fears of heights and things that actually make your body shake like I had a fear of lice like that which the Lord is not there with me from - but it was a really Truman and Matt you know it was big for me that and there was lots of little things that were happening on that day we quickly got in the car now we needed to go to the next place and the battery wouldn't start I've had many flat batteries before guys and I realized oh and any of you been to our heart or our old house you know you can't just get in and out of the driveway it's very difficult in the way I had parked you wouldn't be able to pull a car up next to us so I thought how we how we're going to do this come and try and get the car out because of the angle of the COTS too difficult and Caleb said let's pray I really don't feel like praying but no I'm a bit upset and I closed my eyes and I and he put his arm around me and he started praying and he said in Jesus name this call was stopped and I remember usually he kept his arm on me and I open my eyes and I just said still but it felt like time froze again that same I don't know and then all of a sudden it felt like there was this pressure in the car and Caleb said stop the car now I put in the keys perfect started perfectly listen we started shouting and screaming and crying and and he said it was such a testimony for Caleb because he had never experienced God acting immediately on a situation instantly and it was the most incredible incredible experience and the testimony of that is that yes the Lord started the car but the big thing that I feel like I want to leave with you guys too is sometimes God puts you through difficult situations so that when he does deliver you you realize what a miracle it is because I right at that moment again I thought I have had so many flat batteries thank you Lord because if I hadn't had them I know that there's absolutely no ways I would have known what a miracle it was for that car to start and y'all just wanna leave you with that [Applause] anybody asked got a testimony well the week before we went to camp we had a little I had a little altercation with what other parents at my preschool and they knew it was out of sorts for me so work told me to stand down for a week so because I was under too much pressure because we have got a lot of sick kids in our room and changing staff and all this sort of got on top of me so things weren't going to good and so I had to go for two meetings with the boss in the bigger boss and sister Robin came with me just to be my support person so when I got to camp it was like God open the gift lead gates and just let everything go and when I got back when I got back on Monday I did a meeting with that Tuesday I didn't meet have a meeting with the parents and they were going we weren't concerned about our child that was yeah we're concerned about now it's gone oh my goodness all this blew up just because they were concerned about me and I was going they didn't cure lord [Applause] leading up to the camp two or three weeks it was just so stressful but go through that so many things in can't just so many things but one thing that stood out to me was us to do ease and so many years gone but they has to be in this time assist ahead to you Jemima you know and I was just so DJing I just thank the Lord for that I don't ever want you to say this about you know maryam when she took the tambourine and ahmadiyya man said a demon said sing yet to the lord for he had triumphed gloriously the horse and his rider had he thrown into the sea and also there was one thing that i also wanted to say was i usually go to the khemsa myself i always have something that I went from the Lord when I go to the camps but I said no Lord I just want to go for others I want to shoulder in trail with others so when I went to the camp and I've lived that at his feet but when I went to the camp all these people started to come to me and I said thank you Lord because then I could pray for them and enter in and I was so thankful he's done so many amazing things go bless your Saints it's good to be here about a year ago I made a trip to buy a new vehicle and my aunt it was like do you want to come to church Charlie come to church no no no it's only get home some of you know I just want to thank the Lord for some of my vehicle and bringing me here little did I know I'd be fellowshiping in this church a year later did it move down here to stay here but um God's just blessing you richly and another thing I really like to thank the Lord for was um probably card rates being about my metals we all have mind battles every single one of us everyday we've got a voice in our head in us the white dog and the black dog and it's not until I just want to thank God for the scripture that he gave us saying that their mind is for God but until we just surrender everything doesn't matter how big how small but as soon as we surrender that to him and give him praise no matter how bad or how good the situation my brother being spent speaking praise Lord we're going through the wringer as soon as you give that to him the whole situation will change no matter what every time will change but you've just got to realize what it is and praise the Lord for it yeah sort of Lord for everything he's doing for me um I just actually there's just a little testimony just happened right then well brother Ben was speaking I prayed to the Lord well if I'm supposed to give a testimony I just pray that brother James will turn around and look at me so he did I some - for my kids I went to Kemp for my children I had a very strong burden for my oldest - I prayed that that they would have an experience with God while they were there I don't know to what extent God touched them but I think brother kuben for moving them up the front I think that sometimes it's good to get away from them um so they can be freer amongst other Christians amongst their peers I know that I was praying one evening I saw people going up for prayer and I could see Dimitri from where I was sitting and I just prayed that he would go out for prayer just that the Lord would touch him he did so praise God and I also prayed for a wonderful experience for Thema just that she could have fun with friends and end Christians just to have a real blistered time in the Lord and she was one of that group that stayed up till 3 a.m. singing so crazy I just want to I just want to quickly add to that testimony their payment might not like me for this but and we've got this on video footage so after the Sunday night we were watching the video footage that Nadine was taking and we were singing that song my god deliver Daniel and we were singing this song quite probably at least half an hour it was probably more than half an hour and we had been round the circle and now some people were like I've got one I've got one my god delivered whoever it was and Jamie I was sitting outside of the group off to the side with some of the other young ones and I had kept seeing as she was looking over like I want to be a part of this because Hannah was over here and that was just so much going on and so Andy's facing towards me and taking those behind them and Andy I go and I got one and just as he's going like this time that gets up and starts walking over to the table my god delivered Taemin and time oh it's just something where you watch somebody else like praise the Lord we've got the proof [Music] yeah I've got one as well I usually go to camps and I think man this is awesome and this time I kind of went for myself so before camp I was struggling with with some things but when their mind battles you don't know if it's you or whether it's real there's always that doubt all this could actually be real and um I'm quite an emotional person and I wear my heart on my sleeve and I'm also the my love language is encouraging words so when things quite affect me by words then they shouldn't but um they do and so I'm when I started seeing but I loved most um not going as you plan that you think it should go the way I don't know I won't go into detail anyways um you just question you question lots of things and and so before camp there was a lot of those questions those doubts those feelings they they bring other things with them and that kind of like what brother Claude did you let those weeds grow and they'll turn into trees and it was awesome because I went through it I'm so thankful for the Lord for trials because I heard him speaking one time about the butterfly that there's a cocoon there's a trial you're in and if you try to scratch your way out or someone tries to do it for you then you won't be that butterfly at the end you'll know you'll die in the cocoon but those trials are for us to get out and spread our wings and so it's so important in the Lord's timing it will happen and so I'm so thankful for the trial and going in I thought man Lord I can't get past this as is taking over my whole life I'm not even the same person because I know I had experience with the Lord and you know I wasn't I haven't been this like who I originally was in the Lord for Doctor Who nap years but um and um I um going into it I said I said Lord all I need is perfect love because I was reading the testimony of God be how brother branham went beyond the curtain of time and he said man there won't be anything like this there won't be all he named all the things that aren't of God he said they won't be there and and I said that's all I need Lord I just need perfect love and so I went to the camp and and then but I didn't know what I was actually struggling with anyway so I went to the camp and I'm and then the fruit and then I thought I got the the victory and I thought you know I've got the tools so I can be able to combat this thing you know in my mind cuz I'll wake up with thoughts in my head just and you know brother Brennan talks about that he sees that vision of the guy pounding the woman that's how I felt like like I'd wake up and here's this guy going you're no good you're not a good mom you're not a good wife you know you just come to me over and over after a while you start to believe it and I'm in and you think it's real and you get to a place like you know you like off you know not even being around quite interesting because I'm thankful I went through it because I realized like a teenager's life they go through such a change in their body that Satan will try to pound them right at that time anyway so I went through and then I thought and then after that if the thoughts kept the next morning on Sunday morning and I said Lord I can't I can't do this I can't do it in my own strength and I remember I listened to brother Brigham sermon that said he the brother had a dream and the God God give him work to do and he pound the tree you know and he was supposed to chop a tree and take the logs do you remember that story somewhere but the guy said I can't do it I don't have the strength to do it so he says if God told him put the tree in the put the log in the river and just ride the river and so I was like oh Lord I could I don't have the strength I've let it grown up it's my own fault but lord I can't I can't battle this anyway so he um that night at service oh my goodness I realized what it was because I've we've experienced it before at camp say when that that that's a real feeling of heaven I realized that's perfect love perfect love came down and nothing can get like Satan cannot what fear cannot dwell in perfect love that's what we experienced perfect love just fell over everyone in the whole camp at that time it was amazing it's like we don't have to fear Satan has no print when that perfect love comes it flees everything else please and so I was like oh you know you're in that atmosphere and then I said oh lord if I just need something else if I need prayer for this if I need deliverance more something more than me can you please have this is at the end of service have prided riggs come back where he was kind of standing because he was all over that you you know he was all over the place and then I said and I'll go up for prayer cuz I'll know it's you having me wanting to go for prayer so he did he went back to the spot and I went back and Melissa was there and she said oh I really like to go to for prayer I'm like praise the Lord me too let's go together so we went for prayer and this is at the closing of the meeting and so they've just got someone else to pray for the closing of the meeting and then we're stuck kind of like oh we're already asking brother contradicts to pray for us and so um Melissa told her what she wanted she hurt but he she wanted him to pray for as well before and then and then so he starts praying but I couldn't tell him what I wanted prayer for either because we had already started praying anyway so he then starts praying for me and he prayed for mine battles I didn't mean but it was just so amazing was right to the just directly this man that had no idea who I was what I was doing there just directly was God through and praying for me I'm sorry but it was so important that he didn't know what I needed prayer for because then I could say oh yeah that's the mind battle that wasn't me that wasn't anything else and so then he pretend then the next morning I did not have any thought that I was going right oh oh oh and well we are sitting there after I got prayed for the brother that was closing the prayer set and we can take it into our our hall our dormitories with us it doesn't have to stop so anyways my heart's cry was like do it again Lord do it again do it again for us so then I found myself in the the dining hall with these all these musicians and people like to sing young people and I'm like um for hours we're just sitting around looking at each other and scene and I'm like in reality I would get quite uncomfortable with that I'm like man this is awesome and then they sung this song which means so much to me and and I just could not sit down and if you know this song and you know the battles that I've been going through and what the Lord showed me I know who I am what he says I am where he says I'm a cuz I know anyways I couldn't hold still and my skirt but by this time for a while it's been losing its elastic I know I can just couldn't stop like I was dancing in front of everybody I'm like and then I that night when I went back into my room I'm like okay that was a bit embarrassing that's like I was the only one but his presence was so strong and before that we're like I wonder what it's like to dance in the spirit but then I realize that night I was like when the twin the spirit wouldn't when you I felt like David Mann when the art comes in and you're like know who I am I know Wyatt with me at the battle Oh in anyways yes so the victory and I know I got the victory because this week of course Satan tried to come to me and someone said to me a very hurtful thing and if you know what I was battling with it didn't help so it was like something really hurtful to me but it was like water off a duck's back [Applause] know who I am and then and then I got mad at the devil I'm like shut up devil shut up get back to where you go you're onto my feet and then we had that love I'm like that's not that person that's the devil joining come on attack me but so it's like the Lord gave me that bat that Satan was hitting me with man now I've got it and yes oh it's such a blessing when you feel powered when you know who you are and then oh just testimony of then then we took that to the sports day and Joe and I were just rejoicing and speaking about what the Lord was doing and then we prayed a prayer and said Lord speak to all these young people here so a seed in their heart and then the coach starts talking about the Bible and God and then I just felt like that bat God and he knows like we've got the victory and it man that song has just been ministering to me so I was it was awesome it was an awesome camp and it was just all God is so so good and I'm so glad to be his [Applause] it was actually one thing I wanted to share was you know like when you see other people rejoice and it touches you so much and we were going through the deans video and that song come on I know who I am and the Nadine had the video going and shared it with the edges straight up like a spring and it was like there and it's just so cool to see I and that was how I was like she's acting out how I felt it's always found myself for the guitar or something and I was like man I just want to dance I didn't even know how to dance amen praise God [Music] maybe we could just ask brother Ben to stand up stand up [Music] all of these testimonies that you have just told will have not of even they know would have been told if it wasn't for brother being making this having a desire in his heart to start this church we was sharing with me last night and he made a choice brother car drivers talking about a decision brother Ben made a decision and from that decision we've all been so blessed [Music] now what we'll call rather be an app that what song to sing I got so many songs here that I just felt blessed from and I just I just don't even know

thank you musicians amen praise the Lord hallelujah Amy I think the Lord camp was tremendous I mean so I emailed brother Dwayne Lawson last week and the day after I emailed me said lord willing he'll come for next year so I've already so Lord willing already got a guest speaker lined up so praise the Lord just keep that in prayer I mean let's go to let's go to X we're gonna read x2 and we're gonna read from from verse 15 I mean thank you you know love to share you know I love to heal the testimonies you know God did incredible things I'm so glad though we don't have to live off a memory amen we don't need to live off a memory we are walking on amen so this is the Apostle Peter he's speaking after the Holy Ghost has fell there an axe chapter 2 and verse 15 he so he's responding to the people here they say that you know they're all drunken but then he says for these are not drunken as you suppose seeing it is but the third hour of the day but this is that which was spoken by the Prophet Joel and it shall come to pass in the last day say if God I'll pour out my spirit upon all flesh and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy your young men shall see visions and your old men shall dream dreams and on my servants are my handmaidens I'll pour out in those days of my spirit and they shall prophesy and I'll show wonders and heaven above and signs in the earth beneath blood and fire and vapor of smoke Sun shall be turned into darkness and the moon into blood before the Great and notable day of the Lord and it shall come to pass that whosoever shall call on the name of the Lord shall be saved a minute let's go to the book of Romans I'm gonna read from Romans 8 so Romans chapter 8 and we're gonna read yeah if I can we have it here and then we're gonna read read from verse 18 this is for I reckon that the suffering of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory that shall be revealed in us I mean for the earnest expectation of the creature that's creation waiteth for the manifestation of the sons of God for the creature was made subject to vanity not willingly but by reason of him who has subjected the same in hope but the because the creature itself also shall be delivered from the bondage of corruption into the glorious liberty of the children of God for we know that the whole creation groaneth and travaileth and pain and together until now and not only they but ourselves also which have the firstfruits of the Spirit even ourselves groan within ourselves waiting for the adoption to wit the redemption of the body for we are saved by hope now in our hope and the bibles and expectation with pleasure right so it's an expectation for we are saved by hope but hope that is seen is not hope for what a man see is that why does he yet hope for but if we hope for that we see not then do we with patience wait for it amen let's bow our heads and a yo just for prayer gracious Heavenly Father Lord we're so thankful Lord the song we just saying we will walk out of this world victorious because you have won the war father we've seen our names in the end of the book dear God we we see our end destination is dancing on streets of gold Lord when the devil is no more not even a memory we still will be shining as the Sun rejoicing in your presence for eternity and dear God we want to thank you for what you've done just pray father as we now look into your word Lord anchored into our souls rather what you have done and our myths that camp my god father look we want to press the battle want to press on father may we see continue to see with greater clarity who we are on you what you've done for us father we just want to bless your name Lord may you anoint speaker and hearer father may you receive all honor glory and praise in the service Lord and Jesus Christ they may break the bread of life to us for your glory in Jesus name we ask amen amen god bless your friends you may you may have your seats I want to if I can take a subject I want to speak about you know after the fire fell you know we we've had incredible time at camp the fire fowl perfect love was you know I I'm still trying to get my voice back to you know but you know perfect love was there God was there who was perfect love and he did tremendous things but you know we want to I want to look into today you know what happened after the fire fell but why the fire fell you know many of us there wasn't the first time we met the law but here we met him maybe many years ago but he always pours himself into his people because you know we're living in a season where we just read in Romans 8 where you know the creation is groaning and travailing until the manifestation the revelation of the sons of God now we understand that we are already our sons you know we do not become sons by the new birth it says in Galatians because he our sons he says for the spirit where you cry Abba Father so you do not become a son or daughter by the new birth you already were and the reason you were hallelujah and the reason that you receive the Holy Ghost is because you are a son or daughter of God Alleluia but now we are living in a season where we're the full manifestation amen of the bride is here hallelujah you see you know everything Jesus died for us now you know to redeem to purchase amen would be made manifest in a people so brother Branham says in the seed of discrepancy he he makes a statement any he says this is now the seed of God the Word of God Jesus said in a certain places is the word as a seed and every seed will bring forth of its kind and now if the Christian the children of God the children of the kingdom has become the seed of God then they must be the word of God for the word of God manifested in the age that they're living in for the promised seed of that age God gave his word at the beginning and each age has its seed it's times its promises so he's saying that the believers in the age will manifest the promise of the age I mean they'll not manifest something in the past or even in the future they'll manifest the promise for the season hallelujah and now we know we're living in the season of a Jubilee hallelujah and it's not a Jubilee where people can go back into bondage is there's a breaking of the cycle I mean where it's not from being being having a revival and going into death and then revival again but now it's time of just constant revival I mean where that cycle would be broken oh yeah and now we now I just want you know if you don't get anything out of the surface apart from this you're living in the best time I mean you're living in the greatest time I mean we're not living in the dark ages all they could do was give their lives as a sacrifice they are anointed that way we're not living in that day we're living in the best day I mean because everything that is written pertaining to the believer in the word I mean and the message is being manifested in their lives and it's not them doing it it's God in them doing it how Lewis when God said it's a time of Jubilee he's announcing I'm gonna give you a Jubilee I mean when he said the devil's under your feet he says I'm gonna put the devil under your feet I'm it's not you doing it it is God and a season according to his word manifesting it and you hallelujah so that's why it's the greatest time to be alive it doesn't matter how you feel about it you may be shouting you may not be shouting but that doesn't change the fact if God has called you you're part of the promise of this day hallelujah I mean so the children of the kingdom manifest the word for the age that they're alive and hallelujah so you know so it's wonderful so now brother Bernie speaks in peace than the absolute message yeah I want to go through why the first you know saying after the fire fell but when I say why the fire fell because you know you got to see like we we didn't you know we read it an x2 penis is this is that spoken by the Prophet Joel so he identified this vertigo identified that was what was prophecy was now manifested so it wasn't it wasn't something speaking of a future event they were manifesting what was spoken so they could identify what had happened by the scripture so by identifying what happened in the scripture they could see where they were in time hallelujah because we're not just wandering around you know camp camp wasn't because of us camp was because God has a season now my my Brides going to come to her position the club the three of clubs being taken out of the hand of the devil and now the Devils being beaten down by his own lives hallelujah his own Compton nations be put back upon him and now she's a free woman hallelujah so so we've got to see now because we're not in the beginning of the church I meant we're at the end I mean we're not the Alpha bride with the Omega bride hallelujah so now if that be the case then we're going to manifest the prophecy for this day and God's gonna do it remember that's why when emphasized it's God's doing and that's why we can rejoice and worship remember gonna say Lord this is your doing this wasn't orchestrated this wasn't cause of something it was you see I'm gonna come and I'm gonna do this and it doesn't stop at camp it continues on hallelujah because we've got to understand like they like the Apostles I mean they didn't just have God as a memory in the Upper Room after they left I mean the same God that was fell upon them went in them and they did the work hallelujah and then when the devil came against them like the scribes and Pharisees they tried to intimidate them don't preach in his name anymore you know don't speak about him no more and they just asked the question should we please man or God you tell us they made the supernatural God holy are they when you're they made the eternal one and the eternal one wasn't just with them he was now in them and now they're looking at them saying what should we do now should we please your God you tell and then they went away and they had a prayer meeting and the same one that came down in the upper room came down again and refilled them hallelujah what was God doing God was confirming the work I started I'm continuing Holly you're not walking by excitement you're not walking because you want to your ambition this is me doing it hallelujah and it's the same thing with you and I you know God comes he fills us transforms us the devil tries to push us off the road but God says you're staying on the road hallelujah and then he comes and it fills you again and it confirms his promise with you again supernaturally and all you just say as well Who am I going to please man or God I'm just gonna please God hallelujah that's why in the trial hold on just keep walking just keep walking God and the season will come as we as you heard this morning you'll be thankful you went through it hallelujah Amen so we're gonna be the same way they saw the Apostles saw they were part of that prophecy they were it wasn't just some abstract thing that that that that I Joel spoke they saw they were the fulfillment of that word amen and you've got to see you other fulfillment when the book of Revelation says the bride has made herself ready and to her it was granted that she be arrayed in linen clean and white the Rice's of saints you were to say that's me speaking about when John saw that in symbol for must no longer assemble it to a reality hallelujah so to you it was granted God's in here have my righteousness put it on it's made for you Holly had fits just right hallelujah so she made herself ready but because it's been given to her to be made ready hallelujah maybe you gotta say you're the fulfillment that says let us be glad and rejoice hallelujah we should be rejoiced continue just just read that in the scripture you say feeling down you say I'm actually the fulfillment when God because whenever God prophesized something he knows the person who's going to fulfill the prophecy he knows exactly who it is he knows when they're going to be born Holly doesn't just throw it out there and say well this person matches the most so then they'll do it no he knows exactly he knows exactly who's going to fulfill it I mean when when Joel gave that prophecy God Peter will be standing there and you're the woman at the well would be there you Mary Magdalene would be there can you that Matthew all the 120 he knew would be there hallelujah so when he said the bride has made herself ready he thought of you you can put your name in that scripture that's why the messages gripped you why it's God giving you the wedding garment hallelujah hallelujah so you know we we have to look because you understand if God God has determined he's going to have a bride rising in power taking her position having her god-given rights he's determined that she will be there and you've just got to rejoice saying Lord I'm so thankful I'm living I just happen to be in this season where you want two people to be joint heirs with you you know it's brother cadre said you know everything that Paul prophesied hallelujah we are here to manifest I mean the Webby joint heirs with Christ will be seated in heavenly places in Christ Jesus all condemnation taken away every stain taken away hallelujah it was prophesied in but it's reality now hallelujah and we just happen to fall in this age you say thank you lord thank you snow longer prophesy thank you I'm not looking for a future event sometime I'm here to fulfill it hallelujah incredible moment what a great time to be alive hallelujah now I'm sure you can all relate that before you meet the Lord before you heard this message you're trying to tie your soul to something looking for something to satisfy brother BAM says in the absolute message brother a be quoted it on Thursday he says now every great achievement is tied to an absolute you cannot run life without having an absolute you can't make an achievement without at being an absolute for it's the final tie post it's the hitch rack at the end of the journey it's a place where you're tied to something's at the end of the destination your hitch to it is your tie post it makes you do things when you get a christ-centered life like paul ordinarily you wouldn't do it oh look ordinarily that man trained in all the scriptures and things ordinarily he would have fired line here's trained in but when he when he made Christ as absolute his ultimate then there was a different life he did different he done things crazy to what he once was trained to do and and it'll do the same thing if the church would get away from that council of churches and come back and make God's Word their ultimate make God's Word their ty Post that would do it but they're trying to do a man-made achievement and it's bound to fall well the Bible said they do but there's going to be a bride that's been elected since the foundation of the world that's going to be tied to that ty post and you should say he's talking about me okay I can see eternity break come down down into time since Eden and when it did there was a line of blood all the way up under Calvary and from Calvary tied with this line and it goes on to the typos Jesus and someday when he'll come to claim his own everyone that's tied to that ultimate will be raised up into eternity why they have seen they have been an eternity all the time they are predestinated in eternity they were part of God they're in a sinking at the beginning and when their big rope is pulled of the line of blood that token I was speaking of when it comes up from the earth everyone that is included in that blood will be dropped right back into eternity again but the only way it'll be it'll be tied to that absolute Jesus Christ that's absolutely not an achievement of man but God raised him from the dead and he is an absolute and we know he's alive because here he is with us in the power of his resurrection doing the same thing he did when he is here on earth I'm tied to that ultimate as the end of all strife I'm tied to it that's my life I was a sinner when Christ saved me I met something and since that came and to me it's been different and I'm tied to it everything that I am everything that I am is tied right there and when God is separating his life and let me live in him and he and me now I wonder had me now I want you to understand you know the Lord made a way before there was anything so before there was a foundation well the lamb was slain so God already made a way for his elected ones to come back to him I mean so before there was any molecule any creation the lamb was slain so I'll say before the devil was even made I mean God made an overcoming power to defeat his enemy holy and he tired every one of us predestinate once into that victory hallelujah so now so before the devil was we were victorious in God's mind I mean now now The Devil's here we're victorious holy and then through eternity there will be no more devil but we still will be victorious hallelujah so you remember where the devil comes against you you say I was before you I'll be here with you and I'll be here after you and you won't be here hallelujah amen Pete's got an expiry date and he's going a bit moldy we're going to throw them out hallelujah but we don't the butter but the people of God have no expiry date sure in these bodies but here just to develop character here for God to reveal himself to you amen but there's a part of us that was with God before the foundation of the world hallelujah and and we had represent we have representation in heaven amen so you know we've got to understand we have an absolute we have an ultimate hallelujah amen I remember that ultimate finds you hallelujah Amen so we should just rejoice hallelujah now the fire that fell on Pentecost was a person it wasn't fire wasn't a literal fire that was God the Angel of the covenant that that that led Israel out of Egypt that same one came down divided himself into his church that same one so the same one that led Moses and Joshua was now in his church leading them into a spiritual inheritance hallelujah where once they were they were under the bondage of the devil they were chased by him they were scared whatever more they were enslaved by him now this pillar of fire separate himself unto them and now the devil had to flee from them I mean so now the tables are turned and they had come to their position I meant demonstrating now God was in people once again hallelujah so you remember now the fire fell but what happens after the fire fell hallelujah and maybe I'm gonna jump back and forward but you know that same one that same one that led Israel is now leading the church not a different one you say who was the Associated perfect love was in the room that was the Lord heaven came down you know I was I just couldn't take it how brother cadres preacher says let's go to heaven in such an atmosphere and then he said the door came open up in heaven I think God's presence comes in the room and at his presence for runs and step again it was like too much or so real why is that because it wasn't a man just just being charismatic God anointed that gift he's saying now heavens in the room Polly my presence is half hallelujah whole here now I just love that amen I mean but but we got to understand now the angel of the Lord is here to lead us individually into a body change I mean to the same one that leaders are all there is the same one leading us individually into a rapture hallelujah what I'm so glad you look at the angel of Lord you know we know we know that was God in angelic form so in in him was to be a deliverer I want to see the attributes of God were manifested the attributes and the pillar of fire was manifested at Moses so and God was to be a deliverer he has to be a guide he has to be a shepherd hallelujah all those things were the pillar of fire and then when Moses met the pillar of fire that same one stepped unto Moses and then it when he went to Pharaoh he said now now Pharaoh didn't see the pillar of fire he saw Moses but the pillar files that are speaking out of Moses he said let my people go they weren't Moses people without God's people God was speaking first person through a man and then now God began to manifest this attributes of deliverer I mean through the prophet Moses so he says now and then Pharaoh says no I'm not letting them go he's right fine I'm going to plague your kingdom until you have to let them go and he said plague after plague and he kept us rolling Goshen safe he gave him the shed blood because he's a deliverer I mean so so so he brought judgment on the enemy he brought deliverance to God's children I mean that's all and God was not manifested in a person hallelujah and in the same God and then and then he told you no he told Moses when they go into the Red Sea go this way come this way you know it wasn't them just running as fast as they could out of Egypt God guided them brought them to the Red Sea because God wanted them to see this is really what happens when your enemy is gone hallelujah you know God wants to show us his victory in our lives amen and God wants us to remember what we delivered from that we're still thankful we're still rejoicing hallelujah say well it's been years since I've been set free but you're set free hallelujah so they came to the Red Sea amen God led them down there the children of Israel begin to panic even Moses said and God uses way crying unto me I'm gonna show my deliverance here speak and move forward don't crying to me speaking move forward hallelujah so so the Red Sea was open Azrael came through fear I couldn't you know you know Egypt couldn't follow well they tried to and they all end up being drowned hallelujah so now God's deliverance was being manifested and you taking I always think about Miriam she is 80 odd years old she picked up a tambourine it wasn't a young sister there was joy sing this is an old one and she began to dance wholly and she began to sing and God came down and known to them and because God wanted them to realize the enemy was dead I mean that the enemy couldn't follow them and they walk to the promised land the enemy was dead hallelujah as the same thing with you and I the enemy tried to follow you to camp he couldn't follow you after camp because he died right there Polly he was defeated right there the mind battles were gone hallelujah the enemy was gone that that's for God why we had a Red Sea experience hallelujah I mean that's why God is not a phrase his devil come devil come to church come to camp devil have a seat devil make yourself welcome but you could end up dead hallelujah hallelujah why is that God manifesting his attributes of deliverer through Moses he was manifesting the life of the pillar of fire hallelujah and then Moses goes off the scene now here's Joshua and Joshua met the same one Moses me but he's got a different part of the ministry he's not there to call them out he's here to take them in hallelujah so now the same one comes down and meets Joshua he says he for us or against us Joshua awesome he says no I'm not for you against you but I come as the kept of the host of Lord so he saying no no I'm not for you against you I've come to take over your battle I mean you are not on I am NOT on your side you're on my side I mean some winner Jesus is not on Eire outside we're on Jesus side he says now I've come to take that over your battle hallelujah and I'm going to place you in your inheritance that was prophesied where you dwell hallelujah I mean you take the 12 tribes of Israel you take the blessings they you're the pay tracts were given those blessings place them in the land so it was prophecy but it wasn't the prophecy doesn't stay prophecy it becomes manifested holiest for now that prophecy was laying there but in the right season hallelujah in the right season now God said no you're not going to stay as slaves anymore because my word must be fulfilled and those and that generation that came out they just know just the right generation hallelujah so now that prophecy became fulfilled under the ministry of Joshua so now God was manifest the attributes of the pillar of fire were being manifested in Joshua's ministry what is it now it's a placing time you're going to receive your inheritance time you're not just going to talk about it and long all the land how will your what's it like how's it going to be no no you're going to dwell in the land you're going to enjoy the fruits of the land wholly and you're going to dwell in peace in your land in your inheritance and that's the H we're living in friends the promised land is the son of man it's the word that's come up and hallelujah we're not just talking about seals of some abstract thing of the book there's abstract thing it's now a living reality holy or now we are now enjoying the fruit of the word hallelujah we are now in our land possessing our inheritance this is the season we're alive ins hallelujah hallelujah brother BAM says in the angel Lord he says I believe that's the same angel of God that let Israel lead Israel out of Egypt to the promised land and the natural is leading us to the promised land today in the spirit he says in my father's house are many mansions I go prepare a place for you and I believe the angel the Lord is leading the church today and it's the same Holy Spirit and anyone knows that the Angel of the covenant was Christ it isn't just to me friend I might be candid and with you but that angel doesn't isn't just to me it's to all of you hallelujah that's why it's so incredible you know God didn't die when brother Brown died that same pillar of fire is the angel Lord watches over the message always so where the word of the day is God is there and there to cause that word to be manifested I mean that's why you just say Lord I take you at your word holy and God will course the word to come to pass it's not us trying to overcome it's not us trying to be a believer here you just take him at his word and he'll anoint it and cause you to live that word it's him doing it that's why now there's such a bad laughter camboriú rejoiced it cam what about everyday life now there's such a battle member the fire foul but now the pressure will come now the intimidation will come just like the just like the Apostles however you got to stand there and say no no no that same God that met me there it's still with me now hallelujah doesn't matter the yo cuz the devil he doesn't want God's life to live he he he wants to disable our faith no matter how great the experience he wants to disable that testimony hallelujah but you've just got to come to a place and say well I'm not going to bow I'm not going to bend I'm not going to burn I'm going to stand no matter what the devil says that me doesn't matter what comes against me I'm going to stand anyway hallelujah but the amazing thing is even if we fall this blood I mean there's an intercessor standing in our place hallelujah only we have a perfect lamb there in our place though we fall member I think brother James hid it last night a mighty warrior doesn't just fall he gets up it's the one that gets up it's his Lord try me one more time hallelujah hallelujah see it's counted and with you but that angel of sorts to all of you and he's here right now he's right in the building I filled it right now and I know that that angel that same Angela I'm speaking up here isn't five feet from me right now and when I meet you the judgment bar and this night is called in to order see if I haven't told you the truth he is right in here now hallelujah that same God is present he says in persevering he says and now if that be the angel lord leading these people it will produce the same thing that it did when he was manifested in the true son of God it'll do the same thing in the adopted sons of God you take now coming to the new teaser I said about Moses and Joshua he taking the Lord Jesus the fullness of God here body was in him hey hallelujah everything that could be named had to bow every demon had to be cast down everything had to be defeated and they know that same God so that was God as as a higher form of deliverer just from physical slavery now that heals the deliverer from from from sin from death from unbelief holier because now we're was dead traced by the sins but we've been quickened to life hallelujah so we're not just freed from a physical slave master I mean we've been we've been freed from the slave master the true one which is the devil which is and hallelujah see he says and it'll produce the same thing it did when it was manifested in the true son of God we'll do the same thing in the adopted sons of God I mean it's why you read through the book of Acts Devils will cast out the demons were defeated religious spirits were defeated why because what was manifested and the Sun is now manifested in the bride amen it'll do the same thing in the adopted sons of God for jesus said the works that I do shall you do also if his life is in US it'll produce the same hallelujah it will produce the same amen and if it does something contrary to Scripture then it's not the same angel but if it produced the same life that it was when it was here on earth manifested in flesh and promised to be manifested again in the same way then is the same spirit same God by the same word see what I mean now then you can base your faith that it's the truth and of the tens of thousands of visions around the world I'll ask anyone at anytime to show me already ever failed it doesn't fail it cannot well hallelujah was the same God now brother Brad would speak now now I want to go so I'm kind of jumping back and forth I want to go to why the fire fell again now we understand a few you know the first coming of Christ is a forerunner John the Baptist who introduced the people to the Messiah the word manifested and that produced a true Pentecost that's the pattern amen so now we're living in a day we'll have had a four-runner come he introduced us to the word the Messiah Jesus Christ and that has produced a true Pentecost to the bride it means that's why we can see because we've been restored back to the original faith of the fathers that's why when you read the book of actually so actually I've seen that happen I've seen that life manifested and when you read when when the Apostle Paul's describing like charity how its long-suffering is kind you know it doesn't rejoice in iniquity you know that's divine love you actually see actually that nature's in me hallelujah because he's describing the life is now in you amen so so what and and so that is from what a true Pentecost how this or the bride and and and I'm sure you could just say well you're just describing my experience we have had a true Pentecost I mean we're enjoying a true Liberty hallelujah so so he says in the Pergamon church age he says now and he says I want you to be very careful here and see this God has promised it at the end time Malachi 4 is going to be fulfilled it has to be four it's the the spirit quickened Word of God spoken by the Prophet Malachi Jesus referred to it it was just before Christ comes the second time by the time Jesus comes all scripture must be fulfilled the Gentile dispensation will be in its last church age when that messenger of Malachi comes he will be right with the word he will take the whole Bible from Genesis to Revelation he will start at the serpent seed and carry on to the messenger in the latter rain so I'm gonna pick up on that later but but notice he says and he'll carry co-star from the serpent seed and they will continue on to the messenger in the latter rain now who's the me during the letter rain that's Jesus Christ himself right so you start at 7:00 seeker all the way to the message so so what do you'll do you start at 7:00 see the original sin you go all the way until finally he introduces Christ to the people in the latter rain I'm gonna go into that soon he says but he'll be rejected by the denominations he has to be for that as history repeating itself from the time of a hab Israel's history under a hab is happening right here in America whether we're the prophet of Malachi appears as Israel left Egypt to worship and freedom pushes out the natives rises up a nation with great leaders like David etc and then putting a have on the throne with the Jezebel behind them to direct so have we done the very same in America our forefathers left this land to worship and live and freedom they push back the natives took over the land mighty men like Washington and Lincoln were raised up but after a while other men of such poor caliber succeed these worthy men that Sooners and a hab that was sit in the presidential chair with the Jezebel behind him to direct them as in such a time as this that the messenger of Malachi must come then in the latter rain will come a Mount Carmel showdown watch this carefully now to see it and the word John was a forerunner of Malachi 3 he planted the full former rain and was rejected by the organizations of his day Jesus came and had a Mount Transfiguration showdown the second forerunner of Christ will sow for the latter rain Jesus will be the showdown between the Dunn denominations and Creed's for he will come to back up his word and take his bride in the rapture the first showdown was Mount Carmel the second was about Transfiguration and the third will be Mount Zion and that's the bride that's a showed us of God so Jesus will come and he will he will back up amen he will back up his word and take his bride in a rapture now so I spoke there about you know how he'll he'll carry on to the messenger in the latter rain now let's go to the book of Joel because we're going to just we're going to continue up from where where Peter was referring to we're just going to read from verse so Sauron we're in Joel 2 and we're going to read from verse twin one weird such a great time we're in the man we're in a good time hallelujah remember this is the Lord's doing this is the Lord's doing it's not any man's doing this is God says no this is the season I'm gonna gather my seed which is part of my word and they will manifest the promise of the day and that's why you feel the pull you do I mean that's why you feel the pull you do because God's wanting you to see you're part of my word you are the prophecy of Spago as manifested in you hallelujah so he sits in Joel 2 and 21 he says fear not o land be glad and rejoice for the Lord will do great things hallelujah hello Linda fear not be not afraid ye beast of the field for the pastures the wilderness to spring for the tree birth her fruit the fig tree and the vineyard yield their strength be glad then you children of Zion and rejoice in the Lord your God for he hath given you the former rain moderately and he will cause to come down for you the rain the former rain and the latter rain in the first month and the floors shall be full of wheat and the fat shall overflow with wine and oil let's just let's just stop there for a bit so saying that he will give us the former rain moderately and he'll cause to come down for you the rain the former rain and the latter rain and the first month now this this former rain if you look into the Hebrew it means a teaching rain or the early rain I mean so so brother bear as he said in this but spoken words the original seed he said now that Billy Graham and all robots have sowed for the World Council of Churches and they have but then he said that the evening messenger will show for the bride and he has holy that's why that's why the word that you hear gathers you to one or two places either it will bind you with the tears which has happened or it will gather you into the garner but it all depends on what seed you are I'm in the condition of we you're gathered to us based on the seed you are but remember you know all that country or no wise cast out because what does the devil attack who you are oh you think you're a Christian you think you're part of the Bride you really think you know what is he attacking attacking who you are the devil will never tell you you got to make it I believe you'll take a rapture oh I just I just can't do nothing to you he will never tell you those things he always say do ya yeah it's like if thou be the Son of God if they'll be and the thing is you don't need to prove anything to the devil I mean because remember when when Jesus were he received the Holy Ghost he goes into the wilderness right and then the devil tries to get him to use his anointing I mean for his bidding for the devil's bidding if thou be the Son of God turn these stones into bread he's trying to get the Son of God to follow the devil's leadership I mean but that is never that was never the purpose of God abiding in him he says now I've come to do the Father's will I mean so the Father's will wasn't the clown for the devil hallelujah and so the devil comes ucsf they'll be the Bride of Christ if they'll be will this wouldn't be this way and change this and fix this no no you don't need to clown for the devil you don't need to answer his accusations amen our husband is the one who answers the accusations the Word of God silences the devil honey you don't need to climb from you don't need to try and back up anything God does the backing up hallelujah he's the one who does the backing up a mess is like Moses when when Koren dayson came against them you know you say you're the only holy one God says if I just separate yourself you don't need to debate you don't need to argue amen and then Moses system if God does a new thing and opens up the earth swallows you up he'll show you who's on whose side Moses didn't do anything God did it and the world the earth swallowed them up hallelujah God does the backing up sometimes we think why aren't you why aren't you backing me up God he's backing you up but he has to faith has to be tested right and faith worketh patience say Lord you called me in the beginning you called me for a purpose member this message is a bridegroom call and the bridegroom callers to it to a marriage parlor it's not just a general blanket call though it's two individuals why'd he go to the woman the well he didn't say well I want to go to Samaria you know he said he says I have reason to and those for her else for the one of the well it wasn't just for everyone he didn't just work our maybe that's an open place maybe I'll preach here maybe I'll said no he went to that well for her hallelujah and that's why the wood came your way for you not for just everyone there's elected group upon the earth I mean and the reason that this message is spoken to you is because he's saying you're mine you're part of me you're not part of the devil you're not part of this world you're part of me and I want you to recognize your identity is in me the living word it's not in anything else that's why you don't fit nowhere else holy that's why he said I don't fit anything else that says God is trying to get you you belong to me I died for you on Calvary I took care of your son I took care of your shame I took care of your guilt I mean just rejoice and just accept it hallelujah he took care of it remember even before there was a devil the the lamb was slain before the foundation of the world hallelujah so that's why I came because it's a bridegroom call there's a reason he doesn't just want you to be excited he just doesn't want you to just get religious noises I'm here to meet you and not just me you and leave you I'm here to walk with you every step of the journey though you may not feel me I'm there hallelujah because remember this walk of faith isn't just a waste cloud dine rejoicing some people say I wish we could just camp you know your have camp all the time that would be glorious but there's no overcoming and character development at camp right God pours himself out the fire falls he consumes the sacrifice we have a Jubilee witnesses now just walk now walk and I'll prove myself in your everyday life I mean when you don't have the answers you know another way to go I'll show you hallelujah I mean that's why we've just got a we just got to walk with God when you're rejoicing when you're not rejoicing don't go by how you feel the devil you know this world is a supercharged on emotion everything pander to the flesh but God says no that's not faith doesn't work by emotion sure you be you can compute become emotional but don't be condemned because you don't feel anything but don't be you know just just walk with God your faith is not by turn your emotion your faith is because God gave you faith God reveal themselves you God called you out faith is a revelation hey it's not trying to work something out you know it's there I mean it's just like we went to Eastbourne you say had Peter and the South Island you couldn't see it but we've seen it amen if you were taught the South Island Z you'd maybe doubt because you couldn't see anything but if you've seen it it's been revealed you know it's there holy but if you've been taught you say well are you Toby it was there I don't see it there yeah that's not faith faith as you know it's there irrespective if you see it or not hallelujah amen so now he says that the former and latter rain will run together this what we read okay so it's just like brother had seen spoken where the original seed he says Billy Graham or Robert sowed for the World Council of Churches it's happened the evening messenger Malachi for will so for the bride and it's happened hallelujah so now that that form of rain has fallen B says that the former and the latter rain will run together and this latter rain is the harvest rain it's the quickening rain hallelujah so now we are living so now we are living in a time where the formulator rain are running together I mean that's why you know I was sitting at camp and I don't know if the I don't know what service was are sitting in the back and I don't know if there's the right word by saying this message is evolving not in changing to something different it's the same word but even if you go back like brother Han do you think of the first convention we went to it was wonderful but it wasn't compared to that one because it's a different season it's not because the speaker is better or the world no it's a different season with God as God is pouring himself out in a greater way because he's getting his people ready I mean hallelujah for a body change and you just happen to be living in the season and God and why was Kemper why was camp such a blessing because you were there you individually were there that's what that's why God poured himself it wasn't easy for someone else it was for you individually hallelujah so the former rain and the latter rain are running here is the quickening rain so he says now because that's why I said so he'll start with he will start with the serpent seed and Genesis go from Revelation and then he will carry on them to the messenger in the latter rain so that message on the letter eNOS Christ Himself coming to the bride to give her a rapture in faith so he says but he'll be rejected by desire by so now he says then and the latter rain will come a Mount Carmel showdown I'm sorry I've read that and we keep going down the same crisis but what about the true seed it will happen just as we have said the people of God are being made ready by the word of truth from the messenger to this age I mean why cause we've been restored back to original Pentecost this message is Jesus Christ the Messiah when the word has manifested that is Messiah to the aged just like Noah Noah's message was the Messiah their age it was the Word made manifest he was told build a boat everyone gets in the boat though they'll receive salvation I mean why cause that word was the Messiah to the age where Moses came down into Egypt the people that followed that message what it was the Messiah the deliverer the savior to them of that age hallelujah Jesus is the Messiah I mean all the way down through the church age but it says the word as he is the word and when the word is manifested that is the Messiah to the age and so I want to receive Jesus receive the word I mean cuz we Greeks remember he's not a man of Galilee no more he is the Living Word amen and this message is the Word of God hallelujah that's why there's all the supernatural you hear the prayer lines God is saying this is me speaking this is me speaking this is me speaking hallelujah so we have confidence it's him speaking Amen so so the people of God are being made ready by the word of truth from the messenger of this age and her will be the fullness of Pentecost for the Spirit will bring the people right back to where they were at the beginning that is thus saith the Lord it is thus saith the Lord for what we read in Joel 2 23 to 26 be glad then you children of Zion and rejoice in the Lord your God for he has given you the former rain moderately and he will cause to come down to you come down to you the rain the former rain and the latter rain in the first month and the floor shall be full of wheat and the that shall overflow with oil with wine and oil why do you think they you know the word gets her rich way the fats overflowing the floors are full of wheat Polly we we're not just having a little lettuce leaf trying to get by now we've got a buffet I mean boy it's the Lord's doing the wood comes open where it's not some abstract egg no more it's tangible it's real it's applicable it's living hallelujah see we're just living in this day oh yeah I'm glad amen and I'll restore to you the years of the locust has eaten the cankerworm the the caterpillar and the Palmer worm my great army which I send among you and you shall eat and plenty and be satisfied thank you Lord and and praise the name of the Lord your God who has dealt wondrously with you and my people shall never be ashamed now it says God is going to restore the Lutheran age did not restore the church at started a Reformation the reason an age did not restore the Pentecostal age did not restore but God has to restore for he cannot deny his word this is not the reason Rick's of the church it is the restoration God will take the church right back to Pentecost at the beginning now notice in verse 25 it tells why we need a restoration the the locust cankerworm caterpillar and palm worm have eaten all but the root and but a small bit of the stem now we are told that all these insects are all one and the same in different stages that is right they are the Antichrist spirit manifests in an organization denomination and false doctrines through the through the ages and that poor little root and stalk is going to be restored God isn't going to plan a new church that's going to bring his original planting back to original seed he's he's doing it as it started in verse 23 for by the teaching of former rain next will come the harvest or rapturing faith he says and those things are running together hallelujah this just happens to be where you are I mean were wise God pouring out his spirit way he's giving us rapturing faith I mean the things that we hear they're teaching we hear a min is now that later rain is coming on top of us is not its quickened and it's brought the harvest as we here it that's why God does such a quick work in people's life in these days why cuz he's bringing the whole harvest up to maturity hallelujah I mean some people they've been in the message forty years has taken them forty years for someone who's been in a year to come to the same stage why cause it's God's doing it's not our doing it's not because people are smarter now no dumber back then no it's God's doing hallelujah he's bringing heat because he is bringing a restoration because he wants his bride to be mature once we made in his image hallelujah now we he sees in Christ and miss you God revealed he says there has to be a message at the end time where there is nothing else can follow what the fruit is in the top of the tree and the light is shining on that predestinated fruit and she is ripening into christ-like fruit so saying now we're living in a harvest season hallelujah Edna and the fruit ripens on the top of the tree because the light shining on it it's not the tree deciding I'm sick of winter I'm going to I'm going to bring forth fruit no it's the conditions of the season come right and in the life that's in the tree comes forth as fruit and we turn now we're living in a harvest season right we're living in a time where now fruit is coming out why because the sun's come to a certain height in the sky the soil temperatures no longer I see is now the right and now the life is coming back it was hidden in the trunk during the winter now comes forth how it doesn't just doesn't just grow leaves a fellowship but now a fruit is coming under those leaves of fellowship hallelujah and that is the season that we're living in you just happen to be alive during this time hallelujah hallelujah so this is God's doing you'll see because you understand if we're living in a time full restoration we shouldn't sit back for a partial restoration amen we shouldn't acetal back well I've got a little bit of victory I've got a little bit of joy but the devil's work in this part of my life not oh you should keep pressing in until God gives you all hallelujah that's that's what we need to do amen because because we don't want to live below our privileges we have god-given proof and we should live according to those privileges hallelujah they say no what do I do after the fire has fallen feed your experience brother cadre see them feed your experience don't go back into your old habits he had before feed on the Word of God the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost feeds on the Word of God I mean you want to be strong in the inner man feed on the word of God listen to the right kind of music listen to the right kind of messages make this your daily diet Amen no seriously it's what you got to do hallelujah it's like a trees got a drink and it pushes out and it always drinks more than it's a lot of portion to push out a new limb it means to say Lord I want to see you live give him something to work with because the life is in here I mean you say just feed on the word and you'll find a limb go push out I mean so you'll be feeding on the word joy pushes out I mean you'll be free again long-suffering pushes out temperance pushes out you see this life pushing out Holly wants here because you're drinking you're feeding on the Word of God and the life and you just pushes out hallelujah so keep keep feeding on the word this value the devil you're the devil never tells you you should read the Bible when was the last time you read it where was the last time you prayed you should pray I thank you mr. devil yes I'll take that boy no here is this yeah your promise he says there's no point did you get anything it's not what you remember did you catch what he is saying in their message it's not what you remember you're feeding the inner man you're feeding this guy you're not feeding this guy right so just feed on the word read listen pray sing the right car yesyes sing spiritual Psalms sing a melody in your heart was that creating a right atmosphere the devil the devil always gives us trouble and worry and stress he never gives us peace but he wants us to be all caught up in things and worrying about things remember worry never helped anyone faith can deliver worry never delivers so don't worry about it turn your worries into prayer turn your burdens into prayer father turn your frustrations into prayer because remember we're God's workmanship member before there was a worry there was a lamb before there was strife and stress there was a lamb and before there was trouble there was a blood highly and their blood was shed in the mind of God before you ever had a worry hallelujah so you know God's not going to kick us out because we got worried or mind battles he knew we would have these things but he already provided a lamb before the battle he already provided a victory before the fight hallelujah so just keep walking with God don't be intimidated by nothing I meant just like brother cadre city you know someone's got a problem with you and you avoid them you're actually giving them charge over you and it's like anything in this world comes in a timid age he tries to attack you don't let it rule you I mean let the word of God rule you don't be intimidated by nothing although the devil does all kinds of things don't worry about it just keep walking with God hallelujah feed on the Word of God amen and just keep walking you say well I didn't get anything out of it you'll find you'll find you say well I didn't get anything out of that and then you're walking with God and then that would just comes forth when you have need of it you know it's like brother Baron speaks about people and your own army training you'll put a big pack on carry all these things and many of the recruits they don't know the purpose of it and they're trying to crawl under a machine gun and the machine guns trained a certain height it doesn't shoot any lower they're doing all this training he says no but but they will think they're drill sergeants when they're on the battlefield and they actually have to put those tools into practice that training into progress they would have hated the drill sergeant when they're in training but they would have thanked them when they're fighting in the battlefield I mean so many times we say what's the point of remembering this what's the point of listening a break you'll need that equipment one day I mean we're in urina battle hallelujah then comes that scripture then comes that quote then comes that song and you can use it hallelujah amen to fight whatever you're going through and you'll say it was worth it listening to that message it was worth it singing our songs it was worth reading the word hallelujah just keep pressing on friends keep pressing on I remember the God that made us at camp is the same God here he'll be the same God tomorrow he said I'll never leave thee nor forsake thee Hollis you didn't leave we didn't leave our lakes the reason he is here is because we went there hallelujah and now we've come now he's here and you gone to your everyday life he's present I'll be with you at school I'll be with you your job I was in your home I'll be with you on the street wherever you are I'll be with you hallelujah so just keep walking with God the fire is fallen now that and the devil doesn't want that life to spread they meant they didn't stay in the upper room God fell fell no filled them up they didn't say and then just had a rejoice they went out the life spread hallelujah and now here we are the fire fell I say tell someone about it Amen testify do as you feel lid hid the life spread hallelujah and let's just walk on God bless you friends quit the musicians please amen I mean can we sing that song I know who I am because of what he says I am he had the sickness brother James I merely stand shall we and there's some before we sing this how about let's just pray and a man who's glad to be a Christian I mean
