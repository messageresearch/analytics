========================================

[Music] what [Music] what [Music] good morning praise the Lord It's good to uh be here again we were just discussing uh little microphone things and sound things and stuff like that and then we oh that I was just discussing that with brother admand and then our closing sort of remarks were to keep in mind that we're dealing with first world problems here you know there was a time when none of this existed and people people gathered in a field somewhere and someone just preached and they just sang and clapped sang and clapped you know but we thank the Lord that we have these all these modern conveniences and yet we want to want to always just just always be grateful for every everything that we have you know whether it's that or that we just we're always grateful amen um I wasn't I was huming in hariring wither I tell this little little story but I really only get one chance to say it and that's today otherwise it'll be of no uh importance if I say it next week or the week after because it's sort of time uh relevant I suppose can I say it she doesn't know what I'm going to say should I say it I it will take about three minutes hopefully but it I it's just something maybe maybe you'll get a blessing out of it um I'll say a little statement that that that maybe unusual to say here and then I'll explain why I say it and you'll understand as I go on why why why I've said it um because it's going to sound political but I am happy that Donald Trump won the election now hang on hang on hang on no no no hang on hang on now I'm too spiritual to be political okay you you must I'm not not saying that to distance myself you know when we're immature as a child we think a certain way when we mature to an adult we think differently when we're immature and just look at the world naturally we get all political and think that that's where it's at but when we get spiritual we understand we look at it from another dimension so I don't I cannot get caught up in political things it's it's too it's impossible that it goes through my head right so I couldn't it it doesn't excite me this way or that way the the kingdom of God excites me and the spirit of God working that's what excites me and that's the only thing I can latch on to as reality right but nonetheless I don't know if you people don't really know what I've been through in the last sort of 18 months two years but I've had a genuine I've had multiple genuine Devils whether it be the I don't know if it was the main devil but he's got a whole lot of devils around him that that do his bidding but I've had a genuine demonic attack on me for the last two years to just try and completely take me out like done let's take this guy out once and for all you don't know what I've been through man it's been so hard I've never been through anything as hard in my entire life and on the brink of like he's got me I'm planning my demise you know it's but and I'm not making it up like it's been a specific and I've had this for about 5 or 600 days Relentless one day after the other like no no no Rel Le from this demonic stuff and then every which way right uh earlier in the year I sort of I do just keep up with you know current affairs it actually relaxes my mind and I was watching this guy Trump and I'm watching all the stuff that they're throwing at him and a lot of the times I thought man this guy's gone for all money you know look at this next thing they trying to get him with this and that and that I'm thinking man a there's people out there that don't like them and be there trying to do them over whichever way they can and and yeah and when he was in when it was a point where I thought man this guy's this he's done there's no way out of this the at that point I was I'm going through the same stuff and and the Lord said watch what happens to him what what he's going through is what you're going through and watch his outcome it'll be the same as you so so I'm thinking man I hope this guy doesn't get taken out you know so it made me interested in in in what happened to him and even after that it seemed to get worse I'm like man he's gone and that means I'm gone you know so so then on last Wednesday night we the the the election was on and and I usually drive home cuz Shannon gets you know tired sleep so I drive home on the Wednesday night but I said to her could you could you drive home I want to keep up with this cuz I want to see what happens now she was maybe thinking oh he's worri about the election it's like no it's not I just want to see if he wins I'm good if he loses you know cuz CU he's been through all the stuff and yet and so and I think during that drive on Wednesday night it was it was apparent okay this guy's going to win so I'm like okay and I told Shannon this I hadn't mentioned that I'd had this thing but I said look this is what I have been this is what the Lord showed me a while ago and I just have been wanting to see what the outcome is here cuz that's going to be my outcome and so I told her you know in the end I said I'm going to win man I'm going to win this whole thing and um now we we think yeah we I still got one more thing about it we think oh this is uh this is um you know we get these things from the Lord but but the way the Lord speaks to me there's always got to be something else that makes it a bit more reality for me that I'm not just thinking up this stuff you know you want to tell do you want me to tell you a story about trained little children who who who watches uh who reads the Thomas the Tank Engine books you know the the trains I'll tell you a funny story about trains and then I'll go back to the story Shannon and I go most we haven't me as much lately but we have we've got this running track that we do at home we go from our house and up and it's about 5 km and we go to this train bridge then we run back so couple of KS there and a couple of KS back and and um the train bridge actually the we go on a bridge and we go the bridge goes over the train track so the train comes underneath and I don't know why but it it's just been a thing maybe twice a year CU we run we maybe run 200 times or 250 times maybe something like that you know maybe and two times out of those 200 times there's a or 250 times the train will go under the bridge as we get to the bridge we run there and oh there's a train and you see and you stand on the bridge and it goes underneath you it's just something unusual that happens and I I kind of you watch these things in life and I think it's always like I think when that happens I must have I I I reference it to the Lord maybe I've been what have I been thinking today or something cuz it seems to have just an unusual feel to it I feel like there's something significant when we when we sit there on a train goes under like one day I felt like the Marriotts were going to move here are they here this morning no they're not they and I and I I really felt like Bruce Marriot was going to come here I didn't know how it was going to work but he was going to end up here and it was all going to be all right it was just going to work out that way and then that day when we went running the the train came under the bridge I said Ah that's I told you that's confirmation that's going to happen that certain way does that make any sense it's just the funny thing that I do that the Lord sort of and it's only it usually with things that's just I don't know why the Lord does it but that's the way that he he does it like that you know and I told brother Ben about this I said I think bruces are going to come because the train went under the bridge when I was on top of it think you thought I was crazy you know what are you on brother you know are we believing in trains going under a bridge now you know there our confirmation so we're driving home between here and Lavin of course I'm not running but I'm driving and I don't know of many areas where the train is like this but when you drive on a road you usually drive over the train tracks like physically your car drives over the tracks so if you have an issue where if you have a time where you're on top of the train when that happens you're in big trouble means youit got hit by the train so and the other times the trains go over the road like silver stream there aren't many if you think about it like in this whole region where the train where the where the road goes over and the tranger is underneath I can only think of one in this whole region which is between here and lein yeah that's the only one I can think of and I don't I don't know of many others around the country but in this whole low North Ireland that's probably the only one so we're driving home I'm watching this election and I'm saying that he's going to win and I say to Shan you know what if he wins that means I win I'm this the devil's not going to get me in this one I'm going to win no matter what he throws at me I'm going to win cuz because the Lord said that that's what's going to happen and I'm thinking the strong and we're we're driving back and maybe 5 or 10 minutes after that as we're still discussing it we're driving along and then there starts to be a train following us and then we get up to this train bridge where it goes over the road and and when I'm on top of that train bridge what do you think is underneath me Bear Tracks ah a train I'm driving over this train bridge and there's a train underneath me now I've done that TR about a thousand times 500 times there and back I've never had a train under that bridge when I've been on top of it either you think oh there's nothing to that I don't know I think there is I think the Lord's confirming you're going to win and and I'm going to say that to all of you in any situation you're in if you hold on to the word of God you're going to win you you you cannot lose like like the word of God cannot fail so just walk in faith have no doubt you're going to win everything if you hold on to the word of God it can never ever fail no matter regardless of what am I look like Satan cannot get you you're undefeatable you're undefeatable Sons and

welcome amen great to have you here as always praise God Amen let's uh let's turn to the book of Ephesians uh we're going to go to Ephesians uh chapter 6 we're going to continue on from from Wednesday um all right I can drive this let's just see oh yep we're there okay all right amen so just seeing I can orientate myself up here it's like you know you know like dve d a new car things are slightly different but the same it's kind of like that you know got to kind of adjust and see how things are but praise God we can gather amen amen so Ephesians chapter 6 and verse 10 says finally my brethren be strong in the Lord in the power of His might put on the whole armor of God that you may be able to stand against the Ws of the devil for we wrestle not against flesh and blood but against principalities against Powers against the rulers of the darkness of this world against spiritual wickedness and high places um wherefore take unto you the whole armor of God that you may be able to withstand in the evil day and having done all to stand stand therefore having your loins GT about with truth having on the breastplate of righteousness and your feet shod with the preparation of the gospel of peace above all taking the shield of Faith wherewith ye shall be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked and take the helmet of salvation and the sword of the spirit which is the word of God praying always with all prayer and supplication in the spirit and watching there unto with perseverance and supplication for All Saints amen then we're just going to read one scripture from um first Timothy you don't need to turn we can just read it here it's on the screen but 1 Timothy 1:18 he says this charge I commit unto the son Timothy according to the prophecies which went uh went before on thee that thou might but that by them mightest War a good Warfare holding faith and good and a good conscience which some having put away concerning Faith have made shipwreck amen so let's bow our heads in a word of prayer this morning you want to Remember You Want To Be Remembered in prayer amen let's um you want to raise a hand let's let's talk to the one we love shall we oh Lord Jesus how we love you Lord thank you our hope is in you Lord and thank you Lord it's not an empty hope it's not a it's not a void thing Lord It's a real tangible expectation father because you're a God that fulfills your word Lord we've seen you down Through the Ages and in this day fulfilling your word and you will fulfill the word concerning us we thank you for that father Lord I just pray You' just be glorified in our midst like never before father may you be lifted high high high Lord Jesus high above all our problems and situations Lord may we see everything in perspective this day Lord God father that you are victorious and the devil is defeated and Lord I pray your blood would cover every soul in this place those who are streaming dear God father may you touch each Heart Lord and change us forever Lord we thank you dear God we're still in Victory because you've won the victory for us Lord so we submit ourselves under your Mighty hand forgive us of our sins and our wrongs de God cleanse us of our secret faults and may you be glorified Lord in Jesus Christ's name amen amen God bless you friends you can have your seats this morning so I want to I want to continue on from uh from Wednesday I was talking about the you know we're in this we're in this great battle and and the Apostle Paul when when he would speak about taking the whole armor of God he said above all taking the shield of Faith now he spoke about the other um you know take the helmet and all these things and but but he said above all take the shield of Faith now we need to we need to have an understanding uh how to quench the fiery darts of the enemy now we went over this on Wednesday that it's really the You Know The Enemy um I'm just summarizing then we'll continue on okay so so this is what I'm doing okay so a thought will come a spirit will try and take dominance over your life now it's a fiery Dart now you'll either agree with that and lower your shield and get hit by that fiery Dart or you'll raise up your Shield of Revelation and agree with the Revelation above the D okay so now we're continuing in this thought now it's interesting how how the Apostle Paul would say we wrestle not against flesh and blood now back in the Ephesian age we know that you you the Greek culture was was uh very great under the Roman power and and and they knew what Greek wrestling really was about and so when the Apostle Paul would describe this battle as a wrestling match no doubt their their minds would go to what maybe they had seen with two wrestlers will be wrestling it out and we know wrestling it's not a it's not a distance thing you're you're trying to Grapple your opponent you're trying to find a weak spot maybe you're trying to you know get them in a work them in a certain position then then you can finally pin them but but it it takes strategy it takes time you know it's not a it's not an instant thing but there's a there's a there's a grappling you to you to get hold of your enemy and the enemy wants to get a hold of you and in the Greek times there was one one certain kind of wrestling where where the Victor actually had the right to gouge out the eyes of the loser so they realize now that when they're talking about wrestling this is a serious battle where the enemy wants to pin us down and gudge out our spiritualize that we can see no more this is a serious thing you remember the devil's not playing a game he's not I win let's play again no no he's he he's fighting to destroy but we're fighting to destroy too we're not playing a game amen I mean we're in a real battle but we got to realize that we're wrestling against not flesh and blood but against demon powers and they want to they want to take uh dominion over your life now as we read here in first Timothy that Timothy was told that by the prophecies that went on before him that he by them might fight us fight a good Warfare we're going to realize that we a prophecy has gone before us amen where where John would see the Bride of Jesus Christ in Revelations 19 and there would be a there' be a prophecy of a bride that would be made in the image of the word that would look exactly like him amen that's the prophecy that's gone on before you amen where God sent a message in this end time and when brother Braham saw the preview of the Bride Marching In step with the word he saw you that Vision was a prophecy of your life today amen so by this prophecy we can fight a good Warfare amen so that what is this prophecy you will be victorious amen you'll come out of this age not just surviving but overcoming right and but just like a wrestler a wrestler's got to overcome their opponent right so there's an enemy that wants to pin you on the ground and G you out your eyes but no you're prophesied to gouge his eyes out to pin him on the mat and gudge his eyes out Amen to have a real Victory cuz because the victory Jesus won at Calvary he wants you to be partakers of that Victory and as he knows he's Victorious he wants you to know you're Victorious through him the Lord amen we got to realize that the fiery DTS of the enemy this is this is uh you modern language you could say it's like Vibes it's a spirit that's projecting itself it's not a ay fairy thing it's actually a real thing that wants Dominion now brother R makes a makes a statement in a few places but he says the devil's almost harmless unless he can have something to work in he says you remember those Devils that were cast out of Legion they had they want to do uh some more mischievousness so they wanted to go in them Hogs so the devil must have something to work and somebody to work through so the devil's almost harmless you think about this this this being that thinks he's the king of the world he's the God of this evil age he's made this world like he has the saint in Eden but yet he's almost harmless unless he's got someone to work through so if he's got no one to work through he's almost harmless he's not even you like brother BR one day he woke up and the devil was standing in the corner of his bedroom cackling like a chicken saying I'm going to get you you've got no right with God and he was actually he wasn't afraid he was actually going to wake up his wife and say meet to look at him but then then he thought no that I'll scare her to death so he just rebuked that devil in the name of the Lord and that and and of course he had to leave right because that Devil Couldn't work through the prophet amen he was almost harmless all he could do is threaten right but he couldn't work through him amen and I believe I'm looking at a group of people amen where the devil's almost harmless in their life because we do not give him Avenue to work through us now he may try and he will try because we're human beings right we're just like anyone else but yet by the grace of God a gene seed of predestination we place in our soul amen right but our human makeup we just like any anyone else Hall all right so now he will try so he's almost harmless unless he can get someone to work through now and he and he says he says remember in the Bible when a spirit was cast out of a man they said let us go over into them Hogs they're powerless until they have a place to dwell now I know speak you know I know I can speak for all of us the devil ain't welcome in our lives not even one aota not even one little finger touch he's not welcome anywhere and our private life public life at school our work our job church he ain't welcome the Lord is very welcome the devil's very unwelcome amen so so he is powerless unless he's got a place to dwell now we to realize when when we have all been whether we like it or not we have all been used to fire fiery darts because the devil's got to work through somebody now that doesn't mean we're evil it doesn't mean we're not saved but the devil want if he can get us into a carnal realm then he can start firing shots start getting fired remember because it says in Romans 8:6 for to be kindly minded is death but to be spiritually minded is life and peace amen so when you get annoyed at your brother or sister you're being carnal amen if you just get frustrated at how they are that's carnality you say well then how can I deal with this well you see something that's very human you go to prayer Lord give me wisdom Lord help them touch their life Lord May hold no order against that person because if you start doing that what you're being carnal and then an atmosphere of vibe will go out of you and we'll start to try and drag them down but the whole thing is the devil trying to drag you both down amen he says in James wherewith we bless God even the father wherewith bless uh curse We Men which are made after the Simi of God out of the same mouth proceedeth blessing and cursing my brethren these things ought not so to be you say well I've never said I curse this brother I curse this sister but what's your attitude what's your what's your comments about them is it blessing them or is it trying to drag them down oh they've just got to be put in their place God is the one who puts people in their place God is the one that positions people in the body it's not our caral Humanity that's going to put the bride see brother R made a statement when he was talking about Israel and different things he said he said National Force put Israel as a nation back in the promised land he said National Force will put the world C will put the denomination in the world Council of churches but the power of God will put the up into Glory right so it's a very different thing it's not National Force that puts a church together it's the power of God Amen that brings the people together and puts them in their position right so do a fountain send uh send forth uh at the same place sweet and bitter can the Fig Tree my brethren bear Olive and Berry um Olive berries either of Vine figs so can no Fountain doth yield salt water and fresh let's bless let's pray let's look at at the best in one another let's not try and drag down one another oh they just immature well what's your maturity doing for them what's your lived example doing for them because remember there may be fiery darts coming your way what are you going to do in response right are you just going to get carnal back at them that means you've been hit and now it's just shots fir everywhere or are you going to let if we're really mature will be spiritually minded and say maybe they you know there's a complex there maybe there's a hurt maybe they're just immature they don't know who they really are yet you know so you got to pray for them oh yes Lord work with them because remember we were all young ones oh I mean a lot of you are still young but the older ones now okay but you can say it all spiritually spiritually we were all young ones toss to and fro the slightest thing you're like man the world's over life's ended it's terrible no but then now you come and you you the Lord stabilizes your walk right and then the same thing happens to you it's just like was that I don't know where where where where bit before that thing almost took you out why because you've matured so you're going to realize we were all spiritually young ones and God had patience and Grace for us and the older ones had grace and patience for us so cannot we have grace and patience for the younger ones remember this bride this bride we must all come to our adopted position in Christ amen every every part of the body will come to its position and that should be our goal when we gather when we pray when we go into this world is Lord this message is an adoption message it's a placing message amen it's more than preachers and deacons and think no every part of the body must come to its position so Lord may I live a life where you can live through me that people will find their position in you amen the Lost will be found the sick will be healed the Wayward will come home amen that people say what's my purpose in life well maybe just the influence of the atmosphere of the Holy Ghost in your life will actually turn on a light bulb in them oh I meant to this this is where I meant to be what did you say well I don't know we just had Fellowship why because it's the Holy Ghost taking over he say well are your words really you know this Vibe thing and it's all little bit vague well Jesus would say the words I speak to you th Spirit of th life so there's a life that was Project now we know that was of course the Holy Ghost right that was God himself right Jesus is his word but your word carries Spirit too right that's why it's far darts it can be fiery darts or it can be healing Dart it can be abama gillad it can be either healing or hurting blessing or cursing amen but you see now there's this wrestling going on now so I'm just driving I I shouldn't be doing this at the same time now remember with wrestling this is the definition of it it wants to the devil wants to pin you down he wants to pin you on the mat now this can appear I'm just being humble no many times just he wants to pin you you know I've heard people say well the Lord allows this besetting sin in my life to keep me humble I think that's the that's the biggest lie you could ever swallow that's nonsense oh cuz I'm like the Apostle Paul he didn't have besing sin by the way you know but they're trying to be all spiritual because they're not willing because they love what is ruling them I no no we should hate every work of the enemy we should not put up with him for s you say well I've been this way all my life today could be a different day you can walk out with a different kind of Life different kind of an attitude I mean with the things that's once beat you down you say how could I ever be free of this yeah I'm just so used to this thing start getting used to Victory start getting used to the word living in your life hallelujah amen so he wants to pin you down wants to take control now many times these things will be will be as I said on Wednesday would be pride unthankfulness and jealousy right and they always run together you do a you look at you look at uh you start from Cain and and and we'll go to him and you go through balum I'm not going to talk about him but different ones it's always pride unthankfulness and jealousy now these are very much fiery Dart especially among religious circles especially among Believers now it's amazing now I know I've shown this picture but I just love the emotion in this picture this is the prodical son now it's amazing you know with because it's amazing what comes out of people when God answers his word when God fulfills his word it's really what's in The Believer comes out it's incredible you know like the scribes and Pharisees what was really in them came out when the word was manifested right in front of them now you take that even down to when prayer is answered now we know that there's a terrible sickness that can uh come around and and it's part of the leosan flu which is the elder brother syndrome it's a it's a mental disorder you know it makes people think the wrong way makes people think not according to the word makes people act not how they should act according to the word but it makes them act uh like an elder brother that's got a syndrome right so now here we are here's here's this picture I know picture uh says a thousand words or whatever so now here's the so so the man in blue he's the younger brother he's come home God has dealt with him so now now they're rejoicing because God has answered prayer don't know how long it took for him to you know the day he left the father's house with his money bag of inheritance the day he came back all broken and and you know in rags and so on we don't know the time frame but the short of it is God answered prayer amen amen one day the Father the father got a hold of the Throne of God and a peace came into his heart saying he's coming home amen so it turned from a I hope he's coming to a I know he's coming so now expectation begin to build maybe the first morning he looked out he's not come you know he's not walking up the path but he's coming right then day two the same thing because it was a revelation am mean the time that maybe it took did not diminish the revelation of his heart because it was more real amen the Revelation he's coming home was more real to the fact that he wasn't even physically there amen so there he was and you know no doubt the elder brother was in those prayer meetings we're going to have a special prayer meeting we got prodal this is the age where prodical are coming home this is a time of full restoration you know maybe the preacher got up and preached those things and you know the father said amen amen that was for me if it wasn't for anyone else that was for me I mean he spoke right into my life he revealed the secrets of my heart and I know this is for me amen they begin to pray they had a pray meting and you know you there was a difference after that one and no doubt you know the elder brother was there but obviously as time went on see but what happened is the elder brother subconsciously begin to compare himself with his younger brother I'm still at home I'm still here I'm a Believer look at all I do I don't tell anyone about it but just but what is he doing he's actually firing darts I'm better than my younger brother where's he gone I don't know oh we got to pray for him but I'm still here look at me what was happening a dart of Pride had come in and it and and it was producing this elder brother syndrome in him and as time went on no doubt he began to compare himself more and more with his younger brother maybe I always knew he'd leave he's just got that nature I just I just I just saw it coming A Million Miles Away you know so obvious when he said to us said to our dad one day I want my inheritance it's so obvious maybe at the time he was shocked but his pride was lifting him up now see if I can see but you see the thing is he became proud and see his identity was actually not wrapped in his position as a son in the house but his identity was the fact that he's better than his brother see we never want to get into that kind of a rut remember a rut is a grave with both ends kicked out okay so we never want it end up in that route I'm better than that one or our church is better than that church or this preacher is better than that preacher you've got an elder brother syndrome you've got a mental deficiency spiritually speaking if you think that way we must never think that way amen God is Sovereign amen he's dealing here he's dealing all around the world the bride is being lifted up into Heavenly places be made in the image of the word amen they may be smaller number they may be greater number in a church it doesn't matter God is dealing around the earth he knows where his seed is and every seed is going to come to it maturity Hallelujah so we must never compare ourselves with ourselves cuz Paul said you become unwise what why why you become unwise because you've come down with an elder brother syndrome right so now he was he was so he he become his identity was the fact that he's he wasn't his uh you know he was better than his brother but then this Pride brought this unth thankfulness because he wasn't dancing and rejoicing with the rest of the family and the servants when when his brother came home he was unthankful and then it even got to a point that when he talked to his father he couldn't even identify with his younger brother he did see notice here he says but as soon as this thy son has come this is the elder brother speaking as soon as thy so he didn't say but as soon as my brother has come no thy son so basically saying I'm not even I can't even identify with this guy and actually he could CU he had an elder brother syndrome his spiritual deficiency was very great he couldn't identify with his own flesh and blood coming back home that's a strange thing but you see he couldn't and you notice now so I'm just I was want to try and stick to my notes for once we'll get there so he couldn't even identify himself with his with his younger brother and then also he wasn't happy he says and he was angry see oh wait this one he couldn't even go in he was angry he couldn't even go in you see so it was pride and then of course that Pride brought an unthankfulness and then it brought a jealousy now this is a very dangerous position to be in because you think about it now here's someone and and and the devil's found an Avenue to try and diminish the power of a testimony you think about this for a second here here the whole church is rejoicing John's come home I'd know whoever his name would be he's come home the thing we've been longing for we've been praying for we've been under expectation for John's come home Hallelujah but here's this guy now what's going to happen shots are start are going to start to be fired right because now jealousy and pride and unthankfulness is going to try and permeate into the rest of the Believers because here he is he's a son he's the eldest son so he's got a position of authority right and the because there's there's the F the father the mother the Elder son whoever else but then there's the servants right so those the servants naturally come under come under the El you come under the older brother and so now shots are going to be fired right pride is going to try and come out and try and diminish what God is doing in their midst right because they're all celebrating but then here comes thunderace with his elder brother syndrome and and what the devil's going to use him to fire darts now to try and to try and take control of the rejoicing the victory in the camp oh my so now and this is what a this is what a this is what the devil does so now the servants now we know the father doesn't put put up with this he corrects him rightly right he's got a because he's got a shield of Revelation I pray this is my Revelation becoming material I mean it was real in my heart now I see it walking here and now he's been restored right but you see now what happens when when a jealous Spirit begins to project itself what it does is is people if they if they lower their Shield of Revelation what happens is those starts hit them and then they begin to Pander to that jealous religious spirit so now what they do is they say well that you know they're still happy for the younger brother but then now they've got to lift up the older brother to Pander to the spirit to try and make it happy what is that that's the result of fiery darts being fired right and what does it do because that jealous spirit will say look at me what about me he says to us if I have it here somewhere you know he says he says no I don't have it on my you in my notes but go read Luke 15 he says I never left I've been here the whole time I've been working hard you''ve never sell you've never you've never you know killed the fatted car for me you know you've never thrown a party for me you I've been here the whole time so what is this this jealousy is projecting and so naturally the servants would play you know because they see how the son the youngest son is they see how the father's reacting to the younger son coming home and they're of course celebrating but then they see how the Elder brother's there so what are they going to do are they going to let those fiery darts hit them cuz you got to realize you can't stop darts firing necessarily of jealousy and pride trying to take but how are you going to react to them amen but you see now to me to me now the the the servants saw what the father said they saw what the word said amen right so they responded according to what the word said amen so what they raised up that Shield of Revelation to say Hey you go be that guy enjoy your elder brother syndrome we'll pray for you it's like you maybe they were in the servants quarters later say Brothers we've got a prayer need you know the younger ones come home but it's brought out what what's in the elder brother we need to pray for him amen he needs to come to a place where he's thankful amen he's not jealous he doesn't he is not full of Pride and they would have had a different kind of a prayer meeting you see so they had a choice they could either they could either Pander they could either Pander to that jealous spirit and lift up the older brother at the same time or they could have held up that Shield of Revelation and quenched those darts and said no I'm going to celebrate because the father is celebrating amen so we must never jeal uh we must never Pander to a jealous Spirit that's allowing that fiery D to hit us because it begins to react in us you know instead of actually just saying praise God God's fulfilled his word amen we've got a time to S this is not another day this is not just another day this is a time to Rejoice amen hallah amen but you see now that that jealousy would try and produce a guilt can you imagine now the younger now let's just let's just go into here now if I can find this we'll go here somewhere now when the when the younger younger son comes home you know he tells his father father I've sinned against you and against Heaven yeah I'm no worthy to be called thy son of course the father's not interested in his son becoming a servant he's always a son right but the father said to his servants put forth the you know bring forth the best Rob put it on him and put a ring on his hand and shoes on his feet now can you imagine now I don't know because because Jesus does not reveal to us if the elder brother actually repented of this foolishness of this cality I don't know it doesn't say in the Bible but for argument sake what if he didn't you know what if he held on to it you know because he's so fixated on what he has done and what he is doing right so for argument sake what if he what if he you know was like this now as I said as I said on Wednesday a jealous Spirit like that will try and make the person who's who who's received the blessing uh try and make them feel guilty for what they've received you know it's like a you know it's like a family you know maybe they've had their first child you know maybe they got a baby you know and there's a there's another couple who maybe can't have a child or maybe it's not their time now they get jealous there's a jealousy saying well that's not fair they've got a child instead of rejoicing it's amazing you read The Parables you know it's all about Rejoice with me you like the woman with the coin I got it back Rejoice with me everyone you know the Shepherd that you know you know goes gets the one leaves the 99 gets the one it's Rejoice with me see we should always act according to the word when something good happens Rejoice amen be happy amen be happy God's doing something see you see you it can be you're like a baby comes into a home and there's another couple who doesn't have a child and there can be fiery darts of jealousy the vibe go you know there's a jealousy that goes forth to try and actually make that mother feel guilty that she's holding life what are you going to do with that I'd say hold up a shield of faith and say no no no God gave us this life this is this is what God has done in my family what he does in your family I'm not comparing because I'm not carnal right but you can either you either feel guilty for life or you can say no praise God Lord that's up to you I'd say hold up that Shield of Faith doesn't matter who it is what they do how long fire darts you can quench them all amen you see now this you know this uh elder brother here maybe maybe just for argument sake this is just me coloring the picture you know that because that jealousy loves to try and kill the effect of a testimony and it loves to try and kill the effect wait I'll get there eventually and it loves to kill the effect of a testimony in the life of the one who has the testimony it loves to kill the effect in that person so now imagine imagine this older brother he's still down with this syndrome he won't take a bomm of repentance and be be healed of it and think straight and then so imagine now if he you know comes out eventually he sees his younger brother and his younger brother's not walking like he did when he left he's a different man he's been transformed God's got a hold of his life and maybe you know because this because an elder brother the Pride just it's like anything whatever's in the heart comes forth and then so imagine now if you the older brother comes to him and says who gave you the right to wear the best robe who gave you the right to wear our father's ring of authority who gave you the right to wear his shoes so you can walk like he is walking you dressed like he's dressed you got the authority like he who gave you the right that's jealousy trying to actually oh you know try and put a guilt on someone there's this Vibe this Spirit going forth trying to bring Dominion now the younger brother could either feel bad because the older one say I know where you went I know what you did I've heard the stories that's right you haven't changed you look the same he's a brand new man he's come home the younger brother he's been transformed he's wearing a different kind of a robe right so now the older one could say what right do you have to do these things and now that younger one could hold either you know take those fiery darts and feel guilty and actually now have a shame from their past or they could rejoice and hold out that Shield of Revelation and say it was our father that gave me the robe it was his word that said you must be robed it was his word that says I've given you that that ring of authority it's his word that says you'll be shot amen with shoes like mine that you can walk like I walk amen so he could either do either one but it's his choice amen you know we can't ever appease Spirits you can't you can never appease a spirit that's like you know i' been thinking of Israel recently you know they got to a point over a year ago October 7th I think it was what whatever day you know and they said we're done we're done we're not appeasing the world anymore we're not appeasing the Palestinians anymore we're not appeasing the UN anymore we're going to do what we're going to do and we're to do it until our enemy's done they just got to that point because they realize we cannot appease this Spirit we cannot appease this thing that wants to destroy us we're sick of this wrestling match we're going to pin this thing on the ground that it can't get up amen and to me because that's the you know they are the natural Israel we're the spiritual Israel so I believe we are living in a season that we've been in now that we've got to a point enough is enough I don't care what people say I don't care what public opinion says about the word I don't care about what the enemy tries to say you can't do that what right do you have I say no enough is enough amen this word will put on flesh he will live in my life nothing of my past is going to hold me no threats of the enemy are going to bind me amen but I'm going to walk with God and God's going to fulfill his word and woe unto any devil that gets in my way amen you know it's amazing you Israel that you know you know America was trying to threaten them stop stop doing what you're doing we'll withhold weapons they keep doing what they're doing no International pressure is going to stop them right they're under a mandate and we're under a mandate from God no pressure of hell's going to stop us I mean you may have been wrestling for a long time you realize no enough is enough am mean I've been I've been given the right weapons amen my weapon Supply is never going to run to an end and I'm sick of the lies of the enemy amen I'm going to come out packing total Victory hallelujah amen they got to that point we got to get to that point too amen praise the Lord what am I doing here okay all right so now praise the Lord are you with me so far praise God we're going to continue on wait it's got to make sure I've got everything so we got to hold up that Shield of [Music] Revelation amen you see Cain and Abel Cain possessed all three unthankfulness jealousy and pride he wouldn't see he was not happy see before God be to move they would have probably G along fine right but then when the Lord when the Lord um you know be to move on their lives and it was by Revelation Abel offered a more excellent sacrifice than that of Cain right it was by Revelation it was by faith that he offered it see Cain Cain offered his own good works and of course God didn't turn it down I mean sorry God did turn it down but you see now jealousy and contentment cannot dwell together this is how you can diagnose if someone's jealous they cannot be content they can't dwell together see jealousy jealousy is never happy when someone else does better jealousy is always comparing jealousy is always saying how do I fit we're accepted in the Beloved we're accepted Jesus said come home we've come home to his word right you know he's he's he's opened his arms wide just come home just dwell dwell in the land of the word of God Amen this is you you have a place but you see and surely we should be content just from those things because even even um you know Paul would say in first Timothy he says but godliness with contentment is great gain you say well I'm content but then how do you react when someone else does well how do you react when some when God blesses another family if you're unhappy about it you're jealous right but if you're content you're happy for them you see so so Cain Cain was not Cain was a very jealous man because he because he wasn't content you think about it you're having church and God answered someone's prayer this is what happened here God answered someone's worship and God came down consume the sacrifice if you're content in the Lord you you'd be so happy for them praise the Lord Brother Abel you got a breakthrough amen praise God he answered your prayer amen the Revelation he put on your heart is right look what he's done in your life Hallelujah see that should be that's contentment right but you see Cain wasn't dancing with Abel saying praise God praise God we know how to Worship in spirit and Truth now no he got jealous he got angry he got angry so now of course shots are going to be fired fiery darts are going to be projected right he wasn't even happy see see he was he was proud he could not be he could not be moved to be changeed to the word of God he was unthankful not only that God answered Abel's sacrifice but he was unthankful God spoke to him that's there's no record in Genesis that God and the Lord said unto Abel do this it was by Revelation in his heart right but then after that was all said and done and Cain was angry God came and spoke spoke to him just do like your brother did you'll be accepted he wasn't even thankful about that yeah that's crazy that's right that's what these things do you see but it was the devil working through human flesh man so he was unth thankful that God accepted Abel's lamb and unth thankful that God spoke to him to correct him and he was too proud to Humble himself to what God instructed him to do just what your brother did maybe he say I'm the oldest you know my younger brother's always been a pain we should not know each other after the flesh David David came to the battle where Goliath was his oldest brother elab that was bypassed by God to be king he said you're just naughty maybe he was a naughty boy we were or us boys we were all naughty once you see you see a four-year-old well I can see me we were all Naughty Boys once right but we've got to have a revelation we don't know each other after the flesh we must look Beyond see see my greatest joy is to see these young ones raised up have a real touch from God and then God began to move them into their position that their for ordained gifting becomes fully manifested that's not oh that's young son no praise godu that young sister that young brother God's moving them into their position we need to celebrate those things amen we need to make room for those gifts cuz they all must be manifested they all must be displayed amen and that's what the message is called to do that's right praise the Lord hallelujah amen so now so he started firing darts because Cain went and spoke to Abel and I doubt very much it was a happy conversation wasn't a light conversation Cain was Kan was and and that demon in him was coming full force now Abel had a choice oh you're right Cain yes sorry I don't know why you'd say sorry but people bowed down it's ridiculous what people Spirits people will bow down to cuz they feel guilty we should never bow never if that's your position Kan well God revealed this to me God revealed this to me Cain it was a lamb I did what the Revelation told me to do and God Vindicated it don't take it up with me take it up with God and that's how we should be many times people come and this and this and this and this well take it up with God see the first question should be have you prayed about that have you actually took that Before the Throne of God or are you just actually kindly minded and want to keep it very much on the earth because if you ever take it up to heaven you'll realize actually oh oh oh help me Lord instead of deal with that guy help me Lord you you see amen we got a few more we're nearly there I think now here we are in the temple now wait I need to before I actually um before I actually read this I mean go to that I want to read this quote from the church age book he says now now this this brother Brown speaking about his own Ministry if if you don't mind we know all know that this gift in my life is Supernatural it's a gift whereby the holy spirit's able to discern with uh discern diseases and the thoughts of men's hearts and other hidden things that only God could know and then reveal to me I wish you could stand with me and see the faces of people when Satan knows he's going to be exposed now it isn't the people that I'm talking about it's that Satan has got a hold of their lives through sin indifference and disease right now we are all subject to those things okay but you see the this is a wrestling match okay so the devil's going to try if he can't use this move he's going to use a different move on you and if he can't use that move he's going to try because a wrestling match like I saw some Judo at the Olympics you know and there was one person just kept um being flipped by the other and they were you know but they were just doing this basically one move and then eventually the other opponent worked out how to beat them and then they they won the bout so there's always there's always you know the devil always tries different moves so what happens now is when is when fiery darts come our way it can produce indifference and I think indifference is the most dangerous one that's right here sin unbelief is obvious right he'll try and use disease so he'll try and use a sickness that comes into our body and try and use that to pin us down spiritually but then it's indifference now indifference actually can come because of what other people are doing right like the Bible says because iniquity shall abound the love of many shall wax cold that's indifference coming in right so now here we have here we have these two so I just wanted to read that there where Jesus would speak of the uh the you know there were certain uh he said two men went into the temple to pray this is Luke 18 the one a Pharisee the other a Publican we can see the one with his shoes off of the light is the Pharisee the other is the Publican the Pharisees stood and prayed thus for himself God I thank thee I'm not as other men are extortion as unjust adulterers even as this Publican so this guy's got some he's got a real problem because he's standing in the temple saying I'm awesome I am the epitome of the message of the hour look at me I've got all the quotes all the all the buckles all the things look at me I've been to all the sites I'm better than everyone else you ever get that near your mind you're in Dangerous Grounds right the great one in our midst is not any mortal it's him it's the Lord Jesus he's the great one but this Pharisee he came in said look I'm awesome I'm better than this guy that's for sure I fast twice in the week I give ties of all I possess and the Publican standing a far off could not lift up as much his eyes unto heaven but smote upon his breath saying God uh breast God be merciful to me a sinner I tell you this man went down to his house Justified rather than the other for everyone that exalteth himself shall be a base and he that humbleth him himself shall be exalted so here are these two here are these two now darts of Pride or the influence of Pride from from one who's proud can cause an indifference in people around them right because you look at the one who's got his shoes off he's you know saying how awesome he is see pride cannot lift up someone else a proud Spirit can never extend Mercy it can never Mercy can never be extended through pride pride can never you look at the Devil there's no mercy in the guy and and and here's the epitome of Pride self-importance but you see pride so Pride can never be extended through Mercy it only lifts up the one who's proud and pushes down and controls the one who's not so this guy is shooting darts of indifference right Pride which which can produce an indifference why is it indifference because it's indifference because those who those who look at the one who's proud they say I can never become like that guy I can never become like my family can never be like that family I can never be like that kind of a Believer and what's actually happened is they've come under the control of that proud Spirit but it doesn't make them proud it makes them indifferent because they look at they look at this person like like this Publican for example if he looked up at him said man I can never be that guy what's the point in trying but I'm a Jew I'm an Israelite so I'll come to church you know because this is who we are but it will produce an indifference so we must never we got to hold up our Shield of Revelation amen amen God you've called me you've saved me I'm your child amen irrespective Lord my walk is with you not with someone else right I I want to look in the mirror of your word Lord and not in the mirror of Pride amen because because that Pharisees basically you know he holds up the wrong mirror he's looking at himself saying I've made it but then he'll come to a stage in his life where he'll be miserably disappointed cuz he realized the mirror he's looking into is not the mirror of the word to match the word he's looking to the mirror of what he thinks the word should be so now so these two in the temple now so for example as I said earlier now you take so how can we now how can we combat these things because I I've you I've spelled out a lot of examples and you know different scenarios and things now how can we how can we combat these things we must never get carnal right we must never respond how it's given this is not tit fortat this is not eye for eye tooth for truth this not how this thing works otherwise you just continue a cycle that's been happening for seven Church ages right the cycle of fussing fighting stewing splitting arguments all these things Strife carnality there must come a time and now is that that cycle must be broken amen but it will only be broken by people who withstand that thing and say I will not let the devil work in me amen amen praise the Lord like you take for example you know yeah like a young Christian brother sincere he thinks he's great a real example of a Believer right you know but does he help around church now I'm not talking to you I'm just using an example right so someone who thinks they're the epitome of the message young guy okay he thinks he's awesome does he help around Church does he actually lift a finger and help the body no but then when you put he's as quiet as a church mouse he won't even lift a finger for anything but as soon as you put a microphone in his hand it's like he comes alive that guy needs to go through some things he needs to really know the grace of God he's got to realize it is God and not him right but you see we see people but the thing is that those ones are just going through a stage right now we have a choice because there's now A vibe there's a there's a spirit being projected through that I'm awesome but then what happens is now you can either hold up your Shield of Revelation and say Lord I was there once just like let's be honest we were all legalistic once amen okay we were with oh no I never was yeah you were everyone goes through that face some people stay in that face but it's better when you go through the face and enjoy the goodness of of God right but we were all that stage but you see now there's a choice that the more spiritually mature could make they can either drop that Shield of Revelation and let that fiery doubt hit them and then they start pushing down start condescending start trying to push that young one out of the church that's the bad choice by the way okay see you got to look at how am I responding to the situation that really shows you whether you've lifted up the shield of Revelation or you've been hit by the D okay it's it's your reaction okay so if your reaction is man this guy's got to fall into line he's got to pull his weight he's got to do and you push him down condescend all these things you've been hit by a dart but then now if you hold up that Shield of Revelation and you realize Lord I was there once Lord this is all part of his journey Lord I'm thankful you're working his life Lord I'm thankful Lord he wants to be here he wants to serve you and then what do you do you create an atmosphere amen create an atmosphere which which causes them to come under the influence of the Holy Spirit where you can teach them a more excellent way amen see brother Ram says now surely after all these years uh on the field and around the world and seeing different people I ought to know a little bit about the gate to enter and out and if you want to get somewhere with God never let an arrogant Spirit ever come around you I mean don't let No Malice come in no matter what anyone has done if if they are wrong don't you never build a complex against that person see complex is building up against someone is because a fire darts hit you right see you be sweet and kind remember God loved you when you in sin and if the spirit of God is in you you love the other person when he is in wrong see just pray for them and love one another that's right that's the great secret amen now I'm just going to close with these thoughts here Satan wants to pen us on the mat but you see the church has a hidden power the Bride of Jesus Christ has a hidden power Amen brother Brown would say you know wrestlers you know they practice on breaking toe holes and things but you can't break these toe holes speak about the devil no could you imagine a wrestler that came out M with his fingernails polish trunks on all kinds of gold beads around it looks like a pretty good wrestler but if it's only intellectual if he hasn't got a hidden strength there that when the when his enemy gets a Toe Hold on him that he can pull out of it his intellectual beads around him and everything won't make much difference am mean so is all our intellectual means nothing if there isn't the hidden power of the Holy Ghost there you see this is the power that will break the wrestling match I mean there's a hidden power I mean that's in the believer that the devil doesn't realize it's there I mean you take Samson for example he was bound a thousand Philistines were in front of him saying we're going to kill him we're going to take him and make fun of him amen but he had a hidden power Amen to break those bands remember those bands were put on him not not from the enemy but from his own Israelites I mean from his own country and they said they said look the the Philistines are going to get us why they were they were so much fear was projected through them that they said let's bind up this Champion let's try and keep the status quo as it always should be I say no enough is enough I mean we should never God begins to move in someone's life let's rally around God moving I mean they should have rallied around Samson but they bound up the one that was sent to deliver them I me but you see Samson had a hidden power Hallelujah that even the Israelites didn't know where it came from but there was a Nazarite vow he was born under and he was living according to and then when the enemy shouted against him it said the spirit of God Came Upon him and he broke that toe ho hold to the enemy and he slew a thousand with a Jawbone of an ass why because he had a hidden power amen that can break any SE see there's a promise of God that can break any hold on any devil at any time amen Jesus our lord proved it when he was uh that he was Emanuel God himself made flesh Among Us and when he met Satan to show that Satan could be defeated by the word every time Satan would come to him say it is written it's written amen he says see what is this hidden power that's what the church today they've got a hidden power oh something that fortifies him what is it's the word the manifestation of God's grace with his people amen that's the hidden power that we have that's the manifestation of God God's grace with his people what is that manifestation that's the fulfillment of the word today in our midst amen not just back in the prophet's Ministry no that same word that same Pillar of Fire is here today confirming his word it's a manifestation of God's grace what was Camp a manifestation of God's grace I mean what of Our Lives they're a manifestation of God's grace and it's a hidden power that you possess am mean that when the enemy is trying to pin you down by firing darts you feel indifferent you feel resentful you feel Kindel you feel angry at someone you build a complex you've got a hidden power that can break that Toe Hold amen you've got that hidden power because they call on God say God I don't want to feel this way against my brother and sister God I don't want to feel this way against the word I don't want to feel this way against this church Lord Lord break this hidden power I don't want to be indifferent anymore Lord I want to be on fire once again oh God lord I want to pin this devil on the ground oh god father I want to walk with you once again Lord Jesus that's because I've got a hidden power Lord you've given it to me Lord by your grace and Lord I want to see it come come out oh God I want to see it Liv in my life Lord Jesus that when the enemy comes against me he's going to be pinned on the ground and he's going to stay on the ground and he's going to keep staying on the ground why because I've allowed that hidden power Amen to take control of my life hallelujah hallelujah that's what you've got to do you got to let that hidden power of the Holy Ghost take Dominion amen that's how you that's how you P the devil on the ground hallelujah amen the devil wants us to be your St red up and angry resentful all these things I say enough's enough amen he ain't allowed to do that no more he not welcome here no more to do those kind of things no this is the hour of the full manifestation of the word of God am mean what brother Braham saw in preview is in flesh in front of us right today amen what the word prophesied of a bride is here am mean so if it's here right now where the attributes of the Living God I say God that hidden power might be in its fullness and its strength and my life it doesn't matter if it's a battle royale me against a whole bunch of demons I'll pin everyone on the ground Hallelujah and I'll go gouge out their eyes in the name of Jesus Christ Hallelujah the Lord hallelujah that's so how do you do it love the lord it's very simple love the Lord keep that love about you keep that sweet feeling that Joy when you read his word Lord thank you for speaking to me Lord you hear the message Lord this is home thank you for the seventh angel message that I can Feast on I can feed on the body word of the son of man Lord thank you Lord we could have church just stay in love with him whatever you do and you'll create a power around you he'll destroy every doall amen it'll destroy every day you hold that revelation God has called me to keep me he's redeemed Me by his grace I ain't just a church member I ain't part of just some religious movement but I'm part of the Bride of Jesus Christ I'm part of the revelation of the word for this day amen I'm called to walk like Enoch walked and nothing's going to stop me Hallelujah Hallelujah did he not say that we would be trees planted by rivers of Living Water did he not say that now is the restoration of the Bride tree I mean did he not say that we are not just some withered stump in the ground but God would restore all that the enemy has eaten off us did he not say that amen that we be planted by rivers of Living Water what is that Living Water the Holy Ghost we're planted in him amen by him oh God that we're drawing strength from that living stream the word of God every day did not say that's where we're planted amen if God is planted nothing can pluck it up the devil's no arist that's welcome around here am mean what God has planted will stay amen and his Leaf shall not wither amen so what does that mean now that means that there's an atmosphere of Fellowship amen there's a cool Fellowship atmosphere amen that permeates out of the believer hallelujah hallelujah amen so you got to realize your life has great power your life you live why is Camp a blessing you you the atmosphere you carry as a as a body of people we know it's the we know the brides all you know everyone's the same right but but what if Camp was okay we got to stick to this time table got to do this you can't have all the you know we're not having suppers you we're being all restrictive no one's really welcome what kind of atmosphere would that be do you think the Lord would feel welcome in that kind of a place where it's all you know like this see so it's the atmosphere we carry as a people and you got to realize you say well I was just one in a group of I don't know how many people were there but you that's right you make the difference it's you that made the difference it's not just the group no it's it's you the atmosphere you carry has great weight and power Amen brother says what is fellowship what do the leaves do makes it cool where the birds flying under the leaves are heart cool off that's that's your tree again and he shall be like a tree that's planted SE all right where people can come and sit down under the Fellowship of the Holy Ghost cool off a little bit you're all flustrated you don't know what's happened whether you'll die whether you're saved or not you don't know whether this church is right or that's right just come down under the tree that's got some leaves on it sit down there let the winds from Heaven go to blowing like a rushing Mighty Wind Through the leaves you know oh and it begins to and you begin to cool off a little bit am amen that's you thank you he's talking about you huj right people get all stressed lustrate all these things and you know people leave us man I feel so much better man I'm so glad I came to church I so glad I was at Camp I feel so much lighter what's happened why there's been green leaves they've come under shade the wind of Heaven's blowing through there and they feel so much better so someone who's got been hit by all these darts and you know they hit they don't know if they're saved or not they're going to live or die whatever all these things they just come under these Green Leaves of fellowship and healing virtue starts coming into them this is this I'm just telling you what happened at Camp by the way right so you got to realize this is how you can quench those darts you say Lord I'm here as a green tree I'm here not for myself but for others amen people may be a like I said a porcupine with fiery darts all kind of things they come in just under your atmosphere Lord not my not my atmosphere Your Atmosphere Lord and God begin to bring healing pull the darts out change their lives amen so now I'm just going to I'm just going to conclude just with this one scripture that I read before we have discussed a lot of things pride unthankfulness and jealousy how it affects us you know how to fix people that have it but what are you going to do in response let's be spiritually minded let's look beyond the person look beyond the fault look beyond the atmosphere the vibe they're projecting say Lord I was there once I was like that once you found me Lord you changed my life Lord You Found Me Lord and you did it for a purpose Lord Lord don't lay that to their charge Lord they don't mean to do that Lord you know what they've been through Lord Hallelujah Lord help them never ever feel angry against someone if you feel frustrated because you don't know the answer take it before the throne of grace and God will speak to you amen let's have the musicians

shouldn't have nothing to worry about but in our flesh we do we do think about these things and I was going through a a trial in my life and the devil came and he threw his DTS upon me and he made me doubt and after I got prayed yes everything was forgotten about I didn't worry about it but a A letter came home from the hospital and they're going to call me up for a for a meeting and then it was there for a few months and I didn't worry about it and I've forgotten about it again and just before Camp a week before Camp I get a phone call from the hospital telling me that um yeah I need to come in they got a date set for me and yet again that fear come back upon me um that you know there could be something there um or there could be nothing there but the fact that they called me in for the procedure um I was concerned and I brought it back to the Lord in prayer but still in my Humanity I I I had fear and I come to the camp and when the prayer line came through I came and got prayer and brother Andrew said the same thing there's nothing to worry about all is clear after the service he sat me down with my with my Deacon and he said to me it's finished so you go there and they're going to send you home clean B of Health um on Thursday I wasn't here on wedness day on Thursday I went to the hospital in the morning and I went a little bit early thinking that they'll take me in early
