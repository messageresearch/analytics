[8:28] good morning welcome to the house of God
[8:32] this morning it's good to be a Christian
[8:35] it's good to have faith how would your
[8:38] life really exist if you didn't have
[8:40] faith now if you couldn't believe four
[8:42] things and believe there was a greater
[8:43] power than just our ability you know and
[8:46] we you know we have such an awesome
[8:49] privilege as Christians to live a life
[8:50] of faith you know that could make us so
[8:52] positive you know because we faith says
[8:55] yes you know an amen that's faith no sir
[8:59] and every situation where yes you know
[9:03] the children of Israel often got into a
[9:05] lot of dire situations but God always
[9:07] brought them through I was reading them
[9:09] the other day when they and I don't know
[9:12] what they didn't believe but the things
[9:15] they went through even when they got to
[9:16] their read see God see why you crying to
[9:20] me tell the children to move forward
[9:21] just move forward doesn't matter if
[9:24] there's a Syria that you that if you
[9:26] have to swim to it just long throught
[9:27] but when they walked forward it opened
[9:29] up there's faith amen so yeah we that's
[9:35] the God that we come to this morning and
[9:37] who's excited to be in the house of God
[9:39] amen I believe we can have a good time I
[9:42] like the flowers when I was younger I
[9:45] didn't like flowers I thought they're a
[9:47] bit girlie
[9:49] but now that I've gotten away but more
[9:51] secure and myself I can appreciate a
[9:57] nice flower I think they look nice and I
[10:00] also appreciate them as being God's
[10:01] creation I mean I think God's got a
[10:03] great sense of thumb by the things he
[10:06] makes it very nice and he makes a lot of
[10:08] different types of things he makes nice
[10:09] rugged manly trees and like nice

[57:28] this word that we will
[57:29] into your hands I ask it in the precious
[57:31] name of our Lord Jesus Christ amen amen
[57:36] you can put that first slide on so long
[57:38] but the we'll just read the sports
[57:40] portion so second Samuel 23 from verse
[57:43] 14 and David was then in a hold and the
[57:46] garrison of the Philistines was then in
[57:48] basically and very well-known portion
[57:49] and David longed and said oh that one
[57:53] would give me drink of the water of the
[57:55] well of Bethlehem which is by the gate
[57:56] and the three mighty men break through
[57:59] the host of the Philistines and drew
[58:01] water out of the well of Bethlehem that
[58:03] was by the gate and took it and brought
[58:05] it to David nevertheless he would not
[58:07] drink thereof but pulled it out unto the
[58:10] Lord and he said be it far from here
[58:12] Lord that I should do this is not this
[58:16] the blood of the main that went in
[58:18] jeopardy of their lives before he would
[58:20] not would not drink it these things that
[58:22] these three mighty men I mean you can
[58:25] take your seats this morning I mean it's
[58:31] a very well-known portion and I want to
[58:34] want to get there get you that's a
[58:36] little lighter I trust that everyone is
[58:38] comfortable that everyone is relaxed and
[58:40] trusted but we can just I also it this
[58:45] way you can just look over my my
[58:47] mistakes and my wrongs and and just
[58:50] allow the Lord to speak to your heart
[58:52] this morning so before I want to get
[58:56] going I particularly wanted to put up
[58:58] that slide be because I want to just
[59:00] kind of create the background of all the
[59:03] or the principle against which I want to
[59:05] share these things this morning morning
[59:07] Maria it's good to see him
[59:09] I mean praise the Lord and and I just
[59:13] want to see the the the kind of
[59:15] background or principle and that is that
[59:19] you know to hit you that story of Isaac
[59:22] and Rebecca and and we read in the Bible
[59:25] now now we know that brother Branham
[59:27] when he asked the Lord for a scripture
[59:30] that pertains to his ministry the Lord
[59:32] showed him
[59:32] Aliza and he was our ELISA and and the
[59:36] whole principle was that ELISA now went
[59:39] out and searched for a bride for Isaac
[59:41] and found
[59:42] brought her back and and then Rebecca
[59:45] and and and in these that that beautiful
[59:48] song that as as they riding along but
[59:53] she sings ELISA
[59:55] tell me more I mean what does Isaac
[59:58] really look like and we had an ELISA
[1:00:00] that told us what Isaac what Isaac's
[1:00:03] word is I mean and we're so thankful for
[1:00:05] those things so so then they come to
[1:00:08] this place where we eyes extent he's and
[1:00:11] the Bible speaks about how it was his
[1:00:12] mother's tantony and he took her into
[1:00:14] the tent I mean so so Rebecca jumped off
[1:00:18] the camel and ran into his arms and this
[1:00:20] beautiful love story I mean and they
[1:00:22] embraced each other and he took her into
[1:00:24] his mother state and and and the thought
[1:00:27] that I want to she this morning is
[1:00:29] against that background now you have of
[1:00:32] course we're talking about the civil
[1:00:33] Celia we have now Rebecca and Isaac now
[1:00:36] in the tent and he's there whispering
[1:00:38] secrets into her ear he's revealing
[1:00:41] himself to her now in in the tent so
[1:00:44] that's kind of the background that I
[1:00:46] want to speak these things against now
[1:00:48] so so if we can can kind of have that as
[1:00:51] the mental picture behind everything
[1:00:53] that I want to share this morning
[1:00:55] there's two very important principles
[1:00:57] that I want to share and the first is in
[1:01:00] that tent
[1:01:00] let's Eve this is on yes first alone in
[1:01:04] this in the tent he reveals things to
[1:01:07] her that is she's with nobody else you
[1:01:11] see these things are the husband and
[1:01:12] wife she is that's for absolutely no one
[1:01:14] else it's got nothing to do with nobody
[1:01:15] I mean it's for her I mean but if she is
[1:01:20] what while he's I'm gonna say what
[1:01:23] if she's really either was for her
[1:01:25] specific but what he now reveals under
[1:01:29] the Seventh Seal to us individually it's
[1:01:32] very specific for us and then the second
[1:01:36] thing is the motive for everything that
[1:01:38] is shade is love there's no other motive
[1:01:41] that God has and that is love I mean so
[1:01:44] remember those two principles as we go
[1:01:46] on so I want to kick off by speaking
[1:01:49] about predestination a little bit and
[1:01:51] and you know you might think okay this
[1:01:53] is strange why do we jump from day to
[1:01:55] day
[1:01:56] but you will see as we go on the Bible
[1:01:59] says that the lamb was slain before the
[1:02:01] foundation of the earth I mean and I
[1:02:03] believe that when God remember you hi
[1:02:05] brother branham I'm so thankful for
[1:02:07] ELISA how he went right back into the
[1:02:10] mind of God I mean and and how he said
[1:02:12] that God dwelt alone with his faults I
[1:02:14] mean thank God that fold allspice and
[1:02:17] time and eternity I mean and how God in
[1:02:19] those thoughts that he had I mean God
[1:02:21] had attributes I mean and and God had
[1:02:23] and and if I might just just in order to
[1:02:26] kind of relate to it a little bit I'll
[1:02:28] put it this way I got at two different
[1:02:29] types of attributes the one lot of
[1:02:31] attributes was God's redemptive
[1:02:33] attributes so God was healer and God was
[1:02:35] Savior and God was Redeemer and God had
[1:02:37] all those attributes I mean and and we
[1:02:39] can look at their similar redemptive
[1:02:40] attributes of God Jehovah Shalom and all
[1:02:42] those different ones
[1:02:43] I mean God had those attributes and he
[1:02:44] needed to express them he wanted to
[1:02:46] express them and and while he was any in
[1:02:49] his clothes alone well before the bride
[1:02:50] was manifested I mean before God spoke
[1:02:53] the words and before the creation
[1:02:54] started rolling out God could only think
[1:02:56] about it I mean but there's something
[1:02:59] else and that's the other type of
[1:03:00] attribute of God and that is whenever
[1:03:03] God thought of himself as Redeemer as
[1:03:06] Savior he thought of you
[1:03:09] you see God could not think of himself
[1:03:11] as Savior without thinking of the ones
[1:03:14] he's gonna say I mean and that's the
[1:03:17] other type of attributes we are
[1:03:18] attributes of God so God needed these
[1:03:22] attributes are sitting here this morning
[1:03:24] I mean in order for God to be a savior I
[1:03:27] mean so we and and that's the wonderful
[1:03:30] thing of being his bride is that God
[1:03:33] reveals those attributes to us now
[1:03:36] here's the fun part
[1:03:37] God doesn't do a steal relation okay God
[1:03:41] doesn't just teach us this my children
[1:03:44] is what peace is all about
[1:03:47] you see God allows us to go through
[1:03:50] heaps of turmoil so that when jehova
[1:03:53] sholom comes across I pry I mean if you
[1:03:56] said this is what peace is all about I
[1:03:58] mean God allows us to go through times
[1:04:01] where we have shortage so that when
[1:04:04] Jehovah Jireh comes and we appreciate
[1:04:06] you have a jar God allows us to become
[1:04:08] six winned over
[1:04:09] comes we understand what it means I mean
[1:04:11] and bring that's what's happening now
[1:04:14] while the bride is in this else I second
[1:04:17] fires of a three-fold purpose of the
[1:04:19] civil seal while we're going through
[1:04:21] this time I mean while we are well we
[1:04:23] are growing in God God is allowing us to
[1:04:26] experience all these things to come
[1:04:27] across her path so that God can reveal
[1:04:29] himself to us so that wind this bride is
[1:04:31] pulled back to his side I mean so she's
[1:04:34] gonna be a river lighted bride she's not
[1:04:37] gonna be a bride that was taught in a
[1:04:38] seminary she's a bride that's gonna be
[1:04:40] forged like gold
[1:04:42] I mean beaten and beaten and beaten and
[1:04:45] tried in the fire until he can see
[1:04:47] himself in her I mean and we are so
[1:04:50] thankful that God sent us he ELISA that
[1:04:52] gave us a peep into the heart of God so
[1:04:55] that we can see those things so to bring
[1:04:58] it back to predestination now when when
[1:05:00] we were predestinated we were not only
[1:05:02] predestinated as bain or as Andy or as I
[1:05:06] see course as whoever it is
[1:05:08] God did not predestinated us you know he
[1:05:10] didn't predation I just just as the name
[1:05:12] God predestinated us absolutely
[1:05:14] intertwined with his with his attributes
[1:05:17] I mean God predestinated us from the
[1:05:20] start and even the term from the star
[1:05:23] doesn't deploy to God I mean God Emma
[1:05:25] started
[1:05:26] I mean God always thought of us through
[1:05:28] those redemptive attributes and I thank
[1:05:30] God for those things we read in Genesis
[1:05:34] how how God did the creation and and and
[1:05:38] even when Adam and Eve fell who
[1:05:40] immediately God's response was the seed
[1:05:42] of the woman will be given I mean
[1:05:44] because before God spoke those words in
[1:05:47] Genesis I mean God had already thought
[1:05:49] in his mind and he already thought of
[1:05:51] the Lamb that was slain from before the
[1:05:53] foundation of the earth the Bible speaks
[1:05:54] about those things I mean and then as
[1:05:56] time progressed we read about Abraham
[1:05:59] Abraham who who was as far as I
[1:06:02] understand he was idol worship and grew
[1:06:04] up in a house where his dead you know
[1:06:06] made idols and all sorts of things and
[1:06:08] and and God called him because he was a
[1:06:12] predestinated son I mean God called him
[1:06:14] God reached out to him he didn't reach a
[1:06:16] reach out to God I mean God reached out
[1:06:19] to him like brother branham shadow so
[1:06:21] clearly even on the garden of
[1:06:22] even Adam never came back to God God God
[1:06:24] we are you I mean I mean God reached out
[1:06:27] Adam Adam where are you it's always God
[1:06:30] I mean it's always God reaching out to
[1:06:32] us by His grace he's predestinated grace
[1:06:35] so now God called Abraham and God walked
[1:06:39] the path with Abraham I mean and and God
[1:06:41] God made him promises and so forth but
[1:06:45] but I want to just focus on one thing
[1:06:47] for a moment and that is we we you know
[1:06:51] I don't know if you remember that that
[1:06:52] place where we God made a covenant with
[1:06:54] Abraham I mean and and it's so beautiful
[1:06:57] when you read it brother branham
[1:06:58] actually most profound statements about
[1:07:00] it Harris said that God had to put put
[1:07:03] him asleep to get him sorry out of the
[1:07:05] way so that Abram can see you did
[1:07:07] nothing about this he had nothing to do
[1:07:09] with us I mean you remember God said to
[1:07:12] him you know get those animals and
[1:07:13] divide them asunder and so forth and
[1:07:15] then in and speaks about how God then
[1:07:17] came on the scene but it says God put
[1:07:19] him in a deep sleep and when Abram was
[1:07:21] asleep so he could not contribute to
[1:07:23] that he could do nothing to meet God
[1:07:26] halfway I mean then God promised I mean
[1:07:29] and God said I am gonna do this and I am
[1:07:32] gonna do that and I am gonna do this I
[1:07:34] mean there was nothing to do with
[1:07:36] Abraham it was nothing to do with what I
[1:07:37] drew Abram was gonna keep some rule
[1:07:39] we're gonna keep some commitment or
[1:07:41] gonna keep some promise from his side it
[1:07:43] was all God that did the whole thing and
[1:07:45] we thank God for it and then brother
[1:07:48] Brennan makes it at the children of
[1:07:50] Abraham now this covenant people Israel
[1:07:53] down in Egypt on account now listen to
[1:07:55] this I just love the fact that we have a
[1:07:58] prophet man I mean you can't say these
[1:08:00] things from a denominational perspective
[1:08:03] these government people now remember now
[1:08:05] God is the principle of sowing and
[1:08:07] reaping so now I was blown away when I
[1:08:11] read this quote the first time they were
[1:08:12] in it in Egypt on account of
[1:08:14] disobedience and of selling their
[1:08:16] brother Joseph 400 years suffering
[1:08:22] slavery and all sorts of things because
[1:08:24] of what they did to Joseph you could
[1:08:28] argue also on the other side it was all
[1:08:31] according to God's predestinated plan I
[1:08:33] mean just like when when
[1:08:37] when God spoke to two I think there was
[1:08:40] Judah I mean before he let him go into
[1:08:43] into captivity and so forth God said to
[1:08:46] him I know the thoughts that I've
[1:08:48] thought about you I mean I mean and what
[1:08:51] God said he says I'm gonna bring you to
[1:08:53] an expected end and God made all those
[1:08:55] promises just before he let him go into
[1:08:58] captivity for 70 years
[1:08:59] I mean you see God knows the end from
[1:09:02] the beginning God knows that purpose God
[1:09:04] knows exactly where he wants to bring
[1:09:06] each one of us to I mean hallelujah
[1:09:10] so let's just try again now this
[1:09:13] covenant people Israel down in Egypt on
[1:09:14] account of disobedience and of selling
[1:09:16] their brother Joseph and was taken down
[1:09:18] into Egypt and was there for hundred
[1:09:20] years and the bondage I want you to
[1:09:22] notice they never lost their covenant
[1:09:25] they lost they freedom I mean the fact
[1:09:31] that they missed up the fact that they
[1:09:33] did that to their brother Joseph the
[1:09:34] fact that they you know they're all
[1:09:36] sorts of silly things all that or the
[1:09:38] conniving of Jacob and all of that stuff
[1:09:40] did not change the governor did not
[1:09:43] change what God said did not change
[1:09:45] predestination so what about you what
[1:09:49] about me I mean we've got a covenant in
[1:09:52] fact claiming before God added a weird
[1:09:55] in his mind
[1:09:56] we were the redeemed receivers of
[1:09:59] Redemption
[1:10:00] I mean we were thee hallelujah and we
[1:10:03] have a spiritual seed of Abraham I mean
[1:10:05] and we were like I said in the mind of
[1:10:08] God and I just want to see these things
[1:10:10] I I just I just want to share this weird
[1:10:12] and and this morning I just want to be a
[1:10:14] blessing and just say thank God for the
[1:10:16] word amen then he sees then God's you
[1:10:19] know you and I can't say this but when a
[1:10:21] prophet say this I mean because I praise
[1:10:23] the Lord
[1:10:24] when God's just as duty-bound to you as
[1:10:27] he was to Abraham
[1:10:29] just as duty-bound because what he I was
[1:10:32] you something no because he said because
[1:10:35] he's worthy I mean because his covenant
[1:10:38] see God made the Covenant God by the
[1:10:40] commitment then he says say that would
[1:10:43] take all the skier out of it
[1:10:45] God don't want you to be scared of
[1:10:47] nothing race solemnly upon
[1:10:50] he saved I mean what he see and and you
[1:10:54] can also say on what he thought because
[1:10:56] what he thought he said I mean I thank
[1:10:59] God that I was in the mind of God
[1:11:01] hallelujah but you know in our minds we
[1:11:04] often think yes I understand that
[1:11:09] intellectually but I've messed up today
[1:11:12] so I feel this thing from God we often
[1:11:16] do and then we live at arm's length from
[1:11:19] God and we are afraid to come close to
[1:11:21] him we often we we you know we think we
[1:11:25] need to do penance or something that's a
[1:11:27] Catholic spirit in it you know we often
[1:11:30] and that's just how human beings are we
[1:11:32] think that you know we've messed up so
[1:11:34] much or maybe we have to have so many
[1:11:35] good days before we can pray again or
[1:11:37] before we can approach God again or
[1:11:39] before he can bless us again or
[1:11:40] something like that
[1:11:41] I mean that's human thinking that's not
[1:11:43] God's thinking God never looked at us
[1:11:48] God never looked at Abraham I mean God
[1:11:51] looks at his promised God looks at what
[1:11:53] he said and God is sticking to his word
[1:11:56] and God sticking you could say you know
[1:11:58] you hear sometimes human beings saying
[1:12:00] I'll stick to my story well God sticks
[1:12:03] to his story but the thing is it's not a
[1:12:05] story I mean that's the eternal Word of
[1:12:07] God and he's sticking to it and I thank
[1:12:09] God brother Brennan says is the one
[1:12:11] thing God cannot do and that's change
[1:12:12] his word Amy Bell Brown sees these elect
[1:12:17] were not only the eternal thoughts of
[1:12:19] God which were to be expressed in flesh
[1:12:21] in the new season but the same elect are
[1:12:24] called by another name according to
[1:12:26] Romans 4:16 we find that God has given a
[1:12:28] sure promise to all of Abraham's seed
[1:12:30] and Paul puts himself and all believers
[1:12:32] under that designation because he says
[1:12:34] Abraham who is the father of us all then
[1:12:37] he goes on to not only narrow down this
[1:12:39] definition but rather to finalize it for
[1:12:41] in Galatians 3 he identified the seed
[1:12:44] singular with Jesus and counted the seed
[1:12:48] children as children of promise and
[1:12:50] promises having to do with election or
[1:12:52] the choosing of God and that's exactly
[1:12:54] what we've been saying these were of the
[1:12:56] royal seed are the elect of God are the
[1:12:58] predestinated for known of God and were
[1:13:01] in the mind of God and his thoughts
[1:13:04] in the church age book sneaking here
[1:13:06] this is polished up playing which here I
[1:13:08] mean but it's still the slot that comes
[1:13:10] from God in very plain language the true
[1:13:12] Bride of Christ was in the mind of God
[1:13:14] eternally he's thoughts about you and me
[1:13:19] never started it never had a staff so it
[1:13:24] can never have any praise God I mean in
[1:13:27] very plain language the true Bride of
[1:13:28] Christ was in the mind of God eternally
[1:13:30] though not expressed until each came
[1:13:33] forth in the designated decreed season
[1:13:35] and our season praise the Lord was seven
[1:13:38] seal season hallelujah ego season praise
[1:13:41] the Lord as each member came forth it
[1:13:43] became expressed and took its place in
[1:13:46] the body thus this bride is the literal
[1:13:48] spoken word seed bride and though she's
[1:13:52] feminine in designation
[1:13:54] she is also called the body of Christ it
[1:13:58] is very apparent that she ought to be
[1:13:59] called that for she was predestinated in
[1:14:01] him came from the same source was
[1:14:04] eternal with him and is now manifesting
[1:14:06] God in a many membered body whereas once
[1:14:09] God was manifested in one member even
[1:14:11] our Lord Jesus Christ and if you look at
[1:14:15] your faults in your failings in your
[1:14:16] mistakes in your daily battles you can
[1:14:18] never associate with it fully and that's
[1:14:22] our problem as human beings we often
[1:14:25] face or look in the mirror I mean and
[1:14:28] and I don't know if you ever do that and
[1:14:30] speak yourself in the mirror but you
[1:14:32] know maybe I've just got a few screws
[1:14:34] loose but I do sometimes and I say to
[1:14:36] myself you idiot you made up so bad why
[1:14:41] did you deal with that situation in that
[1:14:42] way you know but the problem is we judge
[1:14:45] ourselves from a critical humanistic
[1:14:48] perspective God never looks like like
[1:14:51] that yeah God never looks at us like
[1:14:53] that I mean God never looks at us
[1:14:55] through our opinion I thank God for that
[1:14:58] but I thank God more that God never
[1:15:00] looks at me through other people's
[1:15:01] opinion you know because we are so
[1:15:03] critical so quickly of ourselves and of
[1:15:05] others well random also sees he sees as
[1:15:09] the eternal logos God was manifested in
[1:15:12] the son and in Jesus throughout all the
[1:15:14] fullness of the Godhead bodily
[1:15:16] and
[1:15:17] eternal one was the father manifest in
[1:15:20] flesh and they by guiding the title of
[1:15:22] son
[1:15:23] even so we eternal in his thoughts in
[1:15:25] our turn became the many membered spoken
[1:15:29] word seed and i and i just just to color
[1:15:32] that picture in a little bit the first
[1:15:35] seed went he to the ground I mean Jesus
[1:15:37] Christ the first c22 the ground but now
[1:15:40] it's harvest time it's time with that
[1:15:43] one seed is now bringing forth a crop a
[1:15:45] mini membered crop now that seed in
[1:15:47] multiplied form hallelujah
[1:15:52] those eternal thoughts now manifested in
[1:15:54] flesh are the sons of God even as we are
[1:15:56] so called we did not become seed by the
[1:15:59] rebirth we were seed and therefore were
[1:16:01] reborn for only the elect can be reborn
[1:16:04] which is a very important principle only
[1:16:06] the elect can be reborn because we were
[1:16:09] seed is the reason we could be quickened
[1:16:12] in non seed there's nothing to quicken
[1:16:18] God has predestinated us and that is
[1:16:23] clear and the sad thing is many churches
[1:16:27] these days don't even believe in
[1:16:28] predestination because from a humanistic
[1:16:30] perspective they say God is unfair but
[1:16:34] you see if you read the word and you see
[1:16:37] here a buzzard I mean you gonna call God
[1:16:39] on fee but when you read the word you
[1:16:42] see I was a eagle from the start and
[1:16:44] when I was always an eagle I did nothing
[1:16:46] to deserve to become an Eagle are you
[1:16:48] gonna say praise God
[1:16:49] I mean praise God I'm an eagle I mean so
[1:16:52] what the buzzards opinion of the word is
[1:16:54] I don't care
[1:16:56] I don't kill him praise God but I just
[1:16:59] see I'm an eagle and I thank God for God
[1:17:02] has predestinated us but now the
[1:17:05] question that I want to want to ask
[1:17:07] remember now he's speaking about the
[1:17:09] secrets that he's sharing in his team
[1:17:11] how much works is God expecting of us
[1:17:15] how much his guards are asking us to
[1:17:18] meet him halfway
[1:17:19] how much is God saying I can make you a
[1:17:22] deal okay you do this this disinvest and
[1:17:25] then I will I mean now you obviously
[1:17:27] know the answer I've already said it was
[1:17:29] an unconditional governor and we know
[1:17:31] these things
[1:17:32] very well I want to continue in this
[1:17:36] line of thought now so God made a
[1:17:39] covenant with Israel God made a covenant
[1:17:42] with Abraham God provided the way out of
[1:17:45] Egypt now look at what brother Branham
[1:17:47] sees yeah I want you to notice this
[1:17:51] beautiful picture and this would be good
[1:17:53] for legalists you said listen God never
[1:17:56] come down and said no I just want to say
[1:17:58] I'm not trying to criticize legalist or
[1:18:00] anything that's that's not my heart but
[1:18:02] you'll see as we go what what the
[1:18:04] forties that I want to get across this
[1:18:05] morning said listen our God never come
[1:18:08] down and said now if you'll do certain
[1:18:10] things if you do certain things God's
[1:18:12] grace provided the Savior Moses right in
[1:18:16] that time they needed a savior the
[1:18:17] Savior that God seen for them in that
[1:18:19] time was Moses that's right not under
[1:18:22] any conditions was Moses brought but by
[1:18:24] Sovereign Grace God sent Moses not only
[1:18:27] a savior but grace provided the
[1:18:29] deliverer without any law without
[1:18:32] anything just solemn grace of God he
[1:18:34] sent down Moses to be a deliverer and
[1:18:36] the savior of the nation to bring them
[1:18:39] out God in that season sent a savior a
[1:18:42] deliverer and I want to say in that same
[1:18:45] way and don't quote me wrong and don't
[1:18:47] say I'm you know lifting brother branham
[1:18:50] up but we can say the same thing in our
[1:18:52] day
[1:18:52] God sent again a savior why a
[1:18:55] representative of his word I mean a
[1:18:57] representative of God's thoughts
[1:19:00] hallelujah and God did it it's all God's
[1:19:04] doing I mean like he's like brother
[1:19:06] Ramses this is something that will
[1:19:08] address the legalists and so on it's so
[1:19:10] easy to get legalistic it's so easy
[1:19:12] because of a human mindset of how we are
[1:19:14] brought up and different things I mean
[1:19:16] to have the mindset I mean that we
[1:19:18] somehow need to meet God halfway we
[1:19:20] Samiha need to purchase our own
[1:19:22] salvation well why did God purchase a
[1:19:24] thing in the message Kalish Barnea
[1:19:29] brother Branham says God has acted to
[1:19:30] the covenant people without any effort
[1:19:33] of these but he sent freely from heaven
[1:19:38] to his covenant people act of grace upon
[1:19:41] the sovereignty of his promise what a
[1:19:44] sovereignty mean it means
[1:19:45] doesn't ask nobody it doesn't ask your
[1:19:48] opinion got it as the devil's opinion
[1:19:51] God doesn't ask the the Angels opinion
[1:19:53] God does not your opinion or whether you
[1:19:55] worthy or not I mean sovereignly God
[1:19:58] decided and God made the promise and
[1:20:00] because he promised he will do it thank
[1:20:04] you lord
[1:20:06] you see I've heard it too many times
[1:20:08] that when someone is asked why are you
[1:20:10] in the message what is the message what
[1:20:13] makes the message different I'm sorry to
[1:20:15] say it but I've heard it so many times
[1:20:17] you people say well we you know we we
[1:20:20] way along he and graces and so forth I
[1:20:23] feel it since so many times that's not
[1:20:27] the message the message is not a dress
[1:20:30] code I mean if it was as easy as that
[1:20:33] well you know we would draw it right to
[1:20:35] what's these people Mike Bettes buttery
[1:20:37] for whatever the different ones and we
[1:20:38] say here's a few patterns just make sure
[1:20:40] you cover these and then the bride can
[1:20:42] all be ready because we can make our
[1:20:45] clothing according to those patterns
[1:20:48] yeah now don't give me unbalanced on
[1:20:51] this now wait till I'm finished okay but
[1:20:55] now my question is if it's about the
[1:20:57] dress code or if it's about how they
[1:20:59] look on the outside I mean then and and
[1:21:02] I don't like calling names but but
[1:21:04] moment consider wait what about the
[1:21:06] Brethren they I mean
[1:21:08] well most of them have long here and
[1:21:10] most of them wave feeling long dresses
[1:21:12] and so on and I mean and sometimes
[1:21:15] sometimes some of them look more modest
[1:21:17] than than some of the message ladies
[1:21:19] let's give that to thee there's a form
[1:21:22] of holiness there but does that make the
[1:21:24] message believers so I'll ask this
[1:21:30] question how do you know you're in the
[1:21:31] message I mean how do you know you get
[1:21:36] the message sticker book of approval you
[1:21:39] go to the mirror so you go with a long
[1:21:43] big to say okay I won't even
[1:21:46] give examples of you know because I
[1:21:47] might step in my own toes yeah but you
[1:21:51] know or do you go to your cupboard and
[1:21:53] go through yeah that one's okay in that
[1:21:55] one's okay that one's borderline failed
[1:21:58] today
[1:21:59] try again tomorrow I mean that's not
[1:22:01] what it's about so let's play it safe I
[1:22:05] mean let's play it safe let's say you're
[1:22:08] in the message when you have it in your
[1:22:10] head in your house
[1:22:12] okay you've got a Hoffmans head picture
[1:22:15] well we had a surprise a little while
[1:22:17] some Mormons visited us and when they
[1:22:19] walked into your house I said hey
[1:22:20] there's our picture I said no way
[1:22:22] there's our picture they've got the
[1:22:26] picture in their house
[1:22:27] so does that make vain be message
[1:22:29] believers no it doesn't well okay well
[1:22:33] we've got one up on them so let's put a
[1:22:34] cloud picture and a halo picture I mean
[1:22:36] they're not gonna do that right but the
[1:22:39] fact that we have the cloud and the
[1:22:40] hilar in the house doesn't make us
[1:22:41] Macy's believers I mean hallelujah I
[1:22:46] trust this is okay brother bean so how
[1:22:51] do we know when we are message believers
[1:22:55] there are so many people worth along
[1:22:59] here with the long graces where the
[1:23:01] pictures on the walls that claim to be
[1:23:03] in the message that setting misses
[1:23:04] churches that's not in the message that
[1:23:07] is not in the message well Brenda makes
[1:23:12] the statement he sees so it doesn't mean
[1:23:14] that you have to have a measuring stick
[1:23:16] in your church if you do this if you
[1:23:19] measure up to these rules if you measure
[1:23:20] up to that rule many times people will
[1:23:23] lie aside little things like that to
[1:23:25] belong to a church and the thing is
[1:23:27] still in their heart and they slip
[1:23:28] around and do it I mean but when a man
[1:23:32] has meet God's requirements and being
[1:23:34] born again of the Spirit of God those
[1:23:37] things that took care of his life he
[1:23:38] doesn't want to do God removes the
[1:23:43] thirst for those things and years the
[1:23:45] irony you might still sometimes fall and
[1:23:48] slip up and make mistakes but that
[1:23:50] doesn't take away from it I mean when
[1:23:51] God changes the thirst in your heart
[1:23:54] when God gives you the rebirth when God
[1:23:56] lives on the inside that makes you I
[1:23:58] mean a message believer yeah and and I
[1:24:03] trust this is okay brother Ben you can
[1:24:05] clean up afterwards I mean but you know
[1:24:07] you sometimes you have the question ask
[1:24:09] well I'd rather be a Christian than a
[1:24:11] message well what's the difference
[1:24:13] I mean hallelujah Paul wrote in the
[1:24:16] first church AG said this is the message
[1:24:19] that I have happened Paul was in the
[1:24:21] message and I believe Iranians was in
[1:24:23] the message and Martin was in the
[1:24:25] message in Colombo was in the message
[1:24:26] and all of them were in the message for
[1:24:27] their age I mean but we're the messages
[1:24:30] progress to now is where we are
[1:24:32] so in this eyes message equals Christian
[1:24:36] hallelujah and we've read in that was at
[1:24:39] that point that I have up there you can
[1:24:41] only be born again I think it was a
[1:24:42] previous code what you can only be born
[1:24:45] again if you were predestinated and
[1:24:48] here's the thing the difference between
[1:24:52] the foolish and wise virgins was that
[1:24:55] the wise had well in the lamps was born
[1:24:58] again only the bride Amy so what's the
[1:25:05] message then well it's the same message
[1:25:07] that Paul preached just now age-specific
[1:25:10] the earth day because in our day we have
[1:25:13] the benefit of hindsight we have the
[1:25:15] benefit where we can look back over
[1:25:16] 2,000 years and see God prophesied that
[1:25:19] there's gonna be an emphasis age and
[1:25:22] then there's gonna be a fire and it's
[1:25:23] gonna be or if it isn't then Smyrna I
[1:25:25] get them all mixed up now I mean but
[1:25:27] whatever you you get the point
[1:25:28] I mean God prophesied God prophesied how
[1:25:31] that the tree was gonna be eaten down
[1:25:33] will have for bugs and how God was gonna
[1:25:35] restore all of those things
[1:25:37] I mean God said to Daniel God said to
[1:25:40] John seal the book up but in this day
[1:25:43] he's taiking the seals off i mean in
[1:25:45] this thy god has revealed what god
[1:25:47] wanted for this day because this is the
[1:25:49] darkest of our this is in the midst of
[1:25:52] satan's Eden but this is now for the
[1:25:53] bride shall long time I mean rise shine
[1:25:56] the light is calm I mean the glory of
[1:25:59] the lord has risen upon thee I mean we
[1:26:01] walking in the light as he is the light
[1:26:03] I mean and though the world is in grace
[1:26:05] darkness we are living I mean in Goshen
[1:26:08] we're living in the light I mean they
[1:26:10] sometimes it's these arguments about you
[1:26:12] know people get upset when you say we in
[1:26:14] the bride age well I say it's because
[1:26:15] brother Branham see right but then they
[1:26:18] say we say we not in ladies here anymore
[1:26:20] no wrong that's not what we say the
[1:26:23] world around us this place we were to
[1:26:25] look at the
[1:26:26] in the dire in laodicea but I am NOT in
[1:26:29] lady CA I mean I'm not part of that
[1:26:32] anymore
[1:26:32] hallelujah because he asked me to come
[1:26:34] higher I mean into him what did he do he
[1:26:38] say to us Rebecca coming to my team girl
[1:26:40] I mean this stuff I want to share with
[1:26:43] you and she's saying well but but but
[1:26:45] Isaac I need to water my camels no
[1:26:47] forget the camels that's like this year
[1:26:50] I mean coming here I mean let me whisper
[1:26:53] things in your ear I mean hallelujah
[1:27:00] brother branham sees this I hope you
[1:27:04] don't mind me using so many quotes look
[1:27:07] at it in the world today we all this
[1:27:09] isms rise up watching all the cults of
[1:27:12] non meat-eating and Legolas that I've
[1:27:14] got to do so and so I've got to speak
[1:27:16] with tongues if I don't do this can you
[1:27:18] see that whole legalistic attitude I've
[1:27:20] got a speaking tongues I must think
[1:27:22] about so I need a measure I need a some
[1:27:24] rule something I can keep if I don't do
[1:27:28] this if I don't shout if I don't dance
[1:27:29] there's something wrong with me that's
[1:27:30] legalism we are saved by grace through
[1:27:32] faith nothing what you've done it's what
[1:27:36] he did he did what you could not do if
[1:27:39] you could have saved yourself then he
[1:27:42] wouldn't have had to die but he died in
[1:27:44] order to save you where you could not
[1:27:47] save yourself that old God dishonouring
[1:27:51] proverbs says god helps those who can't
[1:27:53] help things god helps those who help
[1:27:55] themselves
[1:27:56] they say that's just vice versa if you
[1:27:58] can help yourself god expects you to do
[1:28:00] it
[1:28:01] if you can save yourself then god says
[1:28:05] okay let me see troy i mean god helps
[1:28:11] those who can't help themselves and you
[1:28:12] can't help yourself to be saved so God
[1:28:14] by His grace saved you it's not him the
[1:28:20] growlithe or him that runneth the Bible
[1:28:21] says but God that shows mercy it's all
[1:28:24] by His grace Amy again brother Branham
[1:28:28] says oh god they need your hopes be
[1:28:31] built on nothing less than Jesus blood
[1:28:33] with righteousness of course that song
[1:28:35] all around the soul gives way then he's
[1:28:37] all our hope and stay foreign
[1:28:39] the solid rock I stand all other ground
[1:28:41] is sinking said to know him his life not
[1:28:45] to know the orders to know him the
[1:28:49] person I mean he's saying not to know
[1:28:52] the rules not to know the orders not to
[1:28:54] know what your church expects not to
[1:28:56] know you know think these boxes not to
[1:28:58] know go look in the mirror and say mmm
[1:29:00] is my hair long enough today is my
[1:29:02] whatever saying that's not a mark that
[1:29:06] you know him I mean that you in him I
[1:29:08] mean you must know him the person of God
[1:29:10] a man the best we can produce on our own
[1:29:16] is this men and women who profess to be
[1:29:19] Christians now this is there's something
[1:29:21] profound that I want to bring out here
[1:29:23] men and women who profess to be
[1:29:25] Christians and live like the world they
[1:29:27] say oh I belong to church what
[1:29:29] difference does it make it's a shadow of
[1:29:31] the deceiver from the Garden of Eden who
[1:29:34] pretended to be good who pretended to
[1:29:39] have light who pretended to have wisdom
[1:29:42] but was a deceiver whoa this is close
[1:29:47] and and I hope you forgive me for saying
[1:29:51] this who pretended to live the message
[1:29:53] of the air but was not born again the
[1:30:00] deceiver from the Garden of Eden the
[1:30:03] Pharisees are the same attitude and
[1:30:05] Jesus said you're of your father the
[1:30:07] devil in brother Adam takes it a step
[1:30:10] further it is now the mark of the devil
[1:30:14] is impersonation works not grace mazing
[1:30:20] statement the mark of the devil is
[1:30:25] impersonation works not grace the work
[1:30:29] shadow things to come Apocrypha going to
[1:30:31] church pretending to be a Christian and
[1:30:33] like I say Christian equals message in
[1:30:36] this time
[1:30:36] I mean pretending to be in the message
[1:30:38] living like the world having a phase
[1:30:40] with the world going out and acting like
[1:30:42] the world and so very close to both
[1:30:45] sides will be looking exactly deceive
[1:30:48] the very early so you can give both the
[1:30:52] maratti
[1:30:54] they look exactly the same but one on
[1:30:59] the inside is a Christian and the other
[1:31:00] one is not yeah I mean brother Ram
[1:31:04] speaks about these things how Esau was
[1:31:06] twice as as good as Jacob was I mean he
[1:31:11] speaks about how the devil is religious
[1:31:12] the Bible speaks about how the devil
[1:31:14] believes and he trembles I mean but God
[1:31:18] looks in the heart I mean and God saw
[1:31:21] that deceiving conniving Jacob I mean in
[1:31:24] his heart he wanted the birthright I
[1:31:26] mean why does brother branham hammer
[1:31:28] that whole principle of the birthright
[1:31:30] so much what's the issue with the
[1:31:31] birthright I mean in general the
[1:31:33] birthright speaks of inheritance
[1:31:35] I mean and we've got an inheritance I
[1:31:38] mean and I want a inheritance and in
[1:31:40] fact the base right the inheritance that
[1:31:43] the predestinated place that God has for
[1:31:46] me should be more important than the
[1:31:48] daily things should be more important
[1:31:51] than the layered easier that we have to
[1:31:52] walk into and we get up for work
[1:31:54] tomorrow morning should be more
[1:31:55] important I mean than anything on this
[1:31:58] earth I mean any responsibility anything
[1:32:01] that we hold dear anything that makes us
[1:32:02] excited it should be more important
[1:32:04] about than anything else I mean in
[1:32:07] Jacobs case I mean in Jacobs case that
[1:32:10] birthright was everything to him and it
[1:32:13] was even willing to lie in connive and
[1:32:15] steal and all sorts of things in order
[1:32:17] to get the birthright I mean but his
[1:32:19] attitude towards the birthright was
[1:32:20] right and God loved it and God loved him
[1:32:24] and he hated Esau I mean because his
[1:32:27] attitude towards the birthright was good
[1:32:30] and our spiritual birthright also is to
[1:32:34] bring forth the promised son you see we
[1:32:37] are in the same place that Mary was be
[1:32:40] it unto me according to your word I mean
[1:32:43] we read in Revelation chapter 12 about
[1:32:46] that woman who is wanting to bring forth
[1:32:47] the manchild bring forth the word in
[1:32:50] this age and so forth I don't want to
[1:32:51] spend time on those things now but by
[1:32:53] God's grace I mean we in such a position
[1:32:55] that we many times we mess I mean had
[1:32:58] just how much God has for us and I thank
[1:33:02] God for His grace I say it over and over
[1:33:05] I know I've seen it over and
[1:33:07] but I just cannot get it out enough I
[1:33:09] mean if it wasn't for God nobody could
[1:33:16] be saved it was only him who could step
[1:33:19] across them it was only God they could
[1:33:22] cross the bridge brother Ram cesium way
[1:33:25] back in the beginning when he seen that
[1:33:27] there were some people who was going to
[1:33:28] desire to be saved some people who was
[1:33:30] going to want to be saved some people
[1:33:32] who would be loyal in the heart I wanted
[1:33:34] to be saved then he's got to make a
[1:33:37] preparation for their salvation that's
[1:33:40] right or they will never be saved God
[1:33:45] has to and here's the amazing thing just
[1:33:49] to again speak about how we often
[1:33:51] measure ourselves this now we can't
[1:33:55] create timber but we can take timber
[1:33:56] after God has created it and make a
[1:33:58] house out of it because we offsprings of
[1:34:00] God's sons and daughters of God no
[1:34:02] matter how fallen we are still we have
[1:34:06] to recognize that we are sons and
[1:34:08] daughters of God in our fallen estate we
[1:34:11] star sons and daughters when Eve messed
[1:34:16] up when Adam decided to walk away
[1:34:18] because of his love for Eve whatever
[1:34:21] condition died when God still loved them
[1:34:23] I mean the lowest of lowest position
[1:34:26] that any son of son or daughter of God
[1:34:29] can ever get into I mean
[1:34:31] God still loved thee that woman that
[1:34:33] watched Jesus feet I mean there was a
[1:34:35] prostitute that had Seven Devils I think
[1:34:37] the Bible speaks about and so forth she
[1:34:39] was still a daughter of God when she was
[1:34:41] in the dirtiest place when she was in
[1:34:43] the vilest position when she was at the
[1:34:44] lowest point in her life she was still a
[1:34:46] daughter of God I mean she didn't
[1:34:49] suddenly become like I said in that
[1:34:50] previous quote I mean she didn't
[1:34:52] suddenly become a daughter we don't
[1:34:53] suddenly become a son or daughter I mean
[1:34:55] the day that we are reborn I mean the
[1:34:57] rebirth just manifests what God already
[1:35:00] knew I mean we were already a son we
[1:35:02] were already a daughter we were already
[1:35:03] a part of God we were already an
[1:35:05] attribute that God saw before the
[1:35:07] foundation of the earth and that is
[1:35:09] because of that I mean that God brings
[1:35:11] us to the position I mean we we get a
[1:35:13] revelation of who we are we can lure us
[1:35:17] into that thing by His grace
[1:35:20] and he's st. easily easier way how did
[1:35:22] you become Christians because you see it
[1:35:24] I want to become a Christian because
[1:35:26] that you saw God with tears no obviously
[1:35:29] not because God by grace called you
[1:35:32] that's right not because you saw him
[1:35:34] because he sought you I mean we read
[1:35:41] about Moses in the Bible and we read
[1:35:44] about how how he studied hard and he you
[1:35:47] know learnt all the skills of the
[1:35:48] Egyptians and I mean he learned
[1:35:50] everything he could and and probably I
[1:35:53] would say that his mother probably told
[1:35:54] him from a young age that you remember
[1:35:56] she she raised him for the first few
[1:35:58] years
[1:35:58] she probably imprinted in his heart
[1:36:00] remember use a deliverer God is gonna
[1:36:02] use you one day and so forth and Moses
[1:36:05] just like we would all do I mean started
[1:36:08] making plans how he was going to deliver
[1:36:09] the people they started making plans how
[1:36:12] on earth am I gonna do this and Moses
[1:36:15] after getting all the knowledge he could
[1:36:17] and studying hard and putting all the
[1:36:18] effort in he could it failed it flopped
[1:36:21] and it all amounted to nothing
[1:36:24] all he could show for all that effort
[1:36:26] was one date Egyptian failed miserably
[1:36:29] but five minutes in the presence of God
[1:36:35] quickened the seed that was in
[1:36:38] hallelujah I mean when God finally meet
[1:36:41] him when God came across his path I mean
[1:36:44] then that five minutes brother Ramses
[1:36:46] meant all more than all the teaching
[1:36:48] that I ever had meant more than all the
[1:36:50] knowledge that he gained went meant more
[1:36:52] than all the effort that he putting all
[1:36:53] the hard work and hard slog and
[1:36:55] dedication and effort and wanted to help
[1:36:57] all of that stuff I mean just went by
[1:37:01] the wayside because now God had met him
[1:37:03] in our God made that little seed in
[1:37:05] Moses life alive I mean probably at the
[1:37:10] point we had given up when you had
[1:37:12] stopped thinking about Egypt when he
[1:37:15] didn't have any any desire possibly even
[1:37:17] to do anything for you no he probably
[1:37:20] just he thought maybe that was just not
[1:37:23] me maybe my mum was wrong maybe maybe
[1:37:26] they maybe it wasn't an angel maybe he
[1:37:29] could have said all sorts of maybes
[1:37:30] maybes maybes like we often do sometimes
[1:37:33] teenagers quite often do we do I fit
[1:37:36] what am i what am I supposed to do you
[1:37:39] know where do I belong and all those
[1:37:40] kind of things I mean the reality is
[1:37:42] from God's perspective he was still the
[1:37:45] deliverer from God's perspective he was
[1:37:47] still the Savior
[1:37:48] I mean from God's perspective everything
[1:37:51] was going right amen everything was
[1:37:54] going right and God at the appropriate
[1:37:57] time God came across his path guard
[1:37:59] meeting and guarding called Moses Moses
[1:38:02] we are you Amy
[1:38:03] it wasn't Moses calling God it was God
[1:38:06] calling so I can ask the question you
[1:38:12] believe you remember of the bride I mean
[1:38:18] but many times we try to do God's work
[1:38:22] for him I mean we tried to fix ourselves
[1:38:26] we try to make the word come to pass we
[1:38:30] try to fix our families we tried to fix
[1:38:32] the people around us and all we do is we
[1:38:35] make a maze all we can show for it is or
[1:38:38] not one date Egyptian but one might be
[1:38:40] spiritually dead New Zeeland the rule or
[1:38:43] whatever I mean but God has a perfect
[1:38:47] time and God has a perfect plan for each
[1:38:49] son and each daughter and I believe it's
[1:38:53] time we trust God more these things have
[1:38:56] really spoken to my heart recently
[1:38:58] I mean sometimes sometimes we want to
[1:39:03] apply the humanistic natural things way
[1:39:06] too much sometimes we need to allow God
[1:39:10] I mean to do the supernatural and and
[1:39:14] and don't get me wrong it's not meeting
[1:39:16] God halfway that's not at all what I'm
[1:39:18] trying to say but what I believe we
[1:39:21] should do is we should just do what the
[1:39:23] word sees in simplicity but in faith
[1:39:26] trusting God brother brother Chad made a
[1:39:30] statement that for me personally was
[1:39:32] profound a while ago in wind when he
[1:39:34] said that was how he said he always had
[1:39:40] the mindset inand I'm putting it in my
[1:39:42] own words and forgive me if I if I
[1:39:43] presented slightly wrong but but he
[1:39:46] always so
[1:39:47] well you know when you have to do child
[1:39:49] training he couldn't understand that you
[1:39:52] know he would spank and then he would
[1:39:53] spank harder and that he would spank
[1:39:55] more regularly and and and so forth and
[1:39:58] he didn't have the desire to fix it
[1:39:59] obviously he was not you know smacking
[1:40:01] hard enough but that's not what it's
[1:40:04] about
[1:40:04] it is actually just following what the
[1:40:07] word sees and trusting God to do the
[1:40:10] change I mean so it doesn't mean smooth
[1:40:12] means pray harder when you smack and say
[1:40:15] god I'm doing this according to your
[1:40:17] word and we should do that same
[1:40:19] principle with everything in our lives I
[1:40:21] mean just do the bit that God gave us to
[1:40:24] do I mean but not God I meet you halfway
[1:40:26] god I've done all that you know God you
[1:40:28] said I mean it's nothing like that I
[1:40:31] mean it is just I mean following day to
[1:40:35] day what God puts across our path and
[1:40:37] trusting him and in faith just leaving
[1:40:39] the results up to God we said well the
[1:40:44] dilemma brothers and sisters that God
[1:40:46] requires us to be perfect but at the
[1:40:50] same time that God requires us to be
[1:40:52] perfect it is impossible for us to be
[1:40:54] perfect and there's many places where
[1:40:57] brother Graham speaks about these things
[1:40:58] I'm just gonna see this one haven't you
[1:41:02] heard many times the people say oh
[1:41:03] there's none perfect that's right you
[1:41:06] can't be perfect in the sight of your
[1:41:08] fellow man but you've got to be perfect
[1:41:10] or you'll never go to heaven I mean
[1:41:13] that's right so that leaves you in a
[1:41:15] dilemma the Bible says Jesus speaking in
[1:41:17] the Beatitudes Matthew said be therefore
[1:41:20] perfect even as your father in heaven is
[1:41:22] perfect how can we ever be perfect like
[1:41:24] that how can we ever meet that I mean
[1:41:29] how can we ever by putting fault by
[1:41:31] putting effort by working hard I mean by
[1:41:33] dedicating ourselves more by doing
[1:41:35] anything be as perfect as God is be
[1:41:39] therefore perfect even as your father in
[1:41:41] heaven is perfect you've got to be just
[1:41:43] as perfect as God is or you lost well if
[1:41:47] we look at it humanistically it is okay
[1:41:49] god I'm done I give up
[1:41:52] I'm not gonna make it now one little
[1:41:56] mistake and you lost one little flap of
[1:41:58] the eye and you're gone cause nothing
[1:42:00] can enter
[1:42:01] to those places but perfect now if the
[1:42:04] legalist only quotes that portion of the
[1:42:06] scripture then we all in trouble I
[1:42:08] praise God ow ELISA gave us a balanced
[1:42:12] approach God put Satan up day one time
[1:42:15] as an angel which he was the son of the
[1:42:17] morning and he took the good things of
[1:42:18] God and perverted them into evil God
[1:42:21] sure that nothing will end today that'll
[1:42:23] ever do it again I mean he's still
[1:42:25] making the point we need to be perfect I
[1:42:28] mean he says now you've got to be
[1:42:29] perfect Jesus says be therefore perfect
[1:42:32] even if you God father in heaven is
[1:42:34] perfect now how are you going to be when
[1:42:36] you continually sinning when you're
[1:42:38] continually doing what's wrong now this
[1:42:40] will kind of put a little kink in the
[1:42:42] legalist but notice is this it isn't
[1:42:45] what you do it's what God has done it's
[1:42:50] not what you do it's what he done see
[1:42:52] you can't be perfect you can't be in
[1:42:56] yourself but in Christ you are perfect
[1:43:01] you're not trusting in your own good
[1:43:03] works or your own church you belong to
[1:43:05] but you're trusting in the shed blood of
[1:43:07] the Lord Jesus there you are that's what
[1:43:11] makes you perfect
[1:43:12] that's what anchors your faith what
[1:43:15] makes you perfect his perfection is
[1:43:18] attributed to you his righteousness is
[1:43:23] attributed to you when God is saying
[1:43:25] show me your righteousness are you gonna
[1:43:28] be good enough you just take his
[1:43:30] righteousness and show it back to you I
[1:43:32] mean you can't show him your
[1:43:34] unrighteousness because you have none I
[1:43:36] mean I have none let me put it on myself
[1:43:39] maybe you good I don't but I am NOT I
[1:43:41] mean we can't show back to God my
[1:43:44] righteousness I mean I have nothing but
[1:43:47] we can take his righteousness and
[1:43:48] present it right straight back to him
[1:43:50] and God wants that I mean and what God
[1:43:53] is saying when we do that is that's my
[1:43:55] boy that's my girl you get what I'm
[1:43:57] saying
[1:43:58] I mean I remember now he's whispering in
[1:44:00] the taint and he's saying to his dear
[1:44:03] wife his beloved his to his dove in the
[1:44:05] thing he's saying to her this I want you
[1:44:08] to get I chose you but
[1:44:13] god there's so many more beautiful woman
[1:44:15] that I chose you I mean but god I can't
[1:44:20] do this as good as that person and I
[1:44:21] can't do that and I don't have so many
[1:44:23] talents I chose you are you criticizing
[1:44:25] my taste I chose you
[1:44:28] I mean God is weak we so often present
[1:44:31] to God God I fail you you and God I fail
[1:44:33] you today and God girl just get over it
[1:44:37] I mean it's like a wife going to a
[1:44:39] husband oh I wish I could be a bit of
[1:44:41] cooking I love you cooking because I
[1:44:43] love you I mean I mean my one
[1:44:46] sister-in-law her husband always hit
[1:44:48] when when they got married she even
[1:44:50] burnt the salad Amen but he loved her I
[1:44:53] mean he doesn't love her any less thanks
[1:44:57] God it's a love relationship and that's
[1:45:01] the point I want to start getting to I
[1:45:03] mean it's a love relationship and we
[1:45:06] must judge it we Sammy I think we need
[1:45:09] to validate yourselves beside me I think
[1:45:11] we need to prove ourselves to God we
[1:45:14] Sammy I think we need to kind of meet
[1:45:15] him halfway or all sorts of stuff like
[1:45:18] that that's not how God thinks that's
[1:45:20] not how God ever intended it I mean we
[1:45:23] thank God that the lamb took our place
[1:45:25] that the blood was shed and the Bible
[1:45:27] said in the Old Testament had that lamb
[1:45:29] had to be perfect and he was I mean the
[1:45:31] perfect lambs blood was shed for us I
[1:45:34] mean and that lamb is now presented back
[1:45:36] to God I mean and God has accepted he I
[1:45:39] mean even though we may fall we are
[1:45:41] still perfect even when we make mistakes
[1:45:43] we are still perfect through his
[1:45:45] perspective not we have fellow man pray
[1:45:48] maybe not through your own I mean but
[1:45:50] through his perspective we are brother
[1:45:53] Ramsay's they straps all along the road
[1:45:55] sure the devil will cause you to stumble
[1:45:56] and you say I didn't mean to do that
[1:45:59] God you know it you stole perfect well
[1:46:03] hang on you've just stumbled isn't they
[1:46:06] like you know sometimes when you have
[1:46:07] medication and stuff there's an
[1:46:09] exclusion period after that you know God
[1:46:11] I mean three days of penance and then I
[1:46:13] should be right no nothing at all I mean
[1:46:16] hallelujah
[1:46:17] I've just messed up but you still
[1:46:18] perfect I mean hell because you your
[1:46:22] heart is right with God and win-win that
[1:46:24] conviction in your heart comes you
[1:46:26] immediately go
[1:46:27] to God and say God I'm sorry I shouldn't
[1:46:29] have said my attitude to that brother
[1:46:31] was wrong my attitude to that person was
[1:46:33] wrong I mean my my response to the
[1:46:35] situation was wrong god I'm sorry please
[1:46:37] forgive me and he does and it's gone and
[1:46:39] it's immediately gone and wiped out as
[1:46:41] if it never happened I mean is that
[1:46:44] instance way with someone came on the
[1:46:45] platform and she was really worried
[1:46:49] because they were I can't remember what
[1:46:51] was wrong some some attribute of sin in
[1:46:54] your life and as you were standing in
[1:46:56] the queue to get prayed my brother
[1:46:57] branham she was really worried that he
[1:46:59] was going to call that thing out in her
[1:47:00] life and she prayed in the line there
[1:47:02] and then and she committed it to God I
[1:47:05] mean she came in front of the Prophet he
[1:47:07] said nothing about it and I think she
[1:47:09] asked him ask two words if I remember
[1:47:10] the story right and he asked then and
[1:47:12] and he said to it when you confess to
[1:47:14] God it's gone
[1:47:15] God doesn't even remember it according
[1:47:17] to according to God as as if you never
[1:47:19] done it I mean and that's one of the
[1:47:21] things I mean no no church at the no
[1:47:26] denomination at thee has any concept of
[1:47:29] being justified it's one of the things
[1:47:32] that he whispered to our ears through
[1:47:34] our ELISA
[1:47:35] I mean Wade says if we never done it in
[1:47:38] the first place I mean my brother random
[1:47:40] ascribes it's so beautifully if if if
[1:47:42] you heard that someone was drinking and
[1:47:44] then you go to them and you say I heard
[1:47:45] you were drinking I forgive you and I
[1:47:47] say no you had it wrong I never did it I
[1:47:50] mean I wasn't there you got your
[1:47:52] information wrong I never did it I mean
[1:47:54] that's how clean we are before God and
[1:47:56] like I said it there's no exclusion
[1:47:58] period I mean there's no way three days
[1:48:00] and then it's gone when you give it to
[1:48:02] God it's gone I mean immediately I mean
[1:48:06] it's clean as if you never did it in the
[1:48:08] first place and I thank God for justify
[1:48:12] Alleluia justify Amen God requires
[1:48:18] perfection but we can never be perfect
[1:48:21] in ourselves I mean perfection is only
[1:48:24] in him but he's looking for his birth
[1:48:26] perfection so these are the things he's
[1:48:30] whispering to us in the tenth most
[1:48:32] denominations don't believe in election
[1:48:35] anymore most denominations don't accept
[1:48:37] these things what they do is they grab
[1:48:40] grace
[1:48:40] they make a disgrace of it I mean and I
[1:48:43] run with that in the wrong direction but
[1:48:46] I need these things to be solid in your
[1:48:48] mind before I move on to the next part
[1:48:50] now we can do nothing to increase God we
[1:48:54] can do nothing to purchase our salvation
[1:48:57] we can do nothing I mean to meet God
[1:48:59] halfway
[1:49:00] hallelujah remember now God is
[1:49:05] expressing a nice thing to his beloved
[1:49:06] bride and he's saying my fair one my
[1:49:09] dove
[1:49:10] I chose you and you are good enough for
[1:49:14] me I'm not looking at your works I'm not
[1:49:18] looking at mice or anything you do I'm
[1:49:21] looking at my sacrifice on Calvary but
[1:49:26] and here's the but a very important and
[1:49:31] big but there is an attitude that we
[1:49:35] have there's a attitude way we can own
[1:49:39] that we can only really find when we
[1:49:43] look at our Isaac through eyes of love
[1:49:45] remember one of those two principles
[1:49:47] everything that gets sitting that
[1:49:48] Tinky's through eyes of love brother
[1:49:52] branham expresses at the I don't know
[1:49:54] for me just the Prophet as a way of
[1:49:56] expressing these things like no one else
[1:49:58] can I want to hear him say it was well
[1:50:01] done my good and faithful servant I want
[1:50:03] to show you my appreciation now listen
[1:50:06] to this and he brings it to relationship
[1:50:08] now he sees my poor little old
[1:50:09] gray-headed wife how I would love to do
[1:50:13] something for her that I know she likes
[1:50:15] because I love her
[1:50:18] he sees because of my love because of my
[1:50:21] relationship with so I want to do
[1:50:22] something for her I'm not buying a love
[1:50:25] but I love her already I mean because I
[1:50:28] love her and I know she loves me and if
[1:50:30] I do that for my wife in the human love
[1:50:32] what do I have to do to know that God by
[1:50:35] grace before the foundation of the world
[1:50:36] seen me as a poor little sinner
[1:50:38] staggering and was going to hell and
[1:50:40] couldn't help it and he for dined me and
[1:50:43] put my name in the Lamb's Book of Life
[1:50:44] before the foundation of the world and
[1:50:46] what he's saying brothers and sisters is
[1:50:48] because of his love because of what he's
[1:50:50] done for me I want to do things that I
[1:50:52] know he loves
[1:50:54] I mean it's not a disgrace it's not just
[1:50:58] tramping on the world it's not just
[1:51:01] ignoring the things that God revealed to
[1:51:03] us through the Prophet he wants us to do
[1:51:07] those things through the eyes of love
[1:51:08] because we're loving to his beloved now
[1:51:13] I believe he whispers he's perspective
[1:51:16] he's balanced I mean I believe that's
[1:51:21] all happening now under the Seventh Seal
[1:51:23] it's all part and parcel of it so now I
[1:51:28] want to go back to that opening
[1:51:30] Scripture we read about those Gentile
[1:51:32] warriors so we read about how those
[1:51:35] three Gentile warriors I mean so now I
[1:51:37] want you just to picture this now so
[1:51:39] Bethlem is surrounded and these brother
[1:51:41] Ram speaks about 15 miles of Philistines
[1:51:44] all around the city and and David and
[1:51:48] he's worried as they are they are
[1:51:49] somewhere else
[1:51:50] and David just expresses an embroidery
[1:51:52] probably just said under his breath I
[1:51:54] just wish I have some water this old you
[1:51:58] know water in my old goat skin is so
[1:52:00] warm and I'd love to get some of that
[1:52:04] water from Beth Lee he not for a moment
[1:52:07] instructed nobody to do nothing I mean
[1:52:11] he did not put pressure on him he didn't
[1:52:13] play games with him I mean but the
[1:52:17] Prophet sees not working
[1:52:23] can you flick on to the next slide
[1:52:25] please he had some servants day that my
[1:52:29] just the least of his desires was a
[1:52:32] command I want to ask you this the
[1:52:36] David's threatening no I mean he didn't
[1:52:39] even ask me
[1:52:40] it just expressed this is what I want I
[1:52:43] mean did he put fear on them that he
[1:52:46] play mental games with him if you don't
[1:52:50] go to base Liam you don't really love me
[1:52:52] that sounds like the Lila the loyalists
[1:52:56] are the same you don't really love me I
[1:52:59] want to kill you but you don't want to
[1:53:00] give me the secret I mean that's devil's
[1:53:04] manipulation games God doesn't play
[1:53:06] manipulation guy
[1:53:07] God is just putting an LP this is my
[1:53:10] desire hallelujah and there is three
[1:53:14] warriors I mean why did they go
[1:53:16] why did they go all those 15 miles
[1:53:18] through thousands of Philistines
[1:53:20] they could have died and they were
[1:53:22] willing to give their lives why because
[1:53:26] they loved him because it was David who
[1:53:28] asked it wasn't man's opinion it wasn't
[1:53:31] someone else playing mind games it
[1:53:33] wasn't the leader of the army that said
[1:53:34] to him
[1:53:35] boys if you really like your king you
[1:53:36] would do this they just did it because
[1:53:38] he expressed the desire I mean and that
[1:53:42] is part of what's being spoken in the
[1:53:44] state in our day under the Seventh Seal
[1:53:46] I mean I want you to notice it wasn't
[1:53:50] the command to them just as long as it
[1:53:55] suited them it was a command to them
[1:53:57] because they loved David they were all
[1:54:01] in butanol and I believe those three
[1:54:04] Gentile warriors is an exact type of
[1:54:06] this Gentile bride in our day sometimes
[1:54:10] we make the statement if it takes the
[1:54:11] skin off my back I will do this and let
[1:54:13] the other those three they meant it when
[1:54:15] they said it if it takes my life I'm
[1:54:18] gonna get water for David I'm gonna get
[1:54:21] water for my king I mean David wants a
[1:54:24] drink and I love him and I want to do
[1:54:26] everything to give him what his desires
[1:54:28] are I mean not by fear not because I'm
[1:54:32] forced not because I mean not because
[1:54:34] someone is preaching me and holding me
[1:54:36] over hell every Sunday
[1:54:37] I mean but I love him I mean I want to
[1:54:40] do what he says
[1:54:41] I loved him and because I loved him I
[1:54:44] wanted to fulfill his desires even if it
[1:54:46] meant they death so what does it mean to
[1:54:50] love the Lord I mean what does it mean
[1:54:53] to love the Lord with all and then so as
[1:54:55] the Bible speaks about does it mean that
[1:54:57] we desire to be with him and spend time
[1:55:00] with him well that's part of me I mean
[1:55:04] but because of his headship over us
[1:55:07] genuine love for him for Mica's do his
[1:55:10] will
[1:55:11] where do we find these well well easy in
[1:55:15] the Bible and in the message and it's
[1:55:18] all the Word of God
[1:55:20] what's the result when we love him we do
[1:55:23] what he says and I trust that you get
[1:55:28] the whole picture now because if you
[1:55:30] quite only the first half of the sermon
[1:55:32] you wrong if you quote only the second
[1:55:34] half of the sermon you're wrong but
[1:55:36] because we love him because it's only by
[1:55:40] grace we also do what he says not
[1:55:45] because of any other reason but because
[1:55:47] we love it so we can argue and I know
[1:55:51] I'm running a little bit of here for
[1:55:52] myself and I won't be too much longer
[1:55:54] but we can argue so easily well you know
[1:55:57] shouldn't everyone out they have long
[1:56:00] hair and long Grace's and so forth well
[1:56:02] if everyone had that same love for God
[1:56:04] they would but the things that are
[1:56:07] spoken is for you and me I mean the
[1:56:09] things that is she is under the Seventh
[1:56:11] Seal in this little little building in
[1:56:14] the team whatever you want to call it I
[1:56:15] mean it's for us and it's not for us to
[1:56:20] judge the world and criticize them and
[1:56:22] look at all the you know look at how bad
[1:56:23] they are understand that he's saying to
[1:56:25] you do you love me do you love me
[1:56:30] scripture is full of examples and I
[1:56:32] don't have time to quote them so I'm
[1:56:33] just gonna bring a New Testament example
[1:56:35] but I'll just quickly refer it in the
[1:56:37] Old Testament I mean there's so many so
[1:56:39] many places we it actually makes the
[1:56:41] statement like this you have to love me
[1:56:44] and do my commandments all those who
[1:56:46] love me and do my Commandments you see
[1:56:48] those things are linked together because
[1:56:50] if you genuinely love God you will do
[1:56:52] what he says and it will be a
[1:56:53] commandment to you God is not interested
[1:56:55] in a wolf cracking relationship where he
[1:56:58] has to boss his wife around to get it to
[1:57:00] move every time he wants her to move
[1:57:02] come on get off your fat backside and do
[1:57:05] something for me that's not what God is
[1:57:06] saying I'm sorry if that offends anyone
[1:57:08] but the principle is I mean expressing
[1:57:12] his heart and this girl's so lousy I
[1:57:15] mean that she can't do enough for him I
[1:57:17] mean that she wants to do what God wants
[1:57:19] once done I mean that she wants to be a
[1:57:23] vessel in his head she in his hand she
[1:57:24] wants to be used of him so in the New
[1:57:27] Testament Jesus makes the statement he
[1:57:29] says if you love me keep my Commandments
[1:57:31] now like I said
[1:57:33] God doesn't play mind games this is not
[1:57:35] the Delilah kind of if you love me
[1:57:38] I mean God does not have any bad
[1:57:40] intention with that God just throws his
[1:57:43] word out and he's making the statement
[1:57:45] if you love me
[1:57:47] he will do what my word sees Jesus could
[1:57:52] just as well have said if you say you
[1:57:54] love me and you don't do what my word
[1:57:56] says then you prove yourself that you
[1:57:59] lying or that you are deceived and I
[1:58:05] want you to know something else Jesus
[1:58:07] did this and he led by example
[1:58:09] he makes the statement he says but that
[1:58:11] the world might know that I love the
[1:58:13] father and as the father gave me
[1:58:16] commandment even so did I do you see
[1:58:22] even his relationship was like that I
[1:58:25] mean because of his love for the father
[1:58:29] because of his love for the word I mean
[1:58:32] he did what the would see I mean love
[1:58:36] and Commandments goes hand in hand Jesus
[1:58:41] loved the father and followed these
[1:58:43] Commandments but sometimes like I said
[1:58:46] sometimes people try to manipulate us if
[1:58:49] you loved me you would have picked up
[1:58:51] the wood outside if you loved me you
[1:58:53] would have the sensor that's
[1:58:55] manipulation
[1:58:56] I mean God doesn't do that but God puts
[1:59:00] his word out there knowing that his
[1:59:01] bride will submit because she's
[1:59:03] predestinated to submit I mean Jesus
[1:59:08] wasn't manipulated by the father Jesus
[1:59:10] wasn't trapped by the father God guarded
[1:59:13] and God didn't manipulate things you
[1:59:15] know in a nasty humanistic white outside
[1:59:18] this I mean I mean to get Jesus to do
[1:59:21] the things against his own world he
[1:59:23] totally by his own will submitted
[1:59:25] himself to the world he went to the
[1:59:26] cross brother Ram sees what held him to
[1:59:28] the cross was his love for us his love
[1:59:31] for the other attributes Alleluia and we
[1:59:36] are part of the word now of course we
[1:59:39] cannot speak about these things without
[1:59:41] just briefly touching on headship also
[1:59:43] so I'll just say this in this under the
[1:59:46] seventh you
[1:59:47] understand I mean we we know that
[1:59:49] brother on speaks about the threefold
[1:59:51] purpose and how the second purpose is
[1:59:53] God kidding getting preeminence in the
[1:59:55] boy that that whole principle of God
[1:59:59] getting preeminence in our lives is this
[2:00:02] woman by choice submitting herself
[2:00:04] completely to the will of the Father
[2:00:07] hit ship is so entrenched in our
[2:00:10] relationship with God and that means
[2:00:14] that we count his word above our own
[2:00:15] ideas above our own desires above the
[2:00:18] things that's important to us you
[2:00:19] speaking above our own judgments above
[2:00:22] our own hurts and pain I mean above our
[2:00:24] own excuses this word takes first place
[2:00:27] in our lives and I believe God will
[2:00:30] bless us and even in the natural the
[2:00:32] Bible speaks about how honoring your
[2:00:34] father and your mother's is the
[2:00:35] commandment with a blessing over with it
[2:00:37] with a promise and so forth I mean as
[2:00:39] such an important principle for God to
[2:00:41] fully submit to him and what if you feel
[2:00:45] that the word is just a booth well that
[2:00:50] means it just hasn't revealed himself to
[2:00:52] you yet but when you meet Isaac
[2:00:56] hallelujah
[2:00:57] then your attitude to the word changes
[2:01:00] significantly and I just go back to that
[2:01:04] scripture that I read a little portion
[2:01:06] of and just as we're starting to wind
[2:01:08] down now jesus said if you love me keep
[2:01:11] my Commandments and then in verse 26 at
[2:01:13] that day you shall know that I am in my
[2:01:14] father and you in me and I in you he
[2:01:18] that hath my Commandments and keepeth
[2:01:20] them he it is that loveth me and he that
[2:01:23] loveth me shall be loved of my father
[2:01:25] and I will love him and will manifest
[2:01:27] myself to him
[2:01:29] you see if we look at this realistically
[2:01:32] I mean we can apply it all to rules
[2:01:35] rules rules if we look at it Calvinistic
[2:01:38] lee we can just look at the gray spot
[2:01:41] but the reality is the balances both
[2:01:43] sides together jesus said unto him not
[2:01:48] Iscariot Lord how is it that that will
[2:01:50] make myself known and to us a note on to
[2:01:51] the world jesus answered and said unto
[2:01:53] him if a man love me he will keep my
[2:01:55] words and my father will love him and we
[2:01:58] will come unto him and make our abode
[2:01:59] with him he that
[2:02:01] loveth me not keepeth not my sayings and
[2:02:03] the word which you hear is not mine but
[2:02:06] the fathers which sent me and it's so
[2:02:08] beautiful hair is expressing I love the
[2:02:10] father and therefore his word is
[2:02:12] everything from and I expressed the
[2:02:15] words through my life and you and I
[2:02:17] should be able to say exactly the same
[2:02:18] thing I mean when you hear my words you
[2:02:21] hear the father's words because I love
[2:02:23] the father and what the father's opinion
[2:02:25] is is my opinion I don't have an opinion
[2:02:28] of my own I submitted fully to his
[2:02:30] opinion you see the message of the
[2:02:34] gospel the good news however you wanted
[2:02:37] to call it I mean is the revelation of
[2:02:40] the mind of God and I believe in NSS I
[2:02:44] am winding down so just be with bear
[2:02:46] with me for a couple minutes I believe
[2:02:49] that under the Seventh Seal God is
[2:02:53] bearing or God is opening himself up
[2:02:56] fully and indistinct under the Seventh
[2:03:00] Seal God is revealing to himself to us
[2:03:05] the doctrine absolutely
[2:03:10] but is it just the doctrine no we enjoy
[2:03:14] the doctor me and enjoy to see how that
[2:03:17] the Bible and Falls and how the
[2:03:18] mysteries are revealed we enjoy that we
[2:03:20] might for that we eagles I mean but it's
[2:03:24] not only that it's also an expression of
[2:03:27] who he is but it's not only that it's
[2:03:32] also an expression of his attributes I
[2:03:34] mean which is who we are but it's not
[2:03:38] only that we want the whole package we
[2:03:40] want everything of him because what
[2:03:42] Rebecca didn't want just this part of
[2:03:44] Isaac she wanted everything she's saying
[2:03:46] tell me more tell me more I mean give me
[2:03:49] everything so it's also an expression of
[2:03:53] what God wants done with his word and
[2:03:56] you know I want you to mark this that or
[2:03:59] notice this that wind brother been and
[2:04:02] picked up his spin and and and wrote one
[2:04:04] of the things that was said was she will
[2:04:07] know what he wants done with his word
[2:04:09] and done is an action
[2:04:13] something that needs to be done some
[2:04:17] energy spent you see when God thought
[2:04:20] about our conduct addressing our daily
[2:04:22] lives that was also in God's mind and
[2:04:25] when God is revealing himself under the
[2:04:28] Seventh Seal
[2:04:29] I mean he's also revealing to us how we
[2:04:31] feel about certain things but his
[2:04:33] desires are for our conduct for church
[2:04:36] order for all those things I mean and
[2:04:38] when it was time for God to reveal his
[2:04:40] mind fully in this age which I believe
[2:04:42] it is I mean God included those things
[2:04:46] in what he revealed that's why God sent
[2:04:49] us a prophet who could tell us that
[2:04:51] certain things should be done in certain
[2:04:53] ways and so on I'll leave the detail of
[2:04:55] that I don't feel as my place do you say
[2:04:58] that in another church but as God
[2:05:01] revealed through the Prophet I mean the
[2:05:03] ABCs so to speak the do's and don'ts so
[2:05:05] to speak I mean they should not be
[2:05:07] received by us as do's and don'ts
[2:05:10] I should be received by us as this is
[2:05:13] what my husband who I love with all my
[2:05:15] heart desires
[2:05:19] and maybe some of you think I'm in nut
[2:05:23] case when I say this but those things
[2:05:25] are just as glorious as the revelation
[2:05:27] of the seven see as the revelation of
[2:05:30] the seven thunders a revelation of how
[2:05:32] these things fit together of the
[2:05:34] revelation to see how the seven Church
[2:05:35] ages flowed over the last few thousand
[2:05:37] years
[2:05:38] we love the doctrine we love the deep
[2:05:41] things of God but a son and daughter of
[2:05:43] God also loves a conduct order and
[2:05:46] doctrine because it's all part and
[2:05:48] parcel of the same word and he is the
[2:05:51] word so I just want to say in closing
[2:05:55] now these things are not for the other
[2:05:59] woman it's not for the other girls
[2:06:02] outside the teenth
[2:06:03] it's not for ladies hear these things is
[2:06:07] for the bride and and maybe I can use
[2:06:10] this terminology and I hope this doesn't
[2:06:12] throw anyone will confuse anyone but in
[2:06:14] the bride age and also it this way when
[2:06:18] you are in Christ when you have come
[2:06:20] into him I mean part of what he reveals
[2:06:23] is what He desires for us to
[2:06:26] to live by everyday I trust these things
[2:06:29] work I've rather been feel free to
[2:06:30] correct missing like I always say sticky
[2:06:33] oh pastor I mean goddess God has given
[2:06:36] him to bring you through and trust that
[2:06:40] something will say that was a blessing
[2:06:42] to you this morning let's stand together
[2:06:43] and we pray our most precious and loving
[2:07:00] Heavenly Father
