[25:46] may we just have a very precious time in
[25:49] your presence tonight believe in Jesus
[25:50] Christ's name Lord we want to ask these
[25:52] things
[25:53] amen amen god bless you thank you
[25:56] musicians amen trusty ones well tonight
[26:02] if you've got your Bibles handy let's
[26:05] turn to seeking Corinthians chapter 10
[26:12] see convenes 10 and we are continuing on
[26:16] our thought of a letter C in church age
[26:19] but I want to kind of it's a zoom into
[26:22] one particular thing here so seeking
[26:27] synchron's 10 and 3 verses 3 and 5 it
[26:35] says here
[26:40] for though we walk in the flesh so
[26:43] second Corinthians 10 and verse 3 for
[26:48] though we walk in the flesh we do not
[26:51] war after the flesh for the weapons of
[26:54] our warfare are not carnal but mighty
[26:56] through God to the pulling down of
[26:58] strongholds casting down imaginations
[27:00] and every high thing that exalts itself
[27:05] against the knowledge of God and
[27:07] bringing into captivity every thought to
[27:10] the obedience of Christ amen may the
[27:14] Lord bless us would you may have your
[27:16] seats
[27:16] this evening and I want to you know we
[27:19] we went through Sunday about revelations
[27:22] 9 and the bottomless pit opening and
[27:24] Hell coming upon the earth but then also
[27:26] the mighty angel the Lord Jesus coming
[27:28] down to anoint has you know has in time
[27:31] people but we see there we're not going
[27:33] to read it but you know we read there in
[27:34] Revelations 9 that that there's a you
[27:37] know that you know that demon power that
[27:39] came out upon the earth was to torment
[27:41] those who had not the seal of God on
[27:42] their forehead so I could say just from
[27:44] that as a bit of a context that the
[27:46] battle and the mind is far greater and
[27:49] this age then that ever has been but and
[27:52] so it's very so what I want to talk
[27:54] about tonight is not you know not
[27:56] necessarily salvation but it's but it's
[27:59] amazing where where the battle and the
[28:01] mind can either enable the promise of
[28:04] God to you or actually disable it based
[28:06] on what's going on in your spirit realm
[28:09] and at sea you know your Paul is
[28:11] instructing the Corinthians to take
[28:13] captive bringing every and bringing into
[28:17] captivity every thought to the obedience
[28:19] of Christ these commanding you've got to
[28:22] take your thoughts captive you've got to
[28:24] arrest them you're going to take them
[28:25] prisoner you can't just let it wander
[28:27] you've got to lay captive upon them
[28:30] bring them obedient he's not talking
[28:32] about here you know we you know we can
[28:34] preach on the soul and the soul is
[28:36] redeemed and you know we're sealed unto
[28:38] the day of our Redemption
[28:39] but at what happens in our mind can
[28:41] really determine how successful our walk
[28:44] will be you know we know that you know
[28:46] as we read on Sunday that they overcame
[28:48] him by the blood of lamb in the word of
[28:50] their testimony so you know the
[28:52] conclusion is done
[28:54] you know we read in the book of
[28:54] Revelation that the devil and the false
[28:56] prophet and all the beasts and all those
[28:58] things they thrown into the lake of fire
[28:59] and the believers are singing hallelujah
[29:02] glory to the lamb and you know and then
[29:04] it's a new heaven and new earth and
[29:06] eternity rolls on
[29:07] that's the foregone conclusion but
[29:10] between here and there a lot of things
[29:12] can happen and so Paul's instructing
[29:15] them to lay hold to to bring every
[29:19] thought into captivity and this is what
[29:23] we're instructed to do because the mind
[29:25] here is a very powerful place and many
[29:28] times we know the devil could inspire
[29:31] your thinking God can inspire your
[29:33] thinking or it can just be you yourself
[29:35] bouncing around in your mind but it's
[29:37] depending what how you you know what you
[29:39] think you know what you ponder on you
[29:42] think upon your ways and and your
[29:44] thoughts will lead you in a certain
[29:45] direction you just take anything in life
[29:48] you like you know you know if you're
[29:50] gone by okay begin to think well I need
[29:52] to buy a new car and your thoughts will
[29:53] take you in that direction and you have
[29:54] these certain things you want to you
[29:56] know the reason you buy a certain car
[29:58] because your thoughts have taken you in
[29:59] that direction so now about spiritually
[30:02] we must be careful what how we entertain
[30:05] our thoughts amen because it says in
[30:08] Isaiah 26 and three they will keep him
[30:11] in perfect peace whose mind is stayed on
[30:14] me because he trusts us in thee now if
[30:17] that promise was under the blood of
[30:19] bulls and goats how much more those have
[30:21] been washed in the blood of the Lamb
[30:22] they've been reconciled to God by his
[30:25] blood I mean so he's told that he will
[30:27] will be kept in perfect peace of our
[30:30] mind has stayed on him so you can take
[30:33] the opposite we will be kept and chaos
[30:35] and in disarray and being upset and
[30:38] troubled if our mind has not stayed on
[30:41] him now we understand that that our
[30:43] thinking what we think about affects our
[30:46] body I mean you think about a very
[30:48] stressful time in your life you can have
[30:51] a flashback or you think about something
[30:52] that's very traumatic to you you'll find
[30:54] your heart racing you'll find your pulse
[30:56] you know going in your blood pressure
[30:58] rise and different things because you're
[31:00] reliving that moment and as I say so our
[31:04] our bodies are affected by what we think
[31:06] about
[31:07] amen so you know Jesus said it well
[31:12] let's just go down to scripture where it
[31:15] says in the book of Proverbs 17 and 22
[31:19] it says a merry heart doeth good like a
[31:22] medicine but a broken spirit dries the
[31:25] bones so saying if you're merry if
[31:28] you're happy if you think about good
[31:29] things it's like a medicine to your body
[31:32] but if you have a broken spirit it's
[31:35] going to dry the bones it's going to be
[31:36] detrimental to your health to your
[31:39] physical well-being so you got to think
[31:40] about what you know you got to you got
[31:42] to guard now what's going on in this
[31:44] space we're to think about it now Jesus
[31:50] season I'm just going to really go
[31:52] through some scriptures and go into a
[31:54] few courts but Jesus is in Luke chapter
[31:57] 12 verses 28 and 29 you know we should
[32:01] be you know this age is full of pressure
[32:05] tension you know people's tie your
[32:08] peoples days aren't aren't you know down
[32:11] to hours but they're down to minutes you
[32:14] know everything's just so I got this
[32:15] much time to this this much time this
[32:16] it's a very nervous pressure pressured
[32:19] age you know that the devil has
[32:21] constructed and it can distract us so
[32:23] much and but we shouldn't be caught up
[32:27] in those things Luke 12 and 28 29 I
[32:31] think God so clothes the grass which is
[32:35] today in the field and tomorrow's cast
[32:37] into the oven how much more will he
[32:39] clothe you O ye ye of little faith and
[32:42] seek he not what you shall eat or what
[32:45] ye shall drink neither be ye of doubtful
[32:48] mind now this word doubtful mind I won't
[32:52] try and pronounce the Greek word but
[32:53] it's a verb this word mind and it's a
[32:56] and it's a the definition is to race
[33:01] like in midair ie figuratively to
[33:03] suspend to fluctuate or to be anxious so
[33:06] something that moves up and down the
[33:09] track it's not state if your mind has
[33:11] stayed on him it stays rivers of a duck
[33:13] if it's moving up and down with the tide
[33:15] or you know whatever may be affecting it
[33:18] your mind will be moving you'll be
[33:19] tossed to and fro
[33:21] we're not meant to have tossed to and
[33:22] fro minds they meant we have to keep our
[33:27] minds focused on time we're gonna take
[33:30] every thought captive
[33:31] we're instructed to take every thought
[33:33] captive amen so so if we're instructed
[33:37] to do so we have the power to do it we
[33:41] have the power to do it God doesn't tell
[33:43] us to do something without first giving
[33:44] the ability I mean so so if we're told
[33:48] take every thought into captivity then
[33:50] we can do it amen
[33:53] so if our mind is not stayed on him we
[33:55] will not have perfect peace if our mind
[33:57] is stayed on our neighbor our brother
[33:59] our sister our minds will be tossed a
[34:02] mint what are we thinking about what are
[34:06] we thinking about we're going to keep
[34:08] our mind stayed on him I pray the Lord
[34:11] does and I'm putting myself on the
[34:13] operating table do some surgery amen he
[34:18] said now we understand when Jesus was
[34:20] here he was speaking to a religious
[34:23] world that was of purely of the outward
[34:25] appearance it was you know they had to
[34:27] dress a certain way they you know they
[34:30] they found fault in his disciples hadn't
[34:32] washed their hands before they ate and
[34:34] you know they had all this ceremony and
[34:36] as all outward things but when Jesus was
[34:38] the very one who gave the law became
[34:41] flesh and was talking to them he didn't
[34:43] speak about the outward he said in in
[34:46] Matthew 15 verse 16 it says and Jesus
[34:50] said are you also yet without
[34:52] understanding do you not understand that
[34:54] whatsoever entereth in it the mouth goes
[34:57] into the belly and is cast out into the
[34:59] draught but those things which proceed
[35:02] out of the mouth come from the heart and
[35:05] they defile the man for out of the heart
[35:08] proceed evil thoughts murders adulteries
[35:10] fornications thefts false witnesses
[35:14] blasphemies these are the things which
[35:16] defile a man but to eat with unwashed
[35:18] hands defiles not a man so he's saying
[35:20] it's not the things that come in
[35:21] physically it's what comes out of the
[35:24] heart will defile you look at the
[35:26] scribes and Pharisees outwardly they you
[35:28] know they looked very holy but inwardly
[35:30] they were a bunch of dead man's bones
[35:31] you know they called Jesus that you know
[35:33] Beelzebub they
[35:35] you know they you know made false
[35:37] accusation against because it was coming
[35:39] out of their heart what was really in
[35:40] them and it's out of our member as a man
[35:43] thinketh in his heart so is he
[35:45] so we can be perfectly dressed just
[35:47] right we can act just right but in word
[35:49] we can be bitter and twisted and angry
[35:51] and resentful and those things will come
[35:54] out so it has to be more than outward
[35:56] adoring you know of the message the
[35:58] message has to be in you right because
[36:02] we can be bitter and angry against
[36:03] certain people certain things and out of
[36:05] your heart that will speak Amen is what
[36:09] God's got to get in there do some
[36:10] surgery right because it's not it's out
[36:13] of the things that come out of the heart
[36:15] they defile so if you begin to speak
[36:17] negative things they will defile you
[36:20] right you can only live as high as you
[36:23] think so if you thinking if you think
[36:26] you're Unforgiven and you're a sinner
[36:27] and you're vile and you're Richard and
[36:29] you'll never make it
[36:30] that's what your life will be if you
[36:32] think that way but if you think what God
[36:34] says about you I've been redeemed jesus
[36:37] paid it all
[36:37] I've been washed white as snow his blood
[36:40] is enough I mean I'm his child he's in
[36:42] this message together you me to himself
[36:45] ever been swept up in this and this last
[36:48] move of God - that God would gather a
[36:50] bride are you beginning to think about
[36:51] those things you'll live according to
[36:53] that I mean I am as righteous as he is
[36:55] righteous
[36:56] Paul said he became me that I might
[36:58] become the very righteous of God through
[37:00] Christ we believe the first but yes he
[37:03] became sin for me believe the second
[37:06] part of that scripture that I'd become
[37:07] the very righteous of God through Christ
[37:09] right so if you think about it that way
[37:12] then your life will be different but if
[37:14] you think negatively about what God has
[37:16] done for you you you won't get anywhere
[37:18] with him humanity dwells on the negative
[37:22] to much I meant this world was full of
[37:26] negative we shouldn't be we have great
[37:29] exceeding precious promises we should be
[37:32] arraying those around us keeping them
[37:34] around us can you look at the promise
[37:36] not the circumstance who cares about the
[37:38] circumstance I'm in this world as this
[37:41] world is going straight to hell I'm not
[37:43] looking at this world i I received the
[37:45] promise I'm going to embrace the promise
[37:47] only
[37:48] keep focused on the promise thought on
[37:50] my house shall be safe I'll keep that
[37:52] promise I mean I awoke in the light as
[37:55] he is in the light I'll keep that
[37:57] promise
[37:57] amen he is my comforter I'm going to
[38:00] keep that promise
[38:01] amen he he's my defense he's my mighty
[38:03] target running toward him safe
[38:05] he's my shield he's my buckler he's my
[38:07] Healy's my protector I'm going to keep
[38:09] those promises around me who cares about
[38:12] what the world is going oh I don't care
[38:14] that's not my promise that's not my
[38:17] covenant God didn't make it that kind of
[38:19] covenant with me he said I'm going to
[38:21] take you I'm gonna wash you make you a
[38:23] new creature transform you by my word
[38:25] make you into my image change your body
[38:29] hallelujah
[38:30] make you walk on streets of gold Amen
[38:33] that's that's what I'm gonna keep around
[38:35] me what are you looking at what you look
[38:38] at you will become you see people you
[38:42] see young people they see you know this
[38:44] world is so aggressive they put with
[38:47] their advertising in social media and
[38:49] they put it down your throats you must
[38:50] become this way and people who look at
[38:53] those things they become it I mean you
[38:56] know Lady Gaga I wish I kept the you
[39:00] know the end of you a few years agos in
[39:01] the New Zealand Herald
[39:02] she prayed make me crazy I don't know
[39:05] what she was praying to but it wasn't
[39:07] God and she had posters of all famous
[39:09] artists on her walls and she was said
[39:11] she wanted to become like them she got
[39:14] her desire her prayer was answered what
[39:19] are you looking at because what you look
[39:21] at is what you will become
[39:23] amen the judgment that you meet out will
[39:26] be you will receive I'm just going to
[39:28] flip it around every way so if you are
[39:30] judging others saying look at them
[39:32] they're this way they're this way that
[39:34] Jasmine will come upon you amen love
[39:39] covers a multitude of sin it covers a
[39:42] multitude a multitude a lot not just a
[39:46] few a multitude assert whatever happened
[39:49] to giving people the benefit of the
[39:50] doubt and looking through God's eyes if
[39:53] God changed you you say well they're
[39:56] still down at the bottom of the ladder
[39:57] and I'm way up here don't try and kick
[39:59] someone down when they're trying to you
[40:02] gods during them take come up further
[40:04] the winners way better up here you
[40:07] understand what I'm saying people stop
[40:09] making baby steps and you say well why
[40:10] are they you know imagine you parents
[40:12] here you see your child begin to crawl
[40:14] and just maybe rocks back and forth
[40:16] girls backwards you don't you don't yeah
[40:19] you don't deal with them because they
[40:20] can't crawl you never punish your child
[40:24] because they can't crawl yet you say oh
[40:27] well that's obvious you're gonna bring
[40:29] it into the spiritual some children take
[40:32] a lot longer to walk but eventually
[40:35] every child walks right some children
[40:39] takes a long time than to start talking
[40:41] but every child begins to speak you've
[40:44] got to let them tire give them time to
[40:46] speak they will they will start speaking
[40:50] eventually they meant they may say
[40:52] googoo gaga but eventually words will
[40:55] begin to be formed I mean just like in
[40:57] the spiritual where God where people
[40:59] were going to speak God's language speak
[41:01] the language of this word I mean I'm
[41:04] more than an overcomer
[41:06] hallelujah are more than victorious amen
[41:10] through him
[41:11] that's what out of a so that's what's
[41:14] now it says in Hebrews chapter 12 I want
[41:22] to live a I want to go to I want to go
[41:25] to heaven victorious you know here
[41:28] brother Ron Spencer it is about how you
[41:30] know it should be when your eyes open in
[41:33] the morning this should be alarm bells
[41:35] going through hell he's up or she's up
[41:37] what's going to happen today they should
[41:40] be in battle stations in their bunkers
[41:42] you know not to attack but to defend
[41:44] what's this child of God going to do I
[41:46] don't know all things are possible go
[41:49] with them but just just try not to tell
[41:51] the mat you know the devil should be
[41:56] terrified when you roll out of bed in
[41:58] the morning maybe your back is half
[41:59] dislocated and you've got to take a
[42:01] while to get the feeling in your limbs
[42:03] but the Satan himself should be
[42:05] trembling I mean when the bride wakes up
[42:08] and every morning it should be thank you
[42:10] Jesus for another day I have life in
[42:13] this body to praise you I won't lead a
[42:15] rock
[42:16] in my place I mean I learned that some
[42:18] birds sing in my place I'm going to
[42:20] praise the Lord with my life hallelujah
[42:22] that's how it should be I have another
[42:24] day I have another 24 hours to praise
[42:26] God I'm in and in whatever capacity with
[42:30] my children with my aunt worker yeah my
[42:32] very life should be a worship I mean you
[42:35] don't have to tell the birds to wake up
[42:37] and start singing when the Sun comes up
[42:38] they just start singing only because the
[42:41] Sun comes up I mean they begin to
[42:43] worship God hallelujah that's another
[42:46] day nature worships God amen it should
[42:50] be the same thing with us the Sun's up
[42:52] children we're not in darkness anymore
[42:55] Alleluia hey Hebrews 12 and 12 wherefore
[43:01] lift up the hands which hang down and
[43:04] the feeble knees and make paths straight
[43:08] for your feet least that which is lame
[43:11] be turned out of the way but they don't
[43:14] rather be healed follow peace with all
[43:16] men and holiness without no man shall
[43:20] see the Lord now notice what we just
[43:23] read follow peace with all men okay and
[43:27] holiness without which no man shall see
[43:30] the Lord looking diligently least any
[43:34] man fail of the grace of God lest any
[43:37] root of bitterness springing up trouble
[43:39] you and whereby many be defiled he's
[43:44] instructing you must follow do you see
[43:47] how those two statements are linked
[43:49] follow peace with all men this is the
[43:53] thing you must do and holiness with
[43:56] without which no man shall see the Lord
[43:59] so you've got to follow peace with all
[44:00] men least I'm just telling me the second
[44:03] part of verse 15 because I want to look
[44:05] these two things together lest any root
[44:07] of bitterness springing up trouble you
[44:09] if you don't follow peace with all me
[44:11] and there's going to be a root of
[44:12] bitterness spring up this that's the
[44:14] conclusion I'm trying to draw out of
[44:15] this because if you are if you're
[44:17] against someone and you hold a grudge
[44:20] and you're bitter against them and
[44:22] resentful it doesn't affect them at
[44:25] affects you you're not following peace
[44:28] with them
[44:29] right you're actually declaring war on
[44:31] them and it's what comes out of your
[44:34] heart is just going to defile you they
[44:37] may never know we'll realize what's
[44:39] going on but and you can be a route of
[44:41] business growing and instead of being
[44:43] loving the Lord happy at peace
[44:47] rejoicing you become bitter bitterness
[44:50] isn't sweet amen it's not a you know if
[44:55] you see someone's face when they bite
[44:57] into a lemon they're not used to
[44:59] bitterness is it yo and you see someone
[45:03] I'm in the message hallelujah where's
[45:10] the joy that died along is shriveled up
[45:13] a long time ago do not end up that way
[45:20] don't even take a step that way amen
[45:25] because ultimately the devil's got it in
[45:27] here and that's and that thing becomes
[45:30] all they think about
[45:34] amen and there to fix your health that
[45:38] affects your family that affects
[45:40] everyone around you now season flip
[45:49] Ian's for eight for six to eight be
[45:54] careful for nothing but in everything by
[45:57] prayer and supplication with
[45:59] Thanksgiving that your Kris be made

[46:12] careful for nothing you know committed
[46:14] to the Lord just walk with Him don't get
[46:17] stressed don't get worried about it
[46:20] brother Brown preacher swim and letting
[46:22] off the pressure and he says the name of
[46:24] the Lord is a strong tower the righteous
[46:26] run into enter safe there's a place we
[46:28] can get in and let off the pressure
[46:30] amen and it's not these four walls it's
[46:33] in Christ who's who's gotten into the
[46:37] tower who's been sealed into the kingdom
[46:40] by the Holy Ghost amen so when you get
[46:42] in that place there
[46:43] you can laid off the pressure hallelujah
[46:45] I'm in that place all the time
[46:47] I dwell in that place continually I can
[46:51] let off the pressure you got to look at
[46:54] where you live you mean well I live here
[46:56] I lived another spiritually where are
[46:58] you living
[46:58] I mean you know in the wilderness
[47:01] somewhere you know in some D's it I pray
[47:03] but you're in you're in the City of
[47:04] Refuge which is Jesus Christ and the
[47:10] peace of God which passes all
[47:11] understanding shall keep your hearts and
[47:12] minds through Christ Jesus finally
[47:15] brethren whatsoever things are true now
[47:17] he's giving instruction whatsoever
[47:19] things are honest whatsoever things are
[47:21] just whatsoever things are pure
[47:24] whatsoever things are lovely whatsoever
[47:27] things are a good report if there be any
[47:31] virtue if there be any praise think on
[47:35] these things he's not saying whatsoever
[47:39] things are pure whatsoever things are
[47:42] terrible what other things are
[47:44] scandalous what are things that just
[47:46] gossip he doesn't say think on those
[47:50] things think on these things it's a lot
[47:54] of things to think about he's
[47:55] instructing this how you take your your
[47:58] mind captive your thoughts captive I
[48:00] mean you keep your mind state on these
[48:02] things
[48:03] now this is not mind over matter this is
[48:05] word over matter
[48:06] I mean you're going to bring your
[48:08] circumstance subject to the Word of God
[48:10] right because if you just look at and
[48:13] when what's going on just naturally I
[48:15] mean then you'll get stressed then
[48:16] you'll get worried then you'll be
[48:17] anxious and you know but then if you
[48:19] bring your thoughts subject to the Word
[48:21] of God I mean that's what we need to do
[48:25] the devil loves to come and take our
[48:28] minds in a million places sometimes we
[48:29] just take it in a million places but
[48:32] you're going to take it captive think on
[48:37] those things worry will get you nowhere
[48:40] faith may deliver you I believe
[48:43] ultimately it will look at the Hebrew
[48:46] children going into the fiery furnace if
[48:48] we perish through perish if we don't
[48:51] hallelujah but we're not going to bow
[48:52] down they didn't they didn't
[48:55] get worried about it that that that was
[48:57] all they head we can't do this we can't
[49:00] bow down to your image Oh King live
[49:02] forever if our God delivers us praise
[49:04] the Lord have thought well we'll burn
[49:06] their minds what state he followed me
[49:10] they weren't all worried about they just
[49:12] they just winnin they were resigned they
[49:15] made up their minds you gotta make up
[49:17] your mind you gotta make up your mind
[49:20] this word is true it is Jesus Christ he
[49:23] is present his word doesn't change
[49:25] doesn't matter what all the atheists and
[49:27] religious realms may say his word is
[49:30] true right his word is sure it hasn't
[49:33] changed
[49:33] it's as good as the day it was written
[49:35] amen is still good today hallelujah we
[49:39] don't need to worry time is nothing with
[49:42] God you say well it was 2000 years ago
[49:45] Paul was writing these letters it
[49:47] doesn't matter it's still good today and
[49:50] it still works
[49:54] now let's read it I was going to read a
[50:02] few things now we must only think
[50:07] positive
[50:08] we can't think negative okay I'm gonna
[50:11] show you negative thoughts will disable
[50:13] your faith okay negative thoughts will
[50:17] disable your faith that's why ignore
[50:20] doubt doubt your doubts because all
[50:23] doubt is is the devil's the devil is
[50:25] speaking from his experience you know
[50:28] people who know nothing about something
[50:30] they always talk negative about it
[50:31] especially when it comes to things of
[50:33] the Lord they they've never tasted and
[50:35] seen that the Lord is good so the
[50:36] normally hundreds in the time war for my
[50:38] experience the people who have never met
[50:40] them they only speak negative because
[50:42] that's their experience they've never
[50:44] experienced it but once you really meet
[50:46] them it's all positive hallelujah amen
[50:50] so that now this is person that suffers
[50:53] from a greater than Solomon is here in
[50:54] 1958 person in here to have this in your
[50:58] mind that as soon as prep I'm sorry
[51:00] well Amir and while I'm praying and
[51:03] speaking I want every person in here to
[51:05] have this on your minds not just the
[51:07] people in the prayer line but everyone
[51:09] he's instructing the whole congregation
[51:11] that as soon as prayer begins to go for
[51:14] the sick every one of you is going to
[51:17] get up and walk out of the building well
[51:19] don't have nothing else in your mind
[51:23] keep thinking that if there be any
[51:25] praise if there be any virtue think on
[51:27] these things you cannot get anything
[51:31] from God with a negative thought he that
[51:35] cometh to God must believe that he is
[51:37] and a rewarder of those that diligently
[51:40] seek Him it's from the book of Hebrews
[51:44] there's like people they get healed he
[51:46] says yeah it's a brother Brahim says he
[51:49] says someone comes got cancer they get
[51:50] prayed for the spirit goes out of the
[51:52] cancer and then they begin to feel worse
[51:55] because the body has to purify out the
[51:56] tumor and in the person says I felt
[51:59] wonderful in the prayer line but then
[52:01] three days later of course because that
[52:02] thing begins to decompose and the body's
[52:04] got purified out that's how I feel worse
[52:06] or maybe I wasn't healed and then that
[52:09] unbelief that negative thought just
[52:10] brings brings that spirit back into the
[52:13] cancer again amen ECS basis you feeling
[52:17] worse is the very son you were healed
[52:18] see it's very easy when we're shouting
[52:21] and rejoicing and God is here right and
[52:23] we're having a Jubilee you feel like the
[52:25] dead in Christ are just going to turn up
[52:27] amen that's what it feels like but then
[52:29] it's when we leave that anoint we leave
[52:31] that presence he's always with us but
[52:34] it's different you know what I mean
[52:35] people have a rejoicing camp time they
[52:38] feel like they have basically fly away
[52:39] and then they've got to go back into the
[52:41] real world I mean but they forget and
[52:45] but then they're thinking matches where
[52:47] they are instead of keeping their
[52:48] thinking to how they were thinking in
[52:50] the service amen your are we all
[52:54] following me you got to keep your
[52:56] confession positive doesn't matter if it
[52:59] never comes out of here and here okay no
[53:04] he says you cannot get I was going to
[53:06] repeat that line you cannot get anything
[53:08] from God with a negative thought now
[53:12] that's why we've got to think we've got
[53:14] to think about him you know he's taking
[53:17] us to heaven
[53:18] I mean the church isn't taking us to
[53:20] heaven the Christian world not take
[53:22] against
[53:22] heaven he's taking us to heaven when we
[53:25] come together we worship Him we don't
[53:27] worship the person standing here or the
[53:29] musician or the first next to us we're
[53:32] here to worship God amen and when you
[53:34] think upon him he always draws near when
[53:39] you think about him and you talk about
[53:40] him he always draws near and we see this
[53:43] in Luke 24 it's the resurrections
[53:45] happened the tour walking on the way to
[53:47] Emmaus and they're talking about what
[53:49] God had done in their day they were
[53:51] talking about the living Jesus Christ
[53:54] they didn't understand why everything
[53:55] that was going on but they're talking
[53:57] about what had happened right there and
[53:59] as they will walk in talking about him
[54:01] he himself that they were talking about
[54:04] drew near and walked with them and he
[54:07] began to talk to them
[54:09] he wasn't just an unseen guest in the
[54:11] conversation he began to speak they
[54:15] weren't talking about what Moses did
[54:16] they weren't talking about what happened
[54:18] you know an Eden or some place they were
[54:21] talking about their day because he's the
[54:23] prison god and as they were talking
[54:26] about him he himself Junia and began to
[54:29] speak with them he wants that kind of
[54:31] fellowship because ultimately that's
[54:33] what we want to fellowship with I mean
[54:35] that's why we come together to have
[54:36] fellowship that he himself would step
[54:38] down I meant like brother berry stars
[54:41] from brother head bisko's testimonies up
[54:43] in northern British Columbia
[54:45] you know if brother Branham he's a bud
[54:46] south works place and they're sharing
[54:49] testimony they see the atmosphere just
[54:51] just around the dining table the
[54:53] atmosphere so electric
[54:54] brother Graham said that pillar far is
[54:56] not a few inches from either of us right
[54:59] there because I talking about that God I
[55:02] mean he's the same God we've had
[55:05] experiences it feels like we're just
[55:06] gonna disappear lying in bed talking
[55:09] about him he comes down hallelujah
[55:12] that's what we want and that's what we
[55:15] have talked about the believer our God
[55:18] would never come down and speak yes you
[55:21] got to get that out of your mind our God
[55:23] would never come down member he wants to
[55:26] draw near to you he wants to draw near
[55:28] to you more than you want to draw near
[55:30] to him amen
[55:32] that's what he wants oh but you know
[55:36] that's not a fantasy that's a reality
[55:41] hallelujah
[55:43] now this isn't Mary's belief in 1959
[55:46] brother Graham says I think that one of
[55:49] the great troubles of the people of this
[55:50] day we have too many other things on our
[55:54] mind even when we come to a healing
[55:57] service we seem to think well I did not
[56:01] get a prayer card tonight or perhaps
[56:03] I'll not be prayed for see notice how
[56:06] close you say we talk about negative
[56:07] thoughts it's not thoughts God's not
[56:09] real
[56:10] he doesn't heal he's not here it's not
[56:13] those kind of thoughts comes right down
[56:14] close look at these thoughts these
[56:17] people are in a healing surface he's
[56:18] talking about and they say well I well I
[56:21] did not get a prayer card tonight over
[56:23] perhaps I won't be prayed for we will
[56:26] never be able to accomplish much
[56:29] accomplish much as long as we keep on
[56:31] those kind of thoughts simple thoughts
[56:35] like that with this person's doing this
[56:37] this child's acting up here this is
[56:39] going on here they're singing this and
[56:41] the wrong key this is too fast this is
[56:42] too slow this is too loud the system
[56:44] quiet that person will that last week
[56:46] you know this chairs not comfortable
[56:48] this chairs too comfortable this chair
[56:50] you know that's too hot it's too cold
[56:51] it's what it's too long it's too short
[56:53] when you have one accomplish anything
[56:55] with those kind of thoughts that's the
[56:57] devil telling you a whole bunch of stuff
[56:59] you don't need to know just like all of
[57:01] basically had virtually 100% of what's
[57:04] on the internet you don't need to know
[57:06] you need to know the message is here the
[57:09] Bible's here testimonies are on here vas
[57:12] other stuff who really cares about it
[57:14] but the devil come and fill your head
[57:16] while you're you know while you're
[57:18] sitting there thinking about tomorrow
[57:19] thinking about next week thinking about
[57:21] I've got to do this I've got to do this
[57:22] when I get home this needs to happen and
[57:24] all that I sort the saddest thing is the
[57:26] oven salon that I do this that I turn
[57:28] this that I lock this that I you know
[57:30] what about my car and editor and editor
[57:32] you won't accomplish much with those
[57:33] kind of thoughts you know take that
[57:35] captive say Lord I'm here and one of one
[57:38] heart my heart is to worship you I want
[57:42] to serve you
[57:43] I don't express my love back to you how
[57:45] great is our God sing with me how great
[57:48] how great is our God
[57:50] he's altogether lovely he's altogether
[57:52] wonderful he's altogether glorious
[57:55] hallelujah that's why we gather to
[57:59] worship so don't worry about all those
[58:01] kind of things now in the service what
[58:07] is the Holy Ghost oh whoa no I just want
[58:09] to read this a bit brother brand this is
[58:12] in 1959 and this happens a few times in
[58:14] his life where he he makes a renewed
[58:18] consecration to God I just want to read
[58:21] this he says the other night at around a
[58:25] little after midnight the wife and I
[58:26] after sitting a sitting up and praying
[58:29] and talking on the Lord across the
[58:31] little footstool in our front room now
[58:34] front room is a lounge and in in the
[58:38] Queen's English or whatever we talk I
[58:40] don't know but front rooms are lounge
[58:42] okay with to open Bibles we consecrated
[58:46] ourselves anew to God for a complete
[58:49] service now here's a here's a prophet
[58:52] you'd say well you'd say how how can he
[58:56] do any more of a complete service well
[58:58] you say he's done a complete service
[58:59] though it comes times in life where this
[59:02] is 1959 there's gonna be 1960 the church
[59:05] ages then shortly after that 1960 200
[59:08] 962 services it's the time of the end in
[59:11] the seals open he's coming to a very
[59:13] important junction and his walk as we
[59:16] are as we you say we have this church I
[59:22] mean this world will never continue on
[59:24] forever
[59:25] amen we've got a plan long term but
[59:29] we're going to live like it maybe
[59:30] tomorrow and it looks like it might be
[59:32] tomorrow oh yeah right so so we're gonna
[59:38] but we have to play long-term right
[59:40] that's why we love the young people and
[59:43] to me I'm one of them I'm gonna try and
[59:46] be part of club as long until I get
[59:48] kicked out you too I'll get out of here
[59:49] anyway
[59:51] you know I don't see age myself I feel
[59:53] young hallelujah anyway but you know so
[59:59] anyway oh I'll just read this we
[1:00:02] consecrated ourselves anew to God for a
[1:00:04] complete
[1:00:04] service that we would surrender our own
[1:00:07] wills and everything and every negative
[1:00:10] thought and to serve the Lord Jesus and
[1:00:13] I trust that's been your attitude to
[1:00:15] that you've done the same thing then
[1:00:18] when we are coming tonight we are coming
[1:00:21] upon holy grounds among the people who's
[1:00:23] been praying and fasting and making
[1:00:26] restitutions and getting ready to
[1:00:28] receive something from God and I know
[1:00:31] that he that will come hungry will not
[1:00:34] go away hungry but God will feed him
[1:00:37] with the bread of life go it's not going
[1:00:43] to make sure this is so he had a time of
[1:00:46] consecration notice he had it at home
[1:00:50] with his wife and as you know in their
[1:00:51] lounge and the purpose of it was to
[1:00:55] surrender their wills you'd say well
[1:00:57] hasn't he done that already he has done
[1:00:59] that already right and everything for a
[1:01:04] complete service and every negative
[1:01:07] thought he come to give over every
[1:01:09] negative thought amen their own wills
[1:01:13] for a complete service this is what he
[1:01:18] did and he did it with us help meet you
[1:01:22] know what help me it is in the Bible
[1:01:23] it's not a slave or a servant at someone
[1:01:26] this is my words but help me is a help
[1:01:29] that is able to you know someone who is
[1:01:32] able to do the job right so they are
[1:01:36] qualified to do the job they're called
[1:01:37] to do I don't write dictionaries but
[1:01:42] that's basically what it's not a servant
[1:01:45] who's sick in class to the one who's
[1:01:46] called right like Eve wasn't sick in
[1:01:50] class to Adam they meant she wasn't a
[1:01:53] servant they were joint ears than the
[1:01:55] garden before the fall that was his help
[1:01:59] me he was on equal terms with him a mint
[1:02:03] and then Peter has to instruct the you
[1:02:06] know instruct the New Testament they
[1:02:08] says you know husband's dwell with your
[1:02:12] wives according to knowledge that your
[1:02:14] prayers may not be hindered being joined
[1:02:17] ears
[1:02:18] of eternal life he his thinking had to
[1:02:21] be changed because in the Jewish way
[1:02:23] the woman was seeing close to the men
[1:02:25] but in the New Testament order the woman
[1:02:29] are not second-class but their joint is
[1:02:31] in Christ with the man his thinking had
[1:02:35] to be changed their thinking had to be
[1:02:37] changed right and a lot of us has to be
[1:02:42] you know our culture and what we think
[1:02:45] has to be changed our minds have to be
[1:02:49] renewed well I thought it was this and I
[1:02:52] thought was this God changed my mind you
[1:02:55] know I'm not interested in my opinion
[1:02:57] I'll just be real honest I don't care
[1:02:59] about what I think what does he say what
[1:03:02] does he say because it's not my opinion
[1:03:05] that matters it's his opinion amen we're
[1:03:10] going to take those things captive to
[1:03:12] the Word of God because it's such a you
[1:03:15] know it's such a robbery where men will
[1:03:17] beat their wives down as as slaves
[1:03:21] saying oh they're in their place now
[1:03:23] they're not in their place sisters help
[1:03:27] me out as I said on Sunday amen
[1:03:32] right this goes on the internet someone
[1:03:35] else may see it but you know men who
[1:03:37] beat their wives down that's not being
[1:03:39] that's not being Christ to his to his
[1:03:41] wife that's not a reflection of what
[1:03:43] Jesus Christ us to us he doesn't beat
[1:03:46] you down he lifts you up who's being
[1:03:48] lifted up love lifted me love lifted me
[1:03:51] no no we know it else but Christ could
[1:03:54] help what happened love lifted me amen
[1:03:57] and they say hallelujah and they've got
[1:03:59] the truncheon down like this at the same
[1:04:01] time something hasn't happened to them
[1:04:04] right they do not know what grace is all
[1:04:07] they know is law you say but my culture
[1:04:10] cares about culture it's a true message
[1:04:12] culture is a true heaven culture that's
[1:04:15] what we want this is not a Western
[1:04:18] message or an Eastern message this is a
[1:04:21] heaven message so we want our minds to
[1:04:26] be stayed on him we don't want to think
[1:04:28] of thoughts
[1:04:32] we're going to stay positive now this is
[1:04:37] from from a message if you don't mind
[1:04:39] the reading thou son of David have mercy
[1:04:41] on me 1961 he sees this he says go right
[1:04:47] on down the road no matter what school
[1:04:49] keeps or not if it don't you turn we
[1:04:52] turn the teacher out and just go right
[1:04:55] on believing the Lord see keep
[1:04:57] meditations upon God think on these
[1:04:59] things the Bible said if there be any
[1:05:01] praise if there be any virtue think on
[1:05:04] these things well our thoughts are
[1:05:05] always negative we come into a prayer
[1:05:07] line I noticed they come in the prayer
[1:05:09] line Oh FFF he will tell me if if it is
[1:05:14] if at this
[1:05:16] oh my you never get nothing like that
[1:05:19] no you're so negative to begin with come
[1:05:22] like that come to the fountain filled
[1:05:25] with blood drawn from Emmanuel's veins
[1:05:26] where sinners plunged beneath that flood
[1:05:28] lose all their guilty stains that sit
[1:05:30] come with faith believing he that cometh
[1:05:33] to God must believe that he is and the
[1:05:35] rewarder of those that diligently seek
[1:05:38] Him see never come with maybe it will
[1:05:40] work that's negative so closer or maybe
[1:05:44] he will maybe he reward me maybe you
[1:05:47] know no he's our water
[1:05:49] you must who believes that he is who
[1:05:52] believes it is and he is a rewarder of
[1:05:54] those that diligently seek Him who's
[1:05:57] diligently sought him amen and who's
[1:06:00] been found of him who who's been
[1:06:02] rewarded amen
[1:06:05] he says I'm not going to go through all
[1:06:08] Roberts Prayer Line then go through
[1:06:09] Tommy Hicks prayer line then go through
[1:06:12] Osborne's prayer line Ellen's prayer
[1:06:14] line Brandon's prayer line and so on so
[1:06:16] prayer line go to this church in that
[1:06:18] church why you're just wasting time
[1:06:19] that's all that's all the thing to do is
[1:06:22] just just say and make up your mind that
[1:06:25] is God and God said so and I'm going to
[1:06:28] meet his requirements and that settles
[1:06:30] it forever amen that's it God said so go
[1:06:34] out to my pastor say pastor the Bible
[1:06:36] tells us to call the elders anoint them
[1:06:37] and oil pray over the prayer of faith
[1:06:39] shall save the sick that's all I have to
[1:06:42] know amen
[1:06:44] amen that's all if God said it that's it
[1:06:47] it's done well will it work get get that
[1:06:50] out of your mind if he said it
[1:06:52] it'll happen amen
[1:06:57] now this is me don't combat negative
[1:07:00] thoughts replace them this thing you
[1:07:05] know we become creatures of habit not in
[1:07:09] just physically what we do but our
[1:07:10] thought pattern it becomes predictable
[1:07:13] we begin to think a certain way certain
[1:07:16] situations come up we react the same way
[1:07:18] because we've programmed ourselves to
[1:07:21] look at things a certain way and think
[1:07:23] you know if all this happens well this
[1:07:25] is how I react or if this happens is how
[1:07:27] I think you know many times that's got
[1:07:31] to be done away with
[1:07:32] we need a reprogramming a ment we need
[1:07:36] to be reset amen I know I think brother
[1:07:41] Andy talked about in a subconscious
[1:07:42] series but it's true the the pathways in
[1:07:45] the brain can constantly change based on
[1:07:48] how you think and so that's why you've
[1:07:51] got to look at how you think if you
[1:07:53] begin to think well we'll never really
[1:07:54] happen for me and I've been in this for
[1:07:56] years and nothing has ever really
[1:07:57] happened you ought to get rid of that I
[1:07:59] mean you got to get rid of that forget
[1:08:02] about what you've been thinking about in
[1:08:03] the past say Lord your word is true
[1:08:06] you've made me a believer I believe in
[1:08:09] the power of your Redemption that
[1:08:10] settles it
[1:08:11] here I come Lord Jesus amen he's a
[1:08:15] rewarder of them that diligently seek
[1:08:17] Him and then they'll says well you tried
[1:08:19] before who cares about before who cares
[1:08:22] about yesterday forgetting the things
[1:08:24] which are in the past
[1:08:25] the scripture says forget about it it'll
[1:08:28] say put it on the Shelf when you feel
[1:08:29] bad pick it up and read about it forget
[1:08:31] it forget it well well I failed
[1:08:34] yesterday who cares but if you sincerely
[1:08:37] said Lord forgive me pick me up try me
[1:08:39] one more time it's done it's done away
[1:08:42] with God doesn't remember how many times
[1:08:44] we come to and say Lord you know I did
[1:08:46] this and I've done this and I've done
[1:08:47] this and it's the millionth time you've
[1:08:49] said those things to him and he looks at
[1:08:51] you saying what are you talking about
[1:08:53] let's look at my file
[1:08:57] no let's look at my Great Hall of
[1:08:59] Records it's not there what oh but I did
[1:09:03] this I did this and he says no he didn't
[1:09:05] do this but we get caught up and such a
[1:09:08] what do you call it a guilt complex and
[1:09:11] our mind is filled with guilt all the
[1:09:13] time oh he could never forgive me and he
[1:09:15] could and that's the devil trying to
[1:09:17] give you his experience because he can't
[1:09:20] be forgiven because there's no blood for
[1:09:22] him God didn't die for angels he died
[1:09:24] for you I mean he didn't Redemption
[1:09:28] they're not on the plan of redemption
[1:09:29] we're in the plan of redemption
[1:09:31] amen so we're good it's gotta get up
[1:09:33] it's not him the falls at him that gets
[1:09:36] up I meant you may be knocked down a
[1:09:39] million times just get up a million and
[1:09:41] one and that's the one that matters they
[1:09:44] meant Abraham Lincoln went for public
[1:09:47] office about eleven times before he
[1:09:49] became successful you would think that
[1:09:52] man would have got discouraged but he
[1:09:54] didn't get discouraged he became the
[1:09:57] president of the United States at a very
[1:09:58] crucial hour in their history and he
[1:10:01] spoke a very short address that Guinea
[1:10:02] Gettysburg Address and it rallied the
[1:10:04] nation and they won the war they meant
[1:10:08] it's not them that lose the battle it's
[1:10:10] them that win the war that matters
[1:10:11] they are the victors in the end amen
[1:10:15] you can lose basically every battle
[1:10:17] except the last one but if the last one
[1:10:19] wins you the war that all that's all
[1:10:21] that matters
[1:10:23] who cares you know
[1:10:25] how'd the campaign go pretty bad until
[1:10:28] the last one I won the whole thing
[1:10:30] hallelujah my enemies did I'm alive
[1:10:33] that's all that matters amen
[1:10:35] so you say well I've lost you know it
[1:10:40] takes real grit and determination you
[1:10:43] maybe you've been knocked around your
[1:10:44] entire life put it into it I'm not going
[1:10:47] to entertain that thinking anymore I'm
[1:10:49] not going to sit in the defeated if
[1:10:51] you're a corner anymore I mean my god is
[1:10:53] victorious I'm not looking at me his
[1:10:56] blood is more than enough amen if it can
[1:10:58] if he can set Legion free if he can set
[1:11:02] the woman at the well free if he can
[1:11:04] take the apostles who were illiterate
[1:11:06] and you know then know left and right
[1:11:08] and all that stuff and make them this
[1:11:10] let's person yo this is my church you
[1:11:12] know when God Jesus is here he's
[1:11:13] gathering his children comes into his
[1:11:15] ministry he gathers Peter James and John
[1:11:17] come follow me I need to go by the way
[1:11:19] of Samaria speaks to the woman of the
[1:11:21] world is Mary Magdalene all these
[1:11:22] different ones he's looking them saying
[1:11:24] this is my church these are my precious
[1:11:28] ones amen you know the high priest
[1:11:32] wasn't cold all those ones weren't
[1:11:34] called
