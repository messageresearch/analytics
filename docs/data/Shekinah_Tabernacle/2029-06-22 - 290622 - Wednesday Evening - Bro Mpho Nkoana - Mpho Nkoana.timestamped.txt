[14:16] christ i feel
[14:18] very delivered

[15:16] because the door is closed and sometimes

[15:23] but praise god that jesus considers
[15:25] three so i say all that just to say that

[26:48] having said that all our members all our

[27:01] none above you

[27:07] for us amen
[27:09] i greet you tonight in the name of our
[27:11] lord jesus christ
[27:12] and then
[27:15] once again we are meeting in the
[27:16] presence of god amen thank you so much
[27:18] musicians and we appreciate even the new
[27:22] improvement of

[27:26] uh
[27:27] what we call the worship team
[27:30] thank you worship team god bless you
[27:32] thank you musicians we appreciate let's
[27:34] get ready for them
[27:36] thank you brother josh appreciate the
[27:38] song leading tonight amen
[27:40] songs of zion that are really preparing
[27:43] the atmosphere for the word of god in
[27:45] our hearts amen
[27:47] so it's quite something for the
[27:50] the song leader because
[27:52] uh when we come we come
[27:54] after dinner
[27:56] here at church
[27:57] and then we come after work
[28:00] and then we come having gone through
[28:03] such a lot of things
[28:05] and then the chorus leader is the one
[28:07] who must take us
[28:08] from
[28:09] as we come from outside
[28:12] to bring the songs to prepare the
[28:14] atmosphere so you can you can think by
[28:16] the time the minister come here people
[28:18] are already focused on what they are
[28:20] here for so it's quite that we must
[28:22] really commend our song leaders for
[28:25] doing that especially the ones that are
[28:27] upcoming josh and
[28:29] dave and so we appreciate the lord
[28:32] and um
[28:34] so while we're standing we won't waste
[28:36] much
[28:37] of time let's just read in the book of
[28:39] first corinthians chapter 11.
[28:45] we read in the book of first corinthians
[28:47] chapter 11
[28:49] and then
[28:50] we will sit down
[28:52] and move to romans chapter 12 amen
[28:56] first corinthians
[28:58] chapter 11 once you are there you can
[29:00] indicate by saying
[29:02] amen
[29:05] let's reverently read the word of god
[29:07] from verse 25
[29:11] the bible says from verse 25
[29:15] after the same manner also he took the
[29:18] cup
[29:20] when he had stopped
[29:22] saying this cup is the new testament in
[29:25] my blood
[29:27] this dewey do ye as oft as you drink it
[29:31] in remembrance of me
[29:33] for as oft as often as you eat this
[29:36] bread and drink this cup
[29:38] you do show the lord's death till he
[29:41] come amen
[29:43] wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread
[29:46] and drink this cup
[29:48] of the lord
[29:49] unworthily
[29:51] shall be guilty
[29:53] of the body and blood of the lord
[29:56] but let a man examine himself
[30:00] and let him eat
[30:02] of that bread
[30:04] and drink of that cup
[30:06] verse 29.
[30:10] for he that eateth and drinketh
[30:12] unworthily
[30:13] eaten and drinketh damnation
[30:16] to himself
[30:18] and this is the last part of the vest
[30:19] that i would like you to focus on to
[30:21] dwell on it
[30:23] not descending
[30:26] the lord's body
[30:28] amen
[30:29] let's just pray together
[30:33] if there's a need in your heart the lord
[30:36] is able to answer that need
[30:39] my prayer tonight is that he can inspire
[30:42] his word
[30:43] and speak to our hearts
[30:46] heavenly father
[30:49] lord jesus christ the creator of the
[30:51] heavens and the earth
[30:53] lord we are taught by the bible

[34:41] now uh this evening
[34:43] uh i um
[34:46] just wanna we want to with guests yes
[34:50] jessie lee a happy birthday
[34:52] i believe today

[35:03] may he guide and lead you
[35:05] and just pour himself in your life amen
[35:07] it's our prayer
[35:09] and then
[35:10] also i wasn't supposed to be here
[35:12] standing tonight it was i'm
[35:15] actually the spare of the spay
[35:20] if you know what that means brother
[35:22] ahmad was supposed to be preaching here
[35:23] not me
[35:24] and then the pastor was supposed to
[35:26] replace him when he didn't
[35:28] he was not going to make it
[35:30] and then now the pasta didn't make it
[35:35] you realize that i'm down the line and
[35:36] i'm enjoying it down there i'm very
[35:39] content and happy
[35:40] but now i am despair of despair
[35:45] will
[35:47] so i'm coming along those lines tonight
[35:49] and i pray that you'll if when i make a
[35:51] mistake you'll forgive me but i pray
[35:54] that where there's a blessing that
[35:55] you'll grab it with all your heart and i
[35:58] pray that god can just be the speaker
[36:00] not me
[36:01] and
[36:02] and we have read the scripture and i
[36:04] want us to speak about descending the
[36:06] body
[36:07] of the lord descending the lord's body
[36:10] so this scripture we know the scripture
[36:13] and we have read it so many times
[36:14] because we read it when we eat communion
[36:17] so we are not going to eat communion but
[36:19] we are going to have communion tonight
[36:22] so so so i would like us to think about
[36:25] the body of the lord that i would like
[36:27] us to think about descending it you know
[36:30] what is to to discern
[36:32] so before perhaps we go there let's read
[36:34] the book of
[36:37] romans
[36:38] chapter 12.
[36:40] romans chapter 12. you know from
[36:42] corinthians you go back
[36:44] for the for those who are a bit confused
[36:46] you don't go forward
[36:48] you go back
[36:49] you know have you ever seen someone
[36:50] looking for the script
[36:52] in the wrong chapter in a wrong
[36:55] uh
[36:58] section amen let's read romans chapter
[37:00] 12 this is the lately
[37:02] the scripture of my heart i don't know
[37:04] why the lord lays it on my heart so
[37:06] heavily
[37:07] that i can't separate with it
[37:10] for some for some reason amen let's read
[37:12] it starting from this one
[37:15] i beseech you brethren
[37:18] i beseech ye i beseech you therefore
[37:20] brethren by the message
[37:22] of god
[37:24] that ye
[37:25] present your bodies
[37:28] a living sacrifice
[37:32] your bodies
[37:34] right and we are talking about the body
[37:36] of the lord tonight are we together
[37:37] we're just going to take it slow
[37:39] wherever we stop we stop we'll continue
[37:41] some other time but i want i want us to
[37:43] understand and to follow one another the
[37:46] the line of thought amen
[37:48] that you present
[37:50] your bodies
[37:53] hallelujah a living sacrifice meaning
[37:56] our bodies
[37:57] whether our physical bodies
[38:00] our spiritual bodies that we must
[38:02] present them
[38:05] as a living sacrifice
[38:09] are we together if you are with me just
[38:11] say amen
[38:16] then he says holy
[38:20] holy present yourself living sacrifice
[38:23] one
[38:24] coma
[38:25] holy
[38:28] acceptable
[38:30] unto god
[38:32] which is your reasonable service you see
[38:35] this just this verse alone is quite
[38:38] intriguing because at the end of that
[38:40] verse it says which is your reasonable
[38:43] meaning meaning this is your your
[38:45] minimum requirement
[38:47] this is my minimum
[38:49] requirement you know when you apply for
[38:51] a job and they say the minimum
[38:53] requirements they need for you to be
[38:55] eligible for a job or an interview they
[38:58] ask you about the minimum requirements
[39:01] not the maximum the minimum
[39:04] because in the minimum going forward
[39:06] will include the maximum but the moment
[39:08] you are below the minimum
[39:11] you cannot be eligible so we must
[39:13] present ourselves our bodies holy
[39:17] acceptable
[39:18] unto god
[39:19] and this is our reasonable service our
[39:23] our you know a reasonable once when you
[39:25] say to someone not fair enough
[39:28] fair enough when someone a brother is
[39:29] telling you something you say you're
[39:30] fair enough you're meaning that that's
[39:32] reasonable enough for you to approve or
[39:34] to accept am i right sister
[39:36] so that is a minimum or a reasonable
[39:39] service for us
[39:41] is to present ourselves as this one says
[39:45] let's continue
[39:47] and be not confirmed
[39:49] you know to be confirmed
[39:52] is to be aligned
[39:54] you know to to to go along
[39:57] to go along when we say ah just just
[40:00] just go along
[40:02] just play along
[40:04] you see that's the thought around that
[40:06] way on verse two you're conforming in
[40:08] other words you are you are
[40:10] participating you are going along you
[40:12] are conforming
[40:16] so what are we not supposed to confirm
[40:18] conform with and be not confirmed be not
[40:21] and be not conformed to this world
[40:25] the world that we're living in
[40:28] when we wake up here every day where we
[40:30] fight our battles every day when we face
[40:32] challenges every day that we must not be
[40:35] conformed to it
[40:37] but be he transformed
[40:41] by the renewing of your mind i love the
[40:45] brothers what they preached on sunday
[40:47] the the youth service i love that
[40:49] service because it spoke to my heart and
[40:52] it actually as we actually talked now
[40:54] think about that same one for both david
[40:56] and and
[40:58] and brother ben for both of them and the
[41:00] one that stuck to my heart the most for
[41:02] me
[41:03] that that's still resonating it's last
[41:06] week wednesday is one who remembers that
[41:09] how many members the agapo
[41:11] and the filio so so think about that
[41:14] think about how this body should
[41:16] function
[41:17] without agapo
[41:19] and feel you yeah
[41:21] and think about the services that were
[41:23] preached on sunday night for me that was
[41:25] stood out was that you know everything
[41:27] should be done with the love on top i've
[41:29] never seen the only time when i saw
[41:32] a brother reading a scripture because
[41:34] they didn't have a meeting they didn't
[41:36] have a discussion first before they came
[41:38] to church the only time it was during
[41:40] our anniversary where a three pastors
[41:44] from
[41:45] miles and miles away
[41:47] three of them read the scripture
[41:50] same scripture and same verse
[41:52] brother ben and brother hannes and i
[41:54] think brother ivan or somebody
[41:56] read
[41:57] a scripture so only the spirit of god do
[42:00] such things
[42:01] it's not your questions that brother ben
[42:04] and brother dave read a scripture and
[42:06] put emphasis on the scripture of love
[42:10] of your brother and your sister that is
[42:11] what makes makes the body to thick
[42:14] if i can use that weight
[42:17] is it a is a cool way to say to tk or to
[42:21] to function properly
[42:23] so let's let's move on there and
[42:26] rather rather be transformed by the
[42:28] renewing of your mind that he may prove
[42:32] what is a what is that good and
[42:34] acceptable and perfect will of god
[42:39] right i want us to quickly jump to verse
[42:43] but i love all the verses let's go to
[42:45] the stream
[42:46] man this chapter is such i can't explain
[42:48] it let's read these three for i say
[42:51] through the grace given unto me to every
[42:54] man
[42:55] that is among you not to think of
[42:58] himself more highly than he thought to
[43:00] think that's what brother ben was saying
[43:03] that everything that i have
[43:05] i must think of it as it belongs to you
[43:08] and everything you have is mine too
[43:12] how do you like that
[43:16] meaning
[43:17] let me let me cut it deeper let me cut
[43:20] it deep you belong to me
[43:22] and i belong to
[43:24] you did i cut it more deeper is it too
[43:27] deep no why
[43:29] that's not so we belong to one another
[43:33] and that's the thinking about the body
[43:35] of the lord now i want you to take to to
[43:37] walk with me this journey i belong to
[43:39] you you belong to me so meaning that i
[43:42] am not there without you
[43:44] you are not there without
[43:47] come on brother
[43:49] so
[43:50] if i'm not there without you and you are
[43:53] not there without me
[43:54] that means we are we are a unit we are a
[43:58] body we are we are we are we are not
[44:01] just brothers and sisters we are
[44:03] brothers and sisters but we are a body
[44:05] which means we are something that must
[44:06] be like this
[44:09] are we together
[44:11] now
[44:12] to every man that that is among you not
[44:15] to think of himself more highly than he
[44:18] ought to think you know that kind of a
[44:20] spirit must not even be heard among us
[44:23] to think that i am here
[44:25] or i'm somewhere that brother is some
[44:27] way that's evil that's the demon spirit
[44:30] that one once it comes to your mind
[44:32] crack it
[44:33] hit it because and be careful because it
[44:36] realized the spirit like that can come
[44:39] and you are aware of it so it was not
[44:41] going to just come obvious
[44:43] ah it's not going to come over the devil
[44:46] will never come obvious even to eve he
[44:48] didn't come obvious
[44:50] he come in the bible calls it in a
[44:52] subtle way brother mario in a subtle way
[44:55] so that by the time you realize you have
[44:57] already done it
[44:59] that's how he works so we need to be to
[45:01] be renewed that transformed our mind
[45:07] but to think soberly
[45:09] according
[45:11] as god had telled to every man a measure
[45:14] of faith we must understand brothers and
[45:16] sisters that faith that we are talking
[45:18] about god has given it to us
[45:21] we didn't create and generate it to
[45:22] ourselves
[45:24] god created it for us
[45:26] and revealed it to us and we saw him so
[45:29] therefore my brother or my sister i can
[45:31] never say are you of weak faith no
[45:34] we must know that i am given a measure
[45:37] of faith and my brother is given a
[45:39] measure a measure it means
[45:41] as a portion of faith
[45:44] you know when you go get medicine they
[45:45] give you they give you a measure a
[45:47] measure for the medicine
[45:49] it's written there fifteen percent a
[45:51] fifteenth century
[45:52] fifteen mil sorry
[45:54] fifty meals
[45:55] five meals ten meals
[45:57] that you must now for a little child you
[46:00] give them 10 meals that's the measure
[46:02] and for another 50 ml that's the measure
[46:05] so god has given us a measure i don't
[46:07] know if he i don't know i don't i'm not
[46:08] saying he used meals
[46:10] but i'm saying he get the bible says he
[46:12] has given us a measure of faith
[46:15] therefore if you feel and you've got
[46:17] you've got the revelation you are not
[46:19] going to be able to to look at another
[46:21] brother differently
[46:24] amen are we together
[46:27] now this is what vest that i want us to
[46:29] reverse for
[46:31] for
[46:32] as we have many members in the body
[46:35] as we have many members in the world
[46:38] in the body
[46:40] and all members have not the same office
[46:44] in other words we do not have the same
[46:46] functions
[46:49] and
[46:50] think about think about your own body
[46:52] okay we'll get to that let's phrase this
[46:54] this verse quickly
[46:56] we have not the same office
[46:58] so
[46:59] we being men
[47:01] because we are many children of god we
[47:03] are many
[47:04] we many
[47:05] are one we are many but we are one
[47:10] in christ
[47:11] and everyone remember one of another i
[47:15] like i just love this
[47:20] did you catch it
[47:21] every one of us
[47:24] we belong to one how can i explain this
[47:26] and
[47:27] this ear
[47:30] belongs to this head
[47:33] and this mouth
[47:35] belongs to this
[47:36] hand
[47:38] because we are
[47:40] one
[47:42] we we may have different offices
[47:44] different when you when we talk of
[47:46] office don't think of the the deacon
[47:48] office or the pastor no no think about
[47:51] the functions think about the purpose
[47:54] that you are saving your position in the
[47:56] body we'll talk about it we may not
[47:58] finish this same one but we just i
[48:01] wanted to split it in about two or three
[48:02] parts but now for now we'll just lay a
[48:05] foundation
[48:06] because we'll talk later on about our
[48:08] spiritual body
[48:10] we'll talk about our local body as a
[48:13] church
[48:15] as an assembly we are a body
[48:18] and then there is a a a universal body
[48:21] of jesus christ a mystic body of the
[48:24] lord
[48:25] globally
[48:26] another one of your members is sitting
[48:29] right now maybe in a prison in china
[48:32] praying for you
[48:35] another one is sitting maybe in saudi
[48:38] arabia where you cannot walk with the
[48:40] bible for free
[48:42] ah freely he's sitting there praying for
[48:45] new zealand
[48:46] believers another one is sitting
[48:50] here in new zealand praying for a
[48:52] believer in bangladesh
[48:54] why
[48:56] because we are one for another
[48:58] we are one body eh
[49:00] so
[49:02] that verse i want to read it again so we
[49:04] being many
[49:06] are one body in christ and every one
[49:09] member one of another
[49:12] i think that this is clear
[49:14] corinthians first corinthians chapter
[49:17] six i'll read it quickly for you you can
[49:19] look on the board you don't have to page
[49:20] so that we can save time my my sister
[49:23] will put it and reflect it then i'll
[49:25] read it
[49:27] first corinthians
[49:28] six first corinthians 6
[49:33] if you if you if you got it my sister
[49:35] you you just put it over there amen
[49:39] first corinthians 6 verse 19.
[49:43] and what
[49:44] that's what this is that's that's that's
[49:46] how that's how it starts what
[49:49] knowing not that your body is the temple
[49:52] of the holy ghost
[49:54] which is in you
[49:55] which ye have of god and you are not
[49:58] your own
[50:00] you are not your own i've just told you
[50:02] to remember you don't belong to yourself
[50:07] amen
[50:09] for ye are born with a price therefore
[50:13] glorify god in your body
[50:16] and in your spirit which is
[50:19] with our gods they belong to god
[50:22] are we together god is our head
[50:24] and then we are the body so we are not
[50:27] we are not of ourselves
[50:29] we are for him we are for one another we
[50:32] are part of him and we belong to one
[50:34] another and him amen
[50:37] now let's talk about this little weight
[50:39] called discernment
[50:41] let's talk about the word discernment
[50:43] what is to descend
[50:46] to descend ah
[50:47] i i believe that weight is called more
[50:49] meaning than to perceive you know it has
[50:52] got a deeper meaning because to discern
[50:55] in the true meaning of that word you've
[50:57] got to use a certain spirit to be able
[51:00] to detect
[51:02] ah i find in that word wisdom
[51:05] i find anointing of the spirit in that
[51:07] way
[51:08] i find you know
[51:11] there's so many things loaded in that
[51:12] way
[51:13] you know to detect with a sense
[51:16] other than a vision
[51:18] it is more than just a vision
[51:20] to discern it's more than just to say oh
[51:22] i see
[51:23] i understand it's way more than that you
[51:26] are able to descend that is why it's
[51:29] also one of the nine spiritual gift a
[51:32] gift of discernment am i right
[51:34] so
[51:35] to recognize and identify
[51:38] as separate and distinct
[51:41] there's a problem when when a believer
[51:43] cannot separate between the thought of
[51:45] the devil and the thought of of
[51:48] god we must have a descendant a descent
[51:52] a descending spirit to be able to say ah
[51:54] this is the devil
[51:56] not to take it and walk along along the
[51:59] way ah
[52:00] wait a second you see so but with
[52:03] experience by faith and by the grace of
[52:06] god we get to that young people i
[52:08] suffered from that when i was young
[52:11] and i'll explain to you how i struggled
[52:14] with my thoughts
[52:15] just along with my thoughts i find
[52:17] myself talking alone saying
[52:19] not not being sure whether is this god
[52:21] or the devil
[52:22] you know
[52:23] some of you can identify with that and
[52:26] you find that the devil will come in
[52:27] such a way where you cannot pick it up
[52:29] so you need the sp the spirit of god to
[52:32] help you to descend
[52:35] and the wisdom of god in that way
[52:37] there's so many things loaded in that
[52:39] word of discernment hallelujah the
[52:41] quality of being able to grasp and
[52:44] comprehend what is obscure
[52:48] you know something that is obscure
[52:50] it's not straight
[52:52] it's not
[52:53] it's not plain it's obscure
[52:56] it's so if you are able to to identify
[53:01] something that is obscure
[53:04] in the spiritual realm the way you live
[53:06] every day
[53:07] then you will say that you are able to
[53:09] descend
[53:10] the ability to spiritually distinguish
[53:13] between right and wrong spiritually
[53:17] because everything that we do brothers
[53:19] and sisters in our lives
[53:21] if it cannot uh
[53:24] okay let me put it this way i like to
[53:26] take everything to to apply it on the
[53:29] spiritual realm what it means to me
[53:31] i like to do that because everything
[53:34] that we do for a believer the prophet
[53:36] says everything that we do
[53:40] we must be thinking about god in it
[53:42] everything
[53:44] whether our business
[53:46] whether you're going to eat
[53:48] whether you're going to comb your hair
[53:51] sister maggie whether you're going to
[53:52] shower we welcome my dear sister esther
[53:55] whether you are going to
[53:57] another one can ask and say oh brother
[53:58] how can i brush my teeth and apply that
[54:01] spiritually ah you can
[54:03] think about it
[54:05] yeah
[54:06] oh i want to scratch myself how can
[54:08] everything
[54:10] think about the lord huh i want to think
[54:13] how what could this be meaning in my
[54:15] life spiritually
[54:17] if i don't scratch and i'm itching what
[54:18] will happen
[54:21] i like to think like
[54:22] that so think about
[54:26] everything for a believer is so
[54:27] important because you are a very very
[54:29] very important person there are people
[54:32] that are called vips
[54:34] and that those that are called the vvips
[54:39] you know them do you know them
[54:41] you are way more than that
[54:44] i want to announce to you tonight
[54:46] that you are way more than because look
[54:49] look at it this way if jesus christ
[54:54] can live heaven and earth
[54:56] i mean can leave heaven
[54:58] and come here
[54:59] to come and die for you who are you
[55:02] who let me ask you it's not the root way
[55:04] hey just understand what i'm trying to
[55:06] say who do you think you are
[55:10] you who do you think you are
[55:11] that jesus christ must come and die for
[55:13] you for your sins for you to be forgiven
[55:18] who do you think you are are you
[55:20] realizing who you are
[55:23] you are very very important sister kay
[55:26] be vip is an understatement
[55:31] no expression of this world can explain
[55:34] who you are
[55:35] and then we are in the same body
[55:38] another one is a toe a toe what do we
[55:41] call it the toe toe
[55:43] toe toe whatever because the making what
[55:46] do you call it at all
[55:48] another one is actually a small toe
[55:51] i would love to be a small toe
[55:54] another one
[55:56] is just a
[55:57] piece of hair here
[56:00] another one is just a
[56:04] you know
[56:05] there's something inside the body is
[56:07] called the pancreas
[56:09] those who did biology
[56:11] another one
[56:13] is what we call a neuron in a body
[56:16] neuron it's like
[56:18] some some signals that send messages
[56:20] through the body you'll find them
[56:22] everywhere in the body neurons
[56:24] just like veins of the transpose blood
[56:27] and oxygen and food some of some of you
[56:30] are dead imagine if you are transporting
[56:32] you are you are you are the main
[56:34] capillary
[56:35] that transport blood
[56:38] and
[56:39] oxygen
[56:40] blood to the heart and bed
[56:44] imagine if you are dead
[56:46] so
[56:48] in this body of the lord you are
[56:50] extremely important if you are not
[56:52] and you are at all the lord would not
[56:55] have made you
[56:57] you are so important that's the point of
[56:59] the patch that i want you to understand
[57:01] that you you have been born with a great
[57:04] press
[57:06] and a son of the king and a daughter of
[57:09] the king will conduct themselves
[57:12] and behave
[57:14] and
[57:15] handle themselves
[57:17] in the way of the king
[57:19] because you're not just a you're not
[57:20] just a sister no
[57:23] what is so wonderful about this is that
[57:25] we don't go out breaking
[57:27] all we go out doing is to find our
[57:30] brothers and our sisters
[57:32] and bring them amen for them to know who
[57:35] they are
[57:36] you have been born with a great price
[57:39] and that means that
[57:40] you are part of this important body of
[57:43] the lord
[57:44] and have to conduct yourself in the same
[57:47] way
[57:49] it's not a choice it's not whether you
[57:51] like it or you don't like it no you have
[57:52] to
[57:55] am i putting it in a in a democratic way
[57:58] okay the bible says you must be born
[58:01] again it's not about you you may be born
[58:03] again or not no you must be
[58:07] born again
[58:09] it's not whether no no it's my choice it
[58:11] is your choice of course the problem is
[58:13] that if you are going to approach it
[58:15] with the anchor that says it's my choice
[58:17] i cannot i cannot i can take it or i can
[58:20] leave it
[58:21] you see
[58:22] you will simply just be showing that on
[58:25] me i'm not part of that body
[58:27] because tomorrow you can today you can't
[58:30] a real person who is part of that body
[58:32] you're talking about realizes that as
[58:34] paul said i am a prisoner
[58:38] of love divine
[58:40] not just a prisoner a prisoner of jesus
[58:43] christ is not a suffering prisoner
[58:47] is a prisoner of love divine
[58:50] have you never heard of a
[58:52] a a a a a young man saying to a young
[58:54] girl that you've taken me prison have
[58:56] you never heard of such a statement
[58:58] it does not mean that he's a prisoner
[59:00] that he's hitting him every day
[59:03] no it's a prisoner of love
[59:07] how can i explain this mama shall not eh
[59:10] that's that's what we are so we are
[59:12] being imprisoned
[59:14] in this body
[59:16] you can't say no no no me i don't no no
[59:19] okay
[59:21] i want to say that i've got no choice
[59:24] but to love the lord because he chose me
[59:25] i mean he died for me
[59:28] thank you jesus amen
[59:30] now let's we have under we we try to
[59:33] unpack the word discernment
[59:35] and now
[59:37] this this body that we are talking about
[59:40] uh that that must have a discernment are
[59:43] we together
[59:44] it says that
[59:46] we need to look at them uh how does it
[59:49] continue to function how does it
[59:51] continue to be together
[59:53] how how if you think of your body how
[59:56] does your body continue to function
[59:58] huh how does it continue to get strong
[1:00:01] how does it continue to to proceed with
[1:00:03] life

[1:00:10] 13 teenager now you grow up you know you
[1:00:12] marry how do you continue and you serve
[1:00:14] the lord how do you continue it's
[1:00:16] because there are things that you do
[1:00:18] throughout your journey in life are we
[1:00:20] together so and that's the life of a
[1:00:22] believer in this body that we are
[1:00:23] talking about we are just laying a
[1:00:25] foundation today now in this body that
[1:00:27] we are talking about is that we find
[1:00:28] that there is what you call communion
[1:00:31] and a communion
[1:00:33] what we do here and eat the bread and
[1:00:36] drink the wine
[1:00:38] and
[1:00:39] it's just a physical illustration
[1:00:42] of the true communion it's not the
[1:00:44] communion
[1:00:45] don't tell the pastor that i said this
[1:00:50] what i'm trying to say is that true
[1:00:52] communion is when you and the lord jesus
[1:00:55] christ are communing amen is when you
[1:00:57] are communing with the lord just coming
[1:01:00] here and eating the bread and drinking
[1:01:02] the wine that does not make it a
[1:01:03] communion if you are not communing with
[1:01:05] the lord
[1:01:06] that is an outside demonstration or
[1:01:10] illustration of the job that is
[1:01:12] happening inside amen
[1:01:17] so
[1:01:19] that's why paul wrote to this scripture
[1:01:21] that don't eat
[1:01:22] and drink unworthily
[1:01:24] and wait anywhere inside commune with
[1:01:27] the lord
[1:01:29] before you come here and you come here
[1:01:32] right and you're just doing the outside
[1:01:35] work
[1:01:36] are we together now communion is a
[1:01:38] fellowship with god inside your body
[1:01:41] i want us to think about the spiritual
[1:01:43] body our inside body
[1:01:46] inside body
[1:01:48] but we use the comparison of the outside
[1:01:50] body how it works so that we can relate
[1:01:52] to this body i'll throw in examples of a
[1:01:54] physical body but the main body that i
[1:01:56] want us to focus on is this spiritual
[1:01:58] body our one
[1:02:00] later on we'll come and talk about our
[1:02:02] body as a church
[1:02:04] that's where we are going to stand up
[1:02:06] the whole service
[1:02:10] then we'll talk about later on about our
[1:02:12] body globally
[1:02:15] but this body of mind spiritually inside
[1:02:19] that is supposed to it's supposed to be
[1:02:21] communing fellowshipping with god
[1:02:23] fellowshipping but now the problem is
[1:02:25] this
[1:02:26] if on the outside i am unable to
[1:02:29] fellowship with brothers and sisters
[1:02:33] i'm unable to fellowship to intercede
[1:02:35] for them i'm unable to enter in on
[1:02:38] behalf of
[1:02:40] do you think i'll do it with the lord
[1:02:43] if you or i cannot sacrifice because
[1:02:46] fellowship is more than just coming
[1:02:48] together
[1:02:50] and we say let's bring the rice
[1:02:52] and the food that is good fellowship i
[1:02:54] like it
[1:02:55] but it's more than that when we sit
[1:02:57] there fellowshipping that by sister
[1:02:58] jenny it that's the outside fellowship
[1:03:01] we are supposed to be fellowshipping in
[1:03:03] spirit talking to one another what has
[1:03:05] the lord done for you this week my
[1:03:07] brother hey what did the lord do oh
[1:03:09] brother you know the lord we are
[1:03:10] fellowshipping all right take it from me
[1:03:13] brother you can count on me i'll be
[1:03:15] praying for you tonight
[1:03:16] and then you must pray
[1:03:19] that is the real fellowship
[1:03:21] when we enter into one another's problem
[1:03:24] not selectively
[1:03:26] let me put it no no no no no we cannot
[1:03:28] choose
[1:03:29] this this this thing i cannot choose
[1:03:32] where it wants to scratch in the body
[1:03:33] and where it can scratch no when he's
[1:03:36] told by the head office scratch there
[1:03:38] it's crashes there
[1:03:40] when he told to to to scratch here it
[1:03:43] does i'm not gonna choose anything no
[1:03:45] new my friend is brother edwan and
[1:03:48] brother isaac
[1:03:50] i brought the pen is not yeah yeah yeah
[1:03:52] yeah yeah
[1:03:53] baby yeah i'll go visit damian no
[1:03:57] are you part of the body
[1:03:59] do you descend the body do you
[1:04:01] understand the body of the lord
[1:04:03] huh
[1:04:04] imagine imagine you are saying to your
[1:04:07] eyes in the morning open you must go to
[1:04:09] where they say no
[1:04:11] [Laughter]
[1:04:13] is that that eyes are not supposed to be
[1:04:15] on your head
[1:04:17] because they don't understand the
[1:04:19] purpose of why they're there
[1:04:23] if you want to eat and your mouth don't
[1:04:25] want to open
[1:04:26] that mouth is supposed to be removed and
[1:04:28] we bring a new mouth
[1:04:30] because it's not doing what the body is
[1:04:34] supposed to do
[1:04:37] huh if you
[1:04:38] you requests are being made you don't
[1:04:41] take them seriously
[1:04:42] is are you part of the body are you
[1:04:44] taking the body seriously maybe we must
[1:04:47] take it further home
[1:04:49] and say maybe maybe we must start to
[1:04:51] think as to whether we are taking
[1:04:52] ourselves seriously
[1:04:54] ourselves first
[1:04:57] our us as individuals
[1:04:59] what we eat what we wear
[1:05:02] how we walk how we talk
[1:05:04] how we think
[1:05:06] fast because maybe it's difficult to do
[1:05:08] it for someone if you can't do it for
[1:05:09] yourself
[1:05:11] let's start day
[1:05:12] grade one year one
[1:05:14] ah
[1:05:15] it's not just remember year one you may
[1:05:17] say it's year one it's as important as
[1:05:20] yeti
[1:05:21] very important
[1:05:22] but is here one
[1:05:26] so
[1:05:27] if we are able to understand how our
[1:05:30] bodies function
[1:05:32] to understand how our physical bodies
[1:05:34] function you cannot just go and eat eggs
[1:05:37] when they tell you you are allergic to
[1:05:38] eggs and you react and you just count
[1:05:40] them
[1:05:43] and you react
[1:05:44] of course maybe you've got faith brother
[1:05:46] is again
[1:05:47] maybe you've got strong faith but what
[1:05:50] is going to prove that
[1:05:52] you have changed that situation of alice
[1:05:54] is when you eat them and you don't react
[1:05:57] that's the right way
[1:05:58] but the moment the doctor tells you
[1:06:00] hey
[1:06:02] hey don't eat
[1:06:04] this
[1:06:05] because you are acting you swell the
[1:06:07] whole body and when you eat your body
[1:06:09] it's got this this this and you just go
[1:06:11] and do you need to know your body
[1:06:12] to understand how your body functions
[1:06:15] and understand how your body is not just
[1:06:17] the outside how you look no even your
[1:06:20] moods
[1:06:22] even your mood
[1:06:24] how your moods affect you affects others
[1:06:29] but you see there is a
[1:06:32] a golden threat
[1:06:34] that runs through this booth
[1:06:36] this golden thread is called the holy
[1:06:38] spirit
[1:06:40] ah
[1:06:41] if you go through the whole body you
[1:06:43] will find out that there is a common
[1:06:44] fact in the whole body
[1:06:47] who can tell you the common factors
[1:06:49] something that you can go anywhere in
[1:06:51] the body and you find it who can tell me
[1:06:55] so you are not in a classroom i just
[1:06:57] want us to participate
[1:06:58] who can tell me
[1:07:00] some of the common things i can say
[1:07:02] blood
[1:07:03] because you find blood almost 97 percent
[1:07:06] of of the body isn't it
[1:07:09] you know the veins you know those veins
[1:07:10] those thin thin veins
[1:07:13] the veins you find dna dna
[1:07:16] everywhere in the body
[1:07:18] so there are certain things that what
[1:07:20] runs through our dna
[1:07:22] as a body
[1:07:23] you as a body as a believer as a person
[1:07:27] you need to be able to say lord give me
[1:07:30] a discernment of myself spiritually
[1:07:33] to be able to know where you're going
[1:07:36] where you're coming how you do how your
[1:07:38] relationship you relate with the lord on
[1:07:40] a daily basis am i am i
[1:07:42] am i clear
[1:07:44] spiritual discernment the prophet says
[1:07:46] here our churches are broken up
[1:07:50] men dividing themselves separating
[1:07:52] themselves not
[1:07:53] not not seemingly to have the faith
[1:07:56] splitting hairs over little
[1:07:58] insignificant doctrines
[1:08:00] we should come together arm and heart
[1:08:03] and pray and fast
[1:08:06] and call until god sends back the holy
[1:08:08] ghost
[1:08:09] that we
[1:08:10] might have spiritual discernment
[1:08:15] that's the prophet in the book of
[1:08:17] discernment
[1:08:19] descending the body of of the lord
[1:08:22] 1959. we if we can't understand our
[1:08:26] bodies brothers and sisters we will have
[1:08:27] a big problem
[1:08:28] listen to this
[1:08:30] a woman that dresses herself like that
[1:08:32] she's going to to be guilty of adultery
[1:08:36] this is an example i'm not saying our
[1:08:38] women are not wearing i'm trying to to
[1:08:40] drive a certain point
[1:08:42] now at the day of judgement you might be
[1:08:45] as pure as a lily
[1:08:48] to your husband
[1:08:50] or your boyfriend but jesus said
[1:08:54] whosoever looked upon a woman to last
[1:08:57] after her had committed adultery with
[1:09:00] her in his heart already
[1:09:03] so you might not have done anything
[1:09:06] wrong
[1:09:07] actually but when you dress yourself
[1:09:11] like that you presented yourself to the
[1:09:14] man he is going to have to answer for
[1:09:17] committing adultery and you are to blame
[1:09:21] and the church is permitting that not
[1:09:23] descending the lord's body
[1:09:28] i can feel the silence but it's not me
[1:09:31] that's what the prophet
[1:09:33] you see
[1:09:34] so you need to be able to descend not
[1:09:36] just your spiritual body also your
[1:09:38] physical body because it resembles your
[1:09:40] spiritual body that's the prophet right
[1:09:43] we need to be able to understand how our
[1:09:45] bodies both spiritually physically
[1:09:47] functions
[1:09:48] right
[1:09:49] now i wonder same message i wonder
[1:09:52] sometimes if we can descend right from
[1:09:54] wrong
[1:09:55] for our own bodies that's the prophecy
[1:09:58] of our own bodies especially the lord's
[1:10:00] body see the prophet is saying our
[1:10:02] bodies are important but the most
[1:10:04] important one is the lord's body man
[1:10:06] the lord's body you don't want your
[1:10:08] brother not to enter heaven because of
[1:10:10] you do you
[1:10:12] you would like your brother to enter
[1:10:13] heaven because of you
[1:10:17] because why you understand the body of
[1:10:19] the lord you can be able to descend
[1:10:25] hallelujah
[1:10:27] are we together brothers and sisters
[1:10:31] amen
[1:10:32] let's let's let's read let's read here
[1:10:34] same message
[1:10:36] so
[1:10:39] what is the body of the lord
[1:10:43] another one can say it's a group of
[1:10:45] believers
[1:10:47] another one can say is the church
[1:10:51] another one can say is the whole world
[1:10:53] people of god
[1:10:55] and they are all still right
[1:10:57] but let's hear here what the prophet
[1:10:59] says
[1:11:00] not only do we
[1:11:02] in this day are guilty of the same crime
[1:11:04] that paul was rebuking the corinthian
[1:11:07] church for
[1:11:08] but of trying to do something that the
[1:11:11] lord had commanded without descending
[1:11:14] the body of the lord and the body of the
[1:11:16] lord is the believers
[1:11:20] that's the body of the lord
[1:11:21] is there believers
[1:11:23] so when you're sitting next to your
[1:11:25] brother just know that you are not just
[1:11:27] sitting next to a person
[1:11:29] when you are sitting next to your
[1:11:30] brother or your sister you are not just
[1:11:32] sitting next to an individual that you
[1:11:34] happen to know that happened to be your
[1:11:37] son that happened to be your daughter
[1:11:40] that happened to be your your son no no
[1:11:44] you are is the body of the moment we
[1:11:46] come through that door
[1:11:48] there's no mama papa
[1:11:51] his brothers and sisters you are sitting
[1:11:53] next to a brother and a sister someone
[1:11:56] who
[1:11:57] through that person you
[1:11:59] are going to be able to walk as a body
[1:12:03] and enter into heaven
[1:12:05] that's how important we are for one
[1:12:07] another and to one another now we want
[1:12:11] to think of jesus and associating what
[1:12:14] he was what
[1:12:15] is his body what is the body of christ
[1:12:19] it is the body of believers that's
[1:12:21] associated with him in the spirit
[1:12:25] in that spirit that is why the brother
[1:12:27] read the scripture and he said we must
[1:12:30] worship god in truth and in spirit
[1:12:34] you cannot worship god without the
[1:12:36] spirit
[1:12:39] we associate with jesus christ with him
[1:12:41] in the holy spirit
[1:12:44] not an idol
[1:12:45] you know we we can idolize our lord
[1:12:48] jesus christ
[1:12:49] we can idolize him and not worship him
[1:12:51] in truth and in spirit but he's just our
[1:12:54] god oh we just you see but there's no
[1:12:57] relation there's no truth and spirit
[1:12:59] brother ben is it you or david one of
[1:13:01] you read the scripture
[1:13:03] in truth and in spirit that's what this
[1:13:05] this verse is talking about here i mean
[1:13:07] that's what the prophet is trying to
[1:13:08] talk about in the message of communion
[1:13:10] and they are associated together
[1:13:13] in jesus christ in the spirit and
[1:13:15] together
[1:13:17] you must love your brother so much
[1:13:20] until
[1:13:21] and this is not a joke
[1:13:22] that when he gives you a chung gum you
[1:13:24] must eat it
[1:13:26] to show that yeah i love my brother
[1:13:29] huh
[1:13:30] yeah brother ben choose it and when he's
[1:13:32] halfway through the sugar finish he pass
[1:13:34] it on to me
[1:13:35] because i love my brother if i can't do
[1:13:38] that my love is questionable
[1:13:45] said
[1:13:46] we must love one another so much until
[1:13:48] we can eat each other's sugar
[1:13:51] you can't do it just go pray
[1:13:56] and the lord can help
[1:13:58] you we are associated with one another
[1:14:02] that when a man and god talk to each
[1:14:04] other sons and daughters of god mortal
[1:14:07] men through the shading of the blood
[1:14:09] broad remission of sins and this man and
[1:14:12] this woman boy or girl that he has
[1:14:15] fellowship with christ is communing with
[1:14:17] him the body
[1:14:20] you're talking about that communion is
[1:14:22] to talk is to talk back
[1:14:25] it talks back you talk it talks back
[1:14:27] when we talk to one another we are
[1:14:29] eating from one another
[1:14:33] we are eating from one another therefore
[1:14:35] you do not talk to your brother and then
[1:14:37] you talk to him but what you are feeding
[1:14:39] him is not
[1:14:40] the vitamins you are fitting your
[1:14:42] brother poison
[1:14:44] i'm fellowshipping with you i'm supposed
[1:14:46] to be eating vitamin a vitamin c of the
[1:14:49] weight i'm supposed to be eating those
[1:14:51] things when i'm fellowshipping with you
[1:14:53] one in my mind imagine if all the time
[1:14:56] i'm eating even wrong thoughts
[1:14:59] negative ones
[1:15:02] what am i doing to my body
[1:15:04] somewhere the prophet said these
[1:15:05] diseases that we see they are brought by
[1:15:08] worry
[1:15:09] by negative thoughts by all sorts of
[1:15:11] negative attitudes they bring diseases
[1:15:14] and problems to us to us they make us
[1:15:16] sick
[1:15:17] now imagine if i'm talking to brother
[1:15:19] ben all the time me and him when we talk
[1:15:21] we say hey that boy david we don't even
[1:15:24] call him a brother we say that boy
[1:15:26] imagine why we are feeding one another
[1:15:30] this is just a a minor example
[1:15:33] the biggest battle is in here
[1:15:36] when you are having a fellowship with
[1:15:38] the lord
[1:15:39] supposedly and then you are
[1:15:42] just critical
[1:15:45] the brother mentioned you on sunday he
[1:15:46] said you know we must be in a position
[1:15:48] where we forgive our brother even before
[1:15:50] they say it
[1:15:52] i like that
[1:15:54] before they ask you
[1:15:56] because forgiveness is not an option
[1:15:58] you have no option the moment you say
[1:16:00] lord forgive me
[1:16:02] because i forgive others have you
[1:16:04] forgiven them
[1:16:05] from your heart
[1:16:07] wholeheartedly
[1:16:11] because i must forgive wholeheartedly
[1:16:12] before brother ben or brother david
[1:16:15] asked me oh brother kira say before he
[1:16:17] says sorry dad i must forgive him and
[1:16:20] his heart when the boy repeats it
[1:16:29] so i must love him beyond that
[1:16:32] and forgive him and he must forgive me
[1:16:35] too
[1:16:37] because i'm also human i can hear before
[1:16:39] brother mary will say brother
[1:16:41] brother don't even mention it i love you
[1:16:43] to the moon and back
[1:16:48] hallelujah we are closing we're gonna
[1:16:50] pause and we'll continue some other time
[1:16:52] but i can promise you next time when we
[1:16:54] talk it's gonna be honey in the rock
[1:16:57] i know this is just you know when you're
[1:16:58] digging honey and then you just start
[1:17:00] with the starters there and then some of
[1:17:02] them is not so sweet but just mixing up
[1:17:04] with the wax there what we're gonna go
[1:17:05] into the real honey juicy one
[1:17:10] hey man
[1:17:11] let's just
[1:17:12] quickly jump
[1:17:14] to this part now we come to realize
[1:17:17] brothers and sisters that the bigger
[1:17:19] part of how a body functions
[1:17:22] huh
[1:17:23] of how a body functions
[1:17:24] you know it's about eating
[1:17:27] it's about what you eat
[1:17:30] it's about what you feed the body
[1:17:32] clothing i can see clothing only came
[1:17:35] later on the lord made
[1:17:37] some clothes just for them to cover you
[1:17:39] know the fig trees and but eating
[1:17:42] is the thing that started even from the
[1:17:44] garden of eating that was the first
[1:17:45] thing eating
[1:17:48] so we found that eating has got a
[1:17:50] significant impact on the body
[1:17:53] now listen to this you partake in the
[1:17:56] eating of the body of the lord which is
[1:17:58] the bread of life huh
[1:18:00] the lord jesus christ said i am the
[1:18:02] bread of life
[1:18:03] now john chapter 6 he says 6 verse 47
[1:18:06] very literally i say unto you he that
[1:18:09] believeth on me
[1:18:10] had everlasting life
[1:18:12] i am the bread of life
[1:18:15] said jesus huh your father that did eat
[1:18:19] manna in the wilderness and i did
[1:18:22] physical manner
[1:18:24] this is the bread which cometh down from
[1:18:26] heaven that a man must eat thereof and
[1:18:29] not die
[1:18:31] which means if you eat anything else you
[1:18:33] die
[1:18:34] together
[1:18:36] none of you can tell me now that since
[1:18:39] the morning you never ate
[1:18:43] how many did not eat since this morning
[1:18:47] we ate something
[1:18:49] so eating
[1:18:51] eating forms part of our life the bigger
[1:18:54] part of our life is we eat
[1:18:57] our communication our thoughts our
[1:19:00] everything we eat
[1:19:02] that is why the bible said men cannot
[1:19:04] live by bread alone
[1:19:06] physically but by every weed
[1:19:09] that cometh from the mouth of god now
[1:19:11] you are part of god you and me are part
[1:19:13] of god that means the word that come
[1:19:15] from us and to one another ministering
[1:19:18] and to one another they are life
[1:19:20] they give life or they can take it away
[1:19:23] that's how powerful you are so we need
[1:19:25] to understand the importance of our role
[1:19:28] in a body
[1:19:32] you need to understand the importance
[1:19:34] of our what is going on in here and in
[1:19:37] here daily
[1:19:38] and
[1:19:39] cast out that which is not right for my
[1:19:41] body and i keep what is of the lord
[1:19:44] hallelujah
[1:19:46] i am the living bread which come down
[1:19:48] from heaven if any man eat of this bread
[1:19:51] he shall live forever and the bread that
[1:19:54] i will give is my flesh which i will
[1:19:57] give you
[1:19:59] which i'll give for the life of the
[1:20:01] world that is where decided to kill him
[1:20:04] no wonder that is why i decided to want
[1:20:05] to kill him when he said i'm if you eat
[1:20:08] my my my flesh and drink my blood and it
[1:20:11] was true he was right
[1:20:13] because he is the bread of life they did
[1:20:15] not get it amen so you cannot eat
[1:20:19] food
[1:20:21] i'm sorry for those that select but you
[1:20:23] cannot one when mama dishes played for
[1:20:25] you
[1:20:27] you can't selectively want to eat it no
[1:20:30] everything must be finished
[1:20:32] vegetables
[1:20:34] meat
[1:20:35] everything
[1:20:37] you know if you go to the president's
[1:20:38] house you dish and you
[1:20:41] i remember ate curry was it curry and
[1:20:43] rice system
[1:20:44] the last time and i realized that i must
[1:20:46] finish this plate and even though i said
[1:20:49] no i'm not hungry
[1:20:50] but
[1:20:51] you cannot
[1:20:53] if you you don't finish your food you're
[1:20:55] actually offending the person who cooked
[1:20:57] for you
[1:20:59] also my wife when she dies for you she
[1:21:01] doesn't want someone who's busy on their
[1:21:03] phone
[1:21:04] or doing something no focus on your
[1:21:06] plate and finish it
[1:21:10] so if you visit my house and you're
[1:21:12] gonna finish your food just know
[1:21:15] that that you're offending my wife
[1:21:19] so
[1:21:20] now you must finish your plate because
[1:21:23] everything that the lord has given for
[1:21:25] you is for your good
[1:21:27] and is to build you and then you cannot
[1:21:29] allow anything to come in there any fly
[1:21:32] or anything that comes there you show it
[1:21:35] yes
[1:21:36] nothing foreign must come in my plate
[1:21:37] that the lord has given me i must eat
[1:21:39] only the lord jesus the devil come and
[1:21:42] fly because he knows the smell he knows
[1:21:44] the smell of food the devil check when
[1:21:46] you cook
[1:21:47] how many flies wants to come there
[1:21:50] even visitors they can come just
[1:21:52] i was just saying hello no no they smell
[1:21:54] the bacon
[1:21:56] then they thought they can just say
[1:21:57] hello are you all good
[1:22:00] the smell of food so when you are given
[1:22:03] food eat it and finish it
[1:22:06] vegetables every
[1:22:07] you little ones amen
[1:22:11] we cannot finish this i'm going to stop
[1:22:13] and then uh let's just go one one or two
[1:22:16] more pages how many has two
[1:22:18] brothers
[1:22:21] okay maybe somebody has three pages okay
[1:22:25] oh my friend that's my bosom friend abe
[1:22:28] he wants three pages
[1:22:30] so we'll go for three pages
[1:22:32] as minister abby have told us and then
[1:22:34] we can close
[1:22:36] praise the lord you are you are my
[1:22:38] minister
[1:22:39] but today we are doing things
[1:22:42] not descending any of the word of god
[1:22:46] we should have a discernment on
[1:22:47] everything that we do
[1:22:49] the prophet didn't say something or
[1:22:51] spiritual things no everything
[1:22:55] i it ought to be measured by the word of
[1:22:58] god ah even my closing
[1:23:01] oh come on yes
[1:23:03] even how i cut my hair yeah even how i
[1:23:07] walk
[1:23:08] everything
[1:23:10] how i think how i look
[1:23:12] everything because the bible says
[1:23:14] everything that you do by weight or by
[1:23:16] deed do it in the name of jesus christ
[1:23:20] so can you walk like that in the name of
[1:23:22] jesus christ
[1:23:25] like you're going to the tavern
[1:23:29] you know
[1:23:31] can you do that no no you don't work
[1:23:33] like that
[1:23:34] huh
[1:23:35] before the lord
[1:23:38] the bible says we must walk upright
[1:23:40] before the lord
[1:23:42] walk upright
[1:23:43] am i right dave yeah that's true
[1:23:45] so when we come to the lord even our
[1:23:47] work changes if i used to walk like that
[1:23:49] you know when i was a young boy i never
[1:23:51] used to talk like the way you see me i
[1:23:52] was working differently so all these
[1:23:55] young guys they think that we were never
[1:23:56] young people
[1:23:58] they think that we never we never did
[1:24:01] things and try to be clever no we try
[1:24:04] hard
[1:24:06] very hard but here i'm standing in front
[1:24:09] of you now
[1:24:10] why
[1:24:11] if one's a son of god always
[1:24:15] he's gonna find you
[1:24:17] and don't wait to be found in a painful
[1:24:19] way
[1:24:20] come surrendering
[1:24:22] come surrendering
[1:24:24] amen
[1:24:26] i'll read this one
[1:24:27] pass it
[1:24:29] now
[1:24:30] another thing we take food for is to
[1:24:33] build our body to resist diseases
[1:24:36] are we together
[1:24:38] we take food so that we can resist
[1:24:41] diseases diseases are from the devil
[1:24:44] are we together
[1:24:46] meaning that when we take our food
[1:24:48] spiritually we keep spiritual diseases
[1:24:50] away
[1:24:52] we keep the devil away
[1:24:54] do not come here and not eat the word of
[1:24:56] god and you think just by coming to
[1:24:58] church only the diseases of spiritual
[1:25:00] diseases will go they will never go they
[1:25:02] will come you will sneeze and have
[1:25:04] spiritual flu every
[1:25:06] time
[1:25:08] why
[1:25:09] you are not eating your food
[1:25:12] but physically you are every day
[1:25:16] every day you make sure you eat three
[1:25:18] meals
[1:25:20] naturally it just happens why doesn't it
[1:25:21] happen in your spiritual natural body
[1:25:25] if there's such a thing sister know me i
[1:25:26] don't know
[1:25:27] our spiritual natural body why doesn't
[1:25:30] it just happen that we just find
[1:25:31] ourselves eating four meals a day
[1:25:34] what happened
[1:25:35] let's ask the lord to transform our
[1:25:38] minds amen
[1:25:39] not to be conformed to the nature and
[1:25:42] culture of just not reading when you
[1:25:44] just read five verses you feel who have
[1:25:46] done something for god no that's how
[1:25:48] you're supposed to live
[1:25:50] it's supposed to be your second culture
[1:25:52] where eating and praying and eating the
[1:25:54] word is just your nature
[1:25:57] it's possible
[1:25:58] it is possible why because even people
[1:26:01] who don't believe god they can dedicate
[1:26:04] themselves to do certain things just
[1:26:06] based on natural ability and they can do
[1:26:09] that
[1:26:10] so if it can happen physically
[1:26:14] it has already happened spiritually so
[1:26:16] we can do it young people we can do it
[1:26:21] keep diseases away if you don't take
[1:26:23] food and let your body get weak then
[1:26:25] it's subject to diseases diseases will
[1:26:27] break right into the bloodstream and
[1:26:29] here you're gone if your blood isn't
[1:26:32] rich and pure we're well then
[1:26:34] that would it will disease will go right
[1:26:37] into your bloodstream so you've got to
[1:26:39] eat good nourishing food
[1:26:42] to keep your body stream right that's
[1:26:45] what the prophet says here
[1:26:47] we are going to stop
[1:26:49] and
[1:26:51] if you'll forgive me because i said to
[1:26:52] everybody
[1:26:54] three pages but now i have i think i
[1:26:56] have to cut it for you my friend because
[1:26:57] my time is finished
[1:26:59] so
[1:27:00] i want to pause here because this
[1:27:02] someone i want to really take it slowly
[1:27:05] to understand the functioning of the
[1:27:07] body i know you do know but we are here
[1:27:09] to refresh
[1:27:11] to remind
[1:27:12] to encourage one another that our bodies
[1:27:16] are so complicated our bodies we we
[1:27:19] don't know actually our bodies are so
[1:27:22] deep
[1:27:23] deep complicated systems that are going
[1:27:26] through our bodies
[1:27:27] that we have we will be very careful
[1:27:30] even
[1:27:31] what we eat
[1:27:33] i know of guys who started to talk funny
[1:27:35] and they ended up walking like that you
[1:27:38] know
[1:27:38] even their bed they hurt themselves
[1:27:41] but they started just like a
[1:27:43] joke a cool thing
[1:27:45] our bodies are so complicated
[1:27:47] now now imagine if our bodies are so
[1:27:50] multifaceted and
[1:27:53] how will the spiritual body of the lord
[1:27:55] be
[1:27:57] it's very deep
[1:27:58] it's very deep so we mean so much to one
[1:28:01] another we mean so much to the lord we
[1:28:03] mean so much
[1:28:04] and he means so much to us so we need to
[1:28:06] come to the point where we are able to
[1:28:08] discern
[1:28:10] the body in other words to be very
[1:28:12] sensitive to the spirit
[1:28:14] to be able to know when the spirit talks
[1:28:17] to you
[1:28:19] just getting out of the bus or the train
[1:28:21] the lord starting to talk to you and you
[1:28:23] are not hearing him
[1:28:26] you are not picking him ah
[1:28:28] we need to be sensitive
[1:28:30] to be able to discern
[1:28:33] what is going on in us
[1:28:35] around us
[1:28:37] he's so sensitive the holy spirit that
[1:28:40] a little child can just run and he can
[1:28:42] just fly
[1:28:43] and stand there
[1:28:45] he's been disturbed
[1:28:47] but he's so cool he's so powerful
[1:28:49] he he doesn't take time to come the
[1:28:51] moment you say lord forgive me and we
[1:28:53] surrender ourselves he comes back right
[1:28:55] straight
[1:28:57] in the atmosphere in your heart
[1:28:59] that is he's so timid the prophet says
[1:29:01] the holy spirit is so timid he's so he's
[1:29:04] so sensitive
[1:29:05] i don't know if you have ever seen a
[1:29:06] very sensitive needle
[1:29:09] you know a needle so sensitive to to
[1:29:11] anything it moves
[1:29:13] yeah maybe if any of you who has ever
[1:29:15] watched them
[1:29:17] you know uh
[1:29:18] in the stock markets the currencies
[1:29:21] you know when they display on the big
[1:29:22] board how the currencies move every
[1:29:25] second mini second you know currency is
[1:29:27] the the graph is so sensitive the moment
[1:29:30] they say obama is normal president
[1:29:32] the dollar goes down
[1:29:34] everything is so sensitive
[1:29:36] so
[1:29:37] our
[1:29:38] holy spirit is so sensitive
[1:29:40] and we
[1:29:41] are part of him
[1:29:43] so we need to ask the lord to give us
[1:29:45] that sensitivity
[1:29:47] of the spirit
[1:29:48] around how his body is
[1:29:50] supposed to function but we want to
[1:29:52] pause here
[1:29:54] we're going to pause here and then one
[1:29:55] time when we get another opportunity we
[1:29:58] thank brother ben for giving us this
[1:30:00] chance to just to have his wednesday
[1:30:02] talk and chat i i pray that this have
[1:30:06] just sort of
[1:30:08] pricked you know or touched some you
[1:30:10] know they say under the food there's
[1:30:11] some there's some points
[1:30:14] they say there's some points you know
[1:30:16] when you touch a certain point of your
[1:30:17] food
[1:30:18] you know there's some points i pray that
[1:30:20] some of these have touched some of the
[1:30:22] points that will go and reflect and come
[1:30:25] back and hear the hand part later on are
[1:30:29] we together do you love the lord
[1:30:31] so it was more very much relaxed of a
[1:30:34] teaching
[1:30:35] if you may like to call it but we will
[1:30:37] come next time and then we will proceed
[1:30:39] from here
[1:30:40] when we come next time we are going to
[1:30:43] be speaking about the importance of what
[1:30:45] you
[1:30:46] eat i'm going to ask you what did we say
[1:30:49] we were going to where were we when we

[1:30:54] my my honest and faithful students
[1:30:57] and you'll remember hey jono where what
[1:31:00] is the importance
[1:31:02] of what we eat daily that's going to be
[1:31:04] our starting point when we come next
[1:31:06] time whereas after two months is all
[1:31:08] right but but we'll recall it
[1:31:11] hey you know fenu will remember
[1:31:14] what is the importance of what we
[1:31:17] eat

[1:31:46] if you don't say amen to the word of god
