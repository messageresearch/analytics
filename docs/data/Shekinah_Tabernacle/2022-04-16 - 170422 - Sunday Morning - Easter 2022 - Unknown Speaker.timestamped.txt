[10:42] we just thank you for all that you do
[10:44] for us thank you for the way you've been
[10:47] working through this these meetings this
[10:49] weekend lord
[10:50] thank you for the way you've brought
[10:52] everyone safely lord
[10:54] some have traveled far and
[10:57] yeah past dangers along the road lord
[11:00] and you protected them to get here
[11:02] so that you could touch them
[11:04] encourage them strengthen them whatever
[11:06] they needed lord
[11:08] we just thank you for bringing us to
[11:10] this point this morning
[11:12] preparing us over the last few days
[11:16] so that we're ready to receive you this
[11:17] morning
[11:19] we just invite you lord to come
[11:23] have your will this morning do as you
[11:25] please
[11:27] we just thank you in jesus name
[11:29] amen
[11:35] so i'd just like to thank brother kubin
[11:37] for the message last night
[11:40] i was really encouraged by it
[11:43] and as
[11:44] [Applause]
[11:46] [Music]
[11:51] and i was especially just pleased to see
[11:53] that i'm not the only one that cries
[11:54] behind the pulpit
[11:57] the one thing that really stood out to
[11:58] me
[11:59] was when he was talking about
[12:01] [Music]
[12:03] them gathered in the upper room
[12:06] and when pentecost and the fire fell
[12:08] down
[12:09] for some reason
[12:11] i've always known
[12:13] the scripture but i've always thought of
[12:15] it as a little group
[12:17] probably because i thought of the 12
[12:19] disciples
[12:20] but i've always known it was 120 people
[12:28] that just struck me
[12:30] because when we were preparing for the
[12:31] meetings
[12:34] last week
[12:35] brother moses told us
[12:37] there was going to be 120
[12:41] and it's morning time
[12:43] it's the same time that they were
[12:44] gathered
[12:47] so
[12:48] we'll invite him to come
[12:50] and touch us this morning as he touched
[12:53] them back then
[12:56] [Applause]
[13:05] so how about we start with this one oh
[13:07] lord send the power just now
[13:10] [Music]

[15:36] what a day that will be when my jesus i
[15:39] shall see
[15:48] the day
[15:50] [Music]

[1:13:42] can we just turn to the word of god we
[1:13:44] want to just turn to first corinthians
[1:13:46] chapter 2
[1:13:47] it's good to be here this morning it's
[1:13:49] an
[1:13:50] honor
[1:13:51] amen i don't know brother
[1:13:54] moses why you want to
[1:13:56] use an old fold at me
[1:13:59] you've got all the young men here rather
[1:14:02] i i don't feel at home i feel a bit out
[1:14:04] of place here
[1:14:06] all these young men
[1:14:11] i was i was sitting out there and i was
[1:14:13] watching this pulpit and i was wondering
[1:14:15] and i saw these young men jumping up and
[1:14:17] jumping down
[1:14:19] and i was wondering how am i going to
[1:14:21] make that
[1:14:24] next time you put a little block here
[1:14:26] brother
[1:14:31] i'm not 86
[1:14:37] i'm 87.
[1:14:41] uh
[1:14:43] kidding
[1:14:45] kidding only kidding
[1:14:46] i'm i'm still very young amen
[1:14:50] amen
[1:14:51] it's just life has been treating me
[1:14:53] badly that's why i look like this
[1:14:58] so i just want to read a scripture as
[1:15:00] found in the book of first corinthians
[1:15:02] chapter six now i don't know i don't
[1:15:04] know really what god wants me this
[1:15:06] morning
[1:15:07] but i just felt that i was going to
[1:15:10] speak on a thought
[1:15:12] but i felt that we can't
[1:15:15] have a resurrection morning service
[1:15:18] without speaking
[1:15:20] of what
[1:15:21] has transpired 2000 years ago
[1:15:25] this particular day
[1:15:27] so i just want to read the scripture
[1:15:30] in verse six i think it is yeah
[1:15:34] ii corinthians first corinthians chapter
[1:15:36] two verse 6
[1:15:43] how be it
[1:15:44] we speak wisdom amongst them that are
[1:15:46] perfect
[1:15:48] yet not the wisdom of this world
[1:15:51] know of the princes of this world
[1:15:54] that come to naught
[1:15:56] but we speak the wisdom of god in the
[1:15:58] mystery
[1:16:00] even the hidden wisdom of god which
[1:16:04] which god ordained before the world unto
[1:16:07] our glory
[1:16:09] which none of the princes of this world
[1:16:11] knew
[1:16:13] for had they had known it
[1:16:15] they would not have crucified
[1:16:18] the lord of glory
[1:16:20] and the devil only knew
[1:16:23] if only the devil knew what he unleashed
[1:16:28] when he crucified christ
[1:16:30] he never would have done it amen
[1:16:33] never
[1:16:34] like brother ron spencer normally would
[1:16:37] say blue devil
[1:16:39] will god bless you you may be seated in
[1:16:41] the presence of god
[1:16:44] we have indeed been blessed by the
[1:16:47] ministry of the word the
[1:16:50] young men amen that
[1:16:52] came before and uh
[1:16:54] just encouraged us and spoke to our
[1:16:56] hearts and
[1:16:58] taz was speaking on friday about
[1:17:01] the holy spirit versus enticing spirits
[1:17:04] and uh he mentioned how brother branham
[1:17:07] spoke about it was a test of strength
[1:17:10] amen
[1:17:11] uh it was like a tug of war brother
[1:17:13] branham says it was uh
[1:17:15] one party on this side and one party on
[1:17:17] that side and and you remembered how we
[1:17:20] spoke about the how the indians you to
[1:17:22] make a fire
[1:17:23] in the middle
[1:17:24] and put the rope across it and then you
[1:17:27] pull from the side and
[1:17:29] amen and
[1:17:30] i was just so encouraged it was a
[1:17:32] contest between
[1:17:34] the believer and satan and that contest
[1:17:37] is still
[1:17:38] today taking place
[1:17:41] every day right now while you are
[1:17:43] sitting in church this morning
[1:17:46] you have a battle in your mind
[1:17:48] that enemy is fighting you telling you
[1:17:50] to block out what god wants to tell you
[1:17:54] and then it's again god telling you open
[1:17:56] your mind allow me to minister to you
[1:17:59] uh so it's a contest amen
[1:18:02] and and and and daz was speaking of this
[1:18:04] great strength
[1:18:06] of god in the church
[1:18:09] i tell you this morning let us not make

[1:24:19] there should be no funny feelings
[1:24:21] there should be no oughts

[1:28:29] that this what started this weekend the
[1:28:32] brother moses
[1:28:33] it will continue
[1:28:36] we will keep
[1:28:37] the channel of communication open
[1:28:40] that we can have these type of
[1:28:43] fellowships and have these times
[1:28:45] together because it's not the people
[1:28:49] that is keeping the people apart
[1:28:52] if it's not the people
[1:28:54] then who is it
[1:28:58] if it's not
[1:28:59] no no
[1:29:01] don't tell me it's the devil

[1:29:29] but brother
[1:29:30] [Applause]
[1:29:33] it's the pastors
[1:29:36] thank god i'm not one of them
[1:29:40] i want fellowship brother
[1:29:43] hello i want to that's why many times

[1:29:48] just saying hello to you say hello to a
[1:29:50] pastor god bless you this morning as you
[1:29:52] minister we try to keep
[1:29:56] the brother the channel
[1:29:58] of communication open
[1:30:00] and god will bless you because brother
[1:30:02] the bible says islam i think 133 he says
[1:30:05] there god had commanded the blessing
[1:30:09] when brethren to dwell together in unity
[1:30:13] hallelujah and god only god can bring
[1:30:17] that unity when we come under one
[1:30:21] headshot under one
[1:30:23] brother with the hedge of the word
[1:30:25] christ it only then
[1:30:28] not human togetherness
[1:30:30] because it's going to fall apart by and
[1:30:32] by
[1:30:33] but when i become the word and you
[1:30:36] become the word and we're all under one
[1:30:38] hatred it is then when we have divine
[1:30:42] fellowship one with the other
[1:30:45] so brother branham says in demonology so

[1:44:56] train up the child in the way it ought
[1:44:59] to go and when that child grows older it
[1:45:02] will not depart they might go for a walk
[1:45:05] they might go for a little bit of a
[1:45:07] detour but brother the holy ghost will
[1:45:10] go after them you remember you remember
[1:45:13] brother branham

[1:45:35] and he says and that boy
[1:45:37] was a backslider
[1:45:39] and the holy ghost

[2:09:46] and brother
[2:09:48] and sister
[2:09:49] i couldn't pray

[2:10:34] and of course then me and dorian
[2:10:37] were quoting
[2:10:39] we were in courtroom you know

[2:11:21] maybe it will help some of the young men
[2:11:24] some of the young men here and some of

[2:11:31] immediately
[2:11:33] i knew
[2:11:35] i cannot continue this relationship
[2:11:40] because i'm light
[2:11:43] she's darkness
[2:11:45] she's a sinner
[2:11:47] and me i'm a saint
[2:11:49] and i went down to her home
[2:11:53] to tell her
[2:11:54] from today now
[2:11:56] church i just knew light and darkness
[2:11:59] can't can't
[2:12:01] god walk together
[2:12:04] and i went to a home
[2:12:07] and uh
[2:12:08] trying to catch an eye
[2:12:10] so many people in the home they're
[2:12:12] trying to catch up i want to chat to you
[2:12:14] i'm gonna talk to you so finally when we
[2:12:16] got together
[2:12:18] i said to a listen i've got to tell you
[2:12:19] something
[2:12:20] she says now before you start let me
[2:12:22] tell you something
[2:12:25] i says okay okay what you want to tell
[2:12:27] me she says today
[2:12:29] at work
[2:12:30] i gave my life to the lord
[2:12:33] and you know what she told me
[2:12:35] and she told me brother moses
[2:12:37] and i have decided that i and you we
[2:12:41] cannot go together anymore
[2:12:45] i says
[2:12:46] what and i just came to tell you the
[2:12:49] same thing
[2:12:52] i just came to tell you the same thing
[2:12:54] [Applause]
[2:13:01] and
[2:13:04] now if you want to talk about the match
[2:13:06] made in heaven
[2:13:11] then this is a match made in heaven
[2:13:17] because brother we were serious
[2:13:21] we were serious
[2:13:23] we were gonna each one choose a
[2:13:25] different path
[2:13:28] but god
[2:13:30] but god
[2:13:32] reaching mercy
[2:13:34] knew my life
[2:13:36] knows your life so i'm saying to the
[2:13:38] young men young women don't have an
[2:13:41] unbelieving young man or a youngster or
[2:13:45] a young woman
[2:13:46] don't
[2:13:47] if you do have
[2:13:48] go and tell them no more
[2:13:52] and god will honor you
[2:13:54] god will honor you
[2:13:56] god knew our hearts god knew our lives
[2:13:58] god knew that me and dorian were
[2:14:01] we were ordained to be together
[2:14:04] and and that is what happened in our
[2:14:05] life now i don't know if it's going to
[2:14:06] happen in your life but it happened in
[2:14:08] our lives and that's why we got a
[2:14:10] testimony concerning that
[2:14:12] and so brother when when they when i
[2:14:15] came to the message and i came to the
[2:14:16] lord and i said to the brothers no man
[2:14:18] i'm sorry
[2:14:20] i'm sorry man i've i've got this joy in
[2:14:23] me
[2:14:23] i served hell out there with my music
[2:14:27] and i want to bring my music into the
[2:14:29] church
[2:14:30] and they said then okay bring your music
[2:14:32] no amplifier
[2:14:35] so i had to go to get a guitar no
[2:14:38] amplifier but after a while the lord
[2:14:40] started
[2:14:41] changing and
[2:14:43] no drums they didn't no drums in the
[2:14:45] church brother that's voodoo
[2:14:46] but now we got drums in the church
[2:14:50] why
[2:14:54] and then they use the scripture psalm
[2:14:55] 150.
[2:15:06] allah
[2:15:21] him with the guitars
[2:15:22] psalm 150 some 150.
[2:15:25] with the drums
[2:15:26] with the instruments with the symbols
[2:15:30] that's what i just
[2:15:31] sang in afrikaans
[2:15:36] i think i think brother onyas you must
[2:15:38] come and teach them some afrikaans
[2:15:47] amen and so just carry on quickly time
[2:15:50] is going
[2:15:51] and my when jesus says
[2:15:54] amen
[2:15:55] but i've got the right satan said
[2:15:57] because adam sinned but my blood
[2:16:00] is still wet on that cross
[2:16:01] they paid that
[2:16:03] he said yes i come down to take over
[2:16:06] give me the keys of death and hell
[2:16:10] he he he done gave the keys of the
[2:16:13] kingdom to peter the church
[2:16:15] but he says now give me the keys of
[2:16:18] death and help brother that death and
[2:16:21] hell scared the living daylights out of
[2:16:24] me
[2:16:25] i am as drunk as a lord
[2:16:28] coming into my home
[2:16:31] before i go to sleep i pray
[2:16:34] in my drunken state
[2:16:36] now i lay me down to sleep
[2:16:39] i pray the lord
[2:16:41] my soul to keep
[2:16:43] if i should die
[2:16:45] before i awake that
[2:16:47] death
[2:16:48] and hell
[2:16:50] scared
[2:16:51] me
[2:16:53] and i think it scared all of us
[2:16:56] until we realized
[2:16:58] how he conquered
[2:17:00] death health and the grave
[2:17:04] took the fear
[2:17:06] of death out
[2:17:07] now you can only have be fearless
[2:17:12] if you know your relationship with god
[2:17:15] if you have identified
[2:17:17] what he has done and you've accepted it
[2:17:20] and applied it by faith
[2:17:23] then

[3:01:07] meetings
[3:01:09] or just read from the book of isaiah
[3:01:12] praise the lord
[3:01:15] take my scripture from the book of
[3:01:16] isaiah
[3:01:18] isaiah chapter 66
[3:01:20] verse 8
[3:01:24] it's a very beautiful scripture
[3:01:27] it says
[3:01:28] who has heard such a thing
[3:01:31] we have seen such things
[3:01:35] shall the earth be
[3:01:36] made to bring forth in one day
[3:01:40] or shall a nation be born at once
[3:01:45] for as soon as zion travailed
[3:01:48] she brought forth
[3:01:50] the children
[3:01:51] amen praise the lord
[3:01:53] the meetings are we can't i can't really
[3:01:56] say
[3:01:57] put a finger to really say
[3:01:59] everything
[3:02:01] anybody sort of like
[3:02:02] really made them happen
[3:02:04] but they can only give it to god
[3:02:07] which has really helped us amen
[3:02:09] it was good through and through it all
[3:02:11] started
[3:02:12] brother tears wanted to
[3:02:15] he was here
[3:02:16] with a wonderful meeting and then he
[3:02:18] says it's gonna come back
[3:02:20] we have a meeting and uh well he says
[3:02:23] well that's fine brother tears come
[3:02:25] we just have a
[3:02:26] simple just like we did before
[3:02:30] just us and you and that's it
[3:02:32] praise the lord and brother teresa
[3:02:35] he was over in oakland and then he says
[3:02:40] he excused himself that will be over
[3:02:42] here for easter
[3:02:44] and my dear brother fred says
[3:02:46] we're gonna be there
[3:02:48] and help brother moses amen
[3:02:50] and uh
[3:02:51] that's how the boss started rolling amen
[3:02:54] i was kind of a bit hesitant
[3:02:56] because it was still during covet and
[3:02:59] with those are restrictions in place
[3:03:02] so the numbers and everything
[3:03:04] or it makes you to scratch your head but
[3:03:07] the lord has just been opening the
[3:03:10] soul that's the way does it
[3:03:12] it's very strange at times it lets you
[3:03:15] until you're almost like
[3:03:17] hanging down the cliff you're almost
[3:03:19] dropping and then it comes and
[3:03:21] soaps you all so that's how it has been
[3:03:23] happening and the numbers just on
[3:03:26] wednesday they said
[3:03:28] you are free to gather as many as you
[3:03:29] want
[3:03:30] so we say that well
[3:03:32] let it be let them come and here we are
[3:03:35] and like i've said that some ministers
[3:03:38] we just didn't send word because
[3:03:40] the war is more
[3:03:42] and uh and also uh
[3:03:45] uh so we could not sort of like
[3:03:47] accommodate them and
[3:03:48] for the people i think
[3:03:50] we started saying we have got some
[3:03:52] meetings i think it's less than three
[3:03:54] weeks
[3:03:55] and i hear some people they say
[3:03:57] together people like this at times it
[3:03:59] takes months and months
[3:04:01] in preparation ahead so it's just a
[3:04:04] miracle
[3:04:05] that we are this man this are today and
[3:04:08] we just want to thank the lord for that
[3:04:10] and may the lord bless you
[3:04:12] this is no man's doing
[3:04:14] that was jehovah god himself
[3:04:16] praise the lord
[3:04:18] hallelujah
[3:04:19] [Applause]
