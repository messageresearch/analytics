Potter and put us right centered Lord so that we can spin and be molded and become what you were meant to be amen that we could fulfill the Divine Purpose for our lives in Jesus name amen hallelujah well praise the Lord God bless you thank you brother David and musicians Hallelujah well praise God and definitely um I'm I'm I'm I'm feeling the presence of the Lord isn't that good is that good I'm sure that everyone's happy about that that you can meet in a building with different people and God comes that's the big difference God comes amen who's happy that God comes to the meeting Hallelujah I'm so happy that God comes to the meeting amen and I'm sure and trust that you've already invited him to your Pew Hallelujah if you haven't just invite him now amen and if we could turn in our scriptures now to John chapter 4 amen versus one through the seven and then Hebrews 13 8. oh my I'm driving with this thing am I man technology has increased the tree of knowledge is growing oh my okay uh how do I do I just swipe to the side or the left or on I can see I can see all right man this is easy I could see Ben doing that the other day amen I want to speak tonight on a subject cold He'll Do It Again I just feel like preaching right now or just finishing and saying God you take over amen when therefore the Lord knew how the Pharisees had heard that Jesus made and baptized more disciples than John though Jesus himself baptized not but as disciples he left Judea and departed again into Galilee and I love this and he must needs go through Samaria he had something on his mind there was a Divine compassion leading Hallelujah then cometh he to a city of Samaria of all places which is called saika near to the parcel of ground that Jacob gave to his son Joseph and now Jacob's Well was there Jesus therefore being married with his journey set thus on the well and it was about the sixth hour and there cometh a woman of Samaria to draw water Oh my Jesus said unto her give me to drink yeah amen may the Lord add his Blessing to the reading of his word you may be seated oh Jesus help me Hebrews 13 8 says Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever and I just want to place emphasis on the same he's the same who believes he's the same so if he's the same tonight does that mean that he will do the same things if the same faith has is brought up to him amen amen so if Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever then he will do the same things that he did back then oh yeah he'll do today the same things he did in the 50s he will do today the same things he did in the 60s he will do today the same things he did in the 90s in the 2000s and when this church was founded he will do today so wherever that last Milestone is in your life where God did something for you he will do it again today Hallelujah he's still the same he hasn't changed Hallelujah hey man I just want to get that straight here we'll do it again amen hallelujah you see now I I have no doubt in my mind that when Jesus began to uh talk to this woman at the well you know and he had gone to a woman who was of the least reputation a woman who had no reputation really among men and she wasn't even allowed to go to the well with all the women of the virgins and the woman of virtue so she was there in the heat of the day and she wasn't allowed to go where anyone else she was ostracized from society and she was a Samaria a place that was considered just ghastly in the sight of the Jews right so here is a place that was disdained it was had no reputation and the woman was the lowest person in that place we could say right and Jesus the Messiah chose her to be the first Gentile to reveal himself too amen why did he do this why would Jesus choose this woman I believe that Jesus doesn't make mistakes he's if the son of man does only that which he sees the father doing by Vision he was led to the woman of Samaria because he wanted to make a statement he wanted to make a statement that he's willing to go to the lowest people and do the greatest things amen because he wants to speak a message over the people so that you can have confidence today in 2023 that he'll do it again Hallelujah but I have no doubt in my mind that as that woman got a revelation of the Messiah after that long conversation that she had and her eyes came open and she was elated and her life was changed forever because she came in contact with the Messiah hallelujah amen and she went tearing up Samaria she went back to psycha she was excited she was so excited that she forgot about her water park she forgot about her past she forgot about everything that was going on behind her she forgot Hallelujah because there was such an impact Hallelujah she went tearing up those streets everybody knew everybody knew that the Messiah was here because he told her the things that was in her heart glory to God glory to his name Hallelujah he will do it again right so this is the thing now he was sending a message out because he knew that there was a lot of people in Israel in Samaria in the Gentile World in 2023 that needed to know that he no matter how far they've gone how far away how many troubles they do how many failures they have no matter what they go through no matter what their children go through all the Mind battles everything like that he wants to say that you're not past my judgment you're not past my line of Mercy I will come to you and I will do it again he's willing to do it again he needed to send a message because there was people there that was living in condemnation there was people in his time that were living in hopelessness and in that state of hopelessness it was easy for them to sin I'm feeling really nervous I feel like adrenaline oh man Hallelujah you Paul this is a two-way thing right there's two things I'm really relying on right now and one of them is the inspiration of the Holy Ghost and two is the faith of the people to pull amen and I'm having faith too because you know this the lord gave me this message and about two or three weeks ago and it just all downloaded like straight off and then and now I think man and I come to I think man I need this I need this is like for me you know like I don't know anyone that's preached right you're preaching you think man help me Lord Jesus help me I want to sit there and watch it because I need this yeah you know there's things that you this is why Jesus does these things so that we can have confidence that he'll do it again if he did it there he'll do it for you oh yeah and he will do it willingly and he wants to and he's just waiting just waiting on something he's just waiting on someone to pass off that crust of unbelief you know the disciples said walk with him that scene the dead raise the supernatural after Supernatural and he sent them and anointed them to cast out Devils cleansed lepers raise the dead heal the sick and preach the gospel to the poor right yeah yeah he sent them out and yet there was still a demon that they couldn't cast off oh and he says because you don't you're unbelief so these disciples who had seen it all and were anointed to do it there were still some things that were strongholding against them and he just went like this be gone or whatever he said and that thing was gone and he said the only way this one can come out is but by prayer and fasting that doesn't mean oh no there's a serious case that's fast and pray until it happens he lived in a state of Prayer he was anointed he was living in a state of able to deliver yeah and you can too Hallelujah none of us to have to live below privilege all that you see and all that you see him do he'll do it again and he's willing he's willing Hallelujah Hallelujah sometimes we just don't cross the cross the line between mercy and judgment or between we don't cross the line into a realm of of divine faith and sometimes we're just living a realm of the humanistic understanding in our thoughts they just stay on the Earth but we're called to live higher yeah amen do you believe it amen oh that's cold has that been in the freezer it's got some solidity in there that's probably how cold it was before the heaters went on in the church oh that's actually solid ice oh someone new eh someone was very thoughtful that I needed turbo into Cooling amen this woman she just have I read that I added sorry I'm just getting used to this new driving this car then Peter opened his mouth and said of a truth I perceive that God is no respecter of person that's right but in every nation he that feareth him or she that feareth him and worketh righteousness is accepted with him amen thank you now you cannot your righteousness is of filthy rags right so it's not you performing anything to achieve or to earn anything from him your righteousness is only in him amen and so what he's calling for is for you to approach him personally yeah that's true he's calling for you to make an approach to make a move yes and he cannot bypass your free moral agency but he will woo you he will pour His presence out in in your midst he will show you an example of someone else getting delivered because he knows that you need that because that will spark hope in your life so that you can have an expectation so that when you do read the scripture you can think in your mind maybe I can have that too yeah maybe and all of a sudden there's an atmosphere change in your mind and atmosphere changes in your in the way that you conduct yourself and your thought processes because now there's a glimmer of hope to know that God has no respecter of person's meaning that God is not respecting how great you are how little you are or whatever he's not he doesn't look at those things he's looking at you your reverence yeah see that fear is not to be afraid I'm scared that's just some humanistic idea no it's to have a reverential trust referencing the Lord to approach him reverently to approach him in a righteous way righteousness is following the patterns of scripture righteousness is approaching him in the right way and God and his great tender loving Mercy would create a way for us to approach him and not just create a way for us to approach him but preserve the way of approach to preserve a way and when man got so twisted up in all denominationalism and Catholicism and darkness and all these Eastern religions and everything like that and it blocked the way to God and everyone didn't know what to do God had to send a man Anointed with the spirit of us yeah oh yes so that he could re-establish the altar so that we could approach God in Simplicity I was talking to Josh the other day in the car and he was telling some of his friends the Simplicity of it of the message what it means and talking about this this approach and talking about you know what is it and do you need that for salvation do you need this is it something that's absolutely necessary the approach that is revealed in the message is all in the scripture right yeah it's all there yeah it's just tuning and calibrating our vision of the scripture so that we can approach God the way the apostles do to preach the message of Paul to live the message of Paul to approach God the way Paul approached him it's very simple and when you do that you will find them because you're approaching him in the same Faith you're taking God's provided way amen hallelujah Hallelujah that was free thank you Hallelujah Matthew 15 26 is that gone okay but he answered and said it is not meant to take the children's bed and cast it to dogs and she said truth Lord yet the dogs eat of the crumbs would fall from their masters table in Jesus answered and said unto a woman great is thy faith be it unto thee even as thou wilt and her daughter was made whole from that very hour so here now we have another Testament of the willingness of Jesus Christ to even go beyond who he was called to go to because his ministry wasn't to go to the Gentiles at that stage he was going to go to the Gentiles through the church he was going to unlock the kingdom of the of the gospel and the Holy Ghost through Peter right he go Peter got given the keys to the kingdom but yet Jesus would even if someone approached him with his reverence and righteousness and actually humble themselves under his mighty hand and really approach him in faith he will still deliver there is no way out of being delivered if you provide the righteous way that he is ordained for you to come amen At first she said Son of David Son of David he didn't even respond it wasn't the righteous approach it wasn't according to scripture she didn't know I'm a son of David she wasn't part of the Kingdom of Israel she was a gentile but when she approached them as Lord when she realized that she can trust somebody and she can open her heart to the living King who will never hurt her who will actually want to help her and she could approach him and then she could find that she would receive the mercy that she needed Hallelujah Jesus was saying speaking now words behind the words between the lines I am willing to help even the unhelpful unhelpless the helpless the Hopeless I am willing to take someone that is not even allotted to them and give them salvation and give them seal and Salvage them from the wreckage oh Jesus help me Hallelujah you see now what he was doing and I love this because God was sending a message out to the people of his of psycha sending a message out to Samaria sending a message back into Israel I'm willing if you approach me you're gonna get saved if you approach me you're going to get healed if you approach me you're going to have a life change if you come this provided way you're going to get what they got because I will do it again I am faithful to do it again I am faithful to keep the word he says this is faithful to his own word and so these ripples were going out through Israel and there was another woman and for the sake of this story I'm just going to call her Mary even though it doesn't name her but Mary's a good name and there's no one with a first name Mary in here I don't think so that's good so it doesn't look like I'm trying to you know pen out somebody but so Mary now now she Mary has lived a sinful life the Bible calls her a great sinner and and and and and she's lived sinful and she's caught up in the wrong things caught up in prostitution caught up in a sinful life that she cannot get out of and she's hopeless and she's just going about her life probably wondering whether she should kill herself or not because she can't get out of this and she's got pressure she has to perform she's got a client base she's got to do all these things and she cannot get out of it and then she sees there's no way out and in her mind she's just too far gone even God has forsaken her this is the this is what's going on in her life and she's this is going through and day in Day Out The Daily Grind no hope gone to the altar many times in the synagogue and the priests just don't even want to talk to her they're just she's just a lost cause maybe in the early days when she first started going off the rails they tried to help her and they tried to help her and she went to the altar she went to this church and that church and she went to this group and that religion and that whatever she went to and she just it was just getting worse and she was just going downhill and it was just becoming more and more hopeless and then hopelessness built on hopelessness until it was just dark and all she could do was what she was um locked in to do all the rest of her life what's the point in living would have been going through her mind many times and we're gonna call her Mary but then one day news spread around in her circles maybe that is a holy man in town yeah there's a holy man and he went to Samaria and she's like what maybe her friend came up to and said you know Mary I know that you're going you're not a religious woman I know that you're not really interested in these things even though deep down she really wanted something real you know she really wanted a real Deliverance she really wanted to be free she really wanted to live in the Commonwealth of God she really wanted to be a friend of God but she thought and the devil had always made it very clear to her that she had passed salvation she had passed the point of no return you know can you imagine thinking like that can you imagine being in that place where you think you've passed Mercy where you think you're in judgment and there's no way out and you've just gone too far and there's people that are like that today there's people that sit in message churches that think these things about themselves they believe the lie of the devil right Lord help me stop walking around the pulpit I don't know why I walk around the pulpit [Laughter] Hallelujah and so so now your friend comes to her and says Mary I know you're not like that you know but hey guess what I'm just so excited because this woman was also in a hopeless cycle but something was changing in her friend and so now she's telling Mary Mary there's a holy man that doesn't just sit in the synagogues and go to the king's palaces he's actually he went to Samaria yeah what Samaria yes he actually went to Samaria and guess what he went to the that low prostitute that you had heard of and he went and he actually revealed himself to her and Mary something started to happen in Mary when she began to hear news of a deliverer when she began to hear news of a god of Mercy when she began to hear news that a God that could deliver and a god of Mercy was willing to to go to the lowest of the low yeah that's one thing for the god of Mercy to go to the high priest and give the high priest a prophecy or or to go to a congregation full of devout players people that are in the synagogue but what about this holy man who has a renowned to do miracles to raise the dead to heal lepers and all of a sudden she's hearing not just that but he's going to these lowly people in the highways and byways and all of a sudden hope begins to Dawn and Mary and something changed in her life from that moment on a Divine influence started coming on her heart and and we call that Grace does anyone know Grace where one day a Divine influence begin to come on your heart and it started to move in your life even though you hadn't seen a God and a flesh or whatever but yet there was something working there was something beginning to stir and marry and so something happened in her from hopelessness to Hope yeah hope is a very powerful thing by the way don't diminish it it's actually one of the three things that is mentioned as the three main things to have hope faith and love right hope faith and love I mean if it's elevated to that Trinity you could say of the highest things then don't diminish it because the hope is an atmosphere of expectation anticipation pleasurable you have a and you you're expecting something and so all of a sudden now Mary had you know she she was still doing her thing she was still got a schedule right she's still got to go fulfill her job and she's got to go to do her things that she doesn't and and carry on the way that she's always done but something changed now now it's become a little bit harder to do it because now Mary's got hope now something changed he's like whoa actually maybe I'm a candidate can you imagine now going from no candidate no eligibility not able to get connected to this God no deliverance and all of a sudden the possibility that you could be delivered right that you could be healed that you could be eligible to be a friend of God that you that that this Messiah that God everyone was waiting for would actually be interested in you oh my Lord interested in Cara interested in Malachi interested in Maggie Hannah amen interested in Megan amen interested in Debbie interested very interested and we're eligible right yeah now all of a sudden the fact that you're eligible now she's hope begins to rise on her heart now there's an expectation starts to brew and she's now going and doing her job but it's a lot harder to do now sun is a lot harder to achieve it starts to become hard we're we're in that state of hopelessness it was easy yeah has anyone ever kind of gone and just you know you've lived well and then you just go make a mistake and you're like you get so down that you just make more mistakes you think well stuff everything I'm here now I'm just going and you you feel like you're done and you're in that moment of hopelessness what is that the devil wants to disconnect you from the Commonwealth of God and what happens is you just cross into that place and it's so bad and there's people that live in that place can you imagine living in that place of hopelessness living in that place where sin is easy living in that place where it's easy to unbelieve easy to say the wrong things easy to commit sin easy to commit adultery easy to look at that pornography it's hopeless but yet there is hope amen because if you're a Seed of Abraham right Abraham against hope believed in Hope amen so it was an anomaly it was like what do you call that paradox whatever you're saying he just said no yeah yeah I've got a promise yeah yeah and all of a sudden now here's Mary and something's starting to change you know there's like a graph now in their life and the ease of sin is starting to go down and now there's something else starting to rise in their life and she's got this Faith that's starting to brew in her heart and it's brewing and it's brewing and it's growing and it's growing and it's just becoming painful horrible all of a sudden there's these thoughts that are coming in her mind that's different from ever before all of a sudden there's a motive inside her to be pure yeah to be pure you know there's something purging inside oh my God has anyone ever been in that place all of a sudden something's changing in your life and all of a sudden you have a desire to be pure and you start to hate sin oh Jesus keep us there we are in a battle now I can tell you now as she was thinking that and I'm sure the moment she said anything that slimy Devil he's a real person don't ever diminish the devil to some ethereal mist or whatever he is a being and he's very smart yeah too smart for his own good and he began to Slither his way into her mind and start to say no not you Mary you're not worthy he doesn't even care about you you've gone too far and she would have gone up and then she would have gone down and she would have gone up and she would have gone down she would have had good days and bad days I don't know how long it was from the moment she heard Hallelujah you know there was another woman that heard one day her name was Rahab Rahab heard one day you know she had never seen anything but word got out that there was a God who was real a God who could deliver a God who was changing lives a God who was delivering people and fulfilling promises and getting rid of sin God just going on a rampage removing sin out of his land yeah oh God he's going on a rampage tonight to remove sin out of your life amen and he's angry at the Devil not at you hate the sin not the sinner and he's on a rampage to go and deliver and Rahab was like oh something happened in her there was representation and Rahab something in Rahab the word got to her ear and it shaked her rare eardrum and then it went down into her mind and then her mind started all the Cog started turning and then she just let that linger a little long and then it went down yeah oh my when it goes down Hallelujah just let the word linger a little while in your life men meditate on my word says the Lord Hallelujah meditate on scripture meditate on the Promises see what happens it'll begin to create a hope an expectation and life and then the impossible can take place then the Miracles can take place then the supernatural can take place because your mind becomes a meeting place [Music] because you're thinking on the right things you ain't sitting there watching YouTube going on Snapchat looking at naked things all those sort of dirty stuff and watching all that stuff you know you're actually meditating on something that can change your life you're meditating on something you'll stop you sleeping in church Hallelujah amen you're coming to the anointing and you'll be able to engage in the message you'll be able to engage in what's being preached amen you're able to draw for yourself the manner that you need because you've been meditating on the word there's an atmosphere in your mind and it's gone into your heart because it starts here it doesn't stay there it's got to go down there but what are you meditating on are you mad at the word the thought where does it come from just just think about that oh yeah where is that thought coming from that you've meditated on trace it back I'm from that's on that screen that you're watching every day where has the thought come from is it going to bring Faith or is it just going to fill your mind with information because it can do two things it can go the other way too right it can take you further away from God there's just so much stuff that we fill our minds with it just fills out mind with Mindless and very much useless information but it's like it's tantalizing you know it kind of helps us relax and all those things but it comes with a cost anyway Mary is just now move there's something moving in our life there's there's a hope that's beginning to come up in her life and she's and and and and sin becomes hard and she's now thinking about maybe he'll come to me and maybe just maybe she prayed for an opportunity has anyone prayed for an opportunity with God just thank God did it for a prostitute why don't you do it for me I've tried all my life to sit in a church be holy even when I don't want to be sometimes I've gone to church my parents have told me it's good I've heard same enough for sermon after sermon after sermon Jesus I don't understand it and all these things but then if you just she would have gone synagogue after synagogue after Synagogue Church after church convention camp she would have had roller coasters but never total Deliverance yeah but then there was a a dilemma of Hope in her life that this one went to a woman of Samaria another prostitute and then this one went this holy man this Messiah they say this Prophet this one that has Supernatural power that actually has results he's here tonight by the way amen he actually has results he can actually change lives I know because he did it to me if he can do it to me he'll do it again if he can do it for Dave he'll do it again if he could not for Ben he'll die again he can deliver from alcohol from drugs from pornography he can deliver from all those things if he can do it for us he'll do it again if he can deliver on a man from addictions to Cricket smoking and all those things He'll Do It Again Hallelujah Hallelujah those testimonies are to encourage you to know that you can be delivered to life that you can be healed tonight that the setting sin that's held you on the ground and you've never been able to fly broken and you can be changed you can be set free and never ever struggle with that thing again never because he doesn't have the liver he totally delivers what he's looking for is a meeting place in your mind and then in your heart you say invite me have a right attitude of Hope imagined Mary we're just calling her Mary don't get me wrong I don't know what her name is but I like the name she's now praying I believe just maybe simple prayer and he heard that there was a seed inside her predestined yeah but spoke to the deep in him and it resonated Hallelujah like rehab resonated in her ears resonated in her mind resonated in her heart and then it resonated in her life hasn't resonated in your life as your life resonating of the word of God and he let the Prophecies of today are you vibrating are you playing out the music is your life song singing The End Time Is Here the Rapture is close I'm going I'm leaving I hear the sound of a going amen is that what your life is resonating in rehab she heard a sound of a going she heard a sound that maybe she could be delivered you know what God arranged that she would be delivered not just her but her whole house Hallelujah on the day of her Deliverance the D-Day of her sinful life you know there's an end to your sinful nature and do you know that's one final end right but there's also an end to settings there's an end to those things that are holding you back there's an end to and I say in my own life criticisms Hallelujah you know I'm a critical person on myself and mainly but even it does come out especially when I get really really worn out oh man but there's an end to that some things are so deep ly habitual nature not just they're not Devils or anything but they're just things that God needs to change all my habits mindsets family traits things that have locked out the word of God can divide Soul and Spirit don't you think the word of God can put your soul in preeminence over those things so that you can have victory over those things yeah amen real victory life changing real true Victory Hallelujah he's here tonight he did it for them he'll do it for you he did it for Rahab he'll do it now Rahab stood there you know he's the mighty Angel With The Sword in his hand giving the the word to Joshua and the Army and they followed his leading and they did what they did and the walls came crumbling down what did Rahab do what did she do she didn't go get this brick away and kick that one down and come on I'm gonna help you break the walls I'm gonna go kill all these ones that I went with I've got to go do it no this is great she just believed she asked for an opportunity she got a sure token have you got a short token tonight she got a sure token she said I need to know that I know that I know Hallelujah she got a short token and she had faith in the finished work but this Captain who came down to deliver she had believed him and God respected that there and watched her life her old life she watched it disappear every last stinking sinful thing she didn't lift a finger she just stood there believing maybe worshiping Hallelujah and watch the word of that Mighty Captain who'd come into her land into that place and deliver her from her old life until she stood there and I say stand still and see the salvation of the Lord watch what he can do because if he would do it for her he'll do it for you he'll do it for your family they're done for your children mean never give up has been said on Sunday never never give up oh my I've got to go to this picture rehab maybe it was all chaotic I'm sure it was oh yes if a whole city walls is falling around you it's not going to be the most librarious it's going to be pretty carnal Carnage yeah screaming those devils screaming all those Devils that held her and said Foster in those ways screaming delivered and she stands there and she's praying oh God the god of Abraham Isaac and Jacob oh Lord you are truly real now I know now let's come to my house now I can experience in my house and in my life I can see total Deliverance all around me Hallelujah all the dust and the shaking and the groaning and the screaming and all the Deliverance Deliverance is not normally a quiet thing Deliverance can be a very loud noisy time it doesn't have to be but it can be and in rahab's time it was a real noisy time at Deliverance and after it all and maybe the dust had begun to settle looks around Freedom she looks to the right Freedom she looks to the left freedom totally delivered she gets married to the captain Hallelujah and at the wedding when they said is there anybody here that can testify why raheim can't marry the captain of Israel army yup and they're looking around where are you accused is your accusers and she says there aren't any they're all gone they're all gone I got delivered that's how God delivers and if he'll do it for Ray have he'll do it for you Hallelujah he'll do it for me Hallelujah because he loves to do that and so Mary oh my I better look at the time I'm having too much of a good time right you know time just oh there's a clock yes praise God I can now I've just got to remember it's there amen I'm gonna I'm just going to I'm gonna get to the scripture here and I have to get to this I'm gonna work through says here beloved now we're the sons of God and it does not yet appear what we shall be but we know that when he shall appear we shall be like him because we're in the eighth time of the appearing the time of the appearing where God would reveal himself in his word and totally reveal everything that he is and all his intentions and expose the devil and all his intentions all his plans everything right amen and then he would make that flesh and live it out through a people right so the appearing we're in the age okay we've established that when he shall appear we shall be like him for we shall see him as he is so here's this Revelation now just like Mary was getting a revelation you know like she was he had appeared in that generation no physically now it is appearing physically the Lamb of God to take away the sins of the world was appearing the Messiah and now she's hearing about it now hope has started to happen in her heart so now she's beginning to purify herself because there's a motive for it she's preparing for a wedding day she's preparing for something because there's an anticipation in her life it's bringing a joy in her heart that she's never known and until this happens to you there is a joy that's available that you've never known but I believe I'm looking at people that are walking in this Joy I believe I'm looking and preaching to a people that know this joy that know what it's like to be enjoyed to know what it's like to be really truly happy and stay happy Hallelujah stay happy in the storm stay happy on the mountain stay happy in the valley stay happy in the trials I should say joyous right amen happiness can be based on circumstance but I'm just going to call it Joy Joy is a very powerful thing for we shall sin as he is and then there's and every man that has this hope in him hope purifieth himself even as he is pure so there's this motive happening in Mary she's now becoming very hard and very difficult for her she's getting brought to an ultimatum she's getting brought to a place in her life which a decision has to be made you know she's got she's coming to a point where she's got to cross over from sin into righteousness and sometimes that can be a very tumultuous time oh yeah it was for me it took about nine months for me because you know this is just everyone's different but when it happened it really really happened and when it happened it really happened oh my it happened so good it happened so thoroughly it happened so definitely that from that moment from that time there was no more desire for alcohol drugs and no more desire just gone all I wanted was to sit and read my Bible and I was a very social person I was out there partying all the time sudden I had I had completely changed but came and he brought substance I had that hope I was in a season of because I knew I was man it was a joyful time but yet I was running and I was in and out and just going through it and sin was becoming very difficult and and right and there was something in me I started listening to the rights of music I started watching the right things you know and I was still going out there still having a bit of this and that but I but something was changing there was a hope inside me there was a meeting place inside me where God could come he began to change something in me and so there was an opportunity opportunity everyone say opportunity opportunity there was an opportunity for God to work because there was a faith inside me there was a hope inside me faith is the substance of things hoped for Hallelujah so it goes from hoping to substance but you can't make the substance it's God that makes the substance God brings substance to Hope but hope is an atmosphere for God to use because now you're drawing you're pulling you're anticipating You're Expecting yeah you've got an expectation I trust you've got an expectation and you have expectation you see something that you know and you need or it's for you and you and you'll get you've got an expectation you are believing right you're anticipating it's going to be for me and I've seen him do it for them and he'll do it again I've seen him do it for Rahab and he'll do it for me I've seen him do it for the maniac of gaddara who was so dumb to Demons if he could do that for him he'll do it for me or do it for that demon possessed man he'll do it for whoever if you've got a devil in you and you can't get rid of it he'll do it for you because he did it for the maniac gadara he did it for all the demon-possessed he even schizophrenic demons that used to cast People Into the Fire and they couldn't stop it and have seizures and all sorts of crazy things yeah and he would deliver them if he did it for them he'll do it for you if he did it for them he'll do it for your friend he'll do it for those ones that you're caring for because it's still the same Prophet says this in the third step how can two walk together lest they be agreed light and dark cut Fellowship together when light comes in dark goes out so this is what's happening in Mary's Life Light is beginning to come in because now she's got a hope now hopelessness is being destroyed now it's becoming hard for her to sin now she's in a straight betwixture too because what's happening is light's coming in and dark is going out the most powerful is light you can't put light out with duck anyone find me a dark torch and you shine it in the room and it shines Darkness you can't do it light is far more powerful than that and God is light Hallelujah that's why he just shows it in nature right that he is like Jesus says I am the light of the world you can't put me out you just if that was one thing that you can get you can't put Jesus out you can't put him out he's inextinguishable Hallelujah and if you let him shine in your mind he'll begin to expel the darkness he'll expel those things that you're struggling with he'll deliver he'll shine light on it he'll shine light so well that he'll show you where it came from and then the devil's exposed sometimes you don't know why you're struggling with something and you need to know where it came from actually you should know where that's the key to Deliverance as Discerning discernment for the Lord to discern that issue and deliver you and heal you and set you free and the Holy Ghost comes down and in prayer and in the word and you can be sitting in the church and the Lord begins to preach don't Pitchfork that if it's for you and it's exposing something and it hurts take it amen don't just you know pride is such an evil thing it makes you miss out your your your deliverance it makes you miss out on that blessing that God wants to give you Hallelujah you know Mary and Israel and in our lives there's things that sometimes take ages and we think that oh wow it's just taking too long but there's people that wait for thousands of years yeah and when I was in Israel my goodness you know this what you can see here this is the Western Wall and it's the closest that Israelites can pray to the holy of holies where the temple once stood that's why it's so popular that's why they go there those blocks that those guys are leaning up against are slick with tears they're slick with crying tears they rub them they just scream out to God and they cry and if you look closely you probably can't see it from there I didn't think of that but there's actually stuffed into every crack there's thousands of little folded up notes that they've they've sent to God and children go there and as you can see on the left hand side there's that's like you know there's a lot of enthusiasm there's a lot of motivation there there's a lot of perseverance there these people have been waiting for thousands of years for their Messiah because their forefathers rejected them yeah their forefathers rejected Jesus Christ and the result is what you've seen Israel go through they got kicked out of Jerusalem they went scattered through the world they were served with the silver vanity they they took over the world because they were they had The Blessing of Abraham on them naturally speaking and they've now own all the money and they they they're all those big families of money all that stuff right but yet there's still a people that are really spiritual and there's at 144 000 people Jews that are waiting for their Messiah that are really got faith that are really believing and they've been believing for hundreds and hundreds of years and they just keep going back and they just keep going back and I'm calling you the army of Jesus Christ don't give up amen don't give up on your children don't give up on that promise don't give up on your deliverance don't give up on that Pacific and getting deleted out of your life because God is able and he's willing if he did it for them he'll do it again and these people here that are at that wall they believe that he'll do it again they always get the promises in front of them and they recite them and they recite them have you seen them they're like this have you seen them do this oh they are so desperate a couple of turmoil around them yeah they're not living in Comfort like you yeah yeah you are subdued with comfort you're soft sorry but I'm being honest soft new zealanders the devil wants to reduce you to a kiwi with no wings so all you do is Sniff and pick out dirt out of the ground that's what he wants to do but that's why you hear the word dying down that's why you listen to sermons that's why you come to church because you're being raised up from kiwi status two two a praise he wants to bring you in the air he doesn't want you to be on the ground he doesn't want you to be comforted by the world he wants to be your comforter and the comforter is an eagle so your comfort's in the sky that's real Comfort not the comfort in the ground not comfort in the dirt with your that long beak that the devil wants to give you not a curved one either a big long skinny one that puts in the you know people say sometimes to me you're a key I said no all right no kiwi no way I will not identify with that stinking flightless bird what a silly thing to have as a country mascot sorry New Zealand but my goodness amen oh God help me give me that perseverance let me just keep holding on I will not give up amen hallelujah that's so here now I'm finishing on this help me Jesus this is the finishing point his Mary and it's not come to a climax it's not so hard and it's so it's just chewing in here and it's just the desperation and she's been believing and maybe this she's being stirred more today she got up it's been maybe a few months since she heard and it's just been brewing but then something was different this day something inside her was telling her today this is your last day here of doing these things she doesn't know why but something inside is saying this is the last time that you will suffer under this Taskmaster this is the last time that you'll do the prostitution this is the last time that you will suffer under Satan's something's changing and maybe it's because the Messiah was coming up the road and that presence that precedes him just begin to brood and it begins to surround that area I would I believe that when he was walking that there was a presence around him and I believe that for the Alex seed that was there they probably there was probably about a kilometer of presence that they could begin to sense when he is now something began to stir in her and and from her last client Hallelujah there's a last time there's a DNA for sin there's a D-Day for those specific things in your life make it tonight make it now God is a god of Deliverance if he doesn't for her he'll do it for you this woman was riddled with sin she was stuck she couldn't get out of it she was stuck so stuck in the devil always told her uh you can live a bit it's okay God's grace is sufficient God doesn't want you to live with it God doesn't want you to live under your privilege he wants you to live in the Heavenly he wants you to find comfort in the sky soaring with the ego of the Holy Spirit Hallelujah so here's Mary and she's walking from her last client and all of a sudden she hears a commotion down at Simon the Pharisees Hallelujah she hears a commotion she knows Simon the Pharisees she knows all those up and UPS because some of them are her clients so and they're secret clients and I'll tell you what if you'll ever think that those Pharisees were all real holy a lot of them were dark Sinners Jesus even said to them whoa unto you squads Pharisees lawyers all of those people you'd tell them all to do all these people to do all the stuff he put them under bondage but you don't even keep it yeah telling them they're vile Sinners and so here she is and she hears maybe she's walking down Hallelujah Avenue and here's Simon the Pharisees house Berg nice house with Steeples and all that stuff and now she says oh what's going on over assignments and she's like oh okay well there's John and there's buttermaus and there's this one and whatever this Caiaphas oh my they're all going I wonder what's happening oh and she stopped and she can see him and she sees the Messiah and the messiah's coming and she's like wow this is different different about him Hallelujah and so something stirs in her heart and she sees them lining up at Simon the Pharisees house and she's and there and she sees the foot wash flunkies and all the Entourage that they get as the dignitaries they roll out the carpets they invite them from their horse chariots and and they take off these people to take off this robe and this one cleans the takes off the shoes and washes the feet and puts on uh the slippers and anoints them with oil and then they come to the host Simon and he kisses them welcome you've got your garment you're clean you smell nice and she's thinking oh isn't it wonderful they kind of give honor and glory to this man that I've been waiting to see or how can I see him I know that I could probably get in there because I know all those things maybe the that footwash flunkies see me go past them a few times and so she's thinking oh I was going there but she's standing afar off she's just just a couple a block away but she's looking and she's like man they're gonna honor him they're going to give him what he deserves oh I can't wait to see how they're gonna just fall down and worship this holy Messiah and then they come he comes up and he's in the line and he walks up and the foot wash flunky looks at him looks over at Simon and Simon Says and he goes and he looks back at Jesus and he says going yeah and this woman she's like oh yeah hot yeah how could they do this and then all of a sudden an opportunity comes yeah and this is your opportunity this is your opportunity this is my opportunity and so something says I'm going this is my day this is my hour I'm gonna cross the line today I'm going to go past the the Judgment Mercy line today I'm going to go so far into Mercy I'm gonna go I'm gonna go and so she seized the moment and I want to tell you tonight seize the moment I believe the lord gave me this subject I'm not the best preacher or the most the best that eloquent deliverer whatever I wish it would come out the way it comes but it just doesn't but you need to have faith God orchestrated this moment he gave the subject we're not just sitting in church we're not just sitting here hearing some more information oh this is not very deep well this is quite cool and this and then yeah go past it yes yes this is your opportunity Mary it's your opportunity Mary go to go deeper to go further in with Jesus oh and she sees the moment seize the moment Sons and Daughters of God sees it and take take ownership of of now because now is your present and it's a gift of stop looking forward to the end of the service stop looking forward to to when you get home and you can go to bed stop looking forward to tomorrow even if it's mundane sometimes we get looking forward to tomorrow sometimes we look forward to the lunch after church sometimes we do that the devil gives you the information yeah it's that's little statue but right now now yes sir right at this moment people right at this and he's sitting here and he needs somebody to wash his feet he needs somebody to cross the line of judgment intimacy it is somebody to go from homelessness into hope and then into faith and then into deliverance and then into healing and then into a new birth and then into the full baptism of the Holy Ghost I believe Mary was in the upper room and I believe she received the Holy Ghost I believe she had a real Deliverance Hallelujah can't meet the Messiah and not be the same so she was running to the apocathy the prophet says that she says I want the best Alabaster Box you got in the store I want the best you've got clinks the money on the counter oh when he sees the money it's different now because I don't think she got a good welcome he'll be like oh no who's this I don't know I know sometimes when I'm at work and someone walks in and I'm like Oh my I don't want to talk anyway oh man I get so busy and so caught up and this guy would have had no time and we got people locals that come in and they want to talk for four hours about nothing just chill the chatter and I can't be bothered anyway forgive me Lord yes and the woman says I want the best you've got this is a perfume this is an incense this is going to cost you everything um it's gonna cost you all that money that you're saved all your life all that substance pour it out so she takes the best and I want to ask you if you could write your worship and how you pour out your Alabaster Box men is it links or is it Hugo Boss is it rexona or is it cold water girls is that what's that stuff called impulse oh my or is that Gucci Rush what are you giving him you can come to church and you can give him Rick's owner impulse links is that why you're gonna spray on his feet he's not looking for that yeah he's looking for the cool he's looking for a cool trip Hallelujah he's looking for some real cologne from your heart not from your mind not showing other people how good you can worship how good you can praise no he wants your heart he wants to pawn out and he wants it all and here she is she comes running back in the foot was like oh I know you should cut it on him nothing in her she stood behind him and said and then she began to fall down and cry she lost control she lost control she broke the box and she poured it out on him and she anointed his feet and all the floodgates open this is righteousness amen this is the approach yeah it's been restored since it's been restored he's sent Elijah the prophet he made a way that you could approach God Hallelujah so that you could cross the line between judgment and mercy so far that you can never get out become a president of Jesus Christ throw away the key Lord see they didn't worship him so what does he what did they do what happened and let the rocks cry out he let the rock of Revelation in her heart it was a revelation that came to a rock and she fell down and out of the rock came the Living Water yeah all over his feet and she anointed his feet and she cried and this woman who had been a great Sinner and who was in Hopeless condition and thought she would never get delivered and thought she would never be changed all of a sudden her whole life changed and she wasn't ashamed of what other people thought she wasn't ashamed the devil would have said are you going to lose all your clients you're going to lose your life you know it's not worth it Mary you're going to lose your friends what friends those three or four friends that are holding you back from Jesus Oh My she's something in her crossed over and she said no more knocking around I'm going in and I'm staying in I'm throwing I'm burning the bridges I'm going right in

everybody's hearing nothing did she have any reputation did she have anything to stand on all she had was a Hallelujah and so we're gonna sing the song in the atmosphere of the Lord and I want you to be like that woman tonight you may not have been a prostitute you may not even be in any Darkness but there's still things that God wants to do in your life and so I approach god with the hope and the expectation and believing that he will you you're approaching him like he she approached him lit tonight this Hallelujah song be your Alabaster Box pour it out pour it out on him is he worth it if

condemnation and failure could disable us there would be no Ministry there would be no pastors there would be no preachers there would be no anything no gifts nothing would operate if condemnation disabled us if we could be condemned but there is no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus and walk not after the flesh but after the spirit who haven't desired a servant maybe you've failed
