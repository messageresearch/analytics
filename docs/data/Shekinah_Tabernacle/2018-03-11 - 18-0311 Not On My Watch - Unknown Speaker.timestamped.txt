[48:09] we're gonna have Church lunch at the
[48:12] community center Nick's Sunday or the
[48:14] 18th and we're gonna have the AGM either
[48:17] there if we have time or back here so
[48:19] after lunch next next weekend amen so
[48:22] let's just take our Bibles shall we and
[48:24] we'll go to 2nd chronicles chapter 34
[48:28] and we're going to read also from the
[48:32] book of Corinthians as well let's just
[48:34] go to 2nd chronicles in chapter 34 and
[48:37] we're gonna read from verses 15 to 30
[48:40] I'm sorry it's a bit of a long well I'll
[48:43] be standing longer than you but um you
[48:46] know but I want you to get this my so
[48:48] let's just read this and then we'll get
[48:50] into what the Lord has placed on my
[48:54] heart today so syncing chronicles 34 and
[48:58] it says this here
[48:59] from verse 15 so just a background
[49:03] before you read so King Josiah
[49:05] there's a righteous King he's already
[49:07] driven out much of the idol worship in
[49:10] Israel he has commanded that the temple
[49:13] would be repaired and as they have been
[49:15] repairing the temple they found a book
[49:17] of the law so they found the Bible they
[49:19] didn't even have a Bible and they found
[49:21] it and then they begin to read it and so
[49:24] it's amazing when when revival revival
[49:27] takes place the word comes back into
[49:29] into preeminence and so and it said in
[49:32] and so this is from verse 15 so this is
[49:35] where we are in the story but I
[49:36] encourage you go read the whole chapter
[49:37] and season and hilkiah answered and said
[49:40] to SEF and the scribe I have found the
[49:44] book of the law in the house of the Lord
[49:45] and hilkiah delivered the law the book
[49:48] to
[49:50] chuffing forgive me if I've pronounced
[49:52] he's all prolly differently and chuffing
[49:54] carried the book to the king and brought
[49:55] the king word again saying as it was
[49:59] committed to to thy servants they do
[50:01] it's that's that's repairing the temple
[50:03] and they have gathered together the
[50:05] money that was found in the house of the
[50:06] Lord and have delivered it into the hand
[50:08] of the overseers and to the hand of the
[50:11] workman hold on
[50:14] is it all then in sefferman the scribe
[50:21] told the king saying he'll kayo the
[50:24] priest has given me a book and Stefan
[50:26] read it before the king and it came to
[50:28] pass when the King had heard the words
[50:29] of the law that he rent his clothes and
[50:31] the king commanded he'll cure and hikin
[50:35] the son of seven and abdon the son of
[50:38] mica and seven the scribe and a messiah
[50:41] a servant of the king saying go inquire
[50:46] of the Lord for me and for them that are
[50:48] left in Israel and in Judah concerning
[50:49] the words of the book that is found for
[50:52] great as the wrath of the Lord that is
[50:54] poured out upon us because our fathers
[50:56] have not kept the word of the Lord to do
[50:59] after all that is written in this book
[51:00] and he'll kaya and they that the King
[51:04] had appointed went to holder the
[51:07] prophetess the wife of Shalom the son of
[51:11] silk the son of Esther oh the keeper of
[51:15] the Wardrobe now she dwelt in Jerusalem
[51:17] and the college and they spake to her to
[51:21] that effect and she answered them and
[51:24] thus saith the Lord God of Israel tell
[51:27] you the man that sent you to me thus
[51:30] saith the LORD behold I'll bring evil
[51:31] upon this place and upon the inhabitants
[51:34] thereof even all the curses that are
[51:36] written in the book which they have read
[51:38] before the king of Judah because they
[51:40] have forsaken me and have been and sits
[51:42] unto other gods that they might provoke
[51:44] me to anger with all the words of their
[51:46] works of their hands
[51:47] therefore my wrath shall be poured out
[51:49] upon this place and it shall not be
[51:51] quenched and as for the king of Judah
[51:55] who sent me to inquire of the Lord so
[51:59] shall you sound to him thus saith the
[52:01] Lord God of Israel concerning the world
[52:03] which thou hood because thine heart was
[52:07] tender this is very important and now
[52:11] Dennis humble thyself before God when
[52:15] thou Harris to his words against this
[52:17] place and against the inhabitants
[52:20] thereof and humblest thyself before me
[52:23] and that it's not written and it's
[52:25] written I close and weep before me I've
[52:28] even heard thee also saith the Lord
[52:32] behold all gather near thy father's and
[52:35] thou shalt be gathered to thy grave and
[52:37] peace neither shall they and I see all
[52:40] the evil that I have I will bring upon
[52:42] this place and upon the inhabitants of
[52:45] the same so they brought the word the
[52:47] King word again that the king sent and
[52:50] gathered together all the elders of
[52:52] Judah and Jerusalem now notice he
[52:54] doesn't just sit back and say well I'll
[52:57] be gathered in peace i watch the world
[52:58] go by notice what he does and the king
[53:01] went into all the house I went up into
[53:03] the house of the Lord and all the men of
[53:05] Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem
[53:06] and the priests and the Levites and all
[53:08] and all the people great and small and
[53:12] he read in their ears all the words of
[53:15] the book of the covenant which was found
[53:17] in the house of the Lord and the king
[53:20] stood at his place and made a covenant
[53:21] before the Lord to walk but after the
[53:25] Lord and to keep his Commandments and
[53:27] his testimonies any statutes with all
[53:29] his heart and with all the soul to
[53:31] prefer to preform the words of the
[53:33] Covenant which is written in this book
[53:35] and he caused all who were president
[53:38] Jerusalem and Benjamin to stand to do it
[53:40] and the inhabitants of Jerusalem did
[53:42] according to the covenant of God the God
[53:45] of their fathers and Josiah took away
[53:47] all the abominations out of all the
[53:49] country there pertained to the children
[53:51] of Israel and made all that were
[53:53] president Israel to serve even to serve
[53:55] the Lord their God and all his days they
[53:58] departed not from following the Lord the
[54:01] god of their fathers hallelujah now
[54:04] let's go to let's go to 2nd Corinthians
[54:07] 5 I'm going to read verses 9 to 15
[54:26] synchronous 5 9 to 15 is wherefore we
[54:32] labour that we're the prisoner absent we
[54:36] may be accepted of him for we must for
[54:40] we must all appear before the judgment
[54:42] seat of Christ that every one may
[54:45] receive the things done in this body in
[54:47] his body according to that he hath done
[54:50] whether it be good or bad knowing
[54:53] therefore the terror of the Lord we
[54:54] persuade men but we are made manifest
[54:56] unto God and Trust also are made
[54:59] manifest in your consciences now if any
[55:04] man build upon the foundation weight
[55:07] sorry if I got that twice oh wait it's
[55:16] just in the wrong order sorry
[55:19] now if any man build upon this
[55:22] foundation gold silver no forgive me 1
[55:31] Corinthians 3 okay we'll just leave it
[55:33] there sorry about that you may all have
[55:35] your seats we'll get me to that later
[55:36] now if I want to entitle this something
[55:41] I want to speak a subject not on my
[55:44] watch I trust this is all your heart's
[55:46] desire by the end of the service now we
[55:49] read here about Joe siren and if you
[55:51] read the story of Josiah he was a
[55:54] righteous King he walked before the Lord
[55:56] in all of his ways before the account we
[55:59] just read he had already begun to drive
[56:01] all of the take the idols out of his
[56:03] rally early begin to purge the high
[56:04] places and these different things and
[56:06] when and and then he commanded the
[56:09] people to to repair the temple and they
[56:11] they found the book of the law and the
[56:13] temple amazing they had no Bible I mean
[56:16] but they found the Bible the word came
[56:17] back and so now it was read before the
[56:21] king and we see that he was he was he
[56:24] rent his clothes because he knew that
[56:26] God was a God of his word so all of the
[56:29] curses and all the blessings that were
[56:31] written amen in the Old Testament they
[56:34] were going to apply and he knew because
[56:37] the nation had been wicked they had
[56:39] there
[56:39] save God's wrath and nothing could
[56:42] ultimately turn it from happening but we
[56:45] see here that God God spoke through a
[56:48] prophetess saying that yes this will
[56:50] happen but not in your days but we see
[56:53] that he did not just sit back and say
[56:55] well I'm going to go to the grave and
[56:57] peace all's fine whatever will be will
[57:00] be
[57:01] you know let's stop being so Calvinistic
[57:05] Calvinistic is if we're previously we'll
[57:07] be there if we're not we won't you know
[57:09] yo won't worry about it God's looking
[57:12] for you to pick up a burden God is
[57:14] looking for you to say what will you do
[57:16] what are you what are you going to
[57:18] purpose in your heart to do are you
[57:21] gonna watch the world go by float down
[57:23] the stream like some dead fish floating
[57:24] or are you going to swim against the
[57:26] tide
[57:27] I meant to swim and run this race what
[57:29] are you going to do and so now he so
[57:32] after he heard that he wearied he
[57:35] preached all the abominations he
[57:36] finished purging all the abominations
[57:38] out of Israel and he brought the people
[57:40] and he and he had the words spoken to
[57:42] them and he caused them to enter into a
[57:44] covenant with God because he would have
[57:47] purpose in my heart this is my heaven
[57:48] but but not on my watch if I have
[57:51] anything to do with it it will not
[57:52] happen and the next generation it will
[57:54] not happen there either we understand
[57:57] that there's a Great Tribulation coming
[57:59] we know that there is a great apostasy
[58:01] amen
[58:02] already upon the earth but we should
[58:04] purpose in our hearts not on my watch
[58:06] I'm not going to let this lukewarm lady
[58:09] I see in just a little bit of emotion
[58:11] sometimes come to church sometimes just
[58:14] a half haphazard kind of walk I'm not
[58:16] gonna let that affect me not on my watch
[58:18] not while I have life in this body I'm
[58:21] not going to just let it affect me and
[58:23] watch the world go by
[58:24] we have one life to live friends one
[58:26] life to give so I wouldn't just sit back
[58:29] I'd say Here I am Lord
[58:32] Alleluia you know the zeal of the sages
[58:34] to repent you read the latest in church
[58:38] age the letter the zeal of the ages to
[58:40] repeat hallelujah to turn from
[58:43] wickedness and serve God not in a
[58:46] lukewarm or lukewarm way where people
[58:49] just have a little bit of emotion we
[58:51] have a nice little time there's no
[58:52] victory in the
[58:53] camp we're just walking on like waster
[58:55] that's not what God has called us to
[58:57] have God has called us to have victory
[58:59] unto victory hallelujah
[59:02] so we read here and first Corinthian and
[59:07] sick in Corinthians 5 if we can
[59:12] find us again we shall all appear before
[59:16] the judgment seat of Christ this is not
[59:19] the white throne judgment this is not
[59:23] the white throne judgment you read in
[59:25] the book of Daniel you read in the New
[59:28] Testament as well the bride does not go
[59:30] to the white throne judgment in the Book
[59:33] of Daniel it says that he saw a vision
[59:35] and there was and there was thousands
[59:38] ministered unto Him God Himself standing
[59:42] in the judgment within thousands times
[59:43] thirteen thousand stood before him
[59:45] that's a great white throne judgment
[59:47] there and so the bride is judging
[59:49] judging with Christ Paul says no you
[59:52] know that the Saints shall judge the
[59:54] earth and so when do they do that they
[59:56] are they are standing in the judgment
[59:58] seat with God himself so we do not go to
[1:00:02] the great white throne judgment Amen it
[1:00:05] says and John he that heareth my word
[1:00:07] and believeth on him that sent me shall
[1:00:10] not go to the condemnation but is passed
[1:00:12] but has everlasting life and has passed
[1:00:15] from death to life so that condemnation
[1:00:17] is the judgment so the bride receives
[1:00:21] heareth hears his word his his god's
[1:00:23] voice to this age which is the message
[1:00:26] of Malachi 4 they hear that word it
[1:00:28] changes them it changes their heart from
[1:00:30] unbelief to faith hallelujah and it says
[1:00:33] you have everlasting life now and you
[1:00:35] shall not go to the condemnation the
[1:00:37] judgment the bride is not sitting there
[1:00:40] in the white throne judgment I mean as
[1:00:42] in being judged she judges with Christ
[1:00:44] well so we all have that firmly cemented
[1:00:47] in our minds right so now Paul is saying
[1:00:51] well then we'll what is the judgment
[1:00:53] seat of Christ this is a this is a
[1:00:55] judgment that you receive rewards for
[1:00:58] what you have done in your body you
[1:01:01] receive rewards we all receive you can't
[1:01:04] lose eternal life but you
[1:01:06] receive rewards for what you do for him
[1:01:09] this is not talking about salvation
[1:01:11] salvation is already sorted I trust it
[1:01:14] has in your life I mean this is not
[1:01:16] about if you go on the rapture Oh mr.
[1:01:19] rapture if you become one with this word
[1:01:21] here everything everything he tells you
[1:01:24] to do if you become one with this more
[1:01:27] than just baptism I mean how we dress
[1:01:29] modest apparel uncut here forces as a
[1:01:32] protection amen how we conduct ourselves
[1:01:36] all those things you become one with it
[1:01:39] if you become one with it you become one
[1:01:44] with him you can't you can't you can't
[1:01:46] receive Jesus Christ as personal Savior
[1:01:48] and rejecters word because he and it's
[1:01:50] word are one they're not two people
[1:01:53] they're not two different things his
[1:01:54] word and him are the same so you can
[1:01:57] trust see how I received him but in your
[1:01:59] rejecters word you turning him down amen
[1:02:02] the proof you have received it was
[1:02:03] saviors receive His Word you made that
[1:02:07] he say that's awful strong in the
[1:02:09] beginning was the word and the Word was
[1:02:11] with God in the word whilst God the word
[1:02:12] became flesh and dwelt among us amen we
[1:02:15] don't want to turn down his word we will
[1:02:19] be judged according to what we did in
[1:02:21] our flesh and it's for rewards now this
[1:02:28] got a little further he says this in 1st
[1:02:32] Corinthians 3 and 9 for we are laborers
[1:02:35] together with God ye are God's husbandry
[1:02:38] ye are God's building according to the
[1:02:41] grace of God which is given unto me as
[1:02:43] the wise masterbuilder I have laid the
[1:02:45] foundation and another buildeth thereon
[1:02:47] but let every man take heed how he
[1:02:50] builds thereupon for our foundation can
[1:02:53] no man lay that is laid which is Jesus
[1:02:55] Christ now if any man build upon this
[1:02:59] foundation gold silver precious stones
[1:03:02] hey a wood hay stubble every man's work
[1:03:06] shall be made manifest for the day shall
[1:03:09] declare it because it shall be revealed
[1:03:11] by fire and the fire shall try every
[1:03:15] shall shall try every man's work
[1:03:20] of what sort it is if any man's work
[1:03:23] abide which he has built thereupon he
[1:03:26] shall receive a reward if any man's work
[1:03:29] shall be burned he shall suffer loss but
[1:03:32] he himself shall be saved yet so as by
[1:03:36] fire this is the judgment seat of Christ
[1:03:39] what are you building what are you
[1:03:43] building in your Christian life
[1:03:45] what are you doing every man has to get
[1:03:48] we shall all appear before the judgment
[1:03:50] seat of Christ and we'll have to give an
[1:03:53] account for our Christian walk this is
[1:03:56] not I'm not talking about salvation here
[1:03:58] do we all understand this this is not
[1:04:01] like we're in peril will we go to hear
[1:04:02] it or not if God has really became real
[1:04:04] to you and you're manifesting his word
[1:04:06] then you'll you've become one with him
[1:04:09] then you have to go okay I trust I don't
[1:04:12] I don't want to let you to color in any
[1:04:14] spaces today this is the judgment seat
[1:04:17] of Christ we all must appear before so
[1:04:21] you got to look at now what am i doing
[1:04:23] you say well it doesn't matter what my
[1:04:28] walk is it's personal between me and God
[1:04:30] you'll walk or fix the whole church
[1:04:32] you'll walk affects the whole body of
[1:04:35] Christ what you do and your conduct and
[1:04:38] how you treat each other and how you
[1:04:39] live affects the whole body of Christ it
[1:04:43] affects the whole body of Christ if one
[1:04:46] member suffers or one member is living
[1:04:48] in sin and unbelief it affects the whole
[1:04:50] body if one member has a spirit of
[1:04:53] rebellion it affects the whole body and
[1:04:55] we're gonna do it but a reading I want
[1:04:56] to show this now this is the story
[1:04:59] oops we're gonna read this where's it
[1:05:06] take support
[1:05:10] let's try this again god bless brother

[1:05:23] actually my fault yeah my tablet died
[1:05:27] and I gotta go old school anyway for
[1:05:31] each so brother Brown speaking about
[1:05:33] Aiken who knows the story of Aiken they
[1:05:36] cross Jordan they take they take they
[1:05:39] take Jericho they gotta come against AI
[1:05:41] but but as they're taking the spoils out
[1:05:43] of out of Jericho one man gets selfish
[1:05:46] and he hides a Babylonian government in
[1:05:48] a wedge of gold because he's not looking
[1:05:51] he's looking for just natural rewards
[1:05:52] instead of walking in the light of God's
[1:05:55] Word now I'm going to show you this in
[1:05:57] the New Testament as well because people
[1:05:58] say oh that's Old Testament that's under
[1:06:00] the Lord God's full of grace he is full
[1:06:01] of grace but he but he doesn't just let
[1:06:04] you get by he's not a doting granddad
[1:06:07] that that you know if you really love
[1:06:10] someone you are not indifferent to how
[1:06:13] they feel you are not indifferent if you
[1:06:17] really love that person you care how
[1:06:19] your conduct a conduct and what you say
[1:06:22] affects them as in their right you
[1:06:24] really care above all things you'll
[1:06:26] rearrange your life you'll change what
[1:06:29] you do because you're concerned I love
[1:06:31] them I want to show my love and what I
[1:06:33] do and how I treat them and where I go
[1:06:36] and what I say isn't that that's just
[1:06:38] natural how much more God Himself we
[1:06:40] made all things who shed his blood upon
[1:06:42] the earth

[1:10:36] birdly fail you believe us your conduct

[1:10:45] misbehavior can cause this church to
[1:10:48] bitterly fail amen
[1:10:51] I could leave it right there I've seen
[1:10:54] it I've seen other churches around and
[1:10:56] they have Bentley failed because of this
[1:10:59] they have all wearing the bride we got
[1:11:02] the message we're going in a rapture now
[1:11:04] we know that I mean from these things
[1:11:05] we're not I mean from these things this
[1:11:07] is not a picnic this is not a picnic
[1:11:10] friends and on the day of judgment
[1:11:14] you'll be responsible for every bit of
[1:11:17] it oh you say now wait a minute brother
[1:11:19] branham well that's the truth think of
[1:11:21] it Joshua after he crossed over into the
[1:11:27] land God gave him the promise just think
[1:11:29] to fight an entire campaign without
[1:11:32] losing a man without even getting a
[1:11:35] scratch
[1:11:36] without having to have a nurse or a
[1:11:38] first-aid or a band I think it means
[1:11:40] band-aid amen
[1:11:41] God said the land is yours go fight
[1:11:43] think of fighting a campaign
[1:11:46] there's no Red Cross around at all
[1:11:48] there's nobody going to get hurt and
[1:11:50] they slayed the Emirates and the
[1:11:53] Hittites but it wasn't one hurt among
[1:11:55] any of them until sin came into the camp
[1:11:58] and when a kentuc the Babylonian Gulman
[1:12:00] and their gold wedge and hid it under
[1:12:02] his camp then the next day they lost 16
[1:12:05] men
[1:12:05] Joshua said stop stop wait a minute
[1:12:07] there's something wrong something's
[1:12:09] wrong here we're going to call the seven
[1:12:12] days of fast God made us a promise that
[1:12:15] there nothing will hurt us our enemy
[1:12:18] will fall at our feet and there's
[1:12:19] something wrong here something went
[1:12:21] wrong somewhere cause we've got 16 dead
[1:12:24] men laying here there is like brothers
[1:12:26] and they did now whatever you do do me a
[1:12:29] favor put your pitchfork down put it
[1:12:32] down do not think this is for someone
[1:12:34] else oh I hope that person gets it you
[1:12:38] you stop that right now
[1:12:39] because the devil will allow you to go
[1:12:41] like this and you could be the one with
[1:12:43] that spirit that's causing the problem
[1:12:45] and you'll mess your deliverance I did
[1:12:51] not enjoy coming here this morning to
[1:12:53] speak this to you I'll be real honest I
[1:12:56] haven't been happy about it but here we
[1:12:58] are we've got to take this we're gonna
[1:13:00] take our gloves off we're not we're not
[1:13:02] we're not toddlers
[1:13:03] we're to look it in the face and we're
[1:13:06] gonna say lord help us we don't want to
[1:13:11] bid ly fail amen no one who wants to bid
[1:13:14] ly fail here put your hand up no I want
[1:13:17] to go to heaven victorious and they did
[1:13:23] why did they die innocent man because
[1:13:26] one man stepped out of the line you see
[1:13:29] you see you see reason this needs to be
[1:13:32] taught the church lining up lining up
[1:13:34] with the Word of God
[1:13:35] lining up with God and lining up with
[1:13:38] each other walking perfectly upright
[1:13:40] soberly before all men fearing God
[1:13:43] because one man stole a garment and done
[1:13:46] something that he should not have done
[1:13:48] took the life of 60
[1:13:50] mean I think it was 16 maybe more I
[1:13:51] believe it was 16 that was dead Joshua
[1:13:55] said there's something wrong God made
[1:13:58] the promise and something's wrong when
[1:14:00] we bring the sick up before us and they
[1:14:02] fail to be healed we need to call a
[1:14:03] solemn fast call an assembly something's
[1:14:06] wrong somewhere
[1:14:07] God made the promise he's got to stick
[1:14:10] to that promise and he'll do it
[1:14:13] amen we're gonna get to the New
[1:14:15] Testament soon but I'm just gonna keep
[1:14:16] going a bit more with this he says and
[1:14:20] you've got tapes on that you've got
[1:14:22] tapes on what we believe this is from
[1:14:23] crisis of mystery of God revealed you've
[1:14:25] got tapes on discipline in the church
[1:14:26] how to behave yourself in the Church of
[1:14:28] God how we've got to come to here
[1:14:30] together and sit in heavenly places
[1:14:32] don't stay don't stay home if God's in
[1:14:35] your heart you can't hardly wait for
[1:14:36] them doors to open out yonder to get in
[1:14:39] here to fellowship with your brothers
[1:14:41] why does it
[1:14:43] why can you hardly wait to get in the
[1:14:44] door to fellowship with your brothers
[1:14:46] and sisters amen if you don't feel that
[1:14:51] way then I tell you it's time you got to
[1:14:53] praying because we're in the last days
[1:14:56] with a Bible exalted or exhorted us much
[1:14:59] more as we see that they approaching to
[1:15:01] love one another with Christian love and
[1:15:03] divine love to ensue to assemble
[1:15:06] ourselves together in heavenly places
[1:15:07] and Christ Jesus and love one another
[1:15:09] this will all men know that you are my
[1:15:12] disciples when you love one from another
[1:15:14] that's right stay right together if
[1:15:20] brother you think he's a little wrong or
[1:15:22] the sisters say Lord don't let me never
[1:15:25] have a root of bitterness springing up
[1:15:27] because it'll affect him it'll take the
[1:15:30] Christ Road right out of my life that
[1:15:32] poison acids of malice and jealousy and
[1:15:36] hatred that will just take the Holy
[1:15:38] Spirit right away from you and it'll run
[1:15:40] them from the Tabernacle here and I see
[1:15:43] it amen and it'll kill the Spirit of God
[1:15:45] or drive it away from here hurt your
[1:15:47] posture and it does and it does it does
[1:15:52] it does I never understood this until
[1:15:55] recently it does hurt us it'll do
[1:16:01] everything see don't do that
[1:16:03] you just wax that much closer together
[1:16:05] drawer up take the buckle as the brother
[1:16:07] testified a minister here the other
[1:16:09] night about having a buckle seeing it in
[1:16:11] a vision see that buckles the whole
[1:16:13] armor of God just put it on tight
[1:16:14] tighten up move right up close to one
[1:16:16] another love one another
[1:16:18] anyhow talk nice about one of the say
[1:16:20] nice things about one another
[1:16:22] then God will bless you now it says here
[1:16:27] about how the malice now when I'm
[1:16:30] reading all these things think about we
[1:16:32] shall all appear before the judgment
[1:16:33] seat of Christ we will give an account
[1:16:35] and there'll be you'll have to if you
[1:16:38] are packing these things you'll have to
[1:16:41] give an answer one day and you won't be
[1:16:43] able to hide it with with a with a
[1:16:46] veneer of a liar or twisting the truth a
[1:16:48] little bit you'll be fully exposed
[1:16:50] before Jesus Christ you won't have one
[1:16:53] place to hide and he'll ask you why did
[1:16:55] you build this wood hay and stubble of
[1:16:58] malice malice is an evil intent towards
[1:17:01] someone how you treat someone Envy
[1:17:05] strife goodness and forgiveness why did
[1:17:07] you build that why did you cause cliques
[1:17:10] to form in the church why did you cause
[1:17:13] church splits why did you cause the love
[1:17:15] to go from sum
[1:17:18] why did you why did you allow this to
[1:17:21] happen you have to give an account you
[1:17:25] have to give an account and it won't be
[1:17:27] actually over this person no it's all
[1:17:29] remember when you point a finger at
[1:17:31] someone there's three pointing back at
[1:17:33] you Jesus tells us in a parable why take
[1:17:37] the little twig basically out of your
[1:17:39] brother's eye when you go to hole beam
[1:17:40] in your own take that out first take
[1:17:43] that out first and then you can help
[1:17:45] your brother amen
[1:17:47] why do we waste worries pointed someone
[1:17:49] else are there the problem there the
[1:17:52] problem well how about you how about you
[1:17:55] you're to look in the mirror of God's
[1:17:57] Word and say God is at me you honestly
[1:18:01] have to this is not about what they do
[1:18:03] Jesus hang on Calvary he said Father
[1:18:06] forgive them they don't know what they
[1:18:09] do he did not say I crush you bunch of
[1:18:12] people you hypocrites how dare you do
[1:18:14] this some
[1:18:14] I have a right to be angry he didn't do
[1:18:17] that he said Father forgive them he
[1:18:19] didn't lead any rule of goodness coming
[1:18:21] to him he all the rejection he came to
[1:18:23] his own his own received him not he did
[1:18:28] not hold it against them and we will
[1:18:31] take some pity little thing and it will
[1:18:34] become an idol in our life and our whole
[1:18:36] Christian walk
[1:18:37] well because someone said this to me or
[1:18:39] or someone did this to me and I'm
[1:18:41] jealous of this person and I resent this
[1:18:43] person or because maybe they're living a
[1:18:46] holier life than you and it will become
[1:18:51] our whole Christian walk and that's wood
[1:18:53] hay and stubble and Jesus will ask you
[1:18:56] why did you build that why did you allow
[1:18:58] it to be built why did you why did you
[1:19:01] make this thing why did you allow this
[1:19:04] thing to grieve my spirit away from a
[1:19:06] group of my children it says in the
[1:19:09] Bible Ephesians 4 and 30 greevey not the
[1:19:13] Spirit of God whereby you're sealed unto
[1:19:16] the day of your redemption you can
[1:19:18] grieve them away
[1:19:19] you can't grieve them away and you'll be
[1:19:23] asked why did you grieve me I died on
[1:19:26] Calvary to walk with you but because of
[1:19:29] your attitude and your unforgiveness and
[1:19:32] your resentment I could not walk with
[1:19:35] you like I wanted to walk oh but where
[1:19:37] predestinated what have you purposed in
[1:19:39] your heart to do many people they leaned
[1:19:42] on predestination and they're still
[1:19:43] living in unbelief what do you have a
[1:19:47] free will as for me and my house we will
[1:19:50] serve the Lord as for me in my house
[1:19:53] that's a decision you're going to make
[1:19:56] that decision
[1:20:03] sorry watch out churches a few years ago
[1:20:07] when we had the old-fashioned holiness
[1:20:10] churches it's still old-fashioned
[1:20:13] holiness where they stood for God and
[1:20:15] righteousness when woman dressed and
[1:20:17] acted like ladies men dressed and acted
[1:20:19] like men when people went out at the
[1:20:22] church on Sunday morning when they had
[1:20:24] all-night prayer meetings when they had
[1:20:26] the old fashioned type they had a real
[1:20:28] revival God blessed he cut off every
[1:20:31] enemy before them they were journeying
[1:20:33] on but when the wage of making God in
[1:20:35] the camp with nothing left but
[1:20:36] destruction he says we're on our word
[1:20:38] God on our Road God keeps his word the
[1:20:42] testing time come the testing time come

[1:20:49] testing time come for the Pentecostal
[1:20:51] church it comes for every Church it
[1:20:55] comes for every person the testing time
[1:21:00] the testing time what are you gonna do
[1:21:03] are you gonna be an akin and cause the
[1:21:06] whole campaign to cease are you gonna be
[1:21:09] an akin or are you gonna really be in
[1:21:12] harmony with God's Word you say well I
[1:21:14] have rights
[1:21:15] I had rights too but I became a love
[1:21:17] prisoner to Jesus Christ I don't have
[1:21:20] any rights well I have a right to to to
[1:21:23] wear shorts and cut my hair and drink
[1:21:25] and smoke and whatever more I had rights
[1:21:27] to brother Brown was in South Africa
[1:21:29] there's a photo of him in the Kruger
[1:21:32] National Park in a safari suit who's
[1:21:35] seen it in shorts in' and and and socks
[1:21:39] his daughter who who showed the
[1:21:41] slideshow said that was a 1950 and the
[1:21:45] brothers talked them into putting it on
[1:21:47] now and that we you all know what
[1:21:51] happened to him in 1950 when he went to
[1:21:52] South Africa
[1:21:53] God told him to have meetings in certain
[1:21:56] places but because of the influences of
[1:21:58] the ministry of man he listened to man
[1:22:00] instead of God and he suffered terribly
[1:22:02] for it amen he suffered for that trip
[1:22:06] and we will take that and use it as an
[1:22:08] excuse say well he did it people as
[1:22:10] oppression look we're out here in the
[1:22:12] Kruger we're just brothers around put
[1:22:13] this on it'll be funny he was taught she
[1:22:16] she'd Rebecca bread
[1:22:17] Smith said he was talked into putting it
[1:22:19] on and that trip didn't go so well for
[1:22:22] him because of human influence are you
[1:22:25] all following what I'm saying they meant
[1:22:28] I had a right to do those things god
[1:22:30] convicted me before I even heard it
[1:22:32] you're naked
[1:22:33] aye aye I threw them out the Spirit of
[1:22:37] God should convict you of sin jesus said
[1:22:41] the Spirit of God the Holy Spirit should
[1:22:43] convict you of sin if it's really there
[1:22:46] it will and so now that campaign didn't
[1:22:50] go very well from he came home with a
[1:22:52] knee buzz he was very sick at all these
[1:22:53] things because he listened to man
[1:22:54] instead of God he suffered for that as a
[1:22:58] lesson we have to look at that and say
[1:23:01] well if that didn't go so well for him
[1:23:03] because he listened to man and I'll just
[1:23:05] do this because we're here and it's you
[1:23:06] know what about you that's what she said
[1:23:11] about it I don't care what other people
[1:23:12] make of it that's what his daughter see
[1:23:13] that actually showed the photo the
[1:23:16] testing time now remember
[1:23:28] okay
[1:23:32] he says he I don't know why this is not
[1:23:34] here but anyway he says the testing time
[1:23:38] come the testing time comes I read that
[1:23:41] and there's only one way wait maybe
[1:23:42] that's still there
[1:23:43] forgive me I'm still getting used to
[1:23:45] this and there's only one way only one
[1:23:49] way you can ever know that you're right
[1:23:52] stay with God's eternal blueprint stay
[1:23:54] with the word what God says that's right
[1:23:57] don't take nothing less or nothing more
[1:23:59] why should we take a substitute for this
[1:24:01] that and the other when God's Word is
[1:24:04] full of promises yes sir we don't have
[1:24:07] to take any substitutes this is the
[1:24:09] truth God keeps his word don't matter
[1:24:11] how unreasonable it may seem God keeps
[1:24:13] his word anyhow he certainly did stay
[1:24:16] with God's blueprint you'll get the
[1:24:19] results the Brut blueprint said it would
[1:24:20] give now remember that in this promised
[1:24:27] land that don't mean you're immune from
[1:24:29] sickness that don't mean you are immune
[1:24:31] from troubles but it does spell this or
[1:24:33] let the sink deep it says this that it's
[1:24:36] yours
[1:24:37] amen everything in Jesus Christ is ours
[1:24:39] our promised land just rise up and take
[1:24:42] it see and remember the only way that
[1:24:45] Israel ever lost a man as we in sin God
[1:24:47] in the camp there's only one way we
[1:24:49] could ever lose a victory is for sin to
[1:24:51] get in the camp something wrong
[1:24:53] somewhere when I can stall that wage and
[1:24:56] that Babylonian garments sin was in the
[1:24:58] camp and the battle went wrong you give
[1:25:00] me this church tonight this group of
[1:25:02] people perfectly perfectly in the
[1:25:04] promise of God with the Holy Ghost
[1:25:06] walking in the spirit I challenge any
[1:25:09] disease or any affliction or anything
[1:25:11] that there is every Joe Lewis that's in
[1:25:14] the country with all this infidelity and
[1:25:15] all the unbelievers that there is to
[1:25:17] bring any sickness or affliction in the
[1:25:19] store and we'll walk out here perfectly
[1:25:21] whole yes sir God gave the promise only
[1:25:24] sin of unbelief can keep it away now
[1:25:27] we've got to get down to what are this
[1:25:30] little sinners and we know sinners
[1:25:32] unbelief they say well that's all Old
[1:25:35] Testament this is in the book of
[1:25:37] Corinthians we all know the Corinthians
[1:25:38] were a group of believers I mean they
[1:25:41] were believers they were the bride in
[1:25:43] the first age they were part of the
[1:25:44] bride in the first age
[1:25:45] brother Bram tells us he said that
[1:25:49] another book of Acts is being written in
[1:25:51] this endtime another book of X now
[1:25:55] that's just not healings and miracles
[1:25:57] and prophecy inversions the book of Acts
[1:26:00] the Corinthian church was birthed out of
[1:26:02] the book of Acts the Galatian church was
[1:26:04] birthed out of the book of Acts the
[1:26:06] Ephesian Church the Thessalonica Church
[1:26:08] they all came with birth during the book
[1:26:11] of Acts period so these groups of
[1:26:13] believers were birthed into the kingdom
[1:26:16] during another during a book of X being
[1:26:18] written and now if there's another book
[1:26:21] of Acts being written in the end time
[1:26:22] then these other these groups will rise
[1:26:24] again amen do you understand history
[1:26:28] repeats itself if we're living in a book
[1:26:30] of X time these people will come these
[1:26:33] churches the conditions you see in the
[1:26:35] Galatian Church the Ephesian Church the
[1:26:37] Thessalonians like a church the
[1:26:39] Corinthian church all of those will be
[1:26:41] back here again amen
[1:26:45] because we're living in a book of Acts
[1:26:47] time you've got to understand this
[1:26:49] because that's why you can look around
[1:26:50] and say why are these people like this
[1:26:52] why are these people like this why these
[1:26:53] people like this and if you don't have
[1:26:55] understanding of the scripts you'll be
[1:26:56] confused but if you can see now this the
[1:26:59] book of Acts was the blueprint it's
[1:27:01] being repeated again what it was in the
[1:27:04] beginning is at the end but remember the
[1:27:05] Galatians were believers the Corinthians
[1:27:08] were believers the Ephesians were
[1:27:10] believers the church at Thessalonica was
[1:27:12] believers were they not they weren't
[1:27:13] they weren't unbelievers they were real
[1:27:16] believers they just had to grow they
[1:27:20] were influenced by certain spirits but I
[1:27:22] believe God brought them back amen
[1:27:26] he says it's commonly reported that
[1:27:29] there is fornication among us as sin in
[1:27:31] the camp this is in the New Testament
[1:27:33] it's commonly reported this fornication
[1:27:36] among you and such fornication as is not
[1:27:39] so much as named among Gentiles that one
[1:27:41] one should take us for others wife and
[1:27:44] ye are puffed up and have not rather
[1:27:46] mourned that he that had done this deed
[1:27:49] might be taken away from among you fry
[1:27:52] really as absent in the body but present
[1:27:54] in spirit have judged already and though
[1:27:57] I were present concern
[1:27:59] that has so done this deed in the name
[1:28:03] of our Lord Jesus Christ when ye are
[1:28:05] gathered together in my spirit with the
[1:28:06] power of our Lord Jesus Christ to
[1:28:09] deliver such as one under Satan for the
[1:28:10] destruction of the flesh that the spirit
[1:28:12] may be saved in the day of the Lord
[1:28:14] Jesus your glorifying is not good no
[1:28:17] you're not that a little leaven living
[1:28:21] the whole lump
[1:28:23] we know yeast yeast is living you put
[1:28:26] yeast into a dough it changes the whole
[1:28:28] nature of the dog it doesn't just it
[1:28:31] doesn't just raise a little bit of dough
[1:28:32] in other bits flat it spreads through
[1:28:34] the whole dough it changes the chemical
[1:28:37] composition of the dough it changes what
[1:28:40] the bread is like at the end a little
[1:28:42] leaven leavens the whole lump that's why
[1:28:44] I say we are accountable one to another
[1:28:46] we are accountable because what you may
[1:28:49] be doing is affecting all of us Amen we
[1:28:53] are accountable a little leaven leavens
[1:28:55] the whole lump it will change our
[1:28:58] churches
[1:28:59] look at these Corinthians they lost
[1:29:01] their vision they begin to fight among
[1:29:03] themselves I'm of Paul I'm of a polis
[1:29:06] I'm of Cephas I'm of Christ
[1:29:08] I mean I'm of these different ministries
[1:29:10] in Christ well maybe I just stream
[1:29:11] righteous listen to tapes they were all
[1:29:14] gathering around these ministries and
[1:29:16] all the ministries with God given by the
[1:29:18] they became carnal their account of
[1:29:21] people they allowed this said when Paul
[1:29:22] says it's commonly reported among you
[1:29:24] that this fornication obviously it
[1:29:26] wasn't a secret thing it became : common
[1:29:29] knowledge amen so was just allowed to
[1:29:33] sit there and it changed the whole
[1:29:35] thinking of the church now there are
[1:29:37] fussing among each other
[1:29:39] there was divisions there was cliques
[1:29:41] you know they were all gathering around
[1:29:43] different ministries everyone had a
[1:29:45] psalm or a horse your song were a word
[1:29:48] of knowledge or something to say it
[1:29:49] they're all puffed up but yet they are
[1:29:52] believers or because the sin
[1:29:56] it was another akin in the camp they
[1:30:00] mean and there'll be question asked to
[1:30:04] this fellow who did this we know in the
[1:30:06] second book he repeats and he's he's
[1:30:07] back in the church but if he did not
[1:30:09] repent the big question why why did you
[1:30:12] build this
[1:30:13] Wood hay and stubble why did you allow
[1:30:15] this to happen why'd you step beyond the
[1:30:18] word when the word says you shall not do
[1:30:20] this why did you do it and he left to
[1:30:24] give an account see see that - it
[1:30:29] basically turned him over to Satan that
[1:30:30] his spirit will be saved but his flesh
[1:30:32] would be destroyed so it doesn't mean
[1:30:34] that he'd lose his salvation he'll be
[1:30:37] taken but he will be saved but his body
[1:30:40] will be destroyed right so he will still
[1:30:42] but he had to give an account
[1:30:49] she's purged therefore out the old
[1:30:51] leaven that ye may be a new lump as ye
[1:30:55] are unleavened for even Christ our
[1:30:57] Passover sacrifice for us therefore let
[1:31:00] us keep the feast not with old leaven
[1:31:02] neither with the leaven of malice and
[1:31:04] wickedness but with the unleavened bread
[1:31:07] of sincerity and truth maybe that's what
[1:31:10] he's saying don't don't keep the malice
[1:31:12] don't keep the old old ways but serve
[1:31:15] the Lord I mean with unleavened bread of
[1:31:17] sincerity and truth amen
[1:31:21] it's one
[1:31:31] now what a great leader Joshua become
[1:31:33] never losing a battle at least something
[1:31:35] went wrong in the church when a
[1:31:36] kentucker which it wasn't
[1:31:38] Joshua's shape faith that did it it was
[1:31:41] he took a Babylonian garment in a wedge
[1:31:43] of gold out of the camp and when he did
[1:31:45] it hindered the whole battle one member
[1:31:48] suffers all members suffer suffers what
[1:31:51] God is coming to one of these days
[1:31:53] brothers a church without spot or
[1:31:54] wrinkle he's coming to a spirit-filled
[1:31:57] Church that divinely love of God so
[1:32:00] welded their hearts together that
[1:32:02] they'll walk as one amen one member
[1:32:06] suffers all the members suffer now I
[1:32:16] want to go back to I want to go back to
[1:32:20] this scripture here and that we read
[1:32:24] very early on the peace we all must give
[1:32:27] an account because I'm going to come to
[1:32:29] it but we all must give an account for
[1:32:36] what we what we build we almost give an
[1:32:40] account if it's gold or hay wood and
[1:32:43] stubble because the fire god is going to
[1:32:45] prove out prove our works well we've
[1:32:48] done in this flesh before the judgment
[1:32:50] seat of Christ now that's why you've got
[1:32:53] to look at now you see you know I'll
[1:32:57] come to a reason why do you want a labor
[1:32:59] labor in this body that you'll get a
[1:33:02] reward that's because well let's just go
[1:33:07] to it real quickly but it season it
[1:33:09] season revelations chapter four there
[1:33:11] are four and twenty elders around the
[1:33:13] throne and it says now that they cast
[1:33:17] their crowns before the throne now these
[1:33:19] four and twenty elders they represent
[1:33:21] the older New Testament believers they
[1:33:23] represent you and they have been given
[1:33:26] crowns because of their service upon the
[1:33:29] earth and they cast it before him they
[1:33:33] say thou art worthy O Lord to receive
[1:33:35] glory and honor and power for thou has
[1:33:37] created all things and for all thy
[1:33:39] pleasure they are and were created so
[1:33:43] here's now here's a
[1:33:44] would they receive a reward now they
[1:33:48] have something to give back to him like
[1:33:51] why do you like what do you say it's so
[1:33:53] important to build the right things and
[1:33:56] to enter you know and to look for a
[1:34:00] reward
[1:34:01] I want something to give back to him I
[1:34:03] want something to give back to him you
[1:34:05] understand
[1:34:06] I want something to light a street I
[1:34:08] mean what you you gave it all for me I
[1:34:10] gave it all for you
[1:34:12] hallelujah I labored not that I was
[1:34:15] looking for maybe how big it was
[1:34:17] i I serve them because I love them and
[1:34:19] just to be there will make me happy will
[1:34:21] make me very it'll make it worth it all
[1:34:23] but I want something to lay at his feet
[1:34:24] I mean I want something say Lord here it
[1:34:28] is here's my life I gave for you here's
[1:34:30] my life I lived for you hallelujah
[1:34:33] I want something to lay and don't you
[1:34:35] want that too don't you want something
[1:34:37] to present back to him I mean that you
[1:34:39] won't just add a you know a deathbed
[1:34:43] confession which those are ok cuz
[1:34:45] they'll be there but I want to be
[1:34:47] morally as a did did confession I want
[1:34:50] something I will turn to later sweet
[1:34:52] because he is worthy he is worthy of all
[1:34:55] of our time he's worthy of all about
[1:34:58] love he's worthy of everything we are
[1:35:00] all of our energy don't you want
[1:35:03] something oh but I'm gonna be there it
[1:35:05] doesn't matter
[1:35:06] I want something to lay at his feet I
[1:35:08] want to say Lord there's a reason it was
[1:35:11] you died for me I mean there's a reason
[1:35:16] you saved me and I wanted to live out
[1:35:17] that reason it's not just a sit at a
[1:35:20] seat at the winning supper of the Lamb I
[1:35:22] mean but we we he redeems us in this
[1:35:25] life for a reason
[1:35:28] amen and brother Graham says that the
[1:35:30] souls that that people saved like for
[1:35:33] example if someone see it out as a
[1:35:35] missionary and souls come into the
[1:35:37] kingdom the church that sins that
[1:35:39] missionary out will be attached with
[1:35:42] those souls for all of eternity amen
[1:35:46] there your name you could be associated
[1:35:49] with someone else coming in hallelujah
[1:35:53] isn't that worth it there are people you
[1:35:57] say well the bride will be the
[1:35:58] we turn it a little predestinated yeah
[1:36:00] but God has hands and feet upon the
[1:36:02] earth what are we living for what are we
[1:36:05] striving for amen
[1:36:08] what are we building I mean when we need
[1:36:11] pity jealousy and insecurity amen affect
[1:36:16] others and damage people and God will
[1:36:21] say why did you build that why did you
[1:36:23] laugh do you know there's been this is
[1:36:25] true and in America and misses churches
[1:36:29] there's been church splits over the
[1:36:32] color of the carpet when they renovate
[1:36:33] the building there's been church splits
[1:36:36] over carpet color and those people who
[1:36:41] had to stand there on that day and the
[1:36:45] Lord will say why did you why did you
[1:36:46] cause the work of God to fragment and
[1:36:48] split and pain and anguish and hurt and
[1:36:52] resentment and and wounds that took a
[1:36:54] long time to heal effectively that
[1:36:56] church became you know became like it
[1:36:59] went into the ditch for a season because
[1:37:01] when there's hurt and pain you can't run
[1:37:03] hey if I've got a stitch I can't run as
[1:37:06] fast as I can without the stitch if
[1:37:08] there's blood pouring out of my leg I
[1:37:10] can't sprint I'm wounded I being paradis
[1:37:15] yeah if my leg is broken you won't see
[1:37:17] me during the hundred they say hold on
[1:37:19] let this get better and so now not just
[1:37:22] individuals but whole groups are still
[1:37:24] in Estill in and plaster still wounded
[1:37:28] because someone in their pettiness said
[1:37:32] no I'm not gonna stand for this out of
[1:37:35] pettiness and jealousy in so little
[1:37:37] things and they caused a church to be
[1:37:40] basically in the ditch for a while and
[1:37:42] it had to get fixed and repaired how we
[1:37:45] treat each other I want this to really
[1:37:47] sink real deep how we treat each other
[1:37:50] well that person said something you know
[1:37:52] love is corrective do you know love is
[1:37:55] corrective if I didn't love my girls I
[1:37:58] mean if I love them all correct them

[1:38:08] happy I want you to enjoy your day
[1:38:10] they're on the street they're gonna die
[1:38:12] statistically speaking someone's gonna
[1:38:14] hit them oh but I left them so much and
[1:38:18] God will say you're a steward over those
[1:38:21] girls your steward over them I placed
[1:38:25] that not yours they are given to you for
[1:38:27] a season to race yeah and he'll say why
[1:38:30] did you let them go because I loved him
[1:38:32] I want them to be happy and he'll say no
[1:38:36] you don't you didn't love them
[1:38:38] you didn't care for them you didn't
[1:38:40] Creek them in their era amen and people
[1:38:45] can come to us and you say hey brother
[1:38:48] sister what about this what about this
[1:38:51] and people say oh they don't love me
[1:38:53] they do love you I mean if someone came
[1:38:58] to me with description see brother have
[1:39:01] you considered this in your life I'd say
[1:39:04] thank you that means you care about me
[1:39:06] that means you want me to be victorious
[1:39:08] that means you want me to overcome I
[1:39:10] mean that means you want me to make it I
[1:39:12] mean that doesn't mean you want to put
[1:39:15] me down in a hole and say you'll never
[1:39:16] make no you want to lift me up
[1:39:18] we have blind spots so we're not we have
[1:39:21] blind spots and we think we're all
[1:39:23] peachy and everything's wonderful
[1:39:24] we're blind spots you know there's a
[1:39:27] there's a method of of mastering sheep
[1:39:29] if you're if you're going up through
[1:39:31] trees and stuff where where where the
[1:39:34] view is obscured you know there'll be
[1:39:36] people coming from different angles
[1:39:38] because I maybe look at the forest this
[1:39:40] way and they may be a dozen sheep I
[1:39:43] can't see so someone will come this way
[1:39:45] but they're there in my blind spot do
[1:39:48] you understand there are my blind spot I
[1:39:49] can't see them so so another ship it
[1:39:51] will come around this way and he'll see
[1:39:53] them as though they're over there and
[1:39:55] I'm if I'm pity and I'm prep full of
[1:39:59] pride I'll look at him and say I'm a
[1:40:01] shepherd I've been here longer than you
[1:40:03] I've been here shorter than you I'm
[1:40:05] better at this what are you talk about I
[1:40:06] can't see them and they'll remain there
[1:40:09] because they're in my blind spot but if
[1:40:11] I'm humble if I am humble to the word
[1:40:14] and I know that that person actually has
[1:40:16] my best interest in mind
[1:40:18] irrespective of how they say it I'll
[1:40:21] actually say thank you I'll go get those
[1:40:24] sheep I did not see them
[1:40:26] your help we're helping each other amen
[1:40:32] we want something to give them
[1:40:34] I don't want honestly friends you want
[1:40:38] to stand there on that day and God you
[1:40:41] have to give an account why did you
[1:40:43] treat your brother and sister that way
[1:40:45] why did you speak evil of them why did
[1:40:48] you murder their their i what he call it
[1:40:51] the influence why did you murder their
[1:40:54] influence to others when they are the
[1:40:58] one that God we all have a gift we're
[1:41:03] all here for one another we're all here
[1:41:05] to help one another
[1:41:06] but if you put it someone in a box and
[1:41:08] label them a certain way and you tell if
[1:41:11] I know this is how they are what's
[1:41:13] happened you've basically tied up their
[1:41:15] mouth
[1:41:16] tied up their hands thrown them in a
[1:41:17] closet thrown them into prison because
[1:41:19] the influence has now been killed and
[1:41:21] that one influence could have could have
[1:41:24] helped many people but because of our
[1:41:28] own it's such a pity thing I use that
[1:41:30] word penis there's such a pity thing
[1:41:32] that we would allow our humanity and our
[1:41:36] pride to get in the way of what God
[1:41:39] wants to do he sees this here we're
[1:41:49] going back I want something to lay at
[1:41:51] his feet don't you now surely
[1:42:00] he says here wait
[1:42:04] spiritual adoption yeah and here is the
[1:42:09] point I want to drive home may the Holy
[1:42:12] Spirit take it to every heart of you
[1:42:13] believers just because you're a believer
[1:42:15] certainly you are you have everlasting
[1:42:18] life God said so but would you want to
[1:42:21] get in as job said by the skin of your
[1:42:23] teeth would you just want to come before
[1:42:26] the father and the talent he has given
[1:42:28] every one of you as being negligent you
[1:42:31] didn't you just didn't use it or you let
[1:42:33] something else stand in your way you let
[1:42:36] petty things that meant nothing to you
[1:42:38] after all little fascist Jews and
[1:42:40] arguments and church differences take
[1:42:42] the meekness and gentleness from your
[1:42:45] life would you stand would you want to
[1:42:47] stand before the father like that I
[1:42:49] don't believe you would I don't believe
[1:42:52] you would do that neither would I now I
[1:42:54] want him to say it was well done not by
[1:42:58] the skin of my teeth
[1:42:59] but it was well done my good and
[1:43:01] faithful servant enter into the joys of
[1:43:03] Lord for you did well with what you have
[1:43:06] to do he says maybe you're a housewife
[1:43:09] if you are God made you a teacher of
[1:43:12] your children do a good job out of it
[1:43:14] regardless of what you have to do do it
[1:43:17] well now wives you will not be
[1:43:21] accountable for your husband's actions
[1:43:23] on that day because the husband is the
[1:43:24] head of the house you will not be
[1:43:26] accountable for what he does you will
[1:43:29] not be accountable for how he how he
[1:43:30] treated the word has attitude towards
[1:43:32] this entire message in this time you you
[1:43:35] will not be held accountable for what he
[1:43:37] does but you'll be accountable for your
[1:43:38] children and what they and what they do
[1:43:42] you will be accountable for how they are
[1:43:44] raised you will be accountable you
[1:43:46] restored over those kids I look at them
[1:43:50] and I say Lord they are your daughters
[1:43:52] they are yours you purchase their
[1:43:55] salvation on Calvary you sent a load to
[1:43:57] the Prophet that they would go in a
[1:43:59] rapture Amen you send this message that
[1:44:02] they would become one with you in the
[1:44:04] same time they're your property they are
[1:44:06] not my property and I'll be given I'll
[1:44:09] have to I'll have to give an account
[1:44:11] what did you do with those girls
[1:44:13] oh why did you let them on the road
[1:44:16] because I loved him no you didn't love
[1:44:18] them you were not you didn't because if
[1:44:22] you really love them you would have
[1:44:23] corrected them amen but they are I'm
[1:44:25] assured of them but your mum's will be
[1:44:28] accountable for your children that's why
[1:44:30] it's so important
[1:44:31] you've gotta set it in your hearts
[1:44:33] gathering as it as a group of believers
[1:44:36] should be the most important thing in
[1:44:38] the week not just a Sunday amen
[1:44:43] we will I want to teach my kids we go to
[1:44:45] church you say well they'll fall asleep
[1:44:47] I'd rather than fall asleep in the
[1:44:48] prisons of God amen they're not I'd
[1:44:53] rather them asleep where God is moving
[1:44:54] people being delivered hallelujah people
[1:44:57] agree filled with the spirit I'd rather
[1:44:59] them asleep in that kind of atmosphere I
[1:45:01] mean then not in that atmosphere amen we
[1:45:05] need to teach them this is what we
[1:45:07] should it's important you say but but
[1:45:11] God is with me at home but he's greater
[1:45:13] where two or three gathered you say well
[1:45:15] there's three of us in the house when
[1:45:17] more of God comes together
[1:45:19] brother ham says that the fullness of
[1:45:20] the Godhead bodily is now on the church
[1:45:23] amen
[1:45:24] there's more of God here then you just
[1:45:26] by yourself or you and your family by
[1:45:28] yourself amen
[1:45:31] it's important you say but it's you but
[1:45:35] but you say but it's just this just
[1:45:37] works I'd say I want to be like Josiah
[1:45:40] on my watch
[1:45:42] hey this world may go into a tribulation
[1:45:45] and there will be a generation where God
[1:45:47] is no longer known but not on my watch
[1:45:50] there will be a generation in this
[1:45:52] message where it's just a club I mean
[1:45:56] there will be people who are just a
[1:45:57] cultural message believer that do not
[1:46:00] know God not on my watch not on my watch
[1:46:04] friends the elders that were with Joshua
[1:46:07] says in the book of Judges that after
[1:46:09] those elders died then Israel turned to
[1:46:11] idols not on my watch you say but they
[1:46:16] still believe deals Jehovah God and and
[1:46:18] and and if you ask them well did Moses
[1:46:21] really deliver you and did all those
[1:46:22] things happen that's absolutely but they
[1:46:24] turn to idols because it was
[1:46:26] to the generation that was with Joshua
[1:46:28] after the generation that was with the
[1:46:30] pillar of fire then they turn to idols
[1:46:32] and I'd say they say not on my watch
[1:46:35] what are you gonna do I just want I
[1:46:39] don't I want you to purpose in your
[1:46:40] heart not on my watch I mean not while I
[1:46:44] have life in my body there's gonna be a
[1:46:47] witness upon the earth it may just be
[1:46:49] one Here I am at Meyer's well be me what
[1:46:56] are you building husband's you will be
[1:46:58] responsible for your wives and how they
[1:47:01] dress and the things they do and how
[1:47:03] your family is but let me tell you this
[1:47:05] it's not proud beating the man it's not
[1:47:08] making them conform and as you pray and
[1:47:11] God comes down into your house and the
[1:47:13] atmosphere of God will change them I met
[1:47:16] the husband is the priest of the home
[1:47:19] they're the conduit you say but my wife
[1:47:22] knows God yeah but you're in your a you
[1:47:24] have an office of being the priest of
[1:47:26] the home I mean the priest was the
[1:47:28] conduit for God to come down amen
[1:47:32] you have an office to stand in but I'm
[1:47:35] busy
[1:47:36] forget the busyness what are you
[1:47:38] rearranging your life around I mentioned
[1:47:41] so I've said it before I'm we've all
[1:47:42] laughed but imagine someone who's going
[1:47:44] to run the hundred of the Olympics and
[1:47:46] it's maybe two years out and they've
[1:47:48] already qualified and they're sitting on
[1:47:50] the couch eating pizza watching the
[1:47:52] world go by
[1:47:53] and they tell you I believe I'm gonna
[1:47:57] win
[1:47:57] I really believe I'm gonna get there oh
[1:47:59] I'm gonna stand on the podium and you
[1:48:02] would look at them and say you don't
[1:48:03] believe that you don't believe you're
[1:48:05] gonna win your life is proving you're
[1:48:06] not gonna win how can you expect to win
[1:48:09] and you're eating pizza on the catch

[1:48:11] running shoes I don't know but I'm gonna
[1:48:13] win hallelujah
[1:48:14] it may sound ridiculous but it's how

[1:48:19] couch doing nothing ah but I'm busy
[1:48:21] what's important friends do you know
[1:48:25] what gives people motivation if they're
[1:48:27] going to win a gold they have the stats

[1:48:34] distance it is just to get on the podium
[1:48:36] I'm in striking distance we get to get a
[1:48:38] bronze or get a silver
[1:48:39] and a motivate semen probably they put
[1:48:42] more energy in an effort
[1:48:44] how much more friends we've got some
[1:48:46] stats we've got some stats friends and
[1:48:48] it says he's gonna win it says you're
[1:48:50] going to get a rap show how the law says
[1:48:52] you're going to overcome should they
[1:48:54] give us motivation should it really put
[1:48:56] some energy in us and some some zeal

[1:49:10] with Jesus Christ can your blessings
[1:49:13] name them ton by tongue you'll be
[1:49:18] accountable but it's hell when God comes
[1:49:20] down you got to pray God comes down
[1:49:22] changes them that's how you get them
[1:49:25] that's how you get them into position I
[1:49:27] mean cuz just only conformity and
[1:49:31] enforcing people it doesn't work it's
[1:49:33] got to be from here sure you light
[1:49:36] before them say honey what about this
