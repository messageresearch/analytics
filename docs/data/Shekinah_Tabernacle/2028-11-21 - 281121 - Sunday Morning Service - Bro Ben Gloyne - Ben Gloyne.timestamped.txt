[49:55] used to sing this song years ago
[49:58] when i was dying from asthma
[50:01] and tb

[50:47] oh yes
[50:50] they shall run
[50:52] and not faint

[50:57] now when i sing it
[50:59] i don't sing it your way
[51:01] [Music]
[51:03] so
[51:03] when you come there just hold a bit
[51:06] as i said i sing it different but it's
[51:09] not a different song
[51:11] so when you come to the bases
[51:14] to the chorus wait a bit

[1:01:33] the first two verses here behold what
[1:01:35] manner of love the father has bestowed
[1:01:38] upon us that we should be called the
[1:01:40] sons of god therefore the world knoweth
[1:01:43] us not because it knew him not beloved
[1:01:46] now everyone say now
[1:01:48] now we are the sons of god
[1:01:51] and it does not yet appear what we shall
[1:01:53] be but we know that when he shall appear
[1:01:56] we shall be like him for we shall see
[1:01:58] him as he is
[1:02:01] i mean we're going to go to hebrews
[1:02:02] chapter 2 and we're going to read from
[1:02:04] verse 10
[1:02:05] down to verse
[1:02:06] 15 here
[1:02:11] amen so hebrews 2 and 10.
[1:02:15] it says here
[1:02:18] for it became him for whom are all
[1:02:21] things and by whom are all things and
[1:02:23] bringing many sons unto glory to make
[1:02:27] the captain of their salvation perfect
[1:02:29] through sufferings for both he that
[1:02:31] sanctifieth and they who are sanctified
[1:02:33] are all of one for which cause he is not
[1:02:36] ashamed to call them brethren
[1:02:39] saying i'll declare thy name until my
[1:02:42] brethren in the midst of the church will
[1:02:44] i sing praise unto thee and again i'll
[1:02:46] put my trust in him and again behold i
[1:02:50] and the children which god hath given me
[1:02:52] for as much sin as the children are
[1:02:54] partakers of flesh and blood he also
[1:02:56] himself likewise took part of the same
[1:03:00] that through death he might destroy him
[1:03:02] that had the power of death that is the
[1:03:04] devil
[1:03:05] and deliver them

[1:05:16] jesus christ's name amen
[1:05:19] amen god bless your friends you may have
[1:05:21] your seats this morning so i want to
[1:05:23] just kind of continue on i really
[1:05:25] enjoyed that on on on wednesday where it
[1:05:27] wasn't just a sermon a thought but it
[1:05:29] was a reality i mean because now we are
[1:05:31] living in the time where the sons and
[1:05:33] daughters of god will be fully
[1:05:34] manifested upon the earth you know this
[1:05:37] is an adoption season you know we know
[1:05:39] that uh in the book of galatians where
[1:05:41] where it says that you know we're all
[1:05:43] under the uh uh that that when the
[1:05:46] fullness of time was come god would send
[1:05:48] forth a son made of a woman made under
[1:05:50] the law to redeem them that were under
[1:05:52] the law that we might receive the
[1:05:53] adoption of sons now as brother isaac
[1:05:55] said and as the scriptures say that that
[1:05:57] adoption is the placing of a son and a
[1:05:59] family so it's not getting someone say
[1:06:01] from china or some other country not
[1:06:03] your not your family and bringing them
[1:06:05] into your family you know and then
[1:06:07] illegally adopting them into your family
[1:06:08] it's not that it's a son or daughter
[1:06:10] that's
[1:06:11] birthed into the family born into the
[1:06:13] family they get placed in position power
[1:06:15] and authority within that family now
[1:06:17] this is the season of the adoption or
[1:06:20] the placing of the sons and daughters of
[1:06:22] god in their rightful position and what
[1:06:25] i love about you know an adoption is
[1:06:27] actually everything is coming to their
[1:06:29] position in this day
[1:06:30] right it's just like when moses and
[1:06:32] joshua they would actually define the
[1:06:34] boundaries of say moab or you know you
[1:06:37] know of of edom or different nations
[1:06:39] around where the where israel would be
[1:06:41] in the promised land you know he would
[1:06:42] say that this is their inheritance
[1:06:44] they'd say mount sia's there inheritance
[1:06:45] and moab this is their land and this is
[1:06:48] the you know different ones and he'd say
[1:06:49] don't don't meddle with them you know
[1:06:51] just just just pass on through you have
[1:06:53] a different inheritance your inheritance
[1:06:55] is across jordan it's not on the other
[1:06:57] side of jordan and you know and and so
[1:06:59] so the so the borders of the different
[1:07:01] nations would be defined
[1:07:03] in those ministries now it's the same
[1:07:05] thing now under the ministry of the holy
[1:07:07] ghost in this day where the inheritance
[1:07:09] or the borders of every person on the
[1:07:12] earth is actually and the devil himself
[1:07:14] has been defined
[1:07:15] so for example what's the inheritance of
[1:07:17] the bride eternal life amen that we
[1:07:20] would be lifted up high above everything
[1:07:22] that can be named because we joint ears
[1:07:24] with christ by the blood of jesus christ
[1:07:26] so so god has defined our inheritance or
[1:07:28] our borders you know so that is the that
[1:07:30] is the believer filled with the holy
[1:07:32] ghost the true bride of christ you know
[1:07:34] that's the wise virgin as as jesus would
[1:07:36] say in the parable of the wise and
[1:07:37] foolish the foolish one has a different
[1:07:39] adherence they still get eternal life
[1:07:41] but they have to give their lives in the
[1:07:42] great tribulation but they'll be there
[1:07:44] on the other side but they have a
[1:07:46] different kind of inheritance right and
[1:07:48] then and in the world well they get
[1:07:49] their inheritance too because everyone's
[1:07:51] gonna everyone's so they're gonna reap
[1:07:54] right you know this this world has
[1:07:56] unfortunately reap corruption it will
[1:07:57] get destruction you know but you know
[1:07:59] those who sow eternal life i mean they
[1:08:02] will reap it i mean so if they give
[1:08:03] their lives to the lord they lose their
[1:08:04] lives they shall get it in the end
[1:08:06] hallelujah so everyone's everyone's
[1:08:08] inheritance has been defined even the
[1:08:10] devil's inheritance
[1:08:11] because god said satan i've created hell
[1:08:13] for you and your angels
[1:08:15] that is your portion
[1:08:17] that is your inheritance right but
[1:08:18] that's not our inheritance that's not
[1:08:20] our lot amen that's their lot but it's
[1:08:22] not my lot hallelujah i'm so glad that
[1:08:25] god and his great grace decided you're
[1:08:27] not going there
[1:08:28] he went there for me amen he became a
[1:08:31] sinner he died on calvary as a sinner
[1:08:33] with my sin upon his shoulders and he
[1:08:35] went to hell that i don't need to go
[1:08:37] hallelujah
[1:08:39] amen so so even in the old testament as
[1:08:42] the borders of the different nations
[1:08:43] around the promised land will be defined
[1:08:46] i mean so everyone's inheritance or
[1:08:48] portion would be defined in this day and
[1:08:51] it's really our choice what we want to
[1:08:52] be
[1:08:53] you know caleb and joshua decided the
[1:08:55] land's owls let's go get it it's mine
[1:08:58] thanks you know we know it was god
[1:08:59] moving on their hearts it was revealed
[1:09:01] to them but they decided to agree with
[1:09:02] that revelation i mean so same with us
[1:09:04] we have to agree with the word here
[1:09:06] first it anchors down here and it
[1:09:08] produces what it says it will produce
[1:09:10] amen so you know i would just agree lord
[1:09:12] the rapture is mine
[1:09:14] hallelujah what i love about you know we
[1:09:16] read that scripture there in in hebrews
[1:09:19] chapter 2
[1:09:20] where he would be the captain of our
[1:09:23] salvation
[1:09:24] right so he says for it became him of
[1:09:26] whom are all things and by by whom are
[1:09:29] all things and bringing many sons unto
[1:09:32] glory to make the captain of their
[1:09:34] salvation perfect through sufferings now
[1:09:37] that word captain is the same as it says
[1:09:39] in hebrews 12 the author and finisher of
[1:09:41] our faith amen so this captain that he
[1:09:43] has been made amen that means a leader
[1:09:46] it's one who initiates and carries it
[1:09:48] through
[1:09:49] right so god doesn't start a work that
[1:09:51] he can't finish right he cannot start a
[1:09:53] work and he and he cannot finish it he
[1:09:55] starts to work he's going to finish that
[1:09:57] work amen he is determined amen because
[1:09:59] remember our god one thing he cannot be
[1:10:01] is defeated
[1:10:02] our god cannot be defeated jesus christ
[1:10:04] is undefeatable amen death couldn't
[1:10:07] defeat him amen culture couldn't defeat
[1:10:09] him religion couldn't defeat him
[1:10:11] superstition couldn't defeat him nothing
[1:10:13] could defeat him in this earth or or in
[1:10:16] the worlds below hal couldn't defeat him
[1:10:18] satan couldn't defeat him death couldn't
[1:10:20] defeat him he's undefeatable right so if
[1:10:22] he is declared in his word he's gave a
[1:10:24] bride in this end time i mean she's been
[1:10:26] made in his image without spot or
[1:10:27] wrinkle right she's going to be there i
[1:10:30] mean as sure as the rapture is going to
[1:10:31] happen she's going to be there but you
[1:10:33] know what i love is that really you look
[1:10:35] in the scripture it's when pressure
[1:10:36] comes on it brings out what's within
[1:10:39] people
[1:10:39] when pressure comes on
[1:10:41] i mean and because really you know if we
[1:10:43] had it all good and that's why the devil
[1:10:45] has tried to make this world so nice is
[1:10:47] that we wouldn't want to leave but it's
[1:10:49] also that he doesn't want to god to
[1:10:51] express what he put within his children
[1:10:53] but it takes adversity it takes it takes
[1:10:56] opposition and you know there's a saying
[1:10:58] you know when the going gets tough the
[1:11:00] tough get going
[1:11:01] right and when the devil gets roaring
[1:11:03] the bride gets anointed and the bride
[1:11:05] begins to reveal who she is because
[1:11:07] pressure comes on you know beethoven was
[1:11:09] an incredible uh musician but we know
[1:11:12] that the the greatest masterpieces he
[1:11:15] ever written was when he was pretty much
[1:11:16] totally deaf
[1:11:18] but but the thing is he had such a gift
[1:11:20] in his life he wasn't willing to let his
[1:11:22] physical limitations his deafness
[1:11:25] progress progressively got worse
[1:11:27] but he did not let that physical
[1:11:29] limitation stop expressing what was
[1:11:32] within him
[1:11:33] hallelujah you know i was reading about
[1:11:35] him last night and you know one you know
[1:11:37] yeah one place that said that he hit
[1:11:39] he'd actually have a pencil or a pen in
[1:11:41] his in his in his mouth and he'd and
[1:11:43] he'd hold against the soundboard of the
[1:11:45] piano and he'd play a note and and he'd
[1:11:47] just feel the vibrations that note
[1:11:49] through the pencil and that's how he'd
[1:11:50] write his music other places it said
[1:11:52] that he would cut the cut the feet off
[1:11:54] his piano
[1:11:55] put it on the floor and he'd put his ear
[1:11:58] on the floor and he would play notes and
[1:12:01] then write it down
[1:12:02] and with his hearing it was really the
[1:12:04] lower end that he could only just hear
[1:12:06] the higher end he couldn't hear but he
[1:12:08] put it into his music and it and and and
[1:12:10] it said that the re uh how he did that
[1:12:12] was by pure imagination
[1:12:14] because he couldn't physically do it
[1:12:16] and and there was one story where he
[1:12:18] where he he conducts a great orchestra
[1:12:20] you know and he's a standing ovation
[1:12:21] behind him and someone had to turn him
[1:12:24] around to see the reaction of the
[1:12:25] audience because he couldn't hear them
[1:12:27] but the limitations of life did not stop
[1:12:29] him
[1:12:30] because he said this place is brother
[1:12:32] freddy said a couple of camps ago
[1:12:33] there's just too much music in me i mean
[1:12:36] i have to i have to conduct it i have to
[1:12:38] play it it's the same thing with the
[1:12:40] bride of jesus christ there's just too
[1:12:41] much of god in her i mean we can't let
[1:12:44] you know the devil try and cramp us down
[1:12:46] and cramp our style and put pressure
[1:12:47] upon us we're not going to let physical
[1:12:50] limitations hold us back
[1:12:52] you know what i love about redemption
[1:12:53] you know it doesn't matter where we
[1:12:55] start it's where we end
[1:12:57] you know we can start in a lot of a lot
[1:12:59] of bad spots but you know as it said in
[1:13:02] the scripture there he's bringing us if
[1:13:04] i can find it here bringing many sons
[1:13:06] unto glory now in order to be brought
[1:13:09] somewhere you have to leave somewhere
[1:13:11] right
[1:13:12] i so by by what we used to call the yy
[1:13:15] express walking i carried myself from
[1:13:17] home to church
[1:13:19] your cars brought you here if you drove
[1:13:21] right but you have to leave somewhere to
[1:13:23] to go somewhere
[1:13:25] so there's a place where we leave
[1:13:28] hallelujah we left somewhere no i'm not
[1:13:30] just talking about i'm not talking about
[1:13:32] physical now i'm talking about a
[1:13:33] spiritual realm right because we started
[1:13:36] born in sin now this is just putting a
[1:13:38] couple of scriptures together where born
[1:13:39] and sin shaped an iniquity come to the
[1:13:41] world speaking lies that was that was
[1:13:43] our that's what our first birth produced
[1:13:46] right we walked according to the prince
[1:13:47] of the power of the air the spirit that
[1:13:48] now worketh in the children of
[1:13:49] disobedience but remember down within us
[1:13:52] is
[1:13:52] sonship as a son or daughter of god
[1:13:54] remember we do not become a son or
[1:13:56] daughter of god by the new birth the
[1:13:58] reason we are born again is because we
[1:14:00] already were sons and daughters of god
[1:14:02] right it is actually god telling you
[1:14:04] you're my child right you're not just a
[1:14:06] natural children of your parents you're
[1:14:08] my child that's why i give you the
[1:14:10] baptism of the holy ghost that you would
[1:14:11] know that your father is god that's what
[1:14:14] it says when the holy ghost fell he says
[1:14:16] you know they cry abba father or my
[1:14:18] father my father there's a realization
[1:14:20] that god is your father and and that
[1:14:22] means you're part of god and if you're
[1:14:23] part of god god can't lose you i mean
[1:14:25] none of us children are going to be lost
[1:14:28] hallelujah he says all that the father
[1:14:30] has given me will come and all that
[1:14:32] comfort i'll know why it's cast out
[1:14:33] hallelujah so if god has initiated a
[1:14:36] work it's because we are sons and
[1:14:37] daughters of god i mean he does not just
[1:14:39] decide well they've come long enough and
[1:14:41] now now well they must be my child
[1:14:43] they're going to make no we already were
[1:14:45] that's why there's a hunger and a
[1:14:47] longing in our souls even before we knew
[1:14:49] god was god amen he was calling us to
[1:14:51] himself because he wanted to bring many
[1:14:54] sons unto glory hallelujah so there's a
[1:14:57] place that we have to leave
[1:14:59] amen we started off as slaves to sin
[1:15:02] amen now sin can manifest itself in many
[1:15:05] different ways i mean you know smoking
[1:15:07] drinking committing adultery whatever
[1:15:09] all those things but it boils down to
[1:15:11] unbelief
[1:15:12] so we so we started there
[1:15:15] we started in darkness alienated in our
[1:15:17] minds
[1:15:18] we started in shame
[1:15:20] we started in guilt now you can say amen
[1:15:23] you know but but this is where we were
[1:15:25] it doesn't matter if you are whole even
[1:15:26] now thinking you're a better christian
[1:15:28] than the rest of the world you started
[1:15:29] here
[1:15:30] you may be born in a message pew hearing
[1:15:32] all the deep mysteries from your from
[1:15:34] the cradle but you still started there
[1:15:37] right i mean we started in guilt we
[1:15:39] started in selfishness we started in
[1:15:41] pride we started in strife we started in
[1:15:44] death we started in religion but that's
[1:15:46] not where we're going to finish why so
[1:15:48] he brought us from those things i mean
[1:15:51] unto a glorified state
[1:15:53] hallelujah amen because he's bringing
[1:15:55] many sons unto glory and this is the age
[1:15:58] where he's going to fully manifest this
[1:15:59] we know ultimately he will be in the
[1:16:01] change of the body but god's going to
[1:16:03] demonstrate the power of his blood now
[1:16:05] yeah people think well i'm going to be a
[1:16:06] fully overcomer
[1:16:08] when i'm in the millennium or i'm going
[1:16:10] to be able to fully praise god when i'm
[1:16:11] in the millennium no no we're going to
[1:16:13] fully praise god now
[1:16:14] because what we are here is what will be
[1:16:16] there amen if you're free here you'll be
[1:16:19] free there amen if you're rejoicing here
[1:16:21] you'll be rejoicing there i mean now is
[1:16:23] the season of the liberty of the sons
[1:16:25] and daughters of god this is not god did
[1:16:28] not die on calvary for us to be you know
[1:16:30] half bound by by the world or by
[1:16:34] complexes or by the devil he didn't die
[1:16:36] for that he died that would be fully
[1:16:38] loosed
[1:16:39] amen by the blood of jesus christ you
[1:16:41] know what i love about redemption is it
[1:16:43] doesn't matter
[1:16:45] uh the state that we begin in you know
[1:16:47] there is a law in exodus
[1:16:49] in the old testament
[1:16:51] where it says in exodus 13 and 13 just
[1:16:53] the apartheid the verse says and every
[1:16:56] firstling of an ass thou shall redeem
[1:16:59] with a lamb
[1:17:00] so that's a donkey right so it didn't
[1:17:02] matter the state
[1:17:04] that that uh that that lam uh donkey was
[1:17:07] born in it could have been a purebred
[1:17:10] you know fine
[1:17:11] picture perfect thing
[1:17:12] or it could have been cross-eyed
[1:17:15] knobbly need you know stunted growth
[1:17:18] maybe things didn't go very well in the
[1:17:20] womb so maybe we'd be born with a whole
[1:17:21] bunch of trouble you know complexes pain
[1:17:25] grief anxiety guilt you know could have
[1:17:27] been bound down with all these things
[1:17:30] right but it was redeemable
[1:17:32] that was the main thing i mean the main
[1:17:34] thing is it is redeemable hallelujah so
[1:17:36] it doesn't matter what state you know we
[1:17:38] may come to the lord and you know we may
[1:17:40] be or cross-eyed and superstition or you
[1:17:42] know family problems nobody need and
[1:17:45] bent ears and complex down and problems
[1:17:47] from our past and we may be all kind of
[1:17:49] crippled up with those kind of things
[1:17:51] but we're redeemable
[1:17:53] hallelujahs it doesn't matter how we
[1:17:55] start i mean because remember in the old
[1:17:57] testament the blood of bulls and goats
[1:17:59] could only cover sin it could never
[1:18:01] change the nature of the worshipper
[1:18:03] right but under the blood of jesus
[1:18:04] christ his blood doesn't just cover our
[1:18:06] sin but the life within the blood the
[1:18:08] holy ghost comes into us and changes our
[1:18:11] nature amen that we are now manifesting
[1:18:14] as sons and daughters of god we are made
[1:18:16] in his image hallelujah
[1:18:19] amen so it doesn't mean you say well i'm
[1:18:21] not worthy to be redeemed no get that
[1:18:23] out of your mind
[1:18:24] i've got too many problems get that out
[1:18:26] of your mind i mean i've done too much
[1:18:28] wrong get that out of your mind it's not
[1:18:30] about what you perceive yourself as
[1:18:32] you've got to look to your lamb
[1:18:34] i mean because if the lamb was counted
[1:18:36] perfect then then the worshiper was
[1:18:38] accepted so so the pressure was never
[1:18:41] upon you and i
[1:18:42] oh can i be a son and daughter of god no
[1:18:44] that the pressure's not on you the
[1:18:46] pressure's on the one who initiated your
[1:18:48] salvation amen and if he's promised that
[1:18:51] he's able to do it he will do it i mean
[1:18:53] he never backs up he never starts
[1:18:55] calling someone to say well i guess they
[1:18:56] just don't have it no no no now when i'm
[1:18:58] talking about a call now i'm talking
[1:19:00] about it like a call like abraham was
[1:19:02] called this is not a blanket kind of
[1:19:04] people get under an influence of an
[1:19:05] atmosphere no god's calling that's what
[1:19:08] i mean that kind of call and if god's
[1:19:10] called you i mean god is going to do
[1:19:12] finish the work
[1:19:13] he's going to bring you into a position
[1:19:15] of power and authority
[1:19:16] and i believe this is the season just
[1:19:18] like brother isaac was he was declaring
[1:19:21] it and we've been you know we've heard
[1:19:23] it you know down through time this is
[1:19:25] the time of the manifestation of the
[1:19:27] sons of god this is the hour and now
[1:19:29] this is the hour i mean the things we've
[1:19:31] been looking for are here upon the earth
[1:19:33] hallelujah where god is pouring out his
[1:19:35] spirit i mean transforming people's
[1:19:38] lives i mean we're once lost but we're
[1:19:40] now found i mean the things that
[1:19:42] bothered our families for generations
[1:19:44] come to an end and because god
[1:19:45] annihilates it out of our lives he
[1:19:47] actually gives us overcoming power that
[1:19:49] it's not us trying to cope with our past
[1:19:51] and cope with our problems god just
[1:19:53] annihilates it
[1:19:54] i mean the things that once bother us
[1:19:56] they don't bother us no more because
[1:19:58] god's taking care of it
[1:20:00] hallelujah
[1:20:02] hallelujah amen brother brown was saying
[1:20:05] conferences he says i'm depending on it
[1:20:06] i'm not trusting what i am i'm trusting
[1:20:09] in what he is i cannot i cannot go to
[1:20:12] heaven jesus said i had to be perfect to
[1:20:14] get there be therefore perfect even as
[1:20:16] your father in heaven how can you be
[1:20:19] when he says look uh
[1:20:22] when you when you don't look at uh but
[1:20:24] don't look at you look at your sacrifice
[1:20:26] he says well a little donkey was born in
[1:20:28] the old testament he had broken down
[1:20:30] ears knocked knees cross-eyed why he
[1:20:32] knows he'll be knocked on the head he's
[1:20:34] no good but the mother could tell him
[1:20:36] son you're born with a birthright
[1:20:38] because you were born thus this way
[1:20:40] you'll live but the one that dies for
[1:20:42] you will have to be a perfect lamb
[1:20:44] will have to be offered so you can live
[1:20:47] they'll break um she says
[1:20:49] he is but you see but a perfect lamb has
[1:20:51] to die so he can live if you say you're
[1:20:53] no good i'm not worthy to be healed
[1:20:55] brother barum i'm not worthy to go to
[1:20:57] christ don't look at yourself look at
[1:20:59] your sacrifice
[1:21:00] i'm no good there's nothing good in me
[1:21:02] not even a thought
[1:21:03] there's nothing no good nothing no good
[1:21:05] in you there's none of us deserve
[1:21:07] anything but hell that's exactly but we
[1:21:09] have a lamb
[1:21:11] amen and that's the thing that matters
[1:21:12] and you see we've got to realize that in
[1:21:14] this time when the world is falling
[1:21:16] apart god hasn't withdrawn his spirit
[1:21:18] from the earth
[1:21:19] what he doesn't say well i guess it just
[1:21:21] got too hot to handle i know i just
[1:21:22] can't handle with what the devil's doing
[1:21:24] no the devil has to ask permission from
[1:21:27] god before he can do anything he had to
[1:21:30] go before god to talk about job and god
[1:21:32] gave him specific boundaries amen you
[1:21:35] can't the first time he said you can
[1:21:36] touch everything he has just don't touch
[1:21:38] him
[1:21:39] and then the next time and the devil
[1:21:41] would have pushed against that as hard
[1:21:42] as he could but he couldn't he couldn't
[1:21:43] cross that boundary right and then the
[1:21:46] second time you know because the devil
[1:21:47] said well he still loves you because
[1:21:49] he's fine you know because it's when
[1:21:51] health health crisis comes that's when
[1:21:53] people really you know the pressure
[1:21:54] really comes and then god just said to
[1:21:56] the devil well touch him but just don't
[1:21:58] take his life
[1:21:59] so devil took it to the nth degree
[1:22:02] but he couldn't take his life
[1:22:04] and god has to ask whenever the devil
[1:22:06] puts his filthy hands against you or
[1:22:08] against your family he has to ask
[1:22:10] permission from god
[1:22:12] and the reason god allows it it's like
[1:22:14] beethoven losing his hearing is because
[1:22:16] god wants to express i mean what's
[1:22:18] within you and it takes that kind of
[1:22:20] crisis or pressure to really reveal
[1:22:22] what's within you amen it's like it's
[1:22:25] like this this water this could
[1:22:27] potentially be any kind of
[1:22:29] liquid
[1:22:31] it could be it could be poison
[1:22:33] yeah it says it's water but how do i
[1:22:35] know
[1:22:36] that you know this is true there's some
[1:22:38] fancy numbers here with things the only
[1:22:40] way is to really open the bottle and
[1:22:42] drink
[1:22:45] you know
[1:22:46] but that's the only way to really see
[1:22:48] what's within it is to let it out
[1:22:50] and it's the same thing with you and i
[1:22:52] that we can we can we can play the part
[1:22:54] and everything can be fine when
[1:22:55] everything's fine but what about when
[1:22:57] crisis hits who do we depend upon amen
[1:23:00] do we do we wait upon the lord and let
[1:23:02] him take over or do we try and take it
[1:23:04] our own
[1:23:06] pathetic hands and try and fix things
[1:23:08] ourselves no son or son or daughter of
[1:23:11] god doesn't try and fix things with
[1:23:12] their own self their own mind they let
[1:23:14] god fight the battle they let god give
[1:23:16] the direction they let god say you say
[1:23:18] father what should i do in those and and
[1:23:20] you wait upon the lord and in his season
[1:23:22] he gives the answer then you can walk in
[1:23:24] confidence that you're not going in your
[1:23:25] own idea but you're going with thus
[1:23:27] saith the lord
[1:23:28] hallelujah but we are living in this
[1:23:30] hour where the sons and daughters of god
[1:23:32] are being manifested
[1:23:34] amen so never ever think you're not
[1:23:36] worthy don't look at yourself look at
[1:23:38] your lamb
[1:23:39] hallelujah because he is the one
[1:23:42] amen he is the one
[1:23:45] that matters
[1:23:46] hallelujah
[1:23:48] now
[1:23:50] this
[1:23:51] if he is the author of our salvation
[1:23:53] he's also the finisher of our salvation
[1:23:56] right so if he's begun a work he's going
[1:23:58] to end the work you know what i love
[1:24:00] about when pressure comes on and it
[1:24:02] reveals what's within a person
[1:24:04] you take the story of gideon
[1:24:06] here was a man he was hiding threshing
[1:24:09] wheat in secret because the enemy had
[1:24:10] come in and everyone just decided well
[1:24:13] we're not going to fight we're just
[1:24:14] going to go hide away and try and ride
[1:24:16] this thing out yeah and you know here's
[1:24:18] gideon used threshing wheat and secret
[1:24:20] you know then the angel lord comes to
[1:24:22] him now there's pressure in the land
[1:24:24] they're not living in liberty like the
[1:24:26] word said they should be the enemy had
[1:24:28] come to eat up the land and they were
[1:24:29] just trying to survive
[1:24:31] but then the angel says to him
[1:24:33] thou mighty man of valor
[1:24:36] so here was a man
[1:24:37] he was hiding away from the enemy
[1:24:40] and so humanly we would say this man's a
[1:24:42] coward but when god looked at him he
[1:24:44] said you're a mighty man of valor go in
[1:24:46] thy mind because god was not looking at
[1:24:49] his current circumstances god knew that
[1:24:51] he had to open his eyes of understanding
[1:24:53] to actually
[1:24:54] realize i am a mighty man of allah i'm a
[1:24:57] circumcised believer living in the
[1:24:58] promised land i'm a son of god living in
[1:25:01] my inheritance but he forgot who he was
[1:25:04] i mean and even manasseh the name
[1:25:05] manasseh means caused causing to forget
[1:25:09] so he was actually living under his
[1:25:10] tribal name he forgot who he was causing
[1:25:13] to forget because of situation and
[1:25:15] pressure because remember really when
[1:25:17] pressure comes on it should bring out
[1:25:18] the best in us
[1:25:19] amen and but it took a visitation of the
[1:25:22] angel of god to open gideon's eyes to
[1:25:24] say actually no you're a mighty man of
[1:25:26] valor because the name gideon means a
[1:25:28] warrior means a fighter amen but he was
[1:25:30] but he was living under his tribal name
[1:25:32] not his name that is he was given at his
[1:25:34] birth i pray o god that we would live
[1:25:36] according to the name we're given when
[1:25:37] we're born again as jesus christ is the
[1:25:39] mighty conqueror mrs jesus christ
[1:25:42] hallelujah so he had to realize he was a
[1:25:44] mighty man of valor and he and and you
[1:25:47] know they won the great you know they
[1:25:48] won one of the greatest victories
[1:25:50] recorded in history
[1:25:52] 300 men
[1:25:53] against a mighty host
[1:25:55] but god had commissioned him go on the
[1:25:57] power of thy might
[1:25:58] hallelujah shamga had to realize one day
[1:26:02] that the philistines coming along and
[1:26:04] and taking his crops and you know
[1:26:06] making him live just in poverty just
[1:26:08] surviving that wasn't his portion
[1:26:11] he had to look into really the lord had
[1:26:13] to reveal to him this is not who i meant
[1:26:15] to be
[1:26:16] i'm not meant to be bound down by
[1:26:18] spirits i mean by the devil pushing me
[1:26:20] which way and doing all kinds of ungodly
[1:26:22] things this is not my portion i mean my
[1:26:25] portion is i'm a son of god i'm a
[1:26:26] circumcised believer living in my
[1:26:29] inheritance hallelujah and he realized
[1:26:31] one day because he looked brother
[1:26:32] abraham said you know he looked into the
[1:26:34] into the eyes of his wife and saw
[1:26:36] desperation and looked at his children's
[1:26:38] state and then he began to realize by
[1:26:40] that because what pressure had come on
[1:26:43] what's he going to do this year they
[1:26:44] survived last winter but what about this
[1:26:46] winter
[1:26:47] and so the pressure really came on and
[1:26:50] he realized this cycle can end
[1:26:53] and it's in his power it's not in the
[1:26:55] philistines power it's in his power to
[1:26:58] undo it
[1:26:59] so he took his ox guard which is not a
[1:27:01] weapon why it's just a knock ox around
[1:27:03] to make them play on different things
[1:27:05] and he and he killed 600 philistines
[1:27:07] amen because he realized this is my
[1:27:10] position god has made me thus by my
[1:27:13] birth i am this i have not become this
[1:27:15] by my own ability i was born thus
[1:27:17] hallelujah it's the same thing with the
[1:27:19] believer by the new birth amen we are
[1:27:22] amen sons and daughters of god
[1:27:24] right we already were but it comes to
[1:27:26] life
[1:27:27] hallelujah we realize actually no it
[1:27:29] doesn't let the world fall
[1:27:30] apart right let the world fall apart we
[1:27:33] are not led by fear but faith
[1:27:35] this world has to fall apart it's been
[1:27:38] prophesied to fall apart right but we
[1:27:40] have received a kingdom that cannot be
[1:27:42] shaken why we have received yeah it says
[1:27:44] in hebrews that everything can be shaken
[1:27:46] will be shaken right and some of our
[1:27:48] humanity needs to be shaken away because
[1:27:50] we've got to realize that our our
[1:27:52] confidence cannot be in our own ability
[1:27:55] our confidence cannot be in our nation
[1:27:57] though this nation is a great nation our
[1:27:59] confidence must rest alone in the word
[1:28:01] of god and him leading us that's the
[1:28:04] only thing we can be you know have
[1:28:06] confidence in
[1:28:07] hallelujah and i believe i'm looking at
[1:28:09] a people this morning their confidence
[1:28:11] is in the lord i mean but he allows us
[1:28:13] to live in this time of trouble because
[1:28:14] he wants to prove to you i've got this
[1:28:17] i'm in control i mean i have not left
[1:28:19] you destitute i've not left you alone
[1:28:21] i've not left you just to try and
[1:28:23] struggle through it maybe survive no
[1:28:24] you're not going to just going to
[1:28:25] survive you're going to overcome
[1:28:27] i mean by me you're going to overcome
[1:28:29] this age you're going to you're going to
[1:28:31] live out what your predestination live
[1:28:33] out
[1:28:34] hallelujah you know we're all here for a
[1:28:36] purpose
[1:28:37] we're all here for a divine purpose you
[1:28:39] know if i can put it kind of cruelly
[1:28:40] maybe even your parents thought you were
[1:28:42] an accident but god didn't god never
[1:28:44] thought you were an accident no he
[1:28:46] planned you amen way before the
[1:28:48] foundation of the world amen and he
[1:28:50] ordained you to live in this season for
[1:28:52] a purpose he didn't just put you here to
[1:28:54] see if you're you know he put you here
[1:28:56] for a purpose
[1:28:57] just as my thumb has a purpose my eyes
[1:28:59] have a purpose you're upon the earth for
[1:29:01] a purpose amen and the devil cannot take
[1:29:04] us until our purpose has been finished
[1:29:07] the devil can't take our lives he may
[1:29:09] try and afflict us with all kind of
[1:29:11] troubles mind battles sickness whatever
[1:29:13] it may be but he cannot take our lives
[1:29:16] until god has allowed him to do so and
[1:29:18] the only reason that he would do that is
[1:29:20] because we have fulfilled our divine
[1:29:22] purpose in the world i mean so why
[1:29:25] should we worry
[1:29:26] i have life in my body because i have a
[1:29:28] purpose
[1:29:29] hallelujah but we should look into the
[1:29:31] word and see what our purpose is
[1:29:33] i mean because a lot of people have a
[1:29:34] lot of different purposes
[1:29:36] they have their ambition their plans
[1:29:38] their ideas they think that's why
[1:29:39] they're here no god has a purpose for
[1:29:41] our lives we are not insignificant
[1:29:44] i actually want to say the eagles are
[1:29:46] the church of today
[1:29:48] i don't believe the young people are the
[1:29:50] church of tomorrow no they're the church
[1:29:51] of today
[1:29:52] i mean if david could be a little boy
[1:29:55] 12 13 how are you what's the eagle
[1:29:58] anyway you know
[1:30:00] you know but here he was the church was
[1:30:02] in a gridlock against the philistines
[1:30:04] for 40 days the goliath came out made
[1:30:06] his boast bring me a man
[1:30:08] bring me a man and saul was backslidden
[1:30:11] king though you'd say the pastor was
[1:30:13] backslidden in his tent
[1:30:15] an evil spirit of god upon him the
[1:30:16] church was in gridlock right because the
[1:30:19] enemy just because that's what the enemy
[1:30:20] does he just wants to hold you there
[1:30:22] and wear you down and we're down but
[1:30:24] that's not our portion
[1:30:26] this is not a war of attrition this is a
[1:30:28] war of annihilation
[1:30:30] right we're here to annihilate the devil
[1:30:32] don't go looking for him he'll find you
[1:30:34] when he finds you you kill him
[1:30:36] you kick him out in the name of jesus
[1:30:37] christ
[1:30:38] so so there's that challenge going on
[1:30:40] but then a little boy you say someone
[1:30:42] from sunday school walked out
[1:30:45] he had his life he had the lunches
[1:30:47] brothers
[1:30:48] comes to the battle
[1:30:50] you know he walks in and maybe the older
[1:30:52] brothers who are jealous saying why are
[1:30:53] you in this prayer meeting
[1:30:55] why are you in this meeting you're too
[1:30:56] young you don't belong here
[1:30:58] and he's just following the instructions
[1:30:59] of his father he was serving in the body
[1:31:02] you're just fine you just start serving
[1:31:04] in the body start serving in your family
[1:31:05] he was serving his father serving your
[1:31:08] servant your family serving church and
[1:31:10] you'll find that god will put you on a
[1:31:11] path to give you victory
[1:31:13] just like david and then so he walks
[1:31:15] there and you know what i love is that
[1:31:17] the devil's boasts come to an end
[1:31:20] the devil has an expiry date his boats
[1:31:22] have an expiry date his threats have an
[1:31:24] expiry date they come to an end
[1:31:27] so
[1:31:28] goliath he didn't realize but that was
[1:31:30] the last morning he was going to get up
[1:31:32] that was the last morning he was going
[1:31:34] to have breakfast last morning his
[1:31:36] arrogant thoughts would pass through his
[1:31:37] mind about how great he was and you know
[1:31:39] the last morning he'd probably flex the
[1:31:41] mirror saying i'm undefeatable
[1:31:43] and the devil's been flexing his muscles
[1:31:45] for a very long time nothing can defeat
[1:31:47] me nothing can defeat me i'm going to
[1:31:49] win you know and then so he puts on his
[1:31:51] armor has his breakfast for the last
[1:31:52] time shield bearer carries his shield
[1:31:55] before him and he makes his boats for
[1:31:56] the last time
[1:31:59] because what had happened is
[1:32:00] you know history repeats itself
[1:32:04] the same god that defeated that cast
[1:32:06] satan out of heaven
[1:32:08] he didn't just cast satan out of heaven
[1:32:10] upon the earth this is in revelation 12
[1:32:12] and he didn't just stay up in heaven
[1:32:14] after he cast the devil down
[1:32:16] our god pursues his pray
[1:32:18] our god pursues his pray he's a mighty
[1:32:20] hunter
[1:32:21] right so so the devil was cast out upon
[1:32:23] the earth and god chased him down upon
[1:32:25] the earth
[1:32:26] hallelujah and down through down through
[1:32:28] history god has been veiled within human
[1:32:31] flesh
[1:32:32] and the same look that was on michael's
[1:32:34] eyes when satan was cast out because
[1:32:36] michael and his angels fought against
[1:32:37] the dragon and his angels are you all
[1:32:39] with me that same look that's that satan
[1:32:41] saw in heaven it's not just an angelic
[1:32:44] form anymore it's now in human flesh
[1:32:48] the same look
[1:32:49] because the same god is vowel behind
[1:32:51] human flesh
[1:32:52] and so david now he was anointed by the
[1:32:54] prophet samuel it says the spirit of god
[1:32:56] was with him from that day on so he had
[1:32:58] a different kind of look about him he
[1:33:00] was still a little young boy and you
[1:33:02] know full of young boy kind of things
[1:33:04] but god was with him
[1:33:06] hallelujah he had a different kind of
[1:33:07] look because now it wasn't just him
[1:33:09] living it was god living it wasn't just
[1:33:11] david doing his thing god was doing his
[1:33:12] thing hallelujah so you know david david
[1:33:16] will walk out there before goliath
[1:33:19] and maybe the devil would look and say
[1:33:21] i've seen that look before
[1:33:23] i saw it in noah's eyes
[1:33:25] i saw it in enoch's eyes
[1:33:27] i saw it in abraham's eyes i saw it in
[1:33:30] moses's eyes because every time there's
[1:33:32] a clash it's not you and the devil
[1:33:34] clashing it's god and the devil clashing
[1:33:36] right it's god and you against the devil
[1:33:39] hallelujah says not you trying to defeat
[1:33:41] the devil outsmart him and that's what
[1:33:42] man has been trying to do especially in
[1:33:44] this age how can we outsmart the devil
[1:33:46] so we get to heaven
[1:33:47] that's nonsense no you can never
[1:33:49] outsmart him he's far smarter than you
[1:33:51] you've just got to be surrendered to god
[1:33:53] and let him live in your life get sealed
[1:33:55] into the kingdom by the baptism of the
[1:33:57] holy ghost that's how you outsmart the
[1:33:58] devil i mean so goliath looked into
[1:34:01] david's eyes and just mocked them saying
[1:34:03] am i dog you've come to chase me away
[1:34:04] with sticks and stones and different
[1:34:06] things but i think the devil said i've
[1:34:07] seen that look before
[1:34:10] and then so david began to prophesy
[1:34:13] i'm gonna i'm gonna cut your head off
[1:34:15] feed your body to the birds and then he
[1:34:17] says i'm going to kill all of you as
[1:34:18] well
[1:34:19] hallelujah and he picked up five stones
[1:34:21] because goliath had brothers and that
[1:34:23] should be the kind of grit that a
[1:34:24] believer has if i've got to take down
[1:34:26] everyone i will take down one at a time
[1:34:28] there's not too many one with god is a
[1:34:30] majority one with god it doesn't take a
[1:34:33] whole group it takes one person's fully
[1:34:35] surrendered to the hands of god and the
[1:34:37] whole world could be turned upside down
[1:34:39] you say that's too far-fetched no moses
[1:34:42] was one man
[1:34:43] under the blood of bulls and goats he
[1:34:45] went down to egypt as an 80 year old man
[1:34:47] one man invasion
[1:34:49] maybe maybe he went through the customs
[1:34:50] office what's your purpose a visit visit
[1:34:53] no business kind of
[1:34:56] visiting relatives yes other and he
[1:34:59] wrote invasion
[1:35:00] or deliverance or rescue mission
[1:35:02] and you know the customs guy would have
[1:35:04] just looked and said crazy old man stamp
[1:35:05] stamp you know but the thing is
[1:35:08] he did it
[1:35:09] he did it
[1:35:11] hallelujah he walked in there said let
[1:35:12] my people go and it wasn't him speaking
[1:35:15] because it wasn't his peoples god's
[1:35:17] people god was speaking first person
[1:35:19] through a man let my people go
[1:35:21] hallelujah and the reason that god god
[1:35:24] actually hardened the heart of pharaoh
[1:35:26] because god wanted moses and the
[1:35:28] israelites to see this is really the god
[1:35:30] you serve
[1:35:31] i'll show you my power that there may be
[1:35:33] a lot of pressure because remember after
[1:35:35] moses went in the first time pharaoh
[1:35:37] said you you know we're not going to
[1:35:38] give you straw anymore to make bricks
[1:35:39] you've got to go the work became harder
[1:35:41] the pressure became greater
[1:35:43] but god isn't afraid of pressure
[1:35:46] he wants to reveal himself in you
[1:35:48] hallelujah it takes pressure
[1:35:50] praise god
[1:35:51] but remember it's not just god doesn't
[1:35:54] just put us in this age to see us just
[1:35:55] wilt and be crushed
[1:35:57] that's not his purpose the devil's just
[1:35:59] saying i'm going to destroy you but you
[1:36:01] say no no my god said i'm going to live
[1:36:03] i'm an overcomer
[1:36:05] hallelujah it doesn't matter my physical
[1:36:06] state it's not we don't have confidence
[1:36:08] in this guy
[1:36:10] right we have confidence in almighty god
[1:36:12] it's the
[1:36:13] it's the sea gene of god on the inside
[1:36:15] of our soul that god has confidence in
[1:36:18] right and we but we're going to trust
[1:36:19] not in the arm of flesh but in the
[1:36:20] spirit of god i mean so moses said let
[1:36:23] my people go you all know the rest of
[1:36:25] the story what happened the devil was
[1:36:27] defeated and israel came out of egypt no
[1:36:29] matter what pressure came on hardship
[1:36:31] came on i mean why because you know it
[1:36:33] was god the devil was in pharaoh
[1:36:36] right
[1:36:37] and remember the cobra was this was a
[1:36:40] symbol was what was pharaoh's symbol
[1:36:43] as as the king of the snakes king of the
[1:36:45] serpents right so the reason that moses
[1:36:48] was told by god
[1:36:50] to throw down his rod it turned into a
[1:36:51] snake and then pick it up and turn into
[1:36:53] a rod is that god wanted moses to know
[1:36:56] because god knew that he could bind and
[1:36:57] loose the devil any way he wants to
[1:37:00] but he wanted moses to realize this
[1:37:02] power has been placed in your hand
[1:37:05] it's placed in your hand you have it you
[1:37:07] don't have to obtain it it's already in
[1:37:09] you i mean that's why i'm commissioning
[1:37:11] you at the burning bush right here is
[1:37:13] that you would know this power's within
[1:37:15] you now i mean we've had our burning
[1:37:18] bush experience hallelujah trust you've
[1:37:20] met god you've really met that pillar of
[1:37:22] fire and he's transformed your life what
[1:37:24] are you doing he's telling you what you
[1:37:26] have remember he said
[1:37:27] what's in your hand and moses is
[1:37:30] carrying the stick that he's maybe been
[1:37:31] carrying for i know how many years maybe
[1:37:33] shaped it a certain way he knows exactly
[1:37:36] his favorite grip and so on and he's
[1:37:38] been carrying this stick
[1:37:40] and he doesn't realize that this is
[1:37:41] god's deliverance rod
[1:37:43] that's going to open the red sea bring
[1:37:45] all the plagues it's not only going to
[1:37:47] do that it's when it's when he casts it
[1:37:49] to you know before pharaoh's feet and
[1:37:52] the and the magicians do the same kind
[1:37:54] of thing that his stick his snake is
[1:37:56] going to swallow them up
[1:37:58] so it doesn't matter what enchantment
[1:38:00] the devil tries you to hold you because
[1:38:02] remember the whole purpose of janice and
[1:38:03] jamers was to hold the people in egypt
[1:38:05] but we are not holdable
[1:38:07] we cannot be kept in this world we
[1:38:09] cannot be kept by any spirit of liar
[1:38:11] whatever the devil can do we cannot be
[1:38:13] held down we have another inheritance to
[1:38:15] go to and it's not egypt
[1:38:18] hallelujah i mean so so say god was
[1:38:21] actually telling satan through moses i
[1:38:24] can bind you
[1:38:25] i can lose you so i can loose you as in
[1:38:27] put down the right turns into a snake
[1:38:29] and then pick it up and bind and becomes
[1:38:31] a staff again
[1:38:33] anytime i want to i can bind you i can
[1:38:35] loose you
[1:38:36] hallelujah but that so that power
[1:38:38] actually lays within you and i yes
[1:38:40] remember that was a man under the blood
[1:38:42] of bulls and goats amen that that blood
[1:38:45] could not change its nature
[1:38:47] it could not actually allow that god
[1:38:48] would be fully in dwell him like under
[1:38:50] the blood of jesus christ but yet he did
[1:38:52] incredible miracles god led him to do
[1:38:54] incredible things
[1:38:56] hallelujah to bring god's people out
[1:39:00] now if a man under the blood of bulls
[1:39:02] and goats can turn the knoll red do do
[1:39:04] do whatever he needs to do as god leads
[1:39:06] him to bring a deliverance how about
[1:39:08] those under the blood of jesus christ
[1:39:10] yeah yeah brother braham says in one
[1:39:12] place now we could really have a service
[1:39:14] you know if you just look at that one
[1:39:16] fact what could a people do under the
[1:39:18] blood of jesus christ where they're not
[1:39:20] just anointed by the spirit of god but
[1:39:22] god dwells in them 24 7.
[1:39:24] hallelujah i don't need to turn the hutt
[1:39:26] valley uh river into blood
[1:39:30] i don't need to part the sea and walk
[1:39:31] over to the south island
[1:39:33] i don't need to bring frogs
[1:39:36] but
[1:39:36] there's things we need
[1:39:38] we need deliverance we need salvation we
[1:39:41] need prodigals to come home we need
[1:39:43] healing we need peace i mean we need joy
[1:39:46] hallelujah we need you know there's a
[1:39:48] lot of things we need but the thing is
[1:39:50] it's in our hand
[1:39:52] it's in our hand because brother ram
[1:39:54] says that the staff that was in moses
[1:39:55] hand was the name of jesus christ in the
[1:39:57] church
[1:39:59] but he didn't fully he didn't fully
[1:40:01] realize what he was carrying
[1:40:03] until the pressure came on and god told
[1:40:05] him to do certain things
[1:40:06] he just thought it was to guide sheep
[1:40:08] it's so much more than that you know
[1:40:11] if i put it this way it's like prayer
[1:40:13] prayer is so much greater than asking
[1:40:15] god to bless one another or help us in
[1:40:18] our jobs those things are all fine we
[1:40:20] need him to i i want to be blessed by
[1:40:21] god who wants to be blessed i need him
[1:40:23] to help me in my job
[1:40:25] right but but prayer is so much greater
[1:40:27] than that i think we shouldn't limit god
[1:40:29] on what we can pray for we say lord lead
[1:40:31] me
[1:40:33] into everything amen that i can pray for
[1:40:35] anything as you lead me into it you know
[1:40:38] because some people think well i can't
[1:40:40] ask god for that well
[1:40:41] you know who said
[1:40:44] you know
[1:40:46] it's like brother cadre digs now no i'm
[1:40:47] not preaching prosperity things but you
[1:40:49] know he's an evangelist from america and
[1:40:51] we were we were here um we were we were
[1:40:54] we were in in in wellington there's some
[1:40:57] big fancy car there and you know he just
[1:40:59] said to me you know you know brother ben
[1:41:02] god could give you that car
[1:41:04] and he could
[1:41:06] i'm not a car guy but
[1:41:08] but
[1:41:09] you know he could do that
[1:41:11] but in my subconscious i think no god
[1:41:13] wouldn't do that but what if he wanted
[1:41:15] to
[1:41:16] right am i limiting god
[1:41:19] by not by just thinking no god wouldn't
[1:41:21] do that for me
[1:41:22] you know it's like we can get to a stage
[1:41:24] where you know we see loved ones tarry
[1:41:27] too long out in the world
[1:41:29] i think well god can't give them back
[1:41:30] who said don't don't don't
[1:41:32] subconsciously limit god amen it doesn't
[1:41:34] matter where they go how deep they go we
[1:41:36] were in dark places
[1:41:38] i was like legion in the tombs
[1:41:41] i was separating myself
[1:41:43] computer games
[1:41:45] drinking all kinds of stuff just just
[1:41:47] totally iceland just basically
[1:41:48] associated with death
[1:41:50] but then he called me out
[1:41:52] hallelujah and i just came to a
[1:41:54] conclusion if god can save me hey he can
[1:41:56] do anything
[1:41:58] he can save anyone hallelujah it doesn't
[1:42:00] matter where they are who they are what
[1:42:02] they've done god can save anyone
[1:42:05] hallelujah so now david david he
[1:42:08] prophesied of of goliath's end
[1:42:10] and he prophesied at the end of the
[1:42:12] philistines and he actually said i'll
[1:42:13] just kill you all
[1:42:14] this is paraphrasing you gotta read it
[1:42:16] first samuel

[1:43:07] predetermined to be the placing of sons
[1:43:10] hallelujah that's actually our destiny
[1:43:13] that's our path that god has put us on i
[1:43:15] was on a very dark path but then god

[1:43:18] inheritance you're not ordained to walk
[1:43:20] in darkness i want you to walk in light
[1:43:23] and i have a predestinated destination
[1:43:26] that you're going to turn up into and i
[1:43:28] just surrender myself to that that's a
[1:43:29] good thing isn't it

[1:43:43] dictionary
[1:43:44] it has a lot of uh
[1:43:46] definitions

[1:44:19] beginning she shall be right now
[1:44:21] hallelujah you know what i love about
[1:44:23] them in the book of acts nothing could
[1:44:25] stop them

[1:44:30] hallelujah they told stephen don't
[1:44:32] preach anymore he just continued on they
[1:44:34] stoned him you think they could have put
[1:44:35] that fire out they put pressure on the
[1:44:38] disciples do you think they could have
[1:44:39] put that fire out no it's like a
[1:44:41] it's like a house on fire on a windy day
[1:44:44] that's how they were and the more the
[1:44:46] pressure came down the more god lived in
[1:44:48] their lives and when the pressure came
[1:44:50] down they weren't intimidated by it they
[1:44:52] said no we need to have a prayer meeting
[1:44:54] we're not going to let this linger
[1:44:56] because the devil just wants to disable
[1:44:57] our walk no no we're not here to be
[1:44:59] disabled we're here to overcome so you
[1:45:02] may feel yourself on the you just pull

[1:45:15] came down shook the place and filled
[1:45:18] them with boldness in order to overcome
[1:45:20] what the devil just tried to put upon
[1:45:21] them hallelujah because they knew what

[1:45:26] hallelujah and we should know that's our
[1:45:27] source of strength amen here's our

[1:45:42] on the church and you know the believers
[1:45:44] just got scattered everywhere preaching
[1:45:45] the gospel
[1:45:46] so they didn't stop and say i've got to
[1:45:48] run for my life and not talk about this
[1:45:49] anymore no it was burning in their souls
[1:45:51] hallelujah so their whole world was
[1:45:54] shaken but god allowed it for the for
[1:45:56] the message to be spread
[1:45:58] so everything that happens in this world
[1:46:00] right now god is allowing
[1:46:02] that his purpose would be manifested
[1:46:04] amen so we don't need to worry about it

[1:49:48] the king of glory the supreme judge
[1:49:51] he is your legal team hallelujah and
[1:49:53] he's not just your attorney your lawyer
[1:49:55] he's your judge hallelujah and the case
[1:49:57] has been settled why because he took
[1:50:00] your the judgment we should have taken
[1:50:02] he took that down calvary that we don't
[1:50:04] go to judgment
[1:50:06] hallelujah so sometimes we're getting a
[1:50:08] fix how we ever going to get out of this
[1:50:09] mess you got to think now who's my legal
[1:50:12] team
[1:50:13] hallelujah who's working on my behalf
[1:50:15] when i cannot save myself i cannot guide
[1:50:18] myself who is guiding me remember the
[1:50:20] sons of god led by the spirit of god
[1:50:22] i mean who's leading me in life who's
[1:50:24] actually watching over me you know when
[1:50:26] the enemy comes in like a flood the lord
[1:50:28] says i'll raise up a standard which is
[1:50:30] god's word being anointed in the hearts
[1:50:32] and lives of men and women that god
[1:50:34] manifests himself into people we're
[1:50:36] going to realize we're anointed
[1:50:38] every day we're anointed by the holy
[1:50:40] ghost
[1:50:41] right because every day we're walking
[1:50:42] and satan's eaten
[1:50:44] hallelujah
[1:50:46] this is the this is the darkest age he's
[1:50:47] ever been upon the earth
[1:50:49] right but yet we're a people and by
[1:50:52] god's supreme grace we're just walking
[1:50:54] on saying i'm marching to zion
[1:50:57] we're not worried about the devil's
[1:50:59] shiny things that may it may distract us
[1:51:02] for a little bit but we just something
[1:51:03] else was says no no that's not for you
[1:51:06] you've got a hired holy calling
[1:51:08] hallelujah you've got a far better thing
[1:51:10] than what this world can give you know i
[1:51:12] would rather have the date the worst day
[1:51:15] uh i can't remember who said it but
[1:51:17] maybe it was the prophet i came in but
[1:51:18] you know
[1:51:19] the believer would rather yo
[1:51:22] you put into scales the greatest day the
[1:51:24] world could give you
[1:51:25] and compare it to the very worst day
[1:51:27] that a believer could have
[1:51:29] and the believer says i'd rather have
[1:51:31] the worst day ever as a christian
[1:51:34] than the best day the will could ever
[1:51:36] give me
[1:51:38] hallelujah
[1:51:39] because one
[1:51:41] doesn't have eternal life
[1:51:43] this this walk is far bigger
[1:51:46] being a son and daughter of god is far
[1:51:47] bigger than what our five senses declare
[1:51:51] right people people care about material
[1:51:54] things you know who cares about it
[1:51:57] our adherence is
[1:51:58] is in heaven
[1:52:01] hallelujah we have a home beyond the
[1:52:03] river
[1:52:04] and but we can enjoy life here too
[1:52:06] in a godly way right but you know we can
[1:52:09] enjoy but you know
[1:52:11] we i'll just wrap it up i'll say we are
[1:52:14] living in the season i'm just echoing
[1:52:16] what brother isaac said we're living in
[1:52:18] the season of the adoption of the sons
[1:52:20] and daughters of god
[1:52:22] and i pray just like when he looked into
[1:52:24] moses's eyes he said i've seen that look
[1:52:26] before he looked into elijah's eyes the
[1:52:28] devil dude i've seen that look before he
[1:52:30] looked into jesus he's certainly seen
[1:52:32] that look before because the fullness of
[1:52:33] god encountered in a body i pray when he
[1:52:36] looks into your eyes says i've seen that
[1:52:38] look before i've seen that same god and
[1:52:40] he says now i have trouble
[1:52:43] and he tries to put pressure on us tries
[1:52:45] to
[1:52:46] derail our walk but the more pressure he
[1:52:48] puts on the more god is expressed
[1:52:51] holy just like beethoven the more he
[1:52:52] lost his hearing the greater the music
[1:52:54] came forth amos it should be the same
[1:52:56] thing with you and i the more pressure
[1:52:58] and trials come on the more god is
[1:53:00] expressed because remember the squeeze
[1:53:02] does not perfect the believer
[1:53:05] the squeeze just brings out what's
[1:53:08] already in them
[1:53:10] hallelujah it doesn't it doesn't raise
[1:53:12] our faith that now we have overcoming
[1:53:14] power you you take a lemon you squeeze a
[1:53:17] lemon you just bring out what's within
[1:53:19] it or an orange or anything you squeeze
[1:53:21] it it comes out so the squeeze that
[1:53:23] we're now in and it will get worse right
[1:53:26] in a religious way
[1:53:28] it just brings out what's within us
[1:53:30] already
[1:53:32] because remember god has to prove to us
[1:53:35] who we are
[1:53:36] it's not just him revealing to us who he
[1:53:38] is he wants to show us who we are
[1:53:42] hallelujah you know brother brown gave
[1:53:44] the illustration of as the eagle stirs
[1:53:46] the nest
[1:53:47] it says about mama eagle you know there
[1:53:48] came comes a time when when when she
[1:53:51] looks down at her babies and sees
[1:53:53] they're ready to fly they're ready to
[1:53:55] fly and you know before that you know
[1:53:58] she would go
[1:53:59] kill something you know bring it to the
[1:54:00] nest and you know
[1:54:02] spread her big wings you know you know
[1:54:04] above the little babies and they'd look
[1:54:06] up and say mama you're so powerful
[1:54:08] you're so incredible but they don't
[1:54:10] realize
[1:54:12] they are like mama
[1:54:13] the same life and mama is the same life
[1:54:16] in them but now mama comes to a stage
[1:54:18] where she looks down at her baby says
[1:54:20] children well she thinks that children
[1:54:22] you don't realize but i'm going to
[1:54:24] reveal to you what's within you
[1:54:26] because remember all they know is than
[1:54:27] this they've been hopping around and you
[1:54:28] know but there comes a time where she
[1:54:30] takes out all the all the skins of the
[1:54:32] animals all the soft parts of the nest
[1:54:33] makes it all uncomfortable
[1:54:35] and then there comes a stage where she
[1:54:37] takes them up and basically throws them
[1:54:39] out of the nest
[1:54:41] because they've seen her fly
[1:54:44] but now they've got to see they can fly
[1:54:46] they can see she's built to fly but they
[1:54:49] need to see their belt to fly and that's
[1:54:51] why that's why a great jehovah god has
[1:54:53] been stirring the nest
[1:54:55] hallelujah because he wants you to see
[1:54:57] you're made of the same material i am
[1:55:00] hallelujah you're part of me i mean my
[1:55:03] traits are in you
[1:55:04] hallelujah it's not different it's the
[1:55:06] same traits
[1:55:08] the same god we'll do the same works
[1:55:10] amen manifest the same power and he
[1:55:13] right now is i mean doing the same works
[1:55:15] you can look at your life look at the
[1:55:16] testimonies that's the same god that you
[1:55:18] read about in the book of acts that's
[1:55:20] the same things in your life and he's
[1:55:22] been doing those things to show you i'm
[1:55:24] with you
[1:55:25] you're made of the same stuff i am
[1:55:27] hallelujah because why you're sons and
[1:55:30] daughters of god so don't fear this
[1:55:32] world don't be anxious for nothing god
[1:55:35] has your life in his hands i mean this
[1:55:37] is not just some fatalistic idea of what
[1:55:39] will be will be no no you press the
[1:55:40] battle
[1:55:42] amen we are here for a purpose and if
[1:55:44] that if my purpose is just for one soul
[1:55:47] praise god amen hallelujah just to be a
[1:55:49] witness amen if that's my purpose i want
[1:55:51] to be the best witness i can may the
[1:55:54] life i live just be so salty you know i
[1:55:56] think your sister know me sit at our
[1:55:57] table say yo salt brings out the best
[1:56:00] and what it makes contact with
[1:56:03] are we salty
[1:56:05] i trust our lives bring the best out of
[1:56:06] everybody
[1:56:08] amen
[1:56:10] i'll leave it there this morning but
[1:56:11] this is the season it's not us trying to
[1:56:13] get into a position clear the musicians
[1:56:15] please this morning but it's not it's
[1:56:17] not us trying to get into a position of
[1:56:19] sonship it's no god saying i'm going to

[1:56:24] you all these years

[1:56:34] him

[1:56:39] to face the greatest force he's ever
[1:56:41] come against
[1:56:43] amen since jesus because that same jesus
[1:56:45] and you and i it's not a lesser jesus
[1:56:47] brother brahm said that jesus is the
[1:56:49] messiah the anointed one he says we are
[1:56:51] little anointed ones
[1:56:52] messiahs because the same holy ghost
[1:56:55] that was within him as in you and i it's
[1:56:56] not a lesser holy ghost it's not unless
[1:56:58] a god is the same god
[1:57:00] amen and he'll do the same things he has
[1:57:02] done the same things who's seen miracles
[1:57:04] who's seen healing who's seen demons
[1:57:06] cast out hallelujah who's seen those
[1:57:09] things it's the same god doing the same
[1:57:10] things
[1:57:12] amen
[1:57:13] but you know his brother caidra i said
[1:57:15] brother um isaac was alluding to it he
[1:57:17] said you got to speak your outcome
[1:57:20] just like david said to goliath i'm
[1:57:21] going to cut your head off he didn't
[1:57:22] have a sword but you know the devil
[1:57:24] brings his own weaponry to kill himself
[1:57:26] you know he said i'm going to cut your
[1:57:28] head off and i'm going to take out these
[1:57:29] ones if i have to
[1:57:32] he prophesied the future oh yeah the
[1:57:33] devil's future
[1:57:36] so you know david could have stood there
[1:57:37] and said oh yeah i guess i shouldn't be
[1:57:39] here maybe i'm just a little kid
[1:57:40] boasting you know i have no right to
[1:57:42] come out no no he says my god is you
[1:57:44] have defied my god
[1:57:46] and i'm gonna let my god kill you
[1:57:48] through me
[1:57:49] hallelujah
[1:57:50] so we should just step up to the battle
[1:57:52] don't be afraid of nothing
[1:57:54] now we are the sons and daughters of god
[1:57:57] right now
[1:57:58] oh but i've got all these failures and
[1:58:00] things don't look at them look at your
[1:58:01] lamb
[1:58:03] look at your lamb
[1:58:04] if we look at right here and now we can
[1:58:06] be discouraged but we're looking to the
[1:58:07] end
[1:58:08] right he's called us he's going to get
[1:58:10] us there how's he going to do it i don't
[1:58:12] know
[1:58:13] how did he call me i can't really you
[1:58:15] know i can say what happened but really
[1:58:16] what happened is different to how i say
[1:58:19] it happen you know it's very hard to
[1:58:20] describe when god meets you
[1:58:22] you know the you're the magnitude of it
[1:58:24] what what what really happened you say
[1:58:26] oh i heard a voice i heard a sermon i
[1:58:27] heard this but what really happened
[1:58:29] because a lot of people heard those same
[1:58:30] words but didn't call them the same way
[1:58:33] amen but we are living in the season now
[1:58:36] we are the sons and daughters of god
[1:58:38] i pray that you look yourself in the
[1:58:39] mirror and say i'm a son of son or
[1:58:41] daughter of god
[1:58:43] because he has made me this amen you say
[1:58:45] well that's being proud no if he made me
[1:58:47] something this it's just him
[1:58:49] we have nothing to glorify and of
[1:58:50] ourselves
[1:58:52] why does god you know the reason god
[1:58:54] lives in our midst is not that we would
[1:58:56] be anything is that he would be
[1:58:57] glorified
