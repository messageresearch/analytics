[43:10] ministers come in to sell books and
[43:11] everything no matter what it is there's
[43:13] other places to do that so we shouldn't
[43:15] buy or sell in the house of Our Lord so
[43:17] he's talking about the sanctuary here it
[43:19] should be U so it should be a place of
[43:21] worship holy consecrated to that purpose
[43:24] he's give us a nice place and I say Amen
[43:27] amen amen let's dedicate it to him and
[43:29] dedicate
[43:30] ourselves um uh with it to him and now
[43:34] this may seem a little rude but it's not
[43:37] a place to visit it's a place of worship
[43:40] we should never even murmur a word
[43:42] inside of here outside of worship to one
[43:44] another unless it's absolutely necessary
[43:46] see we should never rally around we
[43:49] should never run around run through the
[43:51] run through the building or let our
[43:52] children run through the building and so
[43:54] doing this I feel not long ago doing
[43:56] this we constructed it that that we can
[43:59] take care of it all that way now this is
[44:01] not built that way this is not separate
[44:03] but this is still the sanctuary amen so
[44:07] we need to treat it as a sanctuary
[44:10] because as I read down a little while
[44:12] there's because brother B he lays out a
[44:14] pattern he's not just setting up some
[44:16] rules he's laying out a pattern this is
[44:18] how church should be and there's a
[44:20] reason we have things a certain ways
[44:21] because we want God to come down amen
[44:24] amen because we can please him or we can
[44:26] displease him
[44:28] you know so we want to now we know this
[44:30] is not separated off but you know just
[44:32] just keep that in mind but we're going
[44:34] to do the best we can now therefore
[44:35] dedicating ourselves let's remember when
[44:37] we enter the sanctuary keep still one to
[44:40] another and worship God if you want to
[44:42] visit each other there's places you may
[44:44] visit each other uh like that but we're
[44:47] never walking around where you can't
[44:49] hear yourself think and some people come
[44:50] in they just don't know what to do see
[44:52] it's too much noise and things and it's
[44:54] just humanly he says and I've seen it in
[44:57] churches until it makes me feel bad
[44:59] because we do not come into the
[45:00] sanctuary of the Lord to meet each other
[45:03] we come here to worship God and then we
[45:05] go to our homes this sanctu is dedicated
[45:07] to worship he says when stand outside
[45:10] talk anything you wish to as long as
[45:11] it's right and holy go to one another's
[45:14] houses visit one another in places but
[45:16] when you enter that door be quiet you
[45:18] come here to talk to himy and let them
[45:21] talk back to you the trouble of it is we
[45:23] do too much talking and we don't listen
[45:25] enough then when we come in here wait on
[45:29] him and he says and he says now there's
[45:32] little children babies he says they
[45:33] don't know any different and the only
[45:35] way they can get things is is to cry for
[45:38] it so we've got the babies room as you
[45:40] know and he says um now and he says
[45:43] about children and things crying says
[45:45] now it's never bothers me here in the
[45:47] Pulpit maybe I don't even notice it
[45:50] being anointed now I don't notice it but
[45:52] if you're sitting in the congregation
[45:53] you notice everything that's what I
[45:55] found so it doesn't bother me but it can
[45:58] bother it can bother the people around
[46:00] you and you can even see the devil you
[46:03] know we come to church this is the house
[46:05] of God devil the devil's here I
[46:08] guarantee you that much Satan is Among
[46:10] Us shouldn't be a surprise to you he was
[46:13] in
[46:14] Eden that was God's you know God said
[46:16] your your brother and said in the call
[46:18] of the evening God would come down the
[46:19] great big cathedrals of the trees Satan
[46:22] was there and Satan will try and Rob you
[46:25] cuz he's cuz he's here to oppose you to
[46:28] stop you getting what you need and he'll
[46:31] use anything he can he'll use a child
[46:34] you know he'll he'll he'll make you
[46:36] think I really need to go to the toilet
[46:39] and you go and you may miss a
[46:41] blessing amen oh you I need to go to
[46:44] toilet yo you children don't don't if
[46:47] you feel need to go to the toilet the
[46:48] service will be over you can hold on if
[46:51] you really no no no hey if you really
[46:53] need to go go but as soon as the answers
[46:55] your mind I need to go toilet just hold
[46:56] hold on if you can I bet you you can I
[47:00] remember sitting through movies 3 hours
[47:02] long I did not want to leave the cinema
[47:04] what's going to happen and you feel so
[47:06] robbed I don't want to let something's
[47:07] just a I can't go out because you're so
[47:10] gripped by what's going on true that's
[47:12] just entertainment what about where God
[47:14] is amen amen it depends what you know
[47:18] there's people as young as five have
[47:19] receiv received the Holy Ghost yes sir
[47:21] brother Tim pro he he says he gave his
[47:24] heart to the Lord at five and he never
[47:25] took it back 5 years old and I'm more
[47:28] than one 5ye old amen and there's many
[47:31] older than five here so don't think
[47:33] you're too young or you don't understand
[47:36] God's here that's right amen amen if he
[47:39] talks to your heart just give yourself
[47:41] to him amen that's right so if we have
[47:43] children you know if you're CH you know
[47:45] I've got young children too so I'm not
[47:46] you know I'm probably in this bracket
[47:48] the most but children are making a noise
[47:51] take them around the side here you can
[47:54] still hear the service but just think of
[47:56] you know what one another and so now he
[47:59] says and then many time teenage children
[48:02] and sometimes adults will get to you
[48:04] know young people will pass notes or cut
[48:06] up or something in church while you're
[48:08] old enough to know better than that see
[48:09] you should know better than that you
[48:11] shouldn't come here if you expect to be
[48:13] a real man someday to raise a family to
[48:15] the kingdom of God then start off in the
[48:17] beginning you see act right and do
[48:20] right and now then I've seen churches
[48:22] though to where children were permitted
[48:24] to run all over the sanctuary and that
[48:26] adults stand and holler across the room
[48:28] one to another now I'll just say
[48:31] this it is such a blessing that we have
[48:34] total Harmony between one another and
[48:36] it's virtually impossible just have a
[48:37] quick visit I found that you just can't
[48:40] have a quick visit you start talking and
[48:41] you have you enjoy one another this
[48:43] company you know but this is a place of
[48:47] worship okay and he says here now so
[48:50] after that St he says that's a good way
[48:53] this is what really hit me when I heard
[48:54] this that's a good way to ruin the ser
[48:57] coming that night or whatever time it is
[48:59] see to run around the church hollower
[49:01] one to another across the sanctu he says
[49:02] there a good way to ruin the services
[49:04] coming up and to me that's why you know
[49:08] what he and he says as soon as the
[49:09] service is dismissed leave the
[49:11] auditorium now that's if you're not so
[49:13] if you want to stay and pray stay and
[49:15] pray but if you finish praying just go
[49:18] out the back you know we have our black
[49:19] line there on the on the carpet just
[49:22] take the fellowship go just go out
[49:24] around the back or out the front or into
[49:25] the kitchen you know
[49:27] we know we don't have a lot of room we
[49:28] don't have a fellowship hall but we
[49:29] still got room okay so let's try and
[49:32] keep everything beyond the black line
[49:34] when it comes to Fellowship okay because
[49:37] I for one do not want to ruin the
[49:39] service coming up amen you know and we
[49:42] have we have brother brother kuin our
[49:44] Deacon you know it's his role as as I'm
[49:47] just reminding you as he knows he's the
[49:49] policeman of the church he keeps the
[49:51] order it doesn't matter who speak it
[49:53] could be me having some fellowship here
[49:55] if he says hey take it out the back
[49:57] I say yes brother cuz that's his role
[50:01] amen and it's important because this is
[50:02] a house of worship now don't feel all
[50:04] bound down all this is all stricted no
[50:06] it's not we want to do this to please
[50:07] the Lord amen okay we have you our
[50:10] houses across the road we have we can go
[50:12] have Fellowship you know amen so you
[50:15] know we we we have the we don't have a
[50:17] wall one day we will if not we'll move
[50:20] somewhere else you know but let's just
[50:22] try and keep this as we I know you're
[50:24] sincere I know you all love the Lord but
[50:26] you know we just got to it's so easy to
[50:28] go back to other ways just have
[50:30] Fellowship you know and here and forget
[50:31] the you know how it should be is that
[50:34] all right amen amen amen and then so
[50:37] yeah so um I'll keep reminding the
[50:40] landlord about the wall cuz we have the
[50:41] ability we have the funds we can put it
[50:43] up but we're just waiting on him so so
[50:47] with all that in mind let's just stand
[50:49] and let's just sing uh in Heavenly armor
[50:51] into the land The Battle Belongs to the
[50:53] Lord as we just turn to the
[50:55] word amen amen God bless you friends God
[50:58] bless remember Jesus God just sorry
[51:02] before we sing this I want just remember
[51:05] the Lord typed himself as a lamb and a
[51:07] and as a dove in the scripture behold
[51:10] here comes the Lamb of God that takes
[51:11] away the sin of the world and the spirit
[51:12] of God descended upon him like a dove
[51:14] when he got baptized River Jordan the
[51:16] Reason God showed himself that way is
[51:18] that's the nature of the spirit of God
[51:21] he's Mighty in battle but you don't want
[51:23] to you know it's easy to scare a dove or
[51:26] a lamb they're skittish things so he's
[51:30] saying you got to have one you've got to
[51:32] got to have a lamb nature in your in
[51:34] your heart for him to descend upon you
[51:36] but we don't want to create a way that
[51:37] Grieves him and he flies away CU
[51:39] remember God is not a respector of
[51:41] persons well we're the bride he's not a
[51:43] respector of persons that's right you
[51:45] know he gives us Grace To Live his word

[56:19] of bar of Samson of Jeffy of David also
[56:23] and Samuel and of the prophets who
[56:25] through faith subdued kingdoms wrought
[56:27] righteousness obtained promises stopped
[56:29] the mouth of lions quenched the violence
[56:32] of fire escaped the edge of the sword
[56:34] out of weakness were made strong wax
[56:37] Valiant in the fight turned the flight
[56:39] the army of the aliens women received
[56:41] their dead raised to life again others
[56:44] were tortured not accepting Deliverance
[56:46] that they might obtain a better
[56:47] Resurrection others had a trial pardon
[56:50] me of cruel mockings and scorings Y
[56:52] moreover of bonds and imprisonment they
[56:55] were sto stoned they were Sor aund they
[56:57] were tempted they were slain with the
[56:59] sword they wandered about and sheep
[57:01] skins and goat skins being destitute
[57:03] Afflicted tormented of whom the world
[57:05] was not worthy they wandered in deserts
[57:07] and in mountains and in dens and in
[57:09] caves of the earth and these all having
[57:11] obtained a good report through faith
[57:13] received not the promise God having
[57:15] provided some better thing for us that
[57:17] they without us should not be made
[57:19] perfect wherefore seeing we also en camp
[57:23] and compassed about with so great a
[57:25] cloud of Witnesses let us lay aside
[57:28] every weight and the sin that does so
[57:30] easily beset us and let us run with
[57:33] patience the race that is set before us
[57:35] looking unto Jesus the author and
[57:37] finisher of our faith who for the joy
[57:39] that was set before him endured the
[57:41] cross despising the shame and is sit
[57:43] down at the right hand of the Throne of
[57:46] God Amen let's go to Isaiah

[57:54] is one of my favorite
[57:57] favorite
[58:00] scriptures verse eight yes verse eight
[58:03] brother Isaiah 55
[58:09] and8 he says for my thoughts are not
[58:12] your thoughts neither are your ways my
[58:14] ways sayith the Lord for as Heavens are
[58:16] higher than the earth and so my ways are
[58:18] higher than your ways and my thoughts
[58:20] than your thoughts for as the rain
[58:22] cometh down at this part for as the rain
[58:24] cometh down and the snow from Heaven it
[58:26] turneth not hither but WTH the Earth
[58:28] that maketh it bring forth the bud and
[58:30] it uh and it may give seed to the S and
[58:33] bread to the eater so shall my word be
[58:35] that goeth forth out of my mouth it
[58:37] shall not return unto me void but it
[58:39] shall accomplish that which I please it
[58:42] shall prosper and the thing where to I
[58:45] sent it amen amen so he sent his word to
[58:48] make a people in His image and it will
[58:50] accomplish what has been sent to do amen

[1:00:19] Jesus Christ's name amen amen God bless
[1:00:22] you friends you may have your
[1:00:23] seats so I want to uh take a if I can
[1:00:27] take a subject I want to speak about
[1:00:29] from from Hebrews 12 there he says let
[1:00:33] us run and and that's my subject let us
[1:00:37] run amen the Apostle Paul is is is
[1:00:40] admonishing us let us run amen he's not
[1:00:44] saying just walk or just get by or just
[1:00:47] sit back and just watch the world go by
[1:00:49] he says let us run amen so he's calling
[1:00:52] for a people amen not just to be
[1:00:55] spectators but get in the race amen
[1:00:58] There's One Life to Live there's one
[1:01:00] race Hallelujah so he's calling us now
[1:01:03] that we must run now in order to run you
[1:01:06] must know where you're running amen you
[1:01:08] must know where you're running and
[1:01:10] that's why I read there in um Isaiah 55
[1:01:13] God sends his word upon the Earth it
[1:01:15] will not return to him void amen it will
[1:01:18] not just be empty speech but it will
[1:01:20] accomplish that that it's sent to do it
[1:01:22] will produce what it's meant to produce
[1:01:25] when he brooded over over the Earth in
[1:01:26] Genesis he says let there be life life
[1:01:29] came forth that's why he sent his his
[1:01:31] word upon the Earth am mean he brooded
[1:01:33] over the Earth to bring out a life
[1:01:35] Hallelujah and It produced an Eden and
[1:01:38] the same voice that said let there be
[1:01:40] light is speaking in
[1:01:42] 2017 amen uted his voice through the
[1:01:44] mouth of a prophet Amen to to gather a
[1:01:47] people to gather people not to a church
[1:01:50] not to a religion but to him amen that
[1:01:53] they would be made in His image
[1:01:55] Hallelujah that we would know how to run
[1:01:58] amen because in order to run a race you
[1:02:00] must know the rules of the race
[1:02:02] otherwise you get disqualified and it
[1:02:04] doesn't matter your good intentions what
[1:02:06] you're wanting to do if you break the
[1:02:08] rules you're
[1:02:09] disqualified it does so it doesn't
[1:02:11] matter how well you may run if you break
[1:02:13] the rules you're disqualified out of the
[1:02:14] race so we must run according to the
[1:02:17] rules and we must know as I said where
[1:02:19] we're running and we're running to the
[1:02:21] Rapture amen we're running to streets of
[1:02:23] gold Hallelujah so we have cause to run
[1:02:27] amen we have cause to run this race
[1:02:30] hallelujah hallelujah now we must also
[1:02:33] know where we are in the race and we're
[1:02:36] at the end of the race this has been a
[1:02:39] relay race that's right from Calvary
[1:02:42] down to now and we're not at the start
[1:02:44] of the race we're not the first church
[1:02:47] age running in the race we're at the end
[1:02:50] and we're not at the start of the Lan
[1:02:53] age we're in the bright age we're at the
[1:02:55] end of all things if we could just see

[1:08:36] Ruth said your God will be my God your
[1:08:39] people will be my people where I where
[1:08:41] you die all die that was the effect of
[1:08:43] Naomi's testimony on Ruth something
[1:08:46] influenced her and it was the life of
[1:08:48] Naomi right yeah that's true think about
[1:08:51] it it wasn't a very good oh you think
[1:08:53] that's not a powerful witness and we
[1:08:54] beat ourselves up up but Ruth Naomi
[1:08:58] fulfilled what she had to fulfill in her
[1:09:00] day it wasn't glamorous it wasn't
[1:09:03] glorious amen but Ruth had to marry Boaz

[1:09:42] instructed Ruth where to go and what to
[1:09:44] do on the threshing
[1:09:45] floor that's right Hallelujah so we
[1:09:48] think sometimes what am I producing what
[1:09:50] an army to produce in God's eyes that
[1:09:53] was his word being lived out amen didn't
[1:09:55] understand what was going on so don't
[1:09:57] beat yourself up just run amen amen just
[1:10:00] run hallelujah amen he says in Christ
[1:10:02] the mystery God revealed he says the
[1:10:04] devil can't stand it that's the reason
[1:10:07] these e ecumenical kingdoms are setting
[1:10:09] up that's why the world is this way he
[1:10:10] can't stand it that's the reason they're
[1:10:13] all coming into what they're doing now
[1:10:15] the devil that's the reason he's howling
[1:10:16] the way he is his wickedness his scheme
[1:10:18] is being uncovered by the Risen
[1:10:20] resurrected Christ in the headship over
[1:10:22] his body that's why he HS that's why he
[1:10:25] against you amen because the devil had
[1:10:27] you in darkness and he always hides in
[1:10:30] Secrets but then the word comes and you
[1:10:32] want to get rid of that thing you want
[1:10:34] to get rid of that sin or that that
[1:10:36] secret and the devil begins to howl
[1:10:38] because he knows as soon as you confess
[1:10:40] it you make it right he's exposed and
[1:10:42] defeated hallu amen you want to break
[1:10:44] the chains of the enemy confess

[1:10:49] power amen you think I'm beside myself

[1:10:54] same question I'm not

[1:10:58] not me that liveth this is his answer
[1:11:00] it's not me that liveth but Christ The
[1:11:02] Living Word in me it's not my idea it's
[1:11:04] his power it's not my dear it's his word
[1:11:07] he promised it here it is he said it
[1:11:09] would be here and here it is we've got
[1:11:11] his answer Christ has risen and has paid
[1:11:14] the price for our Redemption what God in
[1:11:17] Christ manifested he gave that flesh uh
[1:11:20] that and blood and that the blood uh
[1:11:23] might come to life and the flesh be
[1:11:25] redeemed that God in his redeemed flesh
[1:11:29] could manifest his word for the day as
[1:11:31] he did in that day he says oh glory amen
[1:11:35] so he would take you now brother a
[1:11:37] talking about himself but you got to put
[1:11:38] yourself in there amen that he would
[1:11:40] through redeemed flesh who's who's
[1:11:43] redeemed flesh this morning that through
[1:11:45] redeemed flesh he would manifest himself
[1:11:48] Hallelujah that's what he said amen and
[1:11:51] that's why now to run amen you have to
[1:11:54] be you have to be in the race amen and
[1:11:57] in order to be in the race God has to be
[1:11:59] in you amen you have to say I've decided
[1:12:02] to follow Jesus and once you say I've
[1:12:04] decide to follow Jesus and you surrender
[1:12:06] your entire life he will seal you when
[1:12:09] you're willing to give a full surrender
[1:12:11] he'll seal you into the kingdom and then
[1:12:13] you can run amen amen cuz it's not him
[1:12:16] that willth or him that runneth in his
[1:12:19] own ability but God that give us Mercy
[1:12:22] Hallelujah Jes now Jesus gave a parable
[1:12:25] in Matthew chapter
[1:12:27] 20 he says the Kingdom of Heaven is like
[1:12:30] unto a man that in a householder when he
[1:12:32] went out early in the morning to hire
[1:12:34] laborers in into his Vineyard let's go
[1:12:37] down to verse 20 because he hires
[1:12:39] different people throughout the day so
[1:12:40] when even was come the Lord of The
[1:12:42] Vineyard saith unto his stewards call
[1:12:44] the laborers give them their hire
[1:12:46] beginning from the last unto the first
[1:12:48] and when they came that were hired about
[1:12:51] the 11th Hour they received Every Man a
[1:12:53] penny but when the first came they
[1:12:55] supposed that they would should have
[1:12:57] received more and they likewise received
[1:12:59] Every Man a penny and when they had
[1:13:01] received it they murmured against the
[1:13:03] good man of the house saying these last
[1:13:06] have wrought but one hour and thou Hast
[1:13:08] made them equal unto us which has borne
[1:13:10] the burden In the Heat of the day but he
[1:13:12] answered one of them and said friend I
[1:13:14] do thee no wrong did us not thou agree
[1:13:17] with me for a penny take that thy uh
[1:13:20] take that thyers and go thy way I will
[1:13:22] give unto thee last even as unto thee is
[1:13:25] it not lawful for me to do what I'll do
[1:13:27] with mine own this uh this thine eye
[1:13:30] evil because I am good so the last shall
[1:13:32] be first the first uh last and many are
[1:13:35] called but uh few are chosen we've been
[1:13:38] called we are the 11th our workers upon
[1:13:40] the upon the world amen amen we haven't
[1:13:43] borne the heat of the day like others
[1:13:45] yes right I say praise the Lord but God
[1:13:48] but God knew who would bear the heat of
[1:13:50] the day God knew who would have to labor
[1:13:53] and labor and labor amen sure we labor
[1:13:56] but we are just really receiving the
[1:13:57] benefits of the people's labors that
[1:13:59] have borne the heat of the day but
[1:14:01] everyone receives the same reward am
[1:14:05] everyone receives a Crown of Life
[1:14:06] hallelujah amen but we have to
[1:14:09] understand where we are in the race amen
[1:14:12] because we are the 11th our workers
[1:14:14] there's not an age after this one Amen
[1:14:17] brother Ram said that these young men
[1:14:18] would take this message until the sweep
[1:14:20] it till the coming of the Lord many
[1:14:22] believe that was a previous generation
[1:14:24] but this is this generation
[1:14:26] amen we are if you consider yourself a
[1:14:28] young man we are living
[1:14:30] out we are living out what he said would
[1:14:33] happen there has to be young people that
[1:14:35] carry this message as not just 30 year
[1:14:38] olds it can be 5y olds God uses children
[1:14:42] he uses teenagers he uses anyone he will
[1:14:45] if you give yourself over to him
[1:14:47] Hallelujah so it doesn't age doesn't
[1:14:49] mean nothing you just may have more life
[1:14:52] experience but when it comes to serving
[1:14:54] God just give yourself amen amen this
[1:14:56] race is not a Sprint now maybe I'll just
[1:14:59] lay these points out first now to run a
[1:15:02] race naturally to win Hallelujah now
[1:15:05] let's go to 1 Corinthians 9 actually I
[1:15:07] I'll read this ver I don't want to jump
[1:15:09] ahead of
[1:15:11] myself Paul knew what it was like to see
[1:15:16] racist he says in 1 Corinthians 9 and
[1:15:21] 24 he saw the the Olympics of the day
[1:15:26] what they would do he saw
[1:15:29] athletes he says know you not that they
[1:15:31] which ra run in a race run all but one
[1:15:35] receiveth the prize so run that you may
[1:15:38] obtain so you got to run to win that's
[1:15:40] right and every man that striveth for
[1:15:42] the Mastery is tempered in all things uh
[1:15:45] now they do it to obtain a corruptable
[1:15:47] crown but we and Incorruptible I
[1:15:50] therefore so run not as uncertainly so I
[1:15:55] so fight I not as one that beateth the
[1:15:58] air so he he knows what he's running for
[1:16:00] he knows what he's called to do am amen
[1:16:03] he said at the end you know it was years
[1:16:05] after the road to Damascus experience he
[1:16:07] standing before King agria and he gives
[1:16:09] the account of meeting God on the road
[1:16:11] to Damascus he says therefore I was not
[1:16:13] disobedient to the heavenly vision and
[1:16:16] so he ran amen he ran the race he ran
[1:16:20] his race in his day and he had
[1:16:22] opposition will come to it and he had
[1:16:24] heart he had trial he had all kinds of
[1:16:27] things to face but it didn't hinder him
[1:16:29] he ran the race anyway amen so he knew
[1:16:32] that to run you must you run to win you
[1:16:35] don't run to come second you don't run
[1:16:36] to come third you run to win amen amen
[1:16:39] and that's what we're called to do we we
[1:16:41] have called to run to win amen amen so
[1:16:43] to run a race naturally to win you must
[1:16:46] have ambition amen amen it's not the
[1:16:48] size of the dog it's the size of the
[1:16:51] fight in the dog amen amen and that is
[1:16:53] the main thing you know I heard brother
[1:16:56] Ron Spencer he preached a sermon quite a
[1:16:58] long time ago about um influenced by
[1:17:00] eternity and he said there's the
[1:17:02] Kentucky Derby in America people spend
[1:17:04] millions of dollars one guy spends
[1:17:06] millions of dollars to find the right
[1:17:07] horse and to train it and everything
[1:17:09] he's never I don't think he's ever won
[1:17:10] the race and there was this one horse
[1:17:14] and it didn't look like a champion but
[1:17:17] one guy decided to buy it anyway and he
[1:17:19] decided to train it and put it on the
[1:17:20] horse it do look like a champion but it
[1:17:22] won amen because it's that unseen part
[1:17:25] of the animal it's the size of the fight
[1:17:28] in the dog I trust I get that the right
[1:17:30] way it's the size of the fight in the
[1:17:32] dog that counts amen and so now to to
[1:17:35] run a race to win you must have ambition
[1:17:39] and ambition is generated because they
[1:17:42] believe they can do it or it's been
[1:17:44] revealed to them they can do it I mean
[1:17:47] that's why people you know you know
[1:17:49] people try and win at the Olympics they
[1:17:51] believe they can do it they believe
[1:17:52] they've done the training they've you
[1:17:55] know they have the stats they believe
[1:17:57] they can do it and that generates
[1:18:00] ambition amen because you can really put
[1:18:02] yourself in hey I'm going to win today I
[1:18:05] mean you never see people go onto the
[1:18:06] field or to the track look look defeated
[1:18:09] they're focused they know they've been
[1:18:12] spending years sometimes training theyve
[1:18:15] their whole lifestyle has been changed
[1:18:18] for One race for One race their whole
[1:18:21] life has been rearranged amen amen
[1:18:25] if it's been revealed that you're going
[1:18:27] to win that will give you all the
[1:18:28] ambition you need amen it's the
[1:18:30] influence also of the Unseen that causes
[1:18:34] us to win as I said about the horse the
[1:18:36] influence so now we have been influenced
[1:18:38] by an unseen realm we are not walking
[1:18:41] this walk this is not a hap Hazard amen
[1:18:44] I'll I'll serve God the best I can and
[1:18:47] then maybe when I stand before a stone
[1:18:49] you'll say Well done no that's not the
[1:18:51] that's not the race that's not the walk
[1:18:53] it's I known whom I have believe I've
[1:18:55] been cleansed of every sin amen I'm not
[1:18:58] walking in doubt that maybe he'll
[1:19:00] receive me he's received me Hallelujah
[1:19:02] his Spirit has come upon you change your
[1:19:04] nature you've been received Hallelujah
[1:19:07] and it's through the message of the hour
[1:19:09] you received amen cuz he comes the
[1:19:11] bridegroom stands into a prophet vessel
[1:19:14] invitation goes out will you come will
[1:19:17] you come to the wedding supper will you
[1:19:19] become come be married to our lord Jesus
[1:19:22] Amen brother bar preach a sermon as your
[1:19:23] life worthy of the Gospel El and he
[1:19:25] talks about when the servants go out the
[1:19:28] ones that are invited they don't come
[1:19:30] and they are sent to another group of
[1:19:32] people they don't come then they go to
[1:19:34] the highways and byways those people
[1:19:35] come and he says that's the three polls
[1:19:38] of his ministry there's the healing and
[1:19:40] then the discernment all the reason was
[1:19:42] it for people to come to the wedding
[1:19:43] supper and then the third pole goes out
[1:19:46] which it has Amen to receive the halt
[1:19:49] blame uh lame and Halt and blind amen
[1:19:51] they would come into the feast
[1:19:54] Hallelujah Hallelujah and he says the
[1:19:56] Pentecostals turn down the supernatural
[1:19:59] Feast they turn down the wedding
[1:20:02] invitation because they'd rather stick
[1:20:04] with their church and what their daddies
[1:20:06] told them instead of actually looking
[1:20:08] into the word themselves and saying I'm
[1:20:10] going to serve God as he has led me amen
[1:20:14] we don't want to hold on to tradition
[1:20:16] what does it mean okay I'm just going to
[1:20:17] I was thinking about this the other few
[1:20:19] days ago what does it mean to take the
[1:20:21] lord's name in vain right what does it
[1:20:23] mean mean people many times we think
[1:20:25] it's using his name as a curse word
[1:20:27] which you should never do because
[1:20:28] there's power in that name but to take
[1:20:30] the lord's name in vain to me Jesus said
[1:20:33] by teaching the Commandments and
[1:20:34] doctrines of men you make my word no
[1:20:36] effect amen so they are trying to
[1:20:40] embrace or receive his name but because
[1:20:43] there the Creeds and doctrines of men it
[1:20:45] makes it in vain yes amen so they are
[1:20:48] breaking they are taking the Law's name
[1:20:50] in vain because they take Creeds and
[1:20:52] dogmas above the word amen amen
[1:20:56] amen I'm glad we're not in that
[1:20:59] category amen thank you Jesus amen amen
[1:21:02] so we never want yeah so people's hearts
[1:21:04] are C there's power in the name of Jesus
[1:21:06] that's why you never say people you
[1:21:08] never people people never use oh oh
[1:21:11] Buddha as a curse word or oh Muhammad or
[1:21:13] oh confucious you know you never hear
[1:21:16] people say that because there's no power
[1:21:17] in those names that's why people use the
[1:21:19] name of Jesus Christ cuz there's
[1:21:20] absolute power in that
[1:21:22] name Hallelujah Hallelujah now when the
[1:21:25] Finishing Line I I mentioned this before
[1:21:27] but when the Finishing Line gets closer
[1:21:30] it gives the runner an extra due boost
[1:21:33] of

[1:21:38] see the Finish Line come closer it gives

[1:27:22] you and your faith will either paralyze
[1:27:25] the world or the world will paralyze
[1:27:28] your faith brother BR said it so it's
[1:27:31] depending what you wanting do you want
[1:27:32] your faith to paralyze the enemy yes or
[1:27:35] do you want the enemy to paralyze your
[1:27:37] faith it's up to you what do you want if

[1:28:21] God is calling us to a walk that it
[1:28:24] doesn't matter what situation we're in
[1:28:26] or what's going on in life your faith
[1:28:29] will subdue what's going on am Jesus
[1:28:31] talked about I mean brother BR talk well
[1:28:33] I'd say it's Jesus cuz it was Jesus and
[1:28:35] brother brand he said the prophecy of
[1:28:37] perfect Faith Peter walking on the water
[1:28:40] he had perfect Faith but he be to look
[1:28:42] at the situations around him then he be
[1:28:44] to
[1:28:45] sink but if he ignored what was going on
[1:28:48] around him then he continued to walk in
[1:28:51] perfect faith and that is what God has
[1:28:53] called us to do in this hour am to walk
[1:28:56] in perfect Faith so it doesn't matter if
[1:28:59] your life naturally is going backwards
[1:29:02] or in pieces or totally in just as dust
[1:29:05] and Ashes you can say I'm running am
[1:29:09] amen amen because to run you must be
[1:29:13] unced right you can't run if you got a
[1:29:16] big massive pack on your back you can't
[1:29:17] do a Sprint if you did that would be
[1:29:19] awesome but you know most people can't
[1:29:20] do it they run slower than when they
[1:29:23] don't have it on their back yes right so
[1:29:25] you cannot run if you are if you got a
[1:29:29] big weight on you we must run
[1:29:33] unencumbered yes amen yes amen amen Paul
[1:29:36] said in Galatians
[1:29:39] 5:7 he says now ye did run well who did
[1:29:44] hinder you that you should not obey the
[1:29:46] truth this persuasion cometh not of him
[1:29:50] that calleth you so he's asking the
[1:29:52] question you ran well you started the
[1:29:55] race real good but what is hindering you
[1:29:58] Galatians what is stopping you from
[1:30:00] running and being the light for your age
[1:30:03] in that part of the earth and we know
[1:30:06] they brought in you know Judaism they
[1:30:08] brought in the law yeah they brought in
[1:30:11] things that God did not God did not
[1:30:13] intend for the Christian church because
[1:30:16] Paul talks about the law of Faith yep he
[1:30:20] says that law is what you should be
[1:30:23] being living by the law of faith and the
[1:30:26] law of faith is that you receive the
[1:30:29] word the anointed word you receive it
[1:30:31] faith comes into your heart you say I
[1:30:33] believe it amen and then your confession
[1:30:36] is then worked out in your life amen
[1:30:39] amen because you say I believe it and
[1:30:41] something you know you you you have to
[1:30:45] respond you can't sit there like a piece
[1:30:47] of plaster on a
[1:30:48] bench amen you've got to respond God is
[1:30:51] looking for a response from you
[1:30:54] amen and our response should always be
[1:30:56] yes Lord be it unto me according to Thy
[1:30:59] word amen Amen Let It Be unto me
[1:31:02] according to Thy word because his word
[1:31:05] will his word is not you know you're
[1:31:08] going to be in unbelief you're going to
[1:31:11] be overcome by the enemy you know you're
[1:31:13] just going to struggle along in life
[1:31:15] that's not what he wants for us amen
[1:31:17] that's right I have thoughts towards you
[1:31:19] there are peace that you may have an
[1:31:21] expected end what's our expected end a
[1:31:24] Rapture Made In His Image that's our
[1:31:26] expected end amen hallelujah so he says
[1:31:30] you did run well so what happened now an
[1:31:33] antichrist Spirit came into the galatian
[1:31:35] church and it hindered their race it
[1:31:37] hindered them running yes amen but we
[1:31:40] are called
[1:31:42] now to lay aside every weight and sin
[1:31:45] amen that so easily besets us we read in
[1:31:48] Hebrews 12 we are called he says let us
[1:31:51] run amen he says let us therefore lay
[1:31:54] aside every weight and sin that so
[1:31:56] easily besets us so if he's calling for
[1:31:59] you to lay aside every weight and sin he
[1:32:01] gives you the ability now don't fall
[1:32:04] asleep on me people he gives you the
[1:32:06] ability to lay aside the weight and
[1:32:09] every sin that's so easily beset you
[1:32:11] amen because if if you allow him to
[1:32:13] change your nature if you allow him to
[1:32:16] change it now then you won't have the
[1:32:18] problems you have amen because if God
[1:32:21] changes your nature it's like you know
[1:32:24] if I was addicted like once upon a time
[1:32:26] well you know the story used to make
[1:32:28] home and all these things I couldn't
[1:32:29] afford to smoke I was a student but
[1:32:32] anyway you know H absolutely you know
[1:32:36] but it's because there was a thirst in
[1:32:37] me I needed
[1:32:39] it I needed it so there my nature was I
[1:32:42] need that because I had a sin nature cuz
[1:32:44] we're all born with a sin nature amen
[1:32:46] but that when God took that sin nature
[1:32:48] out of me I could be living in a brewery
[1:32:52] and I'd be I'd just be so anyway
[1:32:55] Hallelujah I don't have to walk and be
[1:32:57] oh keep it from me I'm scared I don't
[1:32:59] want to fall into it no if your nature
[1:33:01] is change and you have no desire and
[1:33:03] here for it you don't need to
[1:33:05] fear Hallelujah that's why we he gives
[1:33:08] you the ability to lay those things
[1:33:10] aside amen hallelujah amen I'm so glad
[1:33:14] that's the case hallelujah amen that's
[1:33:17] right amen
[1:33:20] now don't let a weight lay aside every
[1:33:23] weight amen amen amen if you're you know
[1:33:27] we have to walk in such a way it doesn't
[1:33:29] matter if Mama don't go or daddy don't
[1:33:32] go or husband don't go wife don't go or
[1:33:34] siblings don't go I'm going to go amen
[1:33:37] amen don't let family pressure hold you
[1:33:39] back who's who's going to be there at
[1:33:42] the white Throne judgment is your office
[1:33:45] are your colleagues going to be there
[1:33:47] judging you is your family going to be
[1:33:49] there judging you is your Society going
[1:33:51] to be standing on the throne

[1:33:58] in this life this life is but a
[1:34:01] vapor amen this life is going to be over
[1:34:03] very soon that's right praise God it's
[1:34:06] going to be
[1:34:07] over amen not because I want to go but

[1:39:11] remembered amen hallelujah amen and
[1:39:15] that's how I feel about it why give him
[1:39:17] that place that's right now so we have
[1:39:20] to amen Abraham now let's go to Romans
[1:39:23] chapter 4 and I this is one of my
[1:39:26] favorite scriptures as
[1:39:28] well I love Abraham amen Abraham is
[1:39:32] that's incredible amen he had no Bible
[1:39:35] he didn't have 1100 odd tapes he didn't
[1:39:38] have a church he didn't have Ministry to
[1:39:40] come and say you can do it he didn't
[1:39:41] have you know he didn't have the
[1:39:42] internet go and watch watch his favorite
[1:39:44] preacher On The Backs side the desert of
[1:39:46] memmory you know all he had was God's
[1:39:49] voice yes and that's you know all those
[1:39:52] things are good right just mentioned but
[1:39:54] it has to be you have to hear the voice
[1:39:55] behind the voice amen that it's not just
[1:39:57] the preacher's Voice or the prophet's
[1:40:00] voice but you can hear the voice of God
[1:40:02] coming behind that and it quickens
[1:40:04] something in your life changes you and
[1:40:07] Abraham's life was changed here he was
[1:40:09] you know you think in those days and
[1:40:11] it's still in in some places people
[1:40:14] didn't move around a lot like in this
[1:40:16] day and age you know we know half of you
[1:40:19] all are from from from Africa and you've
[1:40:22] come over here you know it's like my dad
[1:40:25] came from Cape Town I was born here but
[1:40:28] back in the day a few hundred years it
[1:40:29] didn't really happen that way no amen so
[1:40:32] Abraham he would have stayed there in
[1:40:35] what we call
[1:40:36] Iraq he would have raised his children
[1:40:38] his Elder son would have become the head
[1:40:40] of the tribe or a servant whatever more
[1:40:42] whatever would have happened but they
[1:40:44] would have stayed there that's where
[1:40:45] they were but then one day God spoke to
[1:40:48] him amen leave this place yes I'm going
[1:40:51] to take you to another place Hallelujah
[1:40:54] and I don't know what language he spoke
[1:40:55] to him or how he spoke to him but
[1:40:57] something gripped his life he be to run
[1:41:00] Amen brother Braham says there was
[1:41:02] nothing special about Abraham but God
[1:41:04] called him that's what made him special
[1:41:06] amen it's the same thing with us there's
[1:41:07] nothing special about us but God has
[1:41:10] called us amen you say well there's
[1:41:12] nothing special about you the devil says
[1:41:14] there's nothing special about you you
[1:41:15] think you're whatever you say but God
[1:41:17] has called me amen and he's not called
[1:41:20] me to wrath and destruction but he's
[1:41:22] called me to came salvation by Jesus
[1:41:24] Christ that's what he's called me for
[1:41:27] yes thank you Jesus Hallelujah so he
[1:41:29] begins to he begins to
[1:41:31] run now let's but now Abraham came to
[1:41:35] this spot in Romans
[1:41:38] 4 and let's go down
[1:41:41] to I don't want to read just a little
[1:41:43] bit let's read from verse 13 because I
[1:41:44] just like this chapter for the promise
[1:41:46] that he should be the heir of the world
[1:41:48] was not to Abraham or to his seed
[1:41:50] through the law but through the
[1:41:52] righteousness of faith
[1:41:53] yes for if they which are of the law be
[1:41:56] ears faith is made void and the promise
[1:41:59] made of none effect because the law
[1:42:01] worketh wrath for where no law is there
[1:42:03] is no transgression therefore it is of
[1:42:05] faith and that it might be by grace to
[1:42:08] the end of the promise might be sure to
[1:42:10] all seed not to only which is of the law
[1:42:14] but to that which uh but that also which
[1:42:16] is of the faith of Abraham who is the
[1:42:18] father of us all as is written I have
[1:42:21] made thee a father of many nations
[1:42:23] before him whom he believed even God who
[1:42:26] quickened the dead and called those
[1:42:28] things which be not as though they were
[1:42:31] who against hope now hope is an
[1:42:33] expectation who against hope believed in
[1:42:35] hope that he might become the father of
[1:42:37] many nations according to that which was
[1:42:39] spoken so shall thy seed be and being
[1:42:42] not weak in faith he considered not his
[1:42:44] own body now dead when he was about 100
[1:42:48] years old neither yet the deadness of
[1:42:50] Sarah's womb he staggered not at the of
[1:42:53] God through unbelief but was strong in
[1:42:55] faith giving glory to God and being
[1:42:58] fully persuaded that he that had
[1:43:00] promised he was also able to perform and
[1:43:03] therefore was imputed to him for
[1:43:05] righteousness now it was not written for
[1:43:07] his sake alone that it was imputed to
[1:43:09] him but for us also to whom it shall be
[1:43:13] imputed if we believe on him that raised
[1:43:15] up Jesus our lord from the dead who was
[1:43:18] delivered for our offenses and was
[1:43:20] raised again for our justification
[1:43:24] Hallelujah so Paul is saying here that
[1:43:27] Abraham he staggered not at the promise
[1:43:29] now remember he couldn't have a child
[1:43:32] he's 100 years old his body was now dead
[1:43:35] Sarah couldn't have the child that's why
[1:43:36] they had it through hagga few years
[1:43:38] before this so physically it was
[1:43:42] impossible I know this is by Elementary
[1:43:45] but he didn't even bring his own State
[1:43:48] into
[1:43:49] account amen he didn't bring his own
[1:43:51] state so he didn't he didn't here now
[1:43:53] I'll bring into Monday language he
[1:43:55] didn't bring his own state of how his
[1:43:57] family is yes amen where his children
[1:43:59] may be amen how his walk how he feels
[1:44:02] his walk with the Lord is going amen how
[1:44:04] Victorious he thinks he is he didn't
[1:44:06] bring it how healthy he is how much
[1:44:08] money he has you know what is what is
[1:44:11] life's Direction he thinks is going he
[1:44:13] didn't bring it into account amen are
[1:44:15] you with me he didn't bring it into
[1:44:16] account he just lay hold of the promise
[1:44:19] and said God you you're going to give me
[1:44:21] the promise son I don't know how it's
[1:44:23] going to happen but I believe your word
[1:44:26] hallelujah and that is the same it says
[1:44:29] that it was imputed that that was done
[1:44:31] that it would be imputed to us also amen
[1:44:33] that we would not stagger at the promise
[1:44:36] don't even if God said it that's it amen
[1:44:39] if he's promised you something don't
[1:44:41] work out how it's going to happen how
[1:44:44] it's going to work out if God said he's
[1:44:46] going to do it he will take care of the
[1:44:47] details amen amen he'll take care of the
[1:44:50] details amen oh Lord hallelujah so so
[1:44:53] don't look at your own State never look
[1:44:55] at your own State amen he didn't look at
[1:44:57] his own State yes he say well I've been
[1:45:00] going through this trial for years he
[1:45:02] had 25 years of trial but he still ran
[1:45:07] amen amen didn't hinder his run amen
[1:45:10] hallelujah he still ran because there
[1:45:12] was an end to his barness Ser there
[1:45:15] there came an end to his barness amen
[1:45:18] and it's like us when we when we're
[1:45:20] going through trials and things they
[1:45:22] will come to an in amen amen just
[1:45:24] because life is in a certain direction
[1:45:26] does not mean it will always be that way
[1:45:29] amen you have to believe that I haven't
[1:45:32] seen any
[1:45:33] change day one after the promise Sarah
[1:45:37] how you feeling nothing Abraham next

[1:46:04] older amen but Abraham was glory to God
[1:46:08] his promis us the son he's going to come
[1:46:11] amen doesn't matter remember Sarah
[1:46:12] didn't believe Sarah had doubt that's
[1:46:15] why he said take hagga Sarah had doubt
[1:46:18] but he was still strong in the promise
[1:46:20] yes amen amen and his faith Faith caused
[1:46:23] her to
[1:46:24] believe amen because he kept brother
[1:46:26] Braham on the PLS of memory they went
[1:46:29] out they went down and S and the ra well
[1:46:31] watered PLS of Sodom so things were a
[1:46:32] bit hard their situation was a bit hard

[1:46:39] getting a little bit fussy and he knew
[1:46:41] hey there may just be the visitation
[1:46:45] today Hallelujah because he knew the
[1:46:48] promise became real to him but it wasn't
[1:46:50] just enough for her to tell for him to
[1:46:52] tell her it had become personal to Sarah

[1:46:57] atmosphere he's sitting under an oak

[1:50:18] 56 he says God took Abraham uh out when
[1:50:21] he was 90 and N Abraham was getting old
[1:50:23] the stream of life was dead in him any
[1:50:25] man woman knows what I'm speaking Sarah
[1:50:28] an old woman and Abraham an old
[1:50:30] man and he had trusted and waited for
[1:50:34] this promise to be fulfilled then what
[1:50:37] happened God took him out and appeared
[1:50:39] to him in another name in the name of
[1:50:41] God Almighty the 17th chapter of Genesis
[1:50:43] he appeared to him in the name of God
[1:50:44] Almighty in the Hebrew it's alai which
[1:50:47] means the uh the breast of a woman said
[1:50:49] said Abraham I'm going I'm appearing to

[1:51:15] if he was that to Abraham he's got to be
[1:51:17] that to you yes amen amen for the same
[1:51:20] promises no matter how sick you are how
[1:51:22] far you're gone lay a hold of God's
[1:51:25] Eternal promises and nurse your life
[1:51:27] back again how far you are in sin how
[1:51:31] black you are you may be a prostitute
[1:51:33] from the street but that same promise is
[1:51:35] to you if you'll dare to take a hold of
[1:51:40] God's word if you dare I dare you this
[1:51:43] morning doesn't matter what condition
[1:51:46] remember
[1:51:47] people you know someone could be sitting
[1:51:50] in church all their life and not one
[1:51:52] step towards God or they can be a child
[1:51:57] rapist on the street who's a serial
[1:51:59] killer on top of it and in God's eyes
[1:52:03] they are in the same
[1:52:05] boat as I said someone in church who's
[1:52:07] never made a step towards God and that
[1:52:10] person they're all in they they're
[1:52:12] they're all in
[1:52:14] darkness because if you haven't even
[1:52:16] just made a step then you haven't even
[1:52:19] made first base yet yes amen you have
[1:52:22] haven't even started your walk he hasn't
[1:52:24] started his walk either but what the
[1:52:27] enemy has manifested in his life and the
[1:52:29] person in Church's life it just appears
[1:52:32] different but they're still in the same
[1:52:34] category that's right amen I'm using
[1:52:36] extreme example because the problem is
[1:52:37] we take a we we we put a level of of
[1:52:41] this like that person you think he's far
[1:52:43] away from God and that person's real
[1:52:46] close but their hearts could just be as
[1:52:48] far away as each other but humanly we
[1:52:51] gauge things yes so it doesn't matter if
[1:52:53] you're in that state or you're in this
[1:52:56] state amen you're still all in the same
[1:52:59] boat yes amen amen so never despair
[1:53:03] where someone may go it it actually
[1:53:06] doesn't matter amen right it actually
[1:53:10] doesn't matter they're still in the same
[1:53:11] boat you understand what they do
[1:53:13] remember the blood of Jesus Christ
[1:53:15] doesn't wear thin the more sin it has to
[1:53:18] eradicate it doesn't it doesn't you know
[1:53:20] run out or you know the is absolute amen
[1:53:24] amen it never gets it never gets the you
[1:53:27] never gets you never gets a time please
[1:53:28] wait I got to recharge the battery or
[1:53:30] whatever you know you cannot draw too
[1:53:32] much juice you understand so don't
[1:53:35] despair wherever whoever wherever may be
[1:53:39] it doesn't matter yeah amen amen God can
[1:53:42] save them look he takes Moses he
[1:53:44] murdered a guy yes Peter tried to kill a
[1:53:47] guy with a sword he just wasn't a sword
[1:53:49] he cut his ear off David was an
[1:53:51] adulterer David did far worse things
[1:53:54] than Saul yes far worse but yet he was a
[1:53:57] man after his own heart you know yes you
[1:54:00] take all of the that's why there's a
[1:54:02] reason all of those things are look at
[1:54:05] Rahab she's a harlot amen she's an enemy
[1:54:07] of God standing in the inheritance which
[1:54:10] doesn't belong to her she should have
[1:54:12] been wiped out as sure as everyone else
[1:54:14] in Jericho yes amen but when she heard
[1:54:17] about what God did she called out for
[1:54:19] Mercy amen amen and she called out for
[1:54:22] mercy and she received it amen amen so
[1:54:25] if you call out Jesus saved me Jesus
[1:54:28] redeemed me amen he will no I cast you
[1:54:32] out Hallelujah you know and see you know
[1:54:35] you take there's a reason all those
[1:54:37] things are written in the Bible cuz it's
[1:54:39] got to show us it doesn't matter where
[1:54:41] we're called from it's irrelevant amen
[1:54:45] it doesn't matter our initial State God
[1:54:48] has a perfect image of you yes amen amen
[1:54:51] that he want to mold you into you with
[1:54:54] me it doesn't matter where you start
[1:54:57] it's where you're finishing that's the
[1:54:58] main thing Hallelujah so don't worry
[1:55:01] about those things just nurse from the
[1:55:03] promise of God am
[1:55:06] amen I dare you to get a hold of God
[1:55:09] Amen if you'll dare to take a hold of
[1:55:10] God brother uh brother B says now
[1:55:14] Paul knew what it was like to run as
[1:55:19] I've said now maybe I'll say this first
[1:55:21] now brother says and spoken word is the
[1:55:24] Original
[1:55:25] Seed and he speaks about the high
[1:55:27] breeding of the word then God sends
[1:55:29] another man or you know brings another
[1:55:31] Revival to bring the people back to the
[1:55:33] truth he says that's why each
[1:55:36] generation has its own Revival a chance
[1:55:39] at the word so The Sovereign God at the
[1:55:43] Judgment John Wesley's group will raise
[1:55:44] up and these start was Methodist of
[1:55:47] today will answer for Luther will raise
[1:55:49] up the Catholics will raise up back
[1:55:52] behind irenius Martin po carp and all
[1:55:54] those to the real Catholics before it
[1:55:55] became what it is now and we'll and we
[1:55:58] have to stand in judgment for hybriding
[1:56:00] the word of God to
[1:56:02] dogmas and he said now so so every
[1:56:04] generation has its own Revival he says
[1:56:07] in the same message a bit further down
[1:56:09] now remember correctly that's why each
[1:56:11] generation has its own Revival it gets a
[1:56:14] chance at the word amen to live a pure
[1:56:18] word out yes right that every generation
[1:56:21] has it chance at its own Revival its own
[1:56:24] chance at the word now I'm saying that
[1:56:27] is because we are a generation we're
[1:56:29] over 50 years down the road from when
[1:56:31] brother Brown was taken off the scene
[1:56:33] amen and some of us are third fourth
[1:56:36] generation
[1:56:38] Believers amen some are right that's
[1:56:41] Generations down so we can't just rest
[1:56:44] on The Laurels of all this is what my
[1:56:46] parents did or my grandparents did we
[1:56:48] have our chance at the word a chance at
[1:56:51] our own reev Revival each generation
[1:56:54] must have its own Revival am amen and we
[1:56:57] are another generation amen amen we have
[1:57:01] our chance to take the bad as I said or
[1:57:03] become the torch amen and run this race
[1:57:06] amen hallelujah we have a chance we must
[1:57:10] so why are you saying
[1:57:13] that take hold of it take hold of this
[1:57:16] word take hold of this message
[1:57:18] hallelujah amen and run am amen amen you
[1:57:22] say well God did heaps of amazing things
[1:57:24] you know brother braham's life maybe
[1:57:26] years ago but what about today are my
[1:57:30] parents met God but what about you yes
[1:57:32] amen
[1:57:34] amen now Paul as I said he knew what it
[1:57:37] was like to he ran we can all agree he
[1:57:40] ran his race he finished his course he
[1:57:43] received his crown am mean he passed the
[1:57:45] Baton on he passed the anointing on to
[1:57:47] Timothy in the Next Generation down he
[1:57:50] ran his race well but he had problems he
[1:57:53] had to endure along along the track yes
[1:57:56] right and so now even Paul himself now
[1:57:59] we know he was beaten he was Shipwrecked
[1:58:01] he was you know he had all those
[1:58:02] external problems but then also he had a
[1:58:07] problem uh in his own flesh he says in 2
[1:58:10] Corinthians 12:7 unless I should be
[1:58:13] exalted above the measure through the
[1:58:15] abundance of the revelations that were
[1:58:17] given to me a thorn in the flesh a
[1:58:19] messenger of Satan to Buffet me least I
[1:58:22] should be exalted above measure for this
[1:58:24] thing I besought the Lord
[1:58:26] Thrice that it might depart from me and
[1:58:28] he said unto me my grace is sufficient
[1:58:31] for thee for my strength is made perfect
[1:58:33] in weakness most gladly therefore I will
[1:58:36] rather glory in my infirmities that the
[1:58:39] power of Christ May rest upon me this is
[1:58:42] in Galatians 6:11 ye see how large a
[1:58:46] letter I have written unto you with my
[1:58:48] own hand and the and the correct
[1:58:50] interpretation say that the large
[1:58:51] letters I have written cuz normally cuz
[1:58:53] he had a blindness thing that would come
[1:58:54] off and on him right he had this thought
[1:58:56] in his flesh so he had a sickness in his
[1:58:59] body that he couldn't get rid of Amen
[1:59:04] now does that mean he was weak in faith
[1:59:07] he's the first church age messenger but
[1:59:09] remember he besought the Lord and the
[1:59:11] Lord told him this is what it is so he
[1:59:13] didn't just take it for granted well
[1:59:14] this is just my lot in life this is what
[1:59:16] I've pulled out the grab bag of life God
[1:59:18] told him his grace was sufficient right
[1:59:21] and so now this Affliction in his body
[1:59:24] did not stop him from running it didn't
[1:59:26] dilute his faith it didn't diminish his
[1:59:28] walk he glor in it he said praise God
[1:59:32] Amen so I'm saying that because if he
[1:59:36] can
[1:59:36] run amen if he can run yes amen and he
[1:59:40] thought that he would be the generation
[1:59:42] that the coming of the Lord would come
[1:59:43] to but he was prophesying of us if he
[1:59:46] could run with that Affliction and all
[1:59:48] the hardship he endured how much you and
[1:59:51] I
[1:59:52] amen living in a flowery bed of east of
[1:59:56] this modern society don't let this world
[1:59:58] lull you to sleep whatever you do don't
[2:00:01] get comfortable and just well I go to
[2:00:04] church on Sunday I have my job my family

[2:00:08] remember as I said an athlete an athlete
[2:00:11] that believes they can win their whole
[2:00:14] life is around that one goal their whole
[2:00:18] life their whole life and in its
[2:00:20] entirety not part of it not time what
[2:00:23] they eat down to the
[2:00:25] killer amen how much they sleep yes
[2:00:28] hallelujah how much they train amen when
[2:00:31] they train what they train on it's all
[2:00:34] down to a fine detail because they have
[2:00:36] one race Hallelujah and their whole life
[2:00:39] is rearranged about that goal amen and
[2:00:42] people admire them for it amen people
[2:00:44] admire oh there goes my hero running the
[2:00:47] hund
[2:00:48] incredible you know people but then you
[2:00:52] take it into the Christian realm that's
[2:00:53] just the naturals you read it's just
[2:00:55] they obtain a corruptible
[2:00:57] Crown there'll come a day when those
[2:00:59] things are not remembered anymore hey I
[2:01:01] admire you know it's amazing people can
[2:01:04] do that kind of stuff but that's not
[2:01:06] that's not the race we're called to run
[2:01:09] amen they put all of their ambition the
[2:01:12] the mental toughness that they have you
[2:01:15] know it's not just a ha hasard thing
[2:01:16] that they just like a stab in the dark
[2:01:18] their whole life is focused on that goal
[2:01:21] their whole entire life yes amen and
[2:01:24] they give years some of you know more
[2:01:27] than my you know better than me about
[2:01:28] but they give years of their lives just
[2:01:30] for one race just for one race and then
[2:01:34] now you'll see people and the world you
[2:01:37] take a devout
[2:01:39] believer amen who's running the race and
[2:01:42] their whole life is revolving yes Glory

[2:02:57] ability to win they think you're crazy
[2:03:00] yeah and then we allow this world to
[2:03:02] look at us and we think oh I hope they

[2:04:17] us wisdom to do it but you see so it
[2:04:20] won't make you weird in that way way you
[2:04:22] understand but you know he never rebuked
[2:04:25] his disciples for going being overboard
[2:04:28] right we don't think the people I'm just
[2:04:30] laboring this point because in the
[2:04:31] Olympics we don't think the world does
[2:04:33] not think those people are overboard
[2:04:35] right you know they do not think no one
[2:04:38] thinks they're overboard they think hey
[2:04:40] good on them Bravo I want to see you do
[2:04:43] it that's right that's the same thing
[2:04:46] yeah but you got to take that into
[2:04:46] Christianity but everyone thinks we're
[2:04:49] overboard everyone thinks you're just
[2:04:51] crazy no there's a Finish Line there's a
[2:04:55] crown of gold there's a race amen that
[2:04:58] I'm going to run amen
[2:05:01] hallelujah do not worry about now I'm
[2:05:03] just going to read a few things do not
[2:05:04] worry when hardship comes yes right as I
[2:05:10] said there's no temptation given which
[2:05:12] is common to man that you suffer we all
[2:05:14] receive hard times yes right and it says
[2:05:17] now rejoice in Hope patient and
[2:05:19] tribulation continuing inant in prayer
[2:05:21] Romans 12:2 and then John 16 and33 these
[2:05:25] things I have spoken unto you that in me
[2:05:27] you might have peace in the world you
[2:05:29] shall have tribulation this is Jesus
[2:05:31] speaking but be of good cheer I have
[2:05:34] overcome the world so he says you are
[2:05:36] going to have tribulation am mean you're
[2:05:38] going to have hard times but be of good
[2:05:41] cheer because I have overcome the worldj
[2:05:44] Hallelujah so we don't need to worry as
[2:05:46] I said don't worry about what hardships
[2:05:49] you go through don't let it stop you
[2:05:52] from running the race right amen amen
[2:05:54] and we we understand now that all see it
[2:05:58] says in uh Corin I think it's Colossians
[2:06:02] 4:17 No 2 Corinthians 4:17 for our light
[2:06:06] Affliction right which is but for a
[2:06:09] moment worketh in us a far more
[2:06:11] exceeding and eternal weight of Glory
[2:06:14] while we look not at the things which
[2:06:15] are seen but the things which are not
[2:06:17] seen for the things which are seen are
[2:06:19] temporal but the things which are not
[2:06:21] seen are Eternal so he says but this
[2:06:23] light Affliction but is but for a moment
[2:06:27] amen so any hardship or trial or
[2:06:29] anything go through it is but for a
[2:06:32] moment amen do not let the devil put
[2:06:35] into your mind that this is your portion
[2:06:37] in life this is how you're going to be
[2:06:39] and there's no changing it yes amen
[2:06:41] never hold on to that amen it is but a
[2:06:45] light of fliction and it is but for a
[2:06:46] moment amen hallelujah that's what he
[2:06:49] this is what he said now
[2:06:52] 1 Peter 5:10 but the God of all peace
[2:06:55] who have called us unto his eternal uh
[2:06:57] Glory by Christ Jesus after ye have
[2:06:59] suffered a while a while what's a while
[2:07:02] a space of time amen uh make you perfect
[2:07:06] establish strength and settle you amen
[2:07:09] so he's saying that there' be suffering
[2:07:11] just a while there comes a time when
[2:07:14] suffering comes to an end I'm not just
[2:07:16] talking when these bodies are changed
[2:07:18] I'm talking about an everyday life there
[2:07:20] comes an end of a season
[2:07:22] I mean we are creatures of time we just
[2:07:24] had apparently summer and now we're in
[2:07:27] Autumn which is very much here and then
[2:07:29] we're really going to experience winter
[2:07:31] and there might be spring I don't know
[2:07:32] and then there might be summer again but
[2:07:34] there's a change in season right and
[2:07:37] it's like natural life there's always a
[2:07:39] changeing season amen it's not always a
[2:07:42] continuous cycle of defeat and darkness
[2:07:45] and unbelief but God is the cycle
[2:07:48] breaker amen and he is present to break
[2:07:51] because whatever cycle of night time you
[2:07:53] may be in it doesn't mean it's always
[2:07:55] going to be night it doesn't mean it's
[2:07:57] always going to be worry and strife that
[2:07:59] is but a
[2:08:01] season amen and you must always look at
[2:08:03] and say this is but a season amen and
[2:08:06] God is going to remember God doesn't
[2:08:08] send you through a trial he leads you
[2:08:11] through a trial he is our Shepherd is he
[2:08:14] your Shepherd this morning and and the
[2:08:16] Shepherd in the Eastern countries they
[2:08:18] don't send a bunch of dogs chase the
[2:08:20] Sheep through a
[2:08:22] they call their sheep by name and they
[2:08:25] lead they're in the front and they're
[2:08:26] leading the sheep and the Sheep follow
[2:08:28] them and the Sheep know exactly who they
[2:08:30] are and the Sheep know who their
[2:08:31] Shepherd is amen so it's whenever and so
[2:08:34] it's wherever he leads us yes amen I'll
[2:08:38] follow because if he's led me into the
[2:08:40] pit he won't leave me in the pit he
[2:08:42] wants to take me up the outer side if he
[2:08:44] takes me through the flood I'll go if
[2:08:47] it's over mountains I'll go because he
[2:08:49] won't leave you there remember the
[2:08:51] destination is not the trial the
[2:08:53] destination is Glory Hallelujah you got
[2:08:56] to remember that always remember that
[2:08:59] yes sir amen hallelujah
[2:09:03] now he says
[2:09:06] in he says now he says in James 5:10
[2:09:10] take my brethren the prophets who have
[2:09:12] spoken in the name of the Lord for an
[2:09:14] example of suffering Affliction and of
[2:09:16] patience Glory behold we count them
[2:09:19] happy which
[2:09:20] endure ye have heard of the patience of
[2:09:22] Job and have and have seen the end of
[2:09:25] the Lord that the Lord is very pitiful
[2:09:27] and of tender Mercy amen so he say take
[2:09:30] these things as examples they they were
[2:09:34] they suffered Affliction but they didn't
[2:09:36] stay in the Affliction remember the
[2:09:39] remember the uh Hebrews 11 it says they
[2:09:41] all died in faith receiving not the
[2:09:43] promise we about so it doesn't matter
[2:09:45] ultimately what state we are when we go
[2:09:48] as long as we're in faith amen it
[2:09:50] doesn't matter day by day what may be
[2:09:52] happening around us as long as we are in
[2:09:54] faith amen
[2:09:57] amen
[2:10:00] now I want to go to let's go to 2 Samuel
[2:10:05] 22 let's read this
[2:10:07] together all these things are but for a
[2:10:10] season
[2:10:12] yes believe me amen amen you weren't
[2:10:16] always you're like childhood was a
[2:10:18] season yes young adult middle age
[2:10:21] wherever you are it is but a season good
[2:10:24] times are but a season bad times are but
[2:10:26] a season amen and God is Not Afraid
[2:10:30] remember if he led you through if he's
[2:10:32] your Shepherd he does not lose one sheep
[2:10:35] yes amen he doesn't he doesn't take you
[2:10:37] through a great big Ravine and it gets
[2:10:40] too bad and and he climbs up and leaves
[2:10:42] you
[2:10:42] hanging true amen he's a if if he is
[2:10:45] your Shepherd amen amen amen I there's
[2:10:48] got to be something in you saying the
[2:10:49] Lord is my shepherd
[2:10:52] amen and if he will he will lead me and
[2:10:55] he will not leave
[2:10:57] me
[2:10:59] amen you say Lord you may say well I
[2:11:02] don't know where I'm going you got to
[2:11:03] trust the shepherd you got to trust the
[2:11:05] shepherd as I said a while I don't know
[2:11:07] when it was but remember a sheep doesn't
[2:11:09] have the brain of a of of the shepherd
[2:11:12] does he the Sheep think like sheep has
[2:11:15] grass here's whatever whatever they
[2:11:17] think about I don't know but they they
[2:11:19] must think about something yeah and the
[2:11:21] shepherd He got a human mind he's
[2:11:24] looking at his sheep looking at the
[2:11:25] condition of his sheep how many sheep
[2:11:26] there are where are the Lambs where are
[2:11:28] the use you know uh where's where's
[2:11:31] better pasture what's the quality of
[2:11:32] this pasture here I need to move them
[2:11:34] here tomorrow you know maybe they need
[2:11:35] to be dagged or whatever it is you know
[2:11:37] he's looking at those things I mean you
[2:11:40] understand so he's looking Beyond but
[2:11:41] the Sheep is just grass I don't like
[2:11:44] that grass this is good you know walking
[2:11:46] around there's Bob there's Jim how you
[2:11:48] doing bear you know walking around
[2:11:50] that's that's different
[2:11:51] thinking but if the sheep can have
[2:11:54] confidence of this guy on two legs that
