========================================

for good morning everyone morning good morning Saints good morning God blessed people and uh I'm happy I'm excited to be here amen it's wonderful to see all your faces it's wonderful to see young children grow and um yeah we we were talking in the in the car on on the way here um about the verse I think they did last week the younger ones um around do not hinder the children coming to me and trying to explain that and say well we're all children we all Jesus he's he's our father and uh we are all children they are our children we we're Guardians over them and uh but in the end there's only one one God one one father for us amen um that's right I don't know who listened to the um this why not why not me why not now um it struck struck a cord with me I think with a lot of people um and my mind wondered at the point where is it brother Cadre is that what you say um talk about talk about David and he's on his way to uh to meet this giant and uh I was I was thinking because now I heard I I need to do the the songs this week I was thinking you need to create an atmosphere and I think David was you know at the stream and was picking out his Pebbles and it was interesting that it was five Pebbles and faithless spout with five letters and stuff like that so I was thinking ah he's picking it up and the enemy is just there you can see them but would he would he would have would he have stand there and panicked would he have stand there and created that atmosphere that um called upon that anointing to come over him and say what do I do or and and we know he was a great musician so he I think he either prayed or he sang a song and I think he was picking up his pebles and he was looking at that would it be big enough but while he's doing that he he was probably whistling he was probably um doing something like um As the deer panth at the water you know um creating an atmosphere and going into that that rest and that peace to say I'm not Fe I'm not fighting this enemy it's God that's fighting it for me and um and with and like the same song that we well the song that we will start today what a mighty God we serve he might have might have say that who knows um but it was just wonderful cuz he was I think he was he was at peace um with the Enemy just on the other side of the stream I think he um he he created that that right atmosphere so and um what I wanted to get to is he was he was Serena to God he was he was giving he was was worshiping in all his Strife or well it seemed like Strife around him he was he was worshiping God he was enjoying um to spend time with God doesn't matter about his surroundings or atmosphere um well he created the atmosphere so what we are doing here today the musicians in front and hopefully you can keep this thought is we're not cating to you we and and you are not sitting there waiting to be sermonized is that a word we we need to serenate to God we need to all get up have your have your moment here and doesn't matter about the atmosphere and anything goes around you who who's had a tough week I've had a tremendous tough week um but then at the end of it retrospectively you go back and say well this is a tremendous week Satan just couldn't keep me alone he just didn't want to you know have that have that nearo walk to uh or try and prevent that near walk to him so before I'm babbling on too much let's open up and pray and pray thank you Jesus that we can have this wonderful privilege to to drive here in a sunny day Petrol in our tank to come and to come and get some Petrol in our

come in such a way this morning Lord Jesus that the service would leave human hands father and would go completely into the supernatural Lord Jesus and that lives change Lord that any channels that are in people's minds or hearts Lord that have been blocked blocking them from prayer or blocking them from healing or blocking them from worship father or Lord that these things would be driven away Lord that the Devils would be annihilated father Lord that have been hounding and hassling and troubling and battering and and Lord I pray father that this morning would be a mighty Deliverance father to your bride Lord Jesus and myself included father for Lord we are a needy people father and we find ourselves Lord Lord each day father Lord being in a battle father and Lord I I pray father the Lord that you would equip us father with some some spiritual equipment father to fight this battle with you Lord Jesus knowing Lord that the enemy is defeated father and he can only Bluff and father I

hallelujah thank you musicians Hallelujah I trust that our lovely technical department is able to uh find my yes praise the Lord for technology amen this morning we're going to um Minister on the on the on the um on a sermon called the greatest battle ever thought amen because you know you that great battle that you have and that we all have that's common to man and anyone that takes a stand Amen in this generation or any generation there's ever been they will fight the greatest battle otherwise they're just in it and they're just part of that enemy's Kingdom and they can just do what they like and it's pretty easy and they go through all sorts of things but for you and for me and for those that make a stand in their day for the I am for the everpresent God for those that make a stand there is a fight hallelujah amen and so I called this the greatest battle ever thought is exposed now we're going to expose this we're going to expose the enemy and we're going to expose in a positive way the provision of the Lord and how it applies to us because we need change in our lives amen we need channels cleared we need things unblocked amen we don't even we might think that we've got all of them unblocked but remember God sees deeper and he can go deeper and he can bring healing down in the depths Hallelujah and he will and this morning you're going to be healed with something this morning you're going to have channels unblocked Hallelujah is that your expectation amen hallelujah hallelujah let's turn our Bibles to um Romans 1:21 Hallelujah the subject this morning well I kind of just wanted to put it in a synopsis is the extent of the in Corruption of the entire world and the standoff between Michael and Lucifer raised Aging in the minds of humanity I know that sounds like a lot but really that's just sort of what we're going into amen let's just read because that oh sorry verse 21 Romans 1: 21-27 it says because that when they knew God they glorified him not as God neither were thankful but became vain in their imaginations remember we're dealing with the mind now this is how Satan gets in they became vain in their imagination and their foolish heart was darkened professing themselves to be wise they became fools there's the degradation of the in deluvian world right there in four four components they glorified him not as God when they knew him just like this generation is doing neither were they thankful amen then they became vain in their imaginations that's three and their foolish heart was darkened four the four stages of the anal luian degradation and you're seeing you're living in the middle of another complete repeat of what's happened there and it says here professing themselves to be wise they became fools and changed the glory of the uncorruptible god into an image made like corruptible man now that is what man that's religion and to birds and four-footed beasts and creeping things and wherefore God also gave them up to un cleanness through the lust of their own Hearts to dishonor their own bodies between themselves who change the truth of God into a lie and worshiped and served the creature more than the Creator who is blessed forever amen for this cause God gave them up to vile affections for even their woman did change the natural use into that which is against nature and likewise also the men leaving the natural use of the woman burned in their lust one to towards another men with men working that which is unseemly and receiving in themselves the recompense of their error which was meat let's turn to 2 Timothy 3 remember the extent of the enemy's Corruption of the entire world because this is a personal thing that we are dealing with and a and an exodus that we're coming out of and a Deliverance that's happening in our lives and we're all born with that in us and we actually live with that on us you believe it or not but you still wear this body and it's still got all that stuff in it amen and we spoke about on Wednesday how you've been given a jubilee you've been given dominion over that stuff but you need a feast on the body word of the son of man to give your soul a jubilee out of that so that you can tell that what to do and take control of your own Spirit otherwise you're a City built without walls and whatever comes in it just this big Highway in and out of your life causing you to do whatever the devil wants you to do but the word of God has come in this generation to give you discernment between good and evil so that you can discern the Antichrist spirit in your midst and he will become powerless against you right 2 Timothy 3:8 this know also that in the last days perilous times shall come for men shall be lovers of their own selves Covetous boasters proud blasphemers disobedient unthankful Unholy without natural affection they need something else to make them have affection truth Breakers false accusers incontinent fears despisers of those that are good traitors heady High minded lovers of Pleasures more than lovers of God having a form of godliness meaning this they go to church but denying power thereof from and the power is not just the anointing the power is the word the word has the power in it the word has the original life in it that will bring you back to the original life that will transform you not just the anointing because you can go to Pentecost you can go to charismatic and have an anointing a genuine anointing and see Supernatural That's not the power of God that's the blessings of God these people are denying the transforming power of the word to transform them even the words that you're hearing this morning which are the words of God has got the power inside it to transform every part of your life and that's God's provision for you Hallelujah whether it comes from my mouth any ministerial mouth you're the word of God when you're listening to the prophet when you're reading the Bible when it's the transforming power of the word the expectation we have when we hear it will change what how it affects our life if we just listen to it as information to get more intellectual understanding that's all you will get but if we realize there's power inside there to change us am we will receive that transformation lovers of pleasure more than lovers of God having a form of godliness but denying the power thereof from such turn away now as janny's and jambre withstood Moses so do these also resist the truth oh sorry I skipped a few verses now as Janny I skipped to eight now as Janes and jambre withstood Moses so do these also resist the truth men have corrupt Minds reprobate concerning the faith amen just finally now from Daniel 12 to draw another a context because remember we're talking about the greatest battle this is this is no small thing this is no thing to just put it as a category in your life of of the message or that things that you're taught the battle in your mind is the foremost battle that you will face it's something that you should never neglect or never just think okay I'll deal with this deal with it first have God have that that's that's such an important thing in your life and is the pivotal point of your Victory to walk in this flesh is to understand and to receive the transforming power of God's Mighty power to deliver you and to raise you up so that you can have a good that you can work in this realm in this arena with the Enemy amen the the Bible says my people perish for lack of knowledge that word knowledge is an understanding of law an understanding in the court so meaning say say if someone doesn't understand a legal system and they're standing in court representing themselves and the devil's right there and he understands everything the prosecuting lawyer and he's got all these things that he's just using against you if you don't understand what you have you're just going to be he's going to be you're going to be powerless against him but if you can understand what you have he will be powerless against you because he has no legal right over you amen and you've received a message that's clearing everything that's ever been against your name and every complex that's been in your life every blockage and every channel in your life you've received a message that will clean all that out because the me you're hearing is the Original Seed of the word which is coming into your life and it's got the very spirit of God inside it to transform you Amen brother Brandon preached the transforming power of God the God's power to transform it's a good sermon have a listen as he's speaking about those things now let's read Daniel 12 1 and two and at that time shall Michael stand up th great Prince which standeth for the children of thy people and there shall be a time of trouble such as never was since there was a nation even to that same time and at that time thy people shall be delivered everyone that shall be found written in the book Let's just bow our heads father we thank you Lord and just pray you'd add your blessing to the reading of your word and father just draw a context from these scriptures and father just take us on a journey Lord we just want to hear from you whisper your your secrets into our ears father as it were for Lord we we are a needy people and I pray you'd have your way now Bless the people father May Lord our minds and our hearts Lord be focused May the children be settled and may we hear from Heaven this morning Father Lord and may we never forget Lord what we hear this morning may it be such a an awesome time with you father All Because Of You Lord we depend on you in Jesus Christ's name amen hallelujah normally I um you can have your seats sorry Hallelujah just want to take a a Sunday school this morning but more of an Evangelical Sunday school so there'll be a bit of reading a bit of quotes I just you know normally I only use maybe one quote and then we just keep going you know but I just want to read a little bit because the prophet says it so well I just I can't add to it I can't take away from it I can just say it as he says it and it's just been such a blessing do we have that clicker thing still right somewhere buried in the bags somewhere amen and God saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth and that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually and it repented the Lord that he had made man on the earth and it grieved him at his heart as it was in the days of Noah so shall it be when the son of man is being revealed who believes that the son of man is being revealed in this generation that Christ has come and he's revealing himself and he revealed himself in a prophet and then he took the prophet off the scene and he stayed he stayed and he's continuing to reveal himself through the message that the prophet brought see a prophet preaches differently than a minister a prophet preaches in seed form there are prophetic Ministries that also preach in seed form as well but it's it's a minor compared to how a prophet preaches and so the example we have is Jesus Christ when he preached you can take anything he said now and he and it sounds so simple it's very simple what he says he uses Parables and he uses seeds and he uses trees but you can take that now and preach 5,000 sermons from it more one little sentence what is seed says preaching seed now a prophet comes in this generation and he also preaches in seed form so that so that over the next 50 years things have been opening to us that we've never even seen and they didn't see back then and and and and and and the understanding is being enlightened because that same Lord Jesus is unveiling himself the son of man Ministry is being revealed the body word of the son of man is the feast that we have been gathered to where the carcasses the Eagles will be gathered this is our the in there is the power for our Exodus in there is the power for our Jubilee Jubilee from our s Jubilee from everything that we were born with cuz we were born with corruption we were born deranged derailed born in sin full of lies with a a path that was just going to take us into destruction and you can go to any denomination I'll tell you this now any denomination and you'll you'll just Plateau at a certain level you'll come out of that stuff and you'll just Plateau at a certain level you just can't go further you you just can't until finally you hear the word for your day that seed word the truth of the scripture will actually take you out of that deranged thought pattern and uncorrupt your mind and break spiritual Amnesia we are born not knowing who we are but one day we hear the eagle scream amen and when you hear that eagle scream it starts to sound familiar and now the remedy to break your Amnesia is is is sounding upon your ears and it's starting to break those things and you're starting to see those things and your mind is wrestling against it but the heart down deep is rejoicing in the waters of the word amen and then as you come into the presence of the Lord and you Fellowship in that presence he turns the water into wine and it starts to inebriate you amen it starts to make you feel good Hallelujah because that's the stimulation of Revelation Hallelujah he's starting to set you free he's giving you a transforming power to transform you from what you were covered in darkness a a seed of a lily down in the depths of a pond all murky and horrible and growing up through all of the creepy crawlies and finally you're going to come out and spread your petals amen and soak in the sun Hallelujah to come into the full strength sunlight so that you can photosynthesize the word of God and then you finally that channel where there's such a connection between you and God and he starts to clean everything out the sunlight is is an antiseptic the sunlight is a stain remover Hallelujah and the Bible many places and I'm just going to paraphrase it all that in every age light came forth light came forth light came forth but they were only one color of the rainbow and then finally in the last age all of it came forth and it became White see if you look at color science I guess you can call it light that all the colors together make white light now if you now we are we are beneficiaries of white light shining the white light now has the full capability to to to take all the stains away amen so now what we need to do cuz we're still a free moral agent we can walk below our privilege if we like God's not going to we still got in the Rapture if you if you've been filled with the Holy Ghost and you can walk and just struggle and be trampled on by every devil if you want you can choose that or you can choose now to open your petals to the Lord open your mind and let the word of God penetrate to penetrate right down because there's a spirit inside the word which is the spirit of God that will transform you you just need now in your own free moral agency to expose yourself to everything God has given with that we will go to slide two and just click it again sorry it's small you just never know way until you actually bring it up the importance of being placed by the anointed word see the word does everything we not going to cover everything but the word does everything right we can have our we can hang our soul upon the word of God and and not just the information now the power the life the very mind and will of God the motives and objectives and intentions of God our Father the father of our spirits to to to to accomplish now in in Isaiah it says that that the it's the intense devotion of God that will perform this he he's intensely devoted to his cause he says he will he will accomplish this Covenant and he will cause it with all of his heart and with all of his soul he's intensely devoted to your success to your Exodus to your Jubilee to your freedom amen and this is the age where he's clearing everything off hallelujah what a beneficiary we are amen we don't it's not that we pray more or enter in more or do more or study more or no more is that we are in an age where he's giving more we are beneficiaries of the final move of God's spirit to prepare us to change us to Rapture us off the Earth amen but now as we are in this and we can see these things and we have an expectation for these things and it's exciting but yet now we're walking in the natural and now we have a mind battle and now we are a great lovely group you know and it's wonderful but the devil is already at work and he's putting thoughts everywhere trying to put us back into stale mate that's like an old church with baggage he wants that again so now sermon this that's my burden is that we will he will be powerless against us we'll have discernment against the Antichrist Spirit we'll have love in our hearts and we will understand the Dynamics of the spiritual warfare sorry to use big long words but man I don't know how to say it anyway else he that has no rule over his own spirit is like a city that is broken down and Without Walls it's quite a quite a verse that he that has no rule over his own spirit is like a city that is broken down and Without Walls click again please Proverbs 16:32 he that is slow to anger and is better or is better than the mighty and he that rules his Spirit than he that takes a city it's a very um this place this is like the utopic place of a of a Believer to be in Dominion to be placed back in Dominion in your life not to to be tossed about by every wind of Doctrine tossed about by every thought that the devil just has a field day and places them on you cuz he's going to do that he's going to send an army every now and again he's going to fire 4,000 fiery darts at you now someone that is in this position they're going to that's going to be dumb of course it's never easy it's never Pleasant and every time a thought comes it's not just information that comes it's the spirit and the emotional attachment to the thought and when we realize that then we don't get condemned by feeling that way but you can deal with it straight away cuz it's not see it's not when when the devil starts giving you a thought of Discord or something that's going to try and Tackle down the atmosphere in the church you know when he starts to give you those thoughts or starts to make you feel condemned or unworthy or whatever you don't it's not just information going in your head it's the feeling of it you feel unworthy but doesn't matter how bad you feel it doesn't matter how much you feel what you're thinking that's normal you always do cuz a thought is a spirit you know it's a concept it's it's deep they can't even describe it you know I went on a website to try and find out what a thought is you know like what psychology world thinks and they they just can't describe it they cannot find the origin without going into spiritual uality they can't and even then they don't they they don't so it's it's it's deeper than we think that have thought Remember come we can take the thought back to God or we can take the thought back to Satan corruption okay so if we read this here says for though we walk in the flesh we do not war after the flesh for the weapons of our Warfare are not caral but Mighty through God Amen Mighty through God Amen to the pulling down of strongholds sometimes the devil gets in sometimes we get found we find ourselves with a couple of strongholds in us and now you're in a little battle and it feels like a really big battle you know and he's managed you you've let him in you stopped for a second you started reasoning With the Enemy you know because sometimes it feels good feels like you can justify what that person did and then you find yourself feeling bitter you know says be careful unless the root of bitterness rise up and strangle and start to strangle you down cause a stalemate cause a cause a glitch a breach in the fellowship but we have power Mighty through God now to pull down those strongholds amen if anyone's got a stronghold this morning it can be pulled down right here it can be pulled down Hallelujah just be sincere be transparent casting down notice in here there's a lot of uh verbs there's a lot of doing and expressions and actions it's not just Doctrine this is this is your Warfare here casting down imaginations and every High thing that exalts itself against the knowledge of God and bringing into captivity every thought to The Obedience of Christ and being alert to Revenge all Disobedience when you're dis when your obedience is fulfilled amen you go to the next one some of you have seen this before I sort of simplified it a bit just because there's too much writing on there before but what we have here this is you everyone's seen this brother has preached on it youve heard many sermons on it no doubt we are a soul we have a spirit and we live in a body that's right the soul is the person the spirit is and is is the Mind realm and the body is the vessel the house that you live in now this is a diagram that I have in my own way of understanding have the dove has flown into this person's heart they've been born again and and the Darkness is gone the snake has left the heart and the dove is flying in the heart now and that person has been set free and they've been walking with the Lord under the body word of the son of man the light of their age they're walking with the lord they're walking in the will of the lord they're in communion with the very present God not just a god of History not just a god of church or a god of Doctrine or a God of this or that but the person of Jesus Christ in his ex current expressed will the what he is doing the word he is fulfilling the lives that he's touching the program they are right up there with that bar where the Beats of the music is beating out in the symphony Hallelujah where the drums are going and where the violins are singing and where the where the where the obos are going amen where the clarinets are and the trumpets are blasting and the shout of the king is in the camp Hallelujah someone that's in that place can get to this utopic condition even though still covered in that Earth still covered in this flesh and it's still full of sin and it will always like sin and it will always enjoy looking at the pretty woman on the street it will always enjoy that horrible old stuff and fleshly things because it will never be converted that's right but because now the Dove's in there that Soul has been placed in its position that soul has been given Dominion amen over the spirit that person now can take rulership of their spirit and that Soul now with a discernment now because they got an understanding of God and an understanding of the word to how much the Lord reveals because we can only walk in what he's revealed really with power with conviction now that person now can have a clear memory Channel a clear conscience a clear reason a clear imagination a clear affection Channel That's controlled now by the soul that's not controlled by things that they hear not controlled by things that they feel not controlled by things that they taste smell or see now seeing and hearing is probably the the greatest offenders of our flesh smelling well you know always that bad tasting well you know sometimes it's pretty bad if you like me but but the hearing now the devil now uses these two channels a lot and he starts to bombard Humanity with his gospel with his preaching with his all the stuff that comes from him and we're going to go into this he starts bombarding your ears so the the concepts and the spirits that drive those things start to affect you and you wonder why you're having trouble with your thoughts you're wondering why you're struggling spiritually what are you listening to what what muck are you feeding into there you're wondering why that conscience is always always struggling and wondering why those imaginations are always coming and you're trying to pray and get down and the the thoughts are coming what is you're listening to what are these eyes seeing amen hallelujah the imagination clear the affections are clear that affection channel is a very bad offender you know you want to really get the Lord to really come in and and really start to clean these flu out and this morning the Lord himself is here if you've got any channels blocked he can he can f he can clear those out for you and he will clear them out for you you just lay it at his feet amen be sincere be transparent about it don't hide it you know and and you'll find yourself now coming and now because you see now why if if that's clear like that and those channels have got it they go They're not just a one-way channel in they're a channel out that's an expression of your spirit it's like a healthy home where the husband is connected with God and he he got a Godly character and you know and the wife is Happy Hallelujah the house is subdued amen happy in their place now there can be a communication now people can come and that wife is happy to have people around happy to have people because she she feels comfortable and secure the channels are clear amen the communication can be clear we can come around for fellowship and we can have glorious Fellowship because the channels are clear we can and not just for our own blessing or our own entertainment Fellowship is far more than entertainment Fellowship is is taking all the things that you've heard and coming with each other and talking about the Lord and and meditating on what you've heard and coming into Realms of of Glorious fellow Fellowship where we're talking about the Lord and then he comes near and and things that you didn't understand maybe click and it pieces together and the cogs start turning and the channels start clearing and you start communing with God hallelujah I've had wonderful times of Fellowship wonderful some of my most momentous Transformations have been in fellowship with people in my younger years still young but you know like very young when when you're still AWOL man you can imagine what I was like man I was just everywhere AB BR we were very excited about the message very excited but you know now the Lord starts to you know take that ambition or take that anointing and take that Zeal and start to channel it so that it become effective amen and some people it takes a bit more dealing than others you know because you just got you know it's just everyone's different everyone has their own different battles Hallelujah so this here is what we are attaining to let's go to slide four sorry you probably can't read that but I'll read it out says here now did you ever all of you has had this times that when you would think well I don't know whether it could happen or not and all at once something just tells you it's going to happen regardless of what anybody else says you know it's going to happen we've all had them experiences that's when your heart is thinking that's your heart telling you now the Mind reasons but the heart doesn't reason it just believes it if I could ever drive that home to one of my audience I'll have a real healing service if if I could ever get my audience to see that that it's not what your head thinks at all there's there's where the the devil abides but he reasons it out I'm sick I can't get well I got this or I can't be saved I've done this I've done too much see that's reason but we are to cast down reasonings that's right casting down our reasonings We Believe with our heart in the Garden of Eden man was divided in two Parts the devil took his head and God took his heart the devil makes him look at things and say well it just can't happen I can't reason it out and God took his heart to dwell in his heart to make him believe things that his head don't even know nothing about that's right so it's in your heart you think down here that's where the real certain sound comes from is from the heart there's where God talks and here's where the devil talks from up here he's pointing so let's cast down what the devil said and take a certain sound and that certain sound is God talking in our heart that's truth God's promises you know down here in the in the in the heart is where the is where is where your soul is and is where truth is and where you really believe and think now up here is the battle this is where good and evil starts coming now the heart will choose okay I'm going to download some I'm going to download all the good because now I've I've got an understanding of the word now I have a discernment now I can discern the Antichrist spirit I can discern this raging battle inside my head I can discern these things and and so I'm going to I'm you make a choice now I'm going to cast one out because I know that's the enemy so be not weary and well-doing Fain not when it's raging you address that enemy in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and you cast them down because he's trying to destroy you he's trying to discourage you he's trying to keep you from church he's trying to bring you down he's trying to keep you under this Corruption of this whole earth keep you walking in the frames of Hollywood but God rich in Mercy send you a message with a clear discernment between good and evil the word of God has come in your generation to divide Soul and Spirit to divide light and darkness again to give you a definition this is darkness and this is God hallelujah so that your heart now can reach into your mind and grab hold of the truth of God's word and become one with it and to take all the garbage that comes in on a daily basis that you see and hear and feel and past and all your conscience and all those things and cast them down and and and and discern between these things actively daily every thought amen you want to have a good Fellowship you want to have a good channel of communication Hallelujah maybe you're a dry old stick Hallelujah spiritually speaking maybe many years man has molded you on his lathe you know or or the devil's had you on a lathe till finally one day Hallelujah the high priest steps from behind the veil the Shak of Glory himself amen you come into that presence glory glory to God and and and and that stick starts to sprout branches amen hallelujah within 24 hours in the shakina presence you can be a fruitful tree again that people can pick from you that your leaves are stuck out again the stickers have unrolled no more P just spend time in that presence that is our inheritance that's what you can have that's what we do have Hallelujah because the high priest has stepped from behind the veil of man's Traditions the devil spent 2,000 years covering him up again Hallelujah but he said I won't have it amen just like the Romans try to seal off the Tomb in the old days hallelujah the Romans try to seal off the the Lord in the new days amen but one day a mighty angel came down and rolled away the stone amen so the shakina glory could spew out into your life Hallelujah so you could be affected amen so whatever Rod you might be feeling like you just spend time in that presence amen you'll start budding Hallelujah doesn't matter how much you'll be machined how much the the denominations machined your mind you spend time in that presence take the word of this message that you hear take it into the presence of God see what happens don't ever let the devil tell you you can't have a a glorious shakina presence prayer time in your life you can amen just ask just keep asking amen one day it'll happen hallelujah amen you might fight through it it might be a a Warfare that you face you just find out from the Lord hallelujah because that presence is our portion amen Hallelujah go to the next slide please how can you be a real Soldier out there see I want you to prosper in health that's what the Lord says I would above all things that you prosper and be in health am above all things it's out there brother brandom also says not in here but he says he goes I'm going to put this out here cuz it's quite a a statement and he says if you really believe that you are healed it's impossible not to be healed amen impossible to not be healed if you really believe it there's human belief and hoping and believing knowing the promises is true and you really believe it in your mind but now it takes God to Anchor the Revelation that he's going to do it anchor that in your soul it'll happen nothing will ever stop it amen hallelujah amen how can you be a real Soldier out there see I want you to prosper and be in health there it is right there those channels if you just get them opened up don't want to bypass them don't bypass them don't just live with a a semi-opened mind don't just live with semiopen channnels if you know there's some things in there bring it to the altar bring it to the Lord allow him to clean you to cleanse you to open those channels so that you can be a Divine expression without any hindrance without nothing in the fiber optic cable you know you put a bit of dirt in the fiber optic cable it's going to cause big problems because the light needs to be perfect and he wants to make you a perfect fiber optic connection so that everything that he's shining has got no Distortion amen that's what this message has come to give you is a distortion free connection and communication and expression of the almighty God Amen that's what he come to clean out your mind to help you to understand and to think right you'll come out all right then if Satan can get through there get by these conscience and all these other things then he gets right down here at the end of the soul and the mind now if he can just get you you'll never look at one of them until first you have to let him in there you have to let him in then when he gets in he's got control then what does he do he begins to use the conscience he begins to use this begins to use this Outlet what is it see taste feel smell hear imaginations conscience memory reasons and affections what we show showed in that diagram he starts to get a stronghold and he starts to control these things and make you feel this way get you roots of bitterness and and feel down and and be tossed around and and in and out and up and down and all through and not stable but I can tell you that Jesus Christ himself is here as the wheel and the wheel and he is your stabilizer he will stabilize you amen it's a oh my what's that Hallelujah there's a it's called a oh man what's that stabilization it's it's um it's it's gyroscopic stabilization Hallelujah that's the best technology that's here now these big boats have it to stop people feeling sick you know and that's what we've got hallelujah amen we've got the Lord himself the very wheel in the wheel The Hub he's come himself in this generation because the boisterous seas are perilous and we read and we saw the picture painted of this dark world and all the things that's going on there's no if you read that if anyone reads that and believes that without reading the grace and without knowing the provision they're going to feel doomed they're going to feel like wow there's no point I'm finished the world is through it's stuck in a sea and everywhere you swim is Darkness every Church you go to is Darkness it's just all hopeless and that's what it is gross darkness is upon the people upon everywhere but Hallelujah the Lord himself has descended amen hallelujah he's descended and he's given you your own little Goan Hallelujah it might be so dark around you that you can see it and feel it Hallelujah but in your little little Mansion Hallelujah in this Mansion here amen it's a little bit you know it needs to be glorified but inside here is a Goan and inside your house is a Goan Hallelujah he's given you an anointing in this generation to walk above those things and so you can read all those things and then you can say but God but God hallelujah rich in Mercy amen has given us a Liberation from these things he given us a jubilee has given us spiritual food in due season to raise us up into position again amen that's why we can listen to these things i' like to make it practical what can we do listen to the message realize what it's doing to you amen realize it transforming power in your life to give you Jubilee above these things there's no point in preaching about all the stuff and not going or what can I do that's what you can do the reason I'm preaching these things is so that you can have an expectation when you are listening to it cuz all the stuff comes from here hallelujah this is so good it's amazing because here the Lord wants us to be in Jubilee He wants us to be liberated from all of this stuff and to have hope and to have faith and to have understanding what is it C taste F smell hair imagination conscious memory reason affections he begin to use all those different little channels as long as he could get in above this one here he's got to come in your mind first and you have to accept it so the fiery D comes in it's a little concept and Hy won't make it too outrageous just be believable all a sudden you start to reason you stopped that's where you went wrong you don't stop you have to deal with it straight away doesn't matter how good it sounds or feels to your flesh I wouldn't be led by my flesh cuz when it feels good in the flesh it's got to be it's not always good amen hey if it's food it's okay if it's Bri it's good no okay um so listen as mine first and you have to accept it listen it can batter against you but it can't get to you until you accept it when Satan walked up to Eve and said you know the fruit's pleasant she stopped for a moment oh that's when she made a mistake when she stopped for a moment don't stop for nothing you've got the message Jesus Lives God's A Healer that's the message don't stop for nothing no reasonings nothing else but she stopped for a moment that's when Satan walked right into that mind said well it sounds reasonable oh don't do that just take what God Said Amen take what he said slide six please and the next Ephesians 41:3 the whole Ephesians is just beautiful and we if you read that you'll read our journey that we're in we're sort of around verse 26 I think or you know right where it's all starting to work together where all the joints are supplying why because we have endeavored to keep the unity of the spirit in the bonds of Peace a church can have and will have those that are born of the spirit have got Unity but the devil can come in there and take the peace he can remove the peace he can bring fussing and even though you're born again can live down here like I said before below privilege or now because but the Lord's not going to allow us to live under there he's preparing a bride for a Rapture he's preparing a people to take them off the Earth he's not going to settle for us sitting down there he's going to he's going to brood over us amen he's going to rear us up and nurture us hallelujah so that we can come into our position amen so that our minds can come and be clear of all these things so that we can express the very Divine Expressions of God what is the greatest Divine expression of our age is a Rapture amen what a Divine expression he's going to bring us there you know being confident of this very thing that he which began a good work in you shall continue it unto the day of Jesus Christ you just remember back when you're under a barriage of fiery darts just remember back when he did that for you or he did this for you and you say get out of here devil get out in the name of Jesus Christ he has to listen he hates it he hates it when the church knows who she is he hates it when you realize that you've got authority over him you don't have to work it all up and get all Angry sometimes you do but you just have to he just has to listen to you amen I therefore the prisoner of the Lord I just thought that's key that he puts that in there this is this is this is liness and humility and it's the key absolute key for a harmonious Fellowship of human beings that are in these bodies born again but in these bodies in these Minds I therefore the prisoner of the Lord plead to you that all of you walk worthy of the vocation wherewith you are called with all loneliness and meekness with longsuffering forbearing one another that word forbearing is to put up with you got to put up with each other we got to put up with our Humanity put up with failures put up with mistakes put up with with maybe someone says the wrong thing sometimes you know they're having a bad day or or maybe they didn't really mean it the devil will actually magnify it you know and and really in all cases we have to give the benefit of the doubt if you don't give the benefit of the doubt you're going to just go right down a spiral of bitterness and crit ISM and critical a critical spirit forbearing one another in love amen hallelujah you know when you have when you're in a a family situation and you you you know all the faults and you know all the issues and and and things can annoy you but to have a harmonious sibling you know like group you have to forbear each other you just have to you know the closer you are you forbear each other you and and so here now say here endeavoring that is with all that's within you to keep the unity of the spirit in the bond of Peace because now in this atmosphere he's painting this picture here because now if you read Ephesians 4 which you should um you'll see him unfold the very Journey that the church takes right up into the full image of Christ right up until she leads the Earth Hallelujah this very Ephesians Amen brother brandom said we are in our Ephesians amen what is Ephesians what is the whole it's coming out of the Wilderness and into the promised land and being given your inheritance hallelujah we're in the age where all of our inheritance has been bequeathed through our Joshua brother brandham he's bequeathed it all to us but to be able to take possession of these things there needs to be there's all these enemies in our own life that needs to be overcome and now the Lord Has Come himself into our very life personally to us to subdue all the enemies in our lives amen amen to give us our inheritance little by little as we mature in the Lord as we mature and have the maturity to handle the power of Freedom the power of Freedom you see when you're completely free and there's no things blocking you you'll be a manifested Son of God speaking words into existence if you need to fully free fully in everything that God's given you and there's nothing to hold you back but do you have the character to handle that at the moment could you handle that we all say amen amen but the Lord knows he knows just well amen and so little by little he will drive out all these things out of our life little by little he'll clear that channel little by little he'll remove that complex little by little he'll remove that scar that's down deep in your spirit that you don't even know it's there and you wonder why you you you're affected by certain circumstances and and it and it breaks you or it makes you excited and in ways you don't want to be excited or whatever it may be you wonder these things but the Lord eventually as you unfold your petals to the sunlight just eventually it starts to deal with you and starts to wash you starts to turn the water into wine and and you start to become free you know he's really at the moment we're we're stuck on we're we're right involved with this world but very shortly very soon you know the the Lord's going to allow the devil to squeeze us right off the tree of knowledge right out of the dependency on money and dependency on society so that we're 100% dependent on him but because we are dependent on society it affects us we're out there we're doing things that interact we're interacting with these people we're being affected and our thoughts being affected by all these things amen but one day we will be free completely from those things Hallelujah so here now for us in the fellowship because it's so important as brother said you're all one big sweet group now but you wait the devil wants to get you he wants to destroy our Harmony destroy our Unity wants to bring us down he wants us to hate each other he wants us to be angry with each other he wants us to have bitterness he wants to take the unity of the spirit out of the bonds of peace and make a fighting family with baggage and problems and people leaving and when people come in they don't they feel oh this is not a very good atmosphere what's wrong what ministers come through why can't they preach but we have something so real now amen let's keep that let's Endeavor with all that's within us Amen to to to to cast down imaginations and cast down reasonings and all everything that exalts itself and when the fire comes on Amen these six things does the Lord hate yay seven are an Abomination unto him a proud look a lying tongue and hands that shed innocent blood and heart that devis us Wicked imagination feet that be swift to run into Mischief a false witness that speaketh lies and he that sth Discord among Brethren amen now now don't feel condemned when you get thoughts of Discord it's not you it's the enemy every time 100% of the time it's the enemy every time it's what you do with it and you're going to now take that thought and let it sew into your heart and then take that into the fellowship and you're going to let the demon now start to affect the person that it's about and then all of a sudden Bridge a dark a dark bridge between the two people and then the demon starts to get a foothold in the church and then it starts happening to more till it's just a cloud and the people can't even hear the pastor they're all critical about them you know that's what can happen can get like that then we need to just we need to be very careful don't be fearful don't be scared about it just deal with it straight away you will notice when those thoughts come and you say Satan get out of here in the name of Jesus Christ you will feel the change in the atmosphere it's a demon and he wants to do that and he will continue they don't care they don't spend their energy they just keep going and going and going and going even anything to be thoughts of unbelief the thoughts wondering about stuff as soon as it's contrary to the word in the slightest way in the name of Jesus Christ I cast you out Satan gone changes I've been through many many and this changes things very fast he must listen but now this is the this is that's that's rarely the Crux of our Victory now says to him them that received him Jesus Christ gave he power and authority to become the sons of God to to to stand your ground amen hallelujah to to hold and stand fast in the Liberty where Christ has made us free and be not entangled again in the Yoke of bondage amen but to take us stand as a Mighty Men of Valor as Daughters of Valor Amen to make a stand who will make a stand Hallelujah we you we are rugged we're not raised up in a hot bed plant we're not raised hydroponic amen we're raised in the planted by the rivers of Living Water you're on a good diet strong with vitamins hallelujah amen God can really use us amen he will use us as a group you know we are all always dealing with the individual but we don't really hear much about the group you see it takes because really God doesn't save a group but he saves a group of Saved individuals you know what I mean so when a group of Saved individuals who are walking in that place free from these things and have discernment man there's a group you become a tool for God hallelujah hallelujah as a group a local vision completely free from all these things and trappings Hallelujah God can use us as a group to do all sorts of things let's be open to the Lord for what he wants to do with us as a people that are individually free Hallelujah go to the next slide please here's an example of loneliness I just thought I'd put this in here it is in the greatest battle ever fought and it's the opening comment and I thought well well brother brandham doesn't he doesn't just there's always a reason for these opening comments that he makes in his sermons and you think oh he's just having a just you know talking to the people and sometimes he might be that many times there's some key things in there and this is one of them in the greatest battle ever fought which is basically sort of the lines I'm preaching on says here we have just come back couple of the trustees here at the church and myself was out in Arizona and we went out really to have a meeting at Phoenix with brother sheret at his Tabernacle but when I found out that a brother was in town having services in a tent well then I felt a little reluctant about holding a meeting I thought maybe I would have it on the Sunday afternoon so that no one would be bothered in their churches see this see this character he's not wanting to be like cuz he's the seventh Church age messenger man like the he's got this Mighty message that can that that's that's just so major like more just as major as Moses and all these great prophets and yet the character you know a lot of people will be like I'm the man everyone should stop for me you know the whole city should stop all the churches they they're better off coming to me you see this brother here he just wasn't like that wasn't like that it's such an example for us amen such an example doesn't matter how great you think you are or that you don't think you are God you know and this is character I think man it's amazing I thought maybe I would have it on the Sunday afternoon so that no one could be bothered in their churches but find out that he had Sunday afternoon services also and I was a little bit worried about having a service and so we Brethren instead of going on through the day as we were out hunting we went into the City and got ready and went to Brother Allen's Services brother AA Allen was having services so we went to the services and brother Allan preached a mighty sermon we had a good time listening to brother Allan hearing the singers and so forth how they sang and shouted and had a great service and then we seen all along the road the hand of the Lord where wherever we went the Lord Jesus would meet with us and there's something about being out to yourself out in the deserts man you know that's the result of loneliness and meekness loneliness and meekness that doesn't mean weak and like a jellyfish this is just a character preferring one another amen it's something that you know we can all grow in of course amen amen especially me I'm the chief chief grow need I I'm the chief of all un loneliness I need it amen but you see now the Lord is dealing with us dealing with us all and because he is dealing with us all forbearance and love is so important you know it's so important because that's to maintain the Harmony in the church to maintain that Spirit where we can end up in the vision of the Lord so while we're going there there is forbearance needed there is loneliness because you might have a great gift you might have a great anointing but to just go out there and try and be lonly the Lord the word of God does the plac thing the word of God don't be the opposite though and when he's calling or when he's moving you to do don't just be false humility now that's you know you got to find that balance and just let the Lord lead you and be and have courage step out in faith step out for the Lord these are all things it's all related to thoughts cuz see we have to discern now the motive and objective if God starts calling us to Something Search Your Heart what's your motive why do you want to do it what's in there what's the motive of that thought that's coming to you if it's to please people then bring it before the Lord but if it's to please the Lord and to bless people or to to to help it's just finding these motives and and you know I'm I'm guilty of bad motives and we're all guilty of bad motives you know like we've all had them and do them but as as you fail more you know you start to realize and the Lord starts to deal with you and operate deeply because those motives and objectives those really is the root of all of our actions amen let's just carry on here let's go to slide eight I preached this before just before you know let the word penetrate says here God will heal you right in this atmosphere of the Holy Ghost where he sent you amen God will give it to you just believe it amen open up them flu a flu is like a chimney I guess a channel open up them flues of the soul and body now remember he preached us soul is Spirit he before the seals open the soul and the spirit was back the other way this just just terminology but just so that you realize the flu of the spirit and body the Mind senses and conscience and just let God's word penetrate first take that mind there's the Battleground not say well if I could feel it I'd feel the glory of God falling oh that has nothing to do with it not a thing open up that mind that's the Battleground there's where the Battle Set an array right here in the front line your mind open it up and say I doubt my doubts see the heart believes the word the heart believes the word up here doubts of course are going to come do you think the sarop phenician woman wasn't doubting that that the devil wasn't firing bares of thoughts across her you you didn't think that she fought for 10,000 of doubts you know and she had every reason to doubt because he called her a dog but something anchored deep down in her heart you know and she she just had to get to this guy this Jesus the son of David this Lord she had to get to him so regardless she didn't care the heart was set on a focused course amen set towards the provider the provision the Lord self the manifested word the message of the hour the heart the mind was going off the devil's taking field day on her firing 20,000 Devils arrows at her he hates you he doesn't care about you you know completely she didn't care something anchored in her heart amen she's going to get what she needs she had a daughter amen she was praying for she's going to hold on Amen until this daughter was saved Hallelujah till this daughter was healed amen doesn't matter how many doubts come how many bares of arrows she's going on because something's anchored in the heart amen she's going to get to the manifested word for her day amen hallelujah and he saw that Faith see great is thy faith Hallelujah for this saying go thy way thy daughter is healed amen I love that so much Hallelujah do you think right now when when when you're called out of Egypt you know you're called out of the world you're called out of religion and here you are you find yourself now trapped at the Dead Sea you know it's coming time you know you the Lord's placing on your heart to be baptized and then do can you imagine the thoughts that go and the barage of arrows in the in the mind but the heart's got something anchored in it the heart believes don't listen to what this says I doubt my doubts I'm doubting those doubts Hallelujah because those doubts is just the devil cast them away cast them away fight through that barriage take that step take that step of Faith be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for he will promise to give you the Holy Ghost and so you get baptized and now you're in the wilderness don't you think Israel struggled with thoughts man that wasn't just them those days it wasn't just them being ungrateful there was demon power attacking them making them doubt the Integrity of God making them think that Moses had just taking them out as a joke you know the devil was there firing the fiery darts into their minds because they didn't have any discernment they just believed it and became subject to every thought tossed about by every wind of Doctrine you know thinking that the baptism you know was just fruitless they should go back to Egypt and and and many people have gone back after being baptized because the devil just fires it all on them but fight through that doubt those doubts they're not even real they're just false it's just the devil what does the heart say you know and I've been I had nine months of unbelief when I first got saved just afterwards that I had to battle with and my heart believed the whole time but my mind was in such a Warfare and I didn't understand it and I couldn't I didn't know what to do every time I stopped praying it was like a a voice God is not real God is not real God is not real and I just it just about driv me crazy but because in my heart I believed it but I didn't understand this that's why I love preaching us so much that you can address the enemy I didn't know about addressing the enemy I was just always Lord help me Lord help me and he was just allowing me to go through this for character development till finally I heard this sermon the greatest battle ever in there the prophet says that anything that ever comes to you that's contrary to the word is the devil and that exposed them right there and he said Now cast down imaginations and and address the enemy in the name of Jesus Christ he has to listen so I said Satan the spirit of unbelief I cast you out in the name of Jesus Christ I'm casting down all these things and it was like an instant Deliverance completely free hallelujah amen because you see he's given us that Authority he says now speak to the children of Israel that they go forward amen hallelujah just keep going forward you will be baged with fiery darts right through your Wilderness experience right through your legal phase right through all of these things right through seeking all the gifts from the promised land and right through till you die to yourself and cross over Jordan amen receive the baptism of the the Holy Ghost and come under the headship of the Divine Captain so that now he can subdue every thought in your life he can subdue your spirit and your flesh Hallelujah because that's the very mainspring in your life that's the very Cog that you need for victory is the very Lord himself the very descended Captain with the sword drawn to cut your enemies away to cut them all down amen he is a personal pronoun in your life not just an anointing not just an experience with God but God himself that is the message of the hour is the very Lord himself in your life he's come in other Generations in a portion but in the last days mezc himself would be revealed to his bride personally in each life not just through a prophet 960s amen but personally to the bride amen not just coming and standing upon the sea and upon the Earth as a general age but but coming to stand in your life as a personal God as the very Living everpresent God who's expressing himself now to deliver you to raise you into your position to give you dominion over this flesh and over this body Hallelujah so that you can Reign Victorious and while you're reigning here he's training you to rule and Reign a thousand years over Humanity in the millennium Hallelujah you're on training ground he's training you Hallelujah he's got confidence in you amen he's got confidence in himself in you amen that takes the pressure off a little bit amen cuz you know we can't do this it's not in us to do it we we need to be led by the spirit of God hallelujah at every step amen glory to his name amen oh just let God's word penetrate first take that mind that's the Battleground not say well if I could feel it I'd feel the glory of God falling oh that has nothing to do with it not a thing open up that mind that's the Battleground there's where the battle sits an array right here in the front line your mind open it up and say I doubt my doubts amen I'm doubting my doubts now I'm believing God word I don't care what's going on up here I believe God's word I might not feel like I believe God's word but I believe it anyhow amen you hold to that because it's in the soul the soul doesn't have feelings Hallelujah but when that Soul when you start to just believe the word what's happening is the soul now is going to come into its position and now you're going to find it easier not not I shouldn't say easier because the battles just get more and more and he starts to have more confidence in you and he starts to put allow more confidence in you so that you can go through deeper and harder trials because he's got a character to develop in you and he's going to beat you out till you become a reflection of him till the gold is tried clear as Crystal amen reflecting the very light of the king amen I'm believing God's word regardless of what's going on up here down here it's true it's true absolutely the truth if you can have that Anchored In Your Heart every promise in the Bible is mine every chapter every verse every line I'm trusting in his grace Divine every promise in the Bible is mine amen hallelujah here I come Satan something's going to take place sure it will yes sir next slide please ruling and training your spirit now that your soul has been placed now that you've got Dominion now that you've heard the word now that the trumpet sounded over your life and the shouts come and the walls have fallen down and you're free to marry the king you know you you'll be set free now you can see you're a bride you can see you're a coming queen Hallelujah you can see the grace of God transforming your life you've come into your position Hallelujah now it's time you know he wants us to let the spirit needs to come to subjection in love deal in Love Don't torment yourself don't torment the wife inside you the spirit the feminine attribute of your life the wife in the house don't torment your spirit just do it in love do it in love gentle let the spirit of God do it this what we call life now is only a shadow or a negative we all like to Rejoice this is very key here now just attention deeply on this this is like this is one of the major thoughts of this whole sermon because it's so important now as we live in this world full of stimuli full of Satan's attacks that's what we call life now is only a shadow or a negative we all like to Rejoice but we can Rejoice over the right thing that shows that we're hooked up with the real thing when we Rejoice over the right thing but when we Rejoice over the wrong thing it shows we're hooked up with the wrong thing so our life can tell right now what we are which way our emotions are running I'll just repeat that so our life can tell right now what we are which way our emotions are running do you see if we're rejoicing over the world and the evil things our minds and our souls are inspired by below Boogie WGY rock and roll bgs all that sort of rubbish you know just music of the world anything that's not given by God is is in here basically very very very few artists are not inspired by Satan that AR inspired by God actually you can either be inspired by one or the other there's no middle ground Boogie wogie dances heartaches drinking and all these other things that we run after it's from below but if we rejoice in the spirit that we have eternal life and we raise our emotions to God Amen do you raise your emotions to God when you worship are you feeling love towards God are you you got an emotion about it are you emotional to your king does he make you cry with joy not that you have to cry not you know everyone's built differently but but are you is it just a a feelingless thing that you're doing as a as a Duty or is it something you feel is if it's just a Duty or if you're just struggling with it there's a channel blocked this morning can be cleared amen right here amen hallelujah right now amen hallelujah we raise our emotions to God and praise him then we have have joy then we have joy Jesus said I that your Joys might be full see he's the creator of Joy he's the creator of Serotonin and dopamine and all those chemicals that make you feel happy he's the creator of this body he wants your spirit he wants your spirit to be so clean and so healed so that it can produce the right chemicals in your body you can be with natural affection you don't have to take drugs to feel happy you don't have to take drugs to to feel free because your spirit is healed he doesn't he wants to deal deep down heal those things hallelujah amen it says earlier way earlier don't overlook these things don't overlook thoughts in the whole thing just remember now he's the creator of Joy amen you know he went to Calvary because he he saw us we the joy that was set before him now he's turning that because see he wanted it back he didn't just want to be the joy he didn't just want us to be the joy he wanted to become the joy that set before us he wanted to be he he wants it to be the reason why we take up our cross why we sacrifice our life for the king because he's the joy that is set before us you know he's the he's the underlying overlying every Ling motive you know man in every part of our Lives the the principal theme of our life The Joy set before us it depends but not full of the perverted life but full of eternal life above so you can see it depends on what you look at now just for an instance for the psychology part of it psychology the the prophet said it you know there's a lot of people are a bit funny about psychology you know but the there is a psych there's a truth to psychology there's a truth to it it's not just all mind of man God has psychology he created the mind he created all these things he created feelings he created the spirit now he wants to give us an understanding of the very spirit that we're to take control over now before I go any further I want to show you that when your soul is in harmony with God when your soul is placed and God is at the head of you your spirit will eventually come into subjection your spirit will eventually be all healed it'll eventually be all cleared out eventually because this is the age where he's doing everything other ages gone by we can't we don't have anything to say they had their day they had their light they had their revivals but in the end time it's time to clear the title it's time to clear everything because the church is going to come to her perfect place so because of that he has to clear all these things so now he raises the soul of man back into its position then the spirit of man starts to come clean starts to all clean out starts to all become in harmony now the body because the spirit now is responsible for producing the right chemicals in the body the spirit is responsible for the chemical reactions thank you brother for the chemical reactions in the body the spirit now when based on what you're seeing based on what's happening around you based on the circumstance in this room based on you're in you you might be in a in a in somewhere I don't know like in a in a circumstance where it's a it's a different situation and you're sitting there and you're wondering deep down this it's just troubled and everyone else is just sitting normal and you're troubled and you don't know what it is I can tell you I don't know what it would be because this is all hypothetical but there will be a breach in your spirit deep deep deep down and it's and it's something that's happened to you or something you've inherited that's in there and you react differently to the situation than other people might and that needs to be dealt with so what's happening is that little breach in there is pouring out adrenaline into your body and your body feels adrenaline and you feel start shaking and you start and you wonder what's going on you physically feeling something here and you're sitting in the situation you think you're weird you're wondering what's going on your spirit is producing these kles for for no reason seemingly but Something's Happened deep down and it needs to be dealt with that's like an Aaron's rod and it needs to come into the shakina it needs to come and kneel down before the Lord and that shakina will start to brood over you and bring healing right there Hallelujah you might just be kneeling down you might be just washing the dishes one morning one night putting the dishwasher in and all of a sudden Boom the Lord is there boom that's what it is cuz you're walking with him you're walking with God he's dealing with all these issues he's dealing with all of these things so now he wants to throw your body into balance he wants to throw this physical body now into balance so that we when you are in this situation it reacts Godly so that when you're in this situation it reacts Godly it reacts in a certain way it's balanced you know and I remember before I was a Christian and all of that I needed to take drugs I needed to take substances to feel balanced I don't know I don't know why I was raised normal everything I guess I mean every every parent has their issues and stuff especially in the world you know but I just felt like what is what's the point of life if you needed take all this stuff to feel happy or not that I didn't feel happy but I wanted to always feel really happy you know I wanted to be really in you know like really completely intense and like partying and just going hard hey you know and it's it's just now because see because of that there was a imbalance my spirit was having all sorts of troubles so it was not producing the right chemicals all the time but I came in connection with the the very creator of this Spirit of this body and so now my soul gets placed in its position now the spirit comes into Health the spirit comes into Harmony and now she starts to keep the home well she starts to look after the house she feels happy she can communicate with people she's not feeling withdrawn from a situation she can raise her hands in church now she's healthy she's got a good headship amen amen hallelujah the soul is in communion with God the wife comes into subjection the house is kept hallelujah amen that's not just a natural this is the spiritual in our life the soul is the husband the spirit is the wife and the house is the body and now there's Harmony now you feel balanced and I remember when I met the Lord for the first time in my life I just felt balanced you know I just felt like I'm content just content without substance hallelujah amen but always there's a longing there's a deep calling to the deep but now there's a there's a real deep to answer to that it's not some chemical that Satan made in a lab but it's God himself The Giver of Joy Hallelujah so my emotions now have been turned towards the the the king turn towards that deep Hallelujah to that's going to draw my heart out to him it's going to draw me it's going to give me a jubilee from all this hallelujah it's going to give me a Rapture amen amen hallelujah let's move um hold on still got a bit to read on here so now now just for instance for the psychology part of it psychiatric now let's notice just a moment this psychic view here is the picture of Christ and here is an electric fan two pictures it depends I think he's got it in his church maybe he's pointing to them says it depends on which one I look at see if my emotions is moved this way or if my emotions is moved this way if I look at that and long for that and desire that my emotions are set towards the fan but if I look this way and my desire is set that way that's the reason Jesus said whosoever lookth upon a woman to lust after her has committed adultery with her already in his heart see it's where your emotions is set where your thoughts is next slide next yep if ye then be risen with Christ seek those things which are above where Christ sth on the right hand of God set your affection on things above not on things on the earth and I've written there set your emotions right for what do we covet what are we looking after what does the devil do he sends you flyers and brochures all the time barrages your mailbox what is he doing to you you're reading through it you don't really need the stuff but you're reading and I do it I read through it thinking it might stimulate something that I need you know I might have forgotten something and I want and so you just start thinking in these things and you wonder why you start getting lust problems you wonder why you start getting Covetous cuz now you're wanting things that you don't have all the time you're setting your emotions on things that you don't have you're setting your emotion on things that you don't need your your emotions start to become covetousness it's bad we we want to be content you know and when God gives us a need hey we got to be balanced of course you know when you see that Ferrari drive past you go man that's the nice car I'll never have it amen I'm sure you know we don't want to be robots or anything but but there is a but to cover say if you you become a fixed on it you know and you and you're always oh man I wish I had one of those and your your emotions are set towards it you're going to start drawing towards covetousness you're going to start drawing towards things that you can't have and it all links together there scriptures in James it says it actually starts to lead to U like complete real bad you if you start getting Covetous for things so transfers not just to like inanimate objects and things it transfers to wives of neighbors and all sorts of things you can just it it it's covetousness is all linked together it's not just like things that are not you know like just standard items it leads into Contraband and things that are actually evil and detrimental to your soul so set your affections on things above not on things of the earth set your affections on Christ set your affections on what he's done for you set your affections on this message that he's given you to transform you to make you Rapture Ready to clothe you in the wedding garments Hallelujah that higy has has has given you the recipe so that when you walk before the king you are the reflection of the king Hallelujah set your affections on things above not on things of the earth you will keep him in perfect peace whose mind is stayed on you because he trusts in you you trust all of you in the Lord forever for the Lord Jehovah is Everlasting strength God give me strength hallelujah amen and now I've got we're nearly we're nearly closing few more slides hell is gearing up for a great onslaught of fiery darts and suen attempt to crush the bride and either keep her or place her in stalemate individually in family locally nationally and internationally he's they're gearing up we are the supernatural bride of Jesus Christ the the mystical Body of Christ that's us and we have a vision and the Lord has a purpose for each one of us amen and now there's coming a great attack a huge attack on the bride to crush her down but I'm standing before the provision that's going that's an exodus from these things and we as a group God has called us to do great things we're going to stand still and see the salvation of the Lord I'm looking at the arm of the Lord that's why he wants to clear your mind and give you discernment so that we can remain in this atmosphere he wants us to remain in this atmosphere and unlike any other age even in the message now because you know and I know that there's many message churches that are that are crippled that are that have been stalemated because of thoughts they didn't understand maybe I don't know but maybe now it's the program that churches have to come into an exodus of that it's come a time now where the church is made of individuals are coming out of that thing and they coming into and they're going to maintain a liberty am maintain Jubilee walking not on a plateau but walking up Hallelujah sometimes I feel like I'm going up amen hallelujah sometimes I feel like Heaven's come down amen so we're going right up everything that the first church went down from and left the first love and and had false Apostles coming in and all these things going on but finally now the very opposite is happening and we're walking right into our first love walking right into the very thing that has been prophesied over the church for 2,000 years 6,000 years being in the back part of God's mind preached by a prophet in 1963 he says I'm going to reach into the back part of God's mind and deliver to you what was in there that's the great Secret Of God who says that that's glorious some major things going on and so now we're coming into these things we are our beneficiary we become the arm of the Lord as a group now under that Divine Captain to free Rahab from his prison to free rabs all over the country from prisons to be an outreaching church with a vision am with Minds that are set on Christ with affections that are set on things above with dedication Men of Valor woman of Faith Hallelujah like David whenever a Goliath comes there's no way we're going to sit there and be scared hallelujah we're going to stand together amen because now there's discernment when a Goliath comes and sits in the middle you just draw that much closer together amen hallelujah draw closer together and eventually they'll either be converted or they'll leave amen hallelujah you just do that amen you always trust your pastor cuz God's called him and anointed him him to to lead through these things Hallelujah serious and we will face these battles he will not leave us alone and neither will the Lord forsake us hallelujah but we are an arm of the Lord God's going to use us in Mighty ways now we need to stand fast in the Liberty Hallelujah Stand Fast in the freedom amen and keep walking forbearing one another Hallelujah because we're all on a journey and those things that you were forbearing in 2 years time that won't even be there Hallelujah because we're going on an upward Journey hallelujah amen hallelujah I want to talk about how is this battle being waged waged how what is the devil doing mystery Babylon the mother of all Abominations mother of harlots and all Abominations everything that you see on this Earth is a result of mystery Babylon mystery Babylon is Satan's program Satan's kingdom it's Satan's setup there there's two Thrones one is in Rome and one is in California Two Babylons Two Thrones two headquarters you could say Amen now through that instrumentation is the complete degradation of the world being manifested through that all the things that you can see the Bible says it she's the mother of all the minations and mother of harlots or religion doesn't matter whether it's Christian religion Islamic everything's come out of her all the cage of unclean and hateful Birds everything's come out of her now Hollywood is her entertainment arm everything all Abominations of sin and moral the non-religious stuff has all come out of her everything all riches and and pomp everything has come out of her come out of Hollywood and do we support Hollywood do we play Hollywood in our homes do we play that stuff on our TVs are we supporting Satan I hope not but if we are you've got to wonder why you're troubled with your thoughts you got to wonder why you're not walking in the victory because you're supporting the devil and it's time to clean out the leaven it's time to eradicate that stuff out of your life amen it's time to take the Feast of unleavened bread amen it's time to Feast only on things that are unleavened amen stop feasting on leaven you know leaven bread tastes good and it grows more but it's got Liv in it amen so here we have this is my finishing preaching thought and then the rest I've just got a couple more quotes to read Daniel 3 so here we have the original Babylon and this Nebuchadnezzar and the original Babylon and that's Satan where Satan was and his kingdom and and expressing over the Earth and all of his pantheons and gods and everything like that in debauchery and here is Nebuchadnezzar and then finally he calls all the Great Men of the Earth the Great Men of his kingdom all the sheriffs and all the governors and all the presidents and and the Bohemian groups and all of those Illuminati type people the ones that worship Satan and their leaders of the world all those he gathers them all and they make this big golden image finally there they're building this big huge image in Dura it's 60 feet high and 6 feet wide or whatever meters it's big image and they got now he calls them all together and how do they get the people to worship this what's going to turn their hearts What Spirit or what medium do they use to to get the people to Fall Down and Worship this image music music is the tool of the devil that's also the tool of God but we're not dealing with that we're dealing with this music now is the principal tool of the devil to take the whole world turn them against God and worship this image that's right the spir brother Brandon said the spirit of rock and roll will take will turn the people from God and bring them to the battle of Armageddon I'm paraphrasing it might not be exactly how he says it but and then we see these big great concerts like G3 or whatever they're called you know the boner from U2 and all of that and all the religions and they pour water and all this jellyfish rubbish you know they're doing all this crazy stuff rock and roll the Pop's there and all these things and they just doing all this ecumenical they're turning the whole world against God against what we believe and to their own God now there's a people now I believe I'm looking at them like Shadrach mesach and Abednego who who refuse to bow down to this image or worship those gods and completely will not listen to what the king nebuch NZ would say hallelujah now why would that happen you see now that is the whole world now as music plays and the music is going in people's ears and it's turning their minds and the spirits of it and it's turning them from God and it's turning them to this wishy-washy homosexual jellyfish Society where all things are all right and the only thing that's not all right is the what people that think they've got the absolute truth the fundamentalist so they actually defeat their own cuz they should say that we're all right too cuz they said all things are all right so you should be allowed to be a fundamentalist but they just but the thing is it's a spirit and Satan cannot be complete so here's all of this music playing people bowing down but there's a people that resist that music there's a people that kick that music out there's a people that remove it from their lives hallelujah amen remove that television stuff and get rid of all disconnected from Hollywood disconnected from all books and anything that's of the devil and only connected three times daily as Daniel open a window and pray to the Living God towards the temple set affections on things above amen Who Wants to Be Free set your affections on things above amen not on things of the earth hallelujah amen and so now they now they come before the king and he gets pretty mad amen and so what happens is in the society they heat up seven times hotter but I tell tell you God's given us a seven seal Revelation to combat that the seventh seal himself so and now that the furnace is seven times hotter Hallelujah and they walk in Bound Hallelujah they walk in Bound in this furnace amen and and we're living in this furnace and we come to it bound but then one day Hallelujah the Fire gets seven times hotter when you refuse what happens Hallelujah those trials start to bre bring out all that stuff in you bring out all those complexes in you bring out why and you start to get delivered from them all the fire at self breaks the bands and you stand Hallelujah walking around in the midst of the fire free from the effects of the fire why because a descended Mighty angel came down hallelujah amen to walk with you amen for those that take a stand against Nebuchadnezzar's lies against Nebuchadnezzar's denominational image for those that take a stand he will be angry angry the devil will be mad and he will try everything that hell can do he will heat it up seven times hotter and make it really hard for you my goodness it make it so hard for you but that's the very thing that sets you free those trials and that hardship will bring every disgusting thing out of your life every hideous thing that's been hidden down in there every bruise everything will be exposed because the Lord himself comes down and he puts a leash on the very fire that Satan has decided to burn you with Hallelujah so to such an effect that you can be surrounded by this horrible fiery sinful sin and world and not even smell like it Hallelujah not even smell like it amen and they Marvel at it these churches and these people they Marvel at you they Wonder but they don't want what you got cuz they're already worshiping the golden image they're already listening to their rock and roll it's even in the churches the whole thing is complete debauchery it's gone finished unsavable the only way is to come out of that stuff my goodness so finally they come out you don't even smell like it Hallelujah the Lord himself is to come down because you see now when we look at fire we think of the Flesh and all that but it's the Mind see the fire is coming with the fiery darts so many of them that it's like a seven times hot of fiery furnace into your mind all the time every day the moment you wake up you have these battles my goodness my all the time it's like a fiery furnace for you but the Lord has come down so that you won't even be affected by those things anymore that's the main thing you can have in your life that is the message of the hour is the very being coming down into your furnace the very person setting his feet upon the sea and upon the Earth of your life Hallelujah so that all the thoughts and all the fiery darts and everything that he could ever throw you none of these things move me Hallelujah you've been stabilized by the gyroscopic stabilization the seas are perilous and you're rocking in this 15 meter swells and you're standing with the Lord amen in the fiery furnace glory amen oh man that makes me feel good can you go to the next slide please I'll just read some Hallelujah oh my my yep I'll read this I was going to skip it but I think we should read it but after you become a Christian then you are fortified by the word and any promise in the word pH I didn't know I was going to say that see I'll just repeat that's such a good thought when you become a Christian then you are fortified by the word and any promise in the word isn't that amazing what does your heart say yes the Mind might be doubting even now there might be doubts flying it's not for you or you might not have access to it but the heart believes it and when you need it God will bring it hallelujah amen doubt your doubts when you become a Christian you're placed behind the word of God see now there's your Fortress safety oh my every promise in that is yours only thing you have to do is just reach to get it and go right on with it how do you know it's going to work I don't know how it's going to work explain to me I don't know the only thing I know that God gave his children the best attack that they could have and the best thing to attack with cuz he knows the working of the enemy now let's diagnose that down like take the chemistry of the blood or the chemistry of water or whatever it is see let's diagnose it down why why did he give the word because are you ready the word is eternal see and if God made a promise that's Eternal and there's nothing nowhere can stop it they couldn't have turn every atom upside down turn it backwards could never pierce the word of God one little word see cuz Jesus said both heavens and earth will pass away but my word shall never fail see see that's the best weapon there is it's the word of the Eternal God now what is the word of God the word of God is God himself so God gave the believer himself amen it's God himself he gave the believer himself to attack the Enemy by that's what we just s talked about in the fire that's what we talked about when they came over Jordan is the captain hallelujah it's the Lord himself it's Revelation 10 coming down with an open book it's himself Hallelujah he gave the fullness of the word the revelation of the word and he came himself himself to make it manifest in other words he is the father and the word is God then the word is our father we're born by the word and he's standing in the Forefront for his children amen there you are he's standing out there for his children what are we scared about the Rapture is sure the coming is sure every blessing that's been promised is ours all belongs to us got from behind the now we kind of slack up and say now if we kind of slack up and say Satan say come right over on this side I'll reason that out with you oh no you got from behind father then see don't you do that you stay right where father stands right where it stand and says thus sayith father see thus sayith my father thus saith my father it's going to defeat him as sure as the world it's got to all right but when you get
