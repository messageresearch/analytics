[36:19] get uh a bride for
[36:23] Isaac and um I just want to use this as
[36:25] a bit of a context if I want to could
[36:27] put a title to this I want to say uh
[36:29] it's a new
[36:31] day this in Genesis 24 and the servant
[36:34] this is elazer took 10 C uh 10 camels of
[36:36] the camels of his master and departed
[36:39] for all the goods of his master were in
[36:41] his hand and he arose and went to uh
[36:44] Mesopotamia unto the city of nahor and
[36:47] he um and he made his camels to kneel
[36:49] down without the City by a well of water
[36:52] at the time of the evening even the time
[36:54] that the woman came out to draw water so
[36:57] the evening time it's very significant
[36:59] time in the scripture and we're going to
[37:01] drop down to verse uh
[37:03] 53 and the servant brought forth Jewels
[37:06] this is after Rebecca comes out and
[37:08] after Alazar has prayed he says Lord uh
[37:11] let let the damsel come out I'm just
[37:13] paraphrasing and may she not only give
[37:15] me water but give water to to the camels
[37:18] and this is what uh Rebecca does and
[37:20] then it says in the servant brought
[37:22] forth jewels of silver and jewels of
[37:23] gold and rment and gave them to Rebecca
[37:26] and he gave also to her brother and to
[37:28] her mother precious things and they did
[37:31] eat and drink he and the men that were
[37:33] with him and they tarried all night so
[37:35] this is this is so so the evening they
[37:37] come to the well then now they're teing
[37:39] all night now it comes to another day
[37:41] and and Rebecca's life is already
[37:43] changed quite significantly we'll come
[37:45] into this and then he and the men that
[37:47] were with him and they Ted all night
[37:48] they rose up in the morning and he said
[37:50] send me away unto my master and her
[37:53] brother and her mother said let the
[37:55] damsel abide with us a few days at least
[37:57] 10 after that she shall go we drop down
[38:01] to verse uh 56 and he said unto them
[38:04] hinder me not seeing the Lord hath
[38:06] prospered my way send me away that I may
[38:09] go to my master and they said well we
[38:12] will call the damsel and choir at her
[38:13] mouth and they called Rebecca and said
[38:15] unto her wil thou go with this man and
[38:18] she said I will go and they sent away
[38:21] Rebecca their sister and her nurse and
[38:23] Abraham's servants and his men amen
[38:27] unless just go to uh Mark 16: 1 and 2
[38:31] but just as you're turning there notice
[38:32] it wasn't elazar wasn't there very long
[38:36] he turned up in the evening and the next
[38:37] morning they were gone Hallelujah so
[38:40] Rebecca went to that well many days no
[38:43] doubt but that day was different she was
[38:46] part of Prophecy she was already been
[38:48] influenced by the angel of the Lord she
[38:50] didn't realize it but she was already
[38:52] predestined to be the Bride of Isaac
[38:54] amen hallelujah but then at the dawning
[38:56] of a different day things were different
[38:59] Hallelujah Mark 161 and2 and when the
[39:02] Sabbath was passed Mary Magdalene and
[39:05] Mary uh the mother of Jesus and and
[39:08] salom had brought sweet spices that they
[39:10] might come and anoint him so this is
[39:12] anointing the body of Jesus this is the
[39:15] this is the day after the Sabbath and
[39:17] very early in the morning the first day
[39:19] of the week they came unto the Seiler at
[39:22] the rising of the sun now I'm just going
[39:25] to read one more scripture because I
[39:27] well

[39:37] convention in Oakland this is my Easter
[39:39] messag amen hallelujah I'm glad he's
[39:42] risen aren't you
[39:45] amen and so and he and and they laid
[39:48] their hands on the apostles this is the
[39:50] scribes and Pharisees and put them in
[39:52] the common prison but the angel of the
[39:54] Lord by Night opened the prison doors
[39:56] and brought them for and said go stand
[40:00] and speak in the temple to the people
[40:02] all the words of this life amen Hall

[40:27] ground may your word come forth a h
[40:29] hundredfold take all gloom and doubt and
[40:31] fear away from every heart Lord in Jesus
[40:34] Christ's name I ask amen amen God bless
[40:37] you friends you may have your seats this
[40:38] morning in the presence of the Lord so I
[40:41] want to speak about you know it's a it's
[40:42] a new day as I said about about uh
[40:47] Rebecca as I said you know she she came
[40:50] to a you know she came to the well and
[40:52] she came to this well many times but
[40:55] there came a I can't I can't don't worry
[40:58] about it I'll just leave it up um but
[41:01] this was a different this was a
[41:03] different time she knew the well very
[41:05] well but there came a different day in
[41:07] her life where she wasn't meant to stay
[41:09] at her father's house she was ordained
[41:12] to be married to Isaac she was ordained
[41:15] to leave her father's house and be
[41:17] United with the son of Promise Isaac and
[41:20] we know that the son of promis is our
[41:22] Lord Jesus Christ Hallelujah so so here
[41:25] she is she has no idea that that Abraham
[41:28] has commissioned alaza you know to go
[41:30] find his son a wife she has no idea that
[41:34] that that Abraham has said the angel of
[41:35] the Lord shall go before you and shall
[41:38] find the damsel she has no idea about
[41:40] this she's just living about her
[41:42] everyday life but you know she was being
[41:44] influenced by the angel of the Lord to
[41:47] to not only give water to the camels but
[41:49] give water to to to alasa and not only
[41:53] that but to say yes I will go this was a
[41:55] very brief you imagine this everyone who
[41:58] has who has daughters that can get
[41:59] married you know marriageable age
[42:01] someone just turns up some long lost
[42:03] someone from somewhere other side of the
[42:05] world maybe and says my f you know my
[42:08] master has a son and and he's fall iner
[42:11] of all things and I've come to find him
[42:13] a wife and the angel the Lord led me
[42:15] here and I was maybe I walked out the
[42:17] airport and I prayed and and your
[42:18] daughter was here and you know and all
[42:20] these events just happened and now you
[42:22] know imagine it imagine it you put it
[42:25] into today's language imagine that
[42:27] happened and then something and then
[42:29] you'd say well hold on but alas says no
[42:31] don't don't hinder us and then it comes
[42:34] down to her decision see it wasn't you
[42:36] know you know it came down to her
[42:38] decision will you go she said I'm going
[42:40] because she come beg to realize this as
[42:42] alaza shared the testimony of the prayer
[42:45] and the angel of the Lord going before
[42:47] Amen to prepare her she began to realize
[42:49] I I'm the answer to that prayer I mean
[42:52] I'm the answer to this and she just said
[42:54] I will go Hallelujah she has influence
[42:57] it was a different
[42:58] day it was a different day in her
[43:01] life Hallelujah and it's the same thing
[43:04] with you and I amen you got to realize
[43:07] we're part of the word we are where
[43:10] where it says the and the bride has made
[43:12] herself ready in Revelations 19 and it
[43:14] was granted unto her that she' be a raid
[43:16] and fine Lin and clean and white which
[43:18] is the righteousness of saints I trust
[43:20] when you read that there's something in
[43:22] you says I'm here to fulfill that amen
[43:24] cuz it's been granted to me that I'd be
[43:26] ar raid and fine Lin and clean and white
[43:28] it's not my own ability it's what he's
[43:30] given me to put on he's given me the
[43:32] weding Garment the word to put on
[43:34] hallelujah amen so I trust you see the
[43:37] you the marriage of the Lamb has come
[43:39] and it has come who's been United
[43:41] Hallelujah to our
[43:43] Lord amen so
[43:45] now I'm just going to skip through these
[43:47] a little bit but I just want you to
[43:48] think of it's such a adorning of a new
[43:51] day can mean so many different things to
[43:53] so many different people to a lot of
[43:55] people another day is another day but to
[43:57] the bride of Christ another day is
[43:59] wonderful hallelujah hallelujah amen
[44:02] Mary Magdalene they they they came to
[44:04] the tomb they're expecting to find a
[44:07] dead form of who they believe would be
[44:10] the Messiah they're expecting to anoint
[44:12] him they knew all about death they knew
[44:14] all about burial they all knew all about
[44:16] anointing the dead amen and and mourning
[44:19] over them and you know they knew about
[44:20] tombs but this was a different day
[44:23] Hallelujah and they found themselves it
[44:25] wasn't them uh orchestrating this whole
[44:28] thing God was orchestrating the whole
[44:29] thing they just happened to find
[44:31] themselves there happened to find
[44:34] themselves come under the influence of
[44:35] this Jesus of Nazareth come to just find
[44:37] themselves hearing his word and it
[44:39] wasn't in them to say he's beab it was
[44:42] in them to say thou art the Christ the
[44:43] son of the Living God they just found
[44:45] themselves in this state Hallelujah and
[44:47] they you know and I'm sure they come to
[44:49] realize they were predestinated am mean
[44:51] to receive the word in their dayj but
[44:53] they came to the tomb expecting to find
[44:55] a dead form but he wasn't there
[44:58] Hallelujah but the stone had rolled they
[45:00] came at the rising of the sun it was a
[45:03] different morning AMJ amen Saturday
[45:06] morning was a sad morning Sunday morning
[45:10] the day after the Sabbath was a very
[45:12] different kind of day hallelujah
[45:14] hallelujah because it wasn't someone had
[45:16] stolen his body away they found he was
[45:18] risen am he was now alive Hallelujah and
[45:23] it's the same thing with you and I
[45:25] friends I trust that he's become so
[45:27] alive to
[45:28] you amen that it's not as as Brother
[45:33] Andy I don't know if he C coined the
[45:35] word or if it's actually a part of our
[45:37] English vocabulary you know how people
[45:39] historification
[45:57] real one was where they crossed the Red
[45:58] Sea all those things are all perfectly
[46:00] well but he's still a god of History
[46:03] well you could go to the den and tuon
[46:05] you can go to Jeffersonville you can go
[46:07] to mount Sunset you can go to the Ohio
[46:09] River all that's all perfectly well but
[46:11] that's history amen all those things
[46:14] should build your faith sure but it's
[46:16] when he comes out of History the god of
[46:18] the Prophet the god of the word comes
[46:20] out of history and he reveals himself to
[46:23] you now that's very different that's a
[46:26] different day cuz now it's not someone
[46:28] else's testimony it's your testimony
[46:31] amen as it says it says in the law Thou
[46:34] shalt not bear a false witness and many
[46:36] times we take that as people saying lies
[46:38] about one another but bearing a false
[46:40] witness is when you have no testimony to
[46:43] be a witness right if you're a false
[46:46] witness you don't have a true testimony
[46:48] right and if you have a and if you are a
[46:50] false witness it means you weren't there
[46:52] when it happened amen you're bearing
[46:55] false witness so it's it's like a you
[46:57] know it's like Jesus said by their
[46:59] fruits you shall know them and the
[47:01] scribes and Pharisees saying no we are
[47:03] the real Believers we have Moses but
[47:05] they weren't bearing the fruit of Moses
[47:07] they were bearing the fruit of religion
[47:08] they were a false witness of Moses right
[47:11] they were a false witness of Moses and
[47:13] it's the same thing with a real believer
[47:15] in this day by their fruits you shall
[47:17] know them the life that is produced by
[47:20] that you shall know them amen and if the
[47:22] life is the life of God then they are a
[47:24] true witness but if it's not the life of
[47:27] God there are false witness right amen
[47:30] amen and that's why I love this I love
[47:33] reading through the Bible don't you amen
[47:36] four chapters a day you'll get through
[47:37] it in a year apparently wow but he says
[47:40] here go tell stand and go stand and
[47:44] speak in the temple of the to the people
[47:46] all the words of this life
[47:50] amen he didn't say go and explain it
[47:54] amen or go tell where everyone's wrong
[47:58] go speak of all the words of this life
[48:01] amen this life he was living was very
[48:03] different to the life he lived even just
[48:06] a few days before amen this was a
[48:08] different kind of life this was now
[48:10] eternal life was now in them
[48:13] resurrection power was in them
[48:15] Deliverance was in them Hallelujah
[48:18] healing was in them amen they were
[48:21] redeemed people you know I was thinking
[48:22] about it if someone's been redeemed
[48:25] they're very they live a very very
[48:27] different life to when they were a slave
[48:30] very different you take the you know you
[48:32] take those in Israel you know we're here
[48:34] not just to talk about him but we're
[48:37] here to you know and we should have the
[48:39] evidence the proof that he's risen amen
[48:42] the EV the the the direct evidence just
[48:44] as the disciples had the evidence the
[48:46] living proof that he was alive from the
[48:49] grave he arose not just because the tomb
[48:51] was empty but because the life that was
[48:53] in him was in them am mean that they
[48:55] could actually prove by the that they
[48:57] were living that that he had risen that
[48:59] he was not dead that it wasn't just some
[49:01] religion not some other man's idea but
[49:03] he truly was Messiah I mean that he
[49:05] poured his Spirit out upon All Flesh and
[49:07] now they were living witness I mean that
[49:09] God had truly poured his Spirit out upon
[49:11] them Hallelujah and it's the same thing
[49:13] with you and I friends we are to be a
[49:15] living witness I mean our lives are a
[49:17] living evidence a living proof am mean
[49:19] that Jesus is not dead amen that is not
[49:21] just some tradition but he is alive
[49:23] forever more because his life is in US
[49:26] amen I'm going to probably plow through
[49:28] that point a lot but I really want it to
[49:29] Anchor deep amen that we are amen the
[49:32] bride is living proof amen that he died
[49:35] on Calvary he is living we are living
[49:38] proof that the seals are open amen
[49:40] hallelujah the bride is living proof
[49:42] that this is true amen hallelujah amen
[49:45] so go stand and speak to the people all
[49:47] the words of this life as the as Jude
[49:50] would write to earnestly contend for the
[49:53] faith that was once delivered for the
[49:55] you know once delivered to the saint to
[49:56] contend for it not against something but
[50:00] for something and that's why we're here
[50:03] amen I believe our lives are contending
[50:05] for the faith not against the world but
[50:09] sure it's wrong but for the faith we're
[50:12] going to have a cause for something
[50:14] Hallelujah not just against the scribes
[50:16] and Pharisees their whole cause was this
[50:18] man's beab this is something hatched up
[50:20] this is wrong this is contrary to our
[50:23] understanding it must be wrong they were
[50:25] just against that's right but the
[50:27] disciples were for amen hallelujah so we
[50:30] should be contending for the baptism of
[50:32] the Holy Ghost we should be contending
[50:34] for reality of the word amen we should
[50:37] be contending for healing amen for
[50:39] deliverance amen for to be made new
[50:41] creatures in Christ amen we should be
[50:43] contending that the word is true that
[50:44] this message lives hallelujah amen that
[50:46] he's not a god of History shouldn't we
[50:48] be contending for
[50:50] something
[50:51] hallelujah oh
[50:53] Hallelujah now he says this is in the
[50:55] rising of the Sun he says now the day
[50:57] now the Sun at the rising of the sun
[51:00] well there was a time when the world was
[51:02] laying in utter Darkness it was without
[51:04] form and and and was void and it was all
[51:07] covered with water and was laying there
[51:10] in the dark dismal gloomy atmosphere and
[51:12] the spirit of God moved upon that water
[51:14] and said let there be light God had a
[51:16] reason to do that for down beneath that
[51:18] water there was seeds that he had
[51:21] planted and it had to have that sunlight
[51:24] to make it live
[51:26] amen and the first light that was ever
[51:29] given in the Earth was God's spoken word
[51:32] the first light that ever struck the
[51:33] Earth was God's spoken word he said let
[51:36] there be light there was light that
[51:38] turned Darkness into light in order to
[51:40] bring forth a creation of joy and life
[51:43] upon the Earth then the spirit of God as
[51:45] it moved with love and compassion at
[51:47] that great day the first day of the dawn
[51:49] of creation upon the Earth the Sun Rose
[51:51] and swept across it's raised uh and
[51:54] dried up the waters from the Earth and
[51:56] it made an atmosphere above and for the
[51:59] first time it was to bring forth joy and
[52:02] life to the Earth by a seed that was a
[52:04] great
[52:06] hour oh but it wasn't nothing that
[52:08] Sunrise like the sunrise on that Easter
[52:11] morning this time when the sun leaping
[52:13] into the skies it brought forth a
[52:15] greater Sunrise than ever because it
[52:18] because it came greater news with this
[52:20] Sunrise than it did at the Sunrise of
[52:22] the beginning this Sunrise brought a
[52:24] news that said he is risen he is quick
[52:26] from the dead as he promised he is risen
[52:29] from the dead amen the first time the
[52:32] sun rose in Genesis it was bringing a
[52:35] message that there will be life upon the
[52:37] Earth mortal life but this time when the
[52:39] sun rose it was a duel sun rising
[52:42] another sun rising it was not only the
[52:44] Su n Rising it was the s o n had risen
[52:48] to bring eternal life to All God's
[52:50] promis seed that by for knowledge he had
[52:52] seen laying upon the Earth amen amen no
[52:56] more could the boty life lived back
[52:58] there at the beginning without the Su to
[53:00] bring it to life no more than today when
[53:02] the sons of God is upon the Earth it
[53:04] takes the S so n light to bring them to
[53:06] eternal life his chosen ones that he
[53:08] knew before the foundation of the world
[53:10] he had chosen them in himself before the
[53:13] foundation of the world so I just I just
[53:15] didn't know where to stop with this and
[53:17] on Easter morning then in this dirt laid
[53:20] somewhere laid our bodies at that time
[53:22] for we are the dust of the earth and in
[53:24] heaven uh there was a book of memory and
[53:26] as attributes was in him knowing that
[53:28] because this son of God raised it would
[53:31] also raise to life every son that was
[53:33] foreordained to this great time he knew
[53:36] it would be and what a more glorious
[53:38] Sunrise than what it uh than what it was
[53:41] at the beginning at the time when it
[53:43] first dawned oh this great breaking of
[53:47] the Easter
[53:48] seal Hallelujah we have to friends this
[53:52] is more than just a sermon to me when he
[53:54] preaches it's the rising of the Sun he's
[53:56] making a declaration am the same one
[53:59] that Rose there on on on the first
[54:01] Easter as the same God that's come now
[54:04] in this end time to Quicken the
[54:06] predestinated ones to bring them to life
[54:09] because the son of the word amen has
[54:11] risen Hallelujah and now he's shining
[54:14] upon the Earth am mean this word broed
[54:16] upon you over the Earth just like any
[54:19] Prophecy in the scripture like Isaiah
[54:20] said a virgin shall conceive 800 odd
[54:23] years later it found a seat to land into
[54:25] and me to bring for the promise and it's
[54:27] the same thing with you and I this
[54:29] message has been maybe sitting for 40 50
[54:31] 60 years amen but it's waiting for you
[54:33] to come H waiting for you to come upon
[54:36] the Earth amen there's something in you
[54:38] said Hallelujah I believe it and it
[54:40] quickened and it became alive a living
[54:43] reality to you amen hallelujah
[54:45] hallelujah we have the direct evidence
[54:48] that Jesus Christ is risen Hallelujah we
[54:52] have the living proof amen Amen brother

[1:02:34] argument to prove he's risen there you

[1:02:39] risen Hallelujah that's why the devil

[1:06:33] they could cry down to the bottom we're
[1:06:35] free amen the Sun's Up hallelujah we're
[1:06:38] a free people and then no doubt the
[1:06:40] people down the bottom could look up and
[1:06:41] see them bathed in sunlight they begin
[1:06:43] to Rejoice but they haven't felt the sun
[1:06:45] rise yet Hallelujah but as the sun
[1:06:48] dawned Higher and Higher and Higher and
[1:06:50] me the Shadows went away then that same
[1:06:51] sunlight that hit the one at the top of
[1:06:53] the mountain now hit everyone at the
[1:06:55] bottom of the mountain
[1:06:56] Hallelujah and now that's why the
[1:06:57] prophet went to the top of the mountain
[1:06:59] the top of the pyramid and he says it's
[1:07:01] the dawning of a new day it is the
[1:07:02] rising of the sun amen the same one that

[1:07:26] many people didn't ever catch what he
[1:07:27] was talking about but he's making a
[1:07:29] declaration it is the rising of the Sun
[1:07:31] the so n is risen hallelujah we're
[1:07:34] living in a different
[1:07:35] time I trust it means a lot to you it

[1:07:41] and then but then finally we're like the
[1:07:42] ones at the bottom the sunlight hits us
[1:07:45] H we're no longer in cold gloomy
[1:07:47] darkness of religion but the so n light
[1:07:49] strikes us and we can Rejoice saying we
[1:07:52] are free amen hallelujah
[1:07:56] amen
[1:07:58] hallelujah we are the beneficiaries of
[1:08:00] his
[1:08:01] life amen he has the same yesterday
[1:08:03] today and forever we his beneficiaries
[1:08:06] are to prove his life is in us now the
[1:08:08] beneficiaries of this life the life
[1:08:10] there was never a life lived like that
[1:08:12] he was the son of God and he died and
[1:08:14] that shuted out but when he raised again
[1:08:16] from the dead on on Easter morning then
[1:08:20] we as his servants are commissioned by
[1:08:22] him to go into all the world and to
[1:08:24] bring this good news to every person
[1:08:26] that he is a living how can you do it by
[1:08:29] word only for it's written the gospel
[1:08:31] came not by word only but through the
[1:08:34] power and the manifestation of the Holy
[1:08:36] Spirit to prove that he is alive amen so
[1:08:39] this gospel is not word only it's not
[1:08:41] argument only it's not debate only it's
[1:08:43] not putting facts together only amen but
[1:08:45] is the power of the I just we'll just
[1:08:48] read it he says he says for the gospel
[1:08:50] came not by word only but through the
[1:08:52] power and the manif uh uh manifestation
[1:08:55] of the Holy Spirit to prove that he is
[1:08:58] alive Hallelujah and he says so this is
[1:09:01] what I was want to go to he says knowing
[1:09:02] bre knowing Brethren beloved your
[1:09:05] election of God for our gospel came not
[1:09:07] unto you in word only but also in power
[1:09:10] and the Holy Ghost and in much Assurance
[1:09:12] as you know that what manner of men we
[1:09:14] were among you for your sake and you
[1:09:17] became followers of us you know the
[1:09:19] Apostle Paul said be ye followers of me
[1:09:21] that's right he wasn't ashamed to say be
[1:09:23] follow me as I follow Christ be
[1:09:25] followers of me he was pointing to
[1:09:27] himself is that extreme that's what he
[1:09:29] did go read your Bible he said be
[1:09:31] followers of me Hallelujah this is this
[1:09:34] is what you should do amen as ye know
[1:09:37] what manner of men we were among you for
[1:09:38] your sake and you became followers of of
[1:09:40] us and of the Lord having received the
[1:09:43] word in much Affliction with the joy of
[1:09:45] the Holy Ghost so he says that the he
[1:09:48] says the gospel did not come unto you in
[1:09:49] word only hallelujah amen this is very
[1:09:53] this is very important because it's more
[1:09:55] than just man am mean the gospel is you
[1:09:58] know if we read in Mark 16 go into all
[1:10:00] the world preach the gospel these signs
[1:10:02] shall follow them that believe not just
[1:10:04] the and these signs shall shall follow
[1:10:07] them that believe H do we have Believers
[1:10:10] here today I me that means that means
[1:10:13] this will happen in your life lay hands
[1:10:15] upon the sick they shall recover amen
[1:10:17] speak in new tongues you know drink any
[1:10:19] deadly thing that shall not harm them
[1:10:20] these signs shall follow Hallelujah and
[1:10:23] it says at the end of the chapter and
[1:10:24] the Lord went with them confirming the
[1:10:26] word was signs following so it's more
[1:10:28] than the disciples and their words but
[1:10:31] what they spoke God came and behind am
[1:10:33] mean to vindicate what they were saying
[1:10:35] was not their words but it was God's
[1:10:37] words am Hallelujah that's why you take
[1:10:40] virtually every message Amen brother
[1:10:42] br's preaching he says now if I've said
[1:10:45] the truth if I be a servant of the Lord
[1:10:47] if I've said the truth let him come down
[1:10:49] and prove it to be true amen and what
[1:10:51] happened God came down in a way that was
[1:10:54] unique to the other minist trees that
[1:10:55] were on the field amen hallelujah and
[1:10:58] God came down with the sign of the
[1:10:59] Messiah not just healing but the sign of
[1:11:02] the Messiah amen the revelation of the
[1:11:05] people's hearts Hallelujah and that was
[1:11:08] God now coming in behind saying I'm here
[1:11:10] to back up what he said
[1:11:12] hallelujah amen and it should be the
[1:11:15] same God's behind his bride the Lord
[1:11:18] Jesus Christ is behind you amen
[1:11:20] hallelujah we're ambassadors of Heaven
[1:11:22] are we not amen that means All That
[1:11:24] Heaven is is behind you
[1:11:25] I mean you've been you've been given the
[1:11:27] you know you've been given the authority

[1:13:24] preached the revelation Jesus Christ the
[1:13:25] church Age series that that God came
[1:13:28] down the pillow of fire and Drew out the
[1:13:29] church age on the wall that would have

[1:14:00] hasn't diminished he hasn't changed one
[1:14:02] bit oh we're living in a different
[1:14:04] season well when the enemy comes in like
[1:14:06] a flood or raise up a standard
[1:14:08] Hallelujah we don't need to be afraid we
[1:14:10] don't need to be worried the world has
[1:14:13] to be this way that's right everything
[1:14:15] is running on God's time piece perfectly
[1:14:17] fine that's right Hallelujah he's not
[1:14:20] worried oh it's so dark you know even
[1:14:22] even the prophet when he said he said I
[1:14:25] predict I do not prophesy okay so so
[1:14:28] anyone who knows English will know the
[1:14:30] word predict and prophesy not the same
[1:14:32] word but he says I predict I do not
[1:14:35] prophesy that 1977 ought to terminate
[1:14:38] the world systems and to usher in the
[1:14:40] Millennium he's not one he's not
[1:14:42] prophesying it will happen he's saying I
[1:14:44] predict I do not prophesy because he saw
[1:14:47] the world was getting so dark so quickly
[1:14:49] that surely it could not continue on
[1:14:51] past 1977 he says it ought to terminate
[1:14:54] the World Systems and ought to usher in
[1:14:56] the Millennium you look at the death
[1:14:58] who's been ushered into a place amen
[1:15:01] who's come to a restaurant and there's a
[1:15:03] sign that says please wait here to be
[1:15:05] seated but I'm I'm going to go sit down
[1:15:07] so now now you're the you know are you
[1:15:11] with me so no no please wait to be
[1:15:14] seated I'm waiting to be seated so it's
[1:15:15] going to take time for me to be ushered
[1:15:17] to my seat and then now here comes the
[1:15:19] weight stuff welcome to blah blah blah
[1:15:21] with your how many table for what I'll
[1:15:23] now Usher you to your seat
[1:15:25] and there's a process of time where you
[1:15:27] leave from where you told to wait and
[1:15:29] you walk along and he says can you sit
[1:15:31] here and now it's like I've been ushered
[1:15:34] in hello it's just you just look at
[1:15:37] English definitions ushering actually
[1:15:40] means a period of time as well amen
[1:15:44] hallelujah Glory but he was he was
[1:15:48] saying it's getting so dark so quickly I
[1:15:51] can't see it go past that time and you
[1:15:54] just think you know I think about it
[1:15:55] yesterday you take the Prophecies of the
[1:15:57] Old Testament you take you take when you
[1:16:01] know David he said uh my God my God why
[1:16:06] has th forsaken me and he's speaking in
[1:16:08] first person and it was so real to him
[1:16:10] he was living out the crucifixion you
[1:16:13] know and and you know there you know
[1:16:15] when Joel would prophesy of behold I'll
[1:16:17] pour out my spirit upon All Flesh what
[1:16:19] do you think he would have been like if
[1:16:21] he was actually allowed to go from that
[1:16:23] prophecy and live out the prophecy
[1:16:25] he would have been next to himself what
[1:16:27] do you think would have been like for
[1:16:28] David remember under the blood of bulls
[1:16:30] and goats the seed in them wasn't
[1:16:32] Quicken like it was under the blood of
[1:16:34] Jesus Christ and he says as the heart
[1:16:37] pan for the water Brook so my soul Longs
[1:16:39] after thee he was an odd kind of man he
[1:16:42] had a longing I just want to be in the
[1:16:43] presence of the Lord and dwell in his
[1:16:45] Tabernacles and you know but but the
[1:16:47] longing in his heart could never be
[1:16:49] fulfilled because he was living under
[1:16:52] the blood of bulls and goats so imagine
[1:16:54] that when he had that longing as the
[1:16:56] heart paned for the water Brook so my
[1:16:58] soul Longs after thee Hallelujah he had
[1:17:01] seen God Live come on he had seen God
[1:17:03] live he had seen him do many mighty
[1:17:05] things but his heart longed for him
[1:17:07] imagine if he was transported to today
[1:17:10] oh my hallelujah or or to The Upper Room
[1:17:13] hallelujah hallelujah where it wasn't
[1:17:15] just a desire that that that could never
[1:17:17] be met but that desire could not you
[1:17:19] know wasn't just just long for but it
[1:17:21] could be me I mean that the seed in him
[1:17:23] could have been could have been
[1:17:23] quickened he would have been beside
[1:17:26] himself Hallelujah rejoicing now imagine
[1:17:29] if the prophet was here today the things
[1:17:32] he
[1:17:32] saw my what do you he would be he'd be
[1:17:36] tearing the place up hallelujah
[1:17:39] hallelujah are you following
[1:17:41] me when he saw the world go it's going
[1:17:44] to go
[1:17:46] insane the seven Visions he saw in
[1:17:50] 33 what do you think he would be like
[1:17:53] Hallelujah
[1:17:55] Hallelujah these people would be
[1:17:57] rejoicing hallu because it's more than
[1:17:59] just when you know God's going to do
[1:18:01] something it throws you into
[1:18:03] expectation amen so if you're just so so
[1:18:06] if you're a prophet in the Old Testament
[1:18:08] or even imagine the Apostle Paul imagine
[1:18:11] him in this day he writes to the
[1:18:13] Thessalonians we which are alive and
[1:18:14] remain he's
[1:18:16] prophesying Hallelujah most of his
[1:18:17] writings are
[1:18:19] prophecy we which are alive and remain
[1:18:21] should not hinder or prevent them which
[1:18:23] are asleep but the dead in Christ arise
[1:18:24] first will be called up to meet the Lord
[1:18:26] in the air the Lord himself will desend
[1:18:27] with a shout voice and you know imagine
[1:18:29] if he you know he was imagine if he was
[1:18:33] here right now do you think he would be
[1:18:36] excited Hallelujah he was he was he was
[1:18:40] under expectation that that that he
[1:18:41] would be in that group of alive and
[1:18:44] remain amen but but he'd be the dead in
[1:18:47] Christ so imagine if he was here and and
[1:18:50] and the Lord quickened to him you mean
[1:18:52] the Lord is descended with a shout oh
[1:18:55] yeah you mean we're living in that se
[1:18:56] you mean you're living in that season
[1:18:58] Hallelujah he'd be rejoicing amen you
[1:19:01] mean the consummation of the ages is on
[1:19:03] you mean Israel's back as a nation you
[1:19:05] imagine yo Matthew scribing down Matthew
[1:19:08] 24 when the Fig Tree puts forth its
[1:19:12] buds and it's been there for 71 years or
[1:19:15] whatever give or take Hallelujah do you
[1:19:18] think it wouldn't throw them into
[1:19:20] expectation it wouldn't throw them into
[1:19:22] just great excitement and rejoicing
[1:19:24] saying Lord you're they're living in the
[1:19:26] season cuz Jesus said when you see the
[1:19:28] Fig Tree put forth his buds you know
[1:19:30] that summer is n and this generation
[1:19:33] shall not pass until all be
[1:19:36] fulfilled Hallelujah do you think that
[1:19:38] would get them excited it would get them
[1:19:40] real
[1:19:41] excited
[1:19:44] hallelujah
[1:19:48] amen
[1:19:50] now even so we as I said we're living in
[1:19:54] a
[1:19:55] time well I was saying about to be
[1:19:59] redeemed if we're really redeemed we
[1:20:02] live a different life amen than you even
[1:20:06] so we when we were children we're in
[1:20:07] bondage under the elements of the world
[1:20:10] but when the fullness of the time was
[1:20:11] come God sent forth the son made of a
[1:20:13] woman made under the law to redeem them
[1:20:16] that were under the law that we might
[1:20:18] receive the adoption of sons and we know
[1:20:20] that that word adoption in the Greek is
[1:20:21] the placing of a son in the family
[1:20:23] Hallelujah so it's not getting someone
[1:20:25] just like me going to China and and
[1:20:27] finding a baby and and bringing it to
[1:20:29] back to New Zealand and writing some
[1:20:30] papers and saying this is now my child
[1:20:32] this is not what adoption is in the
[1:20:34] Bible the adoption in the Bible is the
[1:20:36] placing of a son in the family amen so
[1:20:39] so they are no longer just a you know
[1:20:42] that they come to a position that their
[1:20:44] word is good as the father's word
[1:20:46] hallelujah so so this is where we have
[1:20:49] we we have come to I'm saying if we have
[1:20:50] been redeemed amen it manifests in our
[1:20:53] life Glory Hallelujah is everyone okay
[1:20:56] today amen I trust this means a lot to
[1:20:59] you so to redeem them from under the law
[1:21:01] that that we might receive the adoption
[1:21:02] or the placing of sons and because ye
[1:21:05] are Sons God sent forth the spirit of
[1:21:08] his son into your hearts crying Abba
[1:21:10] Father wherefore Thou Art no more a
[1:21:13] servant but a son and of a son then an
[1:21:16] heir of God through Christ Hallelujah so
[1:21:19] because we are Sons because we are
[1:21:21] daughters that's why he moved upon your
[1:21:23] soul that's why he quickened his word to
[1:21:25] you because you are not because you
[1:21:29] became this I'll just Rejoice myself
[1:21:32] Hallelujah cuz cuz I like this I didn't
[1:21:35] become something and then I received the
[1:21:37] Holy Ghost because I am because I am a
[1:21:40] son or a daughter that's why I Reed the
[1:21:42] Holy Ghost where the son of his Spirit
[1:21:44] into my heart where I cry Abba Father or
[1:21:46] my father my father Hallelujah wherefore
[1:21:49] Thou Art no more a servant but a son and
[1:21:53] of a son than an heir of God God through
[1:21:55] Christ
[1:21:57] Hallelujah can we go again one more
[1:21:59] second Corinthians 3 but unto this day
[1:22:02] when Moses has read the veil is upon
[1:22:04] their heart nevertheless when it shall
[1:22:06] turn to the Lord the veil shall be taken
[1:22:08] away now the Lord is that spirit and
[1:22:11] where the spirit of the Lord is there is
[1:22:12] Liberty but we all with open face
[1:22:15] beholding as in a glass the glory of the
[1:22:17] Lord are changed into the same image
[1:22:19] from glory to glory even as by the
[1:22:22] spirit of the Lord so he's saying when
[1:22:23] Moses is read this day there's a veil
[1:22:25] upon their heart they can't see what
[1:22:26] he's saying right it doesn't make sense
[1:22:29] it doesn't make sense and it's not clear
[1:22:30] he says when that Veil is taken away
[1:22:33] amen then then they shall see amen and
[1:22:37] it says that now the Lord is that spirit
[1:22:39] and where the spirit of the Lord is
[1:22:41] there is Liberty now this word Liberty
[1:22:43] means a freedom and that and and the
[1:22:46] root word of this word Liberty means to
[1:22:48] go unrestrained to go at pleasure as a
[1:22:51] citizen and not a slave as Freeborn
[1:22:54] Hallelujah so it's not someone so so
[1:22:57] someone who's a free man or a free woman
[1:22:59] to be at Liberty so that means that this
[1:23:01] so with the spirit of Lord is there is
[1:23:03] liberty so that Liberty means that we're
[1:23:05] no longer slaves amen we're now Freeborn
[1:23:07] we're now we're no longer servants but
[1:23:09] we're citizens of the Kingdom hallelujah
[1:23:11] we're no longer slaves to the devil no
[1:23:13] more amen but now we're citizens of the
[1:23:15] kingdom of God hallelujah and that's why
[1:23:18] you see someone when the veil is taken
[1:23:20] off because people are still veiled
[1:23:21] today amen the world is veiled today
[1:23:24] today but when that Veil is taken off
[1:23:26] their heart amen they are no longer
[1:23:28] under the bondage of the devil or under
[1:23:30] the slavery of this flesh amen but now
[1:23:32] they're at Liberty hallelujah amen but
[1:23:36] we will with open face unveiled face
[1:23:38] beholding as in a glass the glory of the
[1:23:40] Lord are changed into the same image
[1:23:42] from glory to glory even by the spirit
[1:23:45] of the Lord hallelujah so we are TR
[1:23:47] changed we are transformed into the same
[1:23:49] image Amen to the image of his word by
[1:23:52] the spirit of the Lord Hallelujah so
[1:23:55] we're a free
[1:23:56] people amen now I'm going to get back
[1:24:00] into um I am talking about uh Alazar and
[1:24:05] Rebecca still because it's a different

[1:27:34] like he says he says it's like you know
[1:27:37] just take Natural children you're in
[1:27:39] your father you are part of him but he
[1:27:43] wanted to have fellowship with you there
[1:27:45] was a desire we want to have children
[1:27:47] but he couldn't have fellowship with you
[1:27:49] if you still in him she had to be born
[1:27:51] into the Earth Hallelujah and then he
[1:27:54] could have fellowship with you amen but
[1:27:56] you are a part of him am mean genetics
[1:27:58] has proven it right DNA has proven it
[1:28:01] they can even take now there's um
[1:28:03] technology at the um um at my work and
[1:28:05] they can actually differentiate multiple
[1:28:08] blood uh um sources in a crime
[1:28:12] scene amen they they can divvy it all
[1:28:15] up and anyway that's another
[1:28:17] conversation but you know but but they
[1:28:19] can they can work out and then and then
[1:28:21] they can even now they're trying to work
[1:28:23] out from blood and and DNA from
[1:28:24] identical twins based on different uh
[1:28:28] chemical patterns in the
[1:28:30] DNA but you
[1:28:32] know he talks about the Jin seed of God
[1:28:36] Amen and he says it's like God you were
[1:28:39] part you were in him just like uh just
[1:28:43] like Levi was in the loins of Abraham
[1:28:45] when he paid tithes to mzc he was in him
[1:28:48] the scripture says right but you had to
[1:28:51] be born into the Earth cuz God wanted
[1:28:54] fellowship with you amen and the reason
[1:28:56] this word is Quicken you is because
[1:28:59] you're a you're a part of God you're one
[1:29:01] of his children you're one of his
[1:29:03] attributes upon the Earth Hallelujah so
[1:29:05] it goes you know God's taking it down to
[1:29:07] the very core of the believer the reason
[1:29:10] that it's quickened to us the reason
[1:29:11] we're drawn to him amen the Lord Jesus
[1:29:14] Christ is because we're a gene seed amen
[1:29:16] we're part of his family and you'll find
[1:29:19] out that family traits are passed down
[1:29:22] Hallelujah you take Natural you know
[1:29:24] children you look at your parents the
[1:29:27] older you get the more realize you're
[1:29:29] more like
[1:29:30] them you can't help it the traits they
[1:29:33] have they passed down to you whether you
[1:29:35] like it or not now that's just a natural
[1:29:37] lineage amen but God has traits as well
[1:29:40] God has traits of faith God has traits
[1:29:43] of being an overcomer Hallelujah God has
[1:29:45] a traits of Deliverance of healing
[1:29:48] hallelujah amen and the more you walk
[1:29:51] with him I trust the more you can see
[1:29:53] I'm just like Daddy hallelujah
[1:29:55] hallelujah because of because of our
[1:29:58] Lord Jesus overcame he overcame hell
[1:30:00] death in the grave he overcame his
[1:30:02] culture he overcame the religions of the
[1:30:04] world he overcame all manner of pressure
[1:30:07] Hallelujah and then he birthed some
[1:30:09] children forth in the upper room and
[1:30:11] they overcame their culture they
[1:30:12] overcame their religion they overcame
[1:30:14] all kinds of pressure why because they
[1:30:16] were manifesting what was in their dad
[1:30:20] hallelujah what by the new birth they
[1:30:22] were manifesting what was in their
[1:30:24] father hallelujah hallelujah and it's I
[1:30:26] trust it's the same thing with us
[1:30:28] hallelujah amen if we're his children
[1:30:30] we'll do like he did amen hallelujah and
[1:30:33] that's why when you go back through the
[1:30:35] scripture Enoch was a genan seed and he
[1:30:38] walked with God and was not cuz God took
[1:30:40] him amen so so if part of the family did
[1:30:42] that the rest of the family will do that
[1:30:44] amen he's pointing to you there's a
[1:30:46] trait being manifested amen Abraham
[1:30:49] could you know staggered not at the
[1:30:51] promise of God not even coming into
[1:30:53] consideration the deadness of his own
[1:30:55] flesh or the deadness of Sarah's womb
[1:30:57] but he believed the promise amen amen if
[1:31:01] he did it we'll be the same way
[1:31:05] hallelujah amen because family traits
[1:31:08] are passed down Hallelujah and brother
[1:31:11] brah brings out the Jean seed and it's
[1:31:14] very to me it's very there's a reason
[1:31:16] why he spoke about it so much at the end
[1:31:17] of his ministry cuz he's saying now it's
[1:31:20] more than just people get anointed they
[1:31:21] do all kinds of things but it's that
[1:31:23] seed on the inside
[1:31:24] amen and the devil what does the devil
[1:31:26] always try and knock you about you're
[1:31:29] not a Believer you're not a Christian do
[1:31:32] you think you're really walking in the
[1:31:33] faith and he's trying to attack your
[1:31:36] identity he's trying to attack your
[1:31:38] family origin right amen just like
[1:31:42] imagine now this sounds very ridiculous
[1:31:44] but imagine someone went up to my girls
[1:31:46] you think you're a
[1:31:48] gloin you think Ben and Christine are
[1:31:51] your parents you think you really are
[1:31:54] and it wouldn't take too much you just
[1:31:56] that's a hold on come meet come meet
[1:31:58] them then they come stand next to
[1:32:03] us so there's family
[1:32:06] resemblance and you see facial
[1:32:08] expressions
[1:32:09] traits it's like people time
[1:32:12] travel but but if someone came against
[1:32:15] their identity that's say that's say
[1:32:17] that's just
[1:32:18] ridiculous come meet my parents just the
[1:32:21] life they live and the life I live Prov
[1:32:23] that they are my parents Hallelujah and
[1:32:26] it's the same thing people come against
[1:32:28] you you say oh this is this is all Folly
[1:32:30] this is wrong this is a cult this is you
[1:32:32] know crazy he said hold on hold on the
[1:32:36] life that I read about in here the same
[1:32:39] life I see in here amen is it cuz
[1:32:42] Christianity is not an argument amen
[1:32:45] Christianity is a life am it's eternal
[1:32:48] life in a people that's what to be a
[1:32:50] Christian is to be Christlike and the
[1:32:52] only way you can be Christlike if he is
[1:32:53] in you amen so that to me pushes all the
[1:32:57] argument away Hallelujah because it's a
[1:33:01] Life by their fruits you shall know them
[1:33:04] by the life that is manifested in them
[1:33:06] amen amen that's how you know them
[1:33:09] that's right Hallelujah so the Devil
[1:33:11] comes along he says you think you're
[1:33:12] really one of them you think you're
[1:33:13] really a Christian you think you're
[1:33:15] really saved by grace he's trying to
[1:33:17] attack your identity that's right amen
[1:33:21] but you've got to stand there and say no
[1:33:23] I know who I'm born of Hallelujah I know
[1:33:26] who spoke to my heart and it wasn't a
[1:33:28] preacher it was more than a preacher
[1:33:29] more than a tape even more than letters
[1:33:32] in a book but it was the Living God took
[1:33:35] his word and anchored it in my soul
[1:33:37] Hallelujah and you got to stand there
[1:33:39] and you say devil I know when I met him
[1:33:41] am I know when I met him Noah was so
[1:33:44] gripped by a short visitation of God I'm
[1:33:47] going to destroy this Earth because the
[1:33:48] wickedness of the world now build this
[1:33:50] Ark and he saw by Vision the ark and he
[1:33:53] so gripped by it it didn't matter what
[1:33:55] people said you know there would have
[1:33:57] been voices on the outside of the ark
[1:33:59] that turned people to get out of it or
[1:34:01] turn people not to go in That's How
[1:34:03] Strong the criticism would have become
[1:34:05] oh yeah but Noah was so convinced amen
[1:34:08] Noah was so gripped am he said this is
[1:34:10] the way am this is going to bring us
[1:34:13] safety hallelujah hallelujah and it paid
[1:34:15] off amen it doesn't matter how
[1:34:17] ridiculous it was to the world it was
[1:34:20] God's provided way was that Ark you know
[1:34:22] the Apostle Paul
[1:34:24] you go read you go read the Apostle
[1:34:27] Paul most of his writings he doesn't
[1:34:29] reference with the Old
[1:34:31] Testament amen he says this just like
[1:34:34] what we read the Revelation I received
[1:34:36] that when you read
[1:34:39] it let's go back to that I'll put it
[1:34:44] up maybe I go here he says for this
[1:34:47] cause I Paul the prisoner of Jesus
[1:34:50] Christ for you Gentiles if you have
[1:34:52] heard of the dispensation of Grace of
[1:34:53] God which is given to me to you so I've
[1:34:56] received a dispensation in that word is
[1:34:57] the economy of God the economy of Grace
[1:35:01] that I received that I'm going to giving
[1:35:03] to you how that by Revelation he made
[1:35:05] known unto me the
[1:35:07] mystery how he he's not he's not AO you
[1:35:10] know he's not apologetic he says God
[1:35:13] showed me the mystery that the Gentiles
[1:35:15] will become the body of Christ God
[1:35:17] showed me this mystery and I'm going to
[1:35:19] tell you amen amen he wasn't looking for
[1:35:22] a consensus among the Apostles he said
[1:35:24] God has shown me this and I'm going to
[1:35:26] show you this hallelujah amen how that
[1:35:29] by Revelation he made known unto me the
[1:35:31] mystery as I wrote before you in few
[1:35:33] words whereby when you read you may
[1:35:36] understand my knowledge in the mystery
[1:35:37] of God so when so this is what he said
[1:35:40] I'm just reading the Bible amen I want
[1:35:42] to go into this because it's
[1:35:44] amazing you know but he said this is the
[1:35:46] mystery I've been told and I'm telling
[1:35:48] you that when you when you read it you
[1:35:50] may understand you need so what he's
[1:35:53] saying is you need to catch my
[1:35:54] Revelation that's if you you need to
[1:35:57] understand what I have received I didn't
[1:35:59] go to Jerusalem to get this I didn't
[1:36:00] speak to Peter about this I received it
[1:36:02] directly from the
[1:36:06] Lord where are
[1:36:08] we which in other Ages was not made
[1:36:11] known Unto the Sons of men so what I'm
[1:36:12] telling you they did not know what I'm
[1:36:15] telling you Moses didn't know what I'm
[1:36:17] telling you David didn't know what I'm
[1:36:18] telling you Abraham didn't know what I'm
[1:36:20] telling you Isaiah didn't know
[1:36:22] hallelujah it's been headen but now I'm
[1:36:24] going to tell you I'm going to tell you
[1:36:26] what it means Hallelujah are you
[1:36:28] following me that the Gentiles should be
[1:36:31] fellow amen by the gospel wherefore I
[1:36:34] was sorry which is now revealed let's go
[1:36:37] back to verse 5 again so which in other
[1:36:38] Ages was not made known Unto the Sons of
[1:36:40] men but it's now revealed unto His Holy
[1:36:43] Apostles and Prophets by the spirit so
[1:36:45] what they didn't know now is being
[1:36:47] declared Hallelujah the Apostle Paul was
[1:36:49] actually moving into new territory amen
[1:36:52] amen you follow me he was breaking new
[1:36:53] revelation and he didn't ask Peter what
[1:36:56] it meant he just received it from God
[1:36:57] and he gave it out Hallelujah and he
[1:37:00] says in other parts of the scripture he
[1:37:01] says well if they don't see what I
[1:37:02] believe they're just blind the God of
[1:37:04] this world has blinded them that's why
[1:37:06] they don't see
[1:37:07] it you read the New
[1:37:10] Testament he wasn't apologetic he was
[1:37:12] just saying this is how it is if people
[1:37:14] don't see it they're just blind if they
[1:37:16] don't understand what I'm writing I mean
[1:37:18] they they're just blinded by the God of
[1:37:19] this world that's right Hallelujah but
[1:37:21] he's saying now it was been hidden now
[1:37:23] it's been Reve revealed Hallelujah that
[1:37:25] that' be to the Holy Apostles and
[1:37:28] Prophets by the spirit amen that the
[1:37:30] Gentiles should be fellows of the same
[1:37:32] body and partakers of his promise in
[1:37:34] Christ by the gospel wherefore I made a
[1:37:36] minister according to the gift of the
[1:37:38] grace of God given unto me by the
[1:37:40] effectual working of his power he was
[1:37:43] not he was not reluctant to say these
[1:37:47] things but these kind of statements are
[1:37:50] very inflammatory in this day and age
[1:37:52] that we live that's right amen if the
[1:37:54] Apostle Paul was alive in this
[1:37:56] generation he would have been he would
[1:37:59] have been murdered on social media amen
[1:38:02] he would have been murdered on social
[1:38:03] media his his his word would have been
[1:38:05] cast to the ground he would have been
[1:38:07] labeled as a fanatic and and Outcast
[1:38:09] right amen but he was not he was not
[1:38:12] ashamed he said I'm not ashamed of the
[1:38:14] Gospel of Jesus Christ amen amen he knew
[1:38:18] who he was he was so gripped by that
[1:38:21] visitation on the road to Damascus amen
[1:38:24] he said I met the Lord Jesus Christ he
[1:38:26] has come and met me he was not
[1:38:29] ashamed amen and his life was now a
[1:38:32] living witness that he met the Lord now
[1:38:35] if he was so unashamed how about you and
[1:38:39] I that doesn't mean you just blast it to
[1:38:41] the four corners of the Earth but you
[1:38:42] live a life I know who I've been called
[1:38:45] by I wasn't called by man you read you
[1:38:47] got to read so many of his Epistles I
[1:38:49] was not called by men I was I'm an
[1:38:52] apostle of Jesus Christ Jesus Christ has
[1:38:54] called me how you say well I'm not an
[1:38:57] apostle brother Ben you've been called
[1:38:58] by God youve been called by the Lord
[1:39:01] Jesus Christ Hallelujah so now if that's
[1:39:03] the same way we should be unashamed of
[1:39:06] what God has made us amen if I've been
[1:39:08] redeemed I've been redeemed if I'm a new
[1:39:11] creature I'm a new Creature if he says
[1:39:13] I'm an overcomer I'm an overcomer if he
[1:39:15] says I'm more than a conqueror I'm more
[1:39:17] than a conqueror Hallelujah if he said
[1:39:19] that's what I am that's what I am if
[1:39:21] Daddy said Daddy said my daddy's the
[1:39:24] biggest than all the daddies Hallelujah
[1:39:26] so so my daddy said I'm just going to
[1:39:28] take my daddy's word and if someone
[1:39:31] comes to you and says no you are not you
[1:39:33] are not a Christian I'd say hold on look
[1:39:35] at the life in this word and look at my
[1:39:37] life and my life should reflect this
[1:39:41] hallelujah amen because we are living
[1:39:44] manifest we are living proof that he
[1:39:47] rose from the dead
[1:39:48] hallelujah how do you know he lives
[1:39:51] because I met him one day amen and he
[1:39:53] changed my life when I wasn't looking
[1:39:56] for him he found me now I might get it
[1:39:59] wrong but it says that Mercy goodness
[1:40:01] and mercy shall follow thee all the days
[1:40:02] of thy life it says in the Old Testament
[1:40:05] where's that effect that word follow
[1:40:06] actually means to chase after and
[1:40:08] capture and to actually get hold of
[1:40:10] chase after and and and pursue and get
[1:40:13] amen so when I wasn't looking for his
[1:40:15] goodness and mercy it was hunting me
[1:40:17] down GL and it found me Hallelujah and I
[1:40:21] trust it's the same thing with you and I
[1:40:23] when you weren't looking for God God was
[1:40:25] looking for you you say well I sought
[1:40:28] God no no man seeks God God seeks man
[1:40:32] amen it says in the Book of Romans not
[1:40:34] one seeks after him not one but he found
[1:40:37] you and there was something he put that
[1:40:39] Gan seed in you that responded when his
[1:40:43] word came your way something in you said
[1:40:46] yes yes Father amen my father my father
[1:40:50] oh yes Hallelujah and you had a and God
[1:40:52] reveal to you man didn't reveal it to
[1:40:54] you you know if man can you know the
[1:40:57] most dangerous words a person can say
[1:40:59] about the message is it makes
[1:41:01] sense because that's just up here amen
[1:41:05] it should go more than just making sense
[1:41:07] it's got to be anchored down in here
[1:41:09] because someone can come along with an
[1:41:10] argument that makes more sense and can
[1:41:12] talk you out of it but if God has
[1:41:14] revealed himself to you personally amen
[1:41:17] that you can be like the Apostle Paul I
[1:41:19] shall not be moved hallelujah hallelujah
[1:41:21] I know I know in whom I have belied and
[1:41:24] am persuaded that he's able to keep that
[1:41:26] which I've given to him against that day
[1:41:29] Hallelujah so I think we should be
[1:41:32] unashamed oh yes amen you mean God would
[1:41:35] use me as a billboard
[1:41:38] absolutely absolutely you look at the
[1:41:40] category of people God used in the
[1:41:42] scripture amen we are no different
[1:41:45] Hallelujah that's right amen let's just
[1:41:47] leave it there shall we we have the
[1:41:49] musicians please I trust it's a
[1:41:51] different day for you the life you now
