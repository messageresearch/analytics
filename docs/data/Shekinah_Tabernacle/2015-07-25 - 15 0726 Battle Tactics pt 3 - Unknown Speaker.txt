amen amen amen hallelujah amen thank you music amen well it's good to see everyone out this morning good to have the moodies back amen praise the Lord amen God bless you all uh if you'd like to um take your Bibles and and we'll turn to uh Revelations chapter 3 I'd like to um continue on I've been speaking on about battle plans Battle Tactics and uh I want to just go into some things we we see uh there's many prophecies in the Bible that that is the plan of the enemy and we just just want to go on to them today uh we're just going to read here from I'm sure it's very familiar por of scripture to everyone but we're going to read about the time that we're alive in and we'll go to Revelations 3 and ver14 and it says here and unto the angel of the church the lady o sins right these things sayith the amen the faithful and true witness the beginning of the creation of God I Know Thy works and thou art neither cold or hot uh I would that thou were cold or hot so then because Thou Art luk Wan neither cold or hot I will spew thee out of my mouth because thou sayest I am rich and increase with goods and have need of nothing knowest not that thou art riched and miserable poor and blind and naked I counsel thee to buy of me gold tried in the fire that thou mayest be rich and white rment that thou mayest be clothed and that the shame of thy nakedness do not appear and anoint thine eyes with i s that they may see as many as I love I rebuke and chase him be zealous therefore and repent behold I stand the door and knock If any man hear my voice and open the door I will come into him and will s with him and he with me to him that overcometh will I grant to sit with me in my throne even as I overcame and am sit down with my father in his throne he that hath an ear Le him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches amen and we'll just go to 1 Corinthians chapter 14 we'll just read uh one verse there amen anden you thankful you it says if any man hear my voice and we have he heard his voice in the this end time Hallelujah uh just as a context we're just going to read 1 Corinthians 14:8 and it says here for if the trumpet give an uncertain sound who shall prepare himself to the battle amen may the Lord bless his word you may be seated so I want to uh I want to look into now uh the the working of the enemy and I want to see because with a battle how you know to prepare your for battle you you know I'm just going to review some things very quickly but to prepare yourself for battle you must know three things you must know what your Battlefield is you must know your enemy and his tactics and his weapons and then you must know you and your tactics and your weapon if you don't know any of those three you're going to get whipped if you don't know what your Battlefield is how can you prepare for the battlefield if you don't know how the enemy is going to use his weapon or what weapon he he has how can you be prepared to counter that weapon so we must know all these three things and we see that that Battlefield intelligence in the Bible is prophecy because intelligence tells you what the enemy is going to do and we can see in the scripture that God has not only revealed himself in this end time but he's revealed Satan and his workings so we can look into the scripture and we can see now what he intends to do and how he's going to do it Hallelujah aren't you glad that the enemy is exposed in this time that he cannot hide in this world but he is exposed amen and I just want to read uh just a few portions of scripture we'll just go to Isaiah 14 and um I'm sure you know most of these things are familiar because brother Bram tells us we must we must we must study our enemy we must study our opponent because if you don't study him how you going to be able to combat what he does so he tells us we must study him so I think we should give take the advice of Malachi 4 and actually study our opponent so we see here in Isaiah 14 and verse 12 and now this is the uh this is the ambition of the devil this is what he wants to do this is what he has planned in his mind this is what I'm going to achieve and he and and we read here it says how Thou Art fallen from Heaven o Lucifer son of the morning how Thou Art cut down to the ground that did US weaken the Nations for thou Hast said in thine heart I'll Ascend into heaven I'll exalt my throne above the stars of God I will sit also upon the Mount of the congregation and the sides of the north I will Ascend above the heights of the clouds I will be like the most high yet Thou shalt be brought down to Hell to the sides of the pit they that see thee shall narrowly look upon thee and consider thee saying is this the man that made the Earth to tremble that did Shake kingdoms that made the world as a Wilderness and destroyed the cities thereof that open not the house of his prisoners so we see that the enemy's ambition he says I will be like God I will be worshiped and it's amazing that it says and they that see him shall you look upon him and say is this the man and I trust you you can put yourself in that scripture because a lot of people can't see the enemy but when he is brought down into hell when he has because he said I will Ascend but he is he has been cast down and we are the ones that are ascending today and we can see here that this word says He Shall Ascend but he has been cast down and it says that they that see thee shall narrowly look upon thee and consider thee well we're going to consider this one in his real State this one that's been brought down into the pits of hell they that see the hey we've seen the in this day we see what he does we're not we're not ignorant of the devil's devices Hallelujah so he says I'll be like the most high other words he's saying I'll be God I'll be worshiped this is his ambition and then let's go to Second Thessalonians and I and we're just going to read here as well and 2 Thessalonians and we'll read uh chapter 2 and and verses 1 to6 now Paul Paul is speaking he's speaking to a people and he's trying to establish you know stabilize their faith here and he says now we beseech you Brethren by the coming of our Lord Jesus and by our gathering together unto him and we've gathered to him that you be not soon shaken of mind or troubled neither by Spirit nor by word nor by letter as from us as at the day of the Lord is at hand let no man deceive you by any means for that day shall not come except there come a falling away first and that man of sin be revealed the son of predition who opposeth and exalted himself above all that is called God or that is worshiped so that he as God sth in the temple of God showing himself that he is God remember ye not that when I was with you I told you these things and you know what withholdeth that he might be revealed in his time for the mystery of iniquity doth already work only he who now leth which is the Holy Ghost will let until he be taken out of the way so Paul is saying don't be troubled by these things he said the day of the Lord is not coming until until there is a great pulling away so he's speaking of a future event and he says now that there will be a great falling away and then and then Satan will come in himself and be worshiped as God so he's speaking of a future event but he's saying now that the mystery of iniquity do already work and and I think it's James or John he says that the spirit of antichrist is already here we're not waiting for him to come it's already working among among the people so but Paul is speaking of a future event so we can see that what what Paul is speaking now to the church what Isaiah is speaking is is exactly the same thing and so his ambition now is to be worshiped as God and it also says that you know Revelations 13 and verse 8 I'll just read it quickly and all that dwell upon the Earth shall worship Him whose names are not written in the Book of Life of the lamb slain from the foundation of the world if any man have an ear let him here so John so he says all that is that encompasses everyone whose name is not written on the Lamb's Book of Life shall worship him so he's going to be worshiped and we and we understand from the reading you know of the scripture and by and by what what what the prophet of God taught us in this day that this is the day where he is fully worshiped as the God of this world and we understand by because the devil he he's just a um he just repeats his method the method he used against Eve is the same method he comes and tries against you and we see that in that that against Eve we know that he took the the word of God and he twisted it so he gave 99% truth 1% era to Eve and and and he preached to her and she received what he was preaching and then that's how she fell from behind the word of God and that's and that's his method all the way through US he'll take the word of God and he'll craft an idol out of that word and then he'll present it to the people and the people will worship that Idol and they're not worshiping God anymore and we'll go on that a bit more but we have he says this in Satan's Eden in 1965 and to me this is astounding but he says he says the God of this world today the worship person of this world today is Satan and people are ignorant of worshiping Satan but it's Satan impersonating himself as the church this what we read in second Thessalonians see as the church they worship Satan thinking they are worshiping God through the church but it's the way Satan has done it oh you say but wait a minute we preach the word look back here at my text tonight Satan was the one preached the word to eeve first God has said see it's the misconstruing that part of the scripture that applies to the day he will let you know all that Jesus did was perfectly well he will let you know all that Moses did was perfectly well but when it when but when you take the promises that he gave for this day then that was applied to another age that's all he has to do see is to get the people to believe it that way that's all for you cannot take one word away from it or one add one word to it uh that but that's what he does people ignorantly worshiping Satan thinking they're worshiping God as we're warned in the prophecy of 2 Thessalonians and then he and then he reads the scripture that we just read so he's saying he's saying all the Satan has to do is say the promise for this age that God is a lot in his word he says he says all he has to do is get you to believe that's in another time that's that's all he has to do because we know our lord Jesus is The Great I Am he's the present God and he he is sure he was in history and he will be in the future but he's he's fulfilling his word right now and where he's fulfilling his word is where he is and I want to be where he is amen I'm not interested you know I'm excited about going walking on streets of gold but we're not there yet what is he doing here today we must be where he is the present God Amen so we we need to look into the word and not only see out the scripture that must be fulfilled in this hour but we must see what the devil is doing in this hour as well so a a historical God is a is an idol only a historical God is an idol right amen only a god of the future is is an idol as well because he's not he's not there he's here amen so we want to we want to look into the word and he says also he says he says that deceitfulness of the church today the son of predition the devil the son of predition the devil the them people worshiping Satan in this day thinking they're worshiping God but they're worshiping him through a Creed and man-made denominations and Creeds that's brought people right down to the greatest deception that the world has ever known of Amen the people can use the name of Jesus Christ they can use scripture but as the enemy has as has comeing and he's toen those scriptures and he's fashioned of God out of the word and those people think being sincere people it's the system is the cursed thing and those poor people are trapped in that system but that system is fashioned and Idol out of the word of God and presented it to the people and then they think they're worshiping Jesus Christ that's right he says it's the greatest deception there's ever been now in order in order for uh era to be to be accepted the truth must be rejected first and we can see this when when uh Jesus is on trial and pilate tries to tries to let him go and there's the feast time and then pilate brings uh you know brings it before the people do you want Jesus or do you want barabus and this barabus we you know from reading the scripture we see that he was a he was a murderer and he he committed murder during an Insurrection so he was he was part of a rebellion against the government in that time and he was a murderer and pilate said do you want Jesus or barabus and the people said give us barabus he says what shall we do with this Jesus crucify him and it's interesting because you know what what they were receiving the people they were receiving they were identifying themselves with a murderer and rejecting the Prince of Life and even his very name is incredible you know barabus it's of it's of cheli origin so it's a Babylonian name of origin and it means to be it means arrogancy Majesty PP PR to be proud to be swelling so and he so this this barabus uh and also barabus is the son of ABBA that's what the name you know but so this barabus was the son of arrogancy majesty PP he was he was proud and he and his attributes was he was a murderer and you can trace that right back to Cain you can trace that right back to the to the Devil Himself I will Ascend I'll be like the most high he made a more beautiful kingdom than than Michael did was that P Majesty proud arrogant wasn't willing to yield himself to what God would have done and so the people accepted they were identifying with that man they wanted that man we'll receive this one we won't receive that one and so they received you know they received a murderer and what happens is now if the church rejects the spirit of God what do they receive they receive the spirit of the devil you know it's just it's really that it's really that flat it's just how it is so they they were rejecting the Prince of Life they couldn't identify themselves with this Man From Galilee all they could do is identify themselves with this man barabus and they rejected the Prince of Life and they were accepting a spirit of murder a proud AR you look at the scribes and Pharisees they were proud they were arrogant they had their pump they you know they dressed all right and they did they showed everything on the outside and went through their ceremonies and pretended to be so holy in these things what were they pump was all pump proud arrogant amen and they are murderers as well yes it was in them to murder the Prince of Life they consented how can we destroy this man right amen right so when they received barabus they were just receiving what was in them to begin with but the woman at the well or you take you know Peter James or John or whoever it was when they received the lamb as many as received him gave you power to become the sons of God hallelujah when when the woman at the well saw saw our lord Jesus she was accepting amen really what was what she was meant to be glory hallelujah amen it's the same thing with us friends when you reject this world and you know when light comes across your path amen when this message came across your path and you said that's me mean this is the real me you're identifying really not only where you're from but really the real you amen hallelujah amen we want to we want to do that Glory it's such a difference now you know when when when Paul is speaking about Jesus in Philippians 2 he says let this mind be in you which was also in Christ Jesus totally opposite now to barabus and those lot who being in the form of God thought it not to be robbery to be equal with God he made himself of no reputation but took upon himself the form of a servant and was made in the likeness of men so he he made himself he's the king of glory and he made himself the L of the low he made he was the meek and lowly one and this this same he said Paul saying let this mind let this attitude let this way of being be in you which is also in your king you know he's saying let this mind be in you and you say well what did he do he submitted himself to the word that was allotted to him that's what he did when he was in the garden he said not my will but thy will be done he said for this cause I've come into the world and so he submitted himself to the scripture because he remember he was a man he was he he was fully God he was fully man and he had to look into the word and see what word he had to fulfill and he had to subject himself you know he would have read Isaiah 53 when he goes up to mount Transfiguration Moses and Elijah appear to him one of the accounts said they begin to tell him what he must accomplish at Jerusalem and they begin to preach to him you must fulfill Isaiah 53 you are the one that that that Isaiah was talking about you must be wounded for our transgressions you must be bruised for our iniquity that chastisement of our peace must be upon you and by your stripes we shall be healed so they begin to preach to the lamb this is what you must accomplish and in his Humanity he took that word and he subjected himself to that word amen and he was obedient to death he went to the Cross Hallelujah Glory but the thing is he wasn't just looking at that he was looking at you he saw that joy that was set before him and that joy is you amen he saw it was more than just him dying but he was going to race he said destroy this Temple and in 3 days I'll raise back up again glory amen and that word destroy actually means a loosening loose me from this Temple Hallelujah he didn't just want to be with his people you want to be in his people said loose me from the temple so I can have real Fellowship amen with my with my children Hallelujah Glory blessed his name amen glory so we must be willing to remember let this mind that was in Christ Jesus be in you so we must be willing to subject ourselves say Lord what does your word say of me what would you have me do amen now you got to take the you know it's like when they had to eat the lamb in the days of Exodus they had to eat the whole lamb not just the nice chops and whatever you like about the lamb all the all the yucky bits I'll just put it all the yuck they had to eat it all eat the whole thing some things in the word are very pleasant you're going in a Rapture you have eternal life hallelujah amen your joint ears with Christ other things seem like a reproach other things seem don't seem so pretty people may think well you know I'm you know but I look oldfashioned how I live and all these things I have to do that's not about doing it's about a love relationship if you love him Lord I want to be pleasing to you amen what would you have me do Lord amen oh here it is do this yes Lord I love you I'm so glad I can do it for you hey David's David's Mighty Men his smallest desire his desire was I need to drink from the well his and that smallest desire became a great commandment to them and they didn't even ask for permission they just went and got the water amen and if that is if that is the attribute of a believer in that day Gentile believer how much more in this day amen when the bride of Christ doesn't just have a have a Earthly King but a Heavenly King they say what would you have me do Lord what would you have me do amen amen hallelujah hallelujah you know this this word you know it says in Hebrews 13 He says let us there go let us go forth therefore unto him without the camp bearing his reproach for here we have no continuing City but we seek one to come so Paul he says let's we must bear his reproach but the reason we bear his reproach is because we we've met the the king of that City and mean we know where we're going that's why all these things of life you know people look at you and you think you're mad why would you live this way there's no fun being this way why don't you do all these things you say I've met the king of a city and it's an eternal City and I'm going to that City he's given me what I need to get to that City it's everything else who cares about everything else this world won't even be a memory amen not that far away Hallelujah glory amen Amen brother Ed one shared with me Wednesday night he said you from Luke 6 woe unto you that all uh when all men speak well of you for so did their fathers to the false prophets so you don't saying good it's people speak good of you woe unto you if everyone speaks well of you you don't you don't just try and be weird you just you just live the word let the word live in you amen that's all we need to do yes sir you know Paul you know Peter said you you're a peculiar people what does that mean a strange people you don't have to try and be strange you just become one with this it'll make you different we're Anointed with a very different Spirit to the spirit that's out there in this world and the sooner we just come come to peace with that they hated our Lord they hated the disciples they hated the Believers all the way down through am and they have and they're waiting for without us they're not made perfect and they're waiting for you to come to your position to take a Rapture in this hour amen so we might as well just have peace the devil you know the world's not going to like us that's all right I'd rather be friends with Jesus than friends with with with the world amen amen hallelujah hallelujah blessed be now the CH so the church by accepting barabus was identifying the spirit on them to be proud arrogant murdering Spirit now this would then repeat in the early early church with the Antichrist Spirit coming in in the form of deception of the Deeds of the nicians uh in the Ephesian age where man would fashion ungodly things out of the word of God and give it to the people now let's just go to Romans chapter 1 I'm just going to show you how this is this is so [Music] he says here in Romans chapter 1 and we at verses 17 down to 23 so Paul's speaking here he says for therein is the righteousness of God reveals from Faith to Faith at is is written the just shall live by faith for the wrath of God is revealed from Heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men who hold the truth in unrighteousness because they which may be known of God is Manifest in them for God has shown it unto them for the invisible things of him from the creation of the world the clearly seen being understood by the things that are made even his eternal power and godhead so that they are not without excuse because that when they knew God they glorified him not as God neither were thankful but became vain in their imaginations and their foolish heart was darkened professing themselves to be wise they became fools and changed the glory of The Incorruptible God into an image made like un corruptible man and and to birds and four-footed beasts and creepy things wherefore God also gave them up to uncleanness through the lust of their own Hearts to dishonor their own bodies between themselves so they took they took they saw you can see God in nature brother Braham said nature was his first Bible and you can see God in nature and they took they took this God that made all things and then they fashioned an idol and then they took an attribute I'll show you in the gods of the Egyptians they took an attribute of God and they made an idol and they made that a God I'll bring it into the Christian world so you take for example you take the Egyptian gods you know you take um you I just I don't I don't know how to pronounce these names um um oseris he's the god of the afterlife death life and Resurrection so he's one God uh uh apus with uh who is a bull he is the god of strength and fertility and Horus is the god of the sun and kingship what have they done God is a king God is the god of the Resurrection he's the god of life and death he's the god of strength he's the god of fertility God of life lifegiving amen he's the god of the son he made the son and he's a king amen those are all attributes of God they've taken from the one true God and they split those attributes down and made Gods out of those attributes and what is that idolatry oh that's idolatry now that same thing you can do with this Bible yes and that's what people have done they have taken attributes of God and then made that this is Jesus here we go God is a god of love God loves everybody don't judge anyone what he is a god of love so God so loved the world he gave his only begotten son amen this this is a love letter to you yes God is a god of love you know God wants to bless you amen plant your seed and he'll bless you look how prosperous we are God will bless you hallelujah look at all this stuff of God God is a god of prosperity y amen but he gives you the character to use that prosperity and prosperity doesn't mean he's blessing you and being poor doesn't mean he's cursing you amen Sunshine doesn't mean God is pleased and Rain doesn't mean he's displeased amen you know Jesus is a god of mercy and forgiveness he is a god of mercy and forgiveness but don't take it too far yes amen you know they say you know Jesus is a non-judgmental God and they take a scripture so here we go we're going to Fashion This Is How They fashion Matthew 71 judge not that that ye be not judged and that word judge actually means to to condemnation so don't condemn L you be condemned that's what it's actually saying but people say it's a sin to judge what has happened they fashioned an idol and they're prostrating themselves in front of that Idol that's right amen John 7:24 Jesus said also he he said judge not according to their parents but judge righteous judgment yes so the only way you can reconcile them he says judge not in other words don't condemn L you be condemned it says judge righteous judgment so the Saints are called to be able to judge between right and wrong amen we're not just to blindly go on and say go yeah it's all flowers and sunshine and and picnics and everyone's happy and we're all going to get to heaven there's going to be people who are not getting to heaven right but there's a group that's going to heaven I want to be in that number amen I don't want to be those who who reject him so we can see just from those illustrations they take God and they fashion Idols out of God and then they worship that and they're worshiping Satan through that Idol but it's but but they say it's Jesus it's an idol being crafted out of the word amen you see let's just go to First Kings 12 I'm just going to we're just going to jump to here now remember this is important because of this is this is Satan's method all the way down it's the same method here cuz he wants to be worshiped now Kings 12 1 Kings 12 and we'll read verses 25-31 now this is just after the the Kingdom's been split after Solomon and this is this is this is the one who's been given the 10 tribes he says then jeroboam built built uh uh shisham in Mount Ephraim and dwelt therein and went out from th and built a a pineal and and jobah said in his heart now shall the kingdom return to the House of David if this people go up to sacrifice in their house uh of the Lord at Jerusalem then shall the heart of this people turn uh again unto their lord even to reom the king of Judah and they shall kill me and go again to rabom King of Judah whereupon the king took counsel and made two carves of gold and said unto them it is too much for you to go up to Jerusalem and behold thy Gods o Israel that brought thee up up out of the land of Egypt and he set one in bethl and the other he put in Dan and this thing became a sin for the people went to worship before one even unto den and he made a house of high places and made priests of the lowest people which were not of the sons of levite so he's he's devised now don't go to the God's provided place of worship because remember in Deuteronomy God said is a place you shall not not worship in every gate but you shall wor Worship in the gate where I put my name yes and we know that that was that was at the Tabernacle in the wilderness that's where he he he he put his place of worship so this King devised way now that that the people the Israelite people God's covenant people wouldn't worship God where God wanted to be worshiped but he built these two golden cares that the people would go to another place and they' worship and you see these are the gods that brought you out of out of Egypt what that he took an attribute of God being a deliverer being a redeemer being a one that places you in the promised land he took those attributes and put them into golden Cales worship these Gods amen yes and he he did this now and he said these are your Gods Israel this is your god that's how so they go before the thing and they could literally say we're worshiping Jehovah God in this place they weren't they weren't worshiping God they're worshiping Satan and it's the same thing today you you can you just bring that into today there's a chosen place of worship where God has put his name today and God put his name in his son Christ Jesus and the only way you can worship in that chosen place is to be under the blood of his son and the only way you can be under the blood is if the spirit of God dwells in you I mean if the life of God is in you then you're in God's chosen place of worship you know many times we we read the scripture if you abide in me and my words abide in you ask what you will and it shall be and some people take that from a Methodist point of view and they say if I read it enough if I listen enough if I do enough then I'm abiding in the word but that true abiding in the word of my word God himself dwells in you if I dwell in you the living Christ comes and dwells in you then ask what you will and it shall be amen that is God's provided place of worship and the same time as being in Jesus Christ amen the very life life of God comes and dwells in you that means you're in that place and you can't leave that place if you're sealed in Hallelujah am so that was his tactic now to to get the people to worship somewhere else and because they were Israelites they thought we're God's chosen people God cannot destroy us that was that was their attitude all the way down when Jeremiah preached against him Amos came down all those prophets were saying judgment's coming you better turn back to God they were so comfortable in their in their way of living I thought God won't destroy us God is a god of love God loves us well what happen happened hey God is a god of love and mercy and redemption and forgiveness he's those things he's also a god of judgment and wrath never forget that part of him too you got to take the whole character of God you know when Paul said Jesus Christ is same yesterday today and forever he's saying God is a being not the way he appears but himself what he loves what he hates it doesn't change right does not change amen that's right so now this is this brother Braham is in God of this evil age he says God is a good god you're in his holy church why you cannot die but God said you would that settles it see him today oh just belong to church it ain't what you do or this or that or the other just come to church be a good member cutting your hair that's nonsense wearing shorts putting on p uh uh paint and going to dance this little bear once in a while won't hurt you as long as you don't indulge in it frankly I wish your children would take it so that you could learn whether you liked it or not there he is the God of this evil age see it sound it sounds all right it sounds all right but it's actually what he's saying there he is you know there it is he says there he is the God of this evil age this evil age God is a good god I've heard that so much till I get sick God is a God of Justice he ain't no Doty grandpa that can be pushed around and his grandkids don't have any sin he's a god of justice and Holiness he proved it in the Garden of Eden by his first children you cross that line of one of his words you're dead same thing applies today and notice he preached that kind of a scientific social educated Progressive gospel to Eve and Adam's bride believed it and she and he has succeeded in filling the soall bride of Christ the Church of the second I mean the Church of the second Adam with the same arguments that's right oh it's not for God God is too good to do it why as long as you go to church if thou believeth he says the devil believes not make believes but he actually believes he's not saved he says but he believes he tells the second bride or the second Adam's bride the same as he told the first now Divine Healing there's no such thing we can prove that been a case proved and this baptism in jesus' name now don't you realize that I'm the authority of the church he says we SLE that at I Rome when them three unclean spirits went out of the Dragon the false prophets and so forth we believe there's a trinity of gods over for goodness sake that's as Heathen as can be don't you ever come before God with such a thing as that try to stand in his presence oh it don't make any difference if you're baptized in the titles of father son Holy Ghost what difference does it make it made so much difference until Paul commanded a bunch of Baptists that they had to be re-baptized in the name of Jesus Christ before the Holy Ghost could ever come on them them and also caused the apostles to scream out and said if an angel come from heaven and preach anything else let him be cursed sure it makes a difference he says oh my but you see what has happened now is there is truth and error has separated itself out like this as time has gone by it's just gone out like this and truth you know error is all people know yes and they have this concept of God that they're born with you know and and so they try and worship God that way and then when anything come and the scripture to back it up but it's an idol I'm just going to be flat today it's just an idol and then when truth comes way it sounds extreme but the truth is right down the middle amen the truth is right down the middle you when brother brah was preaching these things he wasn't trying to pull you know he wasn't leaning too far one way to try and bring the back in the middle he was right down the middle amen God God built him that way you take Elijah in the first first time Elijah was here they had the prophets of B they had their altar they were doing all kinds of things and it said and the altar of the Lord was was fallen down right so he he rebuilt the altar that the real worship could come and and every time Elijah comes that's just how it works and that's why when he came at the end time he rebuilt the true worship of God that everything God is we can know amen and that very God can come and live in us it's not just a form of worship but that living one comes in US amen hallelujah hallelujah amen that's just how Elijah operates he rebuilds the true approach to God and it's not a fear that drives us there it's a love am me when he talked about the three pulls to get the bride the third pull would get the bride it wasn't a push it wasn't a kick a head over the head it was a pull amen amen a draw you should be drawn hallelujah amen a drawn towards God like more than anything else in this earth Hallelujah my goodness amen so it's not a you know he he just preached WR down what the Bible said and we have to be willing now what do you want to accept because when truth comes it's never pretty amen Jesus wasn't a pretty guy John the Baptist sure wasn't a pretty Gody how many times did he ever bath in his life maybe this many I don't know he's in the wilderness most of his life Hallelujah but here came here come the one to prepare the way of the Lord amen amen and that was truth and when he said you Generation of Vipers that was just how it was hallelujah amen and the elect could see hey this is actually what those people are and they receive the Lamb of God yes amen hallelujah that's why when Paul came he said don't come with an enticing man's Wisdom and all these things but in loneliness and meekness and in the power of God that you can put your confidence not in me as a man but you can put your confidence in the Living God hallelujah hallelujah hey hey didn't look pretty he comes a GU he's got this Affliction in his body he has only got one Cod he's poor and every jail in the country knows where he is cuz he's been there when he preaches and you all that you know he doesn't have such a great reputation but there was the first church age messenger and that Ministry brother R says every true Ministry pattern itself after Paul hallelujah amen amen so there we are so Hallelujah truth is never pretty to the eye but it's truth amen amen so now also what we have I want to I want to go into maybe just just shift a little bit we have you know Satan you know I know I'm sure it's obvious to you that you know he wanted to be worshiped this is how he does it he kicks the truth out they receive ear and all these things but I want to show you another thing I want to go to uh I want to just just talk about music very briefly if you don't mind now brother Brown makes this statement and he says it so this isn't ashamed of him now here's a because man there's more prophecies you know than just in the Bible but whatever brother R prophesies is in the scripture yeah now he says this an ashamed of him he says don't be ashamed of him in this generation sinful perplexed the last generation that'll ever be on the earth this sinful adulterous full of all putrified SS all everything that's been decent has become indecent National politics filth nations are are broke up way back in the jungles of Africa on Safari Hunters they had to take a high powerered radio to hear Alvis Presley Pon and them guys with that rock and roll and twist and the natives trying to see them act along jerking their head acting like that the natives stood and looked at that but you see they're not Americans like Pat bur and Alvis Presley and Ricky Nelson and them guys are they they're not judases of that type it's a spirit and the spirit is not only in America it spread itself all over the world to bring them to the battle of Armageddon so he saying because religion but then the devil also uses other ways to to make sure his his what he wants to do is me yes because remember it says it says in Revelation 16 I saw three unclean spirits like frogs come out of the mouth of the dragon and out of the mouth of the Beast out of the mouth of the false prophet and they are the spirits of devils working miracles which go forth into the kings of the earth and the whole world to gather them to the Battle of that great day of God Almighty he says behold I come as a thief blessed is he that WTH and keepeth his garments lest he walk naked and and they see his shame and they and he gathered them together into a place called in the Hebrew tongue armagen he's saying now he's going to gather everyone to this place for this final final battle and brother BR saying now is that this spirit because music music is not entertainment m music is to call God or Satan that is that is just all music's for it's not it's not to be entertaining it calls two powers and whatever music you play or call whatever power you want and it's not even about the type of music that's played it's the spirit motiv motivating the ones playing it yes so he said that this this spirit will spread over all the Earth to bring the people to Armageddon now music is a lot more powerful than I think we realize you as I said it's it's to call God or Satan on the scene and Elisha when he's standing before you know the king of you know King King Jehoshaphat and then there's another king there you know and and they want to see which way they should go in the battle and Elisha says you know he says he says as the Lord liveth before whom I stand surely were it not that I regard the presence of Jehoshaphat the king of of Judah I would not look toward thee nor see thee speaking to the evil King but he says but bring me a Minstrel he said the minstrel began to play in the hand of God Came Upon him and he prophesied and then David the same way when he would play that evil spirit would leave Saul amen and that's and then also there was another king in in in 2 Chronicles and when he went into battle when he was fighting against three nations he sent singers before the Army amen he sent singers before the battle was join joined and they won a great Victory there that's why we sing before we hear the preaching of the word that's why we sing because we're entering into a battle am mean where faith and doubt is set in Array and the devil's trying to withhold am mean the blessings of God and then we create an atmosphere Hallelujah then God descends amen that's why I always pray anoint the musicians amen amen anoint the singers amen that God can come down and and and he can do what he wants to do Hallelujah that's why we sing amen but but then you take that on the flip side if you if you sing for Satan he'll come sure is the world he'll come amen so we we must we must look now he uses the enemy uses music to spread his his anointing upon people and brother BR I know this is probably not all that positive but hey this is where we are you know brother B says I'm recognizing your day and and he recounts when he saw when he saw the preview of the right I'm sure you're all familiar with this but he saw you know he saw the first church come up all dressed Godly you know dressed as as Saints marching to the sound of the Gospel yes and then he saw the modern Church came up and it made him sick to the stomach and he and he felt like he just his his whole Ministry was a miserable failure he thought is this the best I can present they're all naked and dancing and all these things and they were they were they were marching to the tune of rock and roll and they being led by a witch now this and then after that then the bride came into to preview again so just as the first one came in the bride at the end will be exactly the same hallelujah hallelujah but then we have this now so this modern church so he's sing a vision but this is being lived out and I don't say this with any satisfaction of my soul that's for sure but this vision is being lived out today amen amen where people are being led by wi evil spirit and they're thinking they're worshiping God and they're doing it to the tune of rock and roll amen as I said it's not it's not necessarily the type of music that's played it's the spirit behind it motivating it so because that because you also you say well they worship Jesus Christ and say what is produced when you see the videos when you see the services online what do you see being produced in the people what is being produced is it the life of God is it the character he say well how can you just see the characteristics of God seeing photos and video you'll see it amen amen you are a light that's not you can't hide this light under a bushel it's put upon a hill everyone knows who you are they knew who Jesus was he didn't even say anything he just walked along have you come to torment us before the time he didn't tell this is me this is what I do this is all you know give him a business card he just he just was was living life same thing with a Believer today you can see a believer amen that that Spirit you know you you see a you feel a welcoming Spirit things they you know how they not near see what they say but what they do the characteristic of Christ being lived out amen so we see that he when he's talking about this he's talking about prophecy and it and it's being it's coming to its fullness in this day amen amen so this is but you say well they get they you know God you know people actually yet God does things for them in those kind of services and and they feel you say you feel the love of God when you hear the music now music is an emotional thing now this is not talking about Taste of music I like this I don't like this it's not what this is about it's talking about now music is an emotional thing Y and if and see that's where the Deception comes in they say what a wonderful service that was you can feel just a you know just you get people cry and they praise God all these things and they think they're worshiping God because they mentioned Jesus in the song yes but look at the remember the singing goes before The Battle Before the word comes amen and what does their message produce is it this in flesh or is it something else there's only two y amen amen you say well I'm so moved when I hear the songs absolutely but you got to be be careful because that that spirit is said to go into the Earth and gather to the battle of Armageddon we're not called to a battle of ared friends we're not called to go there we're not called to fight am me we're called to go up amen that is that there's exactly what we're called to do he says in the same message he says they act like that he says whatever Nation they're from Africa India whatever it's a vulgar stuff it's spread all over the Earth by just one man started it so has the gospel in the power of Mighty God has spread around the world and the separation time is now taking place when God is calling a bride and the devil's calling a church let me be part of the Bride amen he says and there's a prophet standing here he's not trying to be Sensational he says this is just how it is this is what I've seen in an unseen realm and this is what's going to come to pass and just as he prophesied of other things coming to pass this is this is already in full but thing is we were born amen you know when he was standing upon the Earth the judgments of God hadn't yet you know you come to 1964 says pick up the rock there's a great you know uh was it good Friday earthquake in Alaska almost sinks Alaska he says judgment striking the West Coast before that the Judgment had Begin to Fall he say well we're looking for a Great Tribulation it eases in it's already we're not in it yet because we don't see the Great Tribulation but the judgments are being to be poured out more more more more more then we're taking out of the way that comes in its fullness Hallelujah and we're born when the judgments of God are already falling upon the Earth yes and we think this is normal this is not normal that's not how Society was I'm not talking about the more technology it's just this is not how Society was amen what has happened we're living in the Judgment time where pre-tribulation is already here amen and then and then people here brother say he was so hard he was so polar opposite of today of course he was cuz what is a prophet of God that God was revealing himself to but to he wasn't living the time of judgment amen amen but then we have to you know I trust you're like Rahab Rahab was living in a time of judgment the whole nation was condemned but when she heard when she heard the testimony of what God did said I want Mercy amen hallelujah and she got her and her whole house under that Mercy amen and then when the whole place came down amen they walked out without a scratch Hallelujah and they and she married Salon amen became part of Israel came forth in the resurrection hallelujah hallelujah I trust you're in the same same condition amen living in the judgments of God but you hear a testimony of what God has done hallelujah she never met Joshua never saw Moses was never there in Egypt she just heard about it she said I don't want to die with everyone else because she knew that that God that poured out judgment was also a god of Mercy hallelujah hallelujah she knew the whole C all the rest of the just saw a god of judgment coming amen but she saw there was Mercy in this one that pouring out judgment there the same thing with the bride of Christ we don't see judgment we see Mercy I trust you see Mercy say Lord I want your mercy amen and then so now God is calling a bride Hallelujah the devil's calling a church amen he the devil wants to be worshiped but he we will not worship him I trust you know whatever however he comes across your path Doctrine some sickness some Affliction sometimes we have to pack those things for a while but don't let it rule you whatever you do say I Will Not Bow some some temper or impatient Spirit or whatever it is say I will not bow to that thing amen I will not I will not bow to it amen one thing let it do let it drive you to God amen amen amen that's what we should do hey Paul's Affliction it drove him to God and then he got an answer from he didn't just let it linger and say well maybe maybe God's letting me pack this thing he found out amen some people say well maybe this is the cross I have to bear find out talk to him about it because of it's not well the devil's just packing a big big weight on your back and just
