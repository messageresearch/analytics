[1:57] [Music]
[2:10] Are you sure
[2:14] [Music]
[2:21] you
[2:30] [Music]
[3:02] God bless you all this morning.
[3:05] Welcome to the house of God.
[3:09] It's always good to be here
[3:12] and it's always good to remind the devil
[3:13] of whose side we're on.
[3:16] Amen. You feeling good? You walking in
[3:18] complete victory, walking in faith. Yep.
[3:22] overcoming every obstacle,
[3:26] faithful in every trial,
[3:30] rejoicing in every situation. I knew you
[3:33] were. I knew I could have confidence in
[3:34] you all
[3:36] cuz we're all overcomers. You know, we
[3:39] we we we
[3:41] serve a God that overcame. And um I
[3:44] believe there's a scripture that says,
[3:45] "If God be for us, who can be against
[3:47] us? And greater is he that is within you
[3:49] than he that is in the world?" So if
[3:51] that means there's someone greater in
[3:52] you than whatever is in the world, then
[3:54] that means you you are greater than
[3:56] anything that could come your way in the
[3:58] world. Anything doesn't matter what it
[4:00] might be, you're greater than anything.
[4:02] Yet not I, but through Christ in me.
[4:05] Amen. So let's um stand. I believe we're
[4:07] going to have a good time this morning.
[4:08] We're going to we're going to go we're
[4:11] going to go ahead with our praise and
[4:12] our worship. You know, the Israeli army
[4:14] was such a funny army back in Bible
[4:16] days. You know, you'd you'd think you'd
[4:18] send your strong warriors first or your
[4:21] um you know, the guys would shoot the
[4:22] arrows or something, but they would send
[4:23] the singers first into the the battle
[4:26] cuz they went in rejoicing and praising,
[4:29] you know, and that's that's why we do
[4:31] this. We we go forth singing and
[4:32] rejoicing and praising and then then we
[4:34] come in with worship and then the word
[4:35] of God. So, let's just pray this
[4:37] morning. Lord Jesus, it's a wonderful
[4:39] thing that we can be here this morning
[4:40] in your presence, Lord. And we can
[4:42] already sense your presence amongst us.
[4:44] Although even if we didn't, Lord, we we
[4:47] know that where two or three gathered in
[4:49] your name, there you are in the midst,
[4:50] Lord, and yet our beings, Lord, over
[4:53] time, we've learned, Lord, to recognize
[4:55] the spirit of God and recognize an
[4:56] atmosphere, Lord. And we just thank you
[4:58] for being amongst us this morning. And
[5:00] we just pray you bless each heart. May
[5:01] we all be receptive to your word and to
[5:04] your spirit this morning, knowing that
[5:06] you only think good things for us, Lord.
[5:08] You only want the best for us in every
[5:10] situation that we find ourselves in,
[5:12] Lord. and you only want the best for us
[5:13] this morning. So we just pray you'll
[5:15] bless us and come and fill each one with
[5:17] your spirit Lord and refresh us in the
[5:18] Holy Ghost Lord. May we may we just have
[5:20] joy in our hearts this morning and may
[5:22] we go away rejoicing this morning and
[5:23] may we be like the two Lord as they
[5:26] walked on on the road to Emmas they said
[5:27] did not our hearts burn within us as he
[5:29] spoke with us along the way Lord. So may
[5:31] you speak with us this morning bless um
[5:33] brother Beny ministers and just bless
[5:35] the song service we just commit to your
[5:36] hands in Jesus wonderful name. Amen.

[34:01] Two cubits and a half shall be the
[34:03] length thereof, and a cubit and a half
[34:04] the breadth thereof. And thou shalt make
[34:07] two cherubams of gold of beaten work. Uh
[34:10] shalt thou make them in the two ends of
[34:12] the mercy seat, and make one cherub on
[34:14] one end, and the other cherub on the
[34:16] other end, even of the mercy seat. Shall
[34:18] ye make the cherubams on the two ends
[34:20] thereof? And the cherubam shall stretch
[34:23] forth their wings on high, covering the
[34:25] mercy seat with their wings, and their
[34:27] faces shall look one to another toward
[34:29] the mercy seat shall the faces of the
[34:31] cherubams be. And thou shalt put the
[34:33] mercy seat above
[34:36] upon the ark. And in the ark thou shalt
[34:38] put the testimony that I shall give
[34:39] thee. And there I will meet with thee,
[34:42] and I will commune with thee from above
[34:43] the mercy seat, from between the two
[34:46] cherubims, which are upon the ark, and
[34:47] the testimony of all things which I will
[34:50] give thee in commandment unto the
[34:53] children of Israel. Amen. So let's bow
[34:55] heads in a word of prayer. And if you
[34:57] want to be remembered, just raise your
[34:58] hand up. Say, Lord, here I am, Lord
[35:01] Jesus. Gracious Father, we just want to
[35:03] Lord, we love you. We're so glad we can
[35:05] speak your name over every situation,
[35:08] Lord God. That Father, your name is a
[35:10] name above all names. So, we thank you,
[35:13] Lord, for this moment that we can stand
[35:14] here. We can commit our lives into your
[35:16] hands. Once again, we can ask that Lord,
[35:18] you as we've read your word, Lord, may
[35:20] you anoint it to speaker and hear, dear
[35:22] God. Father, anoint all those who are
[35:24] streaming, Lord. Think of my darling
[35:25] back home, dear God. Thank you for your
[35:27] hand upon her, Lord. anyone else who is
[35:30] unwell as well be their portion. Father,
[35:32] we commit our lives into your hands. We
[35:34] thank you for this moment, Lord, in
[35:35] Jesus Christ's name. Amen. Amen. God
[35:38] bless you. So, you can have your seats.
[35:40] I um we had a great time in um
[35:42] Australia. It was great to travel with
[35:45] my two eldest daughters. I got four
[35:47] daughters and one son, so it was great
[35:49] to travel with them. Lot of fun to
[35:51] travel with them. It was good. But yeah,
[35:52] we had a really good time. Uh the youth
[35:54] camp's amazing over there. Um everyone
[35:57] needs to go. that's youth needs to go
[35:59] next year. Um 13 and up. Yes. So we had
[36:01] a blessed time with um yeah really good
[36:03] nice relaxed atmosphere, good presence
[36:05] of the Lord. Um we uh preached with
[36:08] brother Steven McNeely who's brother Ron
[36:10] Peterson's associate pastor if anyone
[36:12] knows him. He's a um yeah he's really
[36:15] good. Had a great time. Um yeah the Lord
[36:17] Yeah was good. We um so this few
[36:21] services I took there was a few
[36:22] testimonies. Uh, one was um, so I was I
[36:26] was talking about don't don't be a human
[36:28] shield to the devil, you know, don't
[36:29] reason and talking about how like here I
[36:32] got the photo here. Well, the picture
[36:33] how um, yeah, so there's the cherubims
[36:36] above the mercy seat there and and um,
[36:38] you know, how the enemy you the devil
[36:40] was made to be the anointed cherub that
[36:42] coverth and he wants to still be that
[36:43] block between you and God. Uses all
[36:45] different kinds of things. And you know
[36:47] there was a there was a young sister
[36:48] went out when I was preaching and and
[36:50] you know she was talking to herself in
[36:51] the mirror in the bathroom saying I need
[36:53] to go on a retreat and find myself. So
[36:56] she walks back into service and I just
[36:57] start preaching about you don't need to
[36:59] go on a retreat to find yourself you
[37:01] know you just need the word you'll find
[37:02] yourself in the word you know and there
[37:04] was another sister there how I was
[37:06] talking about how the devil will put us
[37:08] into a false reality and make us feel
[37:10] disconnected from everyone else. And he
[37:12] does that doesn't he right? We imagine
[37:14] things, we live, we make this little
[37:15] world, we live in it. And there was a
[37:17] sister there who said that she was doing
[37:19] that. And uh but the Lord set her free
[37:21] of that, you know. And then there was
[37:23] another brother how uh before one of the
[37:25] services, he was telling um his pastor
[37:27] saying, "Look, I just need to pull away
[37:29] and you know, you know, the things that
[37:30] are going on and I, you know, just I
[37:32] just need to pull away and stop doing so
[37:33] much and things." And you know, and then
[37:36] after the service, he said to me, that
[37:37] was a big that was like I preached their
[37:40] their trial of their life and of their
[37:42] year. and he said to his pastor after
[37:43] service, forget what I said, it's fixed.
[37:46] So, you know, many things like that
[37:47] happen. God's good. God, the word
[37:49] discerns and meets the needs and set the
[37:51] captives free. So, you know, and also
[37:53] before, you know, as we know, you know,
[37:54] Christine had the, you know, accident
[37:57] and um she told me, "You must go to
[37:59] Australia." Did I want to go? No, I
[38:03] didn't. In my humanity, I did not want
[38:05] to go, but she said, "You must go." And
[38:07] then when she was in hospital on on
[38:08] Friday having the CT scan and um you
[38:11] know she was getting upset thinking that
[38:12] I would find out and I'd get on a plane
[38:14] and come home. I was this close to doing
[38:16] that. But I told her, "Don't worry, I'm
[38:17] staying." And the Lord had has
[38:20] everything in control. Like you know, as
[38:21] soon as, as you all know, soon as the
[38:23] car hit her, the Lord put in her heart,
[38:25] all things work together for good. Those
[38:27] that love God and are called according
[38:28] to his purpose. So nothing's out of
[38:29] cater. Everything's working just fine.
[38:32] This is all working for our good. This
[38:34] is working for my good. It's working for
[38:35] her good. All things work together for
[38:38] good. If you don't believe that, wipe
[38:40] that out of your Bible. Your life will
[38:43] profess if you believe that or not. I
[38:45] believe that. Is it hard? It's hard. Is
[38:47] it difficult? It's difficult. But God is
[38:48] in control. And we look beyond what we
[38:50] see. We don't walk by sight. We walk by
[38:52] faith. Right? And the pro the word says
[38:55] by his stripes, she's healed. So I don't
[38:58] look at symptoms. I look at the promise.
[39:00] Right? You can get all caught up in what
[39:01] you see with your eyes. Your eyes will
[39:02] lie to you all the day long. Look what
[39:04] AI can do nowadays. That's right. You
[39:07] know, deep fakes and all this nonsense.
[39:08] So why do we try and walk by those
[39:10] things? We don't need to worry about
[39:12] those things. No, we trust the Lord and
[39:13] keep walking on. She's slowly improving.
[39:15] Thank you for your love, your care, your
[39:17] prayers, your support. It's been
[39:19] phenomenal. Really. So, thank you so
[39:21] much as a body. Love you so much.
[39:23] Really, it's amazing. And sorry if I
[39:25] don't reply quick enough. I need a PR
[39:27] guy, you know, or you know, secret. I
[39:29] don't know. But thank you so much. It's
[39:31] been amazing. Really appreciate it.
[39:33] We're going to get through this,
[39:34] friends. We're going to get through
[39:36] this. See, everything the devil brings,
[39:38] it actually just backfires on him.
[39:41] Everything backfires on him. Okay? So,
[39:43] we Let's not be worried. Okay? Maybe I'm
[39:46] talking to myself. Let's trust the Lord.
[39:48] Remember what most sermons I guess I've
[39:51] been preaching is don't look by don't
[39:53] walk by sight, walk by faith. And here
[39:56] we are. Praise God. Amen. God wants to
[40:00] prove his word. He's going to find
[40:01] someone to prove his word in. And here
[40:03] we are. I'd say, "Lord, prove your word
[40:04] through me." So, we don't have to be in
[40:07] despair like brother Phil with what's
[40:08] going on. The Lord's in in control. The
[40:12] footsteps of the righteous are ordered
[40:14] of the Lord. Right? Same with Margie or
[40:16] anything that's going on in our lives.
[40:17] Our footsteps are ordered of him. We
[40:19] don't need to panic or worry. God is in
[40:22] control. Worry has helped no one. Never
[40:25] since the history of man, right? It'll
[40:28] never help you now. So, why try it? Why
[40:31] not take God at his word and see what
[40:33] God can do? Amen. So, thank you so much.
[40:37] Oh, sorry. You know, I was amazed. This
[40:39] is public, but hey, I was amazed that
[40:41] you thought we'd have our family camp,
[40:44] but obviously that got vetoed last
[40:45] Sunday. That's okay. I can't get Forest
[40:48] Lakes until June, but there's the Palm
[40:52] Grove camp in Pam, which we got a whole
[40:54] bunch of dates in February, March. So
[40:57] maybe we'll go there summertime.
[41:01] Even better. So that's kind of in the
[41:04] pipeline. So it's just been postponed,
[41:06] right? So postponed, right? So yep. So
[41:11] that's just in the pipeline. So I'll get
[41:12] the and I'll get the camp registration
[41:14] forms out for um October. Sorry, it's
[41:18] coming. But we're going to have a
[41:20] glorious time. So um I just want to
[41:23] speak about I'm just going to take this
[41:24] off.
[41:26] But everyone's been good. Yep. Thank
[41:29] you, brother Isaac, brother Arman, for
[41:31] ministering while I was away. I haven't
[41:33] listened to them though, but thank you.
[41:34] Appreciate it. Um, yeah. All's well.
[41:39] All is well. Okay. So, I want to talk
[41:42] about, as I said here about the mercy
[41:44] seat in action. Now, we read here about
[41:48] the Well, maybe I'm just going to
[41:49] probably if I go through things too
[41:51] quick, forgive me. But you know, so I I
[41:55] talked a while ago about how it's the
[41:56] badge of skins, how you know, it's just
[41:58] the covering or the veil that hides the
[42:01] holy of holies, hides the presence of
[42:03] God. And we shouldn't get caught up in
[42:05] our humanity, right? Because remember
[42:08] the bad skins, the moment before God
[42:10] stepped in and the moment after he
[42:12] stepped in, they were the same badge of
[42:13] skin, right? So our humanity does not
[42:16] change just because God comes and dwells
[42:17] in us, right? We still have that war
[42:19] against the natural man and the
[42:21] spiritual man. But the spiritual man is
[42:23] stronger. But you should cater to him.
[42:25] Feed the white dog. Don't feed the black
[42:27] dog. Don't feed the flesh. Remember, the
[42:28] white dog is the real you in reality.
[42:31] Okay? So feed him. If you're getting low
[42:32] spiritually, if you find yourself
[42:34] struggling, what are you feeding, right?
[42:37] Just look at your diet. Just just do an
[42:38] inventory. Right? Remember, the flesh
[42:41] doesn't want to. Remember, one day if it
[42:43] can, the flesh will thank you that you
[42:45] dragged it to the altar, caused it to
[42:48] repent, took it to the waters of
[42:50] baptism, it'll thank you. Amen. Took it
[42:52] to the baptism of the Holy Ghost, and
[42:54] when it gets changed, it will thank you.
[42:56] Being a to drag this guy around until
[42:58] it's done, right? Praise the Lord. Amen.
[43:02] So now, so the badge of skin, our flesh
[43:04] doesn't change. And this has always been
[43:05] a wrestle down through the ages is is
[43:07] how can God be in man but yet man is
[43:10] still man and but God is God on the
[43:12] inside. Right? But but when Holy Ghost
[43:14] comes in, he starts taking dominion over
[43:17] this guy. This doesn't become a super
[43:19] duper badge of skin, same old skin,
[43:22] right? Exactly the same material, same
[43:25] characteristics, but when deity comes
[43:27] in, it changes everything. Okay? So now
[43:30] the the tabernacle also represents the
[43:33] human body. Okay. So now there's three
[43:35] three rooms of the tabernacle. There's
[43:37] I've got it on the right hand side as a
[43:39] diagram. So there's the outer court
[43:40] where the brazen altar is. Then there's
[43:42] the holy place. And then there's the
[43:43] most holy place. The most holy place is
[43:45] where the ark is where the presence of
[43:47] God dwells. And so that represents the
[43:49] soul of man. Okay? So so the outcourt
[43:53] represents the flesh and then the holy
[43:55] place represents your human spirit. Then
[43:57] the most holy place is your soul. Okay?
[43:59] But what comes out of the holy place
[44:02] controls what's in the rest of it. Okay?
[44:05] So now and and and I'll show you this
[44:07] how the Bible actually does teach that
[44:09] we have three a body, soul, and a
[44:10] spirit. Right? So first first
[44:12] Thessalonians says, "And the very God of
[44:14] peace sanctify you holy. And I pray God
[44:16] your whole spirit, soul, and body be
[44:18] preserved blameless until the coming of
[44:20] our Lord Jesus Christ." Right? So the
[44:22] Bible teaches that there are three
[44:23] rooms. Okay? So now but it's it it all
[44:28] depends on what's on in the most holy
[44:31] place will project you know what's in
[44:34] the other. Okay. So now this mercy seat
[44:39] actually speaks of the whole so where
[44:41] the cherubams are it's the actually the
[44:44] whole lid of the ark of the covenant.
[44:47] That's the mercy seat. Under that mercy
[44:50] seat is the law. There's Aaron's rod in
[44:52] there as well I think. And then there's
[44:54] a pot of mana that never gets old. Okay.
[44:56] So now when the mercy seat does see the
[44:59] but the big difference is between well I
[45:01] say there's a big difference between the
[45:03] mercy seat having the blood atonement on
[45:05] it and no blood right because when the
[45:08] blood is atoning then it's a mercy seat.
[45:11] It's actually what it's meant to be. But
[45:13] if there's no blood there becomes a
[45:14] judgment seat. So now now it comes down
[45:17] into our lives. If the blood is really
[45:20] there you are a seat of mercy.
[45:23] mercy will flow out. God will flow out.
[45:26] But if there is no blood there, then you
[45:28] are a judgmental thief.
[45:32] Okay? Because the law's still there, the
[45:34] word is there, but the blood covers that
[45:36] word, right? But if the blood's not
[45:38] there, then that then it's just law
[45:40] comes out.
[45:43] We're going to Are we here today? Okay.
[45:45] This is all everything's fine. Okay.
[45:48] Don't despair. You got to realize what
[45:50] you are. When the bride recognizes what
[45:52] she is, then the rapture will go. Right?
[45:55] So what? So God wants to live in you
[45:57] because he said that I will meet you
[45:59] between the wings of the cherubam over
[46:00] the mercy seat. Right? So God wants to
[46:02] come and dwell in your soul and then
[46:05] live his life out. Okay? So um we'll
[46:09] just read this here in Leviticus 16
[46:11] says, "And he shall take the blood of
[46:13] the bulock." This is speaking of the
[46:14] high priest now. Uh and sprinkle it with
[46:16] his finger upon the mercy seat eastward.
[46:18] them before the mercy seat shall he
[46:19] sprinkle of the blood with his finger
[46:21] seven times. Then thou shalt kill the
[46:23] goat of the sin offering um that is for
[46:26] the people and bring his blood within
[46:27] the veil and do with that blood as he
[46:29] did with the blood of the bulock.
[46:30] Sprinkle it upon the mercy seat and
[46:32] before the uh upon the mercy seat and
[46:34] before the mercy seat and he shall make
[46:36] an atonement for the holy place because
[46:38] the uncleanness of the children of
[46:39] Israel and because of their
[46:40] transgressions and all their sins. And
[46:42] so shall he do for the tabernacle of the
[46:45] congregation that remainth among them in
[46:47] the midst of their uncleanness. So there
[46:49] has to be blood upon the mercy seat for
[46:50] an atonement. Right? You know the blood
[46:52] is applied because the Holy Spirit
[46:54] abides,
[46:56] right? Okay. So
[46:59] this this comes into I just want to I
[47:02] feel like I'm
[47:06] we'll just get somewhere. Okay. Now we
[47:09] have been ordained in this day to be
[47:11] partakers of God's divine nature.
[47:14] Right? So now we live in a day where if
[47:19] you want to see Jesus, you should see it
[47:21] in you and I. You should see him in you
[47:23] and I. His character, his nature, his
[47:26] attitude should live through us. Right?
[47:28] We all have different personalities. God
[47:31] doesn't make us all the same
[47:32] personality, but he gives us the same
[47:35] nature. Okay? And God wants that.
[47:38] Remember, if there's blood on the mercy
[47:40] seat, then his divine nature starts to
[47:42] come forth. But if it's not there, it's
[47:44] our religious humanity will come forth.
[47:47] No one wants to be religious.
[47:50] We want to be Christians, right? And
[47:52] this is what we have ordained to be is
[47:54] to be real, genuine, washed by the
[47:56] blood, filled with the Holy Ghost
[47:58] Christians. This is what the message
[48:00] came to do. It has not come to give us a
[48:02] bunch of theory that does not work. And
[48:04] I think in the past what has happened is
[48:06] there's there's you know there's been a
[48:07] period from when brother Brham died for
[48:10] 40 years there was a time of wandering
[48:11] in the wilderness of the bride just like
[48:14] it was when Moses you know you they're
[48:16] in the wilderness for 40 years what was
[48:18] there fussing fighting church splits
[48:21] right God did things God fought battles
[48:24] but it wasn't but the word that came on
[48:26] Sinai was never for the wilderness it
[48:28] was for the promised land right and it's
[48:30] this message that we have received is
[48:31] not for just being sanctified being in a
[48:34] wilderness and fussing and fighting and
[48:36] church splits and doctrine that's
[48:37] abstract. No, it's got to come into the
[48:39] promised land where you when you receive
[48:41] the Holy Ghost that the word becomes
[48:43] applicable to everyday life. Because if
[48:45] it's not applicable to everyday life,
[48:47] it's just theory. And the devil don't
[48:49] mind theory. But when the word comes
[48:50] down into your life and affects your
[48:52] life, that's where he gets upset because
[48:55] he wants he does not want you to have
[48:57] victory in everyday life. But we live in
[48:59] a season now, it's been odd 40 or 2005
[49:02] was that 40 year mark where there's been
[49:03] a dispensational change around the earth
[49:05] where people have actually stepped into
[49:08] the bride has stepped into every divine
[49:10] promise and living in the desert and
[49:12] living in the promised land are two
[49:13] different places, right? One, you're
[49:15] living off the land. You're in your
[49:17] inheritance, right? Which is the
[49:18] promised land. The other you're you're
[49:20] in the desert. Was God in the desert
[49:22] with them? Yes. Is he in the promised
[49:24] land? Yes. But we're not meant to live
[49:26] in the desert no more.
[49:28] Right. So, so the word cannot just be an
[49:30] abstract idea. It's got to be tangible,
[49:32] real, the the the the yeah the abstract
[49:36] must become reality.
[49:38] Right. So, this is where I want to speak
[49:41] about these things. Okay. So, he said
[49:43] that we would whereby is given unto us
[49:44] exceeding great and precious promises
[49:46] that by these you might be partakers of
[49:48] the divine nature. Right? So we don't
[49:51] just we don't just uh talk about the
[49:54] Lord or or understand the doctrine but
[49:57] we know him and we see it living in our
[49:59] lives. Okay. So now
[50:03] where are we up to here? So because this
[50:05] is the greatest thing, right? This is
[50:07] what the seventh seal is all about for
[50:09] the Gentiles. It is that Christ in you
[50:12] the hope of glory. The mystery he says
[50:15] he says the riches of the glory. This
[50:17] mystery among the Gentiles which is
[50:18] Christ in you the hope of glory. This is
[50:20] the seventh seal for us because because
[50:24] there's three phases of it. We know God
[50:26] would have pre-minence in Christ. Then
[50:28] Christ would have preminence in his
[50:29] bride that he would live through the
[50:30] bride to restore Eden again, right?
[50:33] That's the seventh seal in a nutshell.
[50:35] But it's got to be lived out, right?
[50:36] We're not here just to talk about it.
[50:38] We're here to live it or let it live
[50:39] through us because it is Christ coming
[50:41] down and living through us, right? So,
[50:46] so we live in a day where he has prayer
[50:49] minutes in a people, but what does that
[50:51] mean? You know, you could say, well, I'm
[50:54] a believer. What does that mean? I
[50:56] follow the message. I'm just throwing
[50:57] out. What does that mean? Because it can
[51:00] mean a lot of things to different
[51:01] people. One, it could mean, well, I
[51:03] believe all the doctrine, but there's no
[51:06] life. But I'm in the message. Is that
[51:08] the message? Or is that just agreeing
[51:10] with a mental idea? To me that's just
[51:12] agreeing with a mental idea, right? But
[51:15] when when he comes and lives in you,
[51:18] that's a very different thing, right? So
[51:20] So we
[51:23] I just I'll just read this in here. Oh,
[51:25] if God can get prisoners like that. Now
[51:27] that's when he can express the
[51:28] preeminences. You see, he's got the man
[51:30] or the person so that he knows nothing
[51:33] but Christ. You get what I mean? All
[51:35] right. That's secondly. First is to
[51:36] express himself completely God in
[51:38] Christ. Second is to have pre-minences
[51:40] by this in his church which is his body
[51:43] the bride till he could have the
[51:44] preminences to express himself through
[51:47] them and all right the thirdly is to
[51:49] restore the kingdom to its rightful
[51:51] position that fell by sin by the first
[51:53] Adam get back to where he walked in the
[51:54] cool of the evening with his people
[51:56] talked with them fellowshipped with them
[52:00] amen so
[52:02] when it says here that that that person
[52:05] becomes a prisoner but he knows nothing
[52:07] about Christ That doesn't mean he's
[52:09] ignorant of anything else. Can you drive
[52:11] a car? No, I know. Nothing but Christ.
[52:13] Can you cook a meal? No. Nothing but
[52:15] Christ. That's not what he's talking
[52:16] about. What he's talking about is all he
[52:19] knows is God is more than able. Right?
[52:21] That he's not he doesn't know what his
[52:23] mind is saying. And you know, he doesn't
[52:24] take what his mind says. He doesn't look
[52:26] at by what he sees with his eyes. He
[52:28] knows the word is right. He knows his
[52:31] ABCs is always believe Christ. Right.
[52:33] And he's resting in that. Amen. He knows
[52:36] that God is in control. He's not
[52:38] panicking about what's going on. No, he
[52:41] is resting in that. Amen. But you see
[52:44] now this is, see, this is now when we
[52:47] read about Christ in you, the hope of
[52:49] glory. This is the almighty God in you,
[52:51] the hope of glory, right? Not a second
[52:54] person or a minor God. It is the God of
[52:56] gods, the almighty dwelling in man.
[53:00] Because what has happened essentially is
[53:02] God has changed his dwelling place. I
[53:04] was going to actually put a photo of you
[53:06] guys there,
[53:08] but it might offend some people. Maybe I
[53:10] should have done it because what's good
[53:13] of looking at a painted fire when you
[53:14] don't see the reality of it, right?
[53:16] Because because people have no problem
[53:18] saying almighty God was in, you know,
[53:20] between the cherubims on the mercy seat.
[53:22] Absolutely. But when you say that same
[53:23] God is in you and I,
[53:26] but that's what the gospel does. That's
[53:27] what the blood does. That's what Calvary
[53:29] achieves, right? So God has changed his
[53:32] dwelling place. So now if he's changed
[53:33] his dwelling place, he's going to live
[53:36] life. He's going to live his life out of
[53:39] you and I.
[53:41] Amen. So
[53:44] see it's showing the same nature of the
[53:46] Lord is now behind your skin. Amen. His
[53:50] attitude towards the lost becomes your
[53:53] attitude. So what was his attitude? He
[53:55] didn't look down his nose at people and
[53:57] say, "Look at them and they deserve it."
[53:58] No, he went down to the sinner. Amen. He
[54:01] was approachable. He wasn't a holier
[54:03] than now kind of a guy. Amen. He was a
[54:06] meek and lowly man of Galilee. That was
[54:08] his attitude. He wanted to He wasn't
[54:09] willing that any would perish. That's
[54:11] his attitude. That attitude should
[54:13] become our attitude. Right? I'm not
[54:16] saying it's not, but I just I just want
[54:17] to put these things out there. He wasn't
[54:19] judgmental or condescending. No, he you
[54:21] know, when people people came into his
[54:23] presence, he wasn't arrogant about it to
[54:27] me. He did not he did not say, "Well,
[54:28] you should be thankful you're in my
[54:30] presence and I've only got so much time
[54:31] for you." No, he was he was he was um he
[54:36] was thankful that people would be around
[54:37] him cuz he was remember he was so great
[54:40] he be but he became so low. He became
[54:44] lower than the lowest. So his attitude
[54:46] would have been it's so nice to meet
[54:48] you. How are you doing? Have a genuine
[54:50] care and love. Shouldn't that should
[54:52] that not be our attitude?
[54:55] Right? His attitude
[54:57] towards sin should be our attitude
[54:59] towards sin. He didn't explain it away.
[55:02] It's okay. And he never parttook in what
[55:04] people were doing. But yet he could go
[55:07] where the sinner was, not partake and
[55:09] yet win them.
[55:11] Shouldn't Should that not be our
[55:13] attitude? Amen. His attitude towards the
[55:16] believers should be our attitude towards
[55:18] the believers. Amen. Especially the ones
[55:20] that don't fit in our mold. We all have
[55:23] a mold. We'll have people that we like
[55:25] to gravitate towards. Amen. You know,
[55:28] but we shouldn't be caught up in that
[55:29] mold,
[55:31] right? He and and basically I'll say
[55:34] that same thing but in a different way.
[55:37] He his attitude towards his own body,
[55:39] the bride should be your attitude
[55:41] towards his body. He loves his body.
[55:44] Amen. He loves his body. His attitude
[55:46] towards the word should be our attitude.
[55:49] Amen. Look at this. says, "So ought men
[55:51] to love their wives as their own bodies,
[55:53] even he that loveth his wife loveth
[55:55] himself. For no man ever hated his own
[55:57] flesh, but nourisheth and cherisheth it,
[56:00] even as the Lord the church. For we are
[56:02] members of his body, of his flesh, and
[56:03] of his bones." So he loves him. He the
[56:07] Lord loves his body.
[56:10] If someone says that they, you know, if
[56:13] you really love yourself, you'll love
[56:14] your wife.
[56:16] If you don't love yourself, you don't
[56:18] love your wife because you have no
[56:20] revelation she's part of you. So the
[56:23] Lord loves his body. So should we not
[56:24] love his body, too? Oh, but that person
[56:27] might be a pinky or a little toe or
[56:28] whatever, are they part of the body?
[56:33] Should we not treat them the same way?
[56:35] If if if the Lord Jesus put your life at
[56:38] greater value than his own, should we
[56:40] not view each other the same way? This
[56:42] is part of the redeemed, part of the
[56:44] ages, attributes of God and flesh. I
[56:46] think we should have the utmost love and
[56:48] care and respect and I know you do so is
[56:50] easier to say but you see we should have
[56:52] that attitude towards one another.
[56:57] Amen.
[56:58] Praise the Lord. Now
[57:07] so we should have a see he his attitude
[57:09] towards his word should be our attitude.
[57:12] He believes his word. He doesn't doubt
[57:14] his own word. He knows his word is
[57:16] power, right? We should never question
[57:18] his word. We should always believe
[57:20] Christ. I mean, always believe his word.
[57:23] Not not believe your gut feeling or your
[57:26] feelings. No, we want to believe his
[57:28] word, right? We want to God's attitude
[57:33] towards this scripture is it's true,
[57:36] it's right, and it meets every
[57:38] condition. There's no exemption. There's
[57:40] no sub clause that says this does not
[57:42] certain thing happening to you right now
[57:44] does not work for your good. Everything
[57:46] works for your good.
[57:48] Amen. We can rejoice in every situation.
[57:53] But does that mean you're burying your
[57:54] head in the sand? No sir. We can rejoice
[57:57] because who's in control? Ain't me.
[58:01] Praise the Lord. It's him. So we can
[58:04] rest in that.
[58:06] Amen. But you see now we must have
[58:09] character to rule. Remember if we have
[58:12] his divine nature then we have character
[58:15] to rule. Okay. But character is a
[58:19] victory. It's not a gift. So you don't
[58:22] just get given eternal life is a gift
[58:25] but character is a victory. That means
[58:27] you got to wrestle with something to win
[58:29] to defeat it. And what is that thing?
[58:31] This guy. What this guy wants to do. Who
[58:34] cares what this guy wants to do? This
[58:36] guy wants to be lazy, wants to do
[58:38] nothing. Is that going to help me? Is
[58:41] that going to let mercy live out of me?
[58:44] Is that going to let the seventh seal
[58:45] manifest himself out of me? The mercy of
[58:47] God flowing? No. We want to have
[58:50] victory. We want to have character
[58:53] that's fit to rule. Because power apart
[58:56] from character is satanic. Because if
[58:58] someone has power without character,
[59:00] they'll bring judgment. They'll bring
[59:02] condemnation. They'll pin someone with a
[59:04] religious spirit. They'll drag someone
[59:07] down. They will not bring life. But if
[59:10] you have the right character, then life
[59:12] will come, right? And liberty will come.
[59:17] Amen. He says, "A man without character
[59:19] can't reign because power apart from
[59:21] sorry, power apart from character is
[59:22] satanic, but power with character is fit
[59:25] to rule." Amen. And what are we ordained
[59:27] to do? We will rule in the millennium.
[59:30] We are ordained to sit on the
[59:31] overcomer's throne. Right? That's your
[59:33] ending up position. So you need
[59:35] character now to have character there,
[59:38] right? And what character does he want
[59:39] you to have? His character. So his
[59:41] attitude, how he operated, you should be
[59:43] operating too, right? You know, this is
[59:47] exactly how we should be. It should, you
[59:48] know, like the apostle Paul would say,
[59:49] it's no longer I that liveth, but Christ
[59:51] that liveth in me. That's more than a
[59:54] nice thing to put on your Instagram with
[59:56] a nice sunset behind it and all these
[59:57] things. No, it's got to be a reality.
[1:00:00] It's not me. It's not my nature. It's
[1:00:02] now God living through me. You like
[1:00:04] brother Bram. He was a hightempered
[1:00:05] Irishman, part Irish. You know, some
[1:00:07] boys beat him up. This is before he
[1:00:09] became a believer. And he went and got
[1:00:11] his gun. He wanted to shoot them. But
[1:00:13] his gun wouldn't go off. God would would
[1:00:15] not let him become a mass murderer.
[1:00:17] Amen. And and then the guy who killed
[1:00:19] his dog, he wanted to go deal with him
[1:00:20] too. Shoot him as well. But I think his
[1:00:22] father stopped him. But when he met the
[1:00:24] Lord, he led that same man to Christ.
[1:00:27] Why? So it was a See, why? Because
[1:00:29] because in him was not mercy within man.
[1:00:31] That's why it's always eye for an eye,
[1:00:33] tooth for a tooth is a natural law.
[1:00:34] Doesn't matter if you go around the
[1:00:35] world, there's always I'm going to get
[1:00:37] revenge. What is there here in New
[1:00:38] Zealand? UTU whatever you all these
[1:00:40] things and over in Africa there's
[1:00:41] different things in Europe definitely.
[1:00:44] History is full of feuds and the
[1:00:46] hundred-year war, you know, between
[1:00:47] France and England. Do they even know
[1:00:48] what they're fighting about? That's
[1:00:50] right. Well, they killed me and I, you
[1:00:51] know, their four bears killed my four
[1:00:53] bears, so I'm going to kill them and
[1:00:54] all. I'm going to get revenge and all
[1:00:55] these things. That is not mercy.
[1:00:58] Someone has to break the cycle. Someone
[1:01:01] has to let go of the past and grudges
[1:01:03] and hurts and pains. Someone has to get
[1:01:05] victory over it. Why not you and I?
[1:01:08] We're ordained to do it. You say, "Well,
[1:01:10] you know, my past and my forbears and
[1:01:12] all these things." No, we are ordained
[1:01:15] to live above those things. Those things
[1:01:17] are not our inheritance. It's not being
[1:01:18] like Christ. If the blood is applied,
[1:01:20] mercy will come out. Okay? So, don't let
[1:01:23] your bad skin rule you with your past
[1:01:25] and memories and all these things. I
[1:01:26] don't care what's defined your history,
[1:01:28] your your your family history. I don't
[1:01:30] care. That's irrelevant. Let it go. It's
[1:01:33] not worth holding on to. I've got to
[1:01:35] uphold the family name. We're called by
[1:01:37] a higher family name. We're called by
[1:01:39] the name of Jesus Christ. Why don't we
[1:01:41] uphold his family name, which is our
[1:01:43] family name. Amen. So now we want to, he
[1:01:48] says, so we must so victory. Remember
[1:01:51] character is a victory. And that's why
[1:01:53] you got to realize, you know, we sing
[1:01:55] that song, I'm fighting uh he's I'm
[1:01:57] fighting a battle he's already won.
[1:01:58] Right? I like to sing it, I know what
[1:02:01] you're doing because I know what you've
[1:02:02] done. We don't We're not walking blindly
[1:02:05] in this world. We know what he's doing
[1:02:07] cuz we know what he's done. What do he
[1:02:08] do? He's redeemed us back to himself by
[1:02:11] his own blood to produce himself in a
[1:02:14] people. That's what he wants. He's going
[1:02:16] to come for a people who have his
[1:02:18] nature, his character. She is him,
[1:02:21] right? That's what he's looking for. His
[1:02:23] word in flesh. That's what he's going to
[1:02:24] rapture. This Bible will stay here when
[1:02:27] the translation happens. Every message
[1:02:29] book under the sun, every Bible under
[1:02:31] the sun will stay upon the earth. But
[1:02:32] those that that word has become flesh
[1:02:34] in, God is taking with him. Right? So
[1:02:37] now, so I sing it. I know what you're
[1:02:39] doing because I know what you've done
[1:02:41] because he is molding me. So when we go
[1:02:43] through a trial, you're going to
[1:02:44] realize, Lord, you're given this that I
[1:02:46] will meet give get your character. Amen.
[1:02:50] because it's going to be character as a
[1:02:52] victory. That's why there's a struggle,
[1:02:55] right? Even the shortest war in history
[1:02:57] was a victory cuz they won. I think the
[1:03:00] shortest war was a few hours, but they
[1:03:02] still fired bullets. They still fought a
[1:03:03] battle, right? But it was a victory cuz
[1:03:05] it wasn't just handed to them. No, they
[1:03:07] had to fight. It's the same thing with
[1:03:08] you and I. We got to deny ourselves,
[1:03:10] pick up our cross, and follow him.
[1:03:12] Right? We cannot lift up. We cannot feel
[1:03:14] justified. You know, self-entitlement is
[1:03:16] such a strong thing in this day. It's
[1:03:18] not fair. And this is not fair and being
[1:03:20] entitled. That's a Ladyian thing. What
[1:03:23] are we entitled to? One thing we're
[1:03:25] entitled to is actually to be lost in
[1:03:27] hell because of our first birth. That's
[1:03:29] the one thing we're entitled to really
[1:03:31] naturally. But God rich in mercy has
[1:03:34] come down that we actually he took that
[1:03:36] what we were entitled to because of our
[1:03:38] first birth became a sinner for us went
[1:03:40] to hell on our behalf that we don't need
[1:03:42] to go that we could go to heaven. Right?
[1:03:45] So it's not life, you know, life is not
[1:03:47] fair.
[1:03:49] It's not fair. But we don't walk by
[1:03:51] fairness.
[1:03:54] We need to maybe I just I'm just going
[1:03:56] to preach to myself. Okay. Who cares
[1:03:57] about fairness?
[1:03:59] What is the relativeness of fairness? If
[1:04:02] you compare yourself to Elon Musk or the
[1:04:04] rich super rich of the world, life's not
[1:04:06] fair. Who are you comparing yourself to?
[1:04:09] Don't don't worry about the life is not
[1:04:11] fair. My family, this family. Every
[1:04:13] single one of our parents was ordained
[1:04:15] by God. Our upbringing, everything that
[1:04:17] happened to us, their complexes, their
[1:04:20] problems, things you went through in
[1:04:21] life was ordained because God wanted to
[1:04:24] bring out a certain expression of
[1:04:25] himself out of that in you. That's
[1:04:28] right. So, we can't say, "Well, I should
[1:04:29] have had these and why didn't I have
[1:04:30] this and if we had this?" No, don't
[1:04:32] worry about that.
[1:04:34] God has put you upon the earth for a
[1:04:36] purpose that you will get divine nature,
[1:04:40] right? So, let's just let's just settle
[1:04:41] all those things. Don't worry about
[1:04:43] where you came from and don't wrestle
[1:04:45] with it. God allowed it. Okay? And he
[1:04:48] didn't allow it because he was mean at
[1:04:50] you or was mad or angry or resentful.
[1:04:53] It's nothing to do with it. We all come
[1:04:55] from many different places, many
[1:04:56] different backgrounds, good, bad, ugly,
[1:04:58] whatever more. I'm not diminishing those
[1:05:00] things, right? But we got to lay it to
[1:05:02] rest. God, you brought me to the earth
[1:05:04] in a certain family for a certain
[1:05:06] reason, and you know what you're doing,
[1:05:08] and I'm so thankful I'm here. Thank you
[1:05:11] found me, Lord. I'm so glad I'm part of
[1:05:13] you. I want to walk with you now.
[1:05:16] Okay. So, character is a victory.
[1:05:17] There's a battle. That's why there's a
[1:05:19] always a struggle. The struggle is good.
[1:05:21] It's a good war. We know we're going to
[1:05:24] win, but it's a good war. Okay. So, just
[1:05:26] just keep walking on with the Lord. And
[1:05:29] and since he wants to share um he wants
[1:05:32] us to share even his throne on the same
[1:05:33] basis that he overcame and sit down on
[1:05:36] his father's throne, then we have to
[1:05:37] overcome to sit with him. And the little
[1:05:39] temporary sufferings we go through now
[1:05:41] is not worthy to be compared to the
[1:05:43] tremendous glory that will be revealed
[1:05:45] in us when he comes. Oh, what treasures
[1:05:47] are laid up for those who are willing to
[1:05:49] enter into his kingdom through much
[1:05:51] tribulation.
[1:05:53] I'm willing. It's worth it. It's worth
[1:05:57] it. Tell you what, when we all do a big
[1:05:59] dance around the throne together,
[1:06:02] I'll say it was worth every sweat,
[1:06:04] blood, sweat, tear, crying, pain, what?
[1:06:06] Heartache, sorrow, question. It'll be
[1:06:08] worth it all when we see Jesus. It'll be
[1:06:11] it'll be one look of his hallowed face
[1:06:13] will more than repay. Not that we need
[1:06:15] pain or, you know, payment, whatever. I
[1:06:17] don't care about crowns or robes. I want
[1:06:19] to see him. That's all I'm interested
[1:06:20] in. I don't care about rewards. I really
[1:06:22] don't care. I want to see him. That'll
[1:06:24] satisfy me for eternity. and then some.
[1:06:29] Now, if we are a place where God's mercy
[1:06:31] can live out, we got to realize that we
[1:06:33] have a great a great uh responsibility
[1:06:38] because the Bible says that we've been
[1:06:39] made kings and priests to our God. Now,
[1:06:42] a king has dominion, but a priest
[1:06:43] intercedes. So, if you've got the right
[1:06:45] character, you can intercede on the
[1:06:47] behalf of people, right? If you've got a
[1:06:49] satanic character, no, I shouldn't say
[1:06:50] it like that. I say if you have a carnal
[1:06:52] character, then you won't intercede, but
[1:06:54] you'll hold a grudge. Right. So, we
[1:06:57] don't want Remember, we're having
[1:06:57] communion Wednesday night, too, by the
[1:06:59] way. News flat. Sorry. Okay. So, so here
[1:07:03] we are in uh Numbers where Moses, so
[1:07:05] this is where a plague is struck out
[1:07:07] because of the grumblings of the people.
[1:07:10] Where people are, there's grumblings.
[1:07:12] There's trouble. You go live under a
[1:07:14] rock, you'll find problems cuz you're
[1:07:16] there. Cuz you're a person. Okay? I
[1:07:19] mean, if I go live under a rock, I'll
[1:07:21] find problems cuz I'm there. Let's be
[1:07:22] honest, you know? Because where people
[1:07:24] are, there's problems. That's okay.
[1:07:25] We're human, right? God's developing us
[1:07:29] through those problems, right? But now,
[1:07:32] you see, as Moses was told um told
[1:07:34] Aaron, "Take a sensor and put fire
[1:07:36] therein from off the altar and put on
[1:07:38] incense and go quickly unto the
[1:07:40] congregation and make an atonement for
[1:07:42] them, for there is wrath gone out from
[1:07:44] the Lord. The plague has begun." And
[1:07:46] Aaron took uh took as Moses commanded
[1:07:48] and ran into the midst of the
[1:07:49] congregation. And behold, the plague was
[1:07:51] begun among the people, and he put on
[1:07:53] the incense and made an atonement for
[1:07:54] the people, and he stood between the
[1:07:56] dead and the living, and the plague was
[1:07:57] stayed. Now, incense in the Bible always
[1:08:00] speaks of prayer.
[1:08:02] So notice now, Aaron never ran out or
[1:08:04] Moses never said to Aaron, Aaron, go
[1:08:07] explain to the people why this has
[1:08:08] happened and are they sorry first, then
[1:08:10] you can intercede. No, he ran out there.
[1:08:14] He he stood in the breach between the
[1:08:16] living and the dead that that plague
[1:08:17] would be stopped. Why? because he had
[1:08:19] divine character. He did not say to
[1:08:22] Moses, "Moses, I'll do it later cuz I
[1:08:23] don't feel like it now cuz I'm annoyed
[1:08:25] at the people." No, he stood in the gap,
[1:08:27] interceded cuz he had the right
[1:08:29] character. He had divine nature. Now,
[1:08:31] how about you and I when trouble,
[1:08:34] sickness, or no, not sickness, but you
[1:08:36] know, things come up in church or in
[1:08:38] family, among families. How do we
[1:08:40] operate? Do we operate with mercy? Do we
[1:08:44] intercede for that person? Do you slip
[1:08:45] away and pray? Or do you have a big kind
[1:08:48] of court session in your mind about why,
[1:08:50] how, and all the variables and then the
[1:08:52] sentence that's got to be passed?
[1:08:55] What do you do? I trust it's the first
[1:08:57] thing, not the latter thing. Courtrooms
[1:08:58] are boring. No one likes to be there. So
[1:09:00] why make your mind one? Okay, but you
[1:09:03] know what do we do? You know, I trust
[1:09:04] that you know if someone even a
[1:09:06] friendly, oh, they didn't shake my hand
[1:09:08] last Sunday, the previous Sunday, the
[1:09:09] Sunday before, they don't shake my hand.
[1:09:11] I don't. No, I'm just going to avoid
[1:09:14] that person. Do we really let those
[1:09:16] things bother us?
[1:09:18] Should we let it bother us? The devil
[1:09:19] wants it to bother us, but why can't we
[1:09:22] just say, "Hey, man, I'm just happy to
[1:09:23] see them. If they shake my If you never
[1:09:25] shake my hand again, I really don't
[1:09:27] mind. I like shaking hands." Okay, so
[1:09:30] you know, it's not like I'm trying to
[1:09:31] live like an isolation thing, but you
[1:09:32] know, it doesn't bother me. We shouldn't
[1:09:35] be so worried about how people treat us
[1:09:38] in that way. Just love everybody. If
[1:09:40] there's mercy coming out, love covers a
[1:09:42] multitude. and not shaking hands is not
[1:09:44] a sin. But no, love covers a multitude
[1:09:46] of sins,
[1:09:49] right? So why why should we worry about
[1:09:51] these things? I think let's just move
[1:09:54] on.
[1:09:57] So we have the power to intercede
[1:10:00] now. We want to be like Jesus.
[1:10:03] Okay, I want to be like Jesus. Okay, I
[1:10:05] trust you guys want to as well. Okay,
[1:10:07] but you see now I like this photo
[1:10:08] because you look at, you know, sometimes
[1:10:10] there's pictures of the cross and it's
[1:10:11] way up there somewhere. But maybe it was
[1:10:13] just about this high. And you know,
[1:10:15] here's the Lord and he's, you know, he's
[1:10:17] being mocked. You know, here's these
[1:10:18] guys. You know, there's, you know, one
[1:10:19] pointing his finger and those two right
[1:10:21] up in his face. He's suffering and he's
[1:10:23] pulling himself up just trying to
[1:10:24] breathe. And, you know, because of the
[1:10:26] because crucifixion, how it works is
[1:10:28] basically you uh suffocate because you
[1:10:30] because there's so so there's holes, you
[1:10:33] know, the nails in your hands. You can't
[1:10:34] really pull yourself up with your hands.
[1:10:36] And then there's nails in the feet that
[1:10:38] you can't support yourself with the
[1:10:39] feet. and the feet are on a a angle and
[1:10:42] so basically you try and lift yourself
[1:10:44] up like this to try and catch a breath.
[1:10:46] But then eventually you have no more
[1:10:47] strength and you just you basically
[1:10:49] suffocate. So here they are right in his
[1:10:51] face. He's just trying to you know
[1:10:54] breathe and survive or you know however
[1:10:56] long. But there they are. And then
[1:10:57] finally see see these guys that are
[1:10:59] making fun. They do not have the blood
[1:11:01] applied. That's for sure. They have no
[1:11:03] mercy in them. They're making fun cuz
[1:11:05] they cuz they think finally I can tell
[1:11:06] them what I think of him. begin to mock
[1:11:09] him and ridicule him, maybe spit in his
[1:11:10] face as he's hanging on Calvary. You
[1:11:12] know, this was the third pull of Jesus'
[1:11:14] ministry was now set into set into
[1:11:16] being. There was the miracles, there was
[1:11:18] the discernment, there was the prophecy.
[1:11:20] But now the full intent of his ministry
[1:11:22] was upon the earth where for this cause
[1:11:24] I've come into the world. What? To be
[1:11:26] the lamb of God that takes away the sin
[1:11:27] of the world. So now he has entered into
[1:11:29] the third pull of his ministry. What is
[1:11:31] he going to do in this third pull?
[1:11:33] There's going to be forgiveness given.
[1:11:35] There's going to be intercession made,
[1:11:37] right? It's not going to be judged
[1:11:39] because he is the mercy seat, right? We
[1:11:41] know that the mercy seat is not a piece
[1:11:42] of furniture in heaven. It's a person.
[1:11:45] Christ is mercy, right? He's the
[1:11:47] fountain of all mercy. He is the mercy
[1:11:49] seat. Okay? But you see, so there he is
[1:11:52] struggling to breathe and all these
[1:11:53] things and they're mocking him, making
[1:11:55] fun of him. Now, if he did not have the
[1:11:58] right character,
[1:12:01] he would never have said this.
[1:12:04] Father, forgive them for they don't they
[1:12:06] do not know what they do. There's
[1:12:08] nowhere in the scripture where he says,
[1:12:09] "Hold on, everyone.
[1:12:12] Don't you know you have broken my heart?
[1:12:14] Don't you know you've hurt me?" Cuz he
[1:12:16] died of a broken heart, right? The blood
[1:12:17] and water separated in his body. That's
[1:12:19] a broken heart. He died of a broken
[1:12:21] heart because of rejection. He did not
[1:12:23] say, "Now I need to explain to you what
[1:12:26] you've done to me and then I'll think
[1:12:27] about whether I'll forgive you or not."
[1:12:28] Forgiveness is not based on what the
[1:12:30] other party has done. It's not based on
[1:12:33] whether they've apologized or you've
[1:12:35] talked about it. No, forgiveness comes
[1:12:37] first. We should not hold for a picos
[1:12:39] second any unforgiveness in our hearts.
[1:12:42] That's the smallest measurement of time.
[1:12:43] By the way, we had a science lesson.
[1:12:45] There you go. But you see, we should not
[1:12:47] hold anything in our hearts against
[1:12:48] anyone for any amount of time. It is not
[1:12:51] Christian. It is not godly at all. Those
[1:12:53] things should be let go of. You say,
[1:12:55] "Well, I still feel pain by it." But
[1:13:00] what's your attitude towards that
[1:13:01] person? If your attitude is Lord, you
[1:13:03] want to see them there on the other side
[1:13:05] above everything, then you've truly
[1:13:06] forgiven. You say, "Well, I feel pain."
[1:13:08] Well, it's like a wound, right? You get
[1:13:10] cut, you get stitches or whatever more.
[1:13:12] You know, that wound has now been been
[1:13:14] treated. It's now been whatever cleaned
[1:13:17] out, whatever it is. But it takes time
[1:13:18] for it to heal. That's right. But just
[1:13:20] because you may feel pain towards the
[1:13:22] person doesn't mean you haven't
[1:13:23] forgiven. You have because your attitude
[1:13:25] towards that person is, "Lord, I want to
[1:13:26] see them there. I feel sorry for them.
[1:13:28] Lord, forgive them. They don't know what
[1:13:30] they do. It's not out of your head. It's
[1:13:32] out of your heart. Right? But then now
[1:13:33] there's a healing process can start to
[1:13:35] take place. So don't beat yourself up
[1:13:37] because you maybe feel hurt. But what's
[1:13:40] your attitude towards the person? Does
[1:13:41] anyone follow me about that? Right? But
[1:13:44] you see this was his expression. He was
[1:13:46] he was the third pull of his ministry.
[1:13:48] What was he doing? Interceding
[1:13:50] for those people in his face making fun.
[1:13:53] Father, forgive them. They don't know
[1:13:54] what they do. And we know where are the
[1:13:56] worst wounds come in the house of your
[1:13:58] friends among family that you love where
[1:14:00] your heart has been open to them. That's
[1:14:02] where we can get hurt the easiest and
[1:14:04] the most. But they all work together for
[1:14:06] our good. Right? So this was the third
[1:14:09] pull of his ministry. And that's why you
[1:14:11] know because he what he died on Calvary
[1:14:13] he went down and preached to the souls
[1:14:14] in prison. What is that now? That's all.
[1:14:16] And this is the third pull ministry of
[1:14:18] the bride where we don't just talk about
[1:14:21] forgiveness. We live it. where the
[1:14:23] divine nature of Christ is within us
[1:14:25] that it's not judgment comes out and you
[1:14:27] want to see people in trouble and you
[1:14:29] think well they deserve that when
[1:14:30] trouble comes into their lives no you
[1:14:32] intercede for that person where you
[1:14:34] don't have any ill feelings towards
[1:14:36] anybody you it can be the worst see when
[1:14:38] he said father forgive them they don't
[1:14:40] know what they do he wasn't thinking
[1:14:41] about the disciples he loved
[1:14:44] he was thinking about these guys
[1:14:46] you know so what about you and I now if
[1:14:49] we're to be like the Lord this should be
[1:14:51] our attitude because his attitude
[1:14:53] becomes our attitude.
[1:14:58] And and then even, you know, he would
[1:15:00] say this here,
[1:15:02] if I can find this here, he would say
[1:15:04] this in Matthew. This is before, you
[1:15:06] know, this is this is in the garden when
[1:15:08] Peter's trying to stop the word being
[1:15:09] fulfilled. He says, "Thinkstest thou
[1:15:11] that I cannot now pray to my father, and
[1:15:13] shall he not presently give me more than
[1:15:15] 12 legions of angels? But how then shall
[1:15:18] the scripture be fulfilled that thus it
[1:15:20] must be? So he knew the power that he
[1:15:24] had. He knew what he what was at his
[1:15:26] fingertips. One of those angels could
[1:15:28] have killed them all. Right? One of
[1:15:29] those angels could have changed the
[1:15:31] whole scene. Could have leveled the
[1:15:32] temple and done away with the high
[1:15:33] priest and all the all of his enemies.
[1:15:35] He knew what the power at his disposal.
[1:15:38] But he knew the word had to be
[1:15:40] fulfilled. And you see what is the
[1:15:41] fulfilling of the word in our lives is
[1:15:43] that there's a people upon the earth
[1:15:44] that can actually let go. They can
[1:15:47] forgive. Because if we got the nature of
[1:15:49] Christ, then his nature will live out of
[1:15:50] us. And we can let go. We can actually
[1:15:54] forgive. Right? It's not, well, I've
[1:15:56] been taught to, therefore, I say it, but
[1:15:57] I still hold it. No, you let go of it.
[1:16:00] Right? You actually, and you don't have
[1:16:01] to see that character is not ask, well,
[1:16:04] they have to apologize first. That's
[1:16:05] irrelevant. If they never come say sorry
[1:16:08] to you, if they never come and say,
[1:16:09] "Well, that was wrong. I was wrong.
[1:16:11] Please forgive me." If they never say
[1:16:13] that to you in their lives,
[1:16:15] that doesn't mean that you should not
[1:16:17] forgive.
[1:16:19] In reality, you should have forgiven
[1:16:20] before you saw the person the next time.
[1:16:23] We not meant to hold on to those things.
[1:16:27] Why? Because unforgiveness breeds
[1:16:28] resentment, brings a root of bitterness.
[1:16:30] And who does it affect? Not them. You a
[1:16:34] root of bitterness, you know, affects
[1:16:35] you. the person who's carrying it. We're
[1:16:37] not meant to be have a root of
[1:16:38] bitterness in our lives. We're meant to
[1:16:40] be the tree of life living out. Amen.
[1:16:43] Where there's mercy, where there's
[1:16:44] forgiveness, where there's salvation can
[1:16:46] flow, God can reach through our lives
[1:16:48] and get a hold of people.
[1:16:51] Amen. He says, you know, when someone
[1:16:53] says something evil about you and you
[1:16:55] want to take it up and get angry about
[1:16:56] it, that shows you haven't got quite
[1:16:58] deep enough yet with God. Big men don't
[1:17:00] do those things. That's what made him
[1:17:02] God to me. He was big. He didn't have to
[1:17:05] notice their little scoffing. He had a
[1:17:06] purpose. He had a work to do. And that
[1:17:08] was to fulfill what God had sent him to
[1:17:10] do. And he was determined to do it. He
[1:17:12] didn't care what anyone said,
[1:17:15] right? Yeah. We shouldn't worry about
[1:17:18] those things. Let's just walk on. We
[1:17:21] have a purpose. God want God wants to
[1:17:24] display his redeeming grace to the world
[1:17:26] through his bride.
[1:17:30] Amen. It says here about the so so this
[1:17:32] is the scripture brother Braram preaches
[1:17:34] when he talks about perfect faith. He
[1:17:36] says verily I say unto you or you know
[1:17:38] speaks about the power of the spoken
[1:17:39] word. He says uh that whatsoever ye
[1:17:41] shall say unto this mountain be thou
[1:17:42] removed and be thou cast into the sea
[1:17:44] and shall not doubt in his heart but
[1:17:46] shall believe that those things which he
[1:17:49] saith shall come to pass. He shall have
[1:17:51] whatsoever he saith. Therefore I say
[1:17:53] unto you, whatsoever things you desire
[1:17:54] when you pray, believe you receive them,
[1:17:56] and you shall have them. And when you
[1:17:59] stand praying, forgive. See, so so he
[1:18:02] takes he takes the power of the spoken
[1:18:04] word, right, and forgiveness and puts
[1:18:07] them one in the same thing, right? So if
[1:18:09] you want life and death, we know is in
[1:18:12] the power of the tongue. If you want
[1:18:13] life to be spoken in its full magnitude,
[1:18:15] forgive. Right? If you want the creative
[1:18:18] power of God to take a hold of your
[1:18:20] vocal cords and speak, forgive.
[1:18:24] Amen. If you have ought against any that
[1:18:26] your father also which is in heaven may
[1:18:29] forgive you your trespasses.
[1:18:32] So you don't go and say to people you've
[1:18:34] got um I've got ought against you. You
[1:18:36] forgive them.
[1:18:37] Just let it go. But if you do not
[1:18:40] forgive, neither will your father which
[1:18:41] is in heaven forgive your trespasses. I
[1:18:43] want to be forgiven. I don't want no
[1:18:45] disappointment that day. Amen. You know
[1:18:48] because I'm holding on to some
[1:18:49] ridiculous thing upon the earth. I don't
[1:18:52] want no trouble at the river. Amen.
[1:18:54] Right. Why hold on to it? Let it go.
[1:18:58] Amen. Cuz blessed are the merciful, for
[1:19:00] they shall obtain mercy. So we're having
[1:19:02] kind of a bit of a devotional this this
[1:19:03] morning. Is that okay? We're kind of
[1:19:05] just journeying through this. We're
[1:19:06] going to be finished quite soon. Amen.
[1:19:08] So So if you're merciful, you shall
[1:19:10] obtain mercy. Who wants mercy? Me. You
[1:19:12] guys want mercy, right? Well, be
[1:19:13] merciful. Let mercy flow out of your
[1:19:16] life. If you're holding grudges or
[1:19:18] anything against anyone, you're not you
[1:19:20] you can't be merciful. You say, "Well,
[1:19:22] you don't know what they've done done to
[1:19:24] me." I'm not diminishing what anyone has
[1:19:26] done to anyone, but you know what they
[1:19:28] did to him. And yet, he freely forgave
[1:19:32] because he knew they did not know what
[1:19:34] they're truly doing. And I think that
[1:19:36] it's exactly the same thing with when
[1:19:38] people hurt us or misunderstandings rise
[1:19:40] or anything, they people because of
[1:19:42] humanity, we really don't realize what
[1:19:44] we're doing when those things happen.
[1:19:47] So, we got to look beyond the flesh and
[1:19:49] forgive.
[1:19:51] You know, Brother Bram says this here.
[1:19:53] If you want to be a blessing and get a
[1:19:55] blessing. Yep. Anyone?
[1:19:58] When a man has done you wrong, and he
[1:20:00] absolutely justly, I mean, he has done
[1:20:02] you wrong and you know that he's done
[1:20:04] you wrong, he's done you evil, don't
[1:20:05] mention that. You take him to prayer
[1:20:07] before God. So, don't even mention it.
[1:20:10] Take him before prayer before God. And
[1:20:11] don't take it in a way of just a selfish
[1:20:13] and say, "Well, I'm supposed to do
[1:20:14] this." But stand with your shoulder to
[1:20:17] his shoulder and stand the prince of God
[1:20:18] our father. Away prayer should be made
[1:20:20] the prince of God. Say father here's my
[1:20:22] brother and he is justly. He deserves
[1:20:24] punishment because he's done me evil. I
[1:20:26] and I don't see why he did it. Then let
[1:20:29] God go to talking to you. You say,
[1:20:31] "Well, do I have to get into a state of
[1:20:33] prayer where God comes down that I'm in
[1:20:34] the presence of God. I can see things
[1:20:36] clearly." Where is the presence of God?
[1:20:38] Is it not in here? Is he not in your
[1:20:40] soul? Then you're always in the presence
[1:20:42] of God. Right? So because why? because
[1:20:44] the blood has been applied. So now you
[1:20:46] can look at people and say well you know
[1:20:48] then then you can lift them before the
[1:20:49] throne here
[1:20:51] and and you'll see maybe uh uh sorry and
[1:20:55] then let God go to talking to you and
[1:20:57] you'll see maybe what that man's been
[1:20:59] through. The devil has twisted him up
[1:21:01] somewhere and caused him to do that
[1:21:03] though he's absolutely wrong before you
[1:21:05] leave the throne of God. You'll be
[1:21:06] feeling sorry for that man. Amen. You'll
[1:21:09] be sympathizing with that brother and
[1:21:10] when you get back down there earth
[1:21:12] again, you'll go over to that brother
[1:21:14] and shake his hand cuz you know what
[1:21:15] he's been through. You can't stand with
[1:21:17] a mortal in the presence of God and
[1:21:19] condemn anybody.
[1:21:22] Amen. He doesn't say you go over to that
[1:21:23] brother and tell them what they've done.
[1:21:25] No, you go shake his hand. You'll show
[1:21:26] him some love and care.
[1:21:28] Amen. I don't believe. No, sir. Even if
[1:21:30] he's a ranked sinner. And what about a
[1:21:31] brother that's made a mistake? Though I
[1:21:34] say he's wrong, sometimes he's accused
[1:21:35] wrong when he's not wrong. But if he is
[1:21:37] wrong, well, if he if we will take him
[1:21:39] to the throne of God, stand there
[1:21:41] shoulderto-shoulder with our brother,
[1:21:42] know that he's immortal, and maybe his
[1:21:44] destination rests upon our attitude
[1:21:46] towards him. You know, the power you
[1:21:49] hold. Life and death is in the power of
[1:21:50] your tongue. Your attitude could could
[1:21:55] you think about that?
[1:21:57] Maybe I should just had that on the
[1:21:58] screen by itself. Our attitude towards
[1:22:01] anyone can determine their eternal
[1:22:02] destination. So attitude should be, I
[1:22:05] love that person. They're on their
[1:22:07] journey. They're flesh and blood like
[1:22:09] you and me. Jesus died for them like he
[1:22:12] died for us. Amen. We all It's all the
[1:22:14] grace of God. You know, even if they
[1:22:17] never see what you see or believe what
[1:22:18] you believe. Just encourage them along
[1:22:20] the way anyway. Be nice to everyone.
[1:22:23] Don't be Mr. Grumpy Pants. Be friendly.
[1:22:25] Be known as a friendly nice person.
[1:22:29] Amen.
[1:22:31] And when we come back to the throne of
[1:22:33] God, we realize that we're everyone
[1:22:35] guilty and we all need help one from
[1:22:36] another. And the best way to do is pray.
[1:22:38] We all need help one from another,
[1:22:40] right? We all need mercy to flow one to
[1:22:42] another, right? And all we need is help.
[1:22:45] Um now these great principles, the great
[1:22:47] church of the living God. He says it
[1:22:49] wouldn't have to say, well, we're all
[1:22:50] belong to this organization or that one.
[1:22:53] If we would unite in heart, one accord,
[1:22:55] there'll be a revival strike this world
[1:22:56] like there's never been. If the people
[1:22:58] who has the Pentecostal experience would
[1:23:00] just unite in heart together, let the
[1:23:01] denominations run any way they want to,
[1:23:04] what difference does these little
[1:23:05] frictions and so forth. I mean, it's
[1:23:08] just the devil trying to keep the great
[1:23:09] church in a turmoil all the time. So,
[1:23:13] frictions that rise up. It's the devil
[1:23:15] trying to keep us in turmoil all the
[1:23:17] time to try and stop what God really
[1:23:19] wants to do. I say, let's let the
[1:23:22] friction go. You have any order against
[1:23:24] anyone, just let it go. put it under the
[1:23:27] blood. Some people like friction and
[1:23:29] drama. I don't do that kind of thing.
[1:23:32] I'm like not a drama person. I don't
[1:23:34] need some stress and some tension and
[1:23:36] some big thing blowing up and the
[1:23:38] fallout and all these things. I'm not
[1:23:40] really interested in that kind of stuff.
[1:23:42] And I believe someone who truly has the
[1:23:43] prince of peace on their throne does not
[1:23:45] like drama. Doesn't need some cause to
[1:23:48] fight against and someone to be an enemy
[1:23:50] and all these things. No, we like peace,
[1:23:51] don't we? Amen. So, so why why let
[1:23:55] friction be ramped up into something so
[1:23:57] big, some kind of, you know, event that
[1:23:59] escalates into World War II? Let's just
[1:24:01] let it go because it's just the devil
[1:24:04] trying to keep us in turmoil. We don't
[1:24:06] need to be in turmoil. You realize if
[1:24:08] there's trouble going on, it's the enemy
[1:24:10] trying to do it or is doing it. You got
[1:24:12] to withstand him.
[1:24:14] After all, in Acts 10:35, it's written
[1:24:16] that God had no respect of persons or
[1:24:18] nations. He has honor of those who serve
[1:24:20] God do righteous. You see, uh, we know
[1:24:23] that's true.
[1:24:26] So, I just want to maybe we just have
[1:24:28] the musicians this morning if you want
[1:24:29] to come. I just want to sum sum this up
[1:24:33] and ask you a question. What is coming
[1:24:35] out of your heart?
[1:24:37] Is it judgment? Is it wanting to hold
[1:24:40] things over people to try and make them
[1:24:41] bow down or you feel superior or, you
[1:24:44] know, being judgmental? gossip at all
[1:24:46] these kind of things, condescending
[1:24:48] looks and attitudes.
[1:24:50] Or is it love, mercy, and grace
[1:24:54] that you care for one another? Doesn't
[1:24:56] matter what the person's done to you,
[1:24:57] you love them anyhow. You've forgiven
[1:25:00] them. Sure, you may feel hurt, but you
[1:25:02] want to see them on the other side. You
[1:25:04] don't hold it against them, and God is
[1:25:05] bringing healing into your life. What
[1:25:08] side do you want? Do you want to be like
[1:25:10] Jesus? Divine character, right? that
[1:25:13] even even in front of your greatest
[1:25:15] enemies,
[1:25:17] you can say, "Father, forgive them. They
[1:25:19] don't know what they do.
[1:25:21] I want to be like him." I want there
[1:25:24] more than anything to be the blood
[1:25:26] applied that mercy can flow.
[1:25:30] Amen. So, I trust we all feel that way
[1:25:33] this morning. Let's let it all go.
[1:25:37] Amen. Let's stand, shall we? Amen. Is
[1:25:42] that Is that amazing grace? That's a
[1:25:44] good song. Let's sing that. I think you
[1:25:46] know who's who's experienced his amazing
[1:25:49] grace. It becomes amazing when you
[1:25:51] experience it. Amen. He saved a rich
[1:25:54] like me. Amen. He took me, washed me,
[1:25:57] cleansed me, filled me with his
[1:26:00] presence. Amen. Set me out into the
[1:26:02] world that he can reach others. Amen. He
[1:26:04] can live through a people. That his word
[1:26:06] is not a concept anymore. It becomes a
[1:26:08] tangible reality that's lived out. Amen.
[1:26:11] So, so if Christ for so for Christ to
[1:26:13] have the preeminence in our life, what
[1:26:15] does that look like? You love everybody.
[1:26:18] You don't hold a grudge. Amen. You're
[1:26:20] quick to forgive. You intercede for
[1:26:22] those who do wrong against you or
[1:26:23] against anyone. You don't you don't take
[1:26:25] sides. You don't get angry. No, you let
[1:26:28] God live. That that's to me the word
[1:26:30] having preeminence. In spite of what's
[1:26:32] going on in life, you trust the Lord.
[1:26:34] You know he's in control and he'll see
[1:26:36] you through. Amen. Let's go for this.
[1:26:38] Amazing
[1:26:40] [Music]
[1:26:43] grace,
[1:26:44] how sweet the sound
[1:26:48] that saved a wretch like me.
[1:26:56] I once was lost, but now I'm found.
[1:27:03] was blind.
[1:27:05] But now
[1:27:07] I see.
[1:27:11] It was grace that taught
[1:27:15] my heart to fear
[1:27:19] and grace my fears
[1:27:23] relieved.
[1:27:26] How precious
[1:27:29] did that grace
[1:27:32] appear.
[1:27:34] The hour
[1:27:36] I first
[1:27:38] believe.
[1:27:41] My chains are gone.
[1:27:45] I've been set free.

[1:28:16] has promised
[1:28:19] good to me.

[1:28:34] and wash

[1:46:10] about, but it'll be a living reality,
[1:46:12] Lord God. Live through us, Lord. Come
