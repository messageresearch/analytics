to be here amen God bless you all it's it's really great to have have Elana here with us God bless you it's always great to have you down here amen amen if you got your Bibles handy if you like to turn with me to Luke Chapter 20 and then we're going to go to Isaiah chapter 1 now we go to verse 34 I'm not uh I'm not going into not going into marriage and divorce today but um I just want to take a especially the uh the last three verses but um Jesus has asked a question about who will people marry if they marry more than one time here and you know in heaven and so on but I I don't want to go into that but I just want to I just want to go for a context really from from verse 36 but we want to read from verse 34 and Jesus answered and said unto them the children of this world marry and are given a marriage but they which shall be accounted worthy to obtain the world that world speaking of of this next World the Heaven and the resurrection from the dead neither marry nor are given a marriage neither can they die anymore for they equal unto the angels and are the children of God being the children of the Resurrection okay this is where I want to get my thought from so they are the children of God being the children of the Resurrection now that the dead are raised even Moses showed at the Bush when he called the Lord the god of Abraham and the god of Isaac and the god of Jacob for he is not the god of the dead but of the living for all live un him and now we want to go to Isaiah chapter 1 there's probably very very very much two contrasting uh scriptures but I trust the Lord will put it together now this is let's just uh let's just read from from verse two so this is the vision of Isaiah's Mighty prophet of God sent to the children of God after the flesh he says we'll just read from verse two he o heavens and give ear o Earth for the Lord has spoken I have nourished and brought up children and they have rebelled against me the ox knoweth his owner and the ass his master's crib but Israel does not know my people does not consider amen may the Lord bless his word you may be seated that may seem like a very strange uh very strange to piece of scripture but I want to I want to try and tie them together now Isaiah chapter 1 you know we read we read there in Luke Chapter 20 and I want to speak about the children of the resurrection and we know Jesus is speaking about those who have H have have gone on before you know neither given a marriage or marry in heaven but they're the children of God being the children of the Resurrection so if you're a child of of the Resurrection you're a child of God yeah and so a child knows who its parents are amen I know there's probably very I'll probably go very slow but I really want you to grasp something here a child unless they've been put in an orphanage when they're a baby they know who their parents are and even children in in orphanages if they really want to they can find their biological parents and you hear many stories of it be decades down the road but they but they and and even if their parents have passed on they they they they find out who they were where they lived and you know everything about them so but then you see even but Israel see it's such a contrast here children of God being the children of the Resurrection but here we have here we have Isaiah and he is sent to Israel and Israel after the natural natural lineage were the children of Abraham being the children of God yeah but you see he says that even and and and it's such a such a rebuke but you see here that that the Lord says you know I've nourished and brought up children so I've brought up a family but they have rebelled against me and God is God is saying that the like even even animals like an ox you know you know a an ox knows its owner you know a pet or you even even even farm animals as he's saying they know who their owner is they know who's in control they know who's the head of the farm or the family or whatever more and even even a an ass which is just a donkey it knows its Master's crib so it knows where it lives and you know knows who its Master is knows the that feeds it but you know but he says but Israel doesn't know these things so even even the animals knew who who who their Master is but he said the people of God do not even know who owns them who looks after them who keeps them in the land who reveals himself to them who makes himself known they didn't know who these they don't know who this God was but yet they had the temple they had the Books of Moses they had the prophets they had all the prophecies they had the word they had the pure word written word but yet they didn't even know who where they came from and where they going incredible if you think about it you know and they didn't even it says it says but Israel does not know and my people do not even consider so they don't they he's saying that they don't even sit down for a second and and consider who is our God who brought us from Egypt into this place who is the one that keeps us in the promised land who is the one that spoke to Moses you know who is this God of you know the god of our fathers Abraham Isaac and Jacob they weren't even considering these things but yet God but notice now God doesn't want to leave them in that state but God sends a prophet now to try and to try and get the people's attention that the people through the ministry of Isaiah they' say My Father which art in heaven Hallowed be thy name thy kingdom come thy will be done on Earth as it is in heaven so you know that's the reason why God sent Isaiah is because the people had gone sideways in their walk with God and they just got caught up in what the Nations around them were doing and what everything was going on and they were just stuck in this way they forgot who their parents were now if you know who your parents are if you know them you know their qualities amen even as you get older you know they weaknesses but then you realize they're human amen and that's not necessarily A Bad Thing amen because you know that they can understand what you're going through amen because they face the same things and so and so the people they do not by forgetting by forgetting who their God was now they begin to lean upon politics natural ability how we can hold this Kingdom together amen he following me because this is not an Isaiah's day here we are in 2016 the world the world you know the animals they know who their Master is you know you can you can take the scripture you can put it even into the you know you know even this day if you know who your parents are you know your your your family name you know the reputation of the family you know what the attributes are in the family oh my forbear did this and he did this and she did this and she was like this and you can see the characteristics come down and you know who where you're from amen I just just just just just bear with me a little bit okay but then if you don't know those things then you'll just you'll just move with the Winds of the society that you're in amen you won't have have any pride in who you really are you just say well this is where I am and these are my parents and you know well this is the society and your whole life will be dictated to by whichever current you know whichever way the current of life is going why are you like this we everyone El was like this why do you do this everyone else does this why do you think this everyone else thinks this amen but if but if you know who your parents are say well I love my mom and dad and they and they've tried to teach us the right way and I want to I want to honor them because I love them I'm talking about natural family but you you apply it to the spiritual and you say well I don't really want to even though because I'm in this body there's something my flesh may want to do it but there's something in me says that's not me amen that's why there's such a temptation to go with the crowd but we're not called to go with the crowd amen you know someone made a very crude statement he said a dead fish never swims against the current it just goes with the current but a life fish can swim against the current amen and we're not called to just float with the current amen we're not called to float with this world Jesus said Jesus said I don't I don't want to take you from the world but I want to keep you in this world I mean I want to keep you in this world and if you can recognize that you're a child of the Resurrection I'm a son or daughter of God Amen you'll you'll walk different you'll talk different you'll be different not because you Tred make yourself different but you recognize there's a life in you that makes you live a different kind of life and so now they forgot all about what they were and who they really were because God they had it they had now we know they didn't have Bibles like this they had Scrolls that would have been in Hebrew but they could have gone back to Exodus and they could have read about how God said if you keep my word I you I'll make you a royal priesthood a holy nation they could have read that if they knew who who their God was and if they if they remembered who he was they would have said this is what we want to be because our God said if we if we keep his word then he'll do this for us but they had forgotten they had the very people who should have remembered who God was forgot him amen and it's the same thing today Every Nation that's why it's so amazing you know people try and attack the Bible they say well everyone has a flood you a flood myth of a great flood and a boat being built and you know and he well they you you know people say well they just took that and they put it in the Bible no the reason that flood myth is into virtually every nation under Heaven is because it happened amen but what happens now is that the devil wants to twist the word because remember he wants to make us forget who we really who we really are amen and if he can take if he can take something like you know if he can just take the word and and then he can just twist it and say now this is just a local myth then you really the the whatever language or Nation it is they forget where they're really from amen and it's the same thing when when when people look at the word of God they say well it's just a western religion this has never been a western religion this is a middle eastern religion and it's not just Middle Eastern in origin but it's for all every tribe Kindred nation and tongue amen it's not it's not a skin color thing people want to have a debate with Jesus white or black it doesn't doesn't matter what he was Paul said it was the blood of God that was shed on Calvary amen he wasn't a juror a gentile if he was we're lost he was God in flesh so it doesn't matter I'm I'm not worried what he looked like all I know is the Bible tells me he wasn't a big handsome looking guy it says when we saw him there was nothing in him that we' desire him am mean but there was a life in him am mean he was the Lamb of God who was going to purchase Redemption amen and he wasn't afraid to pay the price amen he didn't weigh up the balance can I do it can I do it he knew he could do it amen he knew he could shed his life upon the Earth Amen to redeem you Hallelujah because he wanted to make the people but in the days of Isaiah they were walking in darkness there was no Revival there's no National Awakening to who they really were because if they really W If there really was an Awakening they wouldn't they would have cleaved to the Lord and they would have recognized all our problems could be solved if we just turned to God I mean doesn't matter what the Assyrians are doing what the Babylonians and the Egyptians and whoever more whatever they're doing we just need to cleave to God Amen and then he would have taken care of it because they could have just read testimonies they could have gone to the Book of Judges could have read Gideon read about barck and and Deborah and you know all the stories all the way down they could recognize hey if we just turn to this God that we've just heard about he'll become real to us and he can take care of everything Hallelujah now the word I want to take this you know we we live in a day and hour where the people of God know who they are amen amen we know who we are in the word am amen it's not a mental understanding or I've I've you I've done a seven step course to become a Christian but God becomes real amen amen and you go from just being a being a child of the Dust remember a son of Adam thust thou art thust thou shall return and so we go from being a son of the Dust Adam means dust amen we go from that from a child of dust to a child of the Resurrection amen because a you know we know dust and I know I've talked about these things you know in some ways before but dust it just goes with the wind whichever way the wind's glowing there goes the dust oh this is the popular fashion of the day and there you are oh now we're all watching these things and here we are have you watched Game of Thrones never watch the episode but if you're son of the Dust here we go amen oh cuz it's cool who says it's cool amen oh everyone's doing it does that mean it's right amen Walking with God is not a democracy it never has been a democracy it's always been the Lord's despised few amen Moses Moses wasn't all that well liked even though he took the people up to Jordan amen and all the prophets which one did they receive and have a glorious time not a single one they were sorn aund they were rejected they were thrown in prison all manner of things happen to them and even Jesus now you look you look Jesus all he had he was a very God God was made flesh and walked Among Us and here he was and and he and he only ended up with you it says in the scripture Paul says that after his resurrection he revealed himself to 500 people at once but only 120 of them were in the upper room amen oh that's not a very successful Ministry it it was exactly as successful as he wanted it to be and he knew he was who was going to be there he wasn't worried about numbers amen even even when he preached a service in John chapter 6 he says unless you eat my flesh and drink my blood you have no life in you and then the fundamentals day would have thought Moses said You shall not do that so therefore he's just contradicted the scripture he didn't contradict the scripture they didn't understand what he was saying and then there was 5,000 then after one sermon he had 12 and then he doesn't and he doesn't chase after them saying no please come back I'll make myself clear he actually says to the disciples will you go as well and then and Peter says well to whom shall we go you alone have the words of eternal life but notice his response he doesn't say oh I'm so glad you caught it he says don't you know I've chosen you one of you a devil he just leaves it kind of hanging he knows who's going to be a child of the Resurrection you see but that's all he really had in his day John didn't have a great big group he was he was the one to forun the first coming of God God was going to become flesh born born of Mary born into the human race as a man but a God man and he was the one to introduce him he only had a small group amen and he even got discourage when he's there in prison and his eagle eyes brother BR says clouded over you know and he and he say to some of his some of his disciples go ask him is he really the one but when he was standing there on the banks of the Jordan he says he says he's even standing among you now he so he was so gripped and then he saw the vision you know you of the of the spirit of God descending upon him and and abiding upon him and he pointed him out in the crowd says here comes the Lamb of God to take away the sin of the world Amen so he and and he stood against all the religions in that day but then at the end of his ministry he says well is this really it and then now the one who is the resurrection and the life tells his disciples stay around a little bit we're going to have church amen and then go tell John what you see amen and then and then when they took the testimony back he said praise God I've done my job amen he didn't have a big they didn't have a big group the church the the real Believers have never been accepted in every part of society amen you see Martin Luther was on the run in in in Germany and Europe amen have you read church history Paul Paul was Paul was beaten stoned ran from City to City all you know they were persecuted they were Afflicted amen you take Luther was the same way Wesley you know wisley he had to use just open air he had to have open air meetings he even used his father's grave many times as a Pulpit amen because the churches closed their doors they say we'll not have this man preaching our churches anymore he was a church aged messenger bringing the Word of Life to a nation was he accepted did they say oh come on in I'm so glad you're here praise God we're going to have no away with this guy amen every single move of God has been has been rejected and it's been the people have been persecuted you know you can't wait oh maybe one day this message will become popular it'll never become popular because the message down Through the Ages has never been popular amen but to those who receive it it gives them power to become the Sons and Daughters of God yes amen it causes the resurrection to come into them Hallelujah and they begin to realize they begin to realize who their father is amen the very problem that that God was speaking to Isaiah about the ones who know their God Amen they they are not stumbling around in darkness like Israel was are you are you following me amen now I just want to let's just go to Romans chapter 8 it says Romans chapter 8 and we'll read from verse 14 now it says here for as many are as is led by the spirit of God they are the sons of God for ye have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear but ye have received the spirit of adoption whereby you cry Abba Father now I just want to stop right there you see believers who have gone on you know every every Christian says they're not scared to die yeah but it's when death begins to take grip is really the proof of the pudding are they scared or are they scared are they scared or are they not scared you know there was there was a case brother brah was talking about of a of a of a lady who who went to the church a little bit but then left and went to another church and she was she was dying and she was all calm and happy but then when when when life was beginning to leave her she she came into shock and she realized she was lost and she began to cry out I'm lost I'm lost and and and she looked at the minister says you deceiver of man you've deceived me now I'm lost who's a Methodist minister or somewh some some denomination and she cried out go get that go get that preacher down there from that other Church speaking of brother Brandon but it was but but then the minister said to the doctor just just give her a hypo to calm her down so injected some something into her and then she fell asleep and she was gone but she realized now I'm not saying that to shock you but I'm saying that that there's a realization you know the first thing everyone will know when they pass to the next side is there's a God and his name is Jesus Christ that's the first thing everyone will know amen and but you see she thought she was fine but then when life was leaving her the real her her real State came into being amen but then those who have really met the Lord not you know not just being caught up in a church oh we have church and this is what we do but those who really know him I mean you got to I pray to God you I was singing this the other day I'm glad God found me before the church did amen and I pray even that's the same with with with you that God finds you before you get caught up and now we have church and we have services and this is what we do and that's just a way of life this is not some way of life amen it's it's you meet God personally and you know him the power of his resurrection amen but then there's others and I'll take I'll take Christine's Auntie had was dying of a brain tumor there in Switzerland Christine went over to look after her and for about three months and she was she was on death's St not even a Christian that's is how simple it is and she would see dark things move in the room why because she was slipping from this world into the next world but where she was going was going down amen but the Lord was merciful to her and Christine talked to her and prayed with her and she gave her life gave her life over accepted what Jesus Jesus Paid It All am mean it's not about jumping through a whole bunch of Hoops you just got to give your life over and then after that she just saw beautiful big birds Just Like Paradise was there amen I can see your reflection in the window hey isn't that right honey amen and so just that simple thing God came into the room she accepted what he did for her and then in going from and then after that she wasn't scared amen so I was saying the proof of the pudding is when you know when it's really life is leaving where you going to go and she knew she was going to a better place hallelujah hallelujah and that's how simple it was you see so it is the now and and that's why we have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear because it always used to be and man still does it with religion unless you tow the line you're lost amen and they put a fear upon people it's not about a fear it should be a love I'm not a Christian because I'm scared I'm going to go to hell amen I I'm a Christian because I love him and that's it amen that's why we have not and and and if he has made himself real to me and he's brought me thus far as he carried you am mean if he's carried you thus far he's not going to drop you in the very crucial moment when when you really need him and that's why I don't have a fear amen because I've I've given my life into his hands and remember God is a gentleman and I said this on Wednesday but God does not take things from us you know it's not like and I just use this crude expression this is just how it came to me God is Not like someone who mugs someone you know what a Mugger is Beats them up grabs their goods and runs away God doesn't mug you amen you have you CU some people say well I'll give this up or I'll surrender this after I meet him that's not how it works you have to give it to him and then he takes it from you cuz he's a gentleman he's not you know he's you know he's not a robber or a thief you have to actually say here you are Lord and then he takes it from you amen unless you're willing to do that then he'll let you hold on to it amen he doesn't you know it's man's it is not God that sends people to hell it is man sends himself amen because we have a free moral choice amen and we have the power to choose which way are we going to go and it's purely you say well what what about predestination I say this God knows who's going to end up where they're going to end up amen because if he didn't know he'd be God I mean I mean he wouldn't be God are you following me amen so it's actually Man's Free moral choice the power to choose but you must understand that your choice is governed by your nature amen that's why some people they choose and they end up doing horrible things amen but there's other people and and these two unconverted people one nature they can end up doing horrible things and the other person can have a nicer nature and do not so horrible things but unless God comes into that life they're both lost amen so it's not remember it's not a merited well I've done this I've done that therefore I earn you know this is not a you don't earn Heaven it's a free gift you have to choose just to accept it amen it's really that simple you just have to choose to accept it and so now that's why we have not received the Spirit uh we have not received the spirit of bondage against to fear so we have not received the spirit whereby we are in slavery amen but ye have received the spirit of adoption whereby you cry Abba Father so Paul is telling these Romans and he's telling you this morning he well God is rather he says if you received the spirit of God Amen you have not received the spirit of fear or bondage some slavery to the schemes of man or what other circumstance you may find you in or your past forget about your past amen if you've given it to God God doesn't remember it and God doesn't want you to remember it God doesn't want you to be a slave to maybe what even you did yesterday amen if you've given given it to him amen it says he he takes it he puts it in the sea of his forgetfulness what does that mean God has the we may remember but God has the ability to forget amen because God does not want you thinking he holds things against you amen because if if you think and you take this in a natural relationship if you think someone's holding something against you you can't have the relationship that you really ought to have amen because you got to deal with whatever the thing is that they're holding against you amen and it's up to the other person can they let it go or not if they can't let it go then there's always going to be a blockage amen there's always going to be a blockage well they wronged me the whole world wronged God Amen even even God in his Mercy in the Old Testament as we read there in Isaiah 1 the ox knows it Master the ass knows his master's crib but Israel doesn't even know they don't even consider and then but yet he sent Prophet after Prophet sign after sign am me to get their attention to get them to turn back to him and then he came to his own Jesus says he came to his own his own received him not amen but yet Jesus who was God in flesh he didn't hold it against hisra he said father forgive them they don't know what they're doing amen and if he can have that kind of and we're to be like Jesus amen are we not it's so easy oh to be like Jesus we it's so easy to sing it or say it but when the rubber hits the road and a challenge comes into life can you be like Jesus oh they wrong me will you not being like Jesus amen these people did me wrong and oh I'm going to deal with them that's not being like Jesus am amen because if you want to be like Jesus you just got to pray and just let it go amen how do you truly forgive you surrender the ability to hold it against people that's how you truly forgive and so God doesn't want you doesn't want your past to be held against you amen and so that's why but but we must also remember we have received the spirit of adoption whereby you cry Abba Father now we understand that adoption in the in the uh Jewish way of things is not say if we go to China and we get a Chinese baby and we come bring it and we sign some papers now they're part of the gloin family that's not adoption in Bible language in Bible language it's a placing of a son or I say or a daughter into the family it's already been born into the family but now they're placed into a level of responsibility amen that is that is adoption in in in Bible language so now if if the spirit of God has come upon you and changed you and amen you are a son or daughter of God Amen he say well you say well brother Ben why are you talking about these things you need to really this has got to Anchor in like nothing else because God cannot lose a part of himself amen God will not lose a part of himself and you can see it in Adam and Eve Adam could not lose Eve amen remember Eve was deceived the scripture says Eve was deceived Adam had his eyes WI open he knew what he was doing and he tried to and he did it because he wanted to try and save Eve because Adam knew that if his life was in in Eve then God could not take her amen because they're part of one another and Adam knew Adam knew hey he had a whole bunch more ribs and and evidently ribs are one of the parts of the body that actually can grow back amen so he knew he had a whole bunch of ribs but he didn't have any more feminist part of himself so there's no so a body a female body could be made but there's no feminist Spirit to go into that body and so he knew if he lost he he lost it all amen it's the same thing with God God could not lose one of his amen because he's only got so much woman amen that's been born through every age a bride through every age and he can't lose a part of that amen it's like building you know Peter says that we're Lively or living Stone built up into the house of God you know you can't complete a house or a building if there's a stone missing amen very simple but you got to understand and you got to and that's why I want to say these things because you got to recognize if there's something in you that wants him amen and he doesn't and you may think well I'm just going to do my own kind of life but he keeps stepping on your path stepping on your path trying to get your attention you know normally God is only obligated to everyone once amen but God in his infinite grace and mercy he'll keep trying to get your attention and come upon your heart and speak to you and bring people across your path because why is that he's trying to get your attention saying you're part of me where are you going amen he wants to get your attention because he wants you to be a child of the Resurrection Hallelujah and so whereby you cry Abba Father or my father or my you know you know my father my father B me and then the spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit that we are the children of God so there's something in The Believer I mean after they've really given it all I just say one thing don't hold anything back amen I don't care what kind of you know Paul and I said it a couple of Sundays ago and I was a bit shocked at myself I said you just got to forget everything you've ever known and Paul said I count everything but dung that I may win Christ so and he had more religion than all of us combined amen but he said I count it all but dung amen he didn't hold it in a steam oh this is wonderful this is wonderful he counted it but D that he may win Christ and so that's why when I said that I was thinking about but then that scripture came to mind I say well that's just the Bible just in a different way amen so the spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit that we are the children of God and there's something and you can't put into language but there's just something you know all the way down through the Bible it's been there's people have tried to put on paper or God through them has tried to put on paper what it's like to meet God Amen but there's always the there's there's unless someone's experienced it you cannot understand it amen you know you you know you take Moses in the burning bush I don't know how he would have really well I know cuz I've met that same God but trying to convey that to others there was a bush that wasn't burning I mean was burning but it wasn't consumed and a voice spake out of that Bush saying I'm the god of Abraham Isaac and Jacob amen and then you know all the Believers all the way down through what it's like cuz there's a very there's a massive difference it may sound very much the same well I'm a Christian I've been baptized God's done a work and I'm sure he has but there's a big difference between saying that and saying I've really met him and my life is no longer the same amen because we can get built up on emotion but emotion will fail amen people get and remember if God brings emotion the spirit of God brings emotion amen but emotion is not it amen when you meet him for yourself you'll see there's been a change in you amen it's not just an emotion but emotion's definitely a part of it now but so but then when you really meet him something in you that bears witness you know there's no condemnation amen you know you don't have that weight of sin anymore you know something's happened to you amen and that's why this your spirit Beth witness with his I mean the spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit that we are the children of God and then children then we're ears and ears of God and Joint ears with Christ if so be that we suffer with him that we may be also glorified together now this word child there in verse sorry in verse 17 and 21 so that's children and CH uh um children there it means one born and so if we are and that is the same word there in in Luke saying the children of the resurrection and so if we're born of the Resurrection now we receive receive certain benefits okay now Jesus when Jesus came the first time the Believers passed sure they passed from Death un life but before the day of Pentecost they were cowards they were scared and when the pressure came on they couldn't overcome whatever the enemy was trying to do against them you see Peter's a perfect example now I got a reason I'm going this way I want okay so Peter was perfect example he says Lord I won't deny you you know I'll you know I'll do all these kind of things I'll I I'll Stand By You then the Lord even says before the Roo or the crows you'll deny me three times amen and then what happened the pressure comes down even tries to kill a guy says well we might go down swinging and mean he tries to kill a guy with the sword and do all kinds of things then when the pressure came on aren't you one of them don't you know him and he and he denies the Lord three times even curses while doing it so when the pressure came on he couldn't hold the pressure but then after the day of Pentecost didn't matter what persecution came on they rejoiced they prayed the spirit of God came down and broke whatever the enemy was trying to do because they were now the children of the Resurrection amen they were the children of the Resurrection because that because the resurrection came into them amen and it wasn't remember this is not just oh that's a nice idea or isn't that neat that really happened amen God came into them and then God lived out of them and didn't matter what the enemy tried to do they were beaten they said Don't Preach in his name anymore they're beaten did that cow them though they went out rejoicing thank you Lord that I've been counted worthy to be persecuted for your name's sake Hallelujah and so they they were given the power to live above the world that they are in amen they were given the power to live above the world they were in and to live in this world Amen and it didn't matter what part of the body they were if they were Apostles or or was it Doras that made um clothes and sold them and things doesn't matter what part of the body they were in they all were anointed to overcome what the enemy was doing because they were risen you know and that word Resurrection means to stand up again amen so man Adam was standing in the garden but then man fell and man was Fallen all the way down through even though God anointed man and all things happened but man had fallen and it was only in the Resurrection season that man could really stand up again amen and take dominion over Satan and his devices Hallelujah that they weren't you know Paul Paul before he met the Lord on the road to Damascus before he met the resurrection he was he was a slave he was a servant of that religious system he was a Pharisee of the Pharisees and he was just one of their monkeys doing the dance amen playing to their tune dancing to their tune but then when he met the resurrection he wasn't under that yoke anymore amen I think we ought to Rejoice amen he didn't you know he wasn't Bound by those things he was risen above those things and didn't matter what the enemy tried to do to him he was he was he he was in control amen and his circumstances sure didn't bother him there he is standing before King AG grippa however many years after the road to Damascus experience he's in Chains and he and he begins to preach to him Christ and then King AG grippa says you almost persuaded me to become a Christian and he says I wish you would amen except for these bonds but remember Paul wasn't the one in in Chains he was the freest man in that room amen amen cuz here was a man that if his breath left him his life left him he'd go up into Glory he wasn't afraid he says a crown of life awaits me Hallelujah he'd already been taken beyond the curtain of time he knew he knew where he was going he wasn't worried about it he says to you know he said you know not not in these words but but he basically said I'd rather be in glory but it's good that I'm here amen that's what he said so he wasn't afraid whatever happened if he was beaten if he was Shipwrecked if he was robbed or whatever happened he just walked with God because he was a child of the Resurrection he was he was lifted above all of these things that he faced Hallelujah and that was the benefit now of Jesus rising yeah because remember Christianity is not me standing here and telling you about a historical Jesus you can't get the you know you know the expression you cannot get warm next to a painted fire amen if he's real then he's real if he's not if he's only a god of History it does us no good amen but he's not a god of History am mean he's a resurrected alive present this morning here with you everywhere you go he's with you he's alive amen let's not get bogged down in Tradition and oh this is how we do things and whatever kick that out the formality all that kind of nonsense amen he's alive amen and don't constrain him or restrain him to what you think he should do amen don't limit God by what you think he should do and so he was able to live above all of these things and then now you come down remember Jesus said because they said to him Master give us a sign he says a wicked and adulterous generation seeks after signs but you'll get a sign you'll get the sign of the prophet Jonah as Jonah was in the belly of the whale you know three days whatever more so shall the son of man be in the earth and and brother B says what sign was that the sign of the Resurrection amen and then now 2,000 years go by and then now is a adulterous Wicked generation upon the Earth and God said I'll send them a sign I'll send them the sign of the Resurrection amen and the sign of the Resurrection is what he did back there he does the same thing because the sign of the Resurrection is the proof that he's alive Hallelujah and then now Here Comes Here Comes Elijah the spirit of Elijah sent to the Earth unto a prophet and he stands there and he says it thousands of times I hope not exaggerating that he says it heaps he says the sign he says we have the sign of the Resurrection amen we have the proof that Jesus is Alive amen and he doesn't and he says and he's here and then he said now what did Jesus do before the cross and knew what the people were thinking everything about them amen and he says to show you he's here he begin to point people out you just go listen to a message am mean it's done in front of thousands of people watch the Deep call for you know deep call to the Deep thousands of people in that big AUD um um Auditorium there and he and he calls people out not just people in the prayer line gives them their name their address where they you know what they were doing I see you sitting on the bed praying and you feel like you're going to fall over all you know all those different things right down to what they had and and he was God was doing that because he said remember he said I'm just your brother I can't heal you yep Jesus already done it by his stripes we were ah true but were the scripture we it's finished so he says why does why does God come down that way and give Visions Vision after Vision I see this I see this this is where you're from you know people who you know eyewitnesses said you were just naked you couldn't hide anything you knew you couldn't hide anything from God Amen that's the same thing today but you see that was all done that the faith of the people would rise that they would receive their healing because he says I can't heal you Jesus if even if you were standing here he couldn't do it cuz he's already done it amen just like salvation Salvation is already done but faith has to rise that you can get a hold of what he's done for you amen so he says many times he says this is the sign of the Resurrection now there's benefits there's benefits to the resurrection amen I want you to understand so now he was for 2,000 years the lamb our lamb has been a mediator amen he's been standing because there's one mediator between man and God the man Christ Jesus amen so he's been a mediator between you and God Amen for this whole world he's been a mediator and so he's the goet I put it that way remember he's the blood he's the sacrifice and so when God when God looks down and sees you he doesn't see you he sees the blood amen so it's not you this is why you've just got to kick out of your mind forever your what you feel are insufficiencies amen because God doesn't see you he's not looking at you he's looking at the blood amen and all he hears is your voice through the blood amen that's all he sees so it's not all me and what you know my personality and what I'm going through you know we we have a sticky brother B says we have a sticky part this this body our sticky nature amen and it's always with us Yep this flesh is always with us until the body change amen our soul is redeemed this flesh is not redeemed so your first nature is with you whether you say praise the Lord or woe is me amen it's it's there but if you're a child of the Resurrection you you have been risen above this first nature amen there's a life that comes into you that allows you to live above this thing amen but then even but then even if you may slip back into that first nature again it doesn't mean you're lost remember if you've been redeemed you don't put yourself back as a sinner amen you must never do that but you if if you confess your sins he's faithful and just to forgive you am amen so you got to you know you just got to recognize I live in this body this body is not redeemed just just come to peace with it amen that means your emotions and your your conscience your reasoning everything your spirit realm that's not redeemed is this okay you just got to come to peace with it amen but it's your soul that's been redeemed amen and so you just got to let your soul take control of every other part of you amen that's why some people they can have such a Victorious however long period of time and then they fall over then they get up and say well am I really a Believer or not absolutely amen amen you're still a Believer you just got to recognize this guy remember when you receive the Holy Ghost it's not like a switch is flicked and every and now you become a robot and everything's fine and I'm going to Crest every wave amen it doesn't work that that way oh but that's a bit disappointing no it's not because God wants to show his salvation even in a fallen group of people he wants to show his salvation is greater than what the enemy did I mean what did the enemy do he took the serpent which wasn't a snake in the beginning and mixed it with the human race I mean that's why we have now these Hybrid Bodies with a not just a flesh hybrid body but a spirit realm that's hybrid amen remember Eva's called the mother of all living never says Adam was search the scripture amen he says that Cain was of that Wicked one in the New Testament and that word of means point of origin in the Greek amen it's not there you cannot find Cain and Adam's lineage why is that cuz he's not a son of Adam he's a son of the serpent but now there's a mix amen so it's those who are redeemable are the sons of of God amen amen so so we have these Fallen bodies but God wants to show because remember the devil in the garden that was his best shot he says how can I because he knew God was holy remember he was the anointed cherub that cover he knew what worship was he knew that God is a holy God so he says now how can I get the people to fall how can I get all of humanity how can I cause his children to fall that now they can never get back to him amen it wasn't a it wasn't all see what happens no he planned it he knew what it was like how how animals mix and all these you know he knew how biology worked and knew the spirit realm how it worked amen so so he worked it out says now if I do this there's no way they're beyond Redemption and they're stuck in this condition amen then but then but then the first promise it's so neat the first prophecy to come out of God's mouth was actually to the end enemy the seed of the woman is going to crush the head of the seat of the serpent amen and that was the first prophecy of Jesus coming then here comes the seat of the woman created in a in a you know created in Mary's womb here's the seat of the woman steps out Hallelujah and now here he is he said I'm going to undo all these things I'm going to bring my children forth Hallelujah and they may still be in these Fallen bodies but the life in them is going to overcome Hallelujah that's why you've just got a that's why you got to have I trust you now I know it's not by feeling but I trust you know who you really are in God Amen I trust you really know I am a son or a daughter of God hallelujah because if you know that remember Jesus you shall call his name Jesus for he shall save his people from their sins amen oh what about everyone else don't worry about everyone else the only way you can help everyone else is get a hold is let God get a hold of you then you can help everyone else amen cuz cuz some people madej you what about all the world and everything that's going on don't worry about them worry about you then say Lord send me to wherever you want to send me amen and then so now he and then so Jesus came the resurrection became flesh amen I am the resurrection and the life he said to Mary or Martha believest thou this just before he's going to raise up Lazarus I am the resurrection and the life so the resurrection became flesh but he didn't want that Resurrection just to be in him amen he wanted that Resurrection to become flesh in his church amen and then so he gave the people the ability to live above am mean live Above This flesh because the greatest miracle I think I've said it before the greatest miracle that Jesus did was not feeding the thousands raising the dead stopping nature whatever it was the greatest Miracle he was is go to Calvary as a man and subject himself to the word of God Amen and take the sins of the world to the Cross as a man that's the greatest Miracle because Adam Adam in his Fallen State he couldn't you know all of the prophets down through they had a weakness in their flesh amen and Satan hit that weakness and they fell amen they could not fully subject themselves to the word amen but now here comes a man who tempted on All Points like we were who went through everything we go through in life amen was rejected and despised of men amen know knows all the live through all the hardships that we do and more besides cuz he says he said the son of man doesn't even he says Foxes of dens birds of nests but I don't have a place even to sleep we have a house we have a bed you know we have all these things he didn't have those things and amen he became the poorest of the poor and he did that in order to show that man can live above the world Amen Hallelujah and then so now but remember now time slipped away but the what he's wanting to do now is there benefits of the resurrection and so when he comes when he is risen amen he brings benefits with them now brother Bram says it and you can see it in church history you you see in church history you see the day of Pentecost you see the book of Acts God displays himself in a mighty a quick short work of power and then the church begins to go down and dies in the Dark Ages then comes forth again and the reason that happened is because they mixed man's traditions and Creeds of man in with the pure word of God and if you mix in Creeds of man and you know things that are not the Bible then it then it actually limits God's ability to work amen you can see it in the Old Testament they begin to worship other gods then what happened the enemy comes in and and takes dominion over them but if they stuck to the pure word of God say we have nothing to do with all this stuff they would have been Victorious every generation amen and then so now so brother Bram says that the that the Holy Ghost has been bound at the doors of you know do of churches by the Creeds and doctrines of man amen and that's why that's why you see the you know Pentecostal move in the very you know book of Acts God living in his people then his work continuing amen but you don't really see that until this day amen amen you see it in a smaller degree Through the Ages but not the fullness of it as it was in the beginning amen because the Creeds and doctrines of men bound the holy spirit amen the people still met the Lord they still knew knew him amen but he was limited but then now God has restored his word amen so he says he's been bound for 2,000 years but then through the end time message the Holy Ghost is loosed upon the people again Hallelujah and I'm sure many of us can attest to that reality and so now the Holy Ghost is loosed upon the people and we can say now he's risen again amen he with me because he was they tried to put him in a Roman tomb of denominationalism down through 2,000 odd years amen but now the stones been rolled away remember brother Brown preaching a sermon it's the rising of the sun I trust this is not just up in here for you amen but he's actually making a declar declaration he says when that Easter you know that Sunday morning when the sun rose he said it was a dual sun rising a natural sun was Rising but now the Son of God was rised from the dead Victorious over hell death in the grave Hallelujah the Earth couldn't hold him the Earth can't hold you this world can't hold you amen the Creeds and everything of man cannot hold you remember he was the first of the Resurrection amen and he says to you he says because I live you shall live also Hallelujah he's not just talking about natural life he's talking about Immortal Life amen and so he says so so he's saying now it is the rising of the sun and when the Sun rises it's heralding a new day a new Time Has Come amen so now he comes to the end remember everything Adam lost has to be restored amen and so Adam lost dominion over the Earth yeah I know I've said these things but I really wanted to Anchor in amen everything Adam lost has to be restored but because God wants to display the power of the Cross he wants to restore it to man Even though man is still in the sinful condition hallelujah amen so man man is going to be restored see it's not oh when I receive a new body then I'll be like Adam was in the garden now God wants you to be like Adam in the garden this side of the body change amen hallelujah so everything so Adam had dominion over nature he had dominion over everything upon the this Earth cuz he was made God of this Earth amen he had remember God was you know man was a minor God under the Lord God as we know is Jesus Christ and so he wants to restore man back to that condition even in these bodies amen and so as I said and I've said a few times when when there's a resurrection there's benefits of that Resurrection amen so now he says now I'm just going to try and tie this all together I trust it sinks in remember he says there's a there's a jeel sun rising amen not just a natural son Rose the Son of God Is Risen amen and we can even read it it says in the Book of Malachi let's just read this I'm going to try and wind this up Malachi 4:2 but unto you that fear my name shall the son of righteousness arise with healing in his wings and you shall grow go forth and grow up as carves of the sto and you shall tread down the wicked for they shall be ashes Under The Souls of your feet in the day that I shall do this sayth the Lord of hosts so he's promised that he shall arise with healing in his wings amen so there will be another rising of the sun you see and then now on this day this day we have remember he's been our mediator for 2,000 years remember and he still is our mediator but then there comes a time where the book the title deed that Adam lost is claimed by a man again amen amen and so it's in this season where and it says and John looked and the book was sealed with Seven Seals amen no one was found worthy to take that book so no one was found worthy to restore what Adam lost no man and and John wept but then one of the you know one of the elders I think said that we're not John for the light of the tribe of Judah has prevailed and has been counted worthy and brother R says here comes Jesus coming out of the eternities he was in his mediatorial work now he comes to lay claim on what he has purchased amen amen now he's come to lay claim on what he's purchased and he takes that book and he opens the seals of that book amen and so what he's doing now remember it's all symbolic but he's saying remember this is actually the book cuz all of everything that Adam lost is in this book amen and so now here comes the lamb he takes hold of his purchased possession and he doesn't leave it bound he looses it amen now Hallelujah you are part of that book I may be going way far out there but I just want you to think about this he takes you remember he sends his word amen yeah my wife she had to quote with me how how brother bam says that Jesus is the right hand of God and he has made known by his word amen so what happens is now Jesus Remember Faith cometh by hearing and hearing the word of God so now man preaches man's inspired and he preaches and then Faith Rises and then the people become free and they walk with God but what that does now is the word being preached is actually God laying claim amen he lays claim on what belongs to him through the preaching of his word so what happens now is he steps forth and he's doing this he's laying claim remember he and he has to do this to free you that all the other ages that died in the faith can come forth amen so so through the preaching of the word he lays claim on you and then he picks you up to where he is but he doesn't leave your life sealed up amen just like in the Tomb he didn't leave Jesus wasn't stuck in the Tomb sealed up are you following me and then he picks you up and then he re he releases the seals that have bound you up amen and reveals who you really are Hallelujah and he carries you away amen hallelujah amen amen that's why or you say well how does that work well go back in your own life you're doing all kinds of things the devil had you beaten down then one day you hear the real gospel amen and then you begin to realize who your father really is amen and you begin to understand you don't belong to this world remember when you you if you're in an orphanage you say well I'm just part of this orphanage but then if you're if your parents step into the room and you look at them and say hey that guy looks like me it says son daughter come amen then you say now I belong to them that's why my little girls I say mommy daddy and the little whoever's you know we're playing bear or lions or whatever it is you're the daddy bear mommy's the mommy bear or you we're the little lions you know or the Bears whatever you know because it's so fixed into them this is Mommy and Daddy if I know where Mommy and Daddy are now and then I'm part of the family so now I have my I have my security amen that's the same thing with us I trust justice mean something to you I mean if you really know who your father is that's why when he lays claim on you you can say my father Abba Father my father my father Hallelujah and then the things that once hold you held you back he begins to release them he begins to break those chains break those seals and then he really shows you who you really are on the inside amen because if you just look at IM if this book was sealed say well it's you okay this is interesting this leather on this book is actually Pig leather pig skin according to the care instructions when I got it it's amazing because uh that is considered an unclean animal amen but this is the word of God and I say that sums me up pretty well outside is an unclean animal Hallelujah but within is the word of God and because the word of God is on the inside it makes the outside clean hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah but if it was sealed up you you wouldd say well this is the leather and this is how thick it looks and you know it looks nice you don't know what's on the inside just like you you didn't know what was on the inside of you amen oh this is my parents this is my nationality this is what we do that's not the real that's the outside amen but when you hear the word he lays claim on you he takes the seals off and then you begin to really see what's in you amen and that's what he brings remember through through through much tribulation do we enter into the kingdom of God the scripture says amen so don't count it strange I'm going through you some heart or some trial or whatever more God's allowed it cuz he wants to show you what's in the inside of the book amen why did why did in the days of Gideon maybe we need some musicians to come but why in the days of Gideon why did he allow the midianites and the people of of the East to basically eat up the whole country cuz he wanted to show get in what's on the inside of him behold you're a mighty man of Val I don't look like a mighty man of Valor look what's on the inside of you I'm going to show you amen and with 300 men I don't even know if they swung a sword they just blew the trumpet sha the light broke the picture and they killed each other all done let's sit back and watch what happens amen and it's a same thing with you I don't enjoy it he says count it all joy count it all joy when you go through hardship and trials and whatever more because what does God want to do remember God does not have confidence in your flesh brother BR preach a sermon perfect strength and perfect weakness and he says many times we think of weaknesses as excuses that's not what it is he says perfect weakness is being perfectly surrendered amen if you're perfectly surrendered then you can have perfect strength that's the only way you can have perfect strength amen is being completely dependent upon the Lord and so that's why God allows hardship and all these things he wants to show what's in you amen that's why I say you know we don't even brother R preached about there's untapped resources in God there un things that have never been tapped into and refined and brought out in you never but we have the we only have this life amen because many times I think we just think well what does it mean to be a Christian well we go to church and we pray for our meals pray at the end of the day read a Bible chapter maybe listen to a sermon sometimes that's it that's just the outside amen God doesn't just want you to have that kind of walk with him amen he he's saying there's there's resources in me that are untapped come and get them amen amen you have the ability he wants he actually wants to give them to you but remember he's a gentleman you ask you receive not because you ask not amen so friends let's just tap in what are you afraid of Amen remember just learning things and coming to church that's just that's not learning things in coming to church it's all part of it but that's that's just not even it amen you got to become a child of the Resurrection amen and the same Jesus that I met in 2007 I'm fully persuaded he's here in 2016 cuz I'm the Lord God and I change not amen amen let's all stand shall we I know time slipped away but I trust deep down in your soul you can say I know in whom I have believed they's sing that showing amen that you can that you have confidence I am a child of God being a child of the resurrection and brother B even says that we are the sign of the Resurrection The Believer is because we've already been resurrected from Death to life amen and the life you live is actually the life you live now is a sign pardon me of the Resurrection to this Dying World amen [Music] hallelujah I know not why God's wonderous Grace to me he has made no no why unworthy Christ in love redeem before for his own oh but I know whom I have believ it and am persuaded that he is able to keep that which I've committed unto him against that day I know not how this saving Faith to me he did imp part for how believing in his word brought peace within my heart but I know who I have believe it and persuaded that he is able to keep that which I've committed unto him against that day I know not how the spirit through convincing men of sin ring Jesus Through the word creating faith in him but I know whom I have beli with and am persuaded that he is able to keep that which I've commit unto him against that day I know not what of good or ill may be reserved for me of wey ways or Golden Days before his face I see oh but I know who I have belied and am persuaded that he is able to keep that which I've committed unto him against that day I know not when my Lord May Come at night on noon day faar for if I walk but fail with him for meet him in the end but I know whom I have believed and am persuaded that he is able to keep that which I've committed unto him and S day but I know who I have beli and I'm persuaded that he is able to keep that which I've committedto him against that day hallelujah amen I trust you've you you you've given yourself to him hallelujah hallelujah it's worth it all amen let's just pray shall we gracious father
