[31:26] great to have everyone here today amen
[31:28] who's happy to be a Christian hallelujah

[31:35] be happy we're Christians you know we
[31:36] have eternal life that's a big deal you
[31:38] know amen praise the Lord God bless you
[31:40] all let's go to the book of Deuteronomy
[31:43] welcome everyone praise the Lord great
[31:45] to have everyone here amen trust you all
[31:47] feel at home and relaxed in the presence
[31:50] of God Amen

[31:54] see I can drive it all right
[31:58] amen praise praise the Lord amen we um
[32:02] amen it's good to be
[32:05] here today amen so we're just going to
[32:07] read here Jerome 29 the first four
[32:09] verses then the last verse of this
[32:11] chapter these are the words of the
[32:13] Covenant which the Lord commanded Moses
[32:15] to make with the children of Israel in
[32:17] the land of MOA beside the Covenant
[32:19] which he made with them in horeham and
[32:21] Moses called unto all Israel and said
[32:23] unto them ye have seen all that the Lord
[32:26] did before your eyes in the land of
[32:27] Egypt under pharaoh and unto all his
[32:29] servants and unto all his land the great
[32:32] Temptations which thine eyes have seen
[32:34] the signs and those great Miracles yet
[32:37] the Lord hath not given you a heart to
[32:39] perceive eyes to see and ears to hear
[32:41] unto this day so they saw it but they
[32:44] didn't see it but now they see it all
[32:46] right and then in Deuteronomy so the
[32:48] last part of this I thought was
[32:49] interesting this in the same um I know
[32:52] chapters and verses are put in later but
[32:53] I thought this is interesting this is in
[32:54] the same chapter here the secret things
[32:56] belong unto the Lord Our God but those
[32:59] things which were revealed belong unto
[33:01] us and to our children forever that we
[33:04] may do all the work words of this law
[33:07] amen so if it's been revealed to you
[33:09] it's yours and your children's not just
[33:11] yours but your children's amen so let's
[33:13] just bow heads in a word of prayer amen
[33:15] we've got uh Asha we're a member in
[33:17] prayer this morning and also Sister
[33:19] Barbara is not well with the bad cold if
[33:21] he ever need you to raise it before the

[34:27] your healing hand will be upon him now
[34:28] mate just leave it his body For Your

[34:50] morning oh God for your glory Lord in
[34:52] Jesus Christ's name amen
[34:55] amen you may have your seats this
[34:57] morning hallelujah amen so the secret
[34:59] things belong unto the Lord Our God but
[35:02] those things which I revealed belong
[35:03] unto us and to our children forever that
[35:06] we may do all the words of this law amen
[35:10] so if it's been revealed it belongs to
[35:12] you amen it's yours it's your personal
[35:14] property and if it's revealed to you
[35:16] amen the devil can't take it away
[35:18] doesn't matter how much he may fight you
[35:21] the the Mind battles the troubles may be
[35:23] gone in your life but it's been revealed
[35:25] to it's yours amen I'm so thankful it's
[35:28] not just yours to enjoy but it's our
[35:29] children's as well Amen to the baptism
[35:32] of the Holy Ghost is a reality in your
[35:34] in your life it belongs to them doesn't
[35:36] matter what they're doing where they may
[35:38] be going it's theirs amen because it's
[35:39] yours it means if it's yours it's theirs
[35:42] hallelujah amen if I get happy today
[35:44] well I'm just going to be happy today
[35:45] amen because I mean because the secret
[35:47] things belong to our God but when
[35:49] they're revealed they belong to us amen
[35:51] they belong to that which uh which
[35:53] they're revealed or to who they're
[35:54] revealed to now we understand that the
[35:57] that the New Testament Church is built
[36:00] upon the rock of Revelation the rock of
[36:02] who Jesus Christ is which is his word we
[36:04] know here in Matthew chapter 16 I'm not
[36:06] going to read it all but you know Jesus
[36:08] I'm just going to paraphrase it but it's
[36:10] up there if you want to read it that
[36:11] there they had a conversation Jesus and
[36:13] his disciples were talking about who do
[36:15] men say that I am and they thought he
[36:17] was a prophet or you know one of the
[36:18] prophets the Old Testament but then he
[36:20] asked who do you say that I am and this
[36:22] is always the question that God asks
[36:24] every generation who do you say this is
[36:26] when God manifests himself who do you
[36:28] say it is is it just a Ministry is it
[36:30] just a prophet is it just a church or is
[36:32] it the word himself amen manifested and
[36:35] then that's why Peter would say thou art
[36:37] the Christ the son of the Living God and
[36:39] then and then Peter would be told by the
[36:41] Lord you're blessed because man hasn't
[36:44] revealed this to you you didn't work
[36:45] this thing out you didn't say one plus
[36:47] one is two and this is what the answer
[36:49] is no but my Father which is in heaven
[36:52] has revealed this to you so now the
[36:54] secret things belong to God because
[36:56] because the Christ was revealed to Peter
[36:59] then the the Messiah was his
[37:02] Hallelujah that means if the Messiah the
[37:04] United Way is being revealed to you
[37:06] everything within him is yours amen
[37:09] every Redemptive blessing every
[37:11] Supernatural work anything he can do now
[37:13] you think about what God can do God can
[37:15] do anything God said let there be sun
[37:17] moon and stars and we're now standing on
[37:19] this planet Earth with life in our
[37:20] bodies Hallelujah he did all the details
[37:23] amen but you know he can do anything
[37:25] he's the Creator amen if he's been
[37:27] revealed to you he can do anything in
[37:29] your life amen there's nothing that can
[37:31] limit Our God and he wants to put faith
[37:33] in your life to manifest his promises
[37:35] remember he wants to fulfill his word
[37:37] more than you want it fulfilled
[37:39] Hallelujah so God wants to prove his
[37:41] word and he is proving his word and will
[37:43] prove his word amen but you see now
[37:45] Revelation gives us prevailing power
[37:47] over the gates of hell now we know the
[37:50] Gates of Hell or a gate or a door stops
[37:52] you accessing something so for example
[37:54] if Jenny locked her doors and lunch was
[37:56] there those doors will stop us getting
[37:58] fed but if we were really persistent
[38:00] enough we'd busting those doors because
[38:02] there's food behind those doors and we
[38:04] want to get fed right amens is the same
[38:06] I'm not saying Jenny's doors of the
[38:08] gates of hell but I'm using as an
[38:09] illustration right the devil will try
[38:11] and stop you possessing every Redemptive
[38:14] blessing of God Amen but it's our
[38:16] privilege to bust his doors down and get
[38:19] the promise amen because if it's been
[38:22] revealed to you that the promise is
[38:23] yours it belongs to you you will bust
[38:25] through every door in prayer you will
[38:27] not just be satisfied with whatever will
[38:29] be will be but you'll you'll lay claim
[38:31] on every promise amen because God has
[38:34] made us rugged Christians I mean we're
[38:36] not wishy-washy jellyfish kind of people
[38:38] nowhere amen when he say the promise we
[38:40] say it's mine amen and I didn't earn it
[38:43] I don't deserve it but it's been given
[38:44] unto me so it's been given to me I'm
[38:46] going to possess it I'm going to enjoy
[38:48] it I'm going to occupy it I'm going to
[38:49] kick out every squatter all unbelief
[38:52] mind battles they're gonna go
[38:54] this is what God has made us yeah we've
[38:56] got to see how we're built amen and we
[38:58] haven't built ourselves we're not our
[39:00] own we're not our own workmanship we're
[39:02] God's workmanship Hallelujah so we've
[39:05] got to really look at how God has given
[39:06] us all promises amen we're not under the
[39:09] blood of bulls and goats of just a
[39:10] covering of sin and there's no ability
[39:12] for sin nature to be changed and God can
[39:15] never dwell on the people under the
[39:17] blood of bulls and goats we're not under
[39:18] that Covenant that's being done away
[39:20] with the blood of bulls and ghosts under
[39:22] the blood of Jesus Christ amen where the
[39:24] Creator himself comes and dwells in you
[39:26] and I and he speaks his word through
[39:28] mortal lips and it comes to pass
[39:30] Hallelujah this prevailing power brother
[39:33] Graham says if I can find it there's
[39:34] nothing more powerful
[39:37] then there is nothing of such prevailing
[39:40] power as the revelation of the word so
[39:43] the powers of Hell could not Prevail
[39:45] against Revelation amen it is impossible
[39:48] for the powers of Hell to Prevail
[39:49] against Revelation now the powers of
[39:52] hell can Prevail against a mental workup
[39:55] it can Prevail against emotion but it
[39:58] cannot Prevail against Revelation
[39:59] because Revelation there is emotion
[40:02] comes with it
[40:03] it was happy when they when it was
[40:05] revealed to them the essential washed
[40:06] away with Calvary was more than the
[40:08] story it was a reality it was for you
[40:10] that made you emotional didn't it it
[40:12] made you happy amen amen when you
[40:14] realize that you pass from Death to life
[40:16] I'm sure you felt a bit happy when that
[40:18] anchored into your soul
[40:20] it wasn't just well that's neat Lord and
[40:22] walk on no you're happy about it amen
[40:24] you know where you're going nothing can
[40:26] stop you getting there I mean because
[40:27] you're sealed to the day of your
[40:28] Redemption Hallelujah so there's
[40:30] prevailing power in Revelation
[40:33] amen it helps us live above the muck and
[40:35] mire of the world Amen now we know faith
[40:38] is a revelation we understand that don't
[40:40] we we don't need to go through those
[40:42] things too much but faith is a
[40:43] revelation it's got to be revealed to
[40:45] you amens that's why we're a very
[40:47] blessed people to believe God's word the
[40:50] full Council of his word in this day
[40:52] you're blessed you're a very blessed
[40:54] person has been revealed to you if this
[40:55] if it's revealed to you this is not
[40:57] man's writings it's not just a
[41:00] translation not just nice ideas it's not
[41:02] just tradition but it is God in print
[41:04] form if that's been revealed to you're a
[41:06] blessed person
[41:08] Hallelujah
[41:10] amen but you see now in order for any
[41:13] promises being revealed to you to come
[41:16] to pass you've got to confess it
[41:18] you got to confess that it is true see
[41:20] God is looking for people just to agree
[41:22] with them basically that's really what
[41:23] it boils down with see the devil wants
[41:25] the world to agree with him God wants
[41:28] people to agree with him right how do
[41:29] you agree with God you say yes his word
[41:31] is true his word is true my thoughts are
[41:34] false compared to his word right my
[41:37] ideas are false compared to his word
[41:38] anything that's compared to us with this
[41:40] country is Wrong God is always right
[41:42] amen so that's what that that's all he's
[41:45] looking for just agree
[41:48] just say yes Lord hallelujah amen
[41:52] Hallelujah and what does that really do
[41:54] it brings a faith into our lives it
[41:57] brings the power of the word into our
[41:59] lives if we just agree see it's not a
[42:01] it's it's not about
[42:03] our condition
[42:05] see when Moses was Moses hands were
[42:08] lifted up when Joshua and the children
[42:09] of Israel were fighting the the outcome
[42:11] of the battle wasn't based on how
[42:14] skilled Joshua was with a sword it
[42:16] wasn't based on their equipment their
[42:18] formations anything that they could do
[42:19] in the battle the victory wasn't based
[42:22] on them the victors if Moses hands are
[42:24] up if Moses hands are up there winning
[42:27] of his hands went down there losing so
[42:29] they could have been outnumbering the
[42:30] enemy ten to one but if his hands went
[42:32] down they started losing
[42:33] right so it wasn't the victory wasn't
[42:35] based on them the Victor is based on
[42:37] hands raised right now our lord Jesus
[42:39] hands a race between him and Earth at
[42:41] down Calvary amen until the victory of
[42:44] Victories Was Won amen if we just keep
[42:46] looking to his hands raised we'll win in
[42:48] every battle I mean we may be fighting a
[42:50] mind battle trouble sickness complexes
[42:52] pains whatever more but if you keep your
[42:54] eyes his hands are raised I mean because
[42:56] why he is our intermediator amen he's
[42:58] our intercessor until we get raptured
[43:01] out of this world Hallelujah then he'll
[43:03] turn to the Jews and you know there's
[43:05] Grace for those we understand that but
[43:07] you see you keep looking to him in the
[43:08] battle you'll win the battle
[43:11] Hallelujah
[43:13] amen you see now there's nothing see he
[43:15] can't do nothing until he first we
[43:17] confess that he's done it
[43:19] not even he will or he can but he has
[43:22] he has done it amen that day on Calvary
[43:25] he conquered all sickness he conquered
[43:27] death he conquered all troubles anything
[43:29] that the devil can be named whatever
[43:31] label it is whatever weapon it is he
[43:33] conquered it there's nothing that is not
[43:35] conquered he has conquered amen now if
[43:38] he has conquered all things amen he has
[43:40] done that then now we confess that by
[43:42] his stripes I'm healed amen that the
[43:44] baptism the Holy Ghost was for me joy is
[43:46] for me overcoming power is is in me
[43:49] Hallelujah not a one day but an hour I
[43:52] mean remember we're not looking forward
[43:54] we're actually looking back rejoicing
[43:56] what has already happened and living in
[43:58] its benefits so you see you see Abel
[44:00] Abel when he offered the lamb he was
[44:02] looking forward by Revelation that that
[44:04] this lamb was just a symbol of the Lamb
[44:07] of God the seed of the woman that would
[44:09] come and crash the head of the seed of
[44:11] the serpent right he was looking forward
[44:13] he died in faith looking forward amen
[44:16] but we're not looking forward for the
[44:17] lamb to come we're looking back and
[44:19] seeing what he's done
[44:20] and now walking in that Victory I mean
[44:23] we're really walking in the victory
[44:24] we're walking in the shadow of the Cross
[44:26] all the way into the rapture
[44:28] Hallelujah that's what we're doing amen
[44:30] hallelujah
[44:32] amen so you got to believe he's already
[44:34] done it
[44:35] amen amen so we get down to the altar
[44:38] see you could get here down here at the
[44:40] altar and pray all night wouldn't do you
[44:42] a bit of good until you believe that he
[44:44] forgives you then you stand up
[44:47] you got to believe that he forgives you
[44:48] see it's a you know that's the most
[44:50] important thing then as much Faith as
[44:53] you have that's where see you lived once
[44:55] way down here in the muck of sin now you
[44:57] young converts now you believe you're
[44:59] saved don't you then you raise up here
[45:01] you raise a little higher what does it
[45:03] your faith because you believe you're a
[45:05] Christian now you live you'll live above
[45:07] that thing now
[45:09] but many times we say but there's all
[45:11] these other things that we need to
[45:12] overcome we get discouraged no if you're
[45:14] being raised up just a just a
[45:17] a millimeter off the ground because of
[45:19] Faith you're still off the ground you're
[45:21] not where you started you're about
[45:22] higher so keep climbing in faith taking
[45:25] God at his word and you'll find you're
[45:27] maybe a centimeter maybe a hundred mil I
[45:29] don't know but you'll be being lifted up
[45:31] above the things of the world all the
[45:32] time
[45:33] Hallelujah see your faith because now so
[45:37] you'll live above that thing now now if
[45:39] you just want to raise a little higher
[45:40] just have more faith because it's
[45:42] unlimited just keep on
[45:45] now
[45:47] we gotta look at now I was thinking
[45:49] about this today well yesterday
[45:51] everything we do in life is really
[45:53] Quantified by a speed by Distance by a
[45:57] weight by design by material you know
[45:59] everything's kind of what can it do
[46:01] what's it you know you see specs of a
[46:03] car or a plane or
[46:05] a gadget whatever
[46:08] Faith really to me hasn't really been
[46:10] Quantified because faith is unlimited
[46:13] you know sure it's been described look
[46:15] at this this is amazing who through face
[46:17] subdued kingdoms
[46:19] wrought righteousness obtain promises
[46:21] stop the mouths of lions quench the
[46:23] violence of fire escape the edge of the
[46:25] sword out of weakness were made strong
[46:27] wax Valley in and fight turn to flight
[46:30] the armies of the aliens women receive
[46:32] their dead raised to life again and
[46:34] others were tortured not accepting
[46:35] Deliverance that they might obtain a
[46:37] better resurrection and others had trial
[46:40] of cruel mockings and scourging J more
[46:42] ever of bonds and imprisonment you keep
[46:44] reading down but you see Paul is trying
[46:47] to quantify What Faith Can Do
[46:49] here but to me this is really just the
[46:51] surface of What Faith Can Do and because
[46:53] faith is Unlimited in its power
[46:57] faith is Unlimited in its potential
[47:00] we don't we don't serve a limited God
[47:02] today we serve an unlimited God we serve
[47:05] the almighty God Amen to have you see
[47:07] through faith or through Revelation they
[47:09] obtain promises they stop the mouths of
[47:11] lions they did incredible exploits but
[47:13] then if you keep reading down through
[47:15] Hebrews it says but us without us
[47:17] without them are not made perfect
[47:19] I mean so so the body's not complete
[47:21] without us coming to our position now if
[47:24] they could do these incredible things
[47:26] under the blood of bulls and goats how
[47:28] much more The People Under the blood of
[47:30] Jesus Christ where Moses under
[47:32] Revelation could Yeah Yeah by faith
[47:34] under the blood of bulls and goats could
[47:36] could raise up his staff and there would
[47:38] be oh what have I done here
[47:41] fleas and frogs and Red Sea opening and
[47:44] all these incredible things that was
[47:45] under the blood of blood of bulls and
[47:47] goats how much more now under the people
[47:49] under the blood of Jesus Christ what
[47:52] could be done this morning what could be
[47:55] done this morning not just at Camp what
[47:57] about right now because the same God at
[48:00] camp or the same God you see in special
[48:01] meetings somewhere else is the same God
[48:03] every day not just here in these four
[48:05] walls every day is the same every day
[48:07] he's Unlimited in his power every day
[48:10] he's Unlimited in his potential and his
[48:12] ability amen he is not limited in any
[48:15] way in himself
[48:16] amen but now we've got to let Faith lead
[48:19] us to all things
[48:21] amen not to be hindered by anything now
[48:24] it's going to drop this in there I'm
[48:25] going to come back to that thought of
[48:26] being unlimited now Isaiah asks a
[48:28] question
[48:29] who hath believed our report and to whom
[48:32] is the arm of the Lord revealed so he's
[48:34] actually really asking a question and a
[48:36] question and really the answer is the
[48:38] arm of the Lord is revealed to those who
[48:40] believe the report amen so the so the
[48:42] strength of God see in other words if
[48:44] you have believed our report then the
[48:46] arm of the Lord has been revealed now
[48:48] the arm of the Lord is the strength of
[48:50] the Lord there's no weak Parts in God
[48:52] he's all strong from his little toenail
[48:55] to the to his eyebrows and above every
[48:59] part of him is strong I mean there's no
[49:01] weak part in God the arm of the Lord is
[49:03] strong now there's no weak Parts in the
[49:05] body of Christ we may think we're weak
[49:06] or we're not really a strong Christian
[49:08] but brother Brown tells us the weakest
[49:10] of Christians when they get down on
[49:11] their knees to pray the kingdom of
[49:13] Health shakes amen you may think that
[49:16] your prayer doesn't even go through the
[49:17] floor or past the ceiling whatever more
[49:19] but God hears your prayer you may feel
[49:21] nothing when you pray but God hears your
[49:23] prayer amen and God begins to act on
[49:25] your behalf and you may be praying you
[49:27] may say amen and you and then of course
[49:29] the people comes and says well there's
[49:30] no point in praying that but he's got to
[49:33] rebuild hell you know it's Rubble
[49:35] everywhere there's Devils pinned under
[49:37] beams and struggling under eye beams and
[49:39] there's been a Catholic there's been a
[49:43] critical structural failure in hell
[49:45] because of your prayer Hallelujah and
[49:48] the devil says oh there's nothing
[49:49] happening with that and he's going to
[49:51] get his imps out of these rocks and
[49:52] Rubble in this you know this there's
[49:54] there's ambulances there not there's any
[49:56] healing but just an illustration that
[49:57] you know there's disaster teams and
[49:58] press conferences going on to explain
[50:00] why this all happened and he tells you
[50:03] nothing happened no something happened
[50:04] remember Prayer Changes Things Prayer
[50:07] Changes Things amen remember someone who
[50:10] just met the Lord a second ago has more
[50:12] Authority with God than the archangels
[50:14] that never fell amen so how much more
[50:16] you and I see there under the blood of
[50:17] Jesus Christ we're under the blood of
[50:19] Jesus Christ so we have a right to go
[50:21] before God this morning
[50:23] hallelujah amen remember God wants us in
[50:25] his presence he loves it when we're in
[50:28] his presence amen he enjoys it when we
[50:30] step into his presence that's what he
[50:31] Longs for he enjoys spending time with
[50:34] you we may think we're not worthy but he
[50:36] says look I've made you more than Worthy
[50:38] Hallelujah
[50:39] I mean so so so if if we have believed
[50:42] his report now how can you believe his
[50:44] report unless it's been revealed
[50:47] has it been revealed to you his word is
[50:49] true in any circumstance at any time
[50:52] doesn't matter what mind battle is going
[50:54] on in your mind right now that thing's a
[50:55] lie that thing's the devil don't listen
[50:57] to it God's word is true amen so we
[51:00] don't need to put up with the devil's
[51:02] nonsense no the arm of the Lord has been
[51:04] revealed why do you believe
[51:08] we're not going to have a mic be passing
[51:10] around but but just think about it well
[51:12] why do I believe
[51:13] well we say well one day something
[51:16] happened to me and uh I believe this it
[51:19] can be a great thing could have been a
[51:20] very simple thing it doesn't matter the
[51:22] size of it but something in you says I'm
[51:24] a Christian so again he says you want to
[51:26] serve God who did that you didn't do
[51:28] that God did that what was that that was
[51:30] the arm of the Lord being revealed to
[51:31] you Amen to now if the arm of the Lord
[51:33] is revealed to you all power in Heaven
[51:35] and Earth has been revealed to you amen
[51:37] just let Faith have his perfect work in
[51:39] your life
[51:40] Hallelujah who's happy today amen our
[51:43] God is more than able to do anything I
[51:46] don't care what it is God can do
[51:47] anything Hallelujah
[51:49] Hallelujah
[51:51] hey man if you think I'm a fanatic I'm
[51:53] real happy this way
[51:55] amen hey there's people cheering and
[51:57] shouting in soccer stadiums and all
[51:58] these different kind of things paint
[51:59] themselves all different colors turn up
[52:01] early mortgage their houses do all kind
[52:03] of crazy things just for 90 just to
[52:05] watch 90 minutes of football live
[52:08] and it's gonna pass away and it's going
[52:10] to be forgotten but what we believe is
[52:13] eternal oh Luis I think we've got
[52:15] something to be excited about
[52:17] Hallelujah Hallelujah Lord Jesus
[52:21] amen
[52:23] now
[52:25] we have something that is Unlimited in
[52:27] its power
[52:28] the word of God brother man speaks about
[52:30] it a few times in an absolute he says I
[52:33] was hearing a man speak or talk not long
[52:35] ago now I'm talking about remember the
[52:37] hidden things belong with the God but
[52:38] those things are revealed belong unto us
[52:40] amen amen amen
[52:43] and he used the word absolute I thought
[52:45] that's a very fine word I hear you so
[52:47] many times absolutely I looked up in the
[52:50] dictionary Webster according to Webster
[52:51] it's perfect in itself
[52:53] so it's perfect it doesn't need adding
[52:56] two does need apologetics it's perfect
[52:58] in itself it's Unlimited in its power
[53:02] primarily and ultimate and an ultimate
[53:05] is the amen that's all an absolute is
[53:07] the Unlimited in power the word absolute
[53:10] is perfect in itself it's all of it that
[53:12] settles it I thought that's a glorious
[53:14] thing that's a wonderful word now a word
[53:16] is a thought expressed first it must be
[53:19] thought and then it becomes a word then
[53:21] it is spoken then it's received amen so
[53:23] a word that's perfect in itself
[53:25] Unlimited in power has all potentials
[53:28] what was thought and was spoken and
[53:31] remember God is his word so God wants to
[53:33] transmit himself down into human beings
[53:36] hello that's why he uses his word amen
[53:38] it's speaking himself down into you and
[53:41] I and then it comes into us and then we
[53:43] speak it back to him and then he calls
[53:45] it to come to pass Hallelujah if you
[53:47] believe you're a Believer today amen God
[53:49] gives you power to be a believer amen if
[53:52] God believe if you confess you're an
[53:54] overcomer God will give you the power to
[53:56] be an overcomer amen why because God
[53:58] works according to our confession that's
[54:01] why never have a negative of confession
[54:03] never confess what you see what you feel
[54:05] what you hear what you imagine confess
[54:07] what the word says hey if those things
[54:09] agree with the word confess them but if
[54:11] it's contrary get rid of it amen just
[54:13] take God in his word amen hallelujah
[54:17] so it's Unlimited in its power
[54:19] now
[54:21] if something is an absolute or unlimited
[54:23] its power then it can it goes beyond all
[54:26] barriers
[54:28] it goes beyond all barriers now this was
[54:30] the first plane that uh X1 Bell I think
[54:34] it's called This is the first plane ever
[54:36] to to break through the sound barrier
[54:38] and I thought it was interesting it
[54:40] broke through the sound barrier in 1947
[54:42] October 1947. I thought isn't that
[54:45] interesting God raised up a prophet in
[54:47] the land amen that God allowed to break
[54:50] through every barrier of tradition every
[54:52] barrier of denomination every barrier of
[54:55] culture every every barrier of human
[54:57] understanding he broke through that
[54:59] sound barrier Amy the shower bride was
[55:01] going to break through every sound
[55:02] barrier amen breakthrough every barrier
[55:04] of the devil every barrier of trouble
[55:06] and insecurity or Evermore and walk with
[55:08] God hallelujah you say well that doesn't
[55:10] look like much of a plane but it was
[55:13] designed to do what it did Hallelujah
[55:16] and you may look at yourself and say I'm
[55:17] not much of a design but hey well yeah
[55:19] I'm not much of a Believer but you're
[55:21] designed to do what you'll do amen and
[55:24] God has designed you to break through
[55:26] the sound barrier amen of every
[55:27] tradition trouble Whatever It Is God has
[55:31] designed you to break through that
[55:32] barrier
[55:33] Hallelujah now so it's so important
[55:36] brother Brown says here and going beyond
[55:37] the camp amen now you know I was told
[55:40] some time ago they had a Jet Plane I
[55:41] believe it's the one we just had makes
[55:43] him noises we hear about here that
[55:45] shakes the windows it's when the plane
[55:47] has got so fast that it crosses its own
[55:49] sound called sound barrier and when it
[55:51] goes beyond its own sound barrier it's
[55:54] almost unlimited to what it'll do
[55:56] remember the word is Unlimited in its
[55:58] power but it's got to be manifested in
[56:00] human beings
[56:01] amen and I think in there that we get a
[56:04] lesson that when we go beyond our own
[56:06] sound barrier into the word of God then
[56:09] it's unlimited what God can do with a
[56:11] man that's ready to go beyond the camp
[56:13] the camp of man now we see that going
[56:16] beyond the camp going Beyond this so if
[56:20] we can go beyond our own sound barrier
[56:23] ow our own sound barrier now we have a
[56:25] sound barrier to go through amen see now
[56:28] see now remember when a plane goes to
[56:30] the sound barrier the most resistance is
[56:31] when it's about to break that barrier
[56:33] because it's just pushing against it
[56:35] it's just there's the most resistance
[56:37] when the Breakthrough is about to come
[56:39] amen and that's when the devil begins to
[56:42] pour on feelings and thoughts and
[56:43] troubles and cold feelings whatever it
[56:45] is just when someone's about to break
[56:47] through the sound barrier I think
[56:48] brother Brown's own sister said to him
[56:50] you know I feel like I'm going to get
[56:52] the Holy Ghost and a feeling comes over
[56:53] me all these things and you know and and
[56:55] he tells her that's because you're just
[56:58] about to break through I mean why
[57:00] because the most trouble is happening
[57:01] just before the sound barrier is broken
[57:03] through amen so there's the most
[57:05] resistance there so so we need to break
[57:08] the our our own sound barrier of
[57:10] reasoning
[57:12] is it really true can it really happen
[57:14] that's not your thoughts that's the
[57:16] devil's story well he did it for them
[57:17] but he won't do it for you you gotta you
[57:19] gotta get rid of that reasoning oh well
[57:21] I've seen other people say they've got
[57:23] it but they didn't have it so what's
[57:24] these are trying to get it that's reason
[57:25] get rid of the reasoning amen we've got
[57:27] to break through the barrier of our five
[57:29] senses you know I don't see Victory I
[57:32] don't feel Victory I don't hear Victory
[57:34] I don't think Victory I don't imagine
[57:35] Victory whatever break through those
[57:37] five senses I mean that's where why
[57:39] you're about to break through the sound
[57:40] barrier aiming to where all things are
[57:43] possible amen the devil telling you not
[57:45] to agree with the word that's a sound
[57:47] barrier so you've got to turn down this
[57:49] lie and accept the word of God you
[57:51] accept the word of God you can break
[57:52] through the sound barrier hallelujah
[57:55] amen telling you not to say Amen with
[57:57] the word see the devil loves to sit with
[57:58] you in church he doesn't encourage you
[58:01] he doesn't say say Amen enjoy yourself
[58:04] just relax just enjoy the atmosphere
[58:07] just just you know absorb it he doesn't
[58:10] tell you that he tells you tomorrow this
[58:12] is happening and this is happening now
[58:13] and what about this and you left this on
[58:14] the stove and what about this in your
[58:16] laundry and all these things going on
[58:17] because he doesn't want you to agree
[58:20] with the word and he'll say don't say
[58:22] Amen what will that person think of you
[58:24] what will this person do what will they
[58:27] say about you after church if you really
[58:28] break through the sound barrier and meet
[58:30] the Eternal God really we're going to
[58:32] come to a point say who cares about that
[58:34] kind of thing you know brother Brown
[58:36] says yeah that the church needs to get
[58:37] out of order long enough for someone to
[58:39] get safe
[58:40] Hallelujah so I think we should really
[58:42] just break through a few barriers I mean
[58:45] you say well yo we need healing we need
[58:47] healing in our bodies we have sick we
[58:49] have needs Among Us let's break through
[58:50] a barrier amen that God can bring a
[58:53] resurrection God can bring amen the
[58:56] supernatural in our midst amen see and
[58:59] also we're going to break through the
[59:01] barrier of wanting our own will above
[59:02] Gods that's a big barrier
[59:05] especially when it can be so spiritual
[59:07] looking
[59:08] you know because people say well I want
[59:10] to break through the barrier but I don't
[59:11] want to speak in tongues I don't want to
[59:13] dance I don't want to shout you may
[59:14] never do any of those things but you've
[59:16] got to be willing
[59:17] to do it
[59:18] amen oh Lord I want this promise to be
[59:21] answered this way we're going to be
[59:23] committed all to God whatever he wants
[59:25] however he wants it done praise God I
[59:28] want what you want for me dear Lord
[59:30] we'll sing that one day amen but but
[59:32] that's a barrier see we should come to
[59:34] God not with our minds made up of how
[59:36] things will happen but we should just
[59:38] take God at his word and say Lord you'll
[59:40] do it however I don't know you're he's
[59:42] the details guy I'm not a details guy
[59:44] you know I'm not a details guy but he's
[59:46] the he takes care of the details
[59:48] Hallelujah
[59:50] amen so we're going to come to a place
[59:52] that God is always right no matter what
[59:54] the outcome you'll break through see job
[59:57] said though he slam me yet I'll trust
[59:58] him what did he broke through a barrier
[1:00:00] he broke through the sound barrier and
[1:00:02] said I now I know my redeemer liveth
[1:00:04] amen so he broke through the barrier of
[1:00:06] the troubles going on the trials all
[1:00:08] these things he says well whatever the
[1:00:10] outcome Lord yeah I'm going to trust God
[1:00:11] anyway
[1:00:12] and he said and then he broke through
[1:00:14] that sound barrier into a place where he
[1:00:17] saw the resurrection and his place in it
[1:00:22] not just the resurrection but his place
[1:00:24] in it because he says I I know my
[1:00:25] redeemer loveth and I'll stand with him
[1:00:27] on the Earth
[1:00:28] Hallelujah
[1:00:32] Hallelujah
[1:00:34] amen Hallelujah
[1:00:36] see
[1:00:37] never let the devil diminish your faith
[1:00:41] where are people of great faith
[1:00:43] God's given you great faith
[1:00:45] you say well I don't have a lot of faith
[1:00:47] but if you have the faith of a mustard
[1:00:49] seed it doesn't you don't have to you
[1:00:51] know we don't have a gauge on how much
[1:00:53] faith we have
[1:00:55] don't worry about the tank just love the
[1:00:57] Lord he'll give you the faithful when
[1:00:59] you need it amen you'll find many times
[1:01:01] you come in life things will just happen
[1:01:03] you don't even realize how you'd react
[1:01:05] in that circumstance amen I remember
[1:01:06] when Christine and I were down in
[1:01:08] Christchurch there's that first first
[1:01:09] earthquake and we're awake and you know
[1:01:12] we got down by our front door I'm just
[1:01:13] paraphrasing very shortly but the you
[1:01:15] know the Earth wasn't just rolling it
[1:01:17] was shaking this way and this way very
[1:01:18] violently and we started praying and
[1:01:20] just God came down and we had a
[1:01:22] wonderful time in his presence while the
[1:01:23] world is shaking now if if I thought
[1:01:26] about what would I how would I handle an
[1:01:28] earthquake before that ever happened I
[1:01:30] probably would never thought that would
[1:01:31] have happened but God comes on the scene
[1:01:33] when you need him see we don't need to
[1:01:35] work out how God will do things when we
[1:01:37] get there we just trust God and he'll do
[1:01:38] it when we get there however he wants to
[1:01:40] do it that's fine
[1:01:41] I like what he does he's a god of
[1:01:44] surprises you know he's a god of his
[1:01:45] word but he loves to surprise us
[1:01:48] Amen Hallelujah by how he does things
[1:01:49] amen hallelujah cease he bit our
[1:01:52] faithful unto death he does not say be
[1:01:54] faithful and
[1:01:56] um until death but unto death you may
[1:01:58] not you may have to seal your do I have
[1:02:00] it up there still your testimony with
[1:02:01] your blood thousands yeah Millions have
[1:02:03] died during all the ages they died in
[1:02:05] the faith like antipasto faithful murder
[1:02:08] they held out
[1:02:10] but me they held they held not their
[1:02:12] lives there unto death often we think
[1:02:14] it'd be almost impossible to be a martyr
[1:02:16] who thinks that yeah
[1:02:18] yeah but dare to recall that the faith
[1:02:20] we daily use to Triumph in Christ Jesus
[1:02:23] is the same faith that upholds the
[1:02:25] polycarps and all Martyrs the Supreme
[1:02:27] faith will give Supreme Grace for the
[1:02:30] Supreme hour amen and this is the
[1:02:32] Supreme hour of the Bride of Jesus
[1:02:34] Christ amen so if this is the Supreme
[1:02:36] hour then Supreme faith will give
[1:02:38] Supreme Grace
[1:02:42] what do we need to worry about I may
[1:02:44] remember God will step on the scene God
[1:02:47] is faithful God is true he's never LED
[1:02:50] his children into a no exit place a
[1:02:53] point of no return where he is not there
[1:02:55] to help him amen he was in the fire when
[1:02:57] the three Hebrew children were in the
[1:02:59] fire amen he was there in the Lion's Den
[1:03:02] with Daniel Amen he was with the
[1:03:03] children of Israel in the wilderness
[1:03:04] through the Red Sea River God's people
[1:03:07] are because remember he's our Shepherd
[1:03:10] he goes before us Shepherds lead they
[1:03:13] don't drive so he steps into the trouble
[1:03:15] before you ever get there
[1:03:17] Hallelujah so he never leads us to a
[1:03:20] place that he is not with us in that
[1:03:22] place Hallelujah so what does that
[1:03:24] Supreme Grace for the Supreme now
[1:03:26] hallelujah our God's always on time
[1:03:30] you say well
[1:03:32] what about four days late no
[1:03:35] yeah it's amazing I you know we watched
[1:03:37] the Cloverdale play
[1:03:39] yesterday uh yeah was it yesterday
[1:03:40] whenever it was Friday and it was about
[1:03:42] Mary and Martha and Lazarus and the you
[1:03:44] know Lazarus dying and being raised from
[1:03:46] the dead but it's interesting I never
[1:03:49] put them together before but
[1:03:51] in one of the Gospel accounts Mary is
[1:03:54] the one who who anoints Jesus's feet in
[1:03:58] Simon's house
[1:03:59] so there she is she had to break through
[1:04:01] a lot of barriers
[1:04:03] Hallelujah she had to break through a
[1:04:05] lot of barriers she had to break through
[1:04:06] Simon's barrier
[1:04:08] what he will think he was a Pharisee and
[1:04:11] a lot of Pharisees there they're real
[1:04:12] judgmental kind of a people they like
[1:04:14] things to be done their way and it's
[1:04:16] their way or the highway or the byway I
[1:04:19] don't know but it's not you know so you
[1:04:21] know
[1:04:22] she wasn't invited she had to break
[1:04:23] through the barrier of that I think do I
[1:04:25] I don't think I have a picture for this
[1:04:26] anyway we'll just leave that up there so
[1:04:28] so she had to break through the barrier
[1:04:30] of not being invited she had to break
[1:04:32] through the barrier of not being welcome
[1:04:33] she had to break through the barrier of
[1:04:36] what people would say but I remember in
[1:04:38] that play there was like a lion where
[1:04:39] where where Mary's on the outside looks
[1:04:41] and sees Jesus and and and and and she's
[1:04:44] so gripped by the fact he's in the
[1:04:46] corner with unwashed feet
[1:04:47] it says they haven't washed his feet
[1:04:49] haven't made him welcome but it's Jesus
[1:04:51] and it was so griptor saying but but
[1:04:54] there is there now I can have an
[1:04:55] opportunity so because she knew he was
[1:04:58] on the other side of the barrier amen
[1:05:00] she was more than willing to go through
[1:05:02] every barrier to get to Jesus amen so so
[1:05:05] she broke through that sound barrier of
[1:05:07] what people say what people will do how
[1:05:09] people will react and say I must wash
[1:05:11] his feet amen so she ducked and it's so
[1:05:14] amazing Where She Went yo she took her
[1:05:16] money all of her money she took her best
[1:05:19] my Lord
[1:05:20] she took her best got the best ointment
[1:05:23] somehow got past the footwash flanking
[1:05:25] all those people and got to his feet and
[1:05:28] then that's when she started to cry and
[1:05:30] weep and she didn't care what she was
[1:05:32] doing and how it would affect everyone
[1:05:34] else she just had to wash his feet but
[1:05:37] she broke through the barrier and did
[1:05:38] him a service and I pray every time we
[1:05:41] have church I pray every time we pray or
[1:05:44] read our Bible we don't leave Jesus with
[1:05:47] unwashed feet in the corner amen but we
[1:05:49] lay down at his feet and washed his feet
[1:05:51] with worship and with praise and her
[1:05:54] praise filled the whole house and no one
[1:05:56] else was rejoicing but she didn't care
[1:05:59] because she got what she needed I mean
[1:06:02] she broke through the barrier Hallelujah
[1:06:05] but you see she broke through that
[1:06:06] barrier because she but she didn't
[1:06:08] realize that she would need a
[1:06:10] resurrection in her house
[1:06:12] after that
[1:06:14] Hallelujah
[1:06:15] so she broke through that barrier and it
[1:06:18] wasn't just her sins were forgiven her
[1:06:19] but then she would need her brother to
[1:06:21] be raised from the dead Hallelujah so
[1:06:23] you'll never never underestimate that
[1:06:25] every time you break through amen and
[1:06:28] get a hold of the master amen when you
[1:06:30] feel his presence come around you and
[1:06:32] you don't care you know brother Brown
[1:06:34] says she got all crying and shouting and
[1:06:36] weeping and he said you remember that
[1:06:38] time when you got into his presence the
[1:06:39] first time
[1:06:40] Holly you in a dried icon of a moment
[1:06:43] sitting on a Pew somewhere like a frog
[1:06:44] on a lily pad I mean none of you are
[1:06:46] shouting and rejoicing you got next to
[1:06:48] yourself hey because you realize you're
[1:06:50] in the presence of almighty God Amen if
[1:06:53] we could just realize that we are in the
[1:06:55] presence of almighty God this morning
[1:06:56] amen we're not here to we're not here to
[1:06:58] worship a building we're ahead of
[1:07:00] worship just a man we're not here just
[1:07:02] to have religion we're here to Worship
[1:07:04] the Lord of glory amen who made all
[1:07:06] things the creator of heavens and earth
[1:07:08] I am in The God Who redeemed us on
[1:07:10] Calvary that's the one we've come to
[1:07:11] worship amen so we realize but remember
[1:07:14] the secret things belong to God but
[1:07:17] those which I revealed belong unto us
[1:07:19] and to our children right so it was
[1:07:21] revealed to her that man is Messiah that
[1:07:24] man who's not welcome in that place is
[1:07:26] Messiah he's the Lord Of Glory he's God
[1:07:28] made flesh and because it was revealed
[1:07:30] to her I mean she could get every
[1:07:32] Redemptive blessing she had need of out
[1:07:34] of him
[1:07:35] Hallelujah and it's the same thing with
[1:07:37] you and I amen we don't need a physical
[1:07:39] body to touch amen but our faith can
[1:07:41] touch the hymn of His Garment amen we
[1:07:43] can wash his feet with tears of
[1:07:44] Thanksgiving and praise I mean anoint
[1:07:47] him to make him welcome amen and what
[1:07:48] happened then God will talk to you
[1:07:51] Hallelujah
[1:07:52] you know brother Ramsey is the one place
[1:07:54] that the reason that God is here is to
[1:07:56] release our desires to us so whatever we
[1:07:59] have need of he wants to release that
[1:08:00] desire to you and I I mean it takes
[1:08:03] Faith to touch His Garment but what does
[1:08:05] he want to do see me he wants to give us
[1:08:06] what we need more than we want to
[1:08:09] receive it
[1:08:10] we just got to open the door of our
[1:08:12] hearts and say yes Lord
[1:08:14] I accept it Lord Jesus thank you my God
[1:08:18] Hallelujah
[1:08:19] so she broke through the sound barrier
[1:08:22] and she brought a resurrection to her
[1:08:24] house because not long after that
[1:08:25] Lazarus got sick and died but then the
[1:08:27] resurrection and the life came into a
[1:08:29] house and raised him from the dead amen
[1:08:31] hallelujah
[1:08:33] amen I think that's powerful
[1:08:35] amen I think that is powerful and we've
[1:08:37] got to realize that God has not come to
[1:08:38] give us a spirit of fear
[1:08:40] but he's come to give us love
[1:08:42] see I have not come to bring fear and
[1:08:44] failure this was the angel when when
[1:08:46] Jesus came his angel came and spoke to
[1:08:48] John in Revelations 1 the Patmos vision
[1:08:50] and you know John fell down as a dead
[1:08:53] man he's saying don't fear John and John
[1:08:55] represents the bride of Christ one man
[1:08:57] is a symbol in the book he says Don't
[1:08:59] Fear John Don't Fear Little Flock all I
[1:09:02] am is you are here too all my power is
[1:09:05] yours my omnipotence is yours as I stand
[1:09:08] in your midst
[1:09:10] I believe he's present
[1:09:12] not just here but he said I'll never
[1:09:14] leave you nor forsake you amen as I
[1:09:16] stand in your midst I have not come to
[1:09:18] bring fear and failure
[1:09:20] see we've got to realize the devil has
[1:09:21] come to steal kill and destroy that's
[1:09:23] what he's come to do the devil has not
[1:09:25] come to give us overcoming power joy and
[1:09:27] speakable full of Glory right he's come
[1:09:29] to destroy God has not come to destroy
[1:09:32] he's the opposite of the devil amen he's
[1:09:34] not to bring he has not come to give you
[1:09:37] fear and failure I mean but love courage
[1:09:40] and ability amen love amen what is that
[1:09:43] the love of God she hadn't brought in
[1:09:44] our hearts by the Holy Ghost which is
[1:09:46] given unto us courage to take God in his
[1:09:48] word amen not to compromise on the word
[1:09:51] what God has said is true
[1:09:53] amen what God has said is true amen
[1:09:56] that's how it takes courage that's why
[1:09:57] Joshua said be strong and very
[1:10:00] courageous to do all that is in the word
[1:10:02] see he had to be commanded you must be
[1:10:04] strong and be courageous Joshua I am
[1:10:07] with you to take over this whole
[1:10:09] campaign Joshua I'm not just here to
[1:10:11] take over the fall of Jericho and
[1:10:12] release Rahab out of her captivity I've
[1:10:14] come your people will possess the entire
[1:10:17] Promised Land Hallelujah so we the Lord
[1:10:20] the angel of God is here that we would
[1:10:22] possess every promise
[1:10:23] every promise doesn't matter the
[1:10:26] obstacle doesn't you know I was thinking
[1:10:28] when um brother our mum was talking
[1:10:29] about footsteps of possession I was just
[1:10:31] thinking in my mind you know Joshua
[1:10:33] she's standing he's walking and then he
[1:10:36] comes to the wall of Jericho
[1:10:38] and he puts his foot on the wall of
[1:10:39] Jericho
[1:10:41] this is my wall it's coming down holy
[1:10:44] why because footsteps are possession so
[1:10:46] it doesn't matter the obstacle the devil
[1:10:48] puts in your way a fear of failure you
[1:10:51] know testimony well they're not
[1:10:52] testimonies but oh this person failed
[1:10:55] here this person did this this person
[1:10:56] did this all those things he said no I'm
[1:10:58] going to stand on that
[1:10:59] that thing's not going to stop me
[1:11:01] well my daddy my mummy my brother my
[1:11:04] sister all these excuses no but I'm
[1:11:05] going to stand here I'm going to stand
[1:11:07] on that excuse that scarecrow I'm going
[1:11:09] to possess it and I'm going to walk on
[1:11:11] Hallelujah
[1:11:13] amen says come to give us love courage
[1:11:15] and ability and that ability is for the
[1:11:16] word of God to be fulfilled in our lives
[1:11:18] and remember he's the one who gives
[1:11:20] these things I have come to give you
[1:11:22] these things not you would do it see
[1:11:24] this is not even a human courage or or a
[1:11:28] human boldness no this is a the courage
[1:11:30] of God to stand on his word as the
[1:11:33] ability of God himself to fulfill the
[1:11:36] word in our lives
[1:11:37] Hallelujah all power is given unto me
[1:11:40] and it is yours to use you speak the
[1:11:42] word and I'll perform it that is my
[1:11:44] Covenant and it can never fail
[1:11:48] Hallelujah I like that don't you
[1:11:50] amen hallelujah now
[1:11:55] if it's revealed it's yours
[1:11:57] it takes the anointing of God to reveal
[1:11:59] it so I'm just kind of maybe we're
[1:12:01] changing gear a bit BC Caleb had a
[1:12:03] different spirit with him he didn't have
[1:12:05] the spirit of a church with him he
[1:12:07] didn't have a religious spirit with them
[1:12:08] he didn't have a family spirit with him
[1:12:10] he didn't have a family strain driving
[1:12:12] his life no he had a different Spirit it
[1:12:14] was a spirit of God was upon Him amen
[1:12:16] and that's why he would just enjoy
[1:12:18] imagine that for 40 years
[1:12:20] imagining a promise he walked there he
[1:12:23] saw it it was revealed to him see the
[1:12:25] hidden things belong to God but the
[1:12:27] things that are revealed belong to us
[1:12:29] and to our children so it was revealed
[1:12:30] to Caleb no doubt it would have been you
[1:12:32] know who's ever played as a kid before
[1:12:34] the devices driving along my car your
[1:12:36] car or my house your house or you know
[1:12:39] so maybe with um Joshua would have been
[1:12:41] okay my Mountain your Mountain
[1:12:43] you know because they would have been
[1:12:44] because it's theirs they've never seen
[1:12:46] the promised land before they've only
[1:12:48] heard stories of it from Abraham Isaac
[1:12:50] and Jacob and now they're gone out of
[1:12:51] Egypt now they're going to see the
[1:12:53] promises it's not just I've heard of it
[1:12:54] now they're going to see it as the same
[1:12:56] thing you hear of God moving then you
[1:12:58] see God moving that's two very different
[1:13:00] things and but when you see a movie you
[1:13:02] realize actually that is mine amen the
[1:13:04] baptism the Holy Ghost is mine God
[1:13:06] moving in my life is mine amen so Joshua
[1:13:08] was very Caleb was very excited about it
[1:13:10] so they would have been going that's my
[1:13:12] acidic no that's my city may they sort
[1:13:14] of different because because just like
[1:13:16] my car your car you don't stay with the
[1:13:17] first car you see
[1:13:19] you know
[1:13:20] you don't okay come on you've got an
[1:13:22] eight-hour trip to Auckland you know
[1:13:23] just pull out of the driver oh that's my
[1:13:25] car that's your car
[1:13:27] you always want better right and if a
[1:13:29] lesser one comes away you just let it go
[1:13:31] you just ignore that one you know so so
[1:13:33] Joshua would have been Caleb and Josh
[1:13:34] were doing the same thing they would
[1:13:35] have seen a city they liked mine next
[1:13:38] one's mine but then when he saw his
[1:13:40] Mountain
[1:13:41] it wasn't him saying it's mine God was
[1:13:43] saying that's yours it was revealed to
[1:13:45] him see and because it was revealed to
[1:13:47] him it belonged to him though all the
[1:13:49] enemies were there the Giants and all
[1:13:51] that stuff was there God said it says so
[1:13:53] because it was revealed it belonged to
[1:13:55] him and to his children amen so he now
[1:13:58] spent 40 years in the desert not
[1:13:59] complaining
[1:14:01] not being better not questioning God why
[1:14:04] he would just have well I guess his
[1:14:06] family altar would probably be in the
[1:14:08] same we're going in children
[1:14:10] we're going to possess the land let me
[1:14:12] tell you about it again let me tell you
[1:14:14] about it again may have been different
[1:14:15] angles different ways he approached it
[1:14:17] but it would have been the same thing
[1:14:18] and your house is going to be here son
[1:14:20] and daughter you're going to live here
[1:14:21] I'm going to live here and this is how
[1:14:23] it's going to be and there would have
[1:14:24] been such an atmosphere of Faith coming
[1:14:26] to the tent
[1:14:27] workers are talking about a promise God
[1:14:29] had given it wasn't Caleb had given it
[1:14:32] it was actually God had given him the
[1:14:33] promise and when we think about all the
[1:14:35] Divine Promises of God that God has
[1:14:37] given see this is not us saying that's
[1:14:39] mine that's mine that's mine out of our
[1:14:41] human ability this is God saying this
[1:14:43] this is yours this is yours eternal life
[1:14:44] is you're the Holy Ghost is yours
[1:14:46] Miracles are yours healing's yours
[1:14:47] Deliverance is yours peace is yours Joy
[1:14:50] is yours faith is yours love is yours
[1:14:52] it's God's saying it's yours Hallelujah
[1:14:54] so Caleb would have been saying now now
[1:14:56] children
[1:14:57] maybe it's year 39 day 364. I don't know
[1:15:02] yeah but there would have been such a
[1:15:04] faith in the tent yeah yeah I don't
[1:15:06] believe they would have gotten sick of
[1:15:08] that story
[1:15:09] because it was real
[1:15:10] and it caused their faith to rise too
[1:15:12] remember they hadn't seen the land their
[1:15:14] father had seen the land but because he
[1:15:17] was under a different anointing and they
[1:15:19] agreed with what he was saying that
[1:15:20] anointing Came Upon them
[1:15:22] Hallelujah and they broke through the
[1:15:26] sound barrier of a cycle of a slave
[1:15:29] mentality
[1:15:30] remember it was a slave mentality that
[1:15:32] kept them in the wilderness it was a
[1:15:34] slave mentality that made those 10 spies
[1:15:36] say we can't take it right but Joshua
[1:15:38] and Caleb broke through that barrier
[1:15:40] because while they took God at his word
[1:15:42] you want to break through a barrier take
[1:15:45] God in his word it doesn't matter what
[1:15:47] the barrier is you take God at his word
[1:15:48] you'll break through that barrier
[1:15:50] hallelujah amen and they possessed the
[1:15:53] promised land I'm so glad for that
[1:15:55] aren't you
[1:15:56] Hallelujah no
[1:15:58] see there comes a time when we realize
[1:16:00] where God is God
[1:16:02] he's not a historical God he's not
[1:16:04] someone else's God but he's our God
[1:16:07] he's my God amen he's a personal God
[1:16:11] amen and when you realize that what
[1:16:12] happens is what he begins to reveal
[1:16:14] himself
[1:16:15] and everything he is I I'm sorry if I'm
[1:16:17] just repeating myself a lot but you've
[1:16:19] got to realize everything that God is if
[1:16:21] he's revealed himself to you then all
[1:16:24] there is is yours and your children's
[1:16:26] Hallelujah
[1:16:28] amen so shamgar got to a place
[1:16:31] where it was revealed to him that the
[1:16:34] land was his
[1:16:35] it was you think about this man he's the
[1:16:39] son of Abraham he's a circumcised
[1:16:41] believer he's living in the promised
[1:16:43] land yes so what is that he's a
[1:16:45] born-again Believer he's baptized in the
[1:16:47] Holy Ghost he's an adopted son of God
[1:16:50] placed in the body but yet he's living
[1:16:53] below his privilege the enemy comes in
[1:16:55] season after season Harvest after
[1:16:57] harvest and takes his takes his grain
[1:16:59] away
[1:17:00] and it's amazing because there's 600
[1:17:02] Philistine soldiers come to get one
[1:17:04] man's Harvest now I know I've said it
[1:17:06] before I'll say it again the devil had
[1:17:08] an idea what shamgar was uh the
[1:17:10] potential in shamgar
[1:17:12] he had an idea of what he was capable of
[1:17:14] shamgar had no idea
[1:17:16] but then there came a point in his life
[1:17:18] where he saw
[1:17:19] the Harvest was in
[1:17:21] he saw the Ragged state of his children
[1:17:23] his wife and the trouble therein and
[1:17:25] then he heard the same stomping of the
[1:17:27] same feet of the same Philistines coming
[1:17:29] down the road again and something in him
[1:17:32] said I'm sick of this I'm sick of this
[1:17:34] I'm sick of this cycle of up and down
[1:17:36] God blesses and the devil steals it from
[1:17:38] me and I have a great time in church and
[1:17:40] the devil takes it away from me I'm sick
[1:17:42] of this amen he had had enough of it
[1:17:44] amen and I believe amen we need to get a
[1:17:47] have enough of it get sick of the devil
[1:17:49] we have a right to be annoyed at the
[1:17:51] devil get angry at him see righteous
[1:17:53] Indonesia be poured out upon Satan amen
[1:17:55] do you think Esther before the king
[1:17:57] would have been it's that Wicked Man
[1:17:59] Heyman
[1:18:00] you know what is your request well you
[1:18:02] know my people are you know like real
[1:18:03] casual kind of conversation no her
[1:18:06] Oliver anger
[1:18:10] you see all that pent up
[1:18:12] my people are under a death sentence but
[1:18:15] now I have my opportunity
[1:18:16] to tell my husband to tell the king who
[1:18:20] has the power to destroy him do you
[1:18:22] think she would have said oh it's that
[1:18:23] Wicked Man Heyman no excuse it this man
[1:18:26] she would not sick of his presence she
[1:18:28] got sick of him being in the palace sick
[1:18:31] of the stench of him walking through and
[1:18:32] his arrogance he walking around he would
[1:18:34] have got sick of it and we got to get
[1:18:36] sick of the enemy get sick of his
[1:18:38] presence think of his boasts sick of his
[1:18:41] nonsense sick of his lies sick of his
[1:18:44] mind battle and say God this one's
[1:18:46] trying to destroy me and he will if he
[1:18:48] can but Lord you're my husband you're my
[1:18:51] king you're mainly the queen it's this
[1:18:53] one and then and then God I mean why
[1:18:56] because the secret things belong to God
[1:18:57] but those that's revealed who belong
[1:18:59] unto us so it was revealed to Esther
[1:19:02] that the king had the power to to
[1:19:05] destroy her enemy and give her the
[1:19:07] authority to write a new law
[1:19:10] Hallelujah hallelujah we're going to get
[1:19:13] mad at the Devil we shouldn't just put
[1:19:15] up with them
[1:19:16] he puts a foot at the door you know
[1:19:17] sometimes yeah if anyone's in this um
[1:19:20] job well God bless you but you know
[1:19:23] sometimes I feel like people come and
[1:19:25] try and sell you a new power company
[1:19:27] and then you think at the door
[1:19:29] you know and you're nice you talk to
[1:19:31] them I'll be honest 99 100 of the time I
[1:19:34] I just want to say goodbye I want to be
[1:19:37] rude I don't have time it's the time of
[1:19:39] day where meals are being cooked
[1:19:41] children are home from school there's
[1:19:43] all there's all the evening things but
[1:19:46] you kind of just yes okay not the only
[1:19:49] last time we changed power companies is
[1:19:51] because we've got a free vacuum cleaner
[1:19:52] or something you know what else is in it
[1:19:54] for me but you know sometimes I just
[1:19:57] want to goodbye
[1:19:59] I'm sick of you guys turning up
[1:20:01] someone else was here last week
[1:20:03] and I think many times we talk to the
[1:20:05] dead or allow the devil to come in the
[1:20:08] same way we put up with those kind of
[1:20:09] guys too much
[1:20:10] now if you want a good deal I'm maybe
[1:20:14] I'm just
[1:20:15] I need more I need more patient I don't
[1:20:17] know you know but hey I hear them out
[1:20:19] they talk through everything I give them
[1:20:20] the bill and we go through all those
[1:20:22] things okay but in my heart I'm like I
[1:20:24] have don't have time for this I don't
[1:20:25] care what deal you give me could be real
[1:20:27] good but you see sometimes we put up
[1:20:29] with the devil like maybe we put up with
[1:20:31] those kind of people
[1:20:33] you be polite
[1:20:35] sorry if that's a bad illustration but
[1:20:37] you know
[1:20:38] he comes in a little bit
[1:20:40] we don't get sick of him just in a
[1:20:42] little bit
[1:20:43] we allow them to come in a mild form we
[1:20:45] entertain them we entertain a mild
[1:20:48] thought and it's the devil trying to
[1:20:50] derail our whole thought life off
[1:20:52] somewhere else we don't stop him
[1:20:54] in his tracks we allow him to set up
[1:20:57] shop rearrange Furniture in our life
[1:20:59] rearrange our habits rearrange our daily
[1:21:00] schedule and then we say this is wrong
[1:21:03] well we should have said it's wrong when
[1:21:04] he put his little toe in the door and
[1:21:06] the very first very first time see
[1:21:09] shamgar had enough of it but you realize
[1:21:11] when he had enough of it and he got his
[1:21:13] Ox code he did not become a circumcised
[1:21:16] son of Abraham living in the promised
[1:21:18] land he already was those things see
[1:21:20] that Revelation did not make him what he
[1:21:23] wasn't that Revelation revealed to him
[1:21:24] what he already was amen and because we
[1:21:27] are the sons and daughters of God God
[1:21:28] gives us the Holy Ghost amen we don't
[1:21:31] become Sons and Daughters when we
[1:21:33] receive it because we are Sons we
[1:21:35] receive
[1:21:38] killed 600 Philistines and there was
[1:21:41] Liberty there and his house
[1:21:44] hallelujah what did he do he broke
[1:21:47] through the sound barrier he broke
[1:21:48] through the sound barrier of remembering
[1:21:50] every past Harvest you're no doubt the
[1:21:52] first on the Philistines came in he was
[1:21:54] upset he would have been upset every
[1:21:56] time but you know maybe he would have
[1:21:57] tried to stop them in some way and he'd
[1:21:59] probably remember the trauma of having a
[1:22:00] spear to his throat or you know his
[1:22:02] children pinned in a corner and you know
[1:22:04] the soldiers being evil and all that
[1:22:06] stuff you know there'd be that trauma of
[1:22:08] every Harvest there'd be a fear when he
[1:22:10] heard those footsteps it would have been
[1:22:11] a fear come over
[1:22:13] right
[1:22:14] but he had to break through the sound
[1:22:16] barrier of that fear he had to break
[1:22:18] through the sound barrier of what had
[1:22:19] happened in the past the past is the
[1:22:22] past you can't change the past we can
[1:22:24] change how it affects you now amen who
[1:22:26] had to break through those barriers
[1:22:27] until what he was The Ultimate Warrior
[1:22:30] it killed 600 men if there were 700 I
[1:22:33] believe he would have killed seven
[1:22:34] hundred thousand he would have down them
[1:22:35] you know but why because he broke
[1:22:37] through the sound barrier of what he
[1:22:39] thought his limitations were when he
[1:22:42] realized God had made a covenant with
[1:22:44] him
[1:22:45] if you realize God made a covenant with
[1:22:47] you you say when did he do that when he
[1:22:49] was hanging on Calvary between heavens
[1:22:51] and earth brother Brown says God was
[1:22:53] making a covenant with the families of
[1:22:54] the earth so he was making a covenant
[1:22:56] with you I'll not leave you nor forsake
[1:22:58] you you'll be the head and not the tail
[1:23:00] Satan will be under your feet amen you
[1:23:02] are here of all things you're more than
[1:23:04] a conqueror through me
[1:23:06] hey amen
[1:23:07] Hallelujah see he got sick of it so he
[1:23:10] went
[1:23:11] amen you say well
[1:23:13] but you're a Christian you don't and
[1:23:15] like like he he had no idea how to fight
[1:23:19] but you know I'm just going to read well
[1:23:21] just and any man here who's been
[1:23:23] circumcised by the spirit of God that's
[1:23:24] born again any of you people that's sick
[1:23:26] the devil's a bluff he'll rob you he'll
[1:23:28] power your cheeks he'll do anything he
[1:23:30] can but you don't have to stand for it
[1:23:32] no longer you say I'm not a preacher but
[1:23:34] you're a Christian do we have Christians
[1:23:36] here today
[1:23:37] amen he didn't say how to fight you say
[1:23:40] I don't know nothing about faith step
[1:23:41] out anyhow yes sir so take God in his
[1:23:44] word you say I've never seen it done
[1:23:46] before take God at his word you know the
[1:23:49] first ever resurrection of life
[1:23:52] was the was the widow woman that that
[1:23:56] Elijah was feeding
[1:23:58] if I can find it here
[1:24:00] that was the first account I don't have
[1:24:01] it on my notes but it was the first
[1:24:03] account of a resurrection of life
[1:24:06] it had never been done before
[1:24:08] no account in the Bible but she but you
[1:24:12] see the secret things belong to God but
[1:24:14] those that are revealed to they belong
[1:24:16] to them and to their children so it was
[1:24:18] revealed it was revealed to her the god
[1:24:20] of Elijah is the god of the Resurrection
[1:24:23] he is the he is the resurrection and the
[1:24:25] life and that's why she got him and said
[1:24:29] look my son is dead I remember remember
[1:24:32] Elijah prophesied she would have the son
[1:24:35] and then he had and then she had the Sun
[1:24:37] and then now he's gonna die and he died
[1:24:39] and then so he she so I keep saying she
[1:24:42] she had a revelation that the God and
[1:24:45] Elijah was the god of the Resurrection
[1:24:47] so the first time that someone has ever
[1:24:50] raised from the dead was in this account
[1:24:53] now in Second Kings
[1:24:55] in second king says the shunamite woman
[1:24:59] that you know built that little house
[1:25:00] for Elijah and you know your Elisha and
[1:25:02] gehazi would come when they're making
[1:25:03] the travels and stand that little lean
[1:25:05] to on the side of the house and you know
[1:25:07] Elisha's lying there one day on the bed
[1:25:08] or comfortable enjoyed a meal and you
[1:25:10] know it should be you know he begins to
[1:25:12] think how she has been so good to them
[1:25:14] and then and then and then he starts to
[1:25:16] speak to gehazi and said you know what
[1:25:19] what do you think this woman needs
[1:25:21] you know shall go talk to the king for a
[1:25:23] do something and you know but but um you
[1:25:25] know he said no but they don't have
[1:25:27] children
[1:25:28] yeah and he says they'll say the Lord
[1:25:29] she's going to have a son
[1:25:31] so now now here was a son that was
[1:25:33] prophesied to come came and then the boy
[1:25:36] grew up was out with his father in the
[1:25:38] field you know got sunstroke cried out
[1:25:41] my head my head and you know fell over
[1:25:42] and they took him into her you know into
[1:25:46] his mother
[1:25:47] but he died on her lap and then now she
[1:25:50] knew that everything that the prophet
[1:25:52] touched was blessed so she laid him on
[1:25:55] the prophet's bed but then she said now
[1:25:57] settle me a meal we're gonna go find him
[1:26:01] because it revealed to her if God can
[1:26:04] raise another son from the dead
[1:26:06] and that same God is in Elisha as he was
[1:26:09] in Elijah then that same God can raise
[1:26:12] my son from the dead but you see because
[1:26:15] it was revealed to her she had to break
[1:26:18] through the sound barrier of reasoning
[1:26:20] she had to break through the sound
[1:26:21] barrier of her own grief she had to
[1:26:24] break through the sound barrier no doubt
[1:26:25] her family is saying okay let's just
[1:26:26] bury him
[1:26:28] I'm sorry the lord gave him to you but
[1:26:30] now the law has taken him away blessed
[1:26:32] be the name of the Lord let's just go
[1:26:33] burial but she broke through the sound
[1:26:35] barrier of that because it was revealed
[1:26:37] to her
[1:26:38] that the god of the Resurrection is an
[1:26:40] Elisha and then so as soon and now as
[1:26:43] soon as the sunlight woman came to where
[1:26:45] Elisha was you know she cried he said is
[1:26:49] all well she said all is well
[1:26:51] her son was dead on the bed
[1:26:53] there's only one account now of someone
[1:26:55] being raised from the dead but she knew
[1:26:58] she could just if she just got to God
[1:27:00] not the prophet but the God and the
[1:27:02] prophet amen all would be well
[1:27:04] Hallelujah so but but Elisha didn't know
[1:27:07] what was going on you know he just he
[1:27:09] said it wasn't revealed to him yet and
[1:27:11] then as soon as she got into his
[1:27:12] presence she grabbed him by the robe you
[1:27:15] know basically made him come and raise
[1:27:17] the boy from the dead but because it was
[1:27:19] revealed to her you see if we could just
[1:27:21] realize the same God and Elijah and
[1:27:23] Elijah's and you and I the Lord Jesus
[1:27:26] Christ is present right here
[1:27:28] Hallelujah I'm just trying to find a
[1:27:31] find a place to
[1:27:33] close here
[1:27:36] amen you see these things are revealed
[1:27:39] and I trust that it's been revealed to
[1:27:42] you we don't have to back up for the
[1:27:44] devil
[1:27:45] but we're going to realize that the
[1:27:46] weapon we fight with is more than enough
[1:27:49] see the word of God conquers in every
[1:27:52] situation yeah every circumstance
[1:27:54] there's not a place that does not
[1:27:56] conquer it conquered in a furnace with
[1:27:59] the three Hebrew children it conquered
[1:28:02] in a in a whale's belly with Jonah
[1:28:05] amen because why Jonah took Jonah took
[1:28:08] God at his word because God answered
[1:28:10] Solomon's Prayer when he dedicated the
[1:28:12] temple saying if any man or woman looked
[1:28:14] towards his Temple and pray you'll hear
[1:28:16] from heaven so he looked by Faith
[1:28:17] remember he had looked he had to go
[1:28:19] beyond the barrier of the whale's belly
[1:28:21] he had to go beyond the barrier of the
[1:28:23] fact he fled from the presence of God
[1:28:25] his own the own condemnation and he had
[1:28:27] to go beyond the barrier of that many
[1:28:29] times when that condemnation hold us
[1:28:31] back go beyond the barrier of it amen
[1:28:33] he'd go beyond the barrier of that and
[1:28:34] look by face to the temple now he didn't
[1:28:36] know where it was but by faith he looked
[1:28:39] amen and so the word conquered there in
[1:28:42] the whale's belly amen the word
[1:28:44] conquered in the Lions then the word
[1:28:46] conquered with David and Goliath that
[1:28:48] was revealed to David that he could kill
[1:28:50] Goliath and so he killed it the rest of
[1:28:52] the army knew it could be done David it
[1:28:54] was revealed to it was a totally
[1:28:55] different thing amen at at conquered in
[1:28:58] Babylon with Daniel
[1:29:00] it conquered in the promised land the
[1:29:02] word conquered in Egypt with Moses amen
[1:29:04] and the word is conquered down through
[1:29:06] seven Church ages the word conquered
[1:29:08] heldith in the grave
[1:29:11] Hallelujah
[1:29:12] the word conquered in heaven when when
[1:29:14] Michael and his angels fought against
[1:29:16] Lucifer and his angels and kicked them
[1:29:18] out the word conquered but you see now
[1:29:21] the devil tries to get us think that his
[1:29:23] weapon actually has is a weapon
[1:29:26] or is actually a match for you for your
[1:29:29] weapon see this from greatest battle
[1:29:31] ever fought see his attack watch listen
[1:29:33] close and uh this closing has it his
[1:29:36] attack is what disbelieve God's word
[1:29:38] that's his attack there can you see the
[1:29:40] greatest battle was ever fought there's
[1:29:41] only two forces Satan God and what is
[1:29:44] Satan's weapon against you is to try and
[1:29:46] get you to disbelieve your weapon
[1:29:48] he disarms you now listen real close now
[1:29:51] listen if he can get you to disbelieve
[1:29:53] your weapon is equivalent if he gets you
[1:29:56] to believe that your weapon is not
[1:29:57] strong enough he has disarmed you
[1:30:01] we have to believe that our praise touch
[1:30:03] God
[1:30:04] we have to believe that his weapon is
[1:30:06] nothing our weapon conquers we have the
[1:30:09] greatest super weapon in existence the
[1:30:11] word of God it's greater than anything
[1:30:13] man can make greater than anything hell
[1:30:15] can devise
[1:30:16] is this word but you see if we think
[1:30:18] that our weapon's not strong enough see
[1:30:20] if we think see the devil doesn't
[1:30:21] actually have any power but deception
[1:30:24] he's nothing but a bluff that's all he
[1:30:26] is he has arrows but I mean he has a bow
[1:30:29] and no arrows he's nothing but a bluff
[1:30:32] but if we if we believe as Bluff then
[1:30:34] he's actually disarmed us right but if
[1:30:37] we Bluff his blood no call us Bluff
[1:30:40] thank you everyone if we call this Bluff
[1:30:42] he he's exposed amen so we're going to

[1:33:21] he doesn't say some he doesn't say most
[1:33:24] he doesn't say
[1:33:26] most and then he saved some for later to
[1:33:28] bring out against you know all
[1:33:30] all
[1:33:31] trespasses blotting out the handwriting
[1:33:34] of ordinances see we've got to realize
[1:33:35] God has dealt with everything
[1:33:37] we're going to realize is that with
[1:33:38] everything see the devil always tries to
[1:33:40] make us think yes this but not this you
[1:33:42] should have known better here but what
[1:33:43] about here you know Abraham laughed in
[1:33:46] the prince of God at the promise
[1:33:48] it wasn't just Sarah laughing Abraham
[1:33:50] laughed but God did not change his mind
[1:33:53] about him being the father of the faith
[1:33:54] God did not change his mind about well I
[1:33:56] guess I'll bring Isaac through someone
[1:33:58] else no God ordained Abraham and Sarah
[1:34:01] to bring the promised word of that day
[1:34:03] that's why in the Old Testament is all
[1:34:06] failures and trouble and problems in the
[1:34:08] believer's life
[1:34:09] and here we are we and we allow the
[1:34:12] devil to use it as a mallet and beat us
[1:34:13] on the head with it we're going to
[1:34:15] realize God has forgiven us all
[1:34:18] trespasses
[1:34:20] even last week yeah last week too
[1:34:23] Hallelujah if you confess it under the
[1:34:26] blood of Jesus Christ and then you and
[1:34:28] and then after that you bring it up
[1:34:30] before God God is looking through his
[1:34:31] record saying what are they talking
[1:34:33] about
[1:34:34] have you had someone talk to you and you
[1:34:36] just not connecting you just don't
[1:34:37] understand what they're going on about

[1:34:40] tries to remind us of our past and we
[1:34:42] and we ask for forgiveness all over
[1:34:43] again
[1:34:46] God's flicking God's doing searches he's
