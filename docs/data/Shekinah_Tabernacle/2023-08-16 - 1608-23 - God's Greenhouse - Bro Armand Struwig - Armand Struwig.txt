strengths but only through you that strengthen us Lord so tonight as we stand here we come here Lord we come expecting that you the great king of kings will come and speak to us Lord that you would Minister unto your people Lord your bride wants to hear your voice father and we respond with Lord be it unto us according to your will so Lord tonight may this service leave human control may your prayers touch the hymn of your garment Lord may we be able to intercede for the ones that love us and Lord that we love Lord Jesus and we love you more than all so we just invite you in and say Lord blessed be the name of the Lord you take over may you speak Lord and may we hear and Lord remove any thought that is of my own out of the service Lord may you alone get the preeminence in this service I pray in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ amen and amen amen while I got older today and it fits in so nicely with the service because thank you all for the wonderful requests that you've given me and that you've seen on the brothers and sisters and your family I love all of you like you're my brother or my sister and I do appreciate the Lord giving us a chance this side of the Veil to meet all you and man we're gonna have an awesome time in heaven because if it's so good here when we trapped in these pastels bodies how awesome is it going to be there amen I'm looking forward to that my brother Ben we're going to be faster again we're going to be younger my nose will be slightly smaller we're gonna have an awesome time and it's a good time it's going to be a good time but now we're gonna have to fight and every day to be above ground is going to be a fight amen so musicians thank you so much thank you brother Josh thank you all you wonderful people with great gifts let's give them a hand of applause I I honestly think sometimes we we don't realize the the great importance of these young people coming through our ranks amen amen so let's go to the book of Isaiah and we're going to go Isaiah verse um oh Isaiah chapter 54 and we go to verse 17. now I'll put this up this oh brother um it can you take me off the fallbacks if I only I thank you uh I don't like pretty cheap to myself okay so so here here's my here's what I thought about today I thought you know what I'm getting older are we all are getting older yeah and we look at the young people and they're getting older and they they're growing up and and we've got a great responsibility us as a congregation and as people of God to to nurture these young ones great responsibility amen and God has entrusted it to us so we have to we have to take this commission very seriously so I only have 20 minutes so I'm going to jump into there and then we're going to go into a time of prayer but I want to ask one thing if we may I know we've got a lot of a lot of things that we want to ask but tonight can we pray for our young people really pray for our young people you know I'm not talking about all of us we need prayer we all need we we know we've got people that's sick and we've got Asher in the hospital and we're going to pray for him and God bless you brother I hope you feel really good soon and we can feed you some chocolate and all those things there is a there is a greater attack on our children today and and the Lord said if we can put that scripture up he said there in the book of visayas he is no weapon that is formed against thee shall prosper and every tongue that shall raise against thee in judgment thou shall condemn this is the heritage of the Servants of the Lord and their righteousness is of me say of the Lord amen may the Lord just add his Blessing to the word you may be seated now I've got I've got two scriptures and that's it and then I'm just gonna just talk a little bit and then we'll go into to prayer um title today is God's Greenhouse this is this is God's Greenhouse this is we we God placed his hands and feet to nurture the gifts that's coming through our ranks you know they they as much as we all we all think we are something we we ain't really anything but but a couple of pieces of dust that God has chosen and molded and put for his purpose so so if we realize that that though you're the bride of Christ though we're very important though he esteems us highly okay where is bride where his precious gift that is that is one he paid his life for us he gave us salvation we are but servants and hands and feet to the God Almighty most high that's what we are we are servants and the thing is once we get lifted up and we try to become something we aim that's when we're gonna fall that's when we're going to fail that's when we're pushing promises that's not ready that's when we we're dealing with people or tricky situations as has come up in our our church before and we deal with it not with wisdom or with the knowledge of God but we actually deal with it out of a carnal mindset so if you know that you are nothing then God can use that nothing and do something with it so it's like this microphone is a perfect mute now if this microphone thinks it's something when I speak it's going to try to put effects on me and I'm going to sound like a martian or I'm going to sound like Mickey Mouse and all those type of guys because the microphone is adding something to my voice but see all I want to do is speak to this microphone and I just want the microphone to say what I say when I want it set so this is this is where we are as a church we've got young people roaring to go and and and draw the sword and go and attack the enemy but there is a great commission for the elders for the older people I don't want to say older because then being Smiles but I don't want to say older but there's a great commission for us as the elders to nurture that gift and challenge that gift and channel it to say hey what if you could remember gifts and callings is without repentance God gives you a gift you've got a gift amen we all got a gift okay some got the gift of the Gap and some can sell ice to a Eskimo and still charge him double the price and sell it and and other people they are very prayer warriors they've got a gift of prayer and and wisdom and discernment and they've got all these wonderful gifts in there but we as a congregation need to realize that our gifts that we have we need to be giving to the right cause and it has to be in the right place in the right time so so I want to talk about Joshua a little bit and brother Bean thank you so much for when we had the discussion about Joshua because I love Joshua and Caleb I think we are the Joshua and Caleb outfit okay we are those people okay so when they when they looked at the challenge they didn't look at the challenge they looked at it as a challenge okay they don't go oh it's a challenge they looked at I can do that yeah because God said so so I want to go through the Book of Joshua and I quickly want to jump in there so remember the the promise is every weapon formed against you shall not Prosper that's the promise so that's God saying it so you young people I want you to realize there's a great commission for you and God said now no matter what you do even if you get trouble nothing will prosper against you because my promises I'm going to keep you in this day the lady you see a church age is the most wicked Church age there is It's the final one it's all it's Satan's Satan's Eden it's his final hurray before he goes to the Lake of Fire okay so he's throwing all that he has on the Earth but guess what God's always giving you more because he says even he comes in like a flood I will raise the standard so Joshua 1. and see Year God comes and and Moses Joshua was Moses's servant so when Moses was serving Joshua was under that Great Commission he was a young man and he would see miracles happen and he would see God and I'm going to come back to it he would see a lot of things happen under the ministry of Moses so I could say it in in the words of layman's term so the kids would understand that you are a young boy or a girl under the the the fostering of brother Bane under the influence of this message okay I want you to realize because Bane preaches the word and this message but you're under being okay Ben is our our eyes and ears and stuff and he he's the he's the one that's leading his flock right now if brother Bean is in his position and we all pray for him he hears from God he comes and corrects us he talks to us we're under brother bin but like brother Bean said what if he moves away what what if God decides hey today I'm going to take that gift and I'm going to take that gift somewhere else do we all just fall apart then is that where it ends so so what if your mom and dad comes to you and says I don't believe the message anymore does that just fall apart right there is that where it stops you is that where you go okay now I climb off the bus goes if Mom and Dad doesn't believe it where's your experience so see now now here's where Joshua finds himself he's under Moses and he's busy seeing Miracles upon Miracles he sees Moses and Moses sees to him God's going to place Us in the promised land but he told me I'm gonna go there now Moses gets taken off the scene here's Joshua he's a young man young gift he believes he's strong but now he's under out of that influence now you can't tell me when God came to me and the very first address he sees now after the death of Moses the servant of the Lord it came to pass that the Lord spake unto Joshua the son of none Moses Minister saying my Moses my servant is dead so this is the first report he got from him because remember God took Moses they don't know where he is they don't know where he was buried God took him God buried him that was all God's work but see now all of a sudden the news hits him now now you think about the feet of of Joshua right there that young man say hey Joshua while you're here brother Isaac's not going to song Lead next Sunday he can't he's somewhere else it's your turn how did you feel the first time you walked behind this pulpit did you sing every song right did you eat every chord was everything going smoothly no he was nervous I promise you behind the pulpit his knees look like this but he was standing here so you couldn't see it but it was and this wasn't keeping Rhythm it was him shaking because it was a daunting task to come and stand here and now all of a sudden have to do something that someone just found natural he's naturally gifted but I can promise you now when brother Isaac the first time stepped behind the pulpit it was the same feeling correct but see we as Elders we forget sometimes that they need to make mistakes in a safe environment we forget that the Joshua and the Caleb they said yes we can song Lead but they never done it they say yes I can sing a special and they come here and they they grab the microphone and it looks like this and then they sing year and then they sing there and then that's unmuted and this is not working and and it's nerve-wracking because for them this is a big deal this is a massive deal now God came to Joshua and he says he says my servant is dead he says but I've got a promise for you every place that the soul of your foot shall tread upon I have given it unto you so every special you sing you sing it for me every sermon You Preach You Preach for me don't you worry just go I'll be with you and you could sing here and you could have had the worst thing forget the words quite oftenly he goes and he forgotes the words and he goes hold on hold on he gets the words back and says because I have to deliver the mail it's true but does he deliver the mail or does he go oh I can't anymore I had enough I quit I just want to sit down no that's not an attitude attitude is you know what once more Lord I'll try again but see now we as a congregation need to nurture that because so we the hands and feet of God so when your child fails it's good to say hey you did something wrong but if it's the only thing you see every day how do you feel the love tank how do you build their confidence so see Joshua here at the beginning of his ministry he gets the promise that everywhere you go it's yours yes it was the promise given to Moses but the Israelites murmured and the dead and Moses got angry and God said okay I'm still going to keep my word but Moses you're going to reboot yourself you're gonna you're gonna pay for that now I'm going to move on with Joshua he comes to Joshua he says Joshua this is what's going to happen to you now for Joshua this is like oh that's a lot how am I going to do it you couldn't tell me that Joshua winter says okay we're going to go to Jericho and we're going to get Jericho and then the malachites and then the Emirates and then the Canaanites and then the jebusites and oh I know there's a couple of more that's going to come uh balak is going to come to me and bail you know I'm going to have to face him sometime and God's just going to help me through it all he had nothing figured out he just knew everywhere that your foot goes it's yours where your foot goes it's yours and he goes ah that's it position and it comes before this great wall and he looks at the wall and he goes that's a big wall when he goes yep it's bigger now but it's still a wall it looks much bigger now and we're going to go 13 times around it but guess what it's mine so do you have it all figured out in this gospel today no but does it stop you walking yeah does it stop you coming to the front there's this little red line here and it sounds like this praise the Lord oh my soul praise the Lord and you're like where did my vocals go is you're nervous it's fine but I want to ask you why are you singing and if I have to sit in church as a brother and sister and look at you fail and go they didn't practice enough my attitude is wrong yeah message you know I had a brother and I'll say this because it's true I sang a special the one day and I and I walked off and it was off the service and this brother came up to me and he said to me you sound horrible like that I was like ah okay and the brother walked off and I was like oh well I sang for the Lord but I think what happened is he might have thought about something and said the words and never knew what he was saying but see that was just the enemy trying to go you can't sing is it going to stop me from singing you know I I had I had I stand a special with rubender one day no seriously and and both of us I didn't think we held any Keys man if you were looking for keys they were all over the floor okay but it bleeped people so much that a young man that age would say I want to sing for the Lord Jesus Christ and Daddy I want to sing with you when we sing isn't that what we should want for our children so now until Joshua you know what happened it was victory of the victory of the victory of the victory the incense came in the camp they said I'll send in a victory victory Victor it was great it was an awesome commission to be under it's pretty much what we feeling and ex and really experiencing in this church now I mean if you look victory victory victory victory victory victory victory victory all children am I lying and then waiting for the next round is victory victory victory can I get on the drums can I get on the Bongo can I get on the sound can I they want to take the kingdom they want to go and push the the commission so you've got two choices you can give your gift to the world or you can give it to God I don't care children and none of us do if you make a mistake here this is a safe place to make mistakes we want you to not sing right sometimes because we want to see what lies within you God want to say is there more are you willing to go once more are you willing to walk around Jericho one more time I don't understand how it's going to be maybe I sing bad again maybe The Pianist miss the key and the elite guitarist is too loud or whatever are you willing to give it another try because the reason we're here is not just to hear brother Ben preach and me preach is but to add and to come and bring something yeah because it's a service to God it is what we meant to do we mean to worship we made to worship we made to serve we're not made to be served that's not how we work Hallelujah you know nobody here comes here and says preach me happy Pastor I hope not because you'll be disappointed because it's usually those Services where God gets hold of you gives you a good Pakistan sends you back home and said I have spoken to you so I'm right on time I just want to say now we go to the end of Book of Joshua so let's go on because this is what happens Joshua 24. so now we know Joshua started and children this is your promise and I want to say something that our the brother Brandon said in a service which was very very touching to me so so here we go to the end of Joshua and just to save time you go to chapter 24. and you go read the testimony of Joshua and he sees the in the in verse if we go to verse 17 or 15 15 in the in the last part of it he says there this is how much God impacted his life okay I'm going to show you now the rest of it but I just want to say that was going to be my opening scripture but I changed it because I wanted you to know that no matter what happens no matter where you are God already made you a promise you the enemy will not defeat you he will not Prosper he will not come and pull you down and you will judge him your words will put him in his place but you need to speak them you you don't whistle to the devil and he goes back to you need to speak to him Brother Andy said to the one day and it's true you brush your teeth when does the most thoughts come and attack you when you brush your teeth because you can't tell him get behind me Satan because he always tries to attack you when you're busy you know and then he attacks you with busyness trust me I know and then once you you actually get broken off the busyness you start showing to you there's so much more you're just not looking like I'm looking and I'm going to go there and there's I-55 but here we go so look here verse 15 he says here for the last bit of a disease but as to me and my house we will serve the Lord okay so just before that just to give you a brief overview this is what his testimony says he says verse 3. it says first God took Abraham and he he took him out of out of um on the other side of the flood and he brought him through the flood okay so that's him he says Abraham from the other side of the flood and I led them through the land of Canaan multiplied his seed and gave him Isaac then he goes and he says and I gave Isaac and Jacob and Esau and I gave ESU mountsir and and to possess it but Jacob and his children went down to Egypt he says but hold on hold on so now I know he's in Egypt what did I do I came down and I and if you go to the next verse I went and collected them from Egypt and I brought them out but then the Egyptians was was and I was leading them with the cloud by day in in the in the pillar of Fire by night and then the Egyptian Army chased him and what did I do I cut them off I buried them in the Red Sea so God's saying no matter what happened I want to bring to you remembrance then you came to the Emirates and the Amorite was also an army but I defeated them for you yeah yeah okay so see who's doing the work young children it's not it's if you come and stand here and you sing a special it's the same as God saying with the fear of doing it is God so fear you got defeated oh I'm really sick yeah but you'll get healed do you listen to the trial you'll get healed oh but I didn't get healed today hold on I said you'll get healed you have to wait a bit yeah some days you you might be lying on your deathbed and you're thinking he's not going to come yeah he'll come he says don't lose the faith but see what Joshua said then he says and then Bella came and he's the king of Moab and he attacked you but guess what I defeated him as well okay then the amorites was Almighty the two kings of the amorites was right before you but guess what I send uh that what did he call that I wrote it down because it was the hornet he says I sent him and he destroyed it and you didn't even lift up a sword or a spear so who's doing the work but now I want to tell you this is the testimony of Joshua and he said if God can do this for me in every trial then he can do it for my child in every trial so I'm just going to say for me and my house we will serve the Lord but the greatest commission that Joshua would can go is you just get the footsteps going yeah and your children will walk behind you and if they don't keep walking with your footsteps because they'll come behind you because the promise is to you and your children and as many as far up as the Lord Our God shall call so so our promise is not we're going to lose them our promises they're coming but how are we handling them so so we we had a couple of trials in our church as well we all know this heavy ones big ones and I'll never forget brother Isaac once said to us way back in the day I'll never forget it he says I pray that you would treat my children like we're going to treat these people these young people because I want brothers and sisters that looks out for my children when they get to a trial or where they do something wrong that they would they have the heart of God and not judge by a carnality but actually see the way God sees them and it was very wise words and we as a young Church learned Lots through that whole experience brother cubine remember that day and it's the wisdom and the gifts that God placed in our church that nurtures our young people amen young people you're not just here to warm up you I want to shake you tonight I want to tell you something you're not a Pew warmer amen amen there is a purpose you've got a gift you can choose where you put your gift you can choose if you want to bury your gift or you want to bring it out you're going to praise God with your gift or you're going to give it to the world that's yours some people are really clever I took the other one I went to the one with I just took the one that could talk a lot I wasn't that I was like I'll take this all and then all the clever people stood in that all I was like okay but God needed a talker so I wasn't that old and I'm happy to be who I am I don't wake up in the morning and go why am I always so bubbly and why do I always have to talk too much and how many times did I go to China and back in one second and God make me that way okay and I'm happy with how I am and yes straight with China is really good okay but that's me but if I try to be something different than what God gave me to do I just need my brothers and sisters to understand as much as I'm me I'm first me to God and I'm the same me to God as the same me to you so as long as that can stay the same and you can love me the same as God loves me we should be fine and forgive me for all other times because I forgave you already because we as a Christian we're not allowed to hold grudges we're not allowed to get offended especially if it's the word of God talking to us okay so now now that's me because I'm running over time here is Isaiah 55 let's go there all of you in your Bibles so now remember we as a congregation have no right to go when somebody stuffs it up completely gets it wrong miserably full face first fails to go um we're not amen you know what you're supposed to do you're supposed to go Lord we've got a problem here one of our kids has been taken by the enemy yeah Reckless Love brother one of our sheep has gone astray no matter what he's doing astray why don't we give day before we get here and go kinda knew that yeah that's my burden for us as a church don't don't look the way of man because we are not men we don't dwell in this realm we don't operate in this realm we are just trapped in this realm for now because we are living testimony remember job was already a righteous man and God called Satan to come and try job but why because God saw him as a righteous man God knew us a righteous man the testimony and the first book of Job the very first chapter said he was a righteous man so he lived the testimony God knew his testimony and then he said Satan go and try him so all these other friends that just stated the obvious was just the guys who stated the obvious but God said now never has to be in a man like this so remember who we're dealing with every child in this church has the same waiting with God as you he's not a Granddad he's a father just remember that so Jonah Daniel a b ush Debbie I almost said sister slugs my wife [Laughter] the thing is if you really look at it as they're all going to be 18 when you're 18. when I when I grow up grow up to be 18. When I Grow down to be a tour which is actually half of 30 today okay and and we might I can't believe it when I get 13 Rebecca is going to be 13. we're both going to be 18. okay both of us going to be 18 same day she's gonna stand next to me as a young sister in Christ so why treat it now any different because she's a pipsqueak no no because he's my sister and I respect her as a sister and if she asks me something I take it the very serious waiting as a sister talking to me yes it's a child might not be all as wise as everybody think have it all together but she has just as much waiting with God as me remember that we're dealing with the children of God so here we go to to the Everlasting Covenant and and God sees thee in the book of Isaiah he says here everyone that thirsteth um that thirst of come he to the waters and he that have no money Come Ye by and eat he come and buy wine and milk without money and without price wherefore do you spend money for those things which is not bread I thought it's pretty cool we chase money and we go spend it in all the wrong places this is where you should spend your money and I'm not talking money I'm talking there's something but more far precious money and that's time okay and then he goes on he says he says how come diligently unto me that you eat ye that which is good and let you sold the light in itself in fatness okay because the word when you read this it adds substance yeah it adds substance and and when you then see someone else's this the Bible says we can be fat look at that no joking but have you read a scripture and it fooled you so much when you're in a dry trial it gave you a fresh drink of water and it gave you some marrow in your bones again and you go on little children if you feel a bit Barren and you feel a bit unloved come to me spend your money here spend your money here spend your time here you know you will not go away from this thirsty you will not go away from this hungry please I I adhere you because he says here incline your ear and come to me here and your soul shall live and it will make an ever and I will make even lost the Covenant with you even the sure miracles of David of mercies of David behold I have given him for a witness to the people remember David was how old when God started calling him so there's so much I can tell you young people that that God's heart is towards you not towards he loves us but his heart he's he's burden is everything Brother Andy would know this is the young people because you're the Joshua Caleb Commission we're now getting to the other side of Caleb after the 40 years when he wants his mouth and we want the Rapture give me my Rapture give me my rap give me my Rapture give me I need a Rapture oh yeah man I need to get out of bed and then can I have a Rapture because our bodies is longing for that change and that's just the physical side of it but remember you're the young ones that says let's get more into the Rapture they must be more they must be 10 they must be 50 they must be 40. you're the ones with the energy and the drive to go further and push the kingdom of God and there will be trials and you will in your young stage when you come into a Ministry you will have resistance because God don't want you or Satan don't want you in that Ministry he will do everything to resist you to find your place in this church and in his body he will and that's fine so if you do get resistance guess what this is the greenhouse oh Marion you made a mistake you you say David was Saul oh okay see what I mean so I had a whole sermon and and I preached a wonderful sermon and at the end of one I forgot to pray and we walked out yeah base bass guitars was playing and all of a sudden he just eats the wrong chord again and he's like uh and everybody goes song leader then he comes to the front doesn't unmute his mic he's singing and singing nobody sees it we just go do we all go or do we just go hey whatever's going on now God has it in control how many times have I been at the back of that disc and and totally against the words wrong so thank you Dalia and they all go like this [Laughter] and I'm like what oh the the song leader comes forward or David that just praying this more this evening and he's like and and you see occasionally the kids go because now all of a sudden they start experts as well you're like he's muted so what listen you know have you been in a service and and and I think brother uh David Silas priest said in the child Falls over the chair and everybody is like yeah so what a child never fell off a tree don't let it hinder you because at those moments is when God is working and something happens he's just distracting you know see if I miss the words you go praise the Lord you should know the song by the way and if you don't know the song that's the one you're gonna learn for the rest of the week so next time we miss the song you can be the song leader and you can lead us okay amen so so don't worry about these little things this this is little things it shouldn't throw the Apple card over this should encourage you to say if there's a gap at the synth and for five six seven weeks we didn't have a synth player why aren't you there because I'm scared Joshua was also scared what did he do okay if you feel you you're not the world's best preacher and brother Ben says hey can you share a Sunday youth service for us can you come and just share a message for us what do you do you can stand here and you can be scared and you can shake and you always because I like this all the time and praise the Lord and it's so fine we understand we understand but I'll rather be here trying my very best for the Lord then being out there doing my absolute best for the world yeah where do you place your gift I'm sorry I realized that so late in my life don't make the same mistake behold thou shall call a nation that no is not the nation that knew not thee shall run unto thee because of the Lord thy God and for the Holy One of Israel for we here hath glorified thee now God's talking about you there are people outside their children in your schools there are people there that's looking for God they might not always be in the economy of God according to you amen they're looking he says and they shall run unto thee amen unto thee and if you just be yourself and you're willing to share they'll come to church the Lord will deal with them and they'll go to heaven isn't that the purpose of a Christian amen amen so tonight I encourage your children if somebody asks you to pray for them pray for them if you get another sister in the church say can you sing a special with me sing a special with him yes if you go on The Bongo drops and you over bungle the bongo drums it might look at you a bit different but just keep going you showed up don't be scared to try and brothers and sisters if they do try I pray that you will encourage them because you're dealing with deity not children amen so that was my message for tonight I didn't have any thing more but I all right I love the children because you know what without you we'll grow old and will die and there will be no other generation yeah true now think about the heaviness of this if we all Shekinah loves the Lord And We Carry On To None of our children take that that that what do you what do you call Baton yeah and keep on going with that what are we doing here we're wasting our time because we want to further the kingdom of God and the promises to all of them yes and us okay so when we talk to children youth when you talk to each other when you handle each other remember this is the greenhouse we allowed to make mistakes here we encourage mistakes to be made here because the thing is if you do make a mistake then there's hands to come and guide you and say hey we could have done this better and you're like yeah let's try again I I and I'll close with this I almost had a punch up with the brother because I just didn't understand him but you know it was wrong and you know who said to me I was wrong brother Aid now I could have taken it as Deacon said but because I knew it was placed in the position and how he spoke to me wasn't out of carnality but was of this is not of the Lord and he gave me a warning I repented I made it right with my brother and we love each other till this day more than we would ever do before so if you do get corrected Church children don't take offense just take it on the chin amen keep walking amen so let's stand we're going to pray tonight there's a couple of prayer requests that was on the line I think only ashes one was only brother being was it any sister oh my Ben and Margie we're going to pray for them let's do it like this because I I put my phone on flight mode after this service can you put a pre-request on the pre-request line on the on the brothers and sisters or the truths noticeable if we made just a prayer request say pray for this one there the reason for it is it's good to name the name to our Lord he knows but it's good to remind him and if you if you really know the person you can climb into the burden yeah so so dude don't hold back with those things when people say prerequisite I'm serious prayer changes everything not some things everything so I take it very serious with somebody on a prayer request line says Hey pray for me you stop you pray for them right there because that time is when they need God that time is when they call out for arms that's when we should act as a church so so whatever you do stop that and go pray for them and then carry on with your day that's more important then the rest of the other stuff okay so so please put it but I wanted to ask you let's pray for our children tonight so children if you can all come forward and come and stand here all the children want to or not it's up to you but just come stand here our church is going to come around you we're going to pray for your protection we're gonna we're gonna pray for your guidance and we're going to commit you to the Lord once more and say hey Lord we are committed to our children to make sure that we do the hands of God and not the carnal hands of man so brothers sisters you can come close to sprint out nice and round we're going to pray for these ones and you little ones don't forget this moment it's a commitment from your mom and dad from every brother and sister here towards you as well and I'm gonna I'll tell you now what brother Branham said about the little children there was a service and in this service the service name here it is and you go listen to the service that's your homework you know I like giving homework it says the ever-present water from The Rock okay he says in that service and this is what he sees he sees today I preached a sermon and in the sermon it was all about the adults he says here but the spirit of God caught the children and brought them forward there is not one adult standing here before me today only children go listen to that service it's at the end he's praying two one five he's praying and he says Lord you have done this so we're responsibility to you is to pray for you because all brother branham's thankfulness in that whole service was you brought the children forward so God your spirit has brought them forward no man no no adult he didn't call the children he called the prayer line and the children came it's your time to come amen it's your time to to make sure that you take that next step amen God will take you all the other way and at the end of that sermon he turns the children around towards the congregation he says now you openly the kid that you're going to follow Lord Jesus Christ now follow him and that is what we need to do as a congregation so let's just bow our heads and we just pray for our children if you children go close to your parents they can lay hands on you come come in come in don't have to be at your mom and dad come nice and close pop in brother Paul just lay hands to your sister Tippy with their hands here Joshua okay come in come in man come in you guys are precious in the sight of God come come Jesus you can stand here by me okay let's just bow our heads in the word of Prayer oh gracious Heavenly Father we as a congregation tonight come to you Lord I'm just going to switch this
