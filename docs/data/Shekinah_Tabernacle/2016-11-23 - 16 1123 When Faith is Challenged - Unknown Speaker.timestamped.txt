[2:05] There was a
[2:07] small not a dispute but some of us
[2:09] thought that second line was the person
[2:12] at the center of our faith and then some
[2:15] of us thought it was the person and the
[2:17] center of our faith but they both mean
[2:18] the same thing. It's Jesus Christ which
[2:21] is the center of our life that we

[5:25] Amen. Praise the Lord. That old time
[5:28] religion. I saw a um an
[5:33] artic clip about the um channel one have
[5:36] a breakfast show. Probably don't watch
[5:39] it, but they have a breakfast show and
[5:42] they had a panel there and they were
[5:43] discussing about um what's the guy in
[5:47] South Oakland that he has the big church
[5:49] and you know he often comes out with
[5:50] he's a bit like a Yeah. Yeah. So, so he,
[5:53] so after the earthquakes, he said,
[5:54] "Look, this is God's judgment. This is
[5:56] the beginning of God's judgment because
[5:57] of the homosexuality in the
[5:59] country." Of course, that there was
[6:02] outrage that he'd even think about such
[6:03] thing. And they gathered this panel to
[6:05] to talk about it. And
[6:08] um
[6:11] the the people were one of the guys was
[6:14] saying, "Oh, that's such 16th century
[6:16] archaic thinking to we don't think like
[6:18] that anymore." But one of the sadder
[6:20] things was there was a there's a girl
[6:22] you would know who she is but she's kind
[6:23] of left the message and she was she was
[6:25] on the panel and so she was starting to
[6:27] talk about how yeah I was brought up in
[6:29] this sort of thing that thinks all that
[6:31] and talking about
[6:33] us
[6:35] but the these people are caught up in in
[6:39] just man's idea
[6:41] but God hasn't actually changed
[6:46] and whether you think it or
[6:48] Not the world is going to go on the way
[6:51] God decided that it's going to go on
[6:52] into judgment because he hasn't changed
[6:54] his mind on the situation. Sin is still
[6:56] sin regardless of what we think. And and
[6:59] these people feel they think they're
[7:01] good by going with the the thought of
[7:04] the day and dismissing it all as
[7:06] old-fashioned 16th century. And they're
[7:08] all they don't have enough courage to
[7:10] stand up for anything. So they're all
[7:11] just going with it. And and these guys
[7:14] were so weak. This one particular guy
[7:16] was so weak, he just had to say what
[7:17] would appease the listeners and all the
[7:19] people on the panel.
[7:22] But we we'll all answer for that one day
[7:26] for what we did with Jesus and what we
[7:27] did with his word. That's it's fun and
[7:30] games and means nothing now, but one day
[7:32] it will. But I'm so glad that we can
[7:34] still have that old time religion. Amen.
[7:37] It's so good. I want no other. Amen. We
[7:40] can have that. And and that's what we
[7:42] God hasn't changed. I'm the Lord and I
[7:44] change not. He hasn't changed and his
[7:47] his mind on situations has not changed.
[7:50] Amen. His first decision is the best
[7:52] decision. And he doesn't change. We
[7:55] change. God doesn't. Praise the Lord.
[7:58] Amen. Let's sing um let's just sing a
[7:59] few worship songs now. Oh, I know the
[8:02] time is near where everything that I
[8:03] hold dear will lay before the holy

[8:31] prayet on my knees will lay before the
[8:37] holy

[17:05] we? Gracious Father, how thankful we
[17:08] are, Lord, one more time. We can be
[17:09] gathered. Hallelujah. Lord, it's so good
[17:11] to see brothers and sisters of like
[17:14] precious faith. Thank you, Lord. Lord,
[17:16] that we have all things in common.
[17:17] Doesn't matter where we're from or even
[17:19] our age. Lord, if we if we've been
[17:21] baptized with your Holy Spirit, Lord,
[17:23] sealed into your kingdom, Lord. We have
[17:24] all things in common. We thank you for
[17:26] that, Lord. So glad we can look at one
[17:28] another and say, "Hello, brother. Hello,
[17:30] sister." Amen. Father, what great
[17:32] fellowship we have and love divine.
[17:34] Hallelujah. Father, we just want to give
[17:36] you praise for this. Just this moment we
[17:38] can be gathered and just pray that
[17:39] you'll just open your word to us one
[17:41] more time. Yes, Lord. Father, just
[17:43] encourage us along the way. Yes, Lord.
[17:45] And Lord, just be with us, Lord, as we
[17:47] open the pages of your Bible, Lord. We
[17:49] know anyone can open the word, but
[17:52] Father, and to even read the words. But
[17:54] it takes you, the author, to come and
[17:56] really speak what your word says. Lord,
[18:00] Lord, as you said to every age, to he
[18:01] that hath an ear, let him hear what the
[18:03] spirit says to the church. We greatly
[18:05] desire you would speak to us tonight,
[18:06] Lord. Speak to all of us, Lord,
[18:08] especially me, oh God. Lord, may you
[18:10] grant it for your glory, Lord. Be those
[18:12] who are sick among us, Lord. Who those
[18:15] who are away, be their portion, Lord, go
[18:17] over through the internet, Lord. We know
[18:18] you're not God just in these four walls.
[18:20] That's right, Lord. Church really is the
[18:22] smaller part of the walk, Lord. It's an
[18:24] individual affair, Father, between you
[18:26] and your children. We thank you for
[18:28] that, Father, to just be where your
[18:30] children are, I pray. Bless them and
[18:31] draw them closer to you. Father, I want
[18:33] to commit this time into your hands,
[18:34] Lord. I just want to get myself out of
[18:36] the way that you can do what you want
[18:38] done in this service. may grant it for
[18:39] your glory, please. In Jesus Christ's
[18:41] name we ask. Amen. Amen. God bless you,
[18:45] friends. Amen. Thank you. Amen. Praise
[18:48] the Lord. It's good to be here
[18:50] tonight. Um Amen. God bless you all. Um
[18:54] if you if you got your Bibles handy,
[18:55] let's just turn
[18:57] to I want to go to Romans
[19:00] uh chapter 10.
[19:14] Read from verse
[19:16] four. So Romans 10:4. It says, "For
[19:19] Christ is the end of the law, for
[19:20] righteousness to everyone that
[19:22] believeth. For Moses describeth the
[19:25] righteousness which is of the law, that
[19:26] the man which doeth those things shall
[19:29] live by them. But the righteousness
[19:31] which is of faith speaketh on this wise,
[19:34] say not thine heart, who shall ascend
[19:36] into heaven, that is to bring Christ
[19:37] down from above? Or who shall descend
[19:40] into the deep, that is to bring Christ
[19:41] up again from the dead? But what saith
[19:43] that the word is nigh thee, even in thy
[19:46] mouth, and in thy heart, that is the
[19:48] word of faith which we preach, that if
[19:51] thou will confess with thy mouth the
[19:53] Lord Jesus, and believe in thine heart,
[19:55] that God has raised him from the dead,
[19:56] thou shalt be saved. Amen. For with the
[19:59] heart man believeth under righteousness,
[20:00] and with the mouth confession is made
[20:02] unto salvation. For the scripture saith,
[20:05] whosoever believeth on him shall not be
[20:06] ashamed. For there is no difference
[20:08] between the Jew and the Greek, for the
[20:10] same Lord overall is rich unto them that
[20:13] call upon him. For whosoever shall call
[20:15] upon the name of the Lord shall be
[20:16] saved. How then shall we call on him in
[20:18] whom we have not believed? How shall we
[20:21] believe in him who we have not heard?
[20:23] And how shall we hear without a
[20:24] preacher? And how shall we preach except
[20:26] we be sent? has written, "How beautiful
[20:28] are the feet of them that preach the
[20:29] gospel of peace and bring glad tidings
[20:32] of good
[20:33] things." Amen. Let's just go to First
[20:39] Samuel. I want to read a couple of just
[20:42] a couple of verses. I know it's
[20:45] um very familiar piece of scripture here
[20:49] in in
[20:51] um 1st Samuel 17.
[20:58] And then
[21:00] we read from verse 24.
[21:07] This is Oh, we'll read verse 23 rather
[21:09] of of 1st Samuel 17. And as he talked
[21:11] with them, behold, there came up the
[21:14] champion, the Philistine of Gath
[21:16] Goliath, by name out of the armies of
[21:17] the Philistines, and spake according to
[21:19] the same words. And David heard them.
[21:21] And all the men of Israel when they saw
[21:23] the man fled from him and was sore
[21:25] afraid. And the men of Israel said,
[21:27] "Have ye seen this man that has come up?
[21:30] Surely to defy Israel is he come up? And
[21:33] it shall be that the man
[21:37] uh that the man who kleth him, the king
[21:39] will enrich him with great riches, and
[21:41] will give him his daughter, and make his
[21:43] father's house free in Israel." And
[21:45] David spake to the men that stood by,
[21:47] saying, "What shall be done to the man
[21:49] that kleth this Philistine and taketh
[21:51] away the reproach from Israel?" And who
[21:54] for who is this uncircumcised Philistine
[21:56] that he should defy the armies of the
[21:58] living God? And the people answered him
[22:00] after this manner, saying, "So shall it
[22:03] be done to the man that kleth him." And
[22:05] Ilab his eldest brother spake uh heard
[22:08] when he spake unto the men. And Ilab's
[22:09] anger was kindled against David. And he
[22:11] said, Why comest thou down hither? And
[22:14] with whom hast thou left those few sheep
[22:17] in the wilderness? I know thy pride and
[22:19] thy naughtiness of thine heart, for thou
[22:22] art come down, that thou mayest see the
[22:24] battle. And David said, What have I now
[22:26] done, and is there not a cause? And he
[22:30] turned from him toward another, and
[22:32] spake after the same manner, and the
[22:34] people answered him again after the
[22:36] former manner. Amen. May the Lord bless
[22:38] his word. You may be seated. Um, brother
[22:41] Andy, can you check that the that the
[22:43] hangout's still going? Cuz Mu is asking
[22:46] if it if it's if it's dropped out or
[22:47] not. I'd like to I'd like to just speak
[22:51] briefly on
[22:53] uh when
[22:55] when faith is challenged.
[22:58] You know, we we understand that
[23:02] God God anoints his children to overcome
[23:05] every obstacle.
[23:07] We've seen it. You see it all the way
[23:08] from Genesis down through to the book of
[23:10] Revelation where where the enemy lays
[23:12] out his challenge and God just happens
[23:15] to have a have a child of his in the
[23:19] right moment in the right time to hear
[23:20] the challenge. And we understand that it
[23:23] is not the the believer that is that is
[23:27] really it's not their humanity meeting
[23:30] the challenge but it is the God in them
[23:31] that meets the challenge. And we we see
[23:35] that every time, you know, we we just
[23:38] read there the illustration of of David
[23:40] and Goliath, but we understand that
[23:43] David, he wasn't just a shepherd boy,
[23:45] even though he looked like a shepherd
[23:47] boy. He wasn't just the youngest boy in
[23:50] the family, though he was those things.
[23:52] He was anointed king over Israel. He was
[23:55] made to be king. You know, God told
[23:57] Samuel, "I have a king in Jesse's
[24:00] house." Amen. And Samuel was led down to
[24:03] Jesse's house because David was there.
[24:05] David didn't know he was king, but in
[24:07] him was to be the king. In him would
[24:09] become he had become a man that God
[24:12] would attribute Christ as the son of
[24:14] David. You know, and God would say this
[24:16] is a man after my own heart. And but you
[24:19] see David, you know, David's life was
[24:21] full of challenge. Amen. But he faith
[24:25] was there that whenever the challenge
[24:27] came his way that faith rose to the
[24:29] battlefront and however it manifested
[24:31] the conclusion was the enemy was
[24:33] defeated. Amen. Amen. Even if it was a
[24:36] bear or a lion, you know, I've seen I've
[24:38] seen hunting videos of of men in in in
[24:41] Africa with these big cannons and they
[24:43] try and hunt down these lions and and
[24:45] there's about four or five of them with
[24:46] these big guns and this lion's many
[24:48] times a lion nearly takes out one of
[24:50] them charging at them. And David was
[24:52] lions back then are the lions today.
[24:55] Same same animal. And but here was a
[24:58] here was a little boy with a slingshot
[25:00] and a little knife and a staff. And and
[25:03] whenever that you know that lion came in
[25:05] to try to take one of the sheep, you
[25:07] know, God anointed David and that lion
[25:10] was dead and David was alive. And then a
[25:13] bigger challenge came his way which was
[25:14] a bear. And the conclusion was the same.
[25:17] And so David, David in his in his in his
[25:20] youth there, he had a revelation that it
[25:23] didn't matter what came against him,
[25:24] it'll be defeated. And that's why he
[25:27] would go to King Saul and he said to
[25:29] King Saul, "God delivered a lion into my
[25:31] hands. He delivered a bear into my
[25:33] hands. This uncircumcised Philistine
[25:35] will be exactly like them." So he put
[25:38] all the enemies on the same category,
[25:41] the same. It didn't matter what they
[25:42] looked like. He knew that God, the God
[25:45] that that that was in him or with him
[25:48] could overcome every obstacle.
[25:50] Hallelujah. And that was the same way
[25:52] all the way down from there till when he
[25:54] died and he passed the kingship over to
[25:56] Solomon. Every enemy that came against
[25:58] him ended up the same way. Amen. Right?
[26:00] Because faith was challenged. It wasn't
[26:03] David being challenged. It was his faith
[26:05] being challenged. And because you got to
[26:07] go because we must understand that that
[26:09] real
[26:10] faith faith that the Bible speaks about
[26:13] is not human faith. It is a revealed
[26:17] faith. And a revealed faith is a you
[26:21] know what the conclusion is going to be.
[26:22] That's right. You may not know how it's
[26:24] going to be, but you know it's going to
[26:26] be. But human faith is is actually
[26:28] really I hope it's all going to be all
[26:30] right. You know, brother Brown preaching
[26:32] a sermon, the works is works as faith
[26:34] expressed. He said about the rest of the
[26:36] soldiers there, you know, that heard
[26:38] Goliath's challenge, he said they knew
[26:41] it could be done. They knew it could be
[26:43] done mentally, but David knew it could
[26:46] be done in his heart. Amen. And and it
[26:48] was actually the challenge of the enemy
[26:50] that really anointed David's faith to to
[26:53] to overcome that enemy. Amen. It wasn't
[26:56] his own ability. It was the devil's it
[26:58] was Goliath's boast at David which
[27:00] really brought David, the David out of
[27:03] David. Hallelujah. Amen. It really
[27:05] brought the champion of Israel to the
[27:06] forefront. And it's the same thing even
[27:09] today is that that whenever the enemy
[27:11] comes in like a flood, the scripture
[27:13] tells us the Lord will raise up a
[27:15] standard. And we know that that standard
[27:18] is not a flag waved in the air or some
[27:21] kind of billboard, but it is the
[27:23] anointing of God coming upon his
[27:25] children. And whatever the enemy is, the
[27:28] anointing of God that's in the believer
[27:30] is more than able to overcome. Amen.
[27:32] Hallelujah. We understand it may be a
[27:34] split second, you know, just like the,
[27:36] you know, the battle between David and
[27:38] Goliath was over before it even started.
[27:41] But sometimes, you know, sometimes the
[27:43] battle can go for years like Joshua
[27:45] placing the people in the land. It was
[27:47] more than just a month. It was about
[27:49] four odd years of campaigning and and
[27:51] being led, being sensitive as God moved
[27:54] and, you know, following the leadership
[27:55] of the Holy Spirit. But the outcome was
[27:57] the same. Thank you, Lord. Joshua's
[27:59] commission was fulfilled in his life and
[28:02] it was the not the natural ability of
[28:04] Israel that gave them the land. Remember
[28:06] God said that they were greater and
[28:08] mightier nations than them. And it was
[28:11] it was them walking according to the
[28:13] word gave them the victory. Amen. And
[28:17] brother Brandham tells us he says he
[28:20] says the Bible is the road map to God's
[28:22] power. Amen. Amen. If you take God at
[28:26] his word in faith, you have access to
[28:29] the power of God. Amen. Amen. Amen. So,
[28:33] it's like healing. The reason that
[28:34] healing works is not just because by his
[28:37] stripes, we were healed, but because we
[28:40] take God at his word and we have faith
[28:42] in something that has been tested, tried
[28:44] and true, and God meets us according to
[28:46] our faith and people get healed. Or
[28:49] salvation or deliverance or whatever it
[28:51] may be. You take God at his word and he
[28:53] will perform according to his word
[28:56] because God God is his word. That's
[28:59] right. Amen. And so
[29:02] now when faith is
[29:04] challenged, the believer always steps to
[29:07] the occasion. And you got to remember
[29:09] that it doesn't matter what you may be
[29:12] facing. Abraham faced 25 years. That's
[29:15] right. and he had to bear the reproach
[29:17] and he had to separate from his family
[29:19] and he had to do a lot of incredible,
[29:21] you know, he had to move to a place he
[29:23] never heard about before and and and he
[29:25] even allowed Lot to take the better
[29:27] place of the land and he and he and he
[29:28] went to the worst place of the land and
[29:30] he had to wait in that kind of
[29:31] condition. But he kept his eyes on the
[29:34] promise. Hallelujah. Just like David,
[29:36] David knew he was anointed king. Yeah,
[29:38] that's right. He knew that God was going
[29:40] to place him on the throne. And so his
[29:42] whole life was conducted with that
[29:44] confidence. that what God said he would
[29:46] do was going to happen. He wasn't like
[29:49] Saul. Saul was anointed by the same
[29:51] prophet with no doubt the same same oil
[29:54] that would have been made according to
[29:55] the word because they had a way of
[29:56] making anointing oil. But they but Saul
[29:59] governed his whole kingship by fear. The
[30:01] first battle he called Israel too. He
[30:03] took a was it a bullock or a calf and he
[30:05] and he separated to the pieces and he
[30:07] sent it to the four corners of Israel
[30:09] and said you'll be like this if you
[30:11] don't come and and fear gripped the
[30:13] people and they came and they fought and
[30:15] they and they won the victory but he all
[30:17] he you know it was fear was his how he
[30:20] controlled the people and he was afraid
[30:23] you know he was afraid of of David when
[30:26] they begin to sing you know Saul's
[30:28] killed killed thousands but David 10
[30:30] thousands and you know he was operating
[30:32] through fear But you see, David wasn't
[30:34] that way. You see it with, you know,
[30:37] David knew, David knew that Saul had
[30:40] been anointed king. And even though
[30:41] David basically God had already rejected
[30:45] Saul, he said to Samuel, "Why are you so
[30:47] sad? Go house. I have a king there." You
[30:50] know, how long are you going to weep
[30:51] over Saul? And so David knew he had been
[30:54] made king, but he knew at the right time
[30:56] Saul would be taken out of the way.
[30:58] Yeah. And he even he even had the
[31:01] opportunity, we know, twice, to kill
[31:03] Saul, right? But I believe the reason
[31:06] that that um so but David knew that even
[31:11] though he could have done it, he knew
[31:12] God would do it at the right time. And I
[31:14] believe he because he had a servant with
[31:16] him on both occasions and he was trying
[31:19] to I believe teach that servant a
[31:21] valuable lesson. Yes. That whatever God
[31:24] has put in place in the right season,
[31:26] God will take it away. Yes. and that you
[31:28] don't need to actually lay your hand
[31:29] against it. God will do it. Amen. Thank
[31:32] you, Lord. You have to have confidence
[31:34] because David, remember Solomon, why did
[31:38] Solomon Solom well, especially Solomon's
[31:41] son, why did he fail and lose most of
[31:44] the kingdom? Because he didn't have the
[31:46] character. He wasn't in the wilderness
[31:48] like David. He wasn't on the run like
[31:50] David. He didn't have to depend upon God
[31:52] like David did because here he was, he
[31:54] had a great empire. He had a big ivory u
[31:57] throne and all the you know incredible
[31:59] things he had he didn't have the
[32:00] character. That's right. But David, God
[32:03] molded David in such a way. You know,
[32:05] brother Bram says these great deserts of
[32:07] experience where men are molded into
[32:09] saints. He says, "How we thank the thee
[32:11] for them, oh Lord." And you can see it
[32:13] all the way through the Bible. Moses was
[32:15] molded that way. You know, Joshua was
[32:18] molded that way, too. He was a slave in
[32:19] Egypt. He didn't have it easy. No. And
[32:21] he was there in the wilderness and he
[32:23] was there with Moses. He was his
[32:24] minister, you know, following him and
[32:26] all these things. And but he he prepared
[32:28] him in such a way. And it's so vital
[32:32] that we do not make the mistakes of
[32:36] those generations that didn't have the
[32:38] character, right? Because real
[32:42] character. You say, "Well, I don't know
[32:43] if I'm there." Just depend upon God.
[32:46] Amen. That's right. Amen. Do not depend
[32:48] upon the arm of flesh. Do not lean upon
[32:50] the arm of flesh. Depend upon God. Yes.
[32:53] Because David just depended upon God for
[32:54] his whole journey to the throne. And
[32:57] even when he neglected his father
[32:59] fatherhood duties over his sons and his
[33:02] family, you know, with Abselon, all
[33:03] those things that happened because he
[33:06] was he was still God's anointed king, he
[33:09] actually and even though he pretty much
[33:11] shunned his responsibility, you know,
[33:12] ran away as a fugitive, God took care of
[33:14] Abselon.
[33:16] Amen. And then he's back on the throne
[33:19] again.
[33:21] But it's when faith When when faith is
[33:23] challenged.
[33:25] Amen. That's right.
[33:27] Moses Moses before the burning bush had
[33:31] intellectual faith. His mother told him
[33:33] he was the deliverer. He believed he was
[33:36] the man for the job. And that's why
[33:38] that's why he killed the Egyptian. And
[33:40] he, you know, and then the next day, you
[33:41] know, two of his Hebrew brothers were
[33:43] fighting. He says, "Why are you
[33:44] fighting?" He's trying to he said, "You
[33:46] going to kill us like the Egyptian
[33:47] soldier?" And he and he tried to do that
[33:50] cuz he because he was trained as a
[33:51] military man. and his race in the
[33:52] palace. Those days the generals of the
[33:54] army were the princes and the kings. And
[33:56] so he but so he knew now maybe this is
[33:58] the season for me to you know deliver my
[34:01] people. But it was an intellectual
[34:03] understanding. But then God had to strip
[34:06] all that out of him for 40 years in the
[34:07] wilderness. And then finally there in
[34:10] the presence of the burning bush he knew
[34:11] more about God than he did that whole 80
[34:13] years of his life. And he went and he
[34:16] didn't have an army. He was 80 years
[34:18] old. He didn't have physical strength,
[34:20] but he went through customs there in
[34:22] Egypt. They said, "What's the purpose of
[34:23] your visit?" He filled out the card to
[34:25] take over and he hands it in, gets his
[34:27] passport stamp. And the thing is, he did
[34:29] it. Hallelujah. Here's a man with an old
[34:32] stick, you know, you know, young and you
[34:33] know, with his wife on the donkey going
[34:35] through customs and he took over, you
[34:37] know, he invaded and he and his mission
[34:39] was accomplished. Amen. Because before
[34:42] he knew it could be done, but the
[34:44] burning bush he knew it could be done.
[34:46] Hallelujah. Amen. And then when the And
[34:49] then when Pharaoh's heart was being
[34:50] hardened, says, "We'll not let your
[34:52] people go and put the burden in the
[34:54] greater away upon him." Faith rose to
[34:56] the occasion. Amen. And then so so Moses
[34:59] just well, God through Moses just kept
[35:01] plaguing Egypt and plaguing Egypt and
[35:04] putting pressure on, putting pressure
[35:06] on. Then eventually Pharaoh just had to
[35:07] let them go, right? Amen. Amen. You have
[35:11] to be the same way. Yes, sir. If you
[35:14] know it's going to be done. Amen. Yeah.
[35:17] You're looking at me. If you know it's
[35:19] going to be done, you can put pressure
[35:21] on. Keep praying. Keep lifting before
[35:24] God. God will stir the nest. God will
[35:27] fight your battle. God will make it
[35:28] terrible for the opposition. We don't
[35:30] wrestle against flesh and blood. We
[35:32] understand that. But but you know what I
[35:34] mean. And then eventually the devil has
[35:35] to give it just just give up.
[35:37] Hallelujah. G. Amen. Because remember
[35:40] Moses Moses as a type was the serpent
[35:44] bruiser that was prophesied in Eden.
[35:47] Amen. Amen. In type he was the
[35:49] deliverer. And and the reason that he
[35:51] had that stick and I know I've said it
[35:53] many times but I trust it sinks in a
[35:54] little bit deeper. Remember the the the
[35:57] the thing on the Pharaoh's crown? There
[35:59] was there's like two cobras on his
[36:01] crown. And so the king cobra was the
[36:03] emblem of Egypt of the pharaoh. Then say
[36:06] here comes Moses with a staff. He says,
[36:08] "Let my people go." Oh, Aaron's got the
[36:10] staff. He says, "Throw it down." Because
[36:11] remember, God Moses was God to the
[36:13] people and Aaron was his prophet. So, he
[36:15] said, "Throw the throw the staff down."
[36:17] He throws it down, turns into a snake. I
[36:19] believe was a cobra. This is just me.
[36:20] And then the magicians say, "Well, we
[36:22] can do that, too." They throw their
[36:23] staffs down, they turn into snakes, and
[36:26] then Moses' rod eats the others. And
[36:29] then, and he just picks them up. Picks
[36:31] them up by the tail. And now it's a
[36:32] staff again. Amen. What's God telling
[36:35] What's Moses telling Satan? Yeah. cuz it
[36:37] wasn't remember normal normal man would
[36:40] you know man in his right mind is
[36:42] actually reasonable
[36:44] really but Satan gets in there and he
[36:48] wants to dominate he wants to crush he
[36:51] wants to keep things under control and
[36:54] it was really Satan in in Pharaoh
[36:57] causing his heart to be hardened but
[36:59] Moses was really declaring God was
[37:02] declaring I can loose you I can bind you
[37:06] I can loose you. I can bind you. I can
[37:08] loose you. I can bind you. I can do what
[37:10] I want when I want. That's right.
[37:12] Hallelujah. Amen. Amen. Now, hallelujah.
[37:16] You have to remember that was in shadow
[37:18] under the blood of bulls and goats. You
[37:20] know, Brother Bram said about, you know,
[37:21] all the plagues and everything. He said,
[37:22] "Now, if that was done under the blood
[37:24] of bulls and goats, how much more are
[37:25] people by the blood of Jesus Christ?"
[37:27] Hallelujah. He says, "Now we'd really
[37:28] have a sermon. Thank you, Lord." Amen.
[37:30] If that's just under a shadow, how much
[37:32] more a reality? That's right. Amen. And
[37:34] then so so our Lord Jesus he was he was
[37:37] the reality of the serpent bruiser the
[37:39] seed of the woman or bruise the head of
[37:41] the seed of the serpent says in says in
[37:43] Genesis there the first promise to the
[37:45] devil and to Adam's fallen race and
[37:48] there he was and he had dominion over
[37:51] nature had dominion over death over
[37:53] sickness hell death and the grave
[37:55] hallelujah he conquered everything he
[37:58] says you have the power to loose and the
[38:00] power to bind to Peter he said what you
[38:02] bind on earth shall be bound in heaven.
[38:04] What you'll loose on earth shall be
[38:05] loosed in heaven. That's right.
[38:07] Hallelujah. And that wasn't just to the
[38:08] apostles. It's to the believer. Because
[38:10] you got to understand that Christ and
[38:13] his bride are one. So everything the
[38:15] husband is, the woman becomes, the wife
[38:17] becomes by his grace. So if he was a
[38:20] serpent bruiser, she's a serpent
[38:21] bruiser. Amen. Amen. If he has dominion
[38:24] over Satan, she sure does have dominion
[38:26] over Satan. Amen. Hallelujah. So we are
[38:29] a generation of serpent bruisers. Amen.
[38:32] You've got to understand that the now
[38:34] this is not up here somewhere. Amen. You
[38:36] can pray in such a way that God comes
[38:39] upon the scene. That's why I say never
[38:41] give up. Never surrender. That's right.
[38:43] Amen. Just keep lifting it before the
[38:45] Lord. Because if you know, you know, you
[38:47] see in your see in the scripture it says
[38:50] th and thy seed will be there. Promise
[38:52] of the Old Testament. Amen. Amen.
[38:55] Husband and wife are made one flesh.
[38:57] Thank you, Lord. Oh, my husband's gone
[38:59] off somewhere or the, you know, he's not
[39:00] on the same page spiritually as me. It's
[39:02] a promise in the word. Amen. If Abraham
[39:06] can claim, if Abraham can claim his
[39:08] nephew, not even a like close brother,
[39:10] close blood relative, how much more when
[39:13] you claim your family, right?
[39:15] Hallelujah. Is that right? He went after
[39:18] his nephew under the blood of bulls and
[39:21] goats with a natural army. And he was
[39:23] the father of the faith. We're the
[39:25] children of the faith. I believe it.
[39:27] Amen. Amen. Amen. So, we have a right,
[39:30] you know, if it's in the word, if the
[39:31] promise is in the word, take God at his
[39:33] word. Amen. You say, "I've never seen it
[39:35] done before, but it's in the word."
[39:37] Amen. Amen. Why did you know, you know,
[39:40] just like my precious wife never seen
[39:42] anyone? I mean, you never seen speaking
[39:44] in tongues before. So, you heard what
[39:46] God did 20 odd years ago. You know, I
[39:49] want to see God alive today. What
[39:50] happened? God was alive today. Amen. Saw
[39:53] the power of God move. Saw the pillar of
[39:55] fire in in meetings and so on. changed
[39:57] your life. Amen. Why? Cuz it's in the
[39:59] scripture. That's right. And he's the
[40:00] same yesterday, today, and forever.
[40:04] Amen. Oh, amen. Hallelujah. Amen. Amen.
[40:09] So, if it's in here, you say, "Lord,
[40:11] give me faith that it's not I know it's
[40:13] cool or I know it's right. I know it's
[40:16] right." Amen. Amen. When faith is
[40:19] challenged. So Moses Moses overcame the
[40:22] challenge, you know, of his day when he
[40:25] walked according to the spirit of God in
[40:27] him. And you can take that all the way
[40:30] down through the
[40:31] scripture where when the enemy comes and
[40:34] like a flood, I'll raise up a standard.
[40:38] We have the
[40:41] right We have the right
[40:43] friends to take God at his word. You got
[40:46] to understand it's faith is
[40:48] subconscious. Faith is not a conscious
[40:50] thing. Faith is not something you got to
[40:52] work out. It just lives.
[40:55] But the enemy tries to bring us down to
[40:57] a natural level.
[41:00] Why do you think there's so much, you
[41:01] know, you see you're like brother Barmy,
[41:04] you know, he gives a story. Remember
[41:05] brother Brown before he became a
[41:07] Christian was a boxer. He's a
[41:09] professional boxer. Then you know that
[41:11] meeting in Oregon where that big massive
[41:14] guy, demonpossessed guy comes up on the
[41:16] platform and he already punched out a
[41:18] few preachers before that and he says to
[41:20] him, "I'll tear you limb from limb,
[41:22] right?" And he spits on his face and
[41:24] does all the, you know, curses him and
[41:26] all these different things cuz he's
[41:27] trying to get him back into a natural
[41:30] level cuz he's a boxer. He's trained.
[41:34] But what happened was, but he didn't
[41:38] allow himself to get dragged down into
[41:39] that level. And he said, "Because you've
[41:42] challenged the spirit of God, you'll
[41:43] fall down at my feet." Then the man
[41:46] said, "I'll show you who's who's going
[41:47] to fall over whose feet and went to go
[41:49] sock one. He fell over and he fell down
[41:50] at his feet." And the police had to drag
[41:52] him off. He was, you know, he was up um
[41:55] unconscious
[41:57] because he didn't allow himself. And
[41:58] that and that's why the enemy tries to
[42:00] get into your face and get abusive and
[42:02] get aggressive and get emotional about
[42:04] things. Yeah. Why is that? Because he's
[42:06] trying to drag you down to his level.
[42:08] Because if you walk according to the
[42:09] flesh, then then the Lord cannot
[42:13] operate. That's right. But if you can
[42:15] stay in a spiritual realm, Amen. Amen.
[42:17] Just keep praying in your heart and know
[42:19] this is not that person talking to you.
[42:22] This is the enemy talking to you. And if
[42:24] you can identify it in such a way, then
[42:26] you can really say, well, this person is
[42:28] just a prisoner to that spirit.
[42:30] Amen. And then you can really help them.
[42:36] We have the right. We have, as I said,
[42:39] faith faith is a subconscious thing.
[42:42] David didn't have to work out if he
[42:44] could beat Goliath. He knew it could be
[42:45] done. Amen. When he heard the the the
[42:48] challenge come out of his lips,
[42:49] something just happened to him, saying,
[42:50] "I'm going to kill this guy, right? I'm
[42:52] going to deal with this man. And that's
[42:55] exactly what happened.
[42:57] Caleb and Joshua were like the rest of
[42:59] the slaves that came out of Egypt. They
[43:01] knew what it was like to be beaten. They
[43:03] knew what it was like to work from dust
[43:04] till dawn or dawn till dusk, whichever
[43:06] one. I don't know if they did night
[43:07] shift in those days. But you know, they
[43:10] he knew what it was like. But when the
[43:13] word of God came through Moses,
[43:16] something happened in them saying, "I
[43:18] have a land." Hallelujah. I have an
[43:20] inheritance in this land. I'm going to
[43:22] we're going to the promised land. I'm
[43:23] going to be in my inheritance. I'm going
[43:25] to enjoy my inheritance. What was
[43:27] promised to Abraham that that we're
[43:28] going to go into our inheritance again
[43:30] after 400 years. We're going to be in
[43:32] that land and something and it wasn't
[43:34] just we think it can be done. It was a
[43:36] yes, I know it can be done because when
[43:38] the trial of everyone's faith came into
[43:40] being. See, they never really doubted
[43:42] when when Moses was doing everything.
[43:45] But then they came to Kadesh Bar and the
[43:47] spies went out. Caleb and Joshua were
[43:49] two of those spies and they just would
[43:51] no doubt they would have enjoyed going
[43:53] up and down the land. I wonder if I'm
[43:55] going to have my house there and I like
[43:57] a bit of a rolling hill. I'm going to,
[43:58] you know, you know, they would have, oh,
[43:59] I want this vineyard. And Caleb would
[44:01] have said, I I want this mountain. Amen.
[44:04] There's giants on it, but we don't care
[44:05] about the giants. It's my land.
[44:08] Hallelujah. Amen. But the other the
[44:10] other spies saw the same land. They saw
[44:14] the same enemies. They saw the same
[44:16] cities, but they brought back an evil
[44:17] report. Why? Because they knew it could
[44:20] be done, but they didn't knew it know it
[44:22] could be done. Caleb and Joshua knew it
[44:25] could be done in here. So, they knew it
[44:27] was already theirs. They just had to go
[44:28] get it. That's right. Hallelujah. Amen.
[44:31] And so, you see, Caleb Caleb never had a
[44:35] didn't have a ministry like Joshua.
[44:37] There's no record of any supernatural
[44:39] thing happening to him in that way, like
[44:42] a visitation of the angel of the Lord or
[44:43] anything. But he had the same faith
[44:46] Joshua had. He's just a different part
[44:48] of the body. And he said, "It's for me.
[44:50] I want my mountain." And that mountain
[44:52] was a resurrection mountain. If you go
[44:54] look in the scripture, hallelujah. So he
[44:56] it was revealed to him, faith came to
[44:59] the forefront. He says, "Give me my
[45:00] mountain." Amen. Yeah. No doubt. No
[45:02] doubt. When he saw those giants because
[45:04] I don't know if you've ever experienced,
[45:06] but when the enemy comes in, something
[45:08] just happens to the believer. Amen. And
[45:11] you know the enemy is going to going to
[45:13] go down. Yes, it may not be today or
[45:15] tomorrow, but you know this this devil's
[45:17] going to be a trophy on my wall and it's
[45:19] going to be a foregone conclusion. And
[45:21] there would have been something happened
[45:22] to him when he saw the enemy saying,
[45:24] "Sure, the the cities are big." You
[45:25] know, something would have risen up in
[45:26] his heart cuz now he was seeing he was
[45:29] seeing his inheritance, but then he was
[45:31] seeing the squatters on his inheritance.
[45:32] And when you see a squatter on some land
[45:34] that's yours, the first thing you do is
[45:36] get out of here. And if you don't go,
[45:38] I'm going to make you go. Amen. And then
[45:40] if you need backup, you get the
[45:42] government to come in and deal with
[45:43] them. And it's like the believer, we
[45:45] have all of heaven is behind the
[45:47] believer. Amen. You have every believer
[45:50] is the ambassador. Amen. Of heaven
[45:52] itself. Because every country, the
[45:54] ambassador, the country backs up the
[45:56] ambassador.
[45:58] Amen. And we happen to be the
[46:00] ambassadors of heaven. Amen. So we have
[46:03] a right. I trust. That's why never look
[46:06] at never look at the circumstance. Oh,
[46:09] this has been going on. Abraham's body
[46:12] was dead for 25 years.
[46:16] But he staggered not at the promise of
[46:17] God through unbelief, but was strong
[46:19] giving praise. This is the commentary of
[46:21] his life. Sure, they, you know, if you
[46:23] read the Old Testament, they backslid a
[46:25] couple of times, left the land, all
[46:26] different kinds of things. But at the
[46:29] end of the day, his faith was stronger
[46:31] than those things.
[46:33] Amen. His faith was stronger than those
[46:35] things. And they received the promised
[46:37] son. He had to believe like you have to
[46:40] believe. It's not, you know, the heroes
[46:43] of faith in this Bible, it wasn't just
[46:45] given to him on a silver platter.
[46:48] They were like, it's like it says about
[46:49] Elijah, he was a man of like passions
[46:51] like we are. They're all people like us.
[46:55] Yeah. Amen. They all had the
[46:57] same burdens and troubles and whatever
[47:00] more, but their faith was ignited. Amen.
[47:04] Amen. And when the enemy came against
[47:06] them, their faith overcame that enemy.
[47:08] That's right. Like you see the apostles,
[47:11] you know, they came and they were beaten
[47:13] and they were let go and they rejoiced.
[47:15] We're so thankful that we're worthy,
[47:18] count of we to to suffer, you know, for
[47:20] our Lord's sake. And then they were put
[47:22] in prison and and and God opened the
[47:24] prison up and amen, you know, then, you
[47:26] know, and then they then they had a
[47:27] prayer meeting and God God came down and
[47:29] shook the place and gave them boldness
[47:32] to preach. Amen. because their faith was
[47:34] greater than the complexes and the fear
[47:36] that the government was trying to put
[47:38] upon them because it wasn't them that
[47:40] was doing the work. It was God in them.
[47:42] Amen. And they knew all they needed was
[47:44] just to let go of their fear and the
[47:46] what could be and the because you know
[47:48] when someone threatens you in our
[47:51] humanity it's intimidating because they
[47:54] knew what they saw what they did to
[47:55] their Lord and Savior, they do the same
[47:58] to
[47:59] them. And there was no there was no um
[48:03] fair justice or anything. They hatch up
[48:06] some false witnesses. They'll be killed,
[48:08] you know, just like their Lord.
[48:13] But something was in there.
[48:15] And they knew that God, if the enemy
[48:18] tries to put a doubt or a fear or
[48:20] complex on a believer, the believer
[48:22] knows God can break those things. Amen.
[48:25] And that's why when they had the prayer
[48:26] meeting came and shook the place, gave
[48:29] them boldness, they went out onto the
[48:30] street with more ferency and and faith
[48:33] than ever before. Amen. Hallelujah. And
[48:36] they overcame.
[48:38] The same God there is here. The same God
[48:41] in them is in you. Amen. Amen. The same
[48:43] one, not a different one, not a less
[48:45] powerful one, the same one. That's
[48:48] right. Amen. We have the faith that was
[48:50] once delivered to the saints.
[48:53] So now and that's like Timothy. Timothy
[48:57] was told by Paul to stir up the gift
[48:58] that's within
[49:00] me because now he's he's instructing
[49:03] Timothy in these things and and he was
[49:06] told to endure hardness as a soldier
[49:10] because no doubt things had happened in
[49:12] Timothy's life that had that had maybe
[49:15] kind of not made him go into unbelief or
[49:17] backslide but kind of diminish his his
[49:21] uh ferveny
[49:23] to do the work of evangelist. Yeah.
[49:26] Amen. Because the devil can try and if
[49:29] he if he can't derail you off into lies,
[49:32] he'll try and bind you in some way that
[49:34] you try and you're in fear. Yeah, that's
[49:36] true. Amen. And so Timothy was told to
[49:39] stir up the gift that's within me. Amen.
[49:41] So that gift is faith. It's not just a
[49:43] preaching gift. Every believer has a
[49:45] gift. And that gift really ultimately is
[49:48] your faith in the word. Thank you, Lord.
[49:50] Amen. So he's told to stir up that gift.
[49:52] And if he stirred up that gift, it would
[49:54] break the oppression that was put on him
[49:56] by whatever happened to him. Amen. Amen.
[49:59] That's why he was told stir up the gift.
[50:02] And it's the same thing with us. It
[50:04] didn't mean Timothy was in unbelief or
[50:06] he backslid or something was wrong with
[50:07] his walk in that way, but the enemy just
[50:10] tried to derail because remember Paul
[50:13] endured a lot of things. That's true.
[50:15] You know, there's a list somewhere. I
[50:18] think it's in second
[50:19] Corinthians chapter 4.
[50:23] I guarantee you none of none of you
[50:25] have. Especially I put myself here.
[50:28] I've endured earthquakes.
[50:32] Delayed
[50:33] flights, volcanoes closing airports, but
[50:35] nothing like this,
[50:39] you know. So, and those things are just
[50:41] anyway, but you know what I mean.
[50:46] Now, I might be in the wrong. Anyway,
[50:50] but he says, you know, I've been I've
[50:52] been shipwrecked. I've been beaten. I've
[50:53] received 40 odd stripes. I've been
[50:55] robbed. I've been destitute. You know,
[50:57] he says to was it Timothy or Titus?
[50:59] Can't remember which one. Bring my bring
[51:01] my other coat. You know, you know, he
[51:04] was he could have been a very rich man,
[51:06] but he was a very poor man. He suffered
[51:07] a lot of things. You know, he it was not
[51:11] a flower bed of visa for him. But
[51:14] whenever and he didn't probably no doubt
[51:16] he did not
[51:17] understand why was he shipwrecked or why
[51:21] was he robbed or you know all these
[51:23] different things he didn't understand.
[51:24] It's not like it happened. Then the Lord
[51:25] came down and says this is why this is
[51:26] why this is why. He just had to keep
[51:28] walking in faith. That's right. Amen.
[51:30] Amen. And so he knew what it was like to
[51:33] go down a rugged way. Yeah. Yeah. And
[51:36] because Paul because even as he said
[51:38] that we would know him in the likeness,
[51:40] you know, in the power of his
[51:42] resurrection and the likeness of his
[51:44] sufferings. So Paul had a rugged road
[51:47] and his life is actually the pattern for
[51:49] every true minister that's down through
[51:52] the ages. Amen. Amen. Preach the truth,
[51:57] you know, we'll, you know, we'll not
[51:59] will not bow to money, woman, or
[52:01] popularity or, you know, all those
[52:03] different things. you know, we'll we'll
[52:04] produce Christ in the people, you know,
[52:07] all those things. But see, but he did
[52:10] not allow those things to affect them.
[52:13] Why? Because he knew his faith.
[52:15] Remember, it was revealed to him, you
[52:17] must go to
[52:18] Rome. You got to be a chess unto me to
[52:21] take my word to the Gentiles. All these
[52:23] different things. So, it was revealed to
[52:25] him these things had to happen. And then
[52:27] when it came down to the point where
[52:29] they were sharpening the ax, no, no, I
[52:30] think it was a sword in those days.
[52:32] Roman citizens were were beheaded with a
[52:34] sword. You know, when that was all
[52:36] happening, he says, "Well, I fought a
[52:37] good fight. I've ran my race. There's a
[52:40] crown of life awaiting for me." So, it
[52:42] didn't get him down, you know. Oh, this
[52:44] is the end. He says, "Well, I'm done.
[52:46] Yeah. I'm finished. It's not because I'm
[52:49] washed up. It's because I've I've I've
[52:52] lived out my portion of the word that
[52:54] was allotted. Dispensation. The gospel
[52:56] was committed to me," Paul says. And he
[52:58] and he gave that
[53:00] dispensation, you know, and then now
[53:02] he's done. And he passed the torch on to
[53:05] someone else, you know, the minister
[53:07] ministers that were risen up um under
[53:09] him. He passed the same Pentecostal
[53:11] flame into them. Yes. And it was done.
[53:14] But he could, but every challenge that
[53:16] he had, it's just like he's bitten by
[53:18] the was it ASP or something out, you
[53:19] know, he's shipwrecked. He survives the
[53:21] shipwreck. He's there collecting wood,
[53:23] you know, for the fire. Then a snake
[53:25] comes out and bites him. What does he
[53:27] do?
[53:28] He doesn't start running around
[53:30] screaming.
[53:31] He just There's the fire. There you go,
[53:34] serpent. That's where you're going to
[53:35] belong. Satan, this is just a for, you
[53:37] know, this is just a shadow of really
[53:39] you you're going to burn in the lake of
[53:40] fire. Amen. Hallelujah. Glory. And he
[53:43] just walked on. And the people thought,
[53:44] well, he must have been a terrible
[53:45] crook. That's why he's going to die.
[53:47] It's a poisonous snake. And they
[53:48] thought, he must be a god. That's what
[53:50] it says in the scripture. But that
[53:53] didn't bother him because the Lord, it
[53:56] wasn't I know. So it's I know so you're
[53:58] going to Rome, you must speak of me in
[54:01] Rome. So it didn't bother him. And it's
[54:05] the same thing with us. You have to
[54:07] remember now if this word is quickened.
[54:10] Doesn't matter what part, you and your
[54:11] seat will be there. Amen. We're not
[54:14] going to leave one hoof behind. Moses
[54:15] said, "Hallelujah. You and your
[54:17] household." Amen. Amen. Believe on the
[54:19] Lord Jesus Christ, the Philippian jailer
[54:22] said, "And you and your household shall
[54:24] be saved." Amen. They had to be saved
[54:26] like he was saved. Thank you, Lord.
[54:28] Amen. And so they came in the same way
[54:31] he did. It has to be if that's quickened
[54:34] to you. Doesn't matter what they try and
[54:36] do against you or what happens where
[54:39] wherever they may go. Yeah. You know
[54:42] Jesus spake a parable of a prodical son
[54:46] and he said there was a certain there
[54:48] was a certain man that had two sons.
[54:52] I believe he wasn't just giving a nice
[54:55] parable, but I believe he was giving
[54:57] actually a literal thing.
[54:59] Amen. Because when the son was in the
[55:03] pig pen, he came to himself. Well, how
[55:06] can someone come to themselves? God
[55:08] changes their thinking. That is the only
[55:10] way someone can come to themselves say,
[55:12] "Hey," and actually realize because
[55:14] remember he said to his dad, "Give me my
[55:16] inheritance." He made up his mind, "I'm
[55:18] going this way." Yeah. what turns
[55:20] someone around to go this way. It's not
[55:22] their own ability cuz you think about
[55:24] it. You know, men are proud.
[55:28] And so, no doubt this before he came.
[55:31] Now, this is just me. I'm just
[55:32] dramatizing, trying to make it a bit
[55:34] more alive, maybe. But, you know, young
[55:37] men are proud. So, do you think, you
[55:39] know, you see, so maybe he sees his
[55:41] life's going down. He's spending all his
[55:42] money. He reaches into his last bag of
[55:44] money. Here comes his last piece of gold
[55:46] or whatever. Do you think he's going to
[55:48] say, "Maybe I should go back to dad."
[55:51] Cuz if he does, he say, "I'm wrong." And
[55:54] no young guy likes to say they're wrong.
[55:58] Amen. Amen. Hallelujah.
[56:01] I'm still young.
[56:03] I was going to say I was young once, but
[56:05] I think I'm still young. But you see, so
[56:08] his pride, his pride would have kept him
[56:11] going in that direction. Remember, he
[56:13] was a Jew. He finds himself in a foreign
[56:16] land feeding swine the scraps. So he's
[56:20] feeding an animal which is unclean which
[56:23] being raised up his whole youth has said
[56:25] that's unclean you shalln't eat that all
[56:27] those different things but he's feeding
[56:29] them and he realized that this unclean
[56:31] animal is in a greater station of life
[56:33] than I am because at least it gets food
[56:35] and I want to eat its food. Yeah. Then
[56:38] he came to himself. What caused him? As
[56:40] I said, it was God answering prayer of a
[56:43] father. Amen. That made him come to
[56:45] himself. Amen. Amen. You have the power
[56:48] to bind and the power to loose. Amen.
[56:50] Amen. You have the power. Whatsoever you
[56:52] ask in my name, I'll do it. That's
[56:54] right. Amen. That's what the Bible tells
[56:58] us. So, he comes to himself. God gets a
[57:01] hold of him. He realizes it's better in
[57:03] my father's house.
[57:05] And then so he starts making his way
[57:07] back and it says when the father saw the
[57:10] son a far off. Wow. What's happening?
[57:13] They had prayer. They're praying. Then
[57:16] they made a breakthrough in prayer. The
[57:18] peace came down. Thank you, Lord. What?
[57:20] Turned to his wife. Honey, little
[57:22] Johnny's going to be all right. That's
[57:24] right. I don't know how, but I'm going
[57:26] to start looking. Thank you, Lord. You
[57:28] felt that breakthrough. Yes, dear. I
[57:29] felt that breakthrough. Hallelujah.
[57:31] Glory to God. He's on his way. Amen. And
[57:34] then that's why he began to look every
[57:35] morning. No doubt cuz he saw the way he
[57:38] was going. So he's going to come back
[57:39] that same way. He's looking and he saw
[57:41] him a far off and he ran to him cuz he
[57:44] knew God answered the press. It wasn't a
[57:46] I know so. It's a I know so. Amen. And
[57:50] he's the same yesterday, today, and
[57:51] forever. Glory. Amen. And he saw him
[57:54] come a far off. And that's why he went
[57:56] and embraced him. Put the robe best robe
[57:59] on and put his ring on his finger.
[58:01] Hallelujah. placed him back in the
[58:02] family where he was originally.
[58:04] Hallelujah. Cuz when faith is
[58:07] challenged,
[58:09] Amen. the believer always wins.
[58:12] Hallelujah. Amen. The believer always
[58:15] wins. Amen. Amen. That's true.
[58:19] How about you?
[58:22] All things are possible to them that
[58:23] believe. Thank you, Lord. Amen.
[58:27] Confess it until it sinks down here.
[58:30] Yes. Amen. Amen. Believe it until it
[58:33] sinks down here. It's not just I hope
[58:35] so, I hope so, I hope so. Confess it
[58:37] until it sinks down here and then you
[58:38] know. That's right. Amen.
[58:42] We have
[58:45] I have seen it happen many
[58:47] times where you know God's heard your
[58:50] prayer. You don't know how it's going to
[58:52] happen, but he heard your prayer and
[58:53] it's going to happen. And it happens.
[58:55] Amen. Amen. Hallelujah.
[58:59] Amen. Let's just go to I want to go to
[59:02] if I can find it. Second I think it's
[59:04] second
[59:11] Corinthians. Yeah. Let's go to let's go
[59:14] to second Corinthians 4.
[59:23] Yes.
[59:24] Verse
[59:26] 13. We having the same spirit of faith.
[59:30] Yeah. You got to say, I have the same
[59:32] spirit of faith.
[59:34] According as written, I believed and
[59:37] therefore have I spoken.
[59:40] We also believe and therefore speak.
[59:43] Amen. Amen. So you got to you got to
[59:47] speak in faith. Not not hope so faith,
[59:50] but know so faith. That's right. Amen.
[59:53] And then God will cause the situation to
[59:56] change according to what you have said.
[59:59] That's right. Amen. If you say,
[1:00:02] remember, now we won't read it just now,
[1:00:05] but if you read the book of Mark, you
[1:00:07] know, Jesus goes into
[1:00:10] um he speaks about if you believe and
[1:00:14] don't doubt and say to this mountain, be
[1:00:16] there moved and cast into the sea, it
[1:00:19] will happen. Amen. But before that or
[1:00:21] during that chapter, he speaks about
[1:00:22] forgiveness.
[1:00:25] Amen. So he's linking per what we term
[1:00:28] perfect faith with forgiveness.
[1:00:31] So in order to have perfect faith, you
[1:00:33] have to perfectly forgive everyone
[1:00:35] against you. That's right. True. Amen.
[1:00:37] Amen. That's why Jesus Jesus at the
[1:00:39] moment when he went to Calvary as a man
[1:00:42] and he died on your behalf, he had
[1:00:46] perfect faith and he said, "Father,
[1:00:48] forgive them. They don't know what they
[1:00:49] do. He had perfect forgiveness. And then
[1:00:52] he went there and he and he and he says,
[1:00:54] "No one takes my life from me. I lay it
[1:00:56] down." He was laying it down. He said,
[1:00:58] "Father, into thy hands do I commit my
[1:01:00] spirit." He gave up the ghost.
[1:01:02] Hallelujah. Because he had to believe in
[1:01:04] the scripture that was allotted to him.
[1:01:06] Yeah. Amen. Amen. Remember on Mount
[1:01:08] Transfiguration there, there's one of
[1:01:09] the accounts Moses and Elijah tell him
[1:01:12] what he must accomplish at Jerusalem. So
[1:01:14] they actually come and preach to him.
[1:01:16] this is what you're going to do cuz it's
[1:01:17] written in the scripture.
[1:01:19] But in order but but at his crowning
[1:01:22] moment he actually said Lord forgive
[1:01:25] them.
[1:01:26] The last few maybe moments I don't know
[1:01:28] how long he's on the cross for but his
[1:01:30] last last few recorded words before he
[1:01:33] went to the tomb. He says father forgive
[1:01:36] them. They don't know what they do. And
[1:01:37] as I've said many times you would think
[1:01:40] humanly they knew what they were doing.
[1:01:42] They schemed it. It said it said they
[1:01:44] actually had councils. How are we going
[1:01:45] to lay hold of this man? How are we
[1:01:47] going to destroy his influence? They
[1:01:49] planned it and they schemed it and they
[1:01:50] made false witnesses. And then when
[1:01:52] Judas gave them the occasion, they took,
[1:01:55] you know, they, you know, they took
[1:01:56] advantage and they gave him armed guards
[1:01:58] and they paid him and they did all those
[1:02:00] things and they set up the court and
[1:02:01] they, you know, and they roused up the
[1:02:03] mob, crucify him, crucify him, and all
[1:02:05] these different things. It's incredible.
[1:02:07] A week before they were crying out,
[1:02:09] hosana, blessed he that comes in the son
[1:02:12] of yo yo yo, blessed the name of the
[1:02:14] Lord as he's riding up on the donkey up
[1:02:16] into Jerusalem. They laid down their
[1:02:18] garments and they were just, you know,
[1:02:20] it's like the millennium was coming in.
[1:02:22] They're having such a glorious worship.
[1:02:24] Hosana, blessing it comes in the name of
[1:02:25] the Lord. And then a week later, they
[1:02:27] say, "Crucify him away with such a
[1:02:28] fellow." That's right. We'll not have
[1:02:30] this man. What do you want me to release
[1:02:32] to you? Barabbus, a murderer or this
[1:02:34] Jesus called the Christ? give us Barab.
[1:02:37] Why was that the influence of the
[1:02:39] scribes and Pharisees among the people?
[1:02:40] Yeah, that's right. They planned it. We
[1:02:44] have to force Pilate's hand because we
[1:02:46] can't legally have him killed. The
[1:02:48] Romans have to do it. And so they forced
[1:02:50] his hand that he had to do it because
[1:02:53] Pilate knew because it was a very
[1:02:55] dangerous, you know, very volatile area
[1:02:57] of the empire that if he let Jesus go,
[1:03:00] the scribes and Pharisees would raise up
[1:03:02] revolt and then he would be held
[1:03:05] accountable.
[1:03:06] So they put pressure. So that sounds to
[1:03:08] me like they planned it. They knew what
[1:03:10] they were doing.
[1:03:12] But Jesus said, because Paul said if
[1:03:14] they really knew who he was, they would
[1:03:16] never have crucified the prince of life.
[1:03:18] Right. Amen. But on a human level, you'd
[1:03:21] say they planned this and it went
[1:03:24] according to plan. And they didn't just
[1:03:26] plan it, but they were tried to
[1:03:27] safeguard the fact they went to Pilot,
[1:03:29] we need soldiers. We want to really bury
[1:03:31] this thing, you know, seal up the tomb
[1:03:34] and all these things. They knew what
[1:03:35] they were doing. But Jesus and many
[1:03:38] times people come against you and you
[1:03:41] may think they know what they're doing.
[1:03:43] They've planned this. They've been
[1:03:44] pondering this. They've been brewing
[1:03:45] over things and it just comes out like
[1:03:47] veon.
[1:03:49] But in reality, they don't know what
[1:03:50] they're doing. Right? If they really
[1:03:52] knew, if they really knew who, remember,
[1:03:54] we believe we're part of the body of
[1:03:56] Christ, right? Amen.
[1:03:59] And if we're part of, if we're part of
[1:04:02] him, then we are Mrs. Jesus Christ.
[1:04:05] Yeah. By union because the two would
[1:04:08] become one. Mystery of Christ and his
[1:04:10] church. And so if they really knew who
[1:04:12] you were, they would never do what they
[1:04:15] do. That's right. So that's why you have
[1:04:17] to come to a place say Lord forgive them
[1:04:19] they do not know what they do.
[1:04:23] Amen. Remember this is his crowning
[1:04:25] moment. I'm going to close with this
[1:04:26] thought. I just want you to really think
[1:04:27] about it. The clone for this cause I've
[1:04:30] come into the world. He's about last few
[1:04:34] last few words out of those precious
[1:04:37] lips before they're sealed and gone into
[1:04:38] the tomb. Father forgive them. They
[1:04:40] don't know what they do. And because he
[1:04:43] had to believe the scripture like you
[1:04:45] have to believe the scripture because
[1:04:48] remember he is he was the example of
[1:04:50] Christianity.
[1:04:51] He wasn't sure he was the God man but he
[1:04:55] was fully human and fully man. He had to
[1:04:57] be I mean fully God and fully man. He
[1:04:59] had to be God because no one else could
[1:05:00] redeem humanity but he had to be fully
[1:05:03] human because he had to be a kinsman. He
[1:05:05] had to be a kinsman redeemer. And so he
[1:05:09] he lived such a life because he was
[1:05:11] showing this is how humans should be.
[1:05:14] Amen. Amen. He was giving a living
[1:05:17] example. So if he is like us in that
[1:05:20] way, then he had to believe the
[1:05:22] scripture. He had one scripture. I'll
[1:05:24] not suffer thy holy one to see
[1:05:26] corruption.
[1:05:27] Amen. So he knew and he knew he was the
[1:05:30] holy one of Israel.
[1:05:32] That was that wasn't I know so was I
[1:05:34] know so. Amen.
[1:05:36] Amen. That was the only scripture he
[1:05:38] had.
[1:05:40] And so with that one scripture being
[1:05:43] revealed to him, he went to the Cal He
[1:05:44] went to Calvary. He went to the tomb,
[1:05:46] but he knew he wouldn't stay in the
[1:05:47] tomb. Amen.
[1:05:50] And his whole life, what happened?
[1:05:51] Faith.
[1:05:53] Faith was challenged.
[1:05:56] And God always wins or the believer
[1:05:58] always wins because God is in the
[1:06:00] believer. Amen. Amen. We have some
[1:06:04] musicians. When you ponder these things,
[1:06:07] this crowning moment, he had to forgive.
[1:06:10] It says about Job. I know brother Bley
[1:06:12] Williams brought it out,
[1:06:14] but you read at the end of Job. Maybe
[1:06:17] let's just find that
[1:06:21] scripture. It's in one of the last
[1:06:23] chapters of
[1:06:28] Job. So this is Job 42.
[1:06:34] And
[1:06:36] then let's just read from verse seven.
[1:06:40] It says, "And it was so that after the
[1:06:43] Lord had spoken these words unto Job,
[1:06:45] the Lord said unto Alfas the Timite, my
[1:06:49] wrath is kindled against thee, and
[1:06:51] against thy two friends. For ye have not
[1:06:53] spoken of me the thing which is right,
[1:06:56] as my servant Job hath. Therefore, take
[1:06:59] unto you now seven bulocks and seven
[1:07:00] rams. Go to my servant Job and offer up
[1:07:03] for yourselves a burnt offering, and my
[1:07:05] servant Job shall pray for you. For he
[1:07:08] will I accept, least I deal with you
[1:07:10] after your folly, and that ye have not
[1:07:13] spoken of me the thing which is right
[1:07:15] like my servant Job. So Alfaz the
[1:07:18] Temonite and and and Buildad the the
[1:07:22] the Shirite and Zofa the the Nathanite,
[1:07:26] however you say it, forgive me, went and
[1:07:28] did according as the Lord commanded
[1:07:30] them. The Lord also accepted Job. And
[1:07:33] the Lord turned the captivity of Job
[1:07:36] when he prayed for his friends. Also,
[1:07:39] the Lord gave Job twice as much as he
[1:07:41] had before. So his captivity, I know
[1:07:43] brother Burley brought it out, but he he
[1:07:45] turned his captivity when he prayed.
[1:07:48] Remember, he could have been very angry
[1:07:49] at his friends. You've been trying to
[1:07:51] give me a false witness of what God who
[1:07:53] God really is and how God deals with
[1:07:56] man. He could have been angry cuz they
[1:07:58] were actually preaching to him false
[1:07:59] doctrine in a way cuz they didn't fully
[1:08:02] understand who God was. Now here's God.
[1:08:05] This is the last thing you have to do
[1:08:06] Job in order to overcome. You have to
[1:08:08] pray for your friends. Amen. And then
[1:08:11] his captivity was turned.
[1:08:14] Amen. Right. That's a big You say,
[1:08:18] "Well,
[1:08:20] I'm not Job." I say, "Yeah, you are Job.
[1:08:23] But you're more than Job because here's
[1:08:24] under the blood of bulls and goats.
[1:08:25] under the blood of Jesus Christ.
[1:08:26] Hallelujah. Amen. Yes. That's right. And
[1:08:29] so if he had to pray for them and and I
[1:08:32] believe he had to forgive them and act
[1:08:34] because he had to stand in the gap for
[1:08:36] his friends. And you can't really stand
[1:08:38] in the gap for someone in prayer if you
[1:08:40] have something ought against them.
[1:08:41] That's right. Amen. So he had to forgive
[1:08:43] them and stand in the gap for them and
[1:08:45] pray for his friends. And then his
[1:08:47] captivity was turned.
[1:08:50] Amen. Many times we think, well, why am
[1:08:52] I still maybe going through this? Do you
[1:08:54] have a against the person? You know, I
[1:08:56] was reading over my notes from Brother
[1:08:58] Burley's sermon. He says, um, it's just
[1:09:00] a phrase that he said that I wrote down.
[1:09:02] If you think of someone or an event and
[1:09:04] you have an ill feeling against it, he
[1:09:06] says there's still unforgiveness there.
[1:09:10] Amen. So you think about that
[1:09:17] because you know if there is still ill
[1:09:20] feeling or something unforgiveness you
[1:09:22] got to take that to the Lord.
[1:09:25] Amen. Cuz
[1:09:27] remember we have you say well how can I
[1:09:30] make it it's such a bitter feeling or a
[1:09:33] bitter memory. How can I make it sweet?
[1:09:35] Remember Moses crossed the Red Sea with
[1:09:37] Israel. They came three days without
[1:09:39] water. They came to a a brook and it had
[1:09:41] it was called mara cuz the water is
[1:09:43] bitter. Then God pointed out a tree. Cut
[1:09:46] that tree down, put it into the water
[1:09:47] and it'll become sweet. And many other
[1:09:50] people no doubt journeyed that way. So
[1:09:53] many people would have had a bitter
[1:09:55] walk, bitter experience. But God pointed
[1:09:58] out to Moses, take this tree, put it in
[1:10:00] the water. That tree would have been
[1:10:01] there when the other people drank it and
[1:10:03] it was bitter. We have a tree. It's
[1:10:05] called Calvary. Amen. Put Calvary into
[1:10:08] your into your bitter experience. It'll
[1:10:10] become sweet. That's right. Because
[1:10:11] you'll be released from it. It'll bring
[1:10:14] healing. Amen. Amen.
[1:10:18] Amen. Let's just stand, shall we? I want
[1:10:21] to sing um um what's that song saying?
[1:10:24] Hide me now under your wings. Yeah.
[1:10:27] Amen. God bless you, friends.
[1:10:32] When faith is challenged, you remember
[1:10:34] when your faith is challenged, when the
[1:10:36] devil challenges you, you have the faith
[1:10:37] that will overcome. Amen. Don't lean on
[1:10:40] the arm of flesh. You lean on the arm of
[1:10:45] God.
[1:10:47] Hide
[1:10:49] me
[1:10:52] now
[1:10:54] under
[1:10:56] your
[1:10:57] wings. Yes, Lord.
[1:11:00] Oh,
[1:11:03] cover
[1:11:06] me within your
[1:11:09] mighty
[1:11:12] hand. When the oceans rise and
[1:11:17] thunder
[1:11:19] roar, I will soar with you
[1:11:23] above the storm.
[1:11:27] Father, you are king
[1:11:31] over the
[1:11:34] blood. I will be still and know
[1:11:38] you are
[1:11:42] God. Find
[1:11:45] rest
[1:11:46] my
[1:11:50] soul in
[1:11:53] Christ alone.
[1:12:01] Glory is
[1:12:04] found in
[1:12:07] quietness and trumps.
[1:12:11] When the oceans rise and
[1:12:15] thunderers
[1:12:17] roar, I will soar with you
[1:12:22] above the
[1:12:25] storm. Father, you are king
[1:12:29] over the
[1:12:32] flood. I will be still and know you are
[1:12:39] God. When the oceans rise and
[1:12:44] thunder
[1:12:46] roar, I will soar with you
[1:12:51] above the
[1:12:53] stor. Oh father, you are king
[1:12:58] over the
[1:13:01] blood. I will be still and know
[1:13:06] you are God. Let's go verse one again.
[1:13:09] Who wants to be hidden under his wings?
[1:13:12] Father
[1:13:14] me now. Yes,
[1:13:17] Lord.
[1:13:19] Under
[1:13:21] your
[1:13:25] wings.
[1:13:28] Cover
[1:13:32] me within your
[1:13:35] mighty hand.
[1:13:38] When the oceans rise and
[1:13:42] thunderers
[1:13:45] roar, I will soar with you
[1:13:49] above the
[1:13:52] storm. Father, you are king
[1:13:56] over the
[1:13:59] cloud. I will be still and know
[1:14:04] you are God.
[1:14:09] Find
[1:14:10] rest
[1:14:12] my
[1:14:15] soul in
[1:14:17] Christ
[1:14:21] alone is Lord.
[1:14:25] Oh
[1:14:27] his
[1:14:30] power in
[1:14:33] quietness and
[1:14:36] trust. When the oceans rise and
[1:14:41] thunderers
[1:14:43] roar, I will soar with you
[1:14:48] above the stor.
[1:14:52] Father, you are king
[1:14:55] over the
[1:14:58] blood. I will be still and know
[1:15:03] you are
[1:15:05] God. I will be still and know
[1:15:10] you are God.
[1:15:15] Hallelujah.
[1:15:16] Amen. If anyone would like to be
[1:15:18] remembered to pray, just want to raise
[1:15:19] your hands to the Lord.
[1:15:21] Gracious Father, Lord, I have both hands
[1:15:24] up.
[1:15:26] Father, there's many challenges in this
[1:15:28] day. Yes, Father. But Lord, we so
[1:15:31] thankful that you are greater.
[1:15:33] Lord, you said greater is in thee that
[1:15:35] is in the world. And Lord, your word
[1:15:38] says, cast all your cares upon him
[1:15:40] because he cares for you. Thank you,
[1:15:42] Lord. How thankful we care, Lord. You
[1:15:43] care for us, Lord. The Lord the
[1:15:48] unlovable, Lord. Yet you love us with an
[1:15:50] everlasting love, Lord. You care for us,
[1:15:53] oh God. We're so thankful we can cast
[1:15:55] our cares upon you, Father. We're so
[1:15:57] glad that, Lord, the faith that you've
[1:15:59] quickened within us, Lord, is Lord is
[1:16:01] there when the enemy comes against us,
[1:16:03] oh God. We don't need to depend upon our
[1:16:05] own ability. Thank you, Lord, or even
[1:16:07] working it out or fixing it in our own
[1:16:09] strength. But Father, you guide us
[1:16:11] through the battle, Lord. You guide us
[1:16:13] through the challenge. We thank you for
[1:16:14] that, Lord. We're so glad the believer
[1:16:16] has always been victorious in you. Yes,
[1:16:18] Lord. We praise your holy name for that,
[1:16:20] oh God. Lord, Father, we're so thankful
[1:16:22] that nothing can take our faith from us,
[1:16:25] Lord. We're so glad you're in control of
[1:16:27] every situation, that our footsteps are
[1:16:29] ordained of you. Lord, that this day was
[1:16:32] ordained, Lord, wherever we went today,
[1:16:34] whatever we faced, Lord, you knew it
[1:16:36] would happen. Yes, Father. But, Father,
[1:16:38] you have confidence in your salvation.
[1:16:40] Amen. Lord, you have confidence not in
[1:16:42] our humanity, but the seed you placed
[1:16:43] within us before the foundation of the
[1:16:45] world. We thank you for that, almighty
[1:16:47] God. Yes. Father, help us to be rugged.
[1:16:50] Help us to be burly with our faith. Oh
[1:16:52] God, Father, help us not to shrink back
[1:16:54] from the challenge, but to charge in,
[1:16:56] Lord, we know David raced towards
[1:16:58] Goliath with a sling. He didn't just
[1:17:00] stand there like so depicted in many
[1:17:02] things, many children's stories and
[1:17:04] movies, but he ran towards the enemy,
[1:17:06] Father, cuz he knew it was all over.
[1:17:08] Lord, Father, it's quickened him, oh
[1:17:10] God. Father, oh Lord, we're so thankful
[1:17:12] that that same God, that same anointing
[1:17:14] that came upon David, you're the same
[1:17:16] God today. And Father, we're under the
[1:17:18] blood of your precious son, the Lord
[1:17:20] Jesus. Amen. Not under the blood of
[1:17:22] bulls and goats. We thank you for that,
[1:17:25] Lord. So glad, Lord, you don't see us,
[1:17:27] but Lord, you see our blood. Father, we
[1:17:30] praise your holy name. Thank you, Lord.
[1:17:32] I just pray that you'll just bring these
[1:17:35] things to our mind. May we ponder about
[1:17:37] what we've heard tonight. Father,
[1:17:39] there's anyone here that has un uh
[1:17:41] unforgiveness or bitterness or anything
[1:17:44] against their past or whatever's
[1:17:46] happened against anyone. Lord, may they
[1:17:48] just lay it at your feet. Lord, may may
[1:17:51] you just take it. May they don't want to
[1:17:52] hold on to it anymore. Lord, Father, you
[1:17:55] knew where we would go in life. It's not
[1:17:58] always a flowery bed of bees, but you
[1:18:00] knew that, Lord. Father, you are Lord,
[1:18:03] as David said, even though you lead us
[1:18:05] through the valley and the shadow of
[1:18:06] death, I'll fear no evil. Lord, as long
[1:18:09] as you're our shepherd, you'll lead us
[1:18:11] through, Father. And you won't leave us,
[1:18:13] but you'll take us through the other
[1:18:14] side into glory. We thank you for that
[1:18:16] confidence that we can have in you,
[1:18:17] Lord. You're a Lord. You're you're the
[1:18:20] best shepherd. Amen. Lord, you don't
[1:18:22] lose a sheep. Lord, we're so thankful
[1:18:24] that, oh God. And if we get wounded and
[1:18:25] hurt and scarred, Lord, you have the
[1:18:27] medicine, Lord, to heal us better than
[1:18:29] ever before. Lord, we're so thankful we
[1:18:31] can have a real relationship with our
[1:18:33] shepherd. Father, we love you, oh God.
[1:18:36] Amen. Want to commit the service into
[1:18:37] your hands in Jesus Christ's name. Amen.
[1:18:41] Amen.
[1:18:43] Hallelujah.
[1:18:45] Amen. Let's just let's just finish with
[1:18:46] with number eight. In your presence,
