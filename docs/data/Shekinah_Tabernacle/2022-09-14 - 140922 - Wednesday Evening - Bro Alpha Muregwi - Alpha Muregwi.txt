God's secret secret mystery he had before the world began now back in the back of both mind there was something he was trying and he was going to achieve and he had a motive in doing it in order to let himself be expressed because first there wasn't even Moon Star atom molecule or anything he was God yeah but he exactly wasn't God at that time because God is an object of worship there wasn't nothing to worship Him amen hallelujah so uh sorry I think I cut I did cut this this this this this quote praise the Lord let's see if I picked it up well uh praise the Lord okay fine I wanted to go down with it you see it in the beginning God if you go into Christ The Mystery of God God had the attributes of being a father God wanted here the abuse of being a Healer but there was no one to show healing too yeah that's why he created you then you put you in that position for you to be sick so that you can show you that he is a Healer so when you are sick tonight say Lord hear my yeah you created me so that you can express your God so that you can express your attributes now here am I God wanted to show to you that he is a savior that's why he had to let you go into the world yeah then when you went into the world that's when he came to you to save you and so the same God you still got the same attributes oh beautiful I'll read my last question the rest we'll see later praise the
