TRANSCRIPT
========================================
um I just like to thank the Lord and just give a little testimony about some day and I just it was about five or ten minutes and through the service and I just started crying I couldn't stop I didn't know what was going on and and then we had the word coming and the Lord just hitting so many things you know and in there and it was just beautiful and then we had the prayer line happening and I heard brother Ben say some of you will have mine barrels of it you know and I didn't go up to the front to be prayed for but I also know the prophecies that Lord can even meet you in your seat and sort of the woman that they touched the hem of Jesus garment you know he met her right there and for me I've never experienced anything like that I just stood there just worshiping the Lord and just praising him it was like I felt like a hand just touch me on my heart and just this was just from here just down the side here and it's been over two years where I had just had struggles with my heart and it was like a spiritual wound and I believe the Lord made me here that day and I just want to give him all the things the praises for his deliverance and this song this song here is called the restoration of the supernatural and thank you and that I wrote it in 2011 our pastor preached about that and then it took me five years to complete it because the second part was missing but it's where the Prophet when that interpretation came about it French French people that interpret it in the cafe and he said because you have chosen the narrow path the hard way and you have not walked in your own choosing you have picked the correct and precise decision and it is my way because this momentous decision a huge portion of heaven will await thee what a glorious you have made this in itself is that which will give and may come to pass the tremendous victory in the love divine it's a promise to us [Music] every [Music] there's no as well [Music] I will [Music] the natural for the supernatural [Applause]
