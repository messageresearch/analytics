says preserve me o god for in thee do i put my trust o my soul thou hast said unto the lord thou art my lord my goodness extendeth not to thee but to the saints that are in the earth and to thee and to the excellent in whom is all my delight their sorrow shall be multiplied that hasten after another god their drink offerings of blood will i not often or take up their names into my lips the lord is the portion of mine inheritance and of my cup thou maintaineth my lot the lines are fallen upon me in pleasant places yea i have a goodly heritage i will bless the lord who hath given me counsel my reigns also instruct me in the night seasons i have set the lord always before me because he is at my right hand i shall not be moved therefore my heart is glad and my glory rejoiceth my flesh also shall rest in hope for thou will not leave my soul in hell neither will thou suffer unholy one to see corruption thou will show me the path of life in thy presence is fullness of joy at thy right hand there are pleasures forevermore amen let's bow he's in a word of prayer this morning you know i want to be remembering a prayer just want to raise your hand to the lord raise your need in your heart

you're always mindful of us father every situation we're going through so lord may you be their portion lord today strengthen them oh god may touch all of our lives lord you know what we have need off today so may meet every need for your glory in jesus christ's name we ask amen amen god bless your friends you may uh have your seats this morning i'd like to take a subject and it probably i don't know if i'll stay on the subject but we'll just see how it goes but i want to talk about having faith in the scriptures that pertain to you i mean we're here to fulfill scripture we're not here just to occupy time we're not here just to go through a religious motion but we're here to fulfill scripture now what we just read there in psalm 16 we read uh just just the last portion of that uh uh and particularly he says that you know he says my heart is glad my glory rejoices my flesh also rest in hope for thou will not leave my soul in hell neither shall thou suffer the holy one to see corruption now when jesus you know to me the greatest miracle our lord ever did was not raising lazarus which was amazing or or calming the storm or feeding the thousands or casting out the devil delivering legion those things are incredible miracles but to me the greatest miracle he ever did was to subject his own flesh to the will of god where he could take these these these elements because you think about our lord he had the same conscious same affection same reasoning memory same same spirit realm same you know five senses of the physical realm he had all those same things as we do amen but but you know he was able by by by a full surrender to subject his own body to the word that he was sent to fulfill now you think about the word he has seen to fulfill he was he was the lamb of god he had to give his life as a willing sacrifice he had to bear the sins of the world upon his shoulder and you know he you know he wasn't what we would call the things he had to fulfill wasn't the glamorous things there was no glamour you know when we saw him the bible said there'd be no beauty of him that we desire him so you know there's no glamour you could say really with his great death burial but his resurrection was glorious amen but you know but he knew what he had to fulfill and he went to and so remember he he learned obedience by the things he suffered you know he you know god actually you know if i can put it this way he received revelation he knew who he was right he wasn't born in sin so so he you know he didn't he wasn't born with what we call spiritual amnesia he knew who he was as he would be a 12 year old boy sitting there talking with the scribes and pharisees in the temple and you know mary and joseph had have left them in jerusalem left them in jerusalem came running back and you know they're all upset and you know mary mary actually spoke against their own testimony saying your father i've sought thee with tears but jesus said don't you know i must be about my father's business what was he doing sitting in the temple discussing the word he is about his father's business his father's business wasn't carpentry his father's business was amen his true father amen god himself so you'd say he he he received revelation he had to it was revealed to him what he had to do as he as he would say in john 5 he'd say verily verily i say unto you the son can do nothing of himself but he saith the father do and these also do it the son likewise so he was led by vision right he was led by vision just like the prophet was led by a vision so so so he saw the vision and then he went and fulfilled the vision that's why he could go through the pool of bethesda bypass all those other sick people maybe they had more needs than the man that he actually healed but he was led by a vision to that one man right so so he was led by vision so when he was going to go up calvary he saw it before it happened so it wasn't just a scripture there and then he's got to work out how the details he saw the details he saw the he saw the scourging he saw the rejection he saw the pain he saw the agony he saw everything he had to endure in vision form and then he found himself stepping into that vision now none of us in our humanity would sign up for that no one likes pain no one likes rejection no one likes dying of a broken heart no one would sign up for that but he saw it and then he stepped into it and that's why he had the great agony in gethsemane where where it was like drops of blood the bubbles was dropping from his face he was under great agony because i think brother brown said it there was he was the one who was going to fulfill the job and only he could fulfill the job there was no second lamb he was it it was him and him alone but then heaven was waiting for an answer will he do it will he do it the angels were there yeah heaven was waiting because he was the lamb of god take away the sin of the world but then finally the answer came back not my will he says lord if you're willing take this cup from me but nevertheless not my will but thy will be done so because no one likes to die no one likes to feel pain and he knew what he had to fulfill when moses and elijah were with him on mount transfiguration it said in one account that they told him what he had to accomplish at jerusalem so they would have taken the scripture and they would begin to quote isaiah to him you'll be wounded for our transgressions the chastiser of our peace will be upon you and by your stripes we'll be healed i mean the iniquity of us all be poured out upon you i mean you are the lamb of god and no doubt they would say you know you're going to be you know they're going to pierce your hands and your feet you're going to be rejected you're going to be mocked you're going to you're going to take this into the world you know you're going to be our sin offering you're going to be our our our scapegoat you know and so they would have poured that they just had a few moments to just pour into him we're waiting on you to take your place we're waiting on we need you you think of moses the mightiest prophet of the old testament era never was a man like him when god spoke to him lip to wear incredible ministry incredible powers of deliverance but he did not have within himself the power to subject his whole self to the word of god his temple was still in him he couldn't he couldn't be free of it no matter how much god moved how much he was in the presence of god there wasn't a blood there that could change his sin nature i mean elijah was the same way where he called fire down on those two two bands of fifty that wasn't god that was him using a gift the wrong way that was his humanity working and so even these mighty men they needed someone to come to redeem them to actually change their nature amen yeah well well they had already gone but you know they were under the blood of bulls and goats they needed someone not just they needed blood to come not just to cover their sin like the blood and bulls and ghosts did but to take their sin away that's why they're waiting in paradise waiting for that true blood to come to clear their debt it had been covered by the blood of bulls and goats but they needed one to take it all away so now here was the lord jesus and to me this is the greatest miracle we're a man you think about this a man could subject his whole life be a true prisoner to the word of god to the will of god for his life amen and not just not just um you know not just a promise but the promise of a resurrection no one else had come out of the grave on their own accord before but he went to calvary with psalm 16 as a revelation in his heart and that's why he could say no man takes my life from me i lay it down and i'll raise it back up again i mean because he knew that though he was going to die for the sins of the world he knew he wasn't going to stay in the grave because it had been quickened to him that this was a this is what was going to happen hallelujah so to me that's the greatest miracle where he could fulfill surrender himself to the word that pertained to him samson was an incredible man he would kill a thousand philistines with a jawbone of an ass he'll carry the gates of gaza i think it's actually about 20 miles how far he carried those gates uphill he did incredible things but yet he could not overcome to actually give his whole life to god that that remember he gave his strength to god but his heart to delilah so he could not subject his own passions to the word of god he could not do it none of the prophets could do it we know every man has to fail there's only one man that cannot fail and has not failed that is jesus christ himself every man woman and child has to fail but our god cannot fail now we know that you know our lord jesus though he was he was you know he was born by the virgin birth which bypassed thee but you know bypass the original sin he was still flesh and blood like you and i where the apostle paul would say in hebrews 2 verse 14 for as much soon as the children are partakers of flesh and blood he also he also himself likewise took part of the same that through death he might destroy him that had the power of death that is the devil and deliver them who affair of death were all this lifetime subject to bondage so he'd deliver us from the fear of death we don't need to fear death no more amen for verily he took not on him the nature of angels but he took on him the seed of abraham wherefore in all things that behooved him to be made like unto his brethren he's talking about you in that verse where his brethren that he might be a merciful and faithful high priest in the things pertaining to god to make reconciliation for the sins of the world and that he himself has suffered being tempted he is able to secure them that are tempted so he was tempted on all points yet without sin so every temptation that is actually we have we we we are tempted with he felt that temptation he wasn't immune from those things he didn't live in a bubble right so there was sexual temptation there was all kinds of temptations that actually came against him but though he was tempted amen he knows what it's like to be tempted but he didn't give in to the temptation because there's a big difference to being tempted feeling tempted and then giving into the temptation right but he's saying this here the impossible saying that because he was all he also has suffered being tempted he's able to secure them that are tempted now that words secure there it means to help it means to bring aid amen so if you're being tempted you have a high priest this morning that can bring you aid to give you strength to actually help you to bypass the temptation to overcome that temptation he is not indifferent or he understands exactly what it's like to be tempted right many see the devil tries to twist it in our mind god don't understand what we're going through he knows very well what we go through i mean because he's experienced it he's felt it himself amen so he can he can relate to you and i hallelujah i'm glad we serve a god this morning that can relate to us amen that say lord you know how i feel you've been through this you've walked in these steps before i mean but he can bring aid but we need to we need to call upon him say lord i am going through this temptation i'm going through this this is hard this is drawing me my flesh is being pulled one part of me says no but the other part says yes lord take away the yes part that i can you know help me in this and then he'll bring you in hallelujah amen but we know that our lord jesus i said he had the five same senses as our same and that's to the spirit all those things but yet the only difference is he is virgin born which bypass the original sin so he did not have sin nature within him right see brother brown makes it very clear throughout his ministry he says we are not saved by the blood of a jew jesus was not a jew jesus was not a gentile it was the blood of almighty god it was god made flesh hallelujah that's who he was amen he wasn't he wasn't a jew he wasn't a gentile he was god amen as as he said the breach between the seven church ages the seven seals he says notice this now he must be kinsmen he must be one of us hallelujah i'm glad he's not a different specie amen he's one of us amen see an angel couldn't do it a man couldn't do it it must be a man but it can't be born of a woman a sex sex so the virgin birth the holy spirit overshadowed mary therefore jesus was not a jew jesus was not a gentile jesus was god that's exactly his blood didn't come from any sex act he was the holy created blood of god and we're not saved by jewish blood neither we saved by gentile blood we're saved by the blood of god i mean that's according to the bible it says so now you think about this where the blood of god is the most valuable life upon the earth the most valuable blood you know the royal families they try and protect their bloodlines and all your all different cultures have it because they want to keep their their family pure and high status whatever more and they put great value on those things but the greatest value now that's just carnal humanity trying to be greater than one another right but now if god became a man that blood is the most valuable person upon the earth but you got to think about it whenever you buy something you put the value of what you want to buy at greater value than your money if you valid your money greater than what you're going to buy you won't buy it right because i'd rather save this money because you know just say you got 100 bucks and you want to buy something that's worth 100 bucks but if you think that thing is not worth the 100 you won't buy it but if you think it's worth 100 bucks you'll buy it right because you put greater value on what you're buying than what you possess so god himself with the blood of almighty god put greater value on you than his own life right he valued you above himself that's why he purchased you if he thought you weren't as valid or less valuable than himself he would never have done it right but because he put you at greater value maybe that's why the devil he wants to try and stomp us down saying we're not yo there's nothing to us we're not important you know he tries to make us hate ourselves and think we're not worth and we're full of defects and stuff forget that god said your greater value than me that's what he's declared that's why he died on calvary because you are greater value than himself and he didn't actually in his humanity sure he said not my will but thy will be done but then there's a joy set before him he was excited to make the purchase i mean he's excited too to make the payment to redeem you back to himself hallelujah amen praise god you're i'm so glad that that god has laws the law of redemption is a great law amen because the law of redemption declares that if anything can be redeemed it should be redeemed amen and now i love it our brother braham he you know takes the story of a you know because in the in the old testament law there are certain animals you know the firstborn had to be redeemed had to be redeemed by the blood of the lamb now it didn't matter what condition that animal was in brother brown would say like a baby of a donkey that you know that that that donkey could have cross eyes hanging down ears which apparently means it's no good knobbly knees a funny back and it may be walking like this and can't even look straight and it can be the most miserable looking donkey that there is in existence and maybe that baby maybe look in the mirror and say i'm done for master's going to kill me i'm worth nothing but if mama knew about the laws of redemption she could say no no son or daughter the first born one don't worry there's a lamb that has to be provided for you because god has a law which says you must be redeemed amen so it doesn't matter how nobly your knees are how crippled you are up in sin i mean how troubled you may be in your spirit complexes to here to africa it doesn't matter amen there's still a blood there's still a redemption amen that god paid amen that doesn't matter because we're going to stop looking at you and i we're going to stop looking at ourselves god don't look at you he looks at the lamb i mean god don't examine you he examines the lamb even if we fall and failed you know god knew we'd fall and fail god knew that we had miserably failed he knew it he's not surprising oh why did they go do that no he knew but yet when he died on calvary he saw your entire life and he shed his blood for your entire life not just parts that are doing well but the whole thing i mean he purchased your whole life not just part of it your whole life so the good and the bad the successful you think and the miserable failures all of those things he says i've got blood for that i've got a covering i've got a redemption hallelujah so we can rejoice amen the mother donkey could say don't worry son amen no the master must provide a lamb because it's in the word i mean so you're not going to be examined by the master he's not going to come into this barn and say now look at you and how many hands tally i don't know if they do that for donkeys for horses you know how look at how look at your teeth how well you know how strong whatever no he doesn't look at your performance son he's not looking what you think you are no if he there's a perfect lamb that's what he's gonna look at and there's a perfect lamb hallelujah that will take your place do you know what that cross-eyed knock i'd need not whatever donkey could do he could just rejoice he could let off the pressure saying hallelujah there's a blood i've been redeemed amen my life is not being taken because god is taking care of it hallelujah amen that's the same thing with you and i amen he says it's not what i am who i am it's the perfection of jesus christ and god that died in my place to make me what i am isn't it it isn't whether i can stand i can't it's whether he stood in my place hallelujah and he stood in your place amen he did not he stood on your place he's our representative you know there's there's a lot of great legal cases that go on in the world and the more money people have the better legal teams they get because they don't just want to get some fresh person out of universe that knows nothing about the law they want to pay and they're willing to pay the best because the stakes are so high now you think about the real court of law god's court that's the highest stakes because god's children are in jeopardy i mean because the devil the accuser comes along and he tries to bring his evidence and say great great great lawyer of the uh yo oh oh judge he wouldn't say you're on it because i don't think you'd give that respect to god it'd say on the 13th of whenever 2000 this is what happened and we have video evidence and he'd do all those things because the stakes are high because god no god cannot lose a part of himself and the devil's determined i'm going to get one because if if the devil can get one he's won but he can't get one because god says all the father has given me will come to me and all that come through i'll know why is cast out nothing can pluck them out of my hands but the devil tries as hard as he can to pluck us out of god's hands but he can't do it he may try real good but he can't do it i mean so in god's great court the devil comes along because the stakes are so high now you think about it god could get a great lawyer but he decided no no this is a god size job i'm not going to put it into the hands of a man a mortal man that's been born and sinned and shaped indicated come to all speaking lives to be to be the defendant oh i mean no not the defendant to be the attorney to to be our defense no no he said this is a this is a god size job that means that's why our judge became our attorney hallelujah and if our judge became our attorney case dismissed hallelujah amen so what are you got to worry about amen well the devil's on my case that's good you know why that's good because you've got something that he wants that you're not willing to give him amen that's your life sound bombarded that's fine they're coming into the bombardment just keep walking on with the lord amen the devil's a liar anyway amen we have a perfect lamb this lamb has stood through the test of time amen hallelujah now just as that donkey had a birthright that they are to be redeemed now a birthright means it's a right that you're given by your birth right so you don't earn it you don't you don't acquire it by something you do just because you're born you receive that right that's a birthright right so that donkey baby had a birthright that that had to be redeemed and it wasn't conditional based on their appearance how strong whatever pedigree blah blah none of that it was because of their birth now i'm laboring this because i just want you to realize that a birthright is as an incredible power if you realize it's your right by birth so every human on the planet has a birthright to be redeemed by their natural birth they have a right to be redeemed not by not by their age their their intelligence their parents that there's no condition the only condition is they're born who's been born who's i'm glad some of you were actually birthed by your mother and here you are i don't know how you got here we need a testimony service to because that would be quite a story but you know we've all been born right so we all have a right to be redeemed hallelujah and before we ever realize we have that right our lord jesus already provided a way already paid the price for our redemption hallelujah so therefore we can go to god say god that's my right you've already purchased my salvation lord i want to give myself to you amen irrespective of how crippled up we are in sin spiritually whatever it is how we think about ourselves how much we hate ourselves whatever more we have a right to that perfect lamb who stands in our place amen hallelujah i'm so glad that's the case now now as i said the the greatest miracle to me is that that look our lord jesus subjected himself to the will of god concerning him to be a prisoner i pray that when brother brown preaches the sermon like a prisoner of jesus christ it's not a cliche it's not just a oh you know how he says god is looking for prisoners it shouldn't be a cliche among us actually something that we aspire to say lord make me a prisoner i want to be a full prisoner i don't want to be a part-time home detention kind of prisoner i want to be a full prisoner 24 7. i'm in chains of love amen to your word to you now jesus uh you know you know there came a spot where we're his disciples because they saw the lord in prayer and they said to him teach us how to pray because they saw he had great so much power with god that had never been seen in the earth and so so they were longing say lord teach us to pray how do you how do you commune with your father in heaven and he would say in this in matthew 6 i'm just i'm just kind of coming into uh the midst of it here in verse 8 be be not ye therefore like unto them for your father knows the things you have need of before you ask them hallelujah well why does he want you to ask them because he's the high priest of our profession so he he needs you to move your lips and express it to him though he knows what's going on he knows full well he probably knows details more than you know i i can guarantee that because he knows everything right but you see he needs you to express it to him hallelujah even if you can't exactly put it in words it's your heart's cry that that that that he hears so he says after this manner therefore pray ye our father which art in heaven hallowed be thy name so may the name be glorified lift it up thy kingdom come this is the first thing after you give praise to lord the first thing is thy kingdom come thy will be done in earth as it is in heaven now heaven is run by the word right heaven heaven is is is run by the word and it's governed by divine love right it's a kingdom of divine love now so our lord jesus teaching us to pray may that headship and rulership of divine love the word may come down may that will be done on earth as it is in heaven now when he says in earth to me he's not just speaking of of just the world cosmos he's talking about our earth because god is individual right sure we pray for nations and things going on but but it's our he's interested in you he wants your attention he wants your love he wants to walk and express himself and reveal himself in everyday life to you build a relationship with you so saying thy will they will be done in earth as it is in heaven so the same will is being done in heaven the this is saying that may that same will be expressed in me and this is the first thing that this is the order i know this may be very elementary but you know the thing is there's so many voices in this day there's so many wills being expressed we know ultimately it's only two god and satan right but but there's so many wills being expressed and desires and things and and ambitions and plans and things being projected through all kinds of media whatever more but god god wants us to do his will and so i think it's so important in this day that thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven he did not say that my will be done as an uh you know as a human and i was thinking you know how many times do we go to the lord in prayer with our mind made up already oh we're seeking god's will but really in your heart you've already got how it's going to happen and why and you know you present your case and this is how it should be because we're emotionally invested into something or you know yeah but how many times do we go with our mind made up now i'm i'm specifically really talking about things that you know there's there's some things we know what the father's will is salvation of our family we don't need to pray lord you will be saved because he said there's not willing that any should perish right it's very you know or you know there's there's sickness or the devil's on someone's troubling someone in their mind or those kind of things you know we know what the will of god is for those things that the devil will be cast out i mean that that that healing would come deliverance would come we know that that is god's will right but when it comes to some other things sometimes we have our mind made up already i'm just gonna you know who's you know that feeling hey let's be real honest you know when you've got your mind made up and you want things you know and then and then and then and then here's another like another thing yeah yeah i thought of last night so i don't have any specific examples whenever mine made up oh like you know you want to go on a holiday somewhere of course you want to go on holiday somewhere but is it the lord's will to go or have you got your mind made up already now and then what about if you're asking for something in prayer but you know you could have it anyway so naturally you could get it so you know actually yep you could do that so for example if you had the money to you know buy buy a car or do something you know and you're praying lord shall i buy the car but you know in your heart you can go do it anyway do you already pray just with your mind made up because you can physically do it or do you ask him if it's his will see we've got to go and i'm very much talking to myself we need to pray in such a way that we become neutral and then we ask our petition because it's not because we want his will be done we don't want our will wrapped in some religious jargon and we and we and we present it as his will we need it to be our will or do we pray or approach our lord that we're willing to surrender our own will that his will is done in our lives do we love him enough that we want his will to be done more than to see our own done do we love him enough now see us here in galatians 5 and 6. he says for in jesus christ neither circumcision availeth anything nor uncircumcision but faith which worketh by love now that word availeth it means to have power or force or be strong see saying that there's no strength or power in circumcision or uncircumcision in in jesus christ those things have no power it's got no force behind it but faith worketh by love so there's actually the power or what avails is faith that's working by love so something that worketh it means to be active it means to be efficient so so so faith is active by love right that's when that's when faith really takes a hold is when it works by love amen not by anything else this is how faith is efficient right because he's talking to the galatians they were trying to bring the old testament back in and you know laws and legalism and different things but the apostle paul just just and just in one verse says what you're doing is not going to avail anything you need to realize this faith worketh by love that's the only way that you can have power that's the only way there can be a force in your life is if your faith is working by love amen so that's why i asked the question do you love him enough that you'd be willing to see his own will done more than your own now brother braham says isn't god who's rich in mercy and and christine shared this quote with me the other week i thought such a powerful thing he says a man said to me the other day this is speaking to brother brown i think you're just a fine man mr branham but i believe you're sincerely wrong you're out of the will do you know you'll be condemned at the end and i said look i want to tell you something i'm going to say that you that you would be right just to say for argument's sake if i'm wrong which i don't believe i am but if i was wrong and i knowed right now that i was going to live to be a hundred years old and he was going to condemn me at the end of the road and tell me you don't deserve to come into my heaven william brown get out into outer darkness you know what i would serve him every day of my life until i went anyhow for i have received so much of his unmerited blessings he's more than life to me he's everything that i am hallelujah he says all that i am all i could have ever hoped to be i have derived from his grace and mercy i was wretched miserable poor and blind but by his grace he has healed me i am strong and healthy by the grace of god i have good eyesight i can eat drink have whatever i have need of he never promised to supply my wants but my needs and if i am cast away at that day and know that i cannot see where i would be i mean i mean um i cannot see where i'd be but if i knew i was wrong now listen to this and god chose me to be wrong i would want to stay wrong and because that and because that i want to do his will i love him till i want his will to be done now that's a big statement but i hope you get it in the way of the spirit that i set it in i see i want to do his will can we come to that place that that that that if we knew at the end of our road we would we would be cast away would you still serve him would you still love him because you've received so much of you know so much received of his unmerited blessings into your life you know i had an experience this is when i was a real real early christian and and um you know the devil came to me um after i was uh messaging back into and from with my sister about some things and and she said she was helped by it and answered her questions whatever more but then but then the devil came to me and he twisted the scripture about if you sin willfully there's no there's no blood for you i'm just there's not verbatim but you know the scripture says that if there's if you sin willfully you know you know there's basically no more blood for you and he twisted it in my in my head that it's like a child where you tell them not to do something and they do it anyway then they're wrong they say that's the same thing with that so your bible says do a certain thing you don't do it then there's no more blood for you and you're lost and and my heart sunk like a lead balloon and i just read the supernatural series where brother graham's telling billy paul um you know i think they were out washing the car and you know billy paul was smoking and doing those things and you know you know the sun's shining on them and he says to billy paul you know put your hands out like this and then and then behind them was because of the shadow there's a there's a t junction and he says billy paul you're in the middle you're at the intersection you're going to make up your mind are you going to go with god or you're going to go with the world you can't do both and um and and and i said to the lord lord i burned every bridge i might just put a hand down i have nowhere to go into the world i can't go back there there's nothing back for me there you know i'm i'm just gonna keep walking with you and and i said to him i said lord even if i am lost at least i get a opportunity at the end of all things to stand before you and say to you face to face i love you then you can cast me to hell if you want you know but are we willing are we willing to want his will just like the prophet said if he knew that god chose him to be wrong that he would stay wrong because he just loves that he wants his will done he says i want to do his will i ask him for something sometime he shakes his head no i just rejoice so much as if he said yes because we always ought to ask thy will be done his nose if it's his will that's just it's a whole lot better than his yeses if it's his will to do it then that's when you really love him amen see that's when you really love him when he says no you rejoice in the no if it's his will if he says yes you rejoice in the yes you just you just want to see his will done amen he says that's when you really love him he says i get to talking about him i just can't stop oh he's so real so real to me friends he's all that i am all i ever could be all i expect to be is grounded in christ jesus the word amen so so do we love him enough see jesus was a prisoner to the word and he's our example we want to be like jesus but but are we do we love god enough that our own ambitions are put to one side do we love god enough that our own plans can be put to one side do we love him enough that if he says no though we know we could get it if we wanted we could get what we asked for and but he says no do we love him enough to actually accept the no that we just want his will to be done do we love him enough that if we do get cast away at the end we would serve him anyway because we've received so many blessings on this side hallelujah we received so many blessings god poured himself in time after time amen saved us amen redeemed us healed us when we're sick guide us when we are lost we're troubled in mind he brought peace amen we're unstable he brought stability amen he's done so much to us hallelujah poured himself out time and time again amen so many unmerited blessings he has given us hallelujah amen the apostle paul would say that he is a prisoner of jesus christ to me that's an incredibly powerful statement when you look at the apostle paul's life it wasn't a life of flowery beard of ease he didn't just climb up some ivory tower and write some letters to the churches because he was because he felt like it he had a very hard rugged christian life i mean it wasn't a life of ease he was shipwrecked and beaten and had to run he'd have a meeting in one city people would raise up against him he'd run to the next city start having a revival those same people would chase into the next city start causing trouble and you know he'd be in prison he'd be beaten he'd be all kinds of things against him trouble within without within the church without the church all kinds of things you know he'd be chained to a roman guard but yet but yet he didn't let that dead man hinder him i mean for god to to pour in most of the new testament into his life amen even the apostle paul you think about him he had such a burden to get the word out he had such a burden that that this grace that had come to the gentiles it must be declared to the gentiles he was like a burning torch like a dry house on a windy day that's burning up he just couldn't help it and so no doubt no wonder in his humanity he'd say if wherever an open door is he'd want to go but yet he was such a prisoner to his own you know he was such a prisoner to god that when the lord when the spirit forbid him to do his own will he surrendered to it to me that's an incredible thing when because it was his will where's the open door let's go here you know because the spirit forbid him to go preach in asia it wasn't time yet he could have gone he had the opportunity but yet and then carnally you'd think but the churches could be found at eternal life's going to come to people the devil is going to be cast out but it wasn't the lord's timing to do it and because he was such a prisoner in the hands of god he'd say lord if you don't want me to go i'm not going amen to me that's an incredible thing can we can we be the same kind of people i believe i'm looking at the same material as the apostle paul right here the bride of christ right i believe i'm looking at the same peoples this is not unobtainable but are we prisoner enough do we love the lord enough amen he says oh god this is from um paul the prisoners in 1963 oh god make us prisoners like that from our own selfish ambition and from our own judgments and our better way of thinking to a prisoner of jesus christ i think it's a great statement i am a prisoner to jesus christ and remember he's the word seed no matter what anyone else thinks it's the word if you're a prisoner to the word no denomination can sway you from it it's the word you're a prisoner to it that's all you must act the way it acts amen now i he could not go to certain places that he wanted see the spirit verbatim you remember many times paul was trying to get to some place thinking there there is where i have a great meeting but the spirit would forbid him now does that clearly state and prove that paul was a prisoner a prisoner to jesus christ harnessed to his word by the spirit he says oh i like that he was bound he was bound by a chain and by fetters of love to do the will of god and that only he was a prisoner he was in fetters of love he was in a yoke with christ he could yoke up with nothing else he was yoked with him and where the law and where the lead went that's where he'd go regardless of how green the pastor was here on this side or on that side he had to go the way the leader and the yoke went oh tonight if we branham tabernacle could only become prisoners i could say osha kind of tabernacle this morning remember he's preaching this in 1963 they've had over decades of of supernatural god moving the son of man being revealed by the stage the seals are open and now he's saying if we could only come to this if we could only become prisoners to our own selfish being to our own ambition that we can completely surrender ourselves and be yoked to him no matter what the rest of the world thinks what the rest of the world does we're yoked with fetters of love we're prisoners my feet are so yoked with christ i won't dance my eyes are so yoked to christ till when i see these mons striptease on the street i turn my head my heart is so yoked and loved to him till i can't have love for this world anymore my will is so yoked to him till i don't even know what my ambitions are just wherever you lead i'll follow lord i'll be a prisoner see amen can we come to that place can we be full prisoners to our lord jesus christ because we love him so not because it's a duty or something is expected of us but because we love him remember faith worketh by love love is the force behind faith they they they bind hand in hand amen if you don't have divine love faith can't work right but we want faith to have her free course to take over right we want to be governed by perfect faith amen not by a carnal faith or a human faith but perfect faith living in our lives amen where god can sow just come pour himself in that it's now his character being formed in us like never before amen because remember he's looking for his character he's looking for his own nature and a people now i'm saying all this because we've got a perfect lamb right so i'm not saying because many times thinking well how can this happen no it takes a full surrender and a consecration a dying daily amen he says in doors of the door so this has gone a bit heavy but here we are he says now jesus when he was on earth he knew that the scripture pertained to him when he said you destroyed this body i raised up in three days the prophet had already said i'll i will not suffer my holy one to see corruption neither will i leave his soul in hell he knew that scripture pertained to him for he was the messiah and he knew it he his unfailing faith put him in position to know that he was the perfect born son of god if your faith will put you in position to know that every divine promise of god's bible is for you just as sure as that pertained to him every promise pertains to you that's what our faith does it's not maybe you'll get it no no your faith puts you in that position that every divine promise is yours right now hallelujah that's what god so your healing the salvation your freedom from sin and from selfishness and from your indifference and your little turtle shell that you pull yourself up into you know when i read that i just put it crab shell because i'm born in july you know and unfortunately that thing still is around from time to time but i've got to die out to it and get out of the shell again that's true yes help me lord so you know god wants to come in and be lord and ruler and to set you free from these things but you won't do it it's to fulfill the scriptures that they'd be lukewarm and they are now notice this is not personally to anyone just as the holy spirit will point it to you so it's not just it's to you amen but notice now it's just the word the people today they don't want to open their hearts to those things they don't want to believe it or they try to apply it somewhere else or to somebody else knowing uh knowing not that it's for you you say well wait a minute brother abraham i spoke in tongues 10 years ago that's very fine but what is christ to you today see it's great that you have experiences years ago but what about who is he to you today amen are you seeing his marvelous powers does he still bring the same thrill does something go through you when you see his mighty hand begin to move and sinners be converted does it bring you to all night prayer does it bring you to fasting does it send you to the altar quickly to work with someone to instruct them how to come through to the holy spirit does it warm your heart to go into the neighborhood and seek out the lost do you speak to the milkman to the media man to the man on the street those things that they go that they're going to accompany that experience that you received long ago something's happened and he says this you pushed him out the door but god wants your heart so have we come to a place where he still thrills us he still means more than life to us amen when we see his hand come upon someone and save them it just it just makes our world makes our weak amen that's the thing we want to see us we want but but what what motivates that love motivates that amen because we know that we've experienced the love of god and his love came upon us so we want to see the love of god expressed to someone else hallelujah so amen i trust that we can we can look into look into our own lives and say lord i'm a prisoner to you amen i am your prisoner that is not my will but thy will be done hallelujah now i'm sorry this is kind of i feel like we're having better scrambled eggs this morning but it's if we can lay aside our own ambitions and keep them aside like the impossible said i die daily so it's whatever we want we put it there and say god what do you want what do you want in my life today remember he only wants good he wants the best for us right he's not here to remember he's not an angry father that's looking for when we trip up to to to deal with us he's not that kind of a god he's a god that if we fall he wants it all he wants to do you know how you have kids and they fall over to hurt themselves all you want to do is pick them and check them over see how they are and if they need a plaster they get a plaster or they need a cold cold uh cold pack they get a call back you put them on the couch you make sure they're okay who i trust you're that kind of parents you know but you want to make sure they're fine you know you just say you'll walk it off you'll be all right but your first your first concern your first concern is are they okay and that's god to us we fall in sin something happens we fail our whatever he he wants a jig are you okay i want to pick you up i want to guide you so you can bypass this again that you don't walk back into the same thing but you keep going that's that's how he wants but you know do we love him enough to let him do it he's not an angry god he's not an angry father he's a loving father a man he's a loving god that just wants the best for us amen now i'm gonna well i'm gonna read this and then and then we're gonna probably wrap up but you know brother harold hildebrand made a statement and and um he said that you your your your life the life you live is your revelation so what your revelation is is manifested in your life so if you know the lord loves you it will be manifested in your life if you think he doesn't love you if you if you then you always be afraid of him but if you're like jesus manifested as revelation he knew he was the son of god he knew was he to take away the sins of the world he knew that though he would have to go in the grave he'd come out again right his life manifested that revelation now we're here i've probably come a very long way around to this point but we are here to fulfill scripture right we're here to fulfill a rapture we're here to fulfill that everything god is you'll pour into us that when he looks down at you and i he'll see his own character and a people we're here to fulfill that scripture but i i pray it's been revealed to you that that's what you're here for amen it's not maybe i'll get it no no you're here to fulfill that you know i remember the first um the first uh uh convention i ever went to was up in auckland and and brian got baptized there i think it's the first time every bit brother had it there and you know 2009 and brother harold was there and he preached a sermon and one of his opening scriptures was you know that that from from ephesians 1 and 5 having predestinated unto us the adoption of children by jesus christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will so when he read that it just anchored in my heart that i've been predestinated unto the adoption we know that adoption is the placing of children by jesus christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will so my destiny has been predetermined i'm going to come into my position in christ right that that was that was what was revealed to me and it doesn't matter what comes that's going to happen so the devil may fight there's my own self i've got to die yo this thing sort of stayed dead my own humanity remember our biggest enemy is ourselves right so all that may raise up but but god says this is where you ultimately end up hallelujah so it blessed me to realize that my destiny is predetermined that i will that because of his good pleasure i will come to my position in the body and the final part of that adoption is the change of our body because it says in romans 8 and 23 not only they but ourselves also which have the first fruits of the spirit even we ourselves grown within ourselves waiting for the adoption to wit the the redemption of our body so the whole the final process of adoption is the body change amen so now if that's been revealed that's where i'm going to end up hallelujah so now i'm just talking to myself i pray my life manifest that revelation right hallelujah so now when i say about a prisoner because remember he is he is he is um he's looking for prisoners today and he's already made us that we can be prisoners to him right so i pray that our it's actually revealed to us we are his prisoner irrespective of where you feel you are in your christian walk and how much you see your humanity no if it's revealed to you i'm a prisoner of jesus christ then the life within you will begin to manifest that revelation will begin to live out that is not my will but his will be done hallelujah and it says in ephesians one and six and and and i will finish with this to the praise of his glory of his grace when he has made us accepted in the beloved amen so how does he make us accept it by providing a perfect lamb amen and that's where i got into the story of the of the donkey being redeemed he's made us accepted in the beloved he's given and he's done that by providing a perfect lamb so remember look at your lamb and what he has done for you and then i pray when you see that remember god doesn't look at you he's looking at the lamb so you can have all kinds of troubles all kind of things going on but god is looking to the lamb and because he is accepted we are accepted amen so now we can go to and say lord i want to be your prisoner i want to be a prisoner like jesus my the lover of my soul my messiah my king as he as he subjected his own flesh to the will of god concerning his life he could subject these five senses and his spirit remember he could subject that to the will of god the word of god lord i want to be like that because i love you i just want to see your will done whatever that will is you can cast me aside i want to serve you because you've done so much for me i just want to if i'm wrong and you want me wrong i want to stay wrong because i want your will to be done that's what the prophet said amen so god's looking for prisoners in 2022. to his word by the bonds of love and faith worketh by love so if that love ever if you ever feel that love leak out of your heart say lord pour your love back into me may i serve thee because i love thee not because it's expected of me not because of some duty but because i love you and then if your faith is working by love you just see it explode and take off amen our love of god how rich and pure how measureless and strong amen let's have the musicians this morning hallelujah let's be prisoners friends maybe i'm just preaching to myself this morning i don't know but i want to be more surrendered there's more of him to have there's lots of chambers in our hearts let's just open
