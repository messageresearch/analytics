um bless the service this morning thank you for the atmosphere that's here thank you for the worship Lord um thank you for the ministry bless brother Andy for the song service this morning bless brother Ben Lord is his ministering maybe somewhere this morning too Lord we just thank you so much for your grace and mercy to us we just commit the service to you in Jesus name amen am amen praise the Lord just while you're standing let's just um let's turn to the scriptures thank you musicians thank you let's um turn to the scriptures um I've got Romans 16: 25- 26 could you just bring that up on to the screen here Romans 16: 25-26 it's not on my slide it's just a scripture I want to read before I start it says now to him that is of power to establish you according to my gospel and the preaching of Jesus Christ according to the revelation of the mystery which was Kept Secret since the world began but now is made manifest by the scriptures of the prophets according to the Commandments of the Everlasting God made known to All Nations for The Obedience of faith and the last verse to God only wise be glory through Jesus Christ forever amen am amen may God bless his word you can take your seats this morning amen good morning how are you all doing good I'm doing good this is like catching up with old friends you know having a nice conversation you know when you when you come up here it's it's not like you don't want to just get into it but you kind of just got to catch the atmosphere for a while and just see where the spirit is and just kind of settle in maybe it's a human thing but there's a you know there's an atmosphere in places and there's a there's a connection in spiritual Realms there just things that that are happening you know and we we walk and think that we're natural beings but we're actually supernatural beings we're Spiritual Beings you know you're all very Spiritual Beings this morning so so we try and just just get into that atmosphere this morning not like just a natural atmosphere where we talk about the weather we talk about this and that and the other thing we actually want to get into a spiritual atmosphere and just catch thank each other's spirits and I think you all have warm Spirits like you know when people would come into the prayer line with brother brandom he would say you're a Christian I sense a warm Spirit about you yeah and we all have warm Spirits I believe this morning so there's there's an atmosphere here and and and sometimes you know it's interesting the things that you sometimes if you come up and speak at the ppit it's interesting the things that you say sometimes because there's an there's an anointing here and often times I think I wonder if I'm thinking the right thing and I I think I I when I'll try and say it when I'm up there and see if it comes out and if generally if it comes out it's usually if you're led by the spirit of God it's the it's the right thing you know we're not always perfectly correct in everything we do but you know some of the things that get set up here are actually super they're more than Supernatural and there's prophecies and there's things that speak directly like when I think we spoke about I think it was Deborah one time you I saw a saw a name it just something was that happening at that moment you know the name was spoken I don't know if Deb remember members us too she was playing the the piano one time and we we um after service we called up brother Ian hmer to pray he was here for that weekend and Midway through his prayer Deborah started playing the steadfast love of the Lord never ceases she was playing one song then she stopped and went to the other song and I think brother Ian maybe passed away two months after that or something um but you know that was for Years the song I had for brother I was that song the steadfast love of the Lord never ceases it was and I think I told him one time this is the song for you his Mercy's never coming to an end and you know just there was an atmosphere when it started to be played on the piano as he was praying she knew nothing of the song and that and I think a few weeks ago there's something for brother Ben you know scripture was spoken and there something just said that's for brother Ben Bailey you know and then it you just so that's the God we serve he's a supernatural God this morning amen I feel a good atmosphere amen um so the I had another idea that I was going to speak about that I've been working on for a while and it it wasn't really working for this one so the um the the thought that I had this morning was a secret a secret and I couldn't get away from this thought and often when you you know when you start getting it together I I I look into it and I think man I could I'm not going to get five minutes out of this thought you know and then and then as you're going on and just looking into the different things about it you think man I don't know how I'm going to squeeze this in to to about 55 minutes or an hour you know and and it's turned out I've just got to skim across it now there's there's there's a lot in it wonderful but the idea is a secret do you children know what a secret is you know what a secret is it's one of those things that you say to your friend this is a secret I'll tell you but don't tell anyone else hey and then that person says to someone else I got a secret I'll tell you but don't tell anyone else and they're just just goes around yes yeah it's not really a secet it was never a secret to begin with cuz you just say don't tell anyone else but I'll tell you the secret and they just tell other people that same thing that's true but there are secrets hallelu and the secret of something that is not known or seen or not meant to be known or seen can I just drop something else in there ton is good to see you here when I was when I was uh you know we had the church in giz and then we came here and there were three people I told Sister Louise the other day there were three people that something about those three people just did something in here and I thought they were very good people and I always had a special little place for them one was um Sharon Marriott one was Louise Maloney and one was tonyan and I said to Louise the other day I I just pointed out hey look two of you are here now and and um the funny thing is that the ppit that was there is this one here I thought I'll say that up under the anointing and see if it comes out came out okay so now back to our thought God that of the secret now the things of God God's a secret he's actually a secret although you can see him everywhere if you look he's actually God is actually in reality God is a secret work okay you know what I'll try this one secret secret secret yeah maybe I disconnect that one and not try this one try this click oh man Back to Basics okay I just need to read it off here though that's the thing okay all right it is no secret what God can do so now God Jesus when he was here speaking about God being a secret even though he spoke openly the things he were talking about were actually a secret you couldn't just catch them they were there's something inside that that was a secret you know and he said um Jesus it says at that time Jesus answered and said I thank thee oh Father Lord of Heaven and Earth because thou has hid these things from the wise and prudent and has revealed them unto babes he's saying so he's got this ability to he keeps these things as secret to certain people then he reveals it to other people that's the way that this word is and that's the way that God operates he's a lot of the things that there are secret another time he said blessed art thou Simon Jonah for flesh and blood has not revealed this secret to you but my Father which is in heaven he said God's decided to show you this little secret it was his and and he thought I'll tell Peter who I am Peter I'm the Son of God now and Peter heard the secret somehow okay but that's the way that God operates and here he says that seeing they may see and not perceive and hearing they may hear and not understand understand cuz they weren't actually told the secret although they heard it they didn't actually hear the secret lest at any time they should be converted by hearing this little secret of God well big secret of God and their sins should be forgiven here he says no man can come to me except the Father which has sent me draw him that's right and I'll raise him up at the last day so saying you can't really even go to God unless God Reveals His little secret and something in your heart decides that you want God but that's just God revealing his secret to you I've got a lot to get through so I'm going to go reasonably fast but we understand that faith in itself then is a secret it it this this concept of Faith it's not just something you can just wake up in the morning and I just want to have faith it's the the ability to have faith is actually a revelation it's God revealing something to you and then you something in you goes yes I believe that and then you walk towards whatever that thing was that you heard right right that's that's how it works you don't you it doesn't work the other way around where you suddenly decide I'm going to believe something it's God has to reveal to you something first maybe it might be you're a sinner am I I am yes okay there must be a solution for this problem I have then and Faith starts to try and find a solution to that secret that God's revealed but if that was never shown to them as a TR as a revelation they wouldn't you wouldn't we wouldn't act on it see so faith in itself is actually a revelation you you have to get revealed something to have faith in it that's how it works he says what is it he's talking about faith that's a revelation what is faith is God by the spirit Spirit revealing to you something he's going to do or he's promised then that's the church that God built upon the rock that the gates of hell can't Prevail against it so that's God's true means of operating is actually by showing you the secret of himself and that's that's the gospel that's Christianity it's not a natural thing where we hear it go yeah I believe I I I think I understand that and we just carry on acting in in our own minds it's actually a there's an element to it that is Supernatural That's either there or it's not that's how this gospel works now brother BR talks about Abel and he says and Abel rolled him up a rock and made him a church or worship place but when Abel came here by faith he said Faith isn't something that's an imaginary thing I want you to get it faith is a direct Revelation am see if you only accept Christ you say if you're by an intellectual you haven't got it yet you cannot say that Jesus is the Christ until the Holy Spirit has revealed it to you see the intellectual Faith oh if I could only get that one point right now to go down home in every heart I'm thankful for this place possession right now see if you can only see this you'll see the greatest thing you've seen in years you want to see the greatest thing you've seen in years you're seeing it look not because I'm standing here saying it but if you can understand how it is that faith is not something mentally perceived but it is a revelation a revelation of God by faith not intellectual but by his heart he's saying it's God showing his secret right now this is just a little picture it's quite an extreme picture but yet this is the first example of a an intellectual perception of God and actually God revealing a secret that they another way and this is a perfect example of the two operating because Cain just thought okay God's a good god yes he made us and I grew this fruit and I'll just offer it to God and they were both worshiping God but they both the their modes of operation were very different their approach to God was different because one was based on I think this is a good idea and I I want to worship God this way another one had this Revelation and he worshiped a different way so so this now played out in our real life you know and and this has what we contend with on a daily basis in the Christian world is this sort of stuff here right it's it's not a hard thing to understand it's just this is just how it works you know so it just carries on and on and on so the the same the same attitude that Cain had towards Abel and Cain had towards God it was me when Jesus was here on Earth he met the same attitude of these intellectual people thinking they knew God worshiping the very God that they say they worship yeah that's how far intellectual Faith could get them they killed the very person they say they worship that shows you how far off that that we cannot perceive god without God revealing to us the secret and and when you carry on you get to this sort of predicament where your perception of God this one on the here the perception of God is and an intellectual Faith would be when I get there I'm going to see a father on the throne then I'm going to see a son Jesus sitting next to him then I'm going to I'm going to see a holy spirit flying around that was where the natural perception would take us but but when we are sh on the secret we realize that no I'm actually only going to see one being which is the image of the invisible God which is Christ that's who I'm that's who's going to be there so we end up in two different places based on our intellectual perception or the Revelation that's why you know Peter was said the Revelation uh be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ because he knew this is that was the name of the father son Holy Ghost so that was that was God revealing his secrets to Peter and not everyone else that goes down that road they've just thought about it and thought this could be correct right I like when brother um Bean said when he you know when we try and maybe find a new song to sing if we we we we look up and send a link to it and it sort of looks like this you know some sort of like a rock concert sort of set up and one day he said you know it's like offering you know and and it's true and I thought that was a good example because you look in the beginning when Cain came he had this perception of who God was and he just offered this nice beautiful thing but Abel offered the lamb he killed this lamb and the lamb bleeded and he offered he offered that because he knew by Revelation life has to die in order for me to live and it was a messy thing it was a gruesome thing it was It was kind of weird you know it was all Kane Kane's little church service over there was was a lot Morey than H sorry Abel's church service over there was a lot more messier than kan's one was you know kan's was well polished his fruit was maybe grown really nice but but you get the scenario here where you get a contrast and one has just an intellectual understanding of another one is the secrets of God have been showing to people so that they can actually approach God the right way amen now if brother BR says here I've got a lot of quotes is that right okay now I think thanks bro now you know me that I only have a grammar school education I know nothing of psychology I know nothing about Medics I know nothing about the anatomy I only thing I know I love the Lord Jesus Christ with all my heart that's all I know I'm uneducated illiterate and I have no abilities of my own not even a normal personality that's right but I know one thing and I'm thankful for that I know how to submit myself that Jesus Christ can work through me that's he said I'd rather have that than all your educ that there is in the world up here I'd rather know how to submit myself to the spirit of God and say Lord here I am I'd rather have that secret in my heart than have the secret of every hydrogen and atomic bomb in the world or could be made for it's more powerful than all the atomic bombs that could be thought of so under his Everlasting wings I take my refuge tonight so saying of the two options if I could have all this information here or just God revealing a secret to me that I could submit to him here I'd rather take that yeah okay and that's the road that we go down is we want the secrets of God to be revealed to us now that then that then brings us to this place when when God starts to reveal himself to us that gets us to this place called the secret place CU then then there is this because there's a secret God that's revealing Secrets there's then a secret place that you can go to to have communion you all know what I'm talking about the secret place you know it's just that it's that secret place with God and he said and and brother Brown said say brother sister there is a secret place that every belie believer should go the backside of the desert there in those sacred Sands oh no doctor of theology no Greek or Hebrew scholar no school or seminary that might twist you all up in these kind of things but if you ever met God on those sacred sand Satan can't put his feet on them Sands you know you met God something real what was it you talk to God yourself you had an experience you went into that secret place with God where Satan can't go there amen he can go in this place he he he dwells in this other place and all these rock concerts and stuff like that that's where he dwells but he doesn't dwell in the secret place but listen to a still Small Voice every one of you people who profess to be Christians don't uh get yourself quiet before him don't let the washing hinder don't let the work hinder don't let nothing hinder don't let nobody know what you are doing just go before him get up in the woods somewhere get out on the side of the road go into the secret closet and close the door when the kids get at school they get down on your knee hallu you've heard all kinds of voices everywhere more so on this day but just get down and stay there until those voices are silenced and you begin to lift up it'll change you it'll make you different like it did to this little Samuel it'll do something to you if you'll just do it now it'll make you what you should be it'll make you the kind of Christian that you ought to be right so that's the secret to living an overcoming Christian life is to get in the secret place and let God reveal his secrets to you and it just changes you now it's hard to explain it's kind of not really explainable just like he said there's a piece that passes all understanding you can't tell them tell people this is how the peace works and I'll work it out for you because it doesn't it's not intellectually understandable And yet when we get in that secret place with God we just have some sort of peace from somewhere somehow you don't have to explain it but it happens brother B says did you ever walk out in the morning in that real fresh cool morning God has refreshed as Earth fragrance did you ever go down to a rose and he said down at by place they got a lot of honeysuckles the honeysuckle don't smell much along In the Heat of the day when it's all hustle and bustle he said but it's early in the morning when all the air has been purified then that Aroma of the Honeysuckle and he Likens it he says let a man be out fussing fighting stewing with his mind and just he says you'll never get much Aroma from that of the Gospel the gospel won't come out of that it's just all worked up and all the sort of carryon but let him get alone one time in the Stillness of God every man that comes to the pilit ought to dwell alone first then comes the fruits yielding forth its fruits every man that stays in the presence of God into this great secret place hid away will yield the fruits of righteousness peace love joy long suffering goodness gentleness patience don't fuss about these other things all up here get that in your life and you'll never get that until you hide away with God into that land of adoption into the secret place but that's what's that's what belongs to us yes I got one I got this one here I want to read this why do you hunger Church why do you thirst it's the father trying to reveal this hidden secret to you God's there wanting to reveal to us all of his Secrets amen amen but you let so many things get it out of you you know in terms of it distracts you to find other secrets that are worthless secrets to know you let your job you let your wife let your husband you let your children you let the cares of this world you let some Pastor you let somebody else get that out of you when you know that way down in your heart you're thirsting hungry it's God trying to reveal to you see the Revelation the last day is here he's got so many secrets for us now more so than he ever has before he's revealing more secrets to his people now than he ever has he's got so many secrets to just reveal amen and another thing about the secret is actually in this time there's a secret of the end time like I just said there there are secrets now that he's saying well this is the time I'm going to reveal all my secrets amen and he's he he's made it public and yet only those that are part of his will actually receive these secrets that's why he said here but thou oh Daniel shut up the words and seal up the book even unto the time of the end don't tell these secrets yet I've got a People AR going to tell all these secrets to many shall run to and fro and knowledge shall be increased and he say say surely the Lord God will do nothing but he Reveals His secrets to unto a servants the prophets yes and then they Minister those Secrets God tells God told Paul a lot of Secrets and then he said Paul Minister this All Through the Ages he's told people secrets and this is where we're at now but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery of God should be finished all his secrets are going to be told as Heath declared to his servants the prophets and we've had a um messenger that's come here to tell all the secrets of God and he and he he says this he says now God's secret mystery he had before the world began now back in the back part of God's mind there was something that he was trying to and was going to Chief and he had a motive in doing it in order to let himself be expressed his he said God way back they had the secret in this plan and I'm going to tell you what the plan is that's what he told us I'm going to tell you what God's plan is this great Eternal guy way back before anyone was here and he said you know what his plan is his plan is to express himself completely to man amen to to come down as God in Christ to show that I'm one of you to to be understandable not to be this God that fills all time of space but to actually become a man the great God I I'll become like you and he said the second thing was to have Liberty and to dwell in them and express himself through them to that they would be submitted to me like Paul says Paul a prisoner of Jesus Christ that they could be they they could subdue their flesh and I could dwell in them and I could have a liberty to live through them and the third thing was to restore the kingdom back to the way it was when Adam was here restore back to that I've got this plan and I'm going to achieve that plan amen I want to read you this because this is this is powerful look what was once God's Great secret great mysterious Secret in his mind is now put into the hearts of the belever that is the body of Christ what was God's once great Secret in his mind before the foundation of the world is now made manifest he's revealing his secrets to us think of it friend oh I'm sure we don't we don't get it well I I can't see it the way I ought to and I'm sure that you don't but God's great mystery what the Eternal God had as a mystery has now been unfolded in Jesus Christ and given right down to his church amen what was once in God's mind is now in the body of Christ Jesus making love to the Church his bride Whispering secrets to her you know how you tell your wife or your husband things you know the little girl that you're going to marry you love her so much you just tell her the secrets to get her up next to you and love you and everything you know what it is that's what God Christ is doing to the church he is letting her know the secrets just the secrets not these flirters I mean his wife amen by having the revelation of a secret made known to them by his grace how the grace of God and the last one here says people I know I hope you don't think this personal to a bunch of people he's saying I hope you think it's not just for a little group he says God is sharing it with the whole church with he's trying to share it with everyone but not everyone will receive it he says if they would just receive it see it doesn't mean just me or just you it means the church and he is trying to get it to get it and you say well why don't they receive it he said they can't receive it he said again he said these things and how could they because oziah said they can't see it seeing they won't see it hearing they won't perceive it right so it's just it's even though he's put it out there it's public it's it's not this little cult that it's just for us no it's for anyone here it all is it's all open and and brother Brown said now did you notice before he was going to reveal the great unfold The Mystery of the seven cells which actually unlocks the whole word of God it just opens everything up before he was going to do that he said do you notice there was a there was a he said there was a mysterious light showed up in the heavens which was a cloud and even the the public the Science magazine there I think it was quite fitting that their title was a high Cloud a ring of Mystery yeah what's this mystery this is all a mystery that's right it's a mystery that's being revealed it it was a mystery and and then he said after that happened then he said he sent me back to at that time to and said that that it's time to break open the seals and to to minister the to reveal the word of God reveal my things I've had hidden it's time to reveal that now in doing that God showed Who We Are yeah in Christ and and all all that pertains to us but also in doing that he showed who the enemy was so while he revealed the secrets of who we are he actually revealed the secrets of who the enemy is and what he's up to and what what he's been scheming now when you reveal the secrets of someone's secret plan they generally don't like you very much Satan had the secret plan that he was working and scheming and and he had the church all bound up and he was winning and then someone came and revealed all the secrets I can guarantee you he's going to be very upet with that little new unfolding that new that new thing that's happened so don't be surprised when you get all this all this nonsense against the the revealed word just coming at it from every direction because Satan's upset right I want to go just to I just talk about that talk about people being upset because they reveal Secrets who knows this guy was um not snow it was the other dude um uh jul Julian Assange someone watches the news Australian guy so he had a website called Wikileaks and he would get different information and a a contractor for the US military that had had access to a lot of uh secret information thought that the secret information needed to be exposed because he thought that what the government were doing were wrong so I'm going to expose these secrets and so he went to this guy and he said he got all the data and he gave it to this guy to publish on his website and and one of the one of the things that the videos they published were this was Iraq you know it was a video of the the American soldiers basically just they just killed all these guys it was essentially it was just murder you know they they didn't have any guns they thought they might have these two of them were journalists and it was just a routine operation and they just murdered all these guys and it was kind of a bit of a joke you know yeah we got them good shooting John you know and then you know guys are trying to run away they're just getting mowed down by these Apache helicopters and machine guns and then they you know and this other guy he's he's crawling along and they're saying they they've got their gun on him and they're saying oh there's a guy crawling away uh pick up a gun man pick up a gun they want him to do something so they can shoot him because they have to at least have some reason but he he he just stays here and then a van pulls up and starts to load the wounded up and they get permission to shoot the van or shoot everyone in the van as well so just blast the van and there's kids in the van and all sorts it's basically murder right and so this man is seeing the stuff and he's saying well I got to get this out cuz I mean there I know war is war but there then there's murder there's a There are rules you can't just go and murder people so so then he publishes this but because he's published all of these secrets the US government doesn't like him anymore you know you've published all my secrets and we don't like you and so he had to he had to get and going hiding and and try and escape and uh they brought up some bogus charges some girl in Sweden said that he raped her which was just a bogus one and he knew it was they were only doing that to get him in custody and when they were in custody that the US government was going to file charges and then have them extradited to the US and lock them up and throw away the key sort of scenario that he knew that's what was happening so instead of facing these charges of rape he took refuge in the Ecuadorian Embassy in in the UK and they they sort of granted him uh uh and yeah because these these these embassies are kind of like it's it's a separate country within a country so the the the UK police can't walk into the embassy because they're essentially going into Ecuador it would be an act of War right so so they said you can stay in the embassy indefinitely so he was there from 2012 to about 2019 s years he lived in a room in the embassy and this is how much the people were upset the government was upset the the the British government had police police wait outside this many police for 2 and 1 half years they waited outside in case the guy tried to come out and Escape I think they spent about 122 million guarding the place after about 2 and a half years the public was saying come on team you've spent 125 million on this guy just don't worry about it you know say but they had these guys waiting day and night out the front in case this guy tries to get away they there was somebody very upset that this guy gave away their secrets they were going to go to any and at the same time another guy this guy Snowden he maybe a year after that he actually he worked for the he was a contractor for the NSA and he he gave out this information to show that you know the government was spying on the on not just foreign governments but on all their own people and they were gathering data essentially saying what we all knew was everything on your phone is recorded they had access to all the servers and they're just basically nothing is private it's all going to them even though they say no no we can't do that New Zealand was all involved with this because it was a five eyes countries it was all just so he exposed all of this and and so now they're after this guy as well there the US government were after Edward Snowden and so he he released the documents when he was in Hong Kong then his plan was to go to South America to a friendly country there and and maybe live there but I think he went he was going Hong Kong Russia and then down to Ecuador was a Transit flight but when he by the time he got to Russia the US government had gotten on to him that it was this guy that leaked all the information and they canceled his passport where while he was in Russia so he's in Russia and and and the Russian government you know they go to scan his passport and they realize this passport has been canceled so so now um Assange is going to help this guy he says okay well we can we'll try and get a a a a president of a friendly country in South America we'll try and fly you out on their plan because you won't get out using normal channels now of public transport but but foreign governments and their presidents they can fly in with immunity and sort of they didn't have to you know go under the same so they but they knew that everything they were doing was being listened to so they were formulating a plan but they were formulating it with another uh uh another country but they said it was the Bolivia they said when they were talking that they said it's Bolivia that we're going to use the Bolivian president's plane and he's going to come in and pick you up and and take you away but it wasn't the Bolivian president's playing it with someone else but they just threw a bit of a decoy so then the Bolivian president flies to Russia for some oil meeting starts flying back home and because the government US government have been Eve dropping and all these calls they said I think snowden's on that plane so they rung up uh France Spain Italy and said there's a plane coming deny them access to your airspace and so the these countries denied their plane access and this plane had to go and land in um Austria and they searched the plane for Edward Snowden now this is totally against the rules you cannot you you can't do this to president's planes but he said that just goes to show you how corrupt the whole thing is a phone call close your airspace and they down this plane this guy's like what's going on here cuz cuz they yeah but that's how desperate they were to this guy they they'll stop a presidential plane to catch this guy think of how much Satan hates you you know all these secrets and he hates this message because it's revealed his whole plan he just hates you he hates you he's going to go to any length to see that we don't succeed that's that's what he's doing in the end Snowden became a he's now a a citizen of Russia he's lived there for so long he's now become a citizen of Russia and and incidently enough after I think 2019 this Snowden uh Assange got something happened in the embassy and then they the Russia the police from the UK went and arrested him he's he was in he's basically been in solitary confinement from then to now 23 hours a day sitting in a Cell he L out 1 hour a day waiting for charges he's not being charged he's waiting for charges and I think that this was actually last week of all times was when he's on he's sort of at the last uh part of his court battle to try not to be extradited to the United States so that they've had the court case and they're going to decide within a week or two so this is happening so think of what you were doing in 2012 to now this guy's been going through this since 2012 but that's how desperate and that that Satan's going to be doing the same thing towards us that's why when you go online you say all this sort of stuff you know it's all he's just going to attack this message as much as he can it's going to be everywhere to to because he knows it's exposed to all of his Secrets because this message has effect on people it changes life you know it changes lives and I I want to keep talking about this now that that God when he when when the seven cells were revealed there was it's like the I just want to read the seventh one was kept the mystery in a sense it was like a he said God's great mystery of how it's a secret he kept it a secret talking about the seven cells no one the seventh cell no one know nothing about it even the angels didn't understand see he didn't reveal it that's the reason under our seventh mystery when the seventh seil was open there was silence Jesus when he was on Earth they wanted to know when he would come he said it's not even the son of God don't know when it's going to happen see God has a all to himself it's a secret so saying this a secret of the seven C it's just kept the secret which is the coming of the Lord and and that's the reason there was silence at heaven for a space of half an hour and seven Thunders uted their voices and John was even forbidden to write write it see the coming of the Lord that's one thing he hasn't revealed yet of how he will come and when he will come it's a good thing that he doesn't no he has revealed all the six CS but he don't say nothing about the seventh and the end time Cale when it starts it will be absolutely a total secret the coming of the Lord and he's coming in you he's coming in me it's just the secrets of being revealed just to those that he's coming for it's just a secret being unfolded just to his bride amen it'll be an absolute total secret according to the Bible therefore known that and remember Revelations 10 1-7 and 10 at the end of the seventh Angel's message all the Mysteries or all the secrets of God will be none we're at the end time the opening of the seventh seventh cell which is the coming of the Lord but it's also a coming of the Lord in you it's just it's all just the secret being unveiled and that brings us on to this concept now this the Rapture is not a secret it's just that many people are going to be a part of it because they don't want to be so then we get the secret going away of the Bride it's just a it's just this little secret thing that that that brother BR says why there wasn't I guess onethird of the whole Jewish race ever know that Jesus Christ was on Earth didn't they they might have heard some fanatic along down there somewhere but they didn't pay any ATT attention to it just go on you know he came to his own and his own received him not now there is where I believe even now I didn't say he would secretly come because it doesn't say that but he said when he come how much more will they will the Rapture be unknown see they they won't know directly they'll say well I thought that we were supposed to have a Rapture and all this judgment upon the Earth and he say it's already taken place and you didn't know it see it'll be just like a thief in the night he's saying it'll just be a secret it's just a secret for the bride it's just it's just it's for whomsoever Will and but those that to be in the secret place and meet God and fellowship with him it's now between him and them at the end of the Pentecostal age we are supposed to receive according to the word of God uh to according to the word as God helped me tonight to show you through here that we are to see receive a messenger that will take all those loose ends out there and reveal the whole Secret Of God for the rapturing of the church that's where we're at I've got amen and now at the coming of the Lord Jesus those who are really loving his coming that's living for it when he appears in the the sky the church that's dead in Christ shall rise the the the the saints that have been sleeping that actually knew the secret they'll rise and those will be changed in a moment the rest of them will know nothing about it see because when Jesus came it says that some of the Saints arose and appeared in the city not all of them just just those ones the Rapture will be like that we'll see each other and then we'll see them amen hallelujah amen and the rest of the world won't see them it'll be caught away as a secret going waiting for that time so that's the secret we've got this secret waiting for us I want to move on to something now the secret of the hearts you know we talk about these secrets but you know there's also secrets of our hearts that that that we could possibly have and a scripture in Corinthians says if therefore the whole church be come together into one place and all speak with tongues and there comeing those that are unlearned or unbelievers will they not say that you are mad because they just you're speaking in a language they don't understand and it's just all this carry on and they're going this is crazy man what's happening here yeah but he says but if all prophesy actually speak and prophesy something and there comeing one that believeth not or one unlearned he has convinced of all he has judged of all and thus are the secrets of his heart made manifest and so falling down on his face he will worship God and report that God is in you over a truth now we serve an almighty God that can reveal the secrets that knows and reveals the secrets of every heart every heart see God can hold Secrets but there's no secret with him right there's no secret that you can hold from him but he can he can hold secrets and just reveal it to some but you can't hold a secret from God every place in the human heart God knows of every little area there are no secrets from God and this here brother Brown's praying he says shall we bow our heads Our Kind Heavenly Father feeling the pressure and power of the Holy Spirit moving here now that knows the secret of every heart right nothing can come before you now there's nothing that can hide there's nothing that can escape that the presence of almighty God came is down in the building and it's searching every heart y that's right and there's nothing can stand before it there's nothing can be hidden you can't shut a door so he doesn't see in there he's moving through the secret of every heart now I'm going to read these I'm going this is just quotes but I just want to read these little stories to you because I want to make this impactive okay I've got four of them a young lady came up into the house here not long ago been prayed for so much till she had been anointed 50 times I guess how that everything had taken place I had prayed for her through there I had prayed for her there but sit down in the room one morning when the angel of the Lord came near he began to speak to her and tell her just what she had done and something she was harboring back in in her soul she had had it there for eight long years there was a secret there men had prayed for her she' gone to all sorts of things trying to make this thing go but there was just a little secret laying down there then he revealed it to her he said she wouldn't tell nobody her secret the psychiatrist couldn't pull it out of her and she almost fainted when she was told the secret fell on the floor and began to cry and I said you go make that right and God will heal you that's right she went and go her husband and made the thing right and came back up she's healed today cuz God exposed the secret that was that she was trying to hide how many knows who I'm talking about in the building many of you do sure I think if I'm not mistaken the woman may be sitting here now it was a very embarrassing thing kind of is when Secrets get revealed but God did the work now see all of the praying all the Stomping all the casting out of evil spirits she was harboring way down deep in your heart that she didn't want to tell nobody that she did it but the Holy Spirit revealed The Secret of your heart she went and made that right then she was clear God won't bless over the top of sin you got to clear it up first that's right that's right amen another one reminds me of another case one day I just came home um if I'm not mistaken they were there was a an escapan or Presbyterian people that had brought a little girl from Kansas and the doctors had give her up with leukemia and they gave you I believe 4 days to live she had gotten so bad so they said they just spend those four days coming over here through the snow drifts and things across the country to have her prayed for and the grandfather a very fine looking elderly man was gray-haired and they had her already 2 days down here in a motel I guess it isn't stand there now this is this side of Silver Creek and so I went down that night to pray for her it was early in the morning I came in that night from out of town and went down and the elderly father grandfather was walking and the floor and the mother trying to take care of her child and while I knelt to pray the Holy Spirit revealed to me a secret that was between the mother and the father of something they had done I called them to the side and asked them about it they started crying and said that's right because something happened then he said and this is a vision then he says I look back and I seen the little girl skipping a rope going and playing once they' made that right he saw he saw the girl in a vision and then he says and later on and now about 3 weeks after that they sent me a picture of the little girl back in school skipping a rope had no leukemia at all that's the almighty God that we serve sometimes it's a bit embarrassing for us but you know when us if there's any Secret in their heart and anything you know I think I'd rather have an alive daughter and a wee bit of embarrassment rather than a dead daughter and hold the secret in my heart amen that that's that's where we're at folks come on now now this is him talking to a mother he's saying you have you have some children you have a boy overseas you want to see him don't you mother you will I want him to see you too now look here I want you to be honest with me I'm honest with you this is in a prayer line You'll do the same with me won't you now there's something holding you holding you back from your healing he prayed and nothing had happened he said there's something holding you back from your healing and I'm going to tell you what it is shall I tell you out just let it go so they must have had some maybe it was just off the mic I'll tell you what it is just let it go I'll tell you in secret he says now you know I know what it is don't you all right he's saying don't do it anymore now I know the Revelation here now you are she may be saying he's saying yes you can God can take it away from you Hallelujah yes but now look there's no way in the world for me to ever know that secret only by revelation of God but I found the cancer won't leave you see that's the reason it's holding now you pray will you do it by the mercy of God you'll do it sure he will deliver you father she's willing now to Lad on the altar of Heaven you know I could find you know how I could find that out and I pray dear God that you'll take the desire from her now whatever that thing was that she'll never do it again Satan upon the confession of this woman upon her desire to serve god with a pure heart I come to you in the name of Jesus Christ come out of the woman now sister look he here he says every vibration has stopped because that was when he would touch him with the hand he said every vibration stopped you're free from your habit also maybe it was smoking maybe whatever it was you're free from that also go go on now and serve God with all your heart you'll see your boy at Christmas put your arms around his neck and tell him mother's delivered every vibration has stopped got a funny feeling haven't you yeah that habits gone from you too now keep it from you as long as you live God bless you what an awesome God we serve that he can he has got that he loves us enough to re to show us these little secrets last one here with this thought I was speaking a little Club footed baby came by you remember the little feet in like that I seen the vision what have caused it what have taken place I took the little baby to side and asked the parents the secret that they were doing in the line of birth control and things that wasn't right he's saying you're doing the certain thing so I talked to them privately and so they I asked them if they' do a certain thing like are you doing this and will you change it and they said yes we will that's what we're doing and we will change it he said now take the brace off the baby and they sat down there cut those CLS off the baby and its little feet was just as normal as they could be walked on off and went onise God last one for this thought Peter this this was ananas and saf they thought they could hold a secret from God when when all the the the the the pressure leadership of the Holy Ghost at that time was for people to sell all that they have and to give the money to the disciples and they were going to spread it around amongst the people and just go out and Minister the word of God and just as the Lord LED so they got caught up in this idea of doing that but in their heart they didn't really want to so they sold their house and they thought we'll just keep some of it we'll give them maybe 50% we'll keep the other 50% and they schemed amongst themselves as husband and wife and they came to Peter and said and Peter when they came before Peter God revealed the secret to Peter what they had done he said these people are going to tell you this is the full price of their house but theyve keeping back half that they could they could have kept a whole lot was their money God didn't he didn't he didn't mind it was a fact that they tried to tell it to lie and and scheme this little secret but the secret was revealed Peter said do you sell it for this much he said yeah I did and he said you told a lie and and when his secret was revealed he dropped down and died then his I think I believe that's the the wife came in and they said oh did you sell it for this much they said yeah that's what we did and he said the same people that carried your husband will carry you it as well and she died as well just trying to keep a secret from God just be honest with God he knows everything anyway don't keep a secret he knows everything Amen in time of death I've heard people when they know they were dying the things they kept secret all their life they in desperation they were trying to confess see trying to say take this make it right do this when they were dying they knew I'm going to face a God that knows all things yeah something in the human heart knows I'm going to a place that everything's going to be exposed and and this secret I've managed to hold from this person that person from my wife from everyone but I've got to meet a God and and they know human beings know themselves my secrets all going to be uncovered I I'm going to stand before whoever it is there I'm going to stand before somebody and it's all going to be made known and and I thought there was a powerful thought you know of these deathbed confessions of Secrets and things that they've done it's actually very common death bear confession saying now that I've come to die I'm going to I'm going to tell all this now because they know they don't want to cross the line with that on themen I was surprised at some of the things you know there was this this man was in he was actually in New Zealand he was actually the he became known as the first serial killer but no one knew he did that he he was a bit of a Riff Raff just up and down sort of life and he was in out of prison for different things but he did end up murdering somebody which they charged him for never admitted to murdering this person he said no it wasn't me it wasn't me but he did get charged for it um then he escaped and he got caught again but on his deathbed he said he just said look I've you know I've been an awful man my whole life I not only did I kill that person I killed three other people and and he confessed to killing this this lady here was actually a Christian lady her and her sister worked at the Salvation Army on wi and this was in the 40s this was 1942 and she'd actually been a missionary to Japan and come back so during the war she was quite sympathetic of the Japanese because she was a missionary there and I think she had quite a outspoken personality CU she would go down to the local pub and tell all the guys down there as they were drinking that you're all going to go to hell you got to stop drinking you're all Sinners condemned to hell she was an evangelist and no one liked her and this guy word got around that she had a whole lot of money stash in her place so that's why this guy just went around there and just killed her trying to find the money and killed her older sister she was 60 and her sister was like 74 just killed them and he killed another man but I don't know I find it interesting that you know God exposed Us in the end to to tell us that because that was his his woman you know she was actually she was a Believer this other man killed someone when he was in the in the 70s she was actually a sex worker but then he went on and had got away with it then he went on had a had a family raised children and that and then on his deathbed he couldn't really speak anymore but then he wrote this letter and said to whoever it concerns I would like to put the record straight I can't go on with the guilt I've lived with it for over 20 years he's trying to confess it trying to say sorry but he but he knows he's got to go to the Grave with us he had a chance to to confess it when he was around but he he held it his whole life and he took it to the Grave he said I'm truly sorry for the pain I've caused I'm sorry you know I love my kids and and help me God it's funny when people are there they call out to God but often times it's sometimes it's too late not always but you know cuz they realize right at the end well actually hang on someone's going I'm I'm meeting someone that's going to know what I've done and he he died like that this this other person was horrible she an African-American man this was in the 70s went to her house and she accused him of um rape and robbery and so this man got charged for that and was in prison for 12 years for this attempted rape and robbery of this lady but on her deathbed she confessed to her neighbor I didn't that wasn't true I actually invited him in and if I got him actually drunk but I just didn't want anyone to know that I'd brought this African-American to my house cuz she was a bit older he was younger and she said truth be n to I actually robbed him when he was drunk I took his money so she confessed on her deathbed and then they let this man out because they realized that but you imagine being that lady for she she she held that secret in her heart she was happy that he was another man's life ruined and the whole family ruined and on her lie and she held that secret in her heart right till her death but then she told her neighbor that's what I've done you know the funny thing was that man was a he wasn't a Christian winning winner but he said I'm free and I feel wonderful this is when he got out he said to the newspapers he said I was bitter when I went in but since I turned my life over to Jesus I'm not bter anymore and then they gave him about a million dollars to go and live the rest of his life or something like that you know so he came out serving the lord wealthy could serve God and she I'm going to say she died and went to hell so I've got two more things I want to talk about then we're done this one's this is a concept that's happening now in a natural sense that I just want to make sure no one gets caught up in there's this idea now in in a in the world this wake up you know this all these conspiracies and wake up to see what's happening you know we've come across this big secret you need to wake up and and this is what this government is doing this is what these bad people are doing they're trying to take over the world and all this sort of stuff now I'm not saying it's there's no not a bit of Truth in it but it's become such a powerful force if you haven't been paying attention to it whole political systems and whole countries are there's this massive do you know what I mean yes it's this is massive like 10 12 years ago I was looking into some of the stuff and this was Fringe 20 years ago I was looking into this was Fringe information only a few of us in it like yeah yeah interesting stuff you know it's interesting but it's become now Main stream headline now it's almost like now to be a Christian these days you don't need to serve God don't need to do nothing you just need to say I oppose Biden I oppose these leftwing liberals I oppose this and that and you're a Christian and all the Christians are caught up in this thinking it's a we've uncovered the secret now it's a righteous War it's a total load of nonsense and they're just being dragged in I can see the it's a global the Christianity because they've cuz they've they've rejected the first secret that God actually wanted to reveal to them the secret they've just gone off onto this total nonsense like this sort of stuff Lord Jesus thank you for president Trump the Lord doesn't really care about Trump in the terms of he's not the Savior all this nonsense it's just and they're so caught up and and and it's like that's Evangelical now you know they have seminars on how to outreach to your friends to wake them up to what's happening but it's a total load of nonsense but this movement is this is massive like we got big names and and big people like this was actually the guy that played Jesus you know and the films come out and this guy's the guy that owns my pillow he funds it he's got a and but but it but then it's a massive war because this the baddies are trying to take down his business and they're doing all these things and the big Walmart had taken his pillow out of their shops and it's just all out War but it's a war of no value and the Christians I think people all want some sort of cause they fight for and all the Christians that that that actually don't have this real secret and the real word are just caught up in this massive fight even people like taka cson like international news media figures are caught up in the fight you know he was he's now come over to the good side and all this sort of stuff you know and he then he got fired from his organization even though he was the he was the guy that was the most viewed the most popular guy why would they fire him they're saying look that shows they just hate anyone that's going on that side they fired him it Christians are so caught up in this it's just just it's nonsense you know Alex Jones Trump used to go on there before he was president he'd go on these and he talk about it and they would you know the FBI are arresting old men that have done nothing they're shooting around to their house and arresting them they're saying see look what the baddies are doing there these guys are martys for the lord they're not I'm just saying don't get caught up in this nonsense it's actually going to drag the church into the mark of the beast into that it's it's totally the wrong way around they don't realize they're being actually it's going to be the they're going to do it themselves they're going to drag themselves into it not realizing it's total nonsense so if you I mean it's interesting stuff if you want to if your brain needs a rest and kind of you want to process a bit of natural thought but don't get caught up in it there are there are people that leave churches if the pastor doesn't believe that this guy has got some sort of agenda well even the church you don't believe that uh this guy that what's that what's the thing they're doing that guy the German guy that like they do this like the uh economic World economic forum wec and all this you know they've got they've got videos now of him on the superimposed on the face of a bad in the movie and the other guys like fighting him and punching him it's just nonsense yeah it's it's but you see they're caught up in this idea that oh we've exposed a secret but and when we're going to expose a secret it's not a secret it's nonsense yeah it is wanted to throw that in because this ain't a secret this is just this is just rubbish I've got two more things this next one is keeping things a secret you know we talk about actually we shouldn't keep things a secret but actually sometimes God says keep this a secret one of them he talks about he says take heed that you do not your arms or your giving before men to be seen of them otherwise you have no reward of your father which is in heaven therefore when thou doest thine arms do not sound a trumpet before thee as the Hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the streets that they may have Glory of men verely areound to they have their reward what I mean that's what the world does right they have sponsorships hey guys I sponsored this event this little fledgling operation That Couldn't support itself I came along and I gave them this much money and I'm going to let you know that I did that and aren't I so great you know cuz I'm helping out this little fledgling organization and that's what sometimes you know and God's saying if you're a Christian don't let your right hand know what your left hand does don't be like that keep it a secret if you give just keep it a secret keep it a secret what you're doing he says but when th do THS when you give when you do these things let not your left hand know what your right hand doeth that thine arms may be in secret and the Father which seeth in secret shall reward thee openly saying also if you fast you know don't be like the Hypocrites they've got a they look like they've got a sad face and look I'm so spiritual cuz I'm fasting you know anoint your head with oil make it look like you nothing yeah it's just another day yeah just working doing this and doing that you might have be on your fourth day fasting just do it between you and God Amen and keep it a secret and God will reward you openly but don't let don't don't try and show how spiritual you are sometimes I watch these denominational things and they're like you know I prayed and I talked to God and God told me this and God told me that and like having this conversation I think man I'm I'm not spiritual at all cuz I go to try and talk to God and I might get might take me an hour and I I get barely get anything you know I think man these people are more spiritual than me you know BR to S it like that but you know it's just it's just like I know God this and you know it's all sort of just keep it to yourself amen he says that they appear not to fast but um but unto thy father which is in secret and thy father which say in secret shall reward thee openly one more here and when thou prayest thou shall not be as the Hypocrites are for they love to pray standing in the synagogues and in the corners of the streets that they may be seen of men verily I say unto they have their reward but th When you pray enter into the closet then let people know what you're doing and when th have shut the door pray to the Father which is in secret and the Father which seeth in secret shall reward the openly just keep it a secret here's another one a taale bearer reveals secrets but he who is of a faithful Spirit conceals a matter you know a Believer just you can you can actually hear things in this and there it just it stops with you all the gossip stops with you you don't no I don't need to talk about that it just stops with me I'm not going to go in and you hear what s did and you just carry on this nonsense just a a Son of God will just keep things a secret just keep it a secret keep those things a secret because if you keep them a secret they just they don't carry on past you that's right this is actually another one Peter saying for what glory is it if when you're buffeted when you've been you know got buffeted means you have got a uh uh yeah you have a recompense like a you've reaped what you've sewn something you've done wrong if you take it patiently yes I was wrong I deserve that you're right if you take it patiently he said but if you do well and you suffer for it and you take it patiently in other words don't say do you know what I did I did this and this and this with that person and then that person did this to me can you believe that they're like that's outrageous that person's so wrong to do that to you I know you're actually not supposed to say anything just take it patiently yeah yeah I was actually right they were totally wrong I've been done over here just he's saying just take it patiently he says because you've actually been called for that the same as the Lord when he when he went up he just faced all the accusers they said all these sorts of things he took it patiently and went and took the suffering went through it all he didn't say nothing about it some of things we just keep a secret last three slides no secrets but we've already talked about this but I just wanted to finish with these two because I believe we here don't want any secrets now do you know inside a door of the human heart we got little secret compartments oh we don't want to admit it but it's the truth sure we got little secret compartments yes sir we like to call we welcome in our heart but we don't want to make him our Lord we don't want to go to hell so we say Lord Jesus step into the door so I won't go to hell but you can't be my Lord you can't go into these other doors but here's us we must welcome him Lord come into my house if there's anything if there's anything in here that you want help yourself I'm yours you are mine you honor me amen that great king the creator of heavens and earth has knocked at my door and I want you to come in lord lord be my Lord take me may you do may you do me anything do with me anything you want to any bad thing that in me discover every secret that's in my heart go in every door search me out Lord see what's wrong with me and whatever is wrong show me Lord throw it out the door I want you in here I welcome you to be my Lord I haven't got that blessing Lord clean me now just Lord I'm an open my life's an open book every door's open I've got no seet before you Lord just come in and you know anyone that does that you're going to live a Victorious Christian Life which I believe you all are and I want to encourage you don't you know I think God is more than able to we sometimes hear these things we think or maybe there's something that I'll never find out what it is I think God's more faithful than that I think he's more faithful you know if you don't if you can't find anything can't hear anything can't nothing there just then there's nothing there but if there's something there God will show it sometimes we go to searching because we hear these things we think right man I've got to search deeper there's got to be something somewhere and Satan can start to play in our mind and oh and he and he digging up something that maybe it's already been been made right or twisting around something God used to Satan used to tell me that I was blessing the Holy Ghost because when we were kids I was at 10 or 11 playing in the river I said to my brothers you know we we pretended we were baptizing I baptized you next one and then you know for months the devil said H look you blessed him the Holy Ghost cuz you were playing around with that you know there's no no hope for you for even for years I thought that cuz you did that wasn't the truth I was there was nothing in it you know we we weren't I wasn't making fun it was just something we'd seen at church you know we're in the water hey we we were just sort of mes goofing around you know but but but if it's if it's there's something in God Will shout you don't have to don't get all you know don't search out don't go looking for something that's not there let's um let's stand this morning I just want to um have the musicians come up I just want to um we'll just pray and then I want to sing that song Just f it on my heart search me oh
