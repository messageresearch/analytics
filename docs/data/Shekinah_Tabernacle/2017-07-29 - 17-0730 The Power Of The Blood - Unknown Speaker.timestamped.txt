[41:54] the motorway turn right okay going up
[41:57] towards up a height you go over the
[41:58] river once and it's the first reserve on
[42:00] the left but we'll all convoy together
[42:02] so all go so no one will get lost I mean
[42:05] but it's a glorious day
[42:07] Alleluia let's just go - it's got a
[42:10] first Timothy chapter 2 and we're going
[42:18] to read a couple of scriptures and then
[42:22] we're going to go to so first Timothy
[42:26] two and five and six and then we're
[42:30] going to go to Hebrews chapter 12 and
[42:34] verse 18
[42:38] so first Timothy - five and six
[42:47] says
[42:52] it says for there is one God and one
[42:56] mediator between God and men the man
[42:58] Christ Jesus it gave himself a ransom
[43:03] for all to be testified in due time and
[43:08] then we're going to go to Hebrews 12 and
[43:11] we read verse from 18 down to verse 24
[43:20] it says for ye are not come unto the
[43:23] mount that might be touched that burned
[43:27] with fire nor unto darkness a blackness
[43:29] and darkness and Tempest and the sound
[43:32] of a trumpet and the voice of words
[43:34] which voice they had heard and treated
[43:36] that that word should not be spoken to
[43:38] them any more this being of when Moses
[43:41] when the children of Israel went to
[43:42] Mount Sinai but for they could not
[43:46] endure that which was commanded and if
[43:48] so much the beast touch the mountain it
[43:50] should be stoned or thrust through the
[43:51] dark and so terrible was the sight that
[43:53] Moses said I exceedingly fear and quake
[43:56] but ye are come unto Mount Zion unto the
[43:59] city of the Living God the heavenly
[44:02] Jerusalem into an innumerable company of
[44:04] angels to the General Assembly and
[44:07] Church of the firstborn which are
[44:09] written in heaven and to God the judge
[44:11] of all and to the spirits of just men
[44:13] made perfect and to Jesus the mediator
[44:16] of the New Covenant and to the blood of
[44:19] sprinkling that speaketh better things
[44:21] than that of Abel
[44:23] I mean God bless you all you may have
[44:25] your seats today in the Friends of the
[44:27] Lord and I wonder this morning I want to
[44:31] continue on my thought from to a degree
[44:34] from from last Sunday speaking about
[44:37] being worthy and we finished last Sunday
[44:40] with revelations chapter 5 where the
[44:42] book was taken and all those in heaven
[44:45] said thou art worthy to go hast thou has
[44:49] redeemed us out of every kindred nation
[44:51] and tongue by thy blood and made us
[44:53] kings and priests to God and I want to
[44:56] focus on this morning because you know
[45:00] there's always that battle and maybe if
[45:02] I repeat myself a little bit from from
[45:04] times past I pray you'd forgive me
[45:06] for that but we must understand that the
[45:09] blood of Jesus Christ is more powerful
[45:11] than we can even fathom I mean we're
[45:13] we're by one offering by one moment in
[45:16] time God shed his blood upon the earth
[45:19] for you and I and what was the life of
[45:22] God was released out of those blood
[45:23] cells and it was now through his word as
[45:26] quickened unto you I mean with that life
[45:28] can come unto you and it and it doesn't
[45:31] just save your soul but there's a power
[45:33] that's been released through the blood
[45:35] which will change your mortal bodies
[45:37] amen so it's an incredible thing where
[45:40] where once mankind we understand by by
[45:43] the by the sin that was done in the
[45:45] garden that man was once he was here
[45:48] dominion over the earth but then he
[45:50] became a slave to Satan he became a
[45:53] slave yo
[45:54] Satan became the Prince of the power of
[45:56] the year you know you read from
[45:57] Ephesians chapter 2 and so we were once
[46:00] slaves but we understand that man was
[46:03] never made to be a slave to the devil I
[46:06] mean we were never made to be his his
[46:08] subjects but we were made to be sons and
[46:11] daughters of God we're made to be the
[46:13] bride of Jesus Christ
[46:15] joint heirs with Christ hallelujah so
[46:18] that is what man was ordained to be we
[46:20] were attained to have dominion over this
[46:22] earth but because of sin and because of
[46:26] that sin nature came came into humanity
[46:29] and so we became slaves to that sin
[46:32] nature so man nowadays he becomes a
[46:35] slave to lust or or drinking or drugs or
[46:38] smoking or fame or money or woman aware
[46:41] of it as man becomes slave to that
[46:43] because we are all born with a fallen
[46:46] nature they meant but now but through
[46:49] the blood of Jesus Christ
[46:50] he doesn't just patch us up but he
[46:52] makers a new creation
[46:54] it means of the nature that we should
[46:56] have received in the beginning we
[46:58] received that divine nature
[47:00] hallelujah but through that divine
[47:02] nature now breath just just let's just
[47:04] have Church today I mean we are free I
[47:07] mean the blood of Jesus Christ cleanses
[47:09] from all sin I mean you don't have to be
[47:12] a slave and you say well I'm free
[47:14] rejoicing you're freed
[47:15] you know it's like a weapon if you
[47:17] really know what the weapon can do you
[47:19] know if you don't know what the weapon
[47:20] can do you may be a bit scared to use it
[47:22] you imagine you know a nuclear bomb is
[47:24] not actually that big it can be like in
[47:27] a briefcase and imagine if you said take
[47:30] this into the enemy's camp and put it
[47:33] down you say well well what does
[47:37] briefcase yeah this what's it gonna do
[47:40] it's gonna wipe it out how's it gonna
[47:42] wipe it out I'll show you you know but
[47:45] even though I said no just just go just
[47:46] take it trust me you may have some
[47:49] doubts but then if you see it in action
[47:51] you say oh I'm gonna take the city don't
[47:54] worry I'll set it off when you're far
[47:55] away you'll be okay you know
[47:57] that's that's the same thing with the
[47:59] blood we have a record of the victory of
[48:02] the blood down through even in the Old
[48:05] Testament there was a victory it's just
[48:07] under the blood of bulls and goats for
[48:09] those victories manifested I mean time
[48:11] and time again God was proving himself
[48:14] hallelujah then you come into the New
[48:16] Testament era glory amen
[48:19] and God just keeps showing himself
[48:21] improving himself so we know that this
[48:26] bomb works we know that this weapon
[48:29] works we know what it can do when you
[48:31] take when when God can take a redeemed
[48:33] man take the profit of God man born and
[48:37] since shaped an iniquity come to world
[48:39] speaking lives just like you and I a man
[48:41] in any case surrender his life over
[48:43] except the blood of Jesus Christ God
[48:45] comes and fills them and then he places
[48:48] them into his position his adoption
[48:50] where he receives the sword in his hand
[48:51] on sunset man in the word you know the
[48:54] opening of the word and and God proofs
[48:56] for his ministry every devil was
[48:57] defeated amen
[48:59] nature had to obey his voice death had
[49:02] to get had to flee amen life had to come
[49:05] back into people that were dead
[49:06] hallelujah witchcraft was cast down I
[49:09] mean the nomination was was revealed to
[49:12] what it was hallelujah amen
[49:15] this was proven in a man because God
[49:17] wanted to show you and I this is what
[49:19] the blood does I mean this is what my
[49:21] victory does I want to show it to you in
[49:23] this generation I mean so it's not just
[49:26] a you know it's not just maybe something
[49:29] that in our minds it was 2,000 years ago
[49:31] but it comes forward to our generation
[49:33] and God shows you now this is what I can
[49:36] do this is what I can do through me this
[49:38] is what is done I mean because remember
[49:41] the challenge isn't actually you know
[49:44] the challenge now is the question comes
[49:46] up does this work does it do what it
[49:50] says it does because if it doesn't we
[49:52] should find what does work but if it
[49:54] does work we should cherish it we should
[49:56] rejoice in it and we should use it amen
[49:59] so it's been shown to work Alleluia now
[50:06] God has told us in his word he said
[50:11] you'll be made like me I'll make you
[50:14] into my image you'd be partakers of the
[50:16] divine nature now so the nature that
[50:19] Adam had before the fall we would
[50:21] receive and it would be that man and as
[50:25] member this body has to be redeemed
[50:27] right we are still in a fallen body but
[50:31] God and his power can put his life in us
[50:34] that the Spirit in us makes the subject
[50:38] to the life in us I mean that we are no
[50:41] longer slaves to this guy but we become
[50:44] loved prisoners to Jesus Christ the
[50:46] sinner and that life in us gives us
[50:48] overcoming power well the man says if
[50:50] you want to yo how do you overcome just
[50:53] keep life about you hallelujah now so
[50:58] brother Bram he he begins to speak about
[51:04] this is in the breach
[51:06] he's you know if you ever listened to
[51:08] the breach meant you're the breach
[51:09] between the seven churches and the seven
[51:11] seals god hiding himself and simplicity
[51:13] you should go listen to those sermons
[51:15] because it's not just a preamble for
[51:18] this is what the seals are but he's
[51:19] laying in some very important things
[51:21] because he says in the breach he says he
[51:25] says now when a person is struck with
[51:27] disease aches and pain one thing they
[51:29] wasn't they wasn't that way but they
[51:32] groaning why they're not right there's
[51:34] something wrong and they're groaning and
[51:36] they're trying to get back to where they
[51:38] was when they had health and when nature
[51:41] and people as the Bible said are
[51:43] groaning it shows there's something
[51:45] that's that they're not in there ought
[51:47] to be condition their fallen from
[51:49] somewhere now we don't need anybody to
[51:52] interpret that for us see but of course
[51:54] we know it was eternal life that they
[51:56] had fallen from and they lost their
[51:58] claims on eternal life by the fall of
[52:00] antimony who fell from eternal life to
[52:03] death in the Garden of Eden and brought
[52:05] all nature under them to death a tree
[52:08] never died before Adam an animal
[52:10] wouldn't die before Adam there's only
[52:12] one thing that cannot die and that's God
[52:14] because he's eternal and that's the only
[52:16] way we can ever keep from dying we have
[52:18] to have eternal life in us to be sons
[52:21] and daughters of God so there's a
[52:24] longing when you're sick I'm just
[52:25] basically reiterating what he said but
[52:27] if you're sick there's something in you
[52:29] saying this is not how I should be I
[52:31] should be well I remember what it's like
[52:33] to be well and it's the same thing even
[52:36] even in a spiritual sight when there's
[52:38] something and you saying there's more to
[52:40] life than us there's more to just how
[52:42] things are there has shown you that your
[52:45] fallen from somewhere your fallen from
[52:48] something and your something and you
[52:50] crying up I don't want to be in this
[52:52] decrepit yo lost and undone state I want
[52:56] to go back to what I should be and
[52:58] that's God trying to get your attention
[52:59] saying saying before the foundation
[53:02] world you're in my mind amen and I
[53:04] thought of yours
[53:05] as made in my image sitting at my right
[53:07] hand join us with me how Lewis it is a
[53:11] crying earth is that there's a crying in
[53:13] your heart there must be a God to meet
[53:14] or you know that's because you actually
[53:17] fell from somewhere amen and God is
[53:19] willing to open your eyes and lift you
[53:21] back up to where you should be because
[53:23] remember Satan was near I'm just going
[53:26] to repeat myself you know I hope you
[53:28] don't mind
[53:29] Satan was made as he's an angel an angel
[53:32] is a servant right a son or daughter is
[53:36] not a servant it's different category so
[53:38] all the hordes of hell were made
[53:40] servants because they were angels but
[53:42] they fell from their first estate
[53:43] I'm in our cast down into darkness but
[53:46] they were made to be servants angels the
[53:48] servants servants and not sons and
[53:51] daughters of the king servants can never
[53:54] become royal family they could you know
[53:56] take in the modern sense the royal
[53:58] family could adopt you awry but you go
[54:01] back into the genetics to the of us we
[54:03] are not related to them right but those
[54:06] who are born into the family have the
[54:08] lineage or the DNA of the parent amen
[54:11] and it's the same thing with you and I
[54:13] we were never made to be servants we
[54:17] were not mate and especially not
[54:18] servants to fallen angels I mean but we
[54:21] are made as sons and daughters and we do
[54:23] not become sons and daughters the Bible
[54:26] says because you are sons he said for
[54:28] the spirit and here we cry my father my
[54:31] father Abba Father hallelujah so we are
[54:35] not made to be servants we are made to
[54:37] be sons and daughters and this is the
[54:39] age where everything is coming back into
[54:42] a straight position amen where where
[54:45] when when the land took the book and
[54:47] revelations chapter five and he looses
[54:49] the seals he begins to place everything
[54:52] Satan you're under the feet of the bride
[54:54] bride you're at my right hand fullest
[54:56] virgin your hair Church you're here
[54:58] Great Hall at the oh he's placing
[54:59] everything in its position Jesus Christ
[55:02] is high above all else he's a lord of
[55:04] glory a menace why the greatest were the
[55:07] greatest revelations as Jesus Christ is
[55:09] supreme deity I mean he is the Alpha and
[55:13] the Omega the first and the last
[55:14] how lujah there's only one God amen so
[55:19] now so the message places everything
[55:21] where it's meant to be I mean so so the
[55:24] bright your joint is with Christ you
[55:26] being predestinated to come into that
[55:28] position hallelujah and then so now what
[55:31] happens is through that word as you
[55:33] receive that word I mean it begins you
[55:36] begin to move whether you realize I'm
[55:39] not talking about moving from one
[55:40] country to another or you know one place
[55:42] I'm talking about spiritually you begin
[55:44] to move because of one time you're a
[55:46] slave but then you hear the word faith
[55:48] cometh by hearing and hearing the Word
[55:50] of God so faith comes into your heart
[55:52] and then the things you were once bound
[55:54] by they're under your feet
[55:56] I mean because you begin to ascend
[55:58] hallelujah
[56:00] the bride is ascending in the stage a
[56:01] mint and a few yo you say well I don't
[56:05] feel like I'm going too far have more
[56:07] faith in the blood of Jesus Christ amen
[56:10] because it's by his work yes by his
[56:12] blood
[56:13] yes by his offering hallelujah we will
[56:16] be where we will be a mint that is the
[56:19] only way remember I read the quote from
[56:20] me from the church age book it is not
[56:23] blood it's not the blood and your good
[56:25] conduct or your blood in your works it's
[56:28] only the blood I mean but your conduct
[56:31] is because you love him that's why we
[56:34] live certain your your the way we do and
[56:36] so now we have been in this out okay
[56:40] let's just read Hebrews I mean Ephesians
[56:42] chapter 2 because I want to actually
[56:44] just basically I want to say what I've
[56:47] just said to you is in the Bible okay
[56:49] you got to find it in here and I just
[56:51] want to throw out some things and that
[56:53] sounds neat and we get excited but where
[56:54] is it in the word because in the hard
[56:57] times you can go back and say god this
[56:58] is what you see I mean it's like the
[57:00] message you find the message in the
[57:02] Bible because the message is not another
[57:04] gospel of Jesus Christ it reveals Christ
[57:06] in here I mean that's why this is our
[57:09] absolute hallelujah and God sent a
[57:12] prophet to give us a quick
[57:13] interpretation of the word because now
[57:16] if we have the incorrect interpretation
[57:17] of the word the devil has nothing he can
[57:19] hold against us I mean because we do not
[57:22] have his doctrine we do not believe in
[57:24] three separate people in the Godhead or
[57:26] some false baptism or whatever they may
[57:28] believe we don't believe in those things
[57:30] and so the devil can't say I have a
[57:32] claim on those people well maybe come to
[57:34] that later because those things have
[57:35] been struck off in this age now
[57:38] Ephesians two and one and you had the
[57:41] quickened who were dead in trespasses
[57:43] and sins according in time past ye
[57:46] walked according to the course of this
[57:48] world according to the Prince of the
[57:50] power of the air the spirit that now
[57:52] worketh in the children of disobedience
[57:54] among whom also we all had our
[57:57] conversation and times past in the lusts
[58:01] of our flesh fulfilling the desires of
[58:03] the flesh and of the mind and we're by
[58:04] nature the children of Wrath even as
[58:07] others let's just stop there so one time
[58:09] we were slay
[58:10] we were all born this way that's why I
[58:14] just said we were all slaves because the
[58:16] full of nature we received we were like
[58:18] this but then that's not the end of the
[58:20] story
[58:21] Alleluia first fought but God who is
[58:23] rich in mercy for his great lover and he
[58:26] has loved us even when we were dead in
[58:28] sins hath quickened us together with
[58:30] Christ by grace ESA and hath this is
[58:34] what he has done and hath raised us up
[58:37] together and made us O Lord I want to
[58:40] sit and hear me places he makes you do
[58:42] it he makes you suddenly everything
[58:44] places because he elevates like in stir
[58:46] was elevated to be the queen the king
[58:49] put her there she didn't put her itself
[58:51] there he put her there
[58:52] I lose the same thing with us let's
[58:55] raise us tomatoes sit together in
[58:56] heavenly places in Christ Jesus
[58:58] then the ages to come he might show the
[59:00] exceeding riches of His grace and his
[59:01] kindness towards us through Christ Jesus
[59:04] for by grace ye are saved through faith
[59:06] and that is not of yourselves
[59:08] and as the gift of God not of works lest
[59:10] any man should boast for we are his
[59:12] workmanship created in Christ Jesus unto
[59:14] good works which God hath before
[59:16] ordained that now just change the way to
[59:20] I make it better that I should walk in
[59:22] them Alleluia so we can see here now
[59:26] this is whoa let's just keep reading
[59:28] here who likes to read the Bible because
[59:32] normally brother I meet ya brother
[59:34] Armand sees I need an in scripture cuz
[59:36] otherwise he gets too small I'm just
[59:37] gonna keep reading I'm sorry cuz it's
[59:39] all good but this shows you now cuz Paul
[59:41] is telling you this is what you were
[59:43] you're a slave you were but he quickened
[59:46] you he made you alive and faith cometh
[59:47] by hearing and hearing the Word of God
[59:49] right and so now after you hear the word
[59:52] it's quicken to you you no longer a
[59:53] slave cuz you began arise up of other
[59:55] thing that oppresses you wherefore
[59:57] remember that you've been in times past
[1:00:00] Gentiles in the flesh who are called
[1:00:02] uncircumcision by that which is called
[1:00:05] circumcision in the flesh made by hands
[1:00:07] that at that time you were without
[1:00:09] Christ being aliens from the
[1:00:11] Commonwealth of Israel and strangers
[1:00:13] from the Covenant of promise having no
[1:00:16] hope and without God in the world but
[1:00:19] now in Christ Jesus you were sometimes
[1:00:21] were far off are made nigh
[1:00:24] by the blood of Christ for he is our
[1:00:26] peace who hath brought who had made both
[1:00:28] one and it's broken down the middle wall
[1:00:30] of partition between us having abolished
[1:00:32] in his flesh the enmity even the law of
[1:00:35] Commandments contained in the ordinances
[1:00:37] for to make in himself of twain one you
[1:00:40] men so making peace and that he might
[1:00:44] reconcile unto God in one body by the
[1:00:46] cross having slain the enmity thereby
[1:00:48] and came and preached peace you which
[1:00:50] are afar off and to them that and I for
[1:00:53] through him we both have access by one
[1:00:55] spirit unto the father so he makes it
[1:00:59] very very clear we were aliens we were
[1:01:02] separated go back a bit further than a
[1:01:04] chapter we were slaves but now we are
[1:01:07] now by the blood of Jesus Christ
[1:01:09] we were we were aliens not even part of
[1:01:11] the Commonwealth not even part of the
[1:01:13] covenants right we weren't even part of
[1:01:16] it now this is verse 12 we were
[1:01:18] strangers from the covenants of promise
[1:01:21] having no hope and without God in the
[1:01:23] world what is ultimately the Covenant of
[1:01:25] God I'll give you eternal life amen walk
[1:01:28] on streets of gold I mean that's
[1:01:31] ultimately the government all of it is
[1:01:32] eternal life you will receive eternal
[1:01:34] life
[1:01:34] so beforehand we were not even in the
[1:01:37] picture but now we are in the picture
[1:01:40] hallelujah and so this is glorious but
[1:01:44] then you see well how old this was done
[1:01:46] by the blood of Jesus Christ it was done
[1:01:49] by the block it's not by your it's not
[1:01:51] by Europe your even your desire it's by
[1:01:55] his blood I meant but he puts the desire
[1:01:57] knee because he wants you to know I died
[1:02:00] for you remember before yo when he went
[1:02:04] to Calvary he didn't go up there
[1:02:05] thinking well people maybe feel sorry
[1:02:07] for me one day you know right to my
[1:02:09] songs about me and now you know and
[1:02:11] they'll feel and then they'll believe me
[1:02:13] and follow me no he knew he was he's
[1:02:15] gonna pay a ransom we're it there and
[1:02:16] first Timothy he was to ransom for us
[1:02:19] but you got to understand it wasn't you
[1:02:22] know when when he went up to pay that
[1:02:24] ransom he didn't buy him with the devil
[1:02:26] beforehand saying you know you're the
[1:02:28] devil and saying you have to do this and
[1:02:30] I'll give you this know God actually set
[1:02:32] thee set the price in the beginning the
[1:02:34] day you eat there all the day you'll die
[1:02:36] so I had to be a lie
[1:02:37] was the price and so Jesus had to give
[1:02:40] us life to pay the ransom
[1:02:42] I mean to set us free hallelujah and he
[1:02:45] knew he knew you'd be here in this day
[1:02:48] when he was back there carrying that
[1:02:51] carrying that cross up that hill that
[1:02:53] day hallelujah he knew you'd be here
[1:02:56] and so when and when he was carrying the
[1:02:58] cross up there he had your son upon you
[1:03:00] he had your failings here your humanity
[1:03:03] power he had your carnal nature
[1:03:05] hallelujah he had your you know you know
[1:03:08] don't look at yourself
[1:03:09] remember this is not he's made us worthy
[1:03:12] you know I know it's been it's it's so
[1:03:15] embedded into people we have to obtain
[1:03:16] and everything we don't have to obtain
[1:03:19] you don't sit an exam you can now get in
[1:03:22] the rapture who you are a plus
[1:03:24] okay you can you can go who got a C are
[1:03:27] you going with tribulation that doesn't
[1:03:28] work that way it doesn't work that way
[1:03:31] he made us worthy amen by his blood by
[1:03:35] one offering white offering hallelujah
[1:03:38] so now he remember before the foundation
[1:03:40] of the world we read there in Hebrews
[1:03:43] chapter 12 the names written in heaven
[1:03:45] there's being of the Lamb's Book of Life
[1:03:48] this is where we have come to where we
[1:03:50] would begin to understand that before
[1:03:52] the foundations of world God had a book
[1:03:55] of names a book of the Lamb's Book of
[1:03:57] Life
[1:03:57] not just everyone who would be on the
[1:03:59] earth and then AZ blood out for the
[1:04:01] Lamb's Book of Life
[1:04:02] right so he so he had you there recorded
[1:04:06] and then so when he went to Calvary he
[1:04:09] was he was shedding his blood upon the
[1:04:11] earth to redeem the names in the book
[1:04:13] they meant to redeem those that he
[1:04:16] foreknew he went to Calvary to redeem
[1:04:18] them so wasn't just the Old Testament
[1:04:21] Saints it here is redeeming that it
[1:04:22] already died in the faith but those in
[1:04:25] the future who would be alive and remain
[1:04:27] I mean so he wasn't just looking back to
[1:04:30] Adam because he had to because under the
[1:04:33] blood of bulls and goats that's why they
[1:04:34] went to paradise is because the blood of
[1:04:37] bulls and goats just covered their sin
[1:04:38] right it just cut it didn't do away with
[1:04:41] it
[1:04:41] it didn't transfer it to the original
[1:04:43] one who initiated the whole thing it
[1:04:45] just covered it and now waiting in
[1:04:47] Paradise until someone could come and
[1:04:49] clear every
[1:04:51] accusation against them that then they
[1:04:53] could have sent they were waiting there
[1:04:55] and so that's why they had to wait there
[1:04:58] in Paradise but then when Jesus died now
[1:05:00] it says when he arose many of the Saints
[1:05:03] arose with them because in the Old
[1:05:05] Testament there's wise and foolish
[1:05:06] virgin as well didn't say all the saints
[1:05:09] arose but many arose Matthew 27 right so
[1:05:12] it's the wise part of the bride and the
[1:05:15] Old Testament there rose with them okay
[1:05:18] and so now because they're because their
[1:05:21] dick was now I wasn't just covered by
[1:05:22] the blood of bulls and goats it was
[1:05:24] wiped clean hallelujah it was gone so
[1:05:28] now there's nothing holding him because
[1:05:29] the devil if he could hold on to you
[1:05:31] he's got you you can't you can't go up
[1:05:35] if he's got a claim on you right he you
[1:05:38] can't but if there's no claim against
[1:05:40] you that's why we can sing there's
[1:05:42] nothing holding me here I met in the
[1:05:44] bride of Jesus Christ in this hour
[1:05:46] remember Dean we've had we've come down
[1:05:50] seven church ages in the beginning you
[1:05:54] just read it's not very far into the
[1:05:56] book of Acts acts 15 I believe it is
[1:05:57] false doctrines already coming to try
[1:06:00] and among the church they had already
[1:06:01] begun to fall from where where where
[1:06:05] they were in Pentecost 120 in the upper
[1:06:08] room God came and filled them they were
[1:06:10] they were burst into the kingdom but
[1:06:13] then as time went by people came in
[1:06:16] among the believers professing to be
[1:06:17] believers but they're never full birth
[1:06:19] because they are trying to bring think
[1:06:21] yo that you're the Old Testament laws
[1:06:24] you have to become a Jew before you can
[1:06:25] become a Christian and I try to bring
[1:06:27] these things and so these people were
[1:06:29] were not completely birthed
[1:06:31] so the devil had already begin to try
[1:06:34] and creep in with yo with false doctrine
[1:06:36] and so by doing that eventually it went
[1:06:40] from there down into the Dark Ages where
[1:06:42] the devil had a total claim you know you
[1:06:45] can just go on Wikipedia and you can see
[1:06:47] the evolutions of Trinitarian doctrine
[1:06:49] you can read about it just by reading
[1:06:52] what the early church fathers safe you
[1:06:55] can go read it and so
[1:06:59] it evolved from one God and three
[1:07:02] officers to three separate people as one
[1:07:04] God
[1:07:04] but to have a person you have to be have
[1:07:07] a personality you've got to have a
[1:07:08] identity right but look here they are
[1:07:12] Israel the LORD thy God is one amen
[1:07:15] and so now so he so he brought it and
[1:07:19] the and then you go read history they
[1:07:21] change the baptism from in the name of
[1:07:23] the Lord Jesus Christ which is the name
[1:07:25] of the Father Son and the Holy Ghost
[1:07:27] there's the Lord Jesus Christ they
[1:07:29] change it to just the titles of God
[1:07:30] Father Son Holy Ghost and instead of
[1:07:32] immersing them in water which what the
[1:07:34] would baptize means is to immerse they
[1:07:37] just sprinkle and then they sprinkle
[1:07:38] babies I didn't and don't even worry
[1:07:40] about else anymore and it was just total
[1:07:42] darkness what happens Satan that claims
[1:07:45] but through that God still had some true
[1:07:48] believers all the way down through I
[1:07:50] mean because you took you know I saw a
[1:07:53] documentary on the history of the Bible
[1:07:55] and Columba I better get the church as
[1:07:58] messages wrong but Columba was the was
[1:08:01] the church age messenger to the thought
[1:08:04] Iron Age the Dark Age and he but so he
[1:08:08] actually died before that Age started
[1:08:10] but brother Brahim says speaking the
[1:08:12] Ephesian AG said the ministry that
[1:08:14] affects the age the most is the light as
[1:08:17] the messenger to the age and so now
[1:08:19] Columbus found in a Bible School in
[1:08:20] Scotland and the historian said for the
[1:08:22] next nine hundred years the vast
[1:08:24] majority of all the evangelical work in
[1:08:27] Europe came from their Bible school
[1:08:28] who's that the ministry that affected
[1:08:31] the age of the most right and then
[1:08:33] through out of that eventually that
[1:08:36] influenced John Wycliffe who was the
[1:08:38] first one to translate the Bible into
[1:08:40] English under the reign of Henry the
[1:08:42] eighth and in his teachings influenced
[1:08:45] John Huss and in John HUS what is being
[1:08:48] burnt at the stake sit in a hundred
[1:08:49] years
[1:08:50] a man will rise up with these same
[1:08:52] things and you'll not be able to destroy
[1:08:54] him and a hundred years later John
[1:08:56] Luther I mean Martin Luther raised up
[1:08:58] this is believers coming all the way
[1:08:59] down through he he raised up with the
[1:09:01] just shall live by faith in the river
[1:09:03] lake I mean the Reformation was on a
[1:09:05] mint but Satan still had claims on them
[1:09:08] because Martin Luther brought out a lot
[1:09:10] of what the Catholics belief
[1:09:12] right and then John Weasley off that
[1:09:14] brought out even more you mean I mean
[1:09:16] sane he brought out other false things
[1:09:19] but then the truth was becoming more and
[1:09:21] more than the fossils becoming less and
[1:09:23] less and so now they all died in the
[1:09:25] faith but there had to be a clearing of
[1:09:27] the deed they had to be a clearing of
[1:09:29] them as well even though if their sins
[1:09:31] were done away but Satan could still say
[1:09:33] I have them I have them because they
[1:09:35] believe false things and so now we come
[1:09:38] down don't be there like we'll be there
[1:09:40] okay don't get in your mind they won't
[1:09:43] be there they'll be there
[1:09:44] we'll see John you're Martin Luther will
[1:09:46] see John Huss will see white cliff will
[1:09:49] see Wesley and you're all those ones
[1:09:51] will meet them we'll be up there they'll
[1:09:53] be part of the same body
[1:09:55] the others have the same body we are
[1:09:57] just different season you see and so now
[1:10:00] here say so now we've come down to this
[1:10:02] last age where they without us should
[1:10:06] not be made perfect or complete so there
[1:10:09] has to be a people that will possess the
[1:10:12] full promise
[1:10:13] where the devil has no claim against
[1:10:17] them whatsoever
[1:10:18] they're made in the image of Jesus
[1:10:20] Christ right and when that body comes to
[1:10:23] us the whole body comes into the entire
[1:10:26] comes to us maturity whatever God
[1:10:28] dictates his maturity in the individual
[1:10:30] in the dead in Christ or race
[1:10:33] amen so now there has to be a clearing
[1:10:37] of everything that can be held against
[1:10:40] us and so now that's why it's so
[1:10:43] incredibly important when the when the
[1:10:48] book became open because before the book
[1:10:52] became open you know theologians would
[1:10:55] probe at it and say I think it means
[1:10:56] this and I think it says this and
[1:10:58] because it was the intelligence of man
[1:11:00] trying to understand the scripture they
[1:11:03] may have it 99% right there 100 there
[1:11:05] was the one percent that was wrong right
[1:11:08] that's why it's why brother Barron part
[1:11:10] of the ministry of Malachi 4 was to take
[1:11:12] all the loose ends he calls them and
[1:11:14] bring it all together right because man
[1:11:16] probed at it
[1:11:17] godly meant but they couldn't get the
[1:11:20] whole thing cuz it was in a prophetic
[1:11:21] office that God could anoint to open the
[1:11:23] word hey you're following me just
[1:11:25] right and that's why brother Bram could
[1:11:28] take he he read a lot of things he reads
[1:11:31] an Icee and fathers poutier all those
[1:11:33] your the histories here eclairs Larkins
[1:11:36] books and all different things and he
[1:11:37] would even reference those things but it
[1:11:40] was if you go read Larkins book on the
[1:11:42] church ages there's parts that are
[1:11:43] totally wrong but this parts that are
[1:11:45] right why was happening now God brought
[1:11:47] Elijah okay I'll go back to the we just
[1:11:51] gotta jump back to Kings 18 seeking
[1:11:53] Kings 18 I believe it us let's go there
[1:11:58] because these things I may be totally in
[1:12:04] the wrong place just got first Kings
[1:12:06] anything now this is this is the purpose
[1:12:17] of the spirit of Elijah I'm just I want
[1:12:19] you to understand these things this is
[1:12:21] all to do with the power of the blood
[1:12:22] you say why are you going down this way
[1:12:23] talk about altars and Baylor and Elijah
[1:12:25] it's all part of the power of the blood
[1:12:27] because God has to bring a word now that
[1:12:30] eradicate anything but the devil to say
[1:12:32] they believe this wrong I can hold this
[1:12:34] against them and the spirit of Elijah is
[1:12:37] sent to restore the people back to the
[1:12:41] original right so we have the if you're
[1:12:45] a believer in this word today you have
[1:12:48] the faith of the fathers you have been
[1:12:51] your heart has been turned back to the
[1:12:53] faith of the fathers I meant this is
[1:12:55] what this message does to turn you back
[1:12:57] to the original faith not some other
[1:12:59] faith now now this is on Mount Carmel
[1:13:04] and Elijah has challenged the prophets
[1:13:07] of bale let's just go down to let's go
[1:13:11] down to verse 30 of our first kings 18
[1:13:15] now God has told Elijah go to Mount
[1:13:20] Carmel challenge the prophets of Bale do
[1:13:22] this and I'll answer by fire to prove
[1:13:25] I'm the real God no but you see Elijah
[1:13:29] he came and do you have it there verse
[1:13:31] verse 30 and Elisha said unto all the
[1:13:34] people says after the prophets of Baal
[1:13:35] tried to call call bountiful
[1:13:38] call fire down of course nothing happens
[1:13:40] even though bail was they believe was
[1:13:43] the god of fire but then you see Elijah
[1:13:46] he doesn't build a new altar he says so
[1:13:50] and I just said unto all the people come
[1:13:53] near unto me and all the people came
[1:13:55] near unto him and he repaired the altar
[1:13:57] of the Lord that was broken down so he
[1:14:00] he repaired so they because an altar as
[1:14:03] a approach to God as it not so now that
[1:14:06] the correct altar they should have been
[1:14:07] used it had fallen into disrepair why
[1:14:10] what had happened there trying to
[1:14:11] worship something else and so now the
[1:14:13] spirit of Elijah is there on Mount
[1:14:15] Carmel and he's directed rebuild the
[1:14:18] altar that was originally there so place
[1:14:20] the word exactly how it should be so
[1:14:23] well how does that work today well other
[1:14:25] churches say you sprinkle babies in the
[1:14:28] name of Father Son Holy Ghost in there
[1:14:30] there they go they'll be in heaven or
[1:14:32] just say a sinner's prayer you know and
[1:14:35] get sprinkled some other way you don't
[1:14:37] even need to be baptized or you know
[1:14:39] that's not the right approach Peter said
[1:14:42] on the day of Pentecost repent you know
[1:14:45] be baptized the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:14:46] Christ remission of sin and you shall
[1:14:48] receive the gift of the Holy Ghost amen
[1:14:50] so that is the approach that is the
[1:14:53] right way to come and so now it took the
[1:14:55] spirit of Elijah right to come and
[1:14:58] anoint that you're showing the word this
[1:15:00] is the right approach amen that's why he
[1:15:03] says if you know the first thing you've
[1:15:05] got to recognize as God has not through
[1:15:07] God as one you can't even get the first
[1:15:09] base with God if you think he's through
[1:15:11] okay so now so he rebuilt the altar he
[1:15:16] put the sacrifice on it right
[1:15:18] you know he had put the wood he put the
[1:15:20] sacrifice and he and he got told them to
[1:15:22] build water
[1:15:23] I mean pour pour water upon the
[1:15:25] sacrifice and then finally he says now
[1:15:28] in verse 36 after this was all done and
[1:15:33] it came to pass at the time of the
[1:15:35] evening sacrifice and we're in the
[1:15:37] evening time I'm just touching some very
[1:15:39] highlights here that Elisha the prophet
[1:15:42] came here and said Lord God of Abraham
[1:15:44] Isaac in Israel and of Israel not Jacob
[1:15:47] of Israel let it be known this day that
[1:15:50] thou art God in Israel
[1:15:51] and that I am my servant and that I've
[1:15:54] done all these things at thy word hear
[1:15:56] me o Lord hear me that this people may
[1:15:59] know that thou art the Lord God and that
[1:16:01] thou has turned their heart back again
[1:16:05] this is the purpose of spirit of Elijah
[1:16:07] to turn the people back right and then
[1:16:12] when when John the Baptist came in the
[1:16:14] spirit of Elijah to turn the people from
[1:16:16] the Old Testament traditions to receive
[1:16:19] Christ amen and we know from the rear
[1:16:22] know all Bible readers understand that
[1:16:25] this for Elijah would come in the end
[1:16:26] time to turn the hearts of the people
[1:16:28] back to the original book of Acts faith
[1:16:31] okay and this is where we are I meant so
[1:16:34] that was the purpose of it to turn their
[1:16:36] hearts back again and so now if their
[1:16:39] hearts have been turned back to the
[1:16:40] original then the enemy should have been
[1:16:44] defeated by them right because God told
[1:16:46] Israel if you if you just separate
[1:16:49] yourself unto me don't worship the gods
[1:16:51] of the nations around you don't even
[1:16:53] really don't even intermingle with them
[1:16:55] but cleveland's of the love that God
[1:16:57] then you'll possess the whole land then
[1:16:59] you'll be successful then one will chase
[1:17:01] a thousand to ten thousand right but if
[1:17:04] you do those things if you start to
[1:17:06] worship other things and you know then
[1:17:08] what happened in the book of Judges they
[1:17:10] begin to worship idols in the enemy came
[1:17:13] in they were slaves and God seemed to
[1:17:15] deliverer they kicked out all the idol
[1:17:17] worship and everything and they had
[1:17:19] victory but then idols came back in
[1:17:22] again they became slaves of an enemy
[1:17:24] again the cycle repeated because God was
[1:17:27] showing now if you compromise on the
[1:17:29] word if your heart is not separated unto
[1:17:32] me completely then you become a slave
[1:17:35] again you following me but then now if
[1:17:38] you if you keep in your because it's the
[1:17:42] heart where is your what is I could say
[1:17:45] where is your heart
[1:17:46] where's your affections towards amen
[1:17:50] because if your heart is totally sold
[1:17:52] that upon God he is your all and all
[1:17:54] amen and then you'll be victorious amen
[1:17:59] but then if your heart is on other
[1:18:01] things you know I was listening
[1:18:04] us listening to what was a sermon called
[1:18:09] pride brother pyramids in nineteen fifty
[1:18:12] fifty six and he's preaching assuming
[1:18:15] pride and I don't have any of the quotes
[1:18:18] here but he he goes into speaking of
[1:18:21] Jesus Jesus's feet thing unwashed he
[1:18:25] speaking of Methodists campground
[1:18:26] you should go listen to it listen to the
[1:18:29] whole thing
[1:18:30] don't listen to listen to the whole
[1:18:31] thing and so and and he begins to relate
[1:18:35] how Simon the you know the Pharisee
[1:18:38] invites Jesus and Jesus always goes to
[1:18:40] where he's invited and and how you know
[1:18:43] he would talk about how they wouldn't
[1:18:45] you know wash the feet of the people
[1:18:46] because they would walk down those
[1:18:48] streets they're Palestine and the dung
[1:18:50] of the animals everything would get onto
[1:18:51] their feet their sandals and so they'd
[1:18:53] wash their feet and that anoint them and
[1:18:55] they do certain things in that Bentham
[1:18:57] welcome but Jesus wasn't he was invited
[1:19:00] but he didn't but no one gave him you
[1:19:02] know no one looked after him when he
[1:19:04] came to the door and he just sat there
[1:19:06] in the corner
[1:19:07] yeah this is a Pharisees house they mean
[1:19:10] to be believers in Jehovah yeah right
[1:19:12] they mean to be believers in God this is
[1:19:14] not an atheist house to be believers and
[1:19:16] then he begin to talk about Pharisees
[1:19:18] how they're just actors outwardly just
[1:19:21] displaying something now if someone's
[1:19:23] just a Pharisee you know their heart is
[1:19:26] somewhere else their heart is on the
[1:19:28] pride of how great they can look like a
[1:19:30] bunch of peacocks they can you know
[1:19:32] appear to be all humble and yielded and
[1:19:34] whatever more but they people can become
[1:19:36] proud and just that we're just going on
[1:19:39] a Segway for a little bit I hope you're
[1:19:40] with me hold on okay so he's talking
[1:19:44] about those things you're a bunch of
[1:19:45] Pharisees and you know but then he said
[1:19:47] Jesus was uncomfortable he was sitting
[1:19:50] in this feast he was put in the corner
[1:19:52] with unwashed feet you know the stink of
[1:19:54] the day on him and everything he wasn't
[1:19:56] like the rest of them made welcome and
[1:19:58] Jesus felt uncomfortable he was a man
[1:20:01] like us mention that the Lord of glory
[1:20:03] was invited to a house and he felt
[1:20:06] uncomfortable because he always comes to
[1:20:08] where he's invited amen
[1:20:10] any-any was saying it's the same thing
[1:20:12] we invite them we invite them but we
[1:20:16] don't make him welcome
[1:20:17] and here was Hill as a woman who wasn't
[1:20:19] even invited to the feast
[1:20:20] you should just just go listen to it
[1:20:22] whatever you do here's your homework
[1:20:23] class for the week go listen to the
[1:20:26] sermon fried the whole thing whatever
[1:20:27] you do and then so now she she's there
[1:20:31] yo she gets the alabaster box anointest
[1:20:34] feet
[1:20:34] begins to cry washes his feet anoints
[1:20:37] his feet dries his feet with her tears
[1:20:39] yo she's all beside herself she doesn't
[1:20:41] care what anyone else thinks about it
[1:20:43] but here she takes these feet where
[1:20:46] Redemption was going to come out of the
[1:20:47] wounds amen eternal life was going to be
[1:20:51] released by the by the piercing of my
[1:20:53] hands and my feet it was prophesied she
[1:20:55] was taking these feet that her
[1:20:57] redemption was going to come out of you
[1:20:58] understand what I'm saying because the
[1:21:00] life was going to come out because he
[1:21:02] was the lamb and she was doing him a
[1:21:04] service worshiping him and here's the
[1:21:07] same feet and these people said I won't
[1:21:09] even wash your feet you're not welcome
[1:21:11] basically we invite you but you just go
[1:21:13] sit over there and Jesus felt
[1:21:15] uncomfortable and I was thinking when I
[1:21:18] heard that I thought Lord I want you
[1:21:21] always to be comfortable amen in my life
[1:21:24] here in our homes ever Lord may you
[1:21:28] never feel uncomfortable by what I do
[1:21:32] amen because we have to understand there
[1:21:37] is great power and I see it a while ago
[1:21:39] there was great power and humility
[1:21:41] because humility will get you what you
[1:21:44] need
[1:21:45] pride God resists the proud a mint and
[1:21:49] God is way stronger than you so you can
[1:21:53] never win if you're proud but if you're
[1:21:55] humble he giveth grace to the humble
[1:21:57] amen so here is this woman it wasn't
[1:22:00] even invited to the feast and she
[1:22:02] received what they should have got
[1:22:03] mentioned his Pharisees they knew this
[1:22:06] Bible real well they should have
[1:22:09] recognized because you know he come the
[1:22:13] wise men into Jerusalem we've seen us
[1:22:15] down these have come to worship Him
[1:22:16] where is he born King of the Jews
[1:22:18] they're all like what's this going on
[1:22:20] and then here at us the your ask the
[1:22:23] scribes where would he be born or
[1:22:25] basically here you know and you know the
[1:22:28] city's in a bit of an uproar cause he
[1:22:29] company's wise been asking the
[1:22:31] things and then the wise men go down to
[1:22:33] basically him they find them as soon as
[1:22:34] they come out from outside of Jerusalem
[1:22:37] I see a star again and their God rejoice
[1:22:39] and they and they find them and they
[1:22:41] give him the gifts then they leave
[1:22:43] then he recognizes he must have really
[1:22:46] been born they win another way so he
[1:22:49] sent soldiers to killed two you know two
[1:22:51] and under and then the great and then
[1:22:55] you even go back before that his John
[1:22:56] the Baptist and before he's born his
[1:22:59] father's in the temple
[1:23:00] you know these things would have been
[1:23:02] talked about yeah they weren't just it
[1:23:05] wouldn't just be not happened than
[1:23:07] everyone forgot about it you know his
[1:23:09] his John the Baptist father Zacharias
[1:23:10] and the temple and the altar of incense
[1:23:13] you're gonna hit you're gonna have you
[1:23:16] know you're gonna bring forth famine
[1:23:18] he's gonna come forth as you know spirit
[1:23:19] of Elijah and he's going to turn the
[1:23:21] hearts of the children I mean the
[1:23:23] father's to the children season
[1:23:25] Luke 1:17 he didn't believe the angels
[1:23:28] message he comes out he can't speak
[1:23:31] what's happened he's seen a vision of an
[1:23:33] angel and finally John's born you know
[1:23:37] and and then Elizabeth you know John's
[1:23:39] mum says call him John and then of
[1:23:41] course you know they say well shouldn't
[1:23:43] we call him Sakurai's because there's no
[1:23:45] John in your family and then he picks up
[1:23:47] John I mean Zechariah picks up the
[1:23:49] writing tablet call his name John and
[1:23:51] immediately his mouth comes open and he
[1:23:54] begins to praise the Lord or whatever
[1:23:55] happened and then now so those things
[1:23:57] would have been spoken about yes but
[1:24:00] every now and then now here comes Mary
[1:24:02] here comes Mary with Jesus eight days
[1:24:06] old into the temple they can't afford a
[1:24:09] lamb they take pictures and she's she
[1:24:13] said you're there all the other woman

[1:24:58] Peace of us are all coming how they are
[1:25:01] gonna see the Messiah so here he was
[1:25:03] it's something happen do you think God
[1:25:06] you're with God as his always his
[1:25:07] presence I meant here was the word the
[1:25:10] lamb became flesh he ought to be an
[1:25:13] atmosphere and as a baby he made you
[1:25:15] walk into that manger just it was just a
[1:25:17] cave on the side of a hill the problem

[1:25:46] became flesh and you a son is given a
[1:25:50] child was born
[1:25:51] hallelujah and it's annachi now he's

[1:26:05] start of look and then comes was it
[1:26:07] enter the blind prophet is she stoned
[1:26:10] blind faith the Spirit of God says stand
[1:26:12] up begins to guide her through the crowd

[1:27:00] why the priesthood you know so what do
[1:27:01] you think yeah weird you from and then
[1:27:05] what comes out of his mouth he'd have
[1:27:08] some question about the Bible
[1:27:09] what does it mean this what do you think
[1:27:11] this and you know facing the wood
[1:27:13] because he is the wood I mean no doubt

[1:27:32] name Jesus you know that I'm not trying
[1:27:37] to be silly but you know that wouldn't
[1:27:38] happen to every day and now here he
[1:27:41] comes he's not 12 he's entered into his
[1:27:43] ministry
[1:27:44] hallelujah where the angel the Covenant
[1:27:46] came and dwelt in a mama yo when he was
[1:27:49] baptized hallelujah here he is in

[1:28:05] know if he really knew who that was
[1:28:07] give him the highest place let me wash
[1:28:10] his feet oh god I want to wash your feet
[1:28:13] hallelujah right but he didn't know he's
[1:28:17] blinded to it but here we are now we've

[1:28:26] price I'm the ransom hallelujah I'm
[1:28:29] gonna take this earth off Satan's grip

[1:28:36] they should be
[1:28:37] hallelujah having dominion he's walking
[1:28:40] around it's in his veins he doesn't
[1:28:42] carry it in a bag it's his very life
[1:28:45] hallelujah and he looks down at people
[1:28:48] brother branham at the internet service
[1:28:50] campground two people and he says anyone
[1:28:52] here who wants to stand up receive this
[1:28:55] Jesus not one they seized under vision I
[1:28:59] can see darkness over people because
[1:29:01] listen to it that sermon influences that
[1:29:03] I quoted from a few a few Sundays ago
[1:29:06] he said yo he makes an altar call I
[1:29:09] think there's maybe one or two he says
[1:29:11] you've done the most horrible thing and
[1:29:14] he begins to call out God just forgives
[1:29:16] us sure this one's got this and the one
[1:29:18] next you've got this wrong and this one
[1:29:19] just go virtually just down a row in a
[1:29:21] row and the whole altars just tech to
[1:29:23] people I think to me I think they came a
[1:29:27] bit late we shouldn't need I remember
[1:29:31] you say I'm going to bring it back to
[1:29:33] where what you know what we're talking
[1:29:34] about but we shouldn't need some great
[1:29:36] big fantastic
[1:29:37] they were looking there we want to see
[1:29:39] discernment should be more than they
[1:29:41] said Lord I want to hear your work I
[1:29:42] want to hear the words of life and not
[1:29:45] just hear them but change my life I'm
[1:29:48] gonna be impacted I want to be just
[1:29:50] changed by your word amen and so now
[1:29:53] here we are and sometimes we think we
[1:29:57] need something big I don't feel it
[1:29:59] who's there who's been there meaning I
[1:30:02] don't feel it today I don't feel like
[1:30:04] I'm a Christian I don't feel like I'm
[1:30:05] victorious forget what you feel forget
[1:30:09] what you feel
[1:30:10] amen the word says that you are the word
[1:30:13] says I've made you worthy the word says
[1:30:15] you are the redeemed
[1:30:16] here comes the bride spotless wash
[1:30:20] hallelujah
[1:30:21] pure more pure than anything you can
[1:30:23] think of over this world maintenance
[1:30:25] image holy hallelujah and you're in that
[1:30:29] category that's you that's what you've
[1:30:31] been made I don't say if only one day
[1:30:35] know now now you are the Bible says now
[1:30:39] we are the sons of God
[1:30:41] let's daughter son as a position
[1:30:42] remember it's an angel now we are not
[1:30:44] one day will obtain we've obtained are
[1:30:48] you with me are you but we've got to
[1:30:50] grow just grow take your land they
[1:30:54] didn't become or is release just because
[1:30:55] they're in the promised land there are
[1:30:57] lights by birth hallelujah and they just
[1:31:00] possess the promise Amy we are redeemed
[1:31:05] it's more than a song the bride of Jesus
[1:31:08] Christ has been redeemed by one offering
[1:31:11] he doesn't need to come and die again
[1:31:13] I mean he doesn't need any more blood he
[1:31:16] paid it in full
[1:31:17] he made sure he paid it in full you say
[1:31:20] this is very elementary no free if
[1:31:22] there's just anchor in your soul a
[1:31:23] little bit deeper that we don't need to
[1:31:26] obtain we don't need to you know man
[1:31:28] wants to evolve into something great
[1:31:31] amen that man is looking to evolve into
[1:31:35] something immortal that's why if time
[1:31:37] will go on man and machine will melt
[1:31:42] they meant all the science fiction crazy
[1:31:44] stuff that they thought that's never
[1:31:46] going to happen it's on the doorstep and
[1:31:48] because man is trying to become immortal
[1:31:50] and he knows that this thing will decay
[1:31:53] if we can't stop this thing aging hey
[1:31:56] hey it's in the DNA you know gets
[1:31:59] shorter and shorter called telomeres
[1:32:01] this these actually proteins on the end
[1:32:03] get shorter and shorter and shorter and
[1:32:05] yeah we age so they say well if we can't
[1:32:09] stop that happening then we'll just put
[1:32:10] ourselves into machines can't put life
[1:32:15] into a machine you say well they'll try
[1:32:18] it says on the Tower of Babel days yeah
[1:32:22] if you're read in Genesis you'll say God
[1:32:25] sees if we don't scatter them there is
[1:32:28] nothing that they don't imagine that you
[1:32:31] know what they imagine they'll be able
[1:32:32] to do it sure you read that
[1:32:42] so Genesis 11:6 this is why this is why
[1:32:49] God has to bringing in Genesis 11:6 we
[1:32:53] just need that one verse and God said
[1:32:57] Behold the people is one know and the
[1:33:00] Lord said Behold the people is one and
[1:33:02] they have all one language and this they
[1:33:04] begin to do and now nothing will be
[1:33:07] restrained from them which they have
[1:33:08] imagined to do that's why God had to
[1:33:11] scatter them because it was an
[1:33:13] antichrist system so by Antichrist means
[1:33:16] thou trying to let's make a name for
[1:33:18] ourselves this we'd be scattered and
[1:33:21] what's man want to do now we must become
[1:33:23] immortal and we have the technology yeah
[1:33:28] that's why God has to bring it into it
[1:33:30] all because man is trying so man is
[1:33:33] trying to evolve itself under a greater
[1:33:35] thing that's not what we are called to
[1:33:37] be this is how we it's because remember
[1:33:42] I said a servant could not become a son
[1:33:44] or daughter a son a daughter was born
[1:33:47] right and because you you always were a
[1:33:51] son or daughter of God you did not
[1:33:53] become one amen you say no you did not
[1:33:58] become it by your birth your birth your
[1:34:01] your new birth I'm talking about your
[1:34:03] new birth just signifies to you and to
[1:34:05] God I am a son I mean because God is now
[1:34:09] placing his hand upon you saying you
[1:34:11] belong to me you are my son or my
[1:34:13] daughter and you need to know it because
[1:34:16] God knows it God knows that Jesus said
[1:34:19] all that the father has given me will
[1:34:22] come to me and all that come to me all
[1:34:25] no wise cast out amen so it doesn't
[1:34:29] matter you say well I don't know if I am
[1:34:31] a son or daughter just come to him
[1:34:32] anyway I'm glad see see Jesus I'm so
[1:34:35] glad you know he puts things in his word
[1:34:37] to stop the devil try say yeah because
[1:34:39] the devil comes is are you not a son or
[1:34:41] daughter well even if that's true I come
[1:34:43] cuz you see though no wise cast you out
[1:34:46] hallelujah he says it a mixed breath I'm
[1:34:49] so glad about that
[1:34:50] so now but you have to recognize your
[1:34:52] son or daughter
[1:34:53] amen and if I'm a son or daughter of God
[1:34:56] I'm a joint year with Christ amen even
[1:35:00] you know even my little girls they are
[1:35:03] my daughters
[1:35:03] well they're just little babies yet but
[1:35:06] they're still my daughters and well have
[1:35:09] they become because they were part my
[1:35:11] DNA is and then my life is in them Hey
[1:35:14] they can't train to become like me
[1:35:17] they just good or bad they become like
[1:35:19] me if I it's true they don't you know
[1:35:24] you see facial expressions do you see
[1:35:26] how they do things you think oh dear
[1:35:29] atta back in a minute from my side you
[1:35:33] know but you can't they can't help it
[1:35:36] you know
[1:35:38] I'll say this my dad will see this
[1:35:39] because I lose it but you know I screwed
[1:35:41] up you know hitting all these little
[1:35:44] little songs and things and I think man
[1:35:46] I thought I'm not gonna do that
[1:35:49] and then as soon as Annalise is born oh
[1:35:52] it's like a sweat just goes buh and you
[1:35:54] can't turn it off you know but I'm
[1:36:01] saying that because it was in me right I
[1:36:05] came to a certain stage of life where it
[1:36:07] just happened
[1:36:08] yeah amen it's the same thing with you
[1:36:10] here you are wherever you're born
[1:36:12] whatever decade whatever culture
[1:36:14] whatever influence but in you and you is
[1:36:18] something very different than your
[1:36:20] natural learning and use is you actually
[1:36:23] have the spiritual DNA father MCS is a
[1:36:26] gene seed of God that was put in there
[1:36:29] before the foundation of the world
[1:36:31] amen so in you was that or is there and
[1:36:35] then now but then that has to come into
[1:36:38] the right atmosphere to come to life
[1:36:39] because what is yo
[1:36:41] yeah we're born in this world and you
[1:36:44] know we say well this is my mummy and
[1:36:47] daddy or this is my daddy or this is my
[1:36:48] mommy what whatever home we're raised
[1:36:50] and this is this is me and this is my
[1:36:52] identity there's my culture you know
[1:36:55] healings the best or whatever South
[1:36:57] Africa or whatever country you know you
[1:36:59] think this is this is my identity but
[1:37:01] that's not our identity there's nothing
[1:37:05] to do with it that's yo that is going to
[1:37:08] fade away this country won't be
[1:37:10] remembered amen it won't be when the new
[1:37:14] heavens and new earth to here we may
[1:37:16] have failed to find the exact
[1:37:17] coordinates I don't know what this part
[1:37:18] of the globe will be like but I know
[1:37:20] it'll be glorious it'll be far better
[1:37:22] than it is now Alleluia and we might
[1:37:25] come here for a few well there's no time
[1:37:26] but a few million years you'll say
[1:37:27] remember this spot how lujah there may
[1:37:30] maybe go up the forest lakes remember
[1:37:32] what happened there he'll go up to
[1:37:33] Taranaki member what happened there well
[1:37:35] your River of being and God did
[1:37:36] something for us it won't be like how it
[1:37:38] is I won't even be remembered but
[1:37:42] there's something in us we we come to
[1:37:46] realize we are not brother brems said he
[1:37:50] realized he is not the son and daughter
[1:37:51] of Charles and Ella Brennan even though
[1:37:54] he was after the flesh but he realized I
[1:37:56] am a son of God I'm a son of God and so
[1:38:00] now the blood shows us these things
[1:38:04] right because God washes us opens our
[1:38:08] eyes give us an understanding that this
[1:38:13] is who we really are
[1:38:15] amen it does mean anything to you you
[1:38:19] say well I'm going through you know life
[1:38:23] for such a great transition I used to
[1:38:26] think just going through teenage time
[1:38:28] was a big change
[1:38:29] there's nothing amen you just go back a
[1:38:33] few years and say man life has changed
[1:38:34] you go back a few more years man life
[1:38:36] really changed then and I think it just
[1:38:39] keeps keeps changing but one thing
[1:38:42] should always be never changing
[1:38:44] Lord you are the same yesterday today
[1:38:46] and forever you are my god you have
[1:38:49] washed me I am redeemed by your blood
[1:38:52] amen because if you keep that as because
[1:38:54] that does not change so it's whatever
[1:38:57] you go through in life doesn't matter
[1:38:59] what change in life it is going from a
[1:39:01] child to an adult or middle age or what
[1:39:06] do they call it now a pre quarter life
[1:39:08] crisis instead of a midlife crisis you
[1:39:11] know because people don't have a no
[1:39:12] notice because people have no no
[1:39:15] foundation what am i where
[1:39:17] know who I really am and people get
[1:39:19] scared oh well I can't be like this
[1:39:22] forever I got to change and do this but
[1:39:24] then they come down the road so I can't
[1:39:25] be like this forever I'm going to change
[1:39:26] and do this and they'll throw their
[1:39:28] family under the bus and go do this and
[1:39:30] do this and do this and and where are
[1:39:32] they but then if there's something in
[1:39:34] you saying no I'm a child of the king
[1:39:37] his Spirit will make this come into
[1:39:40] subjection amen he is in control we
[1:39:44] don't just want to float with the tide
[1:39:46] flow it with the stream the streamwise
[1:39:49] goes downhill we meant to go up
[1:39:53] hallelujah now God and simplicity I just
[1:39:59] let me read this he says when a man
[1:40:01] sinned he separated himself from God and
[1:40:03] crossed a grow a giant chasm and put
[1:40:06] himself and death on this side now we
[1:40:09] were born that way there's a cap member
[1:40:12] we read he broke down that middle wall
[1:40:13] of partition right he's left there's no
[1:40:18] way back so man is here God is here
[1:40:20] there's no way to bridge the gulf
[1:40:21] there's no way for him to get back but
[1:40:24] when he did God accepted a substitute
[1:40:27] which was a lamb or a goat or a sheep or
[1:40:29] something for blood which Adam spoke or
[1:40:32] Abel spoke on the other side of the
[1:40:34] chasm on that side he's he's a son of
[1:40:38] God he's an offspring from God he's an
[1:40:41] adherent he's an inheritance of the
[1:40:42] earth he can control nature he can speak
[1:40:45] into existence why he's a creator
[1:40:47] himself even he's an offspring of God
[1:40:49] but when he crossed he separate he
[1:40:52] separated a sonship he's a sinner by
[1:40:54] nature so it goes from that so now a
[1:40:56] sinner by nature he's under the hand and
[1:40:59] Dominion of Satan and God took a
[1:41:01] sacrifice a chemical of the blood but
[1:41:03] the blood of bulls and goats did not
[1:41:05] divorce sin and only covered sin if
[1:41:07] you've got a red spot on my hand and
[1:41:09] covered it with white the red spot still
[1:41:11] there see it's still there but God sent
[1:41:13] down from heaven a bleach person it was
[1:41:15] the blood of his own son that we now
[1:41:18] confess sin drops into God's bleach try
[1:41:21] to find it again now I want to say this
[1:41:23] because you say well how did you feel
[1:41:25] when you did that don't go by feeling
[1:41:29] I'm in faith is not a feeling faith is
[1:41:33] the substance of things hoped for so
[1:41:35] it's actually a no so that you know you
[1:41:37] have it
[1:41:38] faith is not hope okay but so faith
[1:41:43] brother I mean you know the Lord Jesus
[1:41:45] never said do you feel that he says do
[1:41:48] you believe it do you believe it okay so
[1:41:52] when said you just be some the most
[1:41:57] answer you can be just be real sincere
[1:41:59] so he need to be right okay now so we're
[1:42:05] now confessed sin drops into God's
[1:42:07] bleach trying to find it again his blood
[1:42:09] try to find again the coloring of sin
[1:42:11] goes back through the mediators and down
[1:42:13] through time until it hits the accuser
[1:42:16] Satan and lays on him till the day of
[1:42:19] judgment okay now what happens to the
[1:42:22] son he becomes in perfect fellowship
[1:42:25] with the father again
[1:42:26] standing on the other side of the chasm
[1:42:28] with no remembrance of sin against them
[1:42:31] no more there's no more stain of bleach
[1:42:33] can be seen anywhere he's free
[1:42:34] hallelujah just as that Clorox or that
[1:42:37] ink can never be inked no more because
[1:42:40] it's broke up and sent back again and
[1:42:42] when sinners and when confession is
[1:42:45] confessed and being dropped into the
[1:42:49] bleach a man or a woman that's been
[1:42:50] dipped into the blood of Jesus Christ it
[1:42:53] kills all symptoms and every molecule of
[1:42:56] sin goes back to the devil and laid on
[1:42:59] him to the day of judgment where his
[1:43:01] eternal destination we throw it into the
[1:43:03] lake of fire and the chasm is bridged
[1:43:05] and never to be coming to remembrance no
[1:43:07] more and a man stands justified as a son
[1:43:10] of God and he says simplicity so he says
[1:43:14] before sin man was a creator he had
[1:43:17] dominion but with cities on this other
[1:43:20] side of the chasm but when sinners
[1:43:22] confess into the blood of Jesus Christ
[1:43:24] that sin that you did that you should
[1:43:27] have yo taken the penalty for amen when
[1:43:32] Jesus took your penalty on Calvary the
[1:43:34] wrath that we should have received he
[1:43:36] took on Calvary amen
[1:43:38] but then now sin has to be destroyed
[1:43:40] does it not so now it goes back
[1:43:43] the one who initiated certain in the
[1:43:45] beginning which is Satan that's why the
[1:43:47] great white throne judgment is just a
[1:43:50] far bigger picture to what was in
[1:43:52] Genesis chapter 3 who did this the woman
[1:43:56] you gave me you know and then she says
[1:43:59] the serpent beguiled me
[1:44:01] that's why does this happen so so the so
[1:44:04] that so so God just takes us his finger
[1:44:07] and he gonna say now who caused this and
[1:44:10] then they give the evidence and then
[1:44:11] because Satan can hide anything it goes
[1:44:13] back onto the serpent right and who
[1:44:16] inspired the serpent to do it Satan
[1:44:17] himself so now the sin that was came
[1:44:20] into the world has just gone back onto
[1:44:21] the accuser and so the accuser becomes
[1:44:24] the accused
[1:44:25] right so the one who's trying to condemn
[1:44:27] everyone actually all the fingers get
[1:44:30] point back at him and he's actually the
[1:44:32] guilty one hallelujah so it's not us as
[1:44:35] guilty anymore it's him and he is going
[1:44:38] to take absence into the lake of fire
[1:44:40] hallelujah amen he says now when when
[1:44:44] sinners confessed into the you know into
[1:44:46] the blood of Jesus Christ amen
[1:44:49] it it takes sin away now you say this is
[1:44:53] so simple it is so to me it's amazing
[1:44:56] okay because you got it has to be in
[1:44:59] reality I trust this is in reality to
[1:45:02] you when sinners confessed and dropped
[1:45:05] into the blood of Jesus Christ
[1:45:06] it's like ink falling into Bleach right
[1:45:10] and then so the sinners broke it up and
[1:45:12] you can't find it anymore
[1:45:13] amen and it is not held against you
[1:45:16] anymore right and then so now all the
[1:45:19] symptoms so when a person is dipped into
[1:45:20] the blood how you dip this know if
[1:45:22] there's no VAT of blood you can be
[1:45:24] dipped into physically but it's by faith
[1:45:26] receiving what he's done for you because
[1:45:29] it's already been done
[1:45:30] is this clear yeah so it kills all
[1:45:34] symptoms and every molecule of sin goes
[1:45:37] back to the devil and laid on him to the
[1:45:39] day of judgment where his eternal
[1:45:40] destination will be thrown into a lake
[1:45:43] of fire Alleluia
[1:45:45] so the accuser becomes the accused now
[1:45:49] here we are by one offering we forever
[1:45:58] perfected there he is perfected forever
[1:46:00] them that are sanctified by one offering
[1:46:03] it's not - you say you say this all the
[1:46:05] time but it's got a sink down we can't
[1:46:08] you know brother brave seasoned perfect
[1:46:10] faith if I believe it as something wrong
[1:46:12] they automatically put themselves back
[1:46:14] as a sinner again he says you must never
[1:46:16] do that right because we don't we don't
[1:46:19] start our journey you know this is not
[1:46:21] like monopoly where you go pass go all
[1:46:23] the time right
[1:46:25] you start your walk with God you leave
[1:46:27] Egypt he calls you out of the world
[1:46:29] hello you saying yeah I was back there
[1:46:32] and then he takes you through the Red
[1:46:34] Sea and your enemy is defeated behind
[1:46:36] you who has dominion over their enemies
[1:46:38] now amen the things that once your
[1:46:41] oppressor they did Amen and they just a
[1:46:44] trophy on your wall or however you want
[1:46:46] to put it and this and now you go
[1:46:47] through and then now you've been through
[1:46:49] the being through the wilderness who's
[1:46:51] been sanctified who's being sanctified
[1:46:54] amen and then you come to Jordan and
[1:46:56] then you die completely to yourself amen
[1:47:01] you cross Jordan by the word that's why
[1:47:04] it's that's why it's such a powerful
[1:47:06] thing the Levites now the Levites
[1:47:09] carried had their cross Jordan the
[1:47:11] Levites carried the ark and when they
[1:47:14] put their foot in the Jordan at separate
[1:47:16] the water and then the Ark stood there
[1:47:19] and Israel passed through and then once
[1:47:22] Israel passed over the Levites step down
[1:47:25] to the river and the river flowed again
[1:47:27] that chose now because the ark is the
[1:47:29] word so the ark
[1:47:31] being carried over the heart of the
[1:47:32] priest the Levite gives an opening for
[1:47:35] the people to go into the land aim it
[1:47:38] and so here we are here you are this
[1:47:41] message brings you into the promised
[1:47:43] land brings you into Christ really not
[1:47:45] just being in the wilderness and God
[1:47:47] anointing and doing things but now you
[1:47:48] step into your inheritance
[1:47:50] amen but now ah here we are now we've
[1:47:54] come to a I I just I just go to D
[1:47:55] because that's when the campaign went
[1:47:57] sideways quickly where Aitken took the
[1:48:00] yo the government and the wij of gold
[1:48:02] now Joshua and say hold on let's go back
[1:48:05] to
[1:48:05] young started getting he didn't go back
[1:48:08] but this is why you do in your mind I've
[1:48:11] got to go back to eat I've got a Oh Lord
[1:48:13] forgive me I'm a sinner he says well
[1:48:15] what do you mean now you believe because
[1:48:18] sin is unbelief is it not and be lord
[1:48:21] help my unbelief
[1:48:22] but you know remember brother brems says
[1:48:25] someone who's bored they just totally
[1:48:27] all under the blackness of sin that's
[1:48:30] why someone has not even made a step
[1:48:32] towards you know the Lord you can't tell
[1:48:34] them now you've got to stop dressing
[1:48:36] this way you're gonna stop smoking these
[1:48:38] things and drinking these things and
[1:48:39] watching these things and you've got to
[1:48:40] do this and this and this no because
[1:48:42] unbelief just governs the entire life
[1:48:45] doesn't do them any good they haven't
[1:48:47] even started right God doesn't condemn
[1:48:50] the sinner cuz he since he condemns him
[1:48:52] cuz he just doesn't he totally unbelief
[1:48:54] right and then so now but now we when we
[1:48:58] do things wrong that's why I says you
[1:49:00] should know stop doing these things to
[1:49:01] change what you're doing amen is that
[1:49:04] okay so Joshua didn't say now let's go
[1:49:07] back to Egypt he said let's keep they
[1:49:08] see what's going wrong let's let's fix
[1:49:12] this and keep taking on with the
[1:49:13] conquest and that's what they did it's
[1:49:15] the same thing with you and I it's not
[1:49:17] him the Falls with him that gets back up
[1:49:20] amen you're the steps of a good man
[1:49:23] ordered of the Lord and he delights in
[1:49:25] his way though he fall though fall he
[1:49:27] shall not be cast down the Lord upholds
[1:49:29] him in his hand does not heaven that
[1:49:32] falls and stays at him that gets back up
[1:49:34] that is the overcomer I mean the devil
[1:49:37] may may knock you out in the first round
[1:49:39] but you just just get back up Here I am
[1:49:43] Alleluia eventually hey it's either
[1:49:46] eventually you will would Amen
[1:49:50] eventually you will whoop but you have
[1:49:52] to have confidence and the one who's
[1:49:55] bought you because he is the one that
[1:49:58] not only trained you but he gives you
[1:49:59] the strength to overcome because it says
[1:50:01] in Revelation chapter 12 they overcame
[1:50:05] him by the blood of the Lamb and the
[1:50:08] word of their testimony they overcame
[1:50:10] Satan by the blood of lamb and the word
[1:50:12] of their testimony
[1:50:13] so okay do we want to read that let's go
[1:50:16] to
[1:50:17] you know I see I see we're turning pages
[1:50:20] let's go to revelations chapter 12 and
[1:50:29] verse 11 now remember I love Revelation
[1:50:33] chapter 12 because it shows the devil
[1:50:36] lost in heaven and the same God that
[1:50:38] kicked him out of heaven has now come
[1:50:40] into human flesh and is kicking him out
[1:50:43] of here amen that's what God got at
[1:50:45] victory in heaven now he puts on human
[1:50:47] flesh near his victory here hallelujah
[1:50:50] and you happen to be the bodies he's in
[1:50:52] Laurie amen so now how did they overcome
[1:50:55] this great you know we think of this
[1:50:56] great devil and all isn't he terrible
[1:50:58] yeah he's a slicker
[1:50:59] but he's defeated he's a bluff that's
[1:51:01] how he it's through deception it's
[1:51:03] always been through deception that he is
[1:51:05] he has got a hold of people right but
[1:51:08] when he's exposed
[1:51:09] that's why Satan hides and secrets
[1:51:11] that's why you should never have secrets
[1:51:13] between you and your spouse you should
[1:51:16] never have any separation yeah tell me
[1:51:18] well we live in the same house but there
[1:51:20] shouldn't be any spiritual separation
[1:51:22] right and then so now he says and they
[1:51:26] overcame him Satan by the blood of the
[1:51:30] Lamb and by the word of their testimony
[1:51:32] and they loved not their lives unto the
[1:51:35] death
[1:51:35] so they overcame him by the blood of the
[1:51:38] Lamb yes and the word of it
[1:51:40] now what is your testimony your
[1:51:42] testimony is now you give evidence that
[1:51:44] his word is true I mean what is a
[1:51:46] testimony when you go into court you're
[1:51:48] giving evidence this happened here this
[1:51:49] happen here this is what happened here
[1:51:51] so now your testimony is God's Word is
[1:51:54] right God's Word is truth amen we're
[1:51:58] testifying that God's Word is overcoming
[1:52:00] power we are testifying his blood is
[1:52:03] more than enough amen that's how they
[1:52:06] overcame him now this scripture is being
[1:52:09] looked out today 2017
[1:52:12] amen because as the devil is your
[1:52:16] brother man says as the devil has been
[1:52:18] cast down the bride of sins amen and we
[1:52:21] are ascending we are ascending you go
[1:52:24] you look at back where where you were
[1:52:26] five ten years ago and the things that
[1:52:30] you had battles with and couldn't
[1:52:32] overcome and hated yourself for now
[1:52:34] they're just victories remember that
[1:52:36] campaign year we won it decisive victory
[1:52:39] move on we're asking we wipe out this
[1:52:41] enemy hallelujah
[1:52:43] so they overcame him by the blood lemon
[1:52:46] so it doesn't it does not say they
[1:52:48] overcame him by their own ability I just
[1:52:51] want to be real
[1:52:52] you say this is laborious no it's not
[1:52:54] because subconsciously if we can get
[1:52:57] this and we can just kick this out
[1:52:58] that is God's enablement that we are
[1:53:01] victorious and is by it not by power by
[1:53:04] might but by my spirit saith the Lord
[1:53:06] who has a spirit of God in them a man
[1:53:09] that means just by his Spirit he will do
[1:53:10] this just like when they're rebuilding
[1:53:12] Jerusalem Zechariah prophesied not by
[1:53:15] power not by might not by political will
[1:53:18] not by how you'll humanely rebuild the
[1:53:21] city by my spirit I'll anoint you to
[1:53:23] rebuild it
[1:53:24] amen yes sir so now I say so he's not
[1:53:28] saying by your ability by their ability
[1:53:30] they overcame all because they felt
[1:53:33] victorious for a week they overcame or
[1:53:35] because they were so happy they overcame
[1:53:39] amen by the blow the limb you're not
[1:53:42] even really in that verse you're on your
[1:53:44] own human ability right it says it says
[1:53:47] sacrifice and you can facing that it
[1:53:50] works and it's for you and it's true I
[1:53:53] meant that's how they overcome now we
[1:53:56] have some musicians to come we did I
[1:53:57] think I'll just land the plane I'll just
[1:54:01] keep going on but you see it's by him
[1:54:04] right there is power power
[1:54:08] wonder-working power in the blood of
[1:54:10] lamb but do you have confidence do you
[1:54:13] have confidence in it amen
[1:54:17] this is a walk of faith say well I don't
[1:54:20] know how this is going to turn out yeah
[1:54:21] we yeah you do what do you
[1:54:24] you know you have to look at I'm going
[1:54:28] in a rapture my family's going in a
[1:54:30] rapture no weapon formed against me
[1:54:32] shall prosper well let's let's let's
[1:54:35] read that shall we
[1:54:36] now remember this is under the Old
[1:54:38] Testament but to me it's just magnified
[1:54:44] in the new now if I can even is it in
[1:54:53] Isaiah 53 here we are
[1:54:56] Bible Quiz by me the scripture no weapon
[1:55:00] formed against me shall prosper so this
[1:55:02] is the excellent 5041 because the devil
[1:55:16] will form weapons just like an you just
[1:55:19] take a world war that goes on a bit
[1:55:21] longer the each side is trying to
[1:55:23] develop a new weapon to take out the
[1:55:25] enemy so no weapon that is formed
[1:55:28] against thee shall prosper and every
[1:55:31] tongue that shall rise against the in
[1:55:33] judgement shall condemn so now oh that
[1:55:37] is now right so every time so everything
[1:55:41] that rise up against you do you think
[1:55:44] you're really a believer do you think
[1:55:45] you're really the Bride of Christ you
[1:55:47] really think you're overcoming you
[1:55:49] really think you're gonna do it you have
[1:55:51] to condemn that time I meant because the
[1:55:54] member he's the accuser of the Brethren
[1:55:57] amen you read that in Revelations 12 as
[1:55:59] well so he will accuse you he does
[1:56:02] doesn't know what stand you amen you
[1:56:05] know he he it's like Zechariah I mean um
