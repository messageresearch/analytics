praise God he it's not me it's him it's God you know God is the one that can express these things and so I just encourage you tonight to invite Jesus to your pew amen open your heart and just let Jesus deal in your life because you don't have to leave here the same amen and I believe that great changes can happen in your life to prepare you for Camp amen hey don't don't go to Camp empty and void and you know in desperate need of Revival go to Camp already in Revival amen settle the score you know keep shorter counts with God don't save it for special occasions tonight is a special occasion not because of any of us but because he is here and wherever two or three gather he's in our midst amen hallelujah I want to speak tonight on a subject called victory over lust with a sub title of the healing of our breach amen I'll explain that soon amen Lord willing so if you can turn in your Bibles to Isaiah chapter 30. verse 26 and we will hit this context about halfway through exactly what we're going to be talking about in with the repair of the bridge who believes Jesus Christ is the repairer of the breach amen hallelujah amen says here in verse 26 moreover the light of the moon shall be as the light of the sun and the light of the sun shall be Sevenfold as the light of seven days hallelujah in the day so in that in the day that the Lord binds up the breach of his people and heals The Stroke of their wound you may be seated Hallelujah amen and we all know we've heard lots of preaching on this scripture that this is the day we're living in amen that at the end time God would gather the light of every age and the message of all the prophets and everything and Consolidated it into one message and reveal the Seven Seals that was sealing the book for all this time and he would reveal everything and give the title deed back to humanity who believes that so therefore light of every age has been Consolidated shining on the moon hello moon the Moon is now reflecting the sunlight so it's in that day that he would bind up the bridge of his people it hasn't happened through the church ages the breach has always been there and I tell you what I'll go into it very soon there's a bridge there's a Chasm there's a there's a divider there's a thing in in lives that keep us natural to affect us by the Flesh and affect us by lust and affect us by fear and and all these different tormenting devils and things through the heritages and through the generations that have plagued us but there has to come a day where those things are canceled there has to come a time when those things are eradicated so that you don't have to put up with them anymore and so that you can walk with God like Enoch and one day you will walk home Hallelujah I'm really excited about this Hallelujah because I believe that we're in an age and I just if this is the burden that that you'll just have a greater understanding and experience of what Jesus is wanting to do in this hour it's not just we go to church and we just learn all the stuff and and it's better than any age because he's revealing moral there it's more than that there's a transformation taking place there's a metamorphosis taking place and it's happening in your p in US amen hallelujah and uh I'm just gonna I'm not gonna get too far ahead because I just want to be very controlled here Genesis 3 1 to 4 well actually just actually Genesis 3 1. now the serpent was more subtle than any beast of the field which the Lord God had made and he said unto the woman yay has God said You shall not eat of every tree of the garden so you can see now from the Garden of Eden lust was introduced and I'm not going to go into the details for now now there's a scripture in Psalm 119 verse 133 and it says here Order My Steps in thy word and let not any everyone say any let not any iniquity have dominion over me amen and I'm sure that we've had we always go through this you see this guy here that's us and there's a there's a devil that's trying to give you bad influences trying to tell you to do things and there's there's your good old your new nature right there's a white dog and a black dog inside every one of us and is trying to get Dominion but the word and the Lord has bringing us to a place where we can have dominion over the enemy and have dominion over our old nature amen Hallelujah so Romans 6 12 says let not sin therefore rain in your mortal body that's now that you should obey it in the lusts thereof so there's this lust that is inside the human being that is coming through all sorts of generational issues and curses and troubles and influences and everything that's going on in this world and in the world that was in your forefathers right okay so it's there and pride in the family and all these other things but we're just going to use lust is going to be the subject matter today because I can tell you now there is lots of lust hiding in the church hiding in people hiding you can sit there and be an angel thing yeah it doesn't affect me but I can guarantee you that the devil will tempt you on lust and it will affect you and something and I'm not just talking about lust when a man sees a female and you know and has a lust no I'm talking about covetousness I'm talking about wanting things and just constantly Desiring things I'm talking about being discontented and always looking for something else the only something else that you need to look forward to is something more from Jesus amen Hallelujah so I'm just asking you tonight to draw a line in the sand tonight put a Line in the Sand between you and lust you and pride you and fear okay just put a Line in the Sand because tonight as well I'll tell you what and I know that we've all got testimonies and the Lord's dealt with us in many ways see in my own experience I was definitely um raised in a way that I was exposed to all sorts of different things very lustful things as a child and you know just sore stuff and material and all that sort of stuff that I shouldn't have seen and no humans should see and as a result in My Flesh and by my natural birth because my father also struggled with these things and as most men do right because it's the world we live in and so they struggle with with lust and so then I was raised under this umbrella and also was exposed to a neighborhood of all these types of things and so as a result it became a very hard issue in my life okay now I'm gonna get into some things to alleviate these things and to eradicate the lust and and this body so that you can walk in Victory but if you don't and you begin to walk in the flesh you're gonna have struggles you are going to have struggles with lust you're going to have struggles with the old nature and all those things when you walk in the flesh because to Walk In the Flesh and to be carnally minded is enmity against God you're basically saying God you go over there and I'm gonna do this that's what's happening you're pushing God out there oh where are you you're in no man's land and then the devil's just going to come in and he's going to tease you and he's going to torment you and he's going to tempt you and try and bring you and pull you away from God and the natural and the carnal nature so anyway in my own life you know that happens to me you know and it happened it gets better and better as we get older and get more mature in the Lord you know the Lord gives us tools and he gives us Revelation and we get built up in the Most Holy Faith you know it says that we should add virtue to our character and all those things and it says to make your calling an election sure and if you do these things diligently that you shall never fall and the word says that right so if the word says it I believe it that settles it and then it's come with an open book in our generation to give it all back so that there's nothing withheld from you there's nothing withheld from me right nothing is withheld God withholders no good thing from his children from those that believe right amen we can establish that easily so in my own life we when I first got together with Isaac and started the business you know and we were just busy busy and us being very entrepreneurial and energetic we started to really Branch out too much too busy got carnal started struggling with lust again but held it all didn't say anything and then all of a sudden you know I didn't go into anything but I just struggled with it right and it was becoming harder and harder and harder and I was being affected by it it was it was bubbling in my body because if I never felt that bubbling a man sees a undressed female or something like that on the streets and something starts bubbling what is that it's your old maker lustful nature and if you're carnal you will not be able to not look a second time you'll be looking and then you'll look again and you'll look again and you'll struggle why because the barriers are down and the Lord's far off somewhere else and you've been too busy and this is what was happening in my life and my family started falling apart now this was all kind of nuancedly falling apart and I wasn't gone but there was children were very naughty and you know children could be naughty even when you're in a good place so don't think that just if children are naughty you're in a bad place because they just killed him right but they were there was just a real disjointedness and a and a real kind of uh a breach I'm gonna call it a breach because that's what we're talking about so anyway so there's this breach in Bromance that's to have these kind of lustful dreams too and she was telling me about and I'm thinking man I'm struggling with lust she's having lustful dreams she never has those sort of dreams right but it's like something is happening in the subconscious and and I and and so now I'm out of my position and I'm struggling with these things and getting carnal and all this sort of stuff and I I came in and laid on my bed one night and I've probably told the spirit testimony some of you have heard it already so I laid out on my bed and I usually now at this stage of my life I was so Under Pressure I had to learn how to do cooking shows so instead of reading my Bible when I got down and laid on the bed which is what you should do you know at least fellowship with the Lord is what you know it's a very good thing so anyway instead of fellowship with the Lord I begin to fellowship with Jamie Oliver you know so I'm watching Jamie Oliver and I go to put this thing on and I'm about to watch and then Rock Roman rolls over in the middle of the night it's like three o'clock in the morning because I was working like 18 hours a day and she rolls over and she says God has been gracious to you and I was like whoa mate that was real like boom anyway and then I felt like this being just came and sat down on my bed and I was like whoa so I was like okay I was like you know I felt like I was at this Crossroads now because now thoughts are starting to come and spiritual thinking starts to open up so I'm at this Crossroads now and I I I knew that I had to make a decision now and this decision I had to make was do I carry on like this and just withhold all the the heart because my husband and wife should communicate you guys should know what each other's going through you should not be ashamed to tell your wife everything hey or husbands wives you should not be ashamed to tell your husband everything it should be an open relationship totally open you can share the burden together with we're humans right we struggle with things we go through stuff we should share it I wasn't and I think it's probably pride and many of us probably don't right we just get too proud we don't want to see come across as weak or we just don't want to upset our I don't know what it may be but there's lots of reasons right human beings and our thoughts and mind can be very complicated but I'm like now oh Lord you know and I I just opened my Bible I thought I better read the Bible you know I've been a dust this thing off so I got the Bible out and it was this actually and but let's just say it was the paper Bible and I opened it and something said psalm 39. so I read Psalm 39 and it just spoke to my life it undid everything that I was going through and I thought man I'm done and then I thought I'm just going to read some Hebrew text here to see if it really is speaking those things because it was getting revealed to me you know there was someone sitting in the room Hallelujah who was sitting in the room it was him hallelujah hallelujah aren't you so glad that he would come to you and you're so glad that he won't leave you like that that he would come into your room he came into my room Hallelujah and he began to tell me things that I needed to know to break me out of a cycle of carnality and I believe that God can come to you tonight and break you out of a cycle of carnality or a cycle of lust or a cycle of fear or a cycle of of covetousness or a cycle of Pride you know there's lots of Cycles we can get ourselves into the only one we really want to get into is that great Eternal one that great Eternal one that never began and will never end if the cycle you're in began then you should get out of it right now Hallelujah Oh Glory so I'm like sitting on my bed and I read something and I know get into the Hebrew now to see if it really means what he's revealing to my heart and it was and it got worse and it got worse and then the flesh was burning because now I have to tell Brahman everything oh boy now mate now we've had to tell hard things to our wives or we've had to ask hard questions to people right and so this maybe is not the hugest thing but still it was hard because now as a man you've got to fess up you've got to be real you gotta say it and so I faced up or I went out there and or the next day and want to wake her up at three o'clock in the morning and just pour it all out you know so next day at night I wait till we had to finish the day and then I came and I thought and I just prayed and I said Lord help me and I just said to everything and me and bromham we prayed and went through and she was like Wow and that so but from that day everything changed and I was restored back to that Eternal cycle and and and and our children came back into Harmony and Brahman stop having those dreams and you know the Lord could bless the home amen I'm running out of power up here will I have a pointer or something or is there another pad or amen so I'll move on from the testimony Hallelujah now I want you to make this personal this is Paul speaking this over a church but you can also individualize this and I want you to individualize this because lust is like yeast it's like 11. yeah and it can affect you you know if it's a warm day and you live in the bread man that thing can grow big the right atmosphere and so you can get a lust Spirit or you can get an effect by something lust or you can be watching um you know anything you could just be searching for I'm always searching for things for work and that but these thinking Google ads come up and they've got the as probably because I've got a wife and so the advertising woman's underwear and all sort of stuff and it's like ah stupid things and I just clicked at X you know but it's enough to get into your mind and it affects you and I can feel it like a just a just like a 11. and I'm like Lord help me cast that thing out of here you know it's but it's just a devil and he's just coming and what people would think is innocent they're not even trying to do anything wrong to you they're just trying to help you right help you AI ai's trying to help you to make convenient shopping for you all those things right so anyway let's read this I'm going to be I have to just go a bit faster I've got a few slides to get through tonight so it is reported commonly that there is fornication among you such fornication as is not so much as named among the Gentiles that one should have his father's wife so this was a serious offense that was going on in the church but remember that if you internalize this there can be serious offenses going on in your spirit there can be serious offenses going on in your house in this house that no one may know about it but God knows God knows and he says here to the church and you are puffed up what are you are you leavened you're this this thing is just blowing through so that spirit that was on those people to cause them to do that begin to affect the body and last Spirits would have been rampant around the church and this one would have started struggling with books this one would have started struggling with looking at that one and that sister and brother all those things right because it's starting to spread through but what about inside you come on because this is what we're talking about tonight that's a personal thing Hallelujah we got it on there have we brother beautiful I'm glad I got my glasses I'm going to skip down to verse six he says your glowing is not good no you're not that a little Levin Levin's the whole lump I learned this when I started making bread and I didn't realize what he was talking about until I started making bread you you think oh you know you can do um 20 Gobles and use 10 grams of yeast you can use a hundred doubles and use 10 grams of yeast because the yeast goes into the flour and becomes yeast everything's yeast it changes the theory makeup of that bread that's what Levin does that's what lust does when you start looking at those things and then you get down and you get condemned and you're like oh man what do I do I might as well just go ahead and do more right no no don't don't do that you just come out of it straight away the moment you repent the moment you you come out of that thing the moment that you make it right with God and whoever's involved the leaven is killed by the fire of God there's three things that kills leaven needing the living giving it a good beating Hallelujah God knows how to do that amen amen so just be careful and so there's another thing salt did you know that salt kills leaven so we just need to be seasoned with salt always with Grace so where are you going you're salty if someone's struggling with living they just become unleavened because the presence of God starts to unleaven you you know so it's very important that you actually God begins to use you to unleaven people you know just the atmosphere and you you just go for dinner or you go for Fellowship you bring your family and then all of a sudden they feel like this nice presence what are you doing you're being salty what's happening the level is getting dispersed the other thing is fire you cook that bread it kills all the leaven amen you cook it so you need fire and that sometimes what exactly what we need amen is fire to kill the leaven that goes on in the spirit Hallelujah does this I'm gonna do this no that's not going to work does that work oh it's off I'll just use this Galatians 5 17 says for the flesh lusteth against the spirit and the spirit against the flesh and these are contrary the one to the other that you cannot do the things that you would there's a battle going on Saints there's a pivotal Warfare going on inside your life as we know I know I'm preaching to the choir but I just want I'm just building a platform Galatians 5 18 but if you I love this God always gives Solutions he always has a way for you to be in Victory there is no excuse that you were just born all this way because if I as Paul could boast on how religious he was I can boast on how evil I was but I'm not going to do that because I shouldn't boast in those things right just like Paul shouldn't boast in those things but if God can deliver me and make me pure and holy he can do it to anybody amen amen buddy Hallelujah but if you've been LED off the spirit Glory this is not a hard thing right all you need to do is just worship all you need to do children is worship God praise God you know just give him praise give him glory he might speak to you I tell my children all the time just Praise Him let's give them worship not just when we're having our family altars and but in your room yeah you just open up and praise God young and old don't just be religious now worship God because he might just come down in your room and start telling you things and start speaking to you and start leading you we must be lit of the spirit then you are not under that law that is condemning you because you live above that because the spirit of God gives you power to multiply the Deeds of the flesh mortify means to kill I'm just going through Paul's conundrum here and your conundrum my conundrum right for I Delight in the law of God after the inward man I love righteousness I love doing right but I see another law in my body this old nature warring against the law of my mind and my inward man that wants to do right and bringing me into captivity to the law of sin that says you shouldn't do that and you shouldn't do that and if you do this you're condemned this is on a natural level now right then you get in a bad place and this is a struggle that Paul is speaking about he says captivity to the law of sin which is in my body and then he just declares this a Wretched Man that I am Hallelujah and I want to ask you who who is it that can deliver you that's Jesus Hallelujah Hallelujah who came to my room that night who came down on and sat on my bed who was that that came to your room who was that that came and delivered you in that service who was that that came to you at camp and changed your life who was that that came and spoke to you and changed you and changed your family and brought light that was him he shall deliver me from the body of this death thank God through Jesus Christ Our Lord amen no excuse Hallelujah when I was first saved and I'd run away from the law for about nine months and then the Lord call me back and I remember going into my room this I still get involved with stuff and still you know having the odd drink and smoking weed and all that sort of stuff so but I was reasoning you know like oh slowly do that because and then and I hadn't really and and I I just hadn't really fully surrendered but I was wanting to you know and so I I came into my room and I picked the Bible out of my bedside table and it was Dusty and I blew the dust off and I opened it straight up to Second Corinthians 5 17 and it said and God spoke to me that day and said touch not the unclean things that I will receive you and he made that promise personal to me that if I let go of those things and surrender those things that he would receive me and the Very notion the very idea that God would speak to me and he would promise me such a great thing those things fell away I surrendered my life I gave everything over and I said Lord take the world out of my life take all of the desire for the world out of my life I surrender all I want to serve you with all my heart and the Holy Spirit came down and changed everything Hallelujah that's how God can work it that's how he can do it Hallelujah amen Romans 8 13 shows us how to beat the adversary within that old nature for if you live after the flesh you shall die but if ye through the spirit do amen I like that's a doing word everyone say Doom mortify the Deeds of the body you shall live amen this is being led of the spirit this is walking in the spirit with the Lord this is her surrendering your life to God and doing his will finding out God's plan for your life and beginning to be led by him and beginning to fellowship with him what is he doing he's beginning to multiply the Deeds of this body amen and I believe that the Lord is going to continue to mortify the Deeds of this body right up until we come to the very end in the Redemption of our body amen but I believe and tonight I believe that the Lord is going to show us a very great thing about what he's going to do Hallelujah and the season that we're in to purify us and to deal with our enemy once and for all Hallelujah this is a picture that I kind of made up but this is what he's actually doing in our heart because every human being is born in their natural birth with a Babylonian image you are born with a Babylonian nature you have come from a Babylonian Heritage because this is just the natural man the natural man has got to curse all over him it's all cursed through the generations and all the sin and the evil that goes on and so there's an image in the heart but what happens in the end time what Jesus Christ has spoken to do in this last day is to come and smite that image and he will Smite that image not only on the age don't worry about what's happening out there but what is he doing in you what is being smitten inside you what is changing in you what is he doing he's putting a rock inside you a revelation of who he is to break the influence so that that influence comes down to the ten toes tell those ten toes right there at the bottom of that image the foundation of the devil's to hold over your life the strongholds that hold you down and make you act the way you don't want to act like Paul said Paul was like oh this Richard man all these things that I do and I shouldn't do and I can't help it but it just happens that there is something that happens in the end time this is something that happens right at the end to break the church free but it happens in the heart of the Bride I'm going to put this thing down I keep pressing that button this is actually that image and it's inside your heart this is what happens within you can you see that lust defined as a sinful longing it's a Desiring that which is forbidden and this is actually how um the serpent got Eve was through concupiscence strong powerful desire for things you deeply crave or are addicted to an obsessive desire an erratic possessive desire a selfish inconsiderate desire for Central pleasure a desire about relational commitment or intention lust is an insatiable never quenching self-centered satanic destructive path into complete darkness and separation from God's presence what are you entertaining what are you allowing into your mind when you lust if you could only see that demon you would scream cry and run but God is so merciful he doesn't show you but when you entertain that and it feels good in the flesh it's a different story but when you realize the evil and it's the very thing that was used against the woman to bring the fall of Man and so this is a force that's been in the human race from the beginning of the Fall and it's been manifesting and leavening and leavening and leavening and leavening and here we are in the darkest age covered in our whole inheritance in everything that we're born under Naturally Speaking is plaguing you and plaguing me everything this is the epitome this is the crescendo of the devil and the crescendo of God I'm going to go through a few things just we'll get there trust me we'll get there trust home actually emotional unfulfillment is a very key thing because now I'm just going to cover off a few things of how in your natural interactions and relationships and Communications and all those things to help you but also to give you an awareness of how you can become weak and different things that God has given you naturally speaking spiritually as well of tools and also practice and practical things to have in your life and to do so every even you young children I want you to pay good attention to this especially the teenagers pay good attention to this Genesis 2 18 says and the Lord God said it is not good that the man should be alone amen do you believe that it is not good and I've got a few pictures here are we connecting on our family level are our children actually connecting with us is our family home connected are our children getting the connection they need are they getting the Friendship they need from us children are you getting that connection that you need from your parents I asked that question because this is a very common thing that happens and I'm not just and that can doesn't necessarily mean that they're having a big debate or an argument in the background but I'm just just in general we can be so busy we can have so much going on in our home and so many things and responsibilities what is our children doing are we giving them the grace of a connection are they growing up with friends from their parents are they growing up connected on the level of family which is given to them you children are given parents to connect with if you don't connect with your parents then you'll look for other things to connect to and that will bring lust into your life it will because you'll go out in the world for connection or somewhere else and you will end up lusting after a connection you'll end up pursuing a connection because let me take this and I want you to listen really carefully the moment you're not connected you begin to pursue you begin a pursuit of connection and it's a there is a natural pursuit in marriage where a man pursues a woman and that's a Godly thing but it can come out of place when you're not fulfilled like this are we connecting or is this your bedroom at night when you hop in bed as their two phones out on the screens and you're all smiling and happy with your friends but not even talking there's no connection or there's little connection but I'm talking about a friendship is there a friendship in your marriage is there a fulfillment in your relationship and I'm not just talking physical things I'm talking friendship and social and fellowship is there a connection because if you're not connected to your spouse then you're going to start pursuing and lust the devil will know that you're not connected and he will send lust Spirits he will send people with anointings on them to try and woo you that way because and if you're not fulfilled emotionally in your marriage or in your parenting or in your family in your home if there is a if there is if you're more connected out there to a false relationship to all these other people and things and you just want to get the likes or the the attention on Instagram with your great pictures or the attention on Tick Tock with your little cool videos or you watching all this other stuff but really God gave you a spouse and if you're connected to that spouse you will be fulfilled emotionally we must be connected check your relationship the good thing is children parents married couples single or old the good thing is if there is a problem be real if there's a problem go and talk about it if you're not feeling the real connection pray together sit down together there's Grace for those of you that don't have husbands or don't have wives and you and you can't God has a special Grace for you so don't feel left out because the Lord is not a robot he knows our situation he knows what we intend he knows what we mean he knows what we need this one here's a big one are you connecting to your church family we're in this Fellowship is that you sitting there in the corner on the left is that left is that you can't really connect feel like you're rejected feel left out you just but or can you naturally just get involved are you being fulfilled in the friendship you see many people have had to leave family leave father mother and and go to to serve the Lord and they've had to leave all that behind to become a Christian and God promised he'll give you mothers fathers brothers sisters so that you can have that relationship fulfilled so that as you're single and maybe you're not married and you're seeking or you you are looking for that Fellowship then you can actually still be connected to your church family your church family is here for friendship our church is here for Fellowship for camaraderie we're together we're in this together we're fighting together we're in the war together right hallelujah we're here for each other let us be honest let us be sincere and true let us utilize the family and friendship that we have amen Hallelujah don't you get caught on me Hallelujah and the Lord God said it's not good that man should be alone so just check your relationships check your friendships check your marriage just check that you are being connected check that your relationship and your need for connection is being fulfilled if you're in a family and and you're feeling estranged then it's just prayer that's needed it's just the devil the devil wants to put fear on you he wants to a stranger he wants to make you feel like that no one understands you they understand you it's just a little imagination and I remember being preaching on it ages ago about how an imagination can become a reality your reality it's a false reality but it's so real that you can experience the emotions and even believe the imagination as if it's true and it's not true so be careful what you imagine Hallelujah but if you are connected to the Lord if you're connected to your family if you're connected to your spouse and your children are connected to your parents and if they're not and you prayed and you make it right you're not alone amen we have needs and I'm I I just say these things as a foundation because when you don't connect and when you aren't connected that's when that Pursuit kicks in and you begin to seek and you begin to get Temptation and then you struggle and then you might watch the wrong thing or you might see the wrong thing and you might hear the wrong thing and all of a sudden the leaven begins to bubble inside you and you can walk you can find yourself in the world just like that or find yourself falling from Grace but God has made a profession for you to be connected husbands when you get married Don't Stop The Pursuit to your wife you pursued her you loved her you were on cloud nine don't stop pursuing don't stop being that one that wants to please her and keep seeking and to keep doing nice things to just make you feel happy it doesn't stop when you get married and have children you should always pursue there should always be a harder pursuit in your wife for your wife to please her to woo her to win her to keep her one to please her because if you don't you will that something inside you will begin to look it'll begin to pursue again and you'll struggle with lust you'll struggle with looking around and when you see someone that looks nice or to the eye the lust of the eye will kick in and you'll struggle because there's a Pursuit inside you that needs to be quenched in your wife so when I when we before we got married the Lord spoke this and he gave Brahman nanaya scripture but it's not actually a scripture in the Bible but it's our own scripture Hallelujah I'm sure that any some of you have probably got your own little scriptures that the Lord has spoken to you right even our church we've got church Shekinah Tabernacle scriptures amen if you remain humble I will draw my people into my rest is that a Shekinah Tabernacle scripture I would take that as the word of God that's the word of God to us right so he spoke that over us and said if you keep me Central you will always be connected and I want to just tell you that when God is Central in your life your connections are prime you've got premium connections Hallelujah sorry this text is small but 1 John 2 15 to 16 says love not the world neither the things that are in the world if any man love the world the love of the father is not in him for all that is in the world the lust of the Flesh and the lust of the eyes and the pride of life is not of the father but of the world do you know it's very important true contentment because we are we wire ourselves and our mind gets wired into a certain format that if we're constantly thinking about what we can have and how nice it would be to have that car how nice it would be to have that house how nice it would be what you're doing is you're wiring your brain for discontentment and you are beginning to Crave things and long for things and you begin to actually not be able to enjoy what's going on in your life in the present moment so I wrote this when we are truly contented in our lives we can begin to enjoy the I am he's the present God but if you're always looking forward to what he's going to do then you're missing what he's doing right we can properly connect with our family and Brethren when we are enjoying them now and I know sometimes you children at the end at like 11 30 a.m 12 p.m on the Sunday morning you're hungry and you're looking forward to lunch amen I know and sometimes I get hungry too and but yet you have to just let that thing go down and say Lord I'm still here Lord I just want to hear from you because I can receive something from you tonight I can receive something from you Hallelujah so to contentment is meaning that you can rejoice in the present moment that you are not constantly pining after what you could have or or looking back and seeing the the things of the past because if you constantly look at the past you will be depressed if it's bad or you'll just be resenting things that are happening now because you think it was so much better back then don't do that stop looking out of the present and start enjoying the moment you're in stop looking forward to going to sleep tonight and get in the spirit right now Hallelujah this is serious stuff serious stuff that if we continue to look into the future and look into the path you'll be affected by those things but it might not be helpful to you but God is speaking to you and he's got something for you and he wants you to walk in the moment I know it's hard sometimes we always and there's nothing wrong now get me here there's nothing wrong with looking forward to something I'm looking forward to Camp I'm really looking forward to Camp I'm looking forward to things but I'm not going to live in the future Hallelujah when we go to heaven we're going to only ever be in the now amen so you must just get used to the now Hallelujah I'm speaking all these things from lots of experience now um because of the way I was wired and the Lord had to do a lot of Deliverance healing in me to a for me to be able to be content to be able to be happy now the Lord is wanting to filter our life and God has a filter that's his word it's a separator for it's the Waters of separation for sin now that's the thinking man or the holy man's taste when a thinking man comes through God's filter it gives him a holy man's taste I tell you the Lord is going to just show us some good things now that's right when you come through God's filter then your taste as a holy man's taste it makes a righteous man's taste this is the filter of God's word right so when you come through God's filter there's a power in that word to change your taste it's going to get better you're you young woman you old woman before you go out on the street with your clothes so tight pushed out in the back and front I'm not critical I'm your brother I stand between the living and the dead and realize what I'm saying before you interrupt and know that your body is a sacred order a sacred cast that God has given you before you into the street dressed like that pass your mind through a thinking woman's filter and let it remember that whosoever looks upon you to lust after you you have committed adultery with him already remember that sister and brother before you turn your head to look at her on the Second Glance oh God help us pass your mind through a thinking man's filter you'll come out I want you to say this oh come out with a holy man's taste amen of doing what's right this here when the Lord revealed this to me about seven years ago because I used to struggle when he revealed that to me it gave me hope that if if I can put myself through this thinking man's filter this I'll I'll there will be a change in me that my taste would change and I would stop struggling with these things I would put off the old man and put on Jesus Christ and they would be grace for me and in the times of struggle there would be grace for me to keep walking with God in the times of failure there was Grace for me to come through and I didn't have to live in condemnation and neither do I yet have to live in under a condemnation of failure but I see failure as an opportunity for war not an opportunity to just get down and depressed and then get back up and start again but failure is an opportunity for war it's an opportunity to overcome it's actually the grace of God exposing the devil in your life exposing a nature that he wants to heal you from exposing a breach in your Hull that will make you sink if it's not dealt with and you may be able to hide that from the people but you can't hide it from God and it will eventually bring you down and I preached on that with the Titanic I've actually got a slide from there and there later on so we'll get there respond oh this is an old one oh dear have you got the newest one Ed this is actually not the right slideshow I need the um newer one you must have downloaded it straight away eh positively correct see if you can download the next one I'll just preach on this for now but if you could change that over but you should be able to just download the nut from the same link see responsibility there is responsibility for our actions right we we make a choice now I divided this into three parts there's a demonic enticement within your old nature it's not you it's sin that dwelleth in you and it's something that you don't want right you're not responsible for that it's not you it's an old nature it's a it's a luciferian nature that is trying to pull you down that's against you that's against God that's why the Bible says it's enmity against God it's your old nature and from your old nature it begins to war against you and and what it does is it's it's magnetic towards sinful things you know so you can go down the street and you'll see something that's not right and you'll be and there's a magnetism and it's because of that old nature now there's the second one is a demonic atmosphere on the subject so there are a woman out there and men out there that have a legion of lust spirits on them Legions of lust on them and they're out there womanizing manizing whatever I think and when you see that you react and you think oh my goodness I'm so sinful right and you're not Discerning the spirit because that's a spirit on that person and then you feel condemned because you feel a certain way when you see that but it's actually a spirit that's not you don't be condemned by that the only thing that will condemn you is your reaction decision and entertainment of the Demonic influence that's what will condemn you that's what will separate you from God that's what will put lust in your life now it's not a sinful to get it's not actually a sin and you're not condemned for getting into a condition just by looking at something and being affected by it but what's sin is when you remain that way when there is a abundance of Grace to change you where there is Grace to set you free where you don't have to remain in sin you don't have to remain in a living condition where you're all puffed up you don't have to remain like that when you saw something you shouldn't have seen and maybe you were on something you shouldn't have been on or you're in a place where you shouldn't have been but then when you're affected by those things and you make it right with the Lord there's Grace to separate us from those things to change us so that we can come back and be in the Commonwealth of God where we can be connected to God where the Holy Spirit begins to lead us again now one thing I really felt when that slide came up was to make sure that we deal with this one thing and that is when you make a mistake don't stay in that mistake don't Pine in your own failure and you know the devil will tell you when you go into a failure or when you see something and you do something oh you might as well just do it all you might as well just let it all out you might as well just go for gold that's what he'll say right ah you just failed now you must have just have a party while you failed right and whatever medium and whatever it is but don't don't let the leaven fester in you don't let it Fester use that as an advantage for you to get serious with God in that moment where you you've failed and you might be on your knees you might be on the ground and there might be all sorts of troubles happening and you might be just that's the moment where you can stand up and put the Line in the Sand and your enemy that's you've struggled with is at the surface he's not hiding down deep in your heart now he's at the surface and he's ready to be dealt with he's asking for it do you know the devil asks for it he's so proud so arrogant and so hateful he can't help it he just opens himself up he shows us cards and every card he has cannot help hurt you at all it's a bluff a complete Bluff everything you go through Hallelujah I'm going back to the conventional is it all right back there brother Ed oh here we are thank you brother starting it's going to get positive I can be promising you can hear a pin drop in here it's like when people read my testimony and I meet them and they've only read half and I think man what do you think of me I'm mate oh boy Galatians 5 1. just remember this you will be targeted for a re-entanglement you know God sets us free man I remember when I first got saved I was safe so good oh nothing could affect me and I was on cloud nine me and the Lord we were just having a jubilee you know I thought man I'm never going to struggle with anything ever again ah my goodness oh I don't know if any of you felt like that I mean I was just so high all the time and I I've actually I've seen being a quote the other day that brother Brandon said I've been I've been drunk every day for 23 years I thought mate If he if I I just take it start drinking the Holy Ghost the wine of Revelation you could be drunk every day and be rejoicing anyway I thought I was like that you know and then all of a sudden you know start things just start to change and you start to get go through life and but you see the Lord allowed us to be in that condition there's nothing wrong with that but he's he knows what's inside you still he knows the joys the victories The Valleys the mountains he's got a whole plan and in that plan as victory over victory over Victory so as he said to Israel I'm going to leave some inhabitants in the land for you to conquer because you need to mature you need to grow you need to learn you need to go through some stuff meditable is just all easy and there was no failure oh my but listen here stand fast or in the Liberty wherewith Christ has made us free and be not entangled again with the yoga bondage Hallelujah this is the devil's zentangling strategy and there's probably more but dreams I'm just trying to just expose some stuff here the devil's sowing the seed until you know in your mind you might have a dream and it might be about someone that is in the church I'm just going to put it out there and it might be a bad dream or a dirty dream or whatever it may be what the devil is trying to do is one he saw that you didn't pray before you went to sleep and asked the law for protection so he managed to weasel his way through into your subconscious somehow somehow that slimy snake got into your house but however he did sometimes when you've got people staying he comes in that way whatever somehow he gets in sometimes and you have these dreams right and what he's doing is he's putting a seed in your subconscious and what is he trying to do he's trying to put some leaven in your spirit he might not be able to get you to do it in the flesh so he'll do it in your dreams if you're not covered like that in your sleep or whatever sometimes I I just I'm just speaking from experience until a full spiritual takeover has manifested in your spirit then in your flesh and you can wake up in the morning and you've dreamed about somebody and it's caused a lust in your flesh for that person and then when you get affected by that you need to repent of those things you need to make that thing right don't just think because you dreamed it that you're you're off scot-free no that still happened in your spirit Realm that's still something that needs to be dealt with and delivered and you need to deal with that enemy that did that to you and then you need to repent of that thing and I know that sounds crazy right some of you are probably thinking man Andy's just like way up there somewhere like over the top but anyway I'm telling you things so that you can actually not have a lust in your flesh and in your spirit realm so just because it's a dream it doesn't mean you can get away with doing lustful things I'm telling you now that if your dream becomes Lucid who knows what a lucid dream is a lucid dream is where you know you're dreaming and then you do something dirty in that dream now if you do that that means there's a dirty Spirit In You because you're still dirty your subconscious is still filthy and God wants to clean you he wants to sanctify you not just out here and what people see but he wants to heal that bridge that's under the water of your ship where no one can see he doesn't want you to fist he doesn't want to have a festering lust inside your life that just keeps you natural and you wonder why all you've done is warm a pew and he's living in a lustful state but God wants to take you and do things that you couldn't even dream of but first he's got to give you some tools give you some tips give you some Direction so that you can fight this enemy with an understanding that's why Gabriel had to come to Daniel to give him wisdom and understanding of the visions that he saw right Hallelujah God comes to you to give you wisdom to give you understanding that's why in the Proverbs it talks all about these things thoroughly who reads the proverbs it's very good for you it's not Old Testament it's Old Testament man that's good we always you know think our Old Testament now we just got then you'd know there's so much in there so much I think I've dealt with that enough you guys can contemplate and and meditate on those things visuals Google ads movies marketing psychology it's all designed to give you lust I'm telling you and I'm a marketer and I understand it's all designed to create a covetousness in you it's designed that way to trigger the lust even and now children's cartoons are does they trigger the lust channel in children so that they love the cartoon and want to watch more Disney common knowledge they even admit it and now they're even putting homosexual lust in there so that people will children will be more accepting in their schools of homosexuals and all sorts of identifications so it's all in there and it's triggering through lust so lust is actually bringing the battle of Armageddon lust is actually bringing the whole world to the battle of Armageddon through evil sensual unfulfilled desire that can never be quenched and it can never be satisfied it's insatiable it's like a fire and that fire the only way to stop it from spreading is to put it out with water and thoughts the fiery does atmosphere's imaginations and memories and you know these things here is the entanglement strategy of the enemy I'm sorry I don't have time to go right into every little detail but you guys study these things out and I would if I was I'd be praying Lord reveal these things to me yeah show me what these things are I want to have wisdom and understanding in this battle this I say then this is the pivotal battle for every believer Galatians 5 16 says this I say then walk in the spirit Hallelujah and you shall not fulfill the lust of the flesh this is the Holy Grail of my whole sermon right here is that am I is that wrong to say that I don't even know that there is the very and that's the pivotal point this is what actually inspired me for this whole thought was this because this showed me that there is a very simple solution to the problem of lust In the Flesh to to Paul's problem of Romans 7 and then his solution comes through Romans 8 and so the full manifestation of the sons of God and here it is he says walk in the spirit amen and you shall not fulfill the lust of the flesh so there's lust of the flesh right if you walk in the spirit you shall not fulfill the lust of the flesh that's all so what does that mean to walk in the spirit Glory help me Jesus help me father oh God To Tread all around to walk at Large you know what that means that means to be a future of let me just step out that means to take a daring step to walk with God and to be walking as a companion it means to be a companion to deport oneself what is that that means to go beyond the camp Deport yourself from your own lustful ways to point yourself separate yourself from Sinners separate yourself from sin hallelujah hallelujah Deport yourself from the way that you thought and the way your parents were so that you can walk in the way that Jesus is and follow as a companion to make one's way to progress to make due use of opportunities and tonight is an opportunity for you tonight is an opportunity for you to be changed tonight is an opportunity for you to deal with lust tonight is an opportunity and I believe the Lord is giving this opportunity not just by a bad preaching and whatever I do me you know it's just me but God I believe he inspired this thought he gave this thought and it's up to you what you do with it it's up to you if you leave the same it's up to you if you continue on struggling with lust struggling with pride struggling with fear struggling with the flesh but there's a way for you to deport yourself out of it so that you can walk in the spirit that you can tread all around in the spirit so that you can walk at large as a fugitive from sin in the spirit so that you can sing in the spirit so that you can make music in the spirit so that you can rejoice in the spirit so that you can be delivered in the spirit so that you can be a dead in the spirit you can be a mum in the spirit you can be a pastor in the spirit you can be a preacher in the spirit amen hallelujah hallelujah you can walk at lunch and that means to prove ability in the spirit not in your flesh your flesh ain't gonna prove nothing but if you can walk at large to God prove himself in you to make due use of the opportunity Hallelujah Jacob made use of the opportunity you know he got desperate one day and he needed change and Jacob was left alone and there Wrestled a man with him until the breaking of the day and sometimes that's what you need to do is that you need to get desperate you need to get a hold of something real amen don't just sit like a Wallflower but get something real in your life get some fire in your bones Hallelujah don't be afraid of the devil don't be afraid the devil can't hurt you you just give God all the glory and praise who cares what people say who cares what people think it doesn't matter what people think it doesn't matter what criticisms come walk unconscious of criticism walk in the spirit Hallelujah Jacob was so desperate he was coming up against the head his whole life was coming to her head he had to be changed and this is what happens in our life this is bringing us to a place where we must be changed and there is a bridge that he is healing and I'm going to be quick here I had to work hard to get this so that it was easy to express in the short time that we have the prophet says this for the people get the true revelation of the true church and what she is and what she stands for that she can do the Greater Works and she will be an invincible Army so here is the people that the breach has healed here's a people that the devil cannot affect anymore this is a prophet that stood in this generation with an open book and said that there will come a people that the devil cannot touch hey man and I've constantly in my life gone bring the church to this and about two weeks ago the Lord said don't you try and bring the church to this you come to this you need to ask for it personally and so I've been screaming crying out to the Lord you can ask Bob not the breach of my life heal the stroke of my wounds oh Lord I want to be an invincible Army in my own life because I was so busy trying to pray for the whole people but as an individual walk it's not something you can just blanket over the people but if you cry out to God for what he's prophesied and promised you I'm not speaking Pie in the Sky here I'm speaking direct promises for you for this end time to get a true revelation of the two Spirits within the framework of the church Christian church and by God's spirit discern and withstand the Antichrist Spirit Satan will be powerless powerless before her Satan will be powerless before me that no influence of my old nature no variable of the flesh no more lust no more fear no more rejection no more of these horrible old nature things would even affect me in any way because Invincible means totally free of effect and anyway an invincible Army through the power of the spirit and discernment but then here listen to this I said remember Satan's got a Punch coming at you this is the spot this breach that you've got to cover right now don't care who you are God he's got a right uh who you are he's got a right for that one punch which had you rather be that punch be blind or be arthritical sitting in a chair or be nervous see he's got somewhere he can punch you he's got a right to that open place now that's the spot you've got to keep covered all the time so there is breaches in the hull right that you're born with and things that are affecting you and something that you struggle with and the devil knows it and he begins to torment you with it right but I believe there's coming a time where you'll be invincible Hallelujah I believe that we're in the hour where you can begin to pray for these things where you can hold God at his word like Jacob did and don't let him go until He blesses you don't let him go until you receive that complete binding of the bridge in your life so that you won't sink when it comes to Temptation day Hallelujah the prophet says your weakest link in your chain is the strongest place he's talking about your flesh right that's why I put that picture there because it's us it's our flesh trying to hold it together that tells the chain no matter how strong other things are that week one point there's where you want to keep covered sometimes that's what your chain feels like right and you just oh boy too busy whatever cardinal state you got in and the slightest little thing and you've fizzled over and you've got mad and you've had a big rage oh boy but there was but there has been promised that that won't affect you anymore it's been promised that there won't be one cable tie on your chain anymore it's been promised that it won't be you holding that chain anymore and that little breach in your Hull that the devil just comes and tickles every now and again but there's been promise that you will be impervious it's been promised that you will be changed it's been promised that you will come into a condition where he cannot affect you anymore so that you can walk with God and and be not such a small unseen breach can lead to separation from God and you remember when we preached on this and how below the water line this great proud ship and all its engineering and yet there was a tiny little gouge that caused the sink in the death of 1500 people and it's these hidden un things unseen things like lust that you can hide from the people but you can't hide from God and you can't hide from yourself and you're certainly not hiding it from the devil and so what is he doing he what you might just start flying start taking off and having a good time with the Lord and you begin to see things and your identity gets revealed and then all of a sudden you're back on the ground again all of a sudden you're struggling again and you're up and down and roller coaster because of a gouge that God can heal right now while you're sitting spiritual healing this is that flesh Hull that Hull see that hole of that Titanic this is the reason it was so weak was the rivets were actually impure the whole makeup wasn't pure but you see I can't read that we must be covered with Revelation and led by the spirit of total Deliverance into total deliverance and stature in him Romans 7 15. now this is what I wanted to get to just to show you I want you to know that this is our day this is our hour this is what's promised you so that you can you know you can pray for things and you've heard a preacher preach right and he's just preached the stuff and he's got given no backing but I'm giving you some backing so that you can pray specifically for God to totally heal your breach totally take that weak spot away from you who wants that weak spot who says we have to have that weak spot till the end of the Rapture right no Prophet didn't say that that's just what some preachers are saying the prophet never said that that would be there till the end he never said that but he said everyone has one but he didn't say God can't take it away and especially when the Capstone comes down on the church at the end time listen to this and you remember the opening scripture I read how when the day where the sun would shine as the moon and the moon and all of that and and how in the day that he binds up the breach of his people do you know what he says before that he says the day after the tower was full and I've always thought that that was the Twin Towers because in 2001 from that time on the whole message changed and there was a great Revival and a great Unity that opened up in the message it wasn't the time of Judges anymore there was it wasn't just politics and fighting with a tiny remnant of True Believers but it's actually people Awakening into a love condition and this was all tying into what I'm about to say that that we're coming into a great time of prophetic fulfillment and I'm about to give you some background so please just bear with me therefore thus saith the Lord God behold I lay in Zion a foundation stone a tried Stone a precious Cornerstone a sure Foundation he that believes shall not make haste or should I say he that believes shall not be unstable not just running to and fro finding Solutions all that but you're stable strengthened settled established in the truth in the present truth that's the purpose of the Capstone coming down to break Babylon out of your life to set you free to show you who you are to give you wisdom skill and understanding in the word to bring you to a place where you're not sleepy in church anymore you can turn and it doesn't matter how good a preacher or better preacher may be you can receive the word judgment also will I lay to the line and righteousness to the plummet and the hail shall sweep away the Refuge of Lies how many people are stuck in in these lies seeking refuge in your life there's lies just over and over and spinning around in your head and you're constantly just underlies and lies and all these things and it's affecting you but God says that no in the end time I'm going to sweep those things away and I'm going to clear the air I'm going to remove the elephant in the room as it were I'm going to remove those things that are confusing you and it's going to be clear and all the lies are going to be exposed and the devil's going to have no hand because that's all he's ever had a bow with no arrows and the water shall overflow The Hiding Place amen this is what is happening the Capstone is coming to Zion Zion is the bride every lie and everything that the devil has told on you is being obliterated even to the point where true justification has been revealed to you and everything that the devil's done and he's and even the things that he's got you to do now you realize that they're on his head and Isaiah 28 verses 18 He says and your Covenant with Death Shall be disannulled and your agreement with hell shall not stand this is the Lord's doing for the Lord shall rise up as in Mount perazim and he shall be wrath as in the valley of gibeon that he may do his work his strange work and bring to pass his act his strange act do you know what that is that is and this is where I was saying how um after 2001 and the after the towers have fallen and the light of this message and everything has come if there's a Unity amongst the bride what is happening is the tribesmen the the the pastors the the ministry and the people as a result are coming together to bring David into kingship Jesus is becoming the king of this message the one that actually gave it is finally being exalted because of unity because of love because of an atmosphere in the fellowship and in the churches where he can come it's not just some legal tourist environment or some religious formal education system but there's a dynamic of the Holy Spirit and David the people have come together to anoint David King and Israel when they anointed David King this battle of perazim was the battle that they fought so God is saying that in the end time when I put my Capstone in the church I'm actually going to break the Covenant of hell I'm going to totally break hell off my bride I'm going to break hell off the people I'm going to break all their covenants with death and all their covenants with all their false generations and everything that's hindered the bride everything that's held her on the ground because she's going to fly she's going to have a body change she's going to come into perfect Faith she's going to have victory in every single every area of her life that's enough to give God praise that's enough to Shout to the Lord or the Earth this is what he's doing in this hour and what is he doing and and then all of a sudden right in our time we're anointing David King not because we're anything better than anyone else it's the season it's the time it's the prophecy being fulfilled and all you need to do is just Worship the Lord remain humble the prophet said that in the seventh seal don't try and figure it out be mystical be some mysterious teacher but just be humble and worship God and walk in his word he will fulfill his word by bringing it to her and so what are we in now we're in this time and he says now the Lord shall rise up as in Mount perazim which is the bridge so now what happened was then David took his men after he was anointed king and the Philistines now you wonder why you're in war you wonder why you're having hard times because when David was anointed king the Philistines heard of it and they began to fight against Israel they they came to them the the war ground as soon as they saw that David was king of all Israel that something in them was like oh we've got to go fight I thought man you guys are crazy you guys been beaten by this guy for like hundreds of years like 50 odd years or whatever 30 years and you've been beaten all the time and now you're just this is the devil so you might be going through battles because David has been anointed king and the Philistines gathered to David and David smote them he said to the Lord um Lord shall Garden the Lord says doubtless I will deliver without doubt I will deliver them into your hands it's specific how the Lord said it and so then what does he do they went and fought them and he delivered them into his hands and a lot of them ran away so it wasn't a total Deliverance at the start and so what happened was they came back the grace of God now the battles was God's grace to you he doesn't want no Philistines lurking in your life he doesn't want those things that make you feel strange make you feel discontented make you feel lustful make you feel fearful he doesn't want those so he's going to allow the Philistines to put themselves an array against you so don't be condemned don't fret be strict and established and settled in the battle because you've anointed David King who's anointed David King who's exalted him in their life hallelujah what does that mean it means war it's not been a good easy time for you it means a war because it's the Last Frontier it's the last battles right before everything's conquered Hallelujah so this is all time together for this moment and then he says and then the belly of gibeon what is gibeon gibeon is where the the Philistines said came up again and the Lord said David said shall I go up and the Lord said yes but fetch a compass go around the back by the mulberry bushes and when you hear the sound of a going then hidden and fight because the Lord will deliver the whole host now so you see the last time the day David took them from the front and they escaped back but the second time he was a total deliverance and and God see if you just follow the lord if you trust the Lord in this battle don't try and figure it out yourself that's you holding that chain together don't do that let the captain come and I'll cover that chain for you let him come and hold your family together let him come and bring that Deliverance because he gave a specific instruction he said go around the back well they're not going to escape this time and the Lord said and I give you the whole host the whole host but he says this that he may do his work his strange work and bring to pass his act his strange act and I thought my goodness what is this strange act and and and and so I'll just keep reading so it says here is not this just give me five minutes please it's not this the fast that I have chosen now but we want to get our perspective right in this hour right we don't just want to be going off on a tangent or we want to be focused and we want to be led by the captain and we want to make sure that we're at the mulberry bushes right we want to make sure we're at the Battlefront we're right where the Lord speaks us don't go and fight your crosshairs over there and certainly don't put your crosshairs on each other it's not your brother it's not your sister it's the devil and your old nature which is what we're dealing with right now is this not the fast that I have chosen to loose the bands of wickedness to undo the heavy burden and to let the oppressed go free that you break every yoke every yoke not just some this is a time of every yoke this is a time of total Deliverance Isaiah now we skip down to verse 12. and it says and they shall be of be and they that shall be of thee shall build the old waste places Thou shalt raise up the foundations of many generations I'll be speaking about that and thou shalt be called the repairer of the bridge the restorer of paths to dwell in so you see now what is God telling you this is something very precious but he's actually saying that I want to be born in you so that I can use you to repair breaches so that I can use you to build lives so that I can use your ministry so I can use your calling so that I can use your giftings this is why you fast so that these things can happen that I can break the burdens I can break yolks I can set people free I can provide for people I can heal the breach in people's lives but I'm looking for people that will get into the spirit looking for people that will walk looking for people that have courage looking for people that are on fire amen not religious not just intellectual but he's looking for a people that are willing to sacrifice their life see God use them to repair preachers to raise up the foundation of many generations what is he doing he wants to repair all of the Brokenness in your family all those things that you have inherited those things that are pulling you down those things that were broken down your forefathers he wants to raise up and heal he wants to give you Victory he wants to search your life see the prophet when he was here that glory and that anointing was healing the body you notice that he was always caught people coming out of cots stretches coming out of uh the dead was being physical it was very little on the spiritual right he wasn't really dealing in the spiritual very rare there was a few sermons that really dealt with the mind but it was mainly and his ministry was Healing The Sick and the Word was locked up in Prophecy and then released even to this day of the healing of the Mind the healing of the spirit but in his ministry when he was physically here it was focused mainly on cots and stretches right so he the law was anointing him to heal the body but now there's an anointing to heal the spirit there's an anointing to heal the mind there's an anointing to repair the breach Hallelujah said the glory so when you see in a vision when there was the tent vision and and the angel of law was standing with brother Branham showing him the third pull and showing him what was going to take place in the ministry and he said there was people that walked in crippled and they walked up to this box and they went in there and when they came out they were well and then many times he says no you forsake your cops and stretches forsake that cancer it is of the devil now rise up in the name of Jesus Christ and focus on a physical healing in many cases not subject to whatever the Lord wanted to do but many the very thrust was a physical healing of the people and so raised up the people but now the same God is here to heal the mind to heal and raise up the broken generations and the foundation of many generations and you you you all of you shall be called the repairer of the breach there were breaches in the walls of Jerusalem God used people you see the first appearing of the repairer now it's not you before I speak on this it's not you that does the repairing it's the impregnated word inside you you are nothing absolutely all you are is a vessel just like Mary you see Mary she an angel a mighty angel came down of a message to Herald the first appearing of the repairer of the breach and he paid for the sin of the whole world but first if you take Mary and personalize Mary here she is receiving the May Angel's message she receives the word for her day and she takes it in and that word conceived in her heart but because of what is needed the Lord produced a physical manifestation in her life the physical manifestation in your life is the life change is the separation from sin is the healing of the mind is the healing of the spirit is the change of your nature and you and your clothes change women start wearing woman's clothes Men start wearing men's clothes and modesty and all those things right that's a physical manifestation of a spiritual thing that happened but in that hour that world needed a savior the world needed a lamb so God produced a physical life inside the believing bride and the first appearing of the repairer now Mary this is how much the work of the repairing I'm giving you this so you realize what Jesus wants to do through you to you and through you first to you and then through you right that's why he doesn't want you to be troubled with lust doesn't want you to be troubled with all these little pity things doesn't want that stuff he wants you to be well he wants you to be pure he wants all your channels to be clear he wants all your wires to be connected so that the lightning of his holy spirit can work through you and when people come to your house and they say I've got a headache and you say no you don't it's gone why because you're a son why because you're a daughter you try that now you say that it won't go guarantee you won't go unless God's Sovereign Grace works but if you if that breach is gone you can speak and it will happen to speak it'll happen there's got to be a certain level of maturity for that to take place right it's all time locked but let's not make excuses for our lack of faith and unbelief don't make excuses there's a reason why it's because there's breaches in your hole and it's under the water and you're hiding it from people and it's under there and no one can see it but God wants to hear it but anyway this is how separated this work of the repairer through you is Mary was only responsible for believing and when she believed that's what happened to her her life changed her clothing changed her attitude changed her hunger changed her food changed the life inside her was calling for a certain food the life inside her was calling for a bit of this and a bit of that and Joseph would have to go get it right just like when your wife was pregnant and whatnot and there was different Cravings because there was a life calling for it but there was a life inside of her but the lamb needed to be born so he came forth and he was born and then he began to do the works and he began to change lives and he began to preach the gospel and Glad Tidings and he was anointed with the spirit and he raised the dead and he and he and he and he preached the word to everybody and and then he paid for the sins of the whole world now you can't ascribe that to Mary right because he came forth from Mary but now at the second appearing of the repairer after the devil you know because you see he came forth he bridged the way he bound the breach of the people sin was broken and now there was a connection between God and man right great connection was formed the chasm was formed but what did the devil do he got it closed closed off and began to trouble the people and and put lies and he got sealed over just like they sealed over the tomb and held the Life of Christ in the Tomb with a Roman seal so that same Roman Spirit came over the church and sealed that life back in the Tomb until it was only a very small remnant of people that was true believers throughout the ages and even in the Dark Age it was almost canceled but that had to happen right but then Here Comes God restoring it back and then in 1963 yes in 1963 here comes a mighty Angel down to a woman again to reveal the message right now this message I just felt like grabbing this out of Ben's office but this message and it came down with an open book and it came to a bride and he gave it to the seventh angel and the seventh angel began to preach the heralding of the second coming of the Lord and a woman just here we are receives the word of this Mighty Angel that's come down right and now a prophet says yes and that seed of the word enters your spirit enters your mind and you agree with it right and then that seed comes down into your body and you begin to manifest the word and the word starts to manifest in your life but there's no need for a lamb there's already a lamb the lamb has been revealed my salvation has been sealed it's been settled but inside you he stays inside you so yes he was born and Mary at a certain point but in you he continues to develop are you with me I have to just squeeze all this in because if I don't it won't tie the whole thing together and we'll just be stopping in the middle of the thought someday there would be a just one who would come made comfortable to this world conformable to this world and in the form of God's image made after the fashion of man would take upon him the form of sinful flesh otherwise would stand in the breach between an Angry God a holy God and a sinful man and would put his hands on both of them and Bridge the way you see that's what he did when he came and he revealed himself and he did all these works so he came forth from Mary but he knew what he's doing in you because you believe the word of the mighty angel in the end time to Herald the second coming he's manifested in your life so that he can use you to do the same things that he did when he was walking the streets of Galilee but he needs you to be healed he needs your breaches to be bound up this is what he wants to do in our hour Hallelujah do you believe that amen and would stand in the breach Isaiah 31-32 for through the voice of the Lord the Assyrian will be broken and the Lord's Rod will be lifted up against him and every blow of the rod of his punishment which the Lord will send on him will be with the sound of music and with the waving of his sword the Lord will make war against him and you're so glad that the Lord would give us music speaking of Music can I have the musicians please hmm The Voice why would God say these things he's trying to identify that in the hour and the days of the voice of the Lord he's going to break the power of Satan out of your life and his Rod will be lifted up against him and every blow of the rod of his punishment which the Lord will send on him will be with the sound of music and with the waving of a sword Hallelujah the Lord will make war against them this is what God is doing in this hour who's ready stand up this is interactive now the sermon hasn't finished but can you play I know the master of the Wind what key is that played him gee this is we're not finished I've gone through all this and it's been laborious for this this is a moment now I want you to be very serious this is wartime and you're going to speak to the enemy you're going to speak to God you're going to speak to the the the out you're just going to voice this we're gonna it's battle time [Music] the hatred of sin has lust's ultimatum it's time for you to stop bearing with the sin in your life it's time for you to take those ones that you've placed in tribute those little Natures that are inside you that you're struggling with that you're just like I'll live with it don't live with it any longer no more don't leave here tonight without dealing with that I know it's late I know you're probably tired you want to go to work tomorrow but what's work going to get you money who cares it's just money let's not be too regimented where we have to finish at a certain time all the time when there is an opportunity now like Jacob took his opportunity to walk in the spirit is to take that Jew opportunity that you have listen to this hate the evil and love the good and establish judgment in the gate it may be that the Lord will be gracious unto the remnant of Joseph fear the lord is to hate evil the fear of the Lord is to hate evil pride and arrogancy in the evil way in the throat mouth do I hate listen here you know that's what ought to happen to you here on these cots and stretches this afternoon just get a little mad at the Devil say you old lying Rascal you're a liar Christ made me free I don't have to sit like this no more and I don't want you we may not have cots and stretches tonight but there's things that can your life very easily there's things that I'm talking to myself here too that we bear with but there is a Capstone in our life there's there's this Grace tonight that we can warn our the Lord is here to make war against that Assyrian and he says with the sound of music and the waving of the sword that's why I had the burden on my heart to wave the sword at you so that you can take the sword in your own hands tonight and you can wage war on the enemy with me because I believe together we can come together we can stop thinking about how long I'm preaching we can stop thinking about going home and we can wait some more on that stupid devil that slimy snake that's ruined our families has ruined and caused prodigal sons and daughters out in the world taking drugs having sex and all those things with people that's the Satan that we need to fight today and I believe that the Lord wants to wage war on him but he's looking for a people that are willing he's looking for a people they're going to toe the line as the prophet says he says this you he says to them you're lying Rascal I don't have to sit like this no more I'm not going to be crippled anymore he says to the devil get out of here tow the line with him brother toe the love with him sister he hasn't got a bit of authority Jesus stripped him of every legal right he had when he died at Calvary the whole
