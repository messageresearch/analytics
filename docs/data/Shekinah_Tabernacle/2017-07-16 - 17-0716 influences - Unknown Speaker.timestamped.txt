[46:20] chapter 8 if you've got your Bibles
[46:24] handy and then also there's the we want

[46:54] in snow and we have a good time I mean
[46:58] it's also gonna be a good time in the
[46:59] Lord too so Deuteronomy chapter 8 and
[47:05] we'll read from read from verse 10 and
[47:10] we're gonna read down to verse 17 it
[47:13] says so this is Moses giving us last
[47:16] instructions well let's actually go from
[47:20] verse 7 down to verse 17 for the LORD
[47:26] thy God bringeth thee into a good land a
[47:28] land of Brooks of water of fountains of
[47:31] depths that spring out of valleys and
[47:33] hills a land of wheat sorry
[47:41] bringeth thee into a good land a land of
[47:43] Brooks of water of fountains of dips
[47:45] that spring out of valleys a land of
[47:47] wheat and barley and vines and fig trees
[47:49] and pomegranates a land of olive oil of
[47:52] oil olive soy and honey a land Aaron
[47:55] thou shalt eat bread without scare sness
[47:58] thou shall not lack in
[48:00] anything in it a land whose stones are
[48:02] iron and out of whose hills they'll make
[48:05] biggest brass when thou has eaten and
[48:08] are full then thou shalt bless the Lord
[48:11] thy God for the good land which he has
[48:13] given me beware that they'll forget not
[48:16] the LORD thy God and not keeping his
[48:18] commandments and his judgments and his
[48:20] statutes which I command thee this day
[48:22] lease when thou has eaten and out full
[48:25] and has built goodly houses excuse me
[48:29] and dwelt there and and when my herds
[48:32] and my flocks multiply and my silver and
[48:35] my gold is multiplied and all that thou
[48:38] hath is multiplied then thy heart be
[48:40] lifted up and now forgetting the LORD
[48:43] thy God which brought thee forth out of
[48:45] the land of Egypt from the house of
[48:47] bondage who led thee through that great
[48:49] and terrible wilderness
[48:50] Grenn was wearing were fiery serpents
[48:53] and scorpions and drought which there
[48:56] was no water which brought thee forth
[48:58] out water out of the rock of Flint who
[49:01] fed thee in the wilderness with manna
[49:03] which thy father's knew not that he
[49:06] might Humble thee and that he might
[49:08] prove thee to to do the good at I let
[49:12] her in that I and thou say in thine
[49:15] heart my power and the might of my hand
[49:18] hath gotten me this wealth amen and this
[49:23] also go to I know we just finished here
[49:27] actually god bless you friends you may
[49:28] have your seats now I want to really
[49:36] speak on a subject that I know I've
[49:38] probably touched it a few times but I
[49:41] want to post a question to you well
[49:45] we're gonna read a bit later on but my
[49:47] subject really this morning is as
[49:49] influences things that influence but
[49:52] you'll notice in the Bible and history
[49:56] repeats itself because man does not
[49:58] change right it doesn't matter what
[50:01] covenant man is under a man is still the
[50:03] same so history repeats itself because
[50:06] man does not change now we read the
[50:10] scripture because we can parallel
[50:14] what Moses is telling them with the
[50:17] Christian journey as in the bride of
[50:19] Jesus Christ in this last H and as a
[50:22] local body and as an individual in
[50:25] Christ right so now here here they had
[50:29] been brought they had been brought out
[50:31] of Egypt by a supernatural ministry God
[50:36] sent them a prophet
[50:37] God was in that prophet and God sent
[50:40] Moses down into Egypt to deliver his
[50:42] people that they're once slaves now once
[50:45] in bondage now was just a tool in the
[50:48] hands of Pharaoh God delivered them
[50:50] supernaturally and he was going to place
[50:52] him in a land of promise he was going to
[50:55] place them in the land that really
[50:57] belonged to them into the Promised Land
[50:59] and so God had delivered them an
[51:02] incredible way and now they had come to
[51:05] a spot where he is Moses because Moses
[51:07] couldn't go into the Promised Land but
[51:09] Moses is warning them when you get into
[51:13] this kind of condition when it life
[51:16] begins it becomes easy when you're when
[51:19] you're established in your inheritance
[51:21] right beware then you know many times
[51:25] it's after the victory that's when the
[51:27] enemy comes in amen and that's when he
[51:29] deals his fatal blow
[51:31] so and we can see it and and the life of
[51:35] will go to you sire
[51:36] we'll go to King David but then we'll go
[51:39] to the Apostle Paul because the Apostle
[51:41] Paul broke the cycle hallelujah many
[51:44] years I've got it written down here
[51:46] later on but you know he saw he met the
[51:49] Lord on the road to Damascus and God
[51:52] supernaturally met him and then I think
[51:55] it's it's quite a few years down the
[51:57] road he's been through hardship he's
[52:00] seen great victory he seen churches
[52:02] birth reveries went he's seen the same
[52:04] God that met him meets other people you
[52:08] know he seen ministry raised up he's
[52:10] seen incredible things and he stood in
[52:12] front of King Agrippa and said I was not
[52:14] disobedient to the heavenly version so
[52:16] he was his course remained unaltered he
[52:19] knew what he was called to do he didn't
[52:22] get your he didn't just relax and maybe
[52:25] you know make some Empire for himself
[52:27] and
[52:27] maybe make some kind of you know he
[52:29] could have just set back maybe an
[52:31] emphasis or somewhere and just send out
[52:33] letters and life could have got easy and
[52:35] that way you know we we live in rest if
[52:40] you're in Christ you've been sent into
[52:42] eternal rest but that's not the kind of
[52:44] rest that I'm talking about this
[52:45] dangerous right so I talked about when
[52:48] things were going to get rested I'm not
[52:49] talking about your spiritual state I'm
[52:51] talking about when we're now you are now
[52:53] I've conquered this enemy and then you
[52:57] begin to if you lose vision of what
[53:01] you're called to be and that's when the
[53:03] enemy comes in because remember the
[53:06] promised land wasn't just given that
[53:09] they could have a land flowing with milk
[53:10] and honey and have and have a lot of
[53:13] food and have a lot in ice places the
[53:15] promised land was given because God gave
[53:16] them that land that they would have her
[53:18] that they would walk with God in that
[53:20] land right the promised land was God his
[53:23] word would be fulfilled when they're in
[53:25] that land Moses even tells him that that
[53:28] you will go into this land and you'll
[53:29] fulfill the word that's been given amen
[53:32] so it's not the promised land wasn't
[53:34] just a place to enjoy the goodness of
[53:36] life it was to walk with the Living God
[53:39] and it's the same thing with you and I
[53:42] as that knowing him as not just to have
[53:45] a never ever have a nice life or nice
[53:49] families or a nice church it's more than
[53:52] that has to walk with the Living God
[53:54] amen
[53:56] so now God delivered them as I said he
[53:59] delivered them out of out of Egypt
[54:01] brought them into the Promised Land
[54:03] they went into their inheritance after
[54:05] this Deuteronomy you know Joshua meet
[54:08] the same God Moses met and he placed
[54:10] them in their inheritance now we
[54:13] understand that we are living now in the
[54:16] time of not the first Exodus coming out
[54:18] of Egypt or the second one coming out of
[54:20] a out of old formal religions into
[54:23] Christ but we have come into a time of a
[54:25] third Exodus who who's heard the message
[54:28] the third Exodus I trust you've heard
[54:30] that I mean so so that you're so brother
[54:33] Bremer is now paralleling now the first
[54:36] Exodus God sent a prophet they had a
[54:38] blood sacrifice they came out
[54:39] Egypt under the atonement and God placed
[54:42] them in the land into into Palestine
[54:44] which was an exodus out of Egypt now -
[54:48] from a natural land into a natural lands
[54:51] they left Egypt they went into Israel
[54:53] and then the second Exodus was when
[54:54] Christ came and he delivered the people
[54:57] out of cold formal religion and he and
[55:00] he took them not into another physical
[55:02] place but he brought them into a
[55:04] spiritual rest in himself and so now the
[55:07] 3rd Exodus now is that God is calling
[55:09] the people to leave this world to go
[55:11] into heaven I mean that is the third
[55:14] Exodus now so we have been called
[55:16] because the same pillar of fire they met
[55:17] Moses in a burning bush the same pillar
[55:20] of fire that dwelt in Jesus Christ the
[55:22] same pillar fire which was God member
[55:23] that's gardener form he came in the
[55:25] upper room and wealth and a hundred and
[55:27] twenty and that same pillar father met
[55:28] Paul on the road to Damascus reappeared
[55:31] in these last days
[55:32] amen to show that people here I have
[55:34] come amen to reveal myself to you to
[55:37] take you from this world to the next
[55:39] world amen so now this is so this is a
[55:42] great time now where God has moved upon
[55:46] the earth and every kindred nation and
[55:49] tongue and he's gathering a people to
[55:51] himself hallelujah now so so we have
[55:55] been brought out of slavery I trust
[55:58] you've been brought out of slavery that
[56:00] you're not a slave to you to this world
[56:02] you're not a slave to your flesh you
[56:04] don't pander to what you want above all
[56:06] things I mean you're not a slave to a
[56:08] just dead religion but you've been
[56:10] delivered out of that house of bondage
[56:12] and now you serve a living God
[56:14] hallelujah so now so we have been called
[56:17] in an exodus Amen yeah we are the most
[56:20] privileged people and it's not just a
[56:22] nice four walls that surround the world
[56:24] I mean God has called the people and
[56:26] they've gathered hallelujah they've
[56:27] gathered unto Him amen
[56:30] and so now we the same thing God set the
[56:35] spirit of Elijah upon the earth to
[56:37] forerunner second coming and God is not
[56:40] physically come buddy spiritually here
[56:42] all the crisis has been revealed I mean
[56:44] the opening of the seals I hope you
[56:46] don't trip on it first the full word
[56:47] intimate birth Center for men
[56:50] manifestation I mean to all the Jesus
[56:53] all the goddesses present upon the earth
[56:55] but he's not here in his physical form
[56:57] was corporal body we will meet him that
[56:59] way in the air amen
[57:02] he comes God down he comes and speaks to
[57:04] Moses I have come down go read Exodus 4
[57:06] I've heard the cries for my people I
[57:08] have come down to deliver them and I'm
[57:10] sending you everything God was was now
[57:13] veiled in a pillar foreigner and a
[57:15] burning bush amen and then that same God
[57:19] because he's the angel of the Covenant
[57:20] comes down and he becomes flesh in Jesus
[57:23] Christ hallelujah and and Paul meets the
[57:26] same one amen so now we've been called
[57:29] out now but then there's the challenge
[57:32] as they receive the same challenge
[57:36] they're in the in the Old Testament this
[57:38] must not become just a culture this must
[57:42] not just become a way of life as in as
[57:45] and this is how we dress that we go to
[57:47] church maybe two times a week you know
[57:49] we we dress a certain way we do certain
[57:52] things we don't do other things you know
[57:54] it just becomes a dead culture must not
[57:56] come that way I mean because it's when
[57:58] it's when it becomes just a Christian
[58:00] culture I mean that's when the enemy
[58:03] comes in amen and that's when the people
[58:07] people become enslaved again you take
[58:11] the book of Judges you say well we've
[58:12] gone past the book of Judges David fell
[58:15] in the same trap the Kings fell into the
[58:17] same kind of trap amen is that weird you
[58:20] see it in the book of Judges is a cycle
[58:22] God comes upon the scene no they the
[58:25] people for some reason they forsake the
[58:28] Living God and their worship idols
[58:30] what are those idols ever do for them
[58:32] nothing but then now though that we're
[58:34] going to worship Bale and all different
[58:36] kinds of things and then the enemy comes
[58:38] in and they become enslaved and then
[58:40] they call out upon God and God sends a
[58:43] deliverer and God delivers them and then
[58:45] they go to idols again and then they
[58:48] call out upon God and God delivers them
[58:50] and they call out upon God you know and
[58:52] it's a cycle all this up because man
[58:55] does not change amen and it's it's the
[58:59] same thing let's go
[59:00] let's go to judges chapter 2
[59:05] they'll say well you may let's just read
[59:08] this quickly but maybe just as we're
[59:11] turning you say well that sounds crazy
[59:14] you read the book of Judges this is
[59:17] madness here's the people God got that
[59:20] incredible things for them you take you
[59:23] take just one plate falling in Egypt
[59:25] that's incredible
[59:26] you take the Red Sea opening that's
[59:28] incredible you take them crossing Jordan
[59:30] this there's a bunch of priests carrying
[59:32] a golden box the Ark of the Covenant
[59:33] they step into the river and the river
[59:35] parts like dry land they cross over
[59:37] about a million people that's incredible
[59:40] they walk around Jericho a certain way
[59:44] and they shot and they blow the trumpets
[59:46] the seventh time on the seventh day the
[59:48] walls fall down flat that's incredible I
[59:50] mean they're fighting an enemy
[59:52] Joshua stands up Sun stand still moon
[59:54] stands still until we defeat our enemies
[59:57] and it did
[59:58] that's incredible hallelujah well then
[1:00:02] what on earth would people go from that
[1:00:06] to serving idols I'll tell you what it
[1:00:10] is influence
[1:00:10] it's an influence came in comes in
[1:00:13] subtly even sometimes sounds like a good
[1:00:16] idea you know like you take first or
[1:00:18] second kings you take after Solomon
[1:00:20] there's a few kings where they where the
[1:00:22] with the people of Belial the people of
[1:00:25] bale come into the King King whoever it
[1:00:28] is they say you should worship this God
[1:00:29] look how he's prospered these nations
[1:00:32] and there's the Assyrians and Grady
[1:00:34] empires rising up if we worship their
[1:00:36] gods will be like them and they worship
[1:00:38] their gods and they were destroyed so
[1:00:42] logically it's all that kind of sounds
[1:00:44] right but it's an influence comes in
[1:00:46] because people they begin to look at
[1:00:49] political power and they begin to look
[1:00:51] at the nations around them and see it up
[1:00:53] just being sold out to serving God
[1:00:57] judges chapter 2 now influence here's
[1:01:01] one influence dying and another
[1:01:02] influence coming forth judges 2 and 7
[1:01:05] and the people served the Lord all the
[1:01:08] days of Joshua and all the days of the
[1:01:10] elders that outlived Joshua which had
[1:01:13] seen all the great work to the Lord that
[1:01:15] he did for Israel and Joshua the son of
[1:01:17] nun
[1:01:18] the servant of the Lord died being a
[1:01:19] hundred and ten years old and they
[1:01:21] buried him in the border of his
[1:01:23] inheritance and timotheus and the mount
[1:01:26] of ephraim on the north side of the hill
[1:01:30] of gash and also all that generation
[1:01:34] were gathered unto their fathers and
[1:01:36] there arose another generation after
[1:01:38] them which knew not the Lord nor yet the
[1:01:42] works which he had done for Israel so
[1:01:45] this is Judges chapter two and now we're
[1:01:48] in verse ten I'll give you time if
[1:01:51] you're still turning look at this you
[1:01:53] say how could this happen you say we're
[1:01:58] under the blood of the New Covenant yes
[1:01:59] we are but influences are still
[1:02:02] influencing we are not immune you got to
[1:02:06] understand we are not immune to the
[1:02:08] works of the enemy we are not immune to
[1:02:10] his devices we are not ignorant of his
[1:02:13] devices but we're not immune that's why
[1:02:16] the enemy comes and against you you know
[1:02:18] that's why the same same battles that
[1:02:21] that we fight people in the world fight
[1:02:22] but the difference is we have overcoming
[1:02:25] power I mean we ever the kept that of
[1:02:27] the hosters Jesus he is the one who
[1:02:30] fights our battles for us amen so now
[1:02:34] are we all there verse 10 and also all
[1:02:37] that generation that gathered unto their
[1:02:38] fathers and there arose another
[1:02:40] generation after them which knew not the
[1:02:42] Lord nor yet the works which he had done
[1:02:46] for Israel and the children of Israel
[1:02:49] did evil in the sight Lord and serve
[1:02:50] Balaam Balaam and they forsook the Lord
[1:02:53] their God of their fathers and brought
[1:02:55] them out of the land of Egypt and
[1:02:57] followed other gods of the gods of the
[1:03:00] people that were round about them and
[1:03:02] bowed themselves under them and provoked
[1:03:04] the Lord to anger Wow here's a people
[1:03:11] I'm gonna hire eyes what a really stress
[1:03:13] this point because you've got to really
[1:03:14] come I'm going to maybe jump forward to
[1:03:16] jump back a few times you got to look at
[1:03:18] yourself look at your family look at
[1:03:23] your children and you asked your
[1:03:25] question how I treat my spouse how I
[1:03:28] raise my children
[1:03:29] how I have my family
[1:03:31] is it according to tradition or culture
[1:03:35] now there's good things introducing good
[1:03:38] things in culture but there's also bad
[1:03:40] things right as there you know other
[1:03:43] other ways I have my family and conduct
[1:03:46] myself as that position in the family is
[1:03:48] it according to the word of the Lord or
[1:03:51] is it tradition I just one I'm just
[1:03:54] gonna I'm just throwing it out there
[1:03:56] amen how we because we cannot we do not
[1:03:59] want to be blinded because what happens
[1:04:02] now you can go through history and you
[1:04:04] can see parents have made the same
[1:04:06] mistakes their forebears made and the
[1:04:08] next generation makes the same mistake a
[1:04:10] next generation makes the same mistake
[1:04:12] and then the and in the next generation
[1:04:14] makes the same mistake why are you
[1:04:17] repeating that because there's been a
[1:04:18] lot of generations who've made a lot of
[1:04:19] mistakes I mean but the good news is oh
[1:04:22] maybe I'll just put this now this is
[1:04:25] going to be maybe a bit more of a heavy
[1:04:26] kind of service but here we are okay I'm
[1:04:29] just sorry this is just how does but the
[1:04:32] question is now how we raise our
[1:04:34] children
[1:04:35] is it because we've seen our parents
[1:04:39] make mistakes and we say I will never do
[1:04:41] that see you swing the other way yeah I
[1:04:45] mean how you doing it you say just say
[1:04:48] if they were just say if they I never
[1:04:51] had anything nice when I was growing up
[1:04:54] and my siblings got it all so then now
[1:04:57] I'm gonna never treat my kids on there
[1:04:59] and you just spoil them rotten you
[1:05:02] change what you do out of a complex out
[1:05:04] of pain instead of actually saying a lot
[1:05:07] give me godly wisdom how I can be a good
[1:05:10] parent Amen you see how you're just say
[1:05:14] if you're you know just say you saw how
[1:05:16] your mum treated your dad
[1:05:18] you say I'm not going to treat my
[1:05:19] husband that way and then you swing time
[1:05:21] in the opposite direction or vice versa
[1:05:26] now is that out of complex or is that
[1:05:31] out of actually Holy Ghost leadership I
[1:05:33] mean because subconsciously
[1:05:36] you got to understand how we raise our
[1:05:38] children or how we you know how we raise
[1:05:42] our children as more than the words we
[1:05:44] say
[1:05:45] it is what they see is doing right so
[1:05:50] many times you can see families where
[1:05:54] there is see children often they don't
[1:05:57] see the love you know and I'll put it
[1:06:00] this way there can be a great love
[1:06:03] between husband and wife and then that
[1:06:08] that they just love each other so much
[1:06:11] but then how the husband treats the wife
[1:06:14] as the wife will just do everything for
[1:06:15] the husband and then because they don't
[1:06:18] see the love I hope this comes out right
[1:06:19] okay because the parents our children
[1:06:22] are done yes you see the love the sons
[1:06:24] will now just treat their wives when
[1:06:26] they get married just like servants you
[1:06:28] understand there's no that they don't
[1:06:30] see the love involved in the
[1:06:32] relationship is that okay right so they
[1:06:37] will they will see what's going on but
[1:06:39] they actually understand what's going on
[1:06:40] and I'll say that's how I should treat a
[1:06:42] wife or that's how I should treat a
[1:06:44] husband right so it's more actually what
[1:06:49] we do as opposed to what we say has a
[1:06:53] great influence a meant and so the
[1:06:57] question has to be now we have to
[1:06:59] understand as well there is a spirit in
[1:07:02] this nation you go into any nation under
[1:07:05] heaven there's a spirit you go to the
[1:07:08] you go to Germany you'll go to one of
[1:07:10] those nations it's a military kind of
[1:07:12] spirit you know you go to America it's a
[1:07:15] haha kind of spirit you know you come
[1:07:18] down to New Zealand and there's just a
[1:07:20] she'll be right take it easy you know
[1:07:23] it's a different kind of spirit again
[1:07:26] now we live in that atmosphere around
[1:07:29] here right the how how the nation was
[1:07:34] was shaped and the British coming here
[1:07:37] in different nationalities coming here
[1:07:39] this great melting pot their spirits
[1:07:40] have come in and you say well I'm not
[1:07:43] off that I've been birthed by the Holy
[1:07:46] Ghost amen but the thing is that thing
[1:07:50] will try and influence you it'll try and
[1:07:53] influence you you know you take the you
[1:07:56] take
[1:07:57] the bad side of the old Kiwi culture you
[1:08:01] know the not the number-8 fencing wire
[1:08:03] mentality where just take what you have
[1:08:06] in user to the best you can but the
[1:08:08] whole dad is distant doesn't talk just
[1:08:12] goes and works comes home no
[1:08:14] relationship with children you know and
[1:08:17] that was from results of the second
[1:08:19] world war from Korea from Vietnam War
[1:08:22] you know whole generation came back
[1:08:25] scarred and battle scarred and
[1:08:27] shell-shocked and you know and there was
[1:08:30] no way for them to deal with it so they
[1:08:33] just withdrew within themselves trying
[1:08:36] to cope with their own scars and pain
[1:08:38] and then what does that do to the next
[1:08:41] generation but it becomes a culture
[1:08:45] Amen now that's the quick now so the
[1:08:48] question is now do we as that influenced
[1:08:52] us and would have somewhere because I'm
[1:08:55] sure we've all had who's had forebears
[1:08:57] it fought in the war who's that
[1:08:59] forebears that fought in First World War
[1:09:01] Second World War Korea Vietnam any kind
[1:09:04] of war that will if that has affected
[1:09:06] you either directly or indirectly a
[1:09:10] meant who's who's had four bits that if
[1:09:14] that have suffered very violent crime
[1:09:17] yep that will have that has affected you
[1:09:19] either directly or indirectly amen and
[1:09:23] so now those things have been passed
[1:09:26] down whether we like it or not
[1:09:29] what do we do with it do it you say this
[1:09:33] is my lot in life you know as I've seen
[1:09:36] a while ago my brother Tim Pruett see
[1:09:38] that's like it's just a grab bag of life
[1:09:40] it's like a bag something you just grab
[1:09:42] out whatever you get that blogs to you
[1:09:44] well you may grab something out but what
[1:09:46] do you do with it do you say oh this is
[1:09:49] mine but you say I do not want this this
[1:09:52] will not rule me I will not be subject
[1:09:55] to this thing
[1:09:57] it's influence I mean because we must
[1:10:01] understand God is not a cookie cutter so
[1:10:05] how all of us living different all of us
[1:10:08] have different backgrounds all of us
[1:10:10] live in different environments right so
[1:10:13] there's not a cookie cutter this is how
[1:10:15] a family must live in a certain kind of
[1:10:17] socio-economic place and you know have
[1:10:20] this kind of a house and dad must have
[1:10:22] this kind of a job and you know it's not
[1:10:25] a cookie cut away right so there's
[1:10:27] variables within it but yet within all
[1:10:30] the way how is home and influence and
[1:10:39] influence the the definition of an
[1:10:41] influence is the capacity to have an
[1:10:44] effect on the character the development
[1:10:46] or behavior of someone or something or
[1:10:49] the effect itself so it's an and
[1:10:52] influence will mold you right I'm going
[1:10:56] to be real this may be laborious but
[1:10:58] just bear with me all things come to an
[1:11:01] end
[1:11:02] but I want you to think about these
[1:11:04] things right because what is so what
[1:11:09] influences us the most we will become
[1:11:12] okay so it's either see because that's
[1:11:15] why people that's why the world they put
[1:11:18] up and I've seen as before but they'll
[1:11:20] put music videos out there or or movies
[1:11:23] or books that are ungodly and it
[1:11:27] captures the imagination of people you
[1:11:30] say well and we know some people here
[1:11:33] that they'll say that only ever
[1:11:34] influenced me but it does anyway
[1:11:37] without the Holy Ghost things will
[1:11:38] influence you the wrong way and so
[1:11:40] people see an image and they and they
[1:11:43] see a you know like a movie star saying
[1:11:46] sir I want to become that well let's see
[1:11:48] a sports star I remember being there I
[1:11:50] want to become that you know we were we
[1:11:53] were talking at work just at morning tea
[1:11:56] you know what did you want to do when
[1:11:58] you grew up I said I still don't know
[1:12:00] but I see well I wanted to I wanted a
[1:12:03] sale in the America's Cup I wanted to be
[1:12:05] in them and the Black Caps you know what
[1:12:07] I wanted to whatever was the fair of the
[1:12:09] day
[1:12:10] you know that caught my attention I
[1:12:11] wanted to become it a mint so it's
[1:12:16] whatever captures your imagination
[1:12:18] that's why you want to become you got to
[1:12:21] look now and say where will this
[1:12:23] influence take me Lord
[1:12:25] because you can have all the good
[1:12:27] intentions well without the Lord
[1:12:29] steering where you're going to go
[1:12:31] remember I said I see it a couple of
[1:12:35] Sundays ago there's a perfect world and
[1:12:36] there's a permissive world so we can't
[1:12:39] just we can't just plow on through life
[1:12:41] saying I'm always in the perfect will of
[1:12:42] God amen because there is a permissive
[1:12:46] will that we can go down but I believe
[1:12:50] God will steer you out of it
[1:12:52] amen it was that was God's permissive
[1:12:56] will for a lot of things to happen but
[1:12:59] God will steer you out of it right so we
[1:13:01] want to really look at now now don't be
[1:13:03] afraid just walk with God if you the
[1:13:06] footsteps of a good man are ordered of
[1:13:08] the law you have to walk in a direction
[1:13:10] right and if you're if you're flexible
[1:13:13] to him he will guide you I mean she
[1:13:16] can't just stand still and say God show
[1:13:17] me what to do today just walk and he'll
[1:13:21] show you got to have confidence of the
[1:13:22] one that's leading you amen so now
[1:13:26] whatever mold you now let's just go to
[1:13:30] and ask you the question now what does
[1:13:33] influence union the most and it's
[1:13:35] something of this world that's
[1:13:36] influencing you or is it God Himself is
[1:13:39] influencing you because if it's God
[1:13:42] you'll become like him you'll have his
[1:13:44] nature and his character that's what
[1:13:46] you'll receive but if it's of the world
[1:13:48] maybe you can be a religious person and
[1:13:51] you can be influenced by the world more
[1:13:53] than God and that is terrible way to be
[1:13:56] in because someone who's just religious
[1:13:59] will justify themselves all the day long
[1:14:01] at least I'm not like that person and
[1:14:03] there'll always be someone who's worse
[1:14:04] than you in your eyes and as soon as you
[1:14:07] see them
[1:14:08] remember the consciousness yo it's
[1:14:11] amazing look down at faces you know and
[1:14:15] you know what's going on in yourself and
[1:14:17] God dealing don't just try and justify
[1:14:22] but at least I'm not that person
[1:14:24] I'd say grab that grab that conviction
[1:14:28] say God here I come
[1:14:30] hallelujah here I come God changing mold
[1:14:34] me I mean done just justified say well
[1:14:37] at least I'm not struggling like that
[1:14:38] person is I mean there were two people
[1:14:40] went into the temple one day as a
[1:14:42] Pharisee and there was a sinner and the
[1:14:44] Pharisee they're both praying and he's
[1:14:47] the Pharisee Pharisees and I think it's
[1:14:49] an actor means an actor just an outward
[1:14:50] religion nothing on the inside and he's
[1:14:53] praying there and he looks at this guy
[1:14:54] who's a sinner and he sinned us and the
[1:14:56] sinners ain't God forgive me forgive me
[1:14:59] for being this way genuinely from his
[1:15:01] heart crying out and the Pharisee saying
[1:15:03] he's probably convicted by the sky
[1:15:05] because one he's never seen Paulie he's
[1:15:08] never seen the Pharisees act like him
[1:15:09] but then he says thank you Lord I'm not
[1:15:12] like this guy I said who was more
[1:15:14] justified Jesus asked the sinner and
[1:15:18] seen as a Pharisee why he compared
[1:15:20] himself with someone else and the Bible
[1:15:23] says in second Corinthians should we
[1:15:26] read this yeah let's just jump to that
[1:15:29] 2nd Corinthians chapter 3 I believe it
[1:15:31] is
[1:15:40] I had it in my notes secret Dean's
[1:15:57] I know if I can find it might not even
[1:16:07] have it on me it escapes me now but
[1:16:11] here's here's some I second Corinthians
[1:16:14] 10 and 12 yes I had the right book see
[1:16:19] Corinthians 10 and 12 now this is real
[1:16:23] important no just just just verse so
[1:16:26] just verse 12
[1:16:28] please brother a month for we dear
[1:16:31] listen but we did not make ourselves of
[1:16:34] the number or compare ourselves with
[1:16:37] some that commend themselves right but
[1:16:41] they measuring themselves by themselves
[1:16:43] and comparing themselves among
[1:16:45] themselves are not wise right so if you
[1:16:50] compare yourself with someone else you
[1:16:52] are not wise they meant why is that
[1:16:56] because now your measuring stick becomes
[1:16:58] the other person we are not to compare
[1:17:01] ourselves by someone else
[1:17:02] that's a carnal man I'm better than this
[1:17:05] guy and if I'm not I'm going to make
[1:17:06] myself better than that guy I'm going to
[1:17:08] be number one let's drink it's very
[1:17:10] carnal we are to compare ourselves with
[1:17:13] this remember in here is the character
[1:17:17] of God in print form this is God in
[1:17:19] print form but the message is God and
[1:17:22] spoken word fall and you can go into
[1:17:25] those things and when you read this or
[1:17:28] you listen to the message which I pray
[1:17:29] you do you should say Lord mold me as
[1:17:33] I'm reading this to be mold me into your
[1:17:36] character as I'm reading amen it
[1:17:39] shouldn't just be well look look what I
[1:17:41] can read and try and remember which is
[1:17:45] fighting itself II should be there
[1:17:47] should be our hearts Lord we're laying
[1:17:48] ourselves before your presence mold me
[1:17:51] your character this is him in print form
[1:17:55] it should be Lord mold me so what is in
[1:17:58] this Bible becomes flesh so your
[1:18:01] character and remember we're called to
[1:18:03] be partakers of the divine nature so if
[1:18:07] we compare ourselves so don't compare
[1:18:09] yourself with someone else
[1:18:12] that is a big mistake we are not to be
[1:18:17] thank you for taking the done no let's
[1:18:20] go to judges chapter two and see them I
[1:18:22] saw we're rid there and we're gonna go
[1:18:25] to Isaiah chapter six influence
[1:18:41] here's Isaiah let's just read this down
[1:18:46] from first one down to verse 8 of Isaiah
[1:18:48] chapter 6 then we're gonna go on to talk
[1:18:50] about this a bit and the year that King
[1:18:53] Uzziah died I saw also the Lord sitting
[1:18:55] upon a throne high and lifted up and his
[1:18:58] train filled the temple above it stood
[1:19:01] the Seraphim each one had six wings with
[1:19:03] twain covered his face and with twain
[1:19:05] Kabbalist feet and with twain eated fly
[1:19:07] and cried unto another holy holy holy is
[1:19:10] the Lord God of hosts the whole earth is
[1:19:12] full of his glory and the posts of the
[1:19:14] door moved at the voice of him that
[1:19:16] cried and the house was filled with
[1:19:18] smoke Dean said I was me for I'm undone
[1:19:22] because I am a man of unclean lips I
[1:19:24] dwell in the midst of a people of
[1:19:26] unclean lips for mine eyes have seen the
[1:19:28] king the Lord of hosts in flew one of
[1:19:31] the serums unto me having a live coal in
[1:19:34] his hand which he had taken with the
[1:19:36] tongues from off the altar and he laid
[1:19:38] it upon my mouth and said lo this has
[1:19:41] touched thy lips that iniquity is taken
[1:19:44] away and thy sin purged also I heard the
[1:19:46] voice of the Lord saying whom shall I
[1:19:48] send and who will go for us then said I
[1:19:51] here I am send me now here's a man
[1:19:54] here's a young man he was he had a great
[1:20:00] influence in his life which was the King
[1:20:03] Uzziah king uzziah was about 16 years
[1:20:07] old when he came to the throne he was a
[1:20:09] shepherd boy and he served the Lord with
[1:20:13] all of his heart and the Lord prospered
[1:20:15] him on every hand you can go read about
[1:20:17] it and sick in chronicles 26 he was he
[1:20:23] was an incredible King and the influence
[1:20:26] of this King was very great on the
[1:20:28] Prophet but you see but they came to a
[1:20:31] spot in King his eyes life we won't read
[1:20:34] the account but go read second
[1:20:35] chronicles 26 so his kingdom prospered
[1:20:38] it became established and then he
[1:20:42] actually got lifted up in his heart and
[1:20:44] pride and thought now I can just do
[1:20:46] anything and then so he tries to take
[1:20:48] the office of a priest now here we are
[1:20:51] I'm just going to jump right on home
[1:20:53] because you
[1:20:53] where are you going with these stories
[1:20:54] here we are five years down the road
[1:20:58] the Lord has prospered us the Lord has
[1:21:00] been good to us amen I believe has been
[1:21:04] pushed back on every hand God has filled
[1:21:06] many people many people have been healed
[1:21:08] we have this place it's very nice isn't
[1:21:11] it
[1:21:12] we got wonderful musicians and
[1:21:14] songwriters and and great ministers and
[1:21:16] you know you know the Lord has been very
[1:21:18] good to us and God moves he's a living
[1:21:21] God for us he has established us now is
[1:21:25] the dangerous time now is the dangerous
[1:21:28] time because we're not we're not down
[1:21:31] there and grace-filled anymore we're
[1:21:32] draining you get buckets of water
[1:21:33] literally pouring through the ceiling it
[1:21:36] remembers those things they have a good
[1:21:37] day I mean but that was when we were
[1:21:40] kind of struggling you know fighting
[1:21:41] pressing the battle there's only a few
[1:21:44] of us if it may be 15 praise the Lord
[1:21:46] we're having a great time it's so many
[1:21:47] people here amen he remembers those days
[1:21:51] but now the Lord has been good and I
[1:21:53] pray he still is good to us but now
[1:21:55] we've got we've got establish we have
[1:21:57] Sunday school but wonderful Sunday
[1:21:59] School teachers great Sunday school
[1:22:00] great environment for our children great
[1:22:02] fellowship one for another
[1:22:04] you know we've got love between the
[1:22:05] Brethren all these wonderful things
[1:22:07] going on now is a dangerous time
[1:22:09] now's the dangerous time because we can
[1:22:13] get to a spot just like the Kings did
[1:22:15] some of them they said I can do anything
[1:22:17] I want now because the Lord just blesses
[1:22:19] me on every hand careful friends he he
[1:22:25] believes he could take the priests
[1:22:27] office he could do anything he took the
[1:22:29] censer the priests told them don't go in
[1:22:31] there you know two Levite your great
[1:22:33] kings day being a king don't don't try
[1:22:35] and take another man's office BC I can
[1:22:37] do what I want and weirdin tried to
[1:22:39] offer the go to take the center and
[1:22:41] offer it before the Lord and God smote
[1:22:43] him with leprosy and he died a leper
[1:22:45] amen
[1:22:46] then now this was a great shock to
[1:22:49] Isaiah
[1:22:50] because now a great influence in his
[1:22:52] life was now had fallen from grace and
[1:22:56] so now he begin to he began to think he
[1:23:00] went down to the temple to pray what's
[1:23:03] going on
[1:23:05] what's going on here and then he had the
[1:23:08] heavenly vision he was a prophet God was
[1:23:11] using him before this then now here
[1:23:13] comes God himself and he sees his
[1:23:15] condition he's got no one to compare
[1:23:17] himself with here and the presence of
[1:23:20] God you see these seraphim's
[1:23:21] the these serums they're there their
[1:23:25] eyes are covered their feet are covered
[1:23:26] they're covered they cry holy holy holy
[1:23:29] they're in the presence of God how much
[1:23:31] more people that have been washed by the
[1:23:34] blood how much more reverent we should
[1:23:36] be and thankful we should be he's a he's
[1:23:40] a he's a his created beings and their
[1:23:43] feet are covered and humility of their
[1:23:44] eyes are come they're all covered in
[1:23:46] every way and all they can cried is holy
[1:23:49] holy Lord God Almighty and here we are
[1:23:53] we should I pray that we have a that we
[1:23:59] have such I would say cultures by not
[1:24:01] the right word but we should have a
[1:24:02] culture we should reverence God we
[1:24:06] should absolutely reverence him we
[1:24:08] should be literally enough not always
[1:24:11] literally I mean we should be on our
[1:24:13] faces if we could be day and night
[1:24:15] brother Bram said if you the bride
[1:24:17] really knew what the Lord has done for
[1:24:20] her she would be crying out praising him
[1:24:23] day and night for what he's done and if
[1:24:26] you think about how great he is we were
[1:24:28] walking in darkness doesn't matter what
[1:24:29] church we were from doesn't matter what
[1:24:31] religious upbringing we had or lack of
[1:24:34] it God found us God called you and in
[1:24:38] God spoke to your heart you responded I
[1:24:40] mean he died on Calvary for you well you
[1:24:43] yet his enemy I mean he made away
[1:24:46] hallelujah I mean it wasn't just a
[1:24:48] religion but it became a reality that's
[1:24:51] why I always I fight I don't think I can
[1:24:53] say it enough
[1:24:54] he's a living God you must meet him for
[1:24:57] yourself
[1:24:57] don't let this become your daddy's
[1:24:59] religion your mummys religion your
[1:25:01] spouse's religion I mean don't need to
[1:25:03] become a culture it must be alive I mean
[1:25:06] because we have the greatest thing if
[1:25:07] you come in these doors and you think oh
[1:25:10] I have to go to church tonight so
[1:25:11] laborious it's so dumb you need to meet
[1:25:13] them I mean because it's the greatest
[1:25:16] privilege Amen as we can bow
[1:25:18] cuts in our heads and say our Father
[1:25:19] which art in heaven hallowed be thy name

[1:26:39] Lions Jersey on so how's the tour going
[1:26:42] for you
[1:26:43] that's dumb well but they're such a
[1:26:47] great game now didn't like it what do
[1:26:50] you mean I'm bored I didn't want to come
[1:26:54] here but you spent all this money on
[1:26:56] house it you think something's wrong
[1:26:59] with that person wouldn't you you think
[1:27:01] why are they why they've given
[1:27:03] themselves and they're here well why are
[1:27:05] you here this person made me come well
[1:27:08] how are they oh I love this that's

[1:27:16] when did you get to the stadium about an
[1:27:18] hour ago you know to me and then so what
[1:27:22] you think well why is this person like
[1:27:25] this and why is this other person hating
[1:27:27] it well this person is under the spirit
[1:27:28] of it
[1:27:29] and they've given themselves to it this
[1:27:31] person is not under the spirit of it
[1:27:33] that's why they don't like it and that's
[1:27:35] just a worldly that's already come and
[1:27:37] gone
[1:27:37] there's no eternal value of those things
[1:27:40] people went to Bermuda towards the
[1:27:43] America's Cup they go to the Olympics
[1:27:45] they saved up their money they go well
[1:27:47] it's not the same on TV I want to be in
[1:27:49] the atmosphere I want to be there when
[1:27:51] they run the hundred at the gold you
[1:27:53] know the final they're the Olympics I
[1:27:54] want to be there on the finish line they
[1:27:56] spend thousands of dollars and that's
[1:27:58] just a ticket amen and they're excited
[1:28:01] and it's just a 10-second race effect
[1:28:04] and here we are and if you you know
[1:28:10] that's why you've got to think about it
[1:28:12] well what would influence someone that
[1:28:15] they would sit there and say no this is
[1:28:16] actually dumb it's obviously not the
[1:28:19] rugby because if the rugby is the
[1:28:22] greatest influence and they'll love the
[1:28:23] tour
[1:28:24] and you take it and just you take it
[1:28:27] into eternal things come and sit here
[1:28:29] and say well this is dumb what's
[1:28:32] influencing what is influencing if you
[1:28:36] said you say how much longer well
[1:28:38] there's no clock anymore but you look at
[1:28:40] the clock I'm hungry I wonder what's for
[1:28:42] lunch I wonder what we're going to do
[1:28:43] what's going to happen Monday what's
[1:28:44] going to happen Tuesday what am I going
[1:28:46] to do now what about this and your mind
[1:28:47] goes off on some kind of tangent you
[1:28:49] know when is he going to be quiet and
[1:28:51] close and we're going to sing and I want
[1:28:52] to go out and I'm sick of this and done
[1:28:54] it it it it it it what's influencing I'm
[1:28:56] just going to broblem just right on home
[1:28:58] here we are you know something and then
[1:29:01] I can't wait for next Sunday and
[1:29:02] sometimes right now I'll just jump back
[1:29:05] to Israel they didn't throw the ark away
[1:29:09] they didn't throw the priesthood away
[1:29:11] they didn't throw away having a high
[1:29:14] priest they had all those things they
[1:29:17] didn't throw away the law of Moses they
[1:29:18] had it but what had happened something
[1:29:21] else incoming it wasn't a living reality
[1:29:23] it was just a learned thing and people
[1:29:25] can stand and they can say you can ask
[1:29:27] what is John 3:16 say I won't put anyone
[1:29:32] on the spot but most of us would know
[1:29:33] and he'd say well what does this mean
[1:29:36] and what does this mean and people just
[1:29:38] wrapping it off peridot did it in a
[1:29:39] litter you know
[1:29:42] is it real is it real it's like with you
[1:29:45] know you know with Moses and things they
[1:29:47] could sit there and say well you know
[1:29:50] like Gideon he said where is if God is
[1:29:53] with us where the miracles so they knew
[1:29:55] the stories of Egypt they knew the
[1:29:57] stories of Moses
[1:29:58] so was but it was just a tradition among
[1:30:01] them it wasn't a living reality so we
[1:30:05] can't just just just be quotas or
[1:30:08] paradis it must become a living reality
[1:30:11] what do you say about this Jesus called
[1:30:14] Christ what do you say because if he is
[1:30:19] your greatest influence I love coming to
[1:30:21] church and not because I stand here I
[1:30:24] don't come here to be seen I'd rather be
[1:30:26] in the back amen but I love I love going
[1:30:30] to prayer meeting I love listening to a
[1:30:32] tape you know I'm driving along Whoopi
[1:30:36] Theatre pyroar and there's traffic
[1:30:37] backed up hallelujah I'm stuck in
[1:30:41] traffic glory I get more time well I'm
[1:30:44] just listening to music or something
[1:30:45] praise the Lord I can just have a time
[1:30:48] amen
[1:30:50] you know it's I love it because I love
[1:30:53] his presence I love being around a
[1:30:55] member when I'm really when I'm standing
[1:30:57] here he's ministering to me as he's
[1:30:59] ministering to you hallelujah that's why
[1:31:01] you know but I like to be in his
[1:31:03] presence because I've been influenced
[1:31:06] hallelujah as I said well as me here's a
[1:31:10] prophet he's in the temple there's the
[1:31:12] holy places hold the office is as well
[1:31:15] as me I'm lost and undone who will go
[1:31:18] for us
[1:31:18] Here I am Lord seeing me and that should
[1:31:21] be the same thing worldly influences
[1:31:24] must die you look at because what you as
[1:31:26] I said what influences you will
[1:31:29] influences your choices in your go
[1:31:31] certain direction so you've got to look
[1:31:33] at your life and say now where is my
[1:31:35] life going where is it going is it
[1:31:40] staying towards the Lord do you want to
[1:31:42] that here's the question I'll just I
[1:31:44] just got on the young people for a
[1:31:46] little bit if you were an adult where
[1:31:49] will you be are you waiting just for the
[1:31:52] get out of jail free card to leave home
[1:31:56] just uh just to get out all this is so
[1:31:58] rigid this is so terrible I'll say if
[1:32:00] this is so terrible why your appearance
[1:32:02] doing it you know if this is such a
[1:32:05] terrible walk in such a yoke of bondage
[1:32:07] in US and a prison why your parents
[1:32:10] doing it cuz they've done everything
[1:32:11] else who was in the world I was in the
[1:32:14] world why am I here this is far better
[1:32:17] this is my glory there's far more
[1:32:19] satisfying there's no satisfaction out
[1:32:22] there amen
[1:32:23] I'm drinkin from a well of living water
[1:32:25] polar that'll never run dry I'm not
[1:32:29] looking for something else I found it
[1:32:31] and more importantly it found me
[1:32:34] hallelujah so if it's so great you know
[1:32:36] if the so this is why I'm here because
[1:32:39] this is a living reality and it's
[1:32:42] without money or price we do not earn it
[1:32:45] you know brother Bram said it used to be
[1:32:48] in the old days in the in the days of
[1:32:49] the Reformation they believed in the
[1:32:51] blood and works but in this in this
[1:32:55] generation when the whole word has
[1:32:56] become plain an orphan and is nothing
[1:32:58] but the blood
[1:33:00] amen it is nothing but the blood
[1:33:02] hallelujah so now we don't have to we do
[1:33:07] not have to worry about I know I just I
[1:33:09] just thought if it's so great out there
[1:33:13] why are we not out there why because if
[1:33:18] there's something better than this I'd
[1:33:20] rather be doing it you know why I've
[1:33:24] only got 70 maybe 70 years upon the
[1:33:27] earth
[1:33:27] you know threescore and ten has been
[1:33:30] allotted to every man some live longer
[1:33:32] some live shorter but you've only got a
[1:33:34] certain time span is like a countdown
[1:33:36] clock everyone's head if I have only
[1:33:40] this much time why would I do something
[1:33:41] I don't want to do if there's something
[1:33:43] better
[1:33:43] I meant and if there is something better
[1:33:46] we should find it but if this is if this
[1:33:48] is eternal if this is God that has
[1:33:51] spoken in this generation we should give
[1:33:53] everything we have to it and God has
[1:33:56] vindicated it over and over and over and
[1:33:57] over and over and over proving this is
[1:34:00] eternal this is God speaking talk about
[1:34:02] the message of the hour now now he says
[1:34:07] this is an influences the 90s
[1:34:08] sixty-four that's interesting because
[1:34:10] after the sermon he speaks US service
[1:34:13] identification there's a 1964 15th of
[1:34:20] February 1964 you do good to go listen
[1:34:24] he says now my subject tinnitus
[1:34:26] influences I want to read this story he
[1:34:30] says we would turn to second chronicles
[1:34:32] 26 chapter we could read it this news I
[1:34:35] was a shepherd boy 2nd chronicles 26
[1:34:37] tells us he has anointed king at the age
[1:34:39] of 16 his father was a godly man it was
[1:34:43] and this man was a good man having
[1:34:45] goodly parent godly parents he did that
[1:34:48] which was right in the sight of the Lord
[1:34:50] now we find that usually I think today
[1:34:53] our great problem of what we believe to
[1:34:56] be juvenile delinquency as parent
[1:34:58] delinquent a home delinquent so he's
[1:35:02] going from children to parent within the
[1:35:04] home is delinquent right how people got
[1:35:08] away from the things that they should
[1:35:10] have stayed with the church got lukewarm
[1:35:14] or cold and the children got out into
[1:35:17] the world why would that be because the
[1:35:19] influence of the believers became no
[1:35:23] because the church became lukewarm why
[1:35:26] is that happened because it became
[1:35:27] established and the people relaxed in
[1:35:30] the wrong because now we're established
[1:35:33] now we have a church order now we've
[1:35:35] been here a few years now everything's
[1:35:37] established now we can relax honor that
[1:35:40] is the time when the enemy comes in
[1:35:43] because we get used to a certain way of
[1:35:45] doing things and a certain way of
[1:35:48] service goes amen in a certain response
[1:35:51] from the people you follow me and we get
[1:35:54] you it becomes a culture and then we
[1:35:56] have church lunch a certain way and we
[1:35:58] eat certain things we do certain things
[1:36:00] it becomes a culture now there's good
[1:36:03] things and there's bad things
[1:36:05] I'm not saying throw it all out and
[1:36:07] start again
[1:36:08] but I'm saying now you've got to be
[1:36:09] careful this is the time or you know
[1:36:12] well we're well we've gone through yeah
[1:36:14] we've been down this road a few years
[1:36:16] you got to be careful you must not leave
[1:36:18] your first love
[1:36:20] I mean because if you maintain your
[1:36:22] first love for him then you'll never get
[1:36:25] stagnant you'll never become lukewarm
[1:36:27] you'll never backslide amen and that was
[1:36:31] the first problem that the church faced
[1:36:33] in the in the Ephesian age now has left
[1:36:35] thy first love and to me I believe that
[1:36:38] would have been one okay let's just
[1:36:41] forget about that are predestinated to
[1:36:43] do it the enemy came in paul said i
[1:36:45] fought the beast ephesus they're false
[1:36:48] teachers came in and perverted the word
[1:36:50] and as false brethren came in unawares
[1:36:52] and there was fighting within the
[1:36:54] believers walk in that course a loss of
[1:36:56] first love i mean if it's not doubt
[1:36:59] worth right in the hearts of the people
[1:37:00] that can cause them to lose their first
[1:37:02] love because now their walk is now out
[1:37:05] of against that guy hey with me against
[1:37:10] that guy instead of lord i love you
[1:37:11] you're my everything how glorious you
[1:37:12] are so now we don't want to go down that
[1:37:16] way and that's why the enemy will come
[1:37:19] in and he'll try and split he'll try and
[1:37:21] put brother against brother Charlie
[1:37:23] gainst child sister against sister he'll
[1:37:26] try and split the church up in some
[1:37:28] certain way because it breaks the love
[1:37:30] one for another
[1:37:31] because offense has come and offenses
[1:37:33] welcome amen it just it'll just happen
[1:37:38] brother Graham says you know you're one
[1:37:40] big sweet humble group but he'll come in
[1:37:43] he'll bring someone and shoot them with
[1:37:45] something a poison will go through
[1:37:46] everywhere if you let it happen
[1:37:48] amen and you can go back and you can see
[1:37:52] that's exactly what happened Amen you
[1:37:55] can go to Jeffersonville you can go to
[1:37:57] Tucson all these places wherever the
[1:37:59] wherever the work you go you even go
[1:38:02] Paul said after my departing grievious
[1:38:05] wolves among you will come in and rend
[1:38:07] the flock I've warned you about of about
[1:38:10] three years this is going to happen and
[1:38:12] it happened amen
[1:38:16] he say well but we're in the message so
[1:38:20] were they they received the message from
[1:38:22] God under the star of their age which
[1:38:24] was Paul they were message believers
[1:38:26] back then for their age Oh this'll never
[1:38:29] happen to us no history repeats itself
[1:38:33] but now here's the challenge now can we
[1:38:35] overcome can we overcome by divine love
[1:38:39] look beyond the fault of the brother of
[1:38:42] the sister or the child look beyond
[1:38:44] their fault
[1:38:45] can we look beyond it I pray in God's
[1:38:47] grace we can I mean this dog encounter
[1:38:50] we cannot fight these battles the same
[1:38:52] way our forebears fought it amen this
[1:38:56] great rifts in this country because
[1:38:58] people fought it the wrong way
[1:38:59] out of good intentions brother Graham
[1:39:03] says that people get so zealous for the
[1:39:05] denomination that actually splits our
[1:39:07] Brotherhood and people can be so zealous
[1:39:10] for this stand in the wrong way it can
[1:39:13] split up Brotherhood amen now the church
[1:39:19] got lukewarm or cold and the chill chill
[1:39:22] dronov into the world now Hollywood puts
[1:39:25] out a lot of movies and television and
[1:39:27] so forth it's even uncensored now you
[1:39:30] take that in 1964 and you take that
[1:39:33] today it's a billion times it's a
[1:39:36] billion times worse now than it was then
[1:39:38] yeah amen it must be a greater power in
[1:39:42] God and you Amen I'm talking about
[1:39:45] parents now I'm talking oh this should
[1:39:48] be a such an influence in your life why
[1:39:50] do we do this mommy daddy we love him he
[1:39:53] purchased our salvation he's glorious to
[1:39:56] us I mean I was lost and I'm done you
[1:39:58] don't have to go down that way you don't
[1:40:00] have to receive those Scouts I want to
[1:40:02] see what it's like there's nothing good
[1:40:04] out there
[1:40:05] hallelujah it's always the world never
[1:40:11] shows the emotional scarring that it
[1:40:14] causes it never shows it because of it
[1:40:16] if Hollywood showed the damage for
[1:40:19] psychologically it does emotionally it
[1:40:21] does they'd never sell a single film
[1:40:23] they would never ever sell a single film
[1:40:26] if they showed the damage that it caused
[1:40:27] why do you see actors and they die young
[1:40:30] or they go from relationship to
[1:40:31] relationship to relationship to broken
[1:40:33] home to divorce divorce divorce on drugs
[1:40:35] died from drug you know there's some
[1:40:37] people and they're at the height of
[1:40:39] their fame and they die they have to try
[1:40:43] to find peace by something they cannot
[1:40:44] find it because they're drowning in dark
[1:40:47] but yet outwardly look at me I'm
[1:40:49] successful if Hollywood showed the dark
[1:40:55] side of it what it causes it wouldn't
[1:40:56] sell a single thing right and you say
[1:41:00] you can't you've got to look at it for
[1:41:02] what it is you say that's being
[1:41:03] legalistic or whatever it no it's not
[1:41:05] you got to look at it for what it is and
[1:41:08] say I will have no part in that thing
[1:41:10] but that will not bring you all it what
[1:41:13] does it give children nightmares why
[1:41:16] does it give them nightmares because
[1:41:17] it's not right you ever seen you know
[1:41:21] thinks things that give children like me
[1:41:24] something either they're too young for
[1:41:25] it or something's wrong with it
[1:41:27] amen I remember seeing some movies
[1:41:31] growing up and it terrified me and one
[1:41:34] was one was a book by Roald Dahl made as
[1:41:37] a movie
[1:41:38] who knows we're old dollars yeah
[1:41:41] terrified freaked me out
[1:41:44] well why cause it wasn't I won't go down
[1:41:48] that way but it wasn't normal and then
[1:41:51] nowadays they make it hyper realistic
[1:41:54] what's happening the imagine the dark
[1:41:57] and imagination of man is becoming flesh
[1:41:59] becoming material in front of us amen
[1:42:03] and if that's the case and the negative
[1:42:05] so much before the mind of God
[1:42:06] is becoming material is becoming flesh
[1:42:09] among us hallelujah you got to think
[1:42:13] about it and so it's even uncensored
[1:42:17] that they cursed God use God's name in
[1:42:19] vain and it used to be wrong for
[1:42:21] children and holiness churches to go to
[1:42:23] go to picture shows and now Satan got
[1:42:26] one jump ahead to bring it right into
[1:42:28] the house in the form of television and
[1:42:30] then uncensored and so forth and that
[1:42:32] Satan's way of gradually entering in you
[1:42:37] really got to pray over what you allow
[1:42:39] your children to look at yeah you say
[1:42:41] well it won't affect me and it may not
[1:42:43] but it affect them you'll see a hood you
[1:42:47] just take a natural you take like a herd
[1:42:49] of zebras or buffalo whatever it is
[1:42:52] wildebeest what do the Lions normally go
[1:42:55] for they go for the young or they go for
[1:42:58] the old
[1:42:59] right they got waste go cuz that's the
[1:43:02] week targets what a satan go for he'll
[1:43:05] go for the young always go for the young
[1:43:08] because the young are not emotionally
[1:43:11] spiritually strong enough or even a
[1:43:13] mostly to comprehend it what he's doing
[1:43:17] amen and he's like a lion walking about
[1:43:20] seeking whom he will do to devour so
[1:43:24] you've really got to think well this
[1:43:25] won't affect me and there may not but
[1:43:27] what's happening to little Johnny what's
[1:43:30] happening to Susie yes Amen because you
[1:43:34] can see something and it's so engrained
[1:43:36] into your mind that you can never forget
[1:43:39] it and it can just be a few seconds I
[1:43:42] wonder you think about this he says it's
[1:43:48] like the old toboggan slide used to be
[1:43:51] mean but we are a Holiness Church is
[1:43:53] that okay
[1:43:54] we are separated unto God hallelujah to
[1:43:56] the lamb I'm a king and priests to God
[1:43:59] but the blood has brought me in it's not
[1:44:02] a bunch of the house shall keep all
[1:44:03] there's no Lord you have separated me
[1:44:05] unto yourself hallelujah I'm glad I
[1:44:08] don't belong to the devil I'm glad I'm
[1:44:10] not his punching bag anymore
[1:44:12] Amen that's the way of Satan's way I've
[1:44:15] gradually come again like the old
[1:44:16] toboggan slide used to be many of you
[1:44:18] don't remember it because you're too
[1:44:19] young used to have entertainment for
[1:44:21] children you sit down on your toboggan
[1:44:23] and you must move around and around and
[1:44:25] there's a hole a chute and if I'm with
[1:44:27] dear one another would go closest to it
[1:44:29] and after a while before you knew down
[1:44:31] your wheat that's the way sinners don't
[1:44:33] travel with it don't see how close you
[1:44:35] can get to it see how far away you can
[1:44:38] stay away from it see
[1:44:39] I mean don't take no chance if you're
[1:44:42] going it's like if there's a bomb in
[1:44:44] this place would you want to go close to
[1:44:46] it and look at it pick it up see what's
[1:44:48] good you'd run of course you'd run that
[1:44:51] makes perfect sense but you take sin and
[1:44:56] oh look at it number closer come back
[1:45:00] and just maybe oh this is not doing me
[1:45:02] damn it boom
[1:45:04] where did he go I don't know a million
[1:45:07] pieces I'm not trying to make a joke
[1:45:10] this how people are well look at this
[1:45:13] I'll never succumb to that well why are
[1:45:14] you trying to expose yourself to it like
[1:45:16] this no water the nature is gonna be
[1:45:21] changed Fred Oh deliver me from this
[1:45:25] Lord I don't want to help me no it's
[1:45:28] your nature wants it but mentally you
[1:45:30] know it's wrong what about a new heart
[1:45:32] you know it's wrong then you won't even
[1:45:33] go near a man now don't see take no
[1:45:40] chance if you're going to take a chance
[1:45:42] I don't want no chance
[1:45:44] an old Scotsman one time said they're
[1:45:47] going to cross a mountain and carriages
[1:45:48] were waiting each man wanting to take
[1:45:50] him across he said I want the best teams
[1:45:52] to take me one of them said well I can
[1:45:54] drive my six head of horses at full
[1:45:57] gallop within 10 inches of that room
[1:45:59] around that mountain fall off it's death
[1:46:01] said I am said I'm a good enough team
[1:46:04] still I can drive my horses safely
[1:46:06] around within ten inches my wheels will
[1:46:09] not fall off maybe this is like how fast
[1:46:11] can you go to an echo tower a road right
[1:46:14] this is what basically saying how fast
[1:46:16] how fast can you get across because if
[1:46:20] you win over that side you're gone a lot
[1:46:22] of places right and the other said I can
[1:46:25] beat that I can drive within six inches
[1:46:27] or 4 inches never fall off and he said
[1:46:29] what about you sir he said well I don't
[1:46:31] know I don't like to do that I hug the
[1:46:34] bank he said you take me yes amen you
[1:46:37] take me that's right that's the one it
[1:46:40] isn't how close you can come and how
[1:46:42] well you think you're fortified stay
[1:46:44] just as far away from soon as you can
[1:46:46] stay just stay as far away as you can
[1:46:49] say I can do this there's no harm in
[1:46:51] doing this well if there's a question in
[1:46:53] your mind don't do it at all anywhere
[1:46:54] there's a question stay away from it
[1:46:56] then you see that you're absolutely
[1:46:58] living by faith if there's no question
[1:47:00] if there's a question then leave it
[1:47:02] don't go around it at all and I think
[1:47:04] that many times it's the parents that
[1:47:06] get away I know it is sometimes the
[1:47:09] schools and things Sunday school about
[1:47:11] half an hour an hour on a Sunday morning
[1:47:13] and the world has kids the rest of the
[1:47:15] weekend cram it into their more than a
[1:47:17] they're more than a teacher and many
[1:47:20] times too many times the teachers got a
[1:47:22] little cordially she teaches after while
[1:47:24] she paints her lips fixes her here and
[1:47:25] this the children do the best they can
[1:47:27] and then at home they get no Christian
[1:47:30] training at all mother's out somewhere
[1:47:32] to a card party days down the bowling
[1:47:34] alley and sisters out with somebody with
[1:47:37] a hot rod here you are see where did we
[1:47:39] go where did we go you just it's
[1:47:43] terrible and then we find out these
[1:47:45] these things together jr. beating up and
[1:47:48] down the road on his motorcycle at some
[1:47:50] of them down playing golf others playing
[1:47:52] pool and it's just something something
[1:47:55] another for entertainment and the
[1:47:57] churches let go what's happening
[1:47:59] influences government many times they
[1:48:03] get aboard their if the pasta would hit
[1:48:05] a little wire that's kind of little
[1:48:06] country say something about that board
[1:48:08] will have him up his name would go up to
[1:48:10] headquarters he be excommunicated you
[1:48:12] see it's a real meal ticket and instead
[1:48:14] of an anointed servant of God to preach
[1:48:15] the gospel that's right it becomes a
[1:48:17] thing that they wanted to meal ticket
[1:48:19] they got to stay there get good pay
[1:48:23] listen brother God have mercy upon a man
[1:48:25] that would sell his birthright for that
[1:48:27] we need a man who handle the gospel
[1:48:29] barehanded not with any kind of
[1:48:31] denominational glove or just lay it out
[1:48:33] in the way it is and let the chips fall
[1:48:35] where they want if the shoe fits mummy
[1:48:37] used to say wear it if it don't trim
[1:48:39] your corn now so we see these things
[1:48:43] that we ought to be listening to this
[1:48:45] King Uzziah being such a wonderful child
[1:48:48] he will had a godly father his mother
[1:48:50] came from Jerusalem and a godly father
[1:48:53] who was king before him and that kind of
[1:48:55] teaching melted into that boy right so
[1:48:59] it's not a it's not a surprise he turned
[1:49:04] out the way he did was that teaching
[1:49:06] melted into that boy he says I'm neither
[1:49:09] Democrat nor Republican I made one vote
[1:49:12] that was for Christ and I'm going to win
[1:49:14] on that now I think the greatest
[1:49:16] president though we ever had was Abraham
[1:49:19] Lincoln not because he was a Kentuckian
[1:49:21] too but because that the man came out
[1:49:24] from nothing and all the books the man
[1:49:26] ever owns from the time he was young
[1:49:28] until he was of age almost was the Bible
[1:49:30] and Bunyan's Pilgrim's Progress see that
[1:49:34] molded into him what that he was Honest
[1:49:37] Abe see what you read what you do mold
[1:49:41] your character amen it tells what you
[1:49:45] are and now we see he read where if you
[1:49:51] did wrong he paid for it if you did
[1:49:53] right God would honor it and that molded
[1:49:55] what he was and his mother was a godly
[1:49:58] woman too he said if there's any credit
[1:50:00] given anybody it was a godly mother that
[1:50:03] raised him right
[1:50:03] now it's made I think I'd say at least
[1:50:06] one if not the greatest president we
[1:50:08] ever had he came up from nothing and God
[1:50:10] made him president because he was an
[1:50:12] honest man
[1:50:12] and he was a good man and we and we and
[1:50:15] we know from history when he came off
[1:50:17] the ship there and one of the southern
[1:50:19] states and he saw a slave market and and
[1:50:21] people being sold as slaves something
[1:50:24] struck him saying I'll hit that thing
[1:50:25] even if it costs my life I mean and we
[1:50:28] know that it ultimately cost his life
[1:50:29] because he was assassinated I mean but
[1:50:32] but his character
[1:50:33] it was molded into him in such a way
[1:50:35] that when he saw men and men and women
[1:50:37] and slavery being sold as just like
[1:50:39] cattle something's trying to say I'm
[1:50:41] gonna put it into this a mint and it
[1:50:44] should be the same thing with you and I
[1:50:45] I mean when we see sin rampaging on
[1:50:48] every hand I mean we should bail the
[1:50:51] seat is a greater way then but we should
[1:50:53] be we should just be against things
[1:50:55] remember the gospel is for where to
[1:50:58] earnestly contend for the faith that was
[1:51:00] once given to the Saints I mean so we
[1:51:02] should be for the Lord Jesus Christ we
[1:51:05] should be for holiness we should be for
[1:51:07] pure lives under fire before yo you know
[1:51:10] before the Lord we should before the
[1:51:12] Holy Spirit moving we should before
[1:51:13] people being birthed into the kingdom
[1:51:16] and then we should be for joy and
[1:51:18] speakable and full of glory amen we
[1:51:20] should be for perfect peace ain't with
[1:51:22] me I mean with me we should be for God
[1:51:25] coming down and visiting us wherever we
[1:51:26] are we should be for those things not
[1:51:29] just against things and those are the
[1:51:32] things I'm contending for I am for our
[1:51:35] people being molded into His image
[1:51:37] Alleluia but that was the influence upon
[1:51:41] his life those two books
[1:51:42] Maldon ermine - what he was allelujah
[1:51:47] you say well that's not too great these
[1:51:50] kinds of days I'd say it doesn't matter
[1:51:53] what form it comes in I wanted an HD 3d
[1:51:58] virtual reality and then I'll do it
[1:52:01] no I'd forget about that I'd say give me
[1:52:05] this give me the Word of God give me
[1:52:09] living testimonies what do you want to
[1:52:12] mold you what do you want to be well I
[1:52:16] want to be an astronaut one day well
[1:52:18] forget about that what do you want to be
[1:52:22] as a person because ultimately what
[1:52:25] defines us is not our job what defines
[1:52:28] us is our character I mean that's what
[1:52:31] we'll be remembered for is a life that
[1:52:33] we left so what do you want to mold you
[1:52:39] now the attitude of the parents as
[1:52:43] amplified as I said in the very
[1:52:45] beginning what our parents what our
[1:52:48] children pick up from others what our
[1:52:50] children pick up from us is more the
[1:52:54] what we do not say but what we do the
[1:52:56] more them all then what we say right and
[1:52:59] so the attitude of the parents is
[1:53:03] amplified or magnified in the children
[1:53:07] you can see this in you know with with
[1:53:11] Elijah or Elijah whether we're 42
[1:53:16] children came out made fun of him go up
[1:53:18] bald head go up and those and the
[1:53:23] Prophet and anger curse those children
[1:53:27] and to two she bears came out and killed
[1:53:29] them but where did they get that
[1:53:31] attitude from by the Ramseys at one
[1:53:33] place maybe the parents did that at home
[1:53:35] so it's just even just a saying there in
[1:53:38] the home it became their whole attitude
[1:53:42] so that's what molded them to go out and
[1:53:46] say that I'll be done soon
[1:53:49] maybe I won this up actually he says now
[1:53:53] so the attitude of the parents
[1:53:56] towards our Lord Jesus Christ his word
[1:53:58] will be passed down and that is the
[1:54:01] adage because it's all about our
[1:54:02] attitude and approach is the most
[1:54:05] important thing so if we are indifferent
[1:54:07] if we are indifferent towards God I'm
[1:54:10] just going the negative way if we are
[1:54:12] indifferent towards God again you're
[1:54:14] about as word odd doesn't matter I you
[1:54:16] know God just loves us I can do whatever
[1:54:18] we want it's not that important you know
[1:54:21] that will be passed down to the children
[1:54:22] right in a greater way but then if we
[1:54:26] reverence him if we love him if we you
[1:54:32] know if we have the right mental
[1:54:34] attitude God is always right he is
[1:54:36] always in control turn to him first
[1:54:39] let's pray about this let's seek his
[1:54:42] mind about this we love him he's so
[1:54:44] wonderful to us thank you for a glorious
[1:54:47] thank you for another wonderful day Lord
[1:54:49] praise your great name you're so good to
[1:54:51] us thank you we have life from these
[1:54:53] bodies to praise you amen you know if
[1:54:55] you have that kind of attitude Lord your
[1:54:57] word is so pure Amen it's the most
[1:54:59] valuable thing women we're the most
[1:55:01] blessed people at all the earth because
[1:55:03] we walk with the true and living God
[1:55:05] that'll be in them amen brother ham says
[1:55:11] and expectations he says is a few places
[1:55:13] maybe I'll just read this one an
[1:55:14] unchangeable God working in an
[1:55:16] unexpected way 1962 why the right mental
[1:55:20] attitude towards any divine promise of
[1:55:21] God will bring it to pass and feel just
[1:55:24] look at it and take care of the word
[1:55:26] just right because the infinite god
[1:55:28] spoke it god's word jesus said heaven
[1:55:30] and earth will pass away but my words
[1:55:32] will never pass away oh how we ought to
[1:55:35] rest upon that divine promise of the Son
[1:55:37] of God who said both heavens and earth
[1:55:39] will pass away but my words shall never
[1:55:41] pass away there is a resting place for
[1:55:44] the soul now jesus said in the word
[1:55:46] jesus said if you ask the father
[1:55:48] anything of my name I'll do it but
[1:55:50] sometimes when God performs something
[1:55:51] does something what we asked yet we yet
[1:55:54] we don't it comes in an unexpected way
[1:55:56] and sometimes in an unexpected place and
[1:55:58] at an unexpected time but God will
[1:56:00] answer in his own way if you'll just
[1:56:02] believe it see you must believe it
[1:56:04] accept it then don't take it back hold
[1:56:07] on to it lay hold of it and say this is
[1:56:10] it
[1:56:10] God see that that settles it if God said
[1:56:12] so it's finished no matter how long we
[1:56:15] should instill that into our children
[1:56:18] God is always right he's always in
[1:56:21] control
[1:56:22] amen his promises are true and though it
[1:56:25] may tarry it will not it will come and
[1:56:28] he will guide our steps he is our
[1:56:31] Shepherd he's leading us through good
[1:56:34] times and bad times I meant you know
[1:56:42] brother Barrett now I'm sorry that it's
[1:56:44] running late but brother Brad speaks a
[1:56:46] lot about home life and home life is
[1:56:51] more than at his home life is not having
[1:56:54] the nicest house on the nicest Street
[1:56:56] with the nicest everything that is not
[1:56:59] home life home life is talking about
[1:57:02] family the family unit and the culture
[1:57:06] and the you know I'd say there's a
[1:57:08] culture a good culture is a good thing
[1:57:11] amen
[1:57:12] a good way of life there there was a
[1:57:14] good way to live and he talks about home
[1:57:17] life and he says in some places how home
[1:57:21] life is now running into shallow water
[1:57:23] so it's coming to an end
[1:57:25] right but if home life is strong then
[1:57:29] the family will move with the Lord and
[1:57:32] that's what we want right so now he
[1:57:41] speaks no I just read a couple of these
[1:57:43] I'll just jump a few things down you see
[1:57:46] he says and meanest man and this isn't
[1:57:48] Santa Maria
[1:57:51] he said now I want to tell you something
[1:57:54] about Sunday School it's absolutely
[1:57:55] wrong to send your children to Sunday
[1:57:57] School you know that take them take them
[1:58:00] to Sunday school I say God bless you all
[1:58:01] for taking your children Sunday school
[1:58:03] because you go with them right now
[1:58:07] seen a little cartoon in the paper not
[1:58:10] long ago was amazing a little boy came
[1:58:12] to the door he showed his mother in his
[1:58:13] father's bedroom bottles laying on the
[1:58:15] floor cigarette pieces and everything in
[1:58:17] his way up and the day 9 o'clock and the
[1:58:20] little boy had dawn got up washed
[1:58:21] himself combed his hair put on his
[1:58:23] clothes
[1:58:24] knocked on the door said hey who's going
[1:58:25] to take me to Sunday school there you
[1:58:27] are that's just the way the American
[1:58:28] trend of it is isn't it awful
[1:58:30] I think the modern American people now
[1:58:32] this is the same this is a problem with
[1:58:33] the West remember we have too much we
[1:58:36] have too much we are always connected we
[1:58:39] have to be always connected apparently I
[1:58:41] mean your boys got to have your phone on
[1:58:43] you apparently it's got to be charged
[1:58:46] you got to have Wi-Fi you've got to have
[1:58:48] data if you do not have data or or
[1:58:51] anyway if it's just that I don't have it
[1:58:53] here but if it's just something that's
[1:58:55] out of battery and you can't connect the
[1:58:57] world it's bad who says it's bad but
[1:59:02] this is this is this is the culture of
[1:59:04] the Western world now you got to be
[1:59:06] connected you got to see what's going on
[1:59:08] on Facebook what's going on on whatsapp
[1:59:11] maybe if you do Twitter or whatever else
[1:59:13] that goes on you know it's got to be
[1:59:15] you've got to be in tune with what's
[1:59:17] going on there do you do you really what
[1:59:23] did we do before we had smartphones did
[1:59:27] we exist that we survived that the world
[1:59:30] keep going
[1:59:31] what did we do before cellphones that
[1:59:33] the world go on was it all okay did we
[1:59:36] survive what did we do before the
[1:59:39] internet Oh amen what do you mean you
[1:59:45] got a heavens in it who says you got to
[1:59:47] heaven to live but you see all these
[1:59:50] things because I read this and say well
[1:59:52] as about mum and dad being you know
[1:59:53] having beer bottles stuff in their room
[1:59:54] and cigarettes and stuff but it's but
[1:59:58] it's more than that now you say well my
[2:00:00] parents don't drink or smoke or whatever
[2:00:02] more yeah but we can be caught up in
[2:00:04] this digital world leave me sir and
[2:00:07] what's the first thing that goes so
[2:00:10] brother Bram says the most powerful
[2:00:12] weapon that God has placed in the hands
[2:00:15] of man is prayer prayer changes things
[2:00:18] amen prayer changes the mind of God
[2:00:21] sometimes that's in the scripture I mean
[2:00:24] was it his a car you saw I think he's a
[2:00:26] car he was sick to death Isaiah comes
[2:00:29] and thus saith the Lord you're gonna die
[2:00:30] set your house in order you gonna die
[2:00:32] and he turns to the wall he prays Lord
[2:00:35] I've lived with the right heart before
[2:00:37] you give me more
[2:00:38] time and then Isaiah's back at his house
[2:00:41] God speaks to him go tell the king he's
[2:00:43] got 15 more years turns his heart maybe
[2:00:47] an Abraham saying their book yeah before
[2:00:48] Sodom and Gomorrah is gonna be Bernie
[2:00:50] talks to God but what have you finding
[2:00:52] 50 will he spirit yes I will what if he
[2:00:56] find 40 he keeps going down and down and
[2:00:58] down what he's tried turning changed the
[2:01:00] mind of God
[2:01:01] Moses are standing there God says I'm
[2:01:03] gonna wipe out these people I'm gonna
[2:01:05] start with you yeah he stands in the
[2:01:07] breach hallelujah changes God's mind
[2:01:10] think about it
[2:01:13] hallelujah it's the most powerful weapon
[2:01:16] all of the nuclear arsenal in the world
[2:01:18] is nothing compared to a believer with
[2:01:20] free amen it is nothing that is not it's
[2:01:23] not even on the same scale it's the most
[2:01:27] powerful but what is the thing that
[2:01:28] always goes first in a Christian walk
[2:01:31] prayer why is it well I've got to check
[2:01:35] this and I've got to check this email
[2:01:36] I've got to respond to this person this
[2:01:38] person this person this person I've got
[2:01:40] to do this and this and this and you've
[2:01:41] got your whole other things you're gonna
[2:01:42] take care of in life oh now it's about
[2:01:44] 1:30 in the morning our need to sleep
[2:01:47] well did you need to do all those things
[2:01:50] but they're expecting an answer
[2:01:52] are they what if you don't answer them
[2:01:55] or the world description and break but I
[2:01:59] have to do you know I'm not trying to
[2:02:03] sound ridiculous but you got to think
[2:02:04] about it I have to get back to this
[2:02:06] person really you know sometimes I long
[2:02:10] for the days wouldn't it be nice you
[2:02:12] just send a letter I want here I won't
[2:02:16] hear from them for about a year maybe

[2:06:01] if you're in there who's in that place
[2:06:02] of safety I mean I heard letting off the
[2:06:05] pressure I was walking through pyro mall
[2:06:07] this week and just thinking about
[2:06:10] letting off the pressure and brother
[2:06:11] Brown says in one of those zippers he
[2:06:13] says he says you're in the house you're
[2:06:15] in the City of Refuge what are you
[2:06:17] worrying about brother let off the
[2:06:18] pressure
[2:06:19] I mean just let off the pressure I mean
[2:06:22] if you're in Christ let off the pressure
[2:06:24] hallelujah this world wants to push this
[2:06:26] down pushes down please just let off the
[2:06:28] pressure hallelujah
[2:06:30] and I'll just have me glorious time
[2:06:32] going down the escalator holes the holes
[2:06:34] and shouting but in my heart I'm so
[2:06:35] happy
[2:06:36] hallelujah I'm in the City of Refuge
[2:06:39] I'll say god you're so good amen so
[2:06:44] what's getting in your way I have to
[2:06:46] check Facebook do you I've got to go on
[2:06:49] whatsapp do you really need to respond
[2:06:51] to that right now
[2:06:53] what should our priority be amen you
[2:06:59] know what about our children yo because
[2:07:01] remember if you've got a good home life
[2:07:03] where this is center it doesn't mean you
[2:07:06] always have to sit down and read it you
[2:07:07] can talk about them
[2:07:09] you know you can just spend time with
[2:07:11] your kids talk about how great the
[2:07:12] laughter's spend some time with them you
[2:07:15] want them you want I trust is what you
[2:07:19] want you want God through you to be
[2:07:21] their greatest influence is that what
[2:07:24] you want
[2:07:25] amen so then you've got to say Lord
[2:07:27] changed my daily life that that is so
[2:07:31] because we can't just expect this and
[2:07:33] then they're overcoming mature believers
[2:07:36] it takes little step by step you take
[2:07:39] someone who's a surgeon someone training
[2:07:42] to be a surgeon you would never trust
[2:07:45] them doing a brain operation on you if
[2:07:47] they just oh here's the manual how to do
[2:07:49] a surgery and then now you go do it you
[2:07:52] wouldn't trust someone like that but so
[2:07:54] because these hands which to begin with
[2:07:57] would kill a person they'd do the most
[2:08:00] incredible surgery the same hands for
[2:08:03] the knee training and if we look into
[2:08:05] medical manuals and read things and
[2:08:09] absorb things and study things and then
[2:08:12] a few years and do some and have some
[2:08:14] practical lessons and surgery and then a
[2:08:17] few years down the road they've got a
[2:08:19] top of a scale off someone and they're
[2:08:21] doing all kinds of things the same hands
[2:08:23] and it's got to be the same thing with
[2:08:25] us are you with me you understand what
[2:08:29] I'm saying could be the same thing now
[2:08:30] we have a manual amen and we want to get
[2:08:35] that little by little Jesus loves us
[2:08:38] isn't he good actually Frank you just
[2:08:41] think of how great let's sing a song you
[2:08:42] know what we do at home a lot well I try
[2:08:45] and do it we put on some music off him
[2:08:46] from here and we'll dance around amen it
[2:08:51] creates an atmosphere I mean we had
[2:08:54] there was one of them was going through
[2:08:56] something from preschool as a spiritual
[2:08:58] thing
[2:08:59] put on some put on some music this is a
[2:09:01] few years ago now we just started
[2:09:03] dancing around just like that it was
[2:09:05] gone
[2:09:06] you can ask my wife about it amen
[2:09:10] hallelujah God works in different ways
[2:09:12] but if we just win or do you start
[2:09:15] clashing and fighting and dududuu sorted
[2:09:17] out sorted out you know it wouldn't work
[2:09:19] but if you cried an atmosphere now
[2:09:21] have a relationship hallelujah music is
[2:09:26] important I need some musicians come
[2:09:28] otherwise they'll stand here too long
[2:09:31] music is very important you say well
[2:09:35] we're not a musical family you can still
[2:09:37] fill your house with the right music I
[2:09:40] mean you'll be amazed with what it does
[2:09:45] hallelujah so I wanna you say well you
[2:09:52] out you just throw out a lot of
[2:09:53] questions I wanted to I wouldn't you
[2:09:57] think about it what is your home life
[2:10:00] like is it just busy and everyone's
[2:10:05] doing their own thing are you about well
[2:10:08] I guess the average family is four or
[2:10:10] five in this place ie just five
[2:10:12] individuals just doing your own thing or
[2:10:15] your family Union amen you say well I
[2:10:19] need to have some me time okay why don't
[2:10:23] you drag your kids into your me time
[2:10:27] drag your spouse into your me time I do
[2:10:30] you oh but I need to no no try it
[2:10:37] amen remember if you do the same thing
[2:10:42] you'll get the same results okay let's
[2:10:45] not sit back and say well everything's
[2:10:47] all cruzi sweet as we have to withstand
[2:10:50] that thing we're to press the mark of
[2:10:53] the hike or you say you you know you
[2:10:55] look at people who are raised in church
[2:10:57] and they become thank you they meet the
[2:10:59] Lord they become example believers nine
[2:11:02] times out of 10 it was the influence of
[2:11:05] the parents in the right way not a
[2:11:07] training started spending time created a
[2:11:11] culture because now remember we've come
[2:11:13] out of the world many of us we've come
[2:11:15] out of denomination and now it's the
[2:11:17] next generation we can't just float
[2:11:20] along and expect that our kids with God
[2:11:24] will get a hold of them just like magic
[2:11:26] I'm sorry use the word but you know we
[2:11:28] can't just expect you know because it's
[2:11:30] like an Israel's day God told them if
[2:11:33] you cleave completely
[2:11:35] me you'll possess the land and you'll
[2:11:38] drive out the enemy so when they did
[2:11:40] that it wasn't shouldn't have been a
[2:11:41] surprise to them well how did this
[2:11:43] happen well God actually said if you
[2:11:45] your whole heart is with me all of your
[2:11:47] affections everything you are thou shalt
[2:11:49] love the Lord thy God with all thy soul
[2:11:51] mind and strength and love thy neighbour
[2:11:53] as thyself other two greatest
[2:11:55] Commandments a meant so it wasn't a
[2:11:58] surprise when they drove out the enemy
[2:12:00] if they did those things so it should be
[2:12:02] the same thing with us now we we have to
[2:12:05] our biggest goal should be Lord I want
[2:12:08] an environment of the Holy Ghost in my
[2:12:10] life that my children will drop into and
[2:12:13] eventually one day amen and when they do
[2:12:16] it should just be a surprise
[2:12:19] waxey we've been praying for this we've
[2:12:21] been every day Lord because remember you
[2:12:24] got to say God catch my family catch my
[2:12:26] children emfluence them Lord hallelujah
[2:12:29] and then top of tombi well here you are
[2:12:31] Here I am send me Isaiah you know he
[2:12:34] didn't say our Lord yields you know when
[2:12:36] the crowd for who go for us he didn't
[2:12:39] say well God you'll take care of it
[2:12:40] somebody says here I am Lord send me
[2:12:44] amen they stand shall we I want you to
[2:12:49] think about say well we're pressing in
[2:12:54] we're gonna you know don't keep pressing
[2:12:57] in don't don't sit back and say well no
[2:13:01] everything's fine we can't sit back and
[2:13:02] watch the world go by
[2:13:05] Amen we cannot you we cannot do that in
[2:13:08] this day and age we should be lord I
[2:13:10] want to press the battle I want my
[2:13:14] family to be in an atmosphere you say
[2:13:15] well they might not accept it but
[2:13:17] they'll know it's real amen
[2:13:20] it is up to them because remember every
[2:13:22] child every man woman and child that
[2:13:24] comes across God you cannot get in by
[2:13:26] your by knowing someone else who knows
[2:13:28] him you've got to know him yourself but
[2:13:31] at least create an atmosphere where your
[2:13:32] children will know this is how a daddy
[2:13:34] should be this is how a father should be
[2:13:37] and our God is real and he's the true
[2:13:40] and living God and he changed me he
[2:13:42] changed mummy he'll change you because a
[2:13:45] lot of people have walked away previous
[2:13:47] generations but they all
[2:13:48] oh this is the truth amen so we need to
[2:13:53] create an atmosphere where people know
[2:13:56] this is real it's not out of rules we
[2:13:59] love Him amen
[2:14:03] it's just I want to sing um I really
[2:14:08] want to sing I'm a king a priest to God
[2:14:11] hallelujah to the lamb I mean by the
[2:14:13] cleansing of the blood I wanna know it's
[2:14:15] a fast song I know maybe there's a bit
[2:14:17] of a let's just worship the Lord a
[2:14:18] little bit shall we
[2:14:19] you say well it's been a bit heavy well
[2:14:22] sometimes we go down these kind of ways
[2:14:24] I mean but just I trust we like Paul at
[2:14:28] the end of the road we say I was not
[2:14:29] disobedient to the heavenly vision so
[2:14:32] what I was called to be I was not
[2:14:34] disobedient to it amen
[2:14:36] in the King David so I'm just gonna
[2:14:38] throw this and King David was
[2:14:40] established as king and then he came to
[2:14:42] a position he says I don't need to go
[2:14:44] fight no more I don't need to go pray no
[2:14:47] more I don't need to go out no more he
[2:14:49] stayed in Jerusalem and then that was
[2:14:51] the time when he looked out or he's on
[2:14:53] his palace roof or whatever it was he
[2:14:54] saw Bathsheba so was when he was
[2:14:57] established in this kingdom then he let
[2:15:00] down the guard a little but now I can
[2:15:02] rest and same thing with us we can't get
[2:15:05] into spot we say I won't go free I don't
[2:15:08] need to go pray no more everything's
[2:15:10] fine you know don't sit back push on
[2:15:12] that's the time when we should really be
[2:15:14] pushing on and Nate the Prophet Nathan
[2:15:17] told David because he done this the
[2:15:19] sword will not leave your house amen
[2:15:22] there's Epsilon all those things happen
[2:15:24] let's not sit back you say well the king
[2:15:27] knows Venus I'll put it in old language
[2:15:29] the kingdom has been established
[2:15:30] everything's fine where our people don't
[2:15:32] sit back brace the battle I mean
[2:15:38] I've leave I am
