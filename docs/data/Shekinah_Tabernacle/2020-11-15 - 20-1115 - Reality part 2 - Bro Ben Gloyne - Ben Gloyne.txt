to have uh sister Rachel here too God bless you I think she's in the back but praise the Lord amen let's um so we're in Genesis 28 and um we're going to read from verse 11 and he is everyone everyone there everyone feeling good praise the Lord and He lighted upon a certain place this is this is Jacob running and carried there all night because the sun was set and he took off the stones of that place and put them for his pillows and laid down in that place to sleep I'm sorry brother AR you turn me down a it and he dreamed and behold a ladder set up on the earth and the top of it reached to heaven and behold the angel of God ascending and descending on it and behold the Lord stood above it and said I am the Lord God of Abraham thy father and the god of Isaac the land when thou liest to thee will I give it and to thy seed and thy seed shall be of as the dust of the earth and thou shalt spread abroad to the west and to the East and to the north and to the South and in thee and in thy seed shall all the families of the earth be blessed and behold I am with thee and will keep thee in all places where thou go us I mean what a promise and we'll bring thee again into this land for I will not leave thee until I have done that which I have spoken to thee of we're going in a Rapture amen and Jacob awakened out of his sleep and said surely the Lord is in this place and I knew it not and he was afraid and said how Dreadful is this place this is none other but the house of God and this is the Gate of Heaven and Jacob Arose up early in the morning and took the stone that he had put for his pillows and set it up for a pillar and poured oil upon the top of it and now we're just going to go to the Book of Mark in Chapter 13 is my um slideshow there just just means that um the brothers in the back going have to do a lot of work um here we are so this is Jesus going out of the temple and they've just looked at the temple they've looked at the buildings and and notice the disciples they they begin to comment on them and as he went out of the temple one of his disciples saith unto him Master see what manner of stones and what buildings are here and Jesus answering said unto him see as thou these great buildings there shall not be left one stone upon another that shall not be thrown down amen let's bow our heads in a word of prayer this morning if you have a need you want to slip your hand up to the Lord You Want To Be Remembered in prayer great prous father you see all the hands that have been raised to you Lord Jesus not to me but to you dear God and you see the the needs and the burdens Lord and maybe the questions father that are behind those hands raised up and Lord we just want to invite you to come here once again my Lord father may you just move in our midst once again dear God I just want to pray father You' anoint your word to our souls Lord Jesus Lord it is like Honey in the Rock oh God it's so precious and wonderful Lord and I just pray you'd Feed Us Lord this morning from your hand and dear God I just pray you wouldd have preeminence in this service Lord Jesus may it not be a battle against the enemy but may it just be a Victorious Feast

amen more importantly Lord father fill us that already have your spirit and those who aren't sealed in Lord seal them in Father Lord may they know who their real father is oh God may you grant it for your glory Lord we commit the service into your hands in Jesus Christ's name amen amen God bless you friends you may have your seats this morning amen so I want to continue on just maybe a different kind of angle from from last Sunday speaking about reality and so Jacob Jacob was was on the run from his from from his brother and and you know we know the story he came to this place he called it bethl which is the you know the house of God and and and he would he would take these stones and he would he would bring them together and he would you know lay upon them and then when the Lord came down he anointed that place now we know that we are more than just natural stones now I'm going to skip a through bit through this but you know we are more than just natural stones the anointing has touched different things down through the Scripture it began the first time that the word anointed this or anointing is ever um U mentioned in the scripture is when God tells Jacob to return to bethl and and he says go to that place that you anointed that pillar so the anointing rested upon a stone and then it moved and then it went upon a priesthood and the Tabernacle right and then it went to the holy of holies and it would fall on prophets but that was never God's original your resting place God's anointing his presence was to dwell in the hearts of human beings and so when we see this where where the disciples would come and they would see the great buildings you know they would see the temple and and um I don't think there was another building like it in all of Jerusalem sure there were palaces there were the Great Walls and things of Jerusalem great places but the temple was a special place and they were so amazed at the at the masonry the gold and the different things that were there they would say to the say to the master who ordained the temple to be built in the first place but now had become flesh what manner of stones are here and what buildings are here you know in other words this is incredible place look at the masonry look how it's built you know look at this and Jesus was really what he was doing is we know he is the Master Mason he is the master builder and he would he was actually Gathering Living Stones he wasn't interested no more to be behind Badger skins in a temple he was not he wasn't interested in dwelling in a a building made by man's hands this was never his father resting place but his final resting place was to be the soul of human beings so Jesus was basically saying these these great buildings they're going to be torn down but I'm in the process of building a greater building which is my body upon the Earth and this is a far more important building than a natural building you know where where Jacob would would would would rest here God came down there was a ladder that hitched tried to Hitch to the Earth but it couldn't hitch on Jacob he was an unstable unconverted man the only place you could hit your rest was finally on Jesus Christ and brother Bram says that that ladder is in glory it anchored down into Christ and when Christ anchors into you then you can go up the ladder into Glory I mean but now there was a portal opened in heaven where Heaven could come down upon the Earth where before it wasn't of this way but here was a man and he he was seeing Angels going up and going down and he saw the Lord Of Glory at the top what an incredible place to be in now you've got to take this and remember we are actually in that same position Where Angels come down and they visit us amen the Lord comes down and he visits us Heaven comes down but now it's not just a place where people Marvel Now the the people at the bottom of the ladder are a channel for God to operate through to manifest his word through Hallelujah and here we are upon the earth now brother Brown makes a statement in the token I don't have it up here but he says you know it's time basically to quit talking about the message and get under the message right we've been talking about the message keeping the lamb up long enough as now it's time to get under the message and the message is Christ so now now to me now we're living in a season far beyond trying to work out what the message says we know what it says the books come open right the Mysteries are revealed amen so now it's time for that word that book to put on flesh right and manifest itself through a people amen this is this is why we're here is it not Hallelujah so now brother Braham would say and I'll I'll I'll come back to you know as I my disclaimer as I jump around a lot with with slides he says I've just got through this morning bringing the message of a paradox a paradox is something that it's unreasonable but it it's really incredible says Webster but it's true something that's incredible you can't understand it it's just a mystery Jesus did the works of his father because the father was in him that is why the works was done because that the father was in the son do you believe that amen amen that that in him he was the Incarnate God do you believe that that God the Father which is the father of Jesus Christ the great spirit dwelt in the fullness of his power in Jesus Christ which was the Tabernacle of God made flesh and dwelt on the earth representing the word Jesus was the word the Bible said so St John the first chapter and the Word was invisible now listen close the word was invisible until it was made flesh and then the word became visible and through his sacrificial death at Calvary and his resurrection positionally places Church in that realm which is Heavenly places that same invisible God could come into an individual and make the word visible Hallelujah there no longer invisible God where are you know he's put on flesh he's visible in his people oh my I wish my church could get that and I say Amen if we could see friends the invisible God made visible that's why we got to be able to discern the Lord's body see the word and flesh in one another beyond our Humanity beyond our faults but see the word amen see an attribute of God and flesh that's what we must be able to see I've often wanted to come into the church I've longed to see it I guess where I could walk in the back door front door wherever it was look across an audience and see a perfect Church all in order sin couldn't stay there no the spirit called out you see it just couldn't stay this is this is what I want to see a place where sin can't dwell it can't hide behind any agenda or any false motive any Veil but sin can't dwell Hallelujah and I pray that it would actually come to a place where the reason people stay away from churches they're not willing to make it right and they're scared that if they come in they'll get called out amen shouldn't it be that way like ananas and Safar you just couldn't do it there'll be no sin in that group no sir see the Holy Spirit quickly speak it out like that no matter what it was how little it would be done see men and wom women and men sitting there under the power of the Holy Spirit the spirit of God moving perfectly moving this someone had done something wrong in the congregation they come quickly confess it before them the spirit got a hold of it to confess it both they come tell it cuz they know right then it's going to be called that's right that's the Church of the Living God how am I all poor old heart now it's getting old how I've longed to stand and see a church like that I may yet I hope to perfect works of God without sin now it could understand now I want to stop right there that's not having some kind of Concrete Hard Church order that's not what this is talking about this is talking about Sin in the individual this is talking about malicious demon powers moving and people allowing them to to to to have leverage this is what this is talking about this not people having faults and failures you following me it's not just oh we got to have no no this is not what this is talking about this is allowing the Devil to have a grip in someone's life and people not willing to get rid of it I think there was I can't remember I think it was brother Brian Freeborn I might get it wrong but he used to go to prayer meetings and the people would get their lives right before they went to the prayer meeting cuz God would come down and call out something that's wrong in their lives Hallelujah God you know we can't hide nothing I think I think we need to come to just the conclusion Lord you know everything about me and the reason he wants to deal with sin in your life is he doesn't want you to be dragged by that thing down and be lost that's the reason he's not trying to point out oh you're bad and you're NY and this and this is not what this is about this I want my children free I want them to SAR in the Heavenly I want them to recognize the devil has no part in them they have no part of him they never belong to him they never were part of him at all and there's just a separation between God's children and the devil that's why hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah thank you Lord Jes hey we're not our own we're bought with a price and the devil don't share I mean sorry well the devil wants to share us with God but God doesn't want to share us with the devil amen never never now here stands a group of people to be prayed for now we realize if the scripture is true and the god of Heaven could just create a squirrel and create a ram could stop the Sun for a whole day 24 hours that could keep fire from burning people in a furnace for 3 hours he could stop the mouth of lion that could raise the dead could walk on water could take biscuits and feed 5,000 that's God that's the word made flesh in human beings how does everybody now does anyone understand that now the same God promised that in the last days these things would reoccur again but he can't do it until there is somebody he can work with work them with then work on you see what I mean now let's believe that emphatically with all of our heart that it's going to be that way oh Lord Jesus make me a Clear Channel your blood will do it your spirit will do it it's not me trying to seven steps to manifest the third pole no no no no it's God manifesting the third pole in our lives but Lord I'm Available I Am Here I Am Lord pour it in amen not for my glory but for yours Hallelujah we are the bride is not just a church body we are not just a church body brother R says in Christ the mystery God revealed he says that to convert people to Christianity and its government was never the program of God what does that mean people just become church members that's never the program of God God's program is God would come and fill them with himself and manifest himself through a people amen amen now so be you have tasted that the Lord is gracious to whom coming unto a living Stone disallowed indeed of men but chosen of God and precious ye also as Lively Stones who's a living Stone I'm not a dead piece of masonry I'm a living Stone Hallelujah by a living God that's living in me I built up a spiritual house a holy priesthood to offer up spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God by Jesus Christ wherefore also it is contained in the scripture behold I lay in Zion a Chief Cornerstone elect and precious and he that believeth on him shall never be confounded Hallelujah until I mean unto you therefore which believe he is precious but unto them which be disobedient the stone which the builders dis loud the same as made the head of the corner and a stone of stumbling and a rock of offense even to them which stumble at the word being a disobedient run to also they were appointed but ye are a chosen generation hello chosen generation a royal priesthood and a holy nation A peculiar people that you should show forth the Praises of him who ha called you out of Darkness Into His Marvelous Light which in times past were not a people but are now people of God now the people of God which had not obtained Mercy but now have obtained Mercy Hallelujah you know what I love about the scripture you read in the Old Testament where where God would instruct God would instruct his people when they build an altar of stone don't use any tools on that stone all right all right man-made tools are not allowed to shape the stones that build the altar it has to be just as you find it put it as the Altar and God is is is well to me he's telling us there it's not man's ability that will shape the stones to make the altar remember what goes on an altar a sacrifice and what comes down on the sacrifice fire hallelujah it's a place of worship amen as as as the bride is so it's not man's doing that is going to get us ready for the for the Rapture right man is not going to ad Ministry human ability a Hu you know I could stand here and I could try and shape you into the image that I see fit I could many people have tried that and it's just man controlling man it's just another denomination but if it's a spirit of God doing it Hallelujah because that's what we want don't we we want God to take his word and mold us and shape us into his image that's not man-made tools shaping of someone amen you know the bride is more Val you're more valuable than your realize hey God you know people have tried to manhandle the bride in the past God just pushed them to one side he won't have anyone meddling with his woman Lord amen now you're following me so far let's not be too clamped down and stressed about it okay let's relax you know I've caught seven rats since I got my trap and a mouse the first one was a mouse Hallelujah but I tell the girls you're the next one catches the devil I want to get him in a trap that's what I want to do don't you want to catch the devil throw him in the rubbish thanks you know that's what we're here for you know this is a trap the devil come to the wrong place amen he's come to the wrong Place Hallelujah now you believe we can be a church that the devil can't dwell the devil should get very uncomfortable when he walks in this door he should get very uncomfortable when he walks into your house he should get very uncomfortable when he tries to walk into your life he should actually be you know there should be they should be fighting the devil should be fighting each other in hell when Satan orders one of them okay you go deal with that guy or you go deal with that girl and they'll no not me and they'll try and push someone no I got beaten up last time I'm not going up there I'm not trying to take them out Hallelujah that's how it should be right amen we should have such a life like that now this is this is a different quote where I was talking about last Sunday about how there was um uh mom and dad and their and their boy was on death's door brother BR came and prayed the prayer of faith and you know you know the nurse was all upset because the parents were rejoicing and the um you know but but physically uh the boy was still basically on death St but their reality was that God had healed them uh um um healed them and and they weren't looking at the things that are seen he says and that old man never forget he put his hand upon the shoulder of that little young lady probably in her late teens that's the nurse said sister dear you're looking at that machine that's all you got to look at but I'm looking at a Divine promise amen the next morning the boy took his breakfast and he's married and got a child now see the woman all she knew was just to do what the machine said but this old man looked Faith pissed beyond that and he and he saw God who was able to do exceedingly abundantly uh The God Who had promised never to fail us or to leave us or forsake us he it depends what you're looking at the Christian looks at things they don't see because they walk in faith is that right we believe it because the Bible said so they believe it uh that's how we believe is because God said so Faith tested tried it proves out 100% God's obligated to answer that Faith so if God gives you a revelation of something he's obligated to manifest that that Revelation right cuz Faith is a revelation he says the Christian looks at things they don't see because they walk by faith is that right we believe it because the Bible said so they believed it that's how we Believers because God said so Faith tested tried it proves out 100% God's under obligation to answer that Faith look what it did that mother standing there she put her baby in uh into the same death that every other baby went into speak of Moses's Mom right putting it into the Nile and a little basket about so big and a baby laying in it probably about 3 months old laying in a little basket about so long nothing but a bunch of rushes like Willows laced together with some pitch and slime messed in it and pushed it out into the flags where the crocodiles and everything else was uh but why it would have meant death well sure it was right in it was right in the same river of death but by faith and atonement was made for it by faith not by an act of natural laws but by faith natural laws would have just proved the alligator smelt the baby and that was it see or out where the first Little Wave would have tipped it over that would have settled it but Faith looked beyond that now we've got to understand that Faith overrides natural laws Faith overrides natural laws now in in the um you know at the UN and then also in America and different places there's different positions that have the power of veto who knows what veto is you like the UN there'll be news the security Council will try and pass some piece of legislation and but there's permanent members of the security C Council that have the power of veto so basically the majority can vote Yes we want to do that but someone can stand up say no veto that and it's cancelled right and so now Faith Faith vetos or overwrites natural laws now you take for example you take for example the sun will rise at a certain time and set at a certain time right right we can actually you know tonight tonight the sun will set at 18 8 we know that right apparently when um when Christopher Columbus or one of them was was there in the Caribbean he knew that there was a blood moon was going to rise and he actually told the natives I'm going to turn the blood red unless you know you do what I say and it turned blood because they knew by their times and their charts that it was going to happen so that was natural laws right but now when Joshua was was was there fighting the enemy his faith overrode the natural laws remember the sun will always rise it always set but his faith overrode those natural laws it vetoed it the sun saying I'm going down Joshua says no IO you can't go down Moon you can't go down you stay there until we've won this battle writes a has Faith overrode the natural laws Hallelujah and they stayed still for 24 hours so normally well say 100% of the time the law the natural law of death states that when life leaves the you know any kind of organism then that body will go right and Decay that's the natural laws of life right but faith will override that law hallelujah amen the shunamite woman now we're going to the shunamite woman was given a child remember she built a little room and you know you know for Elisha the prophet to to to go rest in and you know the prophet said to gazi go get the shite woman you know what does she need you know you know she says well you dwell with my people you I don't need to go see the captains or whatever and then gazi said well she doesn't have a son and so the prophet said well you're going to have a son and she said you know don't make fun of me basically you know old and so on but she said no no no I mean he said to her you're going to have the son remember it wasn't the prophet that gave the promise it was God hallelujah so now here she is and the child was grown and it fell on the day that he went out with his father to the Reapers and he said unto his father my head my head so he got like stroke or something and he said to the um and he said to a lad carry him to his mother and when he had taken him and brought him to his mother he sat on her knees till noon and then died so now the natural law of death means he's they're going to bury him and he's going to rot and decompose and that's it but this judite woman had the power of veto so she went and came into the man of God to mount carel and it came to pass when the man of God saw a far off that he said to gahaz his servant behold Yonder is the shite run now I pray thee to meet her and sayto her is it well with thee is it well with thy husband is it well with the child and she answered it is well Hallelujah so so naturally it'd say Well it maybe it's not well with you it's not well with your husband because you've lost your son and it's sure not well with him because he's dead I me but she had she had a faith that overrode a natural law and she knew if I can just get into the presence of the word if I just get into the presence of that prophet all will be well so as soon as she found she found the prophet she says it is well Hallelujah because now her faith was going to override Hallelujah that law of natural death and it was going to bring life again Hallelujah it wasn't the prophet's faith that brought the child back to life it was the shite's faith it was her faith when it was released Amen to to to the prophet Hallelujah God came on the scene and it was going to stay a funeral but it became a resurrection Hallelujah she knew if she could just get to just get to the prophet all would be well that's the same thing with blind bmus blind bmus was you know he was blind the natural law says if you go blind you stay blind especially in those days there's no there's no surgery to to undo whatever he had but he had a faith he had a faith that would reverse his blindness are you following me I want you to noce your faith is powerful if God is if you have a revelation of Jesus Christ amen that that is the same faith that created sun moon and stars amen because remember God stood there before there was anything said let there be light and he and the prophet said he believed his own word hallelujah and everything materialized amen hallelujah so now here was blind byus the natural laws would say you can never recover your sight again and you might as well just accept that you're blind but he his mommy told him stories of the god of Joshua yeah Hallelujah of Elijah of elishah that passed through Jericho passed through around here I mean of Rahab and different ones and then he began to hear a noise coming down the street that he never heard before and Jesus of Nazareth was coming this way and people are maybe crying out hosana and here's the son of David and isn't this wonderful others were saying get out of here you false prophet this is nothing but a fraud and you know he would hear these things and and and then he would ask someone you know brother B would dramatize it he would he would lean up against the you know wall of the city you know where the where the son had baked into the stones and now it was warm against his back and he would he would rest there and and then he'd hear this cry going past and then he would turn to someone and say what's going on what is this going on and and then a woman would come to him and say oh blind bmus this is do you know what who who's coming by no who's coming by Jesus of Nazareth well who's Jesus of Nazareth well he's a prophet From Galilee a prophet then his mind you know his heart would begin to begin to flutter a prophet I don't know what prophets do Hallelujah and then she would begin to testify to him you know he C the storm Lazarus came out of the Grave 4 days hallelujah he was in there am mean the you know you know the sick were healed the blind were you know their sight was given the blind their sight given oh Jesus Son of David have mercy on me and it wasn't his physical voice that got Jesus attention it was his faith he knew that if he could just get the Master's attention amen the natural law of blindness would be undone it would be vetoed it would be overrode Hallelujah and he would get his sight back and that's exactly what happened sir Hallelujah see Faith doesn't act by natural laws amen it doesn't act by natural laws it it Faith overrides natural laws right Hallelujah you know so to override it means to use one's authority to reject or cancel we got to use our god-given Authority the devil says one thing override it doesn't matter how great a schemes may be how long he's been planning something against you just override it with your faith say no devil you're not coming here am not today Hallelujah not today Satan not today you can't have my child not today you know ordinarily a a human being is built as the Apostle Paul would say not one seeks after God ordinarily doesn't matter who you are you're actually born not to seek God but faith will override that faith will override that and turn a heart to begin to seek God hallelujah you know in 2007 I was lost and undone but there were people who were sitting in this room that were praying for a pastor hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah what happened now Faith came override my Fallen nature began to draw me and I met the Lord in September 2007 hallelujah amen Faith Works yes Faith doesn't back up Faith doesn't compromise faith gets the victory Hallelujah faith is determined hello woman of Faith how are you Hallelujah that's how we should be amen we should use our veto the devil's got a lot of plans for us but God has a plan but there's a power in your decision remember God doesn't Force us to take a Rapture he doesn't Force us to overcome brother B says he doesn't just push us through a pipe and make us overcome we have to choose who are we going to yield ourselves to amen hallelujah hallelujah so the sh might said it as well you know that same one that she made contact with is here that's right she wasn't going after a natural man only she was trying to contact the God and the prophet he's the Holy Ghost and that same God is here we just get into his presence amen it is well Hallelujah Lord hallelujah but she said I'll not I'm not going to leave you so the prophet came came back over prayed walked up and down the room laid his body upon the dead child and it came back to life now the woman Martha knew that the sh might realize that God was in his prophet and if God was in his Prophet surely God was in his son so if she could just get to Jesus she would she would have the remedy so she runs and falls down before him says Lord if that's what he was Lord if thou would have been here my brother would not have died but even now whatsoever you ask God God will do it oh I like that even now whatsoever you ask God God will do it Hallelujah cuz he was the one with the power of the veto to override lazarus's death now I want you to you know Jesus always wants to bring us into the present tense she would say I know at the last day my brother will raise again and it's always one day it'll happen one day we'll get the promise yeah sure one day and it's always off in the future but Jesus was not interested in the last resur he wasn't interested in that Resurrection for Lazarus he came to the tomb that he would be raised that day that was the purpose that he went by the way of Lazarus right so she says I know at the last day you know I know that he shall rise again the resurrection at the last day but Jesus said to her I am I am the resurrection and the life right now right now I am the resurrection not just I will be cuz he will be but I am amen where he is is a resurrection where he is he is the resurrection amen so if he is in our presence right now the resurrection's here hallelujah the same God that Rose Lazarus from the grave is present amen and he can resurrect you from your doubt from your unbelief from your pain from your complexes from whever it may be from your hurt whatever it is he can raise you from that into life Hallelujah he's here to do it amen don't look off into the future right now right now Hallelujah he brought he brought her Focus don't look off there right now you are standing Marthur in the presence of the Resurrection how I say little bride right here you are sitting in the presence of the resurrection and the life Jesus Christ hallelujah what could happen if we just release our desires to him right now we realize he's here to meet every need hallelujah amen right now thank why do you say the resurrection's here he is his word he is his word you can't separate Jesus in his word his word is here amen his word is in flesh hallelujah it's more than just think on paper more than quotes on a screen it's in flesh Hallelujah so he is the resurrection and the life right now amen hallelujah glory to God never ever let the devil say well the promise can be tomorrow not today hey the devil is the greatest procrastinator he'll try and get you to procrastinate he'll try and get you to put off a promise for tomorrow he'll make sure everything else is busy than that promise Hallelujah isn't that right he'll try oh put it off I got to do this I got to do that no just get to the master just get to him hallelujah hallelujah amen now no matter what the opposition looks like Christ is the answer Faith brings Christ notice would you remember 80 years old Whitebeard white here and yet the old man went around telling people he wasn't going to die till he had seen the Lord's Christ This is this is uh Simeon or Simon in the temple what a beautiful picture of faith faith knows no defeat faith is perfect Faith brings things when there is no things to be brought Faith creates Faith takes doubt away takes negative and makes them positive how beautiful the old man had a basis for faith faith is not mythical something mentally worked up it's an absolutely fundamental results that happens in a person's heart when faith is appropriated then it is something in the person's heart but it can't be based on go touch a tree and you'll get well or pray to the post it's got to have a foundation oh here it is I want you to get it how much more Foundation could you place your faith on any level than the word of God what more could you put Faith in when he said heavens and earth will pass away but my word shall never pass away so it's not something mentally worked up it's something that's given and when it's given it's sure and secure Hallelujah it knows no defeat I just I I just want to read it again I like it Faith knows no defeat faith is perfect Faith brings things where there's no things to be brought he say I don't know a way out of this he'll bring a way out I don't know how this is going to happen he'll cause it to happen H I don't know how how this is going I don't know how I'm going to get well I don't know how this is going to he brings it amen because our reality is the word of God it's not what we see not what we feel not what we hear it's absolutely the word faith creates Faith takes doubt away takes negative and makes positive Hallelujah what shall we and how shall they preach except they be seen as it is written how beautiful are the feet of them that preach the gospel of peace and bring Glad Tidings of good things but they have not all obeyed the gospel for Isaiah sayith Lord who have believed our report and when I read that I say I believe the report Hallelujah so then Faith cometh by hearing and hearing by the word of God right so faith comes by hearing and you're hearing comes by the word hallelujah so where the word of God is preached it produces Faith amen it it causes a hearing in the elect right and it produces a faith amen and there has never been a faith released upon the Earth as today there's never been a faith right there's been people who have been looking for the promise of the body change but now rapturing faith has come to the church Hallelujah because remember when God ever does something when he opens his word it releases of Faith which is equal to that word so for example Israel was slaves in Egypt then God came down on SI I'm going to give you a land what did it do it produced a faith in a people the Caleb and Joshua outfit and they said we're more than able to take the land and they took the land Hallelujah isn't that right amen and then they did great works of Faith because that word they received now that's just a shadow under the blood of bulls and goats how much more people under the blood of Jesus Christ amen where now the word came open in Jesus's day he revealed himself right to give a overcoming power to the church that they would not be beaten down by demon Spirits they would not be beaten down by their first birth right they would not be beaten down by things passed down their lineages and different things but they would have overcoming power right over the flesh over the devil Hallelujah over the grave amen they would be Overcomers amen hallelujah but you see the problem is is there had to be a cycle of Revival and death so that church walked in power in the book of Acts but then they slowly went down into formalism and then Into the Dark Ages but God said I will restore but then what happened is God held back what John saw on the aisle of Patmos where he says he was about to write what the Thunders were he says don't write it down because there's going to be a people at the end time that will need that power contained in those Thunders right I'm going to release it into the church at a certain time Hallelujah and that Faith that's released through that word is going to give them rapturing Faith sir hallelujah amen and so in the end time the book comes open and we know that the mystery contained in the Thunders is the revelation of the Seven Seals right right so when the book came open now it released a rapturing faith to a bride Hallelujah that that we can live over the flesh amen over all demon power amen hallelujah we can walk in Victory Amen in spite of whatever the devil tries to put on us we can walk in Victory amen we can we can walk above grudges we can walk above resentment we can walk above unforgiveness amen we can walk above anything the devil tries to put on anyone we can walk above it I me because God has released a faith into the church I me to overcome all those things amen hallelujah he say well I don't see that happening open your eyes and look around open your eyes and look around and you will see it is happening amen where a people can be brought from every corner of the Earth into one place and walk in harmony work in harmony operate as one body Hallelujah as as as the temple was stones from different places different materials built to make that Temple Am mean so is the body of Jesus Christ gathered from different parts of the earth Hallelujah and they built into one body and we can go to different nations you know yeah it just rejoiced my heart when I went to Vanuatu the first time now I know me talk piss and all so I know a little bit of pigeon from Pap and they speak bislama you just you know you just change a few words and you can kind of so I'm talking to um some of the Brethren up there that speak French as their first language they don't know English so we're so we're communicating in this broken pigeon and we're having a jubilee cuz the same spirit's there we're talking about the Lord and how good he is and we're just having such a good time Hallelujah why cuz the same spirit is there amen why because it's the body of Christ coming together hallelujah amen that's right amen now so there is a power being released in this day this is why the bride is ordained she cannot fall in this day unfortunately that first bride had to fall cuz there had to be a dark ages but God has released a power into the church right that we would have we'd go back to the book of Acts but not the failures of the book of Acts but the victories right but the overcoming power the manifestation of the word right but God would release a power into the church by the book coming open that we wouldn't go back into death but we'd stay in life Hallelujah and that's that's an individual thing it's not a collective thing it's an individual thing amen that there are people that will break the cycle of Revival and death but they will come from death and stand in Revival am mean they won't cool down if the Devil Comes against them try and make them cold and formal and Powerless they will resist that Spirit they will they will they will absolutely just curse that thing in the name of Jesus Christ and they'll walk on in Revival yes sir that doesn't mean we won't have our ups and downs but there will be a people that will not settle with just church anity Hallelujah there's a people that will not settle with the God not moving they will not rest I'll say Lord I want you to move every service touch my life every time I open your word every time I hear a tape every time I pray I want to feel you come down and change my life Hallelujah I want you to come and move and take the service you know if we are living stones Hallelujah but it's not our life anymore it's God's life Hallelujah so God should be able to come down to a church and just take the service over in such a way that it's not the preacher preaching it's God's pre it's God preaching it's not the congregation worshiping and saying amen it's God saying amen hallelujah it's them singing cating It's God doing it it's not a human ability it's God doing it Hallelujah you know like brother brah would say sometimes he'd have to go back and listen to the prayer lines to see what happened cuz he wasn't even conscious of what God was doing yeah and he would say to many people now whatever he said just then you go do it Hallelujah I think now this is just me I think we should be able to have to go look back at the recording amen and say what happened amen hallelujah CU we're so yielded I'm not I'm not talking about this guy I'm talking about all of us hallelujah shouldn't it be that way we're Channel you God God said I'm going to dwell in the human heart I'm going to live out of them you know when brother Braham says this and it's to me it's more than a quote he says if the spirit of Shakespeare was in me I would write great place and poetry yes if the spirit of bethoven was in me I'd make great I'd write great music if the spirit of Michelangelo was in me I'd do great masterpieces he says Michelangelo and I cannot live in the same body one of us has to be dead other one has to be living right and if the so if the spirit of Jesus Christ is in me I will do the works of Jesus Christ he and me can't live in the same place I have to be my life is dead and hid in Christ and the life I now live live by the faith of the Son of God hallelujah that's how it should be it's not me it's not me living no more hallelujah it's him living amen hallelujah now I believe this is from the rising of the Sun the quickening power wasn't only in their soul but it was all over them hallelujah hallelujah so the quickening power didn't just stay in their soul and didn't have an outworking all right amen yeah to me I you know I don't understand how people can say I have the Holy Ghost there's no manifestation we're not Baptists a Baptist just says I believe by faith but there's no manifestation the bride amen this day we have the mechanics and we have the Dynamics right so the mechanics is actually you surrender to God and the Dynamics is Holy Ghost living through you right so to me now we can't just say well I have the Holy Ghost but there's no life amen that's just that's just empty words Hallelujah you say well my heart's been turned and stuff praise the Lord just keep walking right it's it's God's work to turn the heart you know you know we know the interview with sister Bruce where brother says actually when your heart was turned from walking to with the world and Walking with God that's when you received the Holy Ghost but she had a burden to pray for people so that was God working in her life she was a prayer Warrior but we should be able to look back and we should be able to see a book of Acts living amen God lived here and God lived there and God's Alive here you following me a testimony is not just a one time Affair you know before I ever went to a messes church I was briefly at a Pentecostal church and they were they were sincere people fine people but you know all their testimonies were the same they spoke in tongues that's it you know there was no you know and praise the Lord but you got to go beyond just being anointed and you know I'm not again speaking in tongues right yeah but there's got to be a life change where we can look back and say I was that guy now I'm this guy and I see I see the Lord the word actually putting on flesh it's not I'm not just quoting quotes the quotes are living I'm not just quoting scripture the scripture is living yes sir Hallelujah so the quickening power wasn't just only in their soul it was all over them Hallelujah not only the Dynamics coming to Quicken but it quickened the mechanics you see what I mean they were so Quicken until their tongues begin to speak other language they were so quickened by the power of the resurrection of Christ until they laid their hands they were so quickened with quickening power till when they laid their hands upon the sick they got well and quickened your mortal body they were healed by laying on their hand and the spirit quickened their Fellowship together with god Till They also were so quickened into the presence of God until when a person died and their soul had gone off it called him back to life again amen glory now I'm feeling religious Hallelujah why cuz they had a reality and we have this reality brother says that the end time message releases the Holy Ghost upon the people hallelujah because it's no longer bound at the doors of Creeds and dogmas amen right it's no longer bound back that it can't move but the word has been restored so the Holy Ghost can just have free course Hallelujah he say well I've got quickening power you'll have the nature of God to prove it that's amen amen right amen having a temple like a buur and saying you're seal and something's not right that's right quicker Not only was his resurrection for himself but whosoever will owe this predestinated seed that's laying there Quicken quickens the Mortal body they laid hands on the sick they recovered they prayed in the spirit they saw Vision called the dead back to life that's right Qui Quicken their mortal body if it comes unto you if it be so now you can say it so but if it's so these signs follow them that believe you see it quickens your mortal body it'll Quicken you now no notice quickening in the prin of God why it was the spirit of God that raised up Jesus from the grave and the spirit of God I give unto them eternal life come from the Greek word if you look up Zoe which moves in through you and then quickens even uh their even their mind now notice God's life which is in the Greek called Zoe moved through them and in them Quicken their minds to his word now let me say it real quietly now the spirit of God that moves among the people quickens the mind of the person to the promise of God see it doesn't look and I'm trying to show you and let you realize that I'm speaking now of the church and also Quicken to life in him now I want to go back to my thought before I said about how Faith overrides a natural natural law right and normally it's not a man's heart to follow God there has to come a faith that will override that yes right so although although they only had his attributes to begin with but if God said in this day back in the beginning John Doe will be my servant millions of years ago now John Doe is born in sin shaped in iniquity come to the world speaking lies because he's Immortal right but maybe he gets a little religious feeling now that's still natural law because it's naturally built a man to be religious thou worship Darwin th worship all different kinds of things th worship a church th worship a ministry right they worship nature all different kinds of things they'll worship it they'll worship themselves Southeast hello look at me and they'll put a filter on it to say they're Idols better than anyway now see so that's just but something has to override that you see he might get a little religious feeling he'll go join a church maybe he'll join a Pentecostal church I don't know he might join anything but let him get under the atmosphere of God once see John do is bound to recognize who his father is this is why atmosphere is so important amen that's why atmosphere because it took an atmosphere to birth you Hallelujah cuz it goes beyond what the preacher says beyond what the song is singing it's an atmosphere that comes down and it makes you recognize oh Lord God you're my father Hallelujah so if it create it required an atmosphere for you it sure will create a require an atmosphere for our children that's why atmosphere is so important that's why we're so rigid and overbearing of being helicopter parents how that going to work amen you got to train them up in the way that they should go Hallelujah and that's not you know we have to create an atmosphere in the home that they want what we have that they actually want what Daddy has what Mommy has I want that I want that God they have I want that one that's how we got to be see it takes atmosphere that's why it's so important don't come to church with something OD against someone in your heart that's don't come with resentment don't come with unforgiveness don't come all you know the devil will try and scrible us up before we get through the door sure Sunday morning expect it where's your shoes where's this where's my I don't know what's you know wake up with a headache and all this different stuff you know but don't come to church with resentment in your heart lay it all at the altar just lay it down say Lord I'm not I don't want to carry this stuff that's not my portion the devil you can have a back devil amen return it Return to Sender yeah see it's just just as that eagle recognized who the mother was it's going to re it's it's got to realize it see only that John Do's God's attribute that became a word spoken and then the Holy Ghost seeks that word out here it is he calls him gives him everlasting life and brings him into the presence of God God's word hallelujah he sought you out yeah you know we should be very thankful that God visits us here we shouldn't take it for granted we really honestly shouldn't take it for granted that the great Eternal God would say I'm going to come to 113 George Street soaks Valley today I'm going to visit my children or maybe you're at home and he comes down or you're driving the car he comes down or prayer meeting wherever it is we should never take it for granted oh God God's obligated to me because I'm his child hold on hold on it's not us dictating to God to get him to do stuff we should be he found us you didn't find him right Hallelujah we should be very thankful every time he visits us and we should cherish it and we should just Rejoice say thank you Lord that you would deem it fit to come this day now Faith as I say overrides natural laws King David was a man of faith and he would he would have a lot of different situations in life and we know that things will come into our life to really prove what's in us right and it's not the good things it's it's the bad things we really prove what's in you Hallelujah right it'll prove it is it you know are you a are you a Everlasting fountain flowing forth or you a bitter stream sweet or Bitter Water what's going to come out because it can only be one it's not a mix so here we have when David came to Barum behold there came out a man of the family of the House of Saul whose man whose name was shimi the son of G Gira he came forth and cursed still as he came and he cast stones at David and all the Servants of the king all all the Servants of King David and all the people and all the mighty men were on his right hand and on his left so this is David on the run from Absalon and now here's here's a man who's from the house of Saul which was David's enemies he's like now's my opportunity kick him when he's down we're going to kick him when he's down I'm going to get my revenge I've always wanted to tell David what I think of him right now's my opportunity so thus shimi when he cursed he said come out come out thou bloody man thou man of B the Lord hath returned upon thee all the blood of the House of Saul in whose stead thou H has reigned and the Lord has delivered the kingdom into the hand of Absalon thy son and behold Thou Art taken in thy Mischief because thou art a bloody man then said abashi the son of zura however you say that unto the king why should this dead dog curse my Lord the king let me go over I pray thee and take off his head Hallelujah and the King said what have I to do with you so now here we are let's just set a inene we all know the story David just needs to speak a word and this guy is going to be a dead dog right so life and death is in the power of the tongue remember this is all happening to see David what's in you when you're down when the chips are down when you're on the Run not when you're Victorious standing on the body of Goliath and cutting his head off or doing whatever he's done in great Triumph no what's in you when you're down David hallelujah hallelujah you know the reason is that God wants to prove to you what's in you yes sir he wants to show you really what's in the depth of thy heart what's really in you and so David just could speak a word abashi let him die slowly or you know whatever cut off his head and the King said what have I to do with you ye sons of zura so let him curse because the Lord has said unto him curse David now I have not read in any of this passage of scripture where David says to shimi hold on shimi can you stop throwing stones at me I want to ask you a question did the Lord tell you to do this he found it anywhere but what he did is because he was a man of Faith he was a living Stone he attributed whatever happened to him in life that God allowed it so he didn't take it personally he said no actually God's allowing this whole circumstance and he was bold enough to say actually the Lord spoke to him yeah and said go curse David because the Lord had said unto him curse David what shall I what shall then say who shall so who shall then say wherefore hast thou done so and David said to abash to all of us and to all his servants behold my son which came forth of my bow seeketh my life how much more now may this benjamite do let him alone let him curse for the Lord hath bidden him amen now what would have we done if we were in this place let's stick the guy is that what we would have done I'm a Believer are you I'm anointed I'm anointed positionally placed as the king of Israel I'm an adopted son in the body I've been walking with the Lord I'm walking in the message of the hour I'm not in a former age under the leadership of Saul I'm walking in the present truth the books come open to me Hallelujah the vision the pattern of the temples come to me I got to lay up the materials for my son to build the temple I'm I'm under the eagle anointing but what is our response when everyday life happens you want to get the sword and you know kill a lot of people because remember the battle is the Lords because after this when David returns in power who was the first in line to beg forgiveness shimi was this guy he was first in line to be on his knees biging for forgiveness when David returned in power Hallelujah and it was actually shim's character that caused him to die because David told shimi or I think it was um um Solomon he said listen shimi you stay in Jerusalem that's right if you leave you'll die and then after a while he two of his servants go to to the land of the Philistines and he goes after them so his own character brought his downfall my Lord Jesus may may our character not bring our downfall May our own character not bring our downfall Lord May Our Lives be may we be new creatures in you may it not be our Humanity you following me May it not be our our our human self that causes our own downfall that when our brother and sister are on the run because of something we don't say well I told you so I knew it was in them see i' I've been waiting for this Lord help us what's in us friends that brother Braham says that shimi was crippled up in his Doctrine he says this in the spoken word is the Original Seed and we know Doctrine is a is a principle or position so he was crippled up in his Doctrine and basically what he believed was kick him when he's down here's the enemy here's my chance but is this how a Christian should be remember to be a Lively Stone you know we think about all the books come open we by being partaker of the word we've taken the book we've eaten the book now we're prophesying again and the mighty Angels here and you know all these Mighty things of Thunders coming forth from the presence of God and you know you the world will hear directly from God as he did on the day of Pentecost and you know all these things but how does equate to everyday life cuz it's easy to be caught up in the seven everything I think as um you know we heard at camp but what about everyday life when when when there's ought done against us where things happen that we don't expect what are we going to do sure we should stand for the word and you know we should conduct things a certain way but are we looking for the death of someone are we looking for the Deliverance of someone amen what are you looking for so the Lord told them to do that amen hallelujah that's right and here we are Jesus would stand the son of David would tell pilate pilate says don't you know I have the power to release thee or the power to crucify thee and Jesus answered thou couldst have no power at all against me except to be given from thee from above therefore he that delivered me unto thee hath the greatest sin so everything that happens in life you know this world is falling apart there's people coming into positions and they're doing all different kinds of things the only reason they're in those position is God has allowed them to be there remember it says in the Book of Revelation he will put it in their hearts to fulfill God's will even though they're not aware that it's going on so can we can we walk in this Fallen World hey this world's not going to get better sorry doesn't matter how many rats I catch how many more maybe toys and wood pigeons I see ker do I see this world's going to you it's going to have a burning off there going to be a new heavens and new earth right but I still like to see tues and K do and different things so so I kill rats right but you know it's not all we can't say as I as I said a while ago Predator free what 2030 or 2050 we'll get it one day that's in the Millennium we be Predator free but you know but all these things the world is falling apart but Lord Jesus help us to realize because we're living stones we should have the mind of Christ to be able to look beyond what these five senses declare and our reality is now now we are walking up into glory amen as brother Brenham would see the preview of the bride and he saw the first church come forth and white garments and everything right and then he saw the different nations come forth and America was the worst and you know the modern Church coming forth being led by a witch and then he saw the preview of the because he thought Lord is this the best I can give you and his heart broken him and you know he says but now now be the preview of The Last Day bride and they dressed as the first ones yes and they singing Onward Christian Soldier marching as to war but then some some would begin to you know because the CU the modern Church would go to a place and go walking down but the real bride was walking and started going up but some at the end they going to start look around at what the modern church was doing and they were getting out of Step getting out of step with the word so we're going to be real careful what we look at right what's leading us because a witch was leading them a witch yours ain't going to lead me Hallelujah I'm going up amen that should be our that should be the desire of our heart yes sir Hallelujah let's stay in line with this word yes sir amen Living Stones what manner of stones are here I'll just I'll just finish with this now there there would have been a lot of laws pass in the UN if the countries who had the right to veto did not veto doesn't matter what they were they had the authority to veto they vetoed or the president or whatever more but why so if that's the case should we not use our power of veto the devil has a scheme this is the future for your family's life this is where they're going to go are you just going to sit back or you going to veto the thing and say no no no devil my Revelation declares unto me that thy and thy seed the God's word will be in the mouth of you and thy seed and thy seed seed that's what it says in Isaiah Hallelujah and the promises unto you and your children those are far off even as many as the Lord Our God shall call right that is that is the promise so we should use our power of veto because if you've received the Holy Ghost the second part of that's for you if I received it then the promise is to my children because the first part worked I've seen it live then the second part will live and those that are far off maybe Wayward ones or whoever more it's for them too Hallelujah so we have to we must use our god-given Authority Amen to veto the devil's plans your faith will override Hallelujah whatever the devil wants to do amen we have the authority to do it yes sir it's now time why was that song so powerful last last Sunday because people was saying not today they said it see we have to address the enemy you've got to address the issue right you've got to stand there and draw a line and say no more Satan you must obey my voice just as Pharaoh had to eventually let the children of Israel out of Egypt right he had to obey the voice of Moses amen we have the same and we're under the blood of Jesus Christ not under the blood of bulls and goats Hallelujah so we should stand and say no devil not today oh maybe if someone else says it no no you've got to say it that's right you've got to look your enemy in the eye and say I'm done amen you're getting out of here I'm not I'm not putting up with you a single day Hallelujah faith is perfect it doesn't know defeat it brings things when when there's no things and uh to be brought Faith creates Faith takes doubt away takes negative and makes positive that's the kind of faith that we have right now oh one day I'll get that Faith No no no you got that Faith right now you got to use that Faith the faith you have just just put into action and see what happens Hallelujah there's demon Spirits you fighting you battles whatever oppression whatever it may be you tell it not today amen amen I don't know my future you've got a future Hallelujah I don't know how this is I don't know how I'm going to get healed of this thing no faith will create a healing Hallelujah faith will bring peace am amen so use your veto remember the resurrection and the life is here he's here amen amen can the musicians please come this morning am me let's let's stand this morning shall
