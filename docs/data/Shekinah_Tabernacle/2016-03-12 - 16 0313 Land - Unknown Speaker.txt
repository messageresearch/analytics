and that peace and that will end the eternal pneus of that you can take your seats we've got a special today I don't want to give too much away Isaac will you tell you when you when he wrote that song and the inspiration at that point you want some beat were there yep yep yeah okay the song is called um go tell John them and can you put the words up on the screen by the end ok now it's quite a weirdy songs a lot of words to it so you've got to kind of take snippets of breath when you get a chance it's one of those songs but um the idea of the song is that sort of types John and his time that he had wondering whether Jesus was the Christ and then the typeset to this day some people think knows that brother branwell of someone else and all that sort of things so that the verse is that the first light the first verses are essentially John thinking is that your do we look for another and then the answer that Jesus gave to John was look at what's happening this is my word come to pass so you don't have to worry as it true or not it's actually coming to pass in the idea of the song is that God interpreters own word by bringing it to pass so people can fast and argue and everything over it but God just goes hidden does it anyway and those that recognize it just enjoy it coming to pass so that's what the songs about if I get it wrong forgive me because I don't really not that well and this song we was written about the same time as do believe but I didn't really put it together so it's kind of like his brother so I kind of stole a few little strong patterns and that from that one came at the same time he kind of over let it's quite a fast song if I get it wrong i'm just going to stop and carry on i'll just do what I do don't worry about me okay and I might hand if I can't play probably might when I did flooring my elbow went funny and I can't actually hold the keys down very strong on the stands at chords so yeah it was worse on Wednesday or the last day I played I could hardly push the strings down I'm surprised I made it through but we'll see how we go is it you or do we look for another I can hear John say his eagle eyes we're getting clouded over seem to have lost his way John's disciples went to Jesus told him all that John it's a Jesus and then with the message and this is what he said go tell John that the lame they walk go tell John that the blind they see go tell John that the date erase the captives they have all been granted Liberty go tell John when my prophet speaks believe it receive it in your heart you don't have to understand it it stands all alone and I'll interpret it by bringing it to pies you don't have to understand it it stands all alone and I'll interpret it by bringing it to find is it him or do we look for another I have heard some say is this elijah that Malachi spoke a Weiand Bible day search the Scriptures Jesus told us and there they testify me did not I tell you I'd send Elijah he would restore all things tell my bride that the light is here tell my bride that the books not see you tell my bride that the word is open the mysteries of the seven seals have been review tell my bride when my profits face believe it receive it in your heart you don't have to understand it it stands all alone and I'll interpret it by bringing it to pass you don't have to understand it it stands all alone and I'll interpreted by bringing it to pass become my bride will tell my bride that the light is here tell my bride that the books not see you tell my bro that the word is open the mysteries of the seven seals have been review tell my bride when my prophet speaks believe it receive it in your heart you don't have to understand it it stands all alone and I'll interpreted by bringing it to pies you don't have to understand it it stands all alone and I'll interpreted by bringing it to me thank you brother Isaac competition is strong in the challenges do you have that 52 songs this here and other nd is now contributing as well as that contributing many members i think or christine is technically as well so i'm behind that oh I'll JP it's time to worship let's uh let's all stand let's get in there in that place where with the Lord wants you open up your heart leave everything like I said leave everything at Delta it's let's get quiet let's give him is lori is praising let's worship Him don't hold back open up if you need to pray continue to let everything out in the open get all those skeletons out the challenges that we face today is as hard and it's and it's real and but he is the line and we will turn to him we know who is victorious no has already won that battle for us we've got to stand on his word there's a preacher that said when all your favorite preachers are gone and all your favorite musicians are gone worship leaders and everything you need to come to where they came from what they stood on and that's the Bible that's the word and he said master it the amplifier then exclaimed that he said master and very guilty to go and rely on want to preach out there and go and listen at a sermon and then and not dig into the word that he's been given to us at that moment so

obedience step forward to to bring us the word of this Aaron and the message for this moment we pray or love over him and his family they are a blessing to all of us in Jesus name is the Lord God bless you everyone and well you Bibles and we will read from first Corinthians 15 verses 51 down to about 57 first Corinthians chapter 15 verse 51 says behold I show you a mystery we shall not all sleep but we shall all be changed in a moment and the twinkling of an eye at the last trumpet for the trumpet shall sound and the dead shall be raised incorruptible and we shall be changed for this corruptible must put on incorruption and this mortal must put on immortality so when this corruptible shall have put on incorruption and this mortal shall have put on immortality then shall be brought to pass the saying that is written death is swallowed up tree o death where is thy sting o grave where is thy victory Amy we just leave it there we'll just pray this morning Heavenly Father was so grateful for your word Lord and his brother branham said many times before he would start preaching or do you would say let's just turn to the word because well we know that your words won't fail Lord but our words failed many times they always fail but we're so glad that we have your word that's an anchor for our soul that's a light to our path what it leads us and it guides us and it makes us sure Lord as we go through life when we get more responsibilities Lord and we get we begin to have to lead people we realize Lord that we lead the wrong way and we lead into failure and misery but we are so happy that we can follow your leadership and follow your word and it gives us courage Lord to press on nine Lord that if we follow the truth and if we follow you that it's eternal and that its strong and secure so we just thank you for being here in our midst this morning I just continue to bless bless those that can't make it just pray another blessing upon the youth camp lawton that um some of us here I've got an invested interest than that with our children being the other just pay your bliss not only our children but all the children the young people that go Lord may they meet you in a powerful way may their lives be changed mat not just be a just an emotional decision as they get sort of worked up with your friends and that but may it may there be something just sink down in his soul Lord that would change the life and those that already changed us may they be something more for them to give them strength and to keep them set on the path of righteousness so I just want to commit ourselves um we thank you for this good day we thank you for your blessings and we thank you for the victory and Jesus Christ pray this in Jesus name Amen praise the lawd you can take your seats this morning okay the subject that I want to speak on this morning is called land land and it's a funny scripture to read and try and tie it into land but it does eventually end up to be to do with land the scripture that we just read and I just find it fascinating that the subject of land this essentially the six inches of soil it sits underneath our feet here you can almost tie the whole gospel into it it's an amazing thing and I just love how the Lord has made creation and has made everything that if we would just stop and look around and take care and observe that we can see the fingerprints of God through everything and I'm not overly mechanically minded but there are some people here that I know that I and they see like a maybe a vehicle and they appreciate how the vehicle works and the mechanics of it and then they appreciate even will win open up the hood and they can see just how wonderful it's made of how this part works on that part and that works there and there and it all works together I don't really do that yes but i like the word of god not that they don't but I just enjoy how you see it and look so good then you go and look into it and you see her every part fits all together and works perfectly it never ceases to throw my soul every time you might think it's such a simple thing and you start looking into it and you realize this is complex but it all works together so well and land has been one of those little studies that I've done that I've just really enjoyed so can you bring up the first slide dear brother Andy oh I don't have a clicker sorry so maybe i might do brother Tim's think we've got the yeah what did brother I'll record it the finger technology will get that okay that's our scripts for their next one I want to just quickly run over what I want to cover seems like a lot so maybe I go fast so you and this is where i'm going with us this is one of those ones where it just it's not really just a mismatch of information like my other one it's kind of got a sequence of events that it goes through and we're going to first talk about the principle of naturalness natural and spiritual land so we're going between the two so we're going to take the natural then we're going to take the spiritual as we go through so it's going to go back and forth okay we're going to go through the first principle that natural or spiritual land isn't owned period it doesn't get owned by man then then we could look into God's ownership of all natural and spiritual land and then we're going to look at a natural and spiritual promised land and then we're going to look at surrendering of governance of a natural and spiritual end and then we're going to look at possessing and subduing natural and spiritual end sounds complicated but it's not and then the natural and spiritual lamb passing away and then there's a new natural and spiritual land so it's all just talking about land but it's just different cycles that the land goes through and that we go through as we are the same so bring on the next one brother oh this is how I started to get this one this is um there's a little pocket Ricky a ring you buy though if you've been to brother John's house and the carpeted coast as you turn into his road is a little wrist area there with a picnic table and it's got a few apple trees and it's got a church across the road and then there's they've got this some little stand there and we went there with the children the other week and I just read this bit of information you can't read it but I'll just read it out some of it and it says that Ricky o Ranga translated into English means the gate or gateway to heaven so John doesn't realize this but he lives and they're so John lives in heaven tell him that he'll enjoy that he's a more spiritual than the rest of us obviously but I just talks about the history of Ricky are any and then it says there was a there was a moldy man called more puku and he was under attack in another area and he went down to Ricky a ring and he basically claimed it for his own and later on when the settlers the Europeans arrived he ended up selling half of the land that he owned and then they built a dairy farm and different things there as time went on and then and about the 60s more activity was happening and why can I so that the place to virtually shut down oh thank thnx here's the park here and his st. andrew's church was built in 1907 I think they had their first service there this was back in the days where when you settled a place you built a church that was what you did it doesn't happen anymore when they settled a place they build a stadium or something like that sports stadium or a movie theater or something but there was us now that got I got thinking about the fact that this man went in the topless land and then he owned the land in he sold it and it got me thinking about here the fact that this man never really owned anything okay so that's where I got this I Diego okay so now the principle of of natural land land not being owned who owns land or has owned land okay so you don't really own it okay you don't own it now I'll show you why and this is an important principle in the study brother Andy looks at a property that he likes he thinks I want to buy that land so he goes and he he puts on his before it he gets it then he does as fills out his agreement to purchase this land he fills that out and then he purchases pays the money than he purchases as land and then next one then brother and he owns a nice barn house he thinks he does okay but brother Andy has only purchased that land under the governance of the New Zealand government so the New Zealand government has come in here and they have essentially taken ownership are taken governance of this land and they have said they have made a law that says you may buy from us the right to occupy a piece of land so they've formed a law that says you can now if you go through these channels you can buy this land you can you can buy the rights to occupy a piece of land okay brother Andy doesn't own it he just bought the rights to occupy it under the current government government okay he doesn't own it now let's say it's 1939-1945 forces go to the next one and the Japanese turn up here and Andy had brought his land in 1939 and he was all set to raise his family now if things hadn't gone as well as what they went in World War two and the Japanese made it all the way here and they took over New Zealand they would take over the governance of this country and then brother Andy's agreement that he had with the current government whose piece of paper that he owns the land would now be if they decided null and void you no longer own this piece of land because the people that you bought the right to to occupy it don't have the rights to give it to you anymore so so if governance changes then the land that we might think that we own we don't own any more because we never did owner in the first place now the principle of Landers that's very important it always goes to the strongest person that wants at the most always now the many countries could take this land away from the New Zealand government but they don't want to they say you can keep that but if they wanted to they would be many countries that could come here and take it from the New Zealand government and then all of our agreements that we have with the new zealand government would be done that's the principle of land now sometimes no just go next one soundtrack as we go through this it just becomes more and more clear now we are spiritual land okay we've got natural an hour we'll go to the spiritual we are spiritual end that's the principle of this whole thing I just like this picture because I like old pictures and I like people hard-working men and women that look after the family fun and that I just like it so I put this picture the ads hasn't got much to deal with spiritual land but it makes you feel good doesn't it makes you feel like wholesome okay yeah now this is just my scripture on spiritual land Jesus talked about the side that went forth to so et types he said sorry and forth to so many sowed seeds and to land and then he ended up saying well you're the land and then the seed that got some was the words I've got into your land okay so that's that's just to show that we are spiritual land you know if we receive the tower grounders ready and we receive the word into our land then it brings forth fruit but other people the seed comes and then other things come in and take away that seeds so that seed word of god never grows in their land okay so so we are spiritual end that's the scripture here now the same principle applies to spiritual land think about this one spiritual land our spiritual and we don't own it we govern it someone else occupies it but we don't own it okay just just like natural land we don't own natural land we just we either govern it and we own it we occupied all we just occupied in some cases on a more simplistic system of governance we they don't have a government essentially someone could walk into a piece of land and say I'm going to own all this piece around or govern all this piece here i'm going to occupy he's the governor and you occupy all wrapped into one but as we get more complex we form governments and they work it out but essentially our spiritual land is the same we don't own our spiritual and we govern it and we occupy it we don't occupy it sorry someone else does but it has to be occupied every piece of land in this world somebody has somebody his governorship over it and even if they didn't use it there are some people that actually could occupied if they wanted to next now the next step that we have is now the principle that God actually owns all land he owns the whole lot now we talk about ownership this is ownership so the scripture here says it's a little bit me to see but I can't see the psalm I think it's 24 7 says the earth is the Lord's and the fullness thereof to me that sounds like ownership so he's saying I own this okay and I like to love this one another is 66 once is thus saith the Lord the heaven is my throne in the earth is my footstool whereas the house that you abou done to me and where is the place of my rest he calls the earth is footstool he owns it he can call it what he wants to we call it home because a footstool okay now spiritual and the next part of that versus the earth is the Lord's in the fullness thereof the world and they that dwell therein so not only has he got ownership of all the natural land he's also saying I own all the people that dwell in that on the earth as well and it includes all the spiritual and so now with this basis of ownership when we own something like like if I owned this battery I can actually own this battery I can't own land but I can own this probably simply because I can put it in my pocket and take it with me wherever I go and hang on to it me having ownership of this battery means that I can do whatever I like with this battery if I'd like to keep it I keep it if I don't want it I can throw it away but you can't tell me what I can and can't do with this battery if it's my battery I have a I decide what I want to do with this battery if I've got ten batteries and only want two batteries I can just get rid of the other eight batteries that's the principle of ownership it's very important principle because that's why you get scriptures like second Timothy 226 but in a great house there are not only vessels of gold and a silver but also I've wood and of earth and some to honor and some to dishonor God saying I want these ones but I don't want those ones and Paul says who are we to revile against God or speak against God so wise you wave you maybe that's why have you done this wavy done that he can do what he wants with the things that he owns he doesn't have to ask us would you mind if I did this with my property he does all things according to the counsel of his own will now that's why also Romans 9 13 he says as it is written Jacob have I loved and Esau have I hated I want this one I don't want that one and whys have to just accept it because that's the way that ownership the first principle of ownership and we don't own ourselves I'll even give you a funny thought you look at you think this is my body the fact of the matter is it's not yours at your parents they lent it to you to dwellin you think about it you didn't even have a body they let you part of the body to live in this body's not even mind that's how frail with the human being is I think God that we serve an eternal powerful God that we can trust them okay now with this idea of ownership God owns all this he owns all this land ok he sees the whole lot just like I might own a lot of batteries but the thing about goddess and I love this this thought here thank God looks at all this natural land and he said you know what the whole lot of land there but you know what he would look all around it all over all the continents and the mountains the dry areas that cold areas the green areas the brown dark areas Baron parched areas and he would have thought I'd say what I want I want that piece there that's what he said Wallace don't want that I want that piece I want that piece that's what he said ok God made Abraham we know the story that he he gave a promise to Abraham he said Abraham I'm going to make a covenant with you there's this piece of land here and I'm going to give it to you because I will actually want that land for myself and I want you there to go and possess and I want that land and that's why we call that a promise land he had a promise that was now a promised land now something happened the moment that God spoke to Abraham and said I'm going to give you that land something happened that very moment that God spoke there to Abraham and that was us God issued now a challenge to the current governance of that land because that land was under governance and it was under occupation he issued a challenge to the present governance of that land saying I'm after you and I'm going to take over that land because there was a governance there that had it under control and there were people there that were occupying it and they were quite happy but the minute that God made a promise to Abraham that same minute had to be I'm issuing a challenge to you and I'm going to come and get it head to be okay this is not part of my sermon but I just loved the scripture here and Psalm 137 verse 1 says by the rivers of Babylon where we sat down yea we wept when we remembered Zion we hang our harps upon the Willows and the midst thereof well there they carried us away for the air they that carried us away captive required of us a song and they that wasted us required of us mirror saying sing us one of the songs of Zion how shall we sing the Lord's song in a strange land if I forget yo Jerusalem it my right hand forget her cunning if I do not remember thee let my tongue cleave to the roof of my mouth if I prefer not Jerusalem above my chief joy there was something more than just a promise it was a deep feeling of something inside these people that that was their land and when they were out of it something in them stirred and that's the anyone that there's a promise over their life when you're out of that is something in you that's desiring it so much because there's a promise there where we sit down we wept when we remembered Zion we remember what that promise was that's more than just a word it's actually makes people act a certain way all the different landing could have chosen all these different regions he just said I want that piece that's my piece all these other countries people keep it I want that piece a promised land okay now we get to the spiritual aspect of it we are land okay all the different people that there are all the different people I want that person I want that land gods made a promise to us I want that land I know there's a lot of other land but I want that land I want that land that's what I want that's the land that I want why don't you take it all I just want that land I just want that one God does what he wants with what he owns I want that one I want that one we are there now promised land now the same thing happened that the moment that promise went forth for us I want that land the same thing happened God issued a challenge to the current governance of this land on after you and the current occupiers up after you I'm after you I'm after that piece of land so you guys enjoy being there well you can because I'm coming after it to get it that's that's yeah that's the same thing that he said that's the promise according estres nice n happen before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and without blame before him and love I'm so glad that God issued that challenge towards the current occupier of this land and you know what you'll be surprised to it actually is we know it's the enemy but there's another funny thought there praise the Lord next one okay now now we get to this point the idea of surrender surrender of land okay I'm going to talk about this one first this is the Japanese in World War two they had ideas to take over the world to take over certain part of the Pacific and for a while there they did quite well but the Allied forces obviously did better and they kept on they fought and they were essentially fighting over who has governance of the Pacific of the land there was a fight for governance in two major powers both wanted governance of this land and they fought and fought and fought for years and no doubt each different army was strategizing every month and every year that went by they were strategizing to to get governance of this land and in the end the Japanese didn't have enough strength and them either money or armed forces wherever it was they eventually ran out of strength to continue fighting for governance of the land they were worn down year after year after year because their whole country was at war whereas a country like America was at and essentially at peace so they could manufacture vehicles and tanks and planes and everything and just keep shipping these things to the Pacific and keep shipping young men across because they weren't being attacked in their country so they could prosper and eventually the Japanese saw that their predicament was dire and after that Americans dropped two nuclear bombs on them they just realized we cut we cannot continue the fight for governance of this land we give up and the deal was with the Americans the deal was you the American said that the Japanese you must give us a full and unconditional surrender sign here surrender with no strings attached and you seed all your governance over to us and that's what they did and this one's of signing of the paper here this was Japan unconditional surrender this was them absolutely giving up governance of their country to the Allied forces to the mainly the Americans now when they did that that meant that every agreement we've talked about at the start if we agreement that that any Japanese man had helped with his current government any agreement that a that a weapons manufacturing company you'd have with the government all of that stuff have stopped the agreement doesn't stand anymore because there's a new governance in town the old governance is gone and there's a new governance that now calls the shots now I'll venture to say that there would have been some stubborn Japanese men and women and families in the air that weren't going to give up hey don't we know that now life sometimes is some stubborn things but the reality is that you don't you no longer have governance of this land so any agreement you think you had or you think you can do it's gone any occupier of that land that that thinks differently he doesn't have rights anymore like what he used to have because there's a new governance and the land is a new governance now that weapons factory may continue to think he can make them all just keep making them but he's got the whole of the a low force now instead of them attacking the whole of the Pacific the whole of the Ehlo force is going to attack his factory and he won't stand he doesn't have any chance it's like that in our lives to when governance changes in our life there's still stubborn things that think they can hang on but the reality is there's a new governance and as Jesus Christ now this is the Japanese now bring on the next one I just put this in because I this is one of the stubborn men I showed this at the Bible study this man fought for 29 years after World War Two and the Philippines he didn't realize the ward stop you thought they were still at war so he waged his war against the Allied forces for another 29 years he wouldn't accept that the wall was finished a few people meet him and tried to tell him the war's over he wouldn't accept that he thought you're lying you're trying to deceive me you're trying to you know get me from giving up the Philippines so in the end has um commander had to travel there personally and say and issue him orders to say you can now stop fighting so you fought for 29 years sometimes you get stubborn Devils that just think they can hang around and keep going but their their rights to occupy their rights the governor done when Jesus Christ takes over your life next one oh okay now I want to bring this on just a wee bit to try and think about governance okay now Ln gets occupied but it also gets governed now you just look at the New Zealand system we've got governance the new occupation and we if we buy a piece of property we buy the rights to occupy it from the government okay if the government thinks you're okay you can buy it and occupy now with our spiritual end we don't actually own it but because we've got free moral agency we govern our land okay now people say well the devil does well we actually govern our land the issue that we have us when we're born our governance the only governor's that we know I held up with us where a carnal fallen being okay so so the so the way we govern is from that carnal fallen man that hates God that's the facts of it this carnal man hates goddess entity with God it never can come into agreement with God it always has to fight against God that's our natural carnal man and that's what Paul says for to be carnally minded is death but to be spiritually minded is life and peace because the carnal mind is enmity against God well the carnal governance is enmity against God for it is not subject to the law of God neither indeed can be so then they that are in the flesh cannot please God okay so here we are we're born with this carnal governance now the next thing to do when we're like that we set up occupiers in our land people come and ask us cannot occupy it well because we're fighting against God we've got a common enemy that fights against God to which is Satan and all his demons so they come in and they can easily make agreements with us I'll have this piece of land here in occupied yeah sure I'll have this piece yep yep yep so we need all these Devils occupy our land because that's all the carnal man knows he's not going to say to God come and occupy my land he's not going to say that because he is enmity with God so so the only occupies we end up with a devil's that's why you leave a little child on their own leave them to their own devices they will grow up essentially evil without any guidance and a man if he doesn't have any guidance of life will end up essentially evil now we've got we've been tamed in a way by the Word of God within our laws and things like that but and man isn't here at the evil that's why before the flood they got to a point where God said of the people every thought and as heart as evil continually meaning every part of his land is just Devils taking up the whole thing there is no God in the land whatsoever and then the land okay now that's and now our carnal will is the governor so we've let all these things happen so that the and this is a funny thought but the challenge that God issues when he says I want that land I want this land who's he issue when he says I'm going to come and take it over he's got to take over the governance first then he can tell the occupiers where to go he doesn't just hit it the occupiers that he's got to take over the governance now who's the governance me my carnal nature is governing it so who does God start to now i might say fight against what i don't mean to destroy us but who does he have to battle against me my stubborn carnal nature that hates God he's got to start to orchestrate things and we wonder why sometimes and our life things it's time to change they're not as easiest what they used to be things are happening why God's battling against us he starts his war against us carnal nature it hates him he says I've got to get you out of the way I've got to defeat you cuz I want that land I've got a I've got to take over governance of that land because I want that land so God begins this this fight this battle against me my carnal nature it hates them and he starts orchestrated circum says that the things start to get hard but we we fight on anyway and we press on and we battle but then there comes to a point where we're all come down different roads but it comes to a point where we say it just gets all too much and we say I just can't take this anymore now a lot of the times depending on our nature it might be just by love we just think I give up I can't take this anymore but however we are God knows how to best defeat this enemy and it's at a certain point we say lord I give up I surrender and i'm the current governor of this land and I know I've made all these agreements with all these occupiers and sold them all this land and they're all happy dwelling there but the the persistent force of love of God that's coming against us eventually overwhelms us and we give up and we say lord I surrender now just like what the Japanese to the Americans were there's only one agreement that can be made that's a unconditional surrender God doesn't say if we say look I'll surrender this much but I still want to do this okay then let's keep battling against it against you he'll keep battling until you finally say till he has to drop a couple of nuclear bombs you finally say look that's it we've had enough you keep doing it till he say it till you till we give up he did the same thing with Paul Oh Paul was battling battling battling him even God said to and Paul it's hard for you to kick against the pricks this battle you're waging is hard and then Paul Paul gave up all surrendered now this is why eventually when we surrender we say i cede all control over to the new governance and who has that new governance as Jesus Christ I i cede all control over to the new governance of this land and then essentially we become under their governance now this is why Paul said Paul a prisoner of Jesus Christ as I'm not governing this land anymore I'm now a prisoner I'm under this new governance he's surrendered but he agreed to it because he's a we've got free moral agency he agreed to it I agree to surrender and yet there was a force against us that actually wanted our land because remember the most powerful force will get the land that wants it that's the nature of land is a fight and the most powerful one God's always the most powerful us he will always get his own all that the father had given me will come every battle that I wage or one for the land so now Paul becomes a prisoner I'll make it through this now you have been got the situation now as we move on through the process of this land let's go back to the natural now we're going to start from when the children of Israel we're in the land so they crossed over Jordan there in the land now they've kept they've that it's a type of surrender there in there that Holy Ghost there in the land now there was there are going to be three things that are going to hinder this new governance the full possession taking full possession of the whole land there's going to be three things that will hinder it okay sorry about the small words I don't realize how small it would be but the first hang on so the point is you're in the land the new governance is coming and it wants to take get rid of all the current occupiers and make the land fruitful because the promise was here is this land here you're going to possess it plus it's a land flowing with milk and honey you're not just going to possess it you're going to get a lot of benefits from it now when you think about milk and honey those are making types or components to speak of when you talk about land because if you think about milk well to have milk you need sheep and cows and goats and things like that and camels will to have that you need pasture so then they have passed you need nice not a lot of land so that mean comes the milk now to have honey you need flowers any vegetables you need all those sorts of things to have the honey so there might be two small things but it shows that if you can get those two things out of a bland your land is under control and it's bringing forth what it should be if you don't get milk or honey from a land then you obviously your land is covered in bush and scrub and it's not producing anything so if you get milk and honey so now the promise was you'll possess the land but it will be flowing with milk and honey you'll actually bring forth fruit from it okay this there were two things with the promise two components to it now the first thing that would stop things from happening a lack of faith in the promise the second thing that would stop a full possession of getting this would be other inhabitants because remember these other people that are made the agreement with the old government they're all still there they haven't gone anywhere they're all still there when the when the agreement was signed with the Japanese all the soldiers were all still on their battle fronts they were everywhere they were all still there they didn't go away they all stayed there and the devil's such a stubborn guy that he won't even move here just say no I'm staying here you got no right to I don't care it make me leave that's what he's like they're all still there other inhabitants when they crossed over into the land all the other inhabitants are all still there some of them didn't even know the agreement had been made but you know what this land is now changed government's now the third thing is a curse and the land that's a very important factor to take note of in the natural there's a curse actually in the land itself even though it's a promised land it was still cursed it was still going to just bring forth now let's just read this Joshua 1411 says this is caleb speaking and this is talking about his faith in the promise the sources attitude which caused him to move forward and conquer his attitude was and this is after they've been in landed for quite a few got 30 40 years he said as as yet I am as strong this day as I was in the day that moses sent me as my sent me as my strength was then even so is my strength now for war both to go out and to come in now therefore give me this mountain we're of the Lord spoke in the days in that day well they hurt us and that day had the Amalekites thought it and it comes with air and that the cities were great and fenced if so be the Lord will be with me then I shall be able to drive them out as the Lord's sorry for not reading that well but the attitude was God's made a promise and I'm going to go and get it he didn't hold back he said I can do it because the promise has been made so I'm going to press on and go and get it that's the only attitude that works and Christianity God made the promise I'm going to go and I'm going to get it it doesn't work if you say well I made the promise but I don't know if I really can and all that that doesn't work Caleb said God made a promise I'm going to press on and go and get it okay so so for f because if you don't have that that's gonna let would have hundred the children of Israel from Ashley possessing it if they had a lack of faith in the promise because if you have faith in it you'll then go ahead and act on that faith okay you press on that's what a crisp that's why we called soldiers why because we fight we press on my brother it was talking about you know we we've had a hard week but we're here what do you think we're not going to be here no we're here because that's how we operate that's what a soldier does he presses on now number two other inhabitants and number three cursed in the land I want to read Exodus 23 29 God said to the children of Israel I will not drive them out before the in one year less the land become desolate and the beasts of the field multiply against thee by little and little I will drive them out from before thee until thou be increased and in here at the land so now he's talking about these two all together right because he's saying if I just drive them all out there are still less curse in the land that if I take out the current occupants the lamb will just get over growing the vineyards will break down the the animals will all run away the plants flowers will all die the wild beasts will move on the vines will grow everywhere and when you turn up there it'll be a mess it'd be worthless land because it's not under control he had to he had to actually drive the inhabitants out as fast as only as fast as that the children of Israel could go in there and take possession and occupation of it to keep it under control it's a very important principle because all we've got the land well if God drove them all out and they stood on just the side of Jordan the land would have been worthless to them even though they had it all now it's possible that a Christian sometimes gets to that state where he's got the land but it's just overrun and worthless to him we don't want to get to that state but this is very important to our spiritual state of land this is a young stand that went quite easily yep good okay that's a long quote there but I want to read it now this is now talking about the spiritual promised land and I really want to read this quote so just be with me this is brother Barron talking now from a spiritual perspective of possessing that land okay they've never found a better way for a baby to get water once then to cry for it could you give them a balance a junior you're only three days old but now when you want when you want your bottle raise up the spell and ring it see if it works that don't work the baby cries for what he wants that's God's provided way the louder you cried don't whup that the little fella he's only following God's provide away he wants something that's right it's the only way he knows to call his mother scream for it cry for that's right God recommends this for his children God recommends us for his believing children he did not intellectual speeches not some great theology to teach he wants you to cry for your needs that's right cry for it if you're too stiff and starchy you'll never get it if you're ready to lumber yourself up a little and cry God will give it to you he likes the hairs children cry cry your needs to God God wants it that's his provided way cry out for it that's the way the baby cries that's the way he wants you to cry cry how long how long does a baby cry until he gets satisfied and that's the way the believing Christians to do god's child if you see that God made the promise don't give it up cry out till it's answered cry out till you see God vindicate his word when God vindicates his word and proves its here then you don't have to cry no more you gotta walk away and thank him for it until you do that scream out and you get it I like that persistent holding on not a hybrid plant not one that has to be babied and Peter them packed around Christians are real genuine borned articles of God they fight for their position and fight till he finished on this earth every move of it as a fight God told Moses that he'd give him the land he told Joshua every place the sole of your foot treads that I've given you they had to fight for every inch of it so do we fight for every every inch of it it isn't something to be babied and pitted and a round like that and say well I'll take you over there see what you think about it then you pass your opinion that's know where to come come with a determination come that you're going to stay there till it's over stay there until God answers and vindicates a man that believes in God can see the presence of God feel the presence of God sense the presence of God and know he's here so now he's saying when you turn up to this land go for it just be a madman almost seriously that's the way we're supposed to be good at all don't don't sit back and think oh no be aggressive when there's a fight that takes aggression now I know take strategy but at some point it takes aggression it takes determination to fight and that the full position of the land now once you run it receive the Holy Ghost full position it will hinder us if we don't do that that's one of the main things 100 us we don't actually have enough determination to go and get it we can sit back and just leave it or we can and I believe will still be saved but that's not what we're called to do our captain and said go move forward that's what we've been called to do ok now the second thing that will hold us that could hold us back is now these Devils strongholds now what they are as they are all the agreements and everything that we had made before the new governance came in and all complexes and ideas and thought patterns and everything that the devil had put in that he'd been established that he'd established in the land hey maybe he found out that God was after us so what's he going to do build the walls bigger build them bigger do this do that they like me suck their life as much as they can because I can see the army approaching from the north so these all these strongholds of there but they don't have any right to be there once the new governance comes in they don't have any right to stay they don't have their only there because they choose to be there but they don't have a right to stay there they all have to go because there's a new governance in place now this is an important one here the curse and our flesh that we have to recognize is that in our flesh if we just get left our flesh will start to grow get overgrown just like land if you leave land this up there's a curse and the actual land itself that if you just leave it but we'll just get overgrown and the only way that you can ever get that land under control is not to try and teach her or anything but as to subdue it see that when you're coming up I subdue you have dominion over it subdue it that's the only way you can ever get that under control this is why Paul says but I keep my body under subjection lest by any means when I have preached others i myself should be cast away there is no place in the Bible where you can wear it tells us to train our flesh the only thing that ever says to us as subject subject because with on this flesh it's cursed this flesh is actually still cursed the land is actually still cursed it's still cursed so so God actually has to as much as he wants to throw out the enemies in our life he has to make sure that we can actually go and subdue that piece of land that we gained as he throws it out if he just threw it all out and we don't know how to subdue that land and and keep it under control it will just get over grindr we all be in a worse state than we were when we started okay so if you if there's make sure you recognize what does your flesh I don't want to go to church hey that's just your flesh subdue it you know subdue it keep it under subjection these these thoughts that you might think or you might get an asst place where you start to not focus on the lord as much and you start to think these certain ways and you'll think you're really bad no there's just a few weeds coming up from your from your carnal flesh coming up don't let the devil condemn you with that that's just these weeds coming back up just subdue it again so no down that's not me you don't that's the old government you don't have governance here anymore do you remember that you were defeated the old governance is gone because sometimes it throws Christians off you know they or new Christians they think it's them it's it's just the old governance trying to rise up and in him and he's trying to make agreements hey if you get if you go to father he'll start making these old forming old agreements again have you seen that backsliders a backslide than their form old agreements with all these Devils again you know that's what happens but always daily surrender your life to the governance of the Lord Jesus but this this curse in our flesh will never go away until either the rapture or death so just subdue it we're called to subdue it we're called to lay hold on the promise and move forward by faith we're called to possess the land so believe in and face any deal with us and then when we take the land just possess it and subdue it and in that order Nick what if I got okay i'm gonna i'm almost there with this one because i don't want to leave it like it's all just as hard fight slog because the land goes through one more two more cycles before we get to the real promise land that we're after now this natural earth that we have that we see and it is this curse that's just a cursed land but there's two stages that this cursed land is going to go through before it's an it's perfect state again and the first thing is this top six inches of soil brother man talks about is going to be totally burned or maybe more than success it'll go down so deep that it will every bit of any sinner anything that's in this particular globe he's going to just burn it burn it right down and then he's going to make an new heaven and a new earth but he said it's going to be the same one because often thought about when I get my new body what I look like me you know it's a new body so maybe I won't look like me you won't recognize me well I look at the top here and I think well it's going to be the same earth it's not a different earth it's the same with this earth is going to go through a process where the curse of Sun that's in it at the moment that we have to combat and fight against is eventually going to be done away with that whole curse of sin God said I curse the ground for your sake that curse is going to be gone is going to do away with that curse and we're going to get a new earth sea and that there's plenty of scriptures about this is nevertheless we according to his promise look for a new heavens and a new earth wherein dwelleth righteousness I just want to read this quote here from brother Brennan masseuse there you are that's the word of the Lord he promised that it must come and now if you notice how this happens it's beautiful how God does it the bride goes forth with the groom and then after that the wicked is burn with unquenchable fire and the world has been purified reproduces herself everything has to do that has to go through a state of purification volcanic will break forth in this and that great last time the world will burst and bleach and go forth and all those cesspools of sin and all that's upon the earth will be molded into nothing it'll burn with such a fervent heat that it would be like the bleach that sense the color of the ink back to its original creation so will the fire from God be so hot that'll turn every filthy thing back to its conditioning game when Satan and all sinners burned up and everything and then she'll come forth as beautiful as she was in the Garden of Eden that's right he's talking about this natural land that we see every better son that's been occupied upon an every evil thing it's just going to be done away with that whole curse is going to be gone and it's going to be a new heaven and a new earth and there's going to be then life will come forth out of it pure life without any curse you don't have to worry about weeds anymore you're not there to worry about wild beasts overtaking everything it's not going to be that way it's going to be absolutely pure there'll be no not one speck of sin that's the process this natural land is going through at the moment we still have to tame it and subdue it and all that but there'll be a time when we won't have to it'll be absolutely pure and there'll also be a holy city I like this one and John saw the holy city New Jerusalem coming down from God out of heaven prepared as a bride adorned for her husband and I heard a great voice out of heaven saying behold the tabernacle of God is with men and he will dwell with them and they shall be his people and God himself shall be with them and be their God and God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes and there shall be no more death neither sorrow nor crying neither shall there be any more pain for the former former things are passed away and he that SAT upon the throne said behold I make all things new I like that I make all things new this old cursed earth is going to be meeting you next one okay now we get to my scripture that I read at the start this Old Earth is got to go through the same process thus this piece of land here has to go through the same process it's still got this curse on it well though we subdue it and everything it's still got a curse it's still going to go through the same processes that the natural earth went through we've got to have a new pure eternal body we've got to be remade to be new and pure and eternal no no molecule of sin anywhere now there's two ways that we achieve that the way that God achieves it the first way is either as by death when we die but the second way is what we're approaching now is what they call a body change a wrap a body change and that's why secretly says for we know that FA earthly house of this tabernacle were dissolved so they say we die we have a building of God and house not made with hands eternal in the heavens for unless we groan earnestly desiring to be clothed upon with their house which is from heaven with our new house a new pure one but then he talks about behold I show mr. we shall not all sleep but we shall all be changed and the moment in the twinkling of an eye at the last trumpet trumpet shall sound and the dead shall be raised incorruptible and we shall be changed for this corruptible but this cursed land must put on incorruption and this mortal must put on immortality we go through this process now that we go through this change from Mortal to immortal t from corruption to end corruption and maybe those hearing my voice may go through the if the Lord doesn't Terry go through the second one which is the rapture which is a body change and that that is to get rid of the soul do away with this carnal flesh last time that's what it's for to do away with it purifier so then we get our we get our new and new tabernacle and then we are new land has got no Kirsten and it's just a pure perfect land and then we gon dwell in a in the new land us we will come back and dwell here but it won't have the curse of sin that is caught it'll be a new and perfect land I read down to here but I want to read the last one from first when these 15 verses verse 57 but thanks be to God which give us giveth us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ he says therefore my beloved brethren be steadfast unmovable always abounding abounding and the work of the Lord for as much as you know that your labor is not in vain in the Lord i'm looking forward to as much as i enjoy a good fight i'm looking forward to rest but while we're here it's a fight and while we're here we I'm so glad that the Lord said that we will be one and the COS emeka says no longer I that loveth but Christ liveth and me it's no longer me that has to try and strategize and all that I just surrendered his governance and it's and when I say my old man when my old man said I it was i but when the new man says I it's me and Jesus that's the big difference and he's the commander in chief he's the husband so the husband and wife can both say I but the the husband says the direction i like it how the Lord does that I say I but I know it's the Lord it's I surrender to the Lord and that says direction and he will conquer every enemy but don't be scared don't hold back Paul says we're not them that drawback to perdition but then that press on to the saving of the soul we're not we're not ones that just draw back in a scared we're not scared we have been given promises we read in the Old Testament of all the times that God undertook and we can't see one place where it failed so we have to realize how can you fail and a lot of the times all the trials we go through adjust to for us to learn I won't fail trust me trust me press on trust me I won't fail praise the Lord let's um let's um stand up and we'll sing um let's let's just pray as we stand and then we'll sing um the old song we were able to go up and take the country Heavenly Father was so grateful to not today Lord to know that we've surrendered our governance over to you Lord that the only thing that we ever did when we govern things ourselves was make a make a mess of our life Lawton and let any old thing happen in our life and Lord our life was full of misery full of pain full of heartache full of hurt full of confusion full of darkness but Lord we're so grateful that you decided that you wanted us Lord and that you you in spite of us you came down and Lord your overtook us by your great love Lord and those of us here can say like Paul all I'm a prisoner of Jesus Christ well we're happy to be your prisoner we're happy to be serving you were happy to be under your governance at such a wonderful thing or than to to see you just establish our lives Lord into to just cut all those old agreements that that our old man had made and all those Devils just to see you drive out each one of them one at a time little by little you said your drive to mount Lord and to see in our own lives Lord how little by little you're driving these things out lauda maybe continue to be strong and faith as Paul said I've fought a good fight I've kept the faith may that be our testimony lord afford a good fight I've kept the faith Lord we know the fight essentially isn't with each other or anything it's actually with ourselves Lord and the more we surrender to you and overcome ourselves in the more you can work through us Lord to actually achieve things so I just pray your blessing one here bless them and they walk with you Lord may they be encouraged may they go from strength to strength may may your word always get through to our minds Lord and not we get these other
