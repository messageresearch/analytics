thank you praise the Lord I can feel and sits that we are in for a good time this morning I feel like there's anticipation and there's excitement in the air because we're going to meet with the King of Kings amen how are you all feeling you're feeling good feeling ready to praise the Lord amen it's the it's the greatest thing we can do is get into the presence of God amen that's where that's where everything starts and everything ends there all of Faith starts the all of the promises of God start there and all the doubt ends there it's a it's a great transitional place now if you ever go through a hard time you just get in the spirit of God and your circumstance might not change but everything else changes and it makes everything else that it makes the circumstance seem like just become smaller and smaller and smaller as you get into the presence of God and it gives you a peace that passes all understanding you can't understand how maybe an hour ago I was so burdened and worried about something and then an hour later it's all gone and yet the situation may still be even worse than what it was an hour ago and yet it's there's a piece that passes all understanding and I can't work it out but the Bible said it passes my understanding so I don't really try and work it out anyway but we're in for a great time in the Lord this morning um I want to say hi to my mother

so um a fantastic fellowship with them and this song um for quite some time I've been looking at the titles of is it coming up of Brother Bruno sermons and I thought I reckon I could put them into verse one day so um the more um common recognized sermon titles I've managed to put in diverse and I've I've brought it together with the chorus Kumbaya the reason I chose that apart from the fact that it fits but um I think it means you know can you hear or you yeah yeah and Jesus said um Terry you here at Jerusalem until you're from power from one eye and then when the vision came and the top was cut off the the mountain and um brother Brown said stay looking on this so um that's why I find Kumbaya it's very appropriate and you're most welcome to sing the verse with me [Music] [Music] it's a ride seeing all the Sun God and man becoming one [Music] We Have Heard but now we see God is rich in Mercy foreign [Music] foreign [Music] [Laughter] [Music] [Music] why does one dance why do not

God bless you amen hallelujah great to have corbus and Norma back God bless you praise the Lord mum and dad welcome home amen God bless you great to have you amen thank you musicians thanks brother Isaac amen hallelujah who's happy to be a Christian amen today praise God hallelujah amen let's turn to the Bible this morning we're going to go to uh Galatians 2 and 20 we're going to continue on with our um little thought on faith from Wednesday going to take a different direction though because um I just want to ask well I want to make a statement you know faith faith is a condition not an outcome all right it's a condition you're in not an outcome um because I because you know because I mean basically the whole sermon is how how's your stand when everything doesn't seem to go right when prayer is not answered where it seems like your life is going in the opposite direction do you just throw it all in and go on a drunk and a go into the world and whatever or do you just keep walking with God God bless you Kerry great to have you here God bless you my bro welcome amen good to see you good to see you amen so it's basically my whole sermon let's go have lunch amen but you know but but that's the question you know when it seems like nothing God is not answering nothing seems to be happening what's your stand because that's when faith is tested that's actually Faith amen so let's just read this here Galatians 2 and 20. I'm crucified with Christ nevertheless I live yet not I but Christ liveth in me and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God who loved me and gave himself for me amen then we're going to read from Job chapter 13. uh I love this just there's just uh on my mind if you know you know through the week because I was seeing how this you know works in the scripture side and things continue to open up but there's the last last bit that came though he slay me yet well trust him Hallelujah Glory I trust that's your confession amen amen here we go yeah praise the Lord okay so hold your peace let me alone this is job speaking that I may speak and let come on me what will Hallelujah he surrendered into the hands of God Amen wherefore do I take my flesh and my teeth and put my life in thine hand see well why should I why should I put my life in your hand that made he's talking to his uh his friends we say that a very you know anyway um though he slay me yet will I trust in him and but I will maintain my own ways before him he also shall be my salvation for an hypocrite shall not come before him amen so let's just bow heads in a word of prayer this morning amen gracious Heavenly Father we're so thankful we can come before your presence today Lord not by our abilities or anything we have done Lord but what but by what you have done Lord because what you have done that down Calvary that's what matters Lord Jesus so so thankful we can look by faith To You O God we're so thankful we can just relax in your presence oh God let off the pressure and praise you I pray dear God you'll anoint your word Lord as we've read your great Eternal Word Lord we know your word meets every condition and every age so I pray Lord may just come and speak to our hearts like only you can and may you raise is our faith May stabilize our faith Lord may you grant It For Your Glory May birth all those who are streaming this morning as well Lord May bless them and touch them oh God we love you so much you may meet every need Lord according to your riches and Glory we commit Our Lives into your hands May blood cover all of us oh God that only your spirit can operate in our midst Lord please may you grant it in Jesus Christ's name amen amen God bless you friends you can have your seats this morning so that's the statement I want to make is that faith is a condition not a outcome because many people say well you know I prayed and I got faith and therefore everything's fine but what happens when it seems like prayer is not answered does that mean you have no faith you know because real Faith holds on to the word of God no matter what happens it's actually irrelevant on the answer Faith isn't based on God answering prayer amen because that means he's just an errand boy to you that means he's just well he does what you want so therefore you serve him now he actually in your mind he's serving you but if you serve him doesn't matter what comes what goes you love him anyhow see and that is real faith faith has got to be tested everything must be tested love true love is tested amen but it comes through as gold right faith has got to be tested everything must be tested the greatest militaries in the world have been tested the greatest generals have been tested and if they're really great generals they win the campaign right so so it's not those who just sit in the classroom and say well yes I'm the best and blah blah blah blah and theory and all those things it's when it's put into practice put into manifestation that's really proves you know what's what's going on or not now can I still drive cool I can still drive all right so you know it's amazing how you read through the book of Acts you know they here they are preaching here and they come to this place they come to Iconium and Antioch in different places and they're confirming the souls of the disciples and exhorting them to continue in the faith basically don't leave the faith you know it doesn't matter what happens stay in the faith of the word of God and that we must through much tribulation enter into the kingdom of God yeah I wonder I wonder how much you know these days do we really emphasize sure you become a new believer right amen the Lord saved you on Calvary you know he's washed you in your blood but now you've got great tribulations are going to come you know you've got to look at really the greatest battles come when you really meet the Lord you know when you look at the children of Israel when they went from Egypt into the promised land where were all their battles they had a few battles in the desert battles when they crossed Jordan enter the promises of God that's when the enemy came and actually the enemy found them in a lot of cases it wasn't them finding the enemy so amen so when so when trial after trial Comes Trouble after I mean you're actually walking in the right way hello you're actually on the right course praise the lord it's not actually the other way around because remember fear is not like a bug spray that keeps bugs away it's not a mozzie repellent right that keeps Devil's way faith is not that actually Faith brings trouble Hallelujah Faith brings tribulation praise God why because God wants to prove in your life that your faith is genuine amen that it's actually the real deal that you actually have the goods I mean so if Trouble Comes and you go on a drunk or go on drugs or go on the world or whatever just you know many people they say well you know people get bitter at God this day and age well I asked God this he didn't do it so I'm just not going to serve him anymore they never had Faith to begin with that's not real Faith they just wanted God to do something for their own selfish slaves no that's not Faith that's just people just say well well if he's really real God prove yourself and he made the you know people walk over Blades of grass they look at his spoken word that they live in amen God made the body that they're alive in and they say well God you really here prove yourself to me and it's creation speaks amen that that he is alive so through much tribulation we'll enter into the kingdom of God praise God the gospel is the same every every age doesn't matter how much technology and Comforts we have through Great Tribulation we're going to enter in amen but true Faith looks beyond the now and looks to the End Amen so I trust amen if you know if this is a quiet service it's fine I don't mind I've been enjoying this thought this week amen so you know so so we'll have tribulation amen we won't faith is not does not take trouble away it brings trouble but it overcomes the trouble amen see now Jesus would say these things have I spoken unto you that in me you might have peace in the world you shall have tribulation this is the these are the words of our Lord Jesus you're going to have tribulation in this world man's man's days of a few but full of trouble I think job said praise God but be of a good cheer for I've overcome the world Amen so you're you're going to have trouble you're going to have hardship you're going to have times where all you see in your bank account is zeros and if you have an overdraft there may be a negative before there but you know you'll have trouble in this world you'll have it seems like you know you'll be praying for something it seems like the answer doesn't seem to come but you know Faith worketh patience and that patience is patience with God Godly patience is patience with God that he will answer in his time now when I go through these things don't swing the opposite way and say what's the point of praying what's the point of seeking God no if you have faith you will seek him right if he if he'd become real to you seek him with over with your heart you're pressing the more trouble just drives you towards God Amen that's what it should do trouble should not drive us away from God if it does drive us away there's something wrong with our experience right but if we really know him trouble actually harnesses actually it's like God I mean brother bam said that it's like a bit in a bridle and a horse's mouth that actually stares us to a trouble stares us towards God Hallelujah and and you know if you're going through trouble you've actually found favor with God you know I you know you know you know the youth just sang I see the evidence of your goodness all over my life many times the world will take that while I'm blessed I got this big fancy car multi-room house and all these Blessings Now many times physical blessings were what we call blessings is not actually God's blessings no it just takes people just think it's you know this is an age of prosperity but you know you think about Jesus he was homeless yeah our Messiah was homeless he didn't have a big fancy house he didn't have a palace to live in he said a fox have dense birds have their nest son of manners nowhere to lay his head and and and this day and age Christians would look at him and say he's not good with his finances all right obviously he doesn't have the character he's not a good Steward you know the whole parable of the stewardship sure there's money involved but actually it's actually the gifts the talents in your life it's actually you it's actually what's in you it's not money because God is not good we're not going to stumble with a great white Throne judgment and then he's going to say well let's look at your bank account let's look at your Investments you know and okay well we're entering the joys of the Lord because you didn't know the gospel doesn't go forward by money the gospel goes forward by the by the anointing of the Holy Ghost as the spirit of God that packs the gospel look at the first church they had nothing but look what they did amen and yet we think we need a lot of money in the bank account to do any kind of mission no if God puts it on someone's heart then God will furnish the ability to do it I mean that's the main thing is the spirit of God that makes the gospel go forward amen so he's not going to give we don't have we won't give an account on how well we used our money sure we should be wise and all those things okay don't go don't go penduluming right now okay sure we must be wise with those things but God is not going to make us give an account on our finances how many houses we own our cars whatever more no it's the gift the talent in your life did you bury it because you're afraid of God or did you actually allow him to use the gift because we're all gifted people right we all have a gift we may not all be preachers or singers or musicians or whatever more but we all are gifted to let him let him amen draw dividends from what he's deposited in you here's job and here's his uh friends here they've come to accuse him basically you're a sinner and this is why trouble's gone on and you know but Joe Joe was job was a great man he didn't understand what was going on you know God does not give us a schedule for the day he doesn't give us a schedule for the year saying now in June this is going to happen and this one's going to break their leg and this trouble is going to come in and there's going to be this disagreement in the family and in the church and you know he doesn't do that because if we knew every day we wouldn't need Faith to walk through the day see Faith gives us the ability to walk to look Beyond right that's real Faith so job didn't job had didn't get a text on his phone saying from God listen I just had a testimony time with the devil and testified about you and you're a perfect man and this is what's going to happen to you Joe no job's living his little old life going on his Merry Old way and then he gets messenger after Mr came these ones died these people died by the way your children are all dead you know he lost everything apart from his wife but the thing is he says though he slay me yet I'll trust in him that was his testimony he didn't know where he was going to end up he didn't know God was going to restore double he had no idea the outcome of this trial was him he said though he slay me I'm going to trust him anyway and that is real Faith now this is a man under the blood of bulls and goats he had no he doesn't have the Holy Ghost amen he doesn't have the blood of Jesus Christ to cleanse him of his sins to change his nature he doesn't have thousands of years of testimonies and you know God living through people and things that he could draw from don't know if he had a bible to read to never treasure to go to I don't know but yet he said though he like me I'm going to trust him amen and to me this is overcoming Faith amen though everything goes terrible everything goes bad I'm trusting God I'm not going to become an unbeliever I'm not going to turn my back on God and try and ignore him because I'm upset with my little thing I'm going through I'm going to praise God anyway Hallelujah that's how we should be amen I I really believe that's how we should be Hallelujah praise God see so job was in this case see but he didn't he didn't know that God had testified to Satan that this is a perfect man there's none like him in all the Earth wouldn't you like your God to testify about you like that you see that one Satan I've got to point out one of my Jewels I'm proud of this one she's the best he's the greatest he's there's none like them in all the Earth actually Satan go through all of history there's been unlike them upon the Earth they're perfect why but why was job perfect because he had perfect faith in the blood of the Lamb that's what made him perfect it wasn't his wisdom wasn't as rich as wasn't his family wasn't those things because he had perfect faith in the blood of the Lamb because he had faith that what God had made required him to do he did in faith and it's the same thing what makes us perfect is not our ability it's not our tall or short or white or thin or whatever color we are it's none of those things it's not our personality it's because we're perfect faith in the blood of the Lamb got a natural lamb but the Lamb of God right that's what makes us perfect Hallelujah so therefore we should just say Satan look at my lamb stop looking at me you're looking at the wrong person Hallelujah praise God basically job didn't understand what was going on but he said though he slay me hey if I die praise God I'm still going to believe in him I'm not moving from my position amen CeCe we should have a stand and that's it I'm serving God no matter what happens I'm not going to go off on it see job didn't go off on some tantrum you know he didn't he didn't he didn't he didn't leave church he didn't quit being a Believer didn't quit Fellowship he didn't go into the world didn't do no he says I'm staying right here I don't understand what's going on this makes no sense to me but yet here I am this is how we should be that's real faith I'm talking about I'm talking about substance Faith that's unmovable it doesn't doesn't move with opinion or how you're feeling you're feeling happy praise God feeling down praise God feeling all mush in her heart whatever praise God anyhow family's doing good praise God family's not going good praise God finances are good praise God no finances praise God food on the table praise God no food praise God hallelujah no holiday praise God holiday praise God whatever it is praise God it's like a default setting of a Believer praise God none of these things will move me I'm gonna stay right here I'm being a Believer doesn't matter if he answers me or not you know I came to a conclusion years ago he's already done too much for me but we never do another thing for me in my entire life I'll praise Him anyhow because he's already done so much how long do you think of the Saints of the ages the things that God did for them maybe one or two things their whole life and God comes service after service day after day speaks to our hearts Paul's blessing upon blessing upon us answers prayer heals the sick amen saves the lust does incredible things time and time in this little room and they praised him for one thing and we get down to the dumps because you know help us Lord help us just to be here's our trajectory Hallelujah praise God see could you imagine job and Joan being broke out with boils all these things gone losing all his wealth and children everything it wasn't very easy but God was going to prove to Satan he had somebody he could put confidence in maybe he's trying to do the same thing in your case and the rest of you see he see God is trying to prove to Satan he's got confidence and see he had God had confidence in job right God did not set job up to fail God actually had confidence in Job that God is gonna that job is gonna though he has no idea what's going on this is the worst time of his life ever ever ever ever ever he's still going to say though he slam me yet I'll trust him right and see God has to have see every generation God has someone on the earth he has confidence in I try to say Lord I believe you got confidence in me Hallelujah sure he's got confidence in his salvation but remember we've got a free will what are we going to do if we're of real Faith we're going to stay there on the word of God Hallelujah see Oh They'll forsake you oh no job see he couldn't they couldn't make job do that no sir he oh he was only trying to prove them Hallelujah now see many times we forget who's in our boat see he said he'd never leave us nor forsake us and that's not just when he's talking that's when he's silent see many times God sometimes God will allow us to feel like he doesn't care like we're an orphan child that everyone's forsaken us but that's when faith is proven right because because you've got to realize Yo God you know it should be with us in the Lord basically Lord I'm on your hands I'm your problem I'm not going anywhere else I'm you you are in charge of me I am your responsibility Lord I'm not leaving I'm staying right here I'm gonna bother you I'm going to annoy you God here I am whatever comes whatever goes see that's your beat see that's faith faith is unmovable Hallelujah so you remember in a few minutes oh you you have little faith this is Jesus winning when he comes the storm when he's in the boat couldn't you understand about the breaking and the feeding of five thousand don't you know I'm the same Jehovah that fed them for 40 years out there in the wilderness out of ovens out of heaven when I poured it out every night what are you so scared about don't you know I dried up the Red Sea one day don't you know I opened up the Earth swallowed the unbeliever one day I measured the Earth and spurred it off out into space Yonder and he's in the ship now it's that's not mythical that's truth yes see isn't he great Jehovah God we could stand here for a while I'd run out of life and my body to go through everything God's ever done isn't he the same today is he the same God that saved you years ago isn't it the same God that provided back then he'll provide today as anyone that healed you when you were sick when you were troubled he gave you peace isn't he the same Jehovah God right now isn't he the same God or the prophet is here right now this morning the same one in the ship is the same one right here has he not proven himself over and over and over over again that he's faithful and true that he's more than able to keep his word has he proved himself he's he's God has overproved himself hey you know some people like some kids on the sports with that look at me dad I can do this and after the 50 millionth time I know you can do it Glory but God does that I want to prove myself to you it's not see he's not just satisfied with him being a god of the past to you no he wants to be God of the present to you see the same God that lived back there he wants to live in your life to prove himself to you he loves to prove his word amen he's not afraid of the challenge he comes against he is unconquerable Hallelujah he is undefeated he's the Undisputed champion of the world Amen by trust in your heart he is that to you hallelujah sister why are we so afraid about what are we getting scared about oh he's not answering my prayer how do you know he's not answering your prayers see many times we give God a list of this is how I want this answered Lord this would be so cool Lord if you did it X Y and Z and he just said no no no no I'm going to do it ABC see and then we oh God didn't hear my prayer yeah he did and he's working but our eyes need to be opened to see actually God answers according to his good pleasure not our good pleasure his good pleasure you see it's not see it's not Lord may my will be done in heaven and is it on Earth no it's Lord may your will be done in earth as it is in heaven right so that's how we should be it's not well God you didn't do it how I want therefore I'm going to quit no that's not Faith amen that's right amen see see same now he tries to prove us and see where we'll we will stand or not praise the Lord take a Revival away start an argument in the church just to see what you'll do turn Satan loose among you among you and see how you'll stand remember Satan has to ask permission from God before he can ever come near you see Satan had to ask God about job can I do this yes you can you can take his family do all these things don't just touch him and Satan couldn't go beyond those parameters of what God Said right and then next time Satan comes up well Satan said well the only reason he still loves you is because he's got his health so God said you can you just can't take his life so he went to the very Nth Degree but Satan could not go over the boundaries of what God had said him to do amen so we've got to realize when Trouble Comes In God gave permission for the trouble wow Hallelujah when sickness strikes God gave permission for the sickness wipers do you love God because you are just healthy or do you praise him when you're sick do you love him in the down times as well as the up Hallelujah because remember fruit life is not produced on the Mountaintop amen it's down in the valley where the Orchards and all the everything grows and there's a life and everything so it's in the hard times life Fruit is produced praise God for the hard times hallelujah amen see we just can't lose you can't lose being a Christian say this is not my kind of service well I think we need these kind of services you know because faith is tested Hallelujah I remember when I so and so an American Samoa this is years ago now I was working on a building site and when they pour concrete that that take two cylinders of that concrete and on day three and day something that put it in a pressure tester and it had to be above a certain pressure before it broke if it didn't I mean if it broke under that pressure then I mean I mean lower than the specified pressure they had to pull the concrete out and pour it again it's like Faith it's got to be tested yeah it's genuine yeah it's real faith and it's actually genuine Faith like our opening scripture says Paul said the life I now live I live by the faith of the Son of God so God's own faith comes into you by the baptism of the Holy Ghost it'll stand every test it'll stay you can't break it you can't crunch it you can't tear it it's indestructible Hallelujah so God will allow all these things to happen Mommy amen and it's why to prove our faith praise God hallelujah this is basically my whole sermon I'm just going to go over this time and time because you've got to look at your life say when trouble strikes what do I do do I turn to God do I praise him in the trouble or do I get down in the dumps and have a pity party what do I do do I become all shelled up and insular and ever it's all everyone's else's fault or do you love the Lord the same amen because God hasn't changed God is the unchanging God he doesn't change based on Seasons or weather or trouble or Prosperity no he's the same God Amen remember he loves us all the same see his love his love is not shown like a parent's love to a child her parents love to a child is is a love that tries to protect him from trouble right you know have you ever seen your kids out there saying get hurt today go break a leg go have some trouble have a hard day we love you no that's not appearance love you want to keep them from all those things do you know amen but God's love is not shown that way and people misunderstand us love his love is shown by election right Jacob have I loved any sort of our haters before they're both born he loved one and didn't love the other one his love is shown an election right so with it so he so you know he loves you because he elected you he predestinated you he called you he justified you right he's glorified you already that's how you know he loves you he'll allow you to go through trouble praise God because he wants to prove himself in the trouble right see We're Not Gonna what what are we gonna praise God about in glory be we're going to praise him because Lord that great trial in my life you brought me through the trial that great sickness in my family and my life you brought me through the sickness Lord in the silent times you were still God I can look back you will praise him because of those moments amen I was lost but then I was found so I praise you because now you're my savior right we will praise him out of experience right because testimonies are an experience you go through right but it's God's hand in the testimony that counts hallelujah amen that's what we'll Praise Him for we won't praise him out of theory well this is a good song let no every song we sing that means something is because we've been through what the song is singing Hallelujah praise the Lord Amen to heal to all these things now praise the Lord every son that comes to God must be chastened and corrected right we we don't have a flower bed of these people amen see and so it's a brother bam dramatizes speaking of adoption or that because adoption in the Bible is the placing of a son or a daughter in a position of power and authority in the family right that's what adoption is amen it's not taking someone who's not part of the family bring them into the family now you're part of the family no we are adopted or positionally placed in the body of Christ hallelujah praise God now look at this he says yep sure said the Holy Ghost I give him tests boy I tried him this way I tried him that way I throwed him down Sick I mean put him under I stopped him I let the devil do everything I could to him he'd just come right back up again he come just up the same see come up again this is Faith see yeah I mean there's all drum times but it's like look I let Satan against him I stomped him I allowed him to get sick he just bounced right back praise God anyhow hallelujah hallelujah how are you before the trial hallelujah how are you after the trial hallelujah hallelujah plus because I've been through the trailer amen I've got another verse on my song praise God hallelujah amen now no one likes trials I mean let's be honest you know we don't love no one likes well some people like pain but they need prayer I think you know but people in their rational mind do not like pain no one lines up for pain oh yeah good yeah break my arm oh well that's one no no one signs up for that stuff rationally right but you see trials are good for us because it brings us forth as gold that brings us forth as deity amen that's what gold represents hallelujah amen just like many of the things in the Tabernacle in the wilderness they were covered with beaten gold amen so it's not just Christ as was beaten he was bruised you know all those things but also represents us as well yeah oh amen why we we're actually in a veil of humiliation this body amens regard to mold and shape us into His Image see the Way Up Is Down see the way up is not Prosperity everything goes fine no the way up is through trials and hardship and tribulation but God if you have real faith will take you through them all amen you say well I failed in a lot of Trials that's fine get back up you know well I actually had a pity party the other week that's fine just get back up amen say Lord I'm still on your hands I'm still walking forward sure I failed you many times but remember a champion doesn't stay down a champion gets back up amen so though man the Bible says Falls many times as him that gets back up you want to be an overcomer just get up I mean the devil knocks you down get up even your own Humanity you actually so annoyed at your own self just get back up say Lord I'm walking on I'm not staying in the dust I'm getting up Hallelujah praise the Lord amen I made him sick I'd done this I throwed him in the hospital took him out here I've done this I've done that I turned his wife against him I turned his neighbor against him I turned everything that didn't make a bit of difference said though he slay me yet I'll trust him I killed his family I took this I did this I'd done this I did all this other still he stood right up though he slay me and I'll serve him he's mine hell is he see this should be an attitude though hardship after trial after bad times come we're not leaving I'm not leaving the word Lord I'm not leaving you I'm on your hands amen you turn around God I'm still there I mean you try and walk away from me I'm still there Lord I'm following you whatever's going on in life Lord I'm walking with you all the way Hallelujah that's real faith Hallelujah yes like you see like some kind of superhero and a sidekick the sidekick is a real psychic is always there God's more than a superhero and we're more than Sidekicks right but we should be wherever he is there I am oh it's you again yep Lord here I am what are we doing today praise God you can't get rid of me though whatever Trouble Comes see that's real faith how's your faith today Hallelujah am I looking a bunch of Overcomers today Hallelujah but you see faith is not faith throws it in see we've got to come to a place and everyone I believe will where you go through a trial and you want to quit but you can't quit you go through a hard spot in life you think I'm just going to throw it all away I'm just going to hit the demolition button let the whole thing blow up and I'm just walking away but there's something in you that just can't do it I mean you what is that that is Faith and you realize it's not you holding on to God there's actually God holding on to you oh look at now that's real overcoming when you realize when you think man this this is not worth it I've wasted my time God's not real he doesn't care about me I'm just going to throw it all in and you can't you want to say it I Quit I'm done see you bye but it's like the word just can't get out what is that that's Faith saying you can't do that because it's not us holding on to God see it's not us oh Lord I've got to hold on to another day and give me strength to hold on to you no no it's God holding on to us it's God that keeps us in the hard times as God that keeps us in the good times God keeps us through trouble God it's God see we won't see there'll be nothing that we can boast in on that day remember salvation is by grace alone not by works list any man should boast there'd be no actually part of us that says look what I did God look what you did God that's my life that's what's going to be praise the Lord Hallelujah when you've done all you can do when you've come through the prayer line and been prayed for your heart doesn't condemn you you're living right with God just hold on to it God has to answer he's testing you if you turn loose the next morning say well I'm no better I guess there's nothing to it then you didn't have faith to begin with see Faith holds on even though the answer is not there it seems but Faith worketh patience patience with who with God amen so you know you've got faith if you've got patience amen right that's real that's that's the proof you have faith see this is an instant world all the answers are instant you can get every answer whatever Touch of a button but God hasn't changed just because technology just poured it out right so if you've got real Faith then you have real patience and it doesn't upset you you don't get mad at God it's never his fault that's one thing that's not in a Christian's vocabulary is it's God's fault this is the reason I'm in this state is because he did X Y no it's never God's fault and if you're seeing it that way you're not looking through eyes of Faith you need to readjust your glasses or your binoculars refocus on the word or all your contacts or whatever it is you just got to refocus actually saying Lord you've allowed this because you want to show yourself in this Hallelujah maybe because what faith always looks for God on every hand praise the Lord see if you've got real faith you'll hold on to the last breath has gone from your body you're certain that God is God for he that cometh the God must believe that he is and a rewarder of those that diligently seek him Hallelujah now brother Brown would tell a story of a woman she was married to a colonel or something in the military and and they were stationed in Germany they had a little baby and the baby was sick and was going to die and actually died and they were Believers and they actually um called for brother Brown to be flown over to Germany to um to to to pray for the baby because they'd seen him do Mighty things I think I think the father of the child was um Julia stanscliffe that wrote the book prophet of South Africa I might be wrong but you know but they'd seen God do many things and they asked and the military is actually going to fly brother Byron from America to Germany to to to pray for the baby and brother Brown went to pray before he got on the plane and the Lord said no this is my hand this is my hand and so now the parents of course are naturally upset here's your baby and now your baby's dead and you're believing it's going to be raised right real Believers believe for anything amen we don't limit God for nothing right but then there came to a point where later they came back to America and they met up and so there's now the mother saying and now when she came over to see us that night left her at the house when I left yesterday she said what was it brother bear my weakness of Faith see this is what always comes through our minds if it seems that prayer is not answered my faith wasn't strong enough to get the promise not necessarily it's God is answering a different way see faith will receive whatever answer God gives amen sure we we believe for Supernatural healings do we not we've seen them amen We Believe for God to do the miraculous we've seen it many times it means I'm not saying don't think I'm preaching unbelief this morning I'm trying to preach a stability into our lives that no matter how God answers if he does or not we still believe and we don't we don't get disheartened we don't get discouraged but we keep pressing the battle anyway amen so she being thinking what was the week was it the weakness of my faith and now my brother said no you have great faith so many times we think well God didn't answer therefore I didn't have the faith for the answer no if you have the Holy Ghost you're full of faith because you're full of God Amen right Hallelujah you have great faith you prayed for your baby you and your husband held on to it God to raise that baby and he refused to do it because he knowed what's best and still you love him see that is that's real Faith though the answer may be contrary to what you want you still love him anyhow you don't get mad you don't build up a complex against God don't build up a grudge don't get resentful you love him anyhow see David would be in prayer for his son that he had with Bathsheba the child was going to die right and he was fasting and praying and seeking God but then when the word came that the baby died what did he do he washed himself changed his clothes went into the temple and praised God anyhow see that was real Faith Hallelujah praise God anybody when mountains are moving and things can have faith amen see see it's very easy to have faith when we're in a camp kind of service and God's moving empowering people's lives are being touched it's easy to believe in that kind of an atmosphere but what about when that atmosphere is not there what about when we're going through day-to-day life and there's troubles and hardship and it seems like Lord where's the answer to this right because that's when faith is proven amen but let it go backwards one time and see how it works that's when you can prove whether you've got faith or not I mean so if things are going backwards do you still believe anyhow do you still love him anyhow do you worship Him anyhow see that's real faith praise the Lord Hallelujah see faith is a state of being not an outcome let's say in Hebrews chapter 11 but these all died in faith speaking of The Heroes of Faith they died in faith see it's having it having faith did not dictate their outcome amen you look at a lot of the Believers Through the Bible they didn't have a Victorious well what we would call a full of Faith outcome they got sick they were destitute tormented Afflicted of whom the world is not worthy but they all died in faith why because God revealed himself to them because remember faith is a revelation it's not something you work out it's not something that you put one plus one equals two no it's God reveals the word is true to you and then you act on that word and that is Faith it's not something you try and stimulate amen whether you say what's the point of praying and singing and things it's to create an atmosphere of faith for God to anoint your faith and make the word come to pass that's why you seek Him do you not see mentally you can read a promise in the Bible but when you want that promise to be confirmed whether you seek the Lord in prayer about that scripture and he anointed to you and it becomes a revelation it goes from a nice idea to a revelation when it's a revelation you know that it's done you may not see the outcome you may not know when but you know it's done you can rest in it and you go from seeking God for it to happen to praising God it's happened Hallelujah but if it's just in your mind you think well I think this will work I hope this is going to happen yes this is going to happen because I've worked this out that's not Faith that's just a mental idea we need the word to Anchor and to hear amen by Revelation see these all died in faith not having received the promises but seeing them are far off were persuaded of them and embrace him confess that they were strangers and pilgrims on the earth they for they that say such things plainly declare that they seek a country and truly if they had been mindful of that country from which they came out they might have had opportunity to have returned see someone who's really received faith their old life is gone it's dead they can't go back the bridges have been blown up there's no Crossing back there's no u-turn right but they say they're plainly seeking a country and that country is a Heavenly land amen see see but now they desire a better country that is and Heavenly wherefore God is not ashamed to be called their God for he hath prepared for them a city see real Faith looks beyond this life and says I know where I'm going I mean you've heard from your theophany amen you've heard from your Eternal Body you know you have one waiting in the heavens already like the Apostle Paul said that's what faith declares and if you've had a revelation that that is so Glory what does it matter if life has gone good or bad or indifferent what really is the Troubles of Life compared to that what you already have over there see it should give us such a stability if God has called you by his word he didn't call you to leave you remember this message is an individual call to the marriage supper of the Lamb right of and and if the word is quickened into your heart the reason that has happened is because you have a place at the table Glory Hallelujah I mean can't we just Rejoice then you're there I have a place I don't know what my name what because I don't think we'll speak English in heaven and we all say praise God but whatever my name is written there but I have a place setting that's mine Hallelujah and I know it's there because I've heard from it Glory so what really matters sure we'll get stressed and worried and troubled that's why David's will say when my heart is overwhelmed lead me to the rock that is higher than I because God knows we're still these in these frail bodies he knows we'll get times when we'll feel overwhelmed that's normal if you don't feel overwhelmed in Life or trouble any kind of emotion there's something wrong with you you've become detached from your emotions and that's very very unhealthy you need to be connected you need to feel you know your heart is not just a muscle that pumps blood it's your seat of your emotions right you should be in touch with your spirit come on you should be able to feel happy you should be able to feel sad you should be able to feel worried love all the range of emotions but with hatred only against the devil you know what I mean but but we shouldn't be see but David's here when my heart is over well and Lead Me To The Rock that's higher than I what is that rock God is our Rock he's that rock of Revelation so when you feel all overwhelmed you say Lord lead me to the rocks and Lead Me To My Testimony lead me to you what you've done in my life in the past and what does that do it actually makes us feel less overwhelmed yeah I mean because we say God to deliver there he's faithful and true back then he's faithful and true now he delivered me there he delivered me here he answered me there he'll answer me here how he does it that's up to him the details the problem the you know the details is his left but he is faithful and true there he cannot change his faithful and true here what happens then we start we the the overwhelmingness of situations go down praise God aren't you glad we have a rock you can go to go don't go to yourself help books go to your rock Hallelujah now many times Well actually 100 of the time our Christian walk we would never ever imagine it would go the way it's gone or is going right if you yeah that's what we should do maybe someone comes meets the Lord now write down what you think you're Christian what gonna be and then five years later read it you say I'm so wrong I should have just put the opposite just thinking you know but many times we have a have an idea how things are going to happen now John the Baptist Jesus Jesus gave him the greatest compliment after this but then John gave him the actually the probably the worst kind of uh uh attitude towards them that you could give anyone see John was ordained to to introduce the Messiah right but then he got to a pla but he never thought no doubt in his life that he would end up like this he had he would never have fathomed in his wildest nightmares that a little girl would dance at a feast and that would cause his head to be taken off her shoulders and he'd be in prison you see but many times life can end up this way but was God displeased with John did John do anything wrong did he did he introduce the wrong Messiah did he get caught up in the scribes and the Pharisees and the religious movement of the day no he stood true to his calling right he stood true to his calling but you see his life got to a point he actually said I'm he must increase speak of the Messiah and I must decrease he didn't realize this was the decrease this was actually what he you know and so there he is he's in prison and then brother Brahms his eagle eyes begin to film over why because he doesn't understand what's going on and how often we can get to a position like this but then now you see and it came to pass that when Jesus had made an end to commanding his twelve disciples he departed things to teach and to preach in their cities now when John had heard in the prison The Works of Christ he sent two of his disciples and he said unto him art thou he that should come or do we look for another what up what a thing you think it wasn't that long before this there was John saying Behold the Lamb of God that takes away the sin of the world and he was double sure he was the Messiah right and then God came down your incredible the the whole purpose of his life upon the Earth had been manifested because he introduced the Messiah to the people but then he got put in prison and now he's asking this question did I really do what I was called to do see situations can begin to Cloud over our mind Jesus answered said unto them go and show John again those things which ye do hear and see the blind received their sight the lame walk the lepers that cleans the deaf here the dead are raised up and the poor have the gospel preach to them and blessed is he whosoever shall not be offended in me so John you're blessed if you're not offended because you ended up here yeah yeah see we should not get offended that our Christian walk takes us into some dark prison sometimes see it wasn't it wasn't because God wasn't punishing John he wasn't displeased with John he said there's actually no greater man born of a woman than John the Baptist he said he said he's actually greater than all the prophets of the Old Testament as John why because John was the breach between the Old Testament and the new amen because after John what happened the kingdom of God was going to be preached and people were going to be born into the kingdom by the Holy Ghost which never happened in the Old Testament under the blood of bulls and goats see so John was in this position and Jesus gave him the greatest compliment that that God could ever give her believer he said there's not he said look you've got your you've got Moses Elijah all the ones the other in the Old Testament this man's greater than the more you see but John was stuck in prison saying this is not right what is going on see we should not be offended that last verse there we should never get offended at God because life seems to be going through a certain way no God wants to prove himself and you think about it if you came to a point in your life you realize my mission on Earth is done what God has sent me to fulfill has been fulfilled when you just raise your hand and say thank you Jesus thank you Lord that you allowed me to be surrendered to your word that my part of the book has been manifested that you don't have to push me and pull me and throw me around to get it done by actually I was willing say Lord here I am remember he was he was 30 years prepared for a six-month Ministry six months that's all he had he was like an orchestra where the guy picks up the big symbols he goes push once in the whole orchestra that was John he had the main fiddle party he wasn't the main leader different things he just picked up the symbols and went bush and they sat back down but wouldn't that be a pleasing thing just as long as you know you're in the orchestra just as long as you know you're playing the sheet music Hallelujah maybe maybe your your purpose in life was fulfilled years ago wouldn't that be satisfying that'd be satisfying to me praise God I've done what you've wanted me to do Lord upon the Earth Hallelujah now I'm just going into overtime just praising you amen if you never use me again that's fine Lord I'm here for you whatever you want me to do Hallelujah amen see if we think about it that way how can we get offended just love the Lord amen hallelujah but you see many people who don't have the right kind of Faith they look at success in many different ways that's success that is Success right there to the world that is failure no that's success Hallelujah but you see some people get so caught up in what they call success now Paul would get to a position where he's writing to Timothy and he would begin to say they're all men have forsaken me and he's and he's come down to the end of his Road he's in prison he's going to get his head cut off and all that your troubles and things and some people begin to think that he he got washed up God wasn't happy with him anymore and he would say for demons hath forsaken me having loved this present world and departed under thessalonica accessories to Glacier Titus unto Dalmatia see only Luke is with me take Mark and bring him with thee for he is profitable for uh to me for the ministry and uh takius have you say that have us into Ephesus the cloak that I left at trolls uh with Corpus when thou cometh bring with thee and the books especially the parchments see here was Paul he was a church age messenger hey God lived in great power in his life and he's come down to a spot which says uh bring the cloak I'm cold yeah he's calling for a particular cloak he's in prison all Minneapolis he says Demas had forsaken him now Demas Demas was a Godly Man brother M said he was Spirit-filled that he didn't just forsake Him and go into the world no but he thought that he thought that Paul Paul had become washed up and he's beginning to reason saying why has God allowed Paul to get to the state where he's actually calling for another cloak and he's in prison and all this trouble's gone on WE we've seen so much power in his life it's like God doesn't use him anymore see he had the wrong kind of faith towards Paul he was looking at what he considered success which was miracles signs and wonders no true success is staying with the word of God because there's many false anointed out there that boast in their miracles and wonders but are they on the word no they're not so true success is staying with the word of God amen see he says no I don't imagine Demas um didn't forsake Him and start off to nightclubs I don't imagine Demas did that because Demas was a Spirit-filled man he was a great helper if he ever took the history of Demas he was a notable preacher a fine cultured man highly polished educated he was a smart man but why would he forsake Paul that's the thing what made him do it for Saint Paul I don't believe he wanted to go to a nightclub or anything but I believe it was God separating Paul now let's take a summer demas's thoughts as I was sitting down on the hillside wondering the other day about daylight I was thinking why would Demas want to leave that fellow what would make him leave that little preacher that led him to the Lord the man who spearheaded the Revival among the Gentiles a prophet indeed no one could say that um but he was a prophet he was among he was more than a prophet he was an apostle and the Great Mighty Apostle to the Gentiles and demons would have associated with Paul had fellowship and seen the spirit of God move upon that man see but then he got to a point why would he turn his back on such a person Vindicated he was a servant of Christ but did he notice Paul here loving this present world is what what said about demons I don't think demons backslid I think he didn't do that but I think he got the wrong opinion of Paul see Paul got to a point God was using Paul in a different way still living in his life but Demas had the wrong idea of Paul see how many times we can get the wrong idea of one another oh they're on the hilltop praise God they're a Christian they're really overcoming but then they go into a night season you know brother and says like the seasons of the yeah you know of nature we go through Seasons we we have our summer time but then sometimes we go into an Autumn season it can be a winter time everything's just it's like we're basically skidding in the ditch we're on fire flipping around you know down the ditch but then we come back and do a springtime again we go up and down Cycles but that doesn't mean God's displeased with us amen I I trust this brings stability to someone we're going to look at our lives in a different way I think amen see Demas he came out of a rich family sorry for the reading but I felt it was important he was wealthy money sometimes makes religion to people would you like saying California if you haven't got three Cadillacs you're not spiritual so it means if you're not if you're not successful if you don't have the finest church out here in the city and people won't go that's almost the way it is here poor you you've got to have the finest Church in the country or they say Oh you mean you join that little Bunch like that did you know that our Lord didn't have a place to lay his head did you know he only owned one coatsi and he just it was a kind of a person was pushed about he didn't have no place to lay his head but they could have had thought the same thing and did about him and now I believe demon saw a failing seemingly in Paul's Ministry I think you're he thought the old fellow was washed up before God we can't get that opinion about one another amen no where Faith looks beyond see faith is actually as I've said it's it's faith is actually unconscious yeah it's a subconscious thing you possess it's a condition that the Holy Ghost puts you in it's not something you mentally work up right it's something that's unconscious amen some see your faith is not a conscious thing we don't work it out see the kingdom of heaven doesn't come by observation I'm going to try and wind this up real quick I know time is running away see you don't see don't press now or jump you jump away from it it's right with you just relax yourself and believe what is that God is more than able to do what he's promised to do he's a keeper of his word amen that's a real Faith amen but see sometimes your faith says unconscious and you don't know it see that's why we've got to go beyond well our mental work up see it's actually a condition you're in are we all together this morning right are we just let's just slog through we're nearly done okay see now Jesus didn't have to go out and fast all day pray all day and say no I wonder if I've got enough Faith to do this you don't read them doing that do you see he was unconscious of the faith he had any man or woman that's ever made real Warriors in the kingdom of God is perfectly unconscious of their faith see we keep trying to test our faith I wonder if we all have enough faith for this I wonder if I can actually have faith to make this promise see no don't test your faith no do you believe the word of God is he more than able to keep his word it's not you performing see the devil aways see what does the devil do like he went to Jesus in the wilderness if thou be the Son of God prove it turn the stones into bread do this do this do this if you're really the son of God come off the cross and we'll believe you see it's basically the devil tried to make Jesus prove himself to him and people say if you're really the bride of Christ do this pray for this be like this we don't have to prove nothing it's God that proves his word in our lives we don't have to prove his word in our lives We Just Surrender ourselves to him and he fulfills it why is the devil saying if thou be if you really are do this I don't have to prove nothing God proves his word see Hallelujah amen see God said so do it anyhow God said so have you ever tested your faith whether you've got no faith to come to the meeting or not tonight who did that this morning no you just came to church didn't you you'd have to test your faith I wonder if I can believe enough to come now you just come see did you test your faith to see if you had enough Faith to eat your supper right you have a need and you eat you want to come to church you just come to church you don't want to come to church you come anyhow you don't feel like rolling out of bed you roll out of bed say praise God I'm going to church today Hallelujah amen amen do you think you'll have enough um do you think you have to fast a while test your faith to see if you've got enough Faith to drive your car home who's going to go on a fast to see if their car works that sounds ridiculous but this is how we approach the promises of God do I really have enough Faith to do this do I really is it really going to happen you don't fulfill the word he fulfills it in your life God has more than enough Faith to prove his word right God is more than enough ability he doesn't just scrape through and pass an exam 50 or 45 percent no no 100 120 percent amen so this way certainly not see it's just automatically you believe it and that's how we should be that's why I mean by faith and subconscious you just automatically say your word is true Lord you're more than able to do it Lord I believe your word see faith is a revelation amen it's something that's been revealed to you you don't have to it's like when you get a revelation the Bible is the word of God you just you just live it out right it's not well is this really your will God no it's his word it's not man's opinion amen it's no it's it's his word so you automatically live it out you don't need to struggle with it because why it's revealed the Bible is true amen faith is a revelation this is Elijah on Mount Carmel see human faith is like the prophets of Baal they tried to manufacture a faith by fleshly manifestation see they were singing and dancing around the altar doing all that they could do and Elijah said well maybe he's asleep maybe he's pursuing maybe he's busy whole little louder so they started to cut themselves and cry all the more they're trying to manufacture an answer from God but you see Elijah before he ever went to Mount Carmel he saw a vision and he saw this happening so when he went up Mount Carmel he wasn't guessing well I think God will do this no it was revealed to him he went up Mount Carmel in faith in a revelation that's why when he built rebuilt the alternate everything he said he said Lord I've done all this according I've done all these things at Thy word that means he rebuilt the altar at his word amen he put the bull a coin and everything at his word he he made the water put onto it according to his word so then when he prayed he said Lord what you showed me in vision is now manifested now you bring the fire amen and that's what happened so he wasn't guessing or hoping that God will send the fire he went in confidence that God was gonna perform his word and it should be the same thing with you and I with the word of God we've seen this by vision amen well what do you mean by that if God was revealed to you this is his word that's like Elijah seeing a vision amen you know he's going to fulfill it hello she can walk in confidence according to his word and then God will fulfill what's left of it amen amen it's like it says in these signs Mark 16 these signs shall follow them that believe who believes that you know many you know a lot of Bibles they put a foot though these last few verses weren't inspired people have told me that and I've told them testimonies of laying hands on the second happening oh no that's not inspired well hold on it is because it happens who's had hands laid on them and you've been made well or God's touched you what is that that's Mark 16 in action but notice this because faith is subconscious right it doesn't say and they will pray and lay their hands on the sick and they'll recover no they'll just lay their hands on the sick it does we of course we pray right we always pray but the Bible hears it doesn't even mention prayer why because that quickening power to bring healing to someone is already in You by the Holy Ghost right and that quickening power by faith but in faith doing what God says lay hands upon the sick causes it to happen why because faith is unconscious you don't have to manufacture well Lord I hope you do it this time because at that time no you have a perfect confidence these signs shall follow them the belief I'm a Believer so therefore Lord You're Going to fulfill this in my life Hallelujah isn't that neat I think that's pretty neat see we see we should have confidence we've got sick children you pick them up what are you doing laying hands on the sick amen you believing now that subconsciously that that quickening power of the Holy Ghost is going from you into their bodies and bringing healing into their bodies praise God Hallelujah amen just like the same thing with Paul when he took the Hat sick handkerchiefs and aprons and so on from his body so he doesn't even say anything about praying for these what we call prayer cloths today they're just on them the quickening power of the Holy Ghost went into them and then those in faith will take it saying this is on the Apostle Paul's body we'll send in the Old Testament with Elijah and the shooter woman's son and different things and you know God raising the dead and healing because of these things so they had Faith now that when this touches my second individual I mean I mean love one whoever it's going to happen and it's exactly what happened why but it was a it was a subconscious thing see we have faith we're going to let it just work amen Hallelujah now Elijah I mean Elisha had had real faith Elijah tried to say stag gilgal stay here stay he says no I'm not leaving you amen I'm not living I I am your problem I'm gonna hang around Hallelujah right and then and then Elijah said after they crossed the Jordan now what what do you want from me he says I want a double portion I want to double anointing of what you have received and Elijah said well that may be a hard thing but if you see me go you'll receive it now Elijah represents Christ Elisha represents the church amen so the the anointing on Christ now a double portion comes upon the Believers amen hallelujah what happened to so so Elijah parted the Jordan with the with the with the mantle right and then the last year after he received the same mantle took that same mantle to the same spot in the Jordan and said where's the god of Elijah and God now proved to Elisha the god of Elijah was now his God it wasn't just walking with the prophet that God dwelled in now that same God was now in him and that must be the same thing with you and I that the same anointing on the prophet now brother Branham that a double portion comes upon the bride of Christ and we see the same God that you hear on tape is the same God that lives in our midst Hallelujah but you see now Elijah God now here's a man who had double portion he did eight Miracles Elijah did four Elijah to date now you would think well he's got a double portion so he's gonna probably go in a double Chariot right up into heaven because he's got double portion no not necessarily so you want to be very see John the Baptist he got cut off because a little girl danced right the Apostle Paul's he got cut off you know all these things you know but it says now Elisha was full and sick of the sickness wrath he died he was a man with a double portion doesn't mean that God was displeased with Elisha no this was the Avenue God was going to use to bring him home see he took a chariot right I mean he's a chariot right for Elijah right he used sickness for Elisha did they end up in the same destination amen see see death is just a travel bus to get us to where we really want to go it may come in cancer it may come in a car wreck it may come and you know a stroke and the different things that may come in a sickness it may come in many different ways it may go by the way the Rapture your bodies have changed but we're going to end up in the same destination it's God's prerogative to how we get there now we surrendered to his leadership and his will Hallelujah but you see now Elisha when he got Fallen sick and he died he was actually one Miracle shot seven were done right but maybe he had a double portion yeah there was one that was not done and no doubt the critics begin to circle around saying Elisha I thought you had a double portion where's that eighth Miracle because you're being prophesying that you've got a double portion and yeah but you know since when the critics come in but you see God was going to show that Elisha did not have to be alive for that last miracle to take place why because the quickening power that took Elijah up in a Rapture was the same quickening power that was in his mortal body Hallelujah so now Elijah died they bury him they think well he's one Miracle short many people think the bride is one Miracle short we ain't one Miracle short because the last miracle the bride is going to do if God through them is the resurrection of the Dead amen is the change of the body Hallelujah that's the last miracle the bride's gonna do if Elisha's last miracle looked see so there's you know there's fighting going on they're carrying their dead friends some soldiers and they just see an open Sepulcher it was Elisha and they threw the dead man's body in there and Elisha's body was just bones it was decay right and rotten away but as soon as that dead man got landed on Elijah's bones he came back to life why because the resurrection happened just by a man hitting the grave of Elisha why because the quickening power was in his body see Elisha did not have to be alive for the miracle to take place it was faith is a subconscious thing I don't think you're dead like Elisha was friends but you've got a subconscious faith that can make the word of God operate however he wants to operate Hallelujah see this is why we as we're not here to mentally work ourselves up no if we have faith in the word God will answer his word according to his time exactly how he's going to do it I mean I like you know I remember I remember Christine to her this is a big testimony you've seen many things happen and then our our washing machine was broken and someone said just go pray for it so she laid her hands on it we've prayed for appliances before they get fixed amen thank you hey God can do anything why should we limit him right but then she lays her hands on the washing machine she prays she goes to turn it on doesn't work but then a voice said to her but you believe me anyhow and she was dancing around the kitchen having a jubilee time because our faith is not based on how our prayers are answered you might say well she didn't have enough Faith yes she did but you see faith is not based on outcome faith is a condition you're in just like Elisha what's his condition well he actually died in faith he's full of cricketing power oh that should be the same thing with you and I if you've got the Holy Ghost we're full of quickening power amen so faith is a subconscious thing so don't ever make it a thing you're going to mentally work up I wonder if my faith will work no if you have faith to get salvation then you have faith for healing because the because your faith is in the same atonement that is for your soul is in the healing of your body and your spirit amen hallelujah praise God so things go sideways don't worry about the sideways amen see see this little fellow picked up that robot type of the church against he picked out that robe he'd done Twice The Miracles which is a type of Christ in the church the Elijah down for he donates he now he was had double the power Hallelujah he died that took him out and buried him you know well that quickening power didn't leave him many many years after that when that flesh had all rotted off his bones just laying in the Tomb and there they're packing a dead man one day they saw the enemy they just throwed this man on top of Elijah's bones there was so much quickening power on those bones so the man jumped up to life again oh it'll Quicken your mortal body though dead and rotten in the grave and yet that quickening power rested over that dirt Hallelujah he raised he that raised up Christ from the dead shall also Quicken your mortal body amen so this is how we should be see faith fight the subconscious you have it or you don't amen if you if your Christian Walkers like this all the time based on conditions you need Faith you need a stability in your life right but if your Christian Walkers just even if you've got your ups and downs but you keep walking on you've got real faith amen amen I'll finish with this quote Jesus Christ no matter if he was in a storm and a girl was knocking the boat from one side to another or he is standing in the face a mess of demons if he is hanging anywhere it never moved to him he walked right on just as calm as quiet he as he could be why he was simply unconscious of fear or anything around him now that doesn't mean he had blinkers on right that's right whether what was going to happen whether it wasn't going to happen he knowed it was going to happen because God said so see this is why when we pray we should pray in faith will it happen or not no God said so amen he didn't say oh have I prayed through wonder if I've fasted long enough wonder if I did this he just walked right on unconscious that's right he believed what God Said was truth the words must be fulfilled and he knowed what what his life was to fulfill them that's right and you're here to fulfill it too just walk on unconscious of fear walk unconscious of criticism walk unconscious unto the world walk as you walk in Christ walk with him not paying any attention to the right or left hand just keep moving on if something comes up in church walk with God hallelujah if sickness strikes you walk with God if the neighbor don't like you walk with God just keep walking on with God Enoch one day walked like that you know what he done he walked all the way home with God got so far far up the road he didn't want to come back anymore amen walk with God doctor says you're going to die walk with God yeah doctor says you can't get well walk with God just walk with God that's all for God has promised you I'll never leave you nor forsake you I'll be with you to the end of the world and he took an oath by that Covenant that he give you and that he would confirm it just walk with God then you'll have your ups and downs don't worry you've got to go through Briar patches over sharp rocks over Bluffs over the side down over the hillsides up through the mountains over Waters but walk with God yes sir there's so many Hills to climb upward you've heard the old song but the but how little they'll seem when you get to the end of the way my might just just look up there all that's been look back at your Footprints it won't be very much hey that's real faith just walk with God amen hallelujah who's thankful for that kind of Faith this morning let's
