musicians amen it's good to see everyone here tonight praise the Lord amen it's great to have Laura and Tulsi with us God bless you amen trust your feel at home amen God bless you amen great to have you here amen praise God well let's um let's turn in the scripture sorry I don't have a um don't have a slideshow my my computer decided to die so anyway uh so we're going to Luke chapter 7 and um going to read from verses 44 down to 50 just the last part of um I know brother Isaac brought it out so brilliantly cple couple of Sundays ago just want to come in behind that because I often think about you know what happens when people leave a scene you know and I trust I trust this will be a blessing amen so Luke 7 and we're going to read from verse 44 down to the end of the end of the um chapter here and so this is the Lord Jesus we know this is the story where the woman comes in with the alabaster box and and and at this moment she's already she already broken that and anointed the feet of the Lord Jesus wiped her wiped his feet with her tears and then dried her uh his feet so with with with her hair and and and while this is going on here the Lord Jesus says and he turned to the woman and said unto Simon seeth thou this woman I entered into thine house thou gavest me no water for my feet but she hath washed my feet with tears and wiped them with the hairs of her head thou gavest me no kiss but this woman since the time I came in hath not cease to kiss my feet my he with o thou didst not anoint but this woman hath anointed my feet with o wherefore I say unto thee her sins which are many are forgiven for she loved much but to little whom is Forgiven the same loveth little and she sorry and he said unto her thy sins are forgiven and they that sat at meat uh with him began to say within themselves who is this that forgiveth sins also and he said to the woman thy faith has saved thee go in peace praise God Amen let's bow heads in a word of prayer tonight amen if you want to be be remember to prayers want to slip your hand up to the Lord amen gracious Heavenly Father Lord I'm so thankful Lord as we sung that song I know the master of the wind Lord it is your Supreme Grace that has caused us to sing that as a testimony to sing that in reality dear God because truly we have met you Lord you found us when we were waiting in darkness and sin someplace you came and got us out of that mess Lord amen and now we walk in your glorious light Lord now we can say we know the master of the wind the maker of the rain we know you're in control of all things so we pray dear God as we have come into this service tonight I pray your anointing would would be upon every heart every life Lord may you touch every life Lord God and when everything's said and done the last prayer is prayed and the last song is sung and we go out these doors may we CH Lord walk out change renewed strengthened Lord loving you more praising you more oh God because you're worthy of all all honor glory and praise so we commit the service into your hands forgive us of our sins and our shortcomings cover us in your blood Lord be merciful Upon Us father and those who couldn't be here tonight those who may be streaming be their portion too father For Your Glory in Jesus Christ's name amen amen amen God bless you friends you can have your seats tonight so I want to speak tonight about walking in the peace of God walking in the great Shalom or peace of God now this incredible scene that we just read here a woman would would would uh uh gate Crasher party she wasn't invited but yet she she had a longing she had a need when she saw the Lord Jesus Jesus there she she knew that he was uh he could she could see by him in his position where he wasn't made welcome his feet wasn't washed like the rest of the guests he wasn't anointed like the rest of the guests he wasn't kissed and made welcome like the rest of the guests he was in the corner with dirty unwashed feet and when she saw him in that condition something moved on her heart God moved on her heart and she realized she had to make him welcome in that place incredible she wasn't invited she wasn't welcome but yet somehow she got through and it goes to show that when the faith ever struck break the heart of someone every obstacle will go to one side amen because God will allow that person to get where they need to get amen so she got there that's the main thing the main thing is she got there I mean didn't matter what state she came in she got there amen and the same thing with us that doesn't matter what state we arrived in amen he didn't leave us in that state when we left I mean can you imagine what it would have been like she she came in under one emotion and she came out with another emotion I mean she came in she knew she was rotten dirty filthy lost troubled and you know all kind of anxiety no doubt but yet in spite of all those things the need to get to jesus' feet prevailed over all those things but yet when all was said and done she realized her State when she was at the feet of the Messiah and I'm sure we all remember that kind of a time when we remember I remember the time when I was lost and I really needed the Lord you know just like this woman did and yet you know when she came there and then when she heard those incredible words thy faith has saved thee yeah go in peace peace she came with no peace she left with peace amen she came with trouble she left with peace she came lost she went out found amen she came broken but she went out whole amen what an incredible thing because she realized that Jesus was more than a prophet more than more than just another man but this is the Lord God Almighty was made flesh and she knew what she needed she could only get from him the rabbis couldn't give it religion couldn't give it nothing could give it but he could give it amen so so he uh and and he allowed her cuz Jesus says all that come to are no wise cast out so the Lord Jesus knew her State knew her condition just like Simon would say if if if he was really a prophet he would know what manner of woman this was and he was more than a prophet he knew her true State amen even you know you know he he knew her true state but because she had a desire he allowed her to come now imagine those words you're not sure you're going to be received you know you're you're there you're caught up in the moment you know you're pouring your life out before the Lord and then finally he begins to talk and notice he doesn't talk to her first he talks to her critic he talks to his critic and he talks to her critic cuz he's going to put the critic in his place and he's going to put her in her place I mean she so so he's going to put the unbeliever in his place and put the believer in her place amen so now here he begins to address Simon and begin to speak to him and you know even even his own confession would really condemn him what was and his heart would condemn him but you know her heart just cried out for mercy and then finally she heard those words thy sins are forgiven what she wanted she got I'm so thankful when we come to the Lord we get what we need amen we don't get half of what we need we get all that we need amen and then and then he said thy faith has saved thee go in peace now words have immense power words have incredible power words will start World War I words started World War II they started World War I amen it was a reaction to an action sure but it was words that started it someone had to stand up and say we're going to do this we're going to attack this Hitler swept Germany the Lutheran Church everything into war by words anointed words amen you know there's a Saying sticks and stones may break my bones but words will never hurt me that's not true sticks and stones may break my bones but but words can hurt and Scar me words have great power and the influence of those words upon your life will actually dictate how powerful they are in your life amen if the devil told you you're lost you're not really going to take much and you saw him as he really was you're not going to really take that even with a pinch of salt that's going to be like water off a duck's back but then he can tell the same thing to someone else it can mean a lot to him a lot to them right words have great power now I'm just I am going somewhere with this and just I'm just trying to sort myself out here but you see the thing that influenced es you the most has the greatest impact in your life all right the thing that influences you the most it can be a friend it can be a a a friend Circle it can be a job it can be someone at work but but it's it can be your family I trust it's God more than anything amen that his words mean more to you than any anyone other's words Hallelujah like God says one word to you it sets you in a Rapture condition amen if you realize the influence of it if you realized the one who's speaking because remember it was Jesus it was more than a prophet speaking to this woman it was the resurrection and the life was speaking to her more than a prophet more than a religious leader the resurrection and the life the Lord God Almighty the Eternal one became flesh and spoke words of life to her amen so now a lot of people spoke a lot of words to her there's a reason she ended up the way she did maybe she ended maybe she started in a broken home maybe her father didn't love her maybe she was thrown out on the street Maybe she was sold into prostitution by her parents we don't know but words had power over her life maybe a lot of men told her you're trash and you're worth nothing we can only surmise these things but she ended up that condition because of a lot of words right if her parents picked it up in their arms said I love you I care for you you're matter to me you're more you know you're mine I doubt and and and said that over you know God tells us over and over again I love you I care for you you're mine amen you're not the de devil you never were you never will be you're my child doesn't he say that service after service you open your Bible what is he what is this I just read three words when I from from cover to cover in the cover also I love you amen see so so if she if she was raised in that kind of a home I I doubt very much she would have ended up the way she did but words were spoken at her and they had impact but now someone else was going to say some words to her and it was going to change her life forever amen because remember the Lord Jesus say thy faith has saved thee go in peace Hallelujah wouldn't we love to hear those words wouldn't you love to be in her kind of position and hear the Supreme judge the Supreme one say thy faith has saved thee go in peace Hallelujah do you know he spoken that to you do you realize he's spoken that to you the message of the hour is summed up by those words thy faith has saved thee go on peace Brother brah would stand and he'd preach the message Shalom it'd be the start of 1964 he'd preach it twice now to me it's very significant he had preached it at at the start of a new year because normally at the start of a new year you are thinking about what has happened in the previous year now if you could just if we could just go back to that time he had just been through 1963 very significant year in the whole history of the Earth where where God would commission him to go to Jeffersonville and the Seven Seals are going to open the Lamb's Book of Life is going to be revealed the title deed to the Earth is going to be revealed and he be to be inspired by God to preach words to the bride of Christ he' say in the first seal I no longer call you church but I call you bride and he begins to address the bride of Christ begin to tell them where they came from and where they're going and he would he would open the the lamb himself would step forth and Break Forth the book of redemption and give the revelation of it to the prophet that we could receive it and live from it amen he would stand and he would preach sermons like the token saying You must have the literal life of God in you more than an emotion more than an anointing but the presence of God himself must dwell in you and that's how you know the blood is applied amen glory to God Amen he would preach messages like Christ is the mystery of God revealed and he would tell the people I'm going to tell you the back parts of God's mind amen and he'll be to tell tell them how how the mystery of Christ has unfolded to this very day Hallelujah and so he would he begin to preach these kind of a sermons then he would stand in 1964 and say it's shalom gross Darkness covers the people but the the the glory of the Lord is risen upon thee so now he's he's looking back with what has happened and now because of what has happened something greater is unfolding now because remember every season gives forth to another season we had summer praise God that gives forth to Autumn then that goes forth to Winter then get that gives forth to spring so if you're standing in winter you know Spring's coming right so if you're standing in a cold season of your life Spring's coming hallelujah amen if you you have the cold wind of indifference is blowing in your life Spring's coming amen amen you can be look forward to another season we know even families brother Bram says go through day and night cycles so if you're living in a night cycle everything's going a bit Rocky the day is coming amen hallelujah So Different Seasons give way to New Seasons and then so he would stand and he would say now it is peace and and he speaks the message Shalom it says now we're going to tell you what it's all about and he'd say that the peace of God has risen upon the people hallelujah hallelujah that is not the wrath of God it's not the trouble of God it's not anything negative it's the peace of God he says to the bride Shalom or God's peace be upon thee now this woman was instructed by the Lord thy faith has saved thee go in peace amen so so he she sorry she is told by the Messiah walk in my peace my peace be upon thee you the trouble you came with you're not walking out with it I've taken care of it you've placed it upon me and now you're walking out of my peace isn't it amazing that we can we can trade trouble for peace we can we we can trade a broken life for a whole life amen we can we can try trade the you know um Spirit of heaviness for the Garment of joy hallelujah praise God Lord amen so so so brother BR would preach these things because he's trying to he's trying to get the people to see now this is a different season we've had a night season we've had a troubled season but now it's the time of God's peace to rule and me it's time for the peace of God to rule in the people's hearts amen it's not the Peace of man ruling where which is based upon circumstances and how good your finances are and how good your jobs going and different things that move like the wind but no the peace of God is far deeper and stronger and greater and more stable than the Peace of of humanity cuz the humanity just gives a peace that can change right but God gives a peace that does not shift Hallelujah so now the greatest the greatest influence That Came Upon her life was the voice of the Messiah saying thy faith has saved thee go in peace and that word faith is the word Soo and it means just not not just save from sin but save from sickness but in the definition of it it means to remove every obstacle that would stop you from receiving the messiah's blessings hallelujah amen so her faith caused her to receive the blessings of the Messiah what what is the true blessings of the Messiah that thy sins be forgiven thee that there's nothing between thy soul and thy savior amen there's the chasmine bridge the blood completes I me makes you one unit with God himself amen so she would now walk in that peace now you're got to realize now the greatest influence in her life was now his words and there's no record that he that that sorry she ever saw him again maybe she was in the upper room maybe she wasn't we don't know but just based on this we're saying maybe she never saw him again in this in this flesh but yet she would spend the rest of her life living in the peace of God because his voice so gripped her life that when he spoke those things to her life she got up Justified hallelujah hallelujah she got up she didn't she didn't get up the way she went down amen and she walked out of there amen with the peace of God ruling in her heart hallelujah amen it's amazing how testimonies make different people react in different ways many testimonies cause trouble doesn't mean they didn't happen Mary would have a visitation of Gabriel there had been 800 years of of of No Doubt dads with with with with young young daughters who read the prophecy of Isaiah and said my daughter's going to be the one and for 800 years there would have been maybe an excitement in the family she's going to be the one that's going to bring forth Emanuel but finally God came to the came to one of the most sinful places in Israel Bethlehem at that time came to a woman that wasn't even considered and Gabriel was sent to her and said Mary you're highly favorite of God you're going to have the Messiah now she began to testify about this and her testimony wasn't just words but her her body begin to change how she walked begin to to change what she ate begin to change can you imagine maybe the day before she's enjoying her favorite meal with with um Joseph I don't know what kind of food they would have had maybe it's Egyptian I don't know maybe she having a kebab Turkish I don't know but then the day after that her taste buds change she can't control this there's a Life coming to her her whole life has changed and then then you know maybe her belly begins to swell all these things and she tells she tells Joseph Joseph yesterday was different what happened you're going to the well you go there every day no this was different Joseph I walked past a man there's always men on the way to the well you live in a city this was a different kind of a man there was a presence around him like I'd never experienced in my life he was about six foot tall Olive complexion head down to here robed in white and he knew me my knew me by name said Hail Mary and I stopped I thought how does he know my name and then he be to tell me the prophecies that we read about last week in Isaiah I was going to be the fulfillment of that Hallelujah now this didn't cause Joseph to Rejoice he was troubled in his heart he was going to privately put her away because he just couldn't understand what was going on so even even a sincere believing Israelite staggered at Mary's testimony did this make Mary doubt it didn't make Mary doubt why cuz the words of the Angel so anchored in her heart amen that she couldn't shake it amen just like I say the words of theeven seven th Angel this message has anchored into our hearts amen that's gripped Us in such a way like Mary and it becomes more than just a testimony of her words but it becomes a lived voice it becomes a living reality she couldn't help herself um she couldn't stop herself being pregnant she couldn't stop herself walking different talking different eating different but there's a life within her that took over her own life amen you think about this woman she was the only one at the feet of Jesus that day she was the only only one that heard those words when she went back to her house maybe she walked past all the same people she hurried past going there the next day she was a different P She was different person from then on but the next day she was still that different person and then maybe maybe her neighbors got curious and said what happened to you you're not standing on the corner anymore you're not doing these things anymore what happened to you and she began to describe how she got into Simon's house you mean you were there how did you get in Were you invited I wasn't invited well how'd you get in well I heard there's This Man Called Jesus and I saw him and something moved in my heart I had to get all my money I had I had to go buy that alabaster box that old Jones has in his in his Apothecary I had to go get it something moved in me I couldn't stop myself and I found myself at his feet and she would just relate the testimony of being in that presence trying to describe the presence of God to people who weren't there trying to just that the magnitude of being in the presence of the Creator and realizing your own State and all of of her all of her um reasoning left her and she realized who she was but she knew what she needed and she got what she needed and then she heard a voice it was his voice she didn't he what did what did he say to you did he condemn you did he kick you away I thought he was a holy man yeah he is a holy man he's the holy man amen but he said thy faith is saved the go in peace praise the Lord and they would say you mean Jesus Nazareth you mean that guy that doesn't belong to any Bible school I hear the priest call be alab he teaches false Doctrine he says we should eat flesh and drink blood that's directly contrary to the book of Moses he just causes trouble in synagogues he heals on the Sabbath none of the Pharisees like him the Sadducees are sad you see at him and you know no one's happy the high priest doesn't like him why are you believing his words and she would just say I can't explain it but he's more than a man yeah he's more than a man that word told me he's the word remember that I'm sinless and I'm and I'm walking in his peace now it's amazing when people try and quantify or work out what you believe compared to the denominations they think we're a bunch of cult they think we're crazy people we follow some man I follow the man Christ Jesus the word by the way Hallelujah and they say no that thing's just some wild thing there's no power to it there's no reality to it if they told that to her she'd say I beg to differ I'm not the same woman anymore I'm not the same person anymore and I'd say well how did you change yourself no I didn't change me he changed me how did he change me by the word he spoke to me amen his word changed my life amen it transformed my life it brought me to life I mean I realized who I am and where I'm going and I'm walking in his peace doesn't matter what the critic would say to her she had the experience the word was real to her so she could walk in that peace from that day till whenever she went into eternity she could walk under the peace of God hallelujah now this is the same thing with you and I friends it doesn't matter don't pay attention to the critic's voices don't let the critic be your absolute brother Braham says in the message absolute the one who leads you from the truth becomes your absolute don't let the critic be your absolute don't let this culture be your absolute don't let your friend Circle Be Your absolute let the word of God himself be your absolute let him be your biggest influence amen that you are more important to please him than this please this world Hallelujah so she walked on now walking in the peace of God hallelujah we walk in that same peace you got to realize what really what has you amen I say the Lord Jesus Christ has you amen amen the Apostle Paul would would would say this in um Second Corinthians let's try and find it here you know it's it's kind of scary when I make notes even slides and it's never in order but you know let's go to 2 Corinthians chapter 4 because this peace is far greater than being this peace is not a lack of trouble the peace of God does not rule in an absence of trouble the peace of God rules in spite of trouble it rules in trouble I mean because God you can you imagine the critics this woman would have had first she had a bad name and now she had a worser name she's not a prostituted anymore but now she's a follower of Jesus she was accepted in society a little bit the Pharisees would buy her now she is kicked out of every Circle but she was walking under the peace of God now second Corinthians 4 we start from verse 8 I love the testimony of the Apostle Paul amen amen if you ever feel down and out need strength just read these words we are troubled on every side yet not distressed we are perplexed but not in despair persecuted but not forsaken cast down but not destroyed should we read that again we're troubled on every side this is a time of trouble amen yet we are not distressed why could he say these words because the same one that met that woman was the same one that met him on the road to Damascus amen the same one that forgave her of her sins was the same one that forgave him of his sins I mean here's a Pharisee of the Pharisees but yet he began to walk in the peace of God maybe he would just intellect know the seven compound names of Jehovah I'm not going to try and rattle them off but one is Jehovah Shalom the Lord is our peace and you know it intellectually but when he met that God on the road to Damascus it went from an intellectual idea to a reality amen he had far more trouble after he met the Lord than before he was well thought of in every Circle he was in people would have been honored Simon would have loved to have Paul a soul of tarus at his Feast who's going to be your next guest next year Saul of tarus all the young Rabbi the young Pharisee he's real he's he he's amazing he was accepted he didn't have trouble but then when Jesus came his way he had trouble amen he would he would he would have a free night in a in a prison many places he was beaten he was Shipwrecked bitten by snake stoned rejected chased all kind of thing but yet friends May the peace of God rule in our hearts I mean May the external not control us but may the inside of the inside if God is in there I pray he is May that peace rule you have dominion over your life amen for We Are Trouble on every side yet not distressed we are perplexed but not in despair persecuted but not forsaken cast down but not destroyed always bearing about in the body the dying of the Lord Jesus that the life also of Jesus might be made manifest in our body for we which live are always delivered unto death for jesus' sake that the life also of Jesus might be made manifest in our mortal flesh so then death worketh in us but life in you we have the same Spirit of Faith according as as is written I believed therefore have I spoken we also believe and therefore speak knowing that he which raised up the Lord Jesus shall raise up us also by Jesus and shall present us with you for all things are for your sakes that the abundant grace might through the Thanksgiving of many rebound to the glory of God for which cause we faint not though our outward man perish yet the inward man is renewed day by day for our light Affliction which is but for a moment worketh for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of Glory while we look not at the things which are seen but the things which are not seen for the things which are seen are temporal and I say it cannot give you peace but the things which are not are Eternal and give you the peace of God Amen he would say in he would say in um Philippians 4 and6 this is the man that we just this was this was his life perplexed but not in despair distressed but not you know persecuted not forsaken this was him he would write to the Philippians remember remember the Apostle Paul what he wrote was experience amen it wasn't a nice idea he hatched up some poetic kind of thing that he just kind of lyrically put together no it was it was an experience he preached and he preached it with passion and he lived what he preached I mean he experienced what he preached and so in Philippian Ians 4:6 he say be careful for nothing but in everything by prayer and supplication with Thanksgiving let your requests be made known unto God and the peace of God which passes passeth all understanding shall keep your hearts and Minds through Christ Jesus so he's giving you a very important key especially for this end time where Mental Health crisis has gone through the roof and taken the roof with it amen where where where mental health problems are never been like it is in this day but he giving us real good instructions this is how you let the peace of God keep your hearts and your minds through Christ Jesus remember our hearts are our seat of our emotion people's emotions have gone wild in this day people are anxious they're stressed they're all troubled they always people cross Bridges and then the next bridge to the next Bridge before they ever come to the first bridge and they just sing a big train wreck in front of they're panicking and they have to take all kind of medications and now if you have to that's up to you but you know God's a doctor all those you know if you need to take if you need to go to the doctor go right but there's something greater than medication that can keep your heart amen and and our and and minds of course that's our thoughts right that's our thought pattern so if we want the peace of God to keep us then we must be careful for nothing now this word careful doesn't mean we just are real loose and sloppy and you know just real laxidasical but this be careful this word careful means to be anxious to be troubled with cares to care about something but it's also to seek to promote one's interest this is this word careful so don't try and promote your own interest amen amen don't be don't don't be anxious don't be troubled with cares sure life is full of trouble but who do you put the trouble into whose hands whose hands hold the trouble do you keep it yourself or do you give it to him do you give it to the Lord do you commit All That You Are into his hands or do you bottle it up and hold on to it yourself I say if you hold on to yourself you'll become a very anxious stressed person amen the peace of God will not keep your heart but if you give it to him the peace of God which passes all understanding you say how can a man who is troubled on every side and not distressed and be perplexed but not in despair persecuted but not forsaken cast down but not destroyed how can a person that that that Liv that out so many times say that the that the peace of God can keep your heart and mind he lived it out he experienced it praise God Amen so don't be don't don't be don't be anxious about anything it doesn't mean we won't feel anxious but don't hold on to it don't let it dominate your life don't let unbelief consume you give it to the Lord if you have fears give it to him if you've got cares we all have cares we're human aren't we we have emotions amen give it to to him hallelujah amen don't be anxious about these things see if we try and control our own lives if we try and be the master of our own destiny we will be anxious people cuz we're trying to rule it but if you commit all your cares into his hands amen with in prayer and supplication with Thanksgiving always have Thanksgiving in your prayers we should be the most thankful people that there's ever lived amen we're living in Satan's Eden but yet we're not of Satan's Eden amen God has called us out of Darkness into his glorious light amen the glory of the Lord has risen upon us gross gross Darkness covers the people but the light of the Lord is risen upon thee amen we should be the most thankful amen if if if all you can pray is thank you Jesus thank you Jesus thank you Jesus I think that's a good prayer if you mean it from your heart you're so thankful that he's found you so thankful that he keeps you amen he guide you through trouble amen he'll navigate you through storms am mean don't be helpless don't think you're helpless don't think you're hopeless if you think that way you'll be anxious amen but sure if you realize the enemy one of my favorite quotes from how can I overcome is where brother Bram says you you say you're not sick you're sick you say you don't have a cancer it's a cancer it's a cancer but he says but you got to realize the one that's in you has already overcome this thing that's real overcoming that's perfectly sensible now you take that not just to sickness but to every trouble that comes your way you've got to realize the spirit of God within you has already overcome that thing am mean it says that's how you overcome you recognize your enemy but you recognize the one in you has already conquered that enemy amen how long's the battle going to go for I don't know but who's going to win hallelujah amen don't just don't just give one punch at it if the devil don't move keep punching him keep praising God don't quit just because the devil's still standing there he's bluffing you he's bluffing you are you going to call him at his bluff you going to give into his bluff it's really up to it's you know it's up to us what are we willing to die for when you get ready when you're willing to die for anything that's when you're willing to live for it amen amen if you're willing to die for the gospel that's when you're willing to live for it if you're willing to die to yourself that's when you can live for it amen Jesus said whosoever saveth saveth his life shall lose it and whoever loses his life my sake shall keep it right how do you lose your life you give it to him you see so don't be anxious don't look at the wall of giants around you you say well I can't win this battle but Jesus can there's no way my situation can change H jid Legions did the woman of the well did Peter did amen how many others did Moses's did amen Israel's situation changed David's did amen all the Believers down Through the Ages they had a time where the situation changed job's did praise God Amen so if we remember the Lord Jesus always makes a way of Escape but you've got to look for that way of Escape Lord show me the way of Escape out of this trial say I can't see it but we don't walk by sight we walk by faith you got to believe the Lord Jesus is going to take you through and he's going to give you the victory in every situation amen so don't be anxious for nothing but in everything in prayer and supplication with Thanksgiving let your request be known un be known unto God and the peace of God which passeth all understanding shall keep your hearts and Minds through Christ Jesus shall keep your hearts not maybe shall the Apostle Paul knew what he was talking about amen I think we can take God at his word and walk the same way he did amen with every trouble see don't be anxious amen don't be worried just let God just realize that God when you really meet that's when the peace of God that passes all understanding enters into your heart brother Braham says in Hebrews chapter 5 and 6 he says but in this place we come by faith through Grace God called us we hang our we lay our hands on the head of the Lamb of God we hear that swinging Hammer we hear that voice I thirst give me drink father lay not the sin to their charge they don't know what they're doing see by faith we feel his death um there in our stead way down in our hearts comes a deep settled peace when a voice says your pardon now go and sin no more now by Grace then we walk away not with the same desire but but a desire never to sin no more or do anything wrong the peace that passes all understanding has entered our heart praise God so if God has done a work that you just want to serve him now remember peace of God does not equal absence of trouble absence of anx worry things going on the peace of God comes in and it's it doesn't make sense how we can stand in trouble and be rejoicing how can see humanly it makes no sense how can a people stand when they see the world falling apart they see trouble in every hand but lift up their heads and know their redemptions during n amen be full of joy unspeakable full of Glory why it's a peace that passes all human understanding amen so this woman walked out with the peace of God over her life she she was influenced by those words for the rest of her days amen Simon didn't get anything out of that Feast the footwash flunky and all of Simon's servants were more influenced by Simon than they were Jesus they knew he was a prophet they knew he did Miracles they they heard all the testimonies right but yet the influence of Simon was more important upon their life to them than the very Messiah coming into Simon's house and their actions proved it if they were if they believe that the influence you know if they really did believe Jesus was a prophet and his influence was the greatest one the foot wash flunky would have washed his feet I don't care if I get fired hey if this is the last time here it's going to be a good day I mean the man who anointed with oil said I don't care I'm going to anoint him if I get fired it's going to be my last time in this place I might as anoint the greatest one the last the last person I ever get an opportunity to anoint in this place might as will be him amen the one who kissed and made welcome said well if I'm if I'm not going to welcome anyone else in this place I'm going to get fired what I'm about to do it's going to be the Lord yeah but you see the influence of Simon was more important than this one but yet and it's amazing Jesus would Jesus would identify their actions the source of their actions as Simon himself when you know opening scripture he would say um uh he turned to the woman said unto Simon seeth thou this woman I entered thy house thou gave me no water for my feet who but who had the bowl not Simon the footwash flunky you gave me no kiss who the one who kiss May welcome the one who did that with my head you did with oil you did not anoint he wasn't doing it someone else was doing it but the influence upon them came from Simon I pray the influence Upon Our Lives comes from the Lord Jesus amen that everything we do is him in action amen that the greatest influence in our lives is Redeeming Grace amen that he has he has called us out of Darkness into marvelous light that truly we can stand in this day where there's trouble on every hand but trouble's not in US I mean and the reason trouble's not in US is because not because there's no trouble but because we know the one who can speak peace we know the one that can give the answer we know the one that can meet the need amen that we're not here ringing our hands saying how's it all going to work out we can say thank you Jesus I don't know how you're going to do it I don't know when you're going to do it but I believe you're going to do it amen you can have see the Apostle Paul his greatest Victory like Abraham's greatest Victory is when he surrendered himself and became a prisoner amen Abraham would Abraham would wrestle it out praise God and then he paid ties to malesic amen see he Abraham had to come to a place where what God said was greater than what he thought what he heard what he imagined amen he came to a place where that Revelation had preeminence in his life amen where the peace of God ruled in his life amen and then Sarah had to have the same kind of visitation where she believed the word amen praise God hallelujah you see she realized if God said so it settles it that's it he is the amen part of how he introduced himself to this age says I'm the amen the beginning of the creation of God Amen means finality it means so be it he has the last say Amen so when she heard those words thy faith has saved thee go in peace she heard the amen speaking to her she heard the final say she heard the supreme authority she did not hear an opinion she did not hear an argument she heard the final Authority saying thy faith has saved thee go in peace so whenever any voice counted his voice she said no you're not the amen you don't have the final say he's already spoken it over my life amen I have the peace of God I'm walking on Amen and God would stand in this day and he would prove his word he would speak his voice to a redeemed son of man amen and what is it it is the Amen on the scripture praise God we have heard the final Authority on the word amen we don't have a collection of Bible schools to tell us what the Bible means we have had given a direct word from God to reveal Christ in the scripture amen so now if he has said you never did it in the first place I trust these words really grip you amen he's not just you know the prophet doesn't just preach sermons this is not just stories right there's not just good teaching and nice things no this is the words of life in print formall amen so when you begin to read it when when you know when the Apostle Paul would say that he has broken down the middle wall of partition between us who's the US he's talking to he's talking to me God is letting me knowu amen hallelujah you read the book of Ephesians put you in the book amen I've been predestined to the adoption of sons I believe that the amen has told me that amen the amen has said that I am as bone of his bone flesh is flesh Life Is Life I'm part of him the amen has said that so now if he has spoken these things should it not grip us more than everything that's around us shouldn't our lives be dictated to by the amen of God more than what other people say amen amen we you know we need to realize that the that the critic's voice will not be silenced just because God has spoken no that's when the critic is actually Amplified he speaks in a greater way but his voice doesn't mean if you're influenced by the word of God greater than the critic the critic doesn't mean anything amen am but doesn't it hurt you when people criticize absolutely doesn't it trouble you yes it does but yet there's a peace of God that passes all understanding when I realize the Supreme one has purchased my salvation the Supreme one has said Shalom that was God speaking not him God used brother Brown to speak to me peace this world is falling apart but you've got peace what peace do I have not my own peace not a human manufactured peace the peace of God Amen and I'm walking in it Hallelujah amen Paul would say in in Colossians 3 and let the peace of God rule in your hearts to which also ye are called in one body and be ye thankful let the word of God dwell in you richly in all wisdom teaching and admonishing one another in Psalms and hymns and spiritual songs singing with Grace in your hearts to the Lord and whatsoever you do in word or deed do all in the name of the Lord Jesus giving thanks to him and the father by him that's right so he's saying you got to let the peace of God rule in your heart well how do I let it rule my emotions begin to think about what he's done for you begin to meditate upon his testimonies that's how you let it rule see the devil wants you to to forget everything God's ever done he tries to explain he even tries to explain away from you what God's done in your life does he not he does it to me he tries to make us remember this we God gives us a testimony because he wants you to realize you're his child right because remember this is an age of identity people are identifying as many different things but then when God comes down and says you're one of mine that settles everything right so God has called us saying we are his children should we not walk in that identity amen there's people identify as many things out there and they push against every kind of barrier every kind of social Prejudice because they say I'm this but they have nothing backing them up apart from their own self-will what about the people where all of Heaven is behind amen what about a people where God has said you're my daughter you're my son I've called you by my grace amen it's not just us claiming something it's God claiming you amen so if you begin to think about all he has done I probably I feel like a broken record from months on in but if we really if we keep our minds on What the Lord Has Done and he's not stopped he hasn't quit amen that's how you let the peace of God rule in your heart sing songs speaking in wisdom admonishing one another in Psalms and hymns and spiritual songs singing with Grace in your hearts to the Lord You' been to think on the Lord what happens an atmosphere comes around you amen the peace that's within comes out praise the Lord amen and I trust and well from experience what God can change your whole outlook you you can have the worst day of your life and you start thinking about the Lord start singing his songs that's it and it becomes the most glorious time Paul and Silas around midnight started singing to the Lord in an inner prison I don't know what they did from the time they arrested to the time they got in there but there was a gap of time between the time they were thrown in the time they started singing amen the main thing is they started singing talking about how God was to them the peace of God was ruling them they were beaten they were in a prison they didn't know what was going to happen but that didn't matter to them cuz they knew who whom they have believed hallelujah amen I want a good outcome in this thing no the main thing is Lord live do what you want to do Lord praise God that's why Paul when he got to the end of his road because he he had been living under the peace of God when he heard that that the death sentence had been signed your head's coming off boy he didn't throw a tantrum he didn't say what a waste of time God if you're so powerful look at me look what you've done to my life no he said praise God I've got a crown amen hallelujah I'm going to put it on and not just me but everyone else that loves his glorious appearing amen so God would allow those troubles to come into his life that the peace of God would be flowing through his life that when we read the word of God what's that it's the peace of God coming into US yeah we can draw strength from Paul's trouble isn't that funny just like the Psalms God had Psalms that needed to be written how's he going to write them is he going to put David in an ivory Tower with no trouble no he's going to put them in a time of great trouble a time of a lot of distress a lot of trouble going on in his life because he had songs that had to be written yeah God had songs in him that had to be written God puts us in trouble he wants to express he didn't want to express David he he didn't want to express Paul he wanted to express Christ out of him amen so that's why we shouldn't throw attention when Trouble Comes our way say praise God you want to express yourself in me Lord hallelujah when when when when strike our Liv sickness whatever it is praise God when our family go sideways praise God you want to express something in my life I'm not a crazy man I know where I'm standing if the Apostle Paul can stand there and rejoice with far worse you know have I ever been in prison no have I been beaten go imagine if I came home from a missionary trip you want to see the scars I got beaten I got thrown in that prison I got stoned here were you discouraged no praise the Lord I'm walking in the footsteps of the Apostle Paul Hallelujah you know what I mean I think we should turn trouble into joy we should look at things a bit differently some people aren't uh what do you call it but hey always look at the good side of things you know the armac company girl story I'm going to close with this we'll not but I just enjoy it I enjoyed this this afternoon I was it I have such a good time sometimes anyway you just think about God God's awesome you know it's amazing the prophet would take a story that Moody first told but he'd make it live and he'd say there was a girl and she was an orphan girl she it was like a Cinderella story but it really happened just like we're living a story it's really it's really happening this is not this is not a fantasy world we live in this is reality I mean when she was a she was an orphan girl she went and lived out on this big Ranch and you know with her cousins and her and her um well their parents whatever more and this Ranch wasn't theirs but it was owned by this armor company a big wealthy family from Chicago and uh one day the son of the owner of this company who owned the ranch was going to come to the ranch and just have a look around and things you know the story just enjoy it with me I mean so so here here was this woman you here was this young lady she was destitute she was orphan she was made fun of by her cousins and you know they would see see words have power and they would tell her she's good for nothing she's going to be our be be be the servant they probably never thanked her a day in her life for everything she did for them probably just told her off and beat her made fun of her and you know tried to tear her down those words dragged her way down but then the armor company son came to the ranch and the sisters well her cousins thought that they're going to marry this boy and then they put on a big party big ho down Shing in the barn and all these things and you know she's not invited it's amazing who God invites and who people think should be there are two different Polar Opposites amen because I wasn't invited by man God invited me I mean I wasn't man wasn't looking for me I thank God but God was looking for me I mean so so there she was she was out the back of the party and you know probably your bare feet raggedy dress play feeling sorry for herself that she wasn't welcom in the thing but you know but then but then she heard some footsteps as she's tipping dishw water over the fence and it was the son it was the arm company boy son and and and you know she felt embarrassed because the state she was in and and and she had heard how rich he was and you know he would he would say to her I've been I've been I've watching you I've been watching you God's been watching us the whole time God's been watching us the whole time and our Brokenness he sees and he cares and our times are upset we're trouble we don't know the way he sees and he cares and he's Mindful and he bears with us amen amen and there so there she is feeling all embarrassing things by the way she was dressed and he said you I've been watching you and you know I I came out here not to look for the ranch you know my dad owns this and we know what goes on here anyway but I'm here looking for a wife I'm here looking for character and he said I believe that's you and maybe she be to think why is he saying this to me did you you have that feeling when God first called you you feel about this big my my fingers are together by the way you think how on Earth could he ever forgive me and save me but yet something's pulling you to him and she was pulled to this man and then so he said he said you know in a year's time I'm going to come and get I'm going to spend a year get us a nice big house in Chicago I'm going to send the money for the dress all these things and in a year's time we're going to get married maybe gets that on one KNE and says will you marry me remember that moment where God said will you marry me will you become one with me will you enjoy eternity with me praise the Lord I trust we're going down memory lane this is how the peace of God rules in your heart amen and of course you said yes Hallelujah maybe he picked her up gave her a big kiss I don't know and then and then he left the next day for her was exactly the same as the first day she was living in the same house she was doing the same chores her cousins were still mean am mean her their parents were probably still mean to her they thought she was nothing but she came under the influence of a different word hallu a different sound amen so the peace of God if I'm put it that way begin to rule in her heart he's coming back for me amen Hallelujah he's coming back for me amen so the days were the same the chores were the same the cousins were the same come friends one day one day to the next was probably you live the same kind of life but what happened in the middle of that is when God came and interrupted your life and met you and changed your life that means you're the same person well actually you're a different person living in the different house but in the same way maybe the same job the same family the same everything like she did the woman with the alabaster the box right but she was transformed by the word she heard and this I'm a company girl I put it that way her whole life was transformed on the inside by what he promised her hallelujah hallelujah so before that happened she thought what's my future what's what does my future hold I'm nothing I'm never going to get married I'm going to be stuck here for the rest of my life but when he spoke those words she realized I'm leaving I'm not staying here he's coming to get me and she be to make a countdown and then the money came for the dress and she bought the dress and it fitted just right and you know the closer the days got the scorning and the making fun of the of the cousins became became worse cuz maybe she just bouted out one day maybe she had a smile on her face she didn't have the day before praise the Lord and they said what's up with you I'm getting married and maybe they laughed at her more fun of her who are you marrying the armor company boy that you couldn't win he came looking for me Hallelujah but it was more than words because the dress came this came different things came and then the day finally came she was standing on the porch in her wedding gown and they gathered just to see what was going to go on they thought man this guy is so cruel to her making fun of her praying playing this big prank on her but it wasn't a prank see other people I think you're crazy but you're not yeah cuz you're walking in his peace oh my Lord hallelujah hallelujah the next thing you know they hear the tumbling of the wagon wheels the dust of the horses and then the wagon came by the front door he opened the gate amen said honey let's get out of here right now she ran into his arms and went to Chicago as fast as they could and she never looked back Hallelujah and as they in the carriage there rejoicing happy that the moment finally came you know he said look I've been watching you the whole time I've had my men watching you keeping you safe seeing that you're really you know of Hallelujah I I've been watching over you this whole time till this time we're finally together and she said you know what kept me was it honey your word kept me when I felt down the persecution became so great the trouble came my heart was ruled by your promise because I judged you Faithful you're more than able to fulfill it Hallelujah now friends that's more than a story you're in that story amen I trust it's in your soul he's coming back for me amen may we just walk in that the rest of our days until he takes us home Hallelujah May that peace he told me my sins are forgiven I believe him he told me his blood is more than enough I believe him amen hallelujah maybe we just walk in that cuz the bride is Walking In God's peace praise the Lord hallelujah you see I'm not feeling very peaceful let the peace of God rule your heart let him take over think on what he has promised you and he's faithful to his promises and walk on with Thanksgiving rejoicing in him amen let's have the musicians tonight sorry I've kept you a bit amen but let's yeah let's have the musicians tonight shall we amen amen let's stand I just want to sing
