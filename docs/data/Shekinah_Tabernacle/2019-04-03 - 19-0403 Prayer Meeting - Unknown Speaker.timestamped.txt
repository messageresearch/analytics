[16:19] Lord and Savior Jesus Christ I stand in
[16:25] front of you humble today Lord does
[16:29] great things in our lives brings us from
[16:31] different places he puts us in different
[16:33] places brings us into a trial and then
[16:36] he takes us out of the trial showing us
[16:38] his mighty hand each one of us come to
[16:44] the Lord in a different way kicking
[16:46] screaming fighting pulling or maybe just
[16:49] running to him because you need him but
[16:52] yet he is so wonderful and he takes us
[16:55] with his open arms and he deals with us
[16:59] I want to thank this evening my pasta
[17:05] pasta pin thank you for this opportunity
[17:09] thank the elders of the church for the
[17:12] opportunity that I have to stand in
[17:13] front of you I am nothing I'm not a
[17:17] preacher I'm not a song leader but when
[17:22] you rub shoulders with brothers and
[17:25] sisters of the caliber that we have in
[17:28] front of us it's iron sharpening iron it
[17:31] makes us better people we learn from
[17:33] each other we learn to stand on our own
[17:36] whether good or bad it puts you in a
[17:40] place it puts you in a trial then it
[17:41] takes you out of a trial so brothers and
[17:44] sisters I just ask a few this evening
[17:46] I've only got a short scripture reading
[17:49] and and a word of encouragement what the
[17:57] Lord is doing for me and I hope it's an
[18:00] encouragement to you and I hope it helps
[18:03] you because we can be led astray very
[18:07] easily in this world so by the grace of
[18:10] God I do have one song and I'd like but
[18:13] I don't mind to sing this song there is
[18:14] very fitting for me for what I want to

[18:19] Jesus so I'm going to join me we'll
[18:21] stand up and we'll sing the song and

[19:43] can get all solo you can get under it
[19:50] Oh amen
[20:27] what's your standing if we can go to the
[20:29] Book of Daniel chapter 6 my thought is
[20:33] from verse 22 but I'd like to read from
[20:35] verse 20
[20:44] and when he came to the den he cried
[20:48] with a lamentation alloys unto Daniel
[20:51] and the King spake and he said Daniel Oh
[20:55] Daniel servant of the Living God whom
[21:00] thou serveth continually able to deliver
[21:05] thee from the Lions then Daniel said
[21:09] unto the King all King live forever the
[21:13] key my God had sent his angel and it
[21:19] shocked the lion's mouth that they have
[21:22] not hurt me for as much as before my
[21:26] innocence II was found in me and also
[21:30] before the Oh King I have done no hurt
[21:34] amen
[21:36] Heavenly Father mighty Lord we just want
[21:39] to give you thanks this evening father

[21:52] lead us Lord Father and have your way
[21:54] with us this evening father lord thank
[21:56] you Lord that I could stand in front of
[21:59] you today Lord Jesus and share my heart
[22:02] Lord father the word that you only give
[22:04] to me Lord Jesus to share to my loved
[22:07] ones around me here Lord Jesus so far
[22:09] the Lord let it be your way Lord and
[22:11] your wool lot father we just bring this
[22:14] to you in Jesus wonderful name amen
[22:20] brothers and sisters the key word day
[22:25] for me though the key Scripture was my
[22:28] God had sent an angel and it shut the
[22:31] Lions mouths you'll know the story of
[22:37] Daniel Daniel was put into the Lions Den
[22:43] because
[22:45] he was chosen by the king over all the
[22:48] people off of that Kingdom and the the
[22:54] priests or the
[22:55] the princes actually and the presidents
[22:59] of that land didn't agree with what
[23:04] Daniel was doing or saying
[23:07] Daniel was on his knees three times a
[23:10] day in his little room the window facing
[23:14] out to Jerusalem and he prayed to his
[23:17] Lord and they didn't like that so they
[23:21] went to the king and they made a decree
[23:23] that you know people that don't do what
[23:25] we say must get thrown into lion's den
[23:27] and you know what happens if you get
[23:31] thrown to the Lions Den this nothing
[23:36] else to say it's finished but yet we
[23:41] have a man the Lord has used this man in
[23:46] a mighty way yes they threw him into the
[23:50] into the den of the Lions knowing that's
[23:53] it it's finished we don't have to hear
[23:56] from him again we won't hear his prey as
[23:58] a game no one would be following the way
[24:00] he followed it's all done it's finished
[24:04] put ourselves in this situation in this
[24:08] world today we are thee we are gettin
[24:11] kicked from our work colleagues from our
[24:14] families from the people that live
[24:16] around us people that we see out in the
[24:19] street you strange funny people you're
[24:21] going to church on a witness day night

[24:30] we can go out to the rugby game to the
[24:32] soccer game we can have a few drinks we
[24:34] can go just go dancing or whatever you

[24:44] I'll pay for it's all right you know
[24:46] make it so easy fall in a trap this
[24:49] world is made to trap us
[24:56] everything that's out in this world is
[24:58] made to trap us it's like how Daniel was
[25:01] thrown in that trap the line strip
[25:03] everything that we do in our daily walk
[25:06] this snares on the way just laid out
[25:09] just laid out for each one of us but yet
[25:12] the Lord takes us and it just lifts off
[25:15] over the Snee jump over the hurdle jump
[25:18] over this problem at times as human in
[25:21] this flesh we'll make that mistake
[25:24] we might take that wrong road we might
[25:27] argue we might say something to hurt
[25:30] someone some bad seed spread out to
[25:34] somebody and then you sit down for five
[25:37] minutes and open the word or you sit
[25:39] down for five minutes and just meditate
[25:40] on the Lord sit down for five minutes
[25:42] and just want to sing a song of praise
[25:44] it comes back to you and says hey you
[25:46] did this wrong thing ball is in your
[25:49] court what are you gonna do I'll use my
[25:53] situation today the devil is trying this
[25:56] morning I got to work my wife phones me
[25:59] can you please pick up bridge and milk
[26:02] and a few bits and pieces for the home
[26:03] no no no I'm too busy I'm sorting out
[26:05] the stock take I'm preparing for my
[26:07] financially audit I can't do it put the
[26:12] phone down you need to sort it out
[26:13] having an argument my wife and I and I
[26:18] will go by maybe two hours go by Oh
[26:21] something is wrong something is wrong
[26:25] atmosphere is not right for at home
[26:28] sorry my love it's a devil the wife
[26:34] called you to do the normal thing I
[26:35] normally pick up the blade of milk I
[26:37] normally pick up the bits and pieces on
[26:39] my way and sadly today it was a problem
[26:42] that's the devil making a problem so
[26:45] when you come home the atmosphere is not
[26:47] right when you come to church today the
[26:48] atmosphere is not right just a small
[26:51] step a small snail along the way and you
[26:53] stumbled but you came now and you played
[26:56] like nothing happened I didn't say
[26:57] anything I didn't do anything I'm an
[26:59] innocent man no no no we need to see it
[27:02] we need to see where the Lord is
[27:04] pointing us and what he's doing
[27:06] we need to stand on his word
[27:08] Daniel stood on his word he didn't
[27:11] change for no one not for the king not
[27:13] for the president not for the princes
[27:15] three times a day on his knee
[27:17] how many times a day are we on our knees
[27:20] many times a day are we praying how many
[27:24] times a day myself as well I'm not
[27:26] talking to you I'm talking to myself
[27:28] what am i doing so Daniel was in that
[27:34] situation and yet the mighty hand of the
[27:39] Lord has saved him sent his angel to
[27:42] camp around him and that enemy could not
[27:46] devour him or even scratch him not even
[27:50] a scratch you've seen a lion you seen
[27:54] his cross his paws there were three
[27:57] times the size of my hand just one maybe
[28:00] more the weight of it will just push you
[28:03] down you'll just be smashed and one just
[28:06] if he runs through the song we sang this
[28:10] evening the love of Jesus is so
[28:14] wonderful it doesn't stop the way it's
[28:18] too wide and you can't get around it
[28:20] what is asking you is to push through it
[28:24] don't let it be in your way too high too
[28:28] low
[28:28] too big too small he wants us to push
[28:31] through we don't want to be stagnant we
[28:34] don't want to be just standing and
[28:35] receiving all the enemy's tears and
[28:37] thorns he wants us to push through the
[28:40] problems
[28:41] push through the trials push through
[28:44] everything that's in our way because he
[28:46] didn't ask us to just come here and take
[28:49] a Pew you didn't ask us just to come
[28:52] here and you're only going to be a song
[28:54] leader you're only going to be a sound
[28:57] disc operator no he's using each one of
[29:01] us in a different way as I said I'm not
[29:04] a preacher I lean on my brothers I lean
[29:08] on the the people that surround me and
[29:10] your talk to me and share with me and
[29:14] support me and I'm standing here in
[29:17] front of you
[29:23] maybe in things of the normal day-to-day
[29:26] living of my job and everything else I
[29:28] can talk you know the field I'm in I can
[29:32] talk about it was very hard for me to
[29:34] talk about the Lord but the Lord has
[29:37] done something is came and dwelt in my
[29:42] heart
[29:42] and I know he's real I been through a
[29:47] lot of trials in my life but here I
[29:50] stand here in front of you victorious
[29:53] it's provided all my needs and
[29:55] abundantly is kept my family together
[29:59] and it's kept my family strong yes my
[30:02] one daughter is not here with me he's in
[30:07] the Lord's hands she's in the Lord's
[30:10] hands so fighting and shouting and
[30:13] arguing and why you're not coming to
[30:15] church and why you don't want to do this
[30:17] it's all past sort of past you surrender
[30:20] that to the Lord and the Lord will do
[30:22] his work I want to share I want to share
[30:25] a message that brother Branham shed in
[30:30] 1961 in 1961 and thy seed shall possess
[30:40] the gates of his enemies
[30:45] and brother branham god loves to show
[30:53] his mighty hand yes he does he likes to
[30:58] show his power he's waiting tonight to
[31:02] show it in you for each one of you to
[31:07] take that sinner and turn him around to
[31:10] take that woman with ill-fame and
[31:11] changed her to a godly saintly woman or
[31:16] men take that girl that has taken the
[31:21] wrong road or the boy that's taken the
[31:24] wrong road and bring them back to the
[31:27] place and make them sons and daughters
[31:30] of God he's ready to take that man dying
[31:37] with cancer that one with the heart
[31:39] trouble the one that's blind the one
[31:42] that's afflicted if he will just place
[31:47] his faith in day it'll turn him around
[31:51] from death unto life start him start him
[31:57] off with a testimony he's waiting to do
[32:00] it it puts you right in the trap to see
[32:04] what you do so the Lord also puts us in
[32:09] a position where we got no chance to
[32:13] turn left or right but just look up to
[32:15] him if we are going to be in the corner
[32:19] and we stuck what are we doing he puts
[32:22] you there to see what you made of he did
[32:26] that to job in the Bible he did that to
[32:28] other two other priests in the Bible to
[32:34] other prophets in the Bible so he's
[32:38] doing it to you because he has chosen
[32:40] you each one of you you his bride is
[32:42] getting you ready he wants your spotless
[32:45] he wants you clean he wants you with
[32:47] nothing no one can throw a stone at you
[32:51] that's how clean he wants you yes your
[32:53] past is your past but he's cleansing you
[32:57] if teaming you up is making you
[32:58] beautiful it's making you better is
[33:00] bringing it to your stage where you'll
[33:04] be a spotless bride for him that's
[33:16] technology
[33:21] look like nature itself was hiding its
[33:24] face yes one writer one day one writer
[33:28] said one time that when they got into
[33:33] that place wondered what Moses would do
[33:36] our pastor preached on that on Sunday
[33:40] what Moses would do he had one
[33:44] commandment go forward if you are in the
[33:50] line of duty no matter what stays in
[33:53] your way the greatest experience I've
[33:56] ever had
[33:57] is to come up against something I
[33:59] couldn't get over it or under it and
[34:02] just stand there and watch God make the
[34:06] way through it
[34:10] that's the way to do it just keep just
[34:14] move keep moving place your nose against
[34:17] it just keep moving on just keep going
[34:21] on God will make a way that's why I sang
[34:26] that song because the song doesn't stop
[34:30] they just says God will make a way you
[34:33] just go through it he's given us the
[34:37] sword the Lord Jesus has given us a
[34:39] sword maybe it doesn't look sharp but
[34:45] the words are sharp every word will
[34:48] pierce you it'll cut you then he gives
[34:52] us a shield on our left hand to protect
[34:55] the parts that are I still saw from the
[34:58] beating you got before so you've got a
[35:02] shield in your left hand you've got the
[35:03] sword in your right hand who's going to
[35:06] stand in your way
[35:08] push forward go through so brothers and
[35:13] sisters that's my encouragement to you
[35:17] today don't give up
[35:22] take your sword hold up your shield and
[35:26] push through fight this battle like you
[35:30] like you're a young 20 year old fighting
[35:33] this battle fight this battle that you
[35:36] will not give up fight this battle to
[35:39] stand on this word because this word has
[35:43] made us who we are today
[35:45] it's brought us from that muck and mire
[35:49] into where we are now we would never the
[35:54] last place I would have been found is in
[35:55] the house of God out of drove right past
[35:59] us
[36:03] enjoy yourself
[36:05] I'll see you later I'll come for lunch
[36:08] though but he had his way he had his way
[36:16] no one ever e-ever it shall be different
[36:20] and it's trial different brother Chris's
[36:23] trial different brother our mind is
[36:25] different James brother then pour
[36:27] different brother Isaac different but
[36:30] when we come here there's only one word
[36:34] the Word of God that brings us together
[36:37] no matter which style you came from how
[36:40] big how small how rich how poor who can
[36:45] they say that's poor the Lord is
[36:49] providing your need you want something
[36:52] you ask you want something you get down
