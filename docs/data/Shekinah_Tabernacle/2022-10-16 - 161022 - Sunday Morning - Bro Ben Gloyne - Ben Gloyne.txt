remind the devil there too my sins are gone demon amen hallelujah amen praise the Lord let's um thank you musicians thank you brother Isaac thank you praise the Lord let's go to First Corinthians 15 again we're just going to reread the um scripture I just want to continue from Wednesday and then we're going to read First Corinthians 15 1 to 4. I mean then we're gonna go to Matthew 9 20 to 22 just a bit of a context here amen who's excited for Camp praise the Lord so just a reminder that there's no midweek service here on Wednesdays we come here looking for service well they'll be packing up the sound stuff so maybe you can give a service if you want to help out but um so we won't have a service but keep this um camp in prayer and um and also the Wednesday after camp we won't have a service either because we're putting everything back in So First Corinthians 15 and verses one to four uh moreover brethren I declare unto you the gospel which I have preached unto you which also ye have received and when you stand by which also ye are saved if you if you keep in memory that which I appreciate unto you unless you have believed in vain fry delivered unto you first of all that which I also received how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures and that he was buried and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures I like that how the impossible repeat according so Jesus just didn't do things haphazardly and the prophecies weren't written after he did them but before the time and he fulfilled them amen and go Matthew 9 20 to 22 and then you can have your seats here I mean Matthew 9 20 to 22 um says here's about the woman with the blood issue for 12 years here we can see and says and behold a woman which was diseased with an issue of blood 12 years came behind him attached to him of His Garment for she said within herself if I may but touch His Garment I'll be made whole but Jesus turned him about and when he saw her he said daughter be of good Comfort thy faith has made the whole and the woman was made whole that from that hour amen praise the Lord let's bow our heads in a word of prayer this morning gracious father we thank you so much Lord that you washed all of our sins away Lord if we've given our whole lives into your hands repented confessed our sins confessed our wrongs Lord as your word says Lord if we confess our sins unto you Lord you're faithful and just to forgive us and we thank you Lord that Lord for your Supreme mercy upon Our Lives we thank you for your great grace Lord Jesus in us we want to thank you dear God we can assemble ourselves one more time for other we are asking Lord and for the unction of the Holy Ghost Lord may your anointing come and Lord may your word come to the life in our hearts oh God not just during speaker but in here oh God may your word burn father unto us Lord Jesus and may we walk out of these doors change Lord renewed Lord refresh Lord we're looking forward to Camp next weekend father we pray that Lord may you meet us there in a mighty way and Lord May our hearts be ready for that time oh God and may come and touch many lives Lord May everyone be impacted because of your great divine presence and we're asking you do the same to today oh God may come and meet us Lord we thank you Lord we can commit Our Lives into your hands and we're asking may you cover us in your blood Lord may he forgive us of all our sins and our wrongs Lord our trespasses cleanses of our secret faults oh God and Lord we just pray just hide us under the shed of thy Wings this morning Lord may you bind any hindering Spirit there's not of you in this place it might be cast out the name of Jesus Christ and may he have preeminence Among Us Lord we love you so much we're asking Lord we want to thankful Lord we want to thank you you're mindful of everyone in every situation Lord those who are second body who could not be here today maybe their portion or those who may be watching this by the way the internet Lord May touch their lives as well oh God may be so real to them as well father granted dear God without you we can do nothing Lord so therefore we surrender all that we are into your hands Lord that you can do what you want to do in this service granted dear God we thank you so much and we love you in Jesus Christ's name amen amen God bless you friends you may have your seat so I want to continue on from Wednesday I was thinking about how Jesus would would uh how he did these things according to the scripture and that the Apostle Paul would would repeat this phrase twice here because he's wanting the people to see that at the life of the Lord Jesus Christ was a fulfillment of scripture it wasn't just a haphazard life where you know he tried to do some political coup and start a new movement and die to death and maybe thought well someone would you know believe on me after I'd died or you know some people think that he didn't even die on the cross but he went and lived in India and died there and all this kind of nonsense but no he didn't do those things he purchased our Salvation on Calvary he was the Lamb of God that would take away the sin of the world and he fulfilled over 300 prophecies in his lifetime and we know that as he is here to fulfill the word or he was he is here to fulfill the word because he's still the same God today fulfilling his word he has placed us upon the Earth to fulfill his word as well now you think about this woman with the blood issue where she would have no doubt heard many stories of of Mighty prophets of old and you know no doubt you would have heard the story of of Elijah where where the um whether where the woman's um son uh uh you know the widow woman's son would die and then you know Elijah would would stretch himself out upon the child three times it says in First Kings 17 and he cried unto the Lord said Lord my God I pray thee let this child's Soul come back into him again and that and that child was raised from the dead so you're the physical touch of the Prophet would actually Raise A Man from the dead and then when you know years later after after the one who continued on the ministry of Elijah Elisha that same anointing Came Upon Elisha and then after he was dead and buried where where men would be packing packing a dead man it was a battle time and you know they threw him into the simple core of Elisha and that man as he has let down when he touched the bones of Elijah he came back to life again what a what incredible situation that would have been and here's your friend maybe you're carrying your companion and your broken hearted he's dead and you just got to bury him quickly because there's trouble around you and you lower his body into the Sepulcher but as soon as he touches that bottom of that simple girl comes back to life and you know I believe that that there's going to be people come to Camp who are dead but they're gonna not stay dead they're gonna but they may be spiritually dead and sins and trespasses but when they leave camp they're gonna be alive because they're going to be touched by the quickening power of the Holy Ghost answer no no doubt she would have you know maybe known about these stories and she would have thought you know she began to realize from hearing the testimonies of the Lord that that same life that was in the prophets was in him and so she began to think well by contact a boy could be raised and a dead man could come back to life again and so so no doubt if she could just Touch the Hem of His Garment you know she could be made whole because she had this issue of blood for 12 years and every doctor couldn't help her every remedy every every life hack on the internet some kind of medical thing that you know change of diet whatever it may be it couldn't help her but then she began to realize that if if if God is still God Amen and she could and you know the thing is about a Believer is they can equate what God did in the past if they see the same thing done today they realize the same God is alive today where it takes actually the grace of God to open her eyes to realize that prophecy is in fulfillment right in front of us that's why it's so you know we should so appreciate the Lord brightening our eyes on this day where where where the ministry of brother Branham was the ministry of Elijah to return our hearts back to the original faith of the fathers and that it was a restoration of the Bible as a restoration of the word it wasn't another movement it wasn't another Bible we don't follow another Bible we do not have another testimony of Jesus Christ like the Mormons do we have the scripture restored back to its rightful place and we'll come into that again soon but you know brother Brown would would would dramatize this woman here before she touches the Lord you know he says one morning while sitting out as we would think on the porch with her little fingers trembling trying to do a little crocheting or knit uh or or knitting and she looked down there there's a little noise taking place down at the seaside a little boat pushed into the Willows and she happened to look she was sitting there thinking now all my money is gone what will I do next see probably be put out of the home the mortgage has done took that we don't even have food to eat or nothing else and I can't get no relief and it was probably the darkest hour she had ever seen and about that time the little boat pushed in and Jesus come along she goes down to the river with a little trembling body and just remember because Jesus come every devil at hell will try and keep you away from him right just to come to a church or come to Camp doesn't mean you're going to get the victory the Lord's there but every devil is going to try and Ward you off on the promise of God but you're going to push through every devil push her every unbelief all mine battles I remember the first time I ever set foot in the message Church there was a voice saying to me leave walk out there's nothing here go out of here I never had that problem in the Pentecostal church I never had that problem with an Anglican Church abortion School a Presbyterian Church at another boarding school I never had those troubles in charismatic churches but when I came among the truth the devil was on my shoulder saying leave there's nothing here you don't fit here you're not welcome this and I just told them I'm not leaving you leave amen amen see but you gotta see every devil in hell will try and keep us from the promise of the word he'll try and keep you away from it that's right but you might hear the message but the devil will sit right on your shoulder and say don't listen don't you listen don't you listen but you don't believe him he said whosoever will come and drink from the Waters of Life freely the Devils even say don't listen to him he's a he's of the devil so if he can't get you to leave out and try and make you disbelieve what you're hearing that it's actually of the enemy and the little woman got down to where Jesus was coming up and the people rallying around him the poor and so forth and there stood the priests and all the great leaders of her religion and they are making fun of and they said oh you're the one who heals the sick are you well we've got plenty of sick let's see you heal them well you're the one who raises the dead are you we've got a graveyard full up here let's see you raised him he never paid he never even paid a bit of attention to them he just walked on he had one thing to do and that was the thing that God showed him to do nothing less or nothing more I like that he just did exactly what the father showed him to do and I believe we are in the and can be in the same condition like that amen amen that we only do that whether I believe that we can come to a place and I believe because of the baptism of the Holy Ghost that we can live such a life that we can have the same testimony Jesus had we says I always do that which pleases the father amen because we're made of the same material he's made of by the baptism of the Holy Ghost right so when the Christian gets to that place without lay aside and not listen to all the Scandal and stuff that said and all the going on and have one motive that's to do the will of God that God sent you to do there'll be a different day and a different church amen if we can get to a place where we don't sit in a song service or stand and look around what everyone else is doing that we don't get to you know you know you know we get Beyond wondering what everyone else is thinking about us and wonder about you know is this right or wrong or whatever more if we can get past all of that stuff and actually say we're here for one purpose it's not to please my neighbor it's not to try and outshine the person next to me in front of me or behind me but we're comfortable for one purpose to worship the true and living God see true worship comes where you forget about everyone around you amen you don't care about what everyone else is doing you can have a conference with God in your seat by yourself and that's all that matters it don't matter what everyone else thinks and what everyone else is doing we're here to worship God I'm here to worship God myself amen amen so so if we get that one motive that's to do the will of God what God sent you to do there'll be a different day in a different church and I pray we have a different day in a different church that we go higher than we've been amen we're not here to Plateau right we're here to ascend amen here he she walked down to this crowd and Jesus was walking along in a slow steady walk and people were running up to him saying are you the prophet are you this are you that say how about coming over here and doing something for me see people just want God to do things for them that's the wrong motive amen when you come in humility with a need that's a different thing but people say hey come and do this if you're really God if this is really true do this for me you know that's not how it works let me see you perform a miracle we would love you to turn the waters to Wine here's a jug full of it now I read this last night I thought man I've heard this so many times I'd like to have some they say it's good one make this wine let me see how it tastes see people say yeah I want to see him turn water into wine do that now if you're the same if he's really in you I want to see what it tastes who's heard that kind of stuff hey man he never even raised his head he just kept walking on that makes me love him the prophet said amen you know it takes it see it takes little pity it takes little bitty Petty people to fuss and argue a big man never pays any attention to nothing like that Christians don't notice what the world says if they want to say anything they want to they've got see but but they're too big to notice these little bit bitty things they just keep moving on just going on the little woman thought now it's the only hour I'll ever see in my last opportunity the only opportunity I've ever had and I truly believe if I can just touch the him the Garment of that man I'll be made well he says what a faith and what a Time so so she had seen what she read in the Old Testament I heard in the Old Testament was living now in front of her and she realized if I could just touch him I'll get the same results I'll get healing I'll get deliverance from this issue so she zeroed into her need and the fact that the one that she could the one that could heal her was was was in her presence and she didn't care about what everyone else was doing what everyone else was saying who cares about people's opinion honestly I I just I'm just interested in the word of God and what he has to say I think that's far more valuable than people's opinion a lot of opinion kept people out of the arka Noah's day we just watched The Sight and Sound play on Noah you know there's a lot of opinions about things the people swayed people even out of the Ark it was dramatized but I believe that would have happened but you see so but it was all man's opinion but Noah had the word of the Lord and thing is it wasn't just a different idea and let's build an ark no God really did Flood The World God really did bring bring Deliverance see it wasn't just something to do in different religion let's have a let's make a boat no it was God's provided way and so is the word of God and this hour God's provided way but it produces what it says it will produce now some people think if they could only go back into Jesus day they could be like the one with the well Touch the Hem of His Garment and they'll be made whole but we can do the same amen amen because the Bible tells us in Hebrews 4 we have he says for we have not in high priest which cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities but it was in all points tempted like we are yet without sin so let us therefore come boldly unto the throne of grace that we may obtain mercy and find Grace to help in time of need so we have a high priest that can be touched by the feeling of our infirmity see brother Brown many times when the discernment was going on people back in the audience he'd call them out show them what they're thinking about what they've been praying about their needs were and he would ask the question who did she touch who did he touch you know they're 20 feet 30 feet from me he's saying they touch the high priest but what was happening the high priest Jesus Christ himself stepped under that Prophet vessel and revealed what their needs were so by faith they are touching the high priest but the high priest was on the platform revealing himself through a redeemed son of man I mean redeemed son right amen Hallelujah that's why that would happen now God loves to see his word become material he never intended it just to be fairy he never intended this just to be a theoretical Christianity is not theoretical Christianity is practical it's a reality it's a living word right it's not just Theory it's never meant to be just a lecture hall kind of a walk but it's an everyday practical walk amen somebody loves to see his word become material now the devil hates to see God's word become material he hates to see it become flesh but we have thousands of years of record of every time the devil tries to stop at manifesting he failed Hallelujah so he will continue to fail and stop in God's program but God's program is going to continue on Amen to weaken our full confidence what he has promised in this day is going to happen amen it's going to happen right on time on schedule yes under budget hallelujah it's all going to happen just fine right so we don't need to be worried as the Rapture gonna happen absolutely it's gonna happen and he has called you to be part of that rapture amen not just to be a bystander in the world but actually to be called up higher amen so he loves to see his word become material now he would say in Isaiah 55 and 10 for as the rain cometh down in the snow from heaven and returneth not hither but watereth the Earth and maketh it to for uh to bring forth and Bud that it may give sea to the sower and bread to the eater so shall my word that goeth forth out of my mouth it shall not return unto me void but it shall accomplish that which I please and it shall prosper and the thing we're unto I sent it for you shall go out with joy and be led with peace and mountains and Hills shall Break Forth before you into singing and all the trees of the field shall clap their hands so his word is not going to return to him void or empty he has not spoken a word just for it too just to Fritter off into nothing and not materialize but the same faith that he said let there be sun moon and stars and there is as the same Faith he said there'll be a bribe without spot or wrinkles washed in the blood of the Lamb Maiden has image I mean overcoming the devil walking out of this H triumphant amen that same that same Faith you had to create all things to the same faith when he spoke that word and prophesied of a bride being Victorious Made In His Image amen so his word shall not return to him void so there's not going to be he doesn't have a plan B he doesn't need a plan B God doesn't need Plan B he just has a plan a and as plan a is his perfect will of his worth and he's gonna find someone that's gonna fulfill it you know it's interesting what we read there in Isaiah 55 is his word shall not return unto him void that was after you know that was after Isaiah who spoke that had already prophesied that the Virgin shall conceive so she so so he had already spoken under inspiration maybe he wrote it down maybe a scribe wrote it down I'm not sure how that exactly worked but you know the inspiration came and he spoke that forth and so that that that was already been released upon the Earth and God is saying here that this will not return to him void now of many problems every promise applies in this way right so every promise will not return to him void it will accomplish that which you know every word it's going to accomplish that which I please and it shall prosper in the thing until I sent it see but you see when he said a virgin shall conceive he knew exactly the woman that was going to do it in his mind when he sparked the Thrive he knew it would be Mary he knew that she would be a spouse to Joseph he knew that the Roman government would be controlling Israel right I don't even know if the Romans were a thing back when Isaiah spoke that but they were a thing in God's mind they he knew the kingdom would come right and so so all those things were in God's mind you know he realized they would happen and so no doubt when many many Jewish believers who believed I was had to be a prophet when they heard that prophecy they thought my daughter's going to be the one but it was time locked for a certain season and in that season it came to pass remember everything of the world had to be in its position Rome had to be in charge of of Israel the scribes and Pharisees had to be there you know all the you know you know there had to be Mary had to be there the right woman had to be there he didn't have maybe a selection he had won and it's the same thing with your you and I he knows exactly you know if we could just look at look past the curtain of time and see our theophany you know theophany bodies if we can look past the curtain of time and the law could actually send us a video or a photo of this is your seat at the wedding supper table I think that would change a lot of things I think a lot of issues of life would just be blown away all Troubles of life would be put to one side all what this person says and this person thinks and what I think about this and blah blah blah blah that blah would be gone that would be muted because you realize actually I have a I've got a homo beyonder on the other Shore amen and we but we need to realize when the Holy Ghost comes into our lives and he changes us according to his word what is he telling you you have a home over here yes Hallelujah yes sir amen because it's the grace of God that leads us to repentance even so it's you know even just to repent and give your life completely to God you can say I've got a home Over Yonder I'm on my way Hallelujah is it just is what he says it just repentance no a true repentance gives a filling of the Holy Ghost amen so we do not follow cuddling the cunningly devised Fables right but that's the power of God God Reveals His word and he makes it material amen now he would say in Isaiah 43 and and we're going to come down to a special uh verse and this but we'll come down to it he says Isaiah 43 and 10 yeah my Witnesses saith the Lord and my servant whom I have chosen that ye may know and believe me and understand that I am he before me there is no God formed neither shall there be after me I even I am the Lord and besides me there's no savior amen I have declared and have saved I have showed that when there was no strange God among you therefore ye are my Witnesses saith the Lord I am God yeah before the day was I am he and there is none that can deliver out of my hand I will work and who shall let it no there's none that can deliver out of his hand so if you're in his hand the devil can't get you out of his hand I mean there's no one stronger than our father he's stronger than them all so it doesn't matter what weapon he forms against you against your children you've got to have faith no they're coming they don't have a choice in the matter they're coming home they're coming to the lord they're going in a Rapture I think we should have that kind of rugged face amen so so there's none that can deliver out of his hand I will work and who shall let it thus saith the Lord your Redeemer the Holy One of Israel for your sake I have sent to Babylon and brought down all their nobles and the Chaldeans whose cries and the ships I am the Lord your Holy One the creator of Israel your king thus saith the Lord which maketh the way in the sea in a path in the mighty Waters which bringeth forth The Chariot in the horse and the Army and the power they shall lie down together they shall not rise they are extinct and they are quenched as toe and that toe actually means a flax remember ye not the former things neither consider the things of old there's things we need to not remember of our past life right if we're a new creature in Christ we're a new creature in Christ if those things keep coming back into your mind you say thank God I'm not that person no more right because the deer wants to try and pull us back by our past but we should just say no I'm not that person anymore sure that person may have done that but that person died there's a new person living in this building Hallelujah so don't even consider things of old now this next verse is very special because when sister Vanessa received the Holy Ghost at our first ever service there's a tongues interpretation and the interpretation was behold I do a new thing and it shall spring forth shall you not know it I will even make a way in the wilderness and rivers in the in the desert sister Brawn he spoke this forth now people say well it shouldn't just be a repetition of scripture but hold on if that scripture is a prophecy and it applies to a place that's all well and good amen so so this was a promise the lord gave us that he will do a new thing amen amen and it and now it shall spring forth so it's not going to be in the it's going to be right now amen shall you not know it I'll even make a way in the wilderness and rivers in the desert now it's very interesting when you look at the singer new thing because some people couldn't stumble and think well how can God do a new thing because you think a new thing is something different now that word new new thing doesn't actually mean something different it means a restoration of what was there or what should be there so that word new it means a fresh new thing but the root word of that Hebrew word it means causatively to repair renew or rebuild so he says I'm gonna I'm gonna do a rebuilding I'm gonna do a renewal I'm gonna do a repair so when something's repaired or rebuilt now this is not rocket science but when something's repaired or rebuilt it's a restoration work yo it's like something breaks You Mend the broken pieces you glue it back together you fight restore missing parts you know you paint it you do whatever you need to do to restore it back to its former glory now the only way man can ever be restored is not a facelift it's not a paint job it's not a new set of clothes right it is not turning a new Leaf like a New Year's resolution but the only way a man can be restored or repaired or renewed is by the baptism of the Holy Ghost into the soul of man that changes the nature of man from unbelief to Faith that's the only way someone can be renewed there's no uh this is not a Reformation Center this is not seven steps to becoming a better Christian all right there's not seven steps to a happier life or whatever no there's only one well repentance be baptized name of Jesus Christ ambitious and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost and a true baptism of the Holy Ghost will ank you into the word that you will live according to the scripture not your own ideas right so now the only way we can ever be renewed or repaired is to receive the Holy Ghost which transforms us and then we walk in newness of life that we now walk above sin right the things which once dragged us down don't drag us down no more but we live above it it may try and drag us back down because we're still in these bodies right we're still you know receiving the Holy Ghost does not does not remove us from Temptation that's right right it doesn't put a force field around us that will no longer tempt a member the Lord Jesus the fullness of the god here bodily dwells in him but he was tempted on All Points like us but yet without sin so he was pulled just like we're pulled Temptation different things and every day yeah yeah the prophet says he was tempted by sexual Temptation he was tempted on every point because he was a man but yet he was without sin so he understands when we're tempted certain ways he understands amen so receiving the Holy Ghost does not remove Temptation out of your life but it gives you overcoming power over that Temptation amen that's why you can yield to the Holy Ghost and he'll give you overcoming power praise the Lord I'm so aren't you glad for that I mean I'm so thankful that we just don't you know we don't just continue on with unbelief but we actually can have a newness of life and where God comes and lives in us and changes our whole being but now when you think of rebuilding or or repairing you know my mind went to Elijah on Mount Carmel after you know it's amazing after the um you know prophets of Baal did their thing Hey it said that he repaired the altar of the Lord that was broken down so he did not build a new altar he repaired the one that had been abandoned had been forgotten had been left to fall into disrepair he rebuilt it He restored it the Lord did a new thing he did a rebuilding he did a renewal of a place of worship for God so he so he rebuilt the altar of the law that had fallen down so now there were Stones there see he didn't go get new stones but he took the stones that were formerly part of the Altar and rebuilt them so the altar was restored now we know an altar is a place of sacrifice and altar is a place of communion right many times you know like like abrahammy you know put some sacrifices out and God came down and burnt them up and spoke to him you know that was that's what would happen when an altar would would be built the right kind of altar that God would come down and commune with his people so now this rebuilding of the altar now these Stones now are are Revelation Stones now if we jump forward to this day you know there's been 2 000 years nearly of when the altar of God has been abandoned right it was rebuilt on the day if it was built on the day of Pentecost right with the doctrine of the Apostles and the prophets and the result remember the result of a real altar is the Firefall yes right the the sacrifice just doesn't sit there and look pretty and say what a great sacrifice but the fire of God comes down and consumes the offering that's the results see see people can argue all that they want about the message being wrong and conspiracy theories about brother brown but what does the message produced amen I can't speak for the rest of the message world but for myself I see the fire of God fall I see the word put on flesh I see I see this Bible goes from print form into flesh that's what I see so you know to me that kind of throws every argument out of the way because what does it pro juice Hallelujah so Elijah the you know the prophets of bowel can be saying all they want but Elijah was rebuilding the altar now as I said the that item that that that altar was there on the day of Pentecost and the fire fell yeah but then it was neglected and the because the church went into eventually into a dark age but God said I will restore so now there were all these Stones there that were put Revelations were slowly put some weren't quite right somewhat you know because there was a lot of loose ends and man's ideas trying to probe into the scripture which God blessed them for it right but in the evening time because that's when Elijah rebuilt the altar at the evening time the Elijah here in the evening time right he came and he took Revelation stones of the word amen he took the stone of the Oneness of God Amen but he's not one like your finger because your finger only has one manifestation right I remember when brother Pedro did that it's just like a light bulb moment because your finger can only do this that God's one but not like your finger because your finger only can only do one manifestation the God can come in Angelic form he came as Melchizedek right he appeared as an angel many time going through Pillar of Fire by now Cloud by day that was God right he came and you know as the Lord Jesus Christ the Lamb of God take away the sin of the world as a as the son of David right and then that same Jesus Christ changed form and now dwelt in the in The Believer all the way down through the ages of the Holy Ghost amen so now here we are here take so so take that kind of Revelation Stone it had been there originally he put it back in the altar and then he took baptism in the name of Jesus Christ that's the only there's only one form of baptism it's not two or three or whatever you know this is not like a smorgasbord religion amen you know you can go to Subway and you can build your sandwich exactly how you want it based on the ingredients to try and please everyone this is not how it works with the word there's one sandwich if I put it currently there's one sandwich you got to take all the fillings you can't throw away the jalapenos or the Cucumber or the lettuce or no you're gonna have the whole word from cover to cover and just eat the maps too because you'll find your way around right so so he took all these all these stones the way to dress right the way to treat your family actually a full surrender surrendered her every Revelation and then he put the stones there a lot of those stones had to be dusted off like baptism sure they had a revelation you know the anabaptists came out that adults should be baptized but they were still sprinkling adults a lot of dirt and mud was on that stone then finally it was immersion there was a bit of dirt taken off but there was fully restored to what it should be a lot of dirt had to be taken off then it was placed there but then now the sacrifice had to be put on the altar yes and you come to find out when God puts Revelation stones in your heart you begin to realize actually the sacrifice is me you know it's all very easy to say Well when someone else does it you know it's just like I remind you yeah it's like reminding that story there's a guy with a you know on a tightrope and he's got a wheelbarrow no first he walks along the tightrope people are watching him and he's walking on the tightrope like those people are cheering him and then he gets a wheelbarrow and he walks along people like wow that's so amazing and then he says no who wants to get in the wheelbarrow the crowd really silences down because they have all confidence that he can do it but then now they put themselves in the equation but in order to get into the wheelbarrow and get safely across you've got to fully surrender to the one pushing the Barrow right you've got to fully surrender to the one pushing the Barrow because if you imagine if you're sitting there and you're panicking you'll start jerking like this because you know he's going to stabilize you and you start doing this what's gonna happen you're gonna you're gonna fall off but if you're fully surrendered to him you just sit there as calmly as can be as still as you can be right and then a lot and then the Lord can take you across that's exactly what you've got to do with the word you can't try and stabilize it or even just watch it go across you've got to get into it you've got to fully identify yourself with the word and the only way the law can take across whereas with a full surrender a full confidence and trust that the one pushing the Barrow he's professional he's done this before hallelujah how many how many tens of millions or of people has he taken across the chasm of death but you've got to trust him Hallelujah amen so then now then now the stones were placed but now the sacrifice now I said all that about the wheelbarrow because it's easy when you say yeah praise the Lord but now you're the sacrifice and you've got to be willing we have to be willing to lay aside everything to allow whole bodies as a sacrifice brother man would say this and God's provided a way Elijah said now get everything together give me a stone here to represent each of them put the sacrifice upon it walked out there he said now Lord let it be known that thou art the god of Heaven I am your prophet and the fire Begin to Fall brother when the methodists can forget that they're the only people on the Earth and the Baptists they're the only the Pentecostals they're the only we can get all ourselves together and say Lord send the fire we're going to get somewhere that's right when the one that's Pentecostal the turn is Pentecostal three in this Pentecostal fiveness Pentecost and all of them can get their heads together when all the methodists can forget about sprinkling and whether you're baptized or whether you're poor or whether you do this and everybody get together and forget about all them little old things and say God send the power everything will take care of itself get the heart right with the Holy Ghost and the Holy Ghost will take care of the rest of it I mean how many times do we get so caught up in things which really people just need the Holy Ghost and God will take care of the rest of it yes sir amen I believe that that kind of a Revival get God's provide away roll one stone up of Salvation I believe that roll up the stone of speaking in tongues I believe that roll up the stone of interpretation I believe that roll up the stone of of Divine Healing I believe that Brethren get ready for the fire now that's sure now I'm just going to forget all about our theology Lord I'm just rolling up these Stones I'm gonna lay myself right across it oh Lord burn me up amen he will do it don't worry he'll get you I like that he'll do it don't worry he'll get you see when we're just ready to forget about all our own theology what kind of theology well I've got to be good enough for long enough therefore I Merit the Holy Ghost oh you know yo some people are so caught in a legalistic cycle and then the more legalistic they get is because the more struggling they become and the more they push down on one another we shouldn't be that way just get rid of that kind of theology it's just come to the Lord amen amen a pardon must be received as a pardon rise you've got to receive the Lord you've got to receive his pardoning grace what do I need to do to Merit it just receive it yeah amen you just lay yourself right across and say oh Lord burn me up he'll do it don't worry he'll get you see after Elijah rebuilt the altar Lord and he and he put the sacrifice on exactly as the Lord said watered and everything then the fire fell and his final prayer he said Lord I've done all this according to your word amen so so God God's word became material you could say that Elijah rebuilt the altar according to the scripture amen amen because it was it wasn't written down but it was a revelation to him and it wasn't contrary to the written word amen so so the fire fell now that was the proof that was the proof that Elijah was Vindicated by God right it wasn't the fact that the prophets of Baal couldn't call Fire it was that God Amen Elijah and when God amends Our Lives with his presence with a moving in power with his hand of Deliverance with healing with restoration with love a joy a real peace with an anchoring faith it won't move from the word when he comes in in amens and that's what I'm looking for even in a service like this or at camp that God will come in and amen and bring souls to the Altar and bring deliverance and bring healing and mend hearts and fill with the Holy Ghost and break a glass ceiling the Devil's Tomb he tries to keep on us and we can't praise God Amen I am believing that he's gonna am in his words Hallelujah I'm believing that that's what I'm looking for amen the supernatural element is so important Hallelujah so now the proof that Elijah in the end time restored the altar or the Revelation stones of the word back into the altar of the Lord as that the fire fell just like it did on the day of Pentecost Hallelujah the same baptism of the Holy Ghost they received we received amen now that is the proof that it is it is thus saith the Lord according to the scripture because the same Holy Ghost 2000 years ago that fell there now comes and falls upon us and we are led by the spirit of God just like they were amen see on the day of Pentecost when it was fully come they were with one Accord in one place yes yes now one Accord means to be with one mind to be with one Accord with one passion I like that with one passion one burning desire amen that's what they had they wanted to see the word fulfilled now they did not just sit there and say well it's been eight days now I'm sure we feel different because by faith we receive it right let's go out and start our ministry maybe Andrew said that but Peter said no hold on we've got to receive power I can't go out and preach the same way I came into this room because when when I came into this room the smallest you know pressure came on me of some woman by a fire and they said aren't you one of them and I deny the Lord three times I need a change in my heart so I can go out and face far bigger Giants than just them amen so that he said no there's got to be something really happened and that's why when the day of Pentecost fully came now with one heart one mind one Accord that was one passion now we read earlier that if we could have one motive that's to do the will of God then what God sent you to do there'll be a different day and a different church I mean so if we could just have that one motive Lord I want to see you live I want to see Souls come to the kingdom I want to see demons cast out I want to see a stability coming to lives obviously a piece of puzzle understanding rest in the hearts of man amen that people will come into a true spiritual relationship with the Lord Jesus Christ amen and live according to his word that's what we want to see you may think well I need direction in my life just make that your passion and he'll take care of everything else where should I go what job should I have just make that your passion and he'll take care of everything else amen because Jesus said seek ye first the kingdom of God and his righteousness and all these things shall be added to you so we need to seek his kingdom and his righteousness amen so it should be our passion now I'm not saying these things like it's not your passion but I was wondering let's have a rally before we have camp because I believe this is going to be the greatest Camp that's going to strike the Earth that's just how I feel that's the expectation because God has taken her expectation Times by a billion and poured himself out greatly amen so you know but there's going to be opposition at Camp the devil doesn't like us having holy ghost film meetings the devil doesn't like us having times of Deliverance he doesn't like being cast out he wants to keep a dampner on the place to stop breakthroughs from from happening but our God has determined there's going to be a breakthrough because he wants to see his people free right but it's the same thing as brother Bram saw that vision of a people and they were in prison and they had like cancerous gross on them and things they couldn't see properly but yet they were Believers but things that caused him to go into this prison maybe it was maybe it was a bit of resentment maybe a misunderstanding maybe some pain came in or people got too familiar with one another and yo your misunderstandings happened hurts common that can put you in a prison yeah right but then you know he was called to deliver the people and the Lord came and stood by him and the Lord told him you deliver the people he said how can I break these bars and these things they're so big he just said well House of Hell give way to the name of Jesus Christ and every prison bar came tore loose and everyone went free so if you could take that because God is you know God's plan is tied with man God's Plan of Redemption is timed with Tide with man right he could have got the moon the Sun the Stars to preach the gospel he could have just sent angels to go preach but he decided to speak and live through man that his plan would be tied to man amen just like when when Cornelius is praying in his house he's a gentile we're in Acts chapter 10. and an angel comes to him and says Cornelius your prayers your arms have come before God now he could have said now receive you the Holy Ghost Jesus is the Messiah he's died he's fulfilled the Old Testament now come and let God come and dwell on you but he said no send me into jopper and find Peter he'll tell you the way of life so God's plan is tied with man so I believe that we should see see that's why that's why to me that Vision that brother bam saw the prison is so scriptural because God says you deliver them yeah because God wants to use your lips he wants to use your voice he wants to use your prayer he wants to use your life I mean to sit captives free Hallelujah not to bind people down but to liberate people I mean that's why it's so important when we come to Campbell's service you know we can create an atmosphere around us that God steps down but if we keep looking at people around us and what's going on we're distracted yeah right but if we realize no I'm here to commune with my maker the one the redeemed me the one that saved me he set me free and now I've come to worship Him Hallelujah and then now that body comes together what can God do oh baby it is unlimited he is Unlimited in his potential amen says that question now say we are sent here to be a lighthouse to be a Haven of Rest For People amen that that that that Rivers would flow in a desert amen that God would do a new thing he would rebuild people's lives to be a Living Sacrifice to himself for his glory amen you may think I'm looking for direction in my life well make your focus God and God will take care of the rest of your life amen whatever you do and wherever this goes people watch this you know many places become part of a body of Believers to accomplish that don't be a person by yourself don't just be part of a fellowship by proxy and say bye no no put your time in put your effort in put your energies in put your personal presence there I meant so important you know someone's presence there a testimony can actually hold back people going into idolatry the elders that would outlived Joshua were living Witnesses of God's deliverance and bring them into the land and the Bible says after they died then Israel went to idolatry so just those testimonies those time-tested memorials maybe they're 80 90 years old you know but they're but just their presence and their testimony kept Israel on the course amen she said I don't make a difference you make a world of difference amen you're you're impact all of your impact as a as a great impact for the kingdom of God never think that you're not important the devil tries to tell you you're not important but you're the apple of God's eye you're his beloved you're his redeemed Ransom wonderful bride his wife amen so that's why we should always gather and be part of a group of Believers and I'll say if you need to move well you move make it happen now see a Wilderness here it's by implication it means a desert that's amazing when you think of a desert there's no food there's a famine and now uh Amos was saying Amos 8 11 behold the day come say the Lord God that I'll send a famine in the land not a famine of bread nor a thirst for water but of hearing the words of the Lord but let's just backtrack Jesus said out of your bowels out of your belly shall flow rivers of Living Water right so if you if you have the Fountain of God within you the Holy Ghost you'll be a blessing to one another right you won't need to be petted baby to Long push no no there'll be the life of God will flowing out of you you'll be an oasis where people come into your presence maybe they're all frazzled and stressed and troubled but after they've taken a drink a bit of Fellowship they walk their afresh renewed hey man Revitalize that that's how we should be for one another right amen so we're not just having a drink we're here that the Lord would give out praise the Lord shall we drink because we've got to drink and grow but there's your out of vibe Valley Shuffle rivers of Living Waters amen no let's just jump forward again so he says I'll send a famine in the land he says behold the days come saith the Lord that I'll send a famine in the land not a famine of bread nor the thirst for water but of the hearing of the words of the Lord so not a famine of Bibles or religion or churches but hearing the words of the Lord now what is the words of the Lord that's inspired word of God so there'll be a famine in the land not for bread or thirst of water we have food and abundance okay we live like Emperors I think even Julius Caesar or whatever the greatest Kings there are upon the Earth they eat nothing in bed while we eat you know it used to be in England mate oh I think it actually it kind of still is but you know Medieval Times they'd have some salt the Kings and stuff they think man we've really got something just some salt and we can get sea salt we can get Himalayan salt what kind of grind do you want you want fine grind coarse grind we can get Murray River salt flakes we can get all different kinds of salt and they just have probably one kind of sea salt so much and you think of the flavors we can eat within the types of meat and the kinds of vegetables and things man we just and if we don't get it within a couple hours we begin to complain [Music] wait so there's not a famine for food but hearing the words of the Lord but he said in a desert in a wilderness I'll bring waters in the desert amen now right if it stopped raining here long enough the Hutt River will be just the be the Hutt River bed because there won't be any water in it right if you if you know if you stop the rain the water stops there's no more flowing of river right amen I'm sure that's not shocking to anyone right so so if there's if there's rivers in the desert there's got to be rain somewhere now the Lord promised us the former and the latter rain now now I'm saying these things now I trust this is not abstract to you because you're living in the rain it's not just naturally it rains here most of the year right it's spiritually there's rain hallelujah amen he said I will give you the former and the letter Reign now now the former reign in the Hebrew means a teaching Ray so so there'd be a there'll be a teaching go forth and then the latter rain is the Harvest or the quickening rain now it's amazing where brother Brown was saying um spoken worthy original seat he'd say that oh Roberts and Billy Graham would sew for the World Council of churches and they have yeah that was back in early 60s I think he said that amen but then he said that that that the ministry of Malachi 4 would sow for the bride amen so if they have served for the World Council churches that's what they've produced and what does this message produced the bride of Christ Christ and bride form amen so he says be glad you then you children of Zion and rejoice in the Lord your God for he has given you the former Reign moderately and he will cause to come down for you the rain the former and the latter rain in the first month now if you think of the first month when they came out of Egypt Moses was told this is the beginning of months for you this is the beginning of days I mean so it was tied in the first months was tied in with the Exodus yeah Hallelujah so now if you've come under the blood the blood's been applied to your body your spirit and your soul so the spirit of God has been applied to all three Realms not just your body for healing not just your spirit for deliverance but it's he's come down and dwelt in your soul the blood's been applied before the blood can be applied you become one with your sacrifice every part of it not just the ribs not just the cutlets not just the shanks but the whole thing so not just the bits of the word that oh that sounds nice you know we all love the power and the glory and the resurrection but what about the likeness of his sufferings hey man what about to be a reproach for the cause of the word what about going beyond the camp of our society of our culture of our our dares and going unto him what if you go yo if you become a reproach for the cause of the word that means people will speak bad about you you know the Bible says whoa Jesus said woe unto you if all men speak good of you yeah I just want to be a people pleaser you can't we can't please everyone you can either please people or please God I'll just please God because he's got a heaven to go to he's got real good benefits in his life eternal life policy hallelujah it's worth serving him Hallelujah for now Hallelujah so you see it so so this is the beginning of months so if the blood has been applied you become one with the word he says I'm gonna give you the former in the latter rain in the first month so that means it will start raining when you become one with the word you won't just be living off localized rains that was a good service but the rest of the week you're dry no you walk out of these doors it's raining you read the word there's a teaching comes and it quickens to you and then the and then the and then the latter rain quickens the word and makes it come to life in your life Hallelujah even just when you read the word and maybe you read in the scripture created me a clean heart oh Lord and renew a right Spirit Within Me it quickens to you and then you really pray that and God changes you oh look that's a quickening Hallelujah amen so it's raining all the time Hallelujah you say well I'm in a desert you know God's in the desert too yes many times we think yeah well he's only in with his Green Pastures no he's in the desert that's right because he says I'll never leave you nor forsake me now there are some Kings one day and they decided let's go fight I think it was Moab I might have the enemy wrong but they wouldn't afford an enemy and they went for seven days in the desert and they discovered we have no water and one of the Kings said God's brought us out here today now if you read the accountant sorry I don't have it on me Second Kings in there I'll put on the WhatsApp later if someone reminds me there's no consultation of God before they go on this campaign they just said let's go fight but because they because they believe they're the children of God they think well God just tells them to do everything now you've got to wait on the Lord right and if you start and and he will direct your footsteps so start walking in a direction and he'll guide your path don't just stand still and be well should I have breakfast today well yeah you should you know but just oh why well Lord I want to have this career start walking about walk softly and he'll guide you right that's how we should be don't fall asleep on me just now now and so what happens is so so they decided let's go fight this battle there seven days in the desert yeah yeah and he and and one of the king says the Lord's brought us out here to die no they brought themselves out there they they got themselves into a spot isn't it amazing we can get ourselves into some spots we ourselves can get us there and the sooner we realize actually it was my own GPS that said turn left instead of turning right and here I am it's good to realize Lord I got myself here can you please buy your grace get me out and then say when I got the prophet and he said make the valley full of ditches because in the morning they'll be full of water Hallelujah now the reason he could say that is because that smitten Rock that followed the children of Israel in the wilderness into the promised land he was there amen the Lord is there he's here right but then sometimes there's the sand desert experience they can be superstitions culture selfishness Pride you know arrogance indifference lukewarmness it's like desert sand where once the Rock of Ages is uncovered and the water's gushing but then all those things cover them up so they were told make the valley full of ditches so they had to dig for victory it wasn't just in World War one and two trench warfare with that dick for victory they had we have to dig for victories we have to get our hands muddy on the shovel of faith and start digging out if you've got order against a brother or sister dig it out check it out have you got some super if you got fear you're not gonna make it dig it out the Lord's out perfect lamb he died for you and I am en he's our sacrifice he's our Waymaker he's our light in the darkness he's your light in the darkness he's your Waymaker right take it out you know if you've got some legalistic idea dig it out even some liberal idea well God just Winks at my sin and he doesn't get no no hold on God cares we do not we are not in the same condition as we were in the Old Testament in the Old Testament they went and sacrificed they came back with the same sinful nature now people think well God just God just you know because Jesus died I don't need to give a sacrifice and he forgives me anyway and they just wait on in their sin that's not Christianity Christianity is the life of God comes into you and gives you overcoming power they're the things you once battle with you don't battle with because you get a victory over it that's right Hallelujah isn't that what it is because he's the Christian how man has failed to build religion to try and atone for their sins Christian religion different ways of doing things but they've got to come back to the blood and let that blood be applied to their lives and change them amen aren't you glad we can have that today praise the Lord you say well I'm struggling in an era just get more of the Lord you know there's this one phrase in the New Testament he says that he'll fill up their sins away I like that it's kind of an unusual expression but he's going to fill your sins up you know fill up your sins away now just say if this was um okay this is water just say this is oil right the oil of the Holy Ghost how do you really get all the water out of this bottle you fill it up no hopefully I probably got this around the wrong way but anyway what I'm saying is you you're full of sin right full of complexes troubles pains hurts anxiety depression it doesn't belong to you it's not your portion the devil says well this is yours you know maybe you inherit it from your family or whatever more but it doesn't belong to you right so you just fill it up fill yourself up with the Holy Ghost and it will put it'll push everything else out of your life just let him push it out Hallelujah praise the Lord he'll push it all out amen let him fill up all your sins away I like that hey dig out all these things amen but then eventually they hit the rock oh there's nothing like when you make contact with the rock I mean but don't just don't just get a little bit of them keep pushing all the dirt and sand out until you totally uncover all that he is hallelujah how long have some people been digging people dig their whole life and there's always more of God but he wants you to to know him so just keep digging out take the resentment trouble comes up in church that's actually sand just sliding back down upon the rock dig it out hey man troubles come up in family you know you come to you know complacency in life whatever it is just Dig It All Out apathy and all these things though we should have a vision [Music] it's so full of apathy well who cares you know you know brother man would say the curse of soft living yeah we can have it too good there's no drive for life there's no well the government will take care of me you know and thank God for those kind of things but don't just you know we should have ambition in life Amen to further ourselves and further the kingdom of God be more like him I mean have a vision for our family you know we should always look young people always look what kind of spouse do you want think of the character you want them to have not that they'll you know cook me good food and they'll do this for me or or give me lots of money to spend don't look at those things character yeah character is the thing you should be thinking about that amen what kind of character do you want them to have and don't just be vague get get specific about it think about it in your mind you know do you want them to be kind and gentle and loving and love the Lord with all their hearts and you have to be understanding try and step into your shoes and you know understand your burdens and your fears and your desires you're going to have that kind of spouse so it'll be with you thick and thin amen that's how it should be I think that's why it's so important when you look at when you're looking at someone look at how they treat their family because how they treat their families how they'll treat you true so I hope everyone is going to behave better after this amen but you but that's just how it is see you look at Suns and how they treat their mother daughters how they treat the father because that's how you know that's how they'll treat you amen there you see now he said there'll be there'll be rivers in the desert I'm gonna I'm gonna I'm gonna I'm gonna finish with this he says now by the way I'm say it's here we're not going to get to really want to want to get to no actually I will I'll just be real quick okay let's go into fifth gear now what's the matter with the church today the water supply is cut off because of grumbling and doubting yeah if you'll get it if you'll get into a desert you'll find that every Bush that you come up against will perhaps have thorns and stickers on it because it's raised in a dry land without water you take the same variety of bush and put it in a moisture a land of moisture that'll be soft because there's plenty of water and you take a church that's always fussing and stewing about this is days of Miracles has passed just remember they're in a desert and out of the water now to me when he says days of Miracles have passed he's not just saying about Divine Healing he's talking about the supernatural Touch Of God that can change your life because that is a miracle you you want to see the greatest Miracle upon the earth look at someone who's got the Holy Ghost that is greater than a cancer being healed greater than the limb being restored as a transformation of a soul as the greatest Miracle you'll ever see why because that Miracle will continue until the change of the body amen praise the Lord see thank you just remember they're in a desert and out of the water and a church that's loving and humble and flexible and feels and goes with the word of God remember they're living by the fountain that never runs dry amen so if we're at church is loving now we're going to make this personal if I'm loving and I'm humble and I'm flexible and feels so not just indifferent but actually has a feeling for one another and goes with the word of God what does that mean agree and live by remember they're living by the fountain that never runs dry amen so get until you when you hit the Rock of Ages keep digging around it and the Waters of play will never end I mean so he said there'll be rivers in the deserts it is it's raining praise the Lord now the latter rain is also a harvest rain and we're living in a Harvest Time now we understand by the by you know by Nature that the grain has to be in the head of the plant mature golden and then the Harvest comes the combine comes now we're living in an hour I'm just going to read this but you remember when it went down the grain began to ripen that you find before that grain can ripen everything that's in the stalk has to be dead Hallelujah can't you see where we're standing so the life in the former parts of the plant go into the going to the grain the life is in the grain again what is it just exactly like the same grain that went into the ground the same Jesus is in Bride form the same power the same church the same thing the same word the same word sucked up through these come out here and come to a head here and all that life that came through here picked up its people now it's forming up into a head for the Rapture Hallelujah so because some people say well the grain is here so we're just going to land the prince of the Sun and there's no manifestation anymore there's no there's no leaves blowing in the breeze there's no tassels there's not great Mission work going on you know but it's just it's just it's just grain laying in the presence of the Sun no that's true we are ripening in the presence of the Sun but if you look at the original grain that first walk the earth our Lord Jesus Christ there's more manifestation in his life amen just in those few few years that are recorded in the gospel there's more manifestation of God Amen in that than than to me the entire Old Testament why because that he was all revealed in part through the Old Testament now the fullness of him was there upon the Earth so there was more manifestation of Miracles of Deliverance amen right of being yo come now of of of healing of Deliverance demons being cast out the dead being raised but the original grain lived a totally surrendered sold-out life that's it all right man yeah it's not just Miracles that we have right right I'm saying these things because you've got to look at what are we aiming to become if I say we're arrived there's nothing more there's no more Revival let's just sit back and wait then that's what we will become but but that's not what the picture says the picture says we shall be like him amen will be made in His image so if he upon the Earth was one who cast out the devil healed the sick raise the dead discern the thoughts and Tents of the heart calm the storms Hallelujah if he did fulfilled the word for his age so we will do the same but as I've said in the past the greatest Miracle to me the Lord Jesus ever did was subject himself to the word of God above his feelings as I said before yo I've seen the past that that you read on Mount Transfiguration Moses and Elijah stood there in one account he said they told him what he had to accomplish at Jerusalem so they'll go through all the prophecy of the Old Testament you'll be wounded for our transgressions they're going to pierce your hands and your feet you'll be marred more than any other man you'll be done before your accusers you'll be a sheep like led to the slaughter you'll be hung between two male factors you know you're gonna be buried all those things the sin of the world is going to be upon you all those things your your Soul's gonna be an offering for sin they preached to him the word concerning himself now he had to be our sin offering he had to go as a man no I know from my own experience when the burden of sin in your own life becomes apparent it's a big weight when you realize your own vile state that you need to be washed in the blood of the Lord Jesus Christ you need to be delivered from this burden just like Pilgrim's Progress how how John Bunyan and Spidey yeah he said there's a big burden on the on on on Christian's back and but when he went to Calvary that burden fell off now can you imagine the burden of just one is great what about a burden of the whole history of humanity that great burden of sin amen and then he'll come to a place when he's hang on Calvary cry out my God my God was thou forsaken me so he died as a forsaken sinner in your place no the greatest Miracle to me is when he was in Gethsemane and and heaven was waiting for an answer will he do it or will he not being a man he didn't want to die no one in their right mind likes pain right no one in their right mind but here's gonna be mad more than any man but yet he was so surrendered now this is the first grain and and his response was father if you're willing take this cup from me but nevertheless not my will but thy will be done and he subjected his own body to the word that he had to fulfill and it wasn't glamorous it wasn't glorious it wasn't this big manifestation of power as we would think but he died mad more than the other man beaten Riven between two male factors of a broken heart rejected by his own people he's our example if he could subject himself to the word of God he said well it's my right to dress how one do what I want say what I want watch what I want yeah as a as a human being but when you become a Christian you fulfill you forfeit all of your rights and above how you feel and you fulfit them to God and let the word of God have preeminence amen amen amen that he came to a place where he'd say I only do that which pleases the father amen now we want to see God move at camp we need to be surrendered vessels for him Amy we can't come just haphazardly and arrogantly and well he's done it before he'll do it again no we should always cherish every move of God that we experience we should be appreciative every time his Spirit comes down and touches us and he speaks to our hearts and he deals with us we should never take those moments for granted right God would speak to a prophet one time in the Old Testament it was a great big massive thing how many times did he come service after service time after time you read the word you listen to the message that God speaks directly to you it's like he's sitting there in the chair opposite you and he's having a conversation it's wanting to get your attention we should cherish those things it's like the angel of God speaking to Gideon and the threshing floor or or the angel of God speaking to Samson's parents or the same as God speaking out the burning bush to Moses that's incredible things we should cherish those moments and never take them for granted you know if we really have the Revelation that we are the bride of Christ we'll be the most humble surrendered thankful people in all the world it won't make us a stuffed shirt well I'm going on the Rapture these people no we will never have that near our minds right so in conclusion it's raining if you're in a desert he'll make rivers in the desert yeah for you he'll do a new thing but let him rebuild you'll let him yeah yeah lay yourself on his altar yeah and Let the Fire Fall yes let him do it well I'm afraid it's amazing before God you know you always try and run from God I did for years but then after you meet him you say man I wasted all that time you know you think man if only I met him earlier he called me earlier one and I know him earlier but you know and the devil always wants to paint a picture there's nothing to it you know you know you'll lose all this and it's not worth it it's more than worth friends whatever more no walk with God let's have the musicians this morning but friends let's be real sincere when we approach this campus say Lord may we be sensitive to your spirit and may you do what you want to do amen amen amen he'll make rivers in the desert he'll do a new thing praise the Lord Hallelujah I mean Christy and I were talking about that the other day I
