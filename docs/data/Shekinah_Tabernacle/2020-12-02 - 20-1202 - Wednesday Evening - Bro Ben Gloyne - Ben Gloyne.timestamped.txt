[22:42] small thought before we go on prayer
[22:44] together um if you want to if you got
[22:46] your Bibles handy let's go to John
[22:49] 16 and we're going to read one uh
[22:52] portion of scripture from from John 16
[22:54] I'm going to read from verse 7
[22:58] I mean I trust everyone's had a good
[23:00] week so
[23:07] far amen this is Jesus speaking to his
[23:10] disciples and he he says this here he
[23:13] says nevertheless I tell you the truth
[23:16] it is expedient for you that I go away
[23:19] if I go not away the comforter will not
[23:21] come unto you but if I depart I will
[23:23] send him unto you and when he has come
[23:26] he will reprove the world of sin and of
[23:28] righteousness and of Judgment of sin
[23:30] because they believe not on me of
[23:33] righteousness because I go to my father
[23:35] and you see me no more of judgment
[23:38] because the prince of this world is
[23:39] judged I have yet many things to say
[23:42] unto you but you cannot bear them now
[23:44] how be it when he the spirit of Truth
[23:46] has come he will guide you into all
[23:48] Truth for he shall not see speak of
[23:51] himself but whatsoever he shall hear
[23:54] that shall he speak and he will show you
[23:57] things to come he shall glorify me for
[24:00] he shall receive of mine and shall show
[24:03] it unto you amen so let's just bow heads
[24:06] in a word of prayer tonight Lord Jesus

[24:20] week and let the pressure off in your

[25:14] you bless each one here dear God we just
[25:16] want to give the service over to you now
[25:18] in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ
[25:20] amen amen God bless you friends you may
[25:22] you may have your seats um tonight so I
[25:25] want to speak about where um I've been
[25:27] listening um a bit this week to to the
[25:30] message brother Baron preached which uh
[25:32] called a guide I've really been enjoying
[25:34] it and so I want to I want to speak
[25:36] about um um I just want to speak about a
[25:40] guide because when we read we you we
[25:42] read here in in in John that you know
[25:45] the Lord is saying that you know if he
[25:46] if he goes away he's going to send the
[25:49] spirit of Truth and that Spirit of Truth
[25:51] which is we know him in a different form
[25:52] as the Holy Ghost it's going to come
[25:54] it's going to show you things that are
[25:56] going to come in the future but it's
[25:57] going to lead you and guide you into all
[25:59] truth so there's going to be a you know
[26:01] when the Lord comes to us personally
[26:03] he's going to lead us and guide us into
[26:05] all truth there's actually going to be a
[26:06] guide that's going to come into our life
[26:08] that's going to guide us into certain
[26:09] things now we know that uh we everyone
[26:12] is Guided by something we are we are not
[26:15] our own guide but everyone needs a guide
[26:18] and everyone has a guide whether we are
[26:20] conscious of it or not there is a spirit
[26:22] leading us somewhere and and where that
[26:24] spirit is leading us is really what the
[26:26] life in US is manifesting right now yeah
[26:28] so that that Spirit can be of the world
[26:31] and it will manifest the world it can be
[26:33] a religious spirit it will just manifest
[26:34] religion or it will be the spirit of our
[26:37] Lord Jesus Christ which will manifest
[26:39] his word in our lives now we need to be
[26:41] very careful that we know who's who's
[26:45] who's guiding us yes and um you know
[26:48] brother Braham he says that a guide um
[26:51] he says that you know we are being
[26:53] Guided by something he says he says here
[26:55] Moses was hurting his father-in-law's
[26:57] sheep jethra on the back side of the
[26:59] desert and one day an angel appeared to
[27:01] him in a burning bush now an angel came
[27:03] down to bring the message to Moses and
[27:05] otherwise and otherwise was to be his
[27:08] guide now men see we can't guide
[27:10] yourself there's two ways that's your
[27:12] way and God's way and when you're in
[27:15] your way you're out of God's way and and
[27:17] you have to forget your own way to find
[27:19] God's way a man cannot lead himself so
[27:23] it's very important that we that that
[27:26] the god of Our Lives is the Lord Jesus
[27:27] Christ amen now our guide is a very
[27:30] important uh person to have along with
[27:32] us you know if we are going into into uh
[27:36] uncertain territory we need someone to
[27:39] go with us you know that that knows the
[27:41] way now Joshua if we if we just turn
[27:44] there quickly as well we can go to
[27:46] Joshua um chapter chapter 3 and and
[27:50] Joshua makes an astounding statement
[27:52] here and uh when when they're about to
[27:54] cross over the river Jordan they're
[27:55] about to uh go into the Promised Land
[27:58] and he gives instruction to the people
[28:00] of Israel to follow the
[28:02] ark um and and he makes a statement
[28:05] Joshua 3 and verses 3 and 4 he says yet
[28:09] there shall be a space between you and
[28:11] it so so you and the Ark about 2,000
[28:13] cubits by measure come not near unto it
[28:16] that ye may know the way by which you
[28:19] must go for ye have not passed this way
[28:22] here to for so so Joshua is telling the
[28:26] people keep a bit of a distance you can
[28:27] see where it is and you've got to follow
[28:30] it because now you're going into a You'
[28:32] never been this way you know they had
[28:34] been around Mount horb or in the desert
[28:35] for 40 years they knew what it was like
[28:37] to go around in circles but now they're
[28:38] going to go take the land and so the
[28:41] guide which is the word was going to
[28:42] take them places they never been before
[28:44] now I'll say this that Humanity hasn't
[28:47] been this way that we're living right
[28:49] now in terms of you know even the
[28:51] prophet when he when when he said I
[28:53] predict I do not prophesy that you know
[28:55] it'll end up finished in 1977 it ought
[28:58] to usher in the Millennium you know
[29:00] there'll be a termination of the world
[29:01] systems and it will ought to ought to um
[29:03] Usher in the Millennium you know we know
[29:05] that the World Systems church is a world
[29:06] system brother Braham says those things
[29:08] have come to an end and we know ushering
[29:10] is a period of time who's ever been
[29:12] ushered into a seat in a restaurant you
[29:14] come to the front door someone com says
[29:15] I'm going to take you to your seat
[29:16] there's a period of time between where
[29:18] you're standing by the front door and
[29:19] sitting in your seat so now we're in a
[29:21] time where the Millennium is being
[29:23] ushered in right right so so this is the
[29:26] world has never had a millennium I mean
[29:28] Adam and Eve you know we know in the
[29:30] garden sure but you know they didn't
[29:31] live out a thousand years but now
[29:33] humanity is about to step back into it
[29:35] so man has never lived in this kind of
[29:38] period of time true so we've never been
[29:40] this way before right right we've never
[29:42] lived in this kind of darkness before so
[29:44] we've got to have a guide through the
[29:46] darkness amen who's ever been lost
[29:49] before in a you know in the bush
[29:52] somewhere it it gets
[29:55] very it gets very
[29:58] you know you start to get a bit worried
[29:59] when you when you lose your bearings and
[30:02] you don't know which way is out you get
[30:04] it troubles you and then and then if
[30:06] you're not careful you start to do some
[30:09] crazy stuff because you realize you've
[30:11] lost you know you lost brother Bram
[30:13] would say in the message of guide you
[30:14] know have you ever seen a man that was
[30:16] lost did anyone ever have the experience
[30:19] of bringing in a man lost he says it's
[30:21] the most pitiful thing you ever seen
[30:23] when a man gets lost he goes wild he
[30:26] doesn't know what he's doing caught a
[30:28] man out there a boy and he had been lost
[30:30] in the woods and he thought he was a
[30:32] Rancher but he was in the wrong
[30:34] territory and he got lost so being a
[30:36] Rancher he thought he was a man of the
[30:38] outdoors but he was in a different so
[30:40] he's in a wrong territory so he was in a
[30:42] place that he' never been before and he
[30:43] got lost and he and and and turned
[30:47] around and when they found him 3 days
[30:48] later he was running like a wild man
[30:51] screaming at the top of his voice his
[30:53] lips was all eat up he throwed his gun
[30:55] away he didn't know what to do and when
[30:57] his own brother when they had to catch
[30:59] him and tie him when his own brother
[31:01] came to him he fed him like an animal
[31:03] tried to bite him he didn't know where
[31:05] he was at why he was lost and when a
[31:07] man's lost he he's in a state of
[31:11] bewildered now now he's talking about a
[31:13] natural loss what about a spiritual loss
[31:15] you know someone who doesn't know where
[31:17] they've come from where they're going
[31:19] where their life is going they they act
[31:21] like a wild man they don't know who they
[31:23] are don't know where they're going don't
[31:25] know you know anything they just start
[31:26] to act crazy like an animal and he
[31:28] didn't know and he didn't know that he's
[31:30] in that state he didn't realize he was
[31:32] acting like that that way because his
[31:35] being L sends this fever upon him and he
[31:38] don't know where he's at and how's he
[31:41] and and and how he's acting and so it is
[31:44] when a man's lost from God he'll do
[31:46] things that or he ordinary wouldn't do
[31:48] he'll do things that's beyond the
[31:50] thoughts of a human being a lost man
[31:52] from God a lost Church from God a church
[31:55] that's got away from God got away from
[31:57] the principles of God's Bible will do
[31:59] things that sometimes you wouldn't
[32:01] expect to find in a Church of the Living
[32:02] God they'll get their money by Bunko
[32:05] games playing Lottery gambling anything
[32:06] that they can do they'll teach anything
[32:08] they'll let anything get by Pat men on
[32:10] the back who big payers in the church
[32:13] and so forth like that to let them get
[32:15] and and and let them get by with it
[32:17] that's right put deacons on the board
[32:19] that's been married four or five times
[32:20] just in order to get by with it to make
[32:23] ends meet there's only one end that
[32:25] you've got to meet that's your oblig to
[32:28] God stand and tell the truth lost lost
[32:30] men in a bewildered State he's a
[32:33] Madman so we don't ever want to get in
[32:35] that kind of state we want to have a
[32:37] guide now in order to you know if I'm
[32:40] going to go out into the bush I'm not
[32:42] going to take just an amateur weekend
[32:44] guide I'm going to take a professional I
[32:47] want to take the best guide I could find
[32:48] cuz I don't want to get lost I don't
[32:49] want to get killed I don't to get stuck
[32:51] out there with no food no bearings No
[32:54] you know you know no shelter nothing I
[32:56] want the very best amen because we need
[32:58] the right kind of guide now now keep the
[33:01] holy spirit in mind when I when I give
[33:03] this list so a guide must know where
[33:06] he's going right a guide must know where
[33:09] he's going just like Joshua said you
[33:10] know we've been round the mountain
[33:11] basically 40 years now we're going to a
[33:13] place you've never been before follow
[33:15] the word so we don't want to be stuck in
[33:17] just going round in circles we have
[33:19] Easter then we have Easter again we just
[33:21] go around Church camp camp camp and you
[33:24] know just going around in circles one
[33:26] you know one year to the next in the
[33:27] same way no we need a holy spirit
[33:30] guide the holy spirit guide so so he
[33:33] must know where he's going and the Lord
[33:35] knows exactly where he's going amen and
[33:37] then but then also a guide he must know
[33:39] where he's going but he must know how to
[33:41] get there right there's no point in
[33:44] having an end destination of mind when
[33:45] you don't know how to get there the Lord
[33:47] knows how to get us there amen amen the
[33:51] Lord yes sir a guide must know the
[33:53] terrain that they're going to travel
[33:54] over he must know the terrain what good
[33:57] is a GU who knows the flat Flats but
[33:59] we're going up into the hills he'll get
[34:02] lost he needs to know the hills if we're
[34:03] going into the Hills right so a guide
[34:05] must know the terrain now our lord Jesus
[34:08] knows the terrain he knows the age we
[34:10] live in he knows the type of society
[34:12] we're in he knows the world economics he
[34:14] knows the state of religion he knows the
[34:15] state of man he knows the state of what
[34:17] the devil's doing he knows the terrain
[34:19] amen amen amen a guide must know the
[34:23] weather patterns especially in this kind
[34:26] of country you can be here at Sunny go
[34:27] up the hills next minute you know wind
[34:30] comes through there's a blizzard
[34:31] whatever more you know you've got to
[34:33] know the weather patterns if you can't
[34:35] read the weather you I'm not talking
[34:37] about oh we know what me surfice is
[34:39] doing but if you can't read the weather
[34:40] in the sky how are you going to predict
[34:43] okay now it's going to start raining we
[34:45] better get down to safety or this is
[34:46] going to happen the wind's going to
[34:47] change you know our Lord knows the
[34:50] weather patterns real well you know
[34:52] there the cold breeze trying to blow
[34:53] through the church formalism trying to
[34:55] blow through the kind of protective you
[34:57] got to put on to to to withstand those
[35:00] kind of winds Hallelujah you know he
[35:02] knows the way you're the kind of head
[35:04] gear you got to wear you know all those
[35:06] you know protect from the acid of gossip
[35:08] and you know you know cold Winds of
[35:10] formalism and you know he knows he knows
[35:13] and he and he say and a guide must know
[35:16] the potential dangers that are out there
[35:18] see what good now if I take a guide who
[35:20] knows the bush here and take them into
[35:24] Africa we'll be we'll be Lion's lunch
[35:27] Hallelujah you know because he's never
[35:30] he's never had experience with those
[35:31] kind of animals right you got to have
[35:33] the right kind of guide for the right
[35:35] kind of place amen but our lord Jesus
[35:37] he's had experience with the devil he
[35:39] knows his tricks he knows his tactics he
[35:41] knows you know how he tries to catch
[35:43] praying different things amen so you got
[35:45] to have the right kind of guide that's
[35:47] right amen that knows the potential
[35:49] dangers that's why but you got to know
[35:51] those things but in but but in order to
[35:54] you can have the most perfect guide that
[35:56] there's ever been
[35:58] but if you do not have confidence in
[36:00] that guide if you don't listen to that
[36:02] guide if you don't pay attention to that
[36:04] guide then it's not going to do you any
[36:06] good you've got to you've got to you've
[36:08] got to have trust and confidence in your
[36:11] guide and you've got to have confidence
[36:13] remember it's not when the weather's
[36:15] fine and everything's just just going
[36:17] fine out in the bush that you need to
[36:18] listen to your guide It's really you
[36:20] know it's when it's when a crisis
[36:22] strikes that's really when a person's
[36:24] character comes out right so when crisis
[36:27] strikes the church you see the character
[36:28] of God expressed I mean when you see
[36:31] hardship come in and he counters that
[36:32] hardship he brings forth you know his
[36:34] word to to to bring a stability and
[36:36] bring a healing and you know that's when
[36:38] see but if a guide doesn't know how to
[36:41] handle danger like I said if we went to
[36:43] took a kiwi guide to to Africa and a and
[36:46] an elephant comes charging through the
[36:48] bush he just panick he has never
[36:50] experienced it how can you know but but
[36:54] if he had experience with those kind of
[36:56] crisis we could have confidence in him
[37:00] yes sir so we've got to you know you
[37:02] have to have confidence in your guide
[37:04] now we can read through the scripture we
[37:06] can have a testimony service for a good
[37:07] few months just even right here to hear
[37:10] about what our guide has done amen
[37:13] chrisis has struck this is what he did
[37:15] this happened this is what he did I
[37:16] needed help here this is what he did
[37:19] Hallelujah those who stuck close to the
[37:21] guide they can say this is what his
[37:24] character that comes out Amen in time of
[37:27] trouble you're right Hallelujah if we
[37:30] have confidence in our guide if you have
[37:32] confidence in your guide you know when a
[37:34] storm strike something unexpected
[37:36] happens you know he's going to look
[37:37] after you I mean you fall over and Brak
[37:39] your leg in the middle of the Bush he's
[37:41] not going to panic and you're not going
[37:43] to panic cuz he's not panicking you ever
[37:45] seen your children you know they can
[37:47] hurt themselves and you know if the
[37:48] parents kind of grab them if they look
[37:50] really worried then then then the
[37:51] children start crying but if you don't
[37:53] act that way they don't cry why cuz
[37:55] they're actually looking up they know
[37:57] something happen they can feel the pain
[37:58] they're looking up at mommy or daddy and
[38:00] they and and they're trying to gauge how
[38:02] they're looking at them to see the
[38:04] severity of the of the accident true
[38:07] that's right amen we have an accident we
[38:10] we look up at the Lord and he's not
[38:12] panicking we can go it's not so bad
[38:14] after all you know he's got it in
[38:18] control amen so we got to have
[38:21] confidence in our
[38:22] guide Hallelujah now those who follow a
[38:26] guide over time they begin to act like
[38:29] their guide they begin to think like
[38:32] their guide and they begin to behave
[38:34] like their guide right those who have
[38:36] the right kind of guide now really the
[38:38] life that is manifesting in us right now
[38:40] shows what what's guiding us right now
[38:44] so if the Holy Ghost is guiding us we'll
[38:47] begin to act like the Holy Ghost we will
[38:50] think like the Holy Ghost which is the
[38:52] word we will talk like the word we'll
[38:54] act like the word and then when the
[38:55] enemy comes in we'll respond like the
[38:57] word responds right because the word is
[39:00] our guid amen amen if if religion is our
[39:04] guide well we can see what the Pharisees
[39:07] did and the scribes did whenever the
[39:08] word manifested himself in their
[39:10] presence and that's the response you'll
[39:14] see so you got to think about now what
[39:18] because we all we all start acting like
[39:20] our
[39:22] guide if the world is our guide we'll
[39:25] act like the world think like the world
[39:26] talk like the world dress like the world
[39:28] behave like the world if that's our
[39:31] guide but I have no confidence in that
[39:34] kind of guide he gets you into trouble
[39:36] then he just just does a runner leaves
[39:38] you to face the
[39:40] lion but if we have the Lord Jesus as
[39:43] our guide will end up acting like him in
[39:47] every
[39:48] situation Hallelujah but you got to be
[39:51] surrended remember man man can't be his
[39:53] own guide it's either you being the
[39:55] guide or God being the guide we read
[39:58] that quote before so we have to be
[40:00] yielded to a
[40:03] guide it all depends now now the problem
[40:06] is we have a lot of reasoning going on
[40:07] in our
[40:08] minds man can justify himself really
[40:11] well you know I wish I had a picture of
[40:13] it but it was on the news there was this
[40:15] guy I don't know how ended up there but
[40:17] there was a guy he was 100 odd miles off
[40:19] the coast of America and he was hanging
[40:22] on to the end of his camam which was
[40:25] sinking and he was there for a couple of
[40:27] days and he got rescued by a um a
[40:29] container ship and there's a photo
[40:32] there's only this much he's he's
[40:33] literally just say if if if from the
[40:36] floor to the ceiling was the amount of
[40:38] boat that was sticking out of the water
[40:39] was like this he's hanging on to the end
[40:41] of it and then there's a picture of him
[40:46] climbing up the stairs coming onto the
[40:47] containership that rescued him wow and
[40:50] he looks real happy that he's alive cuz
[40:54] he's in the middle of the Pacific
[40:56] hundreds of miles from anywhere and his
[40:59] boat sinking and it's been sinking for
[41:01] two days wow now I don't know what
[41:04] guided him out there but he found
[41:07] himself in a real sticky situation that
[41:10] unless unless help comes he's going to
[41:13] die he can't swim somewhere he can't
[41:15] call someone somehow they maybe had a
[41:17] locat beacon I don't know but you know
[41:20] it was either if that ship didn't get to
[41:22] him in time he was going to
[41:24] drown now you say well why do you say
[41:27] that I don't know what guided him out
[41:29] there but he called help and help got
[41:32] him amen and that's the thing with our
[41:35] guide he's a present help in time of
[41:38] trouble Hallelujah he's a present help
[41:41] in time of trouble but you've got to
[41:42] have confidence you may be in a very
[41:44] dark spot you going to have confidence
[41:46] help is on its way Hallelujah Jesus is
[41:50] coming amen the guide is coming
[41:53] Hallelujah it took him 4 days to get to
[41:55] lazarus's tomb but he got the grave but
[41:58] he got there and Lazarus came out
[42:01] Hallelujah Jesus may you know he's
[42:03] always on time but now I just want to
[42:05] stick this just I mean we just got to
[42:07] close with this we're got to stay behind
[42:08] this word we've never been this way
[42:10] before amen this could be the last well
[42:13] you probably say this every year this
[42:14] could be the last year we're on the
[42:16] earth the world has you know if we could
[42:19] maybe we'll you know no one ever
[42:21] predicted 2020 would be like
[42:24] this but here we are you say well we're
[42:27] Co free the the world is not Co free
[42:30] we're stuck on this island here we are
[42:33] you know no one would have predicted
[42:35] this but this is where we are but we got
[42:37] to have confidence our
[42:40] guide has told us there would be
[42:42] pestilence in the end time right our
[42:44] guide said there'll be mental pressure
[42:46] and depression and and and how the back
[42:49] in the 60s our guide told us that mental
[42:52] illness will be R in the end time amen
[42:55] right and depression and people on
[42:56] prescription drugs trying to stay level
[42:58] and things it's all in the church age
[43:00] book it's all in the message right men's
[43:02] Hearts failing for
[43:04] fear our guide has laid out where we are
[43:07] that's right right we're not just
[43:09] actually stumbling along in darkness
[43:11] people think well you know the message
[43:14] couldn't see into 2020 It's s into 2020
[43:18] it's more up to date in 2020 than it was
[43:20] in 1965 amen yes sir Hallelujah but you
[43:23] got to look and you got to talk to the
[43:24] guide you got to look at the guide say
[43:26] guide where are come on what's Happening
[43:28] Here I said I'll show you what you see
[43:31] around you I'll show you I've already
[43:32] laid it in the word you just got to look
[43:34] at what the guide says am Hallelujah
[43:37] that's true so that's why we've got to
[43:39] stay behind the word amen like Joshua
[43:41] told them you have not been this way
[43:43] before we haven't been on this is a
[43:45] unique Journey he's telling them and
[43:47] this is a unique Journey that we're on
[43:50] why is it unique cuz they which are
[43:51] alive and
[43:53] remain Hallelujah are going to be with
[43:55] the resurrected Saints going to meet the
[43:57] Lord in the air there's never been a
[43:59] generation on the earth that are the
[44:00] alive and
[44:01] remain right everyone everyone in the
[44:04] past thought they were the alive and
[44:05] remain but we are I'm alive and remain
[44:08] amen those who remain in the truth and
[44:10] alive in Christ we know those who died
[44:12] in Christ they'll come forth first but
[44:14] they all died with that promise but
[44:16] there's going to be people that are
[44:18] alive and remain amen so we're going to
[44:20] stay with this word friends it'll see us
[44:23] through but when Christ strikes what
[44:26] guide do you lean to
