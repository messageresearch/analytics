[7:04] feeling feeling good not feeling too
[7:05] tired didn't stay up too late no it's
[7:08] always nice when we have these like 21st
[7:10] or big events CU then on the Sunday
[7:12] morning after that there's always a lot
[7:13] of people at
[7:14] church and we always have a great time
[7:16] you know there the Lord where one or two
[7:19] are gathered together in his name there
[7:21] he is in the midst but if you have three
[7:24] pieces of wood on a fire you get quite a
[7:26] small fire if you have about 50 pieces
[7:27] of wood on there you get a raging
[7:28] Inferno know and and that's and the
[7:31] spiritual works the same when when
[7:33] Brethren come with their lick of fire it
[7:35] actually adds to the atmosphere and that
[7:37] there's a really powerful um atmosphere
[7:39] of the Holy Ghost so that's what we are
[7:42] already in this morning I'm going to say
[7:44] that that we that you know I think the
[7:46] Lord is always looking forward to
[7:47] meeting he doesn't sort of stand back
[7:49] and go oh well let's let's Let It Go on
[7:51] a bit for a bit then we'll go he
[7:52] actually wants to meet with us people
[7:53] his whole all of his effort all of his
[7:57] effort was just so he could come and
[7:58] meet with us
[8:00] the the whole word of God I sometimes it
[8:02] it it blows me away where I think that
[8:05] the the complexity of the Plan of
[8:07] Salvation and how the whole thing has
[8:08] worked out creation and and everything
[8:11] and and God slowly revealing himself and
[8:13] then coming down revealing saying
[8:15] there's going to be a lamb and he comes
[8:16] as the lamb and redeems and all of that
[8:19] the whole purpose was so that we could
[8:20] say Hello Lord I'm here let's can can we
[8:24] fellowship and he says yes I'm here
[8:26] let's Fellowship that's it that's the
[8:28] whole
[8:30] and and we're in that moment right here
[8:32] where we can meet the Living God the the
[8:33] whole purpose of all of his effort is
[8:35] here so let's we're going to have such a
[8:37] good time in the Lord let's sing um This

[20:14] you about a man who lived long ago now
[20:17] he was a leper and he needed a healing
[20:20] but he didn't know where to go so the
[20:23] prophet told non to go to Chile Jordan
[20:26] and their old non with
[20:29] that after seven times into the Muddy
[20:31] Water God delivered right on time God
[20:35] was in time for the children of Israel
[20:38] to cross the mighty Red Sea he was on
[20:42] time when the walls of Jero fell at
[20:45] Joshua's feet every time I feel
[20:49] discouraged don't have to wonder where
[20:51] he'll be God's been in time on time
[20:55] every time for me
[20:59] that's
[21:01] [Music]
[21:07] right now this the little David with the
[21:10] thinging in his hand but before the
[21:12] giant so tall and it was unlikely then
[21:15] to all those men surely Goliath would
[21:19] fall and when the three Hebrew Bo put
[21:22] him bow on to Bale the king said they
[21:24] crossed the line when they were thrown
[21:26] into the flame but then the fourth man
[21:28] came in and delivered right on time was
[21:32] in for the children of Israel to cross
[21:36] the mighty Red Sea he was on time when
[21:40] the walls of Jero fell at Joshua's feet
[21:44] every time I feel discouraged don't have

[41:14] Jude praise the
[41:16] Lord let's read verse
[41:19] one
[41:25] amen
[41:27] the Bible says Jude the servant of Jesus
[41:29] Christ and of brother and brother of
[41:33] James to them that are Sanctified by God
[41:36] the father and preserved in Jesus Christ
[41:39] and called wow what a salutation amen

[41:59] which was once delivered unto the Saints
[42:02] amen praise the Lord amen we want to
[42:03] exalt you this morning amen and then 1
[42:07] Corinthians chapter
[42:11] 9 amen 1 Corinthians chapter
[42:16] 9 amen verse
[42:21] 24 Paul says know he not that they which
[42:24] run in a race run all but one receiveth
[42:28] a prize so run that he may obtain and
[42:32] every man that striveth for the Mastery
[42:34] is temperate in all things now they do
[42:36] it to obtain a corruptible Crown but we
[42:39] an
[42:40] Incorruptible listen to Paul you now I
[42:42] therefore so run not as
[42:45] uncertainly so fight I not as one that
[42:49] Beth in the air amen but I keep under my
[42:52] body and bring it and bring it bring it
[42:55] into subjection
[42:56] lest that by any means when I preach to
[42:59] others I myself should be a Cast Away
[43:01] amen may the Lord bless the reading of
[43:02] his word you may be seated in his
[43:04] presence amen praise the Lord I I want
[43:08] to greet you all this morning in the
[43:10] precious name of Jesus Christ and amen
[43:13] special greeting to brother Ben and
[43:15] Sister Christine God bless you amen
[43:18] actually I should say Pastor Ben amen so
[43:21] greetings Pastor Benjamin amen and
[43:24] Sister Christine and uh all the
[43:26] Believers this morning and uh and the
[43:29] only reason I'm preaching and my
[43:31] father's not preaching because he wasn't
[43:34] going to come right and so when brother
[43:36] Ben asked me and I said yes then
[43:38] afterwards I heard he's coming
[43:40] also so I don't know if they planned it
[43:43] that way and I always said I am I'm a
[43:46] great support for my my dad and when you
[43:50] ask him favors he says no so I said why
[43:53] don't you preach and he just said no
[43:55] brother and just straight out no so amen
[43:58] and that's I thought i' just let you
[43:59] know that's the only reason I'm
[44:00] preaching and not him amen and I think
[44:03] you didn't plan it like that he you're a
[44:06] very upright man
[44:09] right amen amen and uh you know one
[44:12] minute they weren going and the next
[44:14] minute I heard they coming and so Dad
[44:15] says that brother poor you called him
[44:18] twice and he said he couldn't say no
[44:20] amen so I I don't know I don't know but
[44:22] praise the Lord so that's why I'm here
[44:24] this morning amen but we trust we just
[44:26] want to be a blessing and um and the
[44:30] reason I've got I just let you know the
[44:31] reason I've got this thing I am I don't
[44:34] like I I deal with technology on a daily
[44:37] basis right but I'm of the old school
[44:40] and I come to the pulpit I don't like
[44:41] technology I've got to use this amen
[44:44] they're trying to convince me to use
[44:45] that thing and this thing and I can't
[44:48] use that amen
[44:50] I amen they say you can't teach a old
[44:52] dog new tricks amen so uh praise the
[44:56] Lord I I use this amen and uh and the
[44:58] only reason I got this is because I
[45:01] found out you know you come to I don't I
[45:04] didn't have a printer to print the quote
[45:07] so I had to put it on here amen and then
[45:09] Dad said yesterday I've got to you know
[45:11] come up to the play and you know preach
[45:14] on an iPad and uh I I I can't do I still
[45:19] write my stuff out right I still I'm
[45:22] Antiquated I tell you amen but uh God
[45:24] bless you this morning greetings in
[45:26] jesus' name it's really good to Amen to

[45:38] of it amen and then uh to be here this
[45:42] morning amen I'm grateful for that amen
[45:45] and uh I was just thinking this morning
[45:46] it's I think it was um and uh I'm I'm
[45:50] going to say this and I'm going to get
[45:52] it also but I I think it was L and
[45:54] tazwell that was instrumental in
[45:56] introducing us I think it was e am I
[45:59] right or was it you I don't know who it
[46:01] was but uh I I'll get a text message
[46:04] from Taz I'm sure I'll get a text
[46:06] message but I they were in
[46:08] instrumentally introducing us amen and
[46:10] um and I always yeah so and I'm glad
[46:13] they did amen and so it's good to have

[46:28] and the officers and all the Believers
[46:31] God bless you this morning amen
[46:33] greetings amen and uh you know I'm just
[46:35] trying to settle down right you know
[46:38] that right you know that all right and
[46:40] um I just wanted to say that you know uh
[46:44] I I don't I don't really care about
[46:45] people's opinions but I should he I
[46:47] should I really
[46:48] should when no when people have an
[46:50] opinion of me I don't really care right
[46:52] if it's negative or good whatever and
[46:54] but I thought I just wanted to say uh I
[46:56] hope nobody was offended when they ended
[46:58] up calling me Bishop right and I just
[47:01] wanted I just wanted to say it's not an
[47:04] office it's a term of
[47:07] endearment all right I thought I wanted
[47:08] to say that you know it's a so brother
[47:12] brother and PO is from Africa and males
[47:14] find it hard to say I love you or to say
[47:18] brother you're awesome or brother you're
[47:20] great so they give you this little
[47:23] this this title of that doesn't mean
[47:25] anything really so it's just brother PA
[47:28] and brother brother Ben said it
[47:29] yesterday and Andy said it was just
[47:31] their terms of endearment you know just
[47:34] saying how much they they like me amen
[47:37] so I just thought I'd say that all right
[47:39] so
[47:41] please amen don't don't go tell
[47:44] everybody brother F's got a title eh
[47:47] don't please don't please don't right
[47:49] it's a term of endearment and then I
[47:52] discovered I looked into it and
[47:53] apparently you know they they they they
[47:55] the term Bishop is synonymous with an
[47:57] elder and overseer and then I was you
[48:01] know I was thinking brother Paul laying
[48:03] in bed I think are they trying to tell
[48:05] me that I'm older than them and they so
[48:08] yeah so I thought I'd just let you know
[48:09] okay okay I'm not any of that I'm I it's
[48:13] just the term he so when he says it he's
[48:15] just trying to say brother fedy I I love
[48:17] you okay so so pray that he can say
[48:20] those words brother fedy I love you okay
[48:23] so praise the Lord amen but really

[50:48] it's a it's a visit you know and because

[50:53] think it's a time where we we we we we
[50:55] we've got the Holy Ghost discernment
[50:57] right and it's not just the pastor's job
[50:59] to do that no and it's not just the
[51:02] prince of deacons job to do that you
[51:04] know it's our responsibility you know
[51:07] and and some and we need that because I
[51:10] know we in a battle and I know like Jude
[51:13] said we contending I'm not here to tell
[51:16] you to contend I know you're contending
[51:20] I know you're in the battle I know
[51:22] you're fighting I know the battle gets
[51:25] hard
[51:25] and it's okay now and then to you know
[51:28] feel a bit like oh man I'm a little bit
[51:30] punch drunk here you know and I'm a
[51:32] little bit I need a I I need some I need
[51:34] some support or I you know or I need the
[51:37] my corner to give me a little drink of
[51:39] water you know and I thank God for a
[51:41] good
[51:42] corner you know you know you got a good
[51:45] corner you know where you're in the ring
[51:47] and the the devil gives you a left and
[51:49] the right and you I I love how the how
[51:52] the the referee asks the the fighter
[51:55] what what day is it have you you seen
[51:57] that what day is it you know and
[52:00] sometimes you don't know what day it is
[52:02] and uh you know but then they get they
[52:04] got a little stool and they sit you down
[52:05] and they you know they fan the towel not
[52:07] sure what that does and a little drink
[52:09] of water and it's good to have a good
[52:11] ring
[52:12] corner and I thank God Amen back home
[52:14] we've got a good corner and really
[52:17] that's all I do at church I'm just there
[52:19] to support the pastor amen I'm in the
[52:22] corner and when he comes on a Sunday and
[52:24] he's punching drunk a little bit and
[52:26] he's fought a good fight and I put the
[52:27] chair down and we you know and we fan
[52:29] the towel and we give him a drink of
[52:31] water and uh we there to support
[52:34] Hallelujah and and we're there to
[52:35] support the Believers amen we support
[52:38] each other amen and I know you're
[52:40] fighting this fight and listen this
[52:42] fight is rough and and and look you I I
[52:45] I there's nothing I can tell you that's
[52:46] new you know everything but I just want
[52:49] to tell you yeah the fight is
[52:51] rough and it's okay to say brother I'm
[52:54] having a hard time
[52:56] Believers don't want to do that how are
[52:58] you good how are you okay and I
[53:02] understand they say don't don't uh uh
[53:04] magnify the negative I know that too
[53:06] right but it's sometimes good to say
[53:08] okay you know brother I've got a problem
[53:09] I'm struggling pray for me you know
[53:12] support me be there for me and that is
[53:15] what it's all
[53:16] about I don't personally I believe
[53:20] holding a mic and standing behind the
[53:22] pulpit that's the smallest part of my
[53:24] Ministry
[53:25] that's what I this is f right the
[53:27] biggest part of my Ministry is being
[53:29] there for people it's all about people
[53:33] and it's and and and and we do it you do
[53:35] it from Your Heart Right you've got a
[53:37] heart for the people and so this fight
[53:41] as Jude said he says we earnestly
[53:43] contending for the faith right and uh I
[53:47] I I I went and I I don't do this and I
[53:49] sort of thought I'd do it I going to go
[53:51] look at the word contend in the Greek
[53:53] word and this is what the scholars WR
[53:55] but I don't do this I'm I'm I'm uh I'm
[53:58] very simple person humble person you I
[54:00] don't I'm not educated but I can't even
[54:03] say the word but I looked at the Greek
[54:05] word for contend and it's I'll just
[54:07] spell it e p a g o n i z o m a i I don't
[54:13] know what it is right that's the Greek
[54:15] word for
[54:16] contend and it
[54:18] says contend it it means to contend
[54:22] about a thing as a combat
[54:26] patent listen so we're not on a
[54:31] picnic I I want to just remind you
[54:34] you're not you're not sitting in the
[54:36] park somewhere amen with your picnic
[54:38] blanket and your picnic lunch and you're
[54:41] looking into the eyes of your loved one
[54:43] you know and there little hearts and
[54:44] little arrows and uh you it's not always
[54:47] that no you you you you a combatant
[54:51] Hallelujah you know you a you a soldier
[54:54] on and I want to encourage you this
[54:56] morning so come on
[54:58] soldiers you you you're not in the
[55:00] kitchen uh uh uh uh um peeling
[55:04] potatoes right you a
[55:07] combatant and and this battle is
[55:12] intensive well maybe yeah some of you
[55:14] know what I'm talking about right and
[55:16] and and I I I picture the soldier right
[55:21] I picture this special elitist Force and
[55:25] when they go to army they put the stuff
[55:27] on their faces and they got bandana on
[55:28] their heads and they you know they and
[55:31] you look at them and you can see man
[55:32] they they it's been rough all right and
[55:35] I and I went further and and apparently
[55:37] this word content comes from the English
[55:40] word earnest comes from the English word
[55:41] to
[55:43] agonize and Agony he says and the they
[55:47] say this is the effort we should expend
[55:51] as we undertake the counter attack
[55:56] and I read that and I thought man that's
[55:58] it you see we as Believers we we we we
[56:02] we sometimes we too passive
[56:05] man you know we we we we sit back and we
[56:09] and we let the enemy attack
[56:11] us sometimes I think we should go on the
[56:17] attack now I want to ask you sitting
[56:20] back and saying this is my lot where has
[56:24] it gotten us yeah amen where has it
[56:27] gotten us brother I'm just humble and
[56:31] I'm just the devil punching bag while
[56:33] you could be I
[56:36] ain't the English guy says it's about a
[56:39] counter
[56:42] attack and it's about identifying where
[56:46] the biggest issues are yes sir and then
[56:50] going on the
[56:52] attack we're not going to build up our
[56:55] defenses we're not going to build up the
[56:58] walls yes we have the walls but we're
[57:00] not going to build up and hide behind it
[57:03] you know what I mean and Dodge the enemy
[57:05] and hide from the enemy I believe it's
[57:07] time we as Believers we go on the
[57:12] Counterattack so this morning God is
[57:14] looking for
[57:15] believers now yes we have
[57:19] problems and I will never uh uh
[57:22] disrespect what you're going through
[57:25] I will never turn around and tell you

[57:29] will but I know we go through problems
[57:32] and I know there are things that happen
[57:35] and I know there are situations but
[57:38] really Believers it's time we deal with
[57:41] these things it's time we put our
[57:44] shoulders
[57:47] back amen I know say you say things like
[57:50] that it scares the life out of people
[57:52] right and it's associated with vigorous
[57:57] combat this earnestly contending it's
[58:00] not just taking a stroll in the park and
[58:03] you know holding your husband or your
[58:04] wife's hand and look that's good too
[58:07] amen looking in each other's eyes and uh
[58:09] you know the young brothers are praying

[1:12:11] own do you know it's
[1:12:14] yours I can't tell you it's yours you
[1:12:17] have to realize it's yours you have to
[1:12:19] look at this Bible and say every promise
[1:12:23] and the book is
[1:12:25] mine every chapter every verse every
[1:12:29] line as it go I am
[1:12:32] trusting in his love
[1:12:34] divine every promise in the book is
[1:12:39] mine now I can't sing that for you you
[1:12:43] got to sing it for
[1:12:44] yourself you've got to get a
[1:12:47] revelation that God you gave me a
[1:12:50] promise I can't get that for you and
[1:12:53] that is really what the ministry is
[1:12:55] trying to achieve it's for you as an
[1:12:58] individual to say wow he is a Healer
[1:13:03] amen I can't get that for you you as an
[1:13:07] individual to say wow he does answer
[1:13:11] prayer wow he does meet
[1:13:15] needs you see I can get that for you and
[1:13:18] really that's what brother Ben is trying
[1:13:20] to achieve he's really trying to get you
[1:13:22] to get to a place to
[1:13:26] realize that's actually my
[1:13:29] promise you see the god that created
[1:13:34] what we what we walking on the earth he
[1:13:37] created it with a spoken
[1:13:39] word that was his building
[1:13:42] tools he never had the tools that Ben
[1:13:45] uses to build a house he just St stood
[1:13:49] there and brother BR says he stood on an
[1:13:51] invisible platform and he just just
[1:13:53] spoke and he said let there be now I
[1:13:57] don't care what the agnostics and the
[1:14:01] atheists and the unbelievers say about
[1:14:04] creation I'm simple enough to know he
[1:14:07] spoke
[1:14:08] it now the same God that said let there
[1:14:13] be all right it's he's the same God that
[1:14:17] said by his stripes you are healed huah
[1:14:23] yes
[1:14:24] sir am I
[1:14:26] right he's the same God that said I'll
[1:14:30] meet every
[1:14:32] need he said you are the head and not
[1:14:36] the
[1:14:37] tail he said I'll bless you going out
[1:14:41] and coming in he said I'll be your
[1:14:44] portion you got all the promises but
[1:14:47] these promises Believers won't mean
[1:14:51] anything to you as an individual Until
[1:14:55] you realize oh my word that's for
[1:14:59] me and then you take what he said is for
[1:15:03] you and you apply it to your life and he
[1:15:07] said that your family is like a quiv of
[1:15:11] arrows right so if some of the arrows
[1:15:15] has gotten a mind of its own and God W
[1:15:19] gone wondering a little bit the Bible
[1:15:22] says your
[1:15:23] qu will be
[1:15:25] full so they may Wonder but they can't
[1:15:29] stay but I can't get that Revelation for
[1:15:33] you nobody can get that Revelation for
[1:15:36] you you have to get
[1:15:38] it who gave Abraham his
[1:15:41] Revelation yes 25 years man oh brother
[1:15:46] Noah to any
[1:15:49] man anybody here been 100 Years yet
[1:15:53] none of you what gave Abraham the
[1:15:56] gumption man huh and sister
[1:16:02] SAR in his
[1:16:04] church one of the founding members in
[1:16:07] his church didn't want to believe am all
[1:16:10] right you know the
[1:16:11] Bible did that move Pastor
[1:16:14] Abraham when the church never said amen
[1:16:17] when he preached never moved Pastor
[1:16:21] Abraham uhuh Pastor Abraham said or
[1:16:24] Pastor Ben said pastor Abraham said God
[1:16:29] said am I right he never said I said or
[1:16:34] you said he said God said now God put
[1:16:39] that in the Bible yes it's history he
[1:16:42] put it there because he knew there'd be
[1:16:45] someone come along with a similar
[1:16:50] circumstance and with that similar Circ
[1:16:53] circumstance that someone will be able
[1:16:55] to take what Abraham said and done and
[1:16:58] said If Abraham can I
[1:17:03] can and Sister
[1:17:06] Sarah being the fleshly the way she was
[1:17:10] she misguided the pastor a little bit
[1:17:13] but the church is church right but it
[1:17:16] never wavered Pastor Abraham he stood
[1:17:19] there now here's my question did the
[1:17:22] Deon convince Pastor Abraham did the
[1:17:25] elders convince Pastor Abraham or did
[1:17:28] God give Pastor Abraham a
[1:17:33] revelation and that's the key he had a
[1:17:37] revelation amen that God told him one
[1:17:39] day Abraham look up and Abraham looked
[1:17:42] up that's your seed can you count it no
[1:17:46] Abraham look at the sand can you count
[1:17:48] it no that's your seed and Abraham got a
[1:17:52] revelation
[1:17:54] and the Bible me picks it up in Romans
[1:17:57] and said Abraham grew stronger in Praise
[1:18:02] amen so Abraham with a
[1:18:06] revelation not a
[1:18:08] son not of manifestation with a
[1:18:12] revelation of the
[1:18:15] word want you listen to me Believers a
[1:18:18] revelation of the word sustained Abraham
[1:18:22] for 25
[1:18:26] years wasn't
[1:18:28] Isaac no no no wasn't Hager it wasn't
[1:18:32] Sarah it was a
[1:18:35] revelation of what God had promised
[1:18:38] sustained him for 25 years amen 25 years
[1:18:43] later year was little Isaac but for 25
[1:18:47] years he held on to a
[1:18:51] promise you know what I'm saying yeah
[1:18:54] huh I know what I'm saying huh find a
[1:18:57] promise then say God reveal that promise
[1:19:01] to me now with your revelation of the
[1:19:05] promise you'll be standing huh amen
[1:19:07] you'll be coming to church every Sunday
[1:19:10] and you'll be get stronger and so as
[1:19:12] Abram got weaker physically spiritually
[1:19:16] he got
[1:19:18] stronger every time he looked in the
[1:19:19] mirror and he saw another gray hair he
[1:19:21] got stronger yeah yeah every time he
[1:19:24] looked in the mirror he saw another
[1:19:25] wrinkle he got stronger every time he
[1:19:28] looked at Mama Sarah and Mama Sarah was
[1:19:30] older he got
[1:19:32] stronger and even when Sarah doubted you
[1:19:36] know what I love Bible says you know
[1:19:38] what the Bible says the Bible says Sarah
[1:19:41] laughed and the Bible says Abraham
[1:19:44] laughed right but when you go to the
[1:19:47] book of
[1:19:49] Hebrews and you try and find out when
[1:19:52] they write about the memo he's going to
[1:19:54] me anky right he's going to give me a
[1:19:57] cloth but he says I'm not wiping my face
[1:19:59] I better do it e i just sorry brother I
[1:20:02] just sometimes get so caught up and I I
[1:20:05] couldn't be bothered wiping sorry I
[1:20:07] apologize right it must be
[1:20:10] unpleasant I apologize if it looked
[1:20:13] unappealing to the
[1:20:15] eye looking at the sweaty Bal man sorry
[1:20:18] I apologize
[1:20:21] we might as well go home
[1:20:24] huh what's the song they used to teach
[1:20:26] us when we were younger fishing for
[1:20:28] Jesus we'll change it brother sweating
[1:20:30] for
[1:20:33] Jesus am all right and this is what I
[1:20:37] love but when Abraham's memo were
[1:20:41] written in Hebrews
[1:20:44] 11 nothing was said about Abraham
[1:20:49] laughing nothing was said about Abraham
[1:20:52] listening to to his wife's fleshly
[1:20:54] fleshly commands nothing was said and
[1:20:59] nothing was said about Sarah
[1:21:02] laughing
[1:21:03] nothing so you've got to decide what you
[1:21:06] want to
[1:21:07] believe right and Abraham I tell you
[1:21:11] Abraham I tell you God just thinking I
[1:21:13] don't know about what
[1:21:15] but and so yeah Abraham meets this
[1:21:19] King right you know the story right he
[1:21:23] meets this King I just want to show how
[1:21:24] God works and he goes to the king with a
[1:21:28] 90-year-old
[1:21:30] wife H and the King Falls for a
[1:21:33] 90-year-old wife hey and something must
[1:21:38] have happen to this woman but man he had
[1:21:41] the most beautiful ladies at his be and
[1:21:44] call and he falls for this woman here
[1:21:46] that's 90 years old something must have
[1:21:49] happened but the point I'm trying to
[1:21:51] make so Abraham tell tell Sarah this is
[1:21:54] that God's vessel with a revelation you
[1:21:59] know this guy that was known as the
[1:22:02] friend of God I I'm trying to show you
[1:22:05] stop underselling what God what how God
[1:22:08] sees you and I show you how God sees you
[1:22:11] so this man God's
[1:22:13] friend tells his wife tell them you're
[1:22:17] my
[1:22:18] sister and the King falls in love with a
[1:22:21] 90 listen a 90y old woman
[1:22:25] man
[1:22:28] 90 don't don't don't be all spiritual
[1:22:32] 90 don't don't be don't don't
[1:22:35] spiritualize this now she's a 90y old
[1:22:39] woman and he's a 100y old
[1:22:42] man right go and Google what 90 looks
[1:22:50] like look somebody like me was probably
[1:22:53] right and I'm not even there yet but the
[1:22:55] point I'm trying to make this morning is
[1:22:58] and so the king likes her and God comes
[1:23:00] to the king and says hey you better give
[1:23:02] this man's wife back but the king said
[1:23:04] but God he told me and God said that's
[1:23:07] why I'm giving you a chance no he's
[1:23:10] God's friend he has a revelation he's
[1:23:13] God's Prophet but he's a
[1:23:16] liar
[1:23:17] right God turns around to him and God
[1:23:22] tells the King you better give that
[1:23:24] man's wife back he's my
[1:23:27] Prophet hang on hang on right there stop
[1:23:29] the bus but I thought he
[1:23:32] lied I I'm trying to show you just
[1:23:35] because you
[1:23:36] failed doesn't change God's mind about
[1:23:42] you just
[1:23:44] because you wouldn't being a little bit
[1:23:46] fruitful with your worship didn't change
[1:23:49] God's mind and here is the point here
[1:23:52] here's the
[1:23:53] cliner not only does God say you better
[1:23:56] give his woman back his wife back he's
[1:23:58] my prophet and you better let this guy
[1:24:02] pray for
[1:24:03] you this
[1:24:06] liar you want me to get this liar to
[1:24:09] pray for me you better get him to pray
[1:24:11] for you because he's my Prophet so his
[1:24:15] behavior didn't change the
[1:24:18] calling you hear me so just because you
[1:24:22] have have a
[1:24:23] problem it doesn't change that God has
[1:24:27] called you to be a soldier contending
[1:24:31] for this Faith that's been restored by
[1:24:35] William
[1:24:40] brandham the liar sorry to call him a
[1:24:43] liar but that's what he was the lying
[1:24:45] brother had to pray for him for the king
[1:24:49] and he was still God's Prophet so being
[1:24:52] en encourage this morning church huh God
[1:24:55] did the same with job God tells job's
[1:24:58] bodes if you want me to forgive you you
[1:25:00] better let joob pray for you the brother
[1:25:02] on the
[1:25:03] asep the brother on the asep scratching
[1:25:06] his boils the brother was told by his
[1:25:09] wife man Curse God and die thank God job
[1:25:11] had a revelation you speak like her now
[1:25:14] brothers that doesn't give us license to
[1:25:16] tell our wiv is that
[1:25:17] right God said you get that man to pray
[1:25:20] for
[1:25:21] you and I want to let you know this
[1:25:23] morning the calling on your life is
[1:25:27] precious and just because you made a
[1:25:30] mistake doesn't change the calling just
[1:25:34] because go then God made a mistake then
[1:25:38] God made a mistake when he predestinated
[1:25:40] you if you feel I'm not worthy of this
[1:25:44] calling if you feel this morning I think
[1:25:48] I've gone too far then you saying
[1:25:50] predestination was wrong
[1:25:52] wrong but I want to let you know this
[1:25:54] morning predestination is not wrong now
[1:25:58] you see because what God I was saying
[1:26:00] the other day the Bible says he is the
[1:26:03] author and the finisher the Bible says
[1:26:07] nothing but the in between right we
[1:26:10] don't know what happens in between and
[1:26:12] if we knew brother we'd Run for Our
[1:26:14] Lives I don't want to know about the in
[1:26:16] between but what I do know he's the same
[1:26:18] God that started it he'll be the same
[1:26:20] God that finishes it he said I'm the
[1:26:23] author and I'm the finisher yes there
[1:26:26] may be some
[1:26:27] mountains yeah there may be some fire
[1:26:30] amen what does the song say he didn't
[1:26:32] promise that the cross would not get
[1:26:35] heavy and the hills been hard to climb
[1:26:40] he never Pro offered a victory
[1:26:43] without I without F but he
[1:26:47] said help will always come in time so

[1:28:10] up he
[1:28:14] never help nowadays
[1:28:18] e oh man but anyway praise the Lord I
[1:28:22] think we can just go home I want to
[1:28:24] encourage you church now just to pick up
[1:28:26] the faith
[1:28:28] quickly because this is what we're
[1:28:29] fighting for now we're not starting to
[1:28:34] contend we have been
[1:28:36] contending right we have been right I
[1:28:39] don't know how long but we have
[1:28:42] been and the fight has been
[1:28:46] 2023 let's just say it's been
[1:28:49] interesting that's right it's been
[1:28:51] interesting
[1:28:52] right has it been
[1:28:55] interesting but because you've been
[1:28:57] contending you've been contending for a
[1:29:01] faith that's been restored by Brother
[1:29:06] brandom Jude said the faith was
[1:29:09] delivered
[1:29:11] once Malachi came forame and restored it
[1:29:15] he went to fetch that faith that was
[1:29:18] lost through the Dark Ages and he
[1:29:20] brought it back into this day and he
[1:29:23] said I'm restoring that faith and
[1:29:27] brother brandham has gone of the sin so
[1:29:29] I say the faith not a
[1:29:33] faith not a faith that we are saved by
[1:29:36] grace through faith now that faith and
[1:29:40] this faith is not two separate faiths
[1:29:43] it's the same Faith but this one here is
[1:29:45] a matured faith that one year is a faith
[1:29:49] that just starts you on your journey but
[1:29:51] this Faith here is a restored faith that
[1:29:54] you've been fighting for now when Jude
[1:29:59] told them that they needed to be
[1:30:01] restored to contend for a faith that was
[1:30:06] delivered I went back and I asked into
[1:30:09] brother bram's message and I asked
[1:30:10] myself what happened on the day of
[1:30:14] Pentecost and brother brand makes a
[1:30:16] statement and he says those Apostles
[1:30:19] their bodies were quickened
[1:30:23] very strong word
[1:30:25] quickened he doesn't say their bodies
[1:30:28] were
[1:30:30] changed because if their bodies were
[1:30:33] changed there would have been a
[1:30:36] Rapture but their bodies were quickened
[1:30:39] they were quickened by the Holy Ghost
[1:30:40] their bodies and Jude is trying to tell
[1:30:43] the people hey you got to go back to
[1:30:46] that a quickening of a
[1:30:49] body but brother brandham comes comes
[1:30:52] along and he says no no no we're not
[1:30:54] just going back to a body being
[1:30:56] quickened we going back to a body being
[1:31:01] changed so if I can say this we are
[1:31:04] contending for what Jude said plus
[1:31:10] more so you are on a journey this
[1:31:14] morning not to get the faith restored
[1:31:18] it's already been restored you are just
[1:31:20] contending for that Faith to operate in
[1:31:23] your
[1:31:25] life because brother brother Brandon
[1:31:27] said Jesus introduced the faith I'm not
[1:31:29] going to read the quotes and he says you
[1:31:32] got to look at the life of Jesus the
[1:31:35] signs the Wonders the Miracles and he
[1:31:37] came and I say he introduced the faith
[1:31:40] in three phases or stages amen the first
[1:31:43] one was your brother Brandon had three
[1:31:45] pools also and the first one was healing
[1:31:48] right Jesus healed right healed
[1:31:52] the second stage he discerned the spirit
[1:31:55] woman at a well right and he said yeah
[1:31:58] your husband the fif six husband but
[1:32:01] then the third stage he now broke the
[1:32:03] word and he said unless you eat my flesh
[1:32:06] and drink my blood you've got no part of
[1:32:09] me he started opening the word and then
[1:32:11] they walked away the 70 was it the 70
[1:32:15] something like that and then Jesus said
[1:32:16] do you also want to go thank God for
[1:32:19] Peter hey thank God for Peter
[1:32:22] this impulsive brother Peter thank God
[1:32:24] Peter said Lord where where am I going
[1:32:25] to go where am I going to go and that's
[1:32:28] how we feel this morning where are we
[1:32:31] going to
[1:32:32] go if we walk away from this message
[1:32:35] where are we going to go are you going
[1:32:39] to go back to John 3:16 church for God
[1:32:42] so loved the world we love that but you
[1:32:45] see that was the start of our journey
[1:32:49] but we don't stick around the mountain
[1:32:51] of John 3:16 and I thank God for a
[1:32:55] prophet imagine we never had a prophet
[1:32:58] we'll still be preaching this morning
[1:33:00] for God so loved the
[1:33:02] world we go beyond that and so Jesus
[1:33:06] introduced the faith in his life and
[1:33:10] that Faith culminated on the day of
[1:33:13] Pentecost and you know what happened on
[1:33:15] the day of Pentecost right you know
[1:33:18] right something happened there
[1:33:22] there was 120 devout
[1:33:25] Jews walked into the upper
[1:33:28] room they couldn't handle one
[1:33:30] another read the
[1:33:32] Bible they had battles with
[1:33:36] positions they had drama with
[1:33:41] personalities some one of their mothers
[1:33:43] even came and said Jesus put my one son
[1:33:46] on the left and my one son on the right
[1:33:48] thank God for zala's
[1:33:50] mothers they were cowards brother
[1:33:53] brandham
[1:33:54] said when Jesus died his church almost
[1:33:58] broke up did you know that he had been
[1:34:01] walking and preaching to them for three
[1:34:03] and a half years yeah he dies and the
[1:34:05] church almost breaks up and the head
[1:34:08] Deacon decides I'm leaving the
[1:34:10] church Peter Peter said I go fishing am
[1:34:14] I right I'm just quoting
[1:34:15] scripture and the other Bru in the
[1:34:17] church said hey Pete we go
[1:34:19] too Jesus is church almost broke up
[1:34:23] because Jesus wasn't around you know why
[1:34:25] because it was just
[1:34:27] word and so Jesus comes out of the Grave
[1:34:30] he leaves the people that he pulled out
[1:34:32] of paradise to go and do some
[1:34:34] sightseeing and he says I got to go
[1:34:36] check this church of mine because Sunday
[1:34:38] morning brother Thomas is not even in
[1:34:43] church this is at the resurrection first
[1:34:46] service should have been there Thomas
[1:34:48] said I ain't going to
[1:34:50] church scripture unless so Thomas is not
[1:34:55] in
[1:34:56] church if Jesus if Jesus hadn't arose
[1:34:59] now listen now you thinking you thinking
[1:35:01] your situation is so
[1:35:04] bad right my situation is so bad brother
[1:35:07] you wouldn't known my situation put
[1:35:09] yourself in Peter
[1:35:11] shoes huh he cut off malus's malus's ear
[1:35:16] right he swore I didn't know Jesus he
[1:35:21] says I'm going fishing he influences
[1:35:24] half the church to go fishing with him
[1:35:26] he is just one backsliding brother he is
[1:35:29] totally backsliding and he's fishing on
[1:35:32] the shore fishing and uh yeah I don't
[1:35:35] want I won't say the state he was in but
[1:35:37] it was
[1:35:38] fishing Jesus
[1:35:41] arose right and thank God now sisters be
[1:35:45] be calm sisters the sisters at the
[1:35:50] tomb
[1:35:51] sisters calm down sisters calm
[1:35:54] down the sisters at the tomb are there
[1:35:58] to anoint the
[1:36:00] body thank God for our sisters e our
[1:36:04] sisters that just know how to say amen
[1:36:06] and worship God and amen make God God if
[1:36:10] Jesus tells the disciples he says hey it
[1:36:14] says go tell my disciples I'll meet them
[1:36:18] but he says go tell my disciples and and
[1:36:23] Peter now I sometimes tell myself I
[1:36:27] never denied God I may have cut off the
[1:36:30] ear I may have done things I shouldn't
[1:36:32] have I may I console myself with that I
[1:36:35] never denied God and here Peter denies
[1:36:39] Jesus right and Jesus says tell Peter
[1:36:42] I'm tell Peter all right so the story
[1:36:44] goes fast forward now in the upper
[1:36:47] room the faith is about to be delivered
[1:36:51] they in the upper room yeah and God puts
[1:36:54] them in a room 120 he locks them
[1:36:58] upstairs in a room that they were behind
[1:37:01] closed doors because they were scared of
[1:37:03] the Pharisees and I don't know whether
[1:37:06] they used perfume back then I don't know
[1:37:09] whether they washed their feet back then
[1:37:11] because remember they walked so you have
[1:37:13] 120 people locked in a room we don't
[1:37:17] know what the size of the room is and
[1:37:19] God leaves them there for 10 days
[1:37:24] days can you imagine the
[1:37:27] personalities can you imagine oh my Lord
[1:37:30] the
[1:37:31] issues and he keeps him there for 10
[1:37:33] days he's getting his church
[1:37:37] sorted 10 days later or was it 50 days
[1:37:40] so it's 40 days and Jesus ascends and
[1:37:43] then on the 50th day the Bible says when
[1:37:45] the day of Pentecost was fully come
[1:37:48] something happened the faith was
[1:37:50] delivered am something
[1:37:53] happened because the Bible brother
[1:37:55] Brandon said they came out of there they
[1:37:58] were no longer
[1:37:59] cowards I want to let you know this
[1:38:01] morning the Holy Ghost is a definite
[1:38:05] experience that brings a change in a
[1:38:08] person's
[1:38:09] life you cannot meet God in a burning
[1:38:13] bush experience and be the
[1:38:16] same you cannot that's so I say what we
[1:38:20] need is to make sure our kids get the
[1:38:22] Holy
[1:38:23] Ghost and here they come out 120 right
[1:38:26] come up the upper room Holy Ghost all
[1:38:28] over them licks of fire resting on on
[1:38:31] them right and we need a
[1:38:35] spokesman and we definitely not going to
[1:38:37] use
[1:38:38] Peter because Thomas may be said I only
[1:38:41] never came to church I didn't lie I
[1:38:43] didn't swear I didn't cut the ear I
[1:38:45] didn't curse I should be the spokesman
[1:38:48] am all right Matthew said no I should be
[1:38:50] the spokesman man holy ghost anoints
[1:38:53] Peter as a
[1:38:54] spokesman didn't change Peter's calling
[1:38:58] your mistakes doesn't change your
[1:39:00] calling your failures doesn't change
[1:39:02] your
[1:39:03] predestination what you did listen stop
[1:39:07] saying God you made a mistake when you
[1:39:09] called me God doesn't make
[1:39:12] mistakes it's 120 right something
[1:39:17] happened however their bodies were
[1:39:20] quickened
[1:39:21] and now brother randam says and this
[1:39:23] maybe you don't like this part he said
[1:39:26] if the church a now the church was
[1:39:27] planted then right he says now he says
[1:39:30] if the church age started with
[1:39:36] fire just brother random he says over
[1:39:39] down on the other side it's going to end
[1:39:42] with
[1:39:45] fire so if the faith was
[1:39:49] delivered with fire
[1:39:52] somewhere along the line in the
[1:39:54] restoration process there's got to be
[1:39:58] fire and people are scared of the fire
[1:40:01] people are scared of this Holy Ghost
[1:40:04] Fire that's burning in my soul it feels
[1:40:08] just like fire don't you sing a song
[1:40:10] like
[1:40:14] that it's just like that's what it say
[1:40:17] it's just like fire shut up in my bones
[1:40:22] do you know what you're
[1:40:24] singing it feels like fire there Holy
[1:40:27] Ghost
[1:40:29] Fire when Peter came out of the upper
[1:40:31] room with his fire look otherwise you
[1:40:35] got to stop singing the song otherwi
[1:40:38] brother Isaac they'll have to stop
[1:40:39] singing the song Because if this fire is
[1:40:42] shut up in your
[1:40:44] bones oh
[1:40:47] church I'm telling you because when that
[1:40:50] fire struck Peter's Jewish
[1:40:54] bones he came from that upper room and
[1:40:57] they thought he had been to the bottle
[1:41:02] store they thought he had drunk a liter
[1:41:05] of Jack
[1:41:06] Daniels they didn't know this was
[1:41:11] fire shut up in his
[1:41:14] bones and that is what we need church we
[1:41:17] don't need more Doctrine we don't need
[1:41:20] more revelation we need a manifestation
[1:41:23] of the song that was on the screen fire
[1:41:27] shut up in my
[1:41:30] bones people are scared of the fire
[1:41:33] people are scared that the fire may make
[1:41:35] you do things you don't want to do yes
[1:41:37] it will the fire will make you shout
[1:41:40] have you seen what brother Marcus does
[1:41:41] when the Holy Ghost gets a hold of him
[1:41:44] man something happens man and when the
[1:41:46] Fire gets in your bones you can't turn
[1:41:49] it off that's right
[1:41:51] you can't turn it off Hallelujah so we
[1:41:54] praying for all of you to get the fire

[1:42:16] bones I don't want to I don't want to
[1:42:18] talk color and nationality and all all
[1:42:21] that but we want to see a fair skinned
[1:42:23] person run let that fire get in their
[1:42:27] bones it will do it to the fair skin and
[1:42:30] the dark skin and the yellow skin and

[1:45:08] sympathy it's fire in my
[1:45:11] bones something happened and church
[1:45:14] something happened to brother Peter and
[1:45:16] I want to encourage all of you this
[1:45:18] morning especially young guys you young
[1:45:20] sisters and young brothers and young
[1:45:22] sisters man I tell you it's something
[1:45:25] awesome when the Holy Ghost takes a hold
[1:45:27] of you it doesn't look nice to the
[1:45:30] natural eye but man it doesn't matter
[1:45:33] but when you get up from there oh
[1:45:36] Hallelujah man amen you may snot and man
[1:45:40] and all that stuff sorry I shouldn't say
[1:45:42] that but the Holy Ghost when it hits you
[1:45:45] man hallelujah oh Hallelujah it does
[1:45:48] something on the inside
[1:45:51] my Lord it does something man I tell you
[1:45:53] you get up from
[1:45:55] there you love
[1:45:57] everybody you love everybody you care
[1:46:01] about everybody amen when the Devil
[1:46:03] comes with trials yeah he trips you up
[1:46:05] now and then but there just something
[1:46:07] that picks you
[1:46:09] up you know what I'm talking about
[1:46:11] something that picks you
[1:46:13] up so I haven't lost my thought I'm
[1:46:15] watching my clock amen so Peter faith is
[1:46:19] restored
[1:46:21] delivered 33 years later they lose it
[1:46:25] now they never lost it it was just that
[1:46:28] the original Apostles they died out and
[1:46:32] that's the scary part is that second
[1:46:35] generation that third generation or the
[1:46:38] fourth generation that's the scary part
[1:46:42] because you see my dad and has has I
[1:46:45] mean you know he's he's had a period
[1:46:48] right and now I come along right as a
[1:46:51] Son of God but it's that generation
[1:46:54] after that's the scary part because if
[1:46:57] they don't meet God like Dad did and
[1:47:01] like I did and like brother Ben did and
[1:47:03] like brother Isaac did we're going to
[1:47:05] have problems going
[1:47:07] forward we're going to have problems
[1:47:09] going forward I looked at the young men
[1:47:11] yes the young boy sitting I look at them
[1:47:13] I said if God doesn't meet them we're in
[1:47:16] trouble brother Ben we are in trouble if
[1:47:19] God doesn't meet our children
[1:47:20] we are in trouble but that's not that
[1:47:23] that's it's not all that gloom and doom
[1:47:26] God said I'll meet them because God said
[1:47:29] that's my promise so our children are
[1:47:31] our
[1:47:33] heritage so they may wonder they can't
[1:47:36] stray they coming back they coming back
[1:47:40] so if anybody here has got children that
[1:47:42] are away with be at rest they coming
[1:47:44] back amen you may look at them and they
[1:47:47] may be painted up and short dress and
[1:47:50] hair cut and all my parting in the world
[1:47:52] and don't worry it's easy for 30 to say
[1:47:56] right I can hear you also say yeah
[1:47:58] brother for it's easy for you to say
[1:48:00] Amen you don't have those problems that
[1:48:02] I have and you don't amen I understand
[1:48:06] but let me encourage you they going to
[1:48:09] come because
[1:48:12] predestination is
[1:48:15] strong I tell you that sometimes we just
[1:48:19] as parents we need to be a little bit
[1:48:20] hard and make a hard decision that will
[1:48:24] reap good benefits but that is between
[1:48:27] you and God right but I want to
[1:48:30] encourage you they're
[1:48:32] coming you know it's like God will start
[1:48:35] reeling them in and I always tell the
[1:48:38] young people you can come easy or you
[1:48:40] can come
[1:48:41] hard and some of them are so silly they
[1:48:45] come the hard way we were talking that
[1:48:47] and I we were driving me saying we
[1:48:50] realize that it's a demon that gets onto
[1:48:53] the child and makes that child feel that
[1:48:56] me being rebellious is the right thing
[1:48:59] they are not at their sound
[1:49:02] Minds you don't you don't I'm telling
[1:49:04] you because what makes a child that grow
[1:49:08] up in the grew up in the church decide
[1:49:10] to walk away from God somewhere they
[1:49:13] picked up a devil
[1:49:16] sir I'm telling you sorry I got to say
[1:49:18] that so what we we need to do is we we
[1:49:22] we need to pick up the skill of
[1:49:25] Deliverance some or other we need to get
[1:49:28] God you need to show me how to set my
[1:49:30] children
[1:49:32] free because brother brandham said I
[1:49:34] should have served God from the age of
[1:49:36] 12 but there was a devil that stopped
[1:49:40] me so what we need to do parents is less
[1:49:43] up the belt and more of the knes and I
[1:49:46] know you do that I know you do that go
[1:49:49] to to 12 wow
[1:49:51] haven't touched my notes right but let's
[1:49:53] let's finish with
[1:49:55] this so the Holy Ghost Faith restored
[1:49:58] deliver
[1:49:59] it generation dies Jude comes 33 years
[1:50:03] later he says Hey we've got to contend
[1:50:05] for that right gets lost through the
[1:50:08] church ages but God says I'll
[1:50:12] restore he said I'll send you Elijah the
[1:50:14] prophet hallelujah amen and he'll turn
[1:50:17] the hearts of the fathers to the
[1:50:19] children
[1:50:20] amen thank God for brother brandom and
[1:50:23] brother brandham comes with a message
[1:50:25] listen it comes with a message that
[1:50:28] restores the faith right restores the
[1:50:33] faith they had three and a half years
[1:50:37] we've had more than that so the faith
[1:50:39] gets restored right but he locks it up
[1:50:42] in books and tapes because some of us
[1:50:45] were not
[1:50:46] around so laying in the message is
[1:50:49] rapturing
[1:50:50] Faith right so we're not fighting for I
[1:50:55] want a I want a Ministry of healing yes
[1:50:58] we want healing we're not fighting for
[1:51:00] miracles and signs and wonders yes we
[1:51:03] want that but we're fighting for a body
[1:51:06] to be
[1:51:07] changed that's what we're fighting for
[1:51:09] so Jude said hey we got quickened at
[1:51:12] Pentecost let's go back to that brother
[1:51:15] BR says no we're not going back to that
[1:51:16] only we're going to back to that plus
[1:51:20] because we've got to get back to
[1:51:22] Eden right we need to have a body change
[1:51:27] cuz brother brand said it's not just a
[1:51:29] faith it's the faith a faith for a
[1:51:34] Rapture so what we contending for is for
[1:51:38] a
[1:51:40] Rapture some of you don't believe me all
[1:51:43] right do you believe there's going to be
[1:51:45] a
[1:51:46] Rapture do you believe the Rapture is on
[1:51:49] do you you believe you're part of the
[1:51:51] Rapture now I've got a question for you
[1:51:53] do you believe you
[1:51:56] changing you had to think about that
[1:51:59] first because you thought it was like a
[1:52:00] trick question not a trick question do
[1:52:03] you know so you can this morning testify
[1:52:05] that there's things changing in your
[1:52:07] life right do you know what that proves
[1:52:11] that the rapture's
[1:52:14] on do you realize that if you can say
[1:52:18] today brother that God is changing me it
[1:52:21] means the rapture's
[1:52:23] on you mean we've been in the
[1:52:27] Rapture since I don't know when you've
[1:52:30] been because God's been changing you you
[1:52:34] see this body change is not going to be
[1:52:37] like that the body change is happening
[1:52:41] as we sit in church and as you go
[1:52:43] through life and to as you go to work
[1:52:48] and now
[1:52:50] as 10 to 12 I got to finish now shortly
[1:52:52] right give me a few
[1:52:54] minutes people can
[1:52:57] accept when we say God's A Healer people
[1:53:01] accept that but people struggle with
[1:53:04] when you tell them God's changing you
[1:53:07] because we look in the mirror and we
[1:53:10] don't see the
[1:53:11] change am I right we look in the mirror
[1:53:15] and we know our own
[1:53:17] failures and we know our own mistakes
[1:53:20] and we know what happens when the child
[1:53:21] upsets you right it's all right we know
[1:53:24] that you know that when the child gets
[1:53:26] you makes you angry and all of a
[1:53:28] sudden you blow up like a p
[1:53:31] frog and because you know all these
[1:53:33] things you struggle to accept that
[1:53:36] you're being
[1:53:37] changed you can easily accept if I tell
[1:53:41] you young sister you be God's going to
[1:53:43] send you a husband you say yeah brother
[1:53:46] yeah right you can accept that God God
[1:53:49] will heal you yeah brother God will give
[1:53:51] you a job yeah brother God will meet
[1:53:53] your needs yeah brother but if I tell
[1:53:56] you God's changing
[1:53:58] you that's a difficult one H because we
[1:54:01] judge ourselves by what we see in the
[1:54:05] mirror and what makes it even harder is
[1:54:08] sitting next to you is your biggest
[1:54:10] critic your husband or your
[1:54:14] wife and
[1:54:15] so I'm not going down that path brother
[1:54:18] man where you said amen you to get in
[1:54:20] trouble and I'm not going to be to blame
[1:54:22] for
[1:54:24] that but that's what I'm saying right
[1:54:27] because I can't I struggle to accept
[1:54:31] that God is changing me when I know my
[1:54:34] wife knows me better than I know myself
[1:54:38] because I know my wife knows about the
[1:54:39] times I get upset so am I and and I'm
[1:54:42] thinking the devil's telling me yeah how
[1:54:45] can you say you're being changed when
[1:54:47] your wife will tell you you're not being
[1:54:48] changed
[1:54:50] and so we struggle with that because we
[1:54:53] don't realize but listen I want to tell
[1:54:55] you this morning you're
[1:55:00] changing
[1:55:02] you you are
[1:55:04] changing and your children are changing
[1:55:07] and your home is changing and your life
[1:55:10] is changing and that sister stood up and
[1:55:13] said I'm not what I ought to be I'm not
[1:55:16] what I want to be but thank God I'm not
[1:55:18] what I was
[1:55:20] and that is what we can testify to this
[1:55:23] morning and if you can testify to that
[1:55:26] it means the raptures on it means the
[1:55:29] body change is on but brother Feddy how
[1:55:33] can you say that look at my hair I'm
[1:55:35] getting gray I'm just looking at brother
[1:55:36] Milan's beard that's almost fully gray
[1:55:39] and I dare say he's changing yes he's
[1:55:41] changing
[1:55:43] yes look at sister Marty yes she's
[1:55:45] changing little by little it's happening
[1:55:49] you don't know it it's happening there's
[1:55:51] a change happening there's a change

[1:56:04] like you used to when the Lov one next
[1:56:07] to you upset you don't react like you
[1:56:08] used to you're being changed and if they
[1:56:12] will just be honest they will

[1:58:57] contending you don't realize you've been
[1:59:00] contending for a faith that's already
[1:59:02] been
[1:59:03] restored because what the ministry has
[1:59:05] done they've
[1:59:08] gone check it wasn't my phone e the
[1:59:11] ministry has gone into the message and
[1:59:15] they've picked up the faith and they've
[1:59:18] preached the faith
[1:59:19] to us as
[1:59:21] Believers and then you go to Revelation
[1:59:24] I'm going to finish shortly it's 5 to2
[1:59:26] then you go to Revelation chapter 10 so
[1:59:29] what brother Ben has really been doing
[1:59:31] if I'm allowed to say this is he's come
[1:59:35] with the open
[1:59:37] book you know the open book in
[1:59:39] Revelation chapter 5 he he went to
[1:59:43] Christ and Christ gave him the open book
[1:59:47] which was the Fai fath right and brother
[1:59:51] Ben has come so what happened was the
[1:59:54] angel now steps behind the
[2:00:00] pastor brother brandham says the
[2:00:03] manifestation of the Holy Ghost is the
[2:00:07] Angel so the angel veils himself behind
[2:00:11] Pastor
[2:00:12] Benjamin and the angel through the
[2:00:15] pastor he now presents to you the faith
[2:00:20] that's laying in the word rapturing
[2:00:23] faith body changing Faith overcoming
[2:00:28] Faith but he presents it to you as a
[2:00:33] promise that's what he does he fetches
[2:00:36] it from the angel he comes behind the
[2:00:39] pulpit with a word from the angel which
[2:00:43] is the Faith from the open book and he
[2:00:46] presents it to the church and he titles
[2:00:50] his sermon
[2:00:52] uh speak and go
[2:00:55] forward you don't realize that he's
[2:00:58] bringing the words the promise from the
[2:01:02] angel and he's presenting it to you and
[2:01:05] because we are in
[2:01:08] scripture the angel says brother Ben
[2:01:11] says holy ghost through brother Ben says
[2:01:13] take the book he says that he's
[2:01:16] preaching it inir saying take the book
[2:01:20] I'm just quoting scripture he says take
[2:01:23] the book Revelation
[2:01:25] 10 it's verse seven in the days of the
[2:01:29] voice brother
[2:01:31] brandham verse eight the
[2:01:34] bride to 11 the
[2:01:37] bride so the ministry picks up the voice
[2:01:42] of brother brandham that's laying in
[2:01:44] books and he comes and he presents the
[2:01:46] open book and he says the raptures on on
[2:01:50] right he presents it to you as a word a
[2:01:55] promise now you take that promise and
[2:01:59] you do with it whatever you wish to do
[2:02:00] with it and if you go back to Revelation
[2:02:03] can we go to Revelation 10 brother I've
[2:02:05] got a close there Revelation I've got a
[2:02:07] 10-hour driver right so trust the Lord
[2:02:09] I'll travel like a thought but
[2:02:11] Revelation 10:8 please brother
[2:02:14] Armand and then we'll close right and
[2:02:17] look what the voice says right so verse
[2:02:19] verse 7 brother brandom Revelation 101
[2:02:23] can we go to 101 sorry you know that's
[2:02:26] Christ
[2:02:27] right okay 101 is Christ 107 brother
[2:02:33] please that's brother brandom right
[2:02:37] 108 that's
[2:02:40] us okay you know these things right but
[2:02:45] look what happens from 108 to 11
[2:02:49] there is the word
[2:02:52] presented then there is a response from
[2:02:55] the
[2:02:56] yeara then the year has to do something
[2:03:00] with it and then the year in verse 11
[2:03:04] needs to prophesy it so when the word
[2:03:07] gets presented to you which is today or
[2:03:10] Pastor Ben does you say Amen the angel
[2:03:14] told John take the book all right John
[2:03:18] said Give me the book human nature angel
[2:03:21] said uhuh take the book in other words
[2:03:24] you must want to be in the book take the
[2:03:26] book then the angel said now you eat the
[2:03:29] book so you saying Amen to the book you
[2:03:33] saying hallelujah to the promises and
[2:03:35] then the angel says the Revelation it's
[2:03:39] sweet the revelation of the word it's
[2:03:42] sweet like you this morning saying Amen
[2:03:44] to the word it's
[2:03:46] sweet but then the angel says it's going
[2:03:49] to be bitter in your belly so when your
[2:03:52] child walks away it's bitter when a
[2:03:55] problem happens it's bitter when a
[2:03:57] situation happens it's butter but in the
[2:04:00] mouth oh sweet when you say when you say
