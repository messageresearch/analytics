the scripture but yeah god bless you all trust you've been having a good a good week so far hallelujah hey if you've got eternal life every week's a good week amen hallelujah amen let's go to the book of ephesians we're going to read we're going to read from ephesians 2 and verses 12 to 18 and then we're going to go to uh the book of daniel that's going to take her um we're going to go to daniel chapter 12. amen praise the lord amen amen so good to know the master of the wind so we're going to read from verse 8 verse 12 down to verse 18 amen i love the book of ephesians don't you hallelujah amen the apostle paul writes here that at that time you were you were without christ being aliens from the commonwealth of israel and strangers from the covenants of promise having no hope and without god in the world but now in christ jesus ye who were sometimes were afar off are made nigh by the blood of christ for he is our peace who hath ma had made both one and hath broken down the middle wall of partition between us having abolished in his flesh the enmity even the law of commandments contained in the ordinances for to make it himself of twain one new man so making peace and that he might reconcile both unto god in one body by the cross having slammed the enmity thereby and came and preached peace to you which were afar off and to them that were nigh for through him we both have access by one spirit unto the father amen and then we're just going to go to the book of daniel and chapter 12 and we're going to read uh verses 1 to 4. see once we're afar off now we're nigh brother ram says that middle wall that chasm there's no more chasm i mean the blood has reconciled us so much there's no more chasm no it's gone the chasm's gone hallelujah so daniel 12 1. we're just going to read the first four verses here and at that time shall michael stand up the great prince that standeth for the children of thy people and there shall be a time of trouble such as never was since there was a nation even to that same time and at that time thy people shall be delivered every one that is found written in the book and many of them that sleep in the dust of the earth shall awake some to everlasting life and some to shame and everlasting contempt and they that be wise shall shine as the brightness of the firmament and they that and they that turn many to righteousness as the stars for ever and ever but thou o daniel shut up the words and seal the book even to the time of the end many shall run to and fro and knowledge shall be increased amen this just bow heads in a word of prayer this night and dear lord jesus we thank you lord that when we sing we know the master of the wind it's more than a song lord we know you lord you are the master of the wound it doesn't matter how much the devil makes things hell and rage and storm lord jesus you are the creator of heavens and earth lord you are the true master of the wind dear god the maker of the rain so i pray father the lord

there be their portion wherever they are dear god and father i pray give us lord listening ears attentive hearts lord father in jesus christ's name amen amen amen god bless your friends you may have your seats tonight so i want to if i can take a um if i can take a subject i want to speak about the merging of dimensions now we're living in a great time where where eternity and time are blending together where the unseen world is becoming visible hallelujah this is an incredible time you look through the scripture every time redemption begins to play out there's visitations of angels god comes to the earth amen and that unseen world becomes visible among the people hallelujah you know we can read and um you know if we go to exodus chapter three where we can see a a time of exodus here where where there was a there was a redemption was going to take place under the blood of bulls and goats where god was going to redeem his people israel from slavery and he was going to take them and put them into the promised land now was the time and i just want to maybe just drop this in from the get-go i want you to recognize it's not man reaching up to god it's god when he reaches down to man when god begins to you know kind of merge you know between this world into you know that world into this world and begins to make himself real it's when those kind of uh events take place on the earth god is doing something major and i'll say heaven comes down expands upon the earth that god would collect all of his predestinated scenic seed and take them up into a into a rapture so so we can see that you know in this first exodus they did not go from this world to the next world but they'd be taken from egypt into the promised land and we read here in exodus three and and verses six to eight he says moreover he said i am the god of thy father the god of abraham the god of isaac and the god of jacob and moses hit his face for he is afraid to look upon god and the lord said i have surely seen the affliction of my people which are in egypt and have heard their cry by the reason of their task masters for i know their sorrows i'm glad he knows our sorrows i mean i have come down i have come down to deliver them out of the hand of the egyptians and i'm come down out sorry and to bring them up out of that land into a good land in a large unto a land flowing with milk and honey and to a place of the canaanite the hittite the amorite uh and the peshizai the high fight and the jebusite so god says i've heard thy cry they couldn't deliver themselves they couldn't free themselves from the yoke of bondage so god heard their cry and said now there's going to be a time of redemption where i'm going to redeem them i'm going to purchase them and i'm going to take them out of egypt and put them into the promised land and and i like schofield's notes when he talks about the redemption out of egypt because he says god does redemption in two ways by blood and by power i mean by the blood of the lamb they were brought out that passover lamb and by powers the power of god that took them out of egypt so so now here here is you know there had been i don't know how many years you know of your 400 odd years of silence where there's no visitation of god to the people there was no prophet in the land there was nothing but then finally comes the season of redemption where god comes down and he begins to deliver israel he begins to speak to moses the god that he just heard about stepped out of history and became a reality hallelujah and then and then you know you can go through the book of judges and and you know every time there's you know they would fall that people of israel would fall into bondage god would come down like you'd speak to gideon or or he would speak to the mother of samson and you know you know he would he would deliver a message and and redemption are redeeming would take place where the people were no longer under bondage but they became free i mean so they were visitations of angels god would come upon the earth he would speak to his children as like eternity just kind of reached into time and did something hallelujah amen we can even see where you know uh you know there's 400 years of silence from from malachi to john there's no move of the spirit there's nothing recorded of god doing anything but then finally it's like the wheels of prophecy turn and god begins to now it's not just under the blood of bulls and goats being taken from egypt into a promised land but now people are going to be taken under the bondage of sin and they're going to be born again they're going to be made the sons of god redeem back to their rightful position in christ amen to god sends visitations of angels hallelujah gabriel went to mary amen yo you know zechariah or have you say his name the father of john was was was ministering there before the altar of incense and angel spoke to him these things hadn't happened before for many many years but god was eternity heaven was expanding down upon the earth because redemption was going to come to adam's fallen race hallelujah mean then then joseph you know the angel would would speak to him in a dream about don't fear to take marry thy wife because the child that she's carrying is of the holy ghost and you know the wise men were warned you know supernaturally and you know in dreams and you know god was doing something heaven was coming down upon the earth where where it was just theology and debate now it became reality that god was reaching through hallelujah and he was speaking to his children because redemption was taking place hallelujah and then so finally we know that the lord jesus was born amen and the shepherds were there they were just minding their own business on the hillside by bethlehem and then an angel of peace and they you know you know he says fear not i bring great tidings of your good times of great joy was heaven was declaring something hallelujah that that the very messiah that you've been looking for he's upon the earth right now you'll find him in a manger in bethlehem hallelujah and it wasn't just that but then a whole choir of angels filled the sky and begin to sing the first you know first song of the redeemer coming to the earth hallelujah that happened happened before but redemption was taking place i mean so there were visitations of angels hallelujah amen then the shepherds went and they found exactly where jesus was they began to tell everyone about it hallelujah amen then and then and then our lord comes into his ministry and we know that angels visited him in the wilderness right after he received the holy ghost down river jordan he went there tempted by the devil the angels came and strengthened him after he made up his mind in gethsemane i'm going through with this lord jesus you know i'm going through with this god not my will but thy will be done angels came and strengthened him there were visitations of angels hallelujah after the resurrection there was visitations of angels you know there was a you know you know they went up where you know mount transfiguration or the amount of ascension whichever one it was jesus was taken up into heaven and they're looking up and then there's two men appeared in white yes they're a visitation of angels because remember redemption isn't just coming out it's going in there's two parts of redemption so now now the going out had taken place but now it's going to bring a people into christ holy they're going to receive the holy ghost right there are visitations of angels then we have the upper room yo pentecost who's following me what i'm trying to say is you know if we could just look into the unseen world amen it's more than just us in this battle you know we read there and daniel you know at this time michael the great prince is going to stand up for his people hallelujah it's and that's not a physical man that's that's a mighty angel standing up holy that he's going to begin to come upon the earth and things are going to happen hallelujah the world is falling apart but we're in good hands we're in the best hands that they've ever been we're in the hands of almighty god highly not to fall into judgment but to be redeemed hallelujah so we've got to have great confidence you know it doesn't matter what the world does who cares about what they're doing i mean god is just reaching through to get a hold of his elected ones and whosoever will let them come hallelujah so then the upper room happens god fills fills his church with the holy ghost but yet there's still visitations of angels taking place peter would be in a jail he'd be asleep he'd be chained to two men an angel came hit him on the side wake up chains fell off and it was an answer to prayer because the believers were having a prayer meeting because they didn't want to see peter get killed i mean so even if we could not physically get to someone god didn't send an angel holy or someone oh they're out of reach no they're not out of reach heaven can reach anywhere hallelujah around the globe heaven can reach anywhere hallelujah so that angel woke him up his two guys stayed asleep he got up he thought he was having a dream or something followed the angel ride out came to the outside of the prison then he came to himself well that wasn't a dream i'm free hallelujah hallelujah the apostle paul who was still saul at the time was on his way to damascus he met the lord on the road to damascus an angel came to ananias said here comes paul you'll find him street called straight this is where you know who knows the story if i've got it wrong silently say well i'll fix it later hallelujah but you know what i'm talking about i mean to the visitations of angels you know paul would say when he was on the ship on the way to rome and there was a big storm and 14 days of didn't see the sun that blonde to and fro he says the angel of the lord of who i am and who i serve told me this night there'll be no loss of any life on the ship but the ship itself will be lost hallelujah there's visitation of angels amen now if there's a visitation if there was a mighty outpouring of heaven in the beginning of the church should there not be a mighty outpouring of heaven at the end of the church right i think if the alpha bride had a visitation of angels remember cornelius was praying an angel visited him he wasn't even under the atonement yet but he was he was a devout man but god wanted to bring him under the law and to grace and an angel visited him hallelujah amen so so if there were a mighty a mighty visitation of angels in the beginning would it not be strange for it to happen at the end if we have been restored back to a book of acts i just i just want to i pray that we'll just look at the world a bit differently you may well i know these things but but is it real to you is it real that there can be angels in an unseen realm well i don't feel them i doubt very much gerhardi felt them when he woke up that morning in dothan and he looked and saw the assyrians around the city and he was panicking because he said master basically we're whipped you know this is the end of it you know they're going to take the city they're going to kill us and elisha just said well lord he prayed lord open his eyes and he saw chariots of fire the whole army of heaven around halloween he didn't feel them but they were there the whole time remember the prayer didn't bring the army of heaven down the army of heaven was already around the prophet of god hallelujah and i'll say if it was around the prophet of god in the old testament do you not think it would be around the bride of jesus christ today hallelujah so lord jesus open our eyes amen in this room now is more than the people you see amen the angels of god gather holy they come down they anoint our faith they're with us and not just them but god himself comes down inhabits the praises of his people hallelujah i happen to believe it at every great junction of time if you haven't listened to a impactful message go listen to the junction of time brother brown preachers hallelujah amen he says the junction of time no more than three weeks ago to see that mighty one standing there who stood since i was a little boy and talked i'm not a fanatic you know that but it's to fulfill the scriptures i think this church ought to know truth and the sign where we're at that you don't want to be slothful that you'll be up and doing know the differences will be settled and you'll walk like real godly men and women our hearts sit on christ and don't look into these paltry things of the earth because it's of the devil all these quarrels and wars and strifes and different look away from them we're at the end and remember we may not have another week to do it in i don't know only god knows we're here at the end there was noah in his time here's israel in their time here's abraham at the next junction between the world and the natural and the supernatural he had visitation god would visit him regularly hallelujah on his walk with god god would visit him and he'd have conferences with his son and he began to tell him things and you know begin to make the promise more real to him isn't it the same thing with you and i where the word just becomes more alive and more alive and more real hallelujah it's no longer an abstract idea but it's more of a reality hallelujah and we know ultimately abraham's body got changed hallelujah the next junction between the world the natural and the supernatural angels came down that looked like men glory and stood by abraham the prophet told him abraham god will perform the supernatural about this time next year according to life i'll visit you your wife 100 years old and you'll bring forth a child i'll show you my power of divine healing i'll change you and turn you back to a young man again i'll change sarah and make her a different person and make her a young woman i'm the miraculous i'm the omnipotent i do the miraculous amen i'll show you my power abraham we're at the junction and that's what he's trying to tell us tonight i'll show you my power bright how am i going to change your bodies in a moment in a twinkling of an eye hallelujah take you from this world to the next amen the evil spirits were down in sodom yes they're working among the world down here down there they're working here today gaity glamour and crack wall jokes and all the dirty things on radio television not even censored or nothing else and perverting sometimes the gospel to a social affair the whole world has become perverted but at the same time the world has become perverted the believers have become converted in the lord and the power of god by the working and appearing of omnipotence how that god and his mercy is showing forth these things hallelujah so we're going to recognize you know we're at a special time remember it's god's doing that's not the believers doing it's god's doing i mean just like we read that opening scripture in ephesians where he broke down that middle wall of partition you know since since since the you know since adam and eve were kicked out of the garden man was calling on the name of the lord when shall you restore as i said in the beginning it's not it's not necessary when we call it's when god does something hallelujah when he begins to reach down and deal with people i mean that's a supernatural thing amen that god would god would bridge that great chasm what a great chasm that was when when adam and eve fell you know they're walking in perfect faith before the fall there's never a problem never require never a sickness never a bad day amen never a demon oppressing them never trouble never sickness never death and god would just walk with them in perfect unity but then sin made such a great big chasm amen that that adam could only walk with a memory of what it was like to be a god over the earth hallelujah and then he would be in that kind of way and that call upon god god when will you restore these things this great big chasm and you know god would allow the blood of bulls and goats to kind of kind of you know bridge that chasm to a certain degree but it wasn't the same as in the garden but then when the blood of jesus christ came our prophet tells us that he didn't just bridge the chasm he took the chasm away hallelujah there's no longer a chasm the chasm's gone amen if the blood of jesus christ has fallen upon you change your soul i have brought you to a birth amen there's no more chasm between you and god it's done away with hallelujah it's gone there's no chasm there's no it's not there hallelujah imagine standing i've never been to the grand canyon but i imagine it'd be quite a sight but imagine standing at the grand canyon how do you get across then someone comes along and just pours the right amount of dirt in the whole thing and it's flat and you can just walk right across hallelujah that's kind of what the blood's done amen that that that grand canyon that that that sin created it's gone it's gone amen the blood puts us back on speaking terms with our father with our bridegroom hallelujah amen so man would call out when when will you restore these things and under the blood of bulls and goats sin was just covered it wasn't annihilated but then when the blood of jesus christ came amen brother brahm says it's like a bleach i'd sin is like a but yeah a bit of bank you drop into the bleach you can't find that you can't find that ink no more it's gone it's the same thing with with confessed sin when it's confessed sincerely amen from a repentant heart amen it's like it drops into the blood of jesus christ and it's gone and god don't remember it no more hallelujah so now one time we're on the wrong side of the chasm but now the chasm's gone remember it's god that reaches we weren't looking for him he was looking for you hallelujah he's looking for you heaven was reaching through where's my son where's my daughter i'm gonna find him and he did he doesn't he doesn't say it's too hard to find them he knows where we are hallelujah he knows where you are even tonight he knows where you are hallelujah amen so now now the believer is on the the chasm's gone and now heaven and earth can be united once again amen adam's fallen race in heaven are united once again you say oh but we need to be in a millennium to have that kind of fellowship with god oh no oh no right now remember god is proving to the devil it doesn't matter what you did in the beginning amen i'm gonna have perfect fellowship with my children even though they're in fallen bodies i will still walk with them like i want to walk with them amen there is no hindrance now the moving of the holy ghost oh there's no hindrance no more i mean there's no creeds there's no dogmas there's no trouble there's no hardship there's nothing that can stop them moving amen but if we just all we got to do is just stay surrendered yielded vessel hallelujah so because sometimes we say well i feel so far away from god and he's right there hallelujah he seems so far away he's right there remember we're not going to go on a rapture because we feel it hallelujah it's because we believe it remember faith goes beyond feeling amen your faith brings feeling but feeling is not necessarily faith or oh you're feeling down well that's fine it'll pass hallelujah it doesn't it doesn't unseal you doesn't take away your salvation amen but we're at a dispensational change now where god would where where heaven would expand once again hallelujah through the dark ages it's like it kind of withdrew and away even though god was present upon the earth but not in the magnitude that he was with the first church but now he's restored again hallelujah what was the you know brother brahms testimony that went round the world an angel met this man he had a visitation of an angel and he didn't just say it visit him in a cave it would come night after night meeting after meeting at the platform hallelujah as i you know uh you know as i shared after we came back from south africa you know brother brother willie rateef who who drove brother brown round in the johannesburg area he said when that presence came down and he got tears in his eyes he said if people ever stood in that presence they would never doubt this message and then when we went down to cape town and we were standing outside the drill hall by the town hall in cape town there if anyone's ever who's been there and there's a castle of good hope right over there there's that big open area and brother dale adams stood and he told us how there was a woman she was a young just a teenager there when brother brown was preaching there and and all she remembers him saying after people were preaching all day and she couldn't get in the hall where the prophet was preaching she was outside with thousands of people and she couldn't you know all she remembers brother i'm saying was good evening friends and after he said that the she said the anointing fell on the whole whole crowd and people just were supernaturally healed spontaneously what a visitation you say if only i lived back in that day no the same god is here the same god is present i mean that same jesus is here we don't have to go back in time or listen to a tape and say i wish i was back in that kind of meeting no you could have that kind of meaning right now you could walk with that god right now hallelujah amen because the prophet's ministry was to show us that jesus christ is the same yesterday today and forever right it was to demonstrate this is what the power of the blood does that's what god showed this is what my cross is to achieve that a man would stand as a redeemed son and take every spirit under his control for the glory of god and nothing could stand before his prayers not even cancer hallelujah no sickness no devil nothing all of it had to bow his feet because he was a redeemed son washed in the blood of the lamb oh that's the prophet what about the bride what about a people that are redeemed by the same blood that have the same holy ghost hallelujah amen so angels would visit hallelujah we say well that's that's that's back then you can have visitation of angels in your home that's right you can have you can have angels come visit your home you can have the lord walk through your front door he doesn't need to open he just walks through it i don't mean that as a joke but he can step in there his present can step into your home i remember when brother john anders was preaching that first youth without borders the third one's coming up by the way watch it register be part of it and and he would say you know you can invite the angel lord into your house and and he was giving testimony brother brown said that a couple of women who who knew each other neighborhood one had a big goat had the other one had something else i can't remember and they came up and got prayed for by the prophet and and he just told them no you just go keep believing i think about a month after that the angel lord visited their neighborhood and and one of them who couldn't eat anything really at all she just eaten just throw up and lots of ass and stuff come out and things she just felt something just just like a cool also or hot feeling just come over her she got hungry who knows the story yeah and then and then and then she begins to eat eats the children's leftover breakfast or that set really well then she made pancakes whatever coffee just ate you know and realized there's nothing wrong with me and she runs down to where her neighbor was and she found her neighbor shaking the sheets out trying to find something and she said it's left my body i know tumor or whatever it was and what happened the angel lord visited her and then visited her friend and then he said you can have that same kind of visitation so what did we do we said lord jesus come to 138 george street stokes valley please holy and the prince of god came down into the house hallelujah we can still have visitation amen hallelujah why because that's what our god loves to do he loves to visit his children hallelujah amen hallelujah now the unseen is influencing the scene realm right now jesus would say in john 14 if you want to put that up john john 14 1 john 14 1. do not let your hearts be troubled you believe in god believe also in me in my father's house of many mansions keep going next yeah in my father's house no can we go back go back to two in my father's house are many mansions if we're not so i would have told you i did i go to prepare a place for you next verse and if i go and prepare a place for you i will come again i'll come again and we'll receive you unto myself that where i am there you may be also right so he's saying i'm gonna go prepare a place and if i do i'm gonna come get you that where i am you'll be also now we know his body is up in heaven right his spirit's upon the earth but his body is up in heaven right and when the when the living and the dead saints are translated to that next dimension we're going to meet them halfway right we're going to meet the lord in the air right but right now the spirit lord is upon the earth to fulfill that scripture that where i am not where you are not not in these five senses not in this dimension but in that other dimension where i am you will be also i will i mean can you put that back oh i'll just turn to it he says he says and he says i will go and prepare a place for you verse 3 i will come again and receive you unto myself that where i am there you may be also she says i'm going to basically reach down into this realm i'm going to get a hold of you and i'm going to pull you into that next realm hallelujah remember it's not us trying to step into that dimension it's god reaching through and i wish i could demonstrate it better than this by the from the unseen into the scene i'm going to get a hold of your lives hallelujah i'm going to i'm going to guide you by my voice hallelujah and you're going to walk with me and there's going to come a time where you will be not because i've taken you hallelujah that's a promise amen and and this is what we're looking at here in this part of part of redemption because remember jesus purchased our salvation on calvary but then he's got to come and claim hallelujah what he purchased amen and we know this is symbolized in revelations 4 and 5 of the taking of the book amen so now here so so here we are and this is why it's so amazing remember this is not a teaching this has got to be experienced where heaven comes and touches you where the unseen touches you because you think about what what made us become believers it wasn't our mental state it wasn't our five senses it wasn't it because it it wasn't because it sounded reasonable it wasn't because it was a good idea at the time we had a lot of good ideas at the time but they're always bad you know it wasn't because of that it knows because god reached through and got a hold of you and turned your heart around when you weren't looking for him he found you yes sir hallelujah what's happening it's actually eternity bumping into you brother brown uses this term bumping he says he says now the only thing you do when you die you just change those five senses you just receive another sense and you're alive with a higher sense thousands of times higher than this in another life a life where there's no death where there's no sorrow and the things that you don't know nothing about now nothing about now sorry i can read and you're alive with higher senses thousands of times higher than this in another life a life where there's no death where there's no sorrow and the things that you don't know nothing about now you see it plainly when you cross there you don't understand it now because you're bumping into it you haven't got that sense as you say i feel a strange feeling here tonight looks to me like i just want to cry or shout or something it's the angels of the lord see that's what makes us feel that way it's not our own excitement it's not our own you know happiness it's god it's the angels of the lord bumping into you hallelujah remember the reason he says that i i will come again and receive you unto myself he says i go to prepare a place for you hallelujah so already now now brother brown tells us and things that are to be he's not talking about a physical building like like wood and stone and stuff right he's talking about bodies he's talking about bodies and we know in an eternal realm we have one waiting in the heaven right so the reason that heaven bumps into you right is because you have a body to step into hallelujah and it's going to come a time where it just bumps into you your eternity whatever the camp eternity bumped into us hallelujah and i pray even tonight eternity's bumping into you making your heart be stirred hallelujah and yo awakening you to the reality we're not in this battle alone hallelujah but there'll come a timer is just bumping bumping and then finally it'll slow down we'll speed up it won't be just be a bumpy it's going to carry us away hallelujah yes sir hallelujah that's right that's exactly what's going to happen hallelujah it just won't just be a one-off thing it's going to be closer and closer then boom and we're gone hallelujah certainly he lives there's brother brown again what's this but what's this you're bumping into all the time what's that condemns you when you're wrong what's that that makes you believe that's him he says you might not be able to open your eyes and see him because he's in spirit form the invisible god but he dwells among invisible people making himself visible by his promised word in that people do you understand that now yes hallelujah you know he would he would give the analogy it's like a blind man who goes out into the under under the sun and he's never seen the sun before he's blind never seen it before but he feels the sun rays and especially in this country you feel it really good because the ozone layer is gone or something you know thank you other nations for those anyway you know you can feel the sun rise that bites you yeah i trust you go outside sometimes you know a lot of time i'm at work you know in a lab gown in a sealed lab i just look out and see the sunshine looks kind of nice and then you walk out the front door and it's raining you think how did this happen but anyway you know oh boy but you know it's there but if i walked outside i'd feel the rays of the sun amen he says it's like a blind man that you know never felt the sun before be but but if he went outside he'd say it's out of someone who can see i feel this all over me but i don't know what it is what's causing this what's making me feel this way what's making me feel this way and the person who could see well say that's the sun that's the sun and then and then maybe he'd try to describe it yes like a ball of fire in the sky and it comes up at a certain time goes down at a certain time and it gives life to the earth and you know you're trying to explain it that way and he says it's the same thing with god amen those like the prophet he'd say can't you see that light hanging over that person not everyone could see it but they could feel his presence hallelujah and just like god you know we may not see the pillar of fire but we feel the rays of the of the son light i mean we feel his presence oh just like when we were at camp and god came down in a powerful way or when we have services here what's happened god steps into the room holy the pillar of fire comes into the room amen that same one that moses met same one that paul met hardly the same one that the prophet meant i mean the very same god of the bible steps into the room hallelujah we may not see him here but we feel his race amen we feel the sunlight hallelujah hallelujah amen i'm so thankful it's that way that we feel his presence what is it eternity bumping into you ever been bumped into by something oh what was that hallelujah and sometimes you say why do i feel this way are we people who anyone who's emotionally detached i can see you in the office we can pray we can talk about these things but you know what makes us feel this way it's god it's god in this in this junction of time hallelujah we're you know we just go back even just over a hundred years ago before the azusa street move there wasn't a lot of supernatural going on but it was great proliferation of gifts and you know the manifestations of the spirit why because god was going to bring his second part of redemption hallelujah as the same thing even now i'd say there's still god still lives right we don't have to be historians wishing we live back there the same god lives now how the same god does the same things now i say an even a greater measure hallelujah is it not is it we get anointed by the spirit you know some people are afraid of the anointing and i'll just say this i heard i think it was brother tim pruitt said i think he can stand quoting you know the anointing is just like the rain the rain isn't made for the weeds right it's not made for the tears it's made for the wheat right the anointing is made for the children of god it doesn't matter what other people do with it it doesn't discount it's made for us hallelujah the anointing is for the bride i mean to bring us that the word will be manifested in our lives in a greater portion amen hallelujah so we shouldn't be afraid of the anointing we should expect it we should be living for it that god would take this word and make it live in our lives hallelujah amen so here we are the angels of god are in this room god is present he says with two or three gathered in my name there i am in the midst yes hallelujah that we're not alone in this battle you know we may think the world well the world is falling apart but we don't need to get worried about it we don't do we need to get stressed about it i mean because it says as as daniel michael the great prince will stand up for thy people in this day in a time of trouble amen you know many times we will look and we will say well the world is just basically it's hell upon the earth and we know based from revelations 9 that hell has emptied itself upon the earth right everything even even little children's toys have been designed to desensitize people to demon possession right you even take lego these days who's in the lego where you get your phone and it's um augmented reality and you can catch ghosts it's all it's it's conditioning people and skulls and death and everything it's all black and zombies and all this stuff what is it it's the conditioner generation to that they get used to demons running rampant yeah and we can say oh isn't that a horrible thing it is a horrible thing but then the thing is when john saw the bottomless pit open he says in revelations 10 and 1 and i saw another mighty angel come down from heaven i mean so he saw hell come up but heaven come down hallelujah so now we must understand that now that is christ in angelic form right in a rainbow about his head is a covenant angel that that is christ hallelujah so now now when hell opens up now so there's a dimension merging with this one right there's also heaven coming down and merging with this dimension i mean so we're not alone in this battle i mean but the mighty angel himself has come down into the end time hallelujah and he's putting his foot on the sea in the land where those demon powers come up and he's holding them at bay hallelujah until his bride gets into her position that she takes the book eats the book and prophesies again hallelujah so we don't need to worry about anything really amen because our god is in control hallelujah you say well i'm just fumbling through life no no eternity's bumping into you amen it is bumping into you guiding you how do you say what caused me to be a believer eternity bumped into you it wasn't you saying i'm going to try again eternity bumped into you i mean when you wanted to quit eternity said no you're not going to quit our lord jesus says you ain't quitting boy you're getting up you're gonna keep walking hallelujah you know brother james and sorry brother james if you're watching but he wanted to preach tonight about don't give up we shouldn't give up maybe i'll leave that for him but let's not give up well you know it seems like there's such a yeah like the veil between this world mix is getting so thin hallelujah it's getting so thin so don't give up god's here to fight our battles he's here to look after us and we should expect visitations of angels well how do you know they're real angels you know a devil is just a fallen angel all the angels had a choice will they listen to what lucifer says or they listen to god they actually were put on free moral agency to choose right and some of them list decided to choose lucifer as their king and they fell right and some said no we're not going to listen to the devil's lie and they remained right i mean so now at an angel that's fallen becomes a demon right so depression is just a fallen angel right anxiety is just a fallen angel suicidal thoughts just a fallen angel hatred is just a fallen angel right it's just fallen angels trying to influence a sane world are you following me tonight i miss all and as you say people get so moody and angry and do you know they want to withdraw themselves and you know what is that that's a demon inspiration trying to trying to ward off someone i wouldn't listen to that kind of stuff i'd say satan get behind me you may want to feel like you want to end it all you better feel like you just want to quit that's the devil trying to anointing your feelings but i just denied in the name of jesus christ saying satan eternity's bumped into me and you're too late and i am not making the same choice you may you made a choice are you going to stand against god i'm not making your choice i've picked a side you've picked a side and that's it hallelujah amen brother brown says i think it is and who is this melchizedek he says then after he recognized the very word of god was eagle food then you left the other thing you have been formed into the living image of the living god you heard from your theophany if this earthly body be dissolved we have one waiting i mean so when the work when this message comes alive to you more than doctrine more than a nice idea it becomes a living reality what's happened you've heard from your theophany i don't know why i'm doing this it's just punched the devil a few times hallelujah but we've heard from our theophany so now so if this is quicker than me if this word is quick in me what's god telling me i have a body it's it's there amen i don't know it's maybe this size maybe not you know what i mean but i have i have a body waiting in the heavens and this message is to line me up with my theophany i mean so as we walk with god we become more the spirit man becomes more like that image and there'll come a time where the image in me will match that image and they'll merge together hallelujah and this is where we're walking you know i think it was brother freddie said you know about the holy ghost in us it's not a little button no more hallelujah do you remember camp who remembers camp he made a statement he said he said we know when the holy ghost comes in brother it says like a small button the size of a white button he says it's not that size anymore it's grown up it's pushed out harley pushed out the malice and the strife and the envy and the unforgiveness and the bitterness and the gospel and the whatever and the and the and the flesh you know it's all been pushed out so i said now now it's not a little bit no more but it's beginning to match amen my eternal representation hallelujah this is where we are hallelujah so there's going to come a time and it'd be quite cool if i didn't have to walk out these doors where the veil between this world and the next world it's just rent i'm just dramatizing it and we're and we just it's like you just walk through a hole in the and i'm not here anymore hallelujah hallelujah this is why heaven's bumping into you this is why the lord doesn't want us just to stay and be stale and stagnant and indifferent he keeps bumping into us saying come on come on sweetheart hallelujah you've heard my voice i gave my life for you i bridged the chasm for you i washed all your sins away hallelujah you're going to make it we're going to make it hallelujah i don't care if no one else is excited about that i'm going to make it amazing jesus said i'm going to make it if jesus said i'm going to make it i'm going to make it holy i'm going all the way hallelujah amen hallelujah we're going to make it brother armand hallelujah hallelujah we're on our way what's happening heaven's bumping into us and then it's not just going to be a bump no more it's going to be a permanent impact it's going to embrace us and carry us away hallelujah hallelujah amen you know the bible says that the angel of the lord is encamped about those who fear him and he delivereth them hallelujah you say well i don't feel the lord around me all the time well the bible says he's encamped you get up he's encamped around you and you go to work and he's encamped around you and you go to school he's encamped around you go down to dunedin he's camped around you holly wherever you go he's encamped around you hallelujah the angel lord is there he say well and then and then sometimes we just get so caught up in the i just don't feel like a christian today and the very god of heaven is encamped around us hallelujah because he knew that you would choose him before the foundational world he knew you would how he knew that you would turn down the devil's lie and he knew that you would follow him and that's why he predestined you unto the adoption of sons hallelujah glory holy he's encamped around he said well god's so far away no the apostle paul would tell the athenians he's not far from any one of us hallelujah hallelujah so don't let the devil ever try and get you think that you're an orphan child and god doesn't care he cares he cares for you and i he's very interested in your life every single part of your life he's very interested in you he cares about how you feel he cares about if you're happy if you're sad he cares about what you're going through the troubles you face he cares hello he bore our yo he took our sorrows he knows what it's like to be rejected he knows what it's like to be made fun of he knows what it's like to be bullied amen he knows what it's like to be rejected he knows what it's like to be murdered amen he knows what it's like to be misunderstood by his own family hallelujah he knows he knows what it's like he understands yes hallelujah but i'll say that heaven i think we've we're gonna go into prayer but all that heaven is is in the earth right now brother brown when he went beyond the curtain of time he says heaven was just like above the door frame it wasn't up somewhere far away you got to get in a you know i think it was the voyager or voyager one and two two two two spacecraft that have gone i think out of the solar system by now i know how many years it's took them and they haven't you know and they're still going and people think well heaven must be so far away and it's just here in a in a faster dimension it's right here hallelujah it's not far it's just in another dimension going faster than this one hallelujah you know and the lord is right here he's closer than your next breath well he says where two or three gathered in my name there i am in the mid so he's between me and you analysts he's been you and me lilia hallelujah he's between you and the person sitting next to you he's in our midst he's he's he's between us here he is in this room hallelujah all that heaven is comes down into this place i happen to believe that you say that's a very bold statement no no all that heaviness comes into this place and when you go to your house and you pray heaven comes down you drive in the car heaven comes into the car hallelujah i need more than a seven seater don't worry about that kind of thing oh you have angels around your car they go with you amen when when you're in a crossroads you don't know which decision to make heaven just bumps into you and y'all i'll do this way then you follow the lord's leading hardly he guides us he's our shepherd amen he's our god he's our advocate he's our all in all he's our captain amen hallelujah maybe i'll get into it on sunday but with joshua you know i so love it you know when when the captain of the host of the lord came to joshua joshua draws the sword of euphoria against it says neither but i come as the captain of the host of the lord now remember that him coming down wasn't just to take jericho that was for the whole campaign where the angel lord came down for the whole campaign it wasn't just to take jericho as the same thing when god comes down and takes over your life because you give it to him hallelujah it's not just for one battle the next battle it's until the body change how that he has come to take over and he'll lead us and guide us amen hallelujah whole campaign what's he saying i'm going to see this through i'm not going to withdraw i'm not going to call an armistice i'm going all the way. this is total war against the devil hallelujah hallelujah heaven is present you say if only i could speak to jesus and he's right here if only i could have a minute of his time and he's right here if only i could push through all the masses of people go back two thousand years and maybe push through the massive people maybe speak to andrew maybe he was the outer kind of disciple and say i need to get to jesus i need to see him and you get led and then there's peter or john the inner circle and you say please can i just have one minute one minute with jesus and then finally you get to stand in this prayers he said what a what an opportunity that would have been friends we don't have to push through a bunch of people talk to some disciples and speak to him he's not at a single geographical location we can be standing in the same presence as the prince of the messiah and he's alive oh if only i just have one minute what would i say to him you can have a minute every day of your life every minute of every day you can be in his presence you can talk to him and tell him the things of your heart and things you're worried about that your concerns and you know things of life and your struggles and hallelujah isn't that right that's exactly right well finally i could find where he's at he's here our lord jesus is here amen heaven has expanded upon the earth brother ram uses those words the expansion of heaven or heaven expanded hallelujah amen it's come down upon the earth to find you and then to guide you through this earthly journey hallelujah he's here are you just you're just like an old record i wish i could emphasize it more if we were just conscious of who was if the law could just maybe change the filter of our eyes and we could see who's here our lives would never be the same i think brother abraham says in one place he says if we could just recognize his presidency there wouldn't be another sick person there wouldn't be anyone sick in the next five minutes hallelujah but as the devil tries to hold us hold us down as i say forget it satan you made your choice i made my choice my choice is not your choice and you can't make my choice your choice what does that mean i chose jesus i'm not changing my mind because he's got a hold of my life hallelujah amen that's other musicians i want to sing he when he reached out his hand for me i was lost and undone what happened heaven reached down do you remember that time when he reached down his hand for you do you remember that time you may be up to hearing religion and then some but then he reached out his hand said child i don't want you in that way i'm going to show you really my mercy hallelujah amen and then we're going to go on to prayer we're just going to pray all together amen this this song is my this song is my testimony i was wretched and blind as could be but my savior in love gave me peace from above when he reached down his hand for me amy what key should this be in brother isaac [Music] we'll go g amen once my soul was a stray from the heavenly way i was wretched and blind as could be but my savior gave me peace from above when he reached down his hand for me oh thank you lord oh when he reached down his hand for me oh yes when he reached down his head for me [Music] i was lost and undone without god or his son when he reached down his head for me [Music] oh now my heart does rejoice or does when i

all harm when he reached down his head for me oh yes lord jesus oh when he reached down his head for me [Music] when he reached down his head for me i was lost and done without god or his son when he read down his hand for me [Music] hallelujah almighty god [Music] oh lord jesus amen let's just actually sing one more song once my heart and soul was faded by the binding chains of sin hallelujah but then the searching shepherd found me amen oh once my heart and soul was fair better oh by the binding chains [Music] he said me free to worship him o glory glory [Music] hallelujah blessed be his holy name hallelujah for he our great emancipation [Music] [Applause] oh like a lost [Music] oh bob the seeking shepherd found yes he found me oh thank you lord he led me to my father's home oh glory glory

lord for finding us o god upon the earth lord i just want to pray lord that you would have your way lord jesus lord if we could just say into the unseen realm lord let's think about lord hell father

years of salvation my god the lord i just pray father may we see that this lord that you're just in that next dimension lord you're not far from any one of us lord jesus lord you're not far away

individuals my lord father may we discern and withstand him my god father may the devil not be able to hide in any way lord jesus may he not lord be able to try and get us to think that what what he's
