[6:14] amen through his holy spirit just guide
[6:16] us protect us I listened to a sermon of
[6:20] Chad Lamb kind of touched us a lot this
[6:22] week where he he just spoke about how
[6:25] the world Satan just tries to get into
[6:28] the church and really just influence the
[6:30] church and everything they do and and
[6:32] how our fight is not just a normal fight
[6:34] we have to absolutely take every thought
[6:36] and captivity discern every situation
[6:39] and just take it up to the Lord first
[6:42] you know and stay by the word and stay
[6:43] by the message and and it's wonderful
[6:46] because it puts the stabilizers on and
[6:47] know that you know there's there's
[6:50] people like brother Ben that just looks
[6:51] out for us you know and and the word
[6:53] that comes over the pulpit is just to
[6:55] help us and to strengthen us but we
[6:57] still have to find the Lord in the Bible
[6:59] we still have to go to his word you know
[7:01] so it's just wonderful where he is I

[18:21] just think both of them amen it's good
[18:23] to have Brother Joseph here too God
[18:24] bless you
[18:26] welcome amen if um just like you you got
[18:28] your Bibles handy let's just go to
[18:32] um go to the Book of Revelation chapter
[18:42] 13 just want to read one verse
[18:47] here it's Revelations 13 and: 8 I want
[18:52] to um let's just read the word and we'll
[18:55] we'll go into our
[18:57] study the speaking of the
[19:02] Beast and all that dwell upon the Earth
[19:05] shall worship Him whose names are not
[19:08] written in the book of of life of the
[19:10] lamb slain from the foundation of the
[19:13] world if any man have an ear let him
[19:16] hear amen may the Lord bless his word
[19:18] you may be seated now I want to you know
[19:21] last Wednesday we uh went into a bit of
[19:23] a Bible study about walking in the light
[19:25] and I want to um I want to continue
[19:28] continue on our on our just our bit of a
[19:30] study here about what is what is
[19:33] happening in this end time because we
[19:35] understand that there's so many things
[19:36] have happened in this day and it's very
[19:39] important that we recognize what's
[19:40] happened in this day because you know
[19:43] just just the scripture alone that we
[19:45] read You Know There's 7 billion people
[19:47] upon the
[19:49] Earth and it says all that dwell upon
[19:51] the Earth shall worship Him whose names
[19:53] are not written in the Book of Life of
[19:55] the lamb slain from the foundation of
[19:56] the world so that's it's a lot of
[19:59] people and then but then you may
[20:01] probably think well how can it be so
[20:04] because people are not the whole world
[20:06] is not Satanist or outwardly Satanist
[20:10] you know there's all these Christian
[20:11] churches there's all kinds of religions
[20:13] so how is it that you know all would
[20:16] worship Him whose name is not written in
[20:18] the Lamb's Book of Life and we're just
[20:20] going to go into this a little bit just
[20:22] to just see how the Lord leads uh
[20:24] because this is the this is the age
[20:27] where Satan is enthroned as God of this
[20:31] world Amen so I just want to um let's
[20:33] just go to Genesis we're going to go to
[20:36] the start of Genesis and we'll just see
[20:37] how we how we how this leads but um I
[20:40] want to show you that it's it's very
[20:42] simple and brother Brandon makes a very
[20:44] simple statement he says anything that
[20:46] is against the word is
[20:48] Antichrist amen he just very simple
[20:51] anything against the word is
[20:54] Antichrist amen so if anything is is
[20:58] against what the Bible is teaching it is
[21:01] against God even though it may use
[21:04] scripture it may say Jesus died on the
[21:07] cross for you it may use crosses it may
[21:09] all the terminology we speak about
[21:11] Redemption and the blood and you know
[21:13] all the you know they it it may use all
[21:16] those terminologies but anything that is
[21:18] against the word is
[21:20] Antichrist okay so I just want to show
[21:24] you this um this principle if we go to
[21:27] Genesis chapter
[21:29] 3 I know this is very familiar but I
[21:31] just want to show you because if we can
[21:33] see how the devil Works Through the
[21:35] Bible you can see what he's doing today
[21:37] CU he is a he is a creature of habit
[21:39] that's right you know he doesn't he
[21:41] doesn't actually there's nothing new
[21:42] Under the Sun it may change what it
[21:45] looks like but it's the same thing so
[21:47] we're going to so we go to Genesis
[21:48] chapter 3 and we'll go to verse one now
[21:52] the serpent was more subtle than any
[21:53] beast of the field which the Lord God
[21:55] had made and he said unto the woman yay
[21:58] hath God said You shall not eat of every
[22:01] tree of the garden and the woman said
[22:04] unto the serpent we may eat of the fruit
[22:06] of the Trees of the garden but of the
[22:08] fruit of the tree which is in the midst
[22:10] of the garden God has said ye shall not
[22:12] eat of it neither shall ye touch it
[22:16] least ye die and the serpent said unto
[22:19] the woman you shall not surely die for
[22:22] God doth know then the day that you eat
[22:24] thereof then your eyes shall be opened
[22:26] and you shall be as God's knowing good
[22:29] and
[22:30] evil
[22:31] now how how how how how the devil used
[22:35] the serpent now to attack to attack Eve
[22:39] is the same way he attacks you it's the
[22:42] same way he attacks the church it's the
[22:44] same way he you know the same the same
[22:46] way and simply what he did is he made he
[22:50] made Eve believe a lie which was 99%
[22:55] truth and it took her out of the
[22:58] protection of the truth of God's word
[23:00] because God simply said to them if you
[23:02] if you eat of this tree that day you'll
[23:04] die so therefore don't eat of that tree
[23:07] don't partake of that tree and you'll be
[23:09] fine that's all they had to do but then
[23:12] so so the devil was able to punch
[23:14] through that protection and get her to
[23:17] believe 99% truth but it was just just
[23:21] that mising of that one word caused all
[23:24] of this Calamity that we see around us
[23:26] as the the world was fallen so what so
[23:30] what he did now is he as he bypassed he
[23:35] he he he he didn't speak to Adam about
[23:37] this but he went straight to the woman
[23:39] so he went straight to the
[23:40] church amen he didn't he didn't go and
[23:43] you know he didn't go and speak to Adam
[23:45] and then Eve didn't go speak to Adam
[23:47] about it she just took what he said
[23:49] because it sounded scriptural yep so she
[23:51] didn't say well what does the Bible say
[23:53] about it or you say what does the
[23:55] message say she just took what he said
[23:57] because it sounded
[23:58] very cuz he was using he was using Bible
[24:01] terms eating of the tree being as God's
[24:05] you know they already were gods they had
[24:08] dominion over the Earth amen yep they
[24:10] had Dominion so what she was promising
[24:13] what he was promising her was actually
[24:15] they already were
[24:17] gods and but then but what he did was
[24:22] you know it's very simple she got he got
[24:25] her to step out of what the Bible said
[24:28] and to believe a lie and that's what
[24:31] caused the fall cuz it had to actually
[24:33] she had to agree with it first in her
[24:35] mind and then the Act was done I mean so
[24:38] sin was you know first it was sin is
[24:40] always conceived in the mind first and
[24:43] then you then the person has to agree
[24:46] with what's in the mind and then they go
[24:47] do it amen yeah and and then you can
[24:49] take that every facet of life it has to
[24:52] be agreed with in the mind and then then
[24:54] the person agrees with it then they go
[24:56] do it yeah
[24:58] so you know you can take that into
[25:00] anything that's you know anything that
[25:03] that's
[25:04] wrong amen and and and and that's the
[25:08] principle he will come and reason
[25:10] because he said y hath God said did he
[25:13] really say that did he really mean what
[25:15] he said you know so so he came with
[25:19] reasoning now I'm going slow cuz I want
[25:20] to go slow cuz I really if you can catch
[25:23] what the devil does here you'll sure
[25:25] catch what he tries to do to you yep so
[25:29] so he came with reasoning did God really
[25:32] say that that's what yeath God Said
[25:34] means did he really say that are you
[25:36] sure he really said what he said are you
[25:38] sure that that's actually chapter and
[25:39] verse what he meant and so but then we
[25:43] see what happens is now the woman
[25:47] actually she begin to actually believe
[25:50] the devil's lie because what what Satan
[25:54] did and this is what he comes and always
[25:56] does is remember in Genesis chapter 1 it
[25:59] says God made heavens and the Earth but
[26:01] then when man begins to come into the
[26:03] picture it says and the Lord God made
[26:06] now we read this and we just think well
[26:08] it's God and and it is God but those
[26:10] English words there's a reason it's
[26:12] written that way and so Capital you know
[26:16] Capital God that just means Elohim or
[26:19] the self-existing one so just something
[26:22] that self exists but then the Lord God
[26:25] is actually is is Jehovah God the one
[26:28] who expresses himself or the one who has
[26:31] relationship with that's what it means
[26:34] so he was a self-existing one but then
[26:37] now he put his children upon the Earth
[26:39] and then he changed now and now he was
[26:41] the Lord God that had
[26:43] relationship amen he want you know he is
[26:45] having relationship with his children
[26:47] and then so the serpent comes along and
[26:49] she and he actually takes Eve back to
[26:51] what God was in I'd say a previous time
[26:54] because he wasn't just a self-existing
[26:56] one anymore he was the one who has
[26:58] relationship he's a God who expresses
[27:00] himself so the serpent took Eve back to
[27:04] what God used to
[27:05] be yeah and then so the devil will come
[27:09] along to you and he'll say no no God is
[27:12] how he was maybe 2,000 years ago he's
[27:14] just a god of
[27:15] History amen he's not a god of today
[27:18] he's just a god of History he's just a
[27:20] god of
[27:21] 1965 or he's just a god of when you
[27:24] first met him sometime he's not the same
[27:26] today he'll come and use the same tactic
[27:29] against you oh he's just a god of my
[27:32] parents because they met him back
[27:33] sometime that's what he'll do he'll try
[27:36] and get you to believe he's not the same
[27:38] today as he was yesterday and shall be
[27:41] forever amen and and that's exactly what
[27:44] the serpent did and so she believed that
[27:48] now God was just this big self-existing
[27:51] one who was some distant God someplace
[27:54] and then he just
[27:56] misconstrued that that word to her
[27:59] because if if she really said no the
[28:01] Lord God had said this then maybe the
[28:04] devil would have got a bit scared
[28:06] because if it's the Lord God it means
[28:08] I'm actually in relationship with him I
[28:10] mean he's not some distant God somewhere
[28:12] actually no maybe I'll just asking
[28:14] myself that's right amen but she
[28:17] actually
[28:18] believed the kind of God that the
[28:20] serpent was
[28:22] preaching yeah so it wasn't actually the
[28:26] first one upon the Earth that wasn't God
[28:28] that preached was actually the
[28:31] serpent
[28:32] amen yeah yeah you've probably this is
[28:34] probably very elentary but I just want
[28:36] you to see he preached the word first to
[28:38] Eve there's no record of you know they
[28:40] would Adam and Eve would have had
[28:41] Fellowship about it but there's no
[28:43] record of actually Adam preaching to eve
[28:47] even though he probably would have but
[28:48] you see it's recorded in the scripture
[28:50] the serpent came along and preached the
[28:51] first
[28:52] sermon yeah is this okay you understand
[28:56] he came along this said this is what the
[28:58] word
[28:59] means and instead of her going well
[29:01] maybe I should read the Bible about and
[29:03] actually just wait cuz it says they that
[29:05] wait upon the Lord don't be Hasting in
[29:07] just grabbing something just just wait
[29:09] upon Him amen if the you know you if if
[29:12] if anything's presented in life wait
[29:14] upon the Lord amen nothing there's
[29:18] nothing wrong with being a bit slow
[29:20] about things when it comes to the things
[29:21] of the Lord amen where where something
[29:23] comes in life and directions want to be
[29:25] changed just wait upon him don't be
[29:27] Hasty and grab it just wait amen and
[29:31] then so now
[29:34] she so that's how the devil got
[29:38] her
[29:40] yeah and then
[29:43] now if we
[29:47] continue
[29:49] to let's just go to Genesis chapter
[29:52] 4 and then we're going to go to a 11 and
[29:55] then we're going to go jump into the
[29:56] Book of Revelation
[30:00] now Genesis chapter 4 we won't read it
[30:02] but to save time there's can and abble
[30:06] and there's the pro you know and it says
[30:08] that you
[30:09] know um you know there came the time
[30:13] that that that that you know Abel was a
[30:15] keeper of the sheep and Cain was a
[30:17] tiller of the ground and the process of
[30:19] time it came to pass that Cain brought
[30:22] of the fruit of the ground an offering
[30:23] to the Lord and Abel also brought a
[30:25] firstling of the flock and they and they
[30:26] worshiped
[30:28] you I know you've heard these stories
[30:30] many times but we see now here comes
[30:32] here comes the seed of the serpent now
[30:35] and then the son of son of Adam the Son
[30:37] of God here and they come to worship now
[30:39] they're going to have
[30:40] church and Hebrews 11 says that Abel
[30:43] offered a more excellent sacrifice than
[30:45] that of Cain so Cain's sacrifice was
[30:47] actually very good amen he was sincere
[30:51] he was you know he was
[30:53] dedicated but only Abel had the
[30:55] Revelation that was blood
[30:58] yeah only Abel had that Revelation Cain
[31:00] didn't have that Revelation Cain brought
[31:03] his own ability cuz you know you know
[31:05] you make a garden you know if you have
[31:07] Lambs if you have sheep you don't really
[31:08] need to do a lot with them as long as
[31:10] they've got grass they can just have
[31:12] grass but a garden you got to get the
[31:14] weeds out you got to plant the seed you
[31:16] got to water it you know you got to look
[31:17] after it as it grows and so so Cain
[31:20] brought the efforts of his own
[31:23] ability and then he presented that to
[31:25] God God look at what I I've done look
[31:28] how many Bible verses I've memorized
[31:31] look how many times I go to church look
[31:34] how much I pray list you know you know
[31:37] and those things are all good we should
[31:39] do those things but if you if you bring
[31:42] that to God as some kind of bargaining
[31:43] chip or some brownie Point look I got
[31:45] another badge God you owe me God doesn't
[31:49] ow anything he's a sovereign God it's
[31:52] only in his Mercy does he ever act on
[31:54] our behalf amen amen but but now so so
[31:58] he brought he brought his own abilities
[32:01] and then Abel didn't bring his own
[32:03] abilities he had a revelation that was a
[32:05] lamb in the garden that was killed and
[32:07] the clothed with the Skins then knew it
[32:10] was a blood s in the garden the prophet
[32:11] says and then
[32:13] so so they came with their offerings and
[32:16] God accepted one and God rejected
[32:19] one yeah and this happens in every age
[32:22] all the way down through there's there's
[32:24] the true and the false all the way down
[32:26] through and they both bring an offering
[32:28] they both believe in God Amen they both
[32:32] believe you know Cain genuinely believed
[32:35] in God he was not an atheist he believed
[32:38] in God but he was not his offering was
[32:42] not
[32:43] accepted but it's amazing because when
[32:45] God there's no record of you know in the
[32:47] scripture you read you read Genesis 4
[32:49] there's no record of God ever speaking
[32:50] to Abel but God speaks to Cain because
[32:54] God gives everyone an opportunity anyone
[32:56] who's sincere here the truth will always
[32:58] come across their path amen and it's
[33:01] what they do with it that's up to them
[33:03] that's why you just go fishing and you
[33:06] know and and it's up to them amen and so
[33:09] and we should go fishing amen and so now
[33:12] and so God just says to Cain basically
[33:15] just do what your brother did and you'll
[33:16] be accepted so in other words you don't
[33:18] need to even understand what you're
[33:19] doing just do it yeah but it but it
[33:22] wasn't in him to do it so now what
[33:25] happens is you have Abel here who's
[33:26] accept
[33:27] Cain's rejected and then Cain kills Abel
[33:30] so Cain tries to force his religion upon
[33:33] Abel yeah and because Cain cannot be
[33:36] accepted by giving fruit he has to
[33:38] destroy the true one in order to be hey
[33:41] we're the true
[33:42] church yeah so he enforces his beliefs
[33:45] you must believe it my way and if you
[33:47] don't I'll kill you and he did yeah and
[33:51] then you take that all the way from the
[33:53] garden and then you can bring it all the
[33:56] way we're going to go to the book Book
[33:57] of Revelation and you know and it's all
[33:58] oh no wait let's go to I no I'll just
[34:00] mention it to save time and then and
[34:03] then you and then the next B if we you
[34:05] know but the same time we won't read it
[34:07] is as you see the Tower of Babel that
[34:09] was a forced worship they had to conform
[34:12] they had to worship a certain way so it
[34:15] was now what Cain did but on a massive
[34:17] scale amen you have to we have to build
[34:20] this Tower we have to be one and and
[34:23] they enforce the people to worship this
[34:25] one way which is totally and
[34:28] wrong yep that's a to and then of course
[34:30] we know God confus the
[34:32] languages and
[34:34] um and Scattered the people upon the
[34:37] face of the Earth that's why Babel means
[34:39] a
[34:41] confusion
[34:43] now so that is the principle now the
[34:47] devil tells a lie that sounds like
[34:49] scripture that's right gets you to
[34:51] believe it and it always ends up in
[34:53] death cuz that's what happened the day
[34:55] you of the day you shall die and by
[34:57] believing 99% truth and 1% error it
[35:01] brought death into the human race that's
[35:03] why the prophet says if if if that
[35:06] caused us to fall out of Eden how is 99%
[35:09] truth going to get us back into Eden
[35:11] that's not it takes 100% truth it takes
[35:13] a Vindicator thus sayith the Lord you
[35:16] must worship Him in spirit and in truth
[35:19] yeah and so and then and then and then
[35:22] the Cano kills Abel so the false always
[35:24] persecutes the true to try and destroy
[35:26] the true to say we're the you know to to
[35:28] actually say now we're the true church
[35:30] cuz there's no one else and then you see
[35:33] that you see that's why Jesus said to
[35:34] the scribes and Pharisees he said you
[35:37] garnish the tombs in other words you you
[35:39] build up the tombs you make big
[35:41] memorials and you make you know all
[35:43] kinds of holidays about the prophets
[35:45] that have come down but it says by doing
[35:47] that you prove that you are of your your
[35:50] fathers put them in the tombs cuz they
[35:53] always say well if we're in the days of
[35:55] Moses or Isaiah we would have believed
[35:57] them but but their very actions of of
[35:59] ignoring what God was doing but yet
[36:01] garnishing the tombs of what had
[36:03] happened proved that they were they were
[36:06] not they would not have received that
[36:08] prophet's message if they lived in that
[36:09] day amen y because what happened is the
[36:12] prophet came along and he was now he was
[36:15] like Abel he's saying this is the truth
[36:17] this is the lamb and then the false ones
[36:21] always killed the true because they
[36:23] couldn't take the message that they were
[36:25] preaching am just like Cain could not
[36:27] take Abel's
[36:30] message and then it becomes a force
[36:32] religion that's why in Jesus's day if if
[36:35] anyone went to the meetings of Jesus
[36:37] they would have been kicked out of the
[36:38] synagogue that's why many were secret
[36:40] Believers and so it was now a forcing up
[36:43] you upon the people don't you listen to
[36:45] this man you listen to your priest yeah
[36:49] it was a forced you know you had to
[36:51] either choose be be and remember in in
[36:54] in Jewish Society it's not like New
[36:56] Zealand and how you can just go to
[36:57] church and not go to church and go to
[36:59] this church and disappear it doesn't
[37:00] matter what religion you had if you were
[37:03] kicked out of a synagogue you were
[37:05] ostracized from from the entire
[37:08] Community because the whole village went
[37:10] to the synagogue that's right amen the
[37:13] synagogue was a central you know that
[37:14] worship was a central part of their life
[37:17] yeah so you couldn't just disappear and
[37:19] go change religions you know there's
[37:21] massive and you can even see it in in
[37:23] many societies today like over in the
[37:25] islands you know you can't just you
[37:27] can't just change church this no your
[37:29] village goes to this church you have to
[37:31] go to this one it's a Mass's family
[37:34] pressure yeah it's not like this here
[37:36] but it is over there and that's how it
[37:38] was in the days of Jesus and so there
[37:40] was a force you had to you had to stay
[37:43] in the synagogue you know you had to
[37:45] basically lose all to go follow Jesus
[37:48] it's the same thing today but it's just
[37:51] changed how it
[37:52] operates
[37:54] now that's actually sorry let's go to
[37:59] um um I want to go to actually Daniel
[38:01] chapter
[38:02] 7 and I want to read some scripture and
[38:05] then we'll go back to Revelations
[38:06] chapter
[38:18] 13 now we got a Daniel chapter
[38:21] 7:1 now Daniel with these beasts we're
[38:24] going to read about it speaks of the
[38:25] world power until the time of the
[38:28] end okay and then we're going to pick it
[38:30] up in Revelations chapter 13 So Daniel
[38:33] sees a vision until the end time and he
[38:36] sees from Nebuchadnezzar's Kingdom down
[38:39] all the way to this Beast that was very
[38:41] diverse you know uh from from you know
[38:45] of of all of them and this was the
[38:47] anointing now on the world system you
[38:50] know all the way down to the end so when
[38:52] it speaks about this kind of Beast it's
[38:54] actually the anointing that is on the
[38:55] world's power at the the
[38:57] time okay these things are all
[39:01] symbolic so and I just want to show
[39:05] you the um yeah let's just let's just
[39:08] read this whole piece here in the first
[39:11] year of B Shazer King of Babylon Daniel
[39:14] had a dream and vision of his head upon
[39:16] his bed then he wrote the dream and told
[39:18] the sum of the matters Daniel spake and
[39:20] said I saw in my vision by night and
[39:23] behold Four Winds of Heaven strove upon
[39:25] the Great Sea
[39:27] and four great beasts came up from the
[39:29] sea diverse one from another the first
[39:32] was like a lion and had Eagle's Wings I
[39:35] beheld till the wings thereof were
[39:37] plucked and it was lifted up from the
[39:39] earth and made stand upon the feet as a
[39:41] man and a man's heart was given under
[39:45] it and behold another Beast a second
[39:48] like a bear and it raised up itself on
[39:50] one side and it had three ribs in the
[39:53] mouth of it between the teeth of it and
[39:55] they said thus uh unto it arise devour
[39:59] much flesh after this I beheld in low
[40:01] another like a leopard that had upon the
[40:03] back of it four wings of a foul the
[40:06] Beast ALS uh had also four heads and
[40:09] Dominion was given unto it and after
[40:11] this I saw on the night visions uh uh
[40:14] and behold a fourth Beast Dreadful and
[40:17] terrible and strong exceedingly and it
[40:19] had great iron teeth at devoured and
[40:21] break in pieces and stamped the residue
[40:23] at the feet of it and it was diverse
[40:26] from from all the beasts that were
[40:27] before it and it had 10 horns now it was
[40:31] now this this Beast this this fourth
[40:34] Beast here which is actually the Roman
[40:37] the first one was the world Kingdom of
[40:39] Nebuchadnezzar which is the first Beast
[40:40] that came up the second one was the
[40:42] world Empire of the of the mes and
[40:44] Persians then the four and then the
[40:46] third one was was the Greeks and then
[40:49] this fourth one that we read about that
[40:51] Daniel couldn't he couldn't describe it
[40:53] properly like it was a be like a bear or
[40:55] a leopard or something this was the
[40:57] Roman World
[40:58] Empire and so now the reason it was it
[41:01] was diverse from all the other beasts is
[41:04] because all the all the anointings WR
[41:06] the first three are actually combining
[41:08] into the last one because you know when
[41:10] whenever a country invades another the
[41:13] culture of the country that they take
[41:15] over is absorbed into the into the
[41:17] Victor's culture yep so whenever one of
[41:21] these Empires conquered the other this
[41:22] one was absorbed into it and it actually
[41:25] changed the the one who conquered it
[41:28] yeah you see like you know you when
[41:30] Alexander the Great you know he took
[41:33] Babylon and then and then the whole
[41:35] Greek culture was changed because now
[41:37] they begin to adopt Babylonian ways you
[41:40] can just go read about it in history and
[41:42] then it's the same when the Romans took
[41:43] the Greeks over Greek thought and
[41:46] everything was now absorbed into the
[41:47] Roman
[41:48] Empire and so that's why it's it it was
[41:51] diversed from all the Beast is because
[41:53] these first three powers now were
[41:55] absorbed on to the
[41:58] fourth and
[42:01] then and then let's just
[42:04] read let's just read verse 8 and N I
[42:08] considered the horns and behold there
[42:10] came up among them another little horn
[42:13] before whom there was first three there
[42:15] were three of the first horns plucked up
[42:18] by the roots and behold in this horn
[42:20] were eyes like the eyes of a man and a
[42:22] mouth speaking great
[42:24] things and I beheld till the ancient uh
[42:27] until the Thrones were cast down and the
[42:30] Ancient of Days did sit whose garment
[42:32] was white as snow and the hair of his
[42:34] head like pure
[42:36] wool his throne was like the fiery flame
[42:39] and his wheels as a burning fire a fiery
[42:43] stream issued and came forth from before
[42:45] him 10,000 times 10,000 ministered unto
[42:49] him and and sorry thousand thousands
[42:51] ministered unto him and 10,000 times
[42:54] 10,000 stood before him the Judgment was
[42:57] set and the books were open and I beheld
[43:00] then because of the voice of the great
[43:02] words which the horn spake I beheld even
[43:04] till the Beast was slain and his body
[43:06] destroyed and giv to The Burning Flame
[43:09] so this goes all the way from from when
[43:13] when Rome was here and that same power
[43:15] goes all the way down it says until the
[43:17] a until the Thrones were cast down and
[43:19] the Ancient of Days did sit so that's
[43:22] when the kingdoms of man become the
[43:24] kingdoms of God where where the where
[43:26] the world kingdoms are done away with
[43:28] and Jesus Christ sets up his kingdom
[43:30] upon the Earth amen because when a
[43:33] throne is cast down that means the king
[43:35] the ruler is cast down that kingdom is
[43:37] cast down and so the Thrones were cast
[43:40] down means now there comes a time where
[43:43] the world powers have come to the end
[43:45] and now God's kingdom is upon the Earth
[43:47] again yeah and then when God's kingdom
[43:50] is established then now then this where
[43:53] the where the where the um we just read
[43:56] about the Thousand Times thousand
[43:58] ministered unto him then the 10,000
[44:00] times 10,000 stood before him and the
[44:02] books were open the Judgment was set
[44:04] that's the great white Throne judgment
[44:06] and we know after the great white Throne
[44:07] judgment then there's a lake of fire and
[44:09] everything that is not of God is thrown
[44:11] to the Lake of Fire that's why it says
[44:14] now his body was destroyed and given to
[44:15] the Burning Flame yeah so this so this
[44:19] so this world power now that we with the
[44:22] thing is just Rome and many many
[44:24] Christians they just they just look back
[44:26] oh that was Rome but they forget that
[44:28] that same power is still here
[44:30] today yeah that same power is still here
[44:33] today and then we're going to go to
[44:37] Revelation 13 because John sees
[44:41] literally you know um he he he sees the
[44:45] same the the same Beast powers that
[44:48] Daniel
[44:51] saw okay so we go to Revelations 13 and
[44:55] verse one
[44:57] now this power uh so so this Beast that
[45:01] comes out here now is the same one as
[45:04] the fourth Beast that we read about in
[45:06] in Daniel chapter 7 it's the same one
[45:09] because you see here and I stood upon
[45:11] the sand of the sea and and saw a beast
[45:13] rise up out of the
[45:15] sea having remember a sea is multitudes
[45:19] peoples you know it's people great
[45:21] population of people that's what the sea
[45:23] represents having seven heads and 10
[45:26] horns and upon his horns 10 crowns and
[45:28] upon his heads the name of blasphemy so
[45:31] this is this is actually more of a um
[45:34] detailed description than what Daniel
[45:37] saw because he didn't have a name of
[45:39] blasphemy before now how do you have a
[45:40] name of blasphemy it's like there was a
[45:42] there's another part of scripture you
[45:44] know brother and preaches a sermon
[45:46] Blasphemous
[45:48] names and in in the in the Book of
[45:52] Revelation and off the top of my head
[45:54] I'm not sure what the scriptures but I
[45:56] think it's Revelation 17 how she had all
[45:58] the names of blasphemy it's
[46:00] actually uh the the true interpretation
[46:03] as it is Blasphemous names so it's
[46:05] blaspheming God so how can you have a
[46:08] name that blasphemes God is that you is
[46:11] that you appear to be for God but you're
[46:15] actually against him but yet you quote
[46:17] scripture you you you talk about Easter
[46:19] and you talk about the cross and you say
[46:22] Jesus loves you but then if you're if
[46:24] you're teaching something wrong just
[46:25] like remember the serpent that's the
[46:27] reason I brought that out cuz the
[46:28] serpent preached the falsehood to even
[46:30] it brought death but yet he used
[46:33] scripture it wasn't the whole truth but
[46:35] he used most of the truth and then
[46:37] that's the devil's system all the way
[46:39] down to especially today as he'll give
[46:41] 99% truth quoted from here but there's
[46:45] that lie that he injects in and it
[46:47] brings death it doesn't bring life it
[46:50] doesn't produce this in a people amen it
[46:54] doesn't produce the life of the word in
[46:55] the people it produces whatever the
[46:58] system is that's why Catholics bring
[47:01] forth Catholics methodists bring forth
[47:03] meth you you Methodist Baptist Baptist
[47:06] pres Presbyterian Presbyterian Hill song
[47:08] Hill song whatever you want to whatever
[47:10] label or whatever religion they preach
[47:12] that's what they produce in the people
[47:14] but if the truth is produced it will
[47:15] produce Jesus Christ in the
[47:18] people amen and that's what we want
[47:20] don't you want to see Jesus in you
[47:23] hallelujah amen so the word the truth of
[47:25] the word will produce Jesus Christ in
[47:28] you okay so to have a name of blasphemy
[47:31] is actually now this is actually now a
[47:33] religious power it's always political
[47:36] but it's also a religious
[47:38] power and the Beast which I saw was like
[47:42] unto a leopard remember we read about a
[47:44] leopard and everything in in Daniel
[47:45] chapter 7 and the Beast which I saw was
[47:48] like unto a leopard and his feet as it
[47:50] were a feet of a beer and his mouth as a
[47:53] mouth of a
[47:54] lion and and the dragon gave him his
[47:58] power and his seat and great
[48:01] Authority now this word Dragon we think
[48:04] of a big scaly reptile that that that
[48:07] that breathes fire but the true the true
[48:11] uh if you look at the definition of the
[48:13] of dragon it means like a fabulous enemy
[48:15] you know a great enemy doesn't mean a
[48:17] big scaly guy it means an incredible
[48:20] enemy you know you know a fabulous enemy
[48:23] and but now the dragon we know is Satan
[48:26] so now Satan is giving his power he
[48:29] giving all of his power to this Beast to
[48:32] do what it wants to do so this is now a
[48:35] satanic move to to control the world now
[48:41] and I saw one of his heads as it were
[48:44] wounded to death and the deadly wound
[48:46] was healed and all the world wandered
[48:49] after the Beast now that was we
[48:51] understand when when the Roman world was
[48:53] coming to an end then team was coming to
[48:56] A great battle and he had a dream he and
[48:59] and he saw a cross he says with this
[49:01] sign under this sign you will conquer
[49:03] and he told all of his soldiers paint a
[49:05] cross on your Shields and they won the
[49:06] day and then what he did is he is in
[49:09] order to stabilize his his kingdom he he
[49:12] he United paganism with Christianity and
[49:16] it and it and it brought stability to
[49:18] the Empire so it changed from the what
[49:21] we think of the Roman Empire now to not
[49:23] not the Roman Empire with the legion is
[49:26] and things but it's now a Papal Empire
[49:28] it's now a religious Empire yeah because
[49:31] what other church has embassies around
[49:33] the world Catholic church has got
[49:36] embassies you look and you look at when
[49:38] the um you know you go back to the days
[49:41] of the Reformation medieval days who who
[49:44] literally ran the countries it wasn't
[49:45] just the king there was the Cardinal
[49:48] that's right amen who wasn't you know he
[49:50] was like the prime minister in many of
[49:52] the countries the French Revolution was
[49:54] they call it like an anti-roman move
[49:57] they're trying to get rid of the
[49:59] Catholic control of the
[50:00] country amen Henry VII had to get rid of
[50:03] his Cardinal you know to try and do what
[50:06] he had to do because remember this Beast
[50:09] is a polit it's religious but it's
[50:11] political so there's always a wherever
[50:13] the Catholic church is it's not just a
[50:15] religious thing there's a political
[50:17] motivation behind it so so back in the
[50:20] day when when during the Dark Ages it
[50:22] was really the Cardinal of the Catholic
[50:24] church he was really the power behind
[50:26] the
[50:27] king amen and he was influencing the
[50:30] king not to help the king but to help
[50:34] Rome
[50:36] yeah so it changed so you'd say well you
[50:40] know and then so it changed from the
[50:43] Roman Empire now to the Roman Catholic
[50:45] church but that is the power to the time
[50:47] of the
[50:48] End Amen you know you know I don't have
[50:52] it on me but you see Vietnam why the war
[50:54] in Vietnam arm happened the Catholic
[50:56] stirred it up you've heard about the
[50:59] Roman Catholic Holocaust in the Balkans
[51:02] after World War II how they how they it
[51:05] was the how they was it Yugoslavia
[51:08] there's the Roman Catholic part there's
[51:10] the Roman Orthodox part and the Roman
[51:13] Catholic part persecuted the the Roman
[51:16] Catholic part persecuted the Orthodox
[51:19] part and they murdered hundreds of
[51:21] thousands of people and it was and but
[51:24] but if you looked at it was like a
[51:25] fascist state but all of the what would
[51:28] happen is the is the Roman Catholic
[51:31] ministers would take off their robes put
[51:33] on their military uniforms and they'd be
[51:35] the ones in charge of all the pal
[51:37] military people that's true I you I'll
[51:40] yeah I'll send you a
[51:41] link and so but this was all done so it
[51:45] was a
[51:47] so the the Catholic church has
[51:49] engineered for Wars to happen you can
[51:52] see the Crusades let's go take the hly
[51:54] land back back well who started that war
[51:57] it was the Catholic
[51:58] Church everyone knows that it's just
[52:00] history and what about the Crusade you
[52:03] know and it wasn't just Crusades into
[52:05] the holy land they were up into like
[52:06] Lithuania those kind of places amen
[52:09] Catholic Church went into South America
[52:11] they did all butchered the whole
[52:13] place yeah but it was for political gain
[52:16] but they used religion now to stir the
[52:19] people up to get to to to get what they
[52:22] wanted to happen to
[52:24] happen and that's why when the pope
[52:26] speaks everyone
[52:28] listens everyone
[52:33] listens and they wondered and and they
[52:36] worshiped the
[52:37] dragon who gave power unto the Beast and
[52:40] they worshiped the Beast saying who is
[52:41] like under the Beast and who is able to
[52:44] make war with him who can make war you
[52:47] know if the pope said you know just like
[52:49] in World War II if the pope had Catholic
[52:51] stopped
[52:52] fighting that would have been an end
[52:55] yeah it would have been absolute in you
[52:58] know you know the not this Pope a few
[53:00] previous ones he he scolded America and
[53:03] the U you know you all these nations
[53:06] that that South America the Catholic
[53:07] nations in South America they owed money
[53:10] to America and other places and he told
[53:12] off these ones that were holding the
[53:13] debt over these other countries he said
[53:15] you shouldn't hold this debt and he told
[53:17] them off and then so what they did all
[53:18] these other countries forgave millions
[53:20] of dollars worth of
[53:22] debt why because he is you know he
[53:25] doesn't have an army he doesn't need an
[53:27] army that's right amen he just needs to
[53:29] say a few words and the whole world
[53:32] changes yeah but I'm going to hopefully
[53:35] have enough time cuz we're going to go
[53:36] well you say that's religion we're going
[53:38] to go into remember there's Two Babylons
[53:40] who knows there's Two
[53:42] Babylons yeah and so remember it's all
[53:45] of control just like Cain I have to
[53:48] destroy Abel so I can control the whole
[53:50] thing Tower of Babel I must build Babel
[53:52] so I can control the whole world yeah y
[53:55] so now Satan has engineered it in such a
[53:58] way that he wants to control the whole
[54:01] world and he needs a vehicle to do it
[54:07] now who was able to make war with the
[54:11] Beast okay let's just stop
[54:14] there no no let's keep going and there
[54:16] was get onto him a mouth speaking great
[54:18] things and bless me and power was given
[54:20] unto him to continue 4 and2 months and
[54:23] he opened his mouth in the uh and
[54:25] blasphemy against God to blasphemy his
[54:28] name and his and his Tabernacle and them
[54:30] that dwell in heaven it was given unto
[54:32] him to make war with the Saints and to
[54:34] overcome them now this is actually now
[54:36] in the Great Tribulation where the
[54:38] fullish Virgin are there cuz this to
[54:40] continue 4 and2 months I think that's 3
[54:42] and 1/2
[54:44] years yeah I might be wrong maybe I
[54:46] can't add but I think that's 3 and A2
[54:48] years okay so now during this three and
[54:50] a half years where he's got supreme
[54:51] control that's when he makes war with
[54:53] the Saints and he overcomes them
[54:55] and you can see this in Daniel chapter 7
[54:58] where it says and the kingdom was given
[54:59] to the Saints of the high it says after
[55:02] that but that this Beast made war with
[55:04] the Saints the most high and overcame
[55:06] them but then there's a judgment then
[55:08] the kingdom was given to the Saints well
[55:10] how does this work where one's just
[55:12] given the kingdom but then in the next
[55:13] verse it says the Beast overcomes them
[55:15] then then there's judgment then they
[55:16] given the kingdom that's because one is
[55:19] the wise virgin that has the oil that
[55:22] get given the kingdom and the others the
[55:24] fullest verg
[55:25] that gets overcome by the enemy and then
[55:27] after the Judgment they given the
[55:29] kingdom yeah because a saint means a
[55:33] Sanctified one yeah so the so the wise
[55:36] and foolish virgins they're all
[55:38] Sanctified but one one really knows the
[55:41] Lord they have the oil the others don't
[55:43] have the oil but they're both Sanctified
[55:46] so God has been working their lives but
[55:49] only one group really knows him they're
[55:51] the ones that go on the Rapture
[55:54] amen
[55:55] and all that dwell sorry and there was
[55:57] given unto him to make war with the
[55:58] Saints okay now let's go verse eight and
[56:00] all that dwell upon the Earth shall
[56:02] worship Him whose names are not written
[56:03] in the book of the life of the lamb
[56:05] slain them from the foundation of the
[56:07] world if any man Heaven ear let him here
[56:09] and he that leadth into captivity shall
[56:11] go into captivity and he that kth with
[56:13] the sword must be killed with the sword
[56:15] here is the patience and faith of the
[56:17] Saints now I want to go to Revelations
[56:20] chapter 18 just to cuz I want to um
[56:26] we'll come back to Revelations 13
[56:28] another
[56:30] time but I want to show you here in
[56:32] Revelations 18 that there's Two Babylons
[56:34] and when brother baram prophesied that
[56:36] California was going to slide into the
[56:38] sea it's already in the
[56:41] scripture yep but what happens is now a
[56:44] prophet will pick up a prophecy actually
[56:46] say Now's the Time it's going to happen
[56:49] am yeah so so when he when he said it's
[56:53] going to slide into the sea it's already
[56:54] in Revelations 18 here yep so
[57:00] now let's read let's read from verse
[57:04] one and then we're going to just read
[57:06] down to verse four then we're going to
[57:07] jump down to verse 9 and after these
[57:10] things I saw another Angel come down
[57:12] from heaven now after these things well
[57:15] what does that mean it means after
[57:17] Revelation 17 and Revelation 17 is is
[57:20] the Catholic is is the mother of harlots
[57:22] being identified so after she's been
[57:25] fully identified then what happens after
[57:27] these things I saw another Angel come
[57:29] down from heaven having great power and
[57:32] the Earth was lightened with his
[57:35] glory and now that is actually the
[57:37] ministry because an angel is not always
[57:39] a Heavenly being it's actually it's also
[57:41] a messenger so now now this is actually
[57:44] the prophet's Ministry because it was so
[57:46] great the whole earth was lightened with
[57:47] its Glory yeah and he cried mly with a
[57:51] strong voice saying Babylon the great
[57:52] has fallen has fallen and as has become
[57:55] the habitation of devils and the hold of
[57:58] every foul spirit and a cage of every
[58:00] unclean and hateful bird for all nations
[58:04] have drunk of the wine of the wrath of
[58:06] her fornication and the kings of the
[58:08] Earth have committed fornication with
[58:10] her and the merchants of the Earth are
[58:12] waxed Rich through the abundance of her
[58:15] Delicacies and I heard another voice
[58:18] from Heaven saying come out of her my
[58:20] people that ye be not partakers of her
[58:22] sins and that you receive not of her
[58:24] plagues for her sins have reached up
[58:26] into heaven and God hath remembered her
[58:30] iniquities so
[58:32] now so now this is this is the hour
[58:36] because because even even the Seventh
[58:37] Day Adventist they say they can go to
[58:40] Revelation 17 and say the Catholic
[58:41] church is the mother of harlots but they
[58:43] forget to be a mother you've got to have
[58:46] children so if she's a denomination then
[58:48] her children will be
[58:50] denomination yeah so they're actually
[58:53] stuck in the same cage she is is but
[58:55] they don't know it yeah and that's why
[58:57] there's the call come out of her my
[58:58] people it's not just Catholicism but all
[59:01] the religious systems come out of her my
[59:04] peoples that's why there's a call now
[59:06] that has gone into the earth now and
[59:08] it's called people out of out of out of
[59:11] churches out of
[59:13] denomination and what happens is those
[59:15] people don't normally want to leave the
[59:17] church they want to fix the church
[59:18] they're in but what happens is because
[59:20] that religious spirit's there they don't
[59:23] want to change and you can see it all
[59:25] the way through you can go into even
[59:27] even the early you know before the
[59:29] Reformation you know John whitecliffe
[59:32] who the first one or one of the first
[59:34] ones to translate the Bible into English
[59:37] in the 13 what
[59:39] 1400s and then his writings but then the
[59:41] Catholic Church wanted to to try him as
[59:43] a heretic they didn't like what he was
[59:46] doing but he wanted to fix the church he
[59:48] was in and then his teachings influenced
[59:50] John hus in Bohemia and then John hus
[59:54] was a a Catholic
[59:56] priest but he didn't want to start a new
[59:58] church he wanted to fix the Catholic
[1:00:00] church but the Catholic Church didn't
[1:00:02] want to change so they burned him at a
[1:00:05] burned him at the Stak as a heretic but
[1:00:08] then he said in a 100 years someone will
[1:00:10] raise up with the same thing and you
[1:00:12] will not be able to destroy him and 100
[1:00:14] years later Jo um um Martin Luther
[1:00:17] raised up with the Joshua lived by faith
[1:00:20] he was a Catholic priest he didn't want
[1:00:21] to leave the Catholic church he wanted
[1:00:23] to fix the church
[1:00:25] but the church didn't want to change so
[1:00:26] they had to leave then John Wesley with
[1:00:29] the Anglican Church the same thing he
[1:00:30] didn't want to leave the Anglican Church
[1:00:31] he wanted to fix it amen but he had to
[1:00:35] leave the Pentecostal is the same way
[1:00:38] brother Braham had to leave the Baptist
[1:00:39] Church he didn't want to leave the
[1:00:40] Baptist Church but he had to because he
[1:00:42] didn't agree on their Doctrine and he
[1:00:44] tried to show them in the scriptures not
[1:00:46] right to have woman preachers but they
[1:00:47] didn't agree they wouldn't want to
[1:00:49] change so he had to
[1:00:50] leave amen because there's that
[1:00:53] religious systems rigid it it's it's
[1:00:55] this is how it is and this is how it is
[1:00:57] but God is always revealing himself more
[1:00:59] and more amen amen so it's always the
[1:01:02] it's always you know it's like John hus
[1:01:04] if the Catholic I mean um uh Martin
[1:01:07] Luther if the Catholic church had their
[1:01:09] way they would have burned him as
[1:01:11] well
[1:01:12] amen so it's always it's always that
[1:01:15] same thing the the false wants to
[1:01:17] destroy the true but the you know but
[1:01:20] the true doesn't want us you know they
[1:01:21] just want to fix what they're
[1:01:23] in
[1:01:26] then so
[1:01:28] now um yeah and and and then it says now
[1:01:31] so so it says so he said Babylon is
[1:01:34] Fallen ever is the habitation of of
[1:01:37] devils and the hold of every foul spirit
[1:01:39] so all the evil spirit you can say
[1:01:41] that's its
[1:01:43] habitation now I'm going to I'm going to
[1:01:45] quickly get through this because I don't
[1:01:46] want to be too long for all nations have
[1:01:48] drunk the Wrath the wine of the wrath of
[1:01:50] a fornication so the whole world has
[1:01:52] become drunk and the whole world is
[1:01:55] drunk why because the whole world has
[1:01:57] become pleasure mad you know all they
[1:02:00] want to have is a good time they don't
[1:02:02] just want to live everyday life that's
[1:02:05] true although you know even at school
[1:02:09] people just wanted to look forward to
[1:02:10] the weekend we're just in seventh form
[1:02:12] but people just go and then Monday what
[1:02:14] are we doing next weekend and the whole
[1:02:17] world is like what are we going to do
[1:02:18] when we get off work you know people
[1:02:20] don't just want to sit back and just
[1:02:21] look at life they want to be entertained
[1:02:24] you know and the world is people have
[1:02:26] become drunk with the pleasures of this
[1:02:29] world now and people have become very
[1:02:33] rich and then
[1:02:35] now let's go down let's go down to verse
[1:02:40] 9 I sorry verse eight therefore shall
[1:02:43] her plagues come in one day death and
[1:02:45] mourning and famine and she shall be
[1:02:46] utterly burned with fire for strong is
[1:02:48] the Lord God who judges her and the
[1:02:51] kings of the earth who have committed
[1:02:52] fornication and live deliciously with
[1:02:54] her shall bewail her and lament for her
[1:02:57] when they shall see the smoke of her
[1:02:59] burning standing AAR off for the fear of
[1:03:01] her torment saying alas l the great City
[1:03:04] Babylon that Mighty City for in one hour
[1:03:07] is thy judgment come then brother Bram
[1:03:09] says they're going to drop an atomic
[1:03:11] bomb on the Vatican that's why it's the
[1:03:13] burning and the torment and one hour is
[1:03:15] just going to be wiped off the face of
[1:03:17] the Earth cuz the Russians are going to
[1:03:18] drop a bomb on it that's exactly what's
[1:03:21] going to
[1:03:22] happen so so one Babylon here is
[1:03:26] destroyed by
[1:03:28] burning
[1:03:30] okay and then if we read and then let's
[1:03:32] just continue reading and the merchants
[1:03:35] of the Earth shall weep and mourn over
[1:03:36] her for no man buth their merchandise
[1:03:39] anymore the merchandise of gold and
[1:03:41] silver and precious stones and of pearls
[1:03:43] and fine linen and purple and silk and
[1:03:45] Scarlet and all thine wood and all
[1:03:47] manner of vessels of iy and all manner
[1:03:49] of vessels of precious wood and of brass
[1:03:51] and iron and marble and cinnamon and
[1:03:54] oders and ointments and frankincense and
[1:03:56] wine and oil and fine flour and wheat
[1:03:57] and Beast and sheep and slaves I mean
[1:04:01] and horses and chariots and slaves and
[1:04:04] Souls of men so it's not just what what
[1:04:07] trades in Souls religion trades and
[1:04:10] souls yeah so but all these other things
[1:04:13] are economic things trade but then it's
[1:04:16] and The Souls of
[1:04:17] men so Rome doesn't just trade in wealth
[1:04:22] it trades in Souls of men

[1:04:41] merchants of these things which were
[1:04:44] made Rich by her shall stand AAR off for
[1:04:46] the fear of her torment weeping and
[1:04:47] wailing and saying alas L that great
[1:04:50] city that was clothed in fine linen and
[1:04:52] purple and Scarlet and Deck with gold
[1:04:53] and precious stones and jewels for in
[1:04:56] one hour so great riches has come to nor
[1:04:58] and every ship master and all the
[1:05:00] company of ships and sailors and as many
[1:05:03] as trade by sea stood a far off and
[1:05:05] cried when they saw the smoke of her
[1:05:07] burning saying what city is like under
[1:05:09] this city it's called The Eternal
[1:05:12] City amen and they cast dust on their
[1:05:15] heads and cried weeping and wailing
[1:05:16] saying alas alas that great City when
[1:05:19] were made Rich all that had ships in the
[1:05:22] sea by rant by reason of a coastlines
[1:05:25] from one hour is she made
[1:05:28] desolate now that's the first
[1:05:31] Babylon and then the second one Rejoice
[1:05:33] over her thou heaven and ye Holy
[1:05:35] Apostles and Prophets for God has
[1:05:37] Avenged you on her and a mighty Angel
[1:05:40] took up a stone like a great Millstone
[1:05:43] and cast it into the sea saying th with
[1:05:45] violence shall thou great City Babylon
[1:05:48] be thrown down and shall be found no
[1:05:53] more at all all now we're going to read
[1:05:56] another description and it's different
[1:05:57] to the first
[1:05:58] one okay so we read about all the
[1:06:00] merchandise that was traded and
[1:06:02] everything that was in the first one and
[1:06:03] The Souls of men but now this next one
[1:06:05] is not burnt it's thrown like a stone
[1:06:08] Millstone into the sea yeah and then it
[1:06:11] says and the voice of Harpers and
[1:06:14] musicians and of Pipers and trumpeters
[1:06:16] shall be heard no more at all in thee
[1:06:19] and no Craftsman and whatsoever craft he
[1:06:22] be shall be found anymore in thee and
[1:06:24] the sound of a millstone shall be heard
[1:06:26] no more in thee and the light of a
[1:06:28] candle shall be shine no more at all in
[1:06:30] thee and the voice of the bridegroom and
[1:06:33] of the Bride shall be heard no more at
[1:06:35] all in thee for thy Merchants were the
[1:06:37] Great Men of the earth and for by thy
[1:06:42] sorceries were all nations deceived and
[1:06:45] in her was found the blood of prophets
[1:06:48] and of saints and all that was slain
[1:06:50] upon the Earth so here's a different
[1:06:52] kind of Babylon
[1:06:55] and it says now for by the sorceries for
[1:06:59] by the sorceries of this place was all
[1:07:01] the men
[1:07:02] deceived now I'll just I'll just bring
[1:07:05] it on
[1:07:06] home this second Babylon the reason
[1:07:09] California or Los Angeles is going in is
[1:07:12] because Hollywood's
[1:07:14] there yeah and and brother Braham said
[1:07:17] once upon a time they'd go to Paris
[1:07:19] France to get all the filth of the world
[1:07:22] and Paris would export it to the world
[1:07:24] but then now Hollywood exports it to the
[1:07:28] world it
[1:07:30] does and this whole world your thinking
[1:07:33] I'll say your thinking has been changed
[1:07:36] because of what has come out of
[1:07:38] Hollywood whether you like it or not
[1:07:40] some things the way you think about
[1:07:42] certain things has been
[1:07:46] altered by
[1:07:47] Hollywood this whole society that we
[1:07:50] live in has been changed by
[1:07:52] Hollywood amen you might as well say
[1:07:55] Amen because it's
[1:07:56] true you take you take for example the
[1:08:00] you know you know you know Obama stood
[1:08:02] up the president stood up and he said
[1:08:04] all the schools now you have to have
[1:08:07] transgender friendly bathrooms it's not
[1:08:10] male and female anymore you have unisex
[1:08:13] bathrooms one of the states I might be
[1:08:15] wrong Georgia or one of the states
[1:08:18] actually said no we're not going to do
[1:08:20] this and then what happens is Hollywood
[1:08:23] stands up up and says unless you change
[1:08:26] to match this law we are not going to
[1:08:29] film any more movies or do anything in
[1:08:31] your state and you're going to lose a
[1:08:33] lot of money and
[1:08:35] income and then that state bows to what
[1:08:38] Hollywood says that's right yeah so
[1:08:42] there's an
[1:08:44] agenda that has come out am and it's
[1:08:48] actually who's driving it it's Hollywood
[1:08:51] is driving that agenda you have tock
[1:08:53] change even bathrooms now you say well
[1:08:56] that's not too significant it is if you
[1:08:58] look at the principle now is that a
[1:09:00] bunch of filmmakers are dictating this
[1:09:03] is how life should be once upon a time
[1:09:07] there was the king and there was the
[1:09:08] jester you you've seen the jester with
[1:09:11] the funny hat and he used to entertain
[1:09:13] everyone in the castle now the Jester's
[1:09:15] on the
[1:09:17] throne amen and everyone listens to the
[1:09:20] jester right how's that so an actor gets
[1:09:23] up says this and this and we should do
[1:09:25] this everyone takes everyone listens to
[1:09:27] what they say what's happening the
[1:09:29] gesture is now on the throne amen that's
[1:09:32] right and the whole world changes to
[1:09:34] what the gers say it used to be once a
[1:09:37] time you know it used to be once upon a
[1:09:38] time you're just a
[1:09:40] Jester I don't take you all too
[1:09:42] seriously now the whole world listens to
[1:09:44] what the gers have to say the
[1:09:46] entertainment the whole world whether
[1:09:48] you like it or not that's just how it is
[1:09:52] amen so so the devil has set up
[1:09:55] Hollywood in such a way that it's
[1:09:57] actually changed the face of the whole
[1:09:59] society has been changed because of what
[1:10:02] has come out of that
[1:10:04] place and not far from you know La
[1:10:07] there's there's Silicon Valley where
[1:10:11] there's Google and you know all the all
[1:10:12] the great technical companies of the
[1:10:14] world they're all just right there and
[1:10:17] Facebook and Twitter and Instagram all
[1:10:19] those things they're they're right there
[1:10:22] and someone can put a message Mage on on
[1:10:25] Instagram or Facebook someone who's a
[1:10:27] celebrity and it'll reach the whole
[1:10:31] world yeah some some celebrities they
[1:10:34] try and put photos on you know photos on
[1:10:36] the internet because they try and want
[1:10:38] to break the internet cuz they just want
[1:10:40] to get their picture out there they want
[1:10:42] to get their they want to project
[1:10:43] themselves over the world that's what
[1:10:46] they do and the whole world listens to
[1:10:48] the
[1:10:50] gers yeah you're not immune to it
[1:10:53] because it influences people around you
[1:10:56] it even influences your way you I was
[1:10:59] listening to you know you brother Bram
[1:11:01] the reason brother Bram didn't like I
[1:11:03] Love Lucy or everyone loves Lucy
[1:11:04] whatever it was is it wasn't just
[1:11:06] because it kept people out away from
[1:11:08] prayer meetings but it's because it was
[1:11:11] actually Lucy's husband was the dummy
[1:11:13] and she was the smart
[1:11:15] one yeah and so what what was it
[1:11:18] portraying
[1:11:20] now that men are dumb and the woman's
[1:11:23] actually the one in control so it
[1:11:25] actually was re-engineering
[1:11:28] Society yeah and you come down to Bob
[1:11:31] the
[1:11:32] Builder who saves the day most of the
[1:11:34] time is it Bob it's
[1:11:38] Wendy Wendy's the one who actually saves
[1:11:40] a day most of the
[1:11:42] time and she she's the
[1:11:45] helper
[1:11:48] yeah now girls can do
[1:11:51] everything but there's some things that
[1:11:54] girls shouldn't really do do you want a
[1:11:56] girl to be like in the
[1:11:58] Army yeah would you want to be you know
[1:12:01] or or be in the police force and see
[1:12:03] graphic terrible things that's not
[1:12:06] really A Woman's
[1:12:07] Place
[1:12:09] yeah they can do it but you see the
[1:12:12] whole thing about Bob the Builder now
[1:12:13] it's actually betraying boys are
[1:12:15] dumb the girls are the Smart Ones and
[1:12:18] girls are smart trust me I got three of
[1:12:20] them they're smart and it's good girls
[1:12:22] are smart but you see what it's done
[1:12:25] it's actually it's actually gone too far
[1:12:28] one
[1:12:29] way you say oh that's just being sexist
[1:12:32] no it's not because what is me what is
[1:12:34] what a what are men now what is a
[1:12:37] stereotypical man is he in is he
[1:12:40] remember someone who's in charge is not
[1:12:43] domineering you know who who lays down
[1:12:46] the law and that's not being in charge
[1:12:48] that's actually using fear to be in
[1:12:49] charge that's not actually being a real
[1:12:51] man it used to be that way sure
[1:12:54] but now a stereotypical man is just a
[1:12:56] guy who just floats along only cares
[1:12:59] about what sport stars are doing you
[1:13:02] know all they all they care about is
[1:13:04] that or finding some girl or finding a
[1:13:06] drink that's all they care
[1:13:09] about that's true that's what that's
[1:13:12] what man instead of actually having a
[1:13:15] one taking responsibility for what he's
[1:13:17] doing to actually taking control in a in
[1:13:20] the right way actually being the
[1:13:22] leadership
[1:13:24] showing Godly leadership they've
[1:13:26] actually just watered man has been
[1:13:27] watered down in such a way that he just
[1:13:29] floats along oh the stupid man yeah hey
[1:13:33] some are stupid sure but you know what I
[1:13:35] mean you understand the whole the whole
[1:13:38] of society has been
[1:13:39] re-engineered am and now where did that
[1:13:42] come from came from
[1:13:44] Hollywood
[1:13:46] yeah and so you know just go look at the
[1:13:52] world oh The
[1:13:55] Bachelor hey it's on we can't you go on
[1:13:58] to in you know like New Zealand Herald
[1:14:00] it's on the web page you just see the
[1:14:03] headlines you know but what is that
[1:14:05] betraying a man
[1:14:06] as he's not actually looking for a wife
[1:14:09] he's just looking for a good
[1:14:11] time you know he's not actually that's
[1:14:14] not that's not actually a real
[1:14:16] man I'm you think you're going on at a
[1:14:19] tangent no I'm not society's been
[1:14:21] re-engineered you know and all and all
[1:14:24] that guy is betraying is hey I'm just
[1:14:25] looking
[1:14:27] for Miss next one instead of the right
[1:14:31] one
[1:14:32] yeah and what is it it's actually just
[1:14:35] just just changing how how Society is oh
[1:14:39] there's nothing wrong with that yeah it
[1:14:40] is that's not a real man a real man
[1:14:44] Waits upon the Lord and then when when
[1:14:47] and then when the Lord shows him now
[1:14:49] this is the right one then he goes after
[1:14:52] that one and then he stays with that one
[1:14:53] and loves that one and gives himself in
[1:14:57] order to gives his whole life that his
[1:15:00] family and his wife especially you know
[1:15:03] he's not selfish real man's not
[1:15:06] selfish what is man these days what can
[1:15:09] I get and it's dog eat
[1:15:11] dog that's not a real
[1:15:14] man
[1:15:15] amen you understand no no but the
[1:15:18] honestly the whole world has been
[1:15:19] re-engineered the things the things that
[1:15:22] we see
[1:15:24] and even you know on the street whatever
[1:15:26] more it never used to be that
[1:15:29] way then what happened Hollywood came
[1:15:33] along you know
[1:15:36] movies movies have you know sometimes
[1:15:38] you just watch it and there's all the
[1:15:39] entertainment all these nice things but
[1:15:41] there's but there's a message being put
[1:15:44] across yeah even even even in there's a
[1:15:48] new movie I'm not recommending movies
[1:15:51] but there's you know Finding Nemo
[1:15:53] now there's Finding
[1:15:55] Dory and in the
[1:15:57] trailer there's these there's these two
[1:15:59] women one looks more like a man than a
[1:16:01] woman and they've got a baby in a in a
[1:16:04] in a uh
[1:16:06] buggy and some people saying well now
[1:16:08] this is the first transgender couple in
[1:16:11] a kid's
[1:16:13] movie what's it doing it's making it
[1:16:16] acceptable you say it's harmless it's
[1:16:19] trying to make it acceptable that's
[1:16:21] right and who's pushing it the same
[1:16:24] people that said to that state you
[1:16:25] better reverse that law otherwise we're
[1:16:27] not making films in your
[1:16:29] state what if they got to do with the
[1:16:31] laws of the
[1:16:33] land it's control right it's an agenda
[1:16:37] we're going to change society and
[1:16:39] they've done
[1:16:41] it yeah and that's why we look like the
[1:16:44] weirdos that's right amen We Are The
[1:16:46] Crazy
[1:16:48] Ones and they are the normal ones now
[1:16:51] but who says it's normal that's why
[1:16:53] there's a call in this day come out of
[1:16:55] her my people and it's not just out of
[1:16:58] churches now it's out of you could say
[1:17:00] mainstream
[1:17:02] culture yeah because that's all it's
[1:17:04] it's all encompassed now that's right
[1:17:07] amen people can be people can be in a
[1:17:10] church and be lost or they can just be
[1:17:12] in the world and be
[1:17:14] lost yeah and that's why there's the
[1:17:17] call come out of her my people and
[1:17:20] that's why we have a great
[1:17:22] responsibility because we have the thing
[1:17:24] that opens the door that lets the people
[1:17:27] out whether you realize it or not I'm
[1:17:29] just going to maybe just just put this
[1:17:31] burden on you a little bit you have the
[1:17:33] key you shall know the truth and the
[1:17:36] truth shall make you
[1:17:38] free
[1:17:40] amen and so we
[1:17:43] have we have the key now I'm just going
[1:17:46] to close with this we have the key that
[1:17:49] can set people free so whenever you see
[1:17:52] anyone like that
[1:17:53] don't say you terrible person no we were
[1:17:57] blind remember doesn't matter if you're
[1:17:59] raised in church you were blind once
[1:18:01] upon a time and you would have ended if
[1:18:03] God didn't come across your path you
[1:18:06] would be there that's right it's not
[1:18:08] it's not your ability that you're free
[1:18:10] it's what he has done for you he wanted
[1:18:12] to set you free he wanted to change you
[1:18:17] that you can look at the world so don't
[1:18:20] you know if God can save you he can save
[1:18:23] them amen amen if he can open your eyes
[1:18:26] he can sure do it for
[1:18:27] them and so that's why don't ever look
[1:18:31] down on
[1:18:32] people but just say Lord if only they
[1:18:35] could I want them to have the same love
[1:18:38] and peace that I have for you I want
