Almighty God, we come to your presence, Lord, because we love you, Father. Want to give you thanks for all your blessings. Thank you for taking care of our families, Lord. We believe in your promises, Lord. We believe your promise, Lord, that if we believe, our house will be saved. Lord, want to ask you to talk to me through turns, Lord, and to bless your people, Father. want to give you thanks for everything. Be with us tonight. I worship this in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. And thank you musicians. Thank you. Um it's always very hard to stand here just for the presence and everything. And I'm South American so I just cry. That's the only thing that I can do. Um, so that was a very fitting song for the subject that we're going to talk tonight is the Passover. We're going to talk how applying the blood you can save. The blood is our token. So we can go to Exodus 12 verse 13. Um and the Bible says, "And the blood shall be to you for a token upon the houses where ye are. And when I see the blood, I will pass over you, and the plague shall not be upon you to destroy you when I smite the land of Egypt." You can have your seats. The blood. The blood was always the token. We can see through the Bible. Can you turn me down a little bit here? Sounds echoy. When Adam and Eve they sin, God's answer was the blood of the lamb to cover their sin. We'll see here also Abel got the revelation of the blood because he was part of the seed but not his brother. So if we go back here to Egypt again, the people from um the Hebrews, they were slaves. They were in a condition that they didn't wanted to be. But the Lord told them that they were going to be slaves in a foreign land for 400 years. But um God, he always fulfilled his promises and he said that he was going to take them out of a slavery &gt;&gt; with a mighty hand, but he also hardened up the um heart of Pharaoh. Now, Pharaoh is a funny character because he's a type of the world. He was a he was the king of Egypt, the king of the world, the type of the devil, I will say. So when Moses went to talk to him, Pharaoh, he tried to negotiate with him. &gt;&gt; We can we can see here. And Pharaoh called Moses said to him, "Let my people go." And he said, "And Pharaoh called unto Moses and said, "Go ye serve the Lord only. Let your flocks and your heads be stayed. Let your little ones also go with you." That's the same thing that the devil can do to you through reasoning. If you decide to follow Christ, the devil can be there and says, &gt;&gt; "Yeah, you can follow Christ." That's a very good decision, but don't give you 100%. &gt;&gt; Cuz you can be one of these weirdos that go to church on Wednesdays and Sundays, and that's that's not ideal for you and your friends. What your friends are going to think about you. &gt;&gt; But Moses said, "Nah, we're not going to leave not even one hoof &gt;&gt; behind. We're going to go But that reasoning is um that Pharaoh had is still here &gt;&gt; and to follow Christ. You can follow Christ but the devil is going to reasoning with you. He say where you going to follow Christ? You're still young. You can you have so much life in front of you. You can still do a little bit of sinning and then you can repent. &gt;&gt; But they were called to do the Exodus. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now the Passover was when um they had to eat the lamb. It was the whole limb was not just a portion of like in a certain um preparation that you like was just on the fire and with bitter herbs. So that was I would say that was not that pleasant to eat but they were told to do it according to to display the the blood to display the token. They had to fulfill all God's words. They had to obey the word of God. &gt;&gt; Was not just kill the lamb, &gt;&gt; apply the blood and don't eat it. They had to go step by step. Um, and you know what the funny thing about that? They were still slaves, but they were celebrating. They were going to take, we're going to be take out of slavery, &gt;&gt; but they dressed up, they eat, they were celebrating because the Lord, he was going to deliver them. Amen. &gt;&gt; You can celebrate in the middle of the test &gt;&gt; because God is more powerful. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now we have talk Ben talk about little Johnny down the road that died. There's a Johnny. Yes. But let's see from the Egyptians point of view. Right. &gt;&gt; Next morning, little um Amen was dead and the father of the house us can um his wife said, "What was different &gt;&gt; between us and them? Our walls were thicker, &gt;&gt; thicker. They were slaves. How comes that our son died?" So I can imagine them going down the road and see the difference. &gt;&gt; What was the only difference was the blood. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The only difference was was the blood. Amen. &gt;&gt; And they said this is Acts 16 says and they said believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and thou shalt be saved in thy house. So the blood of Jesus Christ, the blood of that lamb was able to protect the whole house. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; When that angel of dead came down and smite all the firstborn, the blood was there as a token. &gt;&gt; I will see the blood and I'll pass over you. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And we all know the Exodus took place. Amen. So the revelation of the blood goes through the whole Bible. We see Abel here offering a sacrifice and the Bible calls it an excellent a more excellent sacrifice than Cain and he was counted righteous. But how that revelation got to him? Probably he talked to his dad. Probably that revelation just came to him because he was part of the seed. But the truth is that he was able to offer the right sacrifice. &gt;&gt; Not Cain. Cain probably he thought, well, I'm going to give my best. I have watered this plants and now I have all these nice crops. This looks way better than that lamb that is dying there. But that was not what God wanted. And we also see here Rahab, she also applied a token that was told to her to apply and go to Joshua 2 and says, "Behold, when we come into the land, thou shalt bind this line of scarlet thread in the window which thou did lead us down by, and thou shalt bring thy father and thy mother, and thy brethren, and all the father household home unto thee. was for the whole family just feed the most and apply the token and we know that she believed and that's what happened she got saved and he and everyone who was in in her house now this is brother Brandham saying the token is a sign the purchase has been made for us full obedience to the full word of God entitled us to the token no other way is there that you can ever be entitled to the token until you fully obey the word. Not what somebody put into it and added it to it, but what God said about it. We know now that the token is not the actual blood. Now it's the Holy Ghost living in you and me. &gt;&gt; And this is one of this beautiful parallels that the Bible has. This is Jesus when for the last supper he says and when he had given thanks he break it and said take it eat this is my body which is broken for you this to do in remembrance of me. After the same manner also he took the cup when he had Sabbath Sabbath saying this cup is the new testament in my blood. This yei as of as you drink it in remembrance of me. You and you all English always had to trick me. Hi Bruce what they were doing. Jesus there was no cross yet but they were celebrating celebrating victory. &gt;&gt; Something was about to take place. Yeah. &gt;&gt; And that's that's a parallelism that is beautiful that we can just rest &gt;&gt; in the Lord &gt;&gt; because he has the victory. &gt;&gt; Same thing here. Middle of the storm, &gt;&gt; but we Jesus is in our same boat. &gt;&gt; We can just rest in him. &gt;&gt; Amen. Daniel in the middle of the trouble man that oh boy surrounded by lions but he had that faith that his God was more than able to deliver him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's what happened. Paul and Silas in prison and singing rejoicing. &gt;&gt; They knew that the Lord was more powerful. Amen. Um Hebrews 10 says, "For by one offering he had perfect perfected forever them that year um that they are sanctified. Where of the Holy Ghost also is a witness to us to for after that he had said before. This is the covenant that I will make with them after those days, says the Lord. I would put my laws into their hearts and in their minds will I write them and their sins and iniquities will I remember no more. Now where remission of this is, there is no more offering for sin. Having therefore, brethren, boldness to enter into the holiest by the blood of Jesus. one sacrifice. &gt;&gt; The blood through the whole Bible &gt;&gt; has been more than powerful. &gt;&gt; But the blood of animals, they were just able to cover the sin. The blood of Jesus Christ was able to totally disintegrate that sin. &gt;&gt; There's no more sin. It's nothing. So we can enter into the presence of God through his blood. Now, there's this this verse um I I watched a little clip about it. It's actually quite nice. It says, "And he shall sit as a refiner and purifier of silver, and he shall purify the son of Levi and purge them as gold and silver that they may offer unto the Lord an offering in righteousness." So, I watched this video. There was this group of people that they were wondering why this is he is going to sit like a silver smmith you know like just to purify us. So they went to this um silver smmith and they saw all the process of how the uh silver get um refined. So they have to burn it and when the silver bends it just in this liquid form that you can pull all the impurities and stuff and the lady one of the ladies said to the guy how do you know when the the silver is ready and the guy he just laughed and said what I can see my reflect in the silver. So all the test that we can go through is just that we can reflect him. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; And it's hard man. It's just sometimes it's just very hard. But we are in his hands. Amen. &gt;&gt; Now we know there has been three um two exodus already, right? The first one took the people of um Israel out of Egypt to the promised land. The second one took the people from the law to the grace with the blood of Jesus Christ. And after exoduses from denomination to the rest of the Holy Ghost and out of this world to the millennium, right? Amen. &gt;&gt; But in according to do the thing, the only thing that's going to entitle us to the token is just the full obedience to the word of God. Full obedience. I think it's quite nice that all also another um I'm going to say parallelism a lot of time when um John saw um when he's uh in the revelation book the angel told him eat the book the whole book and it's going to be so nice in your mouth but it's going to be so bitter in your stomach it's just when you know the revelation oh man, beautiful. But you have to live word by word. &gt;&gt; And that's the only thing that's going to entitle us to the token. And if we can apply the token, brother Brandham in the message, the token also says that we can apply the token for our families. We can have the faith that they can be saved. And we today is a prayer meeting and I'm pretty much done. This is me. You know me. If we can pray for our families that they're going to be saved, &gt;&gt; it's not it's not because of us. It's not because of Jimmy. He's praying for his family back home. I'm no one. &gt;&gt; But I trust that that blood &gt;&gt; can redeem them. &gt;&gt; Something beautiful. It's like years ago my parents, they were praying for me &gt;&gt; because I was a total disaster, man. I was in the world. while I was doing drugs. I was just a mess. I'm a miracle. &gt;&gt; The Lord brought me here, changed my life. &gt;&gt; And I'm praying for my parents because I want them to be in the place that I am. &gt;&gt; Not physically, but in sitting in high places with Christ Jesus. that place that you can sit &gt;&gt; and rest &gt;&gt; because you know that he's in control of everything and like the refiner fire the refiner um it's not going to be easy no one likes to get banned man but he has to purify us so we can reflect his life &gt;&gt; brother Brandham said there's no there hasn't been any other age when we have to show that we are Christians because the lamb was sacrificed at midnight right at the in that time he says that this is the mid time like the midnight time we at the end we're in the end time we have to show that we are Christians but showing that you're a Christian and not just telling people that you're Christian and then just swearing run down the road and he's living a life living the full life. I met this brother um Christ Church his name is um brother um Roberto Gonzalez who's Filipino. I have never hear him preach. He he doesn't preach but his life is a living testimony. Every time that I see him, I'm like, how someone can have so much love, man. I just see his face and his family and it's just I can see Jesus there. also remember when um when I was about to come here, I was doing really bad back home and um I was able to see Jesus in my dad cuz my well I'm not going to talk bad about my mom but my mom is more of like why would you do that and and stuff but my dad he was crying he told me something that it just me. He said, "What can I do to help you? What can I do to help you, son?" And after that took the plane, just prayed to the Lord and he just changed my life. &gt;&gt; But I think that's the most important thing. And if you can take something for um tonight, just let's live a life that the people can see Christ living in you, Christ living in me. And sometimes can be hard. Let's just have the musicians. We're going to pray, too. But we know that him is not going to stop. He has to purify you because he purchases you. You are part of him and he's not going to leave you, not forsake you. And he has to do a job. He has to make you clean cuz he want to take you, right? Take you for the rapture. Let's just stand and pray. Can Can we sing? Um, thank you, Jesus. Almighty God, we want to give you thanks because you are our God. You are our dead and you are every time that we need you, Father. We count with you. We love you so much, Lord. Thank you for provide for us, Lord. A way. Thank you for provide Lord a way to contact you again Lord through the blood of our Lord Jesus Christ. We want to give you thanks father for every time that you have been there for us. Every time that we are on the road Lord and you protect us for every accident Lord. Every time that you give us love, Lord, when no one was there, Father, you have been always there for us. Want to give you thanks and we want to ask you to be for the with us for the rest of the meeting. Lord, we're going to keep praying. Father, there's so much need, Lord. Some of our sisters are sick, Lord. But we can sing victory, Lord. We can claim our victory, Father, cuz we know that you are the doctor, Lord. You are our dad, Lord. Thank you, Father. We want to ask you this in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ. Amen.
