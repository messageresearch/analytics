[18:04] [Music]
[18:39] then
[18:41] it is
[18:43] a little word speaks about
[18:47] to say
[18:48] [Music]
[19:13] oh
[19:19] I was
[19:21] decision
[19:22] and I was Glory
[19:26] from somewhere deep inside
[19:33] [Music]
[19:55] cry
[19:57] [Music]
[20:07] it's only I could fly and I believe the
[20:12] world that I had Earth
[20:16] [Music]
[20:34] everything is
[20:36] [Music]
[20:42] every situations
[20:45] whatever comes my way I I have a peace
[20:50] with Jesus flying above the storm
[20:56] there is a joy within me now that I'm
[21:01] sorry really
[21:03] your word has Set Me Free I'm flying
[21:07] above
[21:14] that's always
[21:17] [Music]
[21:47] told me I could fly
[21:50] and I believe the words
[21:53] [Music]
[22:04] amen we heard an eagle cry
[22:07] you said look up
[22:09] and we looked up and since that day we
[22:13] never looked down
[22:14] come trials and tribulations come
[22:16] everything we just keep walking amen
[22:19] some days are easy we FL we feel like
[22:22] we're flying right up there and the
[22:24] wind's pushing and everything's easy and
[22:26] the other days we feel like we we're
[22:28] going through Thunder and hail and
[22:31] lightning and and it's hard but you know
[22:34] what I heard an eagle cry
[22:37] you know and that eagle only really
[22:39] cries
[22:41] when he's calling you and he calls you
[22:44] by name amen and he called each one of
[22:47] us by name
[22:48] and guess what
[22:50] we're here because when God calls your
[22:53] name
[22:54] it is a finished work
[22:57] but see the names in the book he has to
[22:59] call as much as we want to do it in
[23:01] ourselves
[23:02] he has to do the calling amen
[23:05] God bless you Saints we're just going to
[23:07] open up in a word of prayer you can play
[23:09] this while we're praying and say Lord
[23:11] Jesus
[23:12] we come here before you tonight Lord
[23:15] we are nothing Lord but
[23:18] the dust of the earth which you formed
[23:20] us from Lord but see Lord there is one
[23:22] difference between us Lord and the rest
[23:24] of this world you breast your life into
[23:28] us
[23:29] you've placed your Holy Spirit within us
[23:32] Lord it doesn't make us anything more
[23:34] special father it makes us even more
[23:36] thankful Lord that you would be so
[23:38] mindful Lord that when we get together
[23:40] Lord more of God is in this place
[23:43] Lord we don't try to figure it out we
[23:46] don't try to reason it out we just say
[23:49] Lord thank you thank you that you were
[23:52] mindful Lord that before even time began
[23:54] we were in your thoughts Lord and we got
[23:57] expressed through the spoken word and we
[23:59] just find ourselves right here now
[24:01] tonight all these lovely brothers and
[24:03] sisters that love you
[24:06] that seeking our answer from you that's
[24:08] that's coming for a question or a
[24:10] request Lord Jesus Lord you see where
[24:13] our pastor is even overseas now Lord
[24:15] today he will start preaching there and
[24:18] he will share the message with brother
[24:20] Pedro Lord and we know Lord you have
[24:22] called them to that assembly for a
[24:24] reason and they are faithful to the
[24:26] vision Lord and they walking now we just
[24:28] ask Lord that you would just be mindful
[24:30] of your servant father let his words not
[24:33] fall to the ground my lord lord May the
[24:35] words that he speaks set out and Achieve
[24:38] that which it has accomplished father
[24:39] and may that word not return to you void
[24:42] as well as tonight father it is not
[24:44] man's ideas I don't know the service
[24:47] will go Lord you know my heart I have
[24:49] prepared I've done all I can Lord but
[24:51] now we need you to speak my father so I
[24:54] pray that each one of us here in the Pew
[24:56] tonight each one year in the Church
[24:57] Father May our hearts be surrendered to
[25:00] what you want to say to us tonight
[25:02] and may we not leave your change in the
[25:04] name of our Lord Jesus Christ we pray
[25:06] amen amen musicians you can have your
[25:10] seat
[25:10] and all of us will still stand or you
[25:12] can stand but you can go that way I did
[25:15] it last time and everybody sat down kind
[25:18] of backfired of me children
[25:21] it's not communion
[25:25] so don't worry
[25:27] see look
[25:28] I can't fight it I like surprises I am I
[25:31] am the worst when it comes to surprises
[25:33] you know like at Christmas time when I
[25:35] still grew up I used to wrap my socks
[25:37] and put it under the Christmas tree so I
[25:39] have more gifts than everyone else I
[25:41] knew the weight of the gifts I knew the
[25:43] size of the gifts I knew which one
[25:45] rattled I knew which one made what funny
[25:47] sounds I knew everything about every
[25:49] gift under that tree because I'm very
[25:51] curious and I love it and it's a good
[25:54] way to be but it has a balance okay so
[25:58] you little ones when I open this up you
[26:00] can come to the front end and take a
[26:02] seat so you can see closer or if you
[26:04] want to sit where you are it's fine I
[26:05] mean the adults might just be a bit too
[26:07] tall and you can't see and so this is
[26:10] for you and adults this is for
[26:13] for us as well amen so let's go to
[26:16] Second uh well sorry first Peter and
[26:20] we're gonna go to First Peter or and the
[26:23] second chapter
[26:24] and we're going to start there from
[26:26] verse number five so second our first
[26:29] Peter second chapter verse number five
[26:32] so you children can come forward come
[26:40] now
[26:42] you wouldn't believe it what I was going
[26:44] to preach about about
[26:46] wisdom versus faith and I had it all
[26:49] figured out I got the whole sermon
[26:51] everything done man you should see this
[26:53] is so wonderful I've got everything set
[26:54] and I thought that's me
[26:56] and then the law dropped the sword into
[26:58] my heart and I thought if I don't speak
[27:00] about it right now I'll be very
[27:02] disobedient and I might get into trouble
[27:03] so I know what I know but I don't know
[27:06] how to put it together so please bear
[27:08] with me for this one as I believe is for
[27:10] us for now right now amen so it's not
[27:14] going to be a fighting sermon but we
[27:16] we're going to sober up a little bit
[27:18] he says thee in verse 5 he says he also
[27:20] as living stones are built upon the
[27:23] spiritual house a holy priesthood to
[27:27] offer a spiritual sacrifice as
[27:28] acceptable to God by Jesus Christ
[27:31] wherefore also it is contained in the
[27:35] scripture behold I lie in Zion a Chief
[27:37] Cornerstone elect precious and he that
[27:40] believeth amim shall not be confounded
[27:44] you and unto you therefore and I just
[27:47] want to say that that verse sixes you
[27:49] will never ever be disappointed in
[27:52] believing in the Lord Jesus Christ and
[27:54] serving him never
[27:56] amen unto you therefore which believe is
[27:59] is he precious but unto them which is
[28:02] disobedient the stone which the Buddhist
[28:04] disallowed the same is made the head of
[28:07] the corner
[28:08] and the stone of stumbling and a rock of
[28:11] offense even to them which stumble at
[28:13] the word
[28:14] so they stumble at the word they cannot
[28:17] take the full word there is something in
[28:19] them when the word comes they have to
[28:22] reject it
[28:23] they just have to because they take a
[28:25] offense
[28:26] so whatever you come with and I don't
[28:29] want to jump ahead but whatever comes to
[28:32] them becomes an offense it becomes a
[28:35] pushback it's not saying God can't deal
[28:37] with them but they'll really take a
[28:39] offense so the attitude of that person
[28:41] is the moment you say hey how about this
[28:45] they go
[28:46] it's a very bad place to be because you
[28:49] cut off Mercy there is a red line and
[28:51] you cut that off because you choose to
[28:53] stand on the wrong side of that long
[28:55] line willingly
[28:57] don't do that you know rather take it on
[29:00] the chin and go talk it out with our
[29:03] Lord Jesus Christ and do this because
[29:05] when you do that I'm telling you now
[29:07] there's a trial coming and that trial is
[29:10] going to be because you are a son and
[29:12] daughter of God God will get you in the
[29:13] place but he's going to take you through
[29:15] something to reveal to you himself so if
[29:18] ever you children Betty and mommy says
[29:21] to you something don't do that
[29:24] don't do it take it brother sisters
[29:28] taken and then if it if it burns you
[29:31] inside take it to the Lord and say Lord
[29:33] I don't understand this please show me
[29:36] and it will be a much different Road you
[29:38] walk than when you reject that word
[29:41] amen and the stone of stumbling and a
[29:44] rock of a fence
[29:45] even to them which stumble at the word
[29:48] being disobedient with also they were
[29:51] appointed but ye are a chosen generation
[29:55] a royal priesthood a holy nation A
[29:58] peculiar people that use you so forth
[30:01] the Praises of him that called you out
[30:03] of Darkness Into His Marvelous Light to
[30:07] show forth the Praises of him who called
[30:09] you and out of Darkness Into His
[30:12] Marvelous Light
[30:14] amen you may have your seats brothers
[30:17] and sisters which in times past were not
[30:20] a people but now are the people of God
[30:25] which God not obtained Mercy but now you
[30:28] have obtained mercy so there was
[30:30] something we were never really in the
[30:31] economy of God the Gentiles though he
[30:34] knew he was going to take a bride he
[30:36] dealt with Israel as a nation okay he
[30:38] deals with us as a person so now I want
[30:41] to say when God deals with you he ain't
[30:42] gonna deal with your mom and dad and the
[30:45] brother next to you and that one to give
[30:47] to you he's going to come to you
[30:49] personally but see he needs these things
[30:52] on the earth though he can speak through
[30:55] a tree he can speak through a wind
[30:56] brother Branham said he was there was a
[30:58] a whirlwind in the tree when he grew up
[31:01] and that will when there's a voice that
[31:03] came out of it and it scared him and he
[31:05] used to walk like miles around that tree
[31:07] because he got scared and he says don't
[31:08] defile your body so if God wants to
[31:11] speak to you he can but he does choose
[31:13] man and he's always done that but
[31:16] there's a thing that people Miss in this
[31:17] age God only reveals his word
[31:21] for that age to a prophet
[31:24] children I hope you understand what I
[31:27] say now God only reveals his word and
[31:31] puts you in time
[31:33] through a prophet doesn't do it any
[31:36] other way we'll never do it any other
[31:38] way that's how God does it he did it for
[31:40] Israel he will do it for us and he's
[31:42] going to do it being again for Israel so
[31:44] he cannot change the get God cannot
[31:46] change so brother Branham always said
[31:48] and I wonder if somebody can help me out
[31:49] God is the same
[31:53] today and forever so do you actually
[31:55] know what you're saying
[31:57] does it sink in
[32:00] so can God change his mind
[32:04] God
[32:06] but is God merciful
[32:08] so who knows what's a box law
[32:14] yeah raise up your hands okay that's
[32:16] fine so sometimes you don't get a box
[32:18] law but that you still deserve it
[32:21] though you did the wrong
[32:23] so you just you just found Mercy
[32:26] you should have got it but Dad said you
[32:28] know what do not we ain't gonna go there
[32:31] so I'm way off my notes but I've got I
[32:33] know the Lord has got this one just hang
[32:34] in there
[32:36] so sometimes we do something and we
[32:38] don't deserve it and we get punished how
[32:41] does that feel
[32:43] so we do something good and all of a
[32:45] sudden we're in trouble
[32:46] and you're like how did I get yeah I
[32:49] remember I was mowing the law loan one
[32:50] day I'll never forget it picked up a
[32:52] stone flicked it through a window my dad
[32:54] shall know because I got the hiding for
[32:55] that okay well pox law
[32:57] but I really didn't do it but all the
[32:59] other 150 times when the shot was done
[33:01] with a cricket ball I hit it through the
[33:03] window but this one time he gave me a
[33:06] hiding when I said it was really a
[33:08] lawnmower and he didn't believe me and I
[33:11] got one I was really offended because I
[33:13] didn't do it wrong
[33:15] but the other times I did something
[33:17] wrong I never got a hiding so do you
[33:18] think it's just balancing everything out
[33:21] so the Lord won't take you and not give
[33:23] ear and won't give here not and not give
[33:25] there he makes sure that everything's
[33:27] balances so if you ever owe somebody
[33:28] anything and you don't really know about
[33:30] it God will bring some way and somehow
[33:32] to balance it out okay he's always going
[33:34] to bring the balance that's our God but
[33:36] now we're going to talk tonight and we
[33:38] need a tea subject but I want to jump
[33:40] into this
[33:42] brother Branham says here in the
[33:44] anointed ones at the end time so I went
[33:46] and I wanted to talk to you tonight
[33:47] about Cora and dathan who knows that
[33:50] story
[33:51] okay
[33:53] the whole thing about Cora and Nathan is
[33:55] the chapter is
[33:57] this long
[33:59] 45 verses or 42 verses so if we really
[34:02] jump into that it's going to take a very
[34:04] long time so I thought I'll tell you the
[34:06] story but I'll give you some homework
[34:08] who likes homework
[34:11] yeah you'll be the first one I do not
[34:13] like homework okay homework is hard so
[34:17] you're going to find a story
[34:19] homework who likes homework
[34:22] Gabby you can do all my homework okay
[34:24] I'll give it to you freely
[34:26] in the Book of Numbers it's numbers and
[34:30] number
[34:31] 16. okay so number 16 is where we find a
[34:36] story and it has 50 verses to be honest
[34:39] to get to the right bottom of it but
[34:41] what I'm going to do is I'm going to
[34:42] quickly tell you the story because I
[34:43] actually want to come to this part but
[34:46] my whole theme for tonight is standing
[34:49] in the gap
[34:54] interceding on someone's behalf
[34:58] you know like in a nice way taking the
[35:01] punch when you were not supposed to take
[35:03] the punch
[35:04] being the less and not being the most I
[35:08] wonder who how many times do we have to
[35:10] Humble ourselves not to be the coolest
[35:12] you know and at this subject tonight is
[35:14] going to be very cool but we're going to
[35:16] we're going to put him through some
[35:17] trials okay amen
[35:19] and Marion is elected to be that this
[35:21] subject on his behalf
[35:24] I that just wonderful so here comes Cora
[35:27] and and
[35:29] um Nathan and Ian verse number 16 verses
[35:32] one to three it says now Korah and the
[35:35] sons of um uzar the sons of Korah the
[35:39] sons of the Levi and dathan and and uh
[35:42] Abram the sons of elab man these names A
[35:46] and on the sons of pileth the sons of
[35:50] Reuben took men and they rose up before
[35:52] Moses with a certain of the children of
[35:55] Israel 250.
[35:58] okay 250 princes of the assembly famous
[36:02] and in the congregation of men of renown
[36:06] so when they went to to Moses to go and
[36:10] murmur and complain
[36:12] they didn't just go and say hey okay
[36:15] listen oh yeah you don't like Moses I'll
[36:17] take you and you think he's not the only
[36:18] one and I'll take you no no no no they
[36:20] had a meeting
[36:22] and they got all the people that had a
[36:25] bit of ranking in Israel so these were I
[36:28] would say devout men but with Street
[36:30] Creed who knows what street cred is
[36:33] huh they had a bit of they had a bit of
[36:36] a a a uh how can I say a legacy to them
[36:39] people knew them they knew them because
[36:42] they said they were famous and renowned
[36:43] that means that when they walked down
[36:45] the street they said oh there goes
[36:47] brother cubain
[36:48] there goes brother Isaac he writes all
[36:50] those cool songs you know oh there he
[36:53] goes brother Ed he can lift the car
[36:55] with this Pinky
[36:57] you know like I'm just Hey listen I want
[36:59] to make it fun because if you go do this
[37:01] homework and you say Lord reveal it to
[37:02] me the attitude of these people when
[37:04] they went to Moses is they didn't go and
[37:07] say hey Moses we need your counsel about
[37:08] this they built their army
[37:11] and they were going to go to him and say
[37:14] Hey you are not the only Holy One
[37:17] that's exactly what happened there
[37:19] and how they go to the next part they
[37:21] say seemeth it but a small thing to you
[37:24] that God of Israel
[37:26] has separated you now remember they were
[37:29] Levites so they were serving in in God's
[37:32] house
[37:33] okay but they weren't the priesthood so
[37:36] if you remember our opening scripture
[37:38] said your a Royal
[37:41] you are different
[37:44] by default you're different your
[37:45] commission is different your position is
[37:47] different you're not the denomination
[37:49] you are actually a very important person
[37:52] and your job title is crucial to what
[37:56] you're going to do
[37:57] so you don't serve God you don't just
[38:00] Minister because the Levites was
[38:01] ministering in the house of God so they
[38:03] they were ministering the house of God
[38:05] and they were people that know the word
[38:06] but a priesthood is someone that the
[38:09] word goes through it's totally different
[38:12] so Aaron was the prophet he was the
[38:15] priesthood for that time and Moses was
[38:17] God because remember Moses God said to
[38:20] Moses you be God and Aaron be your
[38:22] prophet and you go into Egypt so now
[38:25] when they came out and they were leading
[38:26] God would speak first person to Moses
[38:29] and then says hey tell Aaron to go do
[38:31] that but see these people if you read
[38:34] that they had a problem with Aaron
[38:37] and they had a problem with Moses
[38:39] because every time Moses said thus say
[38:41] of the Lord
[38:43] then they said oh but who made you King
[38:45] and they say yeah they say this when
[38:48] they when they walked up to him and I'll
[38:49] go to that scripture and this is this is
[38:51] something that kind of burned me because
[38:52] the the whole point of the story and
[38:54] I'll try to go fast is they said to this
[38:58] they rose up against him and said and
[39:00] they all gathered themselves together
[39:01] against Moses verse 3 and against Aaron
[39:04] and they said unto him ye'd take too
[39:06] much upon you seeing all the
[39:08] congregation Are Holy
[39:10] what a bunch of Lies
[39:14] so we all are holy
[39:17] you know think about when you look at
[39:19] the nominations today you can be
[39:21] whatever you want to be
[39:23] I'm gonna go a little bit off an
[39:24] attention you can be whatever you can be
[39:26] a flower pot and call yourself a flower
[39:29] pot but as long as you love God you're
[39:31] okay
[39:33] you can reason all the colors of the
[39:35] rainbow we're all the the nose rings and
[39:38] earrings and things and everything you
[39:39] can do all that love God you'll be okay
[39:43] of course we're all holy what a lie a
[39:47] bunch of nonsense because Balaam started
[39:49] that lie
[39:51] and he was a prophet and he prophesied
[39:53] correct but he started to lie and they
[39:56] believed the lie and now they wanted to
[39:58] bring that lie under that 250 people to
[40:01] to Moses so that Moses would give them
[40:03] free Reign Over Israel and and brother
[40:05] Brennan picks it up and he says and I'm
[40:07] going to go to that quote now and he
[40:09] sees this I want you to hear how serious
[40:11] the God's Prophet was about this he says
[40:16] um oh you false teachers listening to
[40:18] these tapes all these years and seeing
[40:21] God confirm exactly what he said and in
[40:24] your study you know the truth and
[40:26] because of you the dominational
[40:27] differences you dispute them and tell
[40:30] the people they are not so
[40:33] saying that we're all holy but that's
[40:36] not for you and baptism in the name of
[40:38] Jesus Christ is not for you and days of
[40:40] Miracles are passed
[40:42] so then our friends and I'll leave that
[40:45] story right there because I want to get
[40:46] to this but I want to now say standing
[40:48] in the Gap follow my thought
[40:49] so people lie in the name of God and
[40:53] come with a lot of sincerity but they
[40:55] deny this the word of God they deny this
[40:59] because what they say is if God could
[41:02] speak to brother Branham then God could
[41:04] speak to me and I can show you the same
[41:06] Mysteries
[41:08] but that's not how God works it I hope
[41:10] you understand we needed a prophet in
[41:12] this age because the prophet pointed us
[41:15] back to
[41:16] the word of God
[41:18] there's no other way all the other
[41:20] denominations are sincere people the
[41:23] system is corrupt they're sincere people
[41:24] but but inside them say they're so
[41:27] confused that they're all all right and
[41:29] we're all going to go to heaven but
[41:31] there's judgment hanging over them
[41:34] and brother Branham says Balaam Anointed
[41:37] with the same Spirit was upon Moses what
[41:40] was the difference the teaching of Moses
[41:43] is perfect because God Vindicated it
[41:47] okay
[41:48] the Bible said in second Peter that the
[41:51] teaching of Balaam and Israel received
[41:53] and God never forget that Uncle
[41:57] most sin not one of them was saved they
[42:02] all had to come under the blessing of
[42:04] God see and at the hand of God they had
[42:07] to move by the mighty prophet and see it
[42:09] exactly Vindicated by God and because
[42:12] other Prophet came with the teaching
[42:14] country and disputed with Moses he tried
[42:17] to prove by the people that Moses was
[42:20] wrong and dathan and Korah and many of
[42:23] them agreed with him and taught the
[42:25] children to commit fornications to go
[42:28] after organizations and we are all the
[42:31] same
[42:32] that's what they said we're all holy
[42:35] but brother Branham sees this he says we
[42:38] are not the same
[42:40] you are a separated people wholly unto
[42:43] the Lord dedicated to the word and the
[42:46] spirit of God to bear fruit in his
[42:49] promise of this day you are not one of
[42:52] them you are I know it's awful strong
[42:55] but that is the truth just the same
[42:58] dedicate to a service in the last days
[43:01] come out amongst them
[43:04] now he says we dedicated for a service
[43:07] well so what means this we dedicated for
[43:10] a service so now I'm gonna I'm gonna
[43:11] need assistance from Brother Marion
[43:13] because um he said he will do it when he
[43:17] couldn't say he couldn't do it
[43:19] amen okay brother martin you could come
[43:23] I hope you're ready for this
[43:26] [Laughter]
[43:29] okay so now
[43:31] remember your friend Marion
[43:34] is in a denomination
[43:37] he must listen I'm not saying they're
[43:39] bad people I'm saying they're in a
[43:41] system where they're caught and in this
[43:44] system
[43:45] they truly think they know who they are
[43:49] okay I did ask brother keep in if I
[43:51] could put a cap on it brother could be
[43:53] and said it's fine so he knows who I am
[43:57] okay
[43:58] you know you are
[44:00] you okay so remember your denomination
[44:02] but now see look we are looking out from
[44:05] the inside we are those Eagles that's
[44:07] soaring up in the heavenlies that got
[44:09] the full word rev revealed to us what a
[44:12] privilege
[44:14] what a privilege do you have you
[44:16] actually know what the seals mean you
[44:19] know the E seals when I was in the
[44:21] seriously when I was in denomination a
[44:24] seal was something they out in the beach
[44:26] it goes or or I didn't even know what a
[44:28] seal in the book was I didn't even know
[44:30] the book was closed I don't even know
[44:32] the book was open instead I didn't even
[44:34] know what this book means of course
[44:36] Samson was just a story
[44:39] okay Daniel in the Lion's Den are come
[44:42] on
[44:43] but I never understood the anointing of
[44:45] God but it took a prophet to come and
[44:48] tell me but wait there's more and if you
[44:50] listen to the prayer lines where brother
[44:51] Branham goes and starts Discerning and
[44:53] God works through brother Branham not
[44:55] brother Branham God works through the
[44:58] prophet and start Discerning the
[44:59] thoughts and intent of heart you would
[45:01] know who stepped on that that platform
[45:05] it was deity and he would tell people
[45:07] you that standing here do you feel that
[45:09] presence that's not me that is him okay
[45:13] so now we've got this we got the whole
[45:16] word okay but this man unfortunately
[45:19] because he's so cool
[45:22] he's blinded
[45:24] sorry Marion
[45:26] you must tell me if you're totally
[45:28] blinded
[45:29] okay
[45:32] wait wait we have to open that up can
[45:35] you breathe
[45:36] okay are you blind yeah yeah can you see
[45:39] my hand
[45:40] oh no okay sorry don't worry and
[45:44] he still thinks he's cool
[45:47] okay
[45:48] he's still cool because I can do
[45:51] whatever I want
[45:53] okay
[45:54] because I know who I am
[45:57] but there's another thing this man is
[45:59] also Bound by traditions and laws of men
[46:03] and false doctrines and these guys that
[46:06] just don't want to see eye to eye
[46:08] because one doesn't believe in one God
[46:10] and the other one believes in three and
[46:12] the other one believes in 150 and all
[46:15] those things and the denominations all
[46:16] know what they know when one sees it's
[46:18] the Apostles Creed and the other one
[46:19] says sprinkling by water so all these
[46:23] rules
[46:24] got this man
[46:26] died down
[46:27] Marion remember all those hunting trips
[46:31] you take me on
[46:33] and the suffering I had to endure for
[46:35] you
[46:37] foreign
[46:40] and because it's in the service
[46:45] because you're bound by traditions and
[46:47] laws of men
[46:49] okay who can help me bind this guy come
[46:52] here come here I want to listen come
[46:55] turn him around avika hold on hold on
[46:57] keep cut keep turning this guy yes turn
[47:00] turn he does just just he just feels so
[47:03] free still tell me when you feel like a
[47:05] restricted a bit okay keep going baby
[47:06] keep going keep going I'm not running
[47:09] out of the Rope yet yes he's good
[47:11] okay now I'll have to find a town down
[47:13] Point okay cool thanks Apes so how does
[47:16] that feel
[47:18] you feel a bit tied up hey I luckily I
[47:21] can't make not so whoever's going to
[47:23] free you after this I don't know how
[47:24] it's gonna go but amen you know what
[47:26] just sit still and now just to make sure
[47:29] you don't really know where you are
[47:31] because guess what
[47:33] the prophet never showed you which age
[47:35] you're in
[47:37] so you know you're going to heaven but
[47:38] you just don't know when you don't know
[47:40] when he was coming down you don't know
[47:42] where you are you don't know even where
[47:43] the Rapture is but guess what we're
[47:46] pointing in the right direction
[47:48] now
[47:51] we're gonna do some experimenting
[47:55] with Prada Marion
[47:57] okay but now you are an intercessor
[48:01] you are my gods in diseases
[48:05] so you're gonna have to use your tools
[48:07] you're gonna have to use the sermon
[48:09] you're gonna have to make sure that what
[48:11] is coming now towards this Marion
[48:14] is good for him because guess what you
[48:16] looking out for your brother
[48:18] he might be bound can you put that
[48:21] picture up
[48:22] he might be confused
[48:25] he might be all bound up in everything
[48:27] he looks like that
[48:29] boy there
[48:31] I want you to get a burden for what
[48:33] we're facing because I think people
[48:34] think this is a game I know I make
[48:36] illustrations but I want you to
[48:38] understand there is children your age
[48:41] out there
[48:43] that spiritually is looking like that
[48:45] alone
[48:47] don't know where they are don't know
[48:49] where they're going don't even know the
[48:52] next meal don't don't know who's God
[48:54] don't know if he's a God or not they
[48:57] actually have no idea where they're at
[49:01] but there's you
[49:03] these these you
[49:06] and when you read that scripture when it
[49:08] says you're a royal priesthood he says
[49:11] he at the end he says
[49:14] having your uh it says here in verse 9
[49:17] it says and the chosen Jesus generation
[49:18] royal priesthood the holy night and a
[49:20] peculiar people
[49:22] which should sow forth the praises to
[49:24] Him that call you out of Darkness where
[49:26] this man was unto His Marvelous Light
[49:31] and you have obtained Mercy
[49:34] dearly beloved I beseech you as
[49:36] strangers and pilgrims abstained from
[49:38] fleecially lust that Wars against the
[49:40] soul so there's a expectation from you
[49:44] as a believer in Christ
[49:46] to help this man which thinks he knows
[49:49] who he is
[49:50] the coolest dude on the Block tied up in
[49:53] sin he doesn't have a way out he doesn't
[49:55] know the way out so now we're going to
[49:57] reveal to you what he's going to eat
[49:59] because you know what I believe
[50:02] is you are
[50:03] what you eat
[50:06] so how many of you
[50:09] and this is a personal question how many
[50:12] of you
[50:13] is reading your Bible every day do not
[50:15] answer me
[50:17] how many of you is feeding off the word
[50:20] every day
[50:22] every day
[50:24] how many
[50:25] how many doesn't just pray and talk to
[50:28] God but actually has a relationship to
[50:30] God
[50:31] so we're going to start with this one I
[50:33] want you to say loud no if I can give it
[50:36] to him or not
[50:39] the deal is it is sweet in your mouth
[50:41] and bitter in your belly
[50:44] listen to me it needs to go in his mouth
[50:48] and it needs to be able to make it to
[50:50] your belly belly so I'll explain it to
[50:52] you I just want a loud yes or no can we
[50:56] give it to him
[50:57] to eat
[50:59] to eat
[51:01] should we try
[51:03] should we not try
[51:07] it it looks like open your mouth
[51:10] yeah it's big enough no
[51:13] so we can't give him this okay okay I'll
[51:16] explain it after I told him what he's
[51:17] going to eat because I don't want to
[51:18] spoil it for him but can we give him
[51:20] this
[51:23] oh really it do you know what this is
[51:26] oh yeah so Mario is feeling very so I
[51:30] can give him this one
[51:32] I want to give him this one
[51:35] Marian
[51:36] if I say to you they don't want you to
[51:39] eat this would you want to eat it
[51:43] so is that your final answer do you want
[51:45] to find a friend
[51:48] you are correct you cannot eat that it's
[51:51] rubbish it's garbage it's social media
[51:54] it is the worst form of anything you can
[51:57] sit on your phone the whole day long and
[51:59] eat and eat and eat and eat and eat but
[52:02] Jesus says here and Jesus said unto them
[52:04] very verily I say unto you
[52:09] you say Moses gave you not the bread
[52:12] from heaven but my father giveth it to
[52:15] you the true bread from heaven
[52:17] for the bread of God is which cometh
[52:19] down from heaven and given life unto all
[52:22] the unto the world
[52:24] then he said to them Evermore give us
[52:26] this bread
[52:28] and Jesus said to him I am the bread
[52:33] okay so do you want to take a hoppy
[52:37] or do you trust me

[53:52] so I need you guys he looks thirsty

[55:17] okay
[55:18] so now Ephesians 5. it says here for
[55:23] husbands is the head of the wife and
[55:25] Christ is the head of the church and
[55:28] um and he is the savior of the body amen
[55:31] there as the church is subject unto
[55:33] Christ so let your wives be unto the
[55:36] husbands and everything husbands love
[55:38] your wives and Christ also love the
[55:40] church and give give himself for it that
[55:43] ye might Sanctified and be cleansed with
[55:46] the washing of the water of the
[55:50] I gained this this one

[56:00] okay I'm not saying don't drink it don't
[56:03] don't
[56:04] hold on here
[56:06] I'm just saying is there is much better
[56:09] things to drink out there it is still
[56:12] your choice what you drink and what you
[56:14] put in but all of us agree that this is
[56:17] good for him
[56:18] so you have to go against that to say
[56:21] this is not good for you and then still
[56:23] do it so against the word amen and I'm
[56:26] talking spiritual I hope your spiritual
[56:28] caps are on

[1:00:03] that the love may abound yet more and
[1:00:06] more knowledge and enjoy in all judgment
[1:00:09] that ye may approve things and have um
[1:00:12] that are excellent and that they may be
[1:00:15] sincere and without offense till the day
[1:00:18] of Christ being filled with the fruits
[1:00:20] of righteousness which is which are by
[1:00:23] Jesus Christ unto the glory and praise
[1:00:26] of God

[1:00:32] peace long-suffering gentleness goodness
[1:00:34] Faith meekness Temperance and against
[1:00:36] such is no
[1:00:38] law
[1:00:39] okay Samarian you dodge the bullet demon
[1:00:42] I was going to give you a tennis ball
[1:00:45] so the wonderful thing is we could have
[1:00:47] given him this tennis ball
[1:00:50] which people run up and down the track
[1:00:52] the whole day fall
[1:00:54] they make these funny sounds when they
[1:00:55] hear it as well he's like karate okay
[1:00:59] and they get millions of dollars doing
[1:01:01] this and they are super cool
[1:01:05] but it's still
[1:01:08] a tennis ball
[1:01:10] thank you brother it's a tennis ball
[1:01:12] it's not going to get you one iota
[1:01:14] closer to God
[1:01:16] not one in fact you're gonna practice
[1:01:19] and you're gonna be so dedicated to that
[1:01:22] little green ball
[1:01:24] that is going to take you further away
[1:01:25] from God
[1:01:26] I'm not saying tennis on a Saturday is
[1:01:29] wrong get the balance guys
[1:01:31] I say if that is what you're eating and
[1:01:34] what you're feeding off and what all is
[1:01:36] just there by you is this is all you can
[1:01:39] see is playing this game and you make it
[1:01:42] all that you have
[1:01:43] guess what you'll never be the fruits of
[1:01:47] the spirit because you're bearing the
[1:01:49] fruits of the world because this is only
[1:01:51] entertainment same as the tablet
[1:01:54] amen we're almost there guys
[1:01:57] now this one I'm gonna need some super
[1:01:59] discernment I might even call a deacons
[1:02:03] helping
[1:02:04] this is a glass of something
[1:02:07] one you're gonna drink
[1:02:10] a one you're gonna eat
[1:02:16] so if you should choose
[1:02:21] this is not a three question
[1:02:23] what is your heart's desire my brother
[1:02:26] right your left or my left your right
[1:02:31] okay your lift so which is this side
[1:02:34] okay
[1:02:36] so everybody do we want to give Mario on
[1:02:41] this one
[1:02:42] or do we want to give Marion this one
[1:02:46] [Music]
[1:02:48] yeah
[1:02:49] this is South African thing
[1:02:51] okay Marion
[1:02:53] all the people say you can have what's
[1:02:55] in my left hand which is either one's
[1:02:57] the right hand I always get it confused
[1:03:00] do you want my left hand
[1:03:02] or do you want my right hand
[1:03:06] okay
[1:03:07] now this one is going to be a little bit
[1:03:09] tough because sometimes
[1:03:11] you just have to chew the fat can you
[1:03:13] bite there for me can you get in there
[1:03:15] can you can you try to get that come on
[1:03:17] come on just go halfway get in there
[1:03:20] you just dragged me up a hill to go get
[1:03:22] this thing you might as well just eat it
[1:03:25] he's struggling okay wait wait take this
[1:03:28] one this is a better one leave that one
[1:03:29] leave it take that one bite scrape it
[1:03:32] off what do you think this is
[1:03:35] ah there we go
[1:03:37] what do you want some more
[1:03:40] hey man of course where the carcasses is
[1:03:44] the Eagles gather okay so we don't want
[1:03:48] some semi-skimmed milk
[1:03:52] that has been pasteurized and
[1:03:55] digitalized and watered down water
[1:03:58] because used to when I shake milk it
[1:04:00] actually had a bit of a layer of cream
[1:04:01] that's all gone now it's just so been
[1:04:04] processed that is not good for you it's
[1:04:06] skimmed milk it's this God loves you
[1:04:12] oh and if he loves you you can do
[1:04:14] whatever you want as long as you say I'm
[1:04:16] sorry
[1:04:17] he'll forgive you because he's just
[1:04:20] and it's true
[1:04:22] he will forgive you
[1:04:24] but not if you keep on doing what you're
[1:04:26] doing
[1:04:28] but good meat a sound Doctrine
[1:04:31] means that there is something more in
[1:04:33] you that will ground you to the word not
[1:04:37] some fairy tales and some hallelujahs
[1:04:40] and a fancy song on YouTube
[1:04:42] okay all Hillsong songs and all those
[1:04:45] things if you only live by songs you
[1:04:47] won't get anywhere let me tell you if
[1:04:49] most of your day is spinning listening
[1:04:51] to music
[1:04:53] and not reading your Bible you are going
[1:04:56] into the tribulation
[1:04:59] brother Bradham said the spirit of rock
[1:05:01] and roll is going to lead that that
[1:05:04] people into the tribulation and the
[1:05:06] spirit of rock and roll is in music so
[1:05:08] if you find yourself only listening to
[1:05:11] music and all the other stuff even if
[1:05:13] it's Godly music and you don't feed off
[1:05:16] the word and you don't take sound
[1:05:18] Doctrine and you don't know why the
[1:05:19] prophet said what is Satan's seed
[1:05:23] and where he begins and how he goes
[1:05:25] through the lineages and why the seven
[1:05:27] Messengers and why was one sent to you
[1:05:29] if you don't go and look for it in the
[1:05:32] message you don't get anywhere because
[1:05:34] you're not feeding and giving substance
[1:05:37] for what's coming and this is what's the
[1:05:39] problem with these guys
[1:05:42] is they can't take sound Doctrine
[1:05:45] because it goes against their reasoning
[1:05:47] of course we like to reason God away
[1:05:51] I can't just accept baptism in the name
[1:05:53] of Jesus Christ I can't just accept it
[1:05:56] in the Garden of Eden it wasn't an apple
[1:05:57] that she ate it was a sex deed I can't
[1:06:00] accept it because it doesn't fall with
[1:06:02] my pastor
[1:06:04] but I would like to tell you that that
[1:06:06] Pastor is not going to stand right next
[1:06:08] to you at the day of judgment you alone
[1:06:10] will
[1:06:12] so it's maybe time we start eating some
[1:06:14] meat getting some substance
[1:06:17] amen okay we're almost there now Mario
[1:06:22] you're getting a fiery trial right now
[1:06:27] so
[1:06:28] this is my next ones
[1:06:33] but this is not a choice
[1:06:37] this is not a choice I want to shake
[1:06:39] this man out of this condition
[1:06:42] so me as God we say and I don't say I'm
[1:06:45] God just give me I'm representing just
[1:06:47] just follow the thought line I want my
[1:06:50] child to return back to me
[1:06:53] but see the bride is not doing a job by
[1:06:56] starting to talk to this person
[1:06:58] but now we are now we're starting to
[1:07:00] realize hey that breed is good for me
[1:07:03] the water is good for me the V Energy
[1:07:05] Drink is not going to cut it and as the
[1:07:08] preaching comes and as you fellowship
[1:07:09] with his brother
[1:07:11] not enemy you start washing him you
[1:07:14] start sanctifying him you start
[1:07:16] cleansing him because God is working
[1:07:18] through you with all your little friends
[1:07:19] at school
[1:07:21] when you say I love Jesus I follow Jesus
[1:07:24] there was a prophet in this day he told
[1:07:27] us how to overcome you don't have to say
[1:07:28] it like that just hear me out but you're
[1:07:30] going to have to stand for something
[1:07:32] because someone wants to see something
[1:07:34] real
[1:07:35] and when you say and when he listens to
[1:07:38] reggae Christian music or
[1:07:41] what does that other one that's so
[1:07:43] atrocious
[1:07:44] um
[1:07:46] rap Christian music for real life man
[1:07:50] rap Christian music
[1:07:52] rap comes out of the pit of Hell it has
[1:07:55] got nothing to do with God there is no
[1:07:58] such thing as rap and Christian music
[1:08:00] the spirit on that is epic devil
[1:08:03] everything amen
[1:08:05] because the spirit wants to have anger
[1:08:08] and aggression and all those things and
[1:08:10] then he thinks I love God sounds to me
[1:08:12] like Satan way back in the Garden of
[1:08:13] Eden
[1:08:14] even in heaven before he said oh you
[1:08:16] know I love God but hey guys follow me
[1:08:18] because I'm more beautiful that's rap
[1:08:20] but I thought this trial might not be
[1:08:22] fiery enough who wants to give Marion
[1:08:25] this
[1:08:27] who wants to because we want to shake
[1:08:30] him out of his condition okay so we
[1:08:33] really want to give him this we want to
[1:08:34] give him something hey do you know
[1:08:37] that in the Garden of Eden if it wasn't
[1:08:40] an apple
[1:08:41] that's this
[1:08:44] okay so but I thought of course it's
[1:08:46] Marion and he drags me up deals and he
[1:08:49] makes my legs hurt and he laughs and
[1:08:51] enjoys it with me
[1:08:52] I thought this one would be better
[1:08:58] Marion
[1:09:00] I want to get you just a little bit
[1:09:03] closer to the Lord
[1:09:04] and what I thought
[1:09:06] is this the right size
[1:09:08] yeah oh okay we see no no real no real
[1:09:11] compassion but hey it's the only one I
[1:09:13] can see so or maybe we can give him one
[1:09:16] of these
[1:09:17] how's that sir no okay I don't want to
[1:09:20] be like that okay Marion Here Comes Your
[1:09:22] trial
[1:09:23] your trial is fiery
[1:09:26] your trial is fiery
[1:09:29] and in this trial I want you to realize
[1:09:32] that I have called now and said my son
[1:09:35] stop your shenanigans
[1:09:38] okay
[1:09:39] you have had the word I want you to
[1:09:41] follow don't don't think about the
[1:09:43] moment now you had your word
[1:09:46] I'm speaking to you every day
[1:09:48] it's sweet in your mouth
[1:09:51] in your belly
[1:09:53] and sometimes you're just gonna have to
[1:09:55] take it if it's nice or not Marion can
[1:09:59] you sing this one away
[1:10:01] deep breathe bro
[1:10:04] how does that feel
[1:10:10] fiery
[1:10:11] now you would say I'm cruel
[1:10:14] you would say Hey brother man that's
[1:10:16] pretty cruel
[1:10:18] this man is look he's going I can take
[1:10:20] that off now Marion you know what you
[1:10:22] started to seeing like hey something
[1:10:23] else is going on in this trial
[1:10:26] okay I'm starting to realize that hey
[1:10:29] maybe I'm not all by myself and all
[1:10:31] these guys got me
[1:10:33] okay
[1:10:34] please follow me don't lose the thought
[1:10:36] now I'm really starting to know who I am
[1:10:41] okay
[1:10:42] and these little doctrines that the the
[1:10:44] guys say Hey you believe this and you
[1:10:46] believe that and you do this and you do
[1:10:48] that and you'll be saved it's nonsense
[1:10:50] because you know what the more than
[1:10:52] Marion is eating this word the more he's
[1:10:54] starting to realize
[1:10:55] that he is actually a free man
[1:10:59] but now I'm giving Mario on something
[1:11:01] else and say Mario and you just went
[1:11:03] through a trial bro
[1:11:04] and this trial was not nice was it
[1:11:07] like when I had to walk up that hill to
[1:11:09] try to shoot that deer right on the top
[1:11:11] remember that
[1:11:12] but guess what I learned from that trial
[1:11:15] Marion
[1:11:16] that there was a very nice reward at the
[1:11:18] end of that trial
[1:11:20] and you really and truly do know who you
[1:11:23] are you're a righteous Son of God God
[1:11:25] bless you
[1:11:26] can have a seat
[1:11:28] [Applause]
[1:11:30] now Marion I didn't forget about you
[1:11:33] I've got one test for you
[1:11:35] God is great
[1:11:37] now I want to tell you
[1:11:40] would you like some of this
[1:11:43] would you like some of that
[1:11:45] but I'm gonna say I'm gonna get your
[1:11:47] friends to talk to you so
[1:11:50] hey guys
[1:11:52] who wants to give money on this to eat
[1:11:58] shame of you if you said he has to eat
[1:12:01] it no Marion
[1:12:02] your best friend
[1:12:04] again
[1:12:05] says you shall eat it
[1:12:08] do you want to eat that or do you want
[1:12:09] to eat this
[1:12:12] amen
[1:12:13] amen so Mario on your knees what you
[1:12:16] bypass the trial
[1:12:18] and you just got honey that was on the
[1:12:20] Rock might take a while to come out
[1:12:22] because it looks like it's all hard but
[1:12:23] I'm gonna give you a little bit of this
[1:12:25] anyways because it will chase them that
[1:12:29] it's coming hold on guys pause for
[1:12:32] effect
[1:12:33] sometimes God's blessings take a time to
[1:12:36] get to you
[1:12:37] and you don't always understand why it
[1:12:39] takes so long because that other brother
[1:12:40] is just refusing to bring it to you
[1:12:42] straight away
[1:12:43] and you go God I don't understand this
[1:12:45] brother but man I'm just gonna love him
[1:12:47] anyways and everything he does for me
[1:12:50] tonight was not nice but you know what I
[1:12:53] know this uh
[1:12:55] expected end for me here you go Marion
[1:12:57] God bless you
[1:13:00] and now finish
[1:13:04] Marion
[1:13:06] was like that boy can you put that photo
[1:13:08] up again please
[1:13:11] that boy
[1:13:13] cannot see past his own eyes
[1:13:16] he's sitting in a straight jacket
[1:13:21] and his friends are enjoying it
[1:13:25] he's in pain
[1:13:27] he's crying out to God and His Friends
[1:13:30] that has the truth
[1:13:32] goes to him every day to school
[1:13:36] every day at work with him
[1:13:40] they're the best friend what he has on
[1:13:42] the soccer team on a Saturday
[1:13:44] they play cricket with him
[1:13:48] they don't go to the movies with him
[1:13:50] because they stand for something
[1:13:52] they don't drink with him
[1:13:55] they don't do what he does
[1:13:57] but they they
[1:14:00] how many of us
[1:14:03] really understands the responsibility
[1:14:05] that God has placed upon this children
[1:14:07] this royal priesthood
[1:14:11] so I'll explain this
[1:14:14] got swallowed up in the ground they're
[1:14:16] gone
[1:14:17] families all things
[1:14:20] Moses cried out before they go he says
[1:14:22] Lord just be merciful
[1:14:23] Ken you can't just kill everyone for one
[1:14:27] person
[1:14:28] Heart of Jesus Christ in him
[1:14:31] he says be merciful don't swallow them
[1:14:33] up
[1:14:34] he says okay you go back to the
[1:14:36] congregation and you tell that
[1:14:37] congregation to separate yourself from
[1:14:40] what they doing
[1:14:42] I hope you have your spiritual caps on
[1:14:44] children don't fall asleep now to
[1:14:47] separate yourself from what they doing
[1:14:49] because I'm gonna swallow them up
[1:14:52] so he goes back to the congregation and
[1:14:54] he warns them
[1:14:57] he rewards them he says guys there's a
[1:15:00] Rapture coming but with that Rapture as
[1:15:03] a Great Tribulation
[1:15:05] get out of the world and get into Christ
[1:15:11] and it came with thus save the Lord with
[1:15:13] healing in his wings
[1:15:15] and it was Vindicated and Vindicated and
[1:15:19] Vindicated and Vindicated and proven and
[1:15:22] proven and they didn't listen
[1:15:25] but these guys did listen
[1:15:27] and they came away from Quran Nathan
[1:15:32] and then the ground swallowed them up
[1:15:34] and then God says to Moses he says now
[1:15:37] Aaron will be the only one that can make
[1:15:40] intercession for these people placing
[1:15:43] him again in the priesthood position
[1:15:45] where he belongs Where We Are
[1:15:50] then the next day the people come back
[1:15:52] after this massive event and they start
[1:15:55] fighting with Aaron and Moses again and
[1:15:58] they say to him and go read it go read
[1:16:00] your Bible
[1:16:01] and they go to him and say you have
[1:16:04] brought us here to die
[1:16:05] you promised us that you will take us
[1:16:08] into the Promised Land
[1:16:09] we haven't seen the promised land
[1:16:11] because they're still dealing in the
[1:16:12] carnal realm they're not seeing what God
[1:16:14] is showing them okay
[1:16:17] so they're not looking at your friends
[1:16:18] as friends that is that maybe a love
[1:16:20] gift to God
[1:16:22] a child of God they're just seeing them
[1:16:24] as a friend
[1:16:28] and then God comes down into the
[1:16:30] Tabernacle and Moses and arrow goes
[1:16:33] stand Aaron because stands in front of
[1:16:34] the Tabernacle and God speaks to them
[1:16:36] and he says to them I'm going to kill
[1:16:38] them I'm going to destroy them all
[1:16:41] and the plague starts
[1:16:44] and Moses has the heart of Christ again
[1:16:46] and he grabs Aaron and he says take the
[1:16:49] the
[1:16:50] um the same the what do they call it the
[1:16:53] sensor take the fire off the Altar and
[1:16:56] run in the midst of the people and go
[1:16:58] make intercession for them
[1:17:00] and the plague stops
[1:17:04] rather being preached about it it made
[1:17:05] the biggest impression in my life about
[1:17:07] it never forget it
[1:17:09] if you want the plague of death in this
[1:17:11] world to stop
[1:17:13] you better be closer to your friends
[1:17:14] than ever
[1:17:15] you must pray for them
[1:17:17] you must ask God for them no well you
[1:17:20] prayed for your brother
[1:17:22] you pray for your sisters
[1:17:24] that is our duty that's why we're here
[1:17:27] there's no other reason why the children
[1:17:29] of God is on this Earth you didn't come
[1:17:31] here to have a great time though we have
[1:17:33] a great time
[1:17:35] we came here because God placed us here
[1:17:38] because he's going to use you to get
[1:17:40] someone into the kingdom of God you need
[1:17:43] to pray about it you need to read your
[1:17:45] word and you need to say to them have
[1:17:47] you seen
[1:17:49] and have you taste that the Lord is good
[1:17:53] and if you can do it then you are in
[1:17:55] your position
[1:17:57] and God can use you don't worry about
[1:17:59] how you're going to do it as long as
[1:18:01] you're available God will use you he
[1:18:04] doesn't say are you able he said are you
[1:18:06] available
[1:18:08] but most of the time all our nice
[1:18:10] friends that we have in the world and
[1:18:12] I've got heaps of them
[1:18:13] it's like Marion was here all tied up
[1:18:16] so blind by all this nonsense of
[1:18:19] doctrines and I can't pray for this one
[1:18:21] and this one believes that and you have
[1:18:22] the truth right in your hand right in
[1:18:25] your hand
[1:18:26] and say hey
[1:18:27] let's start just at the beginning of the
[1:18:29] book do you know that you were in the
[1:18:31] thoughts of God before you even set the
[1:18:33] first words

[1:19:08] friend because you have no nutrients
[1:19:10] within yourself to be able to give to
[1:19:13] your friend

[1:26:14] to be a different type of people a royal
[1:26:18] priesthood A peculiar people Lord that
[1:26:21] is not like the world that has joy
[1:26:23] unspeakable and full of glory Lord that
[1:26:26] knows that our God can heal that knows
[1:26:29] that Faith Lord is the substance and the
[1:26:31] evidence of things unseen that knows
[1:26:33] that when we claim a promise on your
[1:26:34] word father it will be done
[1:26:37] Lord we are that type of people we know
[1:26:40] as well Lord that every conversation is
[1:26:42] recorded my Lord and every conversation

[1:26:54] or sister or anybody in the world that's
[1:26:56] angry without and rough with us Lord
[1:26:58] they were the same with you when you
[1:27:00] were here because they couldn't take
[1:27:02] that word but may a soft answer turn
[1:27:05] away that wrath

[1:27:52] always remember the vision that the
[1:27:54] prophet told us he said the bride was in
[1:27:57] step

[1:28:37] air and we see that little bit further
[1:28:39] in our brother and sister but Lord
