free a man a man we just want to appreciate brother Paul for the you require a family for a great little song service there and you know we may be we're doing our best to continue on you know utilizing this technology and you know I believe that we can have a glorious time amen we you guys I'm sure most of you were involved with the meetings over the weekend and we were just having such a tremendous time you know it was just like you know it was almost like a normal service I mean in this room we had the glory of God and it was such a good time we were really enjoying our time and it was it was just tremendous and so you know at least just have an expectation because it's really based on what we expect and so I just want to encourage you tonight to just have an expectation from the Lord that he will meet your needs the Lord is he's the word the word can discern our hearts and so you know just as much as he did it in the prophets discernment line the same word is with us tonight end can tell you the secrets of your heart a man I'm I'm just I'm just your brother but you know the word of the Lord is still the same Amen I mean still discern our heart so I just want to encourage you to just welcome the Lord to your to your to your chair or wherever you're at in your roots and your and your living areas I just want to you just want to encourage you just to invite the the Lord and I believe that he will meet you where you're at and you can leave this you know this this meeting that we have now you can be changed the Lord can meet your needs and I believe he will I really believe that he's got he wants to minister to us and just he wants us to continue on the journey and just to continue along the exhortation and encouragement that we've received over the weekend amen so I don't want to go too much in a preamble here but I just want to also just be I'm very grateful because you know this is if I'm remembering right Lee which is probably not but I believe that this is probably the first time I think I've ministered near Easter so I'm going to take my Liberty to preach on the resurrection meaning you know because it's such a powerful subject you know the resurrection in a mailer so we're so moved by this resurrection amen hallelujah well a man with that let's just what we'll do is we'll just stand and then we'll turn to John chapter 16 verse 20 and then and the subject I want to approach here this evening if I want to if we could put a title there is and they rose up in the same hour and we'll get our text from the second reading but I just want to just give that the title before we read so we can read with the correct context and I want to explore the journey of going from disappointment to divine appointment amen go from disappointment to divine appointment amen hallelujah so John 16 verse 20 is here barely barely I say unto you that you shall weep and lament but the world shall rejoice and ye shall be sorrowful but your sorrow shall be turned into joy a man who believes that this evening amen they that sow in tears shall reap and toward Lord Jesus I pray you and your blessing to the reading of your word and I just ask you just speak to us now father we just yield ourselves and ask Lord Jesus for a special blessing over the word and that you administer to our hearts Lord I pray father that the burden that you have for us and be the the very essence of the thought that you've inspired to us Lord Jesus would be a delivered and would be given to the bride and we would receive it by faith Lord tonight my faith Lord we believe Lord that you will minister to our and just take over this meeting Lord in Jesus Christ's name Amen amen you know the Lord comes to bring us from a poor sad disconnected condition into an emotional connection of joy in the Lord that we may rise and his joy to be at the resurrection so let's think that's the that's my little paragraph I've written in my notes just to to tie the context together the Lord comes to bring us from a poor and sad disconnected condition just connect that into an emotional connection we need to be emotionally connected to this of joy and delight in the Lord that we may rise in his joy to bear witness of the resurrection amen amen the resurrection that verses amen the resurrection that was a glorious resurrection but we need this resurrection to come into our own personal bubble amen we speak of family bubbles you know they had these bubbles they're talking about well my got resurrection and resurrection amen and I believe I'm speaking to a people who have has resurrection and their family bubble amen there is a resurrection verses and that is going on right now I want to turn now to Luke chapter 24 amen and we want to read from verse 28 down to 35 it says here you know I want this is where I got the context in and 2i there is a few things that I heard over the weekend which was really it inspired me so much and I thought mine you know this is this this must really read the scripture I this very sentence just spoke to me and I the Lord just kind of impressed that upon the area to to to take the subject here so this is and they drew nigh unto the village whether they went and he made as though he had gone further but they constrain him saying and by with us for as towards evening and the day is far spent and he went in to tarry with them so you notice they actually they they they constrain them to come in i man and and I encourage you now like in your ruse wherever you're at whatever condition you made and be ill or whatever you're going through you know the Lord is the same you know and he's the Lord's got a lot to do you know there's a lot of things doing right now so you know there's a lot of people that is pulling at him there's a lot of people praying there's a lot of people will need and so there's people that are is a fervent ineffectual prayer going to the Lord all over simultaneously it never ends it's always towards him there is a people that as as that as fervent here as a people that is constraining the Lord amen and I just encourage you what need you have right now I encourage you to constrain him because you see the Lord will not leave us in that condition if it's not the right condition he wants us to be in a good condition he wants us to be connected he wants us to be emotionally healthy he wants us to have feelings he wants us to have empathy he wants to be in the vision he wants us to be part of the vision doesn't want us to be isolated he doesn't want us to be an emotional disconnecting state and he wants us to be he wants us to have the joy of the Lord no matter what's happening no matter what storms we may be facing no matter what the the trauma of the past or whatever it may be the Lord wants us and has made provision for us to be connected and I'll show you here because it's very important here let me just continue reading it says here that they constrained him saying abide with us this evening and the day is fast bent amen can you say amen to that the day is fast been there's nearly time to go into Terry was there a man I'm so glad than a sister and it came to pass as he said it meet with him he took the bread amen it's normally when you get a visitor that you do the bread but right now you see him break the bread and watch what happens hallelujah amen amen amen so he says here and he said it me and he took the bread and blessed it and broke it and gave it to him hallelujah have you cleared that the word has been open and the seals have been broken and it's been given to you amen hey you have an on you have an unending an unending relentless powerful Seventh Seal meal to head all the time no matter where you are you can happen and you can drink and you can drink amen so and their eyes was open amen and their eyes were opened and they knew him and he vanished out of their sight maybe something happens to them they were impacted by by this reality that came to me that something took place for them and I believe that tonight maybe you're going through something that you need something to take place for you you see the Lord is here to meet that need the Lord is here to deliver the Lord is here to heal amen hello lujah and he says here and and and the eyes was open and they knew him and he vanished out of his sight man hallelujah and and they said one to another did not a heart burn within us while he talked with us and by the way and while he opened to us the scriptures come a billion Mariners and here this is that this is now where I get this thought from and they rose up the same hour amen it was something that took place in these people amen they were not happy before the seamen they were they were on a course to a complete emotional disconnection from reality they were being deep now I'm going to read a little bit I've been reading a little bit on history or probably know I've been reading a ton of them a bit of psychology just to understand my emotional disconnection and some abilities and I'm going to tie it into the Bible I'm gonna tie it because there's a lot of scriptural parallel so but you see these people wave they were so down they were not happy the whole world was torn apart Savior was gone everything was gone and and their lives was ruined and all their hopes and aspirations and they were on the road to a mental breakdown they were on the road to being they were overloaded was despair and down you know what the Lord did not want to leave and he doesn't want to leave youth in the condition that you may be in he wants you to go and he will do the same to you amen see now something happened to these people because now they the moment that he was gone Eunice is the same power they they rose up amen there was a resurrection it took place amen because you see the resurrected one the resurrected Savior the resurrected King he came and he revealed himself personally to them hallelujah and a post resurrection revival amen these guys were in a post resurrection revival amen and this revival was to bring him up into a higher condition that was to come later on at the day of the peanut cost 50 days later for them you see they were looking on to a resurrection within their heart but something happened to him in this meeting with the Seventh Seal himself but resurrected Savior he came to them and he changed their emotional connection and connected them back to be full of joy full grace and strength and ability and motivation and enthusiasm suddenly change because they didn't stay even though it was evening time even though it was dark even though there was you know they should be going to bed because of this meaning and pray that you don't want to go to beat either because you want to get up by the resurrected one amen the one with the resurrection power to change you to lift your spirit to lift you can meet you back to what you should be amen and God's thinking you are full of joy amen there is no trouble Amen God has opened his word to commit you back to that reality and so you see these people they rose up the same hour they were any longer now they had a mission now they were connected to a vision and they needed to go and return to Jerusalem amen hallelujah this is a good place to return to you see because the Lord would meet them there there is the place the heart of of the of the earth the heart of others around this is the place where God would sit on his throne amen they would return to the very place that the the Holy of Holies would be and should be amen even though that time naturally speaking there was a shadow that you see now God as God is dealing in a certain Python here because you see in you is a throne for the Lord Himself to come and live amen amen so they returned to Jerusalem they returning to the heart of the man and they're returning to where the people are they're returning to come back into the vision they went from being sad down the spear disconnected completely confused not knowing what to do and then the Seventh Seal himself came personally to them because they were thinking about him and when you think about him he comes to you it's not a catchphrase a prophet doesn't just say it's a waste word will make you feel good he's meaning it's true that's a reality keep your mind on the Lord keep your mind on Jesus Christ the Lord with joy you shall draw waters from the wells of salvation with joy you shall draw borders from the wells of salvation who wants to drink from the wells of salvation tonight will make your joy profound amen hallelujah I was laughing in a good way of course when brother now Jason he was preaching my goodness on those resonances we just love that you know joy joy will sit before him you know that's why he went and paid for your suit because you were the joy and you see now that he's revealed it to you causes you to stop vibrating in a certain way it causes you to stop having a certain emotion amen and maybe that emotion has been blocked up by something maybe that emotion maybe it been through many things and you had many of us along we walk in listed the diplomatist to just beat things into US and and cool things up from the past but there is a grace here right now to reconnect you to take those blockages and lock them amen only God can do it only God knows how you see it's the matter of allowing him to do it amen you see before resurrection in your own life there must be a death you see there was a disc before the resurrected one comes of him he died himself but he overcame it he rose again and men who came to him but you see for them to actually receive that resurrection for them to actually be a beneficiary of that resurrection it would must be a death and if you want your problems in your life to be unblocked and you want those channels to be open so that you can resume that same joy as the king there so that you can be a resonance so that you can resonate the very joy in the Lord then you have to die to your ambitions you need to die to your own good works to your own dreams you need to die to your ministry you need to die to everything so that he can lead so that he can move so that he can keep you in there ever-present prisons you see now now I want to just get to this little bit here in verse 24 in verse 33 it says here it returns a Jerusalem and found the eleven gathered together and then that were with him saying the Lord is risen indeed amen and has appeared to Simon and they told what things were done in the way and how he was not one of them in breaking the bread do you know what I love about this and when I was reading it the Lord kind of just he just brought it to my attention you see it wasn't just them that was getting the revelation it wasn't just clear a person his friend that was receiving all the revelation of the seven seals and everything know the same seventh seal the same one he was down in Jerusalem he was ministering to Peter it was ministering to Mary he was down at mathur they he went to the people he was ministering to them all to bring them up just like he's ministering in Oakland ministering the tower in South Africa ministering in Wellington it's a unit Ministry of the captain himself bringing everybody together that's why when you look online when you see what's being preached it's the same it's the same Jesus in a post resurrection revival amen this first resurrection revival not that one remember we've got a different later I'm holding the back I want to show you something very great here and I'm just gonna say one little thing about it right now because I feel impressed to do this is you see their post resurrection revival the Holy Ghost hadn't even been poured out yet so they only had the Corporal they had the copper words of not saying I'm not diminishing them because this is a powerful event that see the resurrection was within them to take them to the resurrection was he the visitation of God was to take them and reconnect them to bring them to the Upper Room to receive the Holy Ghost now we're in the post resurrection revival we are in a revival now with the Holy Ghost with the open book with the Lord Himself within our lives to take us off the earth this is a first resurrection revival you are in a post resurrection revival the greatest revival that is in a struck the earth there is nothing like this now why don't you die to yourself die to everything else and around the joy of the Lord to come and connect you we need the Lord amen it's time to be more serious with God it's time to allow him amen the resurrected one to take those things how to remove all the blockages a man and I can tell you none of us is exempt from roughing just because we are in the earth with humans there is a divine position to minister to you just allow them let them do it let them help you with your life amen this is the hour this is the hour amen we have all of those things that to be hallelujah amen because we want to leave the city do you want to leave who wants to leave who's ready amen I think we were singing that song over the weekend are you ready for Jerusalem are you ready because I really like that foot I was just thinking yes Lord take me I'm ready for Jerusalem amen amen so I just like to just highlight that there just highlight that point there that the Lord was not just dealing with Cleopas but he was dealing with Peter he was he was he was he had appeared to this one and appeared to that one and down here to Mary he was called bringing it all together see we have a unique experience here because this message is not a denomination this message has not been taken over by fallen angels and controlled by some hierarchy of Rome or hierarchy in Germany or in England this this messages as a person Amen it's an a revelation of a resurrected Jesus Christ and he is leading this whole thing he is the five-star general he has the vision completely sorted he has all of the battlefront all perfectly amen what we need to do is fall into rank fall into our possession amen allow the captain to give us the direction and we stand still and we wait until he sees done and then we stop when he says stop amen when the purifier move they moved wait a man the Bible was very explicitly declares that we must wait on the Lord waiting on the ministry amen wait and allow Him to unfold the mystery of his will to unfold the things that are to be a May because specially the same this is an age cannot be cook it out my man we're not in a man agent launching anymore amen we have accumulated above the manege anointing we've risen opportunity to anointing amen and the evil anointing is connected to the very hit himself divine love amen is leading the way so why don't you lick divine love lead you amen oh well this continued on amen this is here I thought I would make that clear there when he comes and breaks his bread to you you will rise the same hour just like David and you may be generally were in a place where we we would connect us connected from all these different things and yet when he comes it makes the difference we will rise in that hour amen and I believe I was speaking to a lot of people here that have risen people that have sealed come to them amen and they had been so moved so impacted by the word so impacted by this great one that has broken the breed in their own homes I believe you're experiencing the breaking of bread even now in your house amen as you sit with your family as you had Bible studies with your children issue issues listen to the message and then he comes amen when he comes this what makes the difference I encourage you don't expect anything less than him to come and make these things real amen that's what will make you more like him that's what will change the hard things to change inside you amen those things that frustrate you those things and you fail there's a reason he's trying to show you just humble yourself a man reach out hallelujah reach out and touch him amen how to approach the battle he's the five-star channel don't try to figure it out you know and I might be eating my own roots here don't read a big psychological paper to try and get your seven steps to freedom but amen amen they might be a bit of an oxymoron but we're going to actually we're just going to look at them and I'm just going to parallel just to show you I want to expose the the this this thing this emotional detachment and I know brother Ben he brought it out I think I had too much salt in my pizza sorry amen hallelujah it's pretty warm in here actually I thought I was calm before but you will amen you know there there Matthew 28 you know we're talking about the resurrection the arena or the post resurrection revival and I just want to show you what resurrection we're in and we've heard this I've preached it we've heard this many many times many times but I just want to lay a little context here you see then Matthew 28 revival there the revival they were in was an angel an angel a mighty angel came down amen he came down and he opened the Roman seal they sealed the tomb with a Roman centurion cartoonian or even they call it and so it was sealed you know the Pharisees they went to Pilate and their religious blindness and they said old they're gonna see they might try to see the people you see they might try and deceive the people so let us make the tube sure you know and Pilate said whatever you need whatever you need just make it sure as you can and you see now if we take this now and spiritualize it because I believe we're a spiritual people and we should spiritual eyes and look at the bigger picture here and and you see now they had all the power of Rome behind them the power of road was used to seal the resurrection within the walls of the tomb you see now that was sealed over and died of a of soldiers and it rock but you see you cannot tane the life of God when the life of God is to be expressed that will break through any man-made wall dungeon rock Roman seals whatever it may be it will break through the white horse rider will break through the red horse rider will break through the black and the pale or together all of Satan's homes and so you see when God has made a man and you see now in their revival the angel comes down and he opens the seal breaks the seal and releases the life so that these people could come into their resurrection amen so that these people could come out and come up into their position and use and you see so that's their revival in a had a corporal visitation of Jesus Christ amen now our revival and parallel to this our revival parallels this bitumen in a slightly different in a spiritual sense because you see over the last seven church ages the Roman demon powers managed to pull over the people's eyes the lies and the evil religious ways and mixed paganism into Christianity until the the Veil the veil had come back over and the people couldn't see and the identity was lost and so the Roman seal was over the power of the Resurrection and the prophecies that the power of the Holy Ghost was bound by the creeds and doctrines of man it was bad and it couldn't be released because in his film Asia even though it was the Holy Spirit in them said even though was the Holy Spirit and Wesley even though was the Holy Spirit in the Pentecostal age but it couldn't be fully released because of dumb ism and far funny Roman seals over the power of the word and told in 1963 amen and mighty angel came down hallelujah and broke the seal I'm talking to you this is the one that comes amen this is the resurrection this resurrection and he says this one comes to you then you will know that I'm in my father in your need and I'm a new uranium part of me amen because you see it is the visitation of this one the visitation of this one when it comes to you you can receive your surrender he's looking for someone who's willing to lay everything down amen so that resurrected living Savior that was released like a mighty river come and wash you and come and change you give you life come and take you and can make you back to who you are can make you to the beautiful Jerusalem can meet you to your eternity connect you to your real self connect you to the heaven of God the City of God why do you think you'll own you know for that city like Abraham in the time and now here we are with our longing in our heart amen we have a longing debated because we're part of that city we're part of it amen hello Lou you and so this is what a great resurrection that was but what a glorious resurrection bishops and people being quickened a man by the power of the Resurrection it is the rising of the Sun amen what a resurrection that was and what a resurrection this is it's the visitation of this one the same one that visited Cleopas would make constrained him in that same one comes not Anna's corporal glorified body this up in heaven that is theophany it is word body in him in the word the word comes to the Spirit of God bonus of it comes to you to break the bread to you to raise you up from despair to raise you up from darkness to raise you up from confusion to raise you up from all of the ailments and all of the sudden that whatever the devil has made you to bring you can meet you to who you are to connect you to righteousness to connect you to holiness to commit you to the vision amen and you see when they take that visitation they went straight to work they didn't delay they were connected again to the burden of the Spirit you see the Spirit has a burden burden for his people the Lord is crying out people the Lord wants his people save and if we're not feeling that way there is a blockage somewhere there is something distracting us there is something that is blocking the channels can come to you tonight and reconnect you to them to meet you to the embassy amen to the emotion of the Holy Ghost amen so that you care for the lost you care for the work of God so that you care for your posture you care for your family you care for your people and you see many times we want to to kid we intellectually we care there's something blocking the heart stopping us from truly entrusting to care so that we can truly can meet so we can truly be a friend so that we can truly be a dad so that we can truly be a brother so that we can truly be a wife or a sister they may you see it takes the resurrected ones it takes them he's the one that will give us our connection brother Branham says this and the voice of the side he says now notice when then when his presence is near that certainly it brings emotion as I spoke this morning anything without emotion is dead and any religion that hasn't got some emotion to it you'd better be rien if did it brings emotion he quickens us but when we are cooking just remember what quickened us amen those whose side of what happened look unto the rock from which your human a man in the pit we sure did amen remember you see as he's an important part of that it keeps you humble it keeps you grateful don't forget what the Lord has done for you always think almost and write songs about those things write poems about those things give them praise when you pray you see when the prophets prayed and the Bible and when when people pray under inspiration they remind God in themselves and the people of the glourious also now God is wonderful as mercies and they relive the the the emotion of it and they get in the spirit because of it because they're connected in the spirit to the very heart of God remember Jesus is the heart of God amen hallelujah is he connected to the feeling of the people the feeling amen it's important amen now we don't want to live by feelings but we want to be led by his feelings we want to be his emotion he gives us he will give you a burden according to you calling and calling to your election and calling to your office according to what he wants you to do that's why it's so important that you wait long enough to let him speak he says here remember let's remember what quickened us what did it that's the presence of the Holy Spirit Jesus Christ in Hamid's showing himself that he is alive you see what he did when when when wind Cleophus Peter Mary and all of these ones when they saw that he was alive they said they couldn't there was so much joy they were so happy now we must remember that and don't forget those moments don't forget those times amen hallelujah because they will bring joy back to you they will the remembrance of those things amen will actually bring you back so that you can have more testimonials so that you can have more supernatural amen like sister Belinda song expect the supernatural even now in the service expect the supernatural let this be a journey for you let must be a time where you go from one place to another not because of me because of the Lord because this is the message and I pray to the Lord I said what when I read these quotes and if I can only get through them if I can read these quotes and you will be as if you know we were there and the Prophet was speaking under the same inspiration and the people could receive it my faith there is some journeys that we can take tonight we can take a journey tonight we don't have to stay the way we are we don't have to remain like this you see we're right at the end amen and the devil may be loosed and he may be rented on this world and he may even be rented in your life you may be failing a lot right now there's a reason for it he needs to be exposed he needs to be gone any luck we'll deliver your enemies into your hands enemies gone amen just think about that the world is the same amen amen heaven expectation for the supernatural amen okay now let me read this sorry it's going to be a few terms in here but I will try and explain some of them I don't even know so but I'm I skip over a button so any a little bits just one paragraph to paragraph says here this is I want to expose emotional detachment whether it is just a mind a little bit or it's major emotional detachment may not be as outwardly obvious as other psychiatric symptoms people experiencing emotional detachment have a reduced ability to express emotion to empathize with others or to form powerful emotional connections you see that Lundy has struck me I thought my we need to be able to form powerful emotional connections with each other with our family and with specially with God now if you cannot form a powerful emotional connection normally and I'm telling you now most of us suffer with us it's hard because the world we live in it's very difficult parent all neglect whatever it may be nor traumatic experiences are just the world the devil has shaped this world so there's hardly love myth no love left you know apart from in the bride but you see we're struggling because we came out of that and now we've got to be teens now our mindsets are got to be changed so that we can't love so that we can be a real friend so that we can develop deep emotional connections with people amen like a bond see this guy here he's a real inspiration to me he just seems to be able to just connect and be emotionally connected with people easily you know and I like that and I believe the is a testimony and an example that we can aspire to Manasa lord help me Lord Jesus to be able to love people and express their love without any sort of funny feelings inside me because you see if we shouldn't have those funny feeling we should be able to love people you know sometimes you know you know one of the biggest things the trauma of losing somebody maybe you've lost a father you lost the best friend of you lost a mother or sister whatever and you know that traumatic experience overload of emotion caused you to not be able to connect with people anymore because you don't want to be hurt like that again you know those things but the Lord wants us to be able to connect the game you see we have to go through these traumatic experiences we must overcome those things and maybe here is your maybe tonight you need ask the Lord to heal you of that maybe this is rooted out to the surface you can feel the pain that you went through in their head just for a little bit you know you just come out feel it over and then pray to that channel so you can form a deep emotional connection a man is very important says here to empathize with others or to inform powerful emotional connections they are also at an increased risk for many anxiety and stress disorders this can lead to difficulties in creating it maintaining personal relationships you know this is now we're talking these extreme levels of us but there's also small levels of it and it can hinder our relationship of God as you see we need to be able if we can't form a powerful connection with people then it's definitely we cannot form that powerful connection with the Lord because we are the same person whether it's an emotional connection to God or people you see and even though consciously you want to consciously you love to consciously you believe everything God says and you believe in you trust them but it's the harness down in the debts it's down in their subconscious where you cannot you know that's the place brother brand which is that's where the trouble lies there is right down that's the one that controls the ship down there say no right because of something that happened keeping you guys anxieties or fears or some traumatic experience but I'm telling you that tonight that you can be free tonight you can be free it's God's day this is God's day this is the day the Lord has made he's here he can help you and we're on a journey together and we're going to be raptured together we're not condemning each other it's not a judgment rumors when we look at one you know like maybe you shouldn't you know you opening up your weaknesses like that you see where is a transparency so that we can be delivered so that we can be open about it amen so that we can be free from these things amen don't hide the devil don't hide those things in your life amen if your subconscious is going the wrong way the Lord is here to touch them and you and the very thing that you're failing at right now the very thing that you may be going through right now that's causing you trouble you know the Lord like me will seem us to help you was that he wants what he was causing me to free right now Lord you're here introduced to that one services to serve the hearts that same angel came down to me amen that same spirit the Spirit of God he came down to me oh my and it quickened me cooking name it quicken hey man I rose up in the same me drinking stop me drive stop me all the stuff a manic wicked man you can be maybe your problems are as big as mine but you can be cooking from those little ones to receive it in the name of Jesus receive your liberation come out so that he can come in' amen okay I'm gonna read from now on otherwise we never get through it amen the person may are here this can lead to difficulties in creating and maintaining personal relationships the person may move elsewhere in their mind and appear preoccupied or not entirely prison well they may seem fully prison but exhibited purely intellectual behavior when emotional behavior would be appropriate I'm going to say anything but anyway can I repeat that anyway just for a bit of a bit this can lead to difficult oh where are we they may have this is a person that's struggling with emotional disconnect they may have a hard time being a loving family member all they may exhibit purely intellectual behavior when emotional behavior would be appropriate let's think about your experiences in the church with everything's going on and everyone's having to to believe you're just feeling you don't feel anything but you enjoying the information maybe they send emotional disconnection somewhere you're not feeling it because you see a human being we may feel an overwhelming ocean something's gonna happen an overwhelming emotion causes a man to cry amen an overwhelming emotion this is it this is a mechanism they don't even understand what crying really is I try to find out and I'm so surprised that that the world of research doesn't really understand crying I just somehow something that me was like you know crying is when your emotions you cry you release it's a relief and if you can't cry about something is something wrong if the word comes to you you can something happens in difference tears is a connection but it's purely intellectual and you're enjoying the information and we passed a man age remember we passed the manager Eagle literacy into the hot dog so we can be connected to the emotion of the spirit so that we can feel what he feels that our heart can be broken for this is a man you see but you see when the spirit is groaning and you can feel it you know we think of how the spirit is groaning in our lives but we don't feel anything well he's not feeling it should be with him connected to the heart of the person praying in the service the person preaching in the service the same God that is inspiring the preacher inspiring the prayer inspiring the song special the same God you should be connected to him connected to whom should I say connected in your heart but you see this world the devil has done as opposed to disconnect humanity to disconnect them from salvation this can make them from each other just connect them by these Hollywood games and all of the YouTube narratives and Hollywood even existing it was a YouTube man you know I shouldn't use Hollywood any my talking about you know YouTube and all of these the social the these these are when he call those famous social people that have those millions of followers you know those ones they just all it's doing disconnecting you from the Tree of Life yes disconnecting you in your mind it's disconnecting you but the Lord wants you to be convicted to him hallelujah but you choose we choose we choose what we allow to come in amen so cease here they may seem fully prison but exhibit they may have a hard time being a loving family member or they may avoid activities places and people associated with past traumas they this their disassociation can lead to lack of attention and hints to memory problems and extreme cases amnesia in some cases they present and extreme difficulty in giving or receiving empathy who knows what empathy is empathy is the ability to enter into someone else's burden or pain amen and and it's a very important part of our Christian walk really is you know brother BAM sees a missus when I pray for the people I need a feel for them I need a love there Michael don't be sorry for them I've got to be some etheric compassion but if you cannot if there's something wrong if you've had a hard upbringing you've been abused in some way and you struggle with that then it's hard for you to enter into someone's moon it's hard because empathy is a sensitive thing it's it's a softness in the spirit of your life and you see when when you when you get hurt those things shut off like a clamp but I can tell you right now if you just reach out to God in this moment under this inspiration and if the in the presence of the Lord if you just environment he can help you right now he can change that right now he can help you in your place so that you can be a good dad or in good mom so that you can feel for your children amen so that you can have an emotional connection to the vision of God and when people do things wrong you can see beyond and you can see that it's just the devil and you can love them anyway because there's empathy an emotional connection it's not just let me read this emotional detachment often rises due to psychological trauma and early years for example children who were raised in abusive or neglectful environments are more likely to experience emotional detachment as adults antidepressants have also been known to cause emotional blunting now I was writing down further in these notes whom I mean there's a lot more notes there and I don't think we're going to touch that but so I'll touch it now it just came to me while I was writing about emotional blackness and then I was like do you know what you may not be prescribed some antidepressant from some psychologists but you may be prescribing yourself antidepressants that are outside of the valley they are taken seize here emotional blunting you see it might not you might still have emotions I still get angry and might still have a few happy times here and there but you see there's a blunting there her glance and over you know this this sensitive stuff going on inside here but that man really can't touch in the devil he has ruined the human race he's ruined the socio patents the social patterns of humanity he's ruined the human spirit he's ruined the love of humans on he's ruined everything this is the best he could do just think about that this is it this is it this is this is the seals is open in your life a man you may be crying down one of the elders come to you and say weak not Judas prevailed and he came down and he's revealing himself to his people so say you're free hey I'm risen again the resurrected Living God I paid it all and now come to get you I come to say there's no more time for crying away the tears on your eyes so that you can have joy amen we don't want to be blunt we don't want to be blunted over by the antidepressants whether you're getting prescribed them it's going to blunt you over or whether or whether you're taking some other form of antidepressant but let me tell you there is a person this is an exodus fun to remain no reason just faith just believe believe them get down to the problem in your life so that you can be changed amen none of us are exempt none of us can hide none of us can hide from the need of the Lord right now in our home in our life hey you may not even know that is something wrong with you maybe you've lied to yourself too long but you see it's time now that all of it cast ago we're gonna die to ourselves we're gonna die to our reasoning we're gonna die to our memories we're gonna die to all that all of the imagination conscience reasoning and all of that stuff it needs to die it needs to die so that God can be enthroned in your mind amen he's the antidepressant he is just a complete opposite of depression a man nobody is too far nobody's done too much if you've still got a desire for God right now you haven't gone too far you haven't crossed the line heaven cross the line you can be saved right now you can be filled right now you can be from you can go from disappointment to divine appointment see for you to come into divine appointment you need a visitation and when you get a visitation you're gonna be connected because God doesn't want you to literally be part of us missing he doesn't election learn this lesson to actually go and preach to actually go and outreach he wants you to be emotionally connected to the spirit the heel using your subconscious and your conscious in your heart everybody your life they will see you to have dominion he was so hot to be like a Garden of Eden to be a war-torn wilderness he doesn't want it to be a lunar miss anymore amen you may think it's a [Applause] it's time to rise because the one is risen has come to make you rise to by how we doing for time almost up okay Alleluia let me get down to this you see they had drug abuse especially marijuana and LSD and seizures and all these things that caused the stuff severe depressions these things are what happens as the emotions just get too much you know and the body shuts down so it's a mechanism because there's a fear and all of these anxieties to stop people now that's an extreme form maybe none of us have an extreme form but you see it starts to come down in the subconscious and it makes its way up until you get controlled by these things and you know one thing that we must we need to be aware of in this in time is we we cannot let complexes and traumas influence our decisions on day to day stuff here until day to day life our walk just stuff everything you do during a date the decisions you make the way you react the the places you go to the things you listen to don't let those Amalekites influence your decisions even if it's hard and you don't want to do it what you need to do is you need to discern it and go you know what I'm acting out of a complex right now and I'm not gonna let that brought me in I'm going against the grain inside me I'm gonna do the right thing I'm gonna force myself to see you on dominion you don't have to listen to your spirit and literally it's broken you don't have to listen to it you don't have to listen to the devil and do the things that he tells you to do you don't have to go against the grain sometimes it's all it takes sometimes that's all it takes for you to get delivered it's the guy against the grain many times it's those things that's just breaking the habit it's just breaking along and grain habit and when the Lord has showed you and identified it then you can do the opposite and it's hard and it's not easy but there is grace there is a provision and if you feed on the provision if you drink more than you need you'll push out another brunch brunch will match the very one for life amen you'll be by a river of living waters can anyone testify of the glorious the reality of being planted by rivers of living water just wave your head just wave it like you know I enjoy being planted by rivers of living water oh where I go I'm down I know my roots are sunken down it's good refreshing water from the Spirit of God amen that flows from his throne unto his own they made his anthem raised amen the fruits of the Lord amen amen I have to get to a couple of quotes so it's just we're all at home you don't have to travel so maybe just 10 15 minutes max I just have to get you some quotes I'll be I'll be very I'll be good amen connection here brother Brent says this in the world is falling apart very very good subject here he says and what's the use of putting up an electric wire if you use if you refuse the Dynamo see they can't get no current in it it's just a dead wire that's what's the matter with the church today we got all the wires up and press the button and there's no life what we need to do is get connected that's all right now right now get connected with Christ our lives our emotion the lives of our mind connected in them amen let me repeat that now this is the prophet speaking not just not brother handy now this is the prophet speaking now when I saw this I was like you know the Lord gave me an inspiration to go down this line I thought then you know and then I read this I was like wow Magnussen's just exactly exactly what I'm trying to say the Lord has inspired us get connected with Christ our lives of our emotion you see our lives of our emotion the prophecies the lives of our mind connected in them is we need to be emotionally connected this is the time that we need a feel again hallelujah feelings going to come back in the body empathy amen we've been through the Wild West we've been through the ages of politics and doctrines and differences and fighting and I give my hey I take my head off to the veterans that have fought and they've gone through like David with a sword with the brunt and then paid the way and here we are like Solomon sitting and resting and enjoying the fruits of the war that's been going for 50 years and now finally come to time Amen hallelujah you know David he says just before he goes he says he gathers everybody like this like this meeting with head of 9 he says you know what this is the Reagan speaking but they say it's the Lord speaking to us I've gone and I've subdued the land for you I've cleared it all for you I've done all the Sun beating down this I've played all of it to you now go and make a temple build a temple for the Lord the Millennium come down ready ready your temple ready your temple reading your life amen hallelujah it's all being subdued now now let the Lord come and deal with those last things make the Lord come and remove those last things be connected again we can make that in your emotion again the Lord is here to do it there is no conflicts too hard there is no mindset to gone there is no antigua mystic sing opposite thing the Lord can't deal with but you might have to be honest with someone you might have to let go of your pride Amen you might have to let go and let God let him do it just admit it let it all flow out so that you could be free so Amen our hats should render I wrote this our hearts should render standing ovations you know do you know what a standing ovation is I'm sure you guys know what a standing ovation is you can be in any city whether it's a you know I mean there is anyone probably watched the American politics you know and if they've made a tradition out of it's very cheesy actually they they um you know when we never the President or someone see something you know they stand up and they clap and then they sit down it's like a tradition but you know when somebody sees something that is just striking and it's so compelling and it's so real and it's so connecting but they make in the crowd you know they're so drawn Internet Bishop they're so connected to it then they just get elated they can't contain themselves and they just sauce them simultaneously and like you know I've been in meetings when they just all stand oh yeah let's all stand and just doesn't know what to do himself is a standing ovation compelling time it's a time when the people are grouped by what is being said whether it's a lie whether it's true whether it's whatever it is intellectual what about the work what about when the King speaks what about when we hear the name of Jesus when we hear we reminder of what he's done for us and what's happening isn't is there a standing ovation in your heart your heart have a standing ovation you know I believe that if you're emotionally connected to the vision you've had a visitation like Cleophus you've had a visitation like Mary had a visitation like master came to them you know this should be a connection that when the Lord speaks it you are caught up in it there is an ovation going on in your life because you can make to it and that's what makes the world of difference that's what helps you to enter to a burden for somebody that's what helps you break through gives you motivation to pray through for somebody that's a need not just say a prayer you pray through struggles through the reason you struggle shows cuz you don't it is the real deep powerful spiritual connection because of something in your life your brothers whatever sisters and have a time of the Lord - nothing let it be gone hey man hallelujah I mean the day is the day amen amen amen we can goes from many stories many times that I can't get to them right now I feel like saying what they see it in Hebrews 11 think of Mathur and think of all of these these stories of where Jesus came and he changed everything and being emotionally connected seems to be a lot of crying you see it was she was thinking Jesus Jesus Jesus there is a crying in the Jesus amen why not you so that you can weep indeed they will come a resurrection then they will come a voice then he will speak hallelujah thank you action when you go to action then it's time amen to roll away to sperm and with all the stones thrown away when your stones run away when my son away then he's gonna say cupfuls

read this I felt like it was her it was definitely like a power and this and what he says here and I've been impressed by this so deeply he sees hearing the door to the door oh no the door of the door and 57 the door of the door he says here and I just pray that you would earn this and it would become your testimony tonight he says the Bible says Hebrews 13:8 oh sorry I start up here it says here I am the vine ye are the branches now the vine does not be a fruit it only produces the life and the branch bears fruit so the church is the branches and if it's really connected in Christ yeah it'll be the fruits of Christ hey man look at your tree look at your life not you struggling not you trying not you putting on anything I'm talking about what is born what is coming forth automatically what does default sitting yeah just to analyze it really clearly don't let the devil blind your memory you just get rid of him oh my hallelujah this you see people's come and rent he can take over the memory but tonight you can kick him out tonight he can disappear so that your memory could come and you can remember it all again hallelujah the Bible says Hebrews 13:8 he's the same yesterday today
