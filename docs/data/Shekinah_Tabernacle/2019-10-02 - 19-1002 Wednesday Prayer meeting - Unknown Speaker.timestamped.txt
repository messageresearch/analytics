[0:05] an echo echo well I'm in 3d
[0:14] they say it's unsound gonna be 3d
[0:17] amen this all just stand up it's a
[0:19] wonderful pre-meeting and much to be
[0:22] thankful for and yeah usually on
[0:26] Wednesdays weather like this rolls up
[0:28] it's just so cold man how cold it was
[0:32] but yeah we ready to warm up here in the
[0:35] house of the Lord it's got a couple of
[0:37] wonderful songs to it to warm us up with
[0:39] one thing that I've been thinking about
[0:41] this week and you know when you're
[0:44] driving and you're thinking and you may
[0:45] have meditated upon the word of the Lord
[0:47] and and this week I thought about just
[0:50] singing when we sing a song do we
[0:52] actually sing the words or do we just
[0:55] listen to the melody and and echo the
[0:58] words as we go cuz I remember when I was
[1:01] still back in the world and what
[1:03] happened is you used to have songs
[1:06] playing and you would say man this is an
[1:08] awesome song and somebody would say have
[1:09] you ever heard the words and you're like
[1:11] yeah I'm pretty sure they'd tell you the
[1:12] words you gonna hats not that it's not
[1:14] the same song it's definitely not the
[1:15] same song and you go back and you play
[1:18] it and you actually listen to any go
[1:19] whoa okay I never knew they sang there
[1:22] and since I've become a Christian the
[1:24] words in the song is more important to
[1:27] me than just the melody so I really
[1:30] wanted to know what I'm singing about
[1:31] because that is where it is that's
[1:33] that's where I'm thankful and I want to
[1:35] sing the songs you know and mean it so
[1:38] tonight when we sing the songs I
[1:39] encourage you to to look at the words
[1:42] read the words and just take it in and
[1:45] really mean it with your life and you'll
[1:47] see you'll get that blessing because
[1:49] that's how we worship God we don't just
[1:51] sing we don't just come in and sing what
[1:53] we're really interim in every word we
[1:55] sing because we Christians

[21:46] just go to the book of Matthew we're
[21:49] gonna read chapter 11 just a just a
[21:51] couple of verses here Matthew if you're
[21:54] living then we're going to read from
[21:57] Luke the 18th chapter
[22:09] so Matthew 11 and we're going to read
[22:13] verses 16 and 17
[22:24] and Jesus speaking says but we're on to
[22:27] shall I liken this generation it is like
[22:30] unto children sitting in the markets and
[22:32] calling unto their fellows and saying we
[22:36] have piped unto you and you have not
[22:37] danced we have mourned unto you and you
[22:40] have not lamented then let's go to Luke
[22:43] 18 you may think that's a bit unusual
[22:44] but um anyway Luke 18 and we're gonna
[22:51] read verse verse 35 down and it came to
[22:58] pass that as he came nigh unto Jericho a
[23:04] certain blind man set by the wayside
[23:07] begging and hearing the multitude passed
[23:09] by he asked what it meant and they told
[23:11] him that Jesus of Nazareth passes by and
[23:14] he cried saying Jesus thou son of David
[23:16] have mercy on me and they which went
[23:20] before rebuked him that he shouldn't
[23:22] hold his peace but he cried so much the
[23:25] more thou son of David have mercy on me
[23:28] and Jesus stood and commanded him to be
[23:30] brought unto Him and when he was come
[23:33] near he asked him saying what wilt thou
[23:36] that I shall do unto thee and he said
[23:39] Lord that I may receive my sight and
[23:43] jesus said unto him receive thy sight
[23:45] thy faith has saved thee and immediately
[23:48] he received his sight and followed him
[23:50] glorifying God and all the people when
[23:53] they saw it gave praise unto God amen
[23:55] may the Lord blesses word you may have
[23:58] your seats tonight just want to have a
[24:00] have a a very short just a simple
[24:03] thought on attitude we were in here in
[24:07] Matthew 11 where Jesus after you know in
[24:10] the in the previous part of the
[24:12] scripture it's amazing where where he he
[24:16] would speak yo the disciples of John the
[24:18] Baptist came to him asking yo are you
[24:20] him will surely look for another and
[24:22] then and then Jesus said you know just
[24:24] just watch the meeting a little but the
[24:26] lame walk the lepers are cleansed the
[24:27] Deaf hear the dead are raised you know
[24:29] the cost the other pours preach the
[24:31] gospel and then he begin to speak about
[24:33] John the Baptist how he was the you know
[24:35] how he rose his forerunner and all that
[24:37] they need any
[24:38] then he just in Tajiks here that you
[24:40] know what is this generation like what
[24:42] can i liken these people to and he said
[24:44] it's like you know children in the
[24:45] marketplace where where you know one one
[24:48] group is singing and the others calling
[24:50] to their fellows and they have you know
[24:52] and and so we have piped unto you but
[24:54] you have not done so so he's saying that
[24:56] the generation is not responding and the
[24:59] way that that they've been that God has
[25:02] spoken to them so he's saying it's like
[25:04] chill do normally when people play music
[25:06] what happens people dance you know and
[25:08] normally when people are sad if people
[25:10] respond and kindly said with them but
[25:12] he's saying this generation is actually
[25:14] the opposite they're not not interested
[25:16] in dancing then I understood in
[25:17] responding to the Lord and their you
[25:19] know so they're not even in tune with
[25:21] what God is doing and you know I kind of
[25:23] got a thought from I was serving jelly
[25:25] on Monday night and you know and and you
[25:28] try and scoop the jelly out of the bowl
[25:30] and it kind of does this you try and get
[25:32] in the bowl of conscious slides and
[25:34] slips around and you know a lot of
[25:37] people like that when it comes to God
[25:39] you know they will sit on this seat and
[25:41] they'll end up on like this and their
[25:42] feet up in the air and they all slimy
[25:44] and you know going like this and you
[25:45] know they're you know they think when's
[25:47] this gonna end and I wish there's a
[25:49] clock on the wall so I could turn and
[25:51] look at it and agonize in my heart about
[25:53] how long this is taking and it's like
[25:55] jelly rolling around on a hot a table
[25:57] you know it's like a bunch of slime
[25:59] rolling down a stick you know that's the
[26:01] most ridiculous thing where you can
[26:03] think that you're in the presence of the
[26:05] eternal I am a man that redeemed you
[26:08] that saved you that healed you that is
[26:11] here that is here not to beat you down
[26:13] not to make you belittle not to not to
[26:16] be cruel not to be mean but to lift you
[26:18] up to loose you from the chains of the
[26:20] devil y'all just check you're free to
[26:22] wash you to make you a new creature but
[26:24] yet we are out like this and we're like
[26:26] oh man we're just gonna end it yo this
[26:29] is horrible you know what kind of
[26:31] attitude is that
[26:32] alright you know I think have you ever
[26:35] tried to put jelly in a bowl don't be
[26:37] jelly attitude now I've got it your
[26:41] attention I hope I'll do a lot more of
[26:44] that I don't care I've already made
[26:46] myself look silly before you know anyway
[26:48] attitude
[26:50] definition of attitude it's a settled
[26:53] way of thinking or a feeling about
[26:55] something since when you got your mind
[26:57] made up about something that's your
[26:59] attitude towards it like for example
[27:00] when I was young my attitude towards
[27:02] broccoli was it's horrible that was my
[27:05] attitude
[27:06] it was my settled way of thinking about
[27:07] broccoli I cannot stand this broccoli I
[27:10] don't like it I don't want it does my
[27:12] attitude because it was settled that way
[27:14] my mind had to be changed that broccoli
[27:17] wasn't so bad after all you following me
[27:21] Amen you know you know it's like when
[27:25] you're young you think you have all the
[27:26] time in the world and you get bored
[27:28] when's this gonna happen wins it's gonna
[27:30] happen yes if my attitude was this way
[27:32] towards time but now my attitude has
[27:34] changed was time I need more of it I've
[27:37] got a value my time I'm going to use it
[27:39] you know because I don't have a lot of
[27:41] time my attitude change
[27:42] now it's incredible you think about here
[27:45] Jesus is on his way to Calvary I just
[27:48] want to go to the gates of Jericho
[27:50] he's blind Bartimaeus and he's sitting
[27:53] there begging blind and brother Brown
[27:55] tells a story that has has his parents
[27:58] or his mother would tell him how you
[28:00] know Jericho Joshua came through here
[28:02] Rahab put the scarlet yo cord out the
[28:05] window and yo they were safe when the
[28:07] walls fell down flat and yo you know
[28:10] Elijah came along here and great heroes
[28:13] the Bible lived in here and you know he
[28:15] would think if only that God was present
[28:17] I finally the God of Elijah was here
[28:19] then he had healed my blindness of only
[28:21] Joshua's here I wouldn't stay blind and
[28:24] so he was sitting there here's Jesus
[28:27] he's walking through Jericho where is he
[28:31] going he's not on a circuit to her he's
[28:34] not coming back in that form he is never
[28:37] gonna walk in that form through Jericho
[28:39] again never never never he's on his way
[28:41] to the cross so this is the last time
[28:44] his sacred feet are walking through that
[28:47] gate never again will he do it in that
[28:51] way now you think about that here is
[28:55] blind bartimaeus this is his opportunity
[29:00] to get ahold of the son of David this is
[29:03] why
[29:04] sure chance you don't read about people
[29:08] like blind Bartimaeus the woman with the
[29:10] blood issue
[29:10] Zacchaeus you don't read about them in
[29:13] the scripture because they were like
[29:15] this wondering when it's going to end
[29:17] you know I'm sick about this you know
[29:20] you don't read about them in the
[29:21] scripture because they had that attitude
[29:23] their attitude was he asked because he's
[29:26] blind he can't see what's going on
[29:27] what's all this noise
[29:29] someone tell me either said this sounds
[29:31] different I'm not used to this kind of
[29:33] noise at the gate I know what it's like
[29:35] but this is different he says who's this
[29:37] causing this ruckus and they just see it
[29:40] as Jesus of Nazareth passing by what has
[29:44] he done
[29:44] well I heard he he raised a big girl he
[29:49] healed these people he come to see and
[29:52] and and rice I mean I mean blind
[29:53] Bartimaeus the cogs and is he returning
[29:56] that sounds like things my parents told
[30:00] me that sounds like a God I heard about
[30:03] what was his attitude his attitude was
[30:06] you know it wasn't man I hope this goes
[30:09] away so I can get some peace no he knew
[30:12] this was his one opportunity this was as
[30:16] one shot and he was determined I'm going
[30:19] to make the most of my one shot I'm not
[30:22] going to let it pass me by I'm not going
[30:24] to say well I don't feel happy I don't
[30:26] feel good you know
[30:30] Wednesday Sunday two hardest days of the
[30:33] week why is that because we're here why
[30:39] is that because we're here to worship
[30:41] God why is that because God wants to
[30:43] come down and meet with us I mean and
[30:45] probably in a map maybe the greater the
[30:47] way then he would you're just yourself
[30:49] and so the devil fights you and then
[30:51] your mind battles and things happen and
[30:53] people look at you finding you take it
[30:55] wrong and you know and you're all
[30:57] twisted yo
[30:58] is it only me
[31:01] why cuz the dibbles trying to get us to
[31:04] miss our blessing give us the wrong
[31:07] attitude and say well it's always a
[31:09] battle well of course it's a battle
[31:11] someone's fighting you and it's not your
[31:13] family it's not your brother and sister
[31:15] it's not even your own self it's the
[31:16] devil's fighting you trying to rob you
[31:18] of a blessing you think about who's
[31:21] who's hood you know like in the
[31:23] discernment lines God comes down brother
[31:25] brems he's saying I'm just like you I'm
[31:27] just your brother I'm waiting for him to
[31:29] come and people who even critics knew
[31:31] when the angel Lord came down such a
[31:33] presence came into the building he
[31:34] didn't need to say he's here if I knew
[31:36] he was there and he would start calling
[31:39] people out telling them what's wrong
[31:41] than what they're even wearing he sees
[31:43] are they're missing it they're missing
[31:45] it God acts who was speaking to them
[31:47] directly and they're missing their
[31:49] visitation why maybe their attitude
[31:51] wasn't right maybe the other devil was
[31:53] trying to rob them of their blessing we
[31:56] face a real enemy well we have a real
[31:58] God father we have a Chern Living God I
[32:01] mean but you know we should have the
[32:03] attitude every time we open this Lord I
[32:06] want to get my blessing every time I
[32:09] talk to your Lord I want to get my
[32:11] blessing every time I sing this song I
[32:13] want to get my blessing holy every time
[32:15] I come to church I want to get my
[32:17] blessing that should be our attitude
[32:20] hallelujah they shouldn't be you see
[32:22] what we can get out of our nose and eat
[32:24] it and eat our fingernails and pick out
[32:26] what ears and stuff you know he with me
[32:30] blind Bartimaeus had one head had that
[32:35] one choice one one one time amen he took
[32:41] it by the horns he got what he needed
[32:44] because his attitude was right he didn't
[32:48] let the devil rob him the devil's not
[32:51] going to come to you and say yet you're
[32:52] a believer you're gonna make it yeah
[32:54] absolutely that's for you go for it
[32:56] no he sits on your shoulder saying what
[32:59] about this and this is going to happen
[33:00] tomorrow and this person's like this oh
[33:01] you know this is happening and what
[33:03] about this and this is going on and you
[33:05] need new clothes you didn't use shoes
[33:06] and you want to go on holiday and then
[33:07] it at all these million things way he's
[33:09] trying to get your attention that you
[33:11] will miss your blessing
[33:13] and this is
[33:14] boring wise Church boring because the
[33:17] devil thinks it's boring and he's trying
[33:19] to he's trying to give you his feeling
[33:21] about it
[33:22] hallelujah is the words not true and
[33:24] there's nothing to this I'm sorry
[33:26] there's everything to this I mean is
[33:29] everything to this word hallelujah it's
[33:32] true amen
[33:34] we've got a record we could have a
[33:36] testimony meeting right now and everyone
[33:38] come up and say was it true what
[33:40] happened to you this is what happened I
[33:42] was there I know it happened to me
[33:43] hallelujah so blind Bartimaeus had the
[33:48] right attitude and he got what he needed
[33:51] a meant and we want to be exactly the
[33:55] same way a man doesn't matter what age
[33:58] we are we want to get exactly where
[34:00] saying Lord you're here for me
[34:02] hallelujah you want to meet my needs I
[34:05] can't meet my needs you meet my needs
[34:07] get a hold of him Amen that's what we
[34:12] need to do so question are you jelly in
[34:15] a bowl or something that's just you know
[34:19] you could just put on the plate what
[34:21] attitude do we have the right mental
[34:24] attitude brother Brown says causes every
[34:26] divine promise to come to pass the right
[34:28] mental attitude towards the word will
[34:30] cause it come to pass a menace not can
[34:33] it be done yes it can be done
[34:35] he's already declared it will be done he
[34:37] purchased our salvation on the cross
[34:39] then it will be done
[34:41] amen hallelujah amen so you know we want
[34:48] to have a settled way of thinking as the
[34:50] meaning of attitude that the Lord the
[34:53] word is true amen
[34:55] he purchased our salvation the word is
[34:58] for me
[34:58] he's my Redeemer he's my healer he's my
[35:01] Savior he's my guide he's my comfort
[35:04] he's my peace amen he's going to take me
[35:07] in a rapture don't one of us children we
[35:09] should have that attitude father I'm
[35:10] here to meet with you hallelujah
[35:13] that's how we should be blind bartimaeus
[35:17] had the one chore option and he got what
[35:21] he needed he cried all the louder when
[35:23] he heard who it was how about you and I
[35:25] I mean how about you
[35:28] the woman with the blood issue she's in
[35:31] the scripture because she is determined
[35:32] if I could just touch the hem of His
[35:34] garment I'll be made whole she had 12
[35:37] years of trouble till she got to him but
[35:40] the main thing that she got to Herman
[35:41] hallelujah that's that's what mattered
[35:43] she got to him she pushed through the
[35:45] crowd she pushed her every problem and
[35:47] she got to him hallelujah Anne was
[35:50] healed she had the right attitude the
[35:54] scribes and Pharisees had the wrong
[35:55] attitude it's amazing in the scripture
[35:58] there's an account where where Jesus and
[36:00] His disciples are walking through the
[36:01] wheat fields on the Sabbath day and as
[36:04] disciples pick up the corn they begin to
[36:06] eat it and the Pharisees are there
[36:08] criticizing why you're why you're your
[36:12] disciples eating on the Sabbath day my
[36:14] question is why weren't why were they in
[36:15] church they should have been in the
[36:17] synagogue on the Sabbath day but they're
[36:19] spending their energy walking around
[36:21] following the Son of Man to criticize
[36:22] them
[36:24] hallelujah and then Jesus go sis goes
[36:27] into the synagogue and there's a man
[36:29] with a withered hand that they can't
[36:31] help but he can help if is it lawful to
[36:34] heal on the Sabbath day and he says
[36:37] don't just stretch forth thine hand
[36:38] sometimes it can be such an easy thing
[36:40] but God's looking for your response how
[36:43] Louie he wants you to respond to his
[36:44] word amen
[36:46] and he stretched forth his hand it
[36:48] becomes as whole as the other one and it
[36:51] just made the Pharisees and things angry
[36:52] because their attitude was wrong we want
[36:57] to have a right kind of attitude par
[36:59] lujah you want to see more victory in
[37:01] Europe life to have the right attitude
[37:04] hallelujah that's what we want to do we
[37:08] want to have the right attitude it will
[37:10] change everything
[37:12] Amen but what causes what causes us to
[37:15] have the wrong attitude pride looking at
[37:18] our own self our own problems what we're
[37:20] going through being self-centered that
[37:22] causes us to have the wrong attitude
[37:23] well how do you change it how do you
[37:25] have the right attitude don't look at
[37:27] yourself
[37:27] don't have your eyes focused on you and
[37:30] your problems or what's going on your
[37:31] life we all have problems amen and and
[37:35] so I'm not putting down any problems we
[37:37] face real problems but they did a day
[37:39] that observed lying vanities this is in
[37:41] the book of Job
[37:42] forsake their own mercies so if your if
[37:45] your observe and he was in a whales
[37:46] belly he will he had some real problems
[37:50] he couldn't step out of the whale he
[37:52] couldn't get out he was trapped in this
[37:54] whales belly he says it's just lying
[37:57] Vanity's and if I observe the whale
[37:59] belly
[37:59] I'm going to forsake my own mercy so we
[38:03] don't want to be observable dit lying
[38:05] Balinese but I bet you very much if he
[38:07] pushed he says he's I feel wells belly
[38:09] he would have felt the stomach acid
[38:11] sloshing around all you know he would
[38:14] have felt it I'm in a whale's belly it's
[38:16] pitch-black surrounded in seaweed he was
[38:19] having a bad day but he has no it's just
[38:21] lying Vanity's i'm not going to observe
[38:24] them I'm not going to bring them to get
[38:25] a sitter ation I'm just going to
[38:26] consider amen the word of the Lord
[38:28] because if I consider that then I I will
[38:31] receive mercy but if I observe what's
[38:34] going on around me I forsake my own
[38:36] mercies who wants their own who wants
[38:38] mercy amen so one thing don't look at
[38:43] the lying vanities their temporal they
[38:46] shall pass they shall be done away with
[38:48] I mean so don't be focused on those
[38:51] things be focused on the word of the
[38:53] Lord amen you know as as brother M says
[38:57] yo what good can worry do a man will
[39:01] walk well what's the point of believing
[39:02] well faith can deliver me worry can't
[39:04] help me you gotta have the right
[39:06] attitude towards it the problem is we
[39:08] live in an instant age so we want an
[39:11] instant answer but God doesn't always
[39:13] give instant answers he answers in his
[39:16] time and his taught his program his
[39:18] timeline is very very different from
[39:20] ours
[39:21] I mean but we've got to be lined up with
[39:24] what he wants hallelujah
[39:27] hey I mean you say well I want an
[39:31] instant fix
[39:31] we don't always get an instant fix
[39:33] because God's building character God
[39:36] knows what he what we have need of amen
[39:39] but we're going to have the right right
[39:41] attitude about the Word of God I mean so
[39:46] don't be jelly amen
[39:48] don't miss your blessing even in a very
[39:51] simple service because many times if we
[39:54] if we fail to see
[39:56] the value of coming to church if we fail
[39:59] to see the value of the Word of God we
[40:02] will miss our blessing we will miss what
[40:04] God wants to give us if we say what's
[40:06] the point in coming yeah because what
[40:09] does the devil tell you don't go tonight
[40:11] it's cold or it's hot or it's whatever
[40:13] you're hungry you're not hungry you're
[40:15] full you got this you others just stay
[40:17] home he's trying to get you to miss the
[40:20] blessing
[40:21] he's trial was the point he just waved
[40:23] his arms around and he gets his words
[40:26] mixed up and you know they sing this way
[40:28] what's the point you know and and if you
[40:31] start agreeing with them I'll guarantee
[40:32] you one thing you'll miss your blessing
[40:34] oh you've been there before
[40:36] he's probably said the same things
[40:38] before you know you'll miss what God has
[40:42] for you if you don't see the value it's
[40:47] like you know we need to we need to
[40:49] cultivate spiritual appetites amen we
[40:53] need to cultivate spiritual episodes
[40:55] it's like a food you try something new
[40:58] sometimes the first bite isn't the
[41:01] greatest it's an acquired taste some
[41:04] things amen some things I refuse to
[41:07] acquire but you know some things are
[41:09] quiet dace like you take cheese that
[41:12] should be basically a bio you know
[41:14] you're a biological warfare agent people
[41:16] love it because they acquire the taste
[41:18] right why because they've been eating it
[41:21] over a period of time and they get they
[41:22] get used to it and they begin to like it
[41:24] the first time I had a cup of coffee it
[41:26] was horrible but now I've acquired a
[41:29] taste for it and I'll be honest quite
[41:32] often I need coffee just to function cuz
[41:36] I wake up and you know sleepers where's
[41:38] that where's where's mr. Sandman knees
[41:40] foot more sander Myers to keep me asleep
[41:42] you know but so you need it too you know
[41:46] so you see the value and what you're
[41:48] drinking you know and people get people
[41:51] get uh you know accustomed or they get
[41:53] used to certain food because they
[41:56] develop a spirit appetite for it you
[42:00] have to cultivate an appetite for the
[42:01] word of God if you want camp to be a if
[42:05] you want camp to be the greatest
[42:06] meetings of your life cultivate a
[42:09] spiritual
[42:10] Ziya now don't get right don't get right
[42:13] at camp get right now I mean start
[42:17] purpose in your heart have the right
[42:18] attitude yes Lord you're here where you
[42:22] said you'd never leave me nor forsake me
[42:24] I don't just need a big camp meeting to
[42:26] be rejoicing and shouting and jumping I
[42:28] mean but Lord you can minister a single
[42:30] scripture to me and I can shout and
[42:32] rejoice wherever I am I mean come but
[42:35] you got to have a spirit you have to
[42:36] cultivate a spiritual appetite develop
[42:39] it yo spend more time it pays off how do
[42:43] people win at the Olympics they train
[42:45] they put energy in because they know
[42:48] they can win the gold most of an athlete
[42:52] is motivation those who believe they'll
[42:56] lose lose those that believe they can
[42:58] win win you have to have faith in
[43:01] brother Isaac's here to that Wednesday
[43:02] he said yo you have to believe in
[43:04] yourself this is just the world they say
[43:05] yep their faith in yourself that you can
[43:07] do it I mean but if you don't believe
[43:09] you can do it you won't do it amen so
[43:13] you got to have faith in yourself
[43:14] I'm an overcomer why am I an overcomer
[43:17] he made me an overcomer
[43:18] I'm sinless why am i sinless he made me
[43:21] sit loose I am perfect why I perfect us
[43:23] he made me perfect I have to believe it
[43:25] about myself I have to believe that he
[43:27] died for me hallelujah I have to believe
[43:29] he has sanctified me I have to believe
[43:32] it if you don't believe it you won't be
[43:35] you have to believe you have the victory
[43:37] even if you do not see any evidence of
[43:39] it you must believe it I am more than a
[43:42] conquerer why cuz he made me more than a
[43:44] conqueror but I have to believe it that
[43:46] is for me I am blind by Timaeus he
[43:48] believed that that Jesus Christ could
[43:50] heal him he said thou son of David
[43:52] here's exactly right hallelujah and he
[43:55] got what he needed because he believed
[43:56] that he had faith that he could receive
[43:58] it amen so what about you cultivate
[44:05] spiritual desire you say well I didn't
[44:07] even know how to pray I still don't
[44:09] really know how to pray but just talk to
[44:12] him you don't have to grow have a great
[44:14] big eloquent speech of great flowery
[44:16] words you know brother Brown tells a
[44:18] story there was a guy walking down the
[44:19] street and he any-any walked past a a
[44:23] you know a house and outside the house
[44:25] there was a boy and he was on his knees
[44:26] like this he sang a b c d with all his
[44:31] haughty sincere I mean he got the end he
[44:33] said Amen he got up and the end the
[44:36] man's watching mrs. sunny why are you
[44:38] what are you doing
[44:39] that's praying you're praying you were
[44:43] praying you're saying the alphabet no I
[44:45] just don't know how to pray so I thought
[44:48] well the Lord understands my heart so if
[44:49] I just say the leaders he'll put it
[44:51] together how how I feel you say well
[44:55] that's ridiculous it's not ridiculous
[44:57] because many times we can't even get it
[44:59] out how we really feel and how we want
[45:01] to express ourselves we can't put our
[45:03] problems and things really how we really
[45:05] want to put it but God understands your
[45:07] heart your attitude is not just what
[45:10] it's not what you say it's your actions
[45:11] it's your heart
[45:12] how are you at you it's shown your
[45:14] attitude is shown by what you do amen he
[45:20] said I don't know how to pray brother
[45:22] Brown wrote a letter put it on a tree
[45:25] dear sir I know what he wrote so it's
[45:29] not about don't you know God knows what
[45:31] you mean because someone you know Jesus
[45:35] said don't be like the scribes and
[45:36] Pharisees standing in the marketplace
[45:37] saying great big prayers man would say
[45:40] all that man really knows what he's
[45:42] talking about God says no he know
[45:43] nothing
[45:43] he sounds good but he's got nothing to
[45:45] it so don't be you know took from your
[45:49] heart
[45:50] cultivate cultivate a spiritual appetite
[45:53] in prayer and in the word and you'll
[45:57] find that camp will just be a Jubilee
[46:00] you just have you just be dancing around
[46:03] the place the whole time hallelujah
[46:05] hallelujah you'll be dancing from the

[46:21] you can stop dancing now he said no I
[46:22] can't stop hallelujah I'm having a
[46:25] revival glory hallelujah my rub off on
[46:29] those people who say it can't be done
[46:31] but why but why would people in be that
[46:34] kind of atmosphere
[46:35] have that kind of attitude because
[46:37] they've cultivated a spiritual desire
[46:39] before they go and that's what we need
[46:42] to do start you you put in you'll get
[46:46] out I mean you you reap what you sow
[46:50] holy so if you reaping like jelly you'll
[46:53] get back that amen and your ways reap

[47:19] glorious time hallelujah who wants to
[47:22] meet the Lord again and again and again
[47:23] and again and he changes you and burdens
[47:26] are lifted and then pain is gone and
[47:28] conflicts with the God and and you walk
[47:30] in the camp it's like you walk into a
[47:31] place something happens you walk out
