TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] so [Music] so [Music] praise the lord good afternoon everyone how are you all feeling good real good that's the one we're gonna this is the last service but we're not just going to like wind down no man that's not how we do it we're gonna go out on a blaze of glory [Music] these guys that used to work for me young fellows they got to about maybe the 10th or 15th of december you know we might be closing up on about the 22nd or 23rd of december and they're like oh boss you know we'll just start winding down you know coming up to the end of the year we just start winding down i'm like yep yep yep you do that and i'll start winding down your hourly rate each day so they quickly decided that they wouldn't be winding down we had to go strong right until the end and when we're laborious and the kingdom of god that's what we do we go strong to the end we're not winding down man we're going for it um brother malcolm were you here this morning like when we shook hands and all that i knew it i looked belinda okay i was told you were i was looking i was scanning the building for this pretty looking face and i couldn't see it [Laughter] come up here bro could you please come and open in prayer and just bring a greeting [Music] gracious father we have been so blessed oh god the way that you've come and we've been able to create an atmosphere of worship because you delight in the worship of your people but you're also searching oh god for a people that would worship you in spirit and in truth because lord you were tired down through all those years because of man-made systems but lord i believe over this weekend you've found some fountains of living water ones that lord have experienced life's challenges and have overcome because you said lord it would be those overcomers that would sit with you in your throne and lord even to the extent of judging angels so what a commission you've given us and what a blessing of god because as you allow the different expressions of the five-fold ministry to lord speak and we've heard our our names revealed in the book sometimes lord you've got to go deep down pastor god all of the outward feelings and emotions and get right down on the inside of the inside and various ministries you've used oh god to fulfill these things so we're thankful for you lord you you are a complete package oh god and we just pray lord that in this last service you would just by the sweetness of your holy spirit once once again come lord we like our brother was saying we we don't don't we just want to phase out the the meeting we want to be able to wind up even further because lord we want to take that anointing we want to take that aloha we want to take that divine love with us when we journey back up north we want to take oh god that fire of a revival with us so lord we ain't winding down we're winding up we're building up oh god until it builds such a rapturing faith amongst us that lord we could be on our way home and head home to glory thank you jesus but we're already booked in oh god we we got our token in our hand lord we we got our seats all already prepared and father as your word is declared in a moment in a twinkling of an eye there'll be a change so we look forward to even lord what you would bring to us uh this this afternoon this evening and we just want to say amen amen amen thank you lord for all of these things we commit the service into your hands i'm asking these things in the blessed name of our lord and savior jesus christ amen thank you jesus so we just want to greet you all in the precious name of our lord jesus christ um from the shekinah glory tabernacle up north because i i can say because brother freddie said we had been going for about 40 years it's just about 35 years and ben pinched the name from us but you know there's there's some great things that come out of the shekinah glory brother ben and i've got some testimonies to to be able to take home because out from the shekinah glory comes the glory of the lord and the glory of the lord is on display in the hearts of his people so i've seen that on display um while we've been here and uh you know i was saying the trees we we hadn't had an anniversary and we've been we're just about 35 years now and i was thinking man i'm gonna have to coach the church on how to say nice things about me i might just play the video brother ben i might play the video before i make the announcement coaching them on how to say nice things about their pasta but you know what i was so blessed when i when i heard our bro here mentioning about those nuggets on how to build up a church how to have such a respect for the ministry and i think these fellows are like they're like jonathan's armor bearer you know they stand by the side of the pasta and everyone is in their place everyone's there to fulfill a part of the vision and they're moving in that way it's like you know when jonathan went up to to go against a garrison him and his armor bearing the armor bear is he's not saying bro you sure we we can take this [Music] now all the armor bearers said was all that is in your heart will do it when jonathan felt that he could go up against that garrison the armor bearer doesn't doesn't hesitate that's what blessed me watching the things unfold today over this weekend is seeing these brothers that got up and and what we call they give their their toe toho behind the ministry you know they give their their vision of what has been happening over the last 10 years and what has made this anniversary the an anniversary to remember that's an anniversary like an anniversary of the passover when the death angel was writing and the applying of the token that was an anniversary for every year and here you have an anniversary of the success of a church you know a birthing of the church as i was hearing some of the the different trials and tests that you all would have been going through you know to get it that far and i understand that you know the birthing of of the fellowship the raising of these things the challenges that you face the ups and downs the the prayer meetings you know the prayer meetings over wellington the prayer meetings that would drive back those things to drive away old idols and you know drugs and pee and all of these kind of addictions and that's exactly how we were birthing the church in times like that we would have all night prayer meetings we would have prayer meetings for seven weeks day after day to bring that kind of revival because every revival starts from prayer trace any revival in the scripture and you'll find every revival came from prayer and that prayer takes dedication that takes those ones that were gathering around david that takes mighty gentiles to catch the vision and then each one walking in the vision in the way that god had expressed it when i see all the troubled water that we've been uh been through in the last three years and that's kept the bride apart for three years and you know that just allowed i was saying to brother freddie that's just allowed some of that hermit mentality to come on us you know and that hermit mentality is quite comfortable for some of us and it's a place where when we gather together we have such an appreciation of the goodness and the grace of god because we're back amongst believers we're back in the safety zone of the city of refuge christ we're backing amongst those that love him we're backing amongst those that have stood for the word and then we see the results of these things and it's just such a blessing to me you know to see these things and we want more of that we want more of that that's why i was saying in my prayer how that we want to take the revival we want to take the fire i believe we got some fires burning pretty bright up up from where we are too i've been really enjoying the worship i'm going to steal some of brother isaac's songs and maori eyes them as we call it but i've been really enjoying that and it's been such a pleasure to see you all in action it really is i've been been so blessed with that the worship you know we really have enjoyed that as well and if i could just impart a little thought for you a little nugget i i would say this from job chapter 38 i think it's around about verse 31. kenneth now bind the sweet influences of pleiades [Music] amen because what was those sweet influences of pleiades many times we were under the sweet influences of pleiades and we thought it was us because the sweet influences of pleiades was the seven stars that he had in his hand and we've been under the sweet influences of the seven star the prophet's message and without us even being aware of it he's watched over us he's blessed us he's kept us and then that sweet influence of the semester pleades actually led us to orion [Music] and there was only one time that was mentioned in the message about orion you realize that and that was when sister hope was on a deathbed and sister hope on a deathbed said i feel the great wings of orion coming to take me home that great rings of of orion is christ himself so the sweet influences of pleiades can you bind it can mandates blind the sweet influences of pleiades mandates can't do it can viruses bind the sweet influence of of pleiades can government policies bind the sweet influences of pleiades i say no absolutely not we are still under the benefits of those sweet influences lori but the sweet influences of pleiades led us to orion amen but what he is doing is he is loosing the bands of orion he's breaking the seals off of these books that's what i've been seeing in these meetings how that the lord has been breaking the seals of the books breaking away the inferiority complexes the superiority complexes breaking us away from any rough habits because sometimes you've got to go down into the refinery sometimes we've got to be down in the threshing floor to get rid of all of our chap to get rid of all of our humanity to get rid of anything that would hinder the breaking forth of the word from our soul so i'm thankful for those things brethren that's what i've felt in my own heart that he has been loosing the bands of orion so that the very resource the gene seed that god placed death in your soul can be liberated for a final ride isn't it the final ride we're just before the rapture we're not talking about being in seed time brethren we are in harvest time this is the harvest time it's almost home time and in harvest time the fruit has to be on the vine so once those seals have been broken up your heart we've been loose the bands of orion then watch the bride and watch the fruit because that's what i've been watching in these meetings i've been watching that fruit i've been watching the musicians play i've been watching the singers sing amen create creating an atmosphere for the word and i was so blessed brother pretty with that message you brought bro them old fellas can still ride brother hey those old fellas can still ride man hey amen so we just want to say thank you all and um you know we gotta we gotta take off quite early this this evening we promised theresa's family that we're going to a dinner that they had made for us we haven't seen a family for quite some time got to go to that dinner at six i'd love to be able to catch up you know some some old mates that i haven't been able to catch up with so far and some new ones that we're making some new faces new friends and we just want to say just like the other bread and we love you we look forward to you know gathering together for his namesake for his glory to display his glory in a time like this amen so god bless you all thank you

the lord amen this was not the song i had planned to sing so i was in my comfort zone that's the song i'll sing and then bread brother fred i don't know if he didn't know what he was saying he just started saying god's church is matching god's church is marching and everything changed god removed the song that i had picked and he put another one and i knew what he was saying now this is a special thanks to everyone that is here that is not from wellington i see we got brother malcolm when did we last meet brother malcolm 94 yeah 94 that's a long time much what has flown under the bridge since then but we are here together we have some brothers and sisters from south island brother malcolm all the way from up north hey it's a long way brethren from tara special thanks to you i know what it is to put all that effort to come down here this cost time it's got money it's cost a sacrifice so for everyone i might not mention you by name but we really appreciate what you have done because god's church is matching god's church has never been still it's marching one day god told the prophet i'm going to show you the fruits of your ministry and he showed the prophet the bride what was he doing when he showed it was he sitting what was she doing she was marching so we are still matching we're going home we are matching amen you got my song there can i have my song don't keep it

me [Music] is [Music] is [Music] [Applause] [Music] head [Music] come with me [Music] what's up [Music] is [Music] is [Music] is [Music] is [Music] is [Music] praise the lord brother alpha you're going to get through about one line of your notes up here bro it's fire anything you touch is going to catch fire you felt it too brother malcolm didn't you it goes man you start then it's off but that's the anointing of god and that's what he promised when we gather together he'll be there so and and that's the atmosphere we need for the word of god to go forth amen um we've got something a little for you now just before brother alpha comes we've got um just two worship songs um one of them is it's actually a new song which the only people that have heard it are the band and maybe a few people that are friends with the band you've all heard it then um i just want to explain a little bit about the song [Music] and it's funny because brother freddie and different ones have said things this morning and over the last few days that i was going to touch on when saying this but i'll start with this there's two things that i've done right in my life only two really and the first one is i've said yes to the call of the lord it's the first thing i've done right it's the most best decision you could ever make and the second thing that i've done right is that i have offered myself to the lord said lord here i am then this is me this is all i've got and believe it or not i haven't got much to offer the lord i haven't been natural at many things at all in my entire life i'm like the only thing i was natural at was accounting and that's not a very you know accounting it naturally came to me but nothing else did music it didn't come naturally i picked up went on the drums the first time i couldn't hardly play a beat it was so frustrating my brothers would get on there and just first time they're away boom they'll pick up the guitar and start playing i picked up the guitar i couldn't play nothing nothing worked it was everything was a struggle every that's like like the man that came to jesus the boy you know he just came with his lunch this is all i've got now it was a poor solution to a great need to a great problem five loaves like fish in a few loaves to 5 000 people but he brought it anyway and said this is all i've got this is what i'm going to offer you and i'm not saying there's just a bit of false humility the lord knows i'm not very good at stuff i i just like i finished school at 12 essentially i don't have an education i was thinking when i was 18 i'm like lord i've got no brains in me i haven't learned stuff most other people have learned things i haven't learned anything stopped school at 12. i thought lord the only thing i've done my whole teenage years is thought about you thought about wisdom and folly that's actually all i thought about when i boiled it down man what have i got to show for my high school education nothing because i stopped schooling my parents kept me at home everywhere i was went to school i just stayed at home by myself did nothing didn't learn anything my great parents but maybe education wasn't a great hive on the list i'm saying that because if you've got just you just have to offer the little that you've got honestly just offer this offer what you've got and and just do it if you the lord can take whatever and make something of it and because i guess i can say this it frustrated me a few about a month ago because i said lord i can't even sing i'd like to just be able to sing and praise you sometimes lord i just worship and i thought lord i've never really written a song that i can just i can kind of play katana enough to string together an idea so i thought maybe lord if i could string something together and then if you give me a voice that i can sing something to your lord for all the good things you've done for me and then i closed my eyes one day at night and i just pictured myself before the throne of god and i can see the throne there and i can see i can see the lord on his throne and i can hear all the angels singing maybe they've got three octaves they can sing from here to here i have about a three-quarter octave to sing and they've got this massive range and they're singing this these beautiful songs praising god singing holy holy holy and here's me up there with not a lot to offer but i felt like there was something in my heart that said god could i be so bashful that maybe i could interrupt their singing and say look you guys are nice it sounds nice and all but there's no heart to it i may not have i might not sound very good i may not be able to put much together but i've got heart with mine because i know what it is to be lost and i i know what that one seated on the throne has done for me he he's my savior i don't know what he is to you but to me he's my savior to me he's given me so many good things in my life and if i could just have this opportunity and if i'd be so bold to say you angels cannot join in on this one you can maybe do backing vocals if you like but it's not your song i said lord lord if i'm in that atmosphere lord could you could you give me a song that i could sing lord i could say bring me a guitar let me just strum out a little song lord to to show lord that [Music] you're the almighty god you're the almighty god [Music] and what would you stand this morning and i want you to when we sing the song just imagine you're before the throne of god and you're worshiping the lord jesus for what he's done for you angels sing [Music] holy holy [Music] [Music] [Laughter] you are [Music] [Music] [Music] is their crowns declaring you are alone we sing glory glory sing glory glory glory [Music] glory we sing holy

good it's been more than good it's been amazing hallelujah there's now god good look at that glory out of yours [Music] [Applause] i believe god is gonna he's gonna cap it off yes in the service i believe the lord is gonna just take over and we might have to go watch the service and see what happened amen let's just let god have his way lord respect my life take a man that i don't even know him but you know all about me and speak through him to me i mean the last time we had brother alpha preacher was the last it was a sunday evening service at our camp we had a couple of people received the holy ghost have been changed forever as with tiana and maggie that a time the the young ones around the altar my daughter annelise was praying what had just been preached and then just stopped praying and start screaming thanking god that that's true and rejoicing in it and praying a bit more and under the anointing and brother dave the lord spoke to him there he said i'm going to follow the lord you know god did tremendous things in that service and he did more than just that but you know so i believe the lord's going to meet us again tonight amen hallelujah so just as uh just as our brother alpha comes i mean let's just sing that chorus time or two are you amazed i'm amazed you know i'm amazed that he loves us you know i love that song brother isaac but you think about it god doesn't want us at the bottom of his throne looking up he wants us to sit with him in his throne he said to moses there's a place by me and that's what he wants sure we don't i feel like if you know the lord takes me to heaven i'm not worthy i just want to be down there if i see him far off i'll be happy but he doesn't he didn't call you just for you to be there he wants you by him on his throne and
