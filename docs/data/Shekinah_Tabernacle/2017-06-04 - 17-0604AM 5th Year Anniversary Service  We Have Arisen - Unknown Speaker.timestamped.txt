[1:02:47] bless you all amen
[1:02:50] amen so let's go to Micah chapter
[1:02:54] 7 verse 7 8 then we're going to go to
[1:02:57] Romans chapter
[1:03:17] 8 says therefore I will look unto the
[1:03:19] Lord I will wait for the god of my
[1:03:22] salvation my God will hear me re not
[1:03:26] against me oh my enemy who has an enemy
[1:03:28] this morning when I fall I shall arise
[1:03:31] when I sit in darkness the Lord shall be
[1:03:34] a light unto me amen amen let's go to
[1:03:37] Romans Romans chapter 8 amen as
[1:03:46] well Romans and and and 8 and verse1
[1:03:52] 15 go down to verse 23
[1:03:58] it says for we for ye so you should say
[1:04:01] I me have not received the spirit of
[1:04:04] bondage again to fear but I have
[1:04:06] received ye have received the spirit of
[1:04:08] adoption whereby I cry or we cry Abba
[1:04:11] Father you got to make the scripture
[1:04:12] personal the the spirit itself beareth
[1:04:14] witness with our spirit that we are the
[1:04:16] children of God and of children then
[1:04:18] ears ears of God and Joint ears with
[1:04:20] Christ if so be that we suffer with him
[1:04:23] that we may be also glorified together
[1:04:25] for I reckon that the sufferings of this
[1:04:27] present time are not worthy to be
[1:04:30] compared with the glory that shall be
[1:04:31] revealed in us for the earnest
[1:04:34] expectation of the creature waiteth for
[1:04:36] the manifestation of the sons of God for
[1:04:38] the creature was made subject to Van uh
[1:04:41] vanity not willingly but by reason of
[1:04:43] him who has subjected the same in Hope
[1:04:46] because the creature itself also also
[1:04:48] shall be delivered from the bondage of
[1:04:51] corruption into the Glorious Liberty of
[1:04:53] the children of God for we know that the
[1:04:56] whole creation granth and travaileth in
[1:04:58] pain together until now and not only
[1:05:01] they but ourselves also which have the
[1:05:03] first fruits of the spirit even we
[1:05:05] ourselves grown within ourselves waiting
[1:05:08] for for the adoption to Wi the
[1:05:11] Redemption of our body amen amen may the
[1:05:15] Lord bless his word you may have your
[1:05:17] seats I want if I could take a title
[1:05:20] this morning I would take it from Micah
[1:05:23] 7 and8 I shall arise
[1:05:26] we are living in a such an incredible
[1:05:28] time and I trust you know Peter says to
[1:05:30] way stir these things up in remembrance
[1:05:32] so if I go over some things that you've
[1:05:34] already heard before I trust it sinks a
[1:05:36] little bit deeper amen so now we are
[1:05:39] living in a season where the
[1:05:42] manifestation or that word actually
[1:05:43] means the revealing of the sons of God
[1:05:45] is being lived out amen that there are
[1:05:48] people upon the Earth that are not dead
[1:05:51] and trespasses and sins and are slaves
[1:05:53] to the enemy but they are are victorious
[1:05:57] amen they are sinless they are free
[1:05:59] people amen I trust you can say that's
[1:06:02] me amen that they are free people
[1:06:05] hallelujah that the that the revealing
[1:06:06] of the sons of God this scripture we
[1:06:08] just read is being manifested in your
[1:06:10] mortal body Hallelujah so we see Micah
[1:06:14] here the enemy he says Rejoice not
[1:06:16] against me oh my enemy when I fall I
[1:06:18] shall arise when I sit in darkness the
[1:06:21] Lord shall be a light unto me and we
[1:06:23] understand that you're the prophet of
[1:06:25] God he would go to Isaiah and chapter 60
[1:06:28] and verse 1 and maybe let's just turn
[1:06:30] there because when the you know when
[1:06:33] brother Brenham would would speak a
[1:06:35] sermon he is declaring a prophet
[1:06:38] declares things and our Prophet
[1:06:43] declared when when when he would read a
[1:06:46] when when he would go to Isaiah 60 and
[1:06:49] verse1 he would speak a sermon Shalom
[1:06:52] God's peace be upon you and he would say
[1:06:55] arise Shine for thy light has come and
[1:06:58] the glory of the Lord is risen upon thee
[1:07:01] for Behold The Darkness shall cover the
[1:07:02] Earth and gross Darkness the people but
[1:07:05] the Lord shall arise upon thee and His
[1:07:07] glory shall be seen upon thee amen so he
[1:07:11] is declaring now it's time to arise amen
[1:07:14] shine amen because the glory of the Lord
[1:07:17] has risen Hallelujah we've been gone
[1:07:20] down through seven Church ages and we're
[1:07:22] in the last Church age we know that but
[1:07:24] God God and this last hour has Shone a
[1:07:27] light that is stronger than anything
[1:07:30] that's been from Adam till now amen that
[1:07:32] God himself would be revealed in flesh
[1:07:34] in a redeemed son and that the word that
[1:07:37] would be spoken out of those prophets
[1:07:39] lips amen would have a creative power
[1:07:42] Hallelujah that would take a people that
[1:07:44] are in slavery and will go into it now
[1:07:46] and they would actually as Satan
[1:07:48] dethroned Adam because Adam forfeited
[1:07:51] his right to be God of the earth out of
[1:07:53] love for his wife am mean so now the
[1:07:55] table has been reversed and there's a
[1:07:58] people that are not under the bondage of
[1:07:59] Satan anymore but they Dethrone Satan
[1:08:02] and they take back what belongs to them
[1:08:05] Hallelujah because man was not made to
[1:08:07] be a slave I mean Adam's we Adam's
[1:08:10] Fallen race was not made we were not
[1:08:12] created to be slaves I mean a slave has
[1:08:16] no say what they do every day they have
[1:08:18] no say of what they eat what they wear
[1:08:20] what they do they are just pushed around
[1:08:22] like a you know just a piece of you know
[1:08:24] just an object
[1:08:26] and we know when you know you're on the
[1:08:27] slavery days you even go back into the
[1:08:30] you know Old Testament days where where
[1:08:32] Israel was was slaves in Egypt you know
[1:08:34] the Pharaohs thought more of their
[1:08:36] horses amen they thought more of their
[1:08:38] pets than they did the Israelites but
[1:08:40] yet the Israelites were were God's
[1:08:43] chosen people hallelujah and the devil
[1:08:45] doesn't care he doesn't think too much
[1:08:47] of us amen I'm sure you've come to that
[1:08:50] conclusion he doesn't think too much of
[1:08:52] us he's not scared of us but he's afraid
[1:08:55] if we can just get a hold of the promise
[1:08:56] of God Amen that that life would come
[1:08:59] into you and I amen the life that comes
[1:09:01] into you he's afraid of it Hallelujah so
[1:09:04] now we are not made remember Lucifer was
[1:09:07] made the Angels were made to be servants
[1:09:10] right they were made to be servants even
[1:09:12] Lucifer himself was the anointed Cher
[1:09:14] that cover he was a servant now a
[1:09:16] servant can never raise higher than the
[1:09:18] royal family they because they can never
[1:09:21] be part of the family right so now if
[1:09:24] he's meant to be a servant if he is
[1:09:27] ruling your life he is out of his
[1:09:29] position and you are out of your
[1:09:31] position right because Angels were made
[1:09:33] to serve you you were not made to serve
[1:09:36] Angels it doesn't matter if the angel is
[1:09:38] fallen or is or is still in the service
[1:09:40] of God they were still made to be
[1:09:42] servants but but us my friends were
[1:09:44] never made to be servants we are the
[1:09:47] sons and daughters of God Amen Allelujah
[1:09:50] We Are Made In His Image we're part of
[1:09:51] the family amen and the and the and the
[1:09:54] sons and daughters of the king do not
[1:09:56] serve the servants the servants serve
[1:09:58] them Hallelujah so now therefore if that
[1:10:01] is true which it is now even the Devil
[1:10:03] Himself must obey your voice amen
[1:10:06] because you are higher than him amen
[1:10:09] hallelujah we were created we were
[1:10:11] created that he would be under our feet
[1:10:14] amen and this is the hour where Satan
[1:10:16] all things are placed under the bride's
[1:10:17] feet amen hallelujah because we are not
[1:10:21] waiting to arise because the light has
[1:10:23] already come amen and and the light the
[1:10:26] Lord has put a light upon us that we
[1:10:27] shall arise if you're sitting in
[1:10:30] darkness my friend do not wait stay in
[1:10:32] darkness amen amen do not stay with just
[1:10:34] a fig Leaf religion amen amen you know a
[1:10:37] a message fig Leaf religion don't try
[1:10:39] and justify yourself amen come to him
[1:10:42] and he will restore you and place you
[1:10:44] where you should be hallelujah
[1:10:46] hallelujah hallelujah I'm so glad the
[1:10:48] power of the blood in this day is
[1:10:51] incredible anden you think about the how
[1:10:53] God can take a person and transform them
[1:10:57] and then not only transform them but
[1:10:59] they gain ground and they gain victories
[1:11:01] every day amen all all complexes get
[1:11:04] under their feet amen human human traits
[1:11:07] that are passed down are Broken
[1:11:09] Hallelujah even you people who have a
[1:11:10] temper you see it passed down through a
[1:11:12] family or a lust problem or
[1:11:13] unforgiveness problem but then when that
[1:11:16] when that person who who who now has
[1:11:18] that problem comes under the blood of
[1:11:20] Jesus Christ Hallelujah they don't need
[1:11:22] to worry about those things anymore amen
[1:11:24] because those things they get free from
[1:11:26] them Hallelujah and if the enemy tells
[1:11:29] you you can never be free cuz it's been
[1:11:30] in your family for Generation to
[1:11:32] generation that's a lie that is a Lie
[1:11:35] from the bottomless pit I would not
[1:11:36] accept it I would not hold on to it I
[1:11:38] would return it back to where it came
[1:11:40] from Hallelujah that's what we must do
[1:11:43] because man as I said Man was created to
[1:11:47] have total dominion over the Earth we
[1:11:50] read in Genesis 1 127 when God created
[1:11:53] man he said go so God created man in his
[1:11:56] own image in the image of God created he
[1:11:58] him male and female created he them and
[1:12:01] God blessed them and God said unto them
[1:12:03] be fruitful and multiply and replenish
[1:12:06] the Earth subdue it and have dominion
[1:12:08] over the fish of the sea and over the
[1:12:10] foul of the air and over every living
[1:12:12] thing that moveth upon the Earth so now
[1:12:15] if God is all powerful and man is
[1:12:18] created in His image then man is all
[1:12:20] powerful remember all things are
[1:12:22] possible to them that believe so there's
[1:12:24] nothing impossible with you I mean many
[1:12:27] times we know there's nothing impossible
[1:12:28] with God but now now it becomes a stage
[1:12:31] where there's nothing impossible with
[1:12:32] the believer because all things are
[1:12:35] possible to them that believe hallelujah
[1:12:37] amen so if God has total de your he God
[1:12:40] is God over everything he has total
[1:12:43] Dominion right so if Man was created in
[1:12:46] His image then man was to have total
[1:12:48] dominion over the Earth but then as I so
[1:12:51] that that is what we're been called to
[1:12:53] be restored to amen amen and I believe
[1:12:56] we're living in the hour this is not a
[1:12:57] carrot too far away maybe I'll grab it
[1:12:59] one day now is the hour friends the
[1:13:03] Saints of all ages have been waiting for
[1:13:04] where you are right now and if you could
[1:13:07] just recognize the power that's within
[1:13:08] your within you amen that the word is
[1:13:11] neither even in thy mouth you don't have
[1:13:14] to obtain anything you don't have to you
[1:13:16] evolve yourself into something God makes
[1:13:18] you thus Hallelujah you know as I read
[1:13:21] last Sunday brother Braham says that
[1:13:23] when Jesus was in the was in the desert
[1:13:25] in his Temptations He said now God
[1:13:28] himself was going to show that the
[1:13:30] weakest of Christians amen could take
[1:13:32] the word of God and defeat Satan any
[1:13:34] place anytime anywhere amen showing it
[1:13:37] doesn't matter what you think you are
[1:13:39] we're got to get our eyes off the off
[1:13:41] this guy amen stop stop trying to
[1:13:43] analyze your walk on what you think you
[1:13:45] are amen this is an unconditional
[1:13:48] Covenant amen God said I have made thee
[1:13:50] thus and you'll be thus amen amen so
[1:13:53] stop looking at the man in the mirror
[1:13:55] and start looking at this amen because
[1:13:57] we are a people of the open book and
[1:14:00] we'll go into it later on so God has
[1:14:02] released everything Adam had fell from
[1:14:05] and forfeited amen he has given back to
[1:14:07] man amen and now if that is the case now
[1:14:11] God has written a covenant with you am
[1:14:13] mean the prophet told us when Jesus was
[1:14:15] hanging on Calvary God was writing a
[1:14:17] covenant with the families of the earth
[1:14:19] amen so he was writing a promise with
[1:14:21] you Hallelujah that I'll not leave you a
[1:14:23] slave amen I'll not leave you down and
[1:14:26] beaten downtrodden amen but you'll arise
[1:14:30] you'll rise above your enemy hallel that
[1:14:32] they will be downrod they'll become the
[1:14:34] slave hallelujah amen this is how it's
[1:14:37] meant to be but we know so man forfeited
[1:14:41] he fell from his position as God over
[1:14:43] the Earth because he could not lose a
[1:14:46] part of himself you think of Adam he you
[1:14:50] know he waited it up he thought I cannot
[1:14:52] spend eternity without part of me yeah
[1:14:55] amen and Out of Love he knew he knew he
[1:14:57] had more ribs and even Medical Science
[1:15:00] has shown that you can remove a rib a
[1:15:01] certain way it'll
[1:15:02] regrow amen he knew he had more ribs but
[1:15:05] he didn't have another feminist part of
[1:15:07] himself so he could not stand the
[1:15:09] thought of spending cuz he was eternal
[1:15:11] at that stage before he fell he could
[1:15:12] not stand the thought of being being
[1:15:15] without the feminist part of himself he
[1:15:17] would he would be empty amen he wouldn't
[1:15:20] he'd be missing the vital part the
[1:15:22] you're the better heart amen all
[1:15:24] Brothers said amen amen hallelujah amen
[1:15:27] so you know so he forfeited his crown as
[1:15:30] as God over the Earth in order to to try
[1:15:33] and save his wife and so by him now by
[1:15:37] one man the scripture tells us sin
[1:15:38] entered into the world and death by sin
[1:15:41] and so death passed upon all men for
[1:15:44] that all have sinned so now a man where
[1:15:47] once he was made in the image of God all
[1:15:50] the attributes that were in God were in
[1:15:51] Adam he fell from that image and now he
[1:15:54] became a in a fallen State and so now
[1:15:57] whenever God has ordained positions like
[1:16:00] a king or a priest or a prophet or
[1:16:02] whatever it is something always fills
[1:16:05] the void that that person is not staying
[1:16:08] in that place you take Ahab he was King
[1:16:10] over Israel God ordained him to be king
[1:16:12] you know for someone to be king but
[1:16:15] because he didn't fully possess his
[1:16:16] office as king Jezebel filled the void
[1:16:18] that's right and something will always
[1:16:20] fill the void yes and so now you've got
[1:16:22] to be careful with with M and dad
[1:16:25] children those are officers husband wife
[1:16:28] father mother those are God ordained
[1:16:30] officers and if you do not possess that
[1:16:32] office take full responsibility of it
[1:16:34] something will fill that voice amen amen
[1:16:37] cuz it's God
[1:16:38] ordained and so now man fell from his
[1:16:42] position as as as God over the Earth so
[1:16:45] now Satan became the prince of the power
[1:16:47] of the air now brother bam he says and
[1:16:50] he says and let us reason together in
[1:16:52] 1955 I was going to read a few quotes
[1:16:55] now because people no this is this is
[1:16:57] just me people ask why do bad things
[1:16:58] happen and the first one they always
[1:17:00] blame is God if God is so good and just
[1:17:03] why do bad things happen it's very
[1:17:05] simple because man fell from his
[1:17:07] position and Satan took his place that's
[1:17:09] why there's that's why there's storms
[1:17:11] that's why there's natural disaster
[1:17:12] that's why there's sickness and strife
[1:17:14] between nations and War and killing and
[1:17:16] bloodshed it's because Satan is the
[1:17:18] prince of the power of the air am mean
[1:17:20] that's why bad things happen because man
[1:17:22] forfeited his place and fell right and
[1:17:25] so now Satan has taken his place he says
[1:17:28] and come and let us reason together in
[1:17:30] 1955 our public
[1:17:32] school I mean he's speaking about
[1:17:35] brother Billy Paul now man has fallen
[1:17:39] from Eden and continues to fall and
[1:17:42] brother bam and and come let us reason
[1:17:44] in 55 he begins to recount how brother
[1:17:46] Billy Paul he was he was young and he
[1:17:48] got out and you know he was in the
[1:17:49] schools and he started smoking
[1:17:51] cigarettes and so now brother Braham he
[1:17:54] saw a vision over him of him so you know
[1:17:57] you know um
[1:17:58] smoking and and he asked his son what
[1:18:02] are you doing smoking cigarettes he said
[1:18:03] I'm not I said don't lie to me Billy and
[1:18:05] he he commenced
[1:18:07] crying and and and Billy Paul said I
[1:18:11] won't do it no more daddy and he went
[1:18:12] out he kept on doing it he wasn't hiding
[1:18:15] it he can't hide it no no here's here's
[1:18:17] someone who's born in a fallen condition
[1:18:20] and his dad his dad is Malachi 4
[1:18:23] incredible imagine in that house and he
[1:18:26] even tried to lie to his dad no I'm not
[1:18:28] but of course God chose any everything
[1:18:31] and so now here was someone who said I
[1:18:32] won't do it no more and this is our
[1:18:34] condition too without a birth without a
[1:18:36] new birth we can intend to do right we
[1:18:39] can desire to serve God but unless our
[1:18:42] hearts have changed unless we've been
[1:18:44] converted amen we still have a fallen
[1:18:46] sin nature that we're born with and so
[1:18:50] he saw he saw Billy you know um he said
[1:18:53] I've seen a vision and the Lord showed
[1:18:55] me that Billy had disobeyed me and had
[1:18:57] jumped through a window and was going
[1:18:59] laughing Head Over Heels like that down
[1:19:01] down down um um on through eternity
[1:19:04] turning over and over and when I come
[1:19:07] out of the vision I was screaming at the
[1:19:08] top of my voice oh God don't take my boy
[1:19:11] only boy I have don't take him Lord I
[1:19:13] was screaming at the top of my voice and
[1:19:15] he says I told Billy even told him about
[1:19:18] the vision he said this is your state
[1:19:21] now it just goes to show you know
[1:19:23] someone can have a a vision of your life
[1:19:26] am mean can come and tell you about it
[1:19:28] can come and try and correct you about
[1:19:30] certain things but unless God comes and
[1:19:32] catches you amen unless the hands of God
[1:19:35] catch you we would be falling Hallelujah
[1:19:38] so people come and try and reason to you
[1:19:40] and say this is the way of righteousness
[1:19:42] is the way you should go you shouldn't
[1:19:44] do these things and and it may even
[1:19:45] sound right to your mind but if you're
[1:19:48] if you're still in a fallen State you
[1:19:50] will still go that way amen and that's
[1:19:52] why that's why we need God to catch
[1:19:55] amen amen and then then you know the
[1:19:57] rest of the story he went out fishing
[1:19:59] you know and then he you know and then
[1:20:02] he got you know he caught a cold he got
[1:20:04] a shot of penicillin Billy puled it and
[1:20:06] he ended up in hospital with a was an
[1:20:08] antic shock and he was going to die yeah
[1:20:10] this was now brother bam was crying out
[1:20:11] save my son and God's going to save him
[1:20:14] and then he's dying and then and then
[1:20:16] brother B's told get to him right quick
[1:20:18] you know and then
[1:20:19] he um and then he and he gets to the
[1:20:22] bedside and and and his son asks him
[1:20:24] pray for me Daddy he says no you do the
[1:20:27] you've done the sinning you do the
[1:20:29] praying and that's why it comes down to
[1:20:31] you and God amen amen you have to get
[1:20:35] serious amen you're you're the one you
[1:20:37] said I've heard this all you for years
[1:20:39] no but you're the one you got you're the
[1:20:42] one that's got to really cry out you're
[1:20:44] the one who's got to get to a space of
[1:20:46] desperation and then so he began to pray
[1:20:49] and then brother BR knelt down by the
[1:20:51] bedside he be to pray quietly he saw the
[1:20:53] same vision and his son falling he saw
[1:20:56] these two arms come strong arms catch
[1:20:58] him and pick him up and place him to
[1:21:00] where he was in the beginning Hallelujah
[1:21:03] but that was all of us amen we were all
[1:21:05] falling amen we're all and laughing
[1:21:07] thinking we're having a glorious time
[1:21:10] amen you may come you may have been
[1:21:11] raised in church amen but you're still
[1:21:14] falling whether you like it or not
[1:21:16] whether we like to think about it or not
[1:21:18] unless God catches us am amen we will
[1:21:21] continue to fall and we'll continue to
[1:21:23] laugh cuz man has a of nature to begin
[1:21:25] with but thanks be to God I trust who's
[1:21:28] been caught today amen who who felt the
[1:21:31] mighty arms of Jehovah catch them H and
[1:21:33] lift them up
[1:21:35] hallelujah amen so that's that is the
[1:21:38] way that man has been born amen but
[1:21:40] thanks be to God we don't remain that
[1:21:42] way we need God's hands of Grace Strong
[1:21:45] hands of the Lord to catch us amen and
[1:21:49] we need to call out upon God for those
[1:21:51] who are
[1:21:51] unsaved amen yes we got throw away this
[1:21:56] this putting up an image of everything's
[1:21:59] fine amen cuz if you cuz the devil could
[1:22:02] put you in a corner with that kind of
[1:22:04] mentality everything's fine praise the
[1:22:06] Lord Brother Hallelujah and and you can
[1:22:08] be falling you can be broken am mean you
[1:22:11] can have great needs but you have to
[1:22:13] speak it that's right you have to be the
[1:22:15] one that goes to God Amen you got to be
[1:22:17] the one that goes that talks to your
[1:22:18] pastor amen and get prayer because he is
[1:22:22] the high priest of our profession and he
[1:22:25] can't act on your behalf unless you
[1:22:27] speak it he cannot his hands are tied
[1:22:30] you H you tie we tie the hands of all
[1:22:33] the almighty God that made heavens and
[1:22:35] earth we tie his hands cuz we don't
[1:22:39] speak amen so speak the word amen if you
[1:22:42] have a need don't be afraid that's right
[1:22:44] we're in a battle together friend
[1:22:46] hallelujah we're in a battle together
[1:22:48] and we you know that song brother Isaac
[1:22:50] wrote my sword will not return empty you
[1:22:52] know what that means that means I've
[1:22:53] drawn my sword and it will take the head
[1:22:55] off the one I'm going to kill and that
[1:22:58] what it means it will not return empty
[1:22:59] and that should be the burning fire in
[1:23:02] our souls is that we will defeat the
[1:23:04] enemy amen we are you remember a Kinsman
[1:23:07] a kinsman redeemer he is our kinsman
[1:23:10] redeemer that's right amen he became
[1:23:12] flesh he became man to redeem us back to
[1:23:15] himself right but part of being a
[1:23:17] kinsman redeemer is the Avenger of blood
[1:23:20] amen so the Kinsman now has the has the
[1:23:22] privilege to find the enemy
[1:23:25] drag him out of the City of Refuge have
[1:23:27] a court hearing which he has amen and
[1:23:30] put him to death if he did it if he did

[1:23:41] God stood there with Adam and Eve and

[1:23:49] your belly you'll
[1:23:50] go he traced it back to the source and

[1:24:21] court hearing there's always two parties
[1:24:24] yeah one will be found guilty and one is

[1:24:30] down as Supreme judge and he has found
[1:24:33] Satan to be guilty amen amen he traced
[1:24:35] it back he traced it back through the
[1:24:37] word where did all this come from that's
[1:24:39] right amen it was Satan in the beginning
[1:24:41] iniquity was found in his heart when
[1:24:42] he's in the heavens that's right and he
[1:24:43] was cast down to the Earth Hallelujah
[1:24:46] but so he's been found guilty but then

[1:26:34] nothing that God canot restore as I said
[1:26:36] he's the kinsman redeemer he redeems

[1:26:57] restore amen there is nothing he cannot
[1:27:00] restore this is an age of restoration
[1:27:02] sometimes we just think of all the true
[1:27:04] Doctrine being restored no it's not just
[1:27:06] that amen it's a true Harmony between a
[1:27:09] husband and wife a true family
[1:27:12] relationship being restored Hallelujah
[1:27:14] we live in that hour that's right I'm so
[1:27:17] glad it's that case there's nothing God
[1:27:19] cannot do amen that's right Ephesians 2
[1:27:22] and 1
[1:27:24] and you have he quickened who were dead
[1:27:26] in trespasses and sins when in times
[1:27:29] past you walked according to the course
[1:27:31] of this world see you're a slave
[1:27:33] according to the prince of the power of
[1:27:34] the year the spirit that now worketh in
[1:27:37] the children of
[1:27:39] Disobedience among whom also we all had
[1:27:42] our conversation see even the Apostle
[1:27:43] Paul throws himself in here we all had
[1:27:45] our conversation in times past and the
[1:27:48] lust of our flesh fulfilling the desires
[1:27:50] of the Flesh and of the mind and were by
[1:27:52] Nature the children of Wrath even as
[1:27:54] others but God who is rich in Mercy for
[1:27:56] his great love wherewith he loved us
[1:27:59] even when we were dead in sins hath
[1:28:01] quickened us together with Christ by
[1:28:03] Grace ye are saved and ha raised us up
[1:28:06] together and made us sit together in
[1:28:09] Heavenly places in Christ Jesus that in
[1:28:11] the ages to come he might show the
[1:28:13] exceeding Riches of his grace and his
[1:28:16] kindness towards us through Christ Jesus
[1:28:18] for by grace are ye saved through faith
[1:28:22] and that not of yourselves it is the the
[1:28:24] gift of God not of Works lest any man
[1:28:26] should boast for we are his workmanship
[1:28:29] created in Christ Jesus under good works
[1:28:31] which God hath before ordained that we
[1:28:34] should walk in them so as we can see we
[1:28:39] were
[1:28:39] slaves amen we walked according to the
[1:28:42] course of this world according to the
[1:28:44] prince of the power of the air so we
[1:28:46] were once a slave under what Satan would
[1:28:50] have us do it doesn't matter if we're
[1:28:52] raised in church how good our family was
[1:28:54] whatever we were all born
[1:28:57] slaves that's right but that is not the
[1:28:59] end of the
[1:29:00] story amen even we you know you when we
[1:29:03] think of the lust of our flesh you know
[1:29:05] normally we think of some kind of sexual
[1:29:06] sin but really the desires of the flesh
[1:29:09] the lust of the flesh is really just
[1:29:10] doing what you want to
[1:29:12] do what does my body feel like doing
[1:29:14] today I'll just
[1:29:15] relax you know it's just it's just being
[1:29:18] caral that's right amen but now but God
[1:29:22] would not leave us in that
[1:29:25] because there's a position that he wants
[1:29:27] to raise us to and we read there in
[1:29:29] verse six he has raised us up together
[1:29:32] and made us sit in Heavenly places in
[1:29:34] Christ Jesus now this heavenly places is
[1:29:37] the believer's position in Christ amen
[1:29:39] right so it's the position that Adam was
[1:29:41] in before the fall amen but now because
[1:29:44] man fell Satan took that position and
[1:29:47] became the prince of this power of the
[1:29:48] earth so there has to be now a
[1:29:52] war where Satan is the squatter cuz he
[1:29:55] doesn't own it it's not his rightful
[1:29:57] position amen that is not what God
[1:30:00] ordained him to be he with me and so
[1:30:03] there has to be a revolution or a war
[1:30:05] whatever you want to call it where man
[1:30:07] now is elevated defeat Satan and takes
[1:30:11] what should be man
[1:30:13] amen now brother baram he um he says in
[1:30:16] he says in the mighty
[1:30:18] conqueror he says and while after I mean
[1:30:21] and after a while you're a cigarette
[1:30:23] fiend he'll tell you there's no harm in
[1:30:25] taking a socialable drink I've stood by
[1:30:28] them before they went to Gallows stood
[1:30:30] by them before they was
[1:30:32] electrocuted and and they would say I
[1:30:34] never intended to says he to be a
[1:30:36] gambler I never intended when I was
[1:30:38] playing cars to be a gambler I never
[1:30:40] intended to botle out of a filling
[1:30:43] station I never intended to be a thief
[1:30:45] but only thing the devil wants you to do
[1:30:47] is start and he'll take you on see we
[1:30:50] never we never really you know it's like
[1:30:52] the prodical son he never intended to
[1:30:55] leave the promised land and and fall
[1:30:58] into such a state where he was feeding
[1:31:00] an animal that was an Abomination to him
[1:31:02] yes and he was in such a deprived State
[1:31:05] he wanted the food that the scraps of
[1:31:07] food given to the pigs he never foresaw
[1:31:10] his decision would take him there and
[1:31:12] it's the same thing with us when we have
[1:31:15] a selfish desire I want to I want to do
[1:31:18] this for me
[1:31:20] amen and you step out of the word
[1:31:24] you never foresee it would take you to
[1:31:26] certain places right but thanks be to
[1:31:31] God we don't have to stay there amen
[1:31:35] that's why people say I never intended
[1:31:36] to do such and such it's because you're
[1:31:38] still a
[1:31:39] slave and he says get over on his ground
[1:31:41] one time and watch him you know what it
[1:31:43] means to do wrong but there's an
[1:31:44] influence of the power of Darkness the
[1:31:46] prince of the power of the air that
[1:31:48] leads you traps trapped into these
[1:31:50] things you've got to stand up separate
[1:31:52] yourself from the things the World come
[1:31:54] out and live for Christ that's right
[1:31:57] that's in prodical in 50 and then 1956
[1:31:59] the Great and Mighty conqueror and in
[1:32:01] the great Millennium which is to come
[1:32:03] the Bible said Rejoice all ye heavens
[1:32:05] and ye holy prophets for the kingdoms I
[1:32:07] mean for the uh Earth I mean you holy
[1:32:10] prophets of the Earth for the kingdoms
[1:32:12] of this Earth have become the kingdoms
[1:32:13] of our Lord and He Shall Rule and Reign
[1:32:15] forever now we will become we'll have no
[1:32:18] more war there when he comes no more
[1:32:20] sickness no more trouble notice when he
[1:32:23] died there was so little spoke of of his
[1:32:26] Ascension it's one of the greatest days
[1:32:28] when he ascended up amen CU all over the
[1:32:30] Earth since since the day in the Garden
[1:32:32] of Eden that sin was committed all
[1:32:34] Heavens was shut off from mankind Satan
[1:32:37] is the prince of the power of the a
[1:32:38] that's right why art thou fallen from
[1:32:40] Heaven oh Lucifer no man can see into
[1:32:42] Glory no man could understand because
[1:32:44] the power is just above us Heaven means
[1:32:47] atmosphere above and then all these
[1:32:49] Powers were shut off from mankind
[1:32:51] because of sin amen that's how bad it
[1:32:54] was when Man became a slave that we were
[1:32:56] trapped upon the Earth we couldn't have
[1:32:58] any access to heaven but I'm so glad
[1:33:01] amen that one day amen amen the first
[1:33:04] promise that that God ever made of
[1:33:06] redemption was that the seat of the
[1:33:08] woman was going to come and undo
[1:33:10] everything that that that Satan did
[1:33:12] through the serpent that day amen that
[1:33:14] when heaven was shut off you that's why
[1:33:15] you read in Genesis 5 where the sons of
[1:33:18] God I mean sons of Adam then they began
[1:33:20] to call upon the name of the Lord
[1:33:22] because they calling upon his name cu
[1:33:23] wanted to know when will this be undone
[1:33:26] when will we Return to Eden amen and
[1:33:28] we're about to step into Eden hallelujah
[1:33:30] hallelujah amen so they were calling
[1:33:32] because they knew Heavens were shut off
[1:33:35] imagine that you're sitting around a
[1:33:36] campfire and your granddad or great
[1:33:38] Granddad is
[1:33:40] Adam the topic of the conversation
[1:33:42] always be you know you see that Hill
[1:33:44] there I moved
[1:33:46] it I didn't like this tree I said tree
[1:33:49] move over there and it obeyed me
[1:33:50] hallelujah amen I just I just rearranged
[1:33:53] this just right and you know Eve wanted
[1:33:54] it this way so I said move here be a
[1:33:57] plane and do this you know and then from
[1:33:59] one day to the next I could say the I
[1:34:02] I'd say the same words so I'll show you
[1:34:04] Mountain be there or removed it doesn't
[1:34:06] move tree be moved it's still there
[1:34:09] imagine that there'd be a longing but no
[1:34:12] doubt thatd always come end the story
[1:34:14] but you know then he came we were afraid
[1:34:17] when he came cuz we thought we were
[1:34:18] going to be destroyed But Here Comes The
[1:34:20] Judge Amen to Pardon his children to
[1:34:22] give them a promise
[1:34:24] me they're not going to stay in that
[1:34:25] situation Hallelujah then we heard the
[1:34:27] voice of God walking in the garden I was
[1:34:30] afraid I never knew what it was like to
[1:34:31] be afraid I had a fear come upon me
[1:34:33] Hallelujah then he came down and he
[1:34:35] closed us with skins lamb skins he
[1:34:37] killed some Lambs covered us up covered
[1:34:39] our sin up we felt the blood dripping
[1:34:41] down our legs as the prophet said as as
[1:34:44] we walked out of the
[1:34:45] garden Hallelujah imagine that kind of
[1:34:48] conversation and how how impossible it
[1:34:51] would be for Adam to really describe the
[1:34:53] greatness of being in the
[1:34:55] garden amen because it's greater than
[1:34:57] the best day of our life it's better
[1:35:00] than the best I whatever the best moment
[1:35:03] of your life is it's far greater than
[1:35:05] that amen words can not even touch it
[1:35:09] but yet then they had a desire Lord when
[1:35:11] is this going to come when is this going
[1:35:13] to come back but heaven was shut off but
[1:35:17] then under the blood of bulls and goats
[1:35:18] man had had a limited access to heaven
[1:35:21] where under the blood of an animal he
[1:35:23] just think an animal does not animal
[1:35:25] blood doesn't change us many times when
[1:35:27] we we look at ourselves I was thinking
[1:35:29] about this in the week you know we
[1:35:32] always look at the negative side of
[1:35:35] ourselves man yeah that's man's
[1:35:37] condition we always look at the negative
[1:35:39] we always think you know we always see
[1:35:40] the negative sides of ourselves oh but
[1:35:42] look at the positives being too proud no
[1:35:45] I don't think so and we always think
[1:35:47] then and then if we look at the negative
[1:35:49] side of our walk then we get a fear or
[1:35:51] God's going to deal with us we need to
[1:35:53] be corrected and you begin to get a fear
[1:35:55] between you and God but you just got to
[1:35:58] think about Israel coming I was thinking
[1:36:00] about Israel coming from Egypt to the
[1:36:01] promised land here they were traveling
[1:36:03] through Moab on their journey and there
[1:36:06] was a false prophet there that they hide
[1:36:08] Moab hide balum and he came down and he
[1:36:11] he gave the same sacrifices that Israel
[1:36:13] did the spirit of God Came Upon him and
[1:36:16] now God is going to speak his opinion of
[1:36:18] Israel and he says I see no iniquity in
[1:36:21] Jacob hallelujah amen I see no sin in
[1:36:24] them I see nothing wrong with my people
[1:36:27] and here's a people they're under the
[1:36:29] blood of bulls and goats they're
[1:36:31] unconverted am me they still have caral
[1:36:33] nature I mean but when God looks down
[1:36:35] upon them he says I see no iniquity I
[1:36:38] see nothing wrong with them Hallelujah
[1:36:41] they had their problems they offered
[1:36:42] countless thousands of bulls and sheep
[1:36:45] and goats to cover their sin am mean
[1:36:47] none of their sacrifice changed their
[1:36:48] nature am mean this the very nature that
[1:36:51] caused them to do the sin and give the
[1:36:53] sacrifice after they gave the sacrifice
[1:36:55] they had the same nature it didn't
[1:36:57] change them one bit but yet when God
[1:36:59] looked down upon them he says I see no
[1:37:01] iniquity amen for the shout of the king
[1:37:03] is among them Hallelujah CU God was
[1:37:05] walking with his people amen if that's
[1:37:07] under the blood of bulls and goats
[1:37:09] friends how much more people under the
[1:37:11] blood of Jesus Christ I me that are
[1:37:13] walking with him in this hour in his
[1:37:14] word hallelujah you got this is how God
[1:37:17] sees you friend I see no iniquity in
[1:37:19] them Hallelujah you just got to you got
[1:37:21] to look through God's eyes amen oh how
[1:37:23] am I ever going to take a Rapture he
[1:37:25] says I see no iniquity in you your sins
[1:37:28] are not just covered they're done away
[1:37:30] with thank you Lord hallelujah they are
[1:37:32] not attributed to your account at all
[1:37:34] your slate has been washed am
[1:37:38] hallelujah amen so under the blood of
[1:37:40] bulls and goats man had a limited access
[1:37:43] Amen to Heavenly
[1:37:44] places but under the blood of bulls and
[1:37:47] goats Hallelujah they conquered a land
[1:37:50] they came out of Egypt under the power
[1:37:52] of power of God
[1:37:54] amen the Red Sea was parted plagues came
[1:37:56] down on on on Egypt amen and God
[1:37:59] liberated his people under the blood of
[1:38:01] bulls and goats and brother baham said
[1:38:03] now if man could do that under the blood
[1:38:05] of bulls and goats what about a people
[1:38:07] under the blood of Jesus Christ amen
[1:38:10] where it's not just covered it's been
[1:38:11] it's been divorced from theml Hallelujah
[1:38:14] that the chasm between you and God has
[1:38:16] been
[1:38:16] bridged amen he says now we could have
[1:38:19] real sermon he's preaching in the prach
[1:38:20] Lord hallelujah oh but I'm not a prophet
[1:38:23] the bride of Christ amen I will ask you
[1:38:26] a question when alasa went to get
[1:38:28] Rebecca who was greater amen Alazar or
[1:38:32] Rebecca Rebecca was greater Rebecca was
[1:38:35] the one that the you know that that the
[1:38:37] father wanted for his son amen that's
[1:38:39] Hallelujah alaza was just a servant amen
[1:38:42] amen and here we are hey we should I I
[1:38:45] love the life of the Prophet I preach

[1:38:49] from his testimonies you know how he
[1:38:51] conducted himself his character and
[1:38:52] nature those things are incredible but
[1:38:55] we place them sometimes up here too much

[1:39:29] with what we need to make all the rest

[1:44:24] says Heavenly
[1:44:26] places he says he's the prince of the
[1:44:28] power of the air he he keeps off he
[1:44:30] Wards off the blessings from God and
[1:44:32] there comes Thunderbolts of lightning
[1:44:34] and Strikes the Earth and everything
[1:44:35] from the heavens sheets of ice and rain
[1:44:37] and typhoons and storms and everything
[1:44:39] comes from above which is Satan the
[1:44:41] prince of the power of the year that's
[1:44:42] why these bad things happen amen and as
[1:44:46] we read so Christ the mystery God
[1:44:47] revealed he says what is Heavenly places
[1:44:49] Heavenly places is the believer's
[1:44:51] position in Christ so now there's a war
[1:44:54] going on where man is retaking his
[1:44:58] position as God of the earth amen you
[1:45:01] say well that's going to happen in the
[1:45:02] Millennium now God is going to
[1:45:03] demonstrate it now in a people that
[1:45:06] there's a people upon the Earth that
[1:45:08] have dominion over hell death in the
[1:45:09] grave amen it has Dominion everything of
[1:45:12] the enemy is conquered remember the
[1:45:14] devil's already conquered amen he's
[1:45:17] already defeated we Face a defeated F
[1:45:19] foe amen he does he's just a bluff
[1:45:23] you got to call his
[1:45:24] hand you hear the prophet say Satan
[1:45:27] you're nothing but a bluff amen amen you
[1:45:29] have to call his hand don't be afraid
[1:45:31] he's got no gun he's got no
[1:45:33] weapon amen do not be afraid of him you
[1:45:36] have to call his
[1:45:38] blood
[1:45:40] Hallelujah now let's go to Ephesians
[1:45:43] 6:10 and I heard this um coming from the
[1:45:47] Sunday school I say praise the Lord amen
[1:45:51] Ephesians 6:10
[1:45:53] now this is our
[1:45:57] Warfare Ephesians 6:10 it says finally
[1:46:00] my brethren be strong in the Lord and in
[1:46:03] the power of His might put on the whole
[1:46:06] armor of God that ye may able to stand
[1:46:08] against the walls of the devil for we
[1:46:11] wrestle not against flesh and blood but
[1:46:13] against principalities against Powers
[1:46:15] against the rulers of Darkness of this
[1:46:18] world against spiritual wickedness in
[1:46:21] high places now this word high places
[1:46:23] the same as Heavenly places we read
[1:46:25] about in Ephesians 2 amen so there's so
[1:46:27] there's demon powers in a place where
[1:46:30] which is actually ordained for you that
[1:46:32] you actually have to cast them down and
[1:46:34] take your rightful position in Christ
[1:46:36] hallelujah amen so there is a war now we
[1:46:39] fight against demon powers that's why
[1:46:41] you find big cities there's more demons
[1:46:43] there where people are there's a greater
[1:46:45] Congregation of devils amen so now there
[1:46:48] is and we understand Satan's kingdom
[1:46:51] he's the ruler but it's a broken thing
[1:46:53] but there's demon powers over cities and
[1:46:56] Nations amen over suburbs and areas and
[1:46:58] we rule against we we fight against them
[1:47:01] amen amen but we have been given
[1:47:03] dominion over them amen just like Daniel
[1:47:06] Daniel was praying he prayed what 20 OD
[1:47:09] days waiting for the answer from God and
[1:47:11] the angel that was coming to bring the
[1:47:12] answer was fighting against a demon
[1:47:15] power and and that demon power was
[1:47:17] blocking the visitation of the
[1:47:19] Angel amen and if the say you if that's
[1:47:22] a you know I was thinking today I didn't
[1:47:24] work it out but one will chase a th000
[1:47:26] and two 10,000 that means three will
[1:47:31] chase 100,000 four will chase a million
[1:47:35] five will chase 10 million six will
[1:47:37] chase 100 million seven will chase I
[1:47:40] think am I going a billion now yeah is
[1:47:43] that seven seven now there's been
[1:47:47] 2,000,000 demons released from the river
[1:47:49] eup frics which I think is 200 million
[1:47:52] or 200 million million okay there's more
[1:47:56] Believers in this
[1:47:58] room compared to them there's more for
[1:48:01] us so there's what 60 on I how many
[1:48:04] people are here just say there's 60
[1:48:06] people that is more power you understand
[1:48:09] you can chase all of the powers of hell
[1:48:12] all the Believers in this room United
[1:48:15] together can can can chase all the
[1:48:17] powers of Hell upon the Earth have you
[1:48:19] ever thought about that oh there's so
[1:48:21] much Darkness oh there's so much light a
[1:48:23] hallelujah oh there's so much evil
[1:48:25] there's so much good Hallelujah there's
[1:48:27] more power friends we could we have more
[1:48:30] if all of hell if there was a pitch
[1:48:32] battle between us and all of hell we
[1:48:34] would win amen cuz we actually have more
[1:48:36] power than them anyway Hallelujah but
[1:48:39] that's how powerful Unity
[1:48:41] is amen
[1:48:44] now so man has been fighting this battle
[1:48:47] to Dethrone Satan out of out of heavenly
[1:48:50] places but now because but now we've
[1:48:53] come into a season where God is adopting
[1:48:56] or placing his children back into
[1:48:58] Heavenly places amen that the power of
[1:49:01] the blood now is restoring a people back
[1:49:03] to their original position so we are
[1:49:06] called to tear Satan's kingdom down Amen
[1:49:09] to break the cycle of generational
[1:49:12] traits and curses which are not of God
[1:49:14] Amen the things that Trace through
[1:49:16] families we have the authority and power
[1:49:19] to break them amen This Is the End you
[1:49:22] know brother B spoke of a season of
[1:49:24] Revival and death and Revival and death
[1:49:26] you know we've come to the end of that
[1:49:28] season that's right right we're not here
[1:49:30] just to have a season of Revival and
[1:49:33] death but now he himself has come in
[1:49:36] spirit form to break that
[1:49:38] cycle amen that now the things that once
[1:49:42] plagued us must come to an end amen amen
[1:49:47] you know God God told Joshua to
[1:49:49] circumcise the people again and he told
[1:49:52] them to do that and he says now I have
[1:49:54] rolled away the reproach of Egypt from
[1:49:56] you you got to read about it so there
[1:49:59] came a there came a time in their walk
[1:50:02] where the the slave history that they
[1:50:05] had all of their past everything that
[1:50:08] for 400 years they were in bondage and
[1:50:10] you know down in Egypt that reproach was
[1:50:12] rolled away amen right and now we are
[1:50:16] living in that same kind of hour now
[1:50:17] we're not this side of Jordan we've
[1:50:19] crossed over but there has to come a
[1:50:21] time where God actually anchors it down
[1:50:23] into your heart the reproach of your old
[1:50:26] life the reproach of what you used to be
[1:50:29] cuz don't let your past condemn you the
[1:50:32] the reproach of what you used to be has
[1:50:34] been rolled away Hallelujah because in
[1:50:37] God's mind he knows you're forgiven he
[1:50:38] knows you're sinless he knows you're
[1:50:40] perfect I mean he knows you've been
[1:50:41] redeemed and called and Justified and
[1:50:43] glorified am mean he knows those things
[1:50:45] but he needs you to know it he needs you
[1:50:47] to recognize what you are am mean if God
[1:50:50] is for us who can be against us
[1:50:52] hallelujah it's God that justifies you
[1:50:54] God that calls God that glorifies amen
[1:50:57] he that have called I've also Justified
[1:50:59] he have Justified I've already glorified
[1:51:02] it's easy to say but God needs you to
[1:51:04] know hallelujah amen now we read there
[1:51:08] in Romans
[1:51:09] 8 the manifestation or the revelation of
[1:51:12] the sons of God the whole earth is
[1:51:14] waiting for us to come to our position
[1:51:16] I've heard this for years but now's the
[1:51:18] hour yes amen amen where it's not just
[1:51:21] maybe a doctrine that goes forth becomes
[1:51:22] a living reality you see like you going
[1:51:25] to you know we all have sure trials and
[1:51:27] hardship you going to a believer's home
[1:51:31] and you see there's like Eden is now
[1:51:32] just being created yeah there's a peace
[1:51:35] in you know there can be Strife you I
[1:51:37] mean cuz we're all all Temptations we
[1:51:38] suffer com you know all those things but
[1:51:41] yet there is something there's an
[1:51:43] atmosphere that the believer lives
[1:51:45] in that it becomes common to us and we
[1:51:49] take it for
[1:51:50] granted and we actually begin to think
[1:51:52] we're living below our privileges
[1:51:53] sometimes but people will come into your
[1:51:56] house that know nothing about God or
[1:51:57] even just denominational people and they
[1:51:59] will be so
[1:52:01] amazed by the atmosphere amen amen by by
[1:52:05] by how your family is and it's not good
[1:52:07] behavior it's not good behavior it does
[1:52:09] it but God has come
[1:52:12] down don't take it for granted am don't
[1:52:15] take it for granted the atmosphere that
[1:52:17] you live in every day don't let it
[1:52:19] become common to you amen amen amen amen
[1:52:23] because why we're said he made us he's
[1:52:25] made us to sit in Heavenly places amen
[1:52:27] amen so he's going to make us sit there
[1:52:30] Hallelujah you don't have to try and
[1:52:32] climb up there he makes you sit
[1:52:35] there hallelujah amen let's go to
[1:52:38] Revelations chapter 10 just
[1:52:42] quickly CU we have a
[1:52:46] responsibility Revelations 10 and we'll
[1:52:48] read from verse
[1:52:50] 8 as I said heaven was shut
[1:52:53] off from man but then Jesus came amen
[1:52:58] Jehovah's salvation Came Upon the Earth
[1:53:01] the greatest man to be alive God
[1:53:03] Emmanuel our Kinsman came down amen
[1:53:07] hallelujah opened up Heaven glory amen
[1:53:10] that that that that that from his from
[1:53:12] from his death burial Resurrection now
[1:53:15] into Pentecost now heaven was fully open
[1:53:17] to a people and when we're a people who
[1:53:20] once scared you know like Peter tried to
[1:53:23] cut a guys air off swore and deny the
[1:53:25] Lord when pressure came on they were
[1:53:27] totally different people after that why
[1:53:29] because heaven had become open to them
[1:53:31] personally amen but now there comes a a
[1:53:36] time
[1:53:37] where what Adam lost has been placed
[1:53:40] into the hands of man again amen amen
[1:53:43] amen and so now as I said now the title
[1:53:46] deed to the Earth was sealed up and it
[1:53:49] went to the original Creator right but
[1:53:52] but then now after seven Church ages the
[1:53:54] lamb steps forth now you say well if
[1:53:57] he's off the throne is there Mercy well
[1:53:59] the Bible says that heaven and his
[1:54:00] Heaven is his throne so when we
[1:54:03] physically our bodies are changed and we
[1:54:05] meet him in the air that's when Mercy's
[1:54:06] over because that's the physical coming
[1:54:09] of our Lord Jesus amen but he hasn't
[1:54:11] left Heaven yet in that way his spirit
[1:54:15] is here are you following me his spirit
[1:54:18] is here everything that he is is here
[1:54:21] amen everything he is but physically his
[1:54:23] body is still at the right hand of
[1:54:24] majesty on high interceding on your
[1:54:26] behalf that's why there's still mercy
[1:54:29] and I'm so glad there's still Mercy
[1:54:31] today amen I'm so glad the door is open
[1:54:34] still Hallelujah brother R said just
[1:54:36] keep doing what you're doing if you're
[1:54:37] called to be an evangelist go evangelize
[1:54:39] whatever you call do keep doing it until
[1:54:41] you're taken away amen we don't want to
[1:54:44] try and seal up Heaven amen but Mercy is
[1:54:47] greater today than it ever has been in
[1:54:48] all all of the ages so now
[1:54:52] the now so the lamb steps forth and
[1:54:55] remember John now John is actually a
[1:54:58] symbol in the book amen it's a remember
[1:55:00] the Book of Revelation is a book of
[1:55:02] symbols okay so John himself is a symbol
[1:55:05] amen when he at you at the end of the
[1:55:07] church ages he he he sees the open door
[1:55:10] in heaven a voice says come up hither
[1:55:12] and that's the Rapture of the church one
[1:55:13] man in a vision represents a whole body
[1:55:15] amen right so now when John turns in
[1:55:18] Revelations 5 and sees the lamps you
[1:55:20] know sees the line of the tribe of Judah
[1:55:22] stepping forth he turns he actually sees
[1:55:24] the lamb now there's not a lamb in the
[1:55:26] line they're the same person just like
[1:55:29] I'm a father and I'm a son and I'm a
[1:55:31] uncle and all different kinds of things
[1:55:33] but but they're just different officers
[1:55:35] that I have and I'm a husband right and
[1:55:37] so now so so the same one stepped forth
[1:55:40] the same one that he leaned upon the
[1:55:41] bosom of in the days of his flesh but
[1:55:44] when he turned and saw him he saw a lamb
[1:55:47] he saw Mercy he saw an atonement yes he
[1:55:49] didn't see the king who's going to judge
[1:55:52] and tread down the nations with a rod of
[1:55:54] iron he saw his atonement stepping forth
[1:55:56] am amen and I pray that is the same
[1:55:59] thing when you look into this word you
[1:56:01] do not see a judge or an Angry God Amen
[1:56:04] but you see a lamb you see a blood you
[1:56:07] see a high priest you see an intercessor
[1:56:10] you see a mediator Hallelujah you see
[1:56:13] your Advocate amen an advocate works on
[1:56:15] your behalf and we have an advocate
[1:56:17] Jesus Christ the righteous Hallelujah so
[1:56:20] when he turns he sees the lamb M but
[1:56:22] then now he takes the book and we know
[1:56:25] he looses the seals then now that title
[1:56:28] deed to the Earth here's your
[1:56:30] inheritance coming down and its fullness
[1:56:33] remember it's all symbolic because the
[1:56:35] mighty angel that Des sends in in in
[1:56:37] verse one with the Covenant upon his
[1:56:39] head rainbow and a cloud this is this is
[1:56:42] the anointing coming down this is Jesus
[1:56:44] Christ in spirit form amen coming down
[1:56:48] and then let's just and he had in his
[1:56:50] hand a little book open he said his
[1:56:51] right foot upon the Sea and the left
[1:56:53] upon the Earth and cried with a loud
[1:56:55] voice as a lion Roth and when he had
[1:56:57] cried seven uh seven Thunders uted their
[1:56:59] voices and when the seven Thunders had
[1:57:01] Ed their voices I was about to write and
[1:57:04] I Heard a Voice from Heaven saying unto
[1:57:05] me seal up those things which the seven
[1:57:07] Thunders Ed write them not and the angel
[1:57:10] which I saw stand upon the scene upon
[1:57:12] the Earth lifted up his hand to heaven
[1:57:14] and swear by him that liveth forever and
[1:57:16] ever who created heaven and the things
[1:57:18] that there in are and the earth and the
[1:57:20] things that there in are and the sea and
[1:57:22] the things that there in are that time
[1:57:24] should be no longer and that means there
[1:57:25] shall be no more delay and he's swearing
[1:57:28] by he's actually swearing by himself cuz
[1:57:31] he made all things he's swearing by
[1:57:33] himself there shall be no more delay so
[1:57:36] in other words what has been taring for
[1:57:38] seven Church ages amen now I'm going to
[1:57:40] wind up my plan I'm going to take a
[1:57:43] people and put them into Heavenly places
[1:57:44] I'm going to make them in my image am
[1:57:46] mean I'm going to magnify the power of
[1:57:48] the blood Hallelujah I'm going to
[1:57:50] transform people into my image amen amen
[1:57:52] that they will be adopted as Sons and
[1:57:54] Daughters of God yes there's no more
[1:57:57] delay Hallelujah that I'm going to I'm
[1:57:59] going to take the people from the earth
[1:58:01] that are alive and remain amen amen the
[1:58:03] enemy's come going to come to his place
[1:58:05] I'm going to pour my wrath out upon his
[1:58:07] kingdom after My bride is left there
[1:58:10] will be no more delay we're living in a
[1:58:11] time you say well it's been 50 years
[1:58:13] since the prophet's been here that's a
[1:58:15] short space of time for God and world
[1:58:17] events have changed very rapidly in the
[1:58:20] last 50 years even the last 10 years God
[1:58:23] is winding up his program I mean where
[1:58:25] once people who take years for maturity
[1:58:28] to come the former and the latter reign
[1:58:29] of falling and there's a quickening
[1:58:32] going out upon the Earth all over the
[1:58:34] world the spirit is moving amen all over
[1:58:36] the world as the prophet said it would
[1:58:38] be and people being quickened to be made
[1:58:40] Alive by the word and so it's not just
[1:58:43] it's not people just professing but they
[1:58:45] possess the promise I trust that you can
[1:58:47] say you're one of them amen hallelujah
[1:58:49] and also it says in Hebrews speaking of
[1:58:51] Abraham
[1:58:52] when there is a you know when when there
[1:58:55] is an oath you know he he swears he'll
[1:58:57] do something they you cease from all
[1:59:01] Strife so when you recognize he's going
[1:59:03] to do it he promised he'll do it to you
[1:59:07] amen all all Strife is gone am amen you
[1:59:10] can have confidence hallelujah amen amen
[1:59:14] not Pie in the
[1:59:15] Sky amen and the angel which
[1:59:19] I sorry verse 10 but in the days of the
[1:59:21] voice of the seventh Ang when he should
[1:59:22] begin to sound the mystery of God should
[1:59:24] be finished as he has declared it to his
[1:59:26] servants the prophets and the voice now
[1:59:28] this is our part of it right the
[1:59:30] prophet's gone that voice is sounded
[1:59:33] yeah amen and the voice which I heard
[1:59:35] from Heaven spake unto me again said go
[1:59:38] take the little book which is open in
[1:59:39] the hand of the Angel which standeth
[1:59:41] upon the sea and upon the Earth and eat
[1:59:43] it up and it shall make thy belly bitter
[1:59:45] but it shall be in thy mouth sweet as
[1:59:47] honey and I took the little book out of
[1:59:49] the Angel's hand and ate it up and it
[1:59:51] was in my mouth sweet as honey and as
[1:59:53] soon as I was eaten it my belly was
[1:59:55] bitter and he said unto me thou must
[1:59:58] prophesy again before many peoples and
[2:00:00] Nations and tongues and Kings we
[2:00:02] understand John physically did not
[2:00:05] prophesy before many people's Nations
[2:00:07] tongues and Kings after the a of Patmos
[2:00:09] he went to Ephesus and pastored the
[2:00:11] church there amen so this is actually
[2:00:13] speaking of a people remember John one
[2:00:15] man in a vision as a symbol of a whole
[2:00:17] people upon the earth now so here is a
[2:00:20] people that have received a cover with
[2:00:22] God Amen theyve received a word and they
[2:00:25] become one with that word amen so you
[2:00:28] don't see a you could say a book a
[2:00:29] covenant anymore but they embody what is
[2:00:31] in the what is in the document so if the
[2:00:34] Document Speaks of a body change they
[2:00:36] will they will embody it if if the
[2:00:38] Document Speaks of healing they will
[2:00:40] have healing if it speaks of Prophecy
[2:00:42] and tongues interpretation of tongues
[2:00:44] they will embody that me of whole people
[2:00:46] amen if there's victory over the enemy
[2:00:48] they will manifest that if there's peace
[2:00:50] that passes all understanding they will
[2:00:52] have peace and pass all understanding if
[2:00:54] it's joy joy unspeakable full of Glory
[2:00:56] they will have joy unspeakable full of
[2:00:58] glory amen they will actually live out
[2:01:01] what is in the contents of the document
[2:01:03] you know it's like America they signed a
[2:01:06] a proclamation of
[2:01:08] independence and they said we're a free
[2:01:10] nation under God but they had to fight a
[2:01:13] very hard War to enforce or to live out
[2:01:17] the contents of their declaration Amen
[2:01:20] to actually enjoy what what was in the
[2:01:23] document they had to fight and it's the
[2:01:25] same thing with us it's the same thing
[2:01:27] in this country even see the colonies
[2:01:29] won their independence but then when the
[2:01:32] Treaty of white Tangi was was was signed
[2:01:34] in this country it started a war and
[2:01:36] because if you go read into the history
[2:01:38] no one really
[2:01:39] won and so the disputes have come down
[2:01:42] generation to generation into this day
[2:01:44] because there's still a dispute over
[2:01:46] over what happened nearly 20 about 150
[2:01:50] years ago amen M but now the colonies
[2:01:54] they won their independence so what was
[2:01:57] written down and signed they lived it
[2:01:58] out now we have received a declaration
[2:02:01] of independence amen we have received
[2:02:04] the power to have dominion over Satan
[2:02:07] hey following me because the bride is an
[2:02:09] independent woman the prophet says I
[2:02:11] mean we're not subject to this world
[2:02:13] we're not subject to Rome or any any
[2:02:15] kind of religion we're independent
[2:02:18] Hallelujah so when the open when the
[2:02:20] word became open God was declaring now
[2:02:22] this is war Satan there a revolution
[2:02:25] amen amen it has been fighting
[2:02:27] skirmishes have been fighting down
[2:02:28] through seven Church ages but now is the
[2:02:30] hour my people shall arise Hallelujah
[2:02:34] and so you have to fight you with me you
[2:02:36] have to fight to enforce the contents of
[2:02:38] the document amen that if there's
[2:02:40] bitterness in your heart you got to get
[2:02:42] rid of it if there's unforgiveness you
[2:02:44] got to get rid of it amen if there's
[2:02:46] Strife or whatever it is you got to get
[2:02:47] rid of if there's lust am mean so you
[2:02:49] know any unforgiveness anger whatever it
[2:02:51] may be you have to fight to get rid of
[2:02:53] it amen because it is a struggle it's a
[2:02:56] war for you to fully surrender amen
[2:02:58] hallelujah amen amen we must fight but
[2:03:01] there's not also just that now but we
[2:03:04] have a responsibility to Proclaim what
[2:03:06] is in the document amen that all men
[2:03:09] women children that want to go free can
[2:03:11] go free yes amen that is our job in this
[2:03:14] last days is to prophesy again so to
[2:03:17] receive take the word that we have
[2:03:19] received and to speak it forth upon the
[2:03:21] Earth amen that everyone else can look
[2:03:23] and live you say well I'm not a preacher
[2:03:26] your life is a sermon you have I think
[2:03:29] we sometimes very much uh not even think
[2:03:32] about people read your life every day
[2:03:36] and they notice how you are they notice
[2:03:38] how you conduct themsel your conduct
[2:03:40] yourself and they are watching you yeah
[2:03:43] you say well that puts me under a lot of
[2:03:44] pressure I'll just say this Naomi was
[2:03:47] living a sermon in Moab amen amen thank
[2:03:51] you Lord and if you thought and if you
[2:03:52] think about it she was not a Victorious
[2:03:54] believer she's backslid out of the
[2:03:57] Homeland her son's marry
[2:03:59] unbelievers amen and then her her her
[2:04:02] husband and her sons die now here she is
[2:04:05] but her life has been living a sermon
[2:04:07] because when she says now I'm going to
[2:04:09] return back what was what was Ruth's
[2:04:11] testimony your God will be my God your
[2:04:13] people will be my people you die I'll
[2:04:15] die Hallelujah that was the effect of
[2:04:17] her life amen upon a woman that had to
[2:04:20] come in yes amen so it's the same thing
[2:04:22] with us you have no idea we have no idea
[2:04:24] the effect that we have on people
[2:04:26] hallelujah so I put yourself under it
[2:04:28] well I have to always be perfect
[2:04:29] everything we find we have a
[2:04:31] supernatural
[2:04:32] gospel amen and it will Quicken those
[2:04:35] who need to be quickened amen and it
[2:04:38] will find them in spite of human see God
[2:04:40] has tied we must you must prophesy again
[2:04:43] God has tied his Plan of Redemption with
[2:04:46] you amen amen that you are actually part
[2:04:50] of his plan to find his last yes amen
[2:04:53] amen so now if that is if that is our
[2:04:56] commission I say let's go live it out
[2:04:58] yes remember we have this is not a
[2:05:01] religion that's right this is not
[2:05:03] psychology amen this is not seven steps
[2:05:05] to a Rapture amen this is not seven
[2:05:08] steps to a Victorious walk this is a
[2:05:10] reality where God comes on the scene
[2:05:13] changes people's
[2:05:15] lives i' I've seen bitterness go I've
[2:05:19] seen unforgiveness go I've seen tempest
[2:05:21] Go
[2:05:22] I've seen lust go I've seen indifference
[2:05:24] go amen I've seen I've seen hurts pains
[2:05:28] complexes go remember the anointing it
[2:05:31] says I'll set at Liberty them that are
[2:05:32] Bru I'll bind up their Spirit of Lord is
[2:05:35] upon me to bind up the Brokenhearted and
[2:05:37] to set at Liberty them that are bruised
[2:05:39] amen so the anointing has actually come
[2:05:42] you know a broken heart is actually it
[2:05:43] says in the Bible it's like a pot that's
[2:05:44] been
[2:05:45] shattered he says the anointing is upon
[2:05:48] me to take up the pieces amen place them
[2:05:50] back together and the beautiful thing
[2:05:52] about God is you don't see the cracks
[2:05:54] Hallelujah that becomes restored I will
[2:05:56] restore not I will patch up I will
[2:05:58] restore amen and them that are bruised
[2:06:01] we can be bruised by things amen even
[2:06:03] among Believers things can bruise us
[2:06:06] amen but there's a healing power present
[2:06:09] that can set at Liberty them that are
[2:06:11] bruised just because someone's bruised
[2:06:13] it doesn't mean they're not a Believer
[2:06:15] doesn't mean they make believer
[2:06:16] unbeliever it be genuine believer am
[2:06:19] mean but a bruise in the spirit can bind
[2:06:22] people I say friends you don't carry
[2:06:24] those things that's right amen don't sit
[2:06:26] in the waiting room and say oh I'm here
[2:06:28] I am waiting that's right the phys The
[2:06:31] Physician is here and this is the power
[2:06:33] I I'm fully persuaded amen there is
[2:06:36] nothing God cannot heal there's nothing
[2:06:38] God cannot restore we can maybe years
[2:06:41] and years in a slump God can take that
[2:06:43] away amen when we stop looking at
[2:06:46] ourselves he said I can't live this you

[2:07:59] because he knows it was him Hallelujah
[2:08:02] and it's the same thing with us friends

[2:08:06] and Daughters of God is not you being

[2:08:38] season and and and I'll try and close
[2:08:40] with
[2:08:41] this we had gone into a different season
[2:08:44] around the world where God is mending
[2:08:46] healing and
[2:08:48] restoring right because he wants his
[2:08:50] sons and daughters is to be victorious
[2:08:53] remember we are not to be slaves of our
[2:08:55] past those that came out of Egypt Joshua
[2:08:57] and Caleb maybe they received more
[2:08:59] stripes and the rest of them they would
[2:09:01] have no doubt had the scars on their
[2:09:02] backs but they stood there said we're
[2:09:04] more than able to take it let's go and
[2:09:07] take it Hallelujah because they pass to
[2:09:09] being obliterate in their mind cuz they
[2:09:11] saw a God come down mean they saw him
[2:09:13] come down and say I'll give you the land
[2:09:15] hallelujah hallelujah amen no doubt they
[2:09:18] can feel we can feel the scars of the
[2:09:19] past but you got to look the scaring
[2:09:23] look beyond the one who's delivered you
[2:09:24] look be on the one that's calling you
[2:09:26] look to
[2:09:27] him that's what we've got to do
[2:09:30] Hallelujah forget about well you say
[2:09:32] I've done a lot of bad things let's go
[2:09:34] to let's go to John 8 I'm just going to
[2:09:36] read this and we'll
[2:09:37] close John 8
[2:09:43] And1
[2:09:44] Hallelujah we have a god of
[2:09:47] Liberty Hallelujah God of joy and peace
[2:09:50] amen you say well should I look for an
[2:09:51] emotion no just Look to Him amen
[2:09:55] amen John 8:1 I was going to open with
[2:09:58] this but I felt no may I just close with
[2:09:59] it
[2:10:00] instead Jesus went unto the Mount of
[2:10:04] Olives
[2:10:05] wait yes and early in the morning he
[2:10:09] came out again into the temple and all
[2:10:11] the people came unto him and sat down
[2:10:13] and he taught them and the scribes and
[2:10:15] Pharisees now notice this here's the
[2:10:18] Phantom of all of eternal life
[2:10:22] standing there in
[2:10:24] flesh and look what these people come
[2:10:26] and the scribes and Pharisees brought
[2:10:28] unto him a woman taken in adultery when
[2:10:31] they had set her and they had set her in
[2:10:33] the
[2:10:34] midst and they said unto him Master this
[2:10:37] woman was taken in adultery the very act
[2:10:40] now Moses and the law commanded us that
[2:10:42] we should be stoned I mean that yeah
[2:10:44] they should be Stone too that thou that
[2:10:46] such should be stoned but what sayth
[2:10:48] thou this they said tempting him that
[2:10:51] they might have to accuse him but Jesus
[2:10:53] stooped down with his finger rode on the
[2:10:55] ground as though he heard them not so
[2:10:58] when they continued asking him he lifted
[2:11:00] up himself and said unto them he that is
[2:11:03] without sin among you let him first cast
[2:11:07] a stone at her now this is you this
[2:11:11] you're this woman you're this woman yeah
[2:11:15] yeah amen God is here amen Satan is here
[2:11:18] he's the accuser of your brethren and he
[2:11:21] will bring up your past right but you
[2:11:24] got to understand this this whole
[2:11:25] passage like we haven't finished reading
[2:11:27] it sorry brother but we this whole
[2:11:29] passage of scripture is actually it
[2:11:31] doesn't condemn her it condemns them
[2:11:35] right amen so now and again he stooped
[2:11:38] down and rote on the ground no doubt he
[2:11:40] was probably writing out their book of
[2:11:42] life and everything they did and when
[2:11:44] they and they which heard it being
[2:11:45] convicted in their own conscience went
[2:11:47] out one by one beginning at the eldest
[2:11:49] even at the last and Jesus was was left
[2:11:51] alone and the woman standing in the
[2:11:54] midst he didn't write anything she
[2:11:56] did right when Jesus had lifted up
[2:11:59] himself and saw no one but the woman he
[2:12:01] said unto Heroman where are those thine
[2:12:05] accusers hath no man condemn thee now
[2:12:08] notice her
[2:12:09] response she said no man Lord that's
[2:12:12] supreme authority no man
[2:12:14] God and Jesus said unto her neither do I
[2:12:17] condemn thee go and sin no more amen
[2:12:21] here we are we come to the presence of
[2:12:23] the son of man Jesus Christ himself
[2:12:26] right and the enemy wants to bring up
[2:12:29] everything we did hey we were living an
[2:12:31] adulterous life whether you like it or
[2:12:33] not amen cuz we were married because our
[2:12:36] first Union married us to basically
[2:12:39] Satan our fallen nature and then we
[2:12:41] tried but that had to be done away with
[2:12:44] for us to be married to another but then
[2:12:46] in order for that to happen now one had
[2:12:48] to come and obliterate our part amen
[2:12:52] amen amen because if he did not come we
[2:12:55] could not we could not walk in Liberty
[2:12:59] right so now here's a supreme judge
[2:13:01] writing in the
[2:13:03] sand and he is writing out their lives
[2:13:07] he doesn't write out her life because
[2:13:09] that whole trial right there is actually
[2:13:11] to vindicate or Justify
[2:13:14] her right so now here we are upon the
[2:13:19] Earth Satan wants want to bring up your
[2:13:21] past and everything you did and he
[2:13:24] actually likes he wants you to be in the
[2:13:25] presence of God that you'll feel

[2:22:46] thinking but we didn't really get a
[2:22:48] chance to thank him amen amen amen and I
[2:22:51] thought maybe we could uh have him up
[2:22:53] and we'll all pray for him but then the
[2:22:55] the brothers will come up and the
[2:22:56] sisters won't get a chance to pray you
[2:22:58] know so then I thought maybe we can all
[2:23:00] pray together but it's hard to listen to
[2:23:03] more than one conversation at once and I
[2:23:05] find it a bit too
[2:23:06] intense so then I thought no we'll just
[2:23:08] manipulate a song slightly so we can all
[2:23:11] just sing it and thank brother Ben amen
[2:23:14] now if you like this song which I really
[2:23:17] do brother Ben has forever commandeered
[2:23:19] the song now CU it will never be the
[2:23:21] same for you ever again every time you
[2:23:23] hear it you'll think of this but that's
[2:23:26] good because brother Ben's a blessing
[2:23:28] enough to commere the song so bring
