[7:49] God bless you everyone welcome here this
[7:52] evening it's a great privilege to see
[7:55] all of your smiling faces here just
[7:57] before we get started and before the
[8:00] power of God
[8:01] moves upon this place in a powerful way
[8:04] we just have to run through a few
[8:05] formalities so this is one of the cap
[8:08] facilitators and she is going to take us
[8:09] through a few things about the camp so
[8:11] I'm going to give you that and I'll hand
[8:13] it over to you yeah I get the pleasure
[8:16] of all the boring stuff
[8:17] um just fire stuff in here
[8:21] um if there is an evacuation at camp and
[8:23] hopefully there won't be we had one two
[8:25] weeks ago so hopefully that was our
[8:27] first one in 50. hopefully it's another
[8:28] 50 before we get the next one but out on
[8:31] the field is where you go if you need to
[8:33] evacuate because of a fire or any other
[8:36] thing that you need to evacuate for
[8:39] um just be aware of the fact that the
[8:41] lake is not a great place for swimming
[8:44] so if you want to swim it's the swimming
[8:46] pool um
[8:48] yes I've noticed everyone's been really
[8:52] you guys that have been on Colleen for
[8:54] following that rule the tire swing is
[8:56] four people if you are needing to use
[8:59] the laundry while you're here at the
[9:01] weekend and there is an ironing board
[9:03] and iron and the laundry it's next to
[9:05] the A-frame building kind of opposite
[9:07] the tire swing in the playground
[9:10] um one of the washing machines works
[9:12] with a two dollar coin the other one
[9:13] you'll need to find me in the office to
[9:15] get a little token that will work it
[9:18] that's the one that's in the corner and
[9:19] also the dryer needs a token
[9:22] um
[9:23] [Music]
[9:24] um
[9:27] what else oh
[9:30] that one
[9:32] um
[9:33] [Music]
[9:34] it's still feeding back
[9:37] um most that around if you're in The
[9:39] Roundhouse building upstairs is actually
[9:42] really only a fire escape it's not
[9:45] um something that you want to race
[9:46] around if people open their Windows they
[9:48] become a danger and people can hurt
[9:49] themselves on them so there's something
[9:51] there and be aware of where the fire
[9:54] exits are when you're in the buildings
[9:56] and here there are some behind the
[9:59] curtains here which someone will flick
[10:01] open if you needed to get out and over
[10:03] there when you're in the dining room
[10:05] there are three different exits that you
[10:08] can use there and if you've got any
[10:10] hassles over the weekend just um find
[10:12] bean and he can get a hold of me or I do
[10:15] have the camp phone number and there is
[10:18] um on the sign outside the office
[10:19] there's a number there but yeah the
[10:22] basic things you need to know is just
[10:23] where to go in an emergency
[10:25] um your kids will all know what to do on
[10:27] an earthquake
[10:29] what are you going to do
[10:31] drop cover hold
[10:33] um
[10:34] not not initially maybe it depends where
[10:37] you are you want to um stay away from
[10:39] glass and so if you can be near a wall
[10:42] um and then unfortunately with those
[10:44] things they just make it up as you go
[10:46] along but we'll be around if anything
[10:47] like that happens
[10:49] um we've never had anything fall down
[10:50] yet so that's pretty cool
[10:54] um yeah and you've got any questions
[10:56] just contact one of the organizers and
[10:58] they can contact me

[21:55] it's so good to be
[21:57] here this evening
[21:59] you can um you can stand let's let's
[22:01] kind of get let's get warmed up
[22:04] I had on my heart
[22:07] to bless you
[22:09] from the Lord
[22:11] because I believe we serve a good God
[22:14] we serve a god of love we serve a God
[22:18] that doesn't have any
[22:19] ill feeling or animosity in his heart at
[22:23] all towards us
[22:25] at all it's all just love and it's all
[22:28] to build us up to enrich us that's the
[22:31] god that we're approaching
[22:33] and that is here amongst us this evening
[22:37] and there's going to be a great
[22:38] atmosphere of love and an outpouring of
[22:41] the Holy Ghost
[22:42] upon every service
[22:44] when we're fellowshipping outside when
[22:46] we're in here when we're out in the in
[22:49] the hall in the park anywhere we are the
[22:51] Holy Ghost is going to move in a
[22:52] powerful way in these services
[22:55] and God wants to bless us abundantly
[22:58] and
[22:59] we believe that we are Sons and
[23:01] Daughters of God and I believe that I'm
[23:03] speaking and looking at Sons and
[23:05] Daughters of God
[23:07] this evening that's who you all are and
[23:10] if anything tells you otherwise it's a
[23:12] lie it's not true you're all Sons and
[23:14] Daughters of God and it's by the Divine
[23:17] Purpose of almighty God that you're here
[23:18] this evening it's not by an accident but
[23:21] God wants to bless each and every one of
[23:23] you in a powerful way you're going to
[23:25] leave this place changed anything you
[23:28] need of you're going to receive
[23:30] at these meetings and
[23:32] and I want to say this we believe that
[23:34] we are Sons and Daughters of God
[23:35] sometimes when we speak we speak as a as
[23:38] a man or a woman whatever we we are and
[23:41] yet other times we speak we speak as if
[23:43] it's the Oracles of God as if we're
[23:45] actually the mouthpiece of God you know
[23:47] Jesus when he was here he is at one
[23:49] point he whipped he whipped like a man
[23:52] but then when he said Lazarus come forth
[23:54] that was God speaking
[23:56] and if you if I could be so bold as to
[23:58] speak a blessing upon you this evening
[24:00] and it comes from Ephesians but I'm
[24:02] going to paraphrase it like it's like
[24:04] the Lord speaking to you because it's
[24:06] all for us
[24:07] when Paul says I would desire that God
[24:09] would do this for you it's like God's
[24:11] saying I want to do this to you
[24:13] so this is Ephesians 3 17.
[24:16] to 20 and it says I this is a rainbow
[24:18] receives this from the Lord to you I
[24:21] dwell in your hearts by faith
[24:24] and you will be rooted and grounded in
[24:27] love
[24:29] and you will be able to comprehend with
[24:32] All Saints what is the breadth and
[24:36] length and depth and height
[24:40] and you will know my love
[24:43] which passes knowledge
[24:46] and you will be filled with all the
[24:49] fullness of God
[24:52] because I am able to do exceeding
[24:56] abundantly above all that you ask or
[25:01] think
[25:02] according to my power that works in you
[25:07] and you will say I receive it
[25:10] praise the Lord
[25:12] turn around and greet your brethren say
[25:13] hello and let's praise the Lord this

[1:10:51] work together for good for them that
[1:10:52] love God to them that are called
[1:10:54] according to his purpose for whom he did
[1:10:56] for no he did also he also did
[1:10:58] predestinate to be conformed to the
[1:11:00] image of his son that he might be the
[1:11:02] firstborn among many brethren moreover
[1:11:04] whom he did predestinate them he also
[1:11:07] called and whom he called he also
[1:11:09] Justified and whom he justified them he
[1:11:12] also glorified amen you said it we
[1:11:16] believe it that is done and you're gonna
[1:11:18] believe he's already done it for you

[1:11:34] against me what complex what pain what
[1:11:39] Spirit what indecisiveness whatever it
[1:11:42] may be what can be against you if God be
[1:11:45] for you
[1:11:46] Hallelujah

[1:11:50] tongue's interpretation in our first
[1:11:51] ever prayer meeting as a church this is
[1:11:53] over 10 years ago and the Lord said if
[1:11:55] you remain humble my word will continue
[1:11:57] to go forth from this place in my and
[1:11:59] I'll bring my people and they'll find
[1:12:00] rest and that rest is the true baptism
[1:12:03] of the Holy Ghost and I believe this is
[1:12:05] why we have these kind of meetings that
[1:12:08] if you need rest for your soul
[1:12:11] you can find it here in his presence
[1:12:14] Hallelujah whatever you have need of

[1:16:48] trust you've come expecting to hear and
[1:16:51] you just pull through the vessel
[1:16:52] amen God knows how to speak he can use a
[1:16:55] donkey to speak he can surely use
[1:16:56] someone like me amen but it's our
[1:16:59] expectations amen our attitude amen do
[1:17:01] you believe the Lord Jesus Christ is
[1:17:02] here in our midst and why do you believe
[1:17:04] that because he said so whoever two or
[1:17:06] three are gathered Amen in his name
[1:17:09] there I am and their midst and he is
[1:17:12] here tonight I feel his presence here
[1:17:14] tonight I just so excited for what the
[1:17:16] Lord's going to do for us this weekend
[1:17:17] amen amen praise the Lord thank you
[1:17:20] musicians
[1:17:21] we're gonna go right into the word
[1:17:22] tonight
[1:17:23] uh speak on a little subject this
[1:17:26] evening of Breakout
[1:17:29] you know last time I was here uh we were
[1:17:31] just
[1:17:32] coming right into that covet season and
[1:17:35] it was quite a an interesting time a
[1:17:37] time that we have not seen before there
[1:17:40] was no manuals written for a time like
[1:17:42] that you know for for us as Believers we
[1:17:45] have not seen those things before and
[1:17:46] and yet all of a sudden you know
[1:17:48] somebody turned to switch and we had to
[1:17:50] isolate and we had to not gather any
[1:17:52] more in our churches so we see how
[1:17:53] quickly things can change you know
[1:17:55] overnight the whole world can be subdued
[1:17:58] by something and how God would allow
[1:18:00] those things and and I believe God has
[1:18:02] Has Lifted those restrictions for us so
[1:18:04] that we can gather like this again so
[1:18:06] you know we don't know if God's lifted
[1:18:08] them for just a season amen so that we
[1:18:11] can can come and gather and we can just
[1:18:13] finish do the fine final touches amen
[1:18:15] just a little finishing touches maybe
[1:18:17] there's a soul here that will be saved
[1:18:19] tonight we don't know but God's allowed
[1:18:21] us to gather like this to have the
[1:18:22] preaching of the word go forth for you
[1:18:24] to sit there and sit under the preaching
[1:18:26] of the word so you know we just want to
[1:18:28] say God whatever you want to do tonight
[1:18:29] amen have your way with us this evening
[1:18:31] and and so we just know it was a very
[1:18:34] surreal time every flight we took out of
[1:18:36] here was the last flight the flight we
[1:18:38] took out of New Zealand it was the last
[1:18:40] flight out of New Zealand you know so um
[1:18:43] it's just a real a privilege and a
[1:18:45] miracle if you think about it to be back
[1:18:46] here standing here preaching in New
[1:18:48] Zealand again and I know we've gone
[1:18:50] through a very interesting time a very
[1:18:52] dark time for a lot of people and
[1:18:55] Believers don't like to be isolated and
[1:18:57] separated we like Fellowship there's
[1:18:59] strength and fellowship amen as we feel
[1:19:02] here tonight so so we're happy that we
[1:19:04] can have this time together I was told
[1:19:06] this is a Labor Day weekend so I'm not
[1:19:08] sure that if we're allowed to work like
[1:19:09] this brother Ben you know but here we
[1:19:12] are but we're just laboring for the Lord
[1:19:13] tonight and you know I felt just right
[1:19:15] at home I had to give myself a pinch
[1:19:17] when our brother was praying in that uh
[1:19:19] in that Heavenly language
[1:19:21] amen God bless you brother you sure made
[1:19:24] me feel at home tonight and your brother
[1:19:26] praying in Africans it was not tongues
[1:19:28] it was it was every language of his own
[1:19:31] kind amen so amen we're going to turn in
[1:19:34] our Bibles to the book of Hebrews
[1:19:35] chapter 12. we just say hello from
[1:19:37] Canada yeah a little church there in in
[1:19:40] Alda Grove Living Word Fellowship we
[1:19:41] greet you they wanted to be sure that we
[1:19:43] extend our greetings to you
[1:19:45] just an extension of the family of God
[1:19:48] amen amen Hebrews chapter 12 and verse
[1:19:51] 1. and so this evening I want to speak
[1:19:53] on the subject of a breakout uh you know
[1:19:56] we have we have come to a place my
[1:19:58] brother and sister where we come to the
[1:20:00] very end of our dispensation the Gentile
[1:20:02] dispensation we're we're the last
[1:20:04] generation we're the last group of
[1:20:06] people you know we're making our way out
[1:20:08] of here there's a great Exodus coming up
[1:20:11] amen and uh one of these days we'll wake
[1:20:14] up and everything will change it'll be a
[1:20:16] different feeling in the air you know
[1:20:18] we'll just step from this Dimension into
[1:20:19] another dimension our bodies will be
[1:20:21] changed and so we we recognize that we
[1:20:24] just have you know maybe a week left or
[1:20:26] maybe we have a month left or maybe we
[1:20:28] have a year left that we don't know but
[1:20:31] we realize that we are still here for a
[1:20:33] reason and so we want to just focus on
[1:20:36] our on our own lives tonight and this
[1:20:38] evening I want to just encourage you in
[1:20:40] the word and if we can just look at our
[1:20:41] own lives and and say Lord what is it
[1:20:43] left that I need to be doing in my life
[1:20:45] Lord Lord I don't want to get caught up
[1:20:47] in an idea or some you know we get we
[1:20:50] can get caught up in church cultures and
[1:20:52] things you know we get caught up in
[1:20:54] family cultures or or pick up the spirit
[1:20:56] of our nation you know we can get caught
[1:20:58] up in all kinds of things or Instagram
[1:20:59] or being influenced by all these things
[1:21:02] but you know we're Eagles and we want to
[1:21:04] break out a little bit tonight and then
[1:21:06] we want to break into higher places and
[1:21:08] to do that we have to be able to
[1:21:10] recognize the condition that we're in
[1:21:12] amen that is that is so very important
[1:21:15] that you as an individual I as an
[1:21:17] individual I can look at myself and
[1:21:19] stand in the mirror of God's word and
[1:21:21] recognize the condition that I'm in amen
[1:21:24] and tonight I just want to be humble I
[1:21:26] want to say Lord if there's something in
[1:21:28] your word that doesn't please you know
[1:21:30] if there's something in my life that
[1:21:31] doesn't please you that doesn't reflect
[1:21:33] this word a hundred percent Lord help me
[1:21:35] tonight amen because I want I want to
[1:21:37] get out amen I want a body change so
[1:21:39] that's what really the thought is for
[1:21:41] this breakout tonight Hebrews 12 and 1.
[1:21:45] very well known scripture is very much
[1:21:47] for our time when we read these words
[1:21:49] here is literally penned for you and I
[1:21:53] it says wherefore seeing we are also
[1:21:55] compassed about with so great a cloud of
[1:21:57] witnesses let us lay aside every weight
[1:22:00] and the sin which does so easily beset
[1:22:03] us and led us with patience run the race
[1:22:07] amen that is set before us verse two
[1:22:09] looking unto Jesus the author and
[1:22:11] finisher of our faith who for the joy
[1:22:13] that was set before him endured the
[1:22:15] cross despising the shame and is set
[1:22:17] down at the right hand of the Throne of
[1:22:19] God Amen let's just bow our heads one
[1:22:21] more time and if you have just a need on
[1:22:23] your heart this evening just let it be
[1:22:25] known with an uplifted hand God sees
[1:22:27] every hand he sees beyond that hand he
[1:22:30] sees right to the heart of the matter
[1:22:32] tonight so just lift it with faith
[1:22:33] tonight and say Lord I have a need if
[1:22:35] you would speak to me through this
[1:22:37] weekend Lord I'm believing that you are
[1:22:39] here I recognize that you can answer
[1:22:40] that need our precious Heavenly Father
[1:22:42] Lord we just humble ourselves before you
[1:22:45] as we bow our heads to the dust of the
[1:22:47] Earth from Once We Come O Lord we know
[1:22:49] and recognize that you're our maker
[1:22:51] you're the author and finish of our
[1:22:53] faith oh God you raise us up for such a
[1:22:56] time as this Lord and so Lord we Look to
[1:22:59] You Lord we want to just sit us a little
[1:23:01] while around your table tonight Lord and
[1:23:03] have you break bread with us Lord as as
[1:23:05] Esther had those men come Lord and and
[1:23:08] and tell her exactly how the king liked
[1:23:10] it Lord and and his his likes and
[1:23:13] dislikes of Father we want to be dressed
[1:23:15] in your righteousness tonight so Lord we
[1:23:17] humble ourselves before you Lord that he
[1:23:19] would speak to us Lord your word would
[1:23:21] have an effect Upon Our Lives Lord Lord
[1:23:23] and you Penn down these words Lord
[1:23:25] because he knew there would be a people
[1:23:27] at the very end of the Gentile
[1:23:29] dispensation in the darkest time oh God
[1:23:32] Lord but yet a light Lord in our hearts
[1:23:35] oh Father and and we read these words
[1:23:38] and know that you had an uh a purpose in
[1:23:41] having them pen down Lord that there's a
[1:23:43] great cloud of witnesses oh Lord that we
[1:23:45] are running a race Lord that we are to
[1:23:47] set aside these things Lord that hinder
[1:23:50] us father tonight we ask that the the
[1:23:51] one Lord that panda those words Lord
[1:23:54] would Inspire us tonight Lord let those
[1:23:56] words have an effect Upon Us Lord let
[1:23:58] your Holy Spirit make these words live
[1:24:00] in our lives tonight in Jesus Christ's
[1:24:02] name we pray amen amen you may have your
[1:24:05] seats
[1:24:07] we we have seen many times as they would
[1:24:10] you know run races and and do relays and
[1:24:13] things like that you know you don't see
[1:24:15] the the runners preparing at the
[1:24:17] starting lines you know with backpacks
[1:24:19] and and you know loading up themselves
[1:24:21] and you know they're gonna you know they
[1:24:22] got their hiking boots on and you know
[1:24:24] they got all this gear on though that's
[1:24:26] not what race Runners do right no race
[1:24:28] Runners they shed as much as they can
[1:24:30] shed you know even the food that they
[1:24:32] eat they eat very specific food because
[1:24:34] because they know that they don't want
[1:24:36] any excess weight amen they want they
[1:24:39] want to have just exactly what they have
[1:24:41] need of for the race and and so we see
[1:24:43] how that Paul was admonishing the church
[1:24:45] let us lay aside every weight in other
[1:24:47] words he was recognizing that there was
[1:24:49] there were certain weights being
[1:24:50] attached to our lives and my brother and
[1:24:53] sister this these can be you know
[1:24:54] anything from emotional things to
[1:24:56] complexes you know you can see somebody
[1:24:58] who comes to church and they're joyful
[1:25:00] they're excited you know and they're
[1:25:02] happy to sing praises and then as the
[1:25:04] time goes by you see that they're not as
[1:25:05] happy as they used to be and you know
[1:25:07] what's happened is that a bomb went off
[1:25:09] in their lives a spiritual you know
[1:25:11] disaster something happened or maybe
[1:25:13] they were disappointed in someone or
[1:25:15] something or you know maybe they didn't
[1:25:16] have their hands Shake but you know
[1:25:18] something happened and in their mind it
[1:25:20] was a great thing and and so it affects
[1:25:23] the way that they live and that becomes
[1:25:24] a weight
[1:25:25] to their worship it becomes a way to
[1:25:28] their walk with the Lord and you know
[1:25:30] they're not growing as they used to grow
[1:25:31] and you know the devil is very good at
[1:25:33] these things I want to tell you tonight
[1:25:35] the devil is very subtle these very Sly
[1:25:38] he's very smart this is his this is his
[1:25:40] craft he knows how to add little weights
[1:25:43] on and you know sometimes you don't even
[1:25:44] realize that he is hanging little
[1:25:47] weights onto you you know it's like we
[1:25:49] were fishing out on the Fraser River and
[1:25:51] and we just throw these lines out you
[1:25:52] know we don't even have to put a lure on
[1:25:54] the end of that line you just put a hook
[1:25:55] out there and that and then you put a
[1:25:57] weight on there and you just let it
[1:25:59] bounce along the riverbank like that you
[1:26:01] know because eventually those salmon are
[1:26:02] going to swim up River there because
[1:26:04] they they need to go up that river to
[1:26:05] spawn and so you know but they're gonna
[1:26:08] eventually get tangled up in these hooks
[1:26:10] you know so even that you know the devil
[1:26:12] knows sometimes you don't even need a
[1:26:14] lure you know you just throw a line out
[1:26:16] there because they're gonna pass by this
[1:26:17] way and you know sometimes we pass by
[1:26:19] somewhere and we hear music or we hear
[1:26:21] this thing or or that thing and before
[1:26:23] you know it we're falling into that trap
[1:26:25] again and you know and if we're not
[1:26:26] careful you know we'll find ourselves in
[1:26:28] a place where we're beating ourselves up
[1:26:30] and saying I'm not worthy and you know
[1:26:32] and and so forth but my brother and
[1:26:34] sister once you are saved by the blood
[1:26:36] of Jesus Christ once you're sealed into
[1:26:37] the kingdom amen with your seal until
[1:26:39] the day of your Redemption and we need
[1:26:42] to remind ourselves of that but yet we
[1:26:44] make mistakes yet we carry scars in our
[1:26:47] lives and yet we go through things in
[1:26:49] our life that hinder our walk with the
[1:26:51] Lord but I want to tell you tonight that
[1:26:53] God has made a way of Escape for us amen
[1:26:56] you haven't lost your salvation but what
[1:26:58] he has done is he's telling you that by
[1:27:00] his holy spirit he'll make he'll make a
[1:27:02] way for you amen you can stand up again
[1:27:04] I mean that's why that's why we're
[1:27:06] soldiers you know this is not a flowery
[1:27:08] bed of ease we're soldiers in a battle
[1:27:10] we are race Runners amen we're fighting
[1:27:13] something here right man God's given us
[1:27:15] the right tools and you know we expect
[1:27:16] to get a few scars along the way amen
[1:27:19] but it doesn't mean that we're defeated
[1:27:20] we get up again and we Face another day
[1:27:23] by the grace of God why because his
[1:27:25] mercies are new every morning
[1:27:28] oh my we can preach tonight amen
[1:27:30] hallelujah so to break out is that what
[1:27:33] I'm saying tonight is to break out we
[1:27:36] want to break out from our fears
[1:27:38] you know covert has brought a real cloud
[1:27:41] of fear you know everybody's watching
[1:27:43] someone if you notice that you know
[1:27:44] somebody had to cough over here you know
[1:27:47] whoa whoa hey you know it's instantly
[1:27:51] you know the devil has trained us right
[1:27:54] he he cultures us he trains us to see
[1:27:58] things a certain way and you know he
[1:28:00] might use Instagram so that he can train
[1:28:02] us to see things a certain way and you
[1:28:04] know it'll affect the way we are around
[1:28:06] one another and you know the way we we
[1:28:08] treat one another even you know maybe
[1:28:11] I'm not going to shake his hand today
[1:28:12] because I saw that you know you know I'm
[1:28:15] just being honest right but they they
[1:28:17] what are they doing they're training the
[1:28:19] way we think and if we're not careful
[1:28:21] this happens in our spiritual walk also
[1:28:23] things can happen in our lives that
[1:28:25] train us and it's before you know it you
[1:28:28] know you don't even want to go to a
[1:28:29] church anymore because of the things
[1:28:31] that have happened now let's see let's
[1:28:33] be honest huh amen but you know my
[1:28:35] brother and sister God is greater than
[1:28:37] all those things
[1:28:38] he's great in those things we have a
[1:28:40] right we have a righteous believer does
[1:28:43] the body of Christ to break out upon the
[1:28:45] promises of God break out upon our
[1:28:47] freedoms and break on upon the things
[1:28:49] that God has given to us amen amen we
[1:28:52] don't have to live under those things
[1:28:54] anymore
[1:28:56] so to break out is a violent and a
[1:28:58] forceful break from a restraining
[1:29:01] condition
[1:29:02] or situation this can be in your family
[1:29:05] you know maybe you grow up in an
[1:29:07] environment that that restrains you it
[1:29:10] just seems to suffocate you or hold you
[1:29:12] down
[1:29:14] you know in in military terms this is
[1:29:16] actually a a military military maneuver
[1:29:19] it means to escape you know a general
[1:29:22] might see that his army is going into a
[1:29:25] situation and and and they're gonna
[1:29:27] they're gonna walk right into a trap you
[1:29:29] know the Scouts have come back and said
[1:29:30] this is not a good situation you might
[1:29:32] think you you outnumber the enemy but
[1:29:34] I'm telling you we have seen more
[1:29:36] numbers and they're approaching and
[1:29:37] they're surrounded you and so that
[1:29:39] General will give a command and that
[1:29:41] command is is not like it's not a
[1:29:43] negative thing my brother and sister to
[1:29:44] break out it means to to force a way out
[1:29:47] of the situation it means to break left
[1:29:50] or break right or find a way out of the
[1:29:52] situation why because there's certain
[1:29:54] death if you keep going the way that
[1:29:56] you're going and see so it's to preserve
[1:29:58] life that he would give a command to
[1:30:00] break out
[1:30:01] oh my
[1:30:03] God it is to avoid capture in the
[1:30:05] interest of preserving life
[1:30:08] to redirect
[1:30:10] you know we could be going a certain way
[1:30:12] in our lives you know and and maybe you
[1:30:15] you know you start listening to certain
[1:30:16] music or watching certain movies and you
[1:30:19] know that starts there and then you then
[1:30:21] it starts to kind of get worse from
[1:30:22] there and and you know it just gets a
[1:30:24] little easier to do it the next time
[1:30:25] maybe it's smoking or drinking or
[1:30:27] whatever it may be you know you can fill
[1:30:29] in the blanks tonight but whatever those
[1:30:31] things are my brothers you find yourself
[1:30:33] going down a certain pathway and it but
[1:30:36] it might feel you know like you cannot
[1:30:38] get out of the situation you know
[1:30:40] because this flesh is so easily uh
[1:30:43] affected by those things it's so easily
[1:30:45] entertained you know it's you know
[1:30:47] because we get bored yeah yeah I know I
[1:30:49] know you know in its first world
[1:30:51] countries that we live in we get bored
[1:30:53] and we have idle idleness that sets in
[1:30:55] and you know those long rainy days you
[1:30:58] know we start to think you know and the
[1:31:00] mind starts to be idle and you start to
[1:31:02] go down a certain way of thinking and
[1:31:04] you know you start to read books or this
[1:31:06] or that and my grand sister before you
[1:31:08] know it you're wasting all your time
[1:31:09] away and you can find yourself on a down
[1:31:12] a certain uh path of Destruction you
[1:31:14] know like the prophet talks about
[1:31:15] marijuana can lead to from marijuana to
[1:31:18] cigarettes from cigarettes to hard drugs
[1:31:21] and he talks about all these things how
[1:31:22] the devil knows how to set the traps and
[1:31:24] before you know it you're in this trap
[1:31:26] and you don't know how to get out of it
[1:31:28] right because it's so tempting it it
[1:31:31] seems to just have a grip on you and you
[1:31:33] don't you feel ashamed to even maybe
[1:31:35] tell somebody and I want to tell you as
[1:31:37] a message believer we're not all perfect
[1:31:39] okay we just need to be honest with each
[1:31:41] other I mean we all need God in our
[1:31:43] lives amen it's Grace we need his love
[1:31:46] and we need to pray one for another
[1:31:47] don't ever think that you don't have a
[1:31:49] right to reach out to somebody and say
[1:31:51] hey I need help you know go to your
[1:31:53] pastor go to a deacon and say Hey listen
[1:31:54] I'm struggling with something you need
[1:31:56] to help me break out of here I'm not
[1:31:58] strong enough for this thing amen we we
[1:32:00] have each other for that reason
[1:32:04] so redirect
[1:32:06] amen fight back my brown sister I'll
[1:32:08] give you a scripture for that the Bible
[1:32:09] says resist the devil and he shall flee
[1:32:11] you have you have every right to fight
[1:32:14] against that thing you know I I have a
[1:32:17] right to be happy Satan I don't have to
[1:32:18] be under this this depression I don't
[1:32:21] have to be under this this feeling I
[1:32:23] don't have to be sick anymore amen I
[1:32:26] don't have to wait for those things I
[1:32:28] don't have to feel good I don't have to
[1:32:30] uh you know be dictated to about my
[1:32:32] emotions Satan I resist you the name of
[1:32:34] Jesus Christ
[1:32:36] amen you have a right
[1:32:40] you know this comes right out of the
[1:32:41] chapter of The Heroes of Faith
[1:32:44] and it focuses right down on us all eyes
[1:32:46] are on us there's a cloud of witnesses
[1:32:48] watching tonight the prophet says it
[1:32:51] like this that we are to break loose
[1:32:54] right from the message looking at the
[1:32:55] Unseen
[1:32:57] we are to break loose and lay aside
[1:32:59] every Fetter now
[1:33:02] so let us cast aside every unnecessary
[1:33:04] weight and the things that entangle us
[1:33:07] let us run a race looking away from all
[1:33:10] the distractions
[1:33:11] huh it's so easily distracted this day
[1:33:14] huh looking only unto Jesus Christ who
[1:33:18] brings our faith to a maturity and to a
[1:33:21] perfection
[1:33:23] amen so we are to realize tonight let's
[1:33:25] let's recognize what we're what we're
[1:33:27] dealing with
[1:33:28] we are to realize that we're in a battle
[1:33:31] this race that he's talking about it's a
[1:33:33] Warfare against the flesh it's a
[1:33:35] struggle between right and wrong it's
[1:33:38] life and death amen in Warfare people
[1:33:40] get weary and there are casualties and
[1:33:43] so the Bible encouraged us to do the
[1:33:45] following if we read down there in
[1:33:46] chapter 12 and verse 12 it says then
[1:33:48] wherefore lift up the hands which are
[1:33:51] hanging down and the feeble knees
[1:33:54] amen you know from the this is right
[1:33:57] after the chapter of the heroes of the
[1:33:59] faith and then it talks about us and
[1:34:01] we're running a race and laying aside
[1:34:03] all our Fetters and chains and and
[1:34:05] breaking loose from those things and
[1:34:07] then it says then go and lift up the
[1:34:09] hands amen
[1:34:11] lift up the hands which hang down and in
[1:34:13] the feeble knees and make straight paths
[1:34:17] for your feet lest that which is lame be
[1:34:19] turned out of the way but let it rather
[1:34:21] be healed it says follow peace with all
[1:34:24] men and Holiness without which no man
[1:34:26] shall see the Lord looking diligently
[1:34:28] lest any man fail in the grace of God
[1:34:30] lest any root of bitterness
[1:34:34] springing up may trouble you and thereby
[1:34:37] many be defiled oh my bitterness I want
[1:34:41] to encourage you tonight if you have a
[1:34:42] bad feeling or you have this off feeling
[1:34:44] and it's something you can't shake maybe
[1:34:46] somebody's wronged you or maybe it's
[1:34:48] something in your history whatever it
[1:34:49] may be tonight there's a root of
[1:34:51] bitterness you have a right to break
[1:34:53] free from that thing
[1:34:54] and the way we break free from that
[1:34:56] thing my brother and sister is you take
[1:34:58] that thing that's in your heart and you
[1:34:59] say Lord I'm not strong enough I don't
[1:35:01] want to carry this thing anymore it's
[1:35:03] hindering my walk with you Lord amen
[1:35:05] Lord I'm giving it to you tonight it's
[1:35:08] that simple just lay it on him cast your
[1:35:10] burdens upon Him amen because he cares
[1:35:13] for you amen he's stronger anyway amen
[1:35:16] so cast your burdens upon him tonight
[1:35:19] amen unless there be any fornicator he
[1:35:22] says or profane person as Esau
[1:35:25] as they saw who for one more soul of
[1:35:27] meat sold his Birthright for you know
[1:35:30] that afterward when he would have
[1:35:31] inherited the blessing he was rejected
[1:35:33] for he found no place of repentance
[1:35:35] though he sought it carefully with tears
[1:35:38] what a warning yeah huh what a warning
[1:35:41] what what made Esau give up his
[1:35:43] Birthright
[1:35:44] he was hungry
[1:35:46] you know that doesn't sound like a big
[1:35:47] deal tonight you know we've all been fed
[1:35:49] well today man brother Ben and Sister
[1:35:52] Christine are incredible hosts we are we
[1:35:54] are fed up
[1:35:56] hey man we have been well taken care of
[1:35:58] Amen so tonight we don't necessarily you
[1:36:01] know we listen to that and we go wow
[1:36:02] that's really odd you know for Esau to
[1:36:04] say that but for Esau that was a real
[1:36:06] hiccup in his walk
[1:36:08] huh it became such an issue
[1:36:11] huh that it was that he would sell his
[1:36:14] Birthright for this
[1:36:15] you know either he didn't value the
[1:36:17] birthright or you know whatever the
[1:36:19] reasons may have been my brother and
[1:36:20] sister but something happened to Esau
[1:36:23] that it hindered him from seeing the
[1:36:26] value in that Birthright and was willing
[1:36:29] to sell it for just a moment of
[1:36:32] satisfaction
[1:36:33] you know and we think of the things we
[1:36:35] do maybe during the day we have to be so
[1:36:37] careful that we sell you know we we we
[1:36:40] can have these wonderful moments in
[1:36:42] God's presence we can walk with the god
[1:36:44] with God we can walk with a with a
[1:36:46] living God we can have experiences with
[1:36:49] him and he can heal us and and teach us
[1:36:51] all things in his kingdom and we can
[1:36:52] have all these wonderful things and the
[1:36:54] blessings of God and yet we sell it off
[1:36:56] for what
[1:36:58] huh yeah for what
[1:37:01] oh my so we see how important it is for
[1:37:03] us to be vigilant
[1:37:05] to be vigilant to be spiritually awake
[1:37:08] we need to be awake my brother and
[1:37:11] sister amen no matter how dark our
[1:37:13] situation may get we must remember that
[1:37:15] he's always with us Psalms 23 says yea
[1:37:18] though I walk through the valley of the
[1:37:20] shadow of death I will fear no evil
[1:37:23] for thou art with me thy rod and thy
[1:37:26] staff they comfort me
[1:37:29] don't get our eyes off of those things
[1:37:32] because it will get dark life will get
[1:37:35] tough you know you'll get disappointed
[1:37:37] things will happen in a lot our walks
[1:37:39] and our lives where you know it hurts
[1:37:42] maybe I'm the only one tonight huh but
[1:37:45] we go through experiences and they hurt
[1:37:47] huh we get disappointed whether it's in
[1:37:50] our governments whether it's in food
[1:37:53] you know whatever it may be our vehicles
[1:37:55] you know we get in there one day and it
[1:37:57] doesn't start up like it's supposed to
[1:37:58] start up right you're disappointed you
[1:38:00] know things happen right you know
[1:38:02] spiritual walk these little things can
[1:38:04] happen but you know if we're not careful
[1:38:05] they can start to add up and cause us to
[1:38:08] be weary you know we can even be serving
[1:38:10] God and become weary and serving God
[1:38:14] weary and well doing right so we got to
[1:38:16] be careful then we don't get caught up
[1:38:18] in something that that brings us down
[1:38:21] and and lower and lower and lower and
[1:38:23] before you know it it's become a real
[1:38:24] bad situation where you need
[1:38:25] intervention
[1:38:27] you have a right to break out of those
[1:38:29] things
[1:38:31] I want to tell you a story of of the
[1:38:33] Battle of Stalingrad I don't know how
[1:38:35] many of you know the the Battle of of
[1:38:37] Stalingrad it was a major turning point
[1:38:40] in World War II and we find out that the
[1:38:43] German Army made a massive assault on
[1:38:45] the Soviet Union pressing in and they
[1:38:47] had that Blitzkrieg approach you know
[1:38:49] where they were moving in really quickly
[1:38:51] and and the Soviet Army had to back off
[1:38:53] and back up and back up and and you know
[1:38:55] I want you to start thinking now off
[1:38:57] this German Army it's the sixth Army and
[1:39:00] and remember six cents for the number of
[1:39:02] men right this flesh so this the sixth
[1:39:05] Army is pressing and pressing and man
[1:39:07] they're doing good right we're on enemy
[1:39:09] territory right and we're making our way
[1:39:12] to Moscow and you know we're doing great
[1:39:13] and you know we're going to win this
[1:39:15] thing and man we've got all the air
[1:39:16] support and and you know we are we're
[1:39:18] Invincible right and so what are they
[1:39:21] doing they're pressing towards Moscow
[1:39:22] and and right before they get to Moscow
[1:39:24] they get a command to turn down to
[1:39:26] Stalingrad so they they make their
[1:39:28] Maneuvers down into Stalingrad and you
[1:39:30] know now things are starting to get a
[1:39:31] little bit interesting because why
[1:39:33] Stalingrad are not Moscow well
[1:39:34] Stalingrad is a matter of pride right
[1:39:38] because Stalin was the leader of the
[1:39:40] Soviet Union at the time and so it was
[1:39:42] it was a matter of Pride you know this
[1:39:44] city was named the was named after the
[1:39:46] leader of the Soviet Union and you know
[1:39:48] so for for Hitler this became a matter
[1:39:50] of Pride I'm going to take his glorious
[1:39:52] City from him right and so we started to
[1:39:54] see all this carnality getting into this
[1:39:56] this thing because it wasn't a really as
[1:39:59] great a strategic Point as maybe Moscow
[1:40:01] would have been but anyway we see this
[1:40:03] Army moving down and everything's going
[1:40:05] great huh you know it's like it's like
[1:40:08] when he first become a Christian
[1:40:10] everything's going great you know man
[1:40:13] I'm just defeating the enemy on every
[1:40:15] front I have joy unspeakable and you
[1:40:17] know it's just great but then a change
[1:40:19] comes and the Lord says well we're going
[1:40:21] to move you this direction you know so
[1:40:23] anyway this Army moves down there and
[1:40:25] and it's a big change in command and all
[1:40:27] these things and and they start to press
[1:40:29] down into selling ground and the battle
[1:40:31] now goes beyond just military strategy
[1:40:34] you know it becomes it becomes this
[1:40:36] carnal thing between these two leaders
[1:40:39] and I want you to notice how this when
[1:40:41] this carnality sets into the strategy it
[1:40:44] affected everybody it wasn't just Hitler
[1:40:47] and Stalin who would be affected by this
[1:40:49] but it affected everybody everybody that
[1:40:51] was under the chain of command becomes
[1:40:53] affected by their carnal approach
[1:40:56] this would become be a significant
[1:40:58] defeat for for the Germans
[1:41:01] but it would cost them terrible
[1:41:04] casualties
[1:41:05] and as we move into this battle you can
[1:41:08] go read all the details for yourself if
[1:41:10] you're cared to do so you'll find a
[1:41:12] terrible thing started to happen and the
[1:41:15] casualties started to to rise on both
[1:41:17] sides and great loss of life and and
[1:41:20] people are starting to ask the question
[1:41:21] is this worth it is this battle really
[1:41:23] worth the cost and the Soviets forced
[1:41:26] the Germans into close quarter combat so
[1:41:28] now watch the Germans were doing great
[1:41:31] and everything was happening very
[1:41:32] quickly and they were moving in there
[1:41:33] had a great supply line behind them and
[1:41:36] and lots of ammunition but you see the
[1:41:38] Soviets were playing a trick
[1:41:41] right they had these guys figured out
[1:41:43] you know we can't we can't match them
[1:41:46] right on long range
[1:41:49] combat so what are we going to do we're
[1:41:50] going to draw them in so we're going to
[1:41:53] keep retreating keep retreating right
[1:41:55] just back up ever ever so little every
[1:41:57] ever so now and then right and make them
[1:41:59] think that they're winning
[1:42:00] so we're just going to keep backing out
[1:42:02] backing up and we're going to draw them
[1:42:03] right into close combat why do they do
[1:42:05] that
[1:42:06] so that the Germans can't use their
[1:42:09] advantage of air support against the
[1:42:10] enemy
[1:42:11] so now they've lost the advantage of air
[1:42:13] support they're not going to use the
[1:42:15] long-range guns anymore why because
[1:42:17] they're afraid they're going to hit
[1:42:18] their own guys
[1:42:20] so you see the enemy is drawing them in
[1:42:22] right he's he's playing this game with
[1:42:24] them now you see this very smart and so
[1:42:27] this Army the sixth Army is moving in
[1:42:30] and and now it's all it's becoming
[1:42:31] brutal the combat is close combat it
[1:42:34] starts to become really personal up in
[1:42:37] the face you know they said that those
[1:42:38] battles those skirmishes were fought in
[1:42:40] stairwells and in living rooms and in
[1:42:43] across the streets and in cafes and I
[1:42:45] mean it became really personal
[1:42:48] you know at this point you would think
[1:42:51] that the German commanders would start
[1:42:52] to realize we're losing our advantage
[1:42:54] we're too far deep into enemy territory
[1:42:57] here you see they've lost the edge on
[1:43:00] the on the on the attack
[1:43:04] but they didn't realize that a trap was
[1:43:06] being set
[1:43:08] you know the German Commander's name was
[1:43:10] man stain which is a man or a one who
[1:43:14] lives on Stony ground
[1:43:16] you know Mark 4 and 16 tells us that
[1:43:19] these are they likewise which are sown
[1:43:21] on Stony ground yeah who when they have
[1:43:24] heard the word immediately receive it
[1:43:26] with gladness they're excited happy
[1:43:28] right
[1:43:30] but have no root in themselves in other
[1:43:32] words they don't allow that they have no
[1:43:35] way of allowing that that word to
[1:43:36] penetrate to the soul
[1:43:38] there's no good ground here so they
[1:43:41] endure for about a time see they they
[1:43:43] walk the walk for a while they go to
[1:43:45] church and church attendance is up Ty's
[1:43:47] paying is good you know all these things
[1:43:48] are wonderful But as time goes on it
[1:43:50] just kind of starts to fade yeah
[1:43:53] it says they endure for a Time afterward
[1:43:57] when Affliction or persecution arises
[1:44:00] for the words sake immediately they are
[1:44:03] offended interesting how this man's name
[1:44:08] is is the same
[1:44:11] he's in command of this Army think of
[1:44:13] this now moving in
[1:44:16] this battle isn't really a great a great
[1:44:19] strategic Advantage for them other than
[1:44:20] Pride so it's a carnal battle Yeah
[1:44:24] it's become a carnal thing a personal
[1:44:25] thing
[1:44:27] and yet he knows that the battle has
[1:44:29] changed it's gone from long range from
[1:44:31] him having the advantage to him being
[1:44:34] basically pulled into a trap
[1:44:37] close call to combat
[1:44:40] and on top of all that the Russian
[1:44:42] winter is setting in
[1:44:44] and the German Army was not prepared for
[1:44:47] it
[1:44:48] you know my brother sister we can find
[1:44:50] ourselves walking down this road
[1:44:51] sometimes
[1:44:52] you know it's we realize okay this is
[1:44:55] bad
[1:44:56] right this is not good this I shouldn't
[1:44:58] be here
[1:44:59] and then okay you know we'll just keep
[1:45:01] going for whatever reason you know I'm
[1:45:04] strong enough I'm gonna maybe I'll be in
[1:45:06] there to save somebody else or whatever
[1:45:08] it is and then you know even see the the
[1:45:10] snowflakes coming and you know the
[1:45:12] Winter's setting in and no I'm still
[1:45:14] strong enough for this even though
[1:45:15] you're not dressed for that you know
[1:45:18] that's why I say my brother and sister
[1:45:19] you know weekend weekend in our
[1:45:21] spiritual walks go through the same
[1:45:22] things
[1:45:25] you know we can get hurt and we go
[1:45:27] through the same things
[1:45:28] because the winter can set in in your
[1:45:31] spiritual walk
[1:45:32] right and you have a choice all the time
[1:45:34] my brother and sister and I say this
[1:45:36] With all sincerity all the while if you
[1:45:38] get hurt you have a choice on how you're
[1:45:40] going to receive or treat that hurt
[1:45:44] and I want to remind you that somebody
[1:45:45] bigger than you that can handle that
[1:45:46] hurt it's even bigger you know you might
[1:45:49] say well my heart you know my heart is
[1:45:51] so depressed I'm so hurt well the Bible
[1:45:53] tells us that God is bigger than our
[1:45:55] heart amen that's scriptural so I want
[1:45:58] to just show you by this let's carry on
[1:46:00] with the story here
[1:46:02] the Soviet Army now has become this
[1:46:05] massive counter assault they've got them
[1:46:06] right where they want them and in the
[1:46:08] meantime there's a secret maneuver
[1:46:10] taking place the Soviet Army is moving
[1:46:12] around the North
[1:46:13] the German Army is not aware of this at
[1:46:16] this point but see this is the master
[1:46:18] plan of the Soviet Army to bring them in
[1:46:20] close
[1:46:21] and box them in close quarter combat
[1:46:24] start picking them off
[1:46:26] Winter's coming
[1:46:28] the the picture is perfect for the
[1:46:30] Soviet Army
[1:46:34] this maneuver by the Soviet Army results
[1:46:38] in the German Army being cut off and
[1:46:40] surrounded almost 300 soldiers cut off
[1:46:42] from the supply from the supply line
[1:46:45] over and over the German Commander
[1:46:47] manstein was advised by his men that
[1:46:51] they should break out
[1:46:53] this becomes the very critical part of
[1:46:55] this story here
[1:46:57] so as this is happening they're noticing
[1:46:59] I mean the guys around manstein man
[1:47:02] stain by the way happens to be a
[1:47:03] Christian but you know he's he doesn't
[1:47:05] he he's he's following orders from
[1:47:07] Hitler right
[1:47:09] but his men around him they see what's
[1:47:12] going on you know this is bad this is
[1:47:14] bad on every front and they're telling
[1:47:17] him give the order to break off
[1:47:20] why are they telling him to break out
[1:47:24] to preserve life
[1:47:26] we're not going to win this fight here
[1:47:29] we need to break out to preserve life
[1:47:32] get away from here
[1:47:35] change the environment change the scene
[1:47:38] change the tactics amen like the prophet
[1:47:42] says right if you're going a certain way
[1:47:43] and you just keep falling you keep you
[1:47:46] keep making a certain mistake he says
[1:47:48] make a 180. he says do something
[1:47:50] different amen break out
[1:47:54] but Hitler tells them to hold on don't
[1:47:58] retreat
[1:47:59] right they tried everything they tried
[1:48:01] air drops to supply them but everything
[1:48:04] was failing until the German Commander
[1:48:05] was told even not to surrender at at all
[1:48:08] cost don't surrender Hitler even
[1:48:10] promotes the commit into the command him
[1:48:13] from Commander to field Marshall
[1:48:16] you know it's amazing how the devil can
[1:48:17] do that right you're failing your life
[1:48:20] is falling apart but he's patting you on
[1:48:22] the back huh you're gonna be okay you
[1:48:26] know we go to church miserable we go
[1:48:27] home miserable and and yet we're patting
[1:48:29] ourselves on the bat saying I can handle
[1:48:31] this I'm gonna be okay promoting
[1:48:33] ourselves
[1:48:34] oh my goodness look at the the mindset
[1:48:36] of this right so it reminds him also
[1:48:39] that field Marshals have never ever
[1:48:40] surrendered in the history of the German
[1:48:42] army
[1:48:43] right putting pressure on now right you
[1:48:46] know you're you you got this
[1:48:48] he doesn't have it but you know you've
[1:48:50] got this
[1:48:53] another Germany Army German Army has
[1:48:56] tried to help them but it was too late
[1:48:57] eventually they were forced into
[1:48:59] surrender
[1:49:00] you know 91 000 Germans were taken
[1:49:03] prisoner
[1:49:04] in this combat
[1:49:06] 91 000 you know it's even worse than
[1:49:08] that is that only 5 000 ever returned to
[1:49:12] Germany
[1:49:14] three thousand
[1:49:15] went in but only five thousand came out
[1:49:18] of there
[1:49:22] you see failure to break out cost them
[1:49:25] more than what they could ever have
[1:49:26] afforded
[1:49:28] what were their reasons that they
[1:49:30] weren't allowed to break out
[1:49:32] think of it tonight yeah what were the
[1:49:35] reasons what was so important that they
[1:49:37] would not break out
[1:49:39] stubbornness
[1:49:41] Pride
[1:49:44] you know because of
[1:49:46] them not breaking out severe issues with
[1:49:48] set in just look at these these issues
[1:49:50] that they had
[1:49:51] attrition
[1:49:52] lack of the right kind of food
[1:49:55] unrest brother Ben was talking about
[1:49:58] arrest for our souls but you know these
[1:50:00] guys they couldn't sleep
[1:50:02] because the Soviets would come in with
[1:50:04] medieval style tactics and weapons and
[1:50:07] just just to scare them just to keep
[1:50:09] that chaos going so that they couldn't
[1:50:11] communicate properly and all these
[1:50:13] things and just keep them afraid keep
[1:50:15] them on the edge all the time always
[1:50:16] awake always worrying always panicking
[1:50:20] unrest instability
[1:50:22] confusion fear doubt and worries
[1:50:27] these are all the issues that come in
[1:50:29] with not breaking out
[1:50:32] you see the essential problem with not
[1:50:34] being able to break out is called this
[1:50:35] it's a loss of freedom of
[1:50:37] maneuverability yeah
[1:50:39] not having the freedom to move
[1:50:43] oh my if you if you're in a place
[1:50:46] tonight where you don't have that
[1:50:47] freedom to move you don't have that
[1:50:49] freedom to be joyful you don't have that
[1:50:52] freedom of your health whatever it is
[1:50:54] the devil's got you in a in a box
[1:50:56] somewhere I'm telling you give the
[1:50:58] command tonight call on the law
[1:51:00] call on the Lord tonight say Lord I want
[1:51:03] to break out tonight amen send the
[1:51:06] Angels down amen
[1:51:07] Hallelujah
[1:51:10] see it means to be stuck or to be cut
[1:51:13] off
[1:51:14] and to think that people would reason in
[1:51:17] their minds and think that they're okay
[1:51:19] you see don't blame other people for the
[1:51:22] position or condition that you're in you
[1:51:25] just start with yourself the prophet
[1:51:26] says it's in the message thirst he says
[1:51:28] the Revival ought to begin right in you
[1:51:32] how many here wants a Revival
[1:51:35] Amen Let it begin with you

[1:51:42] your emotions to catch up amen you have
[1:51:44] a right to have a Revival
[1:51:46] amen if you seek him you will find him
[1:51:48] if you're not gonna store he will open
[1:51:51] it unto you amen so you have a right to
[1:51:53] those things let the Revival begin in
[1:51:55] you
[1:51:56] and I want to encourage you tonight
[1:51:57] don't let the Revival be founded on
[1:51:59] emotions
[1:52:01] let the Revival be based on the word of
[1:52:03] God
[1:52:04] when you approach him my brother and
[1:52:06] sister say Lord you said
[1:52:08] if we believe on the Lord Jesus Christ

[1:52:24] will never give way my brother and
[1:52:26] sister start your Revival with a word
[1:52:29] oh my when you begin he says to thirst
[1:52:31] for God there might not be another
[1:52:33] member of the church wanting that
[1:52:35] Revival he says if it breaks out in you
[1:52:37] it'll break out in other places see but
[1:52:40] he says you know you neglect that thirst
[1:52:45] when you're thirsty go get a drink of
[1:52:47] water right we're thirsty you know we
[1:52:50] live in an age in a day where if we're
[1:52:52] thirsty man we we can reach out here go
[1:52:54] there go to Starbucks drive-throughs go
[1:52:57] to the grocery store you know we we feed
[1:52:59] ourselves when we're thirsty well
[1:53:01] spiritually if you're thirsty tonight
[1:53:04] don't neglect it
[1:53:06] break out don't upon the promises
[1:53:08] another quote for you the seed is not
[1:53:10] air with a shock 1965. he says don't be
[1:53:13] afraid to break out upon the promises of
[1:53:16] God
[1:53:18] don't be afraid to break out
[1:53:20] amen
[1:53:22] praise the Lord
[1:53:25] just tell you another little story here
[1:53:26] this evening
[1:53:32] you might say well
[1:53:34] how do I do that how do I break out
[1:53:37] what does this look like
[1:53:41] you see it doesn't matter if you're
[1:53:42] young or old
[1:53:44] God put something inside each and every
[1:53:46] one of us
[1:53:48] I don't want you to underestimate who
[1:53:50] you are yeah
[1:53:52] what God has placed inside of you amen
[1:53:55] you know it talks about that bird that
[1:53:57] is in that shell
[1:53:59] and if I could put a little egg here
[1:54:00] tonight and just place it right here on
[1:54:02] the pulpit
[1:54:03] you would look at that
[1:54:05] shell and you would be thinking well
[1:54:06] that's interesting you know it's not a
[1:54:08] very strong shell maybe you know if it's
[1:54:10] a if it's a chicken egg or something
[1:54:12] like that you know it's not very strong
[1:54:14] maybe but that shell has become a womb
[1:54:16] it's become an environment or it's
[1:54:19] become an atmosphere for something
[1:54:21] inside
[1:54:22] right
[1:54:23] and you know we might look at that and
[1:54:25] we could talk about that all day long
[1:54:26] about that environment that it's in if
[1:54:29] we could talk to the little uh you know
[1:54:31] animal that's on the inside you know we
[1:54:32] could ask it questions how is it in
[1:54:34] there oh it's nice and warm and cozy in
[1:54:36] here and you know and it feels good and
[1:54:38] man every day it's the same right just
[1:54:42] you know so consistent and you know it's
[1:54:44] great and
[1:54:46] but you know if it's if it wants to grow
[1:54:48] something needs to happen
[1:54:51] you know yes and sometimes we can be in
[1:54:54] our Christian walk my brother and sister
[1:54:55] and and we can we can end up in an
[1:54:57] environment like that where where it's
[1:54:58] like you know this is good I'm good up
[1:55:00] to this point I'm comfortable here right
[1:55:03] I'm comfortable and I can I can manage
[1:55:05] this you know I can manage my habits and
[1:55:07] I can manage my my church life and I can
[1:55:09] manage my friends and you know and kind
[1:55:11] of comfortable in my little shell it's
[1:55:13] warm here
[1:55:14] you know but you'll never grow
[1:55:17] so you have to recognize that you know
[1:55:19] you have to break out of that
[1:55:20] environment
[1:55:21] but you know you could come to that
[1:55:23] little bird and you know sometimes it
[1:55:25] feels like that maybe brother Ben can
[1:55:27] relate to that you can preach to that
[1:55:29] little bird in that shell you know hey A
[1:55:31] little birdie in there you need to come
[1:55:33] out of there you know and and you could
[1:55:35] tell it and all these things but you
[1:55:36] know that bird God has done something
[1:55:38] with that bird that in its instincts in
[1:55:40] its makeup that there's a season that'll
[1:55:43] be just right
[1:55:44] there will become a time when it's just
[1:55:46] right for its birth amen and so we as
[1:55:49] Ministry we just you know we bring the
[1:55:51] eggs to church so to speak they right we
[1:55:54] try and bring him into another
[1:55:55] atmosphere so they can hear hey there's
[1:55:57] something going on out there hey there's
[1:56:00] there's rejoicing there's Victory you
[1:56:02] know they they talk about all kinds of
[1:56:04] colors of trees and you know things I've
[1:56:06] never seen before in this environment
[1:56:08] but I want to know what they're talking
[1:56:10] about that's that's out there in that
[1:56:11] other environment you see so there's a
[1:56:14] there's a deep that's calling to a deep
[1:56:15] now right it starts to come into another
[1:56:18] place and see maybe flashes of light and
[1:56:20] and maybe it can feel you know the
[1:56:22] mother come and sit over the egg and
[1:56:24] know that there's something much bigger
[1:56:26] than itself out there you know that
[1:56:28] there's there's a desire now to grow you
[1:56:31] know but it's amazing how that it is
[1:56:33] here's here's what's really important
[1:56:34] this is what I really want to stress
[1:56:36] tonight it's so important that that
[1:56:38] little chick breaks out of that egg on
[1:56:41] his own
[1:56:43] now you might say brother Chris that
[1:56:45] that's cruel
[1:56:47] that's really cruel you know because
[1:56:49] that that's that's hard you know that's
[1:56:51] that's a hard thing for that little bird
[1:56:53] to do this little neck and it's this
[1:56:55] little Beacon oh poor little thing
[1:56:58] right it's cruel it's it's messy it's
[1:57:01] gonna be a hard thing to do and how does
[1:57:03] he know where to Peck and and what to do
[1:57:05] in there right oh my brother and sister
[1:57:07] we can rely on God for these things God
[1:57:10] God put an instinct he put something
[1:57:13] inside that little bird right that knows
[1:57:15] what to do and he and he made his beat
[1:57:17] just the right kind of tip you know and
[1:57:19] the right kind of strength and the right
[1:57:21] kind of everything and we can just have
[1:57:22] faith in God that those things will work
[1:57:24] amen you know in our own lives he says
[1:57:27] greater is he that is in you so whatever
[1:57:30] situation we find ourselves in he knows
[1:57:33] what he made us off amen he knows what
[1:57:35] material we have inside of us he knows
[1:57:37] the instincts that we have like Esther
[1:57:39] said I was made for such a time as this
[1:57:42] huh God had complete confidence in
[1:57:45] Esther he had complete confidence in
[1:57:47] Moses and all the characters of the
[1:57:49] Bibles the heroes of the faith that we
[1:57:50] read about because he put something
[1:57:52] inside of them and he knew at the right
[1:57:54] season at the right time they themselves
[1:57:56] would be able to Peck through that
[1:57:57] little shell to break out upon the
[1:58:00] promises of God you know there was
[1:58:02] denominational shells huh
[1:58:05] come on my brother sister
[1:58:07] denominational shelves you know but God
[1:58:10] knew that there would be a voice there
[1:58:12] would be an eagle flying overhead amen
[1:58:14] and that they're deep calling to a deep
[1:58:16] and there would be something inside that
[1:58:18] little egg amen a little life that
[1:58:20] needed to be birthed something had to
[1:58:22] come forth amen but God had confidence
[1:58:24] that the way he made that little bird
[1:58:26] he's the author and finisher of our
[1:58:29] faith he had complete confidence and
[1:58:31] what I'm saying tonight is for each and
[1:58:34] every one of us wherever we are in our
[1:58:36] walks of life wherever we uh find
[1:58:39] ourselves this evening God knows that
[1:58:41] you can make it
[1:58:42] amen he knows you're made of the right
[1:58:45] stuff
[1:58:46] huh you know we sometimes we come to
[1:58:49] church and we say oh if he can just
[1:58:50] preach just the right sermon or if I can
[1:58:53] get just the right kind of feeling down
[1:58:54] my spine or just the right kind of song
[1:58:56] service and all the music was too fast
[1:58:58] or it was too slow or you know we start
[1:59:01] to get into that realm well it's not
[1:59:02] about those things
[1:59:04] it's it's that was a distraction
[1:59:07] sometimes amen it's about what God has
[1:59:09] done in here and here you can recognize
[1:59:12] God you made me
[1:59:14] you're my maker you knew every complex I
[1:59:17] would have you you knew the environment
[1:59:19] I would be born into you know the family
[1:59:21] traits I would have but God you made me
[1:59:23] and you made me strong enough by your
[1:59:26] Holy Spirit to break out upon the
[1:59:28] promises of God
[1:59:29] you are strong enough tonight
[1:59:33] why do you think he told Joshua be thou
[1:59:35] only very courageous
[1:59:38] and strong
[1:59:40] don't fear don't don't despair don't
[1:59:43] don't dismay
[1:59:45] for the Lord that God is with thee
[1:59:47] wherever thou God
[1:59:50] oh my I'm feeling good tonight
[1:59:53] amen the prophet says it like this in
[1:59:55] the message once more
[1:59:57] he says oh I think now to be conscious
[1:59:59] of the spirit that is near us
[2:00:02] he says that light he says let's break
[2:00:05] out of the shell of the hour
[2:00:08] break out of the shell of the hour we're
[2:00:10] living in and the time and be conscious
[2:00:14] of the spirit of God that is now Among
[2:00:17] Us
[2:00:18] oh my we just take a moment and just
[2:00:21] think about that
[2:00:24] you know I don't know maybe your reasons
[2:00:27] for coming to camp
[2:00:29] why you're here or maybe what you're
[2:00:31] feeling or thinking just right now
[2:00:34] but can you just for a moment just break
[2:00:36] out of those things
[2:00:38] and if we can become conscious
[2:00:40] of his his presence that is right here
[2:00:42] tonight
[2:00:43] right here
[2:00:45] right amongst us
[2:00:47] just break out of the Fashions the
[2:00:50] Hollywoods
[2:00:51] the cares of this life our finances just
[2:00:53] break out long enough to to hear and
[2:00:55] speak
[2:00:56] to hear him touch somebody to have a
[2:00:59] move in our lives
[2:01:01] just become still long enough say Lord
[2:01:03] move upon my situation
[2:01:09] Prophet says it like this he says oh
[2:01:11] there's people today it's just like this
[2:01:13] a man dying on the doorsteps of a
[2:01:15] doctor's office
[2:01:17] when that doctor in the building has the
[2:01:19] cure for his disease but he refuses to
[2:01:22] take it
[2:01:23] if the man has a disease and the doctor
[2:01:25] is secure for it and the man may lay on
[2:01:28] the doctor's doorsteps he says but if he
[2:01:30] refuses to take his medicine he will die
[2:01:32] right there on the doorstep you can't
[2:01:34] blame the doctor
[2:01:37] the doctor would give him the medicine
[2:01:38] that would cure him if he'd only come
[2:01:40] and take it
[2:01:42] but it isn't the doctor's fault he's got
[2:01:45] the remedy but the man's too stubborn to
[2:01:48] take it
[2:01:50] then whose fault is it
[2:01:51] [Music]
[2:01:53] so it is today he says that many people
[2:01:55] die in front of the church
[2:01:59] on the steps in the pews
[2:02:02] die in their sins because they refuse to
[2:02:06] accept God's bonds that is in Gilead
[2:02:10] it's not worth it I just want to tell
[2:02:13] you tonight it's not worth it whatever
[2:02:14] trick the devil's playing on you
[2:02:16] whatever happens he's got you fixed in
[2:02:18] whatever's going on in your life I want
[2:02:20] to tell you tonight it's not worth it
[2:02:23] it's not worth it the devil's it's got
[2:02:25] you in a trap
[2:02:26] amen and there's Messengers that come by
[2:02:29] your way and telling you you're going to
[2:02:30] die here that you got to stop this
[2:02:32] battle this battle is going nowhere this
[2:02:35] this course of action you've taken it's
[2:02:36] taking you nowhere it's only going to
[2:02:38] end up in misery
[2:02:40] you're going to end up without Friends
[2:02:41] The Devil is a destroyer a deceiver and
[2:02:45] a liar
[2:02:46] break out of your situation and then you
[2:02:49] can be sitting in church pews and
[2:02:50] feeling good about yourself and all
[2:02:52] those things and living whatever kind of
[2:02:53] a life there's going to come a day my
[2:02:55] brother and sister where you're not
[2:02:56] going to be able to do that anymore
[2:03:01] break out of it
[2:03:05] you're strong enough to break out of it
[2:03:07] tonight
[2:03:09] you know what you do is just maybe raise
[2:03:10] a hand
[2:03:12] huh just raise a little hand tonight say
[2:03:16] Lord I'm breaking out
[2:03:17] I want to break out I was I'm an eagle
[2:03:19] I'm not a chicken
[2:03:21] I'm an eagle I'm made to soar up there
[2:03:24] in the Heavenly not to be Earthbound and
[2:03:27] caught up here in the Affairs of this
[2:03:29] world and so forth I made an eagle
[2:03:32] I want to be up there in the heaven leaf
[2:03:35] I wanna I want my wings to be spread out
[2:03:37] tonight and maybe just flutter my wings
[2:03:40] a little bit and feel the the faith
[2:03:42] building up
[2:03:43] remember that eagle and maybe I'll just
[2:03:45] close with this musicians can come but
[2:03:47] you remember that eagle that was there
[2:03:49] and the prophet was there and the
[2:03:50] squirrel was there and we get that scene
[2:03:52] you know that eagle was sitting there
[2:03:55] and watching the scene in the presence
[2:03:56] of the Prophet there you know this
[2:03:59] beautiful bird and hear the squirrel or
[2:04:02] chipmunk is going at it you know

[2:04:16] whatever it may be you know the cares of
[2:04:17] life just just going at it 100 miles an
[2:04:20] hour

[2:04:25] and their brother Branham is a hunter
[2:04:28] right and his gun is laying right there
[2:04:30] on the side and here this Eagle finds
[2:04:32] himself in this situation there's a
[2:04:34] hunter and the rifles right over here
[2:04:35] but he wasn't afraid
[2:04:38] see he he wasn't caught up in the
[2:04:40] environment
[2:04:41] because it comes from another
[2:04:43] environment
[2:04:45] my brother
[2:04:48] we are now living in Heavenly places
[2:04:50] even though we are caught up in this
[2:04:52] place and we have to live here and we
[2:04:54] have to work here and do these things
[2:04:55] but we are spiritually in Heavenly
[2:04:57] places see we are actually in a Rapture
[2:05:00] age a bright age we're actually in a
[2:05:03] whole another atmosphere where the Devil
[2:05:05] comes by our way we have the word for
[2:05:07] those things amen that's how we press
[2:05:09] forward that's how we break out is you
[2:05:11] just keep speaking the word just like
[2:05:13] Moses did you're right I've commissioned
[2:05:15] you just speak the word and go forward
[2:05:17] not ego's sitting there and brother
[2:05:19] Brown says you know what what causes you
[2:05:21] to be that way
[2:05:23] huh I love this story
[2:05:25] because that's you and me
[2:05:27] you know he says what causes you to be
[2:05:28] that way I could grab my gun here and
[2:05:30] and so forth I'm a Hunter you know
[2:05:33] yeah that eagle wasn't afraid he just
[2:05:34] looked at him looked at the little
[2:05:36] chipmunk
[2:05:37] you know maybe just checking in on how
[2:05:39] things are going on down here you know
[2:05:41] just checking in on the signs of the
[2:05:42] times and you know just you know all the
[2:05:45] chatter cheddar chatter that's going to
[2:05:46] you know just because he's making ready
[2:05:47] for another kind of flight
[2:05:49] you know and the prophet says it like
[2:05:52] this he says I know why you're not
[2:05:53] afraid and I'm paraphrasing so forgive
[2:05:55] me but he says he says this phrase in
[2:05:57] there he says that eagle has has has
[2:06:00] something in him right he's built a
[2:06:02] certain way he has a power to take him
[2:06:05] from that atmosphere that environment to
[2:06:08] another atmosphere
[2:06:10] and he says that eagle just flexes his
[2:06:12] wings a little bit like this right just
[2:06:15] you know he's just and that's maybe what
[2:06:17] we're doing tonight we're just flexing
[2:06:19] our wings a little bit and he and he
[2:06:21] says it like this he says that ego is
[2:06:23] just checking making sure every feather
[2:06:25] is laying just right
[2:06:28] that's what we're doing tonight we're
[2:06:31] just checking up
[2:06:32] huh in this atmosphere tonight
[2:06:35] we're just we're just flexing our our
[2:06:37] wings a little bit
[2:06:39] amen we're just checking making sure
[2:06:41] that every feather is laying just right
[2:06:42] because we're going to take our flight
[2:06:43] one of these days
[2:06:44] anyway we're gonna break out of here
[2:06:47] amen praise the Lord
[2:06:55] that eagle knows that what God has done
[2:06:57] for him
[2:06:58] can take him out of that environment see
[2:07:01] God by his grace made him a certain way
[2:07:04] God by his grace gave him a certain
[2:07:06] eyesight he gave him a certain instincts
[2:07:09] he gave him a set of wings
[2:07:13] and in a moment that eagle can transport
[2:07:16] himself out of that atmosphere see that
[2:07:18] is the gift we have
[2:07:20] that's the anointing that's upon this
[2:07:22] age and I'm so thankful my brother and
[2:07:25] sister because you know the cares of
[2:07:26] this life can get pretty heavy
[2:07:28] you know this covert thing has has
[2:07:30] changed people
[2:07:32] it's changed the way people
[2:07:34] live and it's changed our governments
[2:07:36] and you know it's taking that good
[2:07:38] feeling away huh
[2:07:40] but you know we don't have to live there
[2:07:43] we don't live on on the whims of our of
[2:07:46] of this world
[2:07:49] we are we are an eagle we're Eagles that
[2:07:52] change our atmosphere
[2:07:54] we live in Heavenly places even though
[2:07:57] we walk through the valley of the shadow
[2:07:58] of death we don't fear no evil why
[2:08:01] because we are living in another
[2:08:03] atmosphere
[2:08:04] why because God has made a way of Escape
[2:08:06] where we can break out
[2:08:08] amen we can go and live in Heavenly
[2:08:11] places
[2:08:12] and while this world is going into chaos
[2:08:14] my brother and sister we don't have to
[2:08:16] live like them we don't have to fear
[2:08:18] like them amen we we have breaking out
[2:08:20] of those things and you know it came by
[2:08:22] a voice and the prophet said that that
[2:08:24] bride when she was marching out he saw
[2:08:26] that vision and he said she was getting
[2:08:28] out of line you know he gave a reason
[2:08:29] for why she was getting out of line
[2:08:31] he said they were watching the world go
[2:08:34] into chaos
[2:08:36] just watching the world go into chaos
[2:08:38] and it was causing her to step out of
[2:08:41] line
[2:08:41] and then he shouted and he said get back
[2:08:44] in line in other words break out
[2:08:47] right
[2:08:48] I'm thankful for a voice I I feel like
[2:08:51] that voice was was for right now
[2:08:55] get back in line
[2:09:01] you know the the token message
[2:09:03] [Music]
[2:09:05] what did he say we we do when we applied
[2:09:07] the token
[2:09:07] [Music]
[2:09:09] you know it was sometimes we have it so
[2:09:11] complicated and so you know
[2:09:15] but he says you create an atmosphere
[2:09:19] that's amazing in this day and age we
[2:09:21] live in the darkest age that we live in
[2:09:24] you mean God has put something inside of
[2:09:26] us that we can create another atmosphere
[2:09:28] we can live in another environment
[2:09:32] think about it but that's what's going
[2:09:34] to bring our loved ones in
[2:09:36] right he says you just create an
[2:09:38] atmosphere of love he says and they will
[2:09:40] come right in
[2:09:44] oh my
[2:09:46] but see we have to break out first we if
[2:09:49] we're not in an atmosphere if we're not
[2:09:50] living see and we can be living in our
[2:09:53] minds in our imaginations and all these
[2:09:56] things we can be living in some very
[2:09:58] dark places
[2:09:59] but it's not where you ought to be
[2:10:01] God has a better place for you tonight
[2:10:04] so I want to encourage you tonight break
[2:10:06] out of those things break out of Despair
[2:10:08] break out of depressions break out of
[2:10:11] fear
[2:10:12] break out of insecurities and complexes
[2:10:14] or habits you know how you do that
[2:10:18] you know he might say brother Chris I
[2:10:19] just can't seem to overcome this habit
[2:10:21] of mine next time it comes up you just
[2:10:23] say I resist you in the name of the Lord
[2:10:24] Jesus Christ
[2:10:27] and you know what he might come back
[2:10:31] he might come back maybe next week you
[2:10:34] know because this weekend we're going to
[2:10:35] feel strong we're going to feel Faith
[2:10:37] rise up you know and then and then

[2:10:43] doesn't pay attention he doesn't listen
[2:10:45] very good right
[2:10:46] but you keep telling him I resist you
[2:10:49] you might fall again even but you tell
[2:10:51] him Satan I resist you
[2:10:53] and you know the more you do that the
[2:10:55] stronger you're going to get
[2:10:57] and you feed on that word right Faith
[2:10:59] cometh by hearing see God's given us all
[2:11:02] the tools
