[20:52] thought for you you know that shikina
[20:54] Tabernacle was created and placed on
[20:56] this Earth for me
[21:00] do you know that each one of you if you
[21:03] could see it that way that that this
[21:05] church every
[21:06] believer and I'm off
[21:11] on oh okay don't worry every believer in
[21:15] this church every brother every
[21:21] sister even the sound guys and ID thank
[21:25] you ID I won't let no other man touch me
[21:28] like just to let you know
[21:30] guys it's only the sound Tes say thank
[21:33] you brother Ed I I had this thought and
[21:35] I thought you know what that God think
[21:38] about it your job where you now God made
[21:42] that company come to pass to exist on
[21:45] this Earth to give you a job in this
[21:48] time that's how God works every believer
[21:51] here is for your help and for your for
[21:54] your encouragement and for a space of
[21:56] time in your walk with the Lord
[21:58] everything thing is so orchestrated we
[22:01] just don't always see every angle we
[22:03] only see the little bit this way we
[22:06] never see the other ways I used to work
[22:08] for a company and it was a big company
[22:10] and one day a brother said that do you
[22:13] know that that company was created so
[22:16] that you could have a job and that said
[22:18] you can fulfill a purpose here in
[22:20] Wellington so that you can come to
[22:22] shikina Tabernacle and come between all
[22:24] these brothers and sisters and that you
[22:26] would find a place where God wants you
[22:28] to be
[22:29] have you ever thought about it that that
[22:31] it's not just all of us here but all of
[22:34] us was made for Jimmy all of us was made
[22:36] for Ben all of us was made for sister
[22:39] Nomi all of us was made for each other
[22:41] and God took all our South African ways
[22:44] Botswana ways Zimbabwe ways Namibia ways
[22:47] Nigeria ways um come from Korea ways
[22:50] everywhere he he he did something to
[22:53] bring us all back at this time in this
[22:56] place
[22:58] now I tell you God can do Logistics we
[23:01] might not be able to do it but God can
[23:03] do it and the thing is when I look at
[23:05] you I know that there is some value that
[23:08] there is going to come out of you in my
[23:10] life and if you can always see it that
[23:12] way and go Lord these people are going
[23:15] to bring something into my life that's
[23:18] going to help my walk with you how would
[23:21] Church be when we do that amen so that
[23:24] was not my sermon I just felt late to
[23:26] say that let's go to Revelation 4 and
[23:28] we're going to ver read verses 10 and 11
[23:32] I'll put it up there for those who don't
[23:34] bring their Bibles you should really
[23:35] bring your
[23:40] Bibles now this is not this is my
[23:43] opening test I'm always so nervous
[23:45] standing here so guys please help me
[23:47] today because I think this is a very
[23:50] very
[23:51] um yeah a very sacred
[23:56] spot thank you very much
[23:59] now we read there from verse 10 and
[24:01] seeing the four and 20 Elders fell down
[24:03] before him that sat on the throne and
[24:06] worshiped him that lived forever and
[24:08] ever and they cast their Thrones Before
[24:11] the Throne saying Thou Art Worthy oh
[24:14] Lord to receive glory and honor and
[24:16] power for thou has created all things
[24:19] and for thy pleasure they are and were
[24:23] created may the Lord um just add his
[24:27] Blessing to this word let's just pray
[24:28] Lord Jesus we have opened this word very
[24:32] sacred word Lord which you have sent to
[24:34] us Lord but Lord if you don't show up
[24:37] this is nothing Lord so we ask that you
[24:38] will just add your blessing to this word
[24:41] and may all of us just get some
[24:42] gleanings from this evening that would
[24:44] help us with you Lord and to walk with
[24:46] you Lord I pray in Jesus Christ's name
[24:49] amen you may have your
[24:51] seats now I'm going to TI myself because
[24:54] tonight I really don't want to be long
[24:55] as a prayer meeting and I I I just said
[24:58] 25 minutes max if I do go over I don't
[25:02] look at my wife because then usually I'm
[25:04] in
[25:06] trouble this is
[25:09] my my sermon for tonight I think kids
[25:13] this one is for you I put heaps of
[25:15] pictures oh brother B is here God bless
[25:17] you you made it may timing we just
[25:20] prayed for your safe arrival you should
[25:22] have traveled by thought cuz that was
[25:24] fast so I I missed a clicker though I
[25:27] really love that Clicker
[25:29] right merry Christmas we sit in we sit
[25:32] in this time where we have tinsel and
[25:36] all these things and trees and and and
[25:39] all this festive things going on Beyond
[25:41] us and and around us and the world is
[25:43] just caught up in this thing called
[25:47] Christmas but I kind of think they they
[25:49] really don't know What Christmas
[25:52] Means I think they've they've really
[25:54] lost the meaning of Christmas now we
[25:56] know that Jesus Christ wasn't born in
[25:58] December that's fine but we can still
[26:00] celebrate
[26:02] Christmas we have so much more to be
[26:05] thankful for than the the normal guy out
[26:08] there you know they compete who's got oh
[26:11] that's the wrong one whoops there we go
[26:12] they compete who's got the best
[26:14] fireplace with the most stockings on
[26:16] them the biggest tree with the most
[26:17] lights they could fit on them they got
[26:19] they they so obsessed to get this image
[26:22] in their
[26:23] house because it will bring the
[26:25] atmosphere of Christ into their eyes or
[26:27] that's what they think now I don't say
[26:30] Christmas tree is wrong guys before you
[26:32] all well we know that there is people
[26:35] that love Christmas trees and all those
[26:36] things I'm not going to preach against
[26:38] you relax guns down
[26:40] okay I love Christmas I used to wrap my
[26:43] socks and put it under the tree to have
[26:45] more presents than my brother okay just
[26:47] let you know he never knew where I got
[26:49] all the gifts from I had a toy car that
[26:51] got dented 10 times rof is in he never
[26:53] knew it was a car I knew that was
[26:55] wrapped up that was under the tree so I
[26:57] was always always love Christmas it was
[26:59] a fun time and it was a beautiful time
[27:01] because um sister L and I we were
[27:04] talking about it the other time we used
[27:05] to sing uh songs Christmas songs and
[27:08] carols when we were in church even at
[27:10] denomination church we would have
[27:12] Christmas plays and it was all around
[27:14] Christ it was a different atmosphere
[27:16] than what the world made it so Christmas
[27:18] is good because it reminds of of the
[27:21] gift that came for us it it really
[27:24] reminds me as a Christian where I come
[27:27] from you know because and I'm not going
[27:29] to jump ahead but then again they they
[27:32] wrong button again hey let's try that
[27:33] one then they tried to see if the
[27:35] outside could have more lights than the
[27:37] guy next door the poor power grid can't
[27:39] handle all these lights that these guys
[27:41] are putting on they get subsidies to put
[27:42] all these lights on and there's always a
[27:44] purpose behind these lights but it's
[27:47] it's very seldom
[27:49] Christ so they're in the spirit of
[27:52] Christmas but they're not under the
[27:54] spirit of the Lord and I madean it in a
[27:57] nice way they're not under the the holy
[27:58] spirit because they get so obsessed to
[28:01] get these things right in the right time
[28:03] and they have a lot of people carry on
[28:04] but I don't see life's change in fact I
[28:08] see a bigger pressure coming on the
[28:10] people in this time a lot of pressure
[28:15] and and it is sad to see it and then
[28:18] they go and take the best day you could
[28:21] ever celebrate am I breaking oh you got
[28:23] the clicker thank you so much God bless
[28:25] you brother James is it working
[28:29] how does this we try oh is it
[28:37] on yep it's on and I'm going to give it
[28:39] a go go back go back go back forward
[28:44] back forward back okay leave it don't
[28:46] worry so what happens is now they take
[28:49] this dude called Father
[28:51] Christmas and they make him a
[28:54] reality as if our kids would write him
[28:57] spe notes and this guy can come and tell
[29:00] us who who's good and who's
[29:03] bad so now he's the judge and if youve
[29:06] been a really good boy you get a prison
[29:09] well it's very close to the gospel
[29:10] because you the the violent take it by
[29:12] force if you really want more of God
[29:14] there's more of God to give you but it
[29:16] it it doesn't matter if you're a good
[29:18] boy or a bad boy it's the choice you
[29:19] make towards God which brings you a
[29:21] reward you could be the real worst boy
[29:23] you've ever been and you can have a
[29:26] change of heart and God can give you
[29:28] eternal life the biggest gift amen see
[29:31] what this happens is now this is it in
[29:33] in the flesh it says if I'm good enough
[29:35] for long enough I'll get there I'll get
[29:38] my present from Mom and Dad but if I've
[29:40] slipped up once then that's over doesn't
[29:43] that coming to the
[29:45] gospel so I thought let me come and tell
[29:48] you the real story behind
[29:50] Christmas it's not this who's got the
[29:52] biggest threee the most gifts who gets
[29:54] the best discount and the best he and
[29:55] hers gift it's not about that
[29:58] it's it's all wrong if you did buy
[30:01] someone the best gift and you think it's
[30:03] his and her gift praise the lord we all
[30:06] get a reward but this is not what
[30:08] Christmas is about so I thought I'll
[30:11] tell my story of
[30:14] Christmas it became with these guys the
[30:17] Magi now I read this book this little
[30:19] story book that brother brandom
[30:21] Illustrated about the Magi and it
[30:23] touched me so much and I thought maybe
[30:24] I'll just share the story with you
[30:25] tonight it's just a little um Sunday
[30:28] school so just follow me as we
[30:32] go the the attitude towards God word
[30:36] God's word and the visitation of the
[30:38] Angel is the thing that I am most
[30:40] concentrating about this
[30:43] story so we start here with
[30:45] Mary Mary she received the word of the
[30:49] Lord for her
[30:51] day so if you don't know the story
[30:54] children you're going to get the one
[30:55] with pictures I hope you're looking
[30:58] if you're not I might call out your name
[31:01] now you don't have to look here's the
[31:03] scripture for it it says and the angel
[31:06] said unto her fear not Mary for thou
[31:08] have found favor with God and behold
[31:10] Thou shalt conceive in thy womb and
[31:12] bring forth a son and his name shall be
[31:16] Jesus Hallelujah so she gets this
[31:18] visitation from the
[31:20] Angel and the angel speaks to her and
[31:22] says you know what you're going to have
[31:25] a son but we had a problem here
[31:28] she was a
[31:30] virgin so that means she she's never
[31:32] been with a man so she she can't have a
[31:35] baby it's a bit the logistics behind
[31:38] this is a bit hard but let me explain to
[31:40] you with God nothing is
[31:43] impossible but now Mary had two choices
[31:46] she could accept the word of God because
[31:49] remember she had a
[31:51] fiance
[31:54] James
[31:55] Tiana picture this put yourself in the
[31:59] scene this is not a story this is real
[32:01] life an angel comes to Mary she goes and
[32:04] she says be it unto me I will take the
[32:08] word I'm going to have Christ and then
[32:11] just after that she goes
[32:14] oh what am I going to tell
[32:16] Joseph H uh how do I explain
[32:21] this isn't there sometimes where God
[32:24] sends you a word in season and he says I
[32:26] need you to speak this and receive this
[32:28] word and you look at your partner and
[32:30] you go ah how am I going to how am I
[32:33] going to say this because I had one of
[32:37] those in my life and it came to a point
[32:39] where I had to tell my wife some certain
[32:42] things and God was dealing with me and I
[32:45] had to get to that point where I accept
[32:47] the word of the Lord or I reject it and
[32:51] if I accept it well there's still the
[32:53] other half of that have you ever done
[32:56] such a thing brother Ben we we had a
[32:58] couple of rodeos me and you as well we
[33:00] spoke a lot about it a lot of your
[33:02] testimony and my testimony just go so
[33:04] beautifully together where you get to a
[33:06] point where God makes things it seems
[33:09] for you very hard but this wasn't a hard
[33:12] Choice she didn't know the logistics
[33:14] behind this because remember this was
[33:15] real life this is Jesus Christ going to
[33:17] be born this is a wonderful thing but in
[33:20] the carnal realm in the human realm
[33:23] she's still engaged she has to still go
[33:25] to Joseph and give him the news and
[33:28] would he accept it here you sit with the
[33:31] greatest message of all time and
[33:34] sometimes we can't just go to the guy
[33:35] next to us and give him that but we've
[33:38] accepted it isn't it the same so I'm
[33:41] just saying that in real life she had a
[33:43] a little bit of a I would say a a big
[33:47] battle so there's a fiance and she goes
[33:50] to him and she says Joseph I'm going to
[33:53] be
[33:55] pregnant but I've been with no man
[33:58] man now for Joseph to figure this out
[34:01] would have been an immense thing cuz
[34:03] this is Christmas we're talking about
[34:05] but people make it a story and forget
[34:08] that this was real lives that's
[34:10] happening this is for real life and that
[34:12] these two was in the most epic time in
[34:14] their relationship which was supposed to
[34:16] be the most beautiful time this happens
[34:20] and he's got a choice to accept the word
[34:23] of the Lord coming through a mouthpiece
[34:25] or to reject it because he's saying I've
[34:28] seen an angel and now I'm pregnant and
[34:31] he's going I don't think it's going to
[34:33] happen I don't think it can happen so
[34:35] he's doubting and he did because I'll
[34:38] prove it to you everybody thinks that
[34:40] everything just went good see the the
[34:44] the scriptures said in the book of
[34:46] Isaiah that behold the Virgin shall
[34:47] conceive and she would have given him
[34:49] the scripture and said this is this this
[34:50] is the
[34:52] Fulfillment but he did not believe
[34:56] everybody thinks it was just a very nice
[34:58] story and just believed then Joseph A
[35:00] husband being a just man will not make
[35:03] it public for example was minded to put
[35:06] her away
[35:07] priv so if he believed the word would he
[35:10] have put her
[35:13] away so sometimes we come with something
[35:15] very hard that God gives us to tell
[35:17] someone else and I'm meaning in a nice
[35:20] way and you correct them or you give
[35:22] them that
[35:23] word and they reject it or don't believe
[35:26] it just move on God gave you the word in
[35:29] your season that seed that you receive
[35:32] this message that you have received it
[35:34] will bring forth because God don't work
[35:36] on one side he always works on both
[35:38] sides don't have to worry about it don't
[35:40] figure it out God has got the other side
[35:42] covered you know he's not just going to
[35:44] leave you if he brings you in word and
[35:45] season to fight yourself he'll bring you
[35:47] the other side I have to hurry up don't
[35:49] want to preach
[35:52] so now see God comes in the other side
[35:58] Joseph is
[35:59] sleeping and here the angel comes to him
[36:01] and says Joseph everything that Mary
[36:03] said to you I'm not going to read it
[36:05] verse of verse but these are scriptures
[36:07] you can go read it cuz I I stay in the
[36:09] word he says but I want you to know that
[36:13] she is pregnant and that's the Son of
[36:16] God that's there she was overshadowed by
[36:18] the Holy Ghost and then he gives him
[36:20] instruction and you will call his name
[36:23] Jesus confirming what Mary said
[36:28] now there's no
[36:29] doubt so this is when you get to a place
[36:32] and you want to share the message and
[36:33] you're busy sharing the message and
[36:34] brother Colin goes back to youself I got
[36:36] you man God had me this is the scripture
[36:38] for it and you're like wow because God
[36:41] confirms everything that we do he
[36:43] confirms for us we don't have to worry
[36:45] about it but Christmas there was this
[36:47] event happening but see all the the the
[36:50] logistics that had to happen for Christ
[36:53] to come forth wasn't as easy as we think
[36:56] it is but scriptures were being
[36:58] fulfilled and now because that is now a
[37:00] prophecy and it was confirmed Satan
[37:03] wasn't
[37:05] happy and now Satan wants to put a
[37:08] spanner in the works because we all
[37:11] think a she got pregnant and then and
[37:13] then um and then everything was good and
[37:16] they went to an inn and when they get to
[37:17] the Inn there wasn't place for them they
[37:19] forget a lot of the story that actually
[37:21] went on wasn't that easy then all of a
[37:24] sudden Logistics came into play now
[37:27] we've got um the decree from Caesar
[37:30] Augustus comes that everybody should be
[37:31] taxed and you have to go back to your
[37:34] hometown but they're not very close to
[37:36] Bethlehem and because Joseph is a son of
[37:39] David or in the lineage of David he has
[37:40] to go all the way back to Bethlehem now
[37:43] it's Logistics now they didn't call the
[37:46] ambulance and say hey can you come pick
[37:49] up my wife we need to go to Bethlehem
[37:51] you know so cuz she's pregnant she can't
[37:53] really
[37:54] travel and of course Joseph knew she was
[37:56] pregnant so she would been showing now
[37:58] he's going to put her on the back of a
[37:59] donkey and here they go to Bethlehem and
[38:03] they can't travel at day they have to
[38:04] travel at night because it's too hot
[38:06] that day and she's pregnant and who's
[38:08] ever been pregnant in this place it's
[38:10] very uncomfortable they water like this
[38:13] water wle wle okay and then when they go
[38:16] sit down I love it they're like I'm
[38:18] going to approach the seat I'm going to
[38:19] I'm going to get the seat yeah I got
[38:23] it okay now mention the seat moves like
[38:27] this
[38:29] for
[38:30] kilometers this is going to be
[38:32] uncomfortable has God ever asked you
[38:35] something that made you
[38:38] uncomfortable but they went are we going
[38:42] you see what I mean he might ask you
[38:44] something out of your comfort zone but
[38:46] he still wants you to go and this decree
[38:50] came forth because he wanted them to a
[38:52] place where the scripture could have
[38:53] been
[38:54] fulfilled because God's word in your
[38:57] life will will be fulfilled I hope you
[38:58] follow along it's like a a kind of segue
[39:01] in our lives that this time God might be
[39:04] talking to you and might put you in a
[39:06] very uncomfortable place and it's fine
[39:09] are you willing to go that extra
[39:12] mile amen now while he's doing this
[39:16] might as well dis close this because I
[39:17] feel I don't need that now while he's
[39:20] doing this on the other side in India
[39:24] there's these guys called the Magi
[39:27] they in India they came from Babylon and
[39:30] brother Brandon picks it up and I'll
[39:31] give you some of the scriptures that he
[39:33] says and and they moved up into India
[39:35] now they're in
[39:36] India and God these two um Mary and
[39:41] Joseph they're going now to Bethlehem
[39:44] and at that same time he starts dealing
[39:47] with the the Magi now the Magi to give
[39:50] you a little bit of just background
[39:52] behind that he says as I go back into
[39:55] some of the ancient history such as his
[39:57] L Two
[39:59] Babylons pardon me and the many of the
[40:01] ancient writings to study what was these
[40:04] Magis because I thought maybe someday
[40:07] that brother Armand someday somebody
[40:10] might ask me the
[40:11] question who these Magis are and I find
[40:14] out that these Magis are in
[40:17] India um they were really the me of
[40:20] Persian and they were speaking of the
[40:22] the other night at belto Zar the big
[40:25] rock and roll party where when the mes
[40:28] of Persia took over babylon's Kingdom
[40:31] and they immigrated and got up into
[40:33] India now in India they were called the
[40:36] Untouchable but in Hindu they are the
[40:39] means of Persian and they would they
[40:41] will still have the Arts of the wise men
[40:44] now you find them the Magis were not
[40:47] these type of fellows today that take
[40:49] the stars and tells your fortune so he
[40:53] says it's not fortune tellers these guys
[40:55] they're not normal Guys these these guys
[40:57] are very spiritual he says but they were
[41:01] scientific men who who watched the
[41:03] heavenly bodies and they took a and
[41:06] could look and know every little star
[41:09] that was visible to the human eye and if
[41:11] every little one moved it meant that
[41:13] there was some spiritual
[41:15] significance so these guys on the other
[41:18] side of the world basically knew every
[41:21] Star in there where was the first Bible
[41:24] wrote in the stars stars with a virgin
[41:28] ends with a lion okay so they didn't
[41:31] need a
[41:32] Bible but they knew that there was
[41:34] something changing in the sky and that
[41:36] means
[41:37] something so sometimes if we stay in the
[41:40] word of God and we stay in our Bible
[41:45] when things change around us and it
[41:47] doesn't line up with scripture you know
[41:49] where you are you know a event is taken
[41:52] place and then sometimes brother Ben
[41:54] would be preaching something and he's
[41:56] opening up a word word in our very
[41:58] service and you have it in your word and
[42:01] it's been confirmed because you were
[42:02] staying in your word the whole week and
[42:05] you were listening to the tape and you
[42:06] were eating the the word of God and the
[42:09] confirmation comes over the pulpit and
[42:11] it comes through in in in scripture and
[42:13] in Fellowship what is happening the same
[42:16] event Christ is being birthed in your
[42:19] life it is the same thing that's what
[42:21] Christmas is about God getting personal
[42:24] to all of
[42:26] us so what happened is at about about
[42:29] that time we the association had a
[42:33] meeting and they brother brandom goes
[42:35] I'm going to go over the notes here but
[42:37] brother brandham goes and he says that
[42:39] they had the writings of Daniel because
[42:40] remember Daniel was the the chief
[42:44] magician I always say magician magician
[42:47] in Babylon and he was their Chief and
[42:50] they read his
[42:52] writings and so they were sitting one
[42:54] night and they were looking and one of
[42:56] them came came in and and they um they
[42:59] started opening they said so they they
[43:02] the manuscript was presented for a study
[43:04] night and while they were looking upon
[43:06] this manuscript they fell into these
[43:08] words that Daniel said and beheld I see
[43:11] a stone cut out of the mountain without
[43:13] hands and it and it um and it subdued
[43:17] all the kingdoms of the world and and it
[43:20] raised up because it was great it
[43:22] covered the whole earth and while they
[43:24] were reading this watching up to every
[43:26] Star cuz that's what what they did they
[43:28] saw that stranger
[43:31] appear now he didn't call it a star that
[43:35] that kind of got my attention he never
[43:37] called it a star he said a stranger
[43:40] appeared now we know that brother
[43:44] brandom sees a little bit different than
[43:46] than we saw he saw the pillar of
[43:49] fire and he knew that these Magis and
[43:52] and he brings it out I'll show it to you
[43:54] here they worshiped the one true God by
[43:58] a sacred
[43:59] fire so he knew their makeup he knew
[44:02] that he could trust this man with the
[44:05] job that they need to do in the next
[44:07] couple of years it wasn't days it wasn't
[44:11] weeks it was years it took them to get
[44:13] to Jesus I just want to add this in we
[44:16] we all think they just they saw the star
[44:18] they followed the star they got there
[44:20] and presented their gifts and then they
[44:22] left it was years of travel and I'll
[44:25] I'll show you why he says but I want to
[44:27] just bring this in they worshiped the
[44:29] one and true God by a sacred fire they
[44:32] watched the licking um of the blazes for
[44:35] they knew that the true God dwelt in
[44:37] light and that is true God dwells in
[44:40] light when he was here on Earth
[44:41] manifested in flesh he said I am the
[44:44] light of the world because God was
[44:46] manifested through him so Christ is the
[44:49] light here we've got all the tinsel all
[44:52] the lights all the trees we we sucking
[44:55] the grid dry to get that that light out
[44:57] there yet there's no
[44:59] light but here is light greater than any
[45:04] light out there and he goes on to say
[45:08] and that he that light was the pillar of
[45:11] fire that led the children of Israel and
[45:13] it was that light that struck Paul down
[45:15] on the road to Damascus and it was that
[45:17] light that came into the prison with
[45:19] Peter it's that light that is on the
[45:21] picture and it's that light in my heart
[45:23] and it's that light in this church and
[45:25] when I read that I felt real good and I
[45:29] thought thank God for that light I don't
[45:33] need tinsel I don't need trees I don't
[45:35] need even that Spotlight I just need
[45:37] that light because when I see that light
[45:40] I know where I am and so these PS um um
[45:44] Ms of Persia these wise men they were
[45:48] 4,500 kilm away from
[45:52] Christ
[45:53] 4,500 km I Googled it Google thank than
[45:57] you that's where they were leave hours
[46:01] they had to go through Pakistan Iran
[46:03] Iraq all the way to go through look what
[46:05] they had to cross
[46:07] deserts like this was not hey guys I see
[46:10] a star we're going to get over the hill
[46:12] and this this Babylon this was Logistics
[46:14] and some days we can't even take 30
[46:16] minutes to get to
[46:19] church I thought shame on
[46:22] me some days it gets too hard to get
[46:25] here but these these guys they wanted to
[46:28] see what is it all
[46:32] about so sometimes we show up here in
[46:34] the we're sitting here in the in the
[46:38] pews and the preacher basically has to
[46:40] call your name to wake you up or get you
[46:42] into the service why don't you show up
[46:45] to see what it's about and leave all
[46:48] that other shenan speack your camel
[46:50] start on the tour when the preacher is
[46:53] preaching just keep pulling you'll find
[46:55] something coming your way and it's that
[46:58] light that Pillar of Fire I'm talking
[47:00] about because that's what Christmas is
[47:03] about it's God moving among us all and
[47:06] in us all it's a wonderful time it's
[47:08] when you just some love everyone you
[47:11] can't be angry at people you still get
[47:13] angry but you you don't you don't stay
[47:15] angry you just forgive them quickly you
[47:18] know and and you remind them that the
[47:20] pron they're going to buy you must be
[47:21] bigger now because you were angry at
[47:22] them no you don't you don't do that but
[47:26] I want you see that these guys they they
[47:29] were going to take this whole
[47:32] tour to get now the to the little baby
[47:36] because they knew that something
[47:38] happened and so they pack the camels and
[47:41] all these three go and they're going to
[47:43] go find Christ but if we stay inside the
[47:46] lines of the
[47:48] word every
[47:50] day and we read our Bibles and we have
[47:53] fellowship with Christ we will know when
[47:56] that light comes into this presence into
[47:59] this
[48:00] building I said to brother Ben and I and
[48:02] I will say it again every Wednesday
[48:05] every Sunday it's not a service it's a
[48:08] event because since since we've come to
[48:12] this place God has placed us all out of
[48:15] our comfort zone
[48:17] true are you
[48:19] comfortable it's all different it's all
[48:21] setups it's all it's not home but it's
[48:25] home it's the same Spirit that's here
[48:29] and then what happens is because the
[48:30] change of scenery you feel a little bit
[48:32] different when you come to church and
[48:35] then you enter in a little bit more and
[48:37] all of a sudden the atmosphere
[48:40] change and then brother Isaac comes with
[48:42] this powerful service about the
[48:45] heart and I'm thinking wow I said Lord
[48:49] check me first because now all of a
[48:51] sudden my my attitude change and I think
[48:54] no matter what the next guy do to me I
[48:56] always remember that
[48:57] heart and I'm thinking man that's an
[48:59] event God telling us that there's more
[49:02] in this place that we'll ever realize
[49:05] we're dealing with hearts in his
[49:09] hand oh that was powerful I thought man
[49:11] Lord may I never hurt the heart that is
[49:14] in your
[49:16] hand I'm about to
[49:19] close I got 35 seconds left oh dear
[49:23] don't look at
[49:24] that couple of minutes
[49:28] um okay here I am and brother Brandon
[49:32] picks this up he says it was an awful
[49:33] Journey now remember this is the birth
[49:35] of Christ but look at all this Logistics
[49:38] around it it's it's ridiculous what's
[49:41] going on and we thinking it's just a
[49:43] little baby in the manger it is events
[49:46] happening from every angle to get to a
[49:50] point where there's going to and I'll
[49:51] show you now I said and they had an
[49:53] awful Journey they GED down over the
[49:55] mountains over the west side followed
[49:57] the Great trious River down till they
[49:59] and I'm have to stop almost down till
[50:02] they crossed the Ford perhaps and down
[50:04] there at the river Euphrates so Jour
[50:06] through the Sahara probably they had to
[50:08] travel by night because it was so hot in
[50:10] the daytime and then again they had to
[50:13] follow that
[50:14] star and it was the only thing shining
[50:16] at night and finally they came into
[50:20] Jerusalem can I can I go
[50:22] on I really want to just I'll I'll stop
[50:26] I'll few Lord stop me when you want me
[50:27] to stop and when they got to Jerusalem
[50:30] they were looking for this they knew he
[50:32] was a Jew so they surely thought that he
[50:35] would be born a
[50:39] celebrity
[50:41] hey so you you you you get into the
[50:44] message brother Colin and you start
[50:48] sharing and everybody looks at you
[50:50] crazy is that
[50:52] right and you think but everybody would
[50:55] accept this message it's so good it's
[50:58] revealing Christ it's it's bringing
[51:01] forth Christ in in the present tense the
[51:03] I am God doing Miracles and they all
[51:07] look at you and go you're crazy you're
[51:10] off your
[51:12] rocket but you know what and surely he
[51:16] was to be a very religious man very
[51:18] clever very
[51:19] intellectual same as all the
[51:21] denominations they always look at this
[51:22] pastor so and so with all these things
[51:24] and see he they were coming with the
[51:27] wrong
[51:29] mindset but God had them he had
[51:33] them but
[51:34] notice when they walked into Jerusalem
[51:38] the star went
[51:40] out so you walk into
[51:43] a I'm going to say it you walk into a
[51:46] denominational church and you go sit
[51:48] down and all you hear is greets dogmas
[51:52] dos and
[51:54] Dons I sat in those places it's like the
[51:57] morg and very sincere people in there
[52:01] but Christ is not in there the star is
[52:03] on the outside because when Christ says
[52:07] come all the way in they just
[52:11] couldn't and I and I and I I really love
[52:14] those people don't get me wrong don't
[52:16] put fences up against these people don't
[52:18] put barriers up don't don't push them
[52:20] out there's more space we can fill these
[52:23] aisles come on that that's that's what
[52:26] the message is for don't you start
[52:28] thinking oh but they believe Creeds and
[52:30] they so wrong and then you made a Creed
[52:33] yourself you just love them and you tell
[52:36] the truth and the honest truth as you
[52:38] heard from what brother brandom taught
[52:40] us and said us the revealed word and you
[52:42] stick with this word and if you cannot
[52:44] find it in the word stay with
[52:46] it and now I just want to get to this
[52:49] part they got to this King a um a
[52:54] horrible King a
[52:57] murderer just a very very bad man
[52:59] brother B uh brother Ben brother brandom
[53:02] says he was a murderer a heartless
[53:06] bloodthirsty
[53:07] Herod he he hated God's people he just
[53:11] he just was a a cruel
[53:13] man and see what happens is sometimes
[53:16] you think you come to a
[53:18] place where you think Christ is and you
[53:22] run into people like this
[53:26] remember this is the event that took
[53:28] place this guy was real this is no joke
[53:31] I try to get the most realest people
[53:33] there this King was
[53:35] alive and he was a horrible man and so
[53:38] what he does is he agrees with you until
[53:40] you stay on the word and they go ha
[53:43] there must be the king of the Jews the
[53:45] three wise men says he's born here he's
[53:47] somewhere here he must be in your
[53:49] kingdom and they very excited and he
[53:50] goes king of king of what another king
[53:54] he go yeah ooh another king yeah oh you
[53:57] believe the message yeah oh very nice
[54:01] very nice but um yeah we we don't really
[54:04] think about this serpent seed and stuff
[54:06] like this but but hey you you believe
[54:08] the message and he tries to kill your
[54:10] influence because that spirit it's not a
[54:14] man it's a spirit and that same Spirit
[54:17] was the one that wanted to kill Moses
[54:19] when the promise came forth it was the
[54:21] same spirit and sometimes when you start
[54:24] dealing with people they take on that
[54:26] spirit and they want to kill the
[54:27] influence and we heard it with brother
[54:29] Ben and brother um Isaac they try to
[54:32] kill the influence it's the same spirit
[54:36] so he says to them go find this young
[54:38] man go find this baby and if you found
[54:42] him come to me because I want to go and
[54:44] I want to pay tribute to
[54:48] him so so give me all the message books
[54:51] give me everything you
[54:53] have but I have no intent of reading
[54:55] them
[54:56] it's the same
[54:58] spirit I had that Spirit once God
[55:02] delivered me from that he had to use my
[55:05] wife to do
[55:06] that and here we go we're almost there
[55:09] but there was a scripture to fulfill in
[55:11] this man's life and that scripture was
[55:14] Jeremiah it says thus sa the Lord a
[55:16] voice was heard in ramar lamentation a
[55:19] bitter weeping Rachel weeping for a
[55:20] children refused comfort for children
[55:23] because they were not and that was
[55:25] speaking about those baby babies that he
[55:27] was going to murder because what
[55:29] happened is he found out that the three
[55:32] wise men lied to him they never returned
[55:35] cuz God warned them in a dream and then
[55:37] he got angry and he started killing
[55:39] twoyear olds cuz he backtracked and he
[55:41] started thinking when did they speak
[55:43] about they started to travel and when
[55:45] did they say they were going there so
[55:47] that's about two years and he goes and
[55:49] he says every child under two years cut
[55:51] it it wasn't a default setting for the
[55:53] for the Kingdom at that time he knew
[55:56] what he was doing he wanted to kill
[55:58] Christ he didn't want the king Satan
[56:01] didn't want Christ to come forth because
[56:04] then all of us was without
[56:07] hope amen and sometimes that same Spirit
[56:10] don't want Christ to come forth in your
[56:12] life he wants to hold you up with these
[56:14] things and this guy that because if he's
[56:18] not real God's not real because
[56:21] everybody at school tells my little
[56:23] four-year-old that Santa is not real and
[56:26] he's telling everybody about Jesus and
[56:28] they telling about he's not real either
[56:29] because if we can see Santa and he's a
[56:31] fat man in a suit all dressed St coming
[56:34] with gifts that parents buy where's
[56:36] Christ it's the same spirit it's killing
[56:39] the influence of Christ in our
[56:41] children's lives that's why be careful
[56:44] when we get into that Spirit of
[56:46] Christmas because it's
[56:49] wrong teach your children Christ because
[56:53] she's sitting there seeing all the kids
[56:55] getting gifts
[56:56] and she's getting excited where's my
[56:58] gift and she's missing the whole point
[57:00] of Christmas and then she goes to the
[57:02] other children and say but Santa is not
[57:05] real you know that and they go yeah we
[57:07] know he's not real and then one day she
[57:09] goes but you know Jesus is real and they
[57:11] go nah he's not real either cuz if I
[57:13] can't see Santa climb through the
[57:14] chimney then I can't see
[57:17] Christ and our children face these
[57:21] battles so your house shouldn't be a
[57:23] house of this your house should be a
[57:26] house of this where where you actually
[57:29] bring your children into to the fear and
[57:31] admonition of Christ where you say this
[57:34] gift that was there there was a purpose
[57:36] for those gifts and these gifts that we
[57:39] give you here is because those Magi that
[57:42] came from there had three gifts very
[57:45] precious valuable gifts one was gold
[57:50] gold representing deity representing the
[57:53] crown of the
[57:54] king so when they when they chose the
[57:57] gifts they were going to give Christ it
[57:58] was going to it's going to Showcase what
[58:01] this king is going to do and each gift
[58:05] had a meaning it wasn't a sensible 25%
[58:08] off get your lawn mower gift it was a
[58:10] purposeful gift that was going to come
[58:12] and back up
[58:15] prophecy so that's where the gifts come
[58:17] in children the gifts meant something
[58:20] today's gifts don't mean anything oh
[58:23] Mommy Daddy loves you these gifts meant
[58:25] something something very very something
[58:28] very
[58:30] special and the frankincense is a
[58:33] perfume that he was crowned the king
[58:35] with a sweet smelling savior that was
[58:37] that perfume that when he when he comes
[58:41] is is the rose of Sharon the lily of the
[58:44] valley it means something it means
[58:46] Christ in my life it doesn't hurt me it
[58:48] gives me that perfume it gives me a a
[58:51] when when you pray you just Lord when
[58:53] his his presence comes it's different
[58:56] things change around you God becomes
[58:59] real because I can see him in the
[59:01] scriptures it's not just a a hazard gift
[59:05] it to me as a Believer it means
[59:07] something sometimes I I walk and there's
[59:10] a certain Tree in New Zealand I don't
[59:11] know which tree it is it's got a sweet
[59:14] smell to it and I walk and sometimes I
[59:18] get this smell and I smell it and it
[59:20] smells so nice I'm say Lord you must be
[59:23] close that's how much this means to me
[59:27] and countless times when I walk past
[59:29] this thing I always try to see what tree
[59:31] it is but you know what the more I walk
[59:34] with God the more I know it's
[59:36] him I don't care what tree gives of what
[59:38] flavor that that smell is a different
[59:41] smell that's my Christ walking with me
[59:44] that's how much this gospel mean that's
[59:46] how real it is don't make it a bunch of
[59:49] stories and fairy tales and the myr was
[59:52] the bitterness it's a herb and it is
[59:55] must he must die for me and you so see
[59:59] when these Magi came 4,500 km away 2
[1:00:04] years of
[1:00:05] traveling all they had to give him is to
[1:00:08] say that this is more than just a
[1:00:10] story this is
[1:00:13] reality and as much as Herod tried to
[1:00:15] stop it and as much as everybody else
[1:00:17] was in their way the desert the storm
[1:00:19] the weather I tell you no matter what is
[1:00:22] in your way keep pushing on Till You Get
[1:00:26] to Christ amen don't give up children
[1:00:29] ever don't let Santa Claus ever become
[1:00:33] between you and Christ don't let any
[1:00:36] superhero or any any celebrity or
[1:00:39] anything any makeup Queen and all those
[1:00:42] type of things don't let it come between
[1:00:44] you and Christ there is much more real
[1:00:47] in Christ that you would ever get in the
[1:00:49] fake out
[1:00:51] there that is my heart's desire for
[1:00:53] Christmas may you see that that when
[1:00:55] Christ Christ came this baby was
[1:01:00] born this baby was born with a
[1:01:04] purpose and the world's trying to strip
[1:01:07] that away from us and our
[1:01:09] children and once you come into the
[1:01:12] presence of the almighty God you change
[1:01:16] and some days you feel like deity and
[1:01:19] some days you smell really good and you
[1:01:20] feel like you're all good and some days
[1:01:23] it is better but but guess what it is
[1:01:27] worth every little bit of it amen that's
[1:01:31] Christmas don't don't miss Christmas
