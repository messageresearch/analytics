[0:00] [Music]
[0:06] so
[0:08] [Music]
[2:47] amen
[2:48] hey bless you saints welcome to the
[2:50] house of the lord
[2:52] it's
[2:53] another wednesday and we made it
[2:56] we're here
[2:59] a bit of a testimony it's quite nice
[3:01] that
[3:02] because we have less less times that we
[3:04] could be at church you know the kids
[3:06] starts asking you know when is our turn
[3:09] you know when can we go again
[3:11] and it's good to see because um
[3:13] i think when i was a young man i would
[3:16] ask when can i not go again
[3:18] because when we were back in the world
[3:21] we thought church was boring because we
[3:23] never took the time to stop
[3:25] and to listen
[3:27] you know because our minds were going
[3:29] all over the show but we never actually
[3:30] just stop
[3:32] and listen
[3:33] because the bible says he that have an
[3:36] ear led him here
[3:38] so sometimes we can be here and we can
[3:39] be miles away
[3:41] already doing tomorrow's chores and
[3:42] yesterday's things we could do better
[3:44] but why don't we just stop tonight
[3:47] and we listen
[3:48] i believe the lord has something special
[3:50] for us tonight brother anyas is going to
[3:52] be ministering for us tonight
[3:54] and
[3:55] i'm sure coming with a great expectation
[3:57] because
[3:58] what can the lord do what can the law do
[4:01] for us tonight
[4:02] so if you all just want to stand let's
[4:04] just open in a word of prayer and i'm
[4:06] going to invite two young
[4:08] men forward liam maybe you come forward
[4:10] as well
[4:13] ask them to come and sing a song with me
[4:14] come forward
[4:16] [Music]
[4:18] and they will just open their in the
[4:19] word of prayer
[4:23] [Music]
[4:29] gracious heavenly father
[4:31] oh it's wonderful lord to know that
[4:33] tonight we've come once more
[4:36] to hear those words of eternal life
[4:38] the encouragement lord and helping us to
[4:42] heal
[4:43] lord to surrender ourselves to learn
[4:45] more about you to understand your ways a
[4:47] bit better
[4:49] to understand ourselves a bit better
[4:50] lord jesus
[4:52] speaking to my dad this week
[4:54] it's a wonderful how we can
[4:56] make your example lord
[4:59] if we read the new testament lord and
[5:02] even the old testament that's the shadow
[5:03] of the new
[5:05] it just shows us so clearly lord that we
[5:07] can overcome
[5:09] if we just give chance lord that you
[5:10] would do the work through us the greater
[5:12] work
[5:13] lord and as we all come together tonight
[5:15] we ask lord they'll be here with us
[5:17] we're going to come here for no other
[5:19] reason than you
[5:21] it would be very disappointing lord if
[5:23] we came for any other reason because
[5:26] when you're here lord it's when things
[5:28] change when you speak to us then things
[5:30] change
[5:31] lord it just takes that one moment in
[5:33] the presence of god to throw away a
[5:35] complex to receive my healing lord to go
[5:38] a little bit more further with you lord
[5:40] jesus
[5:41] so i ask lord as you pass this way
[5:44] please don't pass us by
[5:46] just come and speak to me personally
[5:49] lord speak to every believer here lord
[5:51] everyone on the internet lord
[5:53] go speak to them father lord make it so
[5:56] real knock on their door call upon their
[5:58] hearts lord and lord whatever is
[6:01] in the way of you and us
[6:04] clear every channel in the name of jesus
[6:06] christ clear everything lord jesus may
[6:09] this next hour
[6:11] just be for you lord for your kingdom i
[6:14] asked lord if there is any spirit that
[6:15] came in this place
[6:17] lord that's against your contrary to
[6:18] your holy spirit
[6:20] lord that you would just cast that out
[6:22] in the name of jesus christ the name
[6:24] above all names lord and we ask that
[6:26] we'll have a clear understanding of
[6:28] what's coming over the pulpit and lord
[6:30] that you would reveal it to us because
[6:32] we know it's all about revelation
[6:34] so as we dedicate these songs to you
[6:36] lord jesus we welcome you in as we sit
[6:39] here tonight to listen lord you anoint
[6:41] the speaker you anoint the hearer lord
[6:44] so that we can just push this battle
[6:46] just that one little bit more step
[6:47] forward lord so we can go home one of
[6:50] these days lord we know there's still
[6:52] work to be done because we're still here
[6:54] so we ask lord teach us your ways in the
[6:57] name of our lord jesus christ amen
[7:01] amen
[7:02] these young men are so very much they
[7:04] want to do
[7:05] to just be here tonight so i thought
[7:07] we're going to sing a song together
[7:09] so
[7:10] if you can just put that song up for us
[7:12] god is good
[7:14] all the time who knows the song
[7:17] we want to do it a little bit faster
[7:18] like
[7:19] god is good
[7:21] we're going to do it so let's go to um
[7:24] we'll start it slow like we always do it
[7:26] i think we're going to go into the nice
[7:27] fast rhythm
[7:29] george you know that one g for real
[7:31] oh we can do it in d let's go to d
[7:34] [Music]
[7:37] god is good
[7:40] all the time

[10:02] all the time
[10:08] of course we were sinners
[10:11] it's so unworthy
[10:14] and still for us he chose to die
[10:20] he filled me with
[10:23] his holy spirit
[10:26] now i can stand and
[10:44] god
[10:48] [Music]
[10:55] amen oh god is
[11:05] his life will shine god is
[11:14] all the time
[11:16] we were sinners
[11:18] remember where we came from we were
[11:21] [Music]
[11:22] yet so unworthy
[11:25] and still for us he chose to die
[11:30] what did he do he filled us with amen
[11:34] his holy spirit
[11:37] now we can stand
[11:45] [Music]
[11:51] [Music]
[11:52] [Applause]
[11:58] all the time
[12:06] [Music]
[12:12] [Music]
[12:18] is
[12:27] [Music]
[12:36] they should have been nervous mike's
[12:38] will speak
[12:41] it is wonderful to see young people
[12:43] wanting to sing for the lord
[12:45] and not scared to come to the front and
[12:47] sing the reason
[12:48] sometimes you do those things is you
[12:50] want to be out of your comfort zone
[12:52] that's where god works with you
[12:54] when you really get past yourself and
[12:56] you're at that place where you're very
[12:57] uncomfortable and very unsure that's
[13:00] usually where god gets you and then he
[13:02] trains you teach you lifts you up and
[13:05] put you where you belong
[13:07] amen that's how i basically got songs
[13:09] singing
[13:11] a bit of a testimony
[13:13] that musicians didn't show up on
[13:15] wednesday and i got get in the guitar
[13:17] and say let's sing some songs
[13:19] and if you would ask me back then would
[13:21] i ever want a song lead again after that
[13:23] one session i would have gone
[13:25] no way it went that bad
[13:28] but praise the lord i'm still here and i
[13:30] figured out that it's actually when you
[13:32] come and stand here in the front the
[13:33] hardest work is you guys having to work
[13:35] and not us because we just start singing
[13:38] the song and you have to help us to sing
[13:40] it right
[13:41] so the preacher's off and now i can just
[13:44] sing for the lord and it's just all
[13:45] wonderful right amen we're all for real
[13:48] life people
[13:49] that love god
[13:50] amen
[13:51] let's sing the song because there is
[13:54] power in the blood who believes it
[13:57] when everything goes wrong all your sin
[13:59] throw it in the blood if you think you
[14:01] can't get through the next thing it's in
[14:03] the blood you have to remember that
[14:05] jesus christ paid that price
[14:08] so that you could use the blood
[14:10] that actually arrives
[14:12] but it's true
[14:13] he paid the price
[14:15] so that you can use it to overcome
[14:18] amen that's what this message is about
[14:20] is our lord jesus
[14:24] are we gonna need this one a bit faster
[14:26] sister
[14:27] i wonder
[14:28] there is power
[14:49] oh
[15:19] amen
[15:48] [Music]
[15:52] land
[15:57] [Music]
[16:04] is
[16:05] [Music]
[16:14] is
[16:31] [Music]
[16:34] blood of the land
[16:38] and would you be whiter amen i want to
[16:42] be whiter than snow
[16:44] this flower in his blood
[16:47] now we're in the blood
[16:49] [Music]
[17:00] our
[17:16] in the pressure blood of the lamb amen
[17:20] let's do service
[17:22] would you do service for jesus our king
[17:26] amen
[17:27] [Music]
[17:28] [Applause]
[17:29] oh yes there's power in the blood
[17:32] and would you live daily
[17:35] praises to sing
[17:38] this wonderful power in the
[17:42] blood there is power
[17:46] [Music]
[17:54] [Applause]
[17:59] in the pressures let's see that last one
[18:02] again would you do service
[18:05] say i would do service for jesus my king
[18:10] cause there's power in the blood
[18:13] power in the blood
[18:16] and i will live daily he's praises to
[18:20] see
[18:21] cause this wonderful power in his blood
[18:26] oh there is
[18:34] [Music]
[18:52] bow
[18:55] [Music]
[19:02] [Music]
[19:06] in the precious
[19:13] amen
[19:15] [Music]
[19:17] can take the unclean and make them clean
[19:20] the center make you a sight
[19:22] amen the last will be found
[19:24] we can go forever the weak will be
[19:26] strong amen amen
[19:30] [Music]
[19:32] and that's why
[19:34] let's go to the next one let's let's
[19:36] keep that one this is
[19:43] [Music]
[19:49] standing on the promises
[19:52] so with his power you see this power in
[19:54] the blood and there's a reason why we
[19:55] sing these songs like that they need
[19:57] with all these promises of healing
[19:59] forgiveness fruits of the spirit all the
[20:02] inheritance that we have in the land is
[20:04] now put in the book now you can claim it
[20:06] now
[20:08] but see you have to claim it
[20:10] because we say standing on the promises
[20:12] of christ my king but you can only stand
[20:14] on it when you claim it so remember with
[20:17] the gold rush when they were running
[20:18] brother on your side sorry but when they
[20:20] when they they used to go with the big
[20:22] gold rush they would send the guys out
[20:24] and you could claim your land because
[20:26] it's all open land and there where you
[20:28] stake your claim that's yours but you
[20:30] had to go and stake your claim
[20:32] so when you sing these songs don't just
[20:34] say i'm standing on the promises but
[20:36] you're not on it if you say i'm standing
[20:37] on the promise of healing then you stand
[20:39] on it if you're standing on the promise
[20:41] of my family will be delivered then you
[20:43] stand on it
[20:45] you don't stand backwards you put the
[20:46] claim there now god will come back and
[20:49] he will come and back that promise so
[20:51] when you sing this song and you say
[20:53] anything that you stand on the promise
[20:55] that god gave in the bible mean it and
[20:57] sing it
[20:58] these songs are not just songs for us to
[21:00] sing to get us all just in the spirit
[21:02] they are testimonies of what believers
[21:04] went through
[21:05] so if you sing it any other way you do
[21:07] yourself from great injustice because
[21:09] you're not reading what it's saying
[21:11] amen
[21:13] [Music]
[21:19] standing on the promises of christ my
[21:24] king
[21:26] through eternal ages let his praises
[21:30] free
[21:32] oh glory in the highest i will shout and
[21:37] sing cause i'm standing on the promises
[21:41] of god

[22:19] howling storms of doubt and fear

[22:32] promises of god

[34:18] and moses answered and said but behold
[34:21] they will not believe me no hacking unto
[34:24] my voice for they will say the lord has
[34:27] not appeared unto thee
[34:29] and the lord said unto him
[34:31] what is that in thine hand
[34:35] so moses was already holding something
[34:37] in his hand and now god is asking moses
[34:40] what is that in thy hand
[34:43] and he said aaron
[34:45] and he said cast it on the ground and he
[34:48] cast it on the ground and it became a
[34:51] second and moses fled from before it and
[34:55] the lord said unto moses put forth thine
[34:57] hand and take it by the tail and he put
[35:00] forth his hand and caught it and became
[35:02] a road in his hand
[35:04] that they may believe that the lord god
[35:07] of their fathers the god of abraham the
[35:09] god of isaac and the god of jacob has
[35:12] appeared unto thee
[35:14] and the lord said furthermore unto him
[35:17] put now thine hand into thy bosom and he
[35:19] put his hand into his bosom and when he
[35:22] took it out behold his hand was left
[35:24] processed snow and he said put thine
[35:27] hand into thy bosom again
[35:29] and he put his hand into his bosom again
[35:32] and plucked it out of his bosom and
[35:34] behold it was turned against his other
[35:36] flesh
[35:37] and it shall come to pass
[35:40] if they will not believe thee
[35:42] neither happened to the voice of the
[35:43] first sign that they will believe the
[35:45] voice of the letter sign
[35:47] you may take your seats
[35:50] now i'm looking at this man called moses
[35:54] now have you ever thought about this
[35:56] road that moses was using
[35:58] was it a special road did it really look
[36:01] special it was just a road
[36:03] so one time when he was out there
[36:05] heading sheep because that is what moses
[36:07] had been reduced to
[36:09] this is the man who was going to be a
[36:10] prince in egypt
[36:12] and he ran away from egypt and it says
[36:15] prabraham says it took god 40 years
[36:18] to to to take away all the knowledge
[36:20] from moses
[36:22] moses was going to be a great scientist
[36:24] he was a general they taught him
[36:25] everything because he was going to be
[36:27] the next pharaoh now it took god 40
[36:30] years to take away all the equations
[36:32] from moses
[36:33] until he didn't understand what
[36:35] chemistry hydrogen and oxygen he forgot
[36:38] about it totally
[36:39] god put him in the back side where all
[36:41] he knew was counting sheep oh i had the
[36:44] 200 sheep here
[36:46] what happened to the other one
[36:48] his feet were no longer smooth because
[36:50] moses used to be washed by maidens
[36:54] yeah he didn't wash himself
[36:56] when he went into the tub there were
[36:57] some maidens that were washing him they
[37:00] wouldn't let him do anything because he
[37:01] was going to be a prince
[37:03] now look at moses now his feet are all
[37:06] cracked now his feet are all
[37:09] cracked
[37:10] oh he knows how to wear his sandals now
[37:13] no perfume no deodorants now and his
[37:16] beard is grown like that this is the man
[37:19] who was going to be a pharaoh in egypt
[37:21] so he has been reduced to forget about
[37:24] everything else
[37:25] and he said this is my life i got my
[37:28] wife he started even enjoying the desert
[37:31] the dust of the desert right and one day
[37:34] he was just moving about and he picked
[37:36] this road just on the ground
[37:38] it was just like another road there was
[37:40] nothing special about it
[37:42] then one day he missed jehovah he had
[37:45] heard about this god before
[37:47] and he would see this fire come down and
[37:50] go on the mountain what's really
[37:52] happening here
[37:53] but he never got close to the fire he's
[37:55] too dead a distance until one day he
[37:58] says no i really want to see what is
[37:59] going on there
[38:01] so he got closer and closer something
[38:04] kept telling me i want to find out
[38:05] what's happening ah
[38:07] there's a fire but it's not burning
[38:10] it's a fire that's been but there's no
[38:12] smoke what kind of a fire is this
[38:15] then a voice came from that fire moses
[38:18] moses
[38:20] who are you
[38:21] try to put yourself in his condition he
[38:23] was scared where is this voice coming
[38:25] from he looked for the man who was
[38:27] speaking he couldn't see the man
[38:29] but the voice sounded like a man but
[38:31] where is the man
[38:34] and now that voice
[38:36] who has just said i am your god i am
[38:39] jehovah he asks moses now moses
[38:43] what is that in thy hand and moses is a
[38:45] rod
[38:47] now moses was surprised
[38:49] can you not see that i'm carrying a road
[38:51] what is this got to do with going to
[38:53] egypt
[38:54] yeah it's a road
[38:56] it's just a stick that i picked some
[38:58] years ago and i'm using for ship and
[39:00] said now throw that road on the ground
[39:03] now can you imagine
[39:05] this road that moses has been using all
[39:07] these years
[39:08] suddenly turns into a big do you think
[39:11] it was a small snake
[39:13] you really think it was a small green
[39:15] snake
[39:16] that was screamed and ran from no this
[39:18] was a thick viper
[39:21] and this viper raised his head and
[39:22] looked at moses and moses screamed he
[39:25] said hey
[39:26] this voice wants me to be killed by this
[39:28] how can my road the road i've been
[39:30] carrying is now turned into a snake no
[39:32] no no no
[39:34] and the voice didn't let moses go he
[39:36] thought no he says touch
[39:39] what you want me to hold and this neck
[39:41] was not making it easy
[39:43] do you think the snake was looking away
[39:45] and running away no
[39:47] the snake raised his head and it was
[39:49] looking at moses
[39:50] and the voice said go
[39:52] touch the tail
[39:54] he please please please do i need to do
[39:58] this
[39:59] please i'm just a sheep header
[40:02] i'm just a sheephead i've got nothing to
[40:04] do with egypt
[40:05] i ran away from egypt and i've got
[40:07] nothing to do with egypt touch the tail
[40:11] oh god so you tried
[40:14] and snick
[40:16] he tried until
[40:17] somebody said no i'll do it anyhow he
[40:21] grabbed the tail
[40:23] ah and then it changed back into into
[40:26] the same road
[40:29] what's happening here
[40:30] this is supernatural it's like what you
[40:33] said brother a man
[40:35] moses was no longer in his comfort zone
[40:38] i've never come this far
[40:41] something's happening here
[40:43] something's happening here says yeah did
[40:46] you see what has happened
[40:48] your road is now turned into
[40:50] back
[40:52] that snake so it's a road is there
[40:55] anything special about this road no it's
[40:56] just the same road i've been using all
[40:58] this time
[40:59] so you see what was in the road you were
[41:01] carrying all the time now your road has
[41:04] come become a snake and it is turned
[41:06] back into the original do you want
[41:08] another sign moses
[41:10] so right there moses was starting to
[41:13] believe
[41:14] moses was starting to
[41:16] believe this was a road he had been
[41:19] caring all the time nothing special
[41:21] about this road it's just like another
[41:23] road this one only became special
[41:26] because that was the road that moses was
[41:28] carrying at that particular
[41:30] time
[41:32] that was the road that was in his hand
[41:35] and now god is using that road that is
[41:38] in your
[41:39] hand
[41:40] [Music]
[41:41] you want another sign moses see we
[41:44] wondered now so okay
[41:46] it was a road i'm not carrying anything
[41:48] else
[41:50] so what is he gonna use now see now take
[41:52] your hand now
[41:54] take your hand and put it under your
[41:56] armpit
[41:58] okay i'll do it
[41:59] moses did it take it out the end was
[42:02] diseased now full of wounds
[42:05] where did these wounds come from he says
[42:07] what do you see moses
[42:09] my hand is now disease says take it back
[42:12] put it back in your armpit
[42:14] you put it back in his armpit take it
[42:16] out moses moses took it out what's
[42:19] happened moses and the same hand
[42:22] he was born with that hand
[42:24] moses was not a so he actually
[42:27] grew up with his own hand
[42:29] when he was small his hand was small
[42:32] when he was 10 years old his hand was 10
[42:34] years old when he was 20 years old his
[42:37] hand was 20 years if there were scars
[42:40] he knew his hand because it was his hand
[42:43] now that hand that he had put it under
[42:46] your armpit
[42:48] god didn't say zip your wife's hand no
[42:51] your hand put it under your armpit and
[42:54] tell me what's happening
[42:56] i see wounds now take it back it's clean
[43:00] so do you want any other signs moses no
[43:03] no no
[43:04] no i'm not gonna try you i've never seen
[43:06] my own road
[43:08] i always thought this road was just for
[43:10] sheep now this road only saturn has
[43:12] become a snake so you see now when you
[43:15] go before pharaoh
[43:17] now go back now to pharaoh i've given
[43:20] you the signs now go use those signs and
[43:23] pharaoh is going to believe you so if
[43:26] you ever watched
[43:28] the film 10 commandments the movie
[43:30] when moses went up the mountain he was
[43:33] just the man that his wife knew
[43:35] but when he walked back home
[43:38] his hair he turned white
[43:40] he was walking like a man in a dream
[43:43] he was just walking like that
[43:45] and the wife was saying hey what
[43:47] happened to my husband he was looking at
[43:49] him but it was like he was looking
[43:51] through here
[43:52] because all he could see was that fire
[43:55] all he could hear was that voice
[43:58] so him even the children were running to
[44:01] death and say hey something has changed
[44:03] it's still dead but
[44:04] what has happened to him he's walking
[44:06] different
[44:08] he was now anointed
[44:10] with what he has seen
[44:12] that experience changed moses
[44:15] this this is not just a road he started
[44:18] respecting that road where he used to go
[44:20] home because he's tired and hungry after
[44:23] a long day of heading sheep he would
[44:25] just throw that road away but this time
[44:28] he didn't just throw it away it became a
[44:30] special rod
[44:32] the children were trying to play with
[44:33] through no no no no no no what is
[44:35] happening to dad we have been playing
[44:36] with this no no no not this one
[44:39] and he put it against the wall the wife
[44:41] tried to say no but no no no no leave it
[44:44] it has to stay there
[44:46] what really happened there
[44:48] we are going back to egypt we are going
[44:50] back to egypt are you serious i'm not
[44:52] going back to egypt i am not going back
[44:55] to egypt they are looking for you you
[44:57] are made out of they are looking for you
[44:58] you are wanted man
[45:00] we are going back to egypt
[45:03] we are going back to it there was no
[45:08] and there's no argument about it
[45:11] moses is saying
[45:12] you are my wife children get the
[45:14] children in order we are going back to
[45:16] egypt
[45:18] we are going back to egypt
[45:20] how are we going back to egypt says god

[45:31] children of israel that superpower
[45:35] we are going they are going to be
[45:36] delivered by two signs yes
[45:39] they are going to be delivered by two
[45:41] signs
[45:42] before i go to the next one

[52:31] brother's home he was going to preach
[52:33] somewhere so this brother well they were
[52:35] fellowshipping says he's a businessman
[52:37] this brother this friend of mine is a
[52:39] businessman he's a civil engineer builds
[52:42] roads dams and all that
[52:44] he wasn't getting the orders but he had
[52:46] a desire to buy you know some trucks and
[52:49] whatever so he's just fellowshipping
[52:51] with this brother you know if really the
[52:53] business was picking up this is what i
[52:55] would really like you know to buy this
[52:57] but i've got no money
[52:59] he takes this brother to where he was
[53:01] preaching so when his brothers was
[53:03] preaching he just felt inspired
[53:06] he said brother so-and-so
[53:09] and he looked yes you brother come up
[53:12] here and get
[53:14] your truck
[53:17] that's in church come up and get your
[53:19] truck
[53:20] he doubt it come up and get my truck i
[53:23] think i told this brother that i've got
[53:26] no money in the bank how can i go there
[53:28] and get my truck
[53:30] then the brother won't let him go
[53:32] brother
[53:33] come up and get your truck until he
[53:36] failed no i just have to go
[53:38] but inside himself i said how do i get a
[53:41] truck no money in the bank and i've got
[53:44] no business so he went the brother just
[53:46] said
[53:47] receive your truck in the name of the
[53:49] lord right so the brother no prayer
[53:52] is just told come up and get your truck
[53:56] goes back home
[53:57] a few days later
[53:59] a company that sells brand new trucks
[54:02] phoned him

[54:06] we know your business man we've got some
[54:08] trucks that we are selling no no no no
[54:10] no no i don't even have money
[54:12] i don't even have money no no no no you
[54:15] don't have to pay us now
[54:17] all you do is just accept the truck then
[54:19] when you get the money whenever we're
[54:21] not giving you conditions you can pay us
[54:23] i am telling you there is absolutely no
[54:26] way now listen to what he's saying now
[54:29] you are now reducing your goal now

[55:10] here
[55:11] and he told me he didn't know where the
[55:13] money came from
[55:15] mysteriously he got that money
[55:18] because
[55:19] god has given you whatever you need
[55:23] but what's bothering you is your
[55:25] reasoning
[55:27] they advertise a job and they say they
[55:30] are looking for phd
[55:32] they are looking for phd did you know
[55:34] that some phds won't even apply for that
[55:37] job

[55:45] never got that far i don't even have the
[55:47] first degree how can i even think about
[55:49] a phd it's not for me

[56:26] i don't have a phd
[56:28] no tertiary qualification but i am
[56:31] interested

[56:59] really need
[57:00] hey
[57:01] this guy only did all levels
[57:04] did he really understand what we're
[57:06] looking for
[57:07] we said phd this is an older guy
[57:12] this is crazy man why can't people be
[57:14] serious
[57:15] let me read further what does he say
[57:17] about then now let's just call him
[57:20] just call him
[57:21] put you in your nice suit
[57:24] call you for interview miss so-and-so we
[57:26] are curious
[57:27] because we really said phd
[57:30] did you really read and understand what
[57:32] we said i did
[57:34] so then why did you apply
[57:37] because i know
[57:38] i can do the job
[57:41] i can do the job so it's not a problem
[57:43] how can you do you will train me
[57:46] you know exactly what it is you need so
[57:48] i'm sure you've got the means to train
[57:50] me to the standard that you want you
[57:52] will get it
[57:53] because you claimed it you want it so
[57:56] god now is challenged he wants to show
[57:58] that he's god
[58:00] but your fear is always getting in the
[58:02] way
[58:05] i want a child lord i want a child yes
[58:09] you want a child
[58:10] what are you doing about it
[58:13] start wearing the maternity clothes
[58:17] start wearing the maternity clothes
[58:20] that's your part
[58:22] yeah i want a child if you don't give me
[58:24] the child people are going to laugh at
[58:25] you because they know i go to church so
[58:28] i'm going to wear the maternity clothes
[58:30] if it gets to 10 months and 11 months
[58:32] and the child is not delivered then it's
[58:34] your fault
[58:35] i've got nothing to do with it i'm going
[58:37] to be declaring right now that i'm
[58:39] pregnant
[58:41] that's what is in your hands
[58:44] so show your faith
[58:46] show your faith
[58:49] we are not getting what we need not
[58:53] because god is refusing but because we
[58:56] don't believe what is in our hands
[58:58] what is in your hand today
[59:01] so that was moses
[59:02] i'll go to someone else here
[59:09] what is in your hand that spoken word
[59:11] notice moses said lord i can't go but
[59:15] god was determined he was going and he
[59:17] said moses
[59:19] you must go there's no negotiation about
[59:22] it
[59:23] there's no negotiation about it you must
[59:26] get what you want because you're a child
[59:28] of god
[59:28] what excuse do we have no to get what we
[59:31] want when we are children of god as god
[59:34] said no
[59:35] why are you here tonight
[59:37] there are so many places to go isn't it
[59:39] films
[59:42] a lot of films out there netflix is full
[59:44] of new films that you can be watching
[59:46] right now why are you here
[59:49] it's because you believe in god isn't it
[59:51] so put into the challenge show god your
[59:54] road i'm a believer look back at your
[59:57] life there are things that have happened
[59:59] in your life
[1:00:01] don't worry about the brother next door
[1:00:03] don't worry about this just look back at
[1:00:06] what god has done in your own life
[1:00:10] take time to look back but what happened
[1:00:12] that time when we know food in the house
[1:00:15] what happened that time when we needed
[1:00:17] this who did that that was god wasn't it
[1:00:20] so why am i doubting
[1:00:22] what's causing me to doubt
[1:00:24] what's causing me to doubt no no no from
[1:00:27] right now from right now i'm gonna start
[1:00:30] believing if you need it if you have a
[1:00:33] desire for something
[1:00:35] if you have a desire for something well
[1:00:38] if you married
[1:00:40] and you're desiring someone's wife
[1:00:43] that has got nothing to do with god
[1:00:46] but if your desire is noble
[1:00:49] god will say yes
[1:00:50] i want to challenge you tell me what you
[1:00:53] want
[1:00:54] and the bible even says ask for big
[1:00:57] things yes

[1:09:22] you acting in the house of god when you
[1:09:25] answered your prayer
[1:09:26] were you showing that things are hard
[1:09:29] did you come to the house of god and
[1:09:31] stand there you weren't even singing
[1:09:34] you were showing oh things are hard
[1:09:37] you were doing the devil a favor
[1:09:40] you know what you were doing you were
[1:09:42] telling the devil that your god is
[1:09:44] powerless
[1:09:46] your situation is so hard that you can't
[1:09:49] even sing in the house of god
[1:09:51] your situation is so hard i can't even

[1:10:54] and everything was against you did you
[1:10:57] know you were doing the devil a favor
[1:11:00] when you were supposed to stand and say
[1:11:02] no no no no no i'm a child of god
[1:11:06] i'm holding a road in my hand
[1:11:08] and this road here will give me all that
[1:11:11] i need the prophet says your situation
[1:11:14] is totally nothing to do
[1:11:18] the word of god is still the same
[1:11:23] i don't know about my time i don't want
[1:11:25] to get
[1:11:27] it so
[1:11:29] now
[1:11:31] i read this one here
[1:11:33] i was talking about he
[1:11:35] noticed moses said
[1:11:37] lord i can't go
[1:11:39] but god was determined that he was going
[1:11:41] and he said moses
[1:11:44] now put your name there
[1:11:46] put your name there instead of moses put
[1:11:49] your name mo
[1:11:51] you must go
[1:11:53] and he said show me your glory lord and
[1:11:57] notice god told moses what is that in
[1:12:00] your hand so god is asking you today
[1:12:05] you know what that man at the pool of
[1:12:07] besides he was full of excuses
[1:12:10] 38 years 38 years
[1:12:13] when you really look at it look he had
[1:12:16] come a long way isn't it
[1:12:18] here you look at it each time he jumps
[1:12:20] in the water someone has been there
[1:12:22] before him someone is healed but what
[1:12:25] caused that man to keep coming back
[1:12:27] here the right to have a grudge with god
[1:12:30] but you don't have a right to have a
[1:12:32] grudge
[1:12:33] he kept coming and others are praising
[1:12:35] god he comes he even pays money
[1:12:38] you know what what is going to happen is
[1:12:40] wealthy what i state young men please
[1:12:43] just push me in the water yeah so those
[1:12:46] people took the money by the time they
[1:12:48] pushed him in someone was there already
[1:12:52] i got no one in the world i've got no
[1:12:54] friends no friends he had no relatives
[1:12:57] it was just him alone but come next year
[1:13:00] the man is back again he's back again
[1:13:03] you know what he had in his hands
[1:13:05] faith
[1:13:06] that faith would not keep him still but
[1:13:09] i've seen people healed i'll keep going
[1:13:13] and notice god told moses what is that
[1:13:16] in your hand he said it's a stick or a
[1:13:19] rod just an old dry stick of the desert
[1:13:22] where he'd walked along with it in his
[1:13:24] end
[1:13:25] that may be all that he had was a stick
[1:13:29] maybe you you even
[1:13:31] you maybe you haven't even got that much
[1:13:35] but whatever you got
[1:13:37] give it to god
[1:13:38] what do you have tonight
[1:13:41] if you got faith
[1:13:42] give it to god
[1:13:44] he says whatever you got
[1:13:47] give it to
[1:13:49] that's what he's going to work with
[1:13:51] god is going to work with your situation
[1:13:54] so whatever it is give it to god look
[1:13:58] what he did with that stick why
[1:14:02] what was in his hand
[1:14:04] a slingshot but god was with him that's
[1:14:08] the main thing is god with you tonight
[1:14:11] he's with you that's why you are here
[1:14:13] because you believe in his so don't
[1:14:16] listen to that voice of doubt say i'm a
[1:14:19] child of god
[1:14:20] yes from today i am not going to doubt
[1:14:24] each time you pull out the spoken words
[1:14:26] from the archives you are fitting on
[1:14:29] them your faith is rising your faith is
[1:14:32] positioning you to claim what you need
[1:14:37] that's the main thing whether you got a
[1:14:40] bachelor's degree
[1:14:42] or a degree of art
[1:14:44] or whatever you got
[1:14:47] if you got christ in you what difference
[1:14:50] does it matter
[1:14:51] so whether you are educated tonight
[1:14:55] whether you're undereducated
[1:14:57] the kingdom of god has got nothing to do
[1:14:59] with your education
[1:15:02] so don't go about if you're having a
[1:15:04] long face
[1:15:05] i don't have a degree i i can't get you
[1:15:08] know a brother is being so blessed so
[1:15:10] much because he's got a degree he is
[1:15:13] using he is believing in what he is in
[1:15:16] his hand he has a degree and he is using
[1:15:19] the degree what do you have in your hand
[1:15:22] that's what you use
[1:15:24] use what you have in your hand but you
[1:15:26] have to believe in what you have in your
[1:15:28] hand
[1:15:30] whether you know your abc's or whatever
[1:15:33] you do know as long as you know jesus
[1:15:36] christ in the power of his resurrection
[1:15:40] do you know jesus christ in the power of
[1:15:42] his resurrection tonight
[1:15:45] that's what you have to know
[1:15:51] second kings chapter 4 verse 1-7 now
[1:15:55] there cried a certain woman of the wives
[1:15:57] of the sons of the prophets unto elisha
[1:16:00] saying
[1:16:01] thy servant my husband is dead and thou
[1:16:04] knowest that thy seven did fear the lord
[1:16:06] so the good thing here is that this man
[1:16:11] feared the lord
[1:16:12] but he is a situation where he left a
[1:16:15] wife there's nothing in the house no
[1:16:17] pension no savings
[1:16:19] she was destitute
[1:16:21] now you know what happened the creditor
[1:16:23] came
[1:16:25] he tried he looked around no cause
[1:16:27] nothing nothing nothing until he was
[1:16:29] taking the children can you imagine
[1:16:31] the creditor now you are so poor now
[1:16:34] that the creditor is taking your
[1:16:36] children to work for him
[1:16:39] to pay off your husband's debt
[1:16:43] and elisha said unto her now
[1:16:46] remember where did she go
[1:16:50] where did she go
[1:16:52] social welfare was there but maybe it
[1:16:55] was tired now
[1:16:56] mom we helped you last time no we can't
[1:16:59] anymore we go to other people also to
[1:17:01] help
[1:17:02] but the children there's no no no no we
[1:17:04] can't do this anymore so the doors were
[1:17:06] closed
[1:17:07] but there was a prophet in the land
[1:17:11] there was a prophet in the land
[1:17:14] isn't there a prophet in the land today
[1:17:18] who is william branham to you
[1:17:21] isn't there prophet in the land today
[1:17:24] isn't there the word today
[1:17:26] what did he tell you
[1:17:29] feed on the spoken word
[1:17:31] keep listening to those steps
[1:17:33] keep reading keep feeding on them you
[1:17:36] will get your rapturing faith from them
[1:17:38] so do what the word says
[1:17:42] so the prophet says unto this woman what
[1:17:44] shall i do for thee tell me
[1:17:47] what is thou in the house
[1:17:50] what do you have in the house what do
[1:17:52] you have in your hands
[1:17:54] and she said thine handmaid has not
[1:17:56] anything in the house save a pot of oil
[1:18:02] so all she had in the house was a pot
[1:18:05] off now do you think it was a big pot
[1:18:08] do you think that pot was full of oil
[1:18:11] no maybe she had actually borrowed from
[1:18:13] a neighbor
[1:18:14] and the neighbor said we are we are
[1:18:16] tired of this each time you are begging
[1:18:19] a big that's not your husband should
[1:18:21] have solved his problems
[1:18:23] queer can't look after you we are not
[1:18:24] related to you
[1:18:26] she was begging for food says all i have
[1:18:29] in the house
[1:18:31] is a pot of
[1:18:33] then elisha said go borrow the vessels
[1:18:37] abroad of all thy neighbors even empty
[1:18:41] bottles borrow not a few
[1:18:44] so
[1:18:45] there is nothing in the house just
[1:18:48] a pot of oil
[1:18:49] and your situation is what god is going
[1:18:52] to use to bless you
[1:18:54] you are busy complaining i shouldn't be
[1:18:56] in this situation but that's exactly
[1:18:58] what god is going to use to bless you
[1:19:01] so those empty vessels now the prophet
[1:19:03] now says go borrow empty vessels go
[1:19:06] borrow empty vessels
[1:19:10] your solution is in your empty vessels
[1:19:13] because that is what you have oh i don't
[1:19:15] have any education it doesn't matter god
[1:19:17] is going to use that lack of education
[1:19:20] to show that is god oh i'm a god
[1:19:23] is going to use your situation to show
[1:19:26] that he's god
[1:19:27] go borrow empty vessels and borrow not a
[1:19:30] few
[1:19:32] told the children we have to borrow
[1:19:33] empty vessels they've got tired
[1:19:36] went to this one are you using your drum
[1:19:38] oh you can't have it you can they
[1:19:40] started laughing at hands followed
[1:19:42] everything put out everything until
[1:19:44] don't stop
[1:19:46] you don't believe faith is not going to
[1:19:48] let you rest faith is going to make you
[1:19:51] claim more and more
[1:19:54] faith doesn't claim a small hill when
[1:19:56] there's a mountain
[1:19:58] that's not faith you're doubting
[1:20:01] i want to give you a mountain no lord
[1:20:04] i'm just happy to have this small hill
[1:20:06] why can't you have a mountain i'm just
[1:20:08] happy to have a small hill
[1:20:12] what happens if god wants you to have a
[1:20:14] bus
[1:20:16] then you can take us to the convention
[1:20:18] can't you
[1:20:20] here

[1:21:00] why can't we have someone who can buy a
[1:21:02] jumbo jet here
[1:21:05] huh
[1:21:06] we are too used to standing in a queue
[1:21:09] when we are traveling somewhere oh you
[1:21:12] almost wish each time you go to the
[1:21:14] airport you are putting a queue
[1:21:16] sometimes they are cutting your bag to
[1:21:18] check for drugs hey
[1:21:20] to check for drugs in a suitcase of a
[1:21:22] child of god
[1:21:24] you are being reduced
[1:21:26] a dog is following me
[1:21:30] because you are being mistaken for a
[1:21:32] drug trafficker
[1:21:33] when you're a child of god no lord we
[1:21:36] are tired of this
[1:21:37] we tired of this we want our own planes
[1:21:40] brethren i've just bought a plane
[1:21:43] it carries 300 so we need nums don't
[1:21:45] worry i'll put the bill for the fuel we
[1:21:48] just want numbers we have our convention
[1:21:50] and done it then so we're providing the
[1:21:52] transport
[1:21:54] my plan is to take you out there
[1:21:57] but do we want planes
[1:22:00] we are too used to these traffic
[1:22:02] congestions
[1:22:03] we almost pray that there are no traffic
[1:22:06] congestions but they will be there
[1:22:09] just come out of the house 10 minutes in
[1:22:11] the traffic condition
[1:22:17] and you are going to save your god
[1:22:20] you are going to save your
[1:22:22] and the unbelievers do you know what
[1:22:24] happened with this coffee deal
[1:22:27] the unbelievers were buying planes
[1:22:30] yeah they've never had this so good
[1:22:32] buying planes they said no we're not
[1:22:34] staying in a queue
[1:22:36] i just get aboard my plane
[1:22:40] so while we are cutting these cues
[1:22:42] the unbelievers are enjoying themselves
[1:22:45] and now when we take the word to them
[1:22:47] they think we want their money
[1:22:50] they think we want there
[1:22:52] i don't think they it's really they want
[1:22:54] my money
[1:22:55] they want to take my money
[1:22:58] so we want to claim
[1:22:59] there's nothing wrong with claiming for
[1:23:01] a plane
[1:23:02] i'm not here to tell you to claim a
[1:23:04] plane if you don't never want to take
[1:23:06] play so don't take me wrong
[1:23:10] i'm just saying
[1:23:12] don't limit your faith
[1:23:14] because
[1:23:15] it's right there in your hands
[1:23:18] it's time to stop having excuses about
[1:23:21] our situation because the word tells us
[1:23:24] that our god is real
[1:23:27] our god is real he's more than able to
[1:23:29] grant us all that we need i'll just
[1:23:32] quickly read this here
[1:23:35] so i've already spoken about this man
[1:23:38] from the pool of the siddha all right
[1:23:43] now
[1:23:44] brother pranam this old man always
[1:23:46] touches me congressman i'm sure you know
[1:23:49] how long he was
[1:23:51] in a wheelchair
[1:23:52] 66 years 66 years hey
[1:23:57] that's not a joke
[1:23:59] in a wheelchair
[1:24:01] but the man never felt pity for himself
[1:24:05] he never felt pity for himself
[1:24:07] he was even a congressman
[1:24:09] in a wheelchair he was even a
[1:24:11] congressman
[1:24:13] no pity he went to oral roberts to be
[1:24:15] prayed for if meetings of healing he
[1:24:17] would go there why was god not allowing
[1:24:20] him to be healed
[1:24:21] so that we would learn from his faith
[1:24:24] he was holding on to his road
[1:24:27] he was holding on to his
[1:24:29] then one day someone told him there is a
[1:24:31] prophet in the land
[1:24:33] there is a man called william branham i
[1:24:36] want to go to that meeting
[1:24:38] i want to go to that meeting
[1:24:40] as i started to tend to the woman i
[1:24:43] looked going down across the audience
[1:24:45] and here went that old congressman
[1:24:48] this is from the spoken word has the
[1:24:50] lord spoken only to moses
[1:24:53] now he was dressed with a blue suit and
[1:24:55] a red tie on which if any of you know
[1:24:58] him that was his very way he liked to
[1:25:00] dress but this time he had on a brown
[1:25:03] suit light brown with a white stripe in
[1:25:05] it and he had owned one of these heads
[1:25:07] like i wear frankly he is the one that
[1:25:10] sends them to me so he had one of those
[1:25:13] heads on southern head little stetson
[1:25:15] and he was going along tipping his head
[1:25:17] with this very southern hospitality you
[1:25:19] know tipping his head very gentlemen
[1:25:21] like going down the street like that
[1:25:23] walking down over the people so this is
[1:25:25] brother branham he's on the stage he's
[1:25:27] during a discernment praying for sick
[1:25:29] people and he sees this congressman who
[1:25:32] is in a wheelchair but he sees him
[1:25:36] walking over the people and tipping his
[1:25:38] head
[1:25:42] so
[1:25:43] and he said to him congressman
[1:25:46] yes my son he said do you own a teen
[1:25:49] striped suit he said i bought one three
[1:25:51] days ago and brother branham says god
[1:25:54] has honored your faith
[1:25:56] god has honored your
[1:25:58] faith
[1:25:59] rise up congressmen and receive your
[1:26:02] healing
[1:26:04] now if the congressman
[1:26:06] for 66 years was just
[1:26:09] complaining about god
[1:26:12] complaining you are a to begin
[1:26:15] with you need help
[1:26:17] but all you are doing about your
[1:26:19] situation is complaining to god
[1:26:22] why did you put me in this why did you
[1:26:24] put me in this wheelchair until the
[1:26:27] congressman was healed you know he lived
[1:26:29] for two years
[1:26:31] he lived 66 years in the wheelchair to
[1:26:35] be healed to live just for two years to
[1:26:37] testify to the whole world about the
[1:26:39] healing of god
[1:26:41] and he went before kings so these kings
[1:26:45] that did not believe the message of the
[1:26:47] hour on the day of judgment they will
[1:26:50] answer because god will say you know
[1:26:53] this man
[1:26:54] he was healed
[1:26:56] and he came to you king george he came
[1:26:58] to you you saw him standing after being
[1:27:00] in a wheelchair for 66 years why why
[1:27:03] didn't you believe
[1:27:06] why didn't you believe
[1:27:07] he knew all these big presidents and he
[1:27:10] went to them and they could see that man
[1:27:13] who was here crippled is now standing is
[1:27:16] healed what's our excuse today
[1:27:20] each time we look at the spoken word
[1:27:22] there's discernment
[1:27:25] there is discernment someone is being
[1:27:27] healed
[1:27:28] someone without eyes receiving his sight
[1:27:31] someone without faith working out with
[1:27:34] feet
[1:27:34] women without you every situation under
[1:27:37] the sun
[1:27:40] god dealt with it
[1:27:42] why
[1:27:43] so that today you know exactly who you
[1:27:45] are
[1:27:48] you know who you
[1:27:49] you are
[1:27:51] you stop wearing a long face in the
[1:27:53] house of god
[1:27:55] you start singing like you've never sung
[1:27:57] before
[1:27:59] you start this new experience like moses
[1:28:02] that road in your hands that faith that
[1:28:05] you have let me start doing wonders to
[1:28:08] you now
[1:28:09] don't pack it
[1:28:10] oh i believe in god
[1:28:12] i believe in god then why are you not
[1:28:14] testifying why are you not claiming what
[1:28:17] you want if you really believe in god
[1:28:19] why are you allowing the situation
[1:28:22] to put you where you are
[1:28:25] i came in this country two years ago on
[1:28:27] 18
[1:28:28] february
[1:28:30] so it's almost two years now
[1:28:35] exactly a year later
[1:28:37] i was operated on cancer why did it have
[1:28:39] to be 18.
[1:28:42] it could have been another debt
[1:28:45] but it was exactly the date i came into
[1:28:47] new zealand now exactly a year later
[1:28:50] cancer
[1:28:51] because god is telling me
[1:28:53] always remember i healed you of cancer
[1:28:56] and he gave me a sign
[1:28:59] he gave me a sign
[1:29:01] do you ever want to see the dove that
[1:29:03] came on my window it came it's no white
[1:29:05] dove i saw it
[1:29:07] it worked there it was looking at me it
[1:29:10] didn't fly away go to strike i've healed
[1:29:13] you i'll give you the sign
[1:29:15] i took it my wife and them they took the
[1:29:18] photos of that and they've got the
[1:29:19] videos of that
[1:29:22] so
[1:29:23] what happened to florence nightingale
[1:29:26] when brother branham went to england
[1:29:28] that woman who was dying of cancer that
[1:29:31] god is still alive
[1:29:34] that's why i didn't die then

[1:44:11] let's just all pray together tonight

[1:44:16] just forget about yourself now remember
[1:44:18] what brother anya said i don't i do
[1:44:20] believe it's not brother onions that
[1:44:21] said it so many times we sell ourselves
[1:44:25] short and we belittle our god and we
[1:44:28] have
[1:44:29] a wonderful god that is true and
[1:44:31] powerful
[1:44:33] and he's never lost a battle he's never
[1:44:35] failed and even when i was dark and in
[1:44:38] sin he still chose to came and give me
[1:44:41] another chance
[1:44:43] but see we belittle our god because we
[1:44:46] proclaim that we can't do it let's leave
[1:44:49] that now as we pray to god let's confess
[1:44:52] that he is worthy
[1:44:54] that he is faithful and that he can do
[1:44:58] whatever he can do because he's
[1:45:00] sovereign
[1:45:01] is almighty he can deliver the greatest
[1:45:04] sinner he can set free your brother he
[1:45:07] can help your sister he can heal cancer
[1:45:10] he can defeat death you ask lazarus
[1:45:14] you ask lazarus what happened that day
[1:45:17] he will testify that my god is greater
[1:45:20] than anything
[1:45:22] but what we do is we choose to listen to
[1:45:25] that bluff
[1:45:27] when the enemy comes in and says boo we
[1:45:30] listen to that book
[1:45:32] so i encourage you now
[1:45:34] ask for forgiveness
[1:45:36] ask the lord to forgive you for doubting
[1:45:39] for forgiving you for just thinking that
[1:45:42] he cannot do it
[1:45:44] nothing is impossible the prophet of god
[1:45:47] said all things are possible them that
[1:45:49] believe and what happened on that day is
[1:45:52] he said the angel of the lord said to
[1:45:54] the prophet he says if you can get the
[1:45:56] people to believe all things are
[1:45:58] possible
[1:46:00] so i encourage you now
[1:46:01] let's just pray together and ask our god
[1:46:04] to do the impossible
[1:46:06] amen and let's see how god would raise
[1:46:09] that standard
