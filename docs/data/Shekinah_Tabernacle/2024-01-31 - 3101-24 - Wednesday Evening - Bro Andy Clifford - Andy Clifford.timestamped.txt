[31:02] Lord we surrender to your power tonight
[31:05] we surrender to the force of

[31:20] Lord father that regardless of how deep
[31:24] and how complicated the trials or the
[31:27] over the the storm may be we believe
[31:30] Lord that you're here and father we're

[31:59] hallelujah amen while you're standing
[32:02] you know we're just going to speak a
[32:04] little bit tonight and just to encourage
[32:06] you before we pray Amen on the violent
[32:09] take the kingdom by force amen and this
[32:12] one's been sitting here for quite a
[32:14] while and it came on the radar so praise
[32:17] the Lord I believe that if you have a
[32:20] need tonight and you want to have
[32:23] something spiritual happen in your life
[32:25] then Paul Paul Have Faith H Allelujah do
[32:29] we have an expectation tonight for the

[32:34] would you invite the Lord to your Pew
[32:35] tonight amen amen invite the Lord to
[32:38] where you're at because he wants to meet
[32:40] your needs amen and so let's turn in our
[32:42] Bibles to Matthew 11:
[32:46] 12-4 and then we'll also go to Luke 10:
[32:50] 17-19
[32:52] hallelujah
[32:54] amen
[32:56] hallelujah
[32:57] oh praise God Amen Matthew 11:12 to13
[33:02] and I want you to think about
[33:05] this the heaven comes to break the
[33:08] status quo Hallelujah and Heaven comes
[33:12] with
[33:12] Force Hallelujah and the hell cannot
[33:15] Prevail against it nor can it withstand
[33:17] the force that heaven brings to break
[33:19] the status quo Hallelujah so it says
[33:22] here and from the days of John the
[33:24] Baptist until now the kingdom of heaven
[33:27] suffers violence and the violent take it
[33:30] by force for all the prophets and the
[33:33] law prophesied until John and if you
[33:36] will receive it this is Elijah which was
[33:40] for to come Amen in Luke 10: 17 to 19
[33:45] and I want you to just as we read this
[33:47] just remember Jesus gives the church
[33:50] power and he never took it away doesn't
[33:53] matter what history shows he never took
[33:56] the power away
[33:57] he never took it away from the church
[33:59] and the 70 returned again with Joy
[34:02] saying Lord even the devils are subject
[34:05] unto us through thy name and he said
[34:08] unto them I beheld Satan as lightning
[34:10] fall from Heaven behold I give unto you
[34:15] power to tread on serpents and scorpions
[34:19] and over all can everyone say all all
[34:23] the power of the enemy all the power of
[34:27] the
[34:27] enemy just let that be gospel tonight
[34:31] all the power of the enemy and nothing
[34:34] shall by any means hurt you Hallelujah
[34:39] you may be seated in the presence of the
[34:40] Lord tonight
[34:43] Hallelujah power that word
[34:46] power it means it comes from the word
[34:48] exusia which I would presume that that's
[34:51] where they get the word exorcize from
[34:53] which is an authority it's a privilege a
[34:55] force a capacity I give you
[34:59] privilege I give you force I give you
[35:04] capacity Hallelujah this is Jesus now
[35:06] giving the church right from the
[35:07] beginning is he the same tonight
[35:10] hallelujah amen are we are we getting
[35:12] prepared for prayer tonight Hallelujah
[35:14] have we come with an expectation that
[35:16] your prayer is going to break through
[35:18] tonight amen or have you just come to
[35:20] just pray and have another prayer
[35:22] meeting because I believe your
[35:23] expectation will be met and if you've
[35:25] come to and you purposed in your heart
[35:28] that tonight we break through tonight we
[35:30] pray through tonight we see change
[35:32] tonight we see material Miracles why
[35:34] because Jesus is the same yesterday
[35:36] today and forever power exusia I give
[35:39] you privilege he says I give the church
[35:41] privilege and I never take it I give the
[35:43] church Force I haven't taken it I give
[35:45] the church capacity competency Freedom

[38:09] we'll get into it soon how this violence
[38:11] manifests Hallelujah but what it means
[38:14] here is to urge to constrain overpower
[38:19] by force now remember it can be used for
[38:20] evil too and the evil one the devil uses
[38:23] it a lot and you'll see some
[38:25] similarities for how he treats people
[38:27] how he treats your children how he
[38:28] treats people that you know how he
[38:30] treats those people out there and
[38:32] sometimes how he treats you and tries to
[38:34] come against you just look at the

[39:18] Lord he will do impossible he's promised
[39:21] impossible feets in all of our Lives
[39:23] that's right impossible amen he likes to
[39:26] do it he enjoys it because what he wants

[39:38] violence Amen to to to press earnestly

[40:13] we're going to break through are we
[40:14] going to storm amen we've got needs oh
[40:18] my I believe you know as we get into
[40:20] this end time age the needs are
[40:22] impossible everything's just impossible
[40:24] but we serve an impossible making God
[40:27] hallelujah hallelujah the
[40:29] Lord maybe back in the days the trials
[40:32] wenten so hard but they're hard now and
[40:34] I'm not belittling the things that went
[40:35] on but remember the Bible says the
[40:37] devil's angry because he's got a little
[40:39] time left and our progress spiritual
[40:43] progress is his
[40:45] demise so you put those two things
[40:48] together and you realize that the devil
[40:50] doesn't want you to progress he going to
[40:52] do everything he can he going to put all
[40:53] the crosshairs on you and upon Israel
[40:56] because these two groups are the very
[40:57] two groups that is that are going to
[40:59] bring his demise cuz they fulfill
[41:07] prophecy the violent take the kingdom by
[41:09] F
[41:13] hallelujah hallelujah to to be an object
[41:17] of a forceful movement to force that is
[41:21] to crowd oneself or to be
[41:25] seized
[41:27] hallelujah amen I just want to what have
[41:29] I done
[41:32] here hallelujah Matthew 11 12
[41:35] to oh yeah I just did this one I just
[41:38] want you I want to read this in the
[41:39] basic Bible English version which is
[41:41] kind of like the um uh the more modern
[41:45] version um because actually the King
[41:48] James puts it in a way that makes it
[41:49] hard to understand and it actually even
[41:52] though both meanings actually mean it
[41:54] means both things because remember the
[41:56] devil just as much as you is fighting
[41:59] and he's got a force and he's trying to
[42:01] bring you down but you're going to bring
[42:03] him down right in your life and dayto
[42:05] day in the battles in the wars so just
[42:09] listen to this and from the days of John
[42:11] the Baptist till now the Kingdom of
[42:13] Heaven is forcing its way in and Men of
[42:18] force take
[42:19] it am I looking at men a force tonight
[42:22] are we men and women a force tonight
[42:25] real for recognize who's inside you and
[42:30] stand because what you cannot progress
[42:32] without the miracles of god there's no
[42:35] way forward without God's Miracles I
[42:38] know me and IA we trade in business we
[42:40] only can go forth with Miracles cuz the
[42:42] devil hates us and the devil hates you
[42:44] and he doesn't want you to progress in
[42:46] any
[42:47] realm he doesn't want you
[42:51] to he wants to beat you down until
[42:53] you're crumpled on the ground crying
[42:55] that's what what he wants and
[42:58] useless Hallelujah but God speaks a word
[43:01] over you oh my Lord God speaks a word
[43:04] over you to rise up my fair one and come
[43:07] away from all that look not to the
[43:09] former things that will crumple you down
[43:10] and beat you down in your mind and rise
[43:13] up in
[43:14] faith hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah
[43:18] do you know there's only one way forward
[43:20] tonight there's only one way forward for
[43:22] this time onwards from that time as the
[43:24] prophet preached from that time
[43:26] time
[43:28] violence
[43:30] War violence am battles War have you
[43:35] resolved yourself or are you wanting an
[43:38] easy time you wanting a comfortable
[43:41] layer to see in
[43:43] time because if that's your
[43:46] expectation you're not going to get very
[43:52] far
[43:55] Hallelujah be good
[43:58] Andy be
[44:00] good and from the days of John the
[44:02] Baptist till now the Kingdom of Heaven
[44:05] is forcing its way
[44:07] in Lord help me to not go too far right
[44:10] now see the the devil had it all sewn up
[44:13] didn't he 400 years since Malachi right
[44:16] and all that Babylonian religion had
[44:18] come through Judea religion and there
[44:21] was instead of priesthood there was
[44:22] there was Pharisees instead of the
[44:24] Tabernacle and the temple there were
[44:26] synagogues and it had become Babylonian
[44:29] it had become religious powerless and
[44:31] full of The Commandments of men it was
[44:33] religiously strong it was politically
[44:36] strong and it was under the bondage of
[44:38] Rome the devil thought I got this all
[44:40] sign up there's no way that a messiah
[44:42] can come in this
[44:44] situation oh my Lord that's what he
[44:47] thought he thought he got it all sewn
[44:53] up but God sent Elijah
[44:56] Hallelujah God sent the spirit of Elijah
[44:59] to interrupt the status quo to interrupt
[45:02] a powerful band of religious power of
[45:05] political power of Roman power all these
[45:08] powers to sww up the people and God sent
[45:11] the spirit of Elijah he said until the
[45:14] days of John the Baptist since that day
[45:16] the Kingdom of Heaven has forced its way
[45:19] into a place where the devil had it all
[45:21] sew up
[45:24] Hallelujah
[45:27] I asked you this question did it
[45:30] work the devil could not do it the devil
[45:33] did not have enough
[45:38] power did the Messiah come did he die on
[45:41] the cross for
[45:43] us was our sins paid for hallu was the
[45:47] Holy Ghost poured out on the church did
[45:49] the church have a book of Acts
[45:52] Hallelujah we rest our case
[45:57] Hallelujah that's why we can find rest
[46:00] Hallelujah in the word of God in the
[46:02] book of Acts we are a continuation of
[46:04] that book no different the only thing
[46:07] that's different is the seals are open
[46:10] because there's a people when I believe
[46:11] I'm looking at them and part of them
[46:13] that will not taste death and so the
[46:16] full search of your whole life all the
[46:18] way back to Adam everything that Adam
[46:20] lost has been searched over you so that
[46:22] the devil has nothing that he can accuse
[46:26] you of because of the blood and the
[46:29] opening of the word to fully absolve you
[46:32] and justify you from everything of the
[46:35] past look not to the former things
[46:38] neither consider the things of
[46:40] old whether it's good or
[46:44] bad cuz some of the things that you
[46:46] thought was good wasn't
[46:48] good and it will confuse you because why
[46:51] the revelation of Jesus Christ begins to
[46:53] progress in your life he is an Ever
[46:56] presentent God he is trying to make us
[46:58] eternally minded not past or future
[47:01] minded he wants you to exist in the
[47:03] moment so that you can Rejoice with him
[47:06] in the moment cuz he is the moment he is
[47:08] the I am he is the one that can bring
[47:11] the change now tonight you pray in the
[47:14] presence of the I am and not just you in
[47:16] his presence but he's in your presence
[47:20] amenah Hallelujah and if we continue
[47:23] dwelling on the past or the future we
[47:25] will be scrambled two minded and will
[47:27] get
[47:28] amnesia because the devil will get your
[47:31] imagination all anointed and your memory
[47:33] Channel all anointed cuz he's got an
[47:36] access into those
[47:38] Realms
[47:43] amen I just like that so
[47:46] much the Kingdom of Heaven is forcing
[47:49] its way in Oh Glory don't you feel the
[47:52] Kingdom of Heaven is forcing its way in
[47:54] to your life

[48:21] devil back from the devil you can snatch
[48:24] it back from him you can take it by

[48:33] enforcer of restoration to to cause
[48:36] restoration and make the devil give it
[48:39] back doesn't matter how much he's got a
[48:41] hold of it or how failure or wherever
[48:43] you're at the enforcer Hallelujah is not
[48:46] a respector of persons amen he's a
[48:49] respector of Faith yes sir faith in the
[48:53] promises of God faith in the divine
[48:56] Integrity that God swore by an oath that

[49:17] materialize and we're going to be
[49:19] conveyed away suddenly hallelujah amen

[49:58] gifts in my life what would it be is it
[50:02] knowing my purpose is it a powerful
[50:05] prayer life is it a conversation with
[50:08] god instead of just reading your Bible
[50:10] for the sake of it what is it
[50:13] Lord is it going beyond the outer court
[50:18] and just being
[50:20] forgiven is it going past the Brazen
[50:24] altar p pass the priests that sing your
[50:27] praise past the altar of incense that
[50:32] prayer altar where your incense is gone
[50:34] before the the nose of
[50:37] God going past it to go Beyond the
[50:42] Veil The Veil that was rent at Calvary
[50:46] the veil of his flesh that was
[50:49] torn Hallelujah tonight we pray where do
[50:52] you pray from are you praying from the

[50:57] the oldest are you praying from the
[50:59] outer court tonight or are you praying
[51:01] from the religious realm or are you
[51:03] praying from the holy of holies where
[51:06] the glories never fail where the light
[51:09] comes from God where the Mana never went
[51:11] stale where the rod of
[51:14] Aaron it came back into an eternal state
[51:18] that state was eternal that state never
[51:22] it was all one moment Eternal you know
[51:25] why
[51:26] my children know this very well we've

[51:39] in one moment it had to because it came
[51:43] into an eternal condition yeah

[51:52] prayer tonight cross over
[51:59] Hallelujah Prophet says this and I want
[52:03] you to ask this
[52:04] question where should our violence be
[52:07] aimed should it be aimed at each other
[52:10] should it be aimed at the
[52:12] Devil which one do you choose I believe
[52:15] the devil and don't even aim it at
[52:17] yourself Hallelujah sometimes we aim the
[52:20] violence at ourself and we condemn
[52:22] ourself and we get so down on our own
[52:24] uselessness sometimes but God's not
[52:27] concerned with that if you make it right
[52:31] and you
[52:32] repent Hallelujah you're in
[52:36] Fellowship God rebuke that devil that's
[52:38] hindering you beautiful little girls May
[52:40] the power that raised Jesus from the
[52:42] grave cast that thing away never bother
[52:45] you no more I say that on the authority
[52:47] of God's word you have to get angry with
[52:49] the devil God gives us the victory we
[52:53] got it right now this is the the victory
[52:55] that overcomes the world even your faith
[52:59] I was playing a game the other night
[53:00] with the children and you know for this
[53:03] violence you cannot be
[53:06] afraid we're play Monopoly and anyone
[53:10] that plays Monopoly will know exactly
[53:11] what I'm talking about Hallelujah and
[53:13] I'm going to call it safe mode now the
[53:16] devil wants to put you in safe mode he
[53:18] wants to put a whole bunch of troubles
[53:20] all around your life so that you're
[53:22] afraid to worship you're afraid to
[53:24] respond to the word you're afraid of
[53:27] repercussion and so my children and i'
[53:31] never win monopoly never but somehow I
[53:34] got favors that night and I had hotels
[53:37] all the way down Mayfair and Park Lane
[53:40] or whatever it's called and I had h
[53:41] house all on the other side which was
[53:43] also just as bad and my family all
[53:46] wanted to stay in
[53:49] jail they all wanted to stay in jail
[53:51] because they thought it's safer in
[53:54] jail
[53:56] have you ever been there it's safer in
[53:58] jail
[54:00] right that's what that's what that's
[54:02] what they wanted they they hey they're
[54:04] like we're happy don't they they're very
[54:07] happy to not roll a double CU otherwise
[54:09] they're in trouble and they're going to
[54:11] face the enemy and they're going to die
[54:14] but for you it's not the same see the
[54:18] devil will try trial after trial he will
[54:21] even come into your room and scare you
[54:23] and put fear on you
[54:25] so that you would enter into a safe mode
[54:27] and just be a good little Christian he
[54:30] wants you to be a he doesn't mind you
[54:31] being a good little Christian go to
[54:33] church every day read your Bible every
[54:36] day and just become a religious law
[54:38] abiding Christian happy ass doing good
[54:42] works that's what he want he he he
[54:44] doesn't mind but the the moment he wants
[54:48] he what he wants he wants you to stay in
[54:50] that little jail called safe mode you
[54:52] know your computer sometimes your
[54:53] computer just gets so old at blue
[54:55] screens all the time and and it just
[54:57] doesn't work anymore it just keeps
[54:58] crashing right and then finally it gives
[55:01] up the ghost but you really need that
[55:03] information on the computer you really
[55:05] need to get that off and you and to get
[55:07] this relaunched you've got to go through
[55:08] the computer in safe mode it doesn't let
[55:10] you do everything it doesn't let you
[55:12] communicate properly you can't go on the
[55:13] internet you can't run everything you
[55:15] can just do a very little few little
[55:17] things just enough to get your hard hard
[55:20] driver you know has anyone does anyone
[55:22] know what I'm talking about we're all
[55:25] computer people here e is there anyone
[55:27] that isn't a computer doesn't know what
[55:28] I'm talking about oh good
[55:32] Hallelujah so what is that that's where
[55:35] the devil wants to try and place
[55:37] you in such a condition that you don't
[55:39] want to come out of jail but when you're
[55:42] in jail you can't communicate properly
[55:43] you you your visits are limited you
[55:46] can't really have friends
[55:51] yeah but for us the moment that you
[55:55] become
[55:56] violent and you come out of that jail
[55:58] and you recognize who's inside you and
[56:00] you recognize that your position and you
[56:02] recognize you were given Authority
[56:04] exusia you were given uh uh the the
[56:07] freedom to take authority over every
[56:10] force of the enemy and tread on all the
[56:13] Devils I give you power over all the
[56:17] Devils Hallelujah to tread on
[56:21] all that's not just some whatever you're
[56:24] facing whatever the devil has placed in
[56:26] your life or tried to hinder you come
[56:29] out of Safe Mode come out of the jail
[56:32] come out of that thing and
[56:34] face with
[56:44] violence hallelujah how am I doing for
[56:47] time it's
[56:48] 8:23 what time do we have to finish this
[56:51] 8:30 is it 8:30 sweet we're nearly
[56:56] there you know this
[56:59] um
[57:01] this is a letter that was from the tank
[57:05] command a tank commander in the um in
[57:08] this in the present War his name is aai
[57:11] Simon Tav or TV and he wrote a letter to
[57:16] some media in Israel and it became a
[57:19] national letter and and I think is a
[57:22] very um important
[57:25] um thought here for us to understand the
[57:28] importance of being a United body and
[57:32] not allowing safe mode to hinder your
[57:34] communication to hinder you from being a
[57:36] real Christian a violent Christian
[57:38] someone that is that's going to tear
[57:39] down the devil's Kingdom because to
[57:42] progress from this point on you have to
[57:44] break the gates of hell because the
[57:46] gates if you don't if you're not willing
[57:48] to fight you're going to the gates the
[57:51] hell's just going to put Gates all
[57:52] around you to stop you from progressing
[57:55] but remember this God has called us to a
[57:57] war we're enlisted in an army and God
[58:00] wants us to be in unity and for all your
[58:02] channels of communication you be able to
[58:04] be a good friend to be able to connect
[58:06] with people to be able to connect with
[58:07] the body and not have funny complexes or
[58:10] any memory channels and things that are
[58:11] blocking you from being friends and
[58:13] being able to connect amen amen see the
[58:16] Lord's got the grace in this room
[58:18] tonight to bring us into perfect love
[58:20] and perfect unity and keep us there
[58:22] right and and if any little thing starts
[58:24] to come into the midst of us the love of
[58:27] God just dissolves it and the the the
[58:29] maturity of the body dissolves all of
[58:32] the works of the enemy because of
[58:34] discernment you discern the Antichrist
[58:36] spirit that would come in to try and
[58:38] cause trouble right and I'm not saying
[58:40] that there is that in the church but I'm
[58:41] just giving this word so that you can be
[58:44] prepared because as the prophet says the
[58:46] devil does not want us to stay one big
[58:48] sweet group he'll do everything he can
[58:51] to twist the thoughts in the mind to try
[58:54] and break the the unity but listen to
[58:55] what this tank commander said he says
[58:58] this Hamas cuz remember they're fighting
[59:00] Hamas and this Hamas had been been a a
[59:04] thorn in the sight of Israel for 60
[59:07] years he says Hamas is stronger than the
[59:09] left now we're talking about a divided
[59:12] political um country very divided and
[59:15] there was protests all over Israel I
[59:17] don't know if anyone followed the news
[59:19] but there it was a very divided country
[59:22] but this guy as they came into this war
[59:24] he began to realize something here he
[59:26] said Hamas is stronger than the left it
[59:29] is also stronger than the right and also
[59:31] bi and Ben G our enemy is stronger than
[59:35] Israeli
[59:36] Hightech and the settlement
[59:40] Enterprise that's the people and the The
[59:43] Entity that's behind the people that are
[59:44] going to claim their
[59:46] land but divided Hamas is stronger than
[59:49] all those entities right the strong
[59:52] stronger than the left stronger than the
[59:53] right
[59:57] Hamas is stronger than T's beautiful
[59:58] soul and has no chance against them nor
[1:00:01] does the periphery but Hamas has no
[1:00:05] chance against
[1:00:07] Israel when we are united and mobilized
[1:00:10] they Retreat into their tunnels and pray
[1:00:13] for a
[1:00:14] ceasefire Romans 8:31 says what shall we
[1:00:17] say then to these things if God be for
[1:00:19] us who everyone say who who who can be
[1:00:23] against us and I want you to repeat this
[1:00:26] after me my God is for me my God is for
[1:00:29] who can be against me who can be against
[1:00:32] me I am a son and daughter of God I'm a
[1:00:34] son
[1:00:35] and and I have prevailed over all the
[1:00:38] works of the enemy I
[1:00:41] pr greater is heer is he that is in me
[1:00:46] is in than he that is in the world than
[1:00:48] he in the world I am willing I am
