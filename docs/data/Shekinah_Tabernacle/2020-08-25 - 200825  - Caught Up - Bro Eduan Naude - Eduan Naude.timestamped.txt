[23:28] as the musicians take their seats, let's
[23:30] um, let's just bow our hearts before our
[23:33] Lord and um, let me just have a time to
[23:37] to settle the nerves. Thank you Lord
[23:39] Jesus that we can be here amongst
[23:43] brother uh brethren Lord uh brothers and
[23:45] sisters of like-minded faith Lord that's
[23:48] come out in this cold Lord to come here
[23:50] from you Lord not from a man and not
[23:53] from any one or any opinion or any
[23:56] interpretation Lord but only from the
[23:58] word of of the living God of the eternal
[24:02] one of Elohim the self-existing one Lord
[24:06] the one we chose you chose us and we
[24:08] choose to accept that he Lord to say we
[24:11] worship you in spirit and in truth Lord
[24:14] and we've given our lives to you Lord if
[24:16] you warm us just up um from from within
[24:20] tonight Lord settle settle my nerves
[24:23] Lord you know um what I had to deal with
[24:27] Lord I the the preparation that I went
[24:29] through and and how you gave this um
[24:32] this this thought to me Lord um and and
[24:36] and from a from a human perspective. I I
[24:39] could spend months on this subject,
[24:41] Lord, to prepare. Um but it is uh this
[24:45] is what you've given me, Lord. And and
[24:47] may it be a perfect sacrifice, Lord,
[24:50] like Abel on his altar, Lord, that you
[24:53] that you will accept this because it
[24:55] comes from revelation
[24:57] and it and it and it and it hits the
[24:59] hearts and the souls of of your body um
[25:03] um in in revelation, Lord. May it be
[25:06] received that way. Lord, I pray that we
[25:08] um enter now into a time of worship and
[25:12] and and may may these words just savor
[25:15] be be savor in your mouth and and in
[25:17] Jesus Christ's name I pray. Amen.
[25:20] Amen. Um if we can turn to our uh Bibles
[25:26] uh John uh let's go first to um one
[25:30] Thessalonians 5. 1 Thessalonians 5 verse
[25:34] 1.
[25:38] and 4.
[25:41] 1 Thessalonians 5 1
[25:45] and 4.
[25:49] I've um I've prepared this. So, uh
[25:52] Brother Moro asked if we can just um uh
[25:55] swap services and um and I said yes. And
[26:01] and I had this thought that I was going
[26:03] with and um and I and I halfway prepared
[26:07] that. And when he asked me that, the
[26:10] Lord put a total complete different
[26:13] thought in my mind and and I don't know
[26:15] where it came from. I I know where it
[26:17] came from. Uh not from me. And if I had
[26:20] a choice, it it wouldn't been this. But
[26:23] the Lord just said, I I want you to
[26:25] speak about this. So let's read. But of
[26:28] the times and the seasons, brethren, you
[26:30] have no no need that I write unto you.
[26:32] For yourselves know perfectly that the
[26:34] day of the Lord so cometh as a thief in
[26:38] the night. For whence they shall say
[26:39] peace and safety, then sudden
[26:41] destruction cometh upon them as travail
[26:44] upon a woman with child, and they shall
[26:45] not escape. But ye, brethren, you are
[26:50] not in darkness, that that day should
[26:53] overtake you as a thief.
[26:56] And this scripture I will I will tie
[26:59] into um hopefully it all comes together.
[27:03] John 3. It's a very familiar um
[27:06] scripture to us all.
[27:09] And no man hath ascended up to heaven.
[27:12] But he that came down from heaven, even
[27:14] the Son of Man which is in heaven. And
[27:17] as Moses lifted up the serpent in the
[27:19] wilderness, even so must the Son of Man
[27:22] be lifted up, that whosoever believeth
[27:26] on him shall not pre perish, but have
[27:29] eternal life. And here it is now. For
[27:32] God so loved the world that he gave his
[27:34] only begotten son, that whosoever
[27:37] believeth in him should not perish, but
[27:40] have everlasting life. For God sent not
[27:44] his son into the world to condemn the
[27:46] world, but that the world through him
[27:50] might be saved. There's the whole
[27:52] redemption plan uh physically in in in
[27:56] one verse and in a in a couple of uh
[27:58] verses. Um may the Lord bless the
[28:01] reading of his word. You you may have
[28:03] your seats.
[28:05] Uh if I can just stay on this. So, um,
[28:10] I'll maybe show you show you what we're
[28:14] going to talk about, where I'm going to
[28:16] go. I'm trying to tie two things
[28:19] together. I'm not me, the the Lord. And
[28:22] and and um, yes, the Lord's my witness.
[28:25] I I don't know how to do this. He knows.
[28:28] He knows all things. So, I want to talk
[28:31] about caught up. And um we talk about it
[28:35] a lot as the rapture. And I thought I'll
[28:38] just I'll I'll be a little bit different
[28:40] and and say it how it is in the word.
[28:43] And um
[28:46] I am
[28:48] excited to to bring two things together.
[28:51] Um it's actually more than two but um
[28:55] yes the thought came as I said brother
[28:57] Vor um phoned me and I thought oh yes
[29:00] I've got I've got one or two thoughts
[29:01] that I that I can just color in the
[29:03] picture and and I told brother Ben the
[29:09] Lord just said the rapture and I go whoa
[29:12] now being in this journey now that I've
[29:15] had with the message of the hour um
[29:18] ministering a few times uh it's not one
[29:20] of those where You go, "No, Lord, that
[29:22] was not the thought I had in mind. So, I
[29:24] will I will I will say something else."
[29:27] You go, "Whoa." Um, yes, Lord. Uh, let
[29:30] let me start preparing. And um and I
[29:32] feel illprepared tonight. I feel we can
[29:35] spend so much time around this. You
[29:38] would know. Um this is this is this is
[29:41] what we are living for. The rapture, the
[29:44] the being the um being caught up in the
[29:47] air. That's what we're living for. that
[29:49] this is why we're here. He's coming to
[29:51] come and fetch us and we we are then
[29:53] disappearing. The people will not see us
[29:56] um until we come reign with Christ. But
[29:59] yes, we'll we'll get there. So the one
[30:03] thought that I that I had and this is so
[30:05] how it started is is John 3. So I've
[30:09] just highlighted a few things here. So
[30:11] for God so loved the world. So God is
[30:14] theos. God is our object of worship. So
[30:18] God before God there was Elohim in
[30:20] Genesis. Elohim is a self-existing one
[30:23] and he was sitting there and angels were
[30:25] worshiping him but not out of out of
[30:28] will out of want out of a a decision or
[30:31] a choice. So he said he wants to he
[30:33] wants to make man in his image and so he
[30:36] did and how he became God is basically
[30:41] we are worshiping him. We made him an
[30:44] object of his of of worship. So this
[30:48] object of worship, our object of worship
[30:50] so loved the world. The world is the
[30:52] cosmos. The world is everything that we
[30:55] see. It's up in the skies. He so loved
[30:58] and and in and all the living
[31:00] inhabitants
[31:02] um that he gave his only begotten son.
[31:06] He gave
[31:07] the only
[31:09] uh thing.
[31:12] How can I put this? He he he he gave
[31:15] himself. He gave his life. He gave his
[31:21] name. He gave us a way out. He gave us
[31:26] bread, living water. He gave us blood to
[31:30] as as a lamb, a sacrificial lamb. uh uh
[31:34] his only begotten son to whosoever
[31:36] believeth. Now that believeth is just
[31:38] not um yes I believe and we walk on.
[31:42] There's there's a order in how do you
[31:45] how do you show evidence of your belief
[31:50] your faith and that is entrusting
[31:54] entrust your life
[31:56] &gt;&gt; to Christ and in him um should not
[32:00] perish but have uh everlasting life.
[32:02] Everlasting is perpetual. everlasting is
[32:05] not stopping and life as we know it is
[32:08] Zoey. So, and he did not um send God
[32:14] here, send the his son to condemn the
[32:18] world, but to make a way to to to show
[32:21] that we are in a fallen state and he is
[32:24] the way out. So that's how I wanted to
[32:27] start it because we as a body of
[32:30] believers, we as uh the church of the
[32:33] living God, we need a a way out. We are
[32:37] from this world. Uh we are in this
[32:40] world, not from this world. So we need a
[32:42] way out as much as the guy out there or
[32:45] girl, brother or sister.
[32:51] So caught up. As I said
[32:54] 1 Thessalonians 4 verse 16-18,
[33:00] for the Lord himself shall descend from
[33:03] heaven with a with a shout
[33:07] with a voice of archangel archangel and
[33:10] with a trump of God and the dead in
[33:12] Christ shall rise first and then uh
[33:15] which uh we which are alive and remain
[33:18] shall be caught up together with him in
[33:20] the clouds to meet the Lord in the there
[33:23] and so shall we ever be with the Lord.
[33:25] How awesome is that? Wherefore comfort
[33:28] one another. So comfort one another with
[33:31] these words. So we that are alive and
[33:34] remain. I'm looking at them. We are in
[33:37] the last days. We'll be caught up in
[33:39] them. So let's comfort one another with
[33:41] the rapture. There's a lot of people uh
[33:44] and probably a lot of denominational
[33:46] Christians and nom nominal Christians
[33:48] outside of the the message um realms is
[33:52] that they sometimes feel we preach too
[33:55] much about the rapture too much about um
[33:58] him coming taking us too much about the
[34:01] bridegroom fetching his bride like okay
[34:05] so in the human form if you are going to
[34:08] a wedding you are the bridegroom or
[34:11] maybe the bride
[34:12] um that's all you are thinking about. So
[34:17] 2 3 4 months in advance we can we can
[34:20] ask the the newly made uh weds. Um
[34:23] there's one thing on your mind and
[34:26] that's it. You want this perfect day.
[34:28] You are you are asking all the
[34:30] questions. You are planning to the
[34:31] detail to how your dress is going to
[34:34] look. What day is it going to be? Is
[34:36] there going to be sunshine? um the
[34:38] photographers, the video, the the food,
[34:40] the catering, everything needs to be
[34:42] perfect. You are thinking about one
[34:44] thing.
[34:46] And why not us? Why can we not think
[34:49] about our bridegroom coming to fetch us
[34:52] every single day and every moment? Um so
[34:55] I'm excited about it. I I do not see a a
[34:59] big problem about thinking about the
[35:00] rapture. Uh uh thinking about him, how
[35:03] he's when is he going to come and fetch
[35:05] us? you're thinking, "Oh, Lord, can it
[35:07] be today?" We'll get to um later how
[35:09] Brother Brandham explains it, but um you
[35:13] know, getting getting excited to get up
[35:15] in the morning cuz this might be the
[35:17] day. Now, while he's taring, we should
[35:20] do a few things as well. We should go
[35:22] and color in the picture, get that last
[35:24] one in, you know, and we see that now
[35:26] happening. We see it across in in our
[35:28] little church. We see it uh across the
[35:31] nations. We see at different churches
[35:32] how how little lost ones is coming in.
[35:35] How the message is just washing in them
[35:37] as well. You know, wayward ones,
[35:39] prodical sons coming back again and just
[35:42] um sort of now accepting the fact they
[35:46] they they they cons convinced they
[35:48] concerned there's something more out
[35:50] there that the world could not feed
[35:51] them. Um what is it? Where do I go? So,
[35:56] and it's beautiful. I want to make this
[35:59] little segue from here because we are
[36:02] talking here about the the shout, the
[36:04] voice of the archangel, the trump of
[36:07] God. And this got me intrigued that this
[36:09] this is all the Lord. I do not know. I
[36:12] I'm I'm actually not versed at all in
[36:15] the as deeply in the in the feasts of
[36:18] the of the um the seven feasts of of
[36:21] Israel and how that um and works. We've
[36:25] we've had the spiritual uh meanings of
[36:28] it um interpreted and how how we sort of
[36:32] um through our
[36:34] through the preaching of the word uh it
[36:36] was made clear and sort of revealed to
[36:38] us um a physical feast that the
[36:41] Israelites held and how that uh
[36:43] spiritually ties in with the with us
[36:46] with the bride. We are the spiritual
[36:48] Israel. So we need to take heed. We need
[36:51] to be attentive to what is happening and
[36:54] and why the feasts. So this is how it
[36:57] all started. It it it it popped up. The
[37:00] first thing that popped up was uh a a
[37:02] date of the rapture. So people talking
[37:06] about on the feeds. Um all of a sudden I
[37:09] I I was not looking at it. The Lord
[37:11] knows my heart. I was not looking for
[37:13] it. And then the next thing was this
[37:15] feast of trumpets. feast of trumpets
[37:18] that pop up and especially the feast of
[37:20] trumpets around this this this the
[37:23] coming one the in in 2025. So the feast
[37:26] of trumpets also known as yum Toroa um
[37:30] is one of the most important holidays in
[37:32] the Jewish calendar. It marks the
[37:34] beginning of the four feasts and is a
[37:36] time of reflection, repentance and
[37:39] anticipation of the coming of the
[37:41] Messiah. Traditionally, this festival is
[37:44] observed the blowing of trumpets, which
[37:47] signifies a call to prepare for a new
[37:50] season of self-reflection and spiritual
[37:53] renewal. So, um, please, I wanted to
[37:56] actually start with this is it's cold
[37:58] out there, but the good thing is we can
[38:00] have some spiritual jackets on tonight.
[38:02] So, keep keep an open mind and and and
[38:05] and read between the lines as I go. Uh,
[38:07] like I said, I could prepare months for
[38:10] this. Um, and and and really it it'll
[38:13] blow my mind as I'm as I will bring it
[38:15] to you. But we only have a short amount
[38:18] of time. So maybe this is a way to open
[38:21] a little door so that you can go and and
[38:23] and search the scriptures. It I it's
[38:26] it's really nice to see. So the feast of
[38:31] trumpets um
[38:34] the feast of trumpets and it's a idiom
[38:37] in in Israel the feast no one knows the
[38:40] day or the hour. So this here the feast
[38:44] of trumpets is starting in 23 or 24
[38:48] September one of the seven muds or um do
[38:51] I have it up there? Yes. um divine
[38:54] appointments or feasts is called the the
[38:56] yum tow. It is referred to as rash
[38:59] hashah and the feast of trumpets of the
[39:02] seven mud. This one is the only one that
[39:05] doesn't have an exact starting date. Now
[39:08] this got my attention. I didn't know
[39:10] this. It begins only when two witnesses
[39:13] see the edge of the moon and report
[39:16] their sighting to the Sanhedrin. uh the
[39:19] requirement uh introduces slight
[39:21] variable time to its inception. So when
[39:24] it starts the Jews celebrate what is
[39:26] supposed to be the first day of the 7th
[39:28] month tertiary uh Leviticus 23. So
[39:32] interesting if I can highlight that it
[39:34] says Leviticus 23:23 and this year it is
[39:37] on 23rd of September which is I just saw
[39:41] that as is interesting um a 2-day period
[39:44] because it is the day no one knows the
[39:46] day or hour. For this very reason yumua
[39:50] was and still is referred to as the m uh
[39:53] that no one knows the day or hour of.
[39:57] And that of course refers to Matthew 24
[40:00] where Jesus said of this uh of that day
[40:03] and hour knoweth no man know not the
[40:05] angels of heaven but the father only.
[40:09] And just to sort of color in the picture
[40:12] um of Le Leviticus 23. And the Lord
[40:14] spoke unto Moses, saying, "Speak unto
[40:17] the children of Israel, saying, In the
[40:19] seventh month, and the first day of the
[40:21] month, shall ye have the Sabbath
[40:23] memorial uh memorial of blowing of
[40:26] trumpets and holy convocation. He shall
[40:29] do no civil work therein, and he shall
[40:32] offer an offering made by fire unto the
[40:35] Lord." Um, this fire was just sort of
[40:38] highlighted while I was looking at the
[40:40] rapture and what's going to happen after
[40:42] the rapture and the tribulation. And I
[40:44] saw fire and I go, "Oo, okay." Um, a lot
[40:47] of things will be consumed. And the Lord
[40:49] spake unto Moses, saying also in the
[40:51] 10th day of the seventh month, which we
[40:53] as believers uh know a lot of, there
[40:57] shall be a day of atonement.
[40:59] It shall be an holy convocation unto
[41:01] you, and ye shall afflict your souls and
[41:03] offer an offering made by fire unto the
[41:07] Lord. Now, very interesting when I read,
[41:10] if I just quickly jump there back, it is
[41:13] two witnesses that needs to
[41:17] uh uh see the edge of the moon and
[41:20] report their sightings. Now of course if
[41:22] it's a cloudy day um you know there
[41:25] might be a delay in when two witnesses
[41:27] can actually observe that which which
[41:30] makes it you know at a at a sort of an
[41:32] uncertain time. So the final phase of
[41:35] the moon just before the feast of
[41:37] trumpets no one knows precisely when it
[41:39] will come but witnesses must watch for
[41:42] it. You must watch for it. Now, taking
[41:47] that the the the physical feast of
[41:49] trumpets looking at the physical moon
[41:52] and tying in the spiritual, we've got
[41:55] that little glimpse there of the Laosian
[41:57] age where there's just a little sliver
[42:00] of light and people will will witness
[42:05] this. People will watch this, must watch
[42:08] this. So, we in this dark age, we need
[42:11] to stand now here um as a a and prepare
[42:16] for the feast of trumpets where, and
[42:20] I'll jump quickly back. They're right in
[42:22] the middle of the reflection and
[42:24] repentance and anticipation of the
[42:26] coming of the Messiah. This is what
[42:28] we're looking for. This is what we
[42:30] excited about.
[42:33] Now, a quick segue.
[42:36] 2 Peter 3:8 says, "But beloved, be not
[42:38] ignorant of this one thing, that one day
[42:41] is as with the Lord as a thousand years,
[42:44] and a thousand years is one day." So, a
[42:47] lot of things um and and and you you
[42:50] know all these scriptures. So
[42:55] based on all the genealogies and ages
[42:57] and scholars have calculated that the
[42:59] years from Adam to Jesus uh which is
[43:03] 4,000 years and from Jesus to now is
[43:05] roughly 2,000 years bringing us right to
[43:07] the edge of that 6,000 year mark and the
[43:11] seven so after 7 years so that seven
[43:13] years is talking about tribulation
[43:16] it will mark the seventh and final
[43:18] thousand years thousand years of
[43:21] Christ's reign when we reign with him.
[43:24] So 6,000 years under man's rule followed
[43:27] by a thousand years of Christ's reign.
[43:29] It's the same pattern as God's creation.
[43:31] Six days of work and one day of rest. I
[43:34] thought that was that was really
[43:36] peculiar and um and how the Lord is in
[43:39] mass, how the Lord is just perfectly
[43:41] orchestrated. the the power of God is um
[43:45] we we talk about it and it's and it sort
[43:47] of goes over our heads is that that the
[43:50] Lord so our object of worship so where
[43:53] Elohim started and and is he's outside
[43:56] of time he's outside of space and matter
[43:59] he's outside of weight and
[44:03] because of that he could orchestrate
[44:05] perfect times he could orchestrate
[44:08] perfect numbers he could put everything
[44:10] together and we go, how did you do this,
[44:13] Lord? Because he's outside of it. So, he
[44:16] sees the end from the beginning. He can
[44:18] he can he can flavor this for us and and
[44:21] and give us this whole uh different
[44:24] dimension of of of of looking at things.
[44:27] Now,
[44:29] I I don't want to I don't want to be the
[44:31] the conspiracy theorist. I don't want to
[44:33] be that that guy that say um the feast
[44:37] of trumpets of this year, which is 23
[44:39] September. um could be the rapture and
[44:43] we all sit there and wait for it. No. Um
[44:46] I think there's a lot of people that's
[44:47] done that. I'm just showing here and
[44:50] it's a very highlight cuz trust me if
[44:53] you go into this the Jews are are very
[44:57] very um uh what's the word? Um granular
[45:02] with the detail of the scriptures and
[45:05] how it ties into where we are. Um, and
[45:09] from that
[45:11] it shows we are not far from the end. We
[45:14] are very close and I think we are closer
[45:15] than we really think. If it happens this
[45:18] year, praise the Lord. If it doesn't,
[45:20] praise the Lord. We walk on. But I want
[45:23] to just show you we are actually we are
[45:26] very close very close to the uh
[45:29] scriptures fulfilled. Uh prophecy is
[45:31] here. Um how many earthquakes I actually
[45:33] wanted to go and research that didn't
[45:35] didn't have time. there were so many
[45:37] earthquakes now in California alone um
[45:40] one after the other you know there's
[45:43] things put in motion and um oh
[45:46] interestingly 23 um September uh is the
[45:51] UN world council of thingy thingy coming
[45:54] together in New York as well which is
[45:56] very interesting that it's falling on
[45:58] the same day so there's a lot of things
[46:00] that's happening that we're not aware of
[46:02] now this is not scaremongry this is not
[46:05] to say, "Oh, we can go and sit and wait
[46:08] somewhere on the mountaintop for the
[46:09] Lord to come." No, get excited.
[46:13] &gt;&gt; Um, do what you have to do. Like the
[46:15] brother Brandon said, plant your
[46:16] potatoes, carry on, you know, but for
[46:20] the those that have not awakened yet,
[46:24] let's let's get real. Let's let's let's
[46:27] do something to to take that next step
[46:30] into the into Christ's redemption plan
[46:34] to um to make it our own to say, "Lord,
[46:39] I'm sealed." Um the there's this there's
[46:43] this um this feeling that comes over me
[46:46] when um when when people are are either
[46:50] still sitting on the fence or or or
[46:52] there's a there's there's a there's a I
[46:55] guess this the preparation of the sermon
[46:57] sort of ties in. Um there there's a
[47:00] fight within me. There's there's there's
[47:01] really just battles and and and I don't
[47:04] have time and all this and nothing comes
[47:06] together. But in the way back part of my
[47:09] mind, I go, "The Lord's got this." I I
[47:12] go, "Lord, I've I've I've surrendered
[47:14] everything. So So you have to you have
[47:17] to you obligated to help me here to to
[47:20] to provide the the words of eternal
[47:23] life. I don't have to bring and and and
[47:25] suck it out of my thumb. I I just stand
[47:28] here and I step out of the way, the old
[47:31] nature, the old dead, the old, and you
[47:34] can work through me and you can bring
[47:35] this to the people, you know. So, you've
[47:37] got this fight and it's still going on
[47:39] and it'll go on until the rapture, but
[47:42] there's something in the back of you
[47:44] going, I I'm there. I've made it. I'm
[47:48] I'm so close to my theophony. Some days
[47:50] it feels like a bump into them. Some
[47:52] days it feels like he's tripping me
[47:54] over, you know, that I'm falling on my
[47:56] face. Some some some
[47:59] days.
[48:01] So th this is this is just to show you
[48:05] um we we can talk as much as we want
[48:07] about how close we are but we are really
[48:10] close. We are we are genuinely close. So
[48:14] whatever you want to make right whatever
[48:16] you want to um go and
[48:19] go and uh do for the Lord or just get a
[48:22] you know just get serious with him just
[48:24] let him in. Just surrender a little bit
[48:26] more whatever it needs. Um just just do
[48:29] that now.
[48:31] I've got a few um
[48:34] just just a few so one two three four
[48:37] big slides. So if you can stay with me
[48:40] um this is this is brother Brandham and
[48:42] this is the rapture. So again when that
[48:44] thought came with the rapture I go oh
[48:46] yeah the there's the the message the
[48:48] rapture and and I thought okay I will I
[48:50] will sit and listen to it. phenomenal,
[48:53] phenomenal message. And even within it,
[48:56] the L the the the prophet was sort of um
[48:59] scheming over things because he saw
[49:00] there was a lady looking at him and and
[49:02] um they wanted to close up shop and and
[49:05] he even the the offerings that they gave
[49:07] he he gave to them because he was going
[49:09] over time. So, you know, there was so
[49:11] much that he could say and he he he did
[49:14] speak about how many pages he sort of
[49:16] left out. So, um, do yourself a favor
[49:19] and go go refresh your memory with, um,
[49:21] with with that. So, I'll just I'm going
[49:24] to highlight a few things and and just
[49:26] follow with me. It's four four big
[49:28] slides and then I'll slow down again.
[49:30] Okay. Um, the rapture. Now,
[49:36] uh, let me get my spot. Now the now the
[49:39] seven watches like seven watch when um
[49:42] it didn't come from the first watch,
[49:43] second, third, fourth, but it came from
[49:45] the seventh watch. Now it's talking
[49:47] about um the hour. It's talking about um
[49:50] the watch um how the the Israelites the
[49:53] Jews um divied up their the um night in
[49:58] their watch. Um that was Enoch the 7th
[50:01] which was translated. This was very um
[50:05] profound to me. And Noah being a type of
[50:07] the remnant of Jews is to is to be
[50:10] carried over. Now there was also uh one
[50:14] Jew was was was comparing uh Leah um
[50:18] which uh Jacob uh uh married and um and
[50:23] Rachel um how how that relates to us
[50:27] Leah and then Rachel the the the
[50:31] Israelites the Jews that the Lord will
[50:33] come and fetch after maybe the
[50:35] tribulation. No, I'm I'm I'm not in
[50:38] depth into that, but I just saw the ties
[50:40] here into Enoch the seventh that will be
[50:43] translated the gentile bride and then
[50:46] Noah being a type of the remnant Jews
[50:48] that will be carried over. Now in Bible
[50:50] times talking about the watches and the
[50:53] nights were not divided into hours in
[50:55] the Bible time
[50:57] um the night was not divided in hours um
[51:01] it was divided in watches. There was so
[51:04] there basically three watches and the
[51:05] first watch started at from 9 to 12. The
[51:09] second watch started 12 to 3 and the
[51:12] third watch of the night was counted
[51:13] from 3-6. Now we got three threes which
[51:16] is 9. And brother Abraham says here it's
[51:19] imperfect number. So we need to get to
[51:21] seven where it's the rapture which will
[51:24] take place. And this is why he said he
[51:26] believes the rapture will be between 6
[51:28] and 9:00 in the morning. Now again, this
[51:32] is not to uh to wake you up 5:00 in the
[51:36] morning and sit there and waiting. Maybe
[51:38] maybe the Lord will come 6:00. No, he
[51:40] can come anytime cuz is it 6:00 in the
[51:42] northern hemisphere or the southern
[51:43] hemisphere? I don't know. I don't care.
[51:46] But maybe if you're 6:00 in the morning
[51:48] and you're standing and brushing your
[51:49] teeth, if you can get your thoughts on
[51:51] the Lord already and you can sing a hymn
[51:53] and you can praise him, he might just
[51:55] come and fetch you in that state, you
[51:57] know. So any reason to to worship in any
[52:00] any any reason and in any time of the
[52:02] day um to to enjoy his presence.
[52:09] So for the trumpet of the Lord shall
[52:10] sound. So we're talking about the feast
[52:12] of trumpets and that bright and
[52:14] cloudless morning and the dead of Christ
[52:16] shall rise and the glory of his
[52:18] resurrection share when his chosen one
[52:21] shall gather to their homes beyond the
[52:23] sky when the road is called up yonder.
[52:25] So, let's drop down. First
[52:27] Thessalonians,
[52:29] uh, the order of this great rapture will
[52:32] take place in the last days.
[52:35] We're going to begin at the the 13th
[52:37] verse. And then he colors in the
[52:39] picture. So, if you drop down then there
[52:41] where the yellow is the Lord himself
[52:44] himself shall descend from the heavens
[52:46] with a shout, with a voice of the
[52:48] archangel and the trump of God, and the
[52:51] dead in Christ shall rise. Now notice
[52:54] this great thing taking place. Don't
[52:56] miss this. The word says here uh in in
[52:59] first Thessalonians
[53:01] um notice a shout, a voice, a trumpet.
[53:04] Let's read now and see that the the the
[53:07] Lord himself shall descend from heaven
[53:09] with a shout and the voice three things
[53:12] happen. A voice, a shout, a voice, uh
[53:15] sorry, a shout, a voice, and a trumpet.
[53:18] It has to happen before Jesus appears.
[53:21] Now Jesus does all three of them. He's
[53:25] descending a shout. What is the shout?
[53:28] It's the message going forth first. The
[53:30] living bread of life bringing forth the
[53:33] bride. Now God has a way of doing things
[53:35] and he never changes his policy. And now
[53:38] he reveals so so in Amos 3:7
[53:43] um he he revealed it to his servants the
[53:47] prophets. So he would do nothing on
[53:48] earth until first he does that. Now
[53:51] we've come through the church ages and
[53:53] we promised in the last days according
[53:55] to Malachi 4. This is the prophet
[53:57] speaking about the word that there would
[53:59] be a return again a prophet in the land.
[54:02] So not notice now and this is again the
[54:05] prophet is saying notice his nature.
[54:09] God is using this spirit five times.
[54:12] Once in Elijah, once in Elisha, John the
[54:14] Baptist call out the church and remnant
[54:16] of the Jews five times. His grace, his
[54:19] Jesus, his faith, it's a number of
[54:21] grace. See, and and that's why the
[54:24] Lord's so so mindful and so detailed, so
[54:28] granular, even if he's outside of time,
[54:30] he he gets this so perfect within the
[54:33] number and one on what that means, the
[54:36] significance of it. when all these
[54:38] mysteries shall be all bundled up in a
[54:40] bunch of um Ecclesiastes
[54:43] um it will take a direct prophet from
[54:46] God to reveal it and that's exactly what
[54:49] he promised to do and he's done that
[54:51] right
[54:53] so let me just see that I didn't skip
[54:55] over anything that I really wanted to to
[54:57] nail down yes so a direct prophet from
[55:00] from God and God um has also has all
[55:05] always in the ages
[55:07] through Isaiah, Jeremiah, um Elijah,
[55:11] when the ecclesiastical group would get
[55:14] everything all mixed up, he would send a
[55:15] prophet, raise him up from nowhere. So,
[55:18] we know from nowhere, we know where John
[55:20] the Baptist was. We know um Jesus
[55:23] himself from Nazareth. What good can
[55:25] come out of Nazareth? If we look at um
[55:28] uh Noah, if we look at Abraham, if we
[55:30] look at um brother Brandham, where he
[55:32] came from, he was called of a scene and
[55:35] gone. just a rugged man of the truth of
[55:37] God and it's always the way you could
[55:39] tell him. Uh there's one among you who
[55:41] is spiritual or a prophet. Now prophets
[55:44] there's a s such a thing as gift of
[55:46] prophecy in the church but a prophet is
[55:48] predestinated and four ordained for the
[55:51] hour. Um yes sir. Now prophecy goes
[55:55] forth sorry prophecy goes forth uh two
[55:58] of three is set and judge whether that's
[56:00] right or or not. And that's what we do
[56:02] in the order of of our church. But a
[56:05] prophet is for ordained and it it it it
[56:08] leads it it is the voice of God in that
[56:11] age.
[56:13] Now this is this is where we are and I
[56:17] like um it's quite it's quite uh crude
[56:20] and crass how how it's put called off
[56:23] the scene and gone just rugged men of
[56:25] the truth of God. They come they give
[56:28] thus sayaith the Lord and they off the
[56:30] scene. And it was so apparent to me when
[56:33] I looked at that and I thought, "Yes, so
[56:36] the people after Jesus's death, his own
[56:38] disciples, you know, they they
[56:40] scattered. They they didn't know what to
[56:42] do. They they felt like their whole life
[56:45] uh you know, came crumbling down. He's
[56:47] now off the scene. I thought he would
[56:49] get us um you know uh he would be the
[56:52] king that lead us out of this Rome uh
[56:55] Roman Empire and and come and fight for
[56:58] us." um if they only knew. But then the
[57:01] same with the ones after brother
[57:03] Brandham's death, there was a lot of
[57:05] confusion and a lot of um a lot of hurt,
[57:08] a lot of where do we go now? But he had
[57:11] to go off the scene. I'm seeing it now.
[57:14] I'm seeing the transision, not the
[57:17] transition. I'm seeing the fulfillment
[57:19] of scripture the in in an individual's
[57:22] heart. So each one here is a liquid
[57:25] fire. each one here receive the
[57:28] revelation of what Jesus Christ is in
[57:30] your life and what's in my life and what
[57:32] is he doing and he's still busy doing
[57:35] he's not has done he is still busy doing
[57:39] and we need to we need to definitely
[57:42] keep on walking especially now because
[57:47] what what we've received it's so it's so
[57:50] it's so powerful it's so profound if we
[57:53] go if we go to denominations they cannot
[57:55] cannot explain to me revelation. They
[57:58] cannot tell me in the beginning was the
[58:00] word and the word was God. They they
[58:03] cannot put this together. They cannot uh
[58:05] uh uh stimulate me uh and give me
[58:08] anything um um better.
[58:12] And I just wanted to remind you again of
[58:14] this um picture. So where we are in the
[58:17] last days is that there is still so you
[58:20] can look at that how however you want
[58:23] but it's that it's that white light that
[58:26] gets my attention. It's that little
[58:28] glimmer of hope. It's that is it is you
[58:31] sitting here coming out of the cold
[58:33] coming here saying the Lord's got
[58:35] something for me. I need to take
[58:37] something away from here or I need to
[58:40] give my life. I need to surrender. And
[58:43] this is where I want to sort of tie in.
[58:47] Remember the beginning scripture that I
[58:49] had. So, so, so John 3:E 16. So, so love
[58:53] uh so did uh the Lord love us to give
[58:58] his only begotten son and to and to make
[59:02] a way for us so that we can have eternal
[59:06] life. I want to tie this now in Genesis
[59:10] 3:8. And they heard, now this is now
[59:13] Adam and Eve in the garden. They heard
[59:15] the voice of the Lord called God uh
[59:18] walking in the garden in the cool of the
[59:21] day. So that means he was coming to us.
[59:25] He gave away to us. He sent his only
[59:28] begotten son to us. So here he's walking
[59:31] and this is in Genesis. He's walking and
[59:34] he's coming to us to say, "How was your
[59:36] day?" He's he's coming to reveal himself
[59:39] to us in his time. So what I want to say
[59:43] about this is that we don't go and look
[59:45] for him. He comes and look for us. Why
[59:48] does he want to come and look for us?
[59:50] Why John 3:16? Why the the feast of the
[59:53] trumpets? Everything points to him. and
[59:56] everything is um is is is a way to say
[1:00:00] that you need to give yourself away cuz
[1:00:05] he's coming to redeem you. He loves you.
[1:00:09] He's g he's given his life for you. He's
[1:00:11] bled out on a cross um for you to just
[1:00:15] love him. And if there's and if if if
[1:00:18] you've surrendered, if you sold out,
[1:00:20] praise the Lord. Let's walk on. if you
[1:00:23] haven't, if there's small little things
[1:00:25] that's still in the way, let's let's
[1:00:27] let's work through this. Let's pray
[1:00:29] about it. Let's come together as a as a
[1:00:31] body of believers. We've seen prayer
[1:00:33] work. We still we still depend on it.
[1:00:36] And tonight is no no um no change of it,
[1:00:39] no different. We come to them. We come
[1:00:43] to the Lord with our prayer request,
[1:00:44] with our with our heart's desire to say,
[1:00:47] "Lord, if there's something still in me
[1:00:49] that I can just give, just take one more
[1:00:51] bit, Lord, can I can I can you fill me
[1:00:54] with your Holy Ghost in in that little
[1:00:56] crevices and that and and and wash over
[1:00:59] me um with the water of the word?" Um,
[1:01:03] one thing I I wanted to sort of uh also
[1:01:06] tie in when I when I was thinking about
[1:01:10] the Lord coming down,
[1:01:13] us surrendering and hearing his word, I
[1:01:16] was thinking about the the five loaves
[1:01:18] and two fishes. That little boy, that
[1:01:21] little boy of five loaves, two fishes,
[1:01:23] and if you can do math, 5 plus 2 is
[1:01:25] seven. So seven is a complete again. So
[1:01:27] we the Lord's always in his maths. um
[1:01:31] that boy
[1:01:33] gave everything right. So they you could
[1:01:37] have you you can take it two ways. So
[1:01:39] one is the parents nudged him and say
[1:01:42] hey just give Jesus everything that you
[1:01:44] have whatever you got in the basket give
[1:01:46] it and he could have maybe put up a fuss
[1:01:48] and say oh but how about one fish and
[1:01:52] two loaves you know then we have
[1:01:53] something for the family. Um it it could
[1:01:56] have gone so differently, but I think
[1:01:59] personally he was
[1:02:01] &gt;&gt; he is it, you know, he was he was uh
[1:02:05] probably in rugby terms or in business
[1:02:07] terms you would call a high risk and a
[1:02:09] high reward. He said um I'm going to
[1:02:12] give it without even thinking, not
[1:02:14] thinking about what he's going to eat,
[1:02:16] not thinking about what's coming
[1:02:18] tomorrow. Here's everything, Lord. Take
[1:02:20] it and do with that what you want. He
[1:02:23] could have broken it up and everyone
[1:02:24] could just get a bit. But see what he
[1:02:27] did. So look at the five talents versus
[1:02:30] the one talent. Look at the the the the
[1:02:32] the lies and the attitude behind it. I
[1:02:35] think I think the the little boy was
[1:02:38] absolutely sold out. So whether he heard
[1:02:41] the preaching of of Jesus, I don't know.
[1:02:43] But I think maybe he saw the life.
[1:02:46] &gt;&gt; He saw the fruits among him. And he
[1:02:47] said, "Well, if that's if that does
[1:02:50] this, I need to take everything I have,
[1:02:54] all the little fruits, and it's a stinky
[1:02:56] fish. It's maybe a old bread. You know,
[1:02:58] this was maybe the end of the day.
[1:03:00] Still, this is what I have, Lord. This
[1:03:03] little little stinky flesh that I have.
[1:03:05] This is all I have, but take it and take
[1:03:07] all of it. So, you can come and change
[1:03:09] it. You can come and refill it and renew
[1:03:11] it and and and grow and and and and
[1:03:14] increase." And and that's I thought a
[1:03:18] lot about how the Lord gives himself and
[1:03:21] everything of him. So let us let us give
[1:03:25] everything of us. Let us fully
[1:03:29] surrender. So let us not be um running
[1:03:34] to and fro. Let us not be um in Africans
[1:03:37] we say dear macar you know just ha know
[1:03:41] know where you're going know make your
[1:03:43] decision and say lord you where else
[1:03:47] will I go here's where I will um be
[1:03:50] satisfied here's where I will grow and
[1:03:54] maybe you not hearing the preaching but
[1:03:56] look at the life look at the fruits
[1:03:58] among you and see the growth so I wanted
[1:04:01] to bless you with that little thought,
[1:04:04] like I said, I I could go so so deep
[1:04:06] into this. Um, but I thought I wanted to
[1:04:09] to just address that we are at the end.
[1:04:13] Be excited about it. Take something
[1:04:15] home. Say, "Okay, Lord. Um, what what
[1:04:18] what do you have for me in store
[1:04:19] tomorrow?" Cuz the devil will attack.
[1:04:22] He's very predictable and tomorrow is uh
[1:04:25] is not like any other. Um, but he might
[1:04:28] come in the morning, you know. So, let's
[1:04:30] let's be excited about it. Let's worship
[1:04:33] in in in in everything that we do. Let's
[1:04:36] um um think about the the the brothers
[1:04:39] and sisters out there that's struggling.
[1:04:42] You know, you would see a lot um youth,
[1:04:43] you would see a lot at school, people
[1:04:45] that's just they don't know. Um, I was
[1:04:49] looking at a at a guy in a podcast and
[1:04:52] and and one of the one of the I guess
[1:04:54] the um the the guy that that visited him
[1:04:59] just spoke directly to him and said, "I
[1:05:02] think the Lord might have something in
[1:05:04] store for you." He said, "I think you
[1:05:06] you know," and he could not look back in
[1:05:09] his eyes. This guy was looking all over
[1:05:12] and he just knew that something stepped
[1:05:15] into the room. He knew that that's a
[1:05:18] that's a call and if he does if he if he
[1:05:21] does respond his life will be changed.
[1:05:23] Your life will be changed if you
[1:05:24] respond. And I could just see he he
[1:05:27] could not he was looking everywhere but
[1:05:30] he could not face that guy and look him
[1:05:32] in the eyes and say you know what you're
[1:05:34] right. He he was probably having
[1:05:36] flashbacks. He was not fully
[1:05:37] surrendered. He was saying, "Oh, no. I
[1:05:39] might, you know, I might not have fun
[1:05:41] anymore, but
[1:05:44] I I cannot see any boredom in the in the
[1:05:48] in the life of a message believer at
[1:05:50] all. There's never a dull moment." Hey,
[1:05:52] brother Gabin.
[1:05:54] Praise the Lord. Musicians, you can come
[1:05:57] and we can sing a song of worship. Um,
[1:06:04] yeah.
[1:06:11] be that glimmer of hope for for someone
[1:06:13] in and out there in the world, someone
[1:06:16] in your family, your workplace. Um that
[1:06:20] that sliver of that white light, you
[1:06:23] know, uh of that new moon coming, that
[1:06:26] new season that's coming. We know what
[1:06:29] that means for us, but some somebody
[1:06:32] might not know.
[1:06:35] Cara, do you have a song?
[1:06:37] &gt;&gt; I exalt thee.
[1:06:39] &gt;&gt; Oh, beautiful. Okay. I exalt thee. Um I
[1:06:43] think um yeah, we start singing and then
[1:06:45] um I'll hand it over to you, brother
[1:06:47] Ben. Yep.
[1:06:49] Amen.
[1:06:51] You can stand
[1:07:00] [Music]
[1:07:07] above all the earth.
[1:07:15] Thou art exalted.
[1:07:20] far above.
[1:07:23] Oh
[1:07:25] God
[1:07:32] [Music]
[1:07:38] of all the earth
[1:07:47] exalted
[1:07:51] our above.
[1:07:54] Oh,
[1:07:56] [Music]
[1:07:57] we sing. I exalt thee.
[1:08:01] I exalt
[1:08:05] thee. I exalt thee.
[1:08:09] I exalt.
[1:08:14] I exalt thee.
[1:08:17] I exalt
[1:08:20] thee.
[1:08:24] Oh
[1:08:26] Lord,
[1:08:29] I exalt thee.
[1:08:32] I exalt
[1:08:36] thee.
[1:08:39] Oh, I exalt
[1:08:43] thee.
[1:08:47] Oh, why it's so
[1:08:51] deep?
[1:08:55] Oh,
[1:09:01] amen.
[1:09:02] Praise the Lord. Isn't that It's so
[1:09:04] amazing when you look at, you know, the
[1:09:06] feast of trumpets. You can have your
[1:09:08] seats. Um,
[1:09:11] you know, and as the end was bringing
[1:09:13] out, there's, you know, the Jewish
[1:09:15] people are looking and trying to work
[1:09:17] out dates and sincerely trying to look
[1:09:19] into things where they're at. And isn't
[1:09:21] it amazing that we've had a prophet come
[1:09:23] and say, "The Feast of Trumpets has
[1:09:26] happened. They're gathered back to
[1:09:27] Israel. First time in over 2,000 years,
[1:09:30] they're a nation again. They don't even
[1:09:32] know really how they got there exactly,
[1:09:34] but they're there. Why? There's a
[1:09:37] gathering for them to recognize the true
[1:09:39] Messiah. Amen. It's the same thing as
[1:09:42] us. The message has gone forth. The
[1:09:43] trumpet is sounded. It's a gathering of
[1:09:45] the bride to the bridegroom.
[1:09:48] Amen. So, we live in a phenomenal time.
[1:09:52] But I'm so thankful. You know, a
[1:09:53] prophet, you know, Brother Bram stood up
[1:09:55] and said, "The feast of the trumpets,
[1:09:57] it's happened." Just so you know how it
[1:10:00] parallels where we are in time. Aren't
[1:10:01] you glad we've had a vindicated message
[1:10:04] &gt;&gt; to tell you where you are in time, but
[1:10:07] not just to get you excited only about
[1:10:09] where you are, but that you would know
[1:10:11] you're part of the greatest event.
[1:10:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. Which is the rapture of the bride.
[1:10:18] You're part of that resurrected group.
[1:10:21] We're blessed.
[1:10:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. There's something in us that
[1:10:23] recognize Messiah. Recognize the
[1:10:25] anointed word in this day. Amen. So,
[1:10:27] it's an exciting day.
[1:10:30] &gt;&gt; Amen. And you say, "Well, there's so
[1:10:31] many things I want to do." As like
[1:10:32] brother Ed said, just keep planting
[1:10:34] potatoes, keep living life, be a
[1:10:35] witness, keep walking on. You know, it's
[1:10:37] amazing how brother Ram said, if he knew
[1:10:39] he was coming in the afternoon, just
[1:10:41] have a Sunday, he'd say he'd prepare for
[1:10:43] preaching, he'd go preach the service,
[1:10:45] he'd go about the day like normal. And
[1:10:49] I'm thinking, how on earth could you do
[1:10:51] that? You know, if you knew that he was
[1:10:53] going to come, say for example,
[1:10:55] uh, at 9:00 tonight,
[1:10:58] would you keep, you know, he just said,
[1:11:00] "I just keep living."
[1:11:02] I think, let's just keep shining till he
[1:11:04] takes us home.
[1:11:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. Um, so I just need a phone. Um,
[1:11:08] you got the prayer request there
[1:11:11] on our brothers and sisters. Actually,
[1:11:12] can I just grab my phone? Lily just to
[1:11:14] make sure that I'm
[1:11:17] a time of prayer.

[1:11:53] [Music]
[1:11:55] And if I look and it seems like it's
[1:11:59] broken,

[1:12:06] on the altar.
[1:12:10] And if I look and it seems like it's
[1:12:14] over,
[1:12:17] I'll lay a hallelujah

[1:13:09] no matter what I'm told,
[1:13:13] no matter how it seems,
[1:13:16] no matter what it costs,
[1:13:21] I believe.
[1:13:25] And if I look and it seems like it's
[1:13:28] broken,
[1:13:31] I'll lay a hallelujah
[1:13:34] on the altar.
[1:13:38] And if I look and it seems like it's
[1:13:42] over,
[1:13:45] I'll lay a hallelujah
[1:13:48] on the altar
[1:13:50] [Music]
