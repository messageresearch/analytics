[17:13] the sunday-school has done so
[17:15] wonderfully I let's just give them a

[17:23] Nuggets out of children
[17:38] [Music]
[21:09] [Music]
[21:35] so it's a tremendous blessing and it
[21:39] just shows the power that's that he's
[21:41] given us in this age because we're going
[21:43] to need it his brother I just called you
[21:46] brother oh well so I call him brother
[21:48] Isaac on this great day it's like I know

[22:04] don't know what tomorrow is gonna hold

[22:07] keeping power of God so I think it's
[22:10] preparing us to what we we have in store
[22:12] for us and what is ours in Christ so if
[22:16] you want to put on that slideshow the
[22:19] PowerPoint you need to know a few things
[22:22] cuz I didn't know these things I don't
[22:23] know if you knew them and I've come from
[22:25] America but I didn't know what Martin
[22:28] Byrd was so William Branham says he made
[22:32] there was a Martin Burt well sorry a
[22:34] Martin box
[22:35] he made a yeah I was like what on earth
[22:37] is a Martin box never even heard of that
[22:39] so I found out that a Martin box is
[22:42] actually a bird box and at the Martin
[22:44] Bird and that's what they look like so
[22:45] just for your knowledge and the second
[22:49] one is over here uh Hornet so they also
[22:54] call them Yellowjackets unfortunately I
[22:56] couldn't find any yellowjacket so we
[22:57] have orange jackets today they call them
[23:00] yellow jackets and you can see they're
[23:02] very big they're a lot bigger than the
[23:04] average wasp or the B so they are very
[23:08] deadly because I can you know bite you
[23:10] multiple times and and they're big so
[23:14] yeah so we can continue on with our
[23:16] story we've got Joshua in narration and

[23:58] be a blessing I'm pretty sure it will go
[24:00] ahead it is now I was moving my yard up
[24:21] there mowing my lads
[24:23] trying to get my yard mowed down around
[24:27] around I had to stop change clothes go
[24:31] in and pray for somebody come out well
[24:34] my yard was grown up before before I in
[24:38] the back before I could get the front my
[24:41] mud it would grow up and so I'm one day
[24:46] I was back in the back I was back in the
[24:50] back with my old mowing machine a mowing
[24:53] and mowing along
[24:58] trying a little power mower and I forgot
[25:02] that there was a nest of Hornets in the
[25:04] corner there and I rammed that mower
[25:08] into that and back and back there I had
[25:13] my shirt off no shirt on I hit that
[25:16] fence with that mowing machine having
[25:19] those said on in a moment's time I was
[25:22] covered all over with Hornets
[25:25] you know what they are a big nest of
[25:27] Hornets they could kill you great big
[25:31] fellows just buzzing just the buzzing oh
[25:35] I thought first it scared me then all of
[25:39] a sudden something begins to happen
[25:41] begin to quiet down then Hornets still
[25:45] buzzing around now this sounds like a
[25:48] child this sounds like a juvenile but
[25:53] God of heaven knows whether it's truth
[25:55] or not I view my stand
[25:58] then instead of trying to fight and beat
[26:01] and smack them Hornets there was some
[26:04] kind of godly love come up over me and I
[26:07] thought poor little fellows he just got
[26:10] a right to build a nest that's the way
[26:12] God made for you to protect yourself and
[26:15] I disturbed you and I'm sorry that I did
[26:18] it if I had it to do over again I
[26:23] wouldn't disturb you I didn't mean to do
[26:26] it
[26:26] but I said I'm the servant of the Lord
[26:29] and his sick children is here to be
[26:31] prayed for and I got to hurry and mow
[26:34] this yard now you little creatures of
[26:36] God and the name of the of Jesus Christ
[26:39] go back in your nest
[26:41] I'll not bother you and what was it it
[26:44] was at a place where I could have been
[26:47] stung to death and in the love of God
[26:50] with submitted heart the projecting of
[26:53] love came forth and Sovereign Grace
[26:55] taken taken over what could tell those
[27:00] Hornets speak and every and every one it
[27:03] took their circle and a fly and lined up
[27:05] like a military bunch of so so the
[27:08] soldiers and went right straight they
[27:12] to the nest what was it I couldn't speak
[27:15] to the Hornets I have no way of speaking
[27:18] to them how could I keep them from
[27:21] stinging me I was at the end but I had
[27:24] love God gave love for those Hornets and
[27:27] I spoke to them in my voice and the Holy
[27:30] Spirit through Sovereign Grace guided
[27:32] those Hornets right back into their nest
[27:44] all right Hornets Yellowjackets orange
[27:48] jackets come stand up here we'll take
[27:51] our bow
[27:51] well done and that's our prayer for the
[27:56] week that these guys would take that
[27:58] same love and take it to their school
[27:59] and to their family and their friends
[28:01] who they're with ok you ready guys let's
[28:05] take a bow god bless you everyone
[28:08] [Music]
[28:09] [Applause]
[28:13] [Music]
[28:56] [Music]
[29:06] I was scared of those Yellowjackets or
[29:11] in seconds praise the Lord
[29:14] a bit of a testimony on that is some
[29:17] some other thing happened to me and
[29:20] Reuben when they were healing a hornet's
[29:23] nest and only one came out and sting
[29:26] Liam where it could have been so much
[29:27] different and it's very angry little
[29:29] things though so yeah I can I can

[45:07] you know Church lunch we'll put on a
[45:09] spread and we'll have a glorious time
[45:10] and also we have a band practice or at
[45:14] 1:30 as well tentatively to you know
[45:17] praise the Lord
[45:19] that's all that so as you've turned a
[45:22] officials 1 and 3 blessed be the God and
[45:25] father of our Lord Jesus Christ who has
[45:27] blessed us with all spiritual blessings
[45:29] in heavenly places in Christ according
[45:32] as he hath chosen us in him before the
[45:35] foundation of the world that we should
[45:38] be holy and without blame before him and
[45:40] love having predestinated us unto the
[45:44] adoption of children by Jesus Christ to
[45:46] himself according to the good pleasure
[45:48] of his will I mean let's just go to
[45:52] Romans actually chapter 8 and verse 23
[45:54] and then we'll and then we'll go to John
[45:56] 1 I just want to you know it's amazing
[45:58] the power that's in the Word of God and
[46:01] if we could just you know and I I
[46:03] believe that you know we're living in
[46:05] the great climax of the ages and it's
[46:07] just incredible where where where the
[46:10] Apostle Paul just right there that's God
[46:12] telling us he's predestinated
[46:14] us unto the adoption of children by
[46:15] Jesus Christ to himself we could just
[46:17] catch that this morning the power and
[46:20] the and the assurance of what God has
[46:23] purposed in our lives now we go to
[46:25] Romans 8 in 23 he says so he says and
[46:29] not and not only they speak of natures
[46:32] travailing waiting for the manifestation
[46:34] of the sons of God and this is an hour
[46:36] where nature truly is travailing but
[46:38] ourselves also which have the
[46:40] firstfruits of the Spirit even we
[46:42] ourselves groan within ourselves waiting
[46:45] for the adoption to wit the redemption
[46:47] of our body so we have been
[46:50] predestinated unto the adoption of
[46:52] children by Jesus Christ to himself when
[46:53] we know that fullness of adoption as the
[46:55] body change so he's predetermined our
[46:57] destiny to take a body change I mean
[47:00] let's just go to John 1 as well and
[47:09] we're gonna read from verse just just a
[47:11] living down to verse 13 here so John 1
[47:20] and 11 it says he came unto his own and
[47:22] his own received him not but as many as
[47:25] received him to them gave he power to
[47:28] become the sons of God even to them that
[47:30] believe on his name which were born not
[47:32] of blood nor the will of the flesh nor
[47:34] the will of man but of God I mean this
[47:37] bow hits prayer Lord Jesus we want to
[47:41] thank you for this moment Lord we can
[47:42] stand in your presence and give you
[47:44] praise Lord to give you glory Lord just
[47:46] to Lord just to think as your Lord
[47:48] before there was a molecule before there
[47:50] was anything Lord you determined that we
[47:52] would be predestinated unto the adoption
[47:54] of sons Lord will be placed in your
[47:56] kingdom Lord father Lord as as overcome
[47:59] as Lord father joint heirs with Christ
[48:01] and dear god I just pray father as we
[48:03] look into your scriptures this morning
[48:05] lord I pray you as the author would come
[48:07] and make it live in every heart Lord
[48:08] father we will so desire Lord you just
[48:11] touch our lives Lord you had move us
[48:13] Lord you had lift us higher Lord you
[48:14] take doubts and all condemnation away
[48:16] Lord the weaker just look into the law
[48:18] of Liberty and see Lord your blood is
[48:20] loosed us from every every chain of
[48:22] darkness Lord from our past from from
[48:24] from everything Lord there's power in
[48:26] your blood Lord and
[48:27] Lord then that's been sent it's been
[48:29] released I believe in its fullness in
[48:30] this hour that a people would take a
[48:31] body changed Lord and we just happen to
[48:34] be living in this hour Lord and you
[48:35] predestined us here Lord that we would
[48:37] we would be translated Lord from this
[48:39] world to the next world by your power of
[48:42] your of your Holy Spirit Lord so I pray
[48:44] dear God may you just Lord just just
[48:46] take all burdens away take all worry
[48:49] Lord away about where we will end up
[48:51] Lord just but just put such an assurance
[48:53] in our hearts O God and father may we
[48:55] just walk this walk with such a
[48:57] confidence knowing you're leading us
[48:58] Lord Jesus not our ability it's not us
[49:01] doing it Lord it's you doing it father
[49:02] so Lord may we babble just Lord walk out
[49:05] of these doors with such an assurance
[49:06] that we know in whom we have believed
[49:08] father may you grant it for your glory
[49:10] lord I just ask you to take the service
[49:11] under your divine control Lord for your
[49:14] glory we ask these things in Jesus
[49:16] Christ's name Amen amen god bless your
[49:19] friends you may have your seats this
[49:21] morning but I want to I just said you
[49:22] know if I could take a title I want to
[49:24] take him talk about how we are pre
[49:26] dissonant unto the adoption of children
[49:28] by Jesus Christ to himself now that's an
[49:31] incredible thought where where the
[49:32] Apostle Paul you know he came out of
[49:34] Judaism he was a Pharisee of the
[49:36] Pharisees he knew what it was like to to
[49:38] have a religion that was just purely
[49:40] works and try and earn something with
[49:42] God and try and gain favor with God with
[49:44] with how much he prayed how much he read
[49:46] how he dressed the things he didn't do
[49:48] and would do and all those things as all
[49:50] man's ability but but when he met the
[49:52] Lord on the road to Damascus everything
[49:54] changed I mean with a god that he read
[49:56] about in the scripture he realized he
[49:58] met that God on the road to Damascus and
[50:00] he realized his name was Jesus I mean it
[50:03] was no longer you know everything that
[50:04] we know that the Jehovah of the Old
[50:06] Testament as Jesus Christ of the new
[50:08] Amen so he he realized that God that
[50:11] Moses met he met there on the road to
[50:14] Damascus and then he began to tell the
[50:15] church the liberty of what they now
[50:18] possessed under the blood of Jesus
[50:20] Christ where it was no longer them
[50:21] trying to obtain something but now
[50:24] Christ had obtained all things a me but
[50:26] now now he would be able to tell them
[50:29] and to convey to them now by the power
[50:31] of the Holy Ghost you can overcome all
[50:33] things and you're actually predestinated
[50:35] to overcome all things you know when we
[50:38] talk about adoption we've got to
[50:40] understand
[50:40] in this that adoption in the Bible is
[50:42] not you know it's not like we would yes
[50:47] thank you you know it's not like
[50:49] adoption that we would think about you
[50:52] know in in our kind of culture like I
[50:54] would go to like an orphanage or I'd go
[50:56] to China I'd go somewhere and I'd get a
[50:58] child from over there and I would by
[51:00] signing a bit of paper bring them into
[51:02] my family but they're not blood relation
[51:04] to me but but by that adoption law they
[51:07] can become part of my family that is not
[51:09] Bible adoption Bible adoption means the
[51:12] placing of a son I mean so they're so a
[51:14] child that's been born into the family
[51:16] now comes and is placed in the family
[51:19] that it has the same rights ain't meant
[51:21] as the fact as the father of the family
[51:23] I mean that their word as good as the
[51:26] father's word it's as if the father is
[51:28] speaking when the child is speaking I
[51:30] mean so it's now a placing of a child in
[51:32] the family that is Bible adoption so you
[51:35] know I just really want I just pray that
[51:37] God would just take all all you know we
[51:39] put so much pressure on ourselves I pray
[51:42] God would just take the pressure off not
[51:44] not in terms of now we watch the we'll
[51:46] just go by because that's unbelief to me
[51:48] but they be telling us that we can we're
[51:50] gonna win we're gonna dance on the
[51:52] streets of gold we're going to take it
[51:53] translation I mean we're going to take a
[51:55] body change God as God has determined
[51:57] our destiny
[51:59] hallelujah God has determined our
[52:01] outcome and if we can just look through
[52:03] his eyes it doesn't matter what we face
[52:05] in life what battle we go against what
[52:07] demon power comes against us we have the
[52:10] assurance said Lord you're going to take
[52:11] us through this trial we're not gonna
[52:13] die in this battle but we can overcome
[52:15] and come through hallelujah so this is
[52:17] really where I want to go I just pray
[52:18] God will just come and you know you just
[52:20] think about what God's done for us he's
[52:23] done incredible things you know it's
[52:25] amazing the first the first prophecy of
[52:28] the of the you know of the Messiah
[52:31] coming was actually given to Adam II
[52:33] Adam and Eve and the serpent if we just
[52:36] go to let's go to Genesis chapter 3 and
[52:38] let's read this here it's incredible how
[52:43] God's determined do you know nothing's
[52:46] going to stop him
[52:46] nothing can stop them if nothing can
[52:49] stop them nothing can stop you as long
[52:52] as you fight the battle according to the
[52:54] spur
[52:54] to God not according to your carnal
[52:56] flesh you'll win amen and even if you
[52:59] fall in a fight
[53:00] I mean God wants to teach you something
[53:01] in that defeat it's not heaven that
[53:03] falls and that gets back up you may have
[53:05] been flawed by a sucker punched by the
[53:07] devil get back up hey Louie he wants a
[53:10] team
[53:10] God wants to amen let's just read here
[53:13] Genesis 3 and 15 he says and I this is
[53:20] God this is God promising this is God
[53:22] actually speaking to the serpent I'll
[53:25] put enmity between thee and the woman
[53:27] that's being to the serpent and between
[53:28] thy seed and her seed it shall bruise
[53:31] thy head and thou shalt bruise his heel
[53:34] that's the first promise of the Messiah
[53:36] coming
[53:37] you know when Abraham Lincoln would
[53:41] would would go down to the south and
[53:43] America this is during the slave days
[53:44] and he would he would he would he would
[53:47] land in a boat in Louisiana and and he
[53:49] would see the slave auction going on and
[53:51] he saw families being separated people
[53:53] just being solders just like cattle
[53:55] something rose up within him and he said
[53:58] I'll hit this thing even if it takes my
[53:59] life and he is determined I'm gonna I'm
[54:02] gonna break those shackles of slavery
[54:03] and it did cost him his life he would he
[54:06] would be assassinated there he was
[54:08] sitting in a in a theater he's up in one
[54:11] of these because he's the president he's
[54:12] up and one of the gifts you know arias
[54:14] here and a man came in and shot him and
[54:16] you know brother bran would tell a story
[54:18] that that um that that there was a feels
[54:21] an old colored man standing in a museum
[54:23] and and he was looking at a dress and a
[54:25] head a bit of blood on it this man took
[54:27] off his hat he started crying you so
[54:29] moved by what he was seeing and brother
[54:30] Brahim saw me said sir
[54:32] why you you know why he's so moved by
[54:34] this and then brother Bray I'm sore knee
[54:35] and he saw that that was the address of
[54:38] a person that was sitting next to
[54:39] Abraham Lincoln that tried to you know
[54:41] that that they've got Abraham's Abraham
[54:43] Lincoln's blood on the dress where the
[54:45] woman was trying to stop the blood
[54:46] flowing and and and and and and the old
[54:49] man said you know this man's blood
[54:50] loosed us from slavery and he is so
[54:53] moved by it and then brother and thought
[54:55] you know if a man can be so moved by by
[54:58] by just a man's blood I mean that
[55:00] actually loosened on slavery how much
[55:02] more the blood of Jesus Christ how much
[55:04] more the blood of God
[55:05] I mean that's looseness not just from
[55:07] physical slavery any better and
[55:09] spiritual slavery I mean how much more
[55:11] that should move us our God you
[55:13] purchased our Redemption you purchased
[55:15] our salvation he purchased your
[55:17] salvation your many times you think well
[55:19] I'm not worthy
[55:20] he made you worthy and we must remember
[55:22] it's not you that he looks at he looks
[55:24] at the Lamb I mean and if the Lamb is
[55:26] accepted you are accepted you know I've
[55:29] done it many times but you look at the
[55:30] Old Testament just say I'm a I'm an Old
[55:32] Testament worshiper and I know I'm
[55:34] guilty I've done something and the and
[55:37] the sin nature I'm born with this caused
[55:39] me to do it but God had put in his word
[55:41] if you just bring a lamb without blemish
[55:44] you'll be accepted so now here I am and
[55:47] I've got my lamb I've examined it the
[55:48] best I can I think well it looks pretty
[55:51] good I bring him to the priest now the
[55:52] priest who's a trust he's Justin see a
[55:55] priest and he wants to worship God
[55:57] according to you know how how how gods
[56:00] were to sit and so now as soon as the
[56:02] worshiper you just you know how you get
[56:04] a burden when things happen just like
[56:06] everything's going fine then something
[56:08] happens and your take care of it just
[56:10] the burden comes on you so no doubt this
[56:12] priest you'd see the man walking with us
[56:13] land know that a burden would come upon
[56:15] him I've got to exercise my priests
[56:18] office but he's not looking at the man
[56:20] bringing the lamb he's looking at that
[56:22] lamb he's not worried about the man and
[56:25] what he he's not worried about that
[56:27] he's look at the sacrifice because
[56:28] that's God's ordained mythos
[56:31] that's God's approach I mean that's
[56:33] God's sacrifice so now here comes the
[56:34] here comes the priest the man just goes
[56:37] to one side the priest isn't interested
[56:38] in the man remember we put out we put so
[56:41] much pressure on us but it's not the
[56:44] worshiper that the pressures on it's the
[56:46] lamb that the pressures on so now the
[56:48] priest says carve that way he brings the
[56:50] lamb he examines them all overseas of is
[56:53] there any blemish anywhere and then
[56:56] Fozzie says no the slams perfect and he
[56:58] officer on behalf of the worshiper and
[57:01] because the lamb was examined and found
[57:03] perfect the worshiper is justified by
[57:05] bringing the lamb so it doesn't matter
[57:08] what condition the worshippers in it's
[57:10] the lamb that has to
[57:11] the testing the lamb has to go through
[57:13] the examination and once it's passed the
[57:16] examination then the blood is offered
[57:18] and that blood is attributed to that
[57:21] worshipper and it's exactly the same
[57:23] thing our lamb was found perfect Pilate
[57:26] would examine him says I find no fault
[57:28] in this man I mean all their accusations
[57:30] against him were false amen this word
[57:32] was proven to be perfect
[57:34] hardly the word was proven to be perfect
[57:36] and he was offered on our behalf
[57:39] hallelujah and then well how do you know
[57:41] he is accepted he rose out of the grave
[57:42] trial
[57:44] hallelujah based on a couple of
[57:45] prophecies he did it and then he and
[57:47] then and then he comes and marries their
[57:49] weeping at the tomb and then Yoshi's
[57:50] broken and down and what's happened to
[57:52] my lord
[57:53] and then she he just says to her Mary
[57:55] changes the whole life and sure you've
[57:58] risen but then he says don't touch me I
[58:00] haven't ascended yet so I've got to take
[58:02] my blood up holy oh and then he took it
[58:05] up it was accepted he came back down he
[58:07] has now touched me handle me Thomas fill
[58:10] the holes your filler see where the
[58:11] spear winner and touch machine touch me
[58:13] yeah hallelujah
[58:15] and then the Holy Ghost came down
[58:17] proving that the sacrifice was
[58:19] vindicated so it's not the pressure is
[58:22] not on you the pressures on him I've
[58:25] done so much oh oh I've done so much
[58:28] wrong now hold on the Bible would tell
[58:30] us in Revelation 13 verse 8 and all that
[58:34] dwell upon the earth shall worship Him
[58:35] speaking of the Beast whose names are
[58:38] not written in the in the book of life
[58:40] of the lamb slain before the foundation
[58:43] of the world so we've got many times
[58:45] people take that as a negative scripture
[58:47] but to me it's a very positive scripture
[58:48] because we're going to understand before
[58:50] the foundation of the world in God's
[58:51] mind he slew him he slew the Lamb in his
[58:55] mind so before there was a molecule
[58:57] before there was anything in existence
[58:59] in his mind he already made a way for
[59:01] you I mean because now he he thought of
[59:05] you he knew what your earthly journey
[59:07] wood wood wood wood would be he knew
[59:09] what you're facing you the enemy that he
[59:11] was about to create there would come
[59:12] against you he knew the age that you had
[59:14] living and before it ever became
[59:16] material he said well I've got to make
[59:18] away for them hallelujah
[59:22] for the devil was ever created God
[59:24] thought of you and God made a way I
[59:26] meant for you to overcome the devil how
[59:29] do you think about it before because God
[59:31] always provides something before he
[59:33] gives it to his children you got to do
[59:34] this he's already made away hallelujah
[59:39] I think we can just go dancing into
[59:41] eternity right now hallelujah why
[59:44] because now so so our names are written
[59:46] in the Lamb's Book of in the book of
[59:49] life of the Lamb I mean before the
[59:51] foundation of the world now you can
[59:52] understand if God ever wrote your name
[59:55] in heaven in the Lamb's Book of Life now
[59:57] not the book of life section but the
[59:58] Lamb's Book of Life if you ever put your
[1:00:00] name there nothing can take it away as
[1:00:03] brother James hit me a quite a while ago
[1:00:05] brother Ramsay had know all the rubbing
[1:00:07] compound in the world cannot take your
[1:00:09] name off the Lamb's Book of Life it's
[1:00:11] impossible amen so if God has written
[1:00:13] your name in heaven and he always keeps
[1:00:15] perfect records Amen you cannot be lost
[1:00:18] I mean you can't be thrown away at the
[1:00:19] end you have to be there hallelujah Amen
[1:00:24] so you know I think we should just
[1:00:25] rejoice in that he say but I'm going go
[1:00:28] I feel condemnation and all that yo the
[1:00:32] problem is the devil he's a very sneaky
[1:00:33] devil you know if you look at warfare a
[1:00:37] sniper is just one man but if you but
[1:00:41] but but if a sniper is set up and he's
[1:00:43] taking out your soldiers and you can't
[1:00:45] see him that's where the danger is but
[1:00:48] as soon as he's exposed then he's gone
[1:00:50] right and it's the same thing with the
[1:00:53] vid with the devil he's like a sniper
[1:00:54] he'll hide there and he'll push I think
[1:00:57] brother and posted it on Monday Tuesday
[1:00:58] I see it's like he pushes himself into
[1:01:00] your life that he tries to fuse himself
[1:01:03] with you that you cannot identify him in
[1:01:06] your life many people wrestle with they
[1:01:09] say I'm wrestling with the flesh
[1:01:10] actually they're wrestling with the
[1:01:11] devil right and you've got to recognize
[1:01:14] this not you because the devil comes
[1:01:15] along latched himself into your life and
[1:01:18] he causes you to fall on things and he
[1:01:19] says actually it's you falling but it's
[1:01:22] actually him dragging you down but as
[1:01:24] soon as the light of the word has shone
[1:01:25] upon him then you can take out that
[1:01:27] sniper I mean then you can overcome but
[1:01:29] you've got to recognize it's the devil I
[1:01:31] mean it's not you it's the devil
[1:01:35] amen so we are we are predestinated unto
[1:01:40] the adoption or the places of children
[1:01:42] by Jesus Christ to himself now you think
[1:01:44] about the power the power that God has
[1:01:47] released in this age it's amazing the
[1:01:49] Apostle Paul you know here is a man who
[1:01:50] where where he only knew God of history
[1:01:53] he only knew how you know God was and
[1:01:56] and it was all as I said it's all an
[1:01:57] outward way oh you are working but there
[1:01:59] was no and and what he believed there
[1:02:02] was no dominion over the devil but now
[1:02:05] he would say that we are seated in
[1:02:06] heavenly places in Christ Jesus the book
[1:02:08] of Ephesians will actually say God has
[1:02:10] caused us to be seated there we're at
[1:02:13] remember it isn't us climbing up the
[1:02:14] ladder I mean to come and to become a
[1:02:17] joint heir with Christ as God actually
[1:02:18] saying I'm gonna lift you up there and
[1:02:20] that is your destiny to be seated at the
[1:02:23] right hand of God to be joint heirs with
[1:02:24] Christ that's actually where you're
[1:02:26] going to end up hallelujah so now what
[1:02:29] he is saying is that this is where but
[1:02:31] we have been pre-decide to to end up so
[1:02:34] if God has has said something that's
[1:02:37] going to happen now you just take you
[1:02:39] know as I read there in Genesis chapter
[1:02:41] 3 you know the seed of the woman is
[1:02:43] going to is going to bruise the head of
[1:02:45] the seed of the serpent you're the devil
[1:02:47] thought that all the way down why do you
[1:02:49] think Cain killed Abel because because
[1:02:51] the devil said no I'm going to stop this
[1:02:52] from happening now did it no this is so
[1:02:55] Cain killed Abel did that stop it
[1:02:57] happening no because Seth was raised up
[1:02:58] in place of Abel who who came slew and
[1:03:01] then he and then and then and then Judah
[1:03:03] couldn't have children there was all
[1:03:04] this yummy I mean even I mean your Sara
[1:03:06] was barren for 25 years trying to
[1:03:08] withstand that you know the devil trying
[1:03:10] to fight that promise but then she
[1:03:12] believed in God she she judged him
[1:03:14] faithful and she received strength to
[1:03:15] have the baby and then even Rebecca was
[1:03:18] many years barren but then God came upon
[1:03:20] the scene and she had a child and was
[1:03:22] the devil all the way down through
[1:03:24] trying to stop the seed of the woman
[1:03:25] coming I mean and then now when finally
[1:03:28] they were in Egypt and and God's Word of
[1:03:31] of you know how that be in Egypt for
[1:03:33] hundred years a strange land they'll be
[1:03:35] afflicted but then God will bring them
[1:03:36] out with a mighty hand amen and the
[1:03:38] devil knew that the time was drawing
[1:03:39] closer he inspired Pharaoh to throw all
[1:03:42] the male babies into the river and be
[1:03:44] fed to the crocodiles did that stop
[1:03:46] poseurs
[1:03:47] I mean God would orchestrate it that
[1:03:49] that the devlins
[1:03:50] I mean Pharaoh himself would actually
[1:03:52] shelter Moses feed him nourish him train
[1:03:55] him look after him in his own house Amen
[1:03:58] said the serpent bruza Holly was
[1:04:00] actually raised in the house of the one
[1:04:01] who's going to destroy holy it's the
[1:04:03] same thing with us you know we have the
[1:04:05] civilization God you know you know it
[1:04:07] features that closest is medicine
[1:04:08] there's all these great things I mean
[1:04:10] but actually we are here we are raised
[1:04:13] up in this age to tear satan's kingdom
[1:04:15] down now I'm not talking about
[1:04:17] physically overthrowing countries but
[1:04:18] actually dethroning Satan out of
[1:04:20] people's lives hallelujah Amen says cry
[1:04:24] Moses was a serpent bruiser I mean he
[1:04:27] walked into Pharaoh's Palace just an
[1:04:29] eighty old man he said let my people go
[1:04:31] God was speaking through a man
[1:04:33] hallelujah and then he and he's
[1:04:35] basically proving to Pharaoh Pharaoh we
[1:04:36] know he was the Cobra he was the king he
[1:04:40] was the God of the Egyptians yo but but
[1:04:42] a symbol was a Cobra so now here was the
[1:04:44] rod of deliverance that Moses was
[1:04:47] carrying and his isn't he saying devil
[1:04:49] I'll show you something
[1:04:50] threw down the rod it turned into a
[1:04:52] serpent then he picked it up by the tail
[1:04:54] again it became a rod and he was
[1:04:56] demonstrating to the devil devil I can
[1:04:58] loose you I can bind you I have the
[1:04:59] power to loose you I have the power to
[1:05:01] bind you and we've got to recognize by
[1:05:04] the blood of Jesus Christ that powers in
[1:05:05] the church today and then we can bind
[1:05:07] the devil we can loose the devil Pilate
[1:05:10] by the name of Jesus Christ you have we
[1:05:12] have the power to do it I mean God
[1:05:14] actually wants his children his children
[1:05:16] as I ever came I want to see you
[1:05:18] overcome and I'm going to give you the
[1:05:20] ability to overcome but it won't be you
[1:05:22] fighting the ballots me and you fighting
[1:05:23] the battle you have the pay sale but I'm
[1:05:26] not worthy to use it but Jesus died amen
[1:05:28] for you to have it holy it's not about
[1:05:31] our worthiness it's his worthiness I
[1:05:34] remember he is our righteousness and
[1:05:36] started where it's not our own
[1:05:37] righteousness he is our righteousness I
[1:05:39] mentor so if he is our righteousness and
[1:05:42] we are as righteous as God is righteous
[1:05:44] I remember the problem is we we we
[1:05:48] expect we have to have some kind of
[1:05:49] perfect walk in order to finally conquer
[1:05:52] the devil but remember it's not it's not
[1:05:54] those who have a perfect walk amen
[1:05:57] remember remember the devil puts this
[1:05:59] perfection in front of
[1:06:00] if you just come to this point if you
[1:06:02] come to this time in your and you'll
[1:06:04] walk will you never have a bad thought
[1:06:05] you never have a bad day you never have
[1:06:07] a bad week never a bad month then you
[1:06:09] can actually use the spoken word but
[1:06:11] it's never that way remember because
[1:06:14] it's not those who are perfect mature
[1:06:19] perfection I'm talking about that can
[1:06:22] use that parrots those that are under
[1:06:23] the blood
[1:06:24] I meant look at look at brother Browns
[1:06:27] own life you know he he spoke Scrolls
[1:06:30] into existence spoke storms out of
[1:06:32] existence spoke the tumor the size of a
[1:06:34] grapefruit out of existence out of his
[1:06:35] wife's wife's I'm side you know
[1:06:38] salvation was given by the power of the
[1:06:40] spoken word and credible things happen
[1:06:42] but yet he got discouraged he wanted to
[1:06:45] become you know just just be hunted cuz
[1:06:47] people rejected him he had his ups and
[1:06:49] downs right but that power of the spoken
[1:06:52] word was placed in the prophets mouth
[1:06:53] and that same powers placed in you while
[1:06:57] using the Prophet is example because he
[1:06:58] has ups and downs but yet God gave him
[1:07:01] the Paris is if you're sincere nothing
[1:07:03] will stand before your prayers not even
[1:07:04] cancer amen and we have to recognize
[1:07:07] there's no weak parts of the body of
[1:07:09] Christ I mean there's no weak parts
[1:07:11] that's all strong it's all the same
[1:07:12] strength or the same body amen so so my
[1:07:15] faith is as strong as your faith right
[1:07:17] we may have different officers but our
[1:07:20] faith is the same you know the same
[1:07:21] faith that will take me in the rapture
[1:07:23] will take you on the rapture the same
[1:07:24] revelation that will take me in the
[1:07:26] rapture that will bring the dead Saints
[1:07:27] out of the grave
[1:07:28] amen will actually be the same
[1:07:29] revelation you have amen
[1:07:32] oh but one day I'll get there no no
[1:07:35] we're here if Google Maps was saying
[1:07:40] it's that you have arrived
[1:07:41] your destination is right here right you
[1:07:45] say well I don't know if I have it God
[1:07:46] died that you'd receive it amen so you
[1:07:49] know the scripture is very clear
[1:07:52] Amos three and three would say how can
[1:07:55] two walk to your except they be agreed
[1:07:56] see you just got to agree with his word
[1:07:59] how do you how do you even receive
[1:08:01] eternal life you've got to accept his
[1:08:03] word Amen it's more than just accepting
[1:08:06] a God of history you would accept his
[1:08:07] word today you know it's it's win this
[1:08:10] Bible you see people who are predestined
[1:08:12] to eternal life doesn't
[1:08:14] we're there they accept this is God's
[1:08:16] Word they don't think it's man's
[1:08:18] interpretation they don't think well
[1:08:19] it's most translations or pulls ideas or
[1:08:21] Peters ideas they accept the whole thing
[1:08:23] as being God's Word and then when God
[1:08:25] comes across their past and shines light
[1:08:27] on its word they say all my Lord Jesus
[1:08:29] changed me to match your word right
[1:08:31] because there's something built within
[1:08:32] the seat of God to say this is God's
[1:08:34] Word
[1:08:35] amen hallelujah amen now we'll go here
[1:08:45] this is just me believers take God at
[1:08:47] His Word remember remember at templates
[1:08:51] gonna fulfill it he's gonna fulfill it
[1:08:53] you're not going to fulfill it he's
[1:08:55] gonna fulfill it I mean believers love
[1:08:57] him more than anything else
[1:08:58] believers hold fast to every promise
[1:09:01] abraham held on for 25 years but every
[1:09:04] day he got stronger why cuz physically
[1:09:06] is more impossible Holly how's this
[1:09:09] going to work out I don't know he's
[1:09:10] gonna do it he's the god of the
[1:09:12] impossible I mean if he could stand
[1:09:16] there and say let there be Sun Moon and
[1:09:17] stars in their Sun Moon and stars can t
[1:09:19] look after you in your situation I mean
[1:09:21] if he if he if he already provided a way
[1:09:24] for you to overcome that thing in your
[1:09:25] life I mean don't you think it's going
[1:09:27] to happen his word will not return unto
[1:09:29] Him void I mean so when he thought of
[1:09:32] you as being overcome by men that's not
[1:09:34] going to return to avoid empty it's
[1:09:35] gonna manifest exactly what he said it
[1:09:37] to do I mean too often we look at you
[1:09:41] know our five senses really dictate our
[1:09:43] victory we should never let our five
[1:09:45] senses dictate our victory we should
[1:09:47] just let his word has promised to us
[1:09:49] dictate our victory or not hallelujah
[1:09:51] that's what we should do we should take
[1:09:53] God at His Word irrespective of
[1:09:55] circumstance whatever it may be no I'm
[1:09:57] going to take God's Word say I'm not
[1:10:00] well we're actually the Bible says by
[1:10:01] His stripes I was healed I am healed
[1:10:03] he's the Lord God that heals all my
[1:10:05] diseases well when did that happen
[1:10:07] it happened before the foundation of the
[1:10:09] world that was done and there was
[1:10:10] manifested on the earth 2,000 years ago
[1:10:12] that's already been taken care of
[1:10:15] hallelujah believers have a sincere
[1:10:18] desire to please the Lord everything
[1:10:19] they want to do and they can put a
[1:10:22] pressure on us because we want to walk
[1:10:24] in a way that pleases God but God put
[1:10:26] that in us
[1:10:28] amen ever since it is O Lord I want to
[1:10:31] walk with you you know he did that
[1:10:33] believers know and believe that they
[1:10:35] walk with the Lord as a love affair that
[1:10:38] that love whom has word more than
[1:10:39] anything else I mean they have decided
[1:10:42] to follow Jesus no matter the cost the
[1:10:44] pain of their approach this is not and
[1:10:46] will not exempt them from temptation
[1:10:48] mind battles and trials their biggest
[1:10:50] main battle that they wrestle with is
[1:10:52] are they one of them because the devil
[1:10:55] is constantly disputing with them that
[1:10:57] they don't have the Holy Ghost and
[1:10:58] they're not one of the Lord's and they
[1:10:59] do not have the victory I pin this down
[1:11:01] a month ago isn't it right that's what
[1:11:04] he fights you with who you are in Christ
[1:11:06] do you really have it uh am I just
[1:11:10] talking to me okay you know this but
[1:11:13] there's the thing because we were
[1:11:14] sincere desire Lord I want to walk with
[1:11:16] you not that I would obtain anything but
[1:11:20] because you're so worthy you're so
[1:11:22] wonderful you hang on Calvary's tree
[1:11:24] willingly for me I mean you were marred
[1:11:27] more than any man you took my sin yes
[1:11:30] not just the physical mention you know
[1:11:31] it's more than just the physical beating
[1:11:33] and the scourging but imagine you know
[1:11:35] you remember the day when you felt that
[1:11:37] sin burden on your shoulders for you
[1:11:39] just you imagine the send burden for the
[1:11:42] whole world upon your shoulders and he
[1:11:45] went up Calvary carrying that as a man
[1:11:47] but there was a joy set before him
[1:11:49] that was you redeemed what I thought of
[1:11:54] you before the foundation of the world
[1:11:55] I'm making it weight is going to be
[1:11:56] manifested upon the earth I'm in the
[1:11:58] internet that keri hilson you don't have
[1:12:00] to live with your Sundays you don't that
[1:12:01] live with the devil no more amen but
[1:12:03] God's already paved the way amen to get
[1:12:06] rid of him hallelujah
[1:12:08] what great love the father has poured
[1:12:11] out upon us
[1:12:13] hallelujah isn't he worthy and that's
[1:12:15] why the believers like Lord you did all
[1:12:17] things the the scripture would tell us
[1:12:20] when we were his enemies he loved us
[1:12:21] well lujah but the devil comes along and
[1:12:26] says no you're not one of them you know
[1:12:28] the devil is always based on performance
[1:12:31] look at the world two religions
[1:12:33] you take the main religions of the world
[1:12:35] okay Catholicism Orthodox Christianity
[1:12:39] you take Islam you take blood
[1:12:41] some you take all those things it's all
[1:12:43] about what you do trying to evolve
[1:12:46] yourself into a spiritual realm and it's
[1:12:49] anything the charismatic grandmas well
[1:12:50] be taught how to become a prophet trying
[1:12:53] to evolve yourself into something your
[1:12:55] own ability does it that's the devil's
[1:12:58] way because it's man trying to get
[1:13:01] himself somewhere but but the the
[1:13:04] scripture tells us it's not him that
[1:13:06] will earth or him that runneth but God
[1:13:08] that shows mercy amen so it's not us
[1:13:10] trying to evolve ourselves or something
[1:13:12] it's God reaching down and lifting us up
[1:13:14] to where we're meant to be it's him
[1:13:17] reaching down hearing
[1:13:18] when he reached down his hand for me
[1:13:20] when he reached down his hand real I was
[1:13:23] lost and undone without God or somebody
[1:13:25] reach down his hand and brother Harold
[1:13:27] Hildebrandt's hit and I agree he reached
[1:13:28] way down for me I remember the arm of
[1:13:32] the Lord is not short I mean it can
[1:13:34] reach any place I can doesn't matter how
[1:13:37] deep someone else you can be so deep
[1:13:38] into spear you can't see the light at
[1:13:40] the end at the top but he can reach down
[1:13:42] past there to pick you up out of it
[1:13:44] hallelujah hallelujah so I think we
[1:13:48] should just be happy amen
[1:13:54] see the devil always tries to make us
[1:13:56] doubt what the Lord has done for us
[1:13:58] because when we hear another one's
[1:14:01] testimony he whispers to us that kind of
[1:14:04] experience didn't happen to you your
[1:14:06] experience wasn't big enough so how do
[1:14:08] you really know you met the Lord right
[1:14:13] but we must have confidence in the Lord
[1:14:15] that all our testimonies are unique to
[1:14:18] us
[1:14:18] remember God is not a cookie cutter
[1:14:20] that's not to say a sinner's prayer and
[1:14:22] walk God now you there no no God has to
[1:14:24] meet you and he'll meet you according to
[1:14:26] his word but your testimony will be
[1:14:28] different to mine mine will be different
[1:14:30] to yours but it's God drawing his
[1:14:31] children to himself to the word amen so
[1:14:35] we must understand that our testimonies
[1:14:37] are unique to us
[1:14:38] and then Lord knew what he had to do to
[1:14:41] turn our hearts to him and that his work
[1:14:44] will be will be perfect on the day of
[1:14:46] Jesus Christ now you've got to look at
[1:14:48] what is what is really the greatest
[1:14:50] miracle we can see upon the earth seeing
[1:14:53] the dead raised would be amazing
[1:14:55] I've seen storms gone I've seen tropical
[1:14:58] you know downpours go I've seen set I've
[1:15:00] seen devils cast out I've seen people
[1:15:02] healed I've seen all kinds of things but
[1:15:05] what is the greatest thing to see the
[1:15:07] greatest thing to see is a someone's
[1:15:08] heart
[1:15:09] turn to believe the full word of God
[1:15:11] that is the biggest miracle where where
[1:15:13] someone's heart was an unbelief then God
[1:15:16] comes upon that soul and now they
[1:15:18] believe that this is the word of God and
[1:15:20] it's entirely Amen as we know that the
[1:15:22] ministry the Ministry of Elijah was to
[1:15:25] turn the hearts of the people back to
[1:15:28] God now as he stood there on Mount
[1:15:30] Carmel and everything was according to
[1:15:32] the vision of the Lord he he rebuilt the
[1:15:33] altar of the Lord he had the sacrifice
[1:15:35] there the water was poured out upon it
[1:15:37] he would prance and Lord they the people
[1:15:40] know that thou art God and thou has
[1:15:42] turned their hearts back again this is
[1:15:44] in first Kings and in the fire fell as a
[1:15:47] vindication I mean that God was actually
[1:15:49] doing this the fire fell that was the
[1:15:52] proof that Elijah's ministry was true
[1:15:55] hallelujah so now we understand that
[1:15:57] John the Baptist part of his ministry
[1:15:59] was to turn the hearts of the fathers to
[1:16:03] the children so to turn the people as
[1:16:05] preaching literally turn the hearts of
[1:16:07] the people from the from the Old
[1:16:09] Testament law to receive the Messiah
[1:16:11] that was that was his ministry now we're
[1:16:14] going to ask the question how do we know
[1:16:16] that his ministry was true and how do we
[1:16:19] know he pointed out the true Messiah
[1:16:21] well I'll say it very simply because the
[1:16:22] fire fell on Pentecost the fire fell on
[1:16:26] the sacrifice it was 120 sacrifice in
[1:16:28] the Upper Room and the fire fell upon
[1:16:30] them consumed them and they walked out
[1:16:33] with that living fire in their lives
[1:16:34] that was a vindication that looked at
[1:16:37] that John the Baptist was the true
[1:16:39] prophet of Elijah with the spirit of
[1:16:42] Elijah and we can see the same thing
[1:16:44] today how do we know we've received an
[1:16:47] elijah ministry today because the fire
[1:16:49] is fallen and because the fire fell
[1:16:52] hallelujah because the fire is fell upon
[1:16:54] people the Holy Ghost God is now
[1:16:56] tabernacled and man once again I mean
[1:16:58] and what's the vindication of that we
[1:17:00] can actually take this as the Word of
[1:17:02] God I mean what was the message actually
[1:17:05] intended
[1:17:06] do take the people from the creeds and
[1:17:07] dogmas I mean back to the pure Word of
[1:17:10] God the Bible I mean and what is the
[1:17:12] message to vindicate this is the Word of
[1:17:14] God right that's why we don't have
[1:17:17] another book this is the book the whole
[1:17:19] message is in here see he says like the
[1:17:21] seals us all through the Bible I mean
[1:17:24] that you know all that they says you got
[1:17:25] from Genesis to Revelation you should be
[1:17:27] able to see any doctrine you should be
[1:17:29] I'll take it all the way through I mean
[1:17:32] so it's a vindication that the Bible is
[1:17:34] the Word of God you know it is see when
[1:17:37] people say well Paul it was just Paul's
[1:17:39] opinion they it's actually man's
[1:17:42] reasoning silver as opposed to know what
[1:17:44] he wrote is actually God's Word you see
[1:17:47] but but the Ministry of Elijah was seen
[1:17:49] to turn the hearts of the people that we
[1:17:51] actually can receive the whole Word of
[1:17:52] God because what is actually the
[1:17:54] evidence of the Holy Ghost you can
[1:17:55] receive the word right because of felt
[1:17:58] because of the Spirit that wrote the
[1:18:00] book as in you you can't deny the word
[1:18:03] that's impossible but if the Spirit of
[1:18:06] the Bible's in you and you say Amen even
[1:18:08] if I cut you deep and it does a whole
[1:18:10] bunch of yeah you're gonna use it all
[1:18:11] boy you really get burned out but it
[1:18:13] does you good at the end you know but
[1:18:15] you'll be waiting say Lord chop that
[1:18:17] pride out chop that pity party chop that
[1:18:19] complex chop that in different spirits
[1:18:21] whatever it may be I've been carrying
[1:18:23] for years that lost spirit and you know
[1:18:25] I think I'm wrestling against the flesh
[1:18:26] grunts the devil you know chop it all
[1:18:27] out of me and you will be changed
[1:18:30] hallelujah
[1:18:31] Amen why because you can take God at His
[1:18:33] Word that's the problem o people wrestle
[1:18:38] now this is not this is not Baptist
[1:18:39] theology of just saying you believe it
[1:18:41] and you have it by faith and there's no
[1:18:43] evidence of it there's actually a vendor
[1:18:44] you know your life has changed when you
[1:18:46] can receive this as the Word of God then
[1:18:49] your life changes to match the scripture
[1:18:51] but it's him doing it in us amen it's
[1:18:53] not it's not us trying to conform to
[1:18:55] something many people have tried but
[1:18:57] they bid Lee failed I mean but there's a
[1:18:59] people upon the earth and actually take
[1:19:01] God at His Word and then God pours a
[1:19:03] spirit unto them causing them to live
[1:19:05] the word as the Apostle Paul would say
[1:19:08] it's no longer I that liveth but Christ
[1:19:10] liveth in me amen and we should be able
[1:19:13] to say that have the same testimony it's
[1:19:15] no longer either liveth I mean being
[1:19:17] blind died awhile 2007
[1:19:19] that guy died September 2007 the old one
[1:19:22] and and and there's a side on him do not
[1:19:26] resuscitate right do not resuscitate
[1:19:29] that guy but now than you guys here
[1:19:32] hallelujah why cuz I died to myself and
[1:19:34] was born again by the Spirit of God
[1:19:36] because I took God at His Word yes
[1:19:39] incredible you know when you you know
[1:19:41] when when a doctor will prescribe the
[1:19:42] right medicine if you don't take it
[1:19:44] you'll you'll get sicker but if you take
[1:19:47] the doctor at his word and you believe
[1:19:48] what he's saying your faith in the
[1:19:50] medicine then you get well and then and
[1:19:52] then he can maybe have a whole bunch of
[1:19:54] time your case studies look this person
[1:19:56] took it with your same symptoms they got
[1:19:57] well this person same ages you same
[1:19:59] blood work whatever they got well that's
[1:20:01] why I'm recommending this I mean and
[1:20:03] then we could just look into the
[1:20:04] scripture and say well what happened to
[1:20:07] the people that took the same
[1:20:08] prescription amen
[1:20:11] look at the Apostles they had a Bible
[1:20:13] faith that a Bible doctrine of Bible
[1:20:15] holy ghost said took him to a Bible
[1:20:17] heaven I took them to heaven right
[1:20:18] hallelujah I mean all the believers down
[1:20:20] through the ages I mean they received
[1:20:22] the Holy Ghost that took them up in the
[1:20:23] glory so now if dr. Peters prescription
[1:20:27] worked for the Apostles and for the dim
[1:20:30] in the book of Acts amen I think we
[1:20:31] should take the same prescription right
[1:20:34] because we got case studies now we've
[1:20:36] got we've got evidence here that these
[1:20:38] people receive the Spirit of God in
[1:20:40] their lives and they overcame all the
[1:20:42] pressures of the age well what is the
[1:20:44] prescription repent and be baptized name
[1:20:46] of Lord Jesus Christ for the remission
[1:20:47] of sin and you shall receive the gift of
[1:20:49] the Holy Ghost for the promise is unto
[1:20:51] you and to your children those that are
[1:20:53] far off even as many as the Lord our God
[1:20:55] shall call and they took the
[1:20:57] prescription lorry and we're gonna shake
[1:21:00] their hands and embrace them and dance
[1:21:02] around and we're never glorious time and
[1:21:03] eternity why because they took the
[1:21:05] prescription and if it and if it worked
[1:21:07] for them it'll work for me because the
[1:21:08] medicine hasn't changed the
[1:21:10] manufacturing quality is still the same
[1:21:12] right but it's passed all the QC
[1:21:14] analysis all those things that have been
[1:21:16] proven it's still good so why don't we
[1:21:19] take it I think we should take it
[1:21:21] hallelujah amen
[1:21:25] so now brother Aaron would say in this
[1:21:29] is in God's approach to fellowship God's
[1:21:32] provided approach rather
[1:21:33] he maintained speaking of jobs he
[1:21:36] maintained a fellowship and the hours of
[1:21:38] trial and so much that he cried he said
[1:21:40] I know my Redeemer liveth when he was
[1:21:43] suffering and even his wife said job why
[1:21:45] don't you just curse God and die job was
[1:21:47] under the blood he had offered the burnt
[1:21:49] sacrifice which he knowed he was
[1:21:52] righteous because that's what God
[1:21:54] required he came under the blood and had
[1:21:57] divine fellowship with God even in the
[1:22:00] last hours of his great temptation he
[1:22:02] cried though he slay me he had all trust
[1:22:05] them amen that's what the church needs
[1:22:07] today is their bedside well so church
[1:22:10] needs a as a no so fellowship under the
[1:22:13] blood of the Lord Jesus Christ I mean
[1:22:15] even death can't even darken it out
[1:22:19] he says I've stood by the bedside
[1:22:20] watched them die with a cold handshake
[1:22:23] I've seen them stand there and die
[1:22:24] shouting the praise of God knowing
[1:22:26] because it had fellowship they knowed
[1:22:30] where they were standing oh if I could
[1:22:31] just go through the experiences of
[1:22:33] knowing thank you hallelujah I'm looked
[1:22:37] after I like it I how I could go through
[1:22:42] experiences of knowing of experiences
[1:22:44] I've seen with people how they don't see
[1:22:47] they don't never try to don't ever try
[1:22:49] to get to God any other way than under
[1:22:51] the fellowship to fellowship with God
[1:22:53] but under the blood that's the only way
[1:22:55] God knows the only way that as God will
[1:22:58] recognize them but many people try and
[1:23:00] get to God by reasoning it's not
[1:23:03] reasonable to do those things because
[1:23:06] the church doesn't teach it no more or
[1:23:08] by just to or by just agreeing with a
[1:23:11] church but you have to get under the
[1:23:13] blood that's how you get in fellowship
[1:23:15] you got to get under the blood now but
[1:23:18] the only way to get truly under the
[1:23:20] blood is to receive the Word of God
[1:23:21] remember as Jesus would tell thee he
[1:23:25] would rebuke the scribes and Pharisees
[1:23:26] but he says by teaching the commandments
[1:23:29] and doctrines of men you may the Word of
[1:23:30] God no effect to the people if you look
[1:23:32] at the Old Testament law what was the
[1:23:34] effect that was meant to have they were
[1:23:35] dwelling in the land in peace every man
[1:23:37] under his fig tree and have his olive
[1:23:39] orchard and all those things that was
[1:23:41] actually the power those contained in
[1:23:43] the law one will chase a thousand to
[1:23:45] chase ten thousand
[1:23:46] that was the promise they had but by the
[1:23:48] time the Messiah came they had long
[1:23:50] forgotten those things I mean at least
[1:23:52] Gideon in the time of Judges had that
[1:23:54] kind of remembrance when the angel Lord
[1:23:56] came to him he says but but if God be
[1:23:59] with us were the miracles where is the
[1:24:01] God that Moses had where is the God that
[1:24:03] even Joshua had where has he gone
[1:24:05] we're still Jews were circumcised we're
[1:24:07] believers but where is that God gone see
[1:24:10] he had enough spiritual remembrance to
[1:24:11] say well if God's really with us these
[1:24:13] things should be happening right but
[1:24:15] then by the time Jesus came a man they
[1:24:18] weren't even thinking of that way they
[1:24:20] were just trying to keep their political
[1:24:21] stand in the nation and you know trying
[1:24:23] to work things out by their own
[1:24:24] reasoning but they had long forgotten
[1:24:26] the power contained even just the blood
[1:24:30] of a natural em by by taking God at His
[1:24:33] Word see but you go so he said though by
[1:24:39] teaching the commands and options and
[1:24:41] mean you make the Word of God no effect
[1:24:42] so if we want the word to have effect in
[1:24:45] our lives if we want the blood to have
[1:24:46] effect in our lives who were to take God
[1:24:48] at His Word now Jesus would would say in
[1:24:53] John and I'm just going to turn to this
[1:24:54] because my handwriting is quite scary
[1:24:55] John 5 and 46 if you want to turn with
[1:25:00] me to that we'll just go here real quick
[1:25:04] sorry John 5 and 24
[1:25:16] the Lord's here to take away all fear we
[1:25:20] don't need to worry we don't need to
[1:25:22] worry God has it all in control he says
[1:25:27] John 5:24 the words of Jesus saying
[1:25:29] verily verily I say unto you he that
[1:25:31] heareth my word and believeth on him
[1:25:33] that sent me hath everlasting life and
[1:25:36] shall not come into condemnation but is
[1:25:38] passed from death unto life
[1:25:41] now that word condemnation actually
[1:25:43] means the judgment see that heareth my
[1:25:45] word and believeth on him that sent me
[1:25:47] right hath everlasting life now not not
[1:25:51] in the future but you actually you hear
[1:25:53] the word and that hearing maxy means to
[1:25:54] understand you actually understand your
[1:25:56] your spiritualness things come open and
[1:25:58] you actually believe on him and send him
[1:26:01] so you're not just saying this man's a
[1:26:02] product from Galilee this is God in
[1:26:04] flesh and God send him upon the earth
[1:26:05] and the words he speaking is God's words
[1:26:07] right bill it he that heareth my word
[1:26:09] and believeth on him that sent me hath
[1:26:11] everlasting life so it's in their
[1:26:13] position right now right it's already in
[1:26:16] their position that's not something
[1:26:17] they'll get one day but they already
[1:26:19] have it in their possession do you
[1:26:20] realize what you have what you're
[1:26:22] packing when you get up in the morning
[1:26:23] when you go to school when you go to
[1:26:25] work when you come to church what you
[1:26:26] have you said I've got everlasting life
[1:26:28] hallelujah listen what do you think I
[1:26:32] get excited this is exciting doesn't
[1:26:34] matter what happens in life well the
[1:26:35] devil tries to do what he whispers in my
[1:26:37] ear what he threatens me with I've got
[1:26:39] everlasting life and my god is present
[1:26:42] amen - to keep me to look after me to
[1:26:45] fight my battles to keep you on the way
[1:26:48] hallelujah now notice it doesn't say
[1:26:52] anything in that verse about the
[1:26:54] person's condition that hears and
[1:26:55] believes the woman in the well was in a
[1:26:59] certain condition see the problem is we
[1:27:02] put such pressure on ourselves I'm not
[1:27:04] worthy yeah I I'm not worthy to receive
[1:27:07] the promise I'm not ready to receive the
[1:27:10] open-book and to become one with the
[1:27:12] word and prophesy again and to stand on
[1:27:14] the devil's head and stomp a little bit
[1:27:16] and overcome I'm not worthy of those
[1:27:18] things it doesn't say nothing in this
[1:27:21] verse about the condition of the person
[1:27:23] the woman of the well heard the word of
[1:27:25] God
[1:27:26] and it was just her life being discerned
[1:27:28] she was she was married five times she
[1:27:31] was now with another man not even
[1:27:32] married this is how her life was a total
[1:27:34] you know this is just how it ended up
[1:27:36] but God said Jesus said I need to go by
[1:27:38] the way of Samaria because that was one
[1:27:41] of her seed one of his predestinate seed
[1:27:43] she was pre desert unto the adoption of
[1:27:46] sons right this is where God you should
[1:27:48] end up so God when he when she was in
[1:27:51] that condition that was not where she
[1:27:53] was going to finish hallelujah so now
[1:27:56] here she was she heard the Word of God
[1:27:57] she believed we know where Messiah
[1:27:59] cometh he'll tell us all things and
[1:28:01] Jesus just took her from not future
[1:28:04] promise now it's here Here I am he that
[1:28:06] speaks the am he
[1:28:07] amen and her whole life was changed what
[1:28:11] was she now packing when she ran into
[1:28:13] Samaria come see a man that told me
[1:28:15] everything I ever did is this not the
[1:28:16] very Messiah he did heareth my word and
[1:28:19] believeth on him that sent me hath
[1:28:21] everlasting life amen you go all the way
[1:28:26] through the scripture God always takes
[1:28:29] the unlikely he takes the broken he
[1:28:33] takes the what man would call useless
[1:28:35] and God says no those are my ones
[1:28:38] because he knew what how they would
[1:28:41] respond to him Holly and then we wrestle
[1:28:44] with ourselves saying well I'm not
[1:28:46] worthy the woman who well didn't say
[1:28:47] anything about that the light struck her
[1:28:51] quicken the seed and he went off
[1:28:54] testifying and I believe she was in the
[1:28:56] upper room and I believe we'll see
[1:28:57] around the throne glory to God
[1:28:59] hallelujah amen so you know it's not our
[1:29:04] condition they shall not come into the
[1:29:09] condemnation that was still in John 5
[1:29:10] and 24 they shall not come into the
[1:29:13] condemnation so they shall not come to
[1:29:15] the judgment they shall not go to the
[1:29:18] great white throne judgment remember
[1:29:22] this is what this verse saying this this
[1:29:24] verse is saying if you hear hear if you
[1:29:27] receive if you hear my word and believe
[1:29:30] on him that sent me you have everlasting
[1:29:32] life and if you have everlasting life
[1:29:35] and you come up to a junction remember
[1:29:37] Google Maps will take you because it's
[1:29:40] two paths we end up right we're either
[1:29:43] sent with Christ and judge the world
[1:29:45] Paul said the Saints will judge the
[1:29:47] earth where the sit with Christ and
[1:29:49] judgment judging the world
[1:29:50] are we're standing before the throne
[1:29:52] being judged best of two places right so
[1:29:57] now this scripture is telling me that if
[1:30:00] God quickens his word to me I believe on
[1:30:02] him he gives me everlasting life
[1:30:04] remember if you have everlasting life at
[1:30:06] look there's a difference in your life
[1:30:08] right there's not a Baptist thing as
[1:30:10] there are I believe and there's no
[1:30:11] change the one of the world's life
[1:30:13] changed Peters life changed Paul's life
[1:30:15] changed
[1:30:16] I mean legion's life changed or that
[1:30:18] their lives are all changed and Jesus
[1:30:20] would after heal people said go and sin
[1:30:22] no more lest a worse thing come upon you
[1:30:24] so he didn't say just continue as you
[1:30:26] work go and so no more don't do the
[1:30:27] things that cause you to end up here
[1:30:29] right so so so now there's two places we
[1:30:32] end up either being judged or judging
[1:30:35] right the Saints will judge the earth so
[1:30:37] now this scripture tells me if I believe
[1:30:39] the word believe would hear my word and
[1:30:41] believe on him that sent me
[1:30:42] I can't go to stand before the throne to
[1:30:45] be judged you following me I will end up
[1:30:49] actually sitting with Christ judging the
[1:30:51] world hallelujah why does that make you
[1:30:56] rejoice because that takes all fear away
[1:30:58] I don't need to worry because that's
[1:31:01] because there's always it you're the
[1:31:03] devil always hangs in front of you
[1:31:04] you're not going to make it you'll end
[1:31:07] up being lost at the end you're not
[1:31:09] going to get there doesn't he do that am
[1:31:11] I just talking okay that's just me now
[1:31:13] man you guys are awesome I you know but
[1:31:17] this the scripture takes all the
[1:31:19] pressure off because he will because
[1:31:24] remember we are predestined and to the
[1:31:26] adoption of sons right our destiny is
[1:31:28] predetermined I don't know why people
[1:31:32] don't believe in predestination I love
[1:31:34] it
[1:31:35] it depends what side of the ledger
[1:31:36] you're on but jesus said all that come
[1:31:39] to me all no wise cast out right so
[1:31:41] people say oh I don't think I'm being
[1:31:43] called I just come anyway Lord Here I am
[1:31:45] Lord Here I am you said you wouldn't
[1:31:48] turn me down Lord Here I am Oh God if he
[1:31:52] doesn't answer come back next day Lord

[1:31:59] dwell in me Lord Here I am Here I am
[1:32:01] keep seeking keep singing and he'll open
[1:32:04] hallelujah
[1:32:05] that's what I would do that's exactly
[1:32:09] what I'd do and I can just say I did it
[1:32:13] amen let's see here we have John five
[1:32:17] and forty-six he says for had ye
[1:32:19] believed Moses you would have believed
[1:32:21] me for he wrote of me so they didn't
[1:32:24] actually take Moses writings as God's
[1:32:26] Word they just that they read it they
[1:32:29] started it but it was just Moses
[1:32:31] writings to them even though I mentally
[1:32:33] though I said yes the Word of God but
[1:32:34] actually in the hearts no I wasn't but
[1:32:37] the bride says yes
[1:32:38] that wasn't Moses writing there wasn't
[1:32:41] Paul writing that wasn't Peter writing
[1:32:43] that wasn't Malachi writing it wasn't
[1:32:45] John writing this was God taking man
[1:32:47] scribing his word down hallelujah to
[1:32:50] give it to us a weird read it at a heart
[1:32:51] of faith I mean and God will quicken
[1:32:53] that word to our lives and it would
[1:32:55] manifest earlier so we can't go the
[1:32:57] bride can't go to the judgment and be
[1:32:59] judged mimic Christ took our judgment on
[1:33:02] Calvary the wrath that we should have
[1:33:04] received was poured out on him I mean
[1:33:06] the judgment you should have received
[1:33:07] was poured out on him I mean he took out
[1:33:09] judgment he took the judgment of God
[1:33:11] remember remember a law without a
[1:33:13] penalty is not a law right and our God
[1:33:17] is a righteous judge remember he's he he
[1:33:19] he is full of grace he's full of truth
[1:33:21] he's a loving father and all those
[1:33:23] things measles are God of judgment right
[1:33:25] you can't have half of God you got to
[1:33:26] have the whole thing so now the penalty
[1:33:29] the penalty of US law is the day you
[1:33:30] either of the day you shall die son had
[1:33:32] to be judged right so God because he's a
[1:33:35] God of his word he had to cause the
[1:33:37] judgment to happen for the penalty to be
[1:33:39] met so he became a man hallelujah
[1:33:45] hallelujah
[1:33:46] you think I'm beside myself I know where
[1:33:48] I'm standing glory to God God became a
[1:33:51] man because remember what did he do in

[1:36:08] looked after no no no no you got to get
[1:36:10] that out of your mind
[1:36:11] remember when Jesus remember when the
[1:36:13] lamb was slain before the foundation of
[1:36:15] the world you know we're gonna think for
[1:36:17] a second do you think God is surprised
[1:36:20] of your life's journey upon the earth
[1:36:22] the good and the bad he's not surprised
[1:36:28] we carry guilt of something in the past
[1:36:30] he knew you'd hate he knew you'd do
[1:36:33] those things he's not in panic stations
[1:36:35] you know you know what's gonna happen
[1:36:37] today and you know you know it's like
[1:36:40] you know sports games or like the
[1:36:42] election that's going to happen in this
[1:36:44] country it's going to happen next year
[1:36:45] in America they're already projecting
[1:36:47] who's gonna win I think this is going to
[1:36:49] happen and you know you know they always
[1:36:50] give this analysis I think I think I
[1:36:52] think based on different variables and
[1:36:55] things they know you know God's not like
[1:36:57] that God is not worrying well I wonder
[1:37:00] if you know he's not thinking I wonder
[1:37:03] if brother cabins going to make it
[1:37:05] that's not how we that's not how God
[1:37:07] runs his business but I've said it be
[1:37:09] safe now you can put all your names here
[1:37:11] I trust you just did amen but you know
[1:37:15] he doesn't he doesn't just run his
[1:37:17] business well save them one day off well
[1:37:19] I guess I couldn't have them that day
[1:37:21] you know that just went wrong I don't
[1:37:23] know how that happened no that's God
[1:37:25] saved you he saved you if he redeemed
[1:37:27] you he redeemed you right I meant if he
[1:37:30] already has hallelujah it's gonna happen
[1:37:33] right it's not a you know you know what
[1:37:36] I mean if God thought of you before the
[1:37:39] foundation of the world and he saw you
[1:37:41] made in His image victorious dancing on
[1:37:43] streets of gold me and my brother BAM
[1:37:45] said that God took a photo of us at our
[1:37:48] best and put it in his family album and
[1:37:51] that's not in your this body best that's
[1:37:53] in a glorified body best by the way
[1:37:55] right and he says now everyone in the
[1:37:58] family album is going to be expressed
[1:38:00] they're going to be dipped in blood and
[1:38:02] they're going to be made into this image
[1:38:05] right and he's not free thing and
[1:38:07] whirring how's it going to work out he
[1:38:09] knows exactly how it's going to work out
[1:38:10] remember he knows the end from the
[1:38:12] biggest you're the devil so stupid you
[1:38:14] know imagine fighting a bear Menten
[1:38:17] fighting a war and you know
[1:38:19] exactly what your enemy's gonna do it's
[1:38:20] not it's not guessing right
[1:38:23] remember people you know this nation has
[1:38:25] spies everywhere spies and where's when
[1:38:28] when war is on they try and break the
[1:38:30] codes and try and work out what do you
[1:38:32] think they're gonna do they're gonna
[1:38:32] move these troops here and do all this
[1:38:34] it's it's a lot of it it's an educated
[1:38:37] guess but it's still a guess but imagine
[1:38:39] if we fought a war and when you down to
[1:38:42] the picosecond which is why the shortest
[1:38:44] measurements of time what the enemy
[1:38:45] would do where he would be imagine that
[1:38:48] you know at 1251 he'll be here and one
[1:38:52] o'clock he'll be here and he wants to go
[1:38:53] here and here and here this was going to
[1:38:55] imagine having that kind of intelligence
[1:38:57] that's the that's what God has but then
[1:39:01] imagine being the enemy knowing that
[1:39:04] your enemy no there's another devil that
[1:39:06] devil knows God knows all things but
[1:39:09] somehow he thinks he can sneak one past
[1:39:11] God and win the day this is so dumb but
[1:39:15] the devil's deceived but that's the kind
[1:39:19] of fo we fight this this is the foe
[1:39:21] God faces he knows exactly what he's
[1:39:24] going to do and when he's gonna do it
[1:39:25] how he's gonna try and do it they are
[1:39:27] and God's not worrying well I wonder how
[1:39:29] this is gonna end up he knows exactly
[1:39:30] how it's gonna end up glory and if
[1:39:35] that's about him how about you he knew
[1:39:38] we would fallen soon he knows the
[1:39:43] temptations you fight he knows when the
[1:39:45] devil tries to warm himself into your
[1:39:46] life and think it's actually you you're
[1:39:48] fighting but it's the devil he knows the
[1:39:50] thoughts that go through your mind he
[1:39:53] knows the things we battle God knows
[1:39:55] everything
[1:39:56] oh should I be terrified of that no cuz
[1:39:58] I have a lamb the Lord provided a lamb
[1:40:01] hallelujah that we don't need to worry
[1:40:05] he doesn't he said well I'm not worthy
[1:40:08] no no it's the lamb that's worthy Allu
[1:40:16] young
[1:40:22] you know there's a woman in the in the
[1:40:25] scripture and I'll just I'll just close
[1:40:26] with this there was a little on the
[1:40:28] scripture had a bloody shoe she had it
[1:40:31] quite a long time but she knew she had
[1:40:35] to get to the master and she touched the
[1:40:37] hem of His garment she has made well a
[1:40:39] few chapters later to see if I can find
[1:40:43] this that wasn't Matthew 9 Matthew 14
[1:40:52] let's see that many people touched him
[1:40:54] and were made perfectly whole it's a
[1:40:57] power of a testimony one woman did it
[1:41:00] something in the rest of people said
[1:41:02] well if that person got healed I can do
[1:41:03] the same thing and the same faith that
[1:41:06] she had because of her testimony the
[1:41:07] other people received the same faith and
[1:41:09] they did the same thing hallelujah
[1:41:12] there's a powerful testimony I mean you
[1:41:15] think about it we have we have we have a
[1:41:19] testimony God's healing power God's
[1:41:24] deliverance
[1:41:25] I mean God's keeping power God's saving
[1:41:28] grace hallelujah hey if the Philippian
[1:41:31] jailer can be there right and then Paul
[1:41:35] and Silas forgive a pre-meeting a shout
[1:41:37] and sing and praise God and God comes
[1:41:39] down and shakes the place do you know
[1:41:40] why they are thrown into prison because
[1:41:43] the jailer needed salvation many times
[1:41:46] we go through a trial we're going to
[1:41:48] understand this this more to the troll
[1:41:50] who meets the eye
[1:41:50] like I stalk about Daniel in the lion's
[1:41:52] den that lion's den was made to destroy
[1:41:54] Daniel's enemies but if we get so caught
[1:41:56] up in trouble oh well as me oh man
[1:41:58] unless you'll miss the whole picture but
[1:42:00] you've got to keep it in mind god you're
[1:42:02] doing something even if I'm going
[1:42:04] through the wringer God you're doing
[1:42:05] something and it's for my good
[1:42:07] olia so so there they were that beaten
[1:42:09] they had stripes they begin to praise
[1:42:11] and sing God I mean yo-yo singing give
[1:42:13] glory to God then the place shakes and
[1:42:15] the jailer comes and he's about to kill
[1:42:17] himself because that's how they got
[1:42:19] fired in those days being a jailer and
[1:42:21] you know he's about it but but then he
[1:42:24] hears a voice from the inner prison
[1:42:25] don't kill yourself for all here yes he
[1:42:28] heard their singing
[1:42:29] he heard their worship and he came and
[1:42:32] said what must I do to be saved
[1:42:34] believe on the Lord Jesus and thine and
[1:42:37] thy house shall be saved and the outcome
[1:42:41] was he got saved and his family got
[1:42:44] saved and if it worked for him it'll
[1:42:47] work for me hallelujah ever worked for
[1:42:50] them that his family got saved his house
[1:42:52] got saved it'll work for me and you've
[1:42:54] got to remember when Jesus went well it
[1:42:56] was Jesus as Peter was speaking through
[1:42:57] G Jesus was speaking through Peter
[1:42:59] repent be baptized name of Lord Jesus
[1:43:01] Christ for the remission of sin you
[1:43:03] shall see the gift of the Holy Ghost and
[1:43:06] it's for you and for your children many
[1:43:11] of us afar off means the Lord our God
[1:43:13] shall call sometimes people go afar off
[1:43:16] people can be even sitting in church and
[1:43:18] be afar off right but we're going to
[1:43:21] take guard as word God who's received
[1:43:23] the Holy Ghost here y'all the hell are
[1:43:25] you havin I trust you have so if you've
[1:43:27] received it it's for your children as
[1:43:31] for those are afar off as varies a lot I
[1:43:34] got your call God call them get them
[1:43:36] Lord the same Holy Ghost is in my life
[1:43:38] is for them we need to take God at His
[1:43:40] Word
[1:43:40] often they going in the wrong direction
[1:43:42] the particle son went in the wrong
[1:43:44] direction he made up his mind he got
[1:43:46] frustrated how things are going and I
[1:43:47] well I'm young and I think I can do
[1:43:49] everything and I'm gonna you know I just
[1:43:51] want to see the world and get out of
[1:43:52] this prison and don't learn another God
[1:43:55] knew it would happen but those those
[1:43:59] parents are praying sure they had to let
[1:44:02] him go but that didn't that wasn't the
[1:44:06] end they begin to pray and hardship
[1:44:09] begin to happen think about him
[1:44:12] sometimes people's worlds fall apart and
[1:44:14] they meant to his life fell apart he
[1:44:19] thought he had it all he had the money
[1:44:20] back yet his inheritance off he was
[1:44:21] going he's living it up finally I'm free
[1:44:24] of old mum and all dead and all the
[1:44:26] restrictions of the farm and I'm doing
[1:44:28] all this and his will begin to fall
[1:44:29] apart and he felt why because parents
[1:44:32] were praying thank God at His Word when
[1:44:36] Jesus said only believe he didn't say
[1:44:38] only he didn't say believe and take out
[1:44:40] everything else into consideration he
[1:44:42] said only believe what does that mean
[1:44:45] you only take God at His Word
[1:44:47] you only you don't look at the
[1:44:50] circumstances you don't see what's going
[1:44:51] on what did those parents do honey we're
[1:44:55] believers in Jehovah God the scripture
[1:44:59] tells us in Isaiah that the word shall
[1:45:01] not depart out of the mouth of my seed
[1:45:03] or my seed seed henceforth forever a son
[1:45:06] must return home I'm not willing just
[1:45:09] for half the children save they're all
[1:45:10] going to be safe we're under a promise
[1:45:13] remember God made a covenant with you
[1:45:15] and what's that that's not you making
[1:45:18] your promises to God God's made his
[1:45:20] promise to you I mean we're going to
[1:45:22] recognize that God has made a covenant
[1:45:23] with you holy and he's going to stand
[1:45:26] and he's going to keep up as into the
[1:45:28] bargain
[1:45:28] remember he said to Abraham I'm going to
[1:45:30] make your father of Nations he made a
[1:45:32] covenant with Abraham and Abraham could
[1:45:34] not fail because God said you cannot
[1:45:36] fail because everything I am I'm
[1:45:38] investing in this promise you know God
[1:45:40] put everything behind his word and he'll
[1:45:43] bankrupt heaven before one word falls to
[1:45:45] the ground hallelujah so so they begin
[1:45:49] to pray or Jehovah God bring our son
[1:45:52] home bring our son home he's gone out of
[1:45:55] his inheritance he's left bring I don't
[1:45:57] know where is bring him home and all his
[1:46:00] money dwindles and all his money
[1:46:01] dwindles what's happening God is
[1:46:03] answering prayer and God is answering
[1:46:05] prayer and then his friends leave him
[1:46:07] and there's a famine in the land what's
[1:46:08] going on God's answering prayer and then
[1:46:10] finally he's in the Pigpen and the angel
[1:46:13] Lord comes into the Pigpen and that
[1:46:16] happen easy that that spread that came
[1:46:18] upon him in the house cause of
[1:46:19] resentment of whatever it was was lifted
[1:46:21] off him and he came to himself and he
[1:46:24] just began to look at it and say my
[1:46:27] father's servants are better than a bit
[1:46:29] awfulness I'm gonna return home what's
[1:46:32] happening prayer was being answered
[1:46:34] hallelujah
[1:46:35] and then finally in the house is a peace
[1:46:37] came one evening when the prayed honey
[1:46:40] did you feel that yes juniors coming and
[1:46:46] then the father started watching from
[1:46:47] the return we're gonna have the same
[1:46:49] kind of faith I have in the same car you
[1:46:51] know how God's in control of everything
[1:46:53] many times you think all what's going to
[1:46:54] happen
[1:46:55] in control we're gonna touch there's
[1:46:58] nothing that happens upon the earth that
[1:47:00] he doesn't know about nothing I mean
[1:47:04] does think how did this why did this
[1:47:05] happen
[1:47:06] God knew it would happen right but
[1:47:08] you've got to take God at His Word for
[1:47:10] yourself you can't sit back don't say oh
[1:47:13] woe is me you know Moses was crying unto
[1:47:16] God the Red Sea was closed up you know
[1:47:18] they were you know the Egyptians are
[1:47:19] here and got a Moses Christ under God
[1:47:22] and God's is some don't cry unto me
[1:47:24] speak and move forward
[1:47:26] don't cry out speak the Word of God move
[1:47:30] forward many times we sit in the wall as
[1:47:33] me pile sure we're going to do that
[1:47:35] sometimes and and now I'm not talking
[1:47:37] about holding grief and you're gonna let
[1:47:38] grief out right gonna live out but but
[1:47:40] there comes a point where we were to
[1:47:41] where to stop saying well as me but and
[1:47:44] we'll change it from actually taking God
[1:47:46] at His Word you understand I hope that
[1:47:48] came out the right way joy don't bottle
[1:47:50] things and let it out whatever you do
[1:47:52] you got to let it out right remember a
[1:47:55] bottle you know you put too much
[1:47:56] pressure into a gas canister poof you
[1:47:59] know we're called to lid off the
[1:48:00] pressure how do you let off a pressure
[1:48:02] take all your burdens to the Lord and
[1:48:04] leave them there sure you may go to cry
[1:48:07] until you can't cry no more that's fine
[1:48:08] just let it out right but then you've
[1:48:12] got a we can't just sit back and what
[1:48:15] was me you gotta speak the Word of God
[1:48:16] and move forward they could have
[1:48:18] wallowed in their sadness I must sell
[1:48:20] Johnny and he's gone so sad and when you
[1:48:23] think your return I think you ever
[1:48:24] eternal no they said no no honey we've
[1:48:28] got a promise
[1:48:29] God gave us a promise he's going to
[1:48:32] return and then so they're so the peace
[1:48:33] came that one time just dramatizing to
[1:48:35] make it more real but you know how it is
[1:48:37] and then you know finally I said you
[1:48:38] know did you feel that peace yes he's
[1:48:40] coming home then the father begin to
[1:48:42] watch because the scripture says when
[1:48:45] when when the prodigal son was making
[1:48:47] his way home and he was feeling so
[1:48:50] condemned about what he had what he just
[1:48:52] did and what is walking out of the
[1:48:54] father saw him afar way off what was
[1:48:57] that he was watching the same path he
[1:48:59] walked down now the father's watching
[1:49:01] from to walk back that same path
[1:49:03] hallelujah and then what happened now
[1:49:05] the father ran to him said son
[1:49:08] you know the sons I'm not worthy to be
[1:49:10] called your son no more just be your
[1:49:11] servant you know God is the other father
[1:49:14] was not interested in making his son a
[1:49:16] servant because of what he did and it's
[1:49:19] the same thing with God God don't want
[1:49:21] us to be servants the blood of Jesus
[1:49:24] Christ loves her from servanthood into
[1:49:25] sonship I meant it doesn't matter what
[1:49:28] we have done that's not God's intention
[1:49:31] to make us a servant and to hold it
[1:49:33] against us he doesn't care I mean he
[1:49:35] wants us to be restored back to where we
[1:49:37] should be and so the and so the son is
[1:49:41] living with this condemnation but the
[1:49:44] father just embrace him and tells to one
[1:49:46] of his servants get the best robe get
[1:49:47] the ring kill the fatted calf my son's
[1:49:50] home take offers take off his rags of us
[1:49:55] of his harlot tree and as you know a
[1:49:57] certain take it off him bribe him with
[1:49:59] righteousness put the ring put my ring
[1:50:02] on his finger put the signet ring on his
[1:50:04] finger a minute.what he seals as yes is
[1:50:07] the same as me saying yes hallelujah my
[1:50:10] son has returned home they took God and
[1:50:14] His Word remember Jesus in a certain man
[1:50:16] had two sons I believe he is pointing
[1:50:19] out a real thing that happened but the
[1:50:22] parents took God at His Word I'll leave
[1:50:28] it there but I'll say this if that
[1:50:29] worked for them in the full of
[1:50:30] Philippian jailer same faith faith of
[1:50:36] our fathers living still hallelujah same
[1:50:39] God help them will help us he say that
[1:50:42] was 2000 years ago same God that was
[1:50:44] there as here hallelujah we just got to
[1:50:48] take God at His Word yeah you say that
[1:50:53] don't work I've heard testimony after
[1:50:56] testimony overseas I'll just give you
[1:50:58] one here's a young man he wasn't serving
[1:51:01] God they had a they had a midweek
[1:51:05] service that temperates just a few years
[1:51:07] ago God came down in a powerful way and
[1:51:09] in the Sun so so his parents and his um
[1:51:12] and his siblings they went to church son
[1:51:15] wakes up at home no one's home midnight
[1:51:18] he begins to panic
[1:51:20] where are they he tries to call them
[1:51:23] they don't answer their phones he's
[1:51:24] shouting praising God God's moving in
[1:51:26] the church and he tries to call someone
[1:51:28] else they're not there and he drives her
[1:51:30] sir someone's and the churches home
[1:51:32] that's closer you know close they're not
[1:51:34] there so he drives to church this
[1:51:36] pajamas actually damages his truck on
[1:51:38] the way and he walks into church because
[1:51:40] he thinks he's missed the rapture mmm
[1:51:43] and before he had woken up his little
[1:51:46] sister came to the front and said I want
[1:51:48] my I want my brother saved and he comes
[1:51:53] in and his pajamas saying thank god
[1:51:55] they're here and he comes and gives us
[1:51:58] life and he's a believer amen
[1:52:03] you think God can't do those things he
[1:52:07] is the same yesterday today and forever
[1:52:10] you can go through the prayer lines of
[1:52:13] the Prophet every sickness that can be
[1:52:16] named cast out healed restored renewed
[1:52:20] any problem done that could have the
[1:52:24] same God back there as here he said but
[1:52:29] I'm not worthy you're looking at the
[1:52:30] wrong thing the lamb we have a lamb
[1:52:35] what a job say why could Jobs think
[1:52:38] believe he was righteous he wasn't
[1:52:40] believing in his own righteousness he
[1:52:42] had confidence in the lamb that he
[1:52:43] offered hallelujah
[1:52:46] and if job could stand I said I must I'm
[1:52:48] righteous clay took God his word I've
[1:52:50] offered the lamb how about a perfect
[1:52:52] lamb a perfect lamb hallow that makes a
[1:52:57] people now perfect sinless sinless
[1:53:00] perfection never let the devil think get
[1:53:06] you to think you're not worthy about my
[1:53:08] past condemns me his blood will take
[1:53:10] care of that you read it Isaiah 53 he
[1:53:13] was wounded for our transgressions I've
[1:53:16] done transgressions in my life he was
[1:53:19] bruised for our iniquities the
[1:53:21] chastisement of our peace was upon him
[1:53:24] and by His stripes we were healed what
[1:53:27] did it what the Lord do I'm gonna take
[1:53:28] care of it all I'm gonna take care of
[1:53:31] everything

[1:53:34] nothing
[1:53:36] am I gonna make it well I believe I'm
[1:53:40] gonna make because he said so
[1:53:42] he promised me he's coming back for me
[1:53:46] not based on what I've done what he has
[1:53:49] done
[1:53:50] remember the key of faith unlocks every
[1:53:53] door and what does that faith it's a
