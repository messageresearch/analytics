[0:00] the Lord with um saints of like precious
[0:03] faith. It's a um it's a real privilege
[0:08] and it's not something that you'll just
[0:10] find everywhere in every
[0:12] country. It's a real privilege to to
[0:15] have to have to be to have friends that
[0:18] are believers. It's a real gift from
[0:20] God. So, a lot of people don't have
[0:21] that. Some people don't have that. You
[0:22] know, they might have one or two
[0:23] believer friends within 100 kilometers
[0:25] of them, but we have a lot here. It's
[0:27] really nice. It's really good. So, um,
[0:30] it's good to take these opportunities to
[0:32] meet together when it's only, you know,
[0:35] half an hour away by car. We've got it
[0:38] pretty easy these days,
[0:39] eh? Our life is pretty straightforward.
[0:42] Quite, it's not straightforward, but
[0:44] things have been arranged for us to make
[0:46] life reasonably easy and meeting up
[0:48] quite easy. Imagine if it was maybe a
[0:52] you know if they wanted to have
[0:54] meetings in the 1800s it would have been
[0:56] more of an a
[0:59] um there would have been a lot more
[1:00] challenges to meet together. Let's say
[1:02] if there all of us lived here in
[1:04] Wellington and it was 100 years ago.
[1:06] Yeah. It would have been a lot more
[1:07] challenging to meet together on a
[1:09] Wednesday night. You know if you lived
[1:10] on the carpety coast you're not coming
[1:11] here. Or if you if you live where we we
[1:14] live we wouldn't make it here. You know
[1:17] how would we get here? horse leave it,
[1:20] you know,
[1:21] 3:00, you know, it's it's the the
[1:25] opportunities that we have of uh I
[1:28] sometimes it's good to think about these
[1:29] things so that we don't get lazy, you
[1:31] know, not saying we are I'm not saying
[1:32] that it's just for my own mind, you
[1:33] know, I like to think about these
[1:34] things. Praise the Lord. Let's just um
[1:36] open in prayer this evening. Heavenly
[1:38] Father, we thank you that we can come

[1:47] throughout our our life, Lord. And we
[1:49] thank you for your calling to us, Lord.
[1:51] We thank you for the great revelation
[1:52] that you've granted us. Um Lord, as
[1:54] brother Brandham said, you know, we
[1:55] should pray for revelation above all
[1:57] else. And Lord, it's only by your grace
[1:58] that you've revealed yourself to us. And
[2:01] we um really appreciate that and we just
[2:05] want to come here this evening just in
[2:07] recognition of our thankfulness to you

[2:25] over to you. We pray you bless those
[2:27] that are streaming in and bless those
[2:28] that couldn't make it um this evening

[10:12] people were talking about lions, some
[10:14] lions, and Andy asked me, "Who are the
[10:15] lions? It's a team." I said, "I think
[10:17] they're an English team, you know, the
[10:19] Lions." That's what I said. They're the
[10:21] Lions. And then we found out a few days
[10:23] later they're a South African rugby
[10:25] team, the Lions. But we kind of
[10:28] concluded the only Lions we support is
[10:29] the lion of the tribe of Judah. No

[19:53] break through
[20:02] all. Hallelujah. Glory
[20:05] Lord. Hallelujah. Let's bow our heads a
[20:07] word of prayer. Gracious
[20:10] Father, Lord, we're not just looking for
[20:13] perfect love and friendship reigning in
[20:15] eternity, but Lord, we're thankful,
[20:17] Lord, that that is reigning now in us,
[20:20] Lord Jesus, that which is eternal is
[20:22] manifested in flesh once again. And
[20:25] Father, we're here, Lord, just on a
[20:27] Wednesday that we could come drink from
[20:30] the fountain. Amen. Father, you would
[20:32] renew us, Lord. Renew the inner man as
[20:34] the Apostle Paul admonished us to do.
[20:37] Yes. And Father, we thank you we can
[20:39] come into your presence, Lord. And so
[20:41] glad when we're in your presence, Lord.
[20:42] All the trials of life seem very light
[20:45] and they seem distant and not even where
[20:47] really a problem, Lord, when we're in
[20:49] your presence. And Father, that's why
[20:51] we've come just to just get strength out
[20:53] of your word tonight, Father. May you
[20:55] feed us from your hand, Lord. We just
[20:58] want to lift
[20:59] um we want to lift Sister Lindley's
[21:02] grandchildren into your presence by
[21:04] prayer, Lord. these twins, Father, born
[21:08] at 33 weeks, Lord, and they're in
[21:10] intensive care or Skoo, whatever it's
[21:13] called there. Father, I pray you would
[21:15] go and touch those little ones. Lord,
[21:18] may they grow healthy and strong. May
[21:20] their time in hospital be very short.
[21:23] Father, may you anoint them, each one.
[21:25] Father, may you just be with them. And
[21:28] Lord, may you just be with Sister
[21:30] Lindley, Lord, and and Sarah and Kanan.
[21:33] Father, may there be a real strength to
[21:35] Anna and her husband and Father, may
[21:38] they see divine love projected and may
[21:40] you bring them in because of this, oh
[21:42] God. And we want to pray for Anna down
[21:45] here as well, Lord. How the hospital's
[21:48] pretty much given her up, Lord. But
[21:52] Father, cancer, nothing will stand. As
[21:54] your prophet was told, nothing will
[21:56] stand before your prayers, not even
[21:57] cancer. And we believe that same
[21:59] anointing that was upon him is upon the
[22:01] bride. And Lord, we lift her into your
[22:04] presence by prayer once again. Father,
[22:06] that you would not allow the enemy to
[22:09] take her life. Father, that she wouldn't
[22:11] go to a endless eternity of being lost,
[22:14] but Father, that you would touch her,
[22:16] Lord, that she wouldn't just be healed,
[22:18] but she would be saved, Lord. That it
[22:21] wouldn't matter if the cancer takes her
[22:23] or not, but she would go victorious,
[22:25] full of faith from this world to the
[22:26] next, Lord. But we pray you'd also raise
[22:29] up her body, Father. you drive this
[22:31] cancer devil from her in the name of
[22:33] Jesus Christ. Father, that her and her
[22:35] family would know that you're the true
[22:36] and living God. Father, may you grant it
[22:39] for your glory. And Lord, we just ask
[22:41] you would anoint speaker and hear it one
[22:43] more time. Lord, guide us in your word
[22:45] tonight. We pray please for your glory
[22:47] alone in Jesus Christ's name, Lord. And
[22:49] if there's any other any any other
[22:51] burdens or unspoken requests on any
[22:53] hearts, Lord, I pray you'd go to meet
[22:56] those needs, Lord, for your glory. In
[22:58] Jesus Christ's name we ask, Lord.
[23:01] Amen. Amen. Thank you, brother Isaac.
[23:03] Amen. God bless you. Amen. Good evening,
[23:07] everyone. God bless you. It's great to
[23:09] have uh Sister Margaret Prime with us.
[23:11] God bless you all the way from the far
[23:13] north. Amen. Amen. She drove she's
[23:15] staying with her family in Otaki. So,
[23:16] she drove all the way to be with us
[23:18] tonight. So, God bless you. Privilege
[23:20] of, you know, to have you here. And um
[23:24] Amen. We serve a living God. Amen.
[23:27] That's right. Amen. And let's go to uh
[23:30] couple of places I'd like to read. Let's
[23:32] go to Hebrews
[23:35] 11. Chapters 1 and
[23:42] 2. I mean Hebrews 11:es 1 and
[23:47] two and
[23:53] three says, "Now faith is the substance
[23:56] of things hoped for, the evidence of
[23:58] things not seen. For by it the elders
[24:01] obtained a good report. Through faith we
[24:04] understand that the worlds were framed
[24:05] by the word of God, so that things which
[24:08] are seen were not made of things which
[24:11] do appear." Amen. and we'll go to 2
[24:14] Corinthians uh chapter
[24:21] 4. And I want to kind of continue on
[24:24] where we were on Sunday if I
[24:27] may. Now we'll go
[24:30] to I'll read from verse
[24:35] 8. He says this here, we are troubled on
[24:39] every side yet not distressed. We are
[24:41] perplexed but not in despair, persecuted
[24:44] but not forsaken, cast down but not
[24:46] destroyed, always bearing about in the
[24:48] body the dying of the Lord Jesus, that
[24:50] the life also of Jesus might be made
[24:52] manifest in our body. For we which live
[24:55] are always delivered unto death for
[24:57] Jesus' sake, that the life also of Jesus
[24:59] might be made manifest in our mortal
[25:01] flesh. So then death workketh in us, but
[25:03] life in you. We have the same spirit of
[25:05] faith according as is written, I
[25:07] believed and therefore I have spoken. We
[25:09] believe and therefore speak, knowing
[25:11] that he which raised up the Lord Jesus
[25:13] shall raise us up also by Jesus and
[25:16] shall present us with you. For all
[25:18] things are for your sakes, that the
[25:20] abundant grace might through the thanks
[25:23] uh through the thanksgiving of many
[25:24] rebound to the glory of God. For for
[25:27] which cause we faint not, but though our
[25:30] outward man perish, yet the inward man
[25:32] is renewed day by day. For our light
[25:35] affliction, which is but for a moment,
[25:37] workketh for us a far more exceeding and
[25:40] eternal weight of glory. While we look
[25:42] not at the things which are seen, but at
[25:45] the things which uh but the things which
[25:47] are not seen, for the things which are
[25:49] seen are temporal, but the things which
[25:52] are not seen are eternal. Amen. May the
[25:55] Lord bless his word. You may be seated.
[25:58] I'd like to read just one more scripture
[25:59] in Psalms chapter 19.
[26:13] Now we've we've read
[26:16] that by faith the elders obtained a good
[26:19] report and they understood that the
[26:21] whole world is made by things that are
[26:23] not seen.
[26:24] And Paul speaking to the Corinthians, he
[26:27] basically picks up the same kind of line
[26:29] of thought and he says that the things
[26:31] which are seen are temporal, but the
[26:33] things that are not seen are eternal.
[26:34] And and he and he was understanding that
[26:37] there was more to life. You know, our
[26:40] lives are not to be governed by by
[26:42] temporal things. And we can see even
[26:45] this David here in the Psalms, he he
[26:48] begins to speak about the heavens. And
[26:49] we'll just read the first part of Psalms
[26:51] 19. says, "The heavens declare the glory
[26:53] of God, and the firminant showeth his
[26:56] handiwork. They unto day utterth speech,
[26:59] and night unto night showeth knowledge.
[27:01] There is no speech, nor language, which
[27:03] their voice is not heard. Their line is
[27:06] gone out through all the earth, and
[27:07] their words to the end of the world. In
[27:10] them hath he set a tabernacle for the
[27:12] son, which is as a bridegroom coming out
[27:15] of his chamber, and rejoices as a strong
[27:19] man to run a race." His going forth is
[27:22] as the end of the heaven, and his
[27:23] circuit unto the ends of it, and there
[27:25] is nothing hid from the heat thereof. So
[27:29] David, David would look up into the
[27:32] stars, and he would begin to see that,
[27:34] you know, the the very stars in heaven
[27:37] are are speaking and they are, you know,
[27:41] we understand, brother Bram told us
[27:42] there's three Bibles. There's the stars,
[27:44] there's the there's the pyramids, and
[27:46] then we have the written word here. But
[27:48] we see that David was very aware that
[27:50] when he looked up into the stars, he was
[27:53] looking at more than uh whatever he
[27:55] comprehended them naturally to be. But
[27:57] he could see the voice of God speaking.
[28:00] And he could see that God was, you know,
[28:02] he said it didn't matter what language,
[28:05] you know, the um you know, the people on
[28:08] the earth were speaking, they the stars
[28:10] were speaking their language and they
[28:12] were declaring the glory of God. Amen.
[28:14] And his whole life, David's whole life
[28:17] from when he was anointed as a shepherd
[28:19] boy, his whole life was guided by an
[28:21] unseen hand. And we understand that we
[28:24] are living the same kind of life. You
[28:26] know, we we do not live by these five
[28:29] senses. I know this may be very
[28:30] elementary, but you got to understand
[28:32] that if faith, if if God has revealed
[28:35] his word to you in this hour, that it
[28:37] your life is not governed by your
[28:39] senses. Your your life is not governed
[28:41] by your thinking, but your life is
[28:43] governed by your faith. Amen. Amen. Your
[28:46] whole outlook on life, the way you look
[28:48] at things, how you walk through life,
[28:50] how you react to things is by your faith
[28:52] alone. I trust it is because that's how
[28:55] it's meant to be. It is not meant to be
[28:57] by your natural mind or how you know
[28:59] your culture you're from or wherever you
[29:01] know you've been born in what era you're
[29:03] raised or whatever more. But your life
[29:05] must be governed by your faith. Amen.
[29:09] Because we see in the old, you know, we
[29:11] read there in Hebrews 11 that the elders
[29:13] by faith obtained a good report and and
[29:18] Paul would would would would tell the
[29:20] Hebrews these things because the the
[29:23] elders, they lived out their portion of
[29:25] the word. You understand that, you know,
[29:26] brother Bar makes a very simple
[29:28] statement. He said that what good would
[29:30] Moses do to build an ark and and and and
[29:34] say we need to build an ark like Noah
[29:36] did because Noah lived out his message
[29:38] and then and then Moses lived out his
[29:40] message and he said what good would John
[29:42] the Baptist do bringing Moses' message
[29:44] and and he brought it all the way down
[29:46] through and he brought it into this day
[29:47] saying what good is it if the Methodist
[29:50] brought the Lutheran message you there
[29:51] you know there's a new message God is
[29:53] opening his word for every age and the
[29:56] reason that that Paul would go through
[29:58] to the uh Hebrews 11 there as he was
[30:01] showing where God revealed himself to a
[30:03] people and they were they were they were
[30:05] the interpretation of the word given to
[30:07] them. We you know we see Noah Noah you
[30:10] know he received a word I'm going to
[30:12] flood this world because of the
[30:14] wickedness of man. You've got to build
[30:16] an ark. And then so Noah's whole life
[30:19] from that point on when when he met God
[30:21] because you read Genesis chapter 6 and
[30:24] and um and and and it said but Noah
[30:27] found grace in the sight of God. So it
[30:28] wasn't that Noah was necessarily a good
[30:30] man or he was different to anyone else
[30:32] but he found grace in the sight of God.
[30:35] So God revealed himself to Noah and then
[30:37] so from that time on his faith was
[30:40] governing his life. Amen. Are you with
[30:42] me? Amen. So his whole his faith was
[30:44] governing because he because the vision
[30:46] became so real to him. I'm going to
[30:48] flood the world. And we don't know what
[30:50] language Noah spoke. We don't know what
[30:52] language God spoke to him. But his but
[30:54] but the but his faith was interpreted by
[30:57] the life he lived after that moment.
[30:59] Amen. Amen. You say, "How do you know
[31:01] it's going to flood? I'm building a
[31:03] boat." Amen. Amen. How do I, you know,
[31:05] how do you know this this boat's going
[31:07] to work? Because God gave me the
[31:09] dimensions. And so he was the his life
[31:11] was the interpretation of the word given
[31:14] to him. It's the same thing with Moses.
[31:16] You know, we could go all the way down.
[31:17] The same thing with Moses. God told God
[31:20] promised Abraham that his seed was going
[31:22] to be in a strange land in 400 years.
[31:24] And I'm going to deliver them out with a
[31:25] mighty hand and bring them back to this
[31:27] place. 400 odd years later, Moses was
[31:30] there. Amen. And he became the
[31:32] interpretation of the prophecy given to
[31:34] Abraham. Amen. because you know he was a
[31:38] you know he was 80 years old and no
[31:40] doubt he probably thought that his life
[31:41] had come to an end. You know he probably
[31:43] felt like he was a failure because we
[31:45] understand that um his parents his
[31:48] parents received a visitation and they
[31:51] knew that their son was going to be the
[31:53] deliverer. It was quickened to them and
[31:56] God arranged it in such a way that his
[31:58] mom raised him. Amen. And no doubt no
[32:01] doubt she would just been pouring into
[32:02] him as much as she could. You're a
[32:04] special child. Amen. Amen. We're
[32:06] inspired to put you into a little, you
[32:08] know, basket there and put you down the
[32:10] crocodileinfested Nile and, you know,
[32:12] but but God promised our father Abraham.
[32:15] Amen. And you're the man that's going to
[32:16] do it, Moses. And he and she would have
[32:18] been pouring that into him and it would
[32:20] never have left them. Amen. That's why
[32:23] it's always important, you know, bring
[32:26] raise your children up and I believe it
[32:29] will not depart from them. Doesn't
[32:31] matter where they go in life. I remember
[32:33] Bible. This is all I had was Bible, you
[32:35] know, bedtime Bible stories from my dad.
[32:38] I went through I I went through all
[32:40] kinds of things in the world, but that
[32:41] never left me. Amen. Amen. And so now
[32:45] Moses, so so Moses, you know, that's why
[32:48] when he was, you know, 80 odd years old,
[32:50] he probably thought his life was over,
[32:51] but then he was he was leading sheep
[32:53] down a path he would have led sheep down
[32:55] many times. And he looked aside, he saw
[32:57] a burning bush there. And he and he and
[33:00] but it wasn't just burning. It wasn't
[33:01] consumed. And it wasn't just a fire in a
[33:04] non-consuming bush, but a voice spoke
[33:05] out of it. Says, "I'm the God of
[33:07] Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob." And he, you
[33:09] know, begins to speak to him. And then,
[33:12] Brother Bram says that after that, Moses
[33:15] now his whole life. Remember, he
[33:18] believed he was the deliverer, but in
[33:20] his human faith, he failed. Yeah. Amen.
[33:23] In his human faith, he failed. But then
[33:25] when God took him on the back side of
[33:27] the desert and got Moses out of Moses
[33:29] and then God could come down and dwell
[33:30] in Moses and use him as he wanted to, he
[33:34] went down and and and brother Bram, you
[33:35] know, when you think about it, you know,
[33:37] we read the scripture and we just take
[33:38] it for granted. But here was a
[33:40] 80-year-old man. He had his children and
[33:42] his wife and he's, you know, on the back
[33:43] of a donkey. He's got a staff in his
[33:46] hand and and and brother B would say,
[33:48] you know, dramatizing it, they say,
[33:50] "Moses, where are you going?" He says,
[33:52] "I'm going down to Egypt to take over."
[33:54] And the thing is, he did it. Amen. He
[33:56] conquered the greatest nation upon the
[33:58] face of the earth. Brother Ram says,
[34:00] "One spear, one arrow could have settled
[34:02] the whole thing." He was just a little
[34:04] old man with a stick. But he was
[34:06] anointed by the spirit of God. And and
[34:09] he would speak first person to Pharaoh
[34:11] saying, "Let my people go." That was God
[34:14] speaking through Moses. Amen. And so his
[34:17] whole walk after that was now was he was
[34:21] he was the interpretation. The life he
[34:23] lived after that was the interpretation
[34:25] of the message given to him. Amen. And
[34:29] faith remember faith governed his life.
[34:31] But then now as I said on Sunday, we
[34:34] have a weak spot and the devil will use
[34:36] our own personality against us. And
[34:39] Moses had a temper. Amen. Remember this
[34:42] is under the blood of bulls and goats.
[34:43] So he could never get rid of it, you
[34:46] know, with that capacity cuz he wasn't
[34:48] under the blood of Jesus Christ. Blood
[34:50] of bulls and goats can never change the
[34:51] nature of a man. But the blood of Jesus
[34:53] Christ can. Amen. Hallelujah. And so he
[34:56] had that temper. And so when he struck
[34:59] the rock with that temper, saying, "You
[35:01] bunch of rebels, do I have to bring
[35:02] forth water for you?" That was not He
[35:04] wasn't operating by faith anymore. He
[35:06] was operating in a carnal realm. Amen.
[35:11] And so it's the same thing the same
[35:13] thing with us. Amen. Moses Moses life
[35:17] was was was uh governed by his faith.
[35:20] the revealed faith. He had David exactly
[35:24] the same way. I just want because
[35:26] remember they're a shadow.
[35:29] We are the reality. Amen. That's why you
[35:32] can go back and see yourself in these
[35:34] and it's not you putting yourself in the
[35:36] scripture. God puts you in that
[35:37] scripture. I mean, God quickens it to
[35:39] you because that's a shadow, but they're
[35:41] a shadow of you. You know, Brother Bam
[35:44] says you should see Jesus Christ in
[35:45] every scripture. And I'll say this, you
[35:47] should be able to see yourself in every
[35:49] scripture, too. Amen. Sure, you can see
[35:51] Christ and Moses and Christ and David
[35:53] and Christ and, you know, Noah and all
[35:56] these different ones, but you should be
[35:57] able to see yourself in there because
[36:00] you're the feminine part of him. Amen.
[36:02] And husband and wife are one. Amen.
[36:05] That's why we can see David. Brother
[36:07] could see himself in David. He said,
[36:09] "Remember the last sermon I preached
[36:10] before I went on the healing campaigns
[36:12] about David and Goliath, you know, and
[36:15] he said about how we got this little
[36:16] slingshot. There's all these big giants
[36:18] of unbelief in the land." And he said he
[36:20] went and slayed that giant of unbelief
[36:22] that God would, you know, cuz there was
[36:23] a, you know, at that point Pentecost was
[36:26] at lowest eb before brother went on his,
[36:29] you know, went on the, you know,
[36:30] international field there. And so, so
[36:33] there's giants of unbelief saying, "God
[36:35] is not the same yesterday, today, and
[36:36] forever." And here comes a little man.
[36:39] Amen. The prophet of, you know, you the
[36:41] prophet of Elijah coming upon the scene.
[36:44] And he preaches this sermon saying, you
[36:46] preach about David and Goliath. And then
[36:48] he went and lived out what he preached.
[36:49] Amen. Amen. Because he down that giant
[36:52] of unbelief showing that God is still
[36:53] the same. So he put himself in the
[36:55] scripture.
[36:57] Amen. And so if he can do that, you sure
[36:59] can do that. You understand? Because
[37:02] your life is the interpretation of the
[37:04] word.
[37:05] Amen. And so now David's life was
[37:08] governed by faith. And that's why he did
[37:11] not kill Saul when he could have killed
[37:12] Saul twice. You know the story, you
[37:16] know, both times, you know, the guy with
[37:18] him saying, "Now you can kill them.
[37:20] It'll be all be over." But he but he was
[37:23] he was operating in a different kind of
[37:25] realm because he knew that it was God
[37:27] that put kings in place and God took
[37:29] kings away. He was looking at an unseen
[37:31] unseen part of the world which is the
[37:33] real part. So God, so David knew the
[37:36] season whenever God ordained that he
[37:39] would leave from hurting his dad's
[37:41] sheep. And then whenever the season
[37:43] changed that he'd be on the throne,
[37:45] that's God ordained. Amen. Amen. So he
[37:48] knew in himself, he literally didn't
[37:50] have to do anything to cause himself to
[37:53] go on the throne because he could have
[37:55] done it. Look, I look look who I've got
[37:57] at the end of my spear. King Saul. Now
[37:59] I'm king. Remember, I was anointed by
[38:00] Samuel. He didn't do it that way.
[38:03] Amen. Because he knew. Remember that's
[38:06] why you have to confidence. You have to
[38:08] have confidence in the word that you've
[38:10] been called under.
[38:12] Amen. Remember he was called under a
[38:15] word. You're you know Samuel anointed
[38:17] him. You're going to be the king of
[38:18] Israel. That was the word he was anoint
[38:20] you called under. Amen. And it said when
[38:23] the anointing oil came upon him said the
[38:25] spirit of God was with him from that day
[38:26] on. Amen. And so what the what the
[38:29] prophet poured out upon David became
[38:33] manifested. It was a few years later. In
[38:35] God's eyes, he already was king. Amen.
[38:37] Because he said to Samuel, "I've
[38:39] rejected Saul. Saul is not my king." So
[38:42] in God's eyes, David was already king.
[38:45] But he had to have the character in
[38:47] order to be king. Amen. And and also man
[38:52] had to recognize that he was king.
[38:55] Yeah. Because because in in in in man's
[38:58] eyes, Saul was still king, but God had
[39:00] already rejected him as king. Amen. So
[39:03] he was called under a word, you're going
[39:04] to be king of Israel. Yeah. And he was
[39:08] so that never left him even in his days
[39:12] of being a, you know, he was a fugitive
[39:15] in his own land.
[39:17] He was a fugitive in his own land, but
[39:19] he knew he was going to be king. And
[39:21] those mighty men that gathered
[39:23] themselves to David, they knew he was
[39:25] coming into power. Amen. Amen. They knew
[39:28] he was going to be king. They were never
[39:30] there when he was anointed. They were
[39:32] probably never there when he killed
[39:33] Goliath. Yeah. Amen. But they knew there
[39:36] was something different about David.
[39:38] Amen. And they knew he was coming into
[39:40] power. They weren't looking at, oh, he's
[39:43] a fugitive. He's basically a modern-day
[39:45] terrorist and the state's trying to hunt
[39:48] him down. They didn't look at those
[39:50] things. They're looking to unseen
[39:51] things. Those men were spiritual. That's
[39:54] right. Amen. They were spiritual. They
[39:57] knew that a that a vindicated prophet of
[39:59] God had anointed David. And they knew
[40:02] that the words that Samuel spoke and the
[40:04] actions he did, they always came to
[40:06] pass.
[40:08] Amen. Are you following me? And so, and
[40:11] so David, so not only David knew it, but
[40:14] the men under him knew it. And it was
[40:16] not just and it was vindicated that they
[40:19] believed it because they did mighty acts
[40:21] that that was supernatural acts. One
[40:24] killed 300 odd men, another guy killed a
[40:26] lion and all these different kinds of
[40:28] things. And it wasn't Hollywood. It's
[40:30] not a choreographed battle. Amen. But
[40:33] they're the same anointing that was on
[40:35] David came upon them. And that was the
[40:38] vindication that they believed he was
[40:40] coming into power and he was coming into
[40:42] power. That's right. Hallelujah. Amen.
[40:45] Now you jump forward a few thousand
[40:46] years, however many. And now we know
[40:50] that our David, the Lord Jesus, is
[40:52] coming into power. Amen. Amen. We know
[40:55] soon and very soon he's going to be the
[40:56] king of David on the throne in the
[40:58] millennium. Amen. And we have gathered
[41:00] ourselves unto David. Amen. And the
[41:02] vindication that he's coming to power is
[41:04] because the same anointing that was upon
[41:06] the prophet of God and was on all the
[41:08] believers all the way down is now upon
[41:10] the bride of Christ. Amen. And when
[41:12] brother Ram said, "I must ride this
[41:14] trail again," he wasn't speaking of his
[41:16] own physical self having the same repeat
[41:19] of the same ministry. But he but God was
[41:22] speaking first person through a man
[41:24] saying the same anointing that was upon
[41:26] the prophets going to go upon a people
[41:28] and that same ministry will be lived out
[41:30] in a many membered body. Amen. Amen. So
[41:32] the anointing that was on David came
[41:34] upon his mighty men and they did the
[41:36] same things David did. David was a
[41:38] little boy. He kills a giant. Amen.
[41:42] Everything was stacked against David,
[41:43] but God was with him. Amen. Those mighty
[41:46] men, the same thing. Everything would
[41:48] have been stacked against him, but God
[41:49] was with them, and that's why they won
[41:51] the victory. But they were looking to
[41:53] the unseen. Amen. And their lives, I
[41:57] don't know what they did before that.
[41:58] It's not recorded, but their lives after
[42:00] they gathered to David, they were
[42:02] walking according to faith.
[42:05] Amen. Amen. They were walking according
[42:07] to faith.
[42:09] And it's the same thing with us.
[42:12] As I said, you have to
[42:15] recognize the word you're called under.
[42:19] Amen. Because the word the word we're
[42:22] called under in this
[42:24] day is that this message is to call a
[42:28] bride for Jesus Christ. Amen. This
[42:30] message is to call a people for a
[42:32] rapture. Amen. This message is to call a
[42:35] people that all of the works of Satan
[42:37] are under her feet. Amen. Amen. This
[42:40] message is to call an invincible army.
[42:42] Brother Bram calls you. Amen. This
[42:45] message is to call a people a super
[42:47] race, a super church. Amen. Brother Bram
[42:50] says in the rising of the sun, she is
[42:51] him. Amen. Because husband and wife are
[42:54] one. Amen. That's what this message is
[42:56] called to do. This message is to call a
[43:00] people that are victorious in every
[43:02] situation. Amen. And that's why you can
[43:05] go back and you can look at the life of
[43:06] Joseph. You know, we can just go back
[43:09] there. His life was governed by those
[43:11] dreams he had. Amen. He just had two
[43:14] dreams, but it became so real to him
[43:16] that it never left him wherever he was
[43:18] going. If he was a slave down to Egypt
[43:20] or he's in the prison in Egypt or
[43:22] wherever it was, he knew those things
[43:24] were going to come to pass. And it so
[43:26] gripped it all. Amen. That he knew it
[43:28] was going to happen. Amen. He didn't
[43:30] have a Bible to read. Amen. He had two
[43:32] dreams.
[43:34] And he knew it was going to come to
[43:35] pass. That's right. Amen.
[43:38] Same thing with Abraham. As I said, you
[43:39] read the accounts when God goes and
[43:42] speaks to Abraham. They're not that
[43:43] long. 25 years, a few minutes.
[43:47] Amen. Remember, we are the sons and
[43:49] daughters of Abraham according to faith.
[43:52] But his life was governed by that faith.
[43:56] He was looking to the unseen. He wasn't
[43:59] looking to
[44:00] this. Amen.
[44:03] Amen. He wasn't looking to this thing.
[44:05] He was looking to the word he was called
[44:07] under. That's why you've got to hold it
[44:09] very sacred and special when this
[44:12] message became alive to you. When the
[44:14] you know when this Bible became a new
[44:17] book, I trust it's become a new book to
[44:19] you where it's not stories and maybe a
[44:21] bunch of law and rules and the but you
[44:24] can see you know it becomes a personal
[44:26] love letter. Amen. I trust it's changed
[44:28] to become that. You got to hold that
[44:30] precious because you know a love letter
[44:33] is only is only revealed to someone
[44:36] that's in relationship with that that's
[44:38] written the letter. That's right.
[44:40] Hallelujah. It's not written to any you
[44:42] know someone someone can maybe try and
[44:45] unlock it and maybe understand the
[44:47] emotion and the you know the expression
[44:48] behind it but it's only that which is in
[44:51] relationship with the one writing the
[44:53] letter can really gather the depths of
[44:56] of the letter. Amen. Like it's like
[44:58] brother Bram says about you know I get a
[45:00] letter from my wife and you know she
[45:02] says well I just put the kids to bed and
[45:04] all these different things but he says
[45:05] because because I love her and I'm I'm
[45:08] in a relationship with her I can read
[45:09] between the lines and really see what
[45:12] he's saying. It's the same thing with
[45:14] the word of God. It doesn't take you off
[45:17] onto something different but you can
[45:19] read between the lines and you can see
[45:21] really what God is saying to you.
[45:24] Hallelujah. So you got to hold that very
[45:27] special. You got to hold that very
[45:28] sacred because he doesn't, you know, God
[45:31] is not a flirtter.
[45:33] Amen. He's not a womanizer. I'll put it
[45:35] that way. He has his bride. He finds
[45:38] her. He makes her fall in love with him.
[45:41] And then he just keeps revealing
[45:43] himself, drawing himself. I mean,
[45:45] drawing her to himself. Amen. That's his
[45:48] intent. That's why he sent the friend of
[45:51] the bridegroom in this last days. A lot.
[45:54] You know, John the Baptist said, you
[45:55] know, he identified himself as the
[45:57] friend of the bridegroom. He says the
[45:59] bride is with the friend of the
[46:00] bridegroom and then when the bridegroom
[46:02] comes, the friend of the bridegroom
[46:03] introduces the bride. Amen. Amen. And
[46:07] it's the same. And then, but if but if
[46:09] you looked at it in Carnalize, here's a
[46:12] man covered in a goat. I mean a camel
[46:15] skin, whatever it was, never probably
[46:17] taken a bath in his life, coming out of
[46:18] the wilderness, eating locust and honey,
[46:21] standing knee deep in the mud of the
[46:23] Jordan, saying, "Repent for the kingdom
[46:25] of God is at hand." That's a carnal
[46:27] eyes. But those who could see with
[46:30] unseen eyes, could actually identify
[46:33] this is the friend of the bridegroom.
[46:35] This is the Elijah that's going to
[46:36] introduce us to to our Messiah.
[46:39] Hallelujah. And then so they were
[46:42] looking with those kind of eyes. And so
[46:44] when he said, "I'm the friend of the
[46:46] bridegroom, they would have something
[46:49] would have anchored into their souls
[46:51] because it was, you know, it goes beyond
[46:52] just a savior or redeemer." But here
[46:55] comes the husband. Amen. To find his
[46:58] wife. A far deeper thing than just
[47:00] someone who delivers. Amen. As a
[47:02] Messiah. But now here comes the husband
[47:04] to the woman, to the bride. Amen. And
[47:07] this man who looks like some kind of
[47:09] fanatic out of the wilderness, he's the
[47:11] one that's going to unite the two
[47:12] together. Hallelujah. Amen. And then and
[47:16] then brother makes a you know makes more
[47:18] than just this statement. He says he
[47:19] says the bridegroom call will come right
[47:21] through this through this message. And
[47:24] he and he identified himself very
[47:26] clearly as Malachi 4, the Elijah to
[47:29] forun the second coming. Hallelujah.
[47:31] Amen. It's it's you know he says
[47:33] it well to me it's quite blatant. He
[47:36] doesn't leave you guessing. That's
[47:38] right. Amen. He says, "Yeah, the son of
[47:39] man being revealed." Now, he says,
[47:41] "Can't you see the son of man revealed
[47:42] in the prophetic?" Yeah. Trying to get
[47:44] the people to see this is more than a
[47:46] healing ministry. This is more than just
[47:48] a different move of some denomination.
[47:51] But now here, God sent a servant upon
[47:54] the
[47:55] earth. And that servant was backed up by
[47:58] the bridegroom himself.
[48:00] Amen.
[48:01] And that servant was sent to find a
[48:04] bride for Jesus Christ. Amen. Amen. And
[48:08] then so the words that are spoken united
[48:11] bride and bridegroom together.
[48:14] Remember faith cometh by hearing and
[48:16] hearing the word of God. As I said many
[48:18] times, you go to Acts chapter 10,
[48:19] Cornelius's house. Peter speaking words.
[48:22] And while yet Peter spake these words
[48:24] about the resurrection, the Holy Ghost
[48:26] fell upon them and they sealed into the
[48:28] kingdom. What happened? A man was
[48:30] speaking words and he united the
[48:32] bridegroom and the bride together. Amen.
[48:34] Hallelujah. Amen. Amen. Amen. And they
[48:38] could I don't know how they felt about
[48:40] it, but they would have looked back at
[48:41] that day because they were so they were
[48:45] so caught up. Here's our here's our
[48:47] brother Cornelius. He's had a visitation
[48:50] of an angel and he says, "Go to Joper
[48:52] and find this man Peter." And then he
[48:55] sends men into Joper and he finds Peter
[48:57] and God's working at Peter's end. And
[49:00] then here comes Peter in the door. Here
[49:02] comes here comes the here comes the
[49:04] manifestation of that visitation.
[49:07] Amen. I trust I'm not speaking in
[49:08] riddles. And they were so alarmed by
[49:10] that then. Well, yet Peter spake these.
[49:12] That's why the Holy Ghost fell upon
[49:14] them. Fell upon them like it did because
[49:16] they saw Cornelius would have said, you
[49:18] know, I was in prayer and an angel
[49:21] visited me. That's not normal everyday
[49:23] occurrence. and they would have been
[49:25] stirred up by these things. They believe
[49:26] what Cornelius was saying. And then here
[49:29] we have then we have the same if you
[49:31] want to jump forward 2,000 years. And
[49:33] here's a man. He says, "I met an angel
[49:35] in a cave. I was wondering about my
[49:37] mysterious birth and you know why my
[49:39] life is so different and and he was, you
[49:41] know, he begin to describe him 200 lb in
[49:43] weight, you know, here down to about
[49:45] here in a white robe and and and it was
[49:48] the angel of the Lord." And he
[49:49] identified the ministry and scripture
[49:50] and here it is. And and it wasn't just
[49:53] him saying amen. an angel in a cave, but
[49:54] that same angel came on the platform.
[49:56] Amen. Hallelujah. And the people, you
[49:59] know, those who are looking to the
[50:02] unseen.
[50:03] Amen. Because we're not looking. Many
[50:06] people were just looking for healing and
[50:08] they're looking for cancers to fall off
[50:10] and they're looking for all manners of
[50:11] diseases to be cast out. And sure,
[50:13] that's glorious because it shows Jesus
[50:15] Christ the same yesterday, today, and
[50:17] forever. But it went beyond that. Amen.
[50:20] He was a man who's going to actually
[50:22] introduce the bride. Amen. And his whole
[50:26] life, remember his life is an
[50:29] interpretation of Malachi 4. Amen. Amen.
[50:32] Amen. The first part of it. Amen.
[50:35] Because it says, "Behold, I send you
[50:37] Elijah the prophet." Amen. So his his
[50:41] whole life was an interpretation of
[50:45] Malachi 4, Luke 17:30, the son of man
[50:47] being revealed. Amen. Behold, I stand at
[50:50] the door and knock. You know, later
[50:51] saying church age, Jesus shut on the
[50:53] outside of the church. And then brother
[50:55] Bram said he moves to Tucson. Says, and
[50:57] he says, and he's basically crying on
[50:59] the tape. I've been here how much, you
[51:00] know, however long and not one of you
[51:02] pastors have invited me. And he was and
[51:04] he was eventually kicked out of the
[51:06] denomination because they couldn't take
[51:08] the truth of the word. And that's why he
[51:10] went with the full gospel businessmen at
[51:12] the end because even the Pentecostals
[51:14] turned him down.
[51:16] What? That is an interpretation of
[51:17] behold I stand at the door and knock
[51:19] because that's Jesus shut out of his own
[51:21] church and that word had to become
[51:24] flesh. That's right. That's right. Amen.
[51:26] So it was lived out. Amen. Amen. Amen.
[51:30] But then that is the only first part of
[51:32] the scripture. It's just like Jesus
[51:35] Jesus walking with the two on the way to
[51:37] Emmas. They had a six-hour sermon on
[51:40] scripture that had just been fulfilled.
[51:44] Amen. a six-hour sermon on fulfilled
[51:46] prophecy.
[51:48] But that was just half of the that's
[51:50] just half of the picture because
[51:53] remember it was no secret that that
[51:55] Jesus became flesh because it was
[51:57] prophesied all the way down through. But
[52:00] there were a people a Peter, James, and
[52:01] a John. There was a woman at the well.
[52:04] of Mary and Martha and and and and and
[52:06] all those ills and Elizabeth and you
[52:08] know all the believers there Zachcharias
[52:10] and you know they were the unexpressed
[52:13] part of the word but they were they were
[52:14] included in that prophecy. Amen. Because
[52:17] even even you know John when he would
[52:19] stand there and they would come to him
[52:21] and they would say who are you and you
[52:23] know he said art thou the Christ? He
[52:25] says no I'm not worthy to even take off
[52:27] his sandals. They say who are you? He
[52:29] says I'm the voice of one crying in the
[52:30] wilderness to prepare the way of the
[52:32] Lord. Well, when we look at that
[52:34] scripture, we just see John, but in the
[52:36] reality that he had to have a father and
[52:38] mother. Amen. Amen. So, Elizabeth and
[52:41] Zacharias, they were in that scripture
[52:42] as well. You understand? It doesn't take
[52:45] away from the word, but they were
[52:46] included in that scripture. Amen. Amen.
[52:49] There were there were a people. Remember
[52:51] the scripture tells us that Jesus would
[52:53] take a people from the Gentiles for his
[52:55] name's sake. Amen.
[52:57] So, that part was a mystery. Yeah. But
[53:02] everyone who became one with him, that
[53:06] was him taking a people for his name's
[53:08] sake. It's like, you know, it's like
[53:10] husband and wife come together. What are
[53:12] you doing? You're taking a woman for
[53:14] your name's sake. Amen. To become one
[53:17] with her. So, it wasn't a mystery when
[53:20] Jesus came or when John came. But the
[53:23] fisherman, you know, Matthew the tax
[53:26] collector, all of those ones, Paul, I
[53:28] mean, Saul who became Paul, you know,
[53:31] Jesus, Jesus, there's a scripture where
[53:33] it says that he would be a light to the
[53:35] Gentiles. And then Paul, the Apostle
[53:37] Paul picks up that same scripture and
[53:39] says, "I'm a light to the Gentiles."
[53:42] Amen.
[53:44] So, if we just read that scripture, we
[53:46] think, "Now, the Lord is a light to the
[53:48] Gentiles." But there was a there was a
[53:51] hidden part of that scripture which was
[53:52] the apostle Paul because
[53:55] remember the acts of the apostles is the
[53:58] acts of the Holy Ghost in the apostles.
[54:00] So it's just a continuation of the same
[54:03] ministry of Jesus Christ but now in a
[54:06] different form. Amen. Amen. Amen. Same
[54:09] God different form. Amen. One fullness
[54:12] of God bodily and one man. Now it's in a
[54:14] multi-membered body. Amen. And so they
[54:18] begin to the Apostle Paul before the
[54:22] road to Damascus experience, he was not
[54:25] looking to the unseen. He was a carnal
[54:27] man, a carnal religious man. He could
[54:29] quote the scripture like like no one
[54:32] ever could. He could probably stand here
[54:34] and go from Genesis to the end of
[54:35] Malachi and probably back and forth very
[54:38] easy. But he was a connally minded
[54:41] religious man. So his life was not
[54:44] governed by faith. Amen. It was just a
[54:49] human mental faith. But then when he met
[54:53] the Lord on the road to Damascus,
[54:57] now you can see history repeat itself.
[54:59] As I said, David, the reason David
[55:02] operated the way he did is because he
[55:05] was walking by faith knowing God was
[55:07] going to make him king. And it was at
[55:09] God's timing in a certain whenever that
[55:12] was he was going to become king and he
[55:15] didn't have to destroy his rivals even
[55:17] though they were trying to destroy him
[55:19] Saul you know and then now you come to
[55:22] the apostle Paul he meet he's he sees
[55:25] this light shine down he says who are
[55:27] you Lord it says I am Jesus whom you
[55:30] persecute and then you come to the end
[55:32] of the book of acts and he's talking to
[55:34] to I think you know a gripper in them
[55:37] and it and And it's quite a few years
[55:39] down the road. And he says, "I was not
[55:42] disobedient to the heavenly vision."
[55:44] Amen. So he was his whole life from that
[55:48] point down to that point. His life was
[55:50] governed by faith. Amen. He didn't know
[55:53] all the details when he met the Lord on
[55:56] the road to Damascus. He didn't know
[55:57] he's going to be shipwrecked. He didn't
[55:59] know he was going to be beaten. He
[56:00] didn't know he was going to be in
[56:01] chains. He didn't know all, you know,
[56:03] all the affliction that he received. But
[56:06] those things, he says, "But nothing
[56:08] moves me." I know I've said these things
[56:11] before, but but he could. And you got to
[56:13] put yourself in in his shoes. Amen.
[56:17] Sure, we get discouraged. Sure, the
[56:20] battle gets hard sometimes. Sure, we
[56:22] don't understand what's going on, but
[56:24] don't take, you know, you know, the
[56:26] circumstances around us. We know where
[56:28] we're going. We know where we came from.
[56:30] Amen. But it's but it's a walk of faith
[56:33] every day that we don't fully comprehend
[56:35] what's going on. But you've just got to
[56:37] rest in the fact all things work
[56:40] together for good for those that love
[56:42] God, who loves God, and who are called
[56:44] according to his purpose. And the bride
[56:46] is absolutely called according to his
[56:48] purpose. Amen. Amen. So that's why we
[56:51] have to keep our focus. You know, even
[56:54] brother Brandham, he would he would he
[56:56] would take that same text as, you know,
[56:58] Paul quoting Paul saying, "I was not
[57:00] disobedient to the heavenly vision." And
[57:03] he wasn't
[57:05] disobedient. Amen. Even though he had to
[57:08] go through great hardship and trial, you
[57:10] know, he could he could literally repeat
[57:13] Paul's words of saying, "All have
[57:15] forsaken me because all did." Amen. But
[57:18] he stood true to the commission.
[57:21] Amen. He didn't compromise with any
[57:23] system of man. He didn't buckle to any
[57:26] kind of religious pressure no matter
[57:28] what it cost him. He knew he knew what
[57:32] he was called to do.
[57:35] Amen. And you can hear him especially in
[57:37] the early early services when he's there
[57:40] and he's got a prayer
[57:41] line and the devil doesn't seem to
[57:44] budge. And he would remind Satan, "An
[57:46] angel met me in a cave."
[57:49] And he said, "If I'm sincere, nothing
[57:51] will stand before my prayers, not even
[57:53] cancer." Says, "I'm believing. The
[57:55] people are leaving. Now you have to go."
[57:58] He would remind he would remind Satan
[58:00] about that because Satan knew that that
[58:02] happened.
[58:04] Amen. So he he held that commission very
[58:07] close to his heart.
[58:09] Amen. And you have to do the same. You
[58:13] have to do the same. You've been called
[58:15] to be the bride of Christ. Amen. Amen.
[58:17] You've got to hold that real because
[58:19] we're we're commissioned. Amen. Amen.
[58:22] We're not just here to fill fill seats
[58:24] and go through a religious motion. We're
[58:27] here to be a final voice to a final age.
[58:29] Hallelujah. Amen. We're here to be a
[58:31] living Bible in front of the people.
[58:34] Doesn't matter what what they do with
[58:36] it. What they do with you is between
[58:38] them and God.
[58:39] Amen. But we are we are commissioned.
[58:42] And you got to understand when someone's
[58:44] commissioned, the person who commisss
[58:47] them to do the job backs them up.
[58:50] Amen. Hallelujah. Amen. So if I
[58:54] commission you to go do something, all
[58:56] that I am backs you up. That's right.
[58:58] That may be feel rather underwhelming,
[58:59] but that's all right. But when it comes
[59:01] to the Lord now,
[59:03] Amen. The very God of heaven has
[59:06] commissioned you. Amen. Go ye into all
[59:08] the world and preach the gospel. Amen.
[59:11] That means to demonstrate live this
[59:13] gospel. Amen. Amen. That's what you're
[59:16] commissioned to do. And if you're
[59:17] commissioned to do it, he will back you
[59:19] up. He backed up Paul. He backed up
[59:22] brother Brandon. He backed up
[59:24] David. Amen. All the believers down
[59:27] through, he backed them
[59:30] up. And so we are called, remember our
[59:33] lives, as I said, they are the shadow.
[59:36] We are the reality.
[59:38] Yeah. And so if they could walk by faith
[59:43] in that same way,
[59:45] remember when the enemy comes in like a
[59:48] flood, the Lord says he'll raise up a
[59:50] standard. Amen. Amen. And that standard
[59:54] is God in you.
[59:56] Amen. Causing you to overcome this age.
[1:00:00] Amen. Because remember, David overcame
[1:00:03] in his age. Noah overcame in his age.
[1:00:06] Abraham overcame in his age.
[1:00:08] He had pressure. It wasn't just a
[1:00:11] flowery bed of ease. His walk wasn't
[1:00:13] just easy. Amen. He didn't just sit
[1:00:16] there in a tent and everything went well
[1:00:17] for him. He had trials. He had hardship.
[1:00:21] Amen. But it was so real to him.
[1:00:25] Remember, he didn't it was so real to
[1:00:28] him he was going to have the promised
[1:00:29] son
[1:00:31] that he didn't even consider the his
[1:00:33] body or Sarah's body dead. Amen. Amen.
[1:00:36] That's how real it was.
[1:00:39] Amen. And it has to be the same.
[1:00:41] Remember, we are the sons and daughters
[1:00:43] of Abraham according to faith. That's
[1:00:44] right. Amen. So if it's revealed to
[1:00:48] you, Amen. If it's revealed to
[1:00:52] you, nothing even comes into
[1:00:55] consideration. You think he would have
[1:00:57] received his doubts? Like brother Bram
[1:01:00] says, you know, people made fun of
[1:01:02] people made fun of him. father of
[1:01:03] nations because Abraham means father of
[1:01:06] nations. Father of nations, where's your
[1:01:08] son? People would have made fun of him.
[1:01:11] How old are you? You're going to have
[1:01:13] you're going to have the child with this
[1:01:14] woman. How old's she?
[1:01:17] Amen. He would have he would have got
[1:01:18] his doubts.
[1:01:21] Remember, as it was in the days of Lot,
[1:01:23] it was the days of Noah, so shall it be
[1:01:24] when the son of man is revealed. That
[1:01:26] same son of man is being revealed in us
[1:01:29] and the bride around the world.
[1:01:32] It's an unbelieving age now. It would
[1:01:34] have been an unbelieving age in the days
[1:01:36] of Abraham, in the days of Lot.
[1:01:39] Yeah. But it was so real to him.
[1:01:43] He didn't even He staggered not at the
[1:01:45] promise of God. Amen. As it says in
[1:01:47] Romans 4, but was strong giving praise.
[1:01:49] He's fully persuaded that that which he
[1:01:52] has promised, he is able to do.
[1:01:55] Amen. So his his whole life was governed
[1:01:57] by his faith.
[1:02:00] Now, what about you?
[1:02:03] Amen. What about you? Because because
[1:02:06] that's the shadow. Many times we
[1:02:09] marvel and we should. Now, I hope this
[1:02:11] comes out right. Many times we marvel at
[1:02:14] the shadow, but the reality is greater
[1:02:16] than the shadow. Amen. Christ was
[1:02:20] greater than than Moses and all the
[1:02:22] prophets all the way down. He was the
[1:02:24] God of the prophets. Yeah. But we are
[1:02:27] the reality. They are the shadow.
[1:02:31] Amen. You following me? So if the
[1:02:35] shadow, you know, so we marvel at them,
[1:02:38] oh, what a great walk they had, but we
[1:02:41] take for granted what we have
[1:02:44] now. Amen. Cuz really, in
[1:02:48] reality, being the bride of Christ is an
[1:02:51] everyday thing. Amen. It's not it's not
[1:02:55] always incredible times in his presence
[1:02:58] though it is but it's not always that.
[1:03:00] It's everyday life. Amen. Amen. And so
[1:03:04] sometimes we think that say coming to
[1:03:07] church is really that's the main part of
[1:03:09] it. It's not the main part of it. This
[1:03:12] is the small part of it. It's every day
[1:03:14] living for the Lord.
[1:03:17] Amen. And that is really that is the
[1:03:19] incredible thing.
[1:03:22] Amen. that your life and it's not
[1:03:24] because you become a creature of habit,
[1:03:26] but it's because there's something in
[1:03:27] you that says, "I'm walking this way.
[1:03:30] I'm I'm walking with the Lord's despised
[1:03:32] few."
[1:03:34] Amen. Because I love him.
[1:03:37] Amen.
[1:03:39] And so now, maybe I just wrap this
[1:03:43] up. But we have to walk, remember, we
[1:03:46] have a greater faith in this hour. We
[1:03:49] have a greater faith in this hour than
[1:03:50] they did.
[1:03:53] Amen. Because we have received a message
[1:03:57] that will change these bodies.
[1:04:00] Amen. Not just turn them back young
[1:04:02] again or make them that they can have
[1:04:04] children, but these bodies will become
[1:04:07] young again.
[1:04:09] Yep. And remember the anointing that
[1:04:13] came upon David was just to make alive
[1:04:16] the king in David. That's right.
[1:04:18] Remember, he always was a king. From a
[1:04:21] little baby to however old he was a
[1:04:24] king. That's what God saw in him. It's
[1:04:26] like if you have any kind of seed, this
[1:04:28] is a pumpkin seed. For example, you know
[1:04:31] there's pumpkins going to come out of
[1:04:32] the seed. Amen. And when you plant it in
[1:04:34] the right environment, water it,
[1:04:36] whatever more, what do you get? You get
[1:04:38] pumpkin. That's right. Amen. And so
[1:04:40] there was a king seed in David. Amen.
[1:04:43] Amen. And all that the anointing that
[1:04:46] Samuel poured out upon him was to bring
[1:04:49] to life the life that was already in
[1:04:51] him. That was already in him. He didn't
[1:04:54] become king when the crown was put on
[1:04:56] his head. That was just the recognition
[1:04:59] of the people that now he's king. He
[1:05:01] always was king. Amen. It's like the
[1:05:04] bride of Christ. You always were the
[1:05:07] bride.
[1:05:09] Amen. You always were the bride. Just
[1:05:12] like Abraham, Moses, Moses could never
[1:05:15] not be Moses
[1:05:17] as as we know him. He always was meant
[1:05:19] to be the deliverer to take them out of
[1:05:21] Egypt. John the Baptist the same way.
[1:05:24] And it's the same thing. That's why you
[1:05:26] have to see God sees us as the bride.
[1:05:30] But because we're time people, we we're
[1:05:33] we're creatures of time. Amen. The most
[1:05:37] part because we're creatures of time.
[1:05:40] You've got to hold very dear when he's
[1:05:42] called you.
[1:05:44] Amen. And because he's called you,
[1:05:47] because remember Jesus Jesus preached
[1:05:49] many sermons. He only had 120 in the
[1:05:52] upper room. He revealed himself to 500.
[1:05:56] But you know Paul says, but only 120 of
[1:05:58] them were in the upper room. Amen. John
[1:06:01] the Baptist preached a lot of sermons
[1:06:03] for only about six months. But he but
[1:06:06] only a handful actually followed Jesus.
[1:06:09] Amen. So every a lot of people heard a
[1:06:13] lot of decibels of of you know of of
[1:06:16] word coming out but it was those who
[1:06:19] were ordained to receive it. They
[1:06:21] received it. You you understand? And
[1:06:25] that's why I say hold it there because
[1:06:27] you got to sit back and say what has
[1:06:29] this message done to me?
[1:06:32] What has it done? Amen. And that's why
[1:06:35] David could sit there and say, "What was
[1:06:37] that anointing oil that Samuel poured
[1:06:40] upon me? What is it? What does it mean
[1:06:42] to me?" And his whole life proved
[1:06:44] everything. Amen. Amen. Because he
[1:06:47] didn't go to Saul and say, "Oh, good
[1:06:48] king Saul live forever. I'll never be
[1:06:50] king." He couldn't he couldn't renounce
[1:06:53] because that call to be king was part of
[1:06:55] him. Amen. And you cannot deny part of
[1:06:58] yourself. That's right. Amen. Amen. And
[1:07:01] it's the same thing with being the bride
[1:07:02] of Christ. You could not if if the Lord
[1:07:06] has become real to you. This message is
[1:07:08] a living reality to you. You couldn't
[1:07:09] give it up. Even if you tried, you could
[1:07:12] never give it up because it's a part of
[1:07:14] you.
[1:07:16] Hallelujah. Amen. We have some musicians
[1:07:18] to
[1:07:21] come. But then we begin to
[1:07:24] understand after he's called you, then
[1:07:26] you begin to understand I'm actually an
[1:07:28] eternal being.
[1:07:30] Amen.
[1:07:32] this this this life is but a vapor and
[1:07:35] I'm glad it is. But then we begin to
[1:07:38] understand that's why that's why the
[1:07:40] prophet so incredible how God would take
[1:07:44] a man and take him from from eternity to
[1:07:47] eternity and then tell you all about it.
[1:07:51] It wasn't just to excite you when he
[1:07:52] stands there and
[1:07:54] says, "Now I'm going to tell you
[1:07:56] Christ's mystery God revealed." opening
[1:07:59] a few phrases. He says, "I'm going to
[1:08:00] tell you what was in the back part of
[1:08:01] God's mind before the foundation of the
[1:08:03] world." Amen. That's a friend of the
[1:08:05] bridegroom speaking. Amen. But the
[1:08:09] reason that God revealed, you know, the
[1:08:12] back part of No one else has ever, the
[1:08:13] Apostle Paul never said that. I'm going
[1:08:16] to tell you what was in the back part of
[1:08:17] God's mind, but God in his grace sent
[1:08:21] Elijah to reveal the back part of God's
[1:08:23] mind to show what you are.
[1:08:27] Amen. And then now when that resonates
[1:08:30] in your soul, you've got to understand
[1:08:32] why does God think of me that way?
[1:08:34] Because I was back there.
[1:08:37] Amen. And the Apostle Paul came to the
[1:08:40] conclusion that though this earthly
[1:08:42] tabernacle be dissolved, I have one
[1:08:45] waiting already.
[1:08:47] Amen. And the very reason, remember, the
[1:08:51] very reason that the word has anchored
[1:08:54] in your souls and you're living by the
[1:08:57] faith you have is because you have a
[1:08:59] body over there. Amen. God is not going
[1:09:02] to have any I I'll put it the I'll put
[1:09:05] it this way. God is not going to have
[1:09:07] any lifeless bodies over there. That's
[1:09:10] right. Everyone that has one is going to
[1:09:12] that body. Amen. And the reason that the
[1:09:16] word speaks us that is because we have a
[1:09:18] body over there. That means I'm eternal
[1:09:21] as God is eternal.
[1:09:23] Amen. So if you just hold that close to
[1:09:26] your heart, then you'll begin to walk.
[1:09:29] Then you'll begin to walk by things that
[1:09:30] are not seen because then you can
[1:09:33] realize this is just temporary. Amen.
[1:09:36] I've heard from my theophony.
[1:09:38] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:09:41] Amen.
[1:09:43] Hallelujah.
[1:09:46] Amen. Let's sing. Um, Amen. Let's just
[1:09:50] stand tonight. Let's just sing. I just
[1:09:52] want to thank you, Lord, for letting me
[1:09:53] hear your word.
[1:09:56] Hallelujah.
[1:10:00] Amen. Trials will pass. Hard times will
[1:10:03] pass. Just got to remember that. It'll
[1:10:06] pass. It's like when you have a little
[1:10:08] child and they're going through a hard
[1:10:09] stage, you just come to the conclusion,
[1:10:11] this is going to pass.
[1:10:13] Amen. And it and it helps you through
[1:10:15] it. Amen. You just got to realize, hey,
[1:10:18] this life is going to pass. Hallelujah.
[1:10:24] And I just want to thank you,
[1:10:27] Lord, for letting me hear your
[1:10:32] word. What have I done to deserve this
[1:10:37] glory revealed in me?
[1:10:42] Thanks for that special
[1:10:45] night when I saw the
[1:10:49] glorified came face to face with eternal
[1:10:53] life. And Lord, I thank thee. Oh yes,
[1:10:59] Lord, you didn't have to open my eyes.
[1:11:04] You could have easily passed me
[1:11:07] by. For the age I was living in was
[1:11:12] wretched, poor and
[1:11:16] blind. Then I heard recognizing your
[1:11:20] day. Serpent seed and perfect
[1:11:25] faith, the preach and the message of
[1:11:28] grace. And Lord, I thank you. Oh yes,
[1:11:33] Lord. And I just want to thank you,
[1:11:38] Lord, for letting me hear your
[1:11:42] word. What have I done to deserve his
[1:11:47] glory revealed in
[1:11:51] me? Thanks for that special
[1:11:55] night. When I saw the glorious light,
[1:12:01] came face to face with eternal life. And
[1:12:05] Lord, I thank
[1:12:09] thee. And I just want to thank you,
[1:12:13] Lord, for letting me hear your
[1:12:18] word. What have I done to deserve such
[1:12:22] glory revealed in me?
[1:12:27] Thanks for that special
[1:12:31] light when I saw the glorious light.
[1:12:36] Came face to face with eternal life. And
[1:12:40] Lord, I thank thee living.
[1:12:45] Not even in my wildest
[1:12:48] dreams did I think I'd see such
[1:12:53] thing as the coming of the Lord. The
[1:12:58] rapture
[1:13:01] mystery. I have heard but now I
[1:13:06] see God in simplicity.
[1:13:11] The spoken word is the original seed.
[1:13:14] And Lord, we all thank thee. Oh yes,
[1:13:19] Lord. And I just want to thank you,
[1:13:23] Lord, for letting me hear your
[1:13:28] word. What have I done to deserve such
[1:13:32] glory revealed in
[1:13:36] me? Thanks for that special
[1:13:40] night when I saw that glorious light.
[1:13:45] Came face to face with eternal life. And
[1:13:50] Lord, I thank
[1:13:54] thee. Hallelujah. I mean, let's just
[1:13:56] thank him together, shall we? Oh,
[1:13:58] gracious Lord, how thankful we are.
[1:14:01] Lord, you found us, Lord, in this dark
[1:14:03] place. Lord, we were in all kinds of
[1:14:05] different things, but Father, you found
[1:14:07] us. Lord, we weren't looking for you,
[1:14:09] Lord. You found us. We're just so glad
[1:14:11] you've transformed us, Lord, from glory
[1:14:13] to glory. Father, may you continue to do
[1:14:16] so, Lord. May we look at this world,
[1:14:18] Lord, not with eye these natural eyes,
[1:14:21] but may we look through eyes of faith,
[1:14:23] and may we look to the unseen, oh God,
[1:14:25] unto your word unto you, oh Lord Jesus.
[1:14:27] Father, may we not just take the
[1:14:29] situation for what it is, but may we
[1:14:31] take take every situation, Lord,
[1:14:33] according to your word, Lord. Father,
[1:14:35] may our minds just be your word, oh God.
[1:14:38] May we not lean upon the arm of flesh
[1:14:40] and upon our emotion or anything like
[1:14:42] that, but Lord, just just on your word
[1:14:44] only, Lord Jesus. Father, may you grant
[1:14:47] it, Lord. And I just pray you'll help
[1:14:49] us, Lord. May we may we appreciate the
[1:14:51] call that we've been called under, Lord.
[1:14:53] May we appreciate their Lord Jesus
[1:14:55] greater when you came and became real to
[1:14:58] us Lord. Father, you don't do it for
[1:15:00] everyone Lord. You do it for your
[1:15:01] children. We thank you for that Lord. We
[1:15:04] could Lord when it's like the Apostle
[1:15:06] Paul said we because we were sons where
[1:15:10] he sent forth the spirit where we cry
[1:15:11] aba father or my father my father. We're
[1:15:14] so glad we can say my father which art
[1:15:16] in heaven hallowed be thy name.
[1:15:19] Hallelujah. And we can give you praise
[1:15:20] because we know who our father is. Lord,
[1:15:23] we know where we're going at the end of
[1:15:24] these things, Lord Jesus. And we thank
[1:15:27] you this life is but a vapor. But help
[1:15:29] us to labor while it's day. Lord, help
[1:15:32] us to be a witness upon this earth for
[1:15:34] your glory. Lord, help us to live for
[1:15:36] others, dear Lord Jesus. And Father, may
[1:15:39] you be glorified everything we say and
[1:15:41] do. Father, may you grant it. And we
[1:15:43] just ask you you would just bless us,
[1:15:45] Lord. Keep us safe on the road tonight,
[1:15:48] Lord. Some of us had to travel for Lord
[1:15:50] for many many kilometers. Dear Lord I
[1:15:52] pray just keep us safe and father may
[1:15:55] you just be with us be upon our hearts
[1:15:57] and upon our minds in a greater way.
[1:15:59] Father may we just meditate upon your
[1:16:01] word father and Lord keep us safe until
[1:16:04] we gather together again Lord. And we
[1:16:07] just want to commit the service into
[1:16:08] your hands in Jesus Christ's name.
[1:16:11] Amen.
[1:16:13] Amen. Hallelujah. Amen. Let's just sing
[1:16:15] Go Tell John. Amen.
[1:16:19] Amen. Amen. First time I heard the song,
[1:16:22] this is like my amen song.
[1:16:26] Hallelujah.
[1:16:30] Amen. Is it you or do we look for
[1:16:35] another? I can hear John
[1:16:40] say. His eagle eyes were getting clouded
[1:16:45] over.
[1:16:47] seem to have lost their
[1:16:49] [Applause]
[1:16:51] way. John God's
[1:16:54] disciples went to
[1:16:58] [Music]
[1:16:58] [Applause]
[1:17:02] Jesus. Jesus sent him with a message and
[1:17:08] this is what he said.

[1:19:14] me. Did not I tell you I say
