[1:02:36] amen
[1:02:38] last night uh it's like a
[1:02:41] kind of a bit difficult as well to
[1:02:44] put in the preachers would preach and
[1:02:45] would be doing what
[1:02:47] so it was kind of very difficult for me
[1:02:50] i only told him yesterday uh
[1:02:54] uh i think it was a after supper or
[1:02:56] before supply
[1:02:58] sometime around that time amen so for a
[1:03:01] preacher it's very difficult to sort of
[1:03:03] like get something prepared during that
[1:03:05] time so he said i'll come back to you
[1:03:09] and then uh
[1:03:10] he went
[1:03:12] and then uh we we left here we're doing
[1:03:14] some duties just our cleaning
[1:03:16] and then i said to brother alpha
[1:03:19] why don't we go inside we we pray
[1:03:23] and we came and i was right there
[1:03:25] i was praying
[1:03:27] and my phone rang
[1:03:29] and i could not take my
[1:03:31] my phone because i was talking to the
[1:03:33] king
[1:03:35] and
[1:03:36] they they hung up
[1:03:38] and they sent me a message
[1:03:40] so when i went out there
[1:03:43] the message was it was brother queben
[1:03:45] he was phoning me and you are saying
[1:03:47] it's all right i'll take the service
[1:03:49] amen so
[1:03:51] to me that's a confirmation
[1:03:53] i was right on the altar right in front
[1:03:55] here
[1:03:56] praying
[1:03:57] and the preacher says
[1:03:59] the phone rings and he says we'll take
[1:04:01] the service so we are also expecting the
[1:04:03] lord to speak to us
[1:04:05] it was very beautiful in the morning
[1:04:08] oh my oh my
[1:04:12] oh
[1:04:13] who is the world
[1:04:16] the lord is his different way of using
[1:04:18] people
[1:04:20] very different way
[1:04:21] that i appreciate
[1:04:23] at times
[1:04:24] it's when the preacher is
[1:04:26] maybe thinks he's picking his books
[1:04:29] and is about to go away
[1:04:32] and he starts talking something
[1:04:34] and he just goes right into your problem
[1:04:37] and he just gives you a solution to your
[1:04:40] problem
[1:04:41] that has happened to me
[1:04:43] he was just speaking probably it's just
[1:04:46] speaking casual
[1:04:48] and just god
[1:04:49] just answers it
[1:04:51] just does it amen praise our lord we
[1:04:54] shall be saying
[1:04:55] seek him boy
