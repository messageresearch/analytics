========================================
[Music] [Music] so [Music] [Music] [Music] amen as we stand tonight just think about and just focus on the presence of god amen we've come here this evening to to see him and to just return praise [Music] many of us have such a great desire to praise him and there may be someone here tonight that are having a hard time and you know we're in different places and sometimes whether you are eager to praise or whether you're going through a tough passion it becomes a sacrifice of praise and so i just encourage you tonight that give god everything [Music] give him your thoughts tonight give him your your energy give him your devotion hallelujah give god your imaginations and your affections give them all just pour it out you know we have read of the woman that went and bought the most expensive perfume and she had a desire in her heart to to give a sacrifice of praise to to the lord and you know when you know when when she broke that alabaster box she broke it and she poured it out to a point of no return she couldn't take back that expensive perfume she couldn't take back and go and get a refund she gave everything and i just encourage you tonight that you would pour your alabaster box out at his feet and don't think of any returns don't have don't have any reserves left just let it all come flowing just pour it out just let it all come out tonight amen you see you

how believing in his word wrote peace with within my heart but i know who i have believed and persuaded that he is able to keep that which i've committed unto him against that day i know not how the spirit moves convincing men of sin [Music] revealing jesus through the word create faith in him but i know who i have believed and persuaded that he is able to keep that which i've committed unto him

which i've committed unto him against that day i know not when my lord may come at night or noonday fear nor if i walk the veil with him o me to me the air but i know whom i have believed and am persuaded that he is able to keep it which i've committed unto him against that but i know but i know who i have believed and i'm persuaded that he is able to keep it which i've committed unto him against that day hallelujah lord we are persuaded lord that you're able whole lord we're trusting in you tonight lord hallelujah to bring us through amen hallelujah amen let's just slow it down as we

musicians amen we need more every day don't we amen here's our sufficiency as the apost the apostle paul said our sufficiency is of god amen i'd like to wish our birthday boy happy birthday brother kabin god bless you trust you had a real blessed day amen god bless you my brother amen praise the lord let's go to isaiah 43 and then we're going to go to john 14. so just as we're turning just a reminder that um we've got brother ferdi preaching here on sunday um it is the weekend we're using the vaccine pass so that's going to be used and we're having church lunch as well yeah we're going to have a blessed a blessed weekend i believe i trust someone agree with me there it's like it's like cricket's going wow okay amen brother brown says if you think right do right you'll come out right so i think we should think we're gonna have a blessed weekend to me that's thinking right amen isaiah 14 uh sorry isaiah 43 and verse 21 you know i couldn't find my shaver this morning couldn't find my bible so it's been one of those days but um praise the lord i'm glad the word is still the same i have tabs my other bible it's kind of cheating and maybe that's what's um anyway praise the lord we are here in isaiah 43 21 we're just going to read one verse here if you're going to turn me down here yeah please so this verse here this people i have formed for myself they shall show forth my praise amy talking about you and i i mean let's go to john 14 and we're going to read from verse 23 in john 14. here so john 14 and from verse 23 we're going to read down to verse 30. it says jesus answered and said unto him if a man loved me he'll keep my words and my father will love him and we will come unto him and we'll make our abode with him he that loveth me not keepeth not my sayings and the word which you hear is not mine but the father which sent me i'm just making sure i'm in the wrong i mean in the right place yes these things have i spoken unto you yet being present with you but the comforter which is the holy ghost whom the father will send in my name he shall teach you all things and bring all things to your remembrance whatsoever i have said unto you peace i leave with you my peace i give unto you not as the world giveth give i unto you let not your heart be troubled neither let it be afraid you have heard how i said unto you i go away and come again unto you if you love if you loved me you would rejoice because i said i've gone to the father for my father's greater than i and now i have told you before it come to pass that when it has come to pass ye might believe hereafter i will not talk much with you for the prince of this world cometh and hath nothing in me amen let's bow heads in a word of prayer there if you want to be remembered in prayer you remember it's not a tradition the lord remembers us when we pray amen i believe that every prayer he answers and he remembers and he hears amen so let's let let's pray uh this afternoon this evening together gracious heavenly father thank you lord that we we truly do need you more and i want to thank you that in your presence is truly where we find home lord it's not necessarily a physical location upon the earth but our home is anew lord because there's a call in our hearts to another world to a better world to an eternal world where there's no death no sin no suffering no violence down there it's peace forevermore it's sublime as the prophet said as he came lord he went there beyond the curtain of time as you know then you brought him back here and he tried to describe the atmosphere what it was like he said sublime it's far above anything that could be in human language and we want to thank you that we're pilgrims on our way to that great land i just want to ask father as brother martu has asked for prayer for uh jason his his friend's brother brendan strang that last sunday he went to church and mastered him for the first time and he needs to find the lord father i pray you just give him such a sincere heart lord may he seek you with all of his heart lord because your word says they that seek me with all their heart shall find me father may he not be seeking to join a church law but may be seeking to meet you please maybe put that in his heart lord we know there's a deep calling to the deep lord there must be a reason he's been stirred up and he's looking father and i pray dear god bring him all the way home unto you lord into the true baptism of the holy ghost seal his soul away for eternity for your glory grant it dear god and we just lord any other need that's in our midst father unspoken or anything father i pray you'd meet every need lord you see the burdens and the questions and the troubles that we may be carrying but i want to thank you lord we can let off the pressure tonight lord we can come into your presence just lay it all at your feet just rejoice give you praise just want to ask you be with us lord hear those who are watching by the way the internet be their portion to father i pray you'd increase our faith like never before put such stabilizers in our life father that we don't that that we're not tossed to and fro by man's opinion or the climate or whatever is going on but maybe just be steadfast ensuring you grant it father for your glory in jesus christ's name amen amen god bless your friends you may have your seats tonight um i would like to uh kind of approach the subject and and um you know the last time we sung that song i see your promises and fulfillment all over my life i love that song to me it's it it's it's it's our theme song i think when we see god's fulfillment in our lives because we know that we're living in the time when all things would be fulfilled where every prophecy speaking of the bride would be manifested in a people as as jesus would say or rather jesus through peter would say and i think acts 3 or 4 he said that he said that heaven must receive the lord jesus christ until the restitution of all things so that word restitution is a restoration so the lord cannot come until we are restored i mean part of the restoration or restitution of all things is us the bride coming back to her position that she was on the day of pentecost and i believe we're living in that day and i believe more than we're just living in it but we're experiencing it amen so i just want to go in a little bit today where where the lord jesus says that the prince of this world has no part in me he has nothing in me the lord would say that's the last statement that we read there in in john 14 and 30 the prince of this world cometh and he has nothing in me now a few other um i looked at a couple other bible translations with this um with this verse and it says in the uh english standard version it says he has no claim on me now all this applies to you as well he has no claim on me then in the contemporary english version it would say but he hath no power over me and i think all those things stand very true tonight amen he has nothing in me so there's no part of me in him and i have no pardon him amen right so he's got nothing in me i've got nothing in him there's a parting of ways there was a clear-cut parting of ways there wasn't while i had my foot in his camp and my other foot in god's camp and just be have enough religion to make me miserable no there was a parting of ways there was a definite clear-cut divorce there's a break there's a clear we're not talking no more we're not friends no more we're not even associates no more we're certainly not work colleagues no more we are not on speaking terms the only speaking terms well when the devil comes our way you say but my lord has washed me he has loosed me from your grip you have no part of me i have no part in you because of what he has done not what i have done that's what he has done what the lord has done that counts amen so he has nothing in me i trust this should be you should be able to repeat this he has nothing in me he has no claim on me and he has no power over me at all hallelujah amen so he's got nothing in me and and this is what the lord has really done in our day by taking the book in revelations four and five where where where brother graham said it was the most sublime act in scripture i mean the the most sublime act in scripture was where where john would be looking and he was lifted up into the throne room of god and he saw there was a cry that went forth a mighty angel a strong angel proclaimed who's worthy amen let him come and take the book and brother brahm standing behind the pulpit and the breaches maybe i just feel this way but let him come hallelujah event was taking place in my opinion i mean the lamb was stepping forth from eternity to loose the seals off the book aiming to show you who you are hallelujah so so it's the most sublime act because because john he said he went much not because he wasn't found worthy or you know there are a lot of what we would call worthy people but none were found worthy because we're all born in sin we're all born lost even the most mighty prophets that have ever been even if you take you know joseph uh his life there's only one mark in the whole scripture against joseph one thing of his entire life all the even in all the pressure he was under the hardship the rejection everything one thing was held against him and that was when his father jacob was was was coming down into egypt and you know the egyptians counted our shepherds abominations so so he tried to get jacob to tell a lie don't say you're a shepherd that was the one mark held against him of his entire life one thing was held against him so he could have been the most nearly worthy person but there's one mark held against him and of course he was born in sin anyway but so there was no man sure the angels would have been worthy but it wasn't an angel that caused the fall or allowed the fall to come and it was man that brought the fall into being right allowed satan to to take control of the human race and take control of nature and know that's why we have suffering today that's why we have sickness that's why innocent people get sick and terrible tragedies happen is because the devil's in charge of this world but there's coming a day where he is being dethroned amen well it will not be him in charge no more he'll not bring sickness no more he won't bring death no more there won't be any storms or typhoons or hurricanes no more i'm able to be peace forevermore because the prince of peace will take his rightful place on the throne but before that happens he's got to call the people to his side he's got to call a bride and that's what he's been doing through seven church ages and i trust you can see yourself in the story i mean because it's the greatest story the greatest love story the greatest story that's ever been told and ever been lived amen is the one you're living out right now hallelujah so no no angel was um you know no angel could come into it even though they had never sinned like michael or or gabriel one of the great angels because angels never caused the fall it was man that's why jesus was called the second adam because he came to redeem back everything adam lost everything adam forfeited his god over the earth jesus came to redeem back and that's why our lord jesus had control over nature amen ten thousand devils got into the sea of galilee when he was tired after a busy series of meetings he's fallen asleep on the boat ten thousand demons said that we've got him now we're gonna drown him and they thought they were in control of that sea because no doubt they whipped up those waves quite a lot and the and the disciples have battled those waves quite a lot you know there's been a lot of storms in life and and sometimes we can kind of manage them because they would have managed that storm before on that boat but when they came to the end of their human ability the next course of action was they're gonna they're gonna be drowned but they had someone different in the boat that they had never had before maybe and that was the actual true master of the waves that was the true master of the wind and they woke him up said master don't you care we're going to die we're going to drown and he just said peace be still because the devil thought he had ownership over nature but actually god showed no i made these i made these atoms i made this weather i made the sea i'm in control amen it's the same thing when storms whip up in our life we can wake jesus up he's in the boat hey man he's in the boat i trust he's in your boat i mean you're having fellowship all the time you're a fellowship junkie hallelujah you and the lord jesus all the time amen but you've got to wake him up i mean don't try and rely on your own human ability to solve the calm the storm wake up the one who has mastery over everything amen he would go to lazarus's tomb four days in the grave that man was writing corruption had said in i mean but corruption knew its master the prophet said amen and and brother abraham said that if if jesus did not call lazarus by name there would have been a general resurrection because he said i am the resurrection and the life not a resurrection the resurrection hallelujah amen he went to the fig tree there were no figs he wanted figs his desire was for figs there was no fig so it cursed the tree to show he had he had dominion over nature amen the same one was in joshua when joshua said son stand still moon stand still amen could control things how did that work i don't know but god ordained it it was because joshua's desire and god's desire matched up i mean because the prophecy was you're going to take the land amen so so his desire and god's eye messed up that's why joshua could stand and say sun stand still moon stand still i mean we've got to destroy our enemies we can't let them have time to regroup i mean to win your desire and god's desire match up i believe god's got to do something about that hallelujah the anointing hap strikes amen and and it's more than just human you know no doubt maybe a lot of people would say wouldn't it be cool if i could stop the sun and the moon wouldn't that you know you think yeah people think wouldn't be cool if we could fly who thought that when they were a child i want to fly you know so you could say it but if the desire matches up with gods and it's his season for it to happen it'll happen that's just i'm just maybe too simple but that's why i feel you know because remember we're walking we're walking into a full uh a full inheritance amen and the first part of this we must realize is the devil has nothing in me the devil has nothing in us amen he has no claim on you in any part of you remember the greatest battle may be ever fought in the mind but the mind is really god's mind right this is called no man's land well you know they say there's no man's land but really it's it's this is god god made the mind god made the body god made the soul it's not that the devil says no i made their spirit no no no no god made it amen so god yo i mean the devil has no part in our thought life amen the devil has no part in our bodies you know i love it where brother brown would pray and um you know he would he would he would pray this someone came up with sickness and the doctors couldn't find what was wrong it came out in discernment but the prophet said you know satan you may be able to hide from the doctors but you can't hide from god and that's like anything there's trouble you know maybe you can't diagnose it you can't put your finger on where the trouble is but but that thing can't hide from god that's why you call a prayer meeting seek the lord about it and he'll he'll he'll give you the diagnosis probably it boils down to this is the enemy doing this why should i put up with him coming on my land amen so he has no claim on us now this is what the power of the blood does where where um the apostle john would would be writing in revelations 1 and he would say in verse 5 he'd say and from jesus christ who is the faithful witness and the first begotten of the dead and the prince of the kings of the earth unto him that loved us and washed us from our sins in his own blood so that word washed as means it's it's a separation it's like you take something that's dirty and you put it in the washing machine and when you get it out of the washing machine it's been loose from its dirt it's been washed so so so the garment and the dirt have been separated hallelujah now if time would go on those same molecules of dirt could actually come back to the shirt again you know they say well this isn't this is the one thing i remember from university it's um it would say i think it's in a physics textbook they'd say that the last breath that julius caesar ever breathed has gone around the world right just by how molecules move apparently i don't know how you kind of work that out but there's there's a theory interesting theory didn't help me an exam was never asked on it but anyway i remember that so you could say if time would go on enough and that julius caesar was still alive the same molecules of air that he breathed out could all eventually come into him if time would go on as i say if the dirt that was on your shirt was loose in the washing machine if time would go on perhaps that dirt would come back to you again but that's not the same thing with the blood of jesus christ i mean what doesn't just it doesn't just separate it from you it actually annihilates it amen but i'll say that annihilation is actually pending because it's now on the head of the accuser i mean remember because he will stand in judgment one day and he will give an account for every murder for all unbelief hatred malice strife shady deal crooked white lie black lie whatever you are call all murder all hatred deceit war he will give a count every broken home broken life whatever it is he will give an account because it will all come eventually down onto him it will boil down to him just like in the garden there was adam and eve and the serpent well where did it go it went from adam goddess adam the woman you gave me basically god this is your fault this is how fallen man works he blames god god you gave me this woman this is the problem you gave me it too it's your fault god that's what he said but then but but then it moved on because god's not separate he's not satisfied with a with an excuse he's looking for the truth right because it's his children he wants to free them from the sin i mean we may have a lot of excuses but he wants to free us amen so then then now it goes to evens and and eve says well the serpent beguiled me and then the serpent's being questioned by god and he's got no one else to pass the buck to and it'll be the same thing in the great white throne judgment satan will be there and he and he can't pass the buck to anyone else he'll add the carrot and then he will take it into destruction amen but the sins that we confess under the blood of jesus christ if time would go on for eternity if that makes sense it can never come back to us like dirt from a shirt so we're far more loosed than than than dirt from a garment right so it it is completely free from us and it can never return i mean that's why you say well i don't know how to pray it doesn't matter how you pray it's the it's a intent of the heart amen so you know some people can say the greatest flowery prayers god doesn't hear it but god hears a simple humble cry a simple humble cry is what god hears when you really mean business with god god sees the heart he may he doesn't usually see the outward emotion of it but he sees the heart of it amen and then so now it's a it just takes a simple humble cry to god forgive me lord i've done wrong i've done this and then what happens is that is now that's confessing to the blood of jesus christ and is now taken from you you are loose from your sins you know it's amazing how the bible is saying first john that the son of god or daughter of god cannot commit sin cannot practice sin because the seed of god is in them amen but now so now we can we can actually look into the face of the devil and we can tell him that he has no part in us because all of the sins that he actually caused in our life have been taken from us amen from from the deeds of this guy here amen they are not attributed to me anymore they're under the blood of jesus christ so now he does not have claim on a people who are under the blood he has no claim right he has nothing to put his crooked fingers on to say no no they they actually belong to me because they're under still the spirit of unbelief remember all sin is an attribute of unbelief amen so he has no claim if you're really under the blood of jesus christ or how do i know that you've really received the holy ghost you become a new creature in christ you may make many mistakes and trip up along the way but it's not him that falls at him that gets back up hallelujah amen so he has no claim on us in that way but then now it's not just that claim because the devil's crafting it's not just sin that he tried to get the people under and he accomplished it but the blood of jesus christ loses us but it's also anything man i say the devil has injected himself into religion and so now he keeps the people in bondage by creeds and dogmas of men like jesus would say that by teaching the commandments and doctrines of men they make the word of god no effect to the people now if you think about that single statement he said he said basically the scribes and pharisees have made the word of god no effect by teaching creeds and dogmas so now the people were under a slavery where the devil would say no no they believe what i've taught them so now i've got a claim on them but now that's why the lord jesus came as he wanted to strike off every claim because our god is a thorough lawyer he's thorough in his job he's not haphazard he's not blase he you know because he knows the devil because he made the devil he understands how the devil works he knows the devil can if he can get just a a fingernail hold on something he'll hold on to it with all that's within him right so our god makes us in such a way by his blood that the devil has no claim on any of us hallelujah so now now jesus would would would instruct the disciples after his resurrection to carry in jerusalem till they receive power from on high now what was going to happen is as brother man would say that they were about to receive an abstract title deed that all of their sin was struck off there was nothing held against them it was all gone amen and that was in the form of receiving the holy ghost because remember if you've truly been born again really received the holy ghost all of your past present and future sins have been taken care of amen by one offering he's perfected forever them that are sanctified amen we may fall into sin but that doesn't mean we're not lost the bible says if we confess our sins he's faithful and just to forgive us amen so so if you've really received the holy ghost all of your sin has been struck off it's not on your account hallelujah amen that's why we shouldn't be afraid we should just walk on with god because that's what an abstract on abstract um title details so a title d to say just have i bought this building not putting any ideas into anyone's minds right now but you know then then we'd have to make sure and in order for the sale to go through that there were no claims on it and if there were those claims would had to be sorted and then we could buy the building so that's what the lord did when he died that day on calvary as he was actually striking all the claims of the bride of christ not just 120 in the upper room but all the believers down through the ages by that one offering he did the whole thing and that's why the word becomes alive to you is because he did it for you hallelujah and then said now so so he struck all everything that was held against him peter james and john the woman at the well legion whoever it was all of their deeds were struck off by the blood of jesus christ and they received the holy ghost which was an abstract title deed which means the devil now had no claim on them whatsoever hallelujah but then now we've had seven church ages and the first church age started uh you know it was it was a couple of decades after the day of pentecost and by that time the church has already fallen the devil had started to make claims and because i would say in the ephesian age it says you know remember without your doubt fallen you know repent and do the first works go back right so they'd already begin to fall now the blood still covers the people but that was showing now there had to come a time where god would do the second act of redemption to actually strike off from all of the new testament saints what the devil had put upon them you take luther for example when the reformation started he was he was smoking a pipe you know he was a trinitarian he was drinking but yet god used him to to to illuminate an age that just shall live by faith the people were in darkness but now light was being restored so now that was that was you could say tag satan you could say but he he was believing my doctrine and then you know there was a restoration going on but then finally now we've come to the end and that's why john went much because someone's got to take the book someone's got to claim it for their own amen to actually finish the work of redemption because redemption is two parts right it's the purchase then there's the claim then there's i mean there's a purchase and there's actually the gathering of what you've purchased right just like boaz boaz purchased the redemption of naomi and ruth at the gate of the city but then he had to go marry ruth right that's redemption all in that it's a book of redemption the book of ruth i mean so so he couldn't just he couldn't just say now i've redeemed naomi to get ruth and i'm going to marry her and not marry her no he had to become one with her actually marry her right you're following me and then so the lord jesus purchased our salvation on calvary that was the purchasing but then he had to come for the claiming work i mean the claiming work and that's why to me brother graham said that the taking of the book is the most sublime act in scripture because that's why john wept does that where is the kinsman redeemer that can claim us hallelujah because he knew if that book wasn't taken we're all in jeopardy but it's amazing because you know he was the beloved disciple he would lean on jesus bosom he was in the inner circle but yet when he was standing in eternity maybe he just couldn't see him there where is that lamb where's the one who's worthy that's why he went much and that's why the elder said don't weep john the lion of the tribe of judah has prevailed i remember when john looked he didn't see a lion coming to bring judgment but he saw a lamb he saw his lamb amen i trust when you see the lord jesus you see your lamb you see your perfect sacrifice you see the one who died for you you see the one who is who shed his blood to wash all your sins away hallelujah i trust that's what you see i don't see a god that's angry with me i see a god that loves me and gave herself for me or to me amen he gave he is my ransom hallelujah amen so he went much and he because there was no one found worthy but then the lord jesus stepped forth bloody wounded he prevailed through the line of the tribe of judah has prevailed hallelujah and then when he stepped forth and he took that book now we are represented in that book yes amen just like as i said brother brown would say in the breach that that that ruth is a symbol of the book of redemption and boaz is our christ i mean so so he said that the lamb taking the book is is the same as ruth being married to boaz amen so now so what's been happening is there's been there's been a intercessory work going on and it's still going on it hasn't stopped i still need it i still need an intercessor i need someone to stand between me and god interceding on my behalf i still need the blood some people think they don't need blood no more no i need the blood of the lamb i need him every day and i'm going to need him every day till i leave this earth holy i'm so glad he's still there tonight amen redemption and mercy is still there tonight hello for whosoever will amen hallelujah amen so now he took that book which represents claiming you you got to make it personal so now when the lamb now we know the one who's we know it's a great jama we know there's not two gods there's one there's not three there's one right but when adam adam if i can use this as a symbol adam actually had the title d to the earth before the fall but when he fell it couldn't go into the slippery hands of the accuser so went back to the original creator and it waited there for another man to come who was actually worthy to claim it back amen that's why my lord jesus is my champion when i could not save myself he saved me when i could not redeem myself he redeemed me when i could not do anything on my own behalf he stepped forth howard says they're mine he's mine she's mine amen she has no pardon the devil amen the devil has no pardon her hallelujah amen so so then jesus stepped forth with his own blood and now took it into his possession hallelujah so so how does that really work out in this age he came looking for you he's picked you up he's carrying you home hallelujah he you are now his possession you are his purchased possession i'm glad i'm his aren't you glad you're his hallelujah and he's not going to let you go amen hallelujah amen so this great act is going on right now amen because there's still some people upon the earth that have to be redeemed that's why the dead in christ haven't risen yet amen but hey the last one could be real close to us amen i'll say come home it's wonderful the water's fine hallelujah amen so so he would say that the that the prince of this world has nothing in me and this is what's happened at the end of the ages that god has done another abstract title deed search amen this is why the lamb could take the book because he would come in the seventh church age and strike off all the false doctrine of the church because we have been restored back to the faith of the fathers they had no false doctrine in them they weren't trinitarian they didn't have god cut up into many pieces they didn't baptize wrong they didn't have their church the wrong way they didn't have they they weren't some cold formal group they just went through a cycle of a religious motion no they had reality they had god in their midst amen they knew that jehovah the old testament was jesus of the new they knew that the very creator god himself was the holy ghost that dwell within them hallelujah amen they knew the promises of the bible were in fulfillment in their life amen that they could go rejoicing and we have been restored back amen to this very thing amen as brother brown would say i believe it's in birth pains now we know the scripture says malachi 4 that that the ministry of malachi 4 would turn the hearts of the children back to the fathers now that is not a uniting of natural fathers and natural children it is the hearts of the children which are us will be turned back to the faith of the fathers that's why we could sing that hymn faith of the father's living still amen so now if the hearts of the fathers i mean children return back to the hearts of the fathers then the same birth the fathers received we would receive amen that it would not be just a mental agreement saying jesus died on the cross for me it would not be putting your name on a church book it would not be just getting baptized and that's it and no change of life but the same holy ghost that fell in the book of acts amen would fall upon you and i transform our lives change our thinking change our actions change our nature i mean where he would become a god of reality whereas bible would be true in our lives i mean that every scripture would be real to us hallelujah now what i love about this i may be jumping ahead of myself a bit but you know if if well wait i'll just read this quote i said i would now if we could he says here now her messenger is promised the seventh church h1 in malachi the fourth chapter he's promised to do it and the message is to bring back the word bring the people back to the word birth is to be she's been delivered of a new birth from according to malachi 4. that's why brother ram would stand in 1965 and say that screaming hollering acts 238 youngins are the only kind the word can produce that's the only kind it can produce it's not a cold mental assist not a dry eyed confession but a real birth a real dying out a real change of nature and it's god that does it we're not reforming ourselves i mean who's with me tonight this is not a reformation this is a transformation i mean god can change your thinking maybe your thinking is always negative and down and there's nothing to this and i'll never become anything in life and what's the point of trying and god can change your thinking to say i've got a purpose in the world i'm here for a reason i'm not here just to fill up time and waste time and occupy time but i'm here to manifest the word of god that god will come and live in my life and i'm going to walk with him i mentally takes me home we all have a purpose in this world amen we are here for a divine purpose i mean we're under a mandate from heaven amen to to be a manifestation of the bible in this day i mean not religious people religion is a killer this is not a religious society this is not what this is about amen this is god living in a people i know you probably know these things but i wonder you got to look at yourself and say i'm different god has made me different god called me a church didn't call me a priest you didn't call me god's called me i mean he's put me under a mandate i've been commissioned to be the final voice of the final age i mean for the final runner in the race hallelujah amen this is why we're here we're not here just to occupy time we're not here because well these are where my friends are there's no that's not what this is about or this is where my family is no this is not what this is about god has called us to fulfill a specific portion of scripture in this day amen that may be a bit generic but i'd say it's not generic because the word this must be transferred from no more ink on paper but now it's flesh amen that when you read through the scripture let's go to titus here's a challenge can i find titles without tabs here we go oh there's a art i like a contest page now one four six eight here we have it if anyone is knows where my bible is man the last time i i lost it i got it back i cried i felt like an old friend had come home you know it's just not i know the words are all the same but it's not the same now i put myself on there okay here we are titus two and one but speak now now here's a challenge now i'm challenging myself too see if we're a living bible what we are reading we should actually be able to look in our lives and say i'm living that and maybe no one's told you it but if the same spirit that wrote the bibles in you you will live out the bible without even realizing it says now but speak the other things which become sound doctrine that the age men be sober grave temperate sound and faith and charity and patience the aged woman likewise that they be in behavior as becometh holiness not false accusers not given to much wine teachers of good things that they may teach the young woman to be sober to love their husbands to love their children to be discreet chaste keepers at home good obedient to their own husbands that the word of god be not blasphemed young men likewise exhort to be sober-minded in all things showing thyself a pattern of good works and doctrine showing uncorruptness gravity sincerity sound speech that cannot be condemned that he that is of country part may be ashamed having no evil thing to say of you exhort servants to be obedient unto their masters and to please them well in all things not answering again not prolonging but showing all good fidelity that they may adorn the doctrine of god our savior in all things for the grace of god that bringeth salvation hath appeared to all men teaching us that uh denying ungodliness and worldly lust we should live soberly righteously and godly in the present world looking for that blessed hope and the glorious appearing of the great god and our savior jesus christ who gave himself for us that he might redeem us from all iniquity and purify unto himself a peculiar people now that word peculiar doesn't mean strange that means a precious treasure zealous of good works these things speak and exhort and rebuke with all authority let no man despise thee now i think that covers from the old to the young so i trust when you read that and you found your portion you could say i trust sincerely it say actually i'm living that because you're a living bible amen and that was not old-fashioned the scripture is for all all generations amen so now the lord jesus in this end time did an abstract title deed search and that's why the seven church ages and the seals were preached because in the seals brother braham says we're just stripping down the devil exposing him on every hand and he would go down through the seven church ages and he'd say taking the the where god praises the age and the complaints against the age and the history that happened in the age to expose the devils working down through the church ages what was going on the lamb was standing exposing the works of the devil to show actually no no this is where the devil can have claims on people but this is but i'm going to strike them off this end time bride because when this end time bride comes to perfection then the resurrection of the dead in christ will come forth because they without us cannot be made perfect or complete amen amen so it's incredible our that we're living in hallelujah now i'm gonna i'm gonna run through this real quick because i know time's gone but every promise has been opened to us in the in the word now i'll say this if one promise has been opened to you then every promise is yours right every promise of one promise has been opened every promise is yours you know it must have been an incredible thing if we could go into the minds of the israelites as they were walking around jericho they weren't wondering if the walls would fall they knew they were going to fall now they had they were living out the fulfillment of the prophet moses ministry because his whole ministry was that the people would go into the land he couldn't do it himself because of what he did in the wilderness smiting the rock and those things but his whole ministry was that they would leave egypt and go into the promised land and joshua was told in joshua chapter one that he was instructed to be strong and of good courage i mean to be strong and very courageous amen that thou mayest observed to do according to all the law which moses my servant commandee turn off from the right hand or to the left hand that thou mayest prosper wheresoever thou goest so joshua was instructed now wherever you go every place of the soul of your foot shall tread upon this is verse 3 of joshua 1 um that have i given unto you as i said unto moses so now joshua's told wherever you go you're going to get it you'll that's your possession right so now they were living out the ministry of moses and now they were living out the fulfillment of that ministry mean so now supernaturally they crossed the river jordan they didn't build a bridge they didn't build boats they didn't build a pontoon system they didn't have whatever they supernaturally in spring season when the river was flooding they crossed the jordan and they did it by the priest carrying the word carrying the ark and they stepped into the jordan created an entrance and they crossed now their forebears did the same thing not with the ark but crossing the red sea supernaturally so now the promises they would step into the land and they'd take it they had already stepped into the land you think about what now a promise has just been fulfilled i was excited in my mind i hope this makes sense to you you know but so one part of the promise has already been fulfilled you could have gone to the promised land they had already begun to live out the fulfillment of moses ministry they were living it out now right they set foot in over jordan they are in the land now if that promise was true that they could go into the land supernaturally therefore every other promise everything else in the land was theirs if one promise is true every promise is true every promise if one promise is true so listen who's been saved yes sir who's received the holy ghost who's being healed who's repented being baptized received the holy ghost who's that answered prayer that's that's a promise answered isn't it that's one so if that's been answered they'll all be answered hallelujah are you with me so now the whole so here they are here's israel walking around jericho hallelujah they're just under expectation he told us to walk around once for six days these these are going to fall maybe they would talk in camp how do you think it's going to happen they didn't know but i knew it was going to happen then they walked around seven times on the seventh day then they blew the trumpets let out a shout they weren't wondering if it would work remember the promise of crossing the jordan worked amen see the devil challenges our faith how do you know you have faith for it well i had faith back here remember they all had to believe to cross the jordan the apostle paul said that the other generation entered not because of unbelief so the next generation had to enter in because of faith hallelujah so now if we have crossed jordan the whole land is ours the same faith if i can put it this way the same faith that allowed us to cross jordan gives every part of the land hallelujah if we go up to where manasseh lived says divine healing it's mine we go here my whole family's in it's mine redemption of my family here hell peace in the home is here walk above this world here amen every divine promise is open hallelujah but why is that because the devil has no claim on you you have no pardon him he has no part in you as i said you parted ways i trust a long time ago if you haven't parted ways just repent with all your heart right now and you'll part ways he won't be your best buddy that just ends you up in trouble and runs for it when you get in trouble no no he'll be your enemy amen so now i'm going to read this read these and then we're going to go enoch was translated this is in god's power to transform enoch was translated from death by god's transforming power what did god do that for for a type of the rapturing church that's coming sure elijah was the same jesus body was quickened after was dead and in the grave jesus body was quickened by the word of god and transformed from a dead cold image to a resurrected glorified son of god because the prophet psalms 16 10 if he put it down 16 10 said i'll not leave a soul in hell neither i suffer my holy one to see corruption oh god that word has to come to pass it's god's word planted in your heart if you want to go on a rapture if you want to be a christian's genuine place this word as i believed it was ezekiel god said take that scroll and eat it up that the prophet and the word would become the same and the very promise that's in there has to manifest itself because it's god's original seed don't let some educated theologian out there try and pump it out if you don't let them spray you with some carnal size of knowledge and education but believe god i mean so but you've got to realize if one promise is true all the promises are true because remember every promise is an attribute of christ and he's not a he's not a he's one right so healing's a part of him salvation's part of him deliverance is part of him it's all attributes he's a mighty healer he's a mighty redeemer he's a god of war remember he's our kins and redeemed he's also our kinsmen avenger right pour out his wrath upon the devil is trying to get in and attack our lives amen now he says this now i'll read this one from perseverance and we'll stop samson was met on the field one day with a thousand philistines around him and looked all around he wasn't a trained man that knew how to duel but when he turned his head he felt that covenant then locked strike his shoulders that's all he had to feel he got the first thing in his hand was a jawbone of a mule and beat down a thousand philistines why he was persistent because he know that god had made a covenant with him of those seven locks long as they hung in their place nothing was going to bother him oh brother sister how the church and living god understand tonight persistent as long as we can feel the covenant of the holy spirit the blood of jesus christ cleansing us from all sin we should never let nothing stand in our way persistent certainly amen it took a battle to get the promised land but every divine the whole land opened up to them amen and the whole world has been opened up in this end time hallelujah there's no oh when is it it's going to be no it's now it's right now every promise is true right now every promise is yours right now now we are the sons and daughters of god not one day right now amen we have no part in the devil and he has no pardon us no matter what claim he tries to put on you point him to point him to the blood do you know what opens every divine promise faith in the finished work of calvary opens up every divine promise of god to you amen so take that key of faith lord jesus you purchased this that day on calvary lord jesus you took those stripes and pilate judgment hall for my healing lord jesus you redeem me that down calvary you redeem my family you redeem my loved ones you healed me of all sickness you broke the power of every devil everything that can be named on this earth or under this earth you have dominion over and above amen because of that victory you won for me that day on calvary you take that key of faith in the finished work and it will unlock every door every divine promise hallelujah what an hour that we live can the musicians please uh come tonight amen but we live an incredible time hallelujah i didn't even get to my opening scripture in isaiah but you know we have been formed for his praise hallelujah how does that work well god does something for you you praise him for it god hasn't done it yet praise him anyway they could have gone around jericho they didn't because it was silence but they could have gone around shouting jericho's coming down if god blew us over jordan he's going to give us this victory and if they knew about aya they could have been shouting ai is coming down hardly every every stronghold of the enemy is coming down they're going to be praising him for it why because the first promise unlocked and unlocked every other divine promise hallelujah that's why we should praise the lord amen amen amen what shall we sing brother isaac amen let's go for it let's go for it make a joyful noise i trust i trust you know when we sang that song the last time i just started rejoicing of revelations 10 8 to 11 and the bride tree coming forth ezekiel's dry bones i mean
