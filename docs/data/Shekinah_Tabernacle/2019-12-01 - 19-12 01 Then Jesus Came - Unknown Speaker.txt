[Music] [Music] [Music] I see old Shamgar standing out there he had to put all of his he said not very much write about him in the Bible but that what--what's wrote was enough he was standing out

too god bless you amen praise the Lord let's turn to the book of Mark chapter 5 trust everyone's happy and well in the Lord today we're going to read mark one down to verse 20 mark 5 so verses 1 to 20 so I don't have a slideshow what's that yep was here we are and they came over unto the other side of the sea into the country of the gadarenes and when he was come out of the ship immediately there met him out of the tombs of man with an unclean spirit who had his dwelling among the tombs and no man could bind him no not with chains because he that had been off bound with fetters and change the chains had been plucked asunder by him and the fetters broken in pieces neither could any man tame him and always night and day he was in the mountains and in the tombs crying and cutting himself with stones for when he saw Jesus afar off he ran and worshipped him and cried with a loud voice but I want you to notice who's doing the worshipping as it the manner is at Legion I want you to see just just look at us here and when he saw Jesus afar off he ran and worshipped them and cried with a loud voice saying what have I to do with thee Jesus our son of the Most High God I adjure thee by God that thou art torment me not this is the devil worshiping for he said unto him come out of the man thou unclean spirit and he asked him what is thy name and he said saying my name is legion for we are many and he besought him much that he would not send him away out of the country now there was their high unto the mountains a great herd of swine feeding and all the devil's besought him saying send us into the swine that we may enter into them for as much Jesus gave them leave and the unclean spirits excuse-me went out and entered into the swine and the herd round ran violently down a steep place into the sea there about two thousand and were choked in the sea and they did't feed the swine fled and told it in the city and in the country and they went out to see what it was that was done and they come to Jesus and see him that was possessed with the devil and had and had the legions sitting clothed and in his right mind and they were afraid and they that saw it told them how it befell to him that was possessed with the devil and also concerning the swine so they began to testify of what happened to this man and the result was and they began to pray him to depart out of their coasts and he was coming to the ship he that was possessed with the devil prayed him that he would might might be with him howbeit Jesus suffered him not and south--and him go home to thy friends and tell them how great things the Lord has done for thee and hath compassion on thee and he departed and began to publish and jakka bless or have you say that I don't know how great things Jesus had done for him and all men did marvel I mean this bow heads and a word of Prayer gracious Lord we are so thankful we can be standing in your presence once more Lord to know that by your precious blood we have no condemnation we have no sin Lord you've you've answered that question you've taken all guilt and shame away Lord that's your doing and we rejoice because it's you're doing Lord we're so thankful that no one can boast in your presence no mortal can't declare any goodness of their own selves Lord because we know it's all you Lord salvation is of you who lured our Walkers of you our rapture will be of you as well and dear God I just pray that you'll bless your word to your people now father noid speaker and here one more time Lord what good is it if the people are anointed but I am NOT or if I am anointed and the people are not Lord we must both be anointed so may we be one heart one mind one Accord Lord may what we face tomorrow just be put one Lord to one side you already know what's going to happen tomorrow you're not worried about it Lord so therefore we shall not be worried neither Lord because our lives are in your hands so I asked father may your blessing be upon us now and anoint your word to our hearts Lord may you grant the police Lord in Jesus Christ name Amen I mean God bless you all you may have your seats so it's quite a quite a scene we've read here with speaking of Legion I just wanted to point that out with with with who was worshiping there and we're gonna come back to that but brother brownie says and the message identification he says now may the Lord had his blessings to the reading of his word I'd like to take for a few minutes of your time on what I would call or like to say a text called identification identifying identified in the likeness of Bible characters being identified in the likeness of Bible characters and tonight as I thought an approach to this after we have this begin talking of us coming and how that the church should make itself ready he says I'm sure tonight we ought to find ourselves somewhere in some character of the Bible so that we would know the outcome of that character and know what our outcome will be amen so we want to be identified in the scripture and every man woman and child will be identified in the scripture but it's really what you give yourself to as what you'll be identified and now brother cadre said this at camp and it really blessed me how he said when Abel offered the lamb God could identify himself and that sacrifice because he was a lamb so now if you go all the way through the scripture you can see where God identifies himself with the people now when I when I speak of him being identified it's because he can see himself in that life hallelujah he could not see himself in Cain sacrifice because that was not what God was God was not fruit he was a lamb hallelujah so so now you know so when God can see himself in our lives then he will anoint our lives accordingly so you see Moses Moses went down to Egypt as a deliverer and God could identify himself in Moses ministry because he was the deliverer so he anointed Moses life accordingly to manifest that deliverer and see you can go all the way down through the scripture and you see when man begins or man a woman began to begin to move according to the promise of God God says I can identify myself in that life and he anoints that life the supernatural takes place and God vindicates his word to that person you take like the shunammite woman God gave them the baby supernaturally she couldn't have a child you know and and and and the prophets had to a servant you know she's been good to us look they've built this little room for us here as we journey through and you know what do you think we could do you know to - you're you're in Thanksgiving back you know do you think we talked to the king or whatever more but you know the servants here but they have no children and so now then then the inspiration moved on the Prophet said go tell that woman thus saith the Lord you're going to have a child and she had a son but then it was out with us dead in the field and it got heat stroke you know and you know got sick and it died but that woman now now God is gonna see what the woman was gonna do because God wanted to identify himself in her life again hallelujah so it wasn't just a one time where where because she was good to the Prophet that she got a blessing now God was going to put her under a test to identify herself in his Amit did identify himself in her life I mean said I hear she was she had been given a child by promise but now death had struck the child what was she gonna do she was either gonna bury the child she had a choice you could either bury the child say well that was wonderful but now the blessings God or she could go back to that man of God because she knew that the Prophet God was in that prophet and she knew if I could just get him to that just get my boy to him I mean he can raise him from the dead because the one who raised it did in the past was the same God that was in the Prophet I mean so she said to her a servant said of them you'll what's gonna go get him hallelujah and then the Prophet you know beginning yoga has he or whatever it was the servant looked and saw the Shoom light coming and you know and in the Shulamite said you know it's all well with thee was asked she said all as well she's got a dead son on a bed at home but she's saying all as well why because she's are about to be identified with a resurrection because God was going to look at her life and say I can identify myself in this woman's faith now you've got to understand from the get-go God gives us that faith it's not our own ital that's a nice idea I'll try that all this is a good idea or someone else has tried it no it's not that it's when God moves on your heart gives you the revelation that the word will come to pass then you act upon that then God says I can identify myself in that life olia see you know the rest of story she comes his all as well but when she gets within striking do you're reaching business grabs the grabs his robe and you're helping back you hallelujah God can identify himself on that and that woman's desire to see her son raised from the dead hallelujah so know that and then you know there is a story the Prophet goes to the house lays himself on the child you know who his dead life comes back and the child is restored God moved in a supernatural way cause he got identify himself in that woman's faith a man you can take you know a brother brand when you know he's flying through Memphis and as plane is grounded I mean because you wanna see this woman could identify herself in the scripture she saw her son often to the world she saw her son become sick didn't know what it was some social disease she saw him getting sicker and sicker till eventually he he was lying there basically you know hanging you know between life and death just cried mum it's dark oh it's dark mama you know and and but she was praying and she began to pray Lord Lord I'm like the Shunammite woman she could identify herself in the scripture now this is not how we have many thousand years ago this is this is an our generation she can identify herself with the scripture said Lord you gave me the son now you've got to restore the son and she wasn't necessarily worried about his physical health she just wanted to know that he'd be saved before he went up into the eternity and so she began to pray thank God I'm like I'm like the Shunammite woman where's my Elijah where's my prophet hallelujah and God had the prophet oh you're in the place the plane was grounded not because of the prophets faith it was that woman's faith caused the storm I mean which caused the plane to be grounded hallelujah that same faith is in your life if God reveals you who you are in the scripture then how they overcome their outcome will be your outcome and her outcome was God gave a revision when she was praying she'll brother Bram walking down the street so before dawn she was there on her sitting there you know leaning on her gate waiting he's coming where is he and she was laying there and their brother Burt and then now God begins to act on both ends the planes grounded brother says why let's go for a walk or whatever he decide to do and then the Lord the oh he's just looking some some shop Lord says start walking just start walking it's quite a distance from where that was to where she lived it's quite a bit he just walked keep walking down into that color district this is and then finally he's walking past she's leaning on the fence because why the one that God showed was coming was walking down was more than a vision now the visuals becoming material hallelujah it's the same thing with you and I when you see this when you see yourself identified in the word I mean you know it's not just me to stay as a vision it must become flesh so here she comes or he comes down and she just says good morning parson he says good morning aunty as they would address each other and well how did you know as a parson they begin to talk but then she said you but where's your where's your suitcase he lifted in the hotel see then then then you know she's invite summon tells the story he says I've been in King's palaces but there was nothing like this god bless our home on the your front door it's a little shotgun house but he said this is far greater than apalis and he says now you pray and then he said you could tell she knew who he was who she was talking to well I'm just talking to the ear something no she knew him that's the main thing you got to know him hallelujah and then and then brother BAM prayed and then he just forget to go it's getting like mama it was not his prayer it was her prayer that brought her son that was going to be lost died lost to be come back to life again her faith you know we got to understand we're living in an age of an anointed people it's not just an anointed profit or anointed minister it's now an anointed people I mean just like we read about I mean I mean brother ed was saying about killing the Philistines and you know I was reading the scripture you know David came to a point where he couldn't kill Giants no more he got too old but then others rose up to take his place so the next generation rose up to finish off the Giants that David was meant to kill he picked up five stones when he crossed the brook to face Goliath why'd he pick up five because because Goliath had sons and brothers there are other Giants in the land that had been destroyed hallelujah but David didn't do the job the younger generation did it so when from anointing on one man committing police' now we're living in age of an anointed people not United ministry anointed profit now anointed people police are the same anointing on the prophets on you probably the same anointing on Jesus Christ is on you how the same life those in him as on you hylian you're going to recognize who you recognize what's in you I meant take honor his word whatever you do don't shrink back and say someone else to do it no you do it holy that's when you come to a place where you recognize no one else is going to stand I'm going to stand I'm going to take God at His Word I'm going to play those Philistines hallelujah Jenga recognized that he was a circumcised Jew God could identify himself in his life that's why when he ran jumped out the windows we heard this morning with an ox code Georgia I can identify myself in your life Holly and supernaturally he killed every one of them why cos God said I can identify myself in that kind of a life I mean he wasn't rich he didn't have servants he had nothing but he knew he as a circumcised Jew standing is in his inheritance that was enough brother Ram said it's the same thing with you know all the Devils on my back I got these problems that's going on you want to recognize your son and daughter of God standing in the land standing in your inheritance hallelujah and you're gonna recognize that is enough hallelujah doesn't matter what the devil fights you with you gonna recognize who you are and don't ever just think oh really no really hallelujah Amen you we go down over all the way down through the scripture God identifies himself supernaturally because he can see himself in the life so you can say no so everything we do everything all in everything in word or deed do the name of Jesus Christ right way because God wants to identify himself in your life in everyday life not just in church this is actually the least amen Wednesday night whenever whenever there's no everyday life as when the word puts on flesh I mean so everything we do everything we wear we say how we treat one another how we treat our family how we treat our children God should be able to look down and say I can identify myself in that life hallelujah I can identify how we speak to other may your speech be seasoned with grace with sure yes sir how you speak to other God sure so I can identify myself and what they're saying and anoint that word to that person probably how we treat one another preferring one another in love God you better look out and say I can identify myself because I see myself living in those people hallelujah it's how it should be help us Lord right man that's why I say Lord that yeah that's why we're gonna die daily - if you can't live at the same time I will be you or the Lord who do you want to live I know if I'm living it's a train wreck you must just drive off the cliff it's not always gonna end badly but I don't mean that as a joke but you know humanities fails people are we gonna sort this out no we're not going to sort out nothing God's got to sort it out amen hallelujah no but so with Legion Legion God could not identify himself in legions worship because it wasn't the man worshiping it was the devil it's amazing when you look into the story of Legion it's only in Mark's Gospel where it actually identifies that Legion worship God Legion worship Jesus and we know Mark's Gospel that's under that ox anointing it just goes into the works of John the Baptist and Christ all works works works that's how it's a that's how the gospel is written so so it says the only account and the Gospels of the deliverance of Legion were it says that the Legion of Devil's and the man caused him to worship God we have to be very careful we see people worship God but what's worshiping as it as it is it the Holy Ghost in them as in a sincere heart or is actually a devil pretending to worship because if we're not careful we're not careful it can actually be an unclean spirit and someone worshiping God and it's not ours at this I trust the Lord just makes us come down the middle right because the life at the end that'll produce what the worshipers it's the life of the end it was very obvious with Legion he was cutting himself in the tombs naked crazy demon-possessed here it comes to fall down and worship God so it's very obvious there's something wrong with this man because of the life he's living right but then you bring it into our circles and people can dress right people can can act right they can quote right they can quote the scripture you're the devil can out quote any every language under heaven he can quote the message to you and the scripture and it can be 100% exactly right but he can't live the life he can never produce life in the word he cannot do that but the believer by the blood of Jesus Christ can Amen and that's when God can identify himself in life I mean it's when his life is and you say well I fail many times we're prone to failure we're human right the only day the moment we will stop failing is the moment these bodies change hallelujah right that's why we need a blood that's why we need a high priest that's why we need a mediator amen for every moment up till then we need one because we're prone to failure because we're human but in the same token it that's very different someone who's you know to Legion in that state because the life after the worship what is it amen you're with me now so Legion here here is Legion I just want to show you how demon power works Legion became isolated he lived in the tombs and in the mountains he was so he surrounded himself with death isolation crying to himself and cutting himself this is demon spirits where someone becomes isolated now to be isolated doesn't mean you go live up in the mountain somewhere be hermit you can be isolated even in the service right now you can be isolated in your family you can be you know you could be living in a boarding school nones abundance you'll hear but I've been there but you can be isolated living with 70-yard boys in a boarding school amen you could be in a very big family and be isolated why cuz that's what demon powers do they try and isolate I mean because when the body comes together there's a part of God part of God comes in the bonfire God comes down deliverance can happen that's why it tries to isolate us out how does the isolate us in here and our thoughts no one cares about me no and understands me these people don't accept me you know what happens Pearson becomes isolated Amen people surround themselves by death now and back in my day we had the goth culture and then the emo culture people dress in black lots of death and skulls and it's just evolved to something else what's happening people are anointed with death they isolate themselves we had a lot of especially the rock bands in my dates all this teenage angst you know no one understands it you know that's how it was because what's happening is the devil because what happens is when people go through any change in life especially when teenagers become adults is such a massive change so now you're actually working out Who am I because you actually go you making a transition from from from being as part of the family transitioning to becoming an individual and eventually you make a transition from being part of a family to making your own family but it's at in-between time it's always the transition time which is the difficult time and then so now you're so now you're getting frustrated because you want to grow up and become an adult and you are but then your parents are a certain way because they have to protect you you look at the you look at nature do like any herd animal do they let the little little newborns just run off they don't just go right off into the savanna enjoy the great you know kruger just go they don't the big ones are protecting the little ones because the little ones have probably never experienced a lion before they've never ever experienced a hyena pack or cheetahs or a leopard one they've never experienced it and it and their mummy and daddy could say you know now son there's something called a lion what made this big mark on the ground that's a lion poor whatever you know you know and and but then even though the chart the little one could see that they don't know what a line can do and the description of the line by the parents never matches the actual lion right and sometimes what could happen it's a little one now I was there too my parents moved overseas I was in boarding school they moved overseas what did I begin to think my parents don't understand me they don't care that was me as a teenager we've all been there before and I really thought that did they did they not care about me no they loved me they cared about me but that was what I got in my mind then what happens then you don't you can't talk to them well who are you gonna talk to talk to your peers and I just want to maybe just drop a bomb your peers don't have the best advice Solomon's son when he was being gonna be made King the the elders in the country said make the taxes and the burden lighter on the people this is the ones who with Solomon the older ones but he talked to us as his peers to the same age and they said not Tek some more what happened the nation split because he listened to the wrong advice you gotta be kidding you can't experience you can't read you can't learn experience from reading in a book or watching it on YouTube or whatever you have to experience it to have experiences so you've got to actually realize you know that US older ones we've been through a few things and we've been through what you're going through it's just been rebranded like spark is still Telecom different logo different name does the same thing and the devilry brands he went from the Beatles to like the Rolling Stones and Led Zeppelin and all the way down through to other we to to whatever's out now same devil just rebranded you see yeah what's her name Lady Gaga we I I had an interview on her and she actually had posters of like different different artists that were older than her that she admired she put them up in a room and prayed make me crazy she wanted to draw the inspiration that that they had and become greater than them and what happened prayer answered why because just rebut the same devil rebranded amen now you can even take the same thing in the sports world you can't compare people try and make all the best rugby team in history you can't take people from a generation ago and put them with the players today they would never ever be in the they wouldn't even be in the squad they're smaller they're weaker they're not as skilled amen you take okay so we had John Kirwan who who knows John Kirwan this is now I'm just showing where my era there's John Cohen he had the fend he had that fend Jonah Lomu picked up the same friend basically push the guy in the face as he's trying to tackle him John a lot John Kirwan was way smaller than John Loma but he used the same tactics because he drew inspiration from that that player that was the generation before what happened he drew from it became greater now why are you saying these things you have to be careful what you're looking at you ought to be careful what you're actually saying I want to be like right and us and and it's like the young ones and like the elephant herd or whatever heard the young ones are protected by the adults because the adults know what a lion is I'm going back to that story they've seen it they've experienced a lion trying to kill them they know what it's like and we know what it's like for a devil to try and kill us amen we know what suicide suicidal thoughts like depression is like I know what that's like I know it's a you know drinking and you know being having alcohol poisoning all terrible I know what it's like I know what that Devil's like to try and kill me amen and we and you could identify any anything under the Sun even religious pride sure there's that Devils to kill some of us trying to think with something awesome that's just a devil Chyna stop us what we mean what we mean to be holier-than-thou kind of attitude legalistic Pharisee that's a spirit and it will try and get you for Ken but to hear about it and to fight against this two different things fighting against you know mind battles and things spirits trying to come in I know what it's like cuz I've seen that lion but how God is greater than any any demon power anywhere anytime hello peer pressure I know what that's like to overcome hallelujah try just uh I've just got to fit in we're gonna fit in where are you gonna fit in because your friends will probably go become friends with someone else and where are you gonna be I just want to fit in with the crowd you know I probably told this before but one of my best drinking buddies at yuning I was at I was at so forth forum what's fourth forum nowadays year ten yet in here here's one of my mates a boarding school that I went to another school then he came to the same university as me I don't know we were the best buddies best drinking buddies the Lord got ahold of me and then the next time I didn't tell him anything about next time I saw him you know I said you know we're in the supermarket and it's like he didn't want to spend another second in my presence I didn't try and pour pour the gospel down to sort nothing well what happened well I don't know we were he found other friends I just got dropped my friends left me so you gotta be careful who you tried identify identified the Lord Jesus Christ amen he'll see you through well I just got to prove myself I just proved yourself with the Lord let him prove himself to you rather a means a legion became isolated crying in the tombs cutting himself why people try and alleviate the pain and the misery they earn by doing all sorts of stuff people get tattoos because it means something about some past something or they cut themselves or people do that today where's that from this it's actually a tormenting spur cuz there's no peace in here because somehow the doors come open pain or something's happened and the devil steps into that pain and says now I'm gonna make room I'm gonna come live in this place and then it just gets worse and then he says come buddies this room for us all you know we say well we just gone through some stuff and actually many times it's just demon powers try to have preeminence in our lives trying to take over you've got to recognize that's not me I mean something that makes you feel useless worthless no place anywhere that's not you and it's certainly not God that is not the Lord Jesus Christ one but that's a demon trying to rob you of your life you've got a you've got to identify what it is and it's not you saying that it's actually a devil amen I've seen that lyin but you got identify for us and it doesn't mean you're an unbeliever what's the first thing comes and the devil comes them or something and they said oh you just don't have it because of this oh no we have to fight everything we have to overcome something right you have to overcome the Lord remember he was to identify himself in your life so he's gonna give you things to overcome because he wants to manifest his overcoming power and you hallelujah now Legion brother brownie says and from that time he says as a maniac one day up and get her who was cutting himself and they bound them and changed and espousals ten times an ordinary man could break the powers of them chains you know we have changed today people try and cope with things and they're about this big it's a pill nothing wrong if you've got to take them but don't let it stay that way just to make something dormant you get rid of it they meant those things help but don't just say well this is means the rest of my life is just how it has to be as I trust this is coming out okay I'm for medicine but God is the healer sometimes you just got to give God something to work with right because sometimes because remember God God is not a cookie cutter when David killed Goliath with a slingshot did he use that again no sir God came this so he killed the line in the beer angle either with a slingshot after that he never picks up a slingshot again he has a sword right and God shows them different ways to fight different enemies because god that's why God is sometimes he just incident like instantly answers your prayer God heal me of this gone hallelujah your faith has risen but then he wants to show you that's not the only way I'd do it because I want to mold character into you faith worketh patience rides and sometimes you may even get the same sickness Lord heal me I fear I have the same faith that's like there's nothing and you wait and there may be someone comes along and says well how's your diet it's God working you got to be sensitive to God working you know maybe you got to change your diet or maybe you need to go see the doctor oh yeah and then you slowly get better or you come forward and get prayed for lay hands upon the sick and they shall recover or your parents pray for your soul embrace you lay hands on the sick they shall recover and you slowly get better it's the same God working in different ways amen so there was a maniac one day gather us I'll just read this again who was cutting himself and they bound him and changed and his power was ten times an ordinary man could break the powers of them chains I always thought if he was so perfectly under the influence of the devil when the devil takes hold of a person and saying it makes men and men to hold him he breaks them chains completely surrenders the devil if he could break chains how much more could we break completely surrender to God how much more powerful is God's power than the devil's there he was this poor maniac and he was always out there in the graveyard cutting himself with stones and attacked everybody but one day he met God things changed for him after that he was clothed in his right mind why he had met God a leper stood by the gate begging one day hmm excuse me one day Jesus Nazareth passed by and said if thou will thou can make me clean he said I will be thou clean and from then on he was clean so Jesus was Jesus was on his way to where that man was in the tombs we don't know how long he was in that condition but that doesn't matter amen he didn't start off one day he was saying a normal next day in the tombs something happened to him open a door one devil God and a beast he got worse and worse and worse and he found himself where he was but Jesus knew where he was the resurrection and the life was actually making his way towards where that man was and it's the same thing today you've got nah this is you're gonna recognize the same God that walked the shores of Galilee is exactly the same one here right the same Jesus it's not a different Jesus it's not Alyssa Jesus and as exactly he's the same in power he's the same in authority he's the same in deliverance he's the same in healing is the same in peace all that he is it's in the believer I remember programs had all that God poured into Christ yo-yo all that God was he brought himself into Christ and although he poured into Christ he poured into them you should say me hallelujah well the scripture says - were filled with the fullness of God hallelujah so exactly the same one is present in 2019 just not in his corporal body we're gonna meet that in the air hallelujah that's gonna be a glorious time amen see season first Corinthians 2 and 12 how we have received not the spirit of the world but the Spirit which is of God that we might know the things which are freely given to us of God hallelujah which things also we speak not in the words which man's wisdom teacheth excuse me do we have but which is the Holy Ghost teacheth comparing spiritual things with spiritual but the natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God for they are foolishness unto him neither can he know them because they are spirit they discern but he that is spiritual judgeth all things yet himself as judged of no man for who has known the mind of the Lord that he may instruct him but we have the mind of Christ I mean so the mind of Christ is in the people today they men we have the mind of Christ we're not guessing we know because it's been revealed to us I mean we know the things that are freely given to us of God why cuz we don't have the spirit of the world where the Spirit of God hallelujah so now if we know the things freely given unto us and we will go and get them we will become not just professors but possessors so a professor just says it's - - mind a possessor says I have it hallelujah just like Abraham with Isaac he says I've got him where is he he's coming he's here 25 years later his revelation became material that's the same thing with us we don't just say we have it we have it Memphis is a substance of things not seen in evidence of things hoped for I mean so and that word hope means an expectation so it's the evidence of things not seen that's the yes it's the expectation of the young sorry let's go to Hebrews 11 we'll get back to Legion bran he's on his way now faith is the substance of things hoped for so it's the substances the evidence of things expected for the evidence of things not seen so faith is not a hope so that you know you haven't Amen it's an evidence it's a proof that you have it and it's and it's things that would hope as an expectation usually with pleasure so you know it you know you're actually expecting it as we heard on Wednesday expectation faith gives us expectation hallelujah so now if the Spirit of the Lord reveals to us the things freely given to us of God what does it do it gives us an evidence that we have it the things that are expected hallelujah so you know if you're sitting légion in the tombs yeah got to have an expectation this is not my final destination the devil may have robbed me may have done all kinds of things to me I may be in the state but Jesus is on his way and Jesus is here now hallelujah season Philippians foreign voices rejoice in the Lord always and again I say rejoice let your moderation be known unto all men the the Lord is at hand it says be careful for nothing now that would careful it means to be anxious about so be anxious about nothing don't be stressed don't be worried don't be concerned and now that doesn't mean don't be no it doesn't say basically so don't be blase yeah it comes goes whatever sweet as she'll be right that's not what this is saying it's saying don't be anxious don't get stressed about it how's this going to happen I don't know God said God said in his word it's become revealed to me I know it's going to happen hallelujah so don't be anxious about nothing but in everything by prayer and supplication with Thanksgiving let your requests be known unto God and the peace of God which passes all understanding shall keep your hearts and minds through Christ Jesus finally brethren whatsoever things are true whatsoever things are honest whatsoever things are just whatsoever things are pure whatsoever things are lovely whatsoever things are of a good report if there be any virtue if there be any praise think on these things those things which he have both learned and received and heard and seen in me do and the God of peace shall be with you hallelujah so he shouldn't be anxious about nothing just walk on with God whatever is going on just walk on with him but Legion came to his place in this life where something happened to him and it allowed a devil to come and he was a believer but then this happened to him and he found himself going in a downward cycle where he then he eventually found himself crying depressed alone cutting himself and that surrounded by death they meant you you see people do you not people some some people wear black because they like the color other people wear black because they're actually surrounded by Death amen that's how was it my day Goths emo skulls death black whatever yeah what it's actually a spirit they didn't stay you know often I you know you know you see people they never you know people on the street they never how they are now they never started that way there was some little girl some little dad's little bundle of joy someone's sweetheart some mother's little bundle of joy they never started how they finished or how they are right now something happened to them which caused them to end up that way even even people who seemed to be very successful but what they do if they basically get rid of their families they'll just get rid of whatever that stands in their ambition in the way of their ambition I don't believe they started that way but something came in so now I'm just trying to cover every aspect of society we can be here in George Street we say what happened to them or he can be the richest person in the world well what happened to them because all they want is greed and make a name for themselves and fame and you know something happened to both those people which was bad to the world one is great and one is not but it's bad things of it because why they get rid of their families they cut you know they cut bad deals they do all kinds of terrible things and it's all out of selfishness what happened they never say yeah you take little children they're all lovely amen and they they give me little two-by-fours but they're wonderful things you know but then you look at that and you just go a few years and you go well what happened from they were like this and then now they're like this we know it's because sure we are born in a fallen state but the devil comes in and just cripples people up and that's not what we meant to be Legion was not meant to be Legion bad things happened to us all those people out there the bride all the same things happened to us we can't stop it we can't stop bad things happening even if we even if we said ok friends I've just bought a hundred hectares in the back of a Katara we're all off the grid bad things will still happen you can't escape the world naturally people try and they prep and they do whatever you can't escape the bet because the Devils in here right but that's how you allow it to affect you how you respond can God identify himself in your response even to your enemy he said love your enemies do good to them that you know treat you badly can you do that and then God says I can i anoint that life as you treat them that way amen so he ended up brother and says one so one day way down and land of Gator I know no doubt a sociable god-fearing citizen once lived he got out with the wrong crowd maybe just married and had two or three little kitties but he got mixed up in the wrong group and that's where many a young man and young woman loses out getting mixed up in the wrong group the wrong associates and so one day they'd taken him out give him a drink I played a little game will do this gamble a little it won't hurt then the first devil entered him he went home and has to tell his wife a lie the second devil entered him and until he was possessed with a legion and he got beyond any help and the poor fellow was drove out into the tombs but then Jesus came I'm just gonna wrap this up but then Jesus came but then there was worship but it was the devil worshiping God it wasn't the man that was worshiping because Jesus asked him who are you we're legion for him any it wasn't the man speaking it was the devil in him worshiping but the life that was being lived behind that worship wasn't wasn't a God living life amen help us Lord Jesus and brother BAM says now it comes down like an like in Jesus day there were the disciples and they were the scribes and Pharisees they were pole opposite one had joy peace God living the other was dead formal powerless proud arrogant people but but but brother and says now adays it comes to this he calls it the thin edge of the wedge so it comes down to the very close where the people can say the same thing they can quote the same prophet they can say amen to the same quotes they can aim in the same scripture they can quote the same scripture but one has the life of the word and the other does not that's the thin edge of the which it's when God comes down identifies himself anew what is the purpose of what is the purpose of this that he would live in people that is that is what is Christianity God living in man that is the purpose why did he die that he would live in you data would go from quoting to living remember brother you know I think it's brother on Spencer said you know God's not going to wrap your Bibles your Bible will stay here your message books will stay here your tablets will stay here hallelujah I mean those things will stay here but God is going to rapture human beings that are full of his presence full of his word that is the only thing going in the rapture as when God can identify himself in the life and say that's part of me upon the earth I'm not leaving it on the earth no more they're coming to where I am hallelujah so it's the thin each of the which what life are you producing you can say all the right things you know we could have this church perfect some churches as a doctrine you've got to wear a certain time that is right so we could we could be outwardly perfect perfect but as God here as God here I would rather pick up and Magento's and jeans if that's all I had if that's the best I had and God live I know that's an extreme case but I've been and I've been in Papua New Guinea literally wearing just gendell's yo t-shirt and you know not a tie and this stuff God comes down speaks to those people those things that I don't they have even seen here hallelujah it's our attitude towards the word that matters I'm not discounting wearing this right I think it's good but you know but it's our attitude we can be all outwardly right with a stinking attitude trying to destroy one another speaking ill of one another tearing one another down you know unhappy discontented strife envy going through what is that but yet worship what is that that's legion thank you what else is it it's not God and kind of God and kind of God than kind of not God than the devil that's God or Satan two different ones but here it was he went out with it did were don't be an individual ated in your family don't because that leads to a slippery slope you'll end up like this and you'll be tormenting you know I tried to drink my own happiness away didn't work people try and do way worse of things but I tried to drown it you know it doesn't help that there's no lasting satisfaction been there done that got the scars wish I never had to but God allows it and God allows you to remember it because that will keep you thankful that you're delivered color that's why we clear that's why we don't rejoice and what we once did but we rejoice that we're free that's why God told the children of Israel tell your children your children's children what you came out of your slaves you're beaten you are just a tool in the Pharaohs hand tell them where you came from that's why we're going to always tell our children where we came from they may not understand it be say this is what I once was and this is why I want nothing to do with it because it bound me up it twisted me up and gave me trouble in my mind I had no peace I had to erase I had no joy nothing lost that nothing was satisfying I thought I found it that it just fell apart I thought I found it I fell apart I went here tried this win it tried this win it tried this nothing satisfied until one day the Lord Jesus came in my life transformed me and now I found peace now I found satisfaction now I found joy now I found love now found acceptance and I never never never never never never never never want to go back never ever you could honestly I would rather be homeless on the street with the revelation of Jesus Christ then the richest richest man in all the world hallelujah you say well wolf I had a billion dollars what could I do and what then everyone it doesn't matter how rich say I have great technology is there come to a point where the stops beating this stops and there's words pronounced over their body they did time of death and then what you got to think about it he said well why are you going this way we have life we have the greatest the greatest thing is eternal life lelou you you know if I tell this wrong I'm sorry but your brother Ferdie was telling me a testimony of his mum and so she was having an operation not that long ago and she actually had an out-of-body experience and she had no fear just had peace was so happy and then she was actually going up above you up into heaven and she looked down and she saw all the people people in Auckland or burdened down like this but then he's but then she saw where where the youth were doing outreach and they're singing and brother Zion singing about love will conquer the world or love is what the world needs are you singing about the Lord and all those people that heard heard that heard that singing and saw the believers they stood up straight the burdens kind of left them there happy and before this brother Ferdie said that he was wondering is the outreach doing anything they they didn't understand the supernatural part of it and then she was about and then she got taken up she's about to go through the gates into heaven but then a voice said to her your purpose on earth is not done and now she's back alive on the earth but she had and you can ask Christine about when she nearly departed this world no fear peace didn't really want to come back why is that cause the sudden question is sidled hallelujah so it doesn't matter what happens to this thing blessed assurance Jesus is mine i what a foretaste of glory divine oh yeah he says I'll just finish with this I don't want be too much longer but see this poor fellow he was drove out into the tombs the dead place and they bound him with chains and they could and he could pluck them asunder now when the devil possesses a person he becomes me times of strengthen if a devil can give you twice your strength what do you what do you think God could do for people sitting here in a wheelchair what do you think God could do to you that's a sinner if the devil can drive you into a barroom will get you into the street immorally or doing the things of the world which is contrary to your own nature because you were born to be a son and daughter of God now I just say this I used to the weekend for me started on a Wednesday ended on Monday we would go out into town this is this is in Christ Church it ones like basically the whole University was it the other night life was what they call pumping I remember going there once being sober and I was singing this is madness wasn't even a Christian and why because you ought to come under the influence of something to enjoy it and that's how many people yeah many things in the world you got actually become drunk or stoned or high or whatever to enjoy it you know and many people they needed they need a drink in their hand to actually become sociable why why do you need a substance to fit into somewhere you know God didn't God and make now you gotta have this to fit in in the world you following me you know but but that's how the world is you got to be drunk or stoned or high whatever you got to be on something uppers downers whatever's you know to to cope to fit in we don't want to be that way you know when you're in it you think it's awesome but when you can look soberly whether you think man that's crazy let's be sober-minded hallelujah now because see which is contrary to your own nature cause you were born to be a son and daughter of God and the devil could make you do things and cheat on your husband cheat on your wife steal cheat lie how much more can God do when he gets full possession of you and this fellow Legion wants a gentleman no hopes now he's out in the tombs with the devil and year after year he got worse and worse and he got so that no man could pass that way no he didn't want to hurt anyone he knew better than to do that but every time he's seen someone the devil would jump on him and he would go and try and kill that person till everyone feed him he was executed from all society from the from the city the devil had drove him out of his mind and he was out in the tomb the darkest hour he had ever seen and then Jesus came along and he cast the Devils out of him and those Devils went into a herd of hogs and they had sense enough to drown themselves I often wondered when I get to heaven I'd like to see how much strength his testimony had against hog raisers in that country after that you know I often think about it there were 2,000 hogs drowned that's a lot of pigs it's not just one or two that's a mass drowning there was a big thing but when the when when the hog raisers began to testify to this manner being delivered but the hogs were drowned it was in such a way that the people of the city didn't want Jesus around he sees and that they didn't want any revival think how sad this is they didn't want any revival if it was going to cost them some hogs they felt more at home with the hogs and the Devils than they did with the Lord Jesus they wanted their hogs and asked him to leave crazy and that's the way it is tonight people would rather stay in their old stale formal ungodly indifferent condition than to put up with a little wild fire now and then I'd rather have a thousand times to one they feel better at home with the Devils and in their old condition drinking smoking gambling wearing all dirty clothes and bobbing off their hair and doing all this other stuff that they do feel more at home doing that and they then you do to be called old-fashioned and have Jesus around the house I'll take him a hundred billion times to one the darkest hour then Jesus came along could you imagine Legion going back to his home finding where he used to live the little wife had to sell the place he wanted to wish yours at so he searched from place to place finally someone said she lives down the alley and when he goes down there and two old little tin shack then when the children see him coming they run to hide the wife grabbed up a little shawl put it on her and started out the gate he said never mind honey never mind children come here to Daddy I want you to take I want to take you in my arms I want to put my arms around you sweetheart your little dresses at or off oh she said what happened he said Jesus came along that's what made the difference our wife babies come here it was the darkest time the Devils were to tormenting me and then Jesus came along that's more than a story that's more than a that's more than a story that's more than someone else's testimony he's the same God today however he can do the same deliverance that man was out of his mind he couldn't pray he couldn't seek deliverance but some one of us he was praying for him amen and Jesus came along and that same Jesus can do the same deliverance Amy to those you say well there's no hope for them hold on hold on just let Jesus go along and you'll see they won't end up that way hallelujah just let Jesus come along you gotta just only belief hallelujah don't put don't put conditions it can't be done no it can be done if Jesus can can deliver that man if Jesus can deliver the Apostle Paul up to here in religion if Jesus can heal the woman deliver the woman of the world all these examples in when going all the way through the message people blaspheme people that all kinds of things but Jesus came along and delivered them gave them peace gave them salvation he's still the same God today hallelujah we say it's nothing's happened just wait just let Jesus come along oh yeah how Louie's mighty to save amen absolutely can we have the musicians please hallelujah say well I feel isolated my family doesn't understand me no one knows what I'm going through these people here could never put themselves in my shoes you'd be surprised you'd be shocked quite frankly if everyone stood up and gave their testimony didn't just just sugarcoat it a little bit and actually see how it really was you'd be shocked you mean you went through that you actually did that you actually enjoyed that in your fallen state I'll be honest hey you're born you're born and fallen state I enjoyed what I want what I once was in my fallen state but then Jesus came along and the things I once did I can't do not because I have to keep myself and all what will people think no that's not that's not it I mean changes your nature that what you once loved you hate and once you hated you and you now love and you can't help but it's like he just flicks a switch why because you give all your heart to him but if you come to them but you've actually got some fire exit to run through he'll never take you you'll be willing to say Lord every bridge has been burned there's no turning back Here I am and Jesus will come along hallelujah let's stand shall we let's just give him thanks aren't you this is Thanksgiving weekend I'm so glad I was once a Richard viola sooner but then Jesus came along hallelujah Oh redeemed redeemed how we love to proclaim it Lord dear God I just want to ask father as Lord you take these chopped-up words lord I just I wish I could express Lord how much you mean to me Lord it's not just emotion Lord the father love is real divine love is real Lord you're real my god Lord and father we we do have joy unspeakable full of glory Lord we were once like Legion look maybe outwardly we look we we look like we had
