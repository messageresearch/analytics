[Music] you [Music] okay hello everyone welcome to zoom Kitsch wave if you can hear me um how is everyone doing wave if you're good wave if your bed I'll just check the other screens so um it's it's nice to be able to gather albeit it's a unique experience gathering in separate places it's not quite the same as I'm being a church admittedly I did sneak into church the other day to get a guitar lead and um I must admit I felt really good being in church again I missed it I thought man it's nice being in this this place you know the sanctuary the place that we've set aside for the Lord and you know I thought I can't wait till we can be back in here and gather together again in person and you know we're very privileged in this day and age that we can we've got access to a lot of places why we can have motor vehicles and go and see a lot of people you know I think back from when and pools they you know it for them to go to another area was it was a big deal you know like if it was five hundred kilometres away or a thousand kilometres that he would they would plan the trip a year in advance and think maybe the next summer I'll go and was at the Brisbane up here so but they had it a lot harder than we do whereas weekend you know we can in New Zealand we can get in our car in the morning and almost was that anybody in the even time be any any Brethren's health's and the whole

Lord they were in such and such a privilege to see you all they men I trust that the Lord will do something special for us tonight Amen so god bless you all if you've got your Bibles handy let's stand and let's read read the scripture together I mean we're just going to go to revelations chapter 2 and then we're going to go to judges chapter 6 save me and praise the Lord trust you've all had a good week and just stop cheering the air I mean praise the Lord let's um let's go to revelations chapter 2 you want to wave your hand when you the arrow say I mean I'm just trying to make it that I can see you all there's everybody praise the Lord okay so in Revelation chapter 2 I'm gonna read verses one down to verse five and it says here unto the Angel of the Church of Ephesus write these things saith he that holdeth the seven stars in his right hand who walketh in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks I know thy works my labor of my patience and how they all can it's not beard in which you're evil and has tried them which say they are apostles and are not and has found him liars and is born and has patience and for my namesake has labored and has not fainted nevertheless I have somewhat against thee because thou has left my first love remember therefore from whence thou art fallen and repent and do the first works or else I'll come unto thee quickly and will remove thy candlestick from out of his place except thou repent let's go down to judge's and we're gonna read the first six verses of chapter six of Judges and I mean who's who's happy to be a Christian tonight God is true to all generations at all time eternal amen got this you're I mean so we just got to read judges 6 in verses 1 to 6 very familiar piece of scripture to all I trust it's the it's the story of Gideon we're just gonna bring a bit of a context out of this she said the children of Israel did evil in the sight of the Lord and the Lord delivered them into the hand of Midian 7 years and the hand of Midian prevailed against Israel and because of the Midianites the children of Israel made them the dens which are in the mountains and caves and strongholds you'd say they went into lockdown because the enemy was around and as it was and so it was when Israel had soand that the Midianites came up and Amalekites and the children of the east even they came up against them and they encamped against them and destroyed the increase of the earth till they come unto Gaza and lift no sustenance for Israel neither sheep to ox nor ass for they came up with the cattle and their tents and they came as grasshoppers for multitude for both they and their camels were without number they entered into the land to destroy it and Israel was greatly impoverish because the Emidio nights and the children of Israel cried unto the Lord amen let's bow heads in a word of Prayer Lord Jesus lovely Lord Jesus we come to you this this our Lord we just asking that you you will touch our hearts touch our lives like only you can father may you Lord come to our address tonight Lord may you minister Lord your word to our hearts O God father we want to thank you Lord that you're our God you're the one we've come to worship Lord it's it's wonderful truly to see each other but Lord we have come to see you this night Lord we've come to come into your presence and I just pray O God may you just move on every heart Lord may what you said the service service to accomplish might accomplish it Lord in our lives father please grind it bless the blood everyone who will hear this I pray may you just take control of the service we we yield that we surrender our lives our beings all we are into your hands Lord in Jesus Christ's name Amen I mean God bless you all you may have your seat I wonder if I could if I could title this list tonight I'd like to title it about being restored to our first love now we read here in the book of Acts where where the Ephesian you know the ephesian church age we understand it had not started the day of Pentecost my feels a span of time brother Graham tells us where the church was under filed an hour walk in the fullness of the word that they had but then there came an antichrist burden and the church actually fell from a position and we can see this and in what we read here in Revelation chapter 2 because even though the Lord commends them for their for their works and for their labor and for their patience and you know how they couldn't bid in which you're evil and you know thou has tried to him say their apostles that have not found them liars and has born and has patience and for my name's sake thou has labored I mean I mean labored have not fainted so he's saying you've done a lot of good things but he said nippleless I have somewhat against thee because thou hast left thy first love so even with me when the first church age started when the Ephesian age actually started that there that the bride in that age had already fallen from a position which was being in their first love and and we know brother Bram would preach and messages like paradox in 1965 and he'd say we have come to an Ephesians again and I believe that that we just wouldn't be restored to to wear this ephesian church is and wood and wood and and wood you'll be restored to this fallen state even though they had many great things but we would be restored back to our first love that divine love could now flow through the body of Christ once again and we know that this message restores us back to the original gospel it's not another gospel that we have received but we have been restored back before even the church I just started where the church was walking with God amen in a state of I believe divine love so the bedless not that we would just be restored to our first love but we would stay in our first love because they had the Holy Ghost like we do we know that the Holy Ghost was poured out through seven Church ages short manifests at different parts of the word as the you know we know the church went down your diet under persecution went underground came forth and a Reformation and so on but all down through the seven Church ages the Holy Ghost was manifesting himself but we know that in the evening time he's put out in his fullness because there's nothing to restrict him moving anymore cuz all the creeds and doctrines of man have been taken out of the way and brother Baron would even say that this this entire message releases the Holy Ghost upon people we were restored back to the day of Pentecost into the condition the church was in I mean but so the battle is now sure we have we have been restored to that place but then there's the battle can we stay in our first love and continue walking with God because he did not say they lost their salvation they still had their victory they still it overcoming their age but they fell from a position I mean and we don't want to just be a a people where we come in rejoicing praising God have our first love and then we fall from it and remain there so I want to I just want to basically ask these three questions and then answer these three questions and then hopefully this will come out in the right way but you know the what does it mean to have your first love there should be a good question to ask and what is the condition of someone who has lost their first love and what is the way back they meant that some you know I think that's a good question because of course we look at history and say well they they they think they left their first love we say well what's a person that has their first love what's a person that's fallen from their first love now I'm not talking about people who are lost I mean found and lost so I'm not talking about that they still had the Holy Ghost but they fell from that place of first love and we can see that the big thing they I believe what caused them to fall from that first love as you can see that the battle that they were facing is that Antichrist burned in their rage you know as as the Lord when he admonished that church and he says I know thy works in my labor I'm just repeating this for emphasis but I want you to see that they were battling against something and God was addressing it I know thy works and thy labour and thy patience and how they're not thou can us not be them what your evils they they would fight this do these people who had these religious Antichrist spirits and he says and he says thou has tried them so they've tried them by the word but say there are apostles they're saying they're original and are not and has found them liars and have fought and has patience and for my name's sake has labored and has not fainted so they're under a labor they're under a pressure they're under a burden and that burden was fighting this religious bird we know the you know the deepest wounds that ever come to a believer are not from the world can we all say Amen it's not it's not that Jesus was wounded in the house of his friends and was those he considered to be his closest ones wounded of the most and is the same down through every age is those ones that are that you'd consider a brother or a sister in the Lord and maybe they are amen but but it's those ones you have the ones you love the most we're in the most but we need to we need to combat not you know we need to withstand those things and not just shut down you know I was going to call this being coming out of spiritual lockdown right I mean because you know what happens is like like when we go into Gideon you'll see it is that is that them Israel did evil in the sight of the Lord but I'll say this wasn't all of Israel I don't believe had an idol in the house someone would have still been true genuine believers but in the Midianites came in and then they just said well we're just going to go onto lockdown because the enemy's just just just moving around our land we're being hurt too much who've been under too much trouble and so they made Dean's in caves and they just locked themselves away that was still Israelites they were still living in the Promised Land but they had gone until you could say spiritual lockdown and it's the same thing with you and I people can so so when you're in your first love all you care about is him right you're not worried about what others doing in the church you don't care about you know good times bad times you give the give the Lord glory that's all you're about has been caught up with him it's it's staying in that relationship doesn't matter if you have it all or if you have nothing doesn't matter if you've lost your job lost your house you know doesn't matter what happens because you're in that first love all you care about is him you take a natural you take a natural relationship it doesn't matter if your spouse's you know has no money he doesn't have a job could be you know thick as a short plank you know you know it can be all the negative code it doesn't matter because you're not caring about the circumstances of your relationship that's not why you love the person you love them because of who they are yeah right and that someone who's in their first love they don't care about if things are going well things are going bad you just love the person hallelujah that's big in the first love it's same thing with the Lord I mean those are in their first love it doesn't matter if they know doesn't matter if you know you know the whole life is going sideways their children are going sideways their whole you know your everything around them is falling apart if they're in their first love they will they'll just love him anywhere they'll praise him anyway man yes amen so so they'd say you know I feel I'm just coming in behind brother nd service last Wednesday I mean the plumbers in the house and it's the Lord Jesus Christ he's gonna unplug the pipes hallelujah he's very good at doing those kind of things I mean three so it's those in their first love you take you take a natural couple they can have not even to sin stir up together doesn't matter where they are they are in love with each other you take brother Brownwood you know how he married those two couples one was very rich and one was very poor and then I you know a while later you know he went to see the rich ones and that was you know they had this big mansion and they had all this fancy stuff and you know he like ripped up to the house and look through the window so they are fussing at one another but he knocked on the door open the door they you know they put on this big front door hi how are you everything's so wonderful and you'd asked him you know how's things going house you know house merits and I said oh it's just wonderful as yeah we just loved each other real good and you know and it's just a front and it's because they didn't really love each other they had a physical attraction sure but it wasn't a real love because they had it all but they were fussing because of it you know she was dancing with the sky and all these things were happening around about them an hour they didn't really love each other but then he went down to where the poor couple were and they're living in a converted boxcar and and and she was on his lap and they had no like no money at all and and he was telling her you know I saw the stress in the stars walking by the shop I saw the stress in the window and I just would love to bark for you and you know you're they had nothing they had nothing but she said that's all right honey that don't matter you know they were in love and program didn't even go into the boxcar cause he's he saw everything was actually going real well for them why they stayed in their first love hello Lou yeah I mean it didn't you know you know they you know they loved didn't diminish I'll say I'd probably even got greater and it should be the same thing with our Lord you know we fall in love with him he becomes our everything I mean and then and then he walks with us through life's journey he wants to build a relationship with us hallelujah thing is once people lose their first love you could say in a you know in a in a natural relationship then it's about the you know how well their life is going to get his based on how much money they have the holidays they have all you know maybe he says why does he is tall that he always was that way but you know when you first married him you love them but then now you're annoyed because he's fat because all conditions now it's not the actual person right oh he's got a dumb job money already always had a dumb job but it doesn't matter to you at first but now matters because workers applause I'm just I'm just taking the woman you know woman's perspective you know you know but but you know at first those things never mattered but now edits why cuz you you still love him you know the woman still loves the man but but she has fallen from her first love we're nothing really mattered if follow me yeah where is everybody how we doing yeah amen so that's what happens when people lose their first love for the Lord things go sideways they get down you know they want you know and see they're just trusting him and worshiping him anyway walking with them anyway so uh you know this has happened and they get down and their relationships I feel you know that you know they become cold and withdrawn because you're unexpected things happen unexpected things always happen I mean but we don't want to go on to spiritual lockdown amen amen just like the children of Israel the Midianites came and they see it's just this I'll hide up on the hills this huxley this single you know you know hopefully it'll just it'll it'll blow over whatever ball we're just gonna go on the lockdown but it didn't help them none but that was still Israelites now living in the land now and they promised land but they weren't enjoying the benefit of it none and that's the same thing now we know this nation is in lockdown as while I was thinking along these lines now this nation now I just I just I just wrote some things down about this so this nations in lockdown and it's aw it's only just functioning right it's your God's a time when they decided this is essential so it's gonna continue this is not essential it's not going to continue and so and we're all in our homes and you know whatever more but the place is still functioning as a nation so we still have our prime minister we've got our parliament we've got the rule of law you know we've still got commerce going and all these things but it's in a very much smaller state then how it was before lockdown where you know trade was going on there was construction there was growth there was you know you know there was expansion there was all these things and it's the same thing so so what happened is you know beforehand previously so you know so so this this country's only just functioning and I'm sure we would all love to return to how it was who wants to come out of lockdown you know sure we would love to look how we used to you know go to the mall at your most loved going to the mall have school open again see our friends you know go to work like what you smell to your travel have church but that's just a natural look down yeah but it's a lot worse you know I'm afraid many believers are actually already in a spiritual lockdown and they went as a virtual lockdown before the physical lockdown ever started look Gina and and this may have been you know and some may may have been in lockdown for years where they used to be full of the joy of the Lord they used to travel around God's Word just have a Jubilee and it doesn't matter with Genesis of Revelation or or from faith as a substance all the way to communion you know I just have a Jubilee and rejoice and just have a good old time just like we should travel around this country almost like it used to be out you know just have our time I would say I feel like driving to Tarragona I'd get on my I get in my I'd say come kids come honey we're going and we'd go but now I can't do that and so I used to be when people are full of the Lord rejoice I say I'm just going to go up to heavenly places hallelujah I'm just gonna enjoy the word I listen to the seals you know I'm gonna read the scripture you know and and I just you just travel around God's Word have a Jubilee you know just enjoy the goodness of God and up in the high places look at the mountaintops living under the beach maybe go to this and you know you just like it's just like enjoying the nation you go on your your your your favorite places you go to it the same thing in the word you go to your favorite places just enjoy it again and again you know that's how that someone that's not in lockdown yeah but some but but unfortunately because you know because of hurt and pain because something has upset them people go into spiritual lockdown and instead of walking with God how they used to they just become withdrawn and then it only and then they only know it's on the essential Christian services that are operating in their life at the individual I'm young yes here we are Amen because thou has left our first love we want to get back they want to keep I mean people say you can't have a honeymoon your entire life brother Graham said you can be drunk on the Spirit of God every day of every day of your life to you lady moon the Prophet said I believe if I said look at me oh man hey man glory to God I mean we can never be too full of as good than same I mean so so because of pain and hurt people become spiritually withdrawn and now it's just the essential Christian services so they still go to church they will still come to camp maybe go to a convention even help on the sound now I tried to list everything in the church so you know so I'm not I'm not targeting anyone I'm just trying to have everything you know okay and this is not an order any any specific order by the way I'm on here to sit on you own okay so they may even help on the sound or in Sunday school or be in the band they may song lead or preach be it they can be part of the choir I mean they may be any part you know they may still be functioning in those roles but as brother Donnie Reagan said I mean there's a difference between working for God and walking with God all those things I listed that's just working for God but they start a walk I mean and we want to have that walk that walkers the most important thing you know you know Enoch walked with God and he was not not took I'm sorry so that's how we want to be we want to have a walk with God but the problem has been when someone goes into spiritual lockdown the essential Christian services are still operating they go to church they paint it I'd say they they do everything I just list it you know but then their walk with God become shut down and so there's a big difference between walking with God and work working for God during a lockdown get mothballed who knows what mothballing is I meant mothballing for those who maybe don't know the termas is like big machinery when it's not being used you know for a for a period of time it'll be kind of semi you know you know you know turned off it'll be shut down and and it'll be it'll be packed away in a certain way that data can be started up again later that's called mothballing and so what happens is a lot of unfortunately you know the joy the first loves that we had because of pain people mothball it or the shot that someone used to have it gets mothballed i'm or praising god or dancing in the spur or just being so full of his goodness it gets mothballed because this now essential Christian services are on the operating I mean you can look the part but but there's a very big difference between looking the part and being the part amen Oh God hey this cats both way so you know Oh amen you know I've been I've been down a road of just just being essential Christian services I've been there but I know what it's like to get out holy with you remember you are the one who's the government right of your own life I'm in your free will I mean that's the one who sees now we go down to level one well there's not even a problem the kids about the four four stage system a lockdown let's go back to where we were I mean so no I just want to show you a picture see see things get muffled and let's just see if I can do this real quick I want to show you uh I'm just gonna show you a picture here now who can see that yeah can everyone see that so so that's an edit I mean I mean an edit yeah sorry that's an etic now what happens is an edit is stuff that you used to use get stored away and so so things that maybe you know you know things like so for example there's a painting near this is some furniture you know there's different things maybe were they were they were part of the household though used every day they are essential part of the household you know maybe that painting there I don't know if you can quite see every role but it's got a lot of light shining on it maybe that had a you know a preeminent place you're over the mantelpiece but then something happened in the house where it was taken down and it was put into storage same thing with those chairs and you know those different things you can see in that picture what happened is there was a change in the household and things that were once very Valley but were actually hidden away and it's the same thing in the Christian life is that joy that yo-yo that abandonment to gardeners were that love for him you know they're rejoicing that shout amen crying you're crying in his presence and loving him of yo you know you know just opening the word a ten Dorp again some ministry and you hear the message and God begins to speak to you and God comes down into your house you begin to rejoice and yeah and what you look like it don't matter what you look like how they lose every glorious time and God's pouring it as revelation but then what happens is pain comes someone in the church someone close to you maybe someone on your family being sued maybe say snide comments and maybe you know try and make some little digs at you and say things about you and your you know other people that causes pain it causes warning and then what happens those things which he wants and loved to display just like that painting I mean the joy and the praise of God and loving him it gets put up in the Edit Amen now I just want to say this but then who's ever been in someone's attic edit and edit yeah please give a big and then and then and then you take out some treasures like you may be just a little kid maybe you go up into your grandparents place and you find this little thing and then you take it down them say it's a grandad grandma what's this you know I used to call my grandparents mum and dad mom and dad what's this and and - you don't know what it is but in but in you know they pick it up and then you can see almost the emotion just come over their faces because when that when an object is placed back in their hands all the memories associated with that object flood back and it's like they're back in that place once again hallelujah and I'm going to say the same thing I mean when it comes to coming out of coming out of spiritual lockdown we're going to go back into the edit and bow out our storage cupboards I mean about testimony I mean we're going to go back into our storage cupboard and pull out some testimonies and pull out that favorite of ours and then pull out whatever picture pull that when he saved you pull out when He healed you and pull out when he redeemed you and pull out when he ministered you know you know the word feel hard to pull out when a revelation became alive and going back emotions are pulled about it that's the mall and you know put the back on the mantelpiece and the next thing you know you because when those things when you when you hold them back up Holly oh when you hold it back up you begin to look at it the memory of what happened back there but it's a flood of three or sperner you begin to remember I mean the glorious things that happened in those and that's how you get out of a spiritual lockdown is when you begin to remember what God did for you when he ever going to take those treasures Holly you begin to hold them up to the light I've been keeping in to hold up the changes to the light and the light shines down you begin to see the details yeah wonderful they are hallelujah the next thing you know you're back in that moment might say you can't live on a memory no that's true but in a memory you're a memory can bring bring that you're a memory can bring that from being a memory into the present and then how amen Maureen we um I just want to go to this this this may seem you know a bit a bit a bit left-field but who knows what this picture is we've seen this picture this is this is the US Marines and they and he ran erasing the flag on Iwo Jima and and and this is one of the iconic photos of world war two and so here they are raising a standard and this is on a battlefield so so this is not something that was you know you know they actually raised this flag before this and this is the second flag raising this was actually video but the thing is they were still enemy on the Island you know the Japanese were still there they're still gunshots they were still you know you know you're you know there was cannon fire there was artillery fire they're your people were getting shot at you know but what they they determined and even with the enemy there they said we are gonna raise a standard I mean we're gonna raise a banner and the thing is you know we can we we have to come to a place in our walk where it doesn't matter what's going on around us we can still raise the bed a man he is a banner hallelujah the Lord has helped enemy to be standing on the parade ground and your raise a flag on the playground you know you can be in your home or even in a convention so all the Lord's wonderful begin to rejoice I mean but when you get back to your address you get back to your home oh yeah and you're in the house of your friends and and those ones that hurt you I mean those ones that have been firing arrows at you and we know it's just jealousy or can be many different things but you've got to be able to raise a standard even in their presence because we have to recognize I mean when Israel and Gideon's day when when when they make the caves and the foxholes and and they went and hid away did that deliver them it didn't help them win but I mean they had to come out and fight holier they had to they had to come out in a fight that's the only way that they could be delivered and so here we are now you know these men rose are standing in the prints of their enemy and we have to be able to raise a standard of the Lord Jesus Christ I mean in the presence of of every demon power in face of all criticism right in face of also snide remarks and people trying to tear us down hallelujah there's nothing nothing is going to help us if we hide away yeah I just want to show you let me show you a picture of where they raise this flag now here's an aerial photograph of this island now you see this mountain here yeah that's where they put the flag up it's all exposed you know it's not heading away down on the beach somewhere you know up on this mountain and they put the standing up there because they wanted the enemy to see no we're on this place we are taking this place I mean we're going to look right the Pacific Holly and we're going to push back the oppressor no I know it's just a natural battle by be using it as an example I mean but but they decided we're gonna put the standard up we're gonna put the standard up I mean almost mounted into the six in this exposed place Wow hallelujah oh we can't go a threshing weight like Gideon and secret by the wine priests I mean he just he just had essential services riding on he had Israel's essential services just trying to get a bit of food just trying to survive living well blows privileged I mean but the thing is he had some things in the storage cupboard that when that when the angel of the Lord came to Herman he just asked a question of God is with us where the miracle said yeah you know we're the miracles and like Moses or Josh or okay little mamas where's that God yeah oh yeah you know but we have to as if I'm following me okay yes I mean we don't you know the thing is what really you just take you just take heavy rock for example right her sons were were making fun there was snickering program said they weren't sitting there listening hall wasn't this wonderful but she raises standard I mean she raised the standard of faith holy when brother members tell the testimony the screws being crated I mean she didn't she didn't hide away in a bucket trying you know all these my sons whatever no no she looked into what the prophet of God was saying she looked into what God was doing and she there's nothing but the truth brother Brown and God can be honest its masculine amethysts way I mean egg her and her children amen I mean became believers her songs Aliyah so we should be able to I mean raise the standard we should had to worship we should be able to just be how we're meat to be no matter the circumstance now I'm not talking about putting on something I'm talking about how you really are with God and how you meet them me with God how you were in your first love we should be greater than that because it should just do oh I mean you take you take David David David was bringing the ark to to Jerusalem and because the word the prince of God was coming into a city he got a little bit excited holy and and and he begin to dance and he begin to worship any any and and because he was a man after God's own heart he just fought the law yeah hallelujah he just he just worshipped God he wasn't too worried about what other people are doing but then his wife would look at a window looked down on him and she would actually despise what she would actually despise his worship now some of us you know you know we get a baby a hurtful remark maybe from our spouse maybe from our children maybe from someone in church maybe just a your offend comment it's like a javelin mistake you know it's thrusts us through I mean but your David David did not leave her attitude her atmosphere I mean her comments diminish and his walk with God he did beseech your services I mean because of what she did she just hear you say well if you don't like this I'm just gonna do it again tomorrow I'm just gonna continue on man yeah I mean I mean we should just continue almost god I'm a boy and solace her to jail yeah I love it when Paul could good could begin to list down you know everything that could not see prayers from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus our Lord because all those things that he listed came against them right hallelujah he wasn't just riding something that was hypothetical he lived well I mean he really wait for me he came to a place he recognized doesn't matter what the devil does doesn't matter how it comes what what former maybe nothing can separate me from my first love because remember amen what what is manifested in the messenger of the age there's actually like the entire age just in one man I mean but I don't believe that the Apostle Paul cuz because when the Ephesian age started the Apostle Paul had already died did the Lord but I believe he was a man who was walking in his first love and it doesn't matter what came against him I mean he could he could endure and he could withstand and he could stay and that first time with our Lord Jesus I just read the you know you know you have a life the Apostle Paul and I just marvel I mean hallelujah but but Paul and Silas would find themselves in to jail and they were just in the jail there in the end of jail and and they just wouldn't you're escorted and they can you please stand the cell sir and you know no they were beaten they were dragged by a mob without beating and and they were just in a Cell theron and the inner cell and stop verified a place my mind they had you know they attempted this place had preached and this was the end of their preaching you know you know it's amazing you look at the life of Paul he goes to a city you know you know we're reading through the book of Acts at night and you know it's so amazing he goes to a place god moves an incredible way in the enemy that's following him from the other city comes along stirs the people up against them he gets beaten me get stoned or whatever happens is a picture more goes on and and the Apostle Paul just continues on you know many of us probably would have quit you know he doesn't get discouraged he just continued on I mean so porn solace for in a jail I'm not really a jail as I see it but they they they decided I don't know how they decided it but but something moved in their hearts they said we're not gonna let this keep us down and they begin to sing and they begin to praise the Lord hallelujah and then God came down into the prison maybe because of their worship to God remember we shouldn't worship God based on how well things are going for us I mean with God should give a big well praise the Lord I have this oh praise the Lord he's giving me the surprised one even I said my prayer you know it's you knew I want you giving me based on that but now with God's me based on who he's done we must continue doesn't matter anyway oh my god I mean seven billion people on the earth and you find me in that's how we should be he will make fun let them make fun remarks from family whoever it might be the kiss oh I don't I don't go to chase be seen by everyone else and then I come to church to wave my flag of worship say glory straight when King George regard for Canada and all the little kids that he won was given a little flag an hour along the streets they're waving their flags who's ever seen that kind of thing we've seen it it was really a flag oh yeah your king goes past everything's down anyone goes back to school where they were and in one class you know you're they do the role and you go through the roll and then and in this one little girl whose name there's no present you know sorry so they begin to get worried that begin to search and then and then they're switching down the street and they find her attacked behind maybe a lamppost and she's crying the teachers his honey what's wrong are you okay you heard I'm okay I'm okay what's wrong did you wave you flat your wave my flag did you did you see the King go past I saw the King go punks what's wrong honey why you shop sit well you know the thing is did the King see me I waved my flare guys here did the King see me it's what usual kind of about I'll say the Lord Jesus always sees us I was actually listening to a bit about brother bus coast history that was just put out redone and and he was relating how people he knew from his church we're on the platform with brother Pereira and Angel Lord came down and you know the problem we could begin to discern what you know your the thoughts of of the people's hearts and he begin to see a vision of the woman that was standing in front of him and and he would say you know you were looking out this window and you're praying and you're he he described the scene so vividly and and and only she saw only she was here to look that out and I was so struck by that I said Lord you see everything we do hear our prayer you see our heart verbalize anything you see the burdens we carry and when you see how well I'll need to now care for one another you see the burdens for our families yet burdens for the churches he burdens for dying humanity you see how we feel yourself or processes you see everything we do I thought Lord Jesus I'm so thankful you see me wave my little flag you know brother Brian would tell a story he tell a story of an old man and this old man would would go visit his daughter you know you know his daughter moved to a city you know into the city and she begin to you know be with the up and ups in the church this fancy cottage Church and you know he he went and visited his daughter and you know he would just you know he would read his Bible and he begin to just shout and scream and just have a Jubilee in his herb you know you know he would just you know be thus lagging in you know his um you know his his daughter seemed to us dead you know dad I'm gonna have my friends over from church you know we're gonna have a little tea party and thinks what do you go up in the attic and you know you just you just you just spend the evening up there you know you know you want to be around us you'll be bored or blah blah you know I'm sorry so she made sure his Bible wasn't there she went out there because he was the kind of believer because Beamer he was in his first love and he put on anything to impress anyone I mean who just read the scripture and and because it blaze the soul so much he just begin to shout and cry and you know carry on like someone who's real happy healthy you know someone who's really in love and then so she was you know she shut him up in the attic there maybe give him something to drink and eat so he wouldn't have to come down and disturb with that door and you by having their old fancy nice tea party and you know maybe the daughter had her first love once upon a time but now she is all caring about what her friends thought about her but she's trying to impress everyone and but by but by doing that she just actually went down to their level I mean she just went down to their level and then the next thing you know the rosters begin to shake him his jumping going on shouting and you're the chandeliers that's proving it yeah maybe she looks up the whole damn me what's going on you know and then she SS that explaining oh that's just my dad in your eye you know feeling embarrassed he was feeling embarrassed because of what he was doing and he was just worshipping as God we should never feel embarrassed and hold on someone I mean we should never feel embarrassed when God begins to move in the church amen God said look Lori bliss the ball Lord bless the Morrigan the worst thing but you know one thing I really hate as when when someone is squished when a gift is suppressed I meant by but but by someone who's jealous or something I hate to see that I hate to see someone's worship be torn to pieces I mean we're not putting something on they just wanted to look true to God that's just how they respond yeah I mean I'm not saying we all need to be noisy but he's gonna be true to how you out in the world and and and weird hair parties or something you know you just pass the ball around a few times the real quiet one is not quiet no more you know after a few hey they just you know to worry about who they're no more they've been getting shot and dance and mate you know yeah but you're never gonna cut up like everyone else why because he drinking the same spirit drinking from the same bottle and you know I believe we just drink from the same bottle let go and let God have his way God will always be in water it's an order that's right she was embarrassed if it be embarrassed when God moves on that person so you know so so so the party's all done and you know you know they didn't did her dad comes out and you know she's like dad what happened well you know was all that noise all that commotion all that screaming good you know the plaster was falling off the ceiling you know you embarrassed me dad Oh Jim Pat and said well well well honey you know you know he didn't care because you know he just loved the Lord right he's in his first love I meant he's just sent his first lot and you know he said well I don't have my Bible on me but I begin to be looking through some treasures oh yeah I begin to be looking through a few treasures in your attic and I found a geography book and I talk about the ocean and you know what this dumb every book they say they can't can't find the bottom of the ocean and I begin to sink when I was thinking about it I began to think that God put my sins in the sea and it got me really kind of excited you know so I'm just gonna I'm just gonna leave it just what made up well I just make a few more comments but I say this is the age of being in our first love amen capstone is divine love himself coming down right and if remember there are actually in the in the book of Proverbs I believe it is there's the statue of the imperfect man who's ever seen that right there's a statue of the imperfect man just like in Peter there's a statue of the perfect man oh boy amen and so if someone is built up in the statue of the imperfect man oh now if I can't find it forgive me and then if I can't find it we weren't worried about it just now but there's some homework now again James and Peter so second Peter so the statue of the imperfect man we got a proverb 6 okay we're just gonna have a real quick Bible study but we're not I just want you to think about this proverbs 6 and 16 probably 6 and 16 so I mean when you did proverbs 6 and 16 these 6 things that the Lord hate a seminar in their BOTS are an abomination unto Him a proud look a long time and hands that she'd innocent blood a heart that deceiveth wicked and imaginations feet that be swift and running to mischief a false witness that speaketh lies and he that soweth discord among brethren yeah but and I won't do it now but you take the statue of the perfect man and you see the statue of the imperfect manners as the opposite but now there's actually a the capstone is not there to capstone as in 26 proverbs 26 and in verses 24 to 28 I'll have this know correct he says me about he that hateth dissembler 'the with his lips was that song discord among brethren and laughed up the seat within him when he speaketh fear believe him not for there are seven abominations in his heart whose hatred is covered by deceit his wickedness shall be showed before the whole congregation so there is the statue of the perfect man we just read the statue of the imperfect man now if someone has built up in the statue of the imperfect man you'll see that manifested in his life right just like if you see the statue of the perfect man you'll see that those attributes manifested in the believer oh why you saying this I say this if you have divine love in your life it will manifest itself the battle is to stay in that divine love demon I'm calling the divine love the first love remember they fell from a position you know they cease repeat for us you can will be taken from you remember he sees in verse 5 of and and I was gonna wrap this up revelations 2 and verse 5 remember from whence thou art fallen see you've got to remember you know if you you know if you're in spiritual lockdown and you just become a Christian essential services you have to remember from what you remember remember where you have fallen from that's why I say human go back into storage go back up yeah pull your testimony out hallelujah looking over relive it amen in the irritate opponent and you'll begin to see you'll begin to remember what it was like when you first met him that was when that first love when you came into that first love that's why it means that what says remember from weeks thou art fallen hallelujah you say well I've taken too many blows God can heal them just look with a memory and maybe maybe brother I story - just just just just after this I think what we'll do actually is we ACU's gonna in the stream and we're just gonna pray okay but don't just don't just live with a memory oh I used to be so happy you know God wants us to be happy I used to rejoice I used to just just just just bathe in his presence just love his word so much it's just so alive and so real but you know but now it's work you know you know I've been along the road a bit of a way God's eternal he doesn't get stabbed with time this gets richer and greater and you're it all the time no don't just live with a memory of when you first meet him I mean you can go back you can go back to that first love hallelujah but go back don't your edit go back into your storage place bring out your testimony hallelujah I threw up is done to you well there's so much of the world still in me but go back to what he's done to you I mean if he called you they meant that's supernatural now you may not have a lot you might not have a lot of treasures stored away but go get them out even if you just got one that's still a treasure you just got one thing he's done for you pull it out just your look over again hallelujah because I believe we you know this is an age of restoration this is not a just angel just medium for tea and maintenance going through the motion this is a time where we should be in our first love and it's greater and more and there's nothing we work up it's just like Lord come and take my life I don't want to be holed up in a cave no more I'm in the hood of Israel when I come out into my inheritance again I want to walk your goodness Lord I want to walk up and down your word go through your message and I put the heavenly places and along the horizontal rainbow and have a jubilee and shout and give you glory and and go through everything you did free Lord I want to travel the places I used to travel over I want to go have the experiences I used to have our Lord I want your word to be alive to me once again I don't want to be stale I don't want to just be me learning things and storing up courses ammunition or defense or a wall but I want you to become a minister you watch me I want you like a first makes you my lord father may you grant a deed god I just pray father now Lord Jesus before we go off the streaming my god father I pray you just take these very chopped up words and Lord may we go into our memory Lord of our storage come on O God may be Lord once upon a time we used to cry and when we thought about you as a lowly was a lowly once maybe was very happy and rejoicing in your word we just opened your word or salt life and Lord and fresh and wonderful but Lord in the enemy came as something hurt us Lord and now we've put up all we've sealed where we're withdrawing ourselves and we've hidden ourselves away like the children as rather than Gideon's thing but I pray father Lord the Lord would come out of our foxholes look we've come out of her beings my god I pray Lord that we would walk Lord Jesus you say Lord restore us back to our first love like father Doyle working every hat my Lord Jesus father load I pray you're just flat-out memories just now father rule that all the things you've done for us my god or father man just floored Baxter such

so father I pray for each one oh god father I pray or you bless them abundantly Lord Jesus in the name of Jesus Christ father a man hallelujah Amen god bless your friends I'm gonna love the service
