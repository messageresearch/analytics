[20:12] master
[20:13] amen amen
[20:16] the reason i'm saying let's clap hands

[20:20] i just i appreciate him
[20:22] [Music]
[20:23] because
[20:24] [Music]
[20:27] just a little bit the reason i use this
[20:29] little stand
[20:31] if i may rather than you know i thought
[20:35] as you said it's a old-fashioned prayer
[20:38] meeting tonight
[20:39] and so you're just gonna take it easy
[20:41] relax and each one
[20:43] comfortable and just allow the word to
[20:46] come through you easily
[20:48] amen so that's why i chose this one so
[20:51] that
[20:52] you know we can all be on the same level
[20:56] i would like to greet you tonight in the
[20:58] name of our lord and savior jesus christ
[21:01] how many are happy how many have eternal
[21:05] life
[21:06] amen so if you come to think of it the
[21:09] song that we are singing
[21:11] the lord jesus fed the hungry five
[21:13] thousand people
[21:15] he fed them i'm talking about the
[21:17] physical food now he fed them
[21:20] from two loaves and how many
[21:24] five fish he fed them five thousand
[21:27] people so how many are we here tonight
[21:29] one two three four five four
[21:31] we are like very few that food
[21:34] was going to feed us for i don't know
[21:36] how many years
[21:38] if it was given to shakina tabernacle
[21:40] but you know what
[21:41] the prophet says today we have been
[21:43] given a mountain of bread
[21:45] more than that one that was fed to the
[21:47] multitudes
[21:48] a mountain i don't know i don't know if
[21:51] you've got mountains here
[21:52] i believe in south island there's big
[21:54] mountains but where i come from these
[21:56] big mountains
[21:58] one of them is called kilimanjaro it's
[22:01] one of the highest in the world
[22:04] a mountain imagine a bread the size of
[22:06] mount everest
[22:10] man how long will you eat okay let's
[22:12] read the scripture
[22:14] and then we can sit down and relax i
[22:16] didn't prepare any
[22:18] powerpoint we're just going to read what
[22:21] the prophet says
[22:23] read what the bible says just three
[22:26] pages
[22:28] and it's actually two or one page if you
[22:31] just make them
[22:32] 11 font single sided
[22:37] it's actually one page because i have
[22:39] made them 14
[22:40] and spaced up nicely so so so
[22:44] so it's actually small what what what i
[22:47] have here it's not too much
[22:49] and we thank the lord for this wonderful
[22:52] opportunity to be in the house of the
[22:54] lord
[22:55] this evening it's a serious hour that
[22:57] we're living in amen
[22:59] let's just read matthew chapter five
[23:03] we are living in a serious hour
[23:07] and a serious hour requires
[23:10] us to be serious amen
[23:13] matthew chapter five let's read mutual
[23:17] chapter five jonah
[23:18] wanna read with me my friend and then
[23:23] we'll read from we'll read from
[23:27] this three but our key concentration
[23:30] will just focus
[23:31] on verse six amen
[23:36] let's read it together when you read
[23:38] verse 6 i would like us to read
[23:39] all of us if we can but the bible says
[23:44] blessed are the poor in spirit for
[23:46] theirs is the kingdom of heaven
[23:49] blessed are they that mourn for they
[23:52] shall be comforted
[23:54] blessed are they meek for they shall
[23:56] inherit the earth
[23:58] verse 6 blessed are they
[24:01] which do hunger and thirst after
[24:04] righteousness
[24:05] for they shall be filled blessed are
[24:09] the merciful for they shall obtain mercy

[24:27] persecuted
[24:28] for righteousness sake for theirs is the
[24:31] kingdom of god for them is the for
[24:33] theirs is the kingdom of heaven
[24:35] if you notice verse 6 i've got the word
[24:39] righteousness and also verse 10. it's
[24:41] got the word
[24:42] righteousness amen let us pray the faith
[24:46] let's pray our heavenly father
[24:49] great eternal mighty unlimited
[24:54] god we stand before you this evening
[24:58] not because we deserve it father we
[25:00] stand before you not because we are
[25:02] worthy we stand before you this evening
[25:05] not because we qualify
[25:07] but lord is because you chose to give us
[25:11] your love is because father you elected
[25:15] us and specifically loved us father god
[25:18] and chose us with your elective love
[25:21] that is why we are here this evening
[25:23] that is why we stand in your presence
[25:25] it's not because we drove here with our
[25:27] cars
[25:28] it's not because of our ability and
[25:30] capacity father
[25:32] it is because you preordained that we
[25:35] are here this evening
[25:37] to come and stand and honor thy name
[25:40] and honor father god what we have done
[25:43] because the songwriter said
[25:44] i will never be able to repay what you
[25:48] have done
[25:49] lord jesus that is why we stand and read
[25:51] your word father
[25:52] and after reading it father we need to
[25:54] pray and dedicate it to you so that you
[25:56] can anoint it to our hearts
[25:58] so that you can stimulate both our
[26:00] hearts
[26:01] our ears and everything in us to respond
[26:05] to your weight this evening
[26:07] we pray father that you can bless both
[26:09] the speaker and the hearer
[26:11] i pray lord god that your spirit will
[26:13] take control and preeminence in the
[26:15] service of the living god
[26:16] we know each other there's not much of a
[26:18] visitor here tonight
[26:20] so lord make us relax father god not
[26:23] wander around
[26:24] in our minds and hearts father so that
[26:26] we must not miss not even an
[26:28] iota of your word is our prayer this
[26:30] evening we commit the service we commit
[26:32] this little prayer meeting this evening
[26:34] lord into thy precious and mighty and
[26:36] most capable hands
[26:38] of our loving lord jesus christ we pray
[26:40] with thanksgiving
[26:41] amen god bless you you may enjoy the
[26:44] comfort of your seeds
[26:46] while i remain standing amen how many of
[26:50] you have had a wonderful day today
[26:52] amen for that believer is always a
[26:54] wonderful day
[26:55] like what brother brother phil said when
[26:58] in
[26:59] when he was praying i don't know how
[27:00] many of you heard him he said we thank
[27:02] you for the trials
[27:04] you know the bible says we must count it
[27:05] as a blessing when the trials and
[27:07] temptations
[27:08] and all sorts of things come our way
[27:10] amen we must count it as a
[27:12] blessing in other words if something
[27:16] tough what you regard as tough time
[27:19] comes your way
[27:20] say thank you lord because it is those
[27:22] kind of things that are going to
[27:23] bring you closer to god tonight
[27:26] i would like us to talk about a simple
[27:28] weight
[27:29] called hunger amen
[27:33] how many knows hunger i believe each one
[27:36] of us tonight before we came here we ate
[27:38] something isn't it
[27:40] and i believe since yesterday we have
[27:42] eaten a couple of times
[27:45] isn't or it i i'm not talking to people
[27:49] who don't eat
[27:50] um who loves hunger
[27:56] who loves hunger i love hunger because
[27:58] it is hunger that makes me to eat
[28:01] and it is hunger that makes me to think
[28:03] about what i'm going to eat
[28:05] because i'm not just going to to drink
[28:07] milk when i'm so hungry
[28:09] no i'm going to eat something that fills
[28:11] my stomach and i'm going to make sure
[28:13] that that something is going to benefit
[28:14] my
[28:15] body so hunger is a very is a natural
[28:19] thing
[28:20] god has made it even god himself said to
[28:23] the children
[28:24] to his children at the garden of eden
[28:26] fasting they must not eat
[28:29] that see from that tree which means they
[28:32] were going to have to satisfy some form
[28:34] of
[28:34] a not the begs leading to anger
[28:38] that we have today no some form of
[28:41] hunger was going to be the hunger of
[28:43] fellowship with god a hunger
[28:45] of being with god a hunger so somehow
[28:48] they were forbidden
[28:49] not to eat you cannot eat if you're not
[28:52] hungry if you eat and you're not hungry
[28:54] there's a problem
[28:56] there's a problem nowadays when we just
[28:58] eat but we are not actually hungry
[29:01] why do we eat when we are not hungry we
[29:04] must
[29:05] our eating must be as a response to
[29:08] hunger natural isn't it brother film
[29:12] our eating must be as a response people
[29:14] of course okay nowadays because of
[29:16] satan's eating we've got things you know
[29:18] that we're just nibbling
[29:21] you know we're just nibbling because we
[29:23] are in laodicea we say
[29:25] we think we've we've got enough where we
[29:27] can eat
[29:29] like that guy in the bible when david
[29:31] sent a man to get water
[29:33] to get some food he was just what do you
[29:35] call the word
[29:36] clattening he was just eating was just
[29:39] clutter us
[29:40] if there's such a weight so we mustn't
[29:42] eat when we are not
[29:43] hungry or our eating must be as a
[29:45] response to satisfy
[29:47] something in our body and that's
[29:49] something if you zoom into it you'll
[29:51] find that
[29:51] it is bound or it is it has got hunger
[29:54] inside it right
[29:55] so it is a hunger is a state of
[29:59] um it's a state it's a state of feeling
[30:03] you know a need to eat to satisfy your
[30:07] body
[30:08] because there's something that is short
[30:10] and you eat
[30:11] for that purpose to gain strength for
[30:14] our little girls and boys to grow
[30:16] to develop isn't it and so hunger
[30:19] therefore
[30:20] if you look at it it's a good thing if
[30:23] you come to look at it it's a good thing
[30:24] because
[30:25] it helps us because if we don't eat we
[30:28] die
[30:29] so what if we don't get hungry then
[30:32] we'll die even before we start
[30:34] because it is a law of god that you for
[30:36] you
[30:37] to to exist physically you must eat
[30:41] if you don't eat what will happen to you
[30:44] you die
[30:45] so what if you don't get hungry then
[30:48] that is a problem and that's why i want
[30:50] us to i want us
[30:51] to think about that that thought around
[30:54] this idea of
[30:55] your hunger and what actually fills your
[30:59] hunger
[31:00] i want us to be simple get into the
[31:03] thought
[31:04] preach together as i'm busy talking you
[31:06] say yeah the brother is right here here
[31:08] here here
[31:09] you know participate with me i'm gonna
[31:11] just make it very simple if you hear
[31:13] that
[31:14] i'm hard on you just you know then
[31:18] i'll reduce the speed but but what i'm
[31:21] trying to say brothers and sisters is
[31:22] that
[31:23] uh there is a reason why god gave
[31:26] hunger and hunger my hunger your hunger
[31:31] has to be
[31:32] filled what we have read in the book of
[31:35] matthew
[31:36] the bible says blessed are they which do
[31:38] hunger and thirst after righteousness
[31:40] for they shall be filled
[31:44] uh i'm not talking about the appetite
[31:46] still literally
[31:48] we're having a chat at home and uh
[31:51] so that there is appetite
[31:55] and there is hunger appetite in my view
[31:58] is is more a hormonal issue brother and
[32:01] it's more a
[32:02] uh something that you can still be
[32:05] hungry but not have happy times
[32:07] am i wrong or right you can be you can
[32:10] have
[32:10] appetite but you're not hungry
[32:14] but you just want to eat eh
[32:17] especially these people who don't do
[32:19] diet sisters do diet
[32:21] so sisters know how to control this
[32:23] appetite
[32:25] but the issue that i'm trying to say is
[32:26] that i'm not trying to talk about
[32:28] epithet i'm talking about hunger in a
[32:30] specific way you'll understand me as we
[32:32] go along
[32:33] because the prophet says
[32:36] everybody has got hunger
[32:39] the problem is this and this is where we
[32:42] have read
[32:43] i'm talking about hungering for
[32:46] righteousness you see that's what i'm
[32:50] talking about
[32:50] i admit and i agree that
[32:54] everyone because we human being we are
[32:57] created
[32:58] in the image of god part of us have got
[33:00] a sample
[33:01] brother ben will tell us what the sample
[33:03] is he works in the lab
[33:05] a sample which is our soul of god are we
[33:08] together this thing i hear some echo
[33:10] my brother ate so now
[33:13] that soul of us craves
[33:17] for something all the time so it's a law
[33:19] that god has put
[33:21] but there must be something to respond
[33:23] to it
[33:24] now everybody has got that all
[33:27] human beings have got that spot in them
[33:31] or a soul because it is part of god to
[33:33] hunger for something
[33:34] but tonight i'm not talking about that
[33:36] because everybody can hunger and satisfy
[33:39] their hunger with many different sorts
[33:40] of things
[33:41] but the bible says a blessed ah
[33:44] let me read it blessed are they with
[33:46] hunger and thirst
[33:48] for after righteousness that means
[33:52] there are people who get hungry but they
[33:54] don't get hungry for righteousness
[33:59] that means there are people who get
[34:00] hungry but they are frustrated and not
[34:03] know how to satisfy their anger
[34:05] i mean their hunger not anger
[34:08] so it it it brings us to a point where
[34:12] we must sit
[34:13] and think i am so blessed because i've
[34:16] got a hunger for
[34:17] god and my challenge tonight
[34:20] especially to the young people this is a
[34:23] key learning point to take home
[34:27] what if i don't have the hunger
[34:32] that is a big problem because this is a
[34:35] reality
[34:36] where you find that a young child a
[34:38] young believer
[34:39] even elder older believers they are
[34:41] there
[34:42] there is no hunger why we need to ask
[34:46] ourselves why is there no hunger
[34:48] and the bible says ask anything
[34:51] isn't it i'm gonna read for you so
[34:56] we need to get worried if we don't get
[34:57] hungry for righteousness
[34:59] which mother in this room and father
[35:02] won't be worried if a child
[35:04] like faith doesn't get angry
[35:08] you'll find the mother even forcing says
[35:09] this child never ate for the last three
[35:11] days
[35:12] they will make sure that that child eat
[35:14] because
[35:15] he or she must get hungry otherwise
[35:18] it is going to jeopardize or impact
[35:21] negatively on the growth of the child
[35:23] so the mother knows in fact the mother
[35:25] will be having
[35:26] lots of milk painting hair to come out
[35:30] because naturally it's time for that
[35:32] milk to come out for william to drink it
[35:34] isn't it brother ben so it must happen
[35:37] that william
[35:38] must respond william must get hungry
[35:42] otherwise papa crist ben and mama
[35:45] christine will get worried
[35:46] and every one of us in here will get
[35:48] worried including yourself
[35:49] if you don't get hungry you're going to
[35:51] ask your partner hey bronwell
[35:53] i'm not getting angry what is happening
[35:56] with me i haven't i haven't eaten for
[35:58] the last
[35:58] and i did not decide to fast but i'm not
[36:01] getting hungry
[36:03] what is the problem just eat any just
[36:04] eat anyhow
[36:06] because your hunger would have been
[36:08] affected by something in your system
[36:11] maybe you're stressed maybe there's
[36:13] something
[36:14] preoccupying that hunger so
[36:17] there is people who are not like you who
[36:20] don't hunger for righteousness and those
[36:23] people
[36:24] me and you have to be worried for them
[36:27] because we can see that hey how are they
[36:30] how are they living
[36:32] without getting hungry for god
[36:35] now let's watch out that us ourselves we
[36:38] get hungry
[36:40] for god and now after being hungry
[36:43] whatever what i would like to stagger
[36:45] this thing like this is that
[36:47] if you find yourself as a young person
[36:48] as an older person sitting here not
[36:50] getting hungry
[36:51] one thing that you need to start doing
[36:54] is to start
[36:54] and be on your knees because you have
[36:57] identified a problem
[36:58] the pastor here on the pulpit i don't
[37:00] know how many did it
[37:02] the pastor said go and write
[37:05] go and write 10 or whatever number
[37:08] things and put them in your bible
[37:09] that you need that you identify there's
[37:12] more i can assure you
[37:13] i can guarantee you how many went and
[37:16] wrote
[37:17] to go and write the things that you need
[37:20] identify
[37:21] them because you see let me show you
[37:22] something the devil does not want you to
[37:25] to identify your problems and
[37:27] acknowledge them
[37:28] or your challenges let me not say your
[37:30] problems because they are not yours
[37:31] but the devil does not want you to
[37:33] identify the challenges that you come
[37:35] across
[37:36] that bothers you heavies
[37:40] things like that he does not want to
[37:41] they are not yours
[37:43] but he has attached them you know when
[37:45] we attach something
[37:48] when you send an email you attach you
[37:51] attach something
[37:52] or when when they send it then you are
[37:54] attached
[37:55] so the devil likes to attach things to
[37:58] us
[37:58] and then call them ours
[38:02] right now we need to identify those
[38:06] things and disown them
[38:08] those are the those are the things that
[38:10] are actually eating away our hunger
[38:13] for god those are the things that are
[38:15] eating away
[38:16] our hunger for prayer those are the
[38:19] things that are eating away
[38:20] the our hunger for righteousness for our
[38:23] god
[38:23] is righteous his everything in him
[38:26] that's everything
[38:27] if you are testing and hungering for god
[38:30] blessed are thee the bible says blessed
[38:33] are
[38:34] you are we blessed and that is a promise
[38:38] god never lie i can tell you a lot of
[38:41] things about this god before
[38:42] i i go i go further i love him so much
[38:44] because he has shown me
[38:46] that he is eternal he has shown me even
[38:50] physically
[38:52] that he is so eternal i i like to watch
[38:54] this
[38:55] dvd of louis louis glue i like to watch
[39:00] it because it it challenges me so much i
[39:02] love astronomy
[39:04] so now in there
[39:07] they looked at the human cell and they
[39:10] investigate and they check and they find
[39:12] and they found that one of the cells one
[39:14] of the cells is made like
[39:16] like this cross
[39:19] it's made like this a cell and
[39:23] although this is a topic of some other
[39:25] day but god is so big
[39:28] that if you look at this world this
[39:30] earth the cosmos the
[39:32] earth the planet where we are now for
[39:34] some of the planets
[39:36] for uh for us to for me to form it just
[39:39] to four minutes have got
[39:40] this planet you know we need 200
[39:45] million something to form
[39:48] that one planet and the bible says god
[39:52] god created all of them and he calls
[39:54] each one by name
[39:55] and they respond to him they have not
[39:58] even found
[39:58] how big is the universe they have not
[40:01] even found
[40:02] i say and this is my astronomy don't
[40:04] take this home
[40:05] i wish it could be not recorded i i
[40:08] think this atmosphere is eternal
[40:11] in this way the physical times the
[40:15] spiritual
[40:16] we know that heaven is a dimension right
[40:18] and we know our god is it it's eternal
[40:20] it's not ending you'll never find and
[40:22] say god is from here to here
[40:25] if they cannot find the universe okay
[40:27] let's say they find it then what is on
[40:29] the other side of the universe
[40:33] if the universe can be from here to here
[40:35] it brings me to a thought when the
[40:37] prophet says
[40:37] god the revelation of god is like those
[40:40] sparks
[40:41] you know and and and the more you go the
[40:43] more he opens you'll never finish him
[40:46] you'll never analyze him and say oh this
[40:48] is all the stars
[40:50] never that is why and he says you we
[40:53] must
[40:54] ask to be free and free because we'll
[40:56] never be sufficiently free
[40:57] we must get more and more and more and
[41:00] more of god
[41:01] until we are like enoch and he takes us
[41:04] home
[41:05] ma or god so they i don't think they'll
[41:07] ever get to a point where
[41:09] they say ah now we think we are just
[41:12] 110 000 light years away from where the
[41:15] universe ends
[41:17] never because the more they go the more
[41:20] the more they make a bigger planet
[41:22] the more they find out that ah the
[41:25] distance where
[41:26] where we want to go is actually where we
[41:28] come from it's
[41:29] just a fraction of where we want to go
[41:32] they will go i mean a light year
[41:35] everybody understand how big is the idea
[41:37] the distance which light travels a
[41:40] second
[41:41] the distance we slide travels a year
[41:43] sorry light travels at 160
[41:46] 186 kilometers
[41:49] a second 186 000
[41:53] kilometers from the sun to here to my
[41:55] skin
[41:56] it travels in speed of 186 000
[41:59] kilometers a second and it arrives here
[42:03] at that speed now that speed
[42:07] the whole year january to december
[42:12] counting it is called one light year
[42:15] so it will take them hundreds and
[42:17] hundreds and hundreds and millions of
[42:19] light years
[42:20] for them to exhaust eternity to exhaust
[42:23] the universe
[42:23] i'm not saying the universe is eternity
[42:25] but i'm saying physically speaking it
[42:27] looks to me that
[42:28] it's an ending
[42:31] if there are planets that are 200
[42:35] million
[42:36] times this earth our earth actually they
[42:39] say our earth and our sun
[42:41] is so insignificant in the bigger scheme
[42:45] of things
[42:46] so small is our earth so small
[42:51] our uni our our current is called
[42:54] the the milky way our solar system
[42:58] is so small so invisible
[43:02] but you know what in that beach in that
[43:05] big big big thing god
[43:09] saw you in there oh my now
[43:12] how small am i so this fascinates me
[43:15] every day it encourages me to realize
[43:17] that you know what
[43:18] i'm saving a big god my god is not
[43:21] my god i'm saving a big one when i say
[43:24] big
[43:25] it's an understatement it's a very very
[43:28] very understatement i don't have a word
[43:31] to explain him
[43:32] but that one is the one that i'm talking
[43:35] to you tonight
[43:36] that he said if you hunger for
[43:39] righteousness
[43:40] he will feel you how can you not believe
[43:42] that he can feel you
[43:43] when he made so much a big universe and
[43:46] you know what
[43:47] of the millions and millions and
[43:49] millions of sun grains
[43:51] on the seashore worldwide he knows each
[43:54] one of them
[43:58] he knows each one of those sent grains
[44:01] and he knows how many are they
[44:04] you cannot over express god we can never
[44:07] express him enough i mean to say
[44:09] he's so big this is the god that said if
[44:12] you hunger for me
[44:15] i will fill you with righteousness
[44:18] in other words i will fill you with
[44:20] myself
[44:22] because he is the righteousness amen now
[44:25] the problem of hunger is that you can
[44:28] only satisfy it
[44:30] by means of eating okay let me
[44:33] contextualize my my
[44:34] my point because we've got spiritual
[44:38] hunger right
[44:39] spiritual hunger we've got other hungers
[44:42] or hungers if you don't know where you
[44:45] you feel
[44:46] you feel you feel you know we are social
[44:48] social beings
[44:49] you need to associate you you know you
[44:51] just hear someone saying i miss you
[44:54] oh i haven't seen you as brother i miss
[44:56] you when you went to south island
[44:58] i mean that i'm hungering for you
[45:01] i need to fellowship with you to have
[45:03] more of you
[45:04] that's what fellowship is about isn't it
[45:06] i have not seen you hey brother i missed
[45:09] you man
[45:10] i mean i'm thirsty for you to fellowship
[45:13] with you
[45:14] because if we are hungering for god
[45:18] then god comes inward it is him who
[45:21] comes inside
[45:22] us and he fills us and we are in him and
[45:24] he is in
[45:25] us right right now we
[45:28] if you find that you miss god you are
[45:30] hungering for god
[45:32] you are hungry for righteousness and
[45:34] that's what we must cry and
[45:35] strive for every day if
[45:38] hunger is 100
[45:43] huh if you look at this boat
[45:47] if hamlet's hunt is this boat and then
[45:51] which represent hundred percent for
[45:53] isaac and then you find that ah
[46:00] only this corner
[46:04] if this is my hunger for the day only
[46:06] this corner
[46:08] is for god i'm hungry for god the rest
[46:10] of the other hunger
[46:11] is for other things
[46:17] if my hunger is not streamlined to god
[46:21] i've got a problem if this is my hand
[46:24] if our hunger daily brothers and sisters
[46:27] it's not hungering for god enough
[46:29] the prophet says it i'll read it for you
[46:31] we need to be able to say
[46:35] only this is for my business for my
[46:39] things for my problems and whatever
[46:41] and the rest of my hunger for daily
[46:44] hunger
[46:45] let me put it daily let's not say
[46:47] monthly no daily
[46:50] let's say daily hunger right our daily
[46:53] hunger system
[46:54] it must be that if this is my hunger
[46:57] daily
[47:00] this peace oh let me be fair
[47:03] the big part of it must be for god
[47:06] that's the point i'm trying to say
[47:08] right actually it must be 100
[47:12] gods all of that boat and then him
[47:16] he'll take care of everything that's
[47:18] what he said isn't it
[47:20] so but you find that we are busy our
[47:22] hunger is for other things
[47:24] man how do we see that our hunger is for
[47:27] other things
[47:28] because of what we eat you see
[47:31] because of what we satisfy our hunger
[47:33] every the body is the body is very
[47:35] simple
[47:35] god made the body very simple if i if
[47:38] he's warning
[47:39] i crave or i hunger for the food that
[47:42] will break the fast
[47:44] i'm not gonna have be on a five day fast
[47:46] then when i break the fast
[47:48] i just go on a big pop
[47:53] my body will be so because i must eat
[47:56] soft stuff
[47:57] to get the stomach back into the system
[47:59] you know you're fasting
[48:01] right that's why they call it break fast
[48:04] you don't just start with a heavy heavy
[48:06] big meal
[48:07] your stomach will even be so you need to
[48:09] start with a simple thing
[48:10] that will ease your body right so now
[48:14] now now now i i lost my point
[48:17] the point i'm trying to say was when our
[48:20] hunger must be satisfied with the right
[48:22] things
[48:23] the more we don't eat things of god
[48:27] the more we don't think the things of
[48:29] god the more we don't anticipate
[48:32] the more we don't david says in the word
[48:34] of god in one of the psalms
[48:36] when i meditate about you day and night
[48:38] god you come he comes closer to you
[48:41] when you think good about other phil you
[48:43] think good about sister k
[48:45] you look none of us in here is without
[48:48] errors and mistakes
[48:50] the issue is when i look at andy what do
[48:53] i see when i look at him
[48:54] when i look at sister priscilla when i
[48:57] look at ben
[48:58] when i look at marion what what do i see
[49:01] when i look
[49:02] do i see a son of god or i see my own
[49:05] imagination
[49:07] i'm satisfying a wrong hunger be careful
[49:10] be careful because when you look at a
[49:13] believer when you talk to a believer
[49:15] you know i was blessed so much many
[49:16] years by a lady who was not even a
[49:18] believer
[49:20] she said to me she was my colleague she
[49:22] said to me paul
[49:23] you know when you work at work
[49:26] sister now you work as if you work for
[49:29] god
[49:32] you'll understand me a believer don't
[49:35] work shortcuts
[49:37] a believer don't work a believer works
[49:40] until they know that this one
[49:41] this one is a christian christians
[49:43] behave like this a believer because
[49:45] our jobs god gave us so we work
[49:50] so honest so faithful so extra mild
[49:54] the same way as if we are doing it for
[49:55] god because we are not actually getting
[49:58] reinvestment or performance or anything
[50:00] from those people we are working for
[50:02] our one comes from heaven our salary
[50:06] our reinvestment our performance bonus
[50:08] comes from
[50:10] not from our custom our employer listen
[50:13] even if donna could not employ you
[50:16] if god said they must employ you they've
[50:18] got no choice
[50:21] you see the thing is that we are we
[50:24] we need to realize that we are
[50:25] controlled from a different government
[50:27] we are managed from a different employer
[50:30] our payslips don't come here
[50:32] no no that is why even our time
[50:35] is for the lord we don't employ we don't
[50:38] we are above our balls that is why we
[50:42] can work better than our boss
[50:45] you see so everything about a child of
[50:47] god
[50:48] is above we are employed from heaven
[50:52] that is why sister doesn't bother us we
[50:54] give him what he wants
[50:55] [Music]
[50:57] we our father have got a cattle on a
[51:00] thousand hills
[51:01] gold and diamond is the things that we
[51:03] walk on
[51:05] we walk on them this pavement that you
[51:08] see here
[51:08] what they are fighting and killing one
[51:10] another right now
[51:12] ours us not proudly so
[51:15] we walk on it it's our pavement we fix
[51:17] the road with
[51:18] it gold and diamond
[51:22] and what other stones do you know
[51:24] beautiful stones
[51:25] emerald jasper
[51:29] sephora all those stones we decorate our
[51:33] work parts with them
[51:35] our driveways of your mansion
[51:39] when you get there brother brother
[51:42] brother isaac and sister shannon your
[51:44] mention when we get them you want to say
[51:46] lord
[51:47] andy i don't know what you want but i
[51:48] want a bit of stuff right here on on
[51:50] these walls
[51:51] sapphire here emerald this side but for
[51:54] my driveway
[51:55] i want pure diamond black one
[51:59] black diamond so the point i'm trying to
[52:02] show to you is that
[52:04] such kind of riches is unexplainable in
[52:07] the context of this world
[52:09] so that is why we must not underrate
[52:11] ourselves
[52:12] the world must not deceive us by by
[52:15] taking a lot of our time and hunger
[52:18] that is supposed to be satisfied by the
[52:19] things of god every day
[52:22] as if we are from here we shouldn't
[52:24] forget that amnesia must not affect us
[52:27] we must be aware every day of who we are
[52:29] every second
[52:30] when we think when we talk when we look
[52:32] when we walk
[52:35] we know we know even if they don't pay
[52:39] you
[52:40] right that is why if if if they pay you
[52:43] more
[52:44] you go back to them and say you paid me
[52:46] more because because
[52:49] me and you are not from this world when
[52:52] i returned a
[52:52] change one day to a man who gave me more
[52:55] change
[52:56] he was surprised but i couldn't explain
[52:59] to him
[53:00] except to say that i'm just a christian
[53:02] you see one day me and my friend went to
[53:04] the bank and we found that it had one
[53:05] million
[53:06] we were just students and we go inside
[53:08] the bank and tell them to correct it
[53:09] and we were hungry before we could even
[53:12] draw 20 in
[53:13] with one incident because we don't
[53:16] depend on this world
[53:18] that is why they don't understand us or
[53:20] the world cannot understand you
[53:22] therefore our hunger must not help
[53:26] this worldly guy to be satisfied this
[53:29] car must be stopped
[53:32] that's what the pastor said here if i
[53:34] had him correct he said no no this guy
[53:36] even if he's tired he must go and bind
[53:38] and pray
[53:39] one day he will thank me when he has
[53:42] finally changed
[53:43] he'll thank me and say thank you thank
[53:45] you for pushing me to worship god
[53:48] he'll thank me this guy i'm not this guy
[53:52] amen sorry i left my message let's read
[53:55] romans chapter
[53:56] 10. i'll read it quickly for you so that
[53:58] you mustn't amazing take longer
[54:00] if it's okay with you but if you can
[54:03] hope if you're a quick bible
[54:05] flippa of the pages you can get it
[54:09] quickly
[54:13] brother and my heart desire and pray my
[54:15] heart let me read
[54:16] let me not read from the paper sorry let
[54:19] me read from
[54:20] from the bible
[54:23] from verse 1. romans chapter 10
[54:27] romans 10 1 brethren my heart desire and
[54:31] prayer
[54:32] to god for israel is that they might be
[54:35] saved
[54:36] you are spiritual israel we know that so
[54:39] i bear them record that they have a zeal
[54:41] of god but not according to knowledge
[54:45] for they being ignorant of god's
[54:47] righteousness
[54:48] and going about to establish their own
[54:51] righteousness
[54:54] have not submitted themselves unto the
[54:57] righteousness of god
[54:58] and that is a warning to you and to me
[55:02] we mustn't have our own righteousness
[55:04] our own self-justification
[55:07] our heart must be easy to repent we must
[55:10] be
[55:10] bendable you know flex spiritually
[55:13] flexed
[55:14] spiritually flexible when the lord bent
[55:16] us this way
[55:17] then so that's how we need to be that is
[55:19] the only way that we are going to be
[55:20] able to gain this the righteousness of
[55:22] god
[55:22] otherwise we are going to be
[55:24] self-righteous and you tell me i can't
[55:26] bend because
[55:27] the way i am i'm right
[55:30] so how is the lord going to mold us he
[55:33] won't be able to
[55:34] we'll be like this israel that paul is
[55:36] praying for them that
[55:37] they have now developed a
[55:39] self-righteousness
[55:41] right let's read verse 4 of the same
[55:44] chapter
[55:45] for christ is the end of the law of
[55:47] righteousness to everyone that believeth
[55:50] for moses
[55:50] is described by the righteousness which
[55:53] is of the law
[55:54] that the man which do it those things
[55:56] shall live by
[55:57] them verse six but but the righteousness
[56:00] which is of faith speaking
[56:02] of the on these wise say not in thine
[56:05] heart
[56:06] who shall ascend into heaven that is
[56:09] to bring christ down from above christ
[56:13] is our righteousness
[56:14] you see and and that is what we need to
[56:16] seek to have the righteousness of god
[56:19] righteousness is called so if you unpack
[56:21] the word righteousness
[56:23] you'll find that righteousness is called
[56:25] his quote is not uh
[56:27] it's not like to be right although that
[56:30] is part of his righteousness has got
[56:32] everything from god he justifies god
[56:35] he's got
[56:36] justification he's just everything you
[56:38] need righteousness that is why christ
[56:40] is our righteousness he's everything for
[56:42] us amen
[56:43] so that is why and to to have him you've
[56:45] got everything
[56:47] to have him in your heart to have the
[56:49] spirit of god and fast for him
[56:51] every day that is what will bring the
[56:53] righteousness of god
[56:55] amen luke 2 luke 6 21 blessed
[56:58] are ye that hunger now
[57:02] blessed is that hunger now for you shall
[57:05] be
[57:05] filled this repeats itself in the bible
[57:08] same bible
[57:09] right blessed ie that weep now
[57:12] for ye shall laugh amos 8
[57:15] 11 behold the days come
[57:19] say the lord behold the day the days
[57:22] come
[57:23] say the lord that i will send a famine
[57:26] feminist hunger
[57:28] in the land not a famine of breed
[57:33] no no no a taste of water
[57:37] but of hearing the words
[57:40] of the lord and this is the day that we
[57:43] are living in
[57:44] where there's hunger everywhere there's
[57:47] famine everywhere
[57:48] but they don't know how to satisfy it
[57:50] the world does not know
[57:52] but me and you have got mount everest of
[57:55] bread
[57:56] have got mount everest of the world have
[57:58] got god himself
[58:01] for me for me is more than an
[58:03] opportunity
[58:04] for me is more than a privilege our
[58:07] young people and teenagers don't have
[58:09] first
[58:09] to test the world before they eat the
[58:12] mountain
[58:13] no that brother's poo brother uh john
[58:16] he said you don't have to go to the wild
[58:17] fest because
[58:19] you've got you you were just born in the
[58:21] milkman you know to be born inside milk
[58:24] you were just born on a plate of gold
[58:28] when we were born when other another
[58:30] child were born in
[58:32] thorns and they had to navigate and be
[58:34] found and be picked up there by the lord
[58:36] you were born on cheese
[58:41] you know cheese
[58:42] [Laughter]
[58:45] i'm trying to explain something that is
[58:47] you know
[58:49] i'm trying to you have born i can't say
[58:52] lucky you are blessed
[58:53] you are born with a wonderful
[58:55] opportunity
[58:56] and a privilege all what you need to do
[59:00] as a young person is to realize that hey
[59:03] i
[59:03] am more than the word lucky let me grab
[59:07] this opportunity
[59:08] lord i'm not going to wait for the devil
[59:11] telling me
[59:12] i don't have the revelation no i have it
[59:15] even if i don't have it
[59:16] i will have it let me keep on moving
[59:20] because first catch the revelation that
[59:22] hey
[59:23] you were born privileged the day you
[59:25] were born
[59:26] god made you ah it's like it's like when
[59:29] the angel came to mary
[59:30] and he said blessed are thou among only
[59:32] men
[59:33] that angel was very right it was
[59:37] the angel was 100 percent correct to be
[59:40] chosen
[59:42] to to give birth to god
[59:46] that's a great privilege but now you and
[59:49] me
[59:50] despite all what happened in our life
[59:52] despite our background
[59:53] here we are tonight we find ourselves
[59:56] here
[59:56] on that was the day today on the 13th of
[59:59] january 2021
[1:00:02] eating believing the message of the hour
[1:00:04] of our time
[1:00:07] i was i was saying to one of my boys no
[1:00:09] no there is nothing wrong
[1:00:11] with doing all various things you see
[1:00:14] there's nothing wrong in eating
[1:00:16] and i'm talking about spiritual
[1:00:18] spiritual things now
[1:00:20] there's nothing wrong to read other
[1:00:22] books of the
[1:00:24] testimonies to read the books of uh
[1:00:29] the matthias the people history the
[1:00:31] what's that
[1:00:32] the fox book of matthias and other
[1:00:34] things those are good to enrich your
[1:00:35] experience and for you to see
[1:00:37] but to be honest with you there is a
[1:00:39] wait for your day
[1:00:42] that is the only one that is going to
[1:00:44] bring you grow
[1:00:45] and make you grow stronger and stronger
[1:00:48] and stronger
[1:00:49] think about this gabby my friend
[1:00:52] how old are you gaby five
[1:00:56] just imagine if mama christine keeps on
[1:00:58] giving her the milk that william drinks
[1:01:01] yeah what will happen to gaby
[1:01:05] just imagine it's not right gabi started
[1:01:08] to eat meat and strong food
[1:01:10] for her to be a tough and a strong girl
[1:01:13] isn't it
[1:01:14] so you that is still food
[1:01:17] but it's not for your day make sure that
[1:01:20] your diet
[1:01:21] is filled with the food for your day
[1:01:24] hunger for the right food for hunger
[1:01:27] that gets satisfied with the wrong food
[1:01:31] it's been a it's been misfilled
[1:01:36] it's not been filled properly that
[1:01:38] hunger is there
[1:01:39] it's a great blessing it's there god
[1:01:41] gave it to you but
[1:01:43] you take it and you fill it up with
[1:01:45] other things that are not really good
[1:01:49] you just cheat on this diet you just
[1:01:50] cheat
[1:01:54] and eat something else that will just
[1:01:56] get that will add another two kilograms
[1:01:58] of the devil
[1:02:05] okay not of the devil but of of not the
[1:02:08] foot of your day
[1:02:09] that will just add another two kilograms
[1:02:11] another 10 calories
[1:02:13] you know of just being a believer just
[1:02:15] being a christian who goes along
[1:02:18] when there's an opportunity to become a
[1:02:20] joshua
[1:02:22] and a caleb who says hey we will take
[1:02:25] that land
[1:02:27] that land is ours we don't care whether
[1:02:30] they've got six fingers
[1:02:32] whether they are taller than us god has
[1:02:34] said it
[1:02:35] and that settled it he said to our
[1:02:38] father abraham not even you moses
[1:02:40] we you we hear you he said even to our
[1:02:43] father abraham
[1:02:44] we will say journey for any foreign land
[1:02:47] will
[1:02:48] be there enslaved and after 400 years
[1:02:50] he'll come and take us
[1:02:52] that's the promise of god with david
[1:02:54] abraham
[1:02:55] abraham who had a child when he was how
[1:02:57] many years
[1:02:58] so that kind of a god don't take him
[1:03:01] light
[1:03:03] amen now
[1:03:06] in the spurgeon word show as the father
[1:03:08] and he suffers this earth brother
[1:03:10] brandon says
[1:03:10] but notice when a man is hungering and
[1:03:13] testing for god
[1:03:15] god will draw nigh to the man always
[1:03:20] give up surrender your will to god
[1:03:23] that's what the prophet says there's
[1:03:26] nothing that me and you are going to do
[1:03:28] if we we find that we are our hunger
[1:03:31] is 70 percent not for god daily
[1:03:34] is time to give up
[1:03:37] and surrender ourselves to god so that
[1:03:39] he can give us a proper hunger
[1:03:42] with a proper diet then they go together
[1:03:46] then you'll see me growing taller and
[1:03:48] you say ah this brother we thought he's
[1:03:49] short
[1:03:51] you see that is what will happen that is
[1:03:54] what will happen
[1:03:55] you'll see me growing stronger and
[1:03:57] bigger
[1:03:59] people in this country they're
[1:04:00] surprising especially of the pacific
[1:04:01] island
[1:04:02] they're big you see
[1:04:05] you know when i see them i think of my
[1:04:06] spiritual big bigness
[1:04:08] i say lord make me like that i want an
[1:04:11] oversized pens spiritually
[1:04:17] xxxxxl spiritually
[1:04:21] so i want to be big right there you see
[1:04:23] i want to eat
[1:04:25] but the red food satisfying the right
[1:04:29] hunger because you if you have anger
[1:04:33] and you're satisfied with the wrong food
[1:04:36] it's still a problem it's a problem not
[1:04:38] to have hunger for the lord
[1:04:40] one point another problem to have the
[1:04:43] hunger of god but satisfy it with the
[1:04:44] wrong food
[1:04:46] that hunger must be said this is now for
[1:04:48] the adults now even the children
[1:04:50] together
[1:04:51] hunger of god is a blessing it shall be
[1:04:54] filled
[1:04:55] don't interrupt the plan of god and fill
[1:04:58] it up with something else
[1:04:59] let's fill it up with the right diet
[1:05:03] if you can't find the food in the
[1:05:04] cupboard go and pray
[1:05:07] how can god give that woman a bowl of
[1:05:09] oil and meal endlessly until then come
[1:05:11] and fail to come and give you food you
[1:05:14] the bride
[1:05:15] who is living at the end of the end of
[1:05:17] times
[1:05:18] the closing of history he put you to
[1:05:21] live here and he comes and ignore you no
[1:05:23] ways
[1:05:24] he'll never do that he will never do
[1:05:27] that otherwise he would have failed to
[1:05:28] be god he will never ever fail
[1:05:30] and he put the bible and all the records
[1:05:34] for you
[1:05:34] to come and use them as a reference and
[1:05:36] say hey devil you can't tell me you
[1:05:39] let me suffer and die i want to have a
[1:05:42] t-shirt if someone can get me brother
[1:05:45] that's what i'm a fool for jesus
[1:05:48] who's full are you at the back and walk
[1:05:51] and walk and walk there in town with it
[1:05:54] i don't know if they'll arrest me bro
[1:05:57] i'm a fool for jesus
[1:06:00] who's full are you at the back that will
[1:06:03] be a nice testimony
[1:06:04] so because that doesn't matter what the
[1:06:07] world says is a lie
[1:06:09] about you we are god
[1:06:13] children period god spoke
[1:06:18] god brought you in the word god gave it
[1:06:20] to you
[1:06:21] let us make our salvation sure
[1:06:24] amen i was reading now what the prophet
[1:06:28] said right
[1:06:28] in the spoken word called the angel of
[1:06:30] the lord
[1:06:32] 1951 the scientific world looks at it
[1:06:36] they hush it
[1:06:37] they don't want to get they don't want
[1:06:38] it to get any further
[1:06:40] so what was was it was it in your day
[1:06:44] but those who are hungering and fasting
[1:06:46] for righteousness shall be filled
[1:06:48] the prophet says this all across the
[1:06:50] message for
[1:06:52] no now and those who are procrastinated
[1:06:55] to see the kingdom
[1:06:57] shall see it right for no man
[1:07:00] can come to my father
[1:07:04] or come to me except
[1:07:07] my father draws me if you hear me saying
[1:07:10] i'll read you what the prophet wrote
[1:07:12] here i'm just reading everything
[1:07:14] as it is the lord
[1:07:19] the lord there's there's those here who
[1:07:22] believe
[1:07:23] the lord the prophet says here you see
[1:07:26] this issue of hunger if
[1:07:30] it comes to a point where it it makes us
[1:07:33] realize that
[1:07:34] okay our hunger don't just come
[1:07:39] no no it is somebody gives us that
[1:07:42] hunger
[1:07:43] that's right you see there's somebody
[1:07:45] who gives us that hunger
[1:07:47] and that person is god he gives us that
[1:07:50] hunger because
[1:07:51] there's no one who can come to god
[1:07:53] unless he is
[1:07:54] called right by god so there's no one
[1:07:58] who's going to hunger
[1:07:59] for god if god did not give you that
[1:08:02] hunger
[1:08:04] right so therefore it is up to us now
[1:08:07] everything that god has done
[1:08:09] is now up to us to make sure that
[1:08:12] what he has already given us we brings
[1:08:15] it to
[1:08:15] manifestation because he has already
[1:08:18] given it to us
[1:08:19] for free so it is for us if we i mean he
[1:08:23] said ask for anything man what is
[1:08:25] anything anything is any anything
[1:08:29] let me make your mind think a little bit
[1:08:32] if you are looking for a car
[1:08:36] to buy a car and you find that i need a
[1:08:38] car but hey i don't have money
[1:08:41] then you ask god for money but then
[1:08:43] money
[1:08:44] can come by waking all by jobs then you
[1:08:46] ask for a job
[1:08:47] then a job that okay then the job
[1:08:51] master must be companies there must be
[1:08:53] jobs out there that
[1:08:54] god must make those companies available
[1:08:57] everything that you need if you find
[1:08:58] that you are not able to ask
[1:09:00] then ask god to give you the ability to
[1:09:01] ask
[1:09:03] so it's anything brothers and sisters
[1:09:05] anything
[1:09:06] for a believer there must not be a point
[1:09:08] of stuck that way you are stuck
[1:09:10] no if there's not if you find that now
[1:09:13] ask for that thing and peg it if you
[1:09:15] find that there's a problem
[1:09:17] here i don't know unpack it then you
[1:09:19] must deal with them individually god i'm
[1:09:21] asking for this
[1:09:22] and for this and for this you find that
[1:09:25] you can't pray
[1:09:26] maybe there's something that is making
[1:09:28] not to be able to pray
[1:09:30] you deal with that thing first unpack it
[1:09:33] and say okay
[1:09:34] the problem is one two three four that
[1:09:35] eventually uh
[1:09:37] brings to the problem of leg of prayer
[1:09:39] then let me deal with these things
[1:09:40] what makes those things to come the
[1:09:42] bottom ones let me deal with them
[1:09:44] until you get to the root of the matter
[1:09:46] why because he said
[1:09:48] ask for anything i'm gonna check my
[1:09:50] watch
[1:09:52] right what time did we start
[1:09:56] 7 30am it's almost five it's almost
[1:10:00] 20 30 now so i'm rapping
[1:10:03] it's a prayer meeting i'm supposed to be
[1:10:04] short i thought i'll take just 20
[1:10:06] minutes
[1:10:07] sorry about that now
[1:10:10] i'll read for you here
[1:10:13] the spoken word is titled scriptural
[1:10:16] science of the
[1:10:16] time and you know faith commits by
[1:10:20] hearing
[1:10:22] hearing the word of god
[1:10:25] there is hearing and there's hearing to
[1:10:30] hear
[1:10:32] you can hear because our ears are open
[1:10:35] in my language they say severalness
[1:10:39] which means an ear has got no lid it
[1:10:42] hears
[1:10:44] the hearing that we are talking about
[1:10:46] here is the hearing
[1:10:47] the the real hearing with
[1:10:51] revelation to hear the word of god
[1:10:55] saying armand i'm talking to you
[1:10:58] and hear your name being called when the
[1:11:00] prophet preaches
[1:11:01] when the pastor preaches you hear your
[1:11:03] name you hear him saying
[1:11:04] paul you my son i'm talking to you
[1:11:08] when you think the pastor was with you
[1:11:10] at your house no he was not there
[1:11:12] it is the word of god calling thy name
[1:11:14] amen
[1:11:15] right that's what the that's what that
[1:11:18] that that's what the prophet says
[1:11:20] faith commits by hearing and he repeats
[1:11:23] it
[1:11:23] why did the bible say did you ever come
[1:11:25] to think of it if you open it then
[1:11:27] you'll see
[1:11:27] faith commit by hearing and it says
[1:11:30] hearing the word of god why does the
[1:11:31] bible repeat the word hearing
[1:11:34] faith cometh by hearing hearing the word
[1:11:36] of god
[1:11:38] for me it was supposed to be to be bold
[1:11:40] that hearing
[1:11:41] and this little queen talking about
[1:11:43] queen of queen of sheba
[1:11:45] this little queen god hung got to
[1:11:47] hungering
[1:11:48] and she wanted to go to this revival and
[1:11:51] she had a whole lot of comfort
[1:11:53] to confront her now the first thing
[1:11:56] she was preparing she would have to go
[1:11:59] to her priest to ask if she i'm sitting
[1:12:02] under correction here
[1:12:03] and if she would she could leave she was
[1:12:06] a queen she was in dignity
[1:12:08] in a celebrity but she was hungering you
[1:12:11] see
[1:12:11] she was hungering because she had
[1:12:15] that in israel there is a god he was
[1:12:18] like graham
[1:12:19] as we heard on sunday amen now
[1:12:22] and and and the question now in
[1:12:24] conclusion brothers and sisters
[1:12:26] is are we hungering
[1:12:29] if we are hungering you know this
[1:12:32] good right if we are hungering for
[1:12:35] righteousness good
[1:12:37] but are we are we feeding our hunger
[1:12:39] with the right diet
[1:12:41] that's the question but the prophet says
[1:12:43] in the message elijah
[1:12:44] brother i tell you when a man is really
[1:12:47] getting
[1:12:48] hungering and thirsting for god he'll
[1:12:50] receive it
[1:12:52] if you are hungering and fasting for god
[1:12:55] you will
[1:12:56] receive it amen the trouble it
[1:12:59] of it is that's the prophet now the pro
[1:13:02] the problem of
[1:13:03] it is that the church is not hungarian
[1:13:06] enough
[1:13:07] tonight that is the problem
[1:13:10] we are hungry but not enough
[1:13:14] a child must get hungry
[1:13:17] for him to grow let us
[1:13:20] ask for more hunger of
[1:13:24] god and by the way our hunger our
[1:13:27] our diet is the word of god but there's
[1:13:30] some there's some
[1:13:31] different vitamins that god is going to
[1:13:33] be feeding you on because according to
[1:13:35] your need
[1:13:36] according to your shortage according to
[1:13:38] your requirements
[1:13:40] god is a wonderful god he he he knows
[1:13:42] your requirements
[1:13:43] and he gives you according to your
[1:13:45] requirements oh vitamin c on b
[1:13:48] and d oh yeah he is b1 oh c
[1:13:51] a you know he gives all those are in his
[1:13:54] word
[1:13:55] full packed ready for me
[1:13:59] and for you all we need to do is to
[1:14:01] hunger more
[1:14:02] hunger more so that our hunger can be
[1:14:05] filled and be filled with the right
[1:14:07] stuff that's what we need to do this
[1:14:10] evening
[1:14:10] that's what i need to do this evening
[1:14:13] for us
[1:14:14] to be able to get righteousness
[1:14:17] from the lord how many loves the lord
[1:14:20] i love him so much and i appreciate him
[1:14:23] i think i finished my two
[1:14:24] my three pages and i my prayer
[1:14:28] is that though i might have not
[1:14:30] expounded this
[1:14:31] in a much more um way
[1:14:35] but i believe that the holy spirit will
[1:14:37] speak to you the holy spirit will drive
[1:14:39] the point home
[1:14:41] that when you go home you'll start to
[1:14:42] regurgitate these things and think about
[1:14:44] them
[1:14:45] just just imagine what will happen if
[1:14:48] you can take
[1:14:49] 50 percent of your time a day thinking
[1:14:51] about god
[1:14:52] think about what will happen i can tell
[1:14:54] you a testimony that one day a flight
[1:14:56] left me
[1:14:57] and a brother we were going for a
[1:14:59] funeral it was going to be
[1:15:00] a friday which was a public holiday on a
[1:15:03] thursday
[1:15:04] we had the airport going to a funeral
[1:15:06] and on saturday a wedding where i was
[1:15:08] supposed to speak
[1:15:09] at a friend's wedding saturday funeral
[1:15:12] for another young brother
[1:15:13] the airport was in johannesburg 1400
[1:15:16] kilometers from cape town
[1:15:18] from the airport we were supposed to
[1:15:19] drive another 600 kilometers at night
[1:15:22] to the funeral bury the brother come
[1:15:24] back and go to the wedding
[1:15:26] another 600 backwards so when we were at
[1:15:29] the airport the flight left us
[1:15:32] and there was there was only three flies
[1:15:34] left to join us back and we were put on
[1:15:36] a list
[1:15:37] waiting list you know when the when the
[1:15:39] where they just say
[1:15:40] if anyone can tell us you can come in we
[1:15:43] were on standby
[1:15:47] and we waited we were at the bottom i
[1:15:50] remember very well i was number 25
[1:15:52] the brother was number 26 meaning all
[1:15:54] those 24 people must first get
[1:15:57] in on standby and they've told us
[1:15:59] clearly is fully booked
[1:16:01] the flight is overbooked we said but we
[1:16:05] need to get there
[1:16:06] we just sat there talk talk talk the
[1:16:08] first one left
[1:16:09] the second one left the third one
[1:16:13] they sent everybody home when it was
[1:16:15] just about maybe
[1:16:17] an hour or so to leave they sent
[1:16:19] everybody home they said let's come
[1:16:20] tomorrow
[1:16:22] morning we'll come in and reboot you on
[1:16:24] the flights
[1:16:25] he said okay everybody took their
[1:16:27] tickets to everything took everything
[1:16:29] and then people left and me and the
[1:16:30] brother just said on this tube they were
[1:16:32] we we did not have any plans we did not
[1:16:35] it's like we are not thinking whether we
[1:16:36] want to go or not
[1:16:37] but we just sat on the stoop or the the
[1:16:40] veranda of at the airport that we were
[1:16:41] just talking
[1:16:42] we were just talking and we talked we
[1:16:44] just fellowshipping i remember we're
[1:16:46] discussing about whether we should go to
[1:16:47] my
[1:16:48] house or his house so that tomorrow
[1:16:49] morning we can come together early
[1:16:52] we are talking talking then when we are
[1:16:54] busy talking about god
[1:16:56] then we were discussing about the
[1:16:57] prophet one day when
[1:16:59] uh that that that flight was delayed was
[1:17:02] was grounded
[1:17:03] and we were starting to talk about that
[1:17:04] and we talked about that and we said yo
[1:17:06] and we were in that discussion not with
[1:17:09] our flies in our minds
[1:17:10] at least i know i was not having that
[1:17:12] flight in my mind i knew
[1:17:14] that for us to go 25 people first must
[1:17:17] go before i can go
[1:17:19] but the key was everybody left
[1:17:22] was supposed to come tomorrow we were
[1:17:24] sitting sitting sitting and talking
[1:17:26] it was about five minutes before the
[1:17:28] flight could take off
[1:17:29] we saw a lady rushing running to the to
[1:17:31] the counter they
[1:17:32] said where are those people from
[1:17:34] johannesburg johannesburg i need two
[1:17:36] people
[1:17:38] brother it was like
[1:17:42] i don't know what happened until even
[1:17:44] when i was already in the aeroplane
[1:17:46] i still could not believe it i was
[1:17:48] already in the role playing on
[1:17:49] air but i still couldn't believe it that
[1:17:52] is how this flesh wants to take you down
[1:17:54] to
[1:17:55] that the thing the word of god is so
[1:17:57] obvious it's so real it's so
[1:17:58] powerful that the devil wants that even
[1:18:01] if you have already received it
[1:18:03] not to believe it how can that be
[1:18:06] i have received the reality of my life
[1:18:09] thank you for that message of reality
[1:18:11] brother i have received the reality
[1:18:14] that's right of the word of god and the
[1:18:16] devil see what
[1:18:17] he you see can the devil can teach us a
[1:18:19] great lesson he doesn't give up
[1:18:24] and actually we are double than him
[1:18:27] we must say oh you are 20 we are 40 boys
[1:18:31] amen if you are 20 we are 40 in terms of
[1:18:34] not giving up
[1:18:35] you can tell us even if i fall now even
[1:18:38] if i do something wrong now
[1:18:40] i tell you devil i am the son of god now
[1:18:44] can i allow the devil to tell you that
[1:18:45] abraham did not have to argue with him
[1:18:48] he just didn't know god spoke amen how
[1:18:51] he's going to do it
[1:18:52] it's not for me how god is going to make
[1:18:56] me have a child when i don't have any
[1:18:58] seat in me
[1:18:59] any nothing my wife how can you how can
[1:19:03] you how can a
[1:19:04] a child a girl who don't meet any man
[1:19:07] get pregnant
[1:19:09] can you sensibly think about it how it's
[1:19:11] going to happen
[1:19:12] is none of my business god the the
[1:19:15] the point is this that we must
[1:19:17] understand the point is that
[1:19:19] god said it and that's the key
[1:19:23] god if god says something that's it
[1:19:25] there's nothing for you
[1:19:26] for me to think about or to try to
[1:19:29] imagine
[1:19:30] how god said i will
[1:19:33] fill you if you hunger for righteousness
[1:19:37] that's it how no no
[1:19:40] he knows because why he said it
[1:19:44] if a god who can say let there be
[1:19:46] planets in the universe
[1:19:48] and they just come spewing out of his
[1:19:50] mouth like the whole universe
[1:19:52] i mean what kind of a god is that one
[1:19:56] and he chooses me who am i
[1:20:00] who are you but me who is nothing
[1:20:04] i wish for the ending can preach a
[1:20:06] message like this out of nothing
[1:20:08] there came something me i'm nothing
[1:20:11] i think if he preaches he can be such a
[1:20:12] powerful sermon out of zero
[1:20:15] god brought something me who was a zero
[1:20:18] who who was less than zero
[1:20:21] god brought himself in there and he made
[1:20:24] me
[1:20:25] something isn't that a great privilege
[1:20:27] brothers and sisters
[1:20:28] therefore let's go hungering let us go
[1:20:31] hungering
