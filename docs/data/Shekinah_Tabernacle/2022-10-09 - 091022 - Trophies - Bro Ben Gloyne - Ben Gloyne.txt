Jimmy amen thank you musicians God bless you all amen praise the lord it's wonderful to be here again today amen hey man let's um go to First Samuel 17 uh this morning I'm going to read uh it's just four verses so um first Samuel 17 51-54 I read here I've got a you know by the handy was speaking on Spoils of War on Wednesday and already earlier in the week I was looking at this I thought well we'll just continue on so I want to talk about trophies today um so first Samuel 17 and 51 therefore David ran and stood upon the Philistine this is Goliath and took a sword and Drew it out of the sheath thereof and slew him and cut off his head their worth and when the Philistine saw their Champion was dead they fled and the men of Israel and of Judah arose and shouted and pursued the Philistines until they came to the valley and to the gates of ekron and the wound of the Philistines fell by the way of uh shaharian even under gath and unto ikron and the children of Israel returned from chasing after the Philistines and they and they spoiled their tents yeah and David took the head of the Philistine and brought it to Jerusalem but he put his armor in his tent praise the Lord amen word of prayer this morning if you've got to need you want to raise it before the law was uplifted hand thank you Lord Jesus that we can truly say you are our Hiding Place Lord you always fill our hearts with songs of Deliverance to the Lord not not songs of unbelief or songs of bondage or doubt but songs of Deliverance floor we trust in you o God whenever we are afraid we thank you Lord we feel the pull of the hour Lord It's You drawing us to yourself Lord you want to you want us to give you a higher praise Lord that because we want to give you a praise that's worthy unto your name oh God and you have the name above every name we thank you so much we can assemble here this morning just want to ask Lord may you come and be the speaker Lord yes Lord father may you be the hearer and the pure as well oh God may you anoint both speaker and hear O Lord we want to surrender all that we are into your hands we're asking dear God may you just cover us in your blood and forgive us of all of our sins and our iniquities law cleanses of our secret folds please Lord may you have the premise in this meeting we thank you so much for your Supreme Grace it's Upon Our Lives and dear Gods we want to commit everything into your hands Lord see the hands that have been raised Lord the knees behind those hands and Lord those who are not here today maybe they're sick or traveling Lord may be their portion father we love you we're so thankful that you first loved us Lord in Jesus Christ's name amen amen God bless you may have your seats this morning so I want to speak about trophies David got one one one big trophy right there amen what do I love about trophies is trophies uh declare something's been won or something's been got a trophy is a um uh uh the uh Mr Google would tell me that there's a couple of meanings of it but it's a souvenir of an achievement especially say a part of an animal that's been taken when hunting now when you think about real Hunters now I can't put myself in that bracket but I'm sure most hunters who are Hunters don't just go wandering out into the bush you Brothers can play say amen and just say well we're gonna go shoot whatever we can shoot and hopefully it's not just the breeze but they're after a specific Target right so so a real Hunter will say I want to get a price stack so I'll go after a price stack or maybe they want you know meat so go after a young dough or a buck yep maybe yep I might cut in this right right way but you know they'll go after something they're after right they're not just going and they see us you know you know they they they go after a deer and they just shoot a goat no they want a deer right that's that that's what they want okay because they're oh if they want to go they get a goat but a hunter will go after a specific Trophy and we'll get that amen so now it's the same thing with our lord Jesus when he stepped down into this Earth he was after trophies now I was I was sharing this with Christine last night and she says you're not trying to say we're glass head are we and I said no because there's multiple just multiple parts of this trophy because our Lord has won trophies over the enemy right he is he has gathered trophies from the devil that the devil could never replace but then also we are God's trophies as well we are his jewels that he'll sit in a in a crown so what I love about testimonies is testimonies don't start off as a glory but they start off as a shame where because before the testimony comes it's a shame upon a person where like you look at Goliath for example he was ashamed to Israel here was one man defying their whole Army defying their whole nation that Nation had God behind them it wasn't just any other nation that a god of stone or wood or some nice idea but it was the Living God that was their God and and But but so so they had they were serving an Unstoppable God but nothing could stop stop him the devil cannot stop him he couldn't stop him back there he won't stop him today and if they were serving an Unstoppable God they were Unstoppable but yet here was a man who was stoppable stopping the Unstoppable that was a shame to them Goliath was ashamed because here they were both Moses and Joshua said one will chase a thousand one will chase a thousand so you think about that now it never says so we'll just read Joshua 23 and 10. one man of you shall chase a thousand for the Lord your God he is that Fighter for you as he has promised you so in that verse is nowhere about how big the Thousand will be in terms of stature it didn't say it would be a thousand midgets or a thousand cripples no or a thousand Giants it doesn't matter as one will chase a thousand so it didn't matter how big the enemy was one man would chase a thousand so in other words one man could not a thousand men could not stop one man now here was the whole Army of thousands so really in reality they far outnumbered all of the Philistines and our God is so Unstoppable that David on the inspiration said I'm going to kill you Goliath I'm going to and I'm going to kill all the Army right here if he had to do a single-handedly he would have done it yeah right but here was the Unstoppable being stopped by the stoppable and that was a shame that was a shame to to Israel and it's the same thing with something before it becomes a testimony it's a shame to that person you know when someone's not free it's a shame that that living below their privilege Israel was living well below their privilege by being out in tents for 40 days when they could have just killed him and moved on and won the victory you know on day one so if someone's not free it's a shame to that person but when they're willing to call upon the Lord and surrender their lives then he comes and defeats that enemy and then it becomes a victory and it becomes a glory or a testimony see someone who's really free of something they're not afraid to testify they are delivered of it because they're free of it but they're still under the bondage of that spirit all right they're they're ashamed about it because they're not actually free they may say they're free but they're not actually free so someone who is under the bondage of Allah spirit is not ashamed to say I was freed of a lost spirit because it becomes a trophy it becomes a testimony right or Pride or something like that someone who hides behind Pride well it's a shame but then when they get free to that Pride Spirit they meet the Lord it becomes the glory it becomes the testimony I mean to hear Thy word thou living under the shame but then one man stepped forth and say who is this uncircumcised fallacy that would defy the armies of the Living God and then he prophesied to to Goliath I know you know the story but he prophesied to Goliath his end and and the first Prophecy of the defeat of the devil was given in the Garden of Eden where where God told the devil said the seed of the woman is going to crush or bruise the head of the seed of The Serpent and so it was prophesied of his Doom there and then it was manifested that day on Calvary of his defeat and then he's going to burn in the Lake of Fire so the first father prophecies being fulfilled the second part's on its way amen so here was David now he takes a sword of Goliath he chops off Goliath's head and he raises up that Trophy and so now here is now notice here is the strongest devil in the whole Army it wasn't a weakling Philistine that fought David it was the champion it was the champion of champions Goliath of gath and he raised up his head as a trophy and then all of us draw rally tight now if a Shepherd boy can take a giant down how many can I take out and at rally them it gave them faith and they pursued and we read and they and they conquered their foes now what I love about God is he wants to realize the victories he's won you can win the same victories so the Mighty Men when they came to their position under the anointing of the hour saying that David would come into power they realized so if the same anointing that was upon him that allowed him to kill goliaths upon me we can take these Giants down too I mean slave riffs lifted up some trophies as well Aaliyah said now here's our lord Jesus I'm just gonna jump a few thousand years after that event and now here he is he's hanging on Calvary the devil thinks he's got him but the devil's about to face the greatest defeat he will ever be defeated with and he cannot get back what he's about to lose so the so the Stinger of you know that bee of death is buzzing around our lord Jesus and he stung many a man he stung Mighty prophets man Mighty woman of God down Through the Ages and it's and it's and and the sting has got in and it's come out and so no doubt the devil thinks he's he's just a man like any other man sure he's done Mighty Miracles he's cast metal out of a lot of people he's caused me a lot of trouble and you know but but he's just like any other man because if he was God he wouldn't be strip naked Scourge beaten hang on a cross as an open shame in front of the people but so he couldn't quite work out who he was but now here comes the Stinger of death and then our lord Jesus says it is finished and then and then he goes to sink his stinger in but then but then an unseen hand grabs that stinger and says this is mine he tries to pull it back up it just rips out of his body and you know it be when it loses Stinger it's on his death run right it's it's it it's it's life is going out of it's the same thing with the devil when he was conquered that down Calvary his life is going to leave him right so now he doesn't have a stinger really is is a big buzz and so now but now the thing is when our Lord gathers trophies he loves his trophies off looking all the way from that Valley to Jerusalem carrying glass head Hallelujah Maybe This Time got a bit tired he'd raise it with this arm but he want everyone to see all of Israel to see look who God has delivered into my hands he's a conquered Foe and the Lord Jesus the same way he's got that singer of death he didn't leave it there he's still packing it around and he steps in among his church and raises it up see our conquered hell death in the grave I have the keys of hell and death in my possession and he and he walks in our mitts and he raises them up and saying look this is one of conquered and then Faith rises in the people's hearts saying about Champion Concord hell death in the grave what's this Pride what's this what's this trouble losses for setting sin compared to that if he's conquered the head devil and all the ones under him what is this thing facing me Hallelujah and that's what he loves to do that's why I just you know I just so moved thinking about it he walks in our midst and he holds the Stinger up here's my trophy I was coming for this as the purpose I came to the world that I would defeat destroy the Devil Hallelujah and look I've still got it in my possession we can rally children amen I've conquered your greatest foe the thing you feared the most is death but I've conquered death amen to that Stinger that's why that's why the Apostle pulled down the end of his Road they were sharpening that ax saying we're going to cut your head off boy you know you've come to the end but he'd say death where is yours grave where's your stink death where's your Victory but thanks be to God it gives us a victory through Jesus Christ Our Lord yeah they would give out their threatenings and you know maybe that executioner executed a lot of men but Paul was different why is he happy why is he smiling this man must be a crazy man no he got his mind amen he found his mind when he got the mind of Christ he wasn't a crazy man he knew exactly where he was going I mean he was caught up to the third Heavens he knew where he was going it wasn't a surprise when he stepped from this world to the next world where he was going because it was revealed to him it should be the same way with you and I I mean when the Holy Ghost comes into our lives that's actually God saying you are coming with me amen I'm not going to leave you here it's not a hope so that you have a resurrection you have a no-so that's how it should be with you and I shouldn't it should be such an assurance in my heart it doesn't matter if I go by the way the Graver by the way the Rapture I'm going I'm not going down I'm going up I'm ascending a fear saying that I'm ascending as well Hallelujah so trophies are a great thing amen our Lord has a lot of trophies now when we when he gives us testimonies he gives us trophies of his grace and we're going to realize like David it wasn't David that killed Goliath that was God and David that killed Goliath right just like he gave him the lion and the bear that's why he said to Saul well God gave me a line and a beer into my hand he'll do the same thing with Goliath he didn't say well I killed the lion and I killed the bear no God God gave them to me so when he gives you testimony she doesn't want you to put them in the cupboard or under the stairs he wants you to show off your trophies I mean God delivered me of many things many troubles many hardships and you can raise those trophies up and say God's grace is sufficient God's grace is more than enough they'll be delivering me of this he'll deliver you he's still the same God today and we can take those trophies and say Lord you won great trophies in my life Hallelujah and it goes from a shame and to a glory why is the glory of God on the people is trophies that he's won US amen it's my helper I shall not fear I ra he'll lead me through yo by Green Pastures besides Still Waters we don't need to fear Hallelujah why because he gives us Glory the devil wants it to be a shame but no it becomes a great glory in our lives amen when we rarely meet God I say we can really meet God he really gives us trophies that's not just a different way of thinking it's a reality I mean things once plagued Our Lives maybe plagued Our Generations of family but it stops in your life although you can lift up that Trophy and say no God break Cycles he breaks pain he breaks hurt amen he breaks indifference or stubborn spiritual whatever maybe he breaks all those things and he wants because he wants you because he rejoices when we get a victory he rejoices when the devil's defeated in our lives he gets excited they're just like me amen they're made of the same stuff hallelujah amen I conquered so they conquered Hallelujah you know you see your kids they win something they win a race or they get some prize at school you're proud of them aren't you yeah they bring a certificate home for certain things like praise God I'm so proud of you honey that's awesome same thing with the Lord you know we said Lord you won this battle in our lives and he gets so proud of you he's like that's my children my blood works there will see trying to recover and he gets a phone call from God see I'll put you on video and look at that yeah see he's still packing it you can't get it back hey man it's the same thing with the trophies that God has you know there are some trophies you know in the natural and the natural see a trophy um you know especially in ancient Greece or Rome was weapons of a defeated enemy set up as a memorial of Victory all right I mean now with natural armies you lose some armies you lose some weapons you can replace them you can reforge swords you can make armor you can you know even now no doubt Russia's building tanks and there you know they're replenishing everything they've lost but when it comes to God and the devil the devil cannot replace conquered weapons but he can't they become a look they become a memorial or a trophy but he can't get them back so he can't grow another stinger right he cannot grow another Stinger he cannot stop the Holy Ghost flowing among the people he cannot just bring Superstition in and conquer the people no more because his schemes have been exposed in this end time where the fullness of God has been poured out and we know he lives so we won't settle for anything less just like David he's carrying Goliath's head he's like we won't set off anything less as well we're going to conquer the whole land we're not going to settle for being under bondage no more and I believe it would be the same with all the judges when they when God arose in their lives and they conquer the enemy but we're not going back to bondage no more it was the Next Generation that forgot God that went down into slavery but those who knew the power of God saying we are not going to be slaves no more we have trophies to prove he's alive announcements Hallelujah and it's the same thing I trust with you and I we ain't going back and don't believe no more we haven't gone into Superstition we're not letting something that's stoppable stop the Unstoppable I mean so don't let something stop you when you are meant to be unstoppable hallelujah hallelujah amen we have Memorials of victory but they're living Memorial I mean they're not some dead piece of slab somewhere with a plaque you know this day whatever this happened no it's a living Memorial amen that's why the apostles and the other 120 the upper Emperors shout and rejoice right I mean because the one who had the Stinger stepped into the building yeah stepped into the building and then just wave it in front of him he stepped into them but in them that's the same thing with you and I the same Victory that's why the book of Acts is still being written amen those Believers in that they were victorious the enemy came against them but they realized hey if my God conquered hell death in the grave what can man do to me what can these Spirits do to me what could nothing they can't do nothing because my God's already conquered them hey man so he now steps into his people and continues to live out the victory Hallelujah but you see you've got to come to a time when you diet to yourself and then you have a Heaven amen where it's where it goes beyond arguments or ideas or culture or upbringing becomes a reality amen where brother man was saying the message Victory Day says we don't need their organizations we don't need their stuff for this world to have we don't have to tell you in the things of the world we've had a v-day a victory day we wrestled out one day or one night oh I remember the wrestle when I had to die out to myself then there came a v-day when I got the victory then God's word became right so if God's word has not become right to you you need a v-day you diet to yourself and let God live hey man say he said the Baptist Church to me is no more than any other organization that's right I had a v-day God's word is right Hallelujah now we understand by Isaiah 14 that the devil has made this world A wilderness yeah he's made it a Wilderness you say well there's more people upon the Earth right now there's more life upon the Earth right now than ever has been in terms of human population and that may well be very true but in terms of life it is a Wilderness I'm not just about natural life not about the life of God where eternal life is blooming it's in very few people today sadly and this world is a Wilderness we know there's catastrophic if time would go on this nature is failing nature is groaning for a for a for a birth you know it's looking for the manifestation of Sons and Daughters of God you know so so Nature's groaning nations are groaning they see that it's only a few minutes till midnight of the Doomsday Clock of nuclear nuclear destruction we understand all these things but the world has been made a Wilderness as he says in Isaiah 14 verse 17 that made the world as a Wilderness and destroyed the cities thereof that open not the house of his prisoners this is this is what the devil has done now what I like about our God is it doesn't matter how bad the world gets it doesn't stop them going right to get his trophies now I'm going to talk about him Gathering you right so so it doesn't stop him Gathering his trophies but when he we story of the parable in Matthew 18 of the of the shepherd where where he says now how thank ye he says for the son of man has come to save that which is lost how thinky if a man have a hundredth sheep and one of them has gone astray doth he not leave the 199 and goeth into the mountains and seeketh that which is gone astray and if so be find it very Sandy he rejoices more of that sheep than of the 90 and nine that went not astray even so it's not the will of your father which is in heaven that one of these little ones should perish so so now now now you see the shepherd doesn't look at the mountain say the Mountain's too high all the all the Glaciers are too cold or there's too much bushes or other conditions aren't right no a real Shepherd will go after that sheep that is lost they will not just go get any sheep they'll go get a particular sheep they're not the one that was on their heart or their mind or I'd say on their heart that sheep that was on their heart they will go get it was like I've said it before when I've gone to pick up the girls from school yo I don't just go get any girl that's it that's their age I don't just go oh that one will do that one's closer to the car here come home you're mine no I got to get them I'm going to get them I'm not getting anyone else they may look near the same maybe was a double gang or whatever it's called like a look-alike you know no they don't have them there at school but you know they're originals but you know you know but I'm not gonna go any girl from their class I'm getting them right and I'm not gonna settle until I get them and bring them home see to me that's that's the heart of a father is he's gonna get his children he's not just going to get anyone he's going to get the ones that are on us huh amen says the same thing with the Sheep a real Shepherd here won't just go get in your sheep but he wants to get the one that that particular one that was on his heart on mine before the foundation of the world now our great Shepherd is not satisfied with most of his sheep redeemed most of his children he wants them all and he has certain people in his heart that he knew that he's looking for names that are written on the last book of life before the foundation of the world Amen so he is very particular in the ones that he's going after aren't you glad he came looking for you he came looking for me I mean not just anyone even though it's too super old let them come but he's got names he's got a family album he wants to see that album restored praise the Lord so our Shepherd stepped into the Wilderness of this world to find us and it didn't matter how big of a Wilderness it might have been he's determined to find them amen he's determined to find you and I oh yes it's amazing a sheep is an incredibly um kind of pathetic animals they get lost easy they get disorientated easy you know they they they you know uh they have no kind of homing pigeon kind of thing and built in them they can get they they get very sick very easy they're not very strong-willed kind of creatures this is this is how God describes us we need a Shepherd hey doesn't matter you can be the most crippled up sheep in the whole herd but if you've got a Shepherd if you're next to the need to worry right so let the weak say I am strong amen so so now so sheep can get caught with its wool and you know Blackberry or thorns and they can struggle away and they can push and pull and you know try and free themselves but they're hidden out of sight it's hard for the shepherd to find them but there's nothing like a bleeding cry as it goes across the valley right so it's the same thing we can be caught up in sin maybe in Pride fornication something that's you know not drugs or whatever it may be we get caught up in Prior your popularity whatever it may be it's but but to me it's like Blackberry it's Thorns you're scoring and you can struggle away saying I can manage this I'm okay I'm doing fine but you just caught in a second and and many times we'll try and improve ourselves saying we're never going back to that thing again and then next minute here we are but you see you see it takes the Cry of the sheep together to to get the shepherd's attention right so they hear the bleeding of the sheep you just find a Shepherd can't find them maybe if they're stuck in a Thicket somewhere but when they stop fighting and start bleeding that's when the shepherd can find them and free them same thing with you and I when we just stop fighting and start bleeding saying father God help me Lord Jesus help me I'm quoting this help me Lord then if that's when he reaches down his hands takes the thorns out get you out of that Blackberry put you on your shoulders put you on his shoulders rather and begins to carry you to the Sheepfold and then we become living trophies of his grace now it doesn't matter what the shepherd of it have to if it has to kill a whole pack of wolves to get to that sheep it'll do it yeah if it's going to take down a lion or a beer whatever it may be that may be after that sheep's life that Shepherd's gonna kill those animals because it's got that sheep and it's mine and it must get that sheep back it's not satisfied until that sheep is back in the fold so the same thing with God he doesn't get intimidated by the devil Henry's packing the Stinger of death he's already conquered he's got the keys of Hell death in the gray so he doesn't get intimidated by how bad the world gets or how bad our situation is that we think we're in amen but he is he is determined that all that the father has given me will come to me yeah hallelujah amen so now he's determined to find them now when he picks us up on our shoulders it's amazing where you know how easy a sheep is very susceptible to disease that's why you know who's heard the saying you're a bit of a dag who knows what a dag really is I don't know how it's a compliment but you know people are a bit and anyway but you know they they get they get Fly strike they get you know bugs and stuff under there under their wool and they get sick very easy they're gonna be drenched and looked after all the time their walls got to be cleaned and and they can't really do it themselves so that's why it takes God now because a trophy has to be mounted yeah right to actually for it to take its real glory amen so a real trophy is going to be mounted just like you know when we're in um when we're in Canada we're at uh uh Seth and Hannah O'Brien's house they've got these big this big bison head I think I put on the brothers yo I think their daughter shot the thing I think is that right some of that but yeah there's a big massive thing and then another one on the ground they had to put up on the wall too but it was this mad but it had to be mounted couldn't just be put in the garage yo it's got to be mounted in this right place look at this trophy there's a mammoth of a thing but you see it's the same thing now God doesn't just want to gather us and just that's it but he's got a place that's in our right setting amen all right Hallelujah so now he's got to clean us up restore us back into our rightful position in the sheepfall so he's going to take the diseases out of our life and I'm talking about spiritual diseases he you know our God doesn't just save us and then we're still stuck in the same you know who's ever seen a sheep all muddy and they're all you know fly-strucking and all sickly he doesn't leave us like that he heals us he takes those things away he cleans us up and that's why it's not just well you know I need his grace and I fall every day I get back up no there's overcoming power right there's overcoming power we go from glory to glory the things we once bothered us now that don't bother us anymore because we're climbing higher every day right Amy it's that besetting sin that that beset us Once Upon a Time doesn't beset us anymore right because we're going higher in the law then that's how it should be amen it's not just a cycle all the way of going around the mountain no no we're gaining ground we're becoming more like him Hallelujah because we're going to realize that yo our lord Jesus all power is given unto him in heaven and on Earth he has the keys of hell and of death that's Revelations one right when the Stinger of death met God it had never been the same this is Brother Baron from that time until now death is no Stinger so I just throw these things amen now he had these things so he conquered he conquered death he conquered all of the all the hordes of hell he has conquered he has conquered the man in an open show praise the Lord but you see he did that because he has a trophy in mind that's a trophy but it's not the trophy right he didn't just do that say look devil I've got your stinger you know death has no power anymore and all those things I've conquered sickness and you know every Spirit no he did those things to get you that's right he did those things to get you he took care of the sin question to get you so now our lord Jesus the greatest the greatest trophy he can ever get is you amen now he would he would stand after after he ascended in in Acts chapter one he's been our intercessor for for seven Church ages he's still there today interceding on our behalf right we always need blood right amen and then and then and then once we are up in glory well then the Jews need the blood because the grace goes back to them right they'll always be in atonement for somebody praise the Lord amen so I'm so thankful he's my mediator right now but then it came a point in this age where he would Advance forth and claim the sealed book in in Revelations four and five where the mighty Angel would cry out a strong Angel would Proclaim with a loud voice who's worthy to open the book and to lose the seals thereof now in that book was everything that Adam lost right and you're in that book because him taking the book brother Brown says it's the same as Boaz redeeming Ruth so it's not just a book with paper it's actually a living people as well amen so now here he is he's Kong he's got these trophies but he did all that so he can lay claim on you he can get you back to his side that's why he did all those things that's why he died on Calvary to redeem you back to your rightful position right there's a place by him amen for you to occupy amen so he would he would be there and then that cry would come forth and John would weep because no man was worthy to take the book all of the redeemed are represented in that scene so all the mighty prophets Enoch was there Joseph was there Moses was there Elijah there Elijah King David all the mighty mighty men and women of the ages down through and we're represented in that scene as well I mean but none of us are worthy because of our first birth right because of our sexual birth we are we are born wrong to begin with but but there was one who was born that bypassed the original sin our lord Jesus and so the cry was who's worthy and then he began to weep but then because no man was found worthy to take the book but then one of the elders said don't whip John don't weep don't weep on your state this is not the end you're not stuck where you are you think you're stuck but you're not stuck creation you may think creation is stuck but it's not stuck that's why there's never too big a hole that God can't get you out of but I'll say don't fall in in the first place if you can avoid it you should be able to avoid it if you're surrendered to God right but there's no sometimes we we look up and we say how can I get out of this that's just the bleeding of the sheep and God can reach down and pick you up amen so he says don't weep because the lion of the tribe are due to the root of David hasbrovals to open the book and to lose the Seven Seals are off so the one who has a stinger of death walked in from The Eternity and he took that book and brother says it's the most Sublime act in scripture why is it the most Sublime acting strip scripture because he was one no man could do it but the Lambs right and God's God's law required a kinsman redeemer but no one is born worthy of it but then God's grace produced the product and our Lord Jesus Christ which fulfilled his law and now we can be redeemed praise the Lord back to our God Amen so so now he has a trophy amen but he wants to put this book in your hand in your mouth The Inheritance right and it's also as I said it's it's symbolic of Boaz redeeming Ruth amen amen that she went from a widow with nothing to be Mrs Boaz of Bethlehem he was a mighty man of wealth she became a mighty woman of wealth because of everything uh he he had and then she came to the lineage of Jesus Christ coming right praise the Lord now it says in Malachi 3 and 16. we just read this then they that feared the Lord spake often one or to another and the Lord hearkened and heard it and a book of remembrance was written before him for them that feared the Lord and that thought upon his name yeah praise the Lord you talk about God God begins to write a book of remembrance that's right that's right amen are the things you do things you talk about amen so if you've them that fed the Lord and thought upon his name and they shall be mindset the Lord of hosts in that day when I make up my jewels and I will spare them as a man spareth his own son that serveth him so there's going to come a time he says I'll make I will they shall be mine so if they are mine they're not the devil so if they're Gods they're not the Devils that's why you gotta settle in your heart the devil has no pardon me I have no pardon him so blood totally broke that chain broke that Union Yes yes amen amen I believe it Hallelujah says in that day in the day when I make up my jewels and that says in Zechariah 9 and 16 and the Lord their God shall save them in that day as the flock of his people and they shall be as the stones of a crown lifted up as an in sign upon his land oh how great is his goodness and how great is his beauty corn shall be shall make the young men cheerful and new wine the mates that means they shall be as stones of a crown now you think about stones or Jewels you know we just had the Queen's funeral and you know some of the biggest diamonds in the world are in those crown jewels there and but you see when that Jewel was found it wasn't cut like that she could hold that stone up or have you know and and there'd be no sunlight to come through it to show it's inner beauty and it's the same thing with you and I you know our Lord's got to take us out of the earth we can be covered in a lot of things like the woman like Legion was covered in a lot of dirt Legions of Devil's had him covered over right he was barely a resemblance of a human being he was naked in the tombs cutting himself attacking people that came by worse than a wild animal but then brother Brown says unconverted man is actually worse than a beast and so so here he was buried in a lot of Earth but the Lord knew there was a jewel There Our God's a prospector but he can look right into a mountain and see where the gold is where the diamonds are every precious thing in that mountain he can see and that's why he looks into your heart and he because he's the great prospect that he can look beyond what even you see you take this say say this hill for example I'm not saying it's there but imagine if this hill was actually just a hill of gold and all he had to dig down was this much and it was just this motherload of the best gold in the world now if we look from the outside we say there's no value of that Hill yeah I mean there's there's there's some weeds and some you know there's a house there and some trees and there's not 10 billion dollars of value in that Health if we just look from the outside yeah but if you had an eye and you could look into that Hill you'd say no there's 10 billion dollars worth of gold in that Health it just has to be revealed and then the other people will see hey what that person's saying is true so it's the same thing with us many times we look at this thing we say there ain't 10 000 words worth of value in this thing yeah all right man but then you need the prospected account just like the Lord can look into our hearts and see there is the most valuable jewel in existence as in the heart of man right so then he begins to prospect so he takes you and there's something in you says yes Lord I will go I will come unto you oh God take my life make it thine but it doesn't just take a hump of rock and then put it in a crown remember he he's here to get trophies yes right he's here to get trophies but the trophy's got to be mounted now we're our heads are not being stuck on a wall like a bison all right right or a stag or whatever no but where jewels to be put in his crown now the value or the Majesty of a kingdom can be symbolized and how big the crown is and how Priceless the jewels are that's right right you take the yo yo you're the crown jewels of England some of those diamonds are that they are unique they cannot be replaced if they got stolen you they can't make another one they can't find another one yeah yeah right it's just the same thing with us God wants to show off his trophies and we are not just the bride of Christ is not just some common you know false gold or some little very common kind of cubic zirconium or whatever some fake diamond no where we are unique yeah you may not think you're special and unique but God knows that's how you are right so we take you as this hunk of rock but he wants a prospect now he wants to take that rock and get out the diamond amen oh look just like the Sheep that's caught up in the mountain see we read there in Matthew 18 that the that the shepherd rejoices more in the one that he found than the 99 he already had why because that that sheep becomes a trophy of his grace and of his determination God's very determined amen God's determined to have a body without spot or wrinkle washed in his blood oh I believe it amen so so now here we are with this with these uh precious stones he'll take us and then he'll wash us and then he'll cut us praise the Lord because he wants he wants his light to shine through us I mean you take any kind of um precious stone you hold it up to the light and and you see the light is reflected through it and it gives a certain color and different things and the and the and the person that knows how to cut Stones I know nothing about this but the person knows how to cut Stones knows exactly how much to cut in order to to retain the greatest value in the stone and to make it Sparkle the most now with us God doesn't lose any of our value when he cuts us crazy right but he's he's revealing a hidden character a hidden beauty that was already within us now brother Brian she's here in the um the Masterpiece now we know our lord Jesus was the first Masterpiece right you know well rather Adam and Eve were the first Masterpiece but then God after the devil marred that Masterpiece and he wouldn't be defeated he's going to rebuild it so Jesus our lord Jesus was the second Adam so he was the first part of that Masterpiece husband and wife together as one and then he was going to rebuild the second part of that Masterpiece which is the bride of Christ and so brother Brown would say this as it had taken him four thousand years to make this masterpiece that he's been so so that so that's our Lord now he's been for nearly 2 000 years making another Masterpiece a bride for Christ another Masterpiece in doing so he does it by his never-changing method the same way he made the Masterpiece his word that's the way he makes his masterpieces because he can only be a perfect Masterpiece when it's the perfect word any dirt or trash injections it'll break but Heaven and Earth will pass away but that word will never break you remember in cutting of a diamond that you have to have a perfect tool to do it with not just any piece to do it I've seen tons of them big Grinders Crush right through it and move over big tons over and pass that diamond right on through no it won't break the diamond it has to be cut yeah I mean amen it has to be cut and then he says this in the evening miss you oh this old Bible's full of gold gracious nuggets I like to prosper I mean prospect on you and just go in there and Shake all the dust off it and look at it and see it see what it is how the jewels you know they're um you people here in in Arizona the great jewels that come from the dust of the earth and where they come from and God's Jewels are brought up from the dust too we're so happy he gives us the privilege of going into his great Refinery and all the dross be taken out yeah so he will take us now but he's not going to set us in the way he finds us but he knows within us because he's the great Prospect who can look into every heart and say that's the diamond I need that's the Ruby I've lost that you know this is a sapphire what right who's going to set us as jewels in his crowns Hallelujah see how God doesn't put us in the corner somewhere no he loves because if you see see someone with a great big you know crown on where where is your attention drawn to the bling there walking him right that's the bling they've got it's the same thing with our Lord I don't mean anything about sacrilegious that way but I want to get your attention same thing with us he loves to show us off look at my trophies look at my Jewels look at the ones that I have found and I've and I've you know and then he cuts Us by his word amen right so he'll cut Superstition off us he'll cut every Spirit off us that's not of him right so spiritually may have been you're inherited you know of you know of malice or unforgiveness business resentment even lust Spirits are passed down you know we can be in a place we can you know people get alcoholic Spirits because they start drinking alcohol too much and that Spirit jumped or drugs are saying that Spirit gets into them all witchcraft super religious Spirits they all but he wants to cut those off because he cannot reflect himself through a jewel that's covered in that kind of mud and he doesn't want us leave us covered in mud and dirt he wants to cut those things off because he wants to hold us up in his life and see us reflect himself amen hallelujah so we've got to be cut for all these things are going to be cut from us that's why it's so important when we when we realize the value of giving ourselves to the word of God right because he wants to cut us and shape us and set us in a right setting which is his crown his jewels now it's so important the baptism of the Holy Ghost is incredible is incredibly vital amen that is incredibly vital now I want to make a segue here because I'm talking about Jill's being sent now many times we think of adoption as some far-off thing in the future and the fullness of the adoption is the change of the body we understand that don't we so we're looking for the fullness of adoption the chain who's looking for a body change praise the Lord some people who are 10 and under maybe not because they're enjoying being kid but the older you get the more you say man I need it I need an upgrade praise the Lord but you see that's the fullness of adoption and the book of Ephesians says we're predestined under the adoption of sons right so the fullness of that adoption is the change of the body so now I've been an adoption in the in the Bible if we read here in um Galatians 4 he says now I say this at the ear as long as he is a child different nothing from a servant though he be Lord of all but as under tutors and governors till the time appointed of the father even so we when we were children were in bondage under the elements of the world but when the fullness of the time was come God sent for the Sun made of a woman made under the law to redeem that to redeem them that we're under the law that we might receive the adoption of sons now this word adoption is the placing of a son it is not like in the western world or actually play every other part of the world where you get someone who's a child who's not blood relation to you not born of you and you and you adopt them or you bring them illegally into their into your family yeah that is not this adoption this adoption means in the Greek it means the placing of the sun yes so this is where that we would receive the adoption of Sun so we'll be placed in the body where he wants us to be in the body now some people want to put this off is that when I get adopted that I'll have all power I'll cast out Devils I'll be an overcomer I will conquer all when I'm there but no when you receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost now to me that is the adoption robe that's why it's so vitally important you get that robot and when you have that robon of the Holy Ghost that is like you being sent in his crown you're being cut by the word now how fast does it take to be cut by the world work word surrender a full death to self it's not a wrestle anymore of a negotiation process see many people wanted to negotiate with God you can have Sunday morning but I want Saturday morning or you know you can have Wednesday night but I want after Wednesday night you know I want this part no you can touch this part of my life sure I'll change how I dress but my private life is totally different it's not a full surrender but I want to keep my little hobby it's so important to me it won't be and be important things that we hold on to so much in this life will mean nothing over there right so it takes a full surrender because it's a big we say well but one day we'll receive power no okay I'll say this Caleb when he got his adoption he said well you know when he got his adoption he took his City his place in the land when did he have the power to conquer every enemy before he got there yeah right when he crossed the win when he's standing by Mount Sinai and he heard the word from Moses and he said we're more and then he went over with Joshua and said we're more than able to take the land he didn't go with the crowd God said he had another spirit with him what Spirit was that that was God's spirit it wasn't an unbelieving religious spirit it was the spirit of God and then so he had power God gave him power there to go take his Mountain so you could say he got on a new rope his adoption robe was that was when he received when when he got that different spirit with him but then that took him too receive his inheritance but he but he wasn't well one day when I take my Mountain then I'll bow to conquer every enemy no he received that power or that Authority before he physically took it right as the same thing with you and I people say one day one day when the bride is adopted one day when she's placed she's placed already see we're going to realize the position we're already been set in right brother Brown would say oh if the church only knew its position it will one day then the Rapture will go he's not saying when she gets into a position because you're going to look at chronologically where he is when he's preaching yeah right so even in the adoption series the church is on its way but the book hasn't come open yet right but then after that he says oh you know in Christ I miss you God revealed he says now the new birth is Christ is a revelation God has revealed it to you this great mystery that's a new birth now what are you going to do when you get all that group together when the Revelation is perfectly in Harmony and God expressing it through his word by the same actions the same things that he did make his word manifest oh if the church only knew its position it will one day then the Rapture will go when it knows what it is right he's not saying if they could only get there he said no the church is in its position but she doesn't realize where she is just like a jewel in a crown if you only realize where God has placed you oh yeah he hasn't put you in the cupboard he's not put you in a place of just dirt and Rick yo thinks he's not looking for no he came looking for you right and his word has cut you and he set you in his crown what to shine to reflect his life hallelujah amen so so if you've got if you truly have the Holy Ghost you are adopted Brotherhood since the adoption series it's like the tutor will take the take the sun says now we're going up this hill and then the sun says well as long as you're with me we'll get there you know but it's pretty steep now I'm coming with you and then he just stays with the tutor and then and then brother dramatizes the tutor goes to the father and says well how is he how's he going he says well he stays right with me trust your word exactly believes exactly what I tell him as well because the attitude becomes right right some people get angry at God God why'd you leave me here no it's because they're not fully trusting the tutor and when you fully trust the tutor then you get adopted you receive the Holy Ghost when you fully surrender right amen so it's not something we're not looking for this in the future that's right it's going on right now brother amps is an adopted position in the body is a housewife is that well that's such a common thing no that's very powerful you can stand there for your family you can Interstate for them you can you can pray on their behalf you can create an atmosphere in the home maybe when they step in then all the devil could be piled up and then they walk through the door those bugs have got to fly those Spirits have got to get out because white there's an atmosphere in the home Amos let's not just preachers who are adopted or deacons or musicians no it's the whole body but we've got to realize that we've received if you really have the Holy Ghost you have that adoption robot I mean you've already been cut by the word now God just wants to shine his light through you that's what he wants to do Hallelujah that's what he wants to do now why does he want to do that it's like David's Mighty Man if David can down that giant and his anointing is upon me I can do the same thing I said it earlier so I've got to realize no it's not one day we'll be able to no now we can that's why we shouldn't put up for dead stiff services and that's why we shouldn't put up for a dead prayer life right we should be under expectation just like Daniel praying oh Jehovah God hallelujah and God would come down and step into his prayer meetings and just like in the book of Acts God would come down and change things he'd take over their voices and pray things that they never thought of that's how we should be that's what we should expect it's not us trying to generate anything not to surrender to him say Lord what would you have prayed what kind of life would you have lived today Lord come and live in my life Shine Your Life Through Me Hallelujah because you have Jewel sin and darkness that they just look like they're just in darkness but when you hold them into the light oh yeah you can look at man that was great craftsmanship I'm so amazed how did that person do that look at the sitting there put them in and you begin to Marvel at the crown jewels Hallelujah and it's the same thing with you and I when the light of the word when the Holy Ghost comes on shines out of our Lives people should stand Yo God stands in all I think the Angels standing or as well look at this achievement goal they were standing there when he said that there'd be sun moon and stars and nebulas formed in universes and you know all all of creation was formed because he believed his own word but then he put a people on free moral agency now Angels know what free moral agency is because they could either listen to God or they could listen to The Devil's lion fall they had a choice they were put on choice too right so now now there's a people upon the Earth who have free moral agency and then God takes them and they give their whole lives over to him and then he cuts and shapes them because they can see the diamond in them and he shines his light through and the angels say what's the most great incredible thing I've ever seen a people have surrendered their will and willingly give their lives out of thankfulness and joy and love and it's not them living no more but God and they see the same one that created all this and they see the workmanship of his hands upon the Earth and they say truly this is great Hallelujah I trust when you look at yourself you will see yourself how God sees you amen he's not ashamed of you amen he's proud of us we are his greatest achievement yeah I mean hallelujah amen and this and that another and be babied I expect my place out yonder I expect my place out yonder with the rugged I expect not to come up there with no trophy scars at all I must fight if I must Reign increase my courage Lord oh let me sound like a Christian not a hybrid plant not to be babied and pitted and brought in something if you're not brought anyhow Christianity you're born into it you become a new creature you're a seed of God that comes into the Earth this is I don't want to have no trophy scars when I'm there soldiers who lived their whole life and fight no Wars have no scars they can have campaign medals or something for doing certain things peacekeeping whatever more but soldiers have really been on the battlefield yeah and it's been life or death and they've been in the front line and they've even looked the enemy in the eyes he gets that close those ones have got trophy scars right now that's just in the negative of War but what about when we March up one day and we have trophy scars of his grace where we went beyond the status quo of Our Lives see those who are in the barracks will never get trophy scars those are gone to the battlefield they actually go beyond just the everyday life they get the trophy scars so what about us well what trophy scars could we have well I've got calluses on my knees from prayer oh my so maybe got lines on my face from from crying and rejoicing you know if I'm actually actually opening up my heart to someone else to really kind of gone to their burden I've got a scarf and being misunderstood maybe yeah right I mean you don't want to have those kind of trophy scars where we could actually look back what happened here well this was a hockey stick but in the you know in the spiritual there's a devil trying to kill my life amen what about this one well he did this but but God got me out of it just like Caleb could have said where'd you give this guy daddy maybe one of his children said that was a whiff in Egypt but I'm not but I'm no longer a slave God delivered me that's why it becomes a trophy scum what about this one oh that was a that was a stab of a sword when I was taking my city but I'm in the city I'm no longer fighting that battle I'm not the victory should be the same thing with your own eye Hallelujah but why does he want to give us trophy scars why do we want trophy scars why do we want to see God live why do we want trophies because one day we'll go up before the throne I'm going to close with this thought we're gonna go up before the throne and he's going to place a crown on our heads which is all of his testimonies that he gave us but then we're going to take it off because who gave it to you and we're going to place it down at his feet Hallelujah where's nothing oh yes I am this no no Lord you earned it in my life that's why he died on Calvary that's why you redeemed me that's why you shed your life you pull your life out so don't we want trophies trophies are testimonies don't you want to lay something at his feet because he's worthy because he's great Hallelujah well how do you get that kind of a crown just live a surrendered life yeah give your whole being to him and he will give them to you but it's going to come a day you look up in his great eyes Hallelujah well done my good and faithful servant amen he said here put this crowd he'll call your name we'll all be gathered we'll hear each other's names and to be shouting and rejoicing praise the Lord hallelujah I was there with them amen hallelujah and then your name's called it's different when other people's names that sacred moment Lord I'm not worthy to advance it to your presence anymore but he'll put that crown on your head you say Lord and he'll fight you just perfectly too yeah but you take it off and say Lord this is your crowd the more crown of king of kings and Lord of lords amen amen maybe a wave like this you have trophy scars in his hands oh God's awesome he won the greatest victory yeah to find you on the Mac and the Maya to cut your buyer's word to set you as a jewel in his crowd isn't he wonderful I mean let's have the musicians this morning now God is awesome Hallelujah it's happening right now you really received the Holy Ghost that's the adoption rope I just need that then I can really overcome no you've got what you need the Holy Ghost comes into your life there you go we'll go on to it another day but you know praise the Lord Hallelujah what's he doing right now he's carrying a stinger of death he's waving in front of us saying look what I've won children my victory still holds I still won the battle the devil's defeated amen I conquered all so you can conquer Heaven behind me and rally Hallelujah fight the battle hey man I want to sing that song my God is awesome I think I put it in there let's just Worship the Lord aren't you glad he found you he was
