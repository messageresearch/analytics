not late perfect timing are we here yeah I listened to a sermon today I actually don't know what is the sermon from brother branham but he he was talking about the green ticket shirt and the 42 inches deer and all this kind of thing so I don't know what is it differently spoke to me sorry was that Spirit of Truth and I was thinking about so well yeah it's it's it's me and Joshua's first time here song leading together we've always been part of the band and I was just thinking wow man what a what a privilege yes for me but what a glorious time that there's a quickening you know we see like last last Wednesday's pre-meeting you know that the children praying having those freedom levity and then and then the sincerity and the deepness that come through that prayer is oh it was almost unexpected for me and then I sat back and said well why is it you must expect this we are living it it's it's not a doctrine that we just you know trying to get into them it's a it's a pure life that we try to live and love and my question that I put to myself and that I'm going to put to you with this quickening that is in the word this quickening that they may prophesy before Jesus come what will you do if your kid comes to you and I take an example from brother Branham he said to this brother that went hunting with him with a green ticket shirt he said you've got a brother with epilepsy and his brother is seven 800k miles away and he said go to him and when he gets another attack ripped the shirt off his back and say in the Lord of you know in the name of the Lord Jesus it will not happen again no I'm just paraphrasing and I thought now if one of my kids come to me with a thus saith the Lord and it's and I'll take an example from us fly to South Africa there's a brother my dad maybe or someone with diabetes with some sort of sickness with something that that needs obedience you know I need to step in faith and do that will we do it to fly to Auckland there's one thing to drive through the next town is another thing but when the squeakin income are we ready for it and I pray that we that we can get to that point in that expectancy in our lives that we know we can we can trust these discernment and the authority and the boldness that's going to be harvested through them and yeah I just want to leave a big I don't want to I don't want to be the preacher Pablito velvet yeah let's stand and sing we gotta start somewhere and I think the little light that we need to shine needs to be a big light there's a lot of darkness around us but I've seen what a little

Year's Eve would just be the watch night service starting at about 8:00 8:30 schema children settled in everything god bless you Demetri welcome great to have this money's here praise the Lord I mean let's go if you've got your Bibles handy let's go to the let's go to Genesis and let's go to chapter 23 if you don't mind we're gonna read the whole chapter this is here Genesis 23 verse 1 it says and Sarah was a hundred and seven and twenty years old these were the years of the life of Sarah and Sarah died and in Kidd Yarborough and the same as Hebron in the land of Canaan and Abraham came to the to mourn for Sarah and to weep for her and Abraham stood up from before his dead and spake unto the sons of Heth saying I'm a stranger and a sojourner with you give me a possession give me a possession a burying-place with you that I might bury my dead out of my sight and the children of Heth answered Abraham and said unto Him hear us my lord thou art a mighty Prince among us and the choice of our simple cos bury thy did none of us shall withhold from the his Sepulchre but that thou mayst bury thy did and Abraham stood up and bowed himself to the people of the land even to the children of here and he communed with them saying if it be your mind that I should bury my dead out of my sight hear me and treat me and treat from me to Ephron the son of Zohar which he hath which is in the end of his field for so much money as is worth he shall give it me for a possession for a bearing place among you and if from dwell among the children of Heth and ephron the hittite answered Abraham and the audience of the children of Heth even to all that went in at the gate of a city saying nay my lord hear me the field which I the field give IV in the cave that is therein I giveth thee in the presence of the sons of my people give I at the berry the idea and Abraham bowed down himself before the people of the land and spake unto Efron in the audience of the people of the land saying but if thou wilt give it I pray thee hear me I will give the money for the field take it of me and I'll bury my dead there and everyone answered Abraham saying unto Him my lord hearken unto me the land is worth four hundred shekels of silver what does that betwixt me and thee bury therefore they did and Abraham Harkin under Efron and Abraham Wade to you from the silver which he had named in the audience of the sons of Heth four hundred shekels of silver current money which with the merchant and the field of Ephron which was mikela which was before memory the field and the cave which was therein and all the trees that run the field and were and all the borders roundabout were made sure and to Abraham for a position and the presence of the children of Heth before all that went in at the gate of a city and after this Abraham buried Sarah his wife and the cave of the field of Machpelah before memory the same as Hebron in the land of Canaan and the field and the cave that is therein was made sure unto Abraham for a possession of a burying-place by the sons of Heth amen may the Lord bless his word you may have your seats like to I trust this is a very familiar scripture to us all you know we are approaching Christmas and Christmas is not tinsel and Santa Claus Christmas is eternal life coming Christmases as a memorial of God gave us eternal life and that life was manifested in his son and there was a purchase that went on where God purchased a burying place for his loved ones for his precious ones now we read here in Genesis 23 where Abraham is a shadow bought a field and he bought a cave and he bought it to bury his beloved wife that had died now notices were as we read there they wanted to give him the field but he would not just just just take it he wanted to buy it and he wanted the boundaries of the field to me to be made sure and he wanted to wanted it to be in such a way that there would be known no dispute I belong this field belongs to me this is its boundaries this is this is how wide it is how long it is you know this is the definite boundaries of the field no one can lay claim against this field or any part of this field no one can say well belongs to me because I've made a public testimony in your eyes this field belongs to me we have to find the boundaries of the field we have to find what is in the in the field and we have also defined what I'm placing in the field now these things are very important because God God has God is in such a way that he doesn't want his enemy to have any claim upon anything that belongs to him he wants to and he has I believe by His grace to find a burying place for his beloved ones and that burying places in Christ Jesus amen let's go to Colossians three and three I believe it is if you don't mind reading a few a few scriptures you have Colossians three and three there that's is here well will read from this just read verse three that's all I want he says for ye are dead so the believers actually did did in crush you died to yourself you're not your natural life shouldn't be alive anymore I mean our natural traits that came down through our family the negative one should be gone amen ye are did this is Paul the Apostle Paul saying ye are dead and your life is hid with Christ in God amen and everyone should be able to say Amen I died one day and I was born again I was birthed than you not just a thought not just a nice feeling but I was literally my nature was changed everything how I looked at things was changed the things I once hated I loved and the things I once loved or hated I now hate it means that now there's a burying-place we are dead in Christ now Abraham as I see it he bought this field and this is the same place now this is in the promised land now the promised land we know to the juice as as Palestine we they are now and but but our promised land our inheritance is in Christ now the prophets were spiritual people I'm sure you can all agree with me they weren't carnal people they didn't want to be buried like Joseph you know you read in the book of Hebrews chapter 11 it says by faith Joseph spake concerning his bones when you are delivered when God says the deliverer to you to take you out of slavery out of Egypt and you gone to the inheritance into the promised land take my bones with me I mean with you don't leave my bones here no doubt he he could have had a very wonderful tomb in Egypt because he saved the whole Empire they meant he had the Heather Spirit of God upon him and he he saved without Joseph they would have gone into that famine and they would have had nothing to eat and and the Empire would have collapsed that that's how implies collapse and fail is a cyclone you go study history so so one man in the hands of God saved the whole place and we know that was you know for a greater purpose than just saving Egypt but he would have had a wonderful tomb they would have honored this man this man kept my dynasty going this man kept my my maybe my father Pharaoh on the throne by the knowledge he had he could had a great tomb but he was a spiritual man he said don't bury me in this place don't leave me down here whatever you do take when when God brings you up and he will take my bones carry them with you amen and take them up to take them up to the promised land and and the believing Jews no doubt when they looked at the sarcophagus or whatever that the bones are placed and they could have seen that as a as a memorial or as a promise God said to our forebears that these bones are not going to stay here they're going to leave and if they're gonna leave we're going to leave the land - and when they carried those bones up Joseph wanted to be buried in the promised land when when his father Jacob died Israel died he wasn't buried in Egypt they they took his body up into the Promised Land and no doubt he could have had a great tomb as workers Joseph was a very wealthy man but there are spiritual people they knew that there was no resurrection in Egypt doesn't matter how wonderful the term was how great the pyramid could be the architecture it could have been one of the seven wonders of the world they didn't want to be buried in a wonder of the world they want to be buried in a place where Israel where resurrection was coming hallelujah and that's why their bones were there and Abraham Abraham was spiritual amen he met the king of you know he was a sojourner it sees he says I'm a stranger among you I'm a sojourner and Paul picks it up he was looking for a city whose builder and maker is God and he was walking upon the ground when that city is going to come hallelujah the New Jerusalem is going to come on that piece of the earth he was walking around looking for the city the builder maker is God is because he met the king of that city and so that's why I believe he buried his wife yeah he bought the field in that place and he buried his wife in that place and Abraham himself was buried in that cave is because in your resurrection was going to be there I mean there's a new hit yeah you know the New Jerusalem was going to sit upon that place here's a spiritual man hallelujah now our promised land as I said it's not a is not a piece of real estate upon the earth amen but our promised land is in Christ Jesus hallelujah and so now I just that you're a believer not because it makes good families not because it answers the question of where did I come from and where I where am I going not just because you know it gives you a peace of passes all understanding and maybe it can you know Abraham was blessed with material things maybe some people they try and be Christians because they get some material blessing you know I trust it it goes beyond that I trust you're a believer beyond all those things and our nice family and nice relationship and yeah I trust it goes beyond that but I trusted the reason you're a believer is because you found a place where there's a resurrection coming amen and you want to be buried in that place I mean you want to be living in that place where there's going to be a resurrection and that's why it's so phenomenal to me amen where there's a people can be upon the earth and God can draw them to a burying place hallelujah and they can be buried in Christ Jesus hallelujah and they have an understanding there's a resurrection coming out of this place I don't want to be buried in the world I don't want to be buried in some church system or some religion someplace I'm going to be buried in the resurrected Jesus Christ all of my life I want to be did in my life hidden God with Christ hallelujah so Abraham made sure the boundary because he had an understanding that the devil it's like Moses Moses died his body was buried in a hidden place somewhere says in Jude Satan was disputing with the Archangel about the body of Moses where is he gone because his dead carcass belongs to me but he was buried from the brave city died on the mountain he had angel pallbearers to pack him away someplace they meant he did and said now that he was disputing where's his body and the Afghan you just said the Lord rebuke thee should we read this let's go to Jude because some of you're looking at me like what is this guy on about let's go to Jude and Jude is only one chapter we just have to start reading cuz I don't know where it is he's here yeah first night I've actually got it underlined he says yet Michael the Archangel disputed about the body of a when contending with the devil he disputed about the body of Moses does not bring against him a railing accusation but he said the Lord rebuke thee they had a contention where's his body it belongs to me it was buried in a secret place hallelujah because it wasn't the devil's property what do you mean it's just this is just flesh yeah but this earth doesn't belong to Satan this world that you live upon doesn't belong to Satan he thinks it belongs to him but it belongs to the children of God Amen it belongs to it belongs to us this earth belongs to you you know it belongs to you you know the you know we're you you've got probably earth this whole earth belongs that are redeemed sons and daughters of of Adam hallelujah this all belongs to us and now so so there's a secret place where we can be buried Alleluia this means the world to me this is what Christmas is all about Christmas isn't about just why did why did Jesus why was any boy why was he born why was he born in a manger what does the Christmas tree about well God was gonna say I'm gonna open up a burying-place where it's not gonna just be a parcel of land in Palestine that's gonna be a place that everyone can come and die in and can remainin and it doesn't matter if they have a they're alive and remain or they die in Christ Alleluia they are they are his purchased possession and there's no dispute of the contents of waters in Christ the devil has no claim just like the children of Heth they had no claim on the case they had no claim of anything within the boundary of that field amen because Abraham made it sure this all belongs to me and he made it sure it's repeated twice in the chapter it was made sure so here's now a lamb of God and he takes out else ends up Calvary that day he pays the price in full he pays the price and full hallelujah Peter he gives a full payment I'm in the devil and you know the great temptation said to Jesus if you just bowed down to me I'll give you all the kingdoms of the world but he wasn't going to receive it without paying for it first because he knew he was going to fall into it anyway hallelujah but he said no you can't give it to me I'm gonna buy it hallelujah I'm gonna buy it in full so it now belongs to me Amen then that's exactly what did it he went up Calvary he redeemed the earth he redeemed all of his children a mere past and present and future hallelujah he paid it in full I mean when the when the Saints of the Old Testament were under the blood of bulls and goats they went into paradise they had to wait because they couldn't have sinned higher because they're under the blood of bulls and goats and the blood of bulls and goats only covers sin they are in a waiting place hallelujah wouldn't we it would have been a glorious time amen cuz it wasn't a place of torment it was called paradise it was a wonderful place and no doubt they had a testimony meeting after testimony meeting and they are waiting when do you think it's going to happen I don't know and then another one comes through the door well it's happening in your age all this happened then another one comes in through the door what happened who are you I'm John the Baptist what did you fulfill I'm the voice of one crying in the wilderness oh why and Isaiah says to prepare the way the Lord yes and I pointed him out and there he is do you think they would have that would have got excited I mean they would have they would have been off their seats hallelujah because the time had come to an end this may be the last Christmas friends they were upon the earth and I say glory hallelujah what do you mean don't you want to grow old and and and see you girls grow up and get married whatever more it would be nice but not rather go to heaven I'd rather just take us off Lord take us all to heaven and then and then so John's there and then Lazarus came he's only there for a brief time where are you I got sick and died what happened well I was friends with this man called Jesus of Nazareth and then John says what he Salema God I and and death and and Lazarus I know I believe it but he didn't come I don't know why he didn't come and then they having fellowship and then he hears his name called he says I'm sorry I'll come back and tell you more later and he comes back into his body hallelujah and in the thief on the cross turns up and he won sing you all who's this great person and he just says I was just a thief and I was hanging on a cross in agony and I looked at the man next to me and he was more than a man I said Lord remember me when you come into your kingdom hallelujah and he and he said today you'll be with me in paradise and Here I am now where is he hallelujah see someone else came through the door then they send it on high glory to God why cuz they're waiting for the deed to be clean they're waiting for all those things that the devil had against them to be struck off hallelujah and they were struck off because it says in Matthew when Jesus arose as many of the Saints arose with him who were they they were the Saint under the blood of bulls and goats I mean waiting waiting for that perfect blood to come amen and the perfect blood came and they rose with him hallelujah amen isn't as one amen and then so now here he comes there's 120 in an upper room because you don't have to literally die for everything to be struck off against you they meant you can be in this body walking around living your same old kind of life you got oh you know you go to school you go to your job you go to the supermarket you do whatever you do and you can be walking along and there can be nothing held against you the devil has no claim on you hallelujah he has no accusation he can bring forth he's got no evidence amen there's nothing he can say against you you can be walking around in the flesh now I trust you're saying he's describing me Amen because there's got to be a people upon the earth hallelujah with a devil the accuser of the Brethren sees in Revelations 12 was cast down I mean so his accusations he can't accuse you before God day and night anymore now there comes a time in heaven and we won't read it be go read revelations 4 and 5 with a saint sir around the throne and John is weeping because he sees a book in the right hand of yo you know of God Almighty and no one's worthy to take the book and loose the seals now there's one person not in that scene the Old Testament Saints are there the angels are there God is there that are redeemed to their because this is thou has redeemed us out of every kindred nation and tongue by thy blood the redeemed are there the lamb is there Satan's not there hello lujah so there comes a time when Satan used to be able to go up before God and accuse you like he did with job and job one but then there comes a time where he's cast down hallelujah and it comes at the time of the taking of the book and we're living in that time where he's taken the book and he's loose he's loose the seals and the Bible the prophets he became a new book to me and he would go and preach things like what drew justification really is and justification that we believe is not like Lusa preached it it's a lot greater yes Amen where we're brother Bram said it's like someone would come before me and say brother Branham I forgive you for smoking and drinking and doing all those bad things you did the other day and he says forgive me but I never did it in the first place I never even did it he says that's what true justification is the just shall live by faith I mean you're justified by faith right true justification is you never did it in the first place hallelujah and now you say well but I was there I was in sin I was doing all kind of bad things but what was really causing you to do it I'm gonna ask this question here we go into maybe we're gonna push out I now hope you ponder on this now the sin nature that you're born with is that really yours new it's not really yours where does it come from it came from Satan I mean by hydrating the human race and the Garden of Eden Amen that brought a fallen a fallen nature into us but it doesn't actually belong to you it's not the real you Amen you may have doesn't matter how many years you live upon the earth until finally Jesus finds you and you surrender your life you give your heart to him amen and you're born again you're really you're actually birthed you're nature's changed your walk in units of life hallelujah amen doesn't matter what that span is it can be if you're young I've heard testimonies of five people at five surrender your life to God my brother Tim proteases he is five years old and he gave us heart to Jesus Christ he says he's never taken it back hallelujah his um his a sister over in Canada I can't I think it's brother Cole Morton's wife I might be wrong she was in a meeting five years old asleep under a Pew God comes down she wakes up she says dad I want to give my life to Jesus and she comes and surrenders their life to Jesus Christ you can never be too young hallelujah it's just whenever God calls say Here I am Lord amen and so now but you see that span of and the attributes of the you know the things you did they don't actually belong to you the other devil likes to hold our Passover us remember this remember this remember this remember this and you've got to really look at him look him in the eye and say Satan do you know why that happened is because you perverted the human race and that fallen nature is yours it's not actually mine it doesn't that never blow it was never my rightful possession amen I trust you could say Amen you say but I did a lot of bad things no but that is that is sin operating in your life sin is unbelief smoking drinking whatever it may be that's just the manifestations that's the attributes of sin but real sin is unbelief in the word Amen but there comes a time when faith comes faith cometh by hearing and hearing the Word of God and something and you says I believe it and it belongs to me and your life is gloriously changed hallelujah and then you come to a point where you recognize that that that person you look in the mirror and say that person is now I don't know who the old guy was that old man is dead hallelujah and I don't want them to come back alive again they've got to recognize that you you actually have a nature change where because faith comes into your heart and you're born again you receive the nature you should have had in the beginning and that's the real you that's who you really are amen hallelujah you know that's right isn't it you know and so that old nature isn't even yours to begin with you say but I was there I saw it happen no that wasn't yours that wasn't you oh I can even say it wasn't really you doing it amen you got to look at it because don't let the devil holds because he accuses you do you think you can go on a rapture do you think you're free from all sin do you think you're perfect and virtuous brighter Jesus Christ you know remember all the things you did those hands that you used to praise God you should do all kinds of things and the mouth that priest him and gives him glory settle different kinds of things and the mind we thought you know the things you think about you know any any holds that against us sometimes quite a lot actually you get over it you have to show Satan I never did it in the first place now let's go back to what the first place where's the first place because it's more than just a nice saying now where is the first place now Joe came towards the end of his great trial and God comes down and speaks to Joe and God speaks out a whirlwind to Joe and he begins to ask ask him where were you when I laid the foundations of the world and the morning stars the sons of God shouted for joy where were you Joe now sometimes people read that in the end they think oh God's trying to make him real little but he's also trying to get to see you're with me amen you were before there was a molecule or anything I saw you Joe I saw you shouting I saw you rejoicing I saw you victorious I saw you overcoming this is what God then but God's thoughts do not change our thoughts change sometimes we can lean a little bit this way about a subject then you things can come and then we lean this way about a subject God doesn't do that God thinks a thought and it's done hallelujah so when he thought of you amen when he thought of you he didn't see you being beaten by the enemy he didn't see you wandering in darkness he didn't see you wondering which way is up and down I meant he saw he's shouting in his presence redeemed overcoming hallelujah washed in his blood sinless maiden as image hallelujah that's what he saw because remember God has a family album and I'm gonna put some photos up not now but maybe watch night cuz I've been thinking about those photos quite look but God has a family album that's called the Lamb's Book of Life and he took a photo of you at your best and your best wasn't when you thought you're in the bloom of youth or whatever it goes beyond that any any and he has a family album and now he's determined that the image he has in the family album you grown to that image you become that image that's what he wants he wants to see because this is the negative that is the positive hallelujah just like our firm was developed all those things and then so now he's determined this negative will become the positive hallelujah aim it so you say what does this got to do with Christmas we have a gift of eternal life God bought us a burying-place hallelujah now I think I have another that's just about don't worry about Joseph your read Hebrews living is by faith Joseph when he died bade mention of the departing of the children of Israel engaged in commandment concerning his bones now I said those spiritual people when we read their Genesis it speaks about how Sarah died in Hebron Hebron was a City of Refuge Christ is our refuge these things that you read about in Genesis is more than stories and the places they are and things happen in those places it's not just I you stay there and you know God is showing us a pattern he's showing us things in that young but I want to somehow emphasize we have a burying-place it's more than being your life is you are dead in your life as head in Christ is the most wonderful thing the most wonderful thing you can ever state of being you could ever be in Alleluia it's more than religion it's more than just a nice feeling or just a doctrine you know when we turn it when we speak about predestination that your destiny is determined it's predetermined by God hallelujah it's more than just a it's more than just a nice phrase you know or more than just a nice idea no God guided our steps God brought us down to this moment hallelujah he brought us here there's a reason he brought us here it wasn't just to see if he could do it there was a purpose and he wanted to express himself to us that we would know him and we would know this burying-place he say cuz if you miss if you miss this place you've missed at all it's the same as as you're gonna receive the Holy Ghost this life has to come into you it's the same thing because by one spirit were baptized into one body amen and so if we miss that we've missed at all but if we've got that we've gained at all that's how vital it is you know jesus said verily verily absolutely absolutely you must be born again and we're born again by the word by the seed in corruptor which is the Word of God now we have some musicians to come I don't want to be too long tonight but as we go as we are in this Christmas season and all the tinsel and all the commercial and all these different kind of things the world has made it don't forget Jesus was born a babe was born in a manger that God would give us a bearing place that he would take his blood life like Abraham did and bury her in a place that in a certain season she'll come forth you know brother Graham talked about when the Saints arose yeah I think Matthew 28 or 27 Sarah and Abraham were walking through the streets of Jerusalem hallelujah they were waiting for it to happen and then they arose because they're buried in the right kind of place and I trust now when when we come you say I want to be buried I want to be buried in him not Anna creed or something man is fashioned but by because he is the word of God only buried in him and he says Peter says very straight he says repent be baptized name of Lord Jesus Christ for the remission of sin and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost if you do this you will be placed in the burying place I think well if that's the way to get in I'm going that way I trust you can say I'm so glad I did whenever God moved on your heart and Here I am in this burying place and I can't get out Sarah couldn't get out of that cave she was dead I know it sounds very ridiculous but she was dead she couldn't get out of the cave and if you're really dead in Christ you can't get out and you don't want to get out I'll stay in this place until the body change hallelujah I'm it I want no this thing I'm so glad I'm Yours Lord so glad I'm yours so glad your mercies have followed me let's dance all we I'm your [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] Hey [Music] a

hidden in you and we thank you Lord we can be in that place it's a living reality and we love you in Jesus Christ's name Amen I mean let's just sing um just as we go they sing wonderful Jesus's to me
