[Music] [Music] [Music] you [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] you [Music] [Applause] [Music] we you [Music] reminder that Friday this put the knee down and the ankle with me came again and wait fee as a man that is breaking out of the sleep and he said unto me what's this now I hold a can full of gold with a bowl upon the top of it and even even fight him and that puts our five the top arrow and two olive trees by it one upon the right start in the fall and the other upon for this by zero I mean at least go to relations behold the Lion of the tribe of Judah the root of David hath prevailed to open the book and to loose the seven seals thereof and I beheld and lo in the midst of the throne and of the four beasts and in the midst of the elders stood a lamb as it had been slain having seven horns and seven eyes which are the seven spirits of God sent forth and to all the earth and he came and he took the book out of the right hand of him that set upon the throne amen and when he had taken the book the four beasts in four and twenty elders fell down before the lamb having every one of them harps and golden vials full of odours which are the prayers of saints and they sang a new song saying thou art worthy to take the book and to open the seals thereof for thou was slain and has redeemed us to God and by thy blood out of every kindred and tongue and people and nation and has made us unto our God kings and priests and we shall reign on the earth and then let's just drop down to verse 13 and every creature that is in heaven and on earth and under the earth and such as are in the sea and all that are in them heard I sang blessing and honor and glory and power be unto him that sitteth upon the throne and unto the lamb forever and ever and the form will be said amen in the four and twenty elders fell down and worshiped him that liveth for ever and ever I mean let's bow our heads and a word of Prayer gracious Lord we've come to magnify your name Lord as we just sang magnify the Lord with me come exalt his name forever Lord we're thankful that we have eternity to exalt your name law for the mighty works you've done there God just pray fathers we just look into your scripture this night Lord may you anoint it to every heart father may you just move them up Lord moving our mitts Lord one more time father may faith rise in every heart dear God my eyes come open to recognize who we are and you and the hour that we're alive and father may you grant it for your glory Lord sort of come at the service and your hands be with those who couldn't be here tonight father be the portion Lord anyone who's streaming in Lord may you be the portion as well father may meet every need Lord we just want to commit our lives into your hands and we thank you for this opportunity Lord and Jesus Christ name Amen I mean god bless your friends you may you may have your seats this night so notice how we were in and Zechariah how he has awakened out of sleep like a man that was waking down and sleeps on them so the angel that was talking with them came again and and he awakened him out of his sleep and and he was awakened to to see what was already around him and we're living in a day now where where God has done many mighty things and he is doing many mighty things but we need to be awakened to what he's doing as as brother Brown would say in in the contest and this is the New Year's Eve message of 1962 he sees Heavenly Father as we stand here as many thoughts is dying out in our hearts and the mistakes of the last year and as we're approaching the death of 62 in the birth of 63 he says Oh God may we be one step higher up the ladder until we see Jesus and his program I mean it's very important that the oh that the Lord would lift us heart that we would see Jesus and his program I mean because it's one thing to see Jesus but you need to see his program you need to see where we are in history and we need to see where we are and the the pages of the book because we know that you know this will be this will be fulfilled but we need to know where we are in order to know where we're going and it's just like a map you can you can have the map say of New Zealand and say you want to drive to Auckland but if you don't know where you're starting from it's gonna be pretty difficult I mean you may drive this way and this way till you find a landmark that eventually but if someone can just tell you hey this is where you this is where you need to go to then you can travel I mean and that's why the speeches messages come that God has announced to us we're not at the beginning of the time of redemption but we're at the end amen and we're not just after the claiming because we know redemption has two parts there's there's a purchase of redemption then there's the claim of that that has been redeemed I mean and we know we're not living in the beginning where where Redemption has been purchased we're not in the first church age we're in the seventh church age we're at the end where now what he has purchased he's come to claim hallelujah so now now when when when John was John was lifted up into the throne room and then finally there came a point where where he was he was weeping you know he saw that seven sealed book was in the hand of the original owner no but no man was seen worthy to take the book and he wept much because he knew that if no one could a man if a man could not stand yo come forth be proven worthy to take that book then all of creation was in jeopardy I mean but then an elder told him don't weak John because the line of the tribe of Judah has prevailed now we know a lion he goes a judge he's come to Brio his wrath is going to be poured out upon the earth but when John looked he didn't see you a lion gonna pour out his wrath gonna judge the world you know pour his wrath out but he saw a lamb hallelujah and I trust when you see him tonight I mean when you look into this message you don't see the line of the tribe of Judah that's gonna pour it as judgments in the tribulation but you see your lamb we know we know he's one of the same believer I trust when you look when you look under Jesus you see a lamb you see your high priests you see the blood I mean you see your advocate I mean you you see your intercessor you see your husband your mediator hallelujah I trust you see him I mean when you look into the message so now in order for a thought we know we're living in the time of of the bride's revival amen yes sir we're living the time of the bride's revival and just like brother Branham would would would relate the story of the Welsh revival and you know there were people from America they date they traveled over to Wales hearing there was a revival and they wanted to see where this revival was and they met a policeman and he's any swinging his baton on the street and maybe worse thing I'm so glad I can say them and they and they can to see good sir can you tell us where this revival with us Welsh revivals on because they're expecting big banners big big building you know a big advertisement and they and then he just said sirs you found it it's in me hallelujah because the policeman was awakened to what God was doing in his day I mean he was having a revival because he was awakened to what God was doing he was no longer a God of history no more but he was a God of the present I mean it's when the Messiah becomes present to you I mean when you your eyes come up and you see him in his program you see him today I mean that's when you have a revival hallelujah and that's what we are enjoying hallelujah I mean we're enjoying the brides revival I mean and where is the revival it's in me I trust it's in you the awakening is in you hallelujah it's not in your neighbor next it's you that have been awakened by the message of the hour hallelujah so Amen now we we understand that you know the next thing that's to happen in God's programmers is the rising of the denser rising of the dead in Christ the translation of the Living bride with them to meet the Lord in the air I mean this this must happen before you know the great trip year before this world goes into the Great Tribulation but before this happens there must be a bride take her position in Christ I mean there must be if people take their take their position heavenly places in Christ Jesus rule the powers of the devil are under their feet and I and I believe in I trust that we are climbing higher every day I mean the people the things we once battled are now under our feet and now we may be facing new battles but that's okay because we're we are victorious we're campaigning on I mean we're conquering Devils as we go hallelujah by the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ but there must be a bride must take her position in this hour now we know from the reading of the scripture that faith cometh by hearing and hearing the Word of God I mean so in order for our eyes to come open amen we need to hear the word it's vital that's why we don't need to hear what the news is say I mean we don't need to hear other voices we need to hear the word for this day and that gives us faith amen and then we know faith is a revelation and with the revelation comes an awakening to a realization of who we are in him I mean we need to know who we are in him hallelujah and that will give you overcoming power hallelujah amen listen you know and so you know you take the woman at the well she was living her life she thought this is how she's gonna be but then she met Messiah she had a revelation we know where Messiah cometh he'll do these things and he just said he that speaks to him he made her her whole life was transformed hallelujah why because she was awakened to what God was doing in her day and she realized she was part of what God was doing I mean not just looking as an onlooker or sitting in the grandstand watching but she realized she was part of the word for her day amen and this brought her to an awakening now brother Branham would say now the bride's revival is tied into the taking of the book amen revelations 5 John types you come to the end of 7 Church ages he hears the same voices spoke to a minister you know and the church ages is the same voices in him and saying come up have their doors open and he's lifted up into the eternity showing that at the end of the church ages amen the bride takes a rapture one man and a vision represents a whole body of believers I mean so his revival was happening not when the book was sealed in the hands the original owner 5 will happen when the lamb stepped forth the one that he leaned on the bosom of him when yo in the days of his flesh the one he saw dying on the cross the one he saw resurrected was now the one who stepped forth to take the book that caused him to have a revival because he was rejoicing saying everything in him and under heaven and the sea everything heard him say blessing and honor and glory be to the Lamb why because he saw his redeemer stepped forth to claim what he purchased hallelujah and that produced a revival in the bride I mean and it's the same thing with you and I trust I mean when you hear the seals I mean when the word comes open I mean I trust you don't just see tribulation and horse riders but you see the land step four you see your redeemer step four to claim you hallelujah I trust that's what you see Amen hallelujah because because what your brother says is like Romeo and Juliet we're a damsel in distress hallelujah we're stuck up in a place and he comes live at night puts his ladder up against the wall takes us away hallelujah that's what's happening in this hour I'm glad amen so you know sir our revival is tied into taking of the book amen hallelujah so our revival is based on present tense what's going on right now when brother Graham preached to sit yeah you're the you know the series of the seven seals in the opening of the word after that that was an event because he said you know you know we read it there in Revelations five I heard the voice of a strong angel proclaiming who's worthy to take the book and you go listen to the breach sir you're a message and he reset scripture it says maybe I'm just feeling this way but let him leave heaven come forth now hallelujah why cuz an event the word is coming open to a people I mean they many of them didn't catch what was going on but it's the same thing with with Israel coming out of Egypt Moses is standing there in the book of Deuteronomy they're been through that wilderness for forty years he says I your eyes weren't open you did not have a heart to perceive what God has done until this day so they were journeying along you know they were with Moses they saw the pull off I come down on Mount Sinai many mighty thinks but Moses says you didn't understand what was going on but now you understand because you're gonna enter into a new land hallelujah and it's the same thing with the message many people didn't catch what was going on I mean but the pillar of fire are still here with the bride and then finally when the son of man ministry is opened and a worldwide body why what happens we're entered into a new land the land of the son of man Jesus Christ and then our eyes have come open now we understand who we are hallelujah now all the church fighting you should be done away with although all the man age anointing should be gone the Eagle anointing has come to take us up into the heavenlies hallelujah amen basically I'm just gonna throw a whole bunch of stuff at you and I trust you going listen I mean you got to see it's listen our national identity does not give us a revival no matter how wonderful this country is it will not give us overcoming power the news cannot give us overcoming power Facebook doesn't give us overcoming power Instagram won't give us overcoming power none of those things will help us overcome this present world only this word will give us overcoming power I want to overcome I don't want to be the devil's punching bag I want him to be my punching bag hallelujah that's what we're all dating opinion amen hallelujah so you know we need to delve into things hallelujah so now the taking of the book as I see it you want to have a revival get into the word prayerfully and God will open things to you and you'll see yourself very differently to how you started I mean say Lord minister to my heart it's not trying to put it all together this is not a homework you know this is not a school you know homework exercise it's Lord ministered to me show me who I am I mean because John's identity was tied up with the book palookas he knew if that book wasn't taken he was stuck hallelujah but when he saw the lamb step forth he rejoiced because he knew now though that the plan of redemption was going to wind up hallelujah so what John wasn't cymbal has to become reality we saw the horse riders they became reality I mean the tribulation is going to become reality so John taking the book I mean John sing the book taken that revival has to strike the earth and I believe it has amen and then John been given the open book of revelations 10 taking becoming one with that word and prophesying it forth we are living in Revelations 10 8 to 11 amen you got to see your position in the word Amen oh yeah now whether MCS in the and the breach message he says notice he's not an animal he took the book out of the right hand of him that sat up on the throne you know this message has had just to get us things that's so glorious isn't it wonderful isn't it great how Redemption how wonderful redemption is a man when you see him he's not a God of history he's a God of the present and he came to become one with you came to redeem you come to open your eyes to who you are I mean because the opening of the book maybe I'll just jump right to the end of my sermon that I'll do a backtrack and come back to it again but the book represents you amen you're part of that book of redemption now when the seals were loosed off the book the contents of it became manifested epic it was him it was sealed up but then it came open so what was hidden became manifested now it's the same thing with you and you hallelujah was a brother bad calls at a scene g'd of God placed in your soul but it was laying dormant just like a natural sea can be laying dormant just like now it's well it I think winters finally turned up you know hopefully it doesn't stay around too long we'll get spring at the right time but you know this seeds of the laying in the earth and they can be laying in there until finally the right atmosphere comes weather where the Sun moves a bit you know the earth moves a bit closer to the Sun you know you're our part of it you're the soil temperature gets warm enough there's a right and a right amount of moisture and sunlight then finally that seed that we're sitting there comes to life and what was locked up in the seat now comes forth holy it can be a mighty oak tree or it can be whatever it is but what's in it will come forth hallelujah so so what was sealed up and it comes out and it's the same thing with you and I there's a life sealed up in us there's a mystery that had to be manifested I mean there was laying in our souls but it took the right conditions and it wasn't denomination or the world that was the conditions those are frosty freezing places a man needed to be a right kind of place hallelujah that's when this word came change the atmosphere around you increased your faith hallelujah you didn't know what was in you you know I was thinking of Rahab we have had that scarlet cord the whole time the spies didn't give it to her they didn't say oh we brought the scarlet cord as a true token you have it no she said oh this is in my house and this thing that was laying dormant in her house I don't know how long just like this like the scene in you laying dormant they finally faith cometh by hearing and hearing the Word of God and then finally something this was dormant is now very powerful hallelujah now has has eternal life in it hallelujah and then stir the thing that was in her house I don't know what kind of didn't even know what she had but the two messages had to go see awaken her faith in what was in who could be manifested then her family come and receive eternal life well it's happening deals a mystery sealed up and Rahab she was never meant to be Rahab the harlot when God thought of her that wasn't her in state I mean her in state was to be married to Salman of Judah and coming to the lineage of Jesus Christ that's how God thought of her I mean but that was locked up in her hallelujah amen Israel had to come her way her whole life had to her old life had to be destroyed hallelujah I mean why I was locked up in her you take Joshua you think about Joshua he's a slave in Egypt that he could he fed them one day you know you need go to him whatever he was a stonemason waiver Joshua you know you're gonna stand in the promised land you've just heard about you'll tell the Sun and the moon to stand still amen the Lord will come as a captain of the host with a sword drawn you gotta conquer you gonna be the grace general that ever lived and maybe you think really yo maybe there'd be some doubt I don't know too good to be true it was in him it was in him but I had to come unlock there's a mystery sealed up it had to be manifested you can go through all the way down through the Bible you can take that whole same thought to every character through the scripture David's a shepherd boy you know you're gonna be the king he didn't become king by the anointing of Samuel the anointing just activated the kingship in him amen so then he become king because the anointing it was a recognition God was testifying of his gift hallelujah has the same thing with you and I that's why this word we have indicated prophet in this day I mean and he poured out the whole Word of God the whole anointing was poured out Samuel didn't just drizzle a bit on David the whole anointing horner Vernonia was poured out upon him hallelujah because he had to become king as the same thing we're defending our prophet pour out an anointing upon the sage hallelujah and the Brides coming to her place are full of virgins going to her place the Beast is coming to his place Holly why cause the anointing hallelujah aiming it was already in him just like the bride is already in you to be the bride is already in you the scripture says that we are predestinated and to the adoption of sons I mean we're not predestinated unto just becoming saved and maybe we'll get you know we've previously and to the adoption or the placing of sons hallelujah that means that if you're a if you're a pre decide to be adopted into the body of Christ you're going to get there he will get you there hallelujah Amen if I lean too much on God doing the work I'm sorry I just I just happened to be there way you just got to yield to him your toes were so what you preach says that in Ephesians we're pretty say unto the adoption of sons and the fullness the adoption is the body change Oh Lou young amen so notice he's not an animal we'll come back here he took the book out of the right hand of him that sat upon the throne who was it the owner the original owner had that had the book of redemption in his right hand and no angel no angelic being nothing less could take the place and it was this bloody Lamb walked out and took the book out of his hand what was it brother this is the most sublime thing in the scripture amen the most sublime thing in the scripture and act that not an angel not nothing could do it the Lamb come per me and took it from the right hand of him that sat upon the throne what is it now it belongs to the lamb amen God's law required it he's the one that holds it God's law required a kinsman redeemer and the lamb came out holding it I am their kinsman I am their Redeemer I have made intercession for them and now I've come to claim their rights for them amen there's the only one I've come to claim their rights and that they have a right to everything that was lost in the fall and I have paid the price oh brother don't that make you feel religious inside Amen not by good works which we have done but by His mercy oh wait a minute and them elders and everything else we're going to throw off crowds and dignitaries begin to get on the ground see no one no one could do it and he walks right up to the right hand of God and took the book out of his hand and claimed his rights I have died for them I met kinsman-redeemer I am the mediator my blood was shed I've become I have become man and I did this in order to get that church back again the one I foresaw before the foundation of the world I have purchased it I spoke it it would be there and nobody was able to take it but I went down and done it myself I am their kinsman I became kinfolks and he takes the book amen oh who was waiting there for me tonight who is that one church that's waiting there what else could wait there for you that kinsman redeemer oh my what a sublime statement or act hallelujah now he has the title deed to redemption he has it in his hand mediation is done now he has it in his hand remember it's been in the hand of God all the time but now it's in the hand of the Lamb now watch the title deed of redemption of all creation is in his hand and he comes to claim it back to for the human race not to claim it back to angels claimed it back to the human which was which it was given for it to make sons and daughters of God again bringing them back to the Garden of Eden everything they lost the whole creation the trees the animal life everything else oh my he says don't you don't that make you feel good hallelujah now when brother Brahim speaks about the lamb taking the book he he parallels it with Boaz claiming roof that's why I say you you the book represents you hallelujah so guys from justice abstract thing too now very real thing haloo so he says now notice that kinsman redeemer the kinsman and the kinsman redeemer must be born of the human race there that leaves us on a limb but let me sound a trumpet to you the virgin birth produced a product amen the virgin birth produced our kinsman redeemer none other but Almighty God became Emmanuel one of us Emmanuel the kinsman redeemer was met you see how God makes a requirement and there is nothing we can do but then grace the upset and overshadows that law and produces the product amen oh when we get over home when I get my little cabin down there that brother Neville's things about when you all hear singing down there one morning singing Amazing Grace how sweet the sound that saved a wretch like me he said praise God oh brother brother made it there he is yes oh it's a mate it's grace that taught my heart to fear was grace my fears relieved how precious did that grace appear the hour I first believed I mean here a few a few notes being flattened over there that'll be my job hallelujah wait till we get down to it just in a moment he says the Book of Ruth gives a beautiful picture of this how Boaz and noemy had lost the estate you know youyou heard me preach I haven't you raise up your hands if you've heard me preach you understand Boaz had to become a redeemer and he was the only one they could he had to be a kinsman near kinsman and and in Redoute redeeming Yomi he got Ruth and that was Jesus Boaz typing Christ and when he redeemed Israel he got the Gentile bride hallelujah see see so he ties the taking of the book to Boaz claiming Ruth that Gentile bride now in Ruth Ruth is sealed up of mystery as well I'm coming back around a few times go I want you to catch this and Ruth her life was there because there's a there's a change of dispensation happening in Israel they're going from judges to Kings Amen judges to Kings and God puts a Gentile bride in that change of dispensation and it's the same thing with us so God was changing form through a Gentile bride it's the same thing now if God goes brother Branham says to the changes in your son of God and then he son of David in the Millennium but in between Tommy's son of man I mean so now God calls a Gentile bride and that change of dispensation why because he's going to be son of David in the Millennium on the throne but he has to go from son of God to son of man to son of David but he has to use a veil to change his dispensation hey you're following me I mean just like he had to use you know just open the church first came in here was God above us then he had to use a veil to be God with us then God in us hallelujah there's a change in dispensation from judges to Kings as a Gentile bride has come and to change it dispensation I mean God was veiled hallelujah just like yesterday but now he was roost so and who was this she was to be the grandmother of kings she didn't know it imagine going to my web hey Rick how are you I'm good everything's going fine you know you're gonna move to Israel one day this guy you made with is going to die this first husband this first nature is going to die he can be married to another what do you mean no this is me this is where I'm from this is who I am and you could say now this is not who you are you think this is who you think you are but this is not who you are hey sure this is where I was born I can show you my parents I can't you know you're looking through the wrong eyes father you say you're gonna look through the eyes of prophecy hallelujah because in her was to be no one else could marry boys to bring forth Oviatt and Jesse and David no one else could do she had to be the one hallelujah there are many to the natural I think there many other people who would qualify a lot better but no it was her hallelujah and God allowed her to go through what she did amen God allowed God caused her to do it hallelujah why to bring forth Oh be to be married to Boies she didn't know that was sealed up in her but then now just like when the lamb took the book opened the seals showed the contents of the book what was really in it same thing with when women boaz took ruth i'm going to show you what's in her hallelujah whoo she's really meant to be amen that's why we're gonna you know otherwise fix that spiritual amnesia how you breaks Brittany Jie go to go to familiar places one way to get special Abney jie is to be between two opinions he says to be you can be between two opinions shall I serve God sure not so if God as God writers not writers the message writer is it wrong are these people writer these feel wrong what's happening to opinions my friends say this but what about this what you're between two opinions you begin to get spiritual amnesia you begin to forget who you are I mean that's why you've got to forget those things and fine go walk to through familiar places parlor that's where you're going to do if you want to keep your identity in this hour I mean because what is what is the biggest focus in this world today identity identity politics I mean and it's such a big thing identity even once her own identity in their own nation all those things some of it's fine but it's all identity white because it's the age of the people's rights what about the bride's rights what about the Lambs rights what about the bride's identity amen what about what about our identity polio whose I who you really identifying with identify with this amen you got a you know who you know what's your flag what's your anthem hallelujah what's your national dish hallelujah glory to God you know because it's all about national identity you have to know where you're from because the devil doesn't want you to know who you are imagine if you know why did Saul fail because of because he leaned too much on well I'm from the smallest tribe the smallest family the smallest tribe in Israel and here and he tried to please people these complexes pushing him around but David wasn't that way David was anointed by the same prophet I mean he knew he was going to be king and he leaned upon my identity is upon that in that anointing hallelujah my identities in the prophecy I'm going to become king hallelujah amen so we need to look at the same we need to be the same way Lord this is a bridegroom call this message is a bridegroom call it's not a list out of different church and be a bit different kind of call no it's a bridegroom calls it's a marriage call that's what it is to call a bride for Jesus Christ that's why the message came I mean so if it decrypt your soul I know I well apparently it's bad to repeat yourself but you know you know I probably say it a lot but why did this message find you if it's a bridegroom call and it found you it's because you are the bride amen and the and the foolish virgin doesn't care about her position in Christ but the wise virgin wants her position I mean you you know I I don't know the scripture of top of my head but you go to the Book of Numbers there's five daughters they're dead don't have any brothers their dad died in the wilderness because of his own sin and at that point her daughters couldn't get a position in the promised land and they come to Moses say Moses our father died we didn't have brothers but we want a physician at the moment we can't because the law says we can't but we want a position and Moses goes ask God and God says they've seen a good thing they've asked a good thing so here was the wise virgin saying we want our inheritance in the land hallelujah the law says we can't but Grace will give it to us hallelujah I mean so it should be the same thing with you and I I don't just want to be going with the crowd I want my inheritance in Christ I want what belongs to me I want what's in the book for me hallelujah that's the wise the foolish doesn't care I don't want to be foolish I want to be wise I want to take my god-given prey place hallelujah amen you know you know if people you know if anyone comes to God with that kind of heart lord I want what you died for I want to receive what you died for do you think he's going to turn that kind of heart away no he's gonna say oh I'm looking for people like that Carl ouya I'm looking for people that want their inheritance their position and me hallelujah amen so Ruth Ruth and who was to be the grandmother of Kings to bring about a dispensational change in Israel and here we are the church ages of coming to an end we've been lifted up out of this world you know we should have different thinking to this world I mean we should have totally different thinking if because we understand the church here the world is still in lady ousia increase with goods rich increased with goods have need of nothing they can do it all themselves and look where it's headed you know but we are called out of it I mean we we are being called in what program calls into a bride age I mean because lady I see a rejected Christ the word so now he's got to find a place where he can still work Redemption and prevent calls on a bride age hallelujah and in that bride age now we've received an eagle anointing I mean where well what does that mean an eagle can fly the the first three anointing was the was the lion the ox and the man anointing all earthbound creatures but the eagle was the only one that could fly up and see a mean so well well how does that work in your life you should be able to look above just just what you see around you you should be lifted up above just what you see with your five senses and what your mind can reason amen you should be able to see beyond that's how it works it's more than just you know knowing how the message goes together that's that's really not it SQL to discern and withstand the Antichrist birth and the only way you can do it is with that eagle anointing that Holy Spirit eagle anointing how Lou you that's what we should have we should be able to see oh there's the devil there's the devil there's a devil amidst chili bowser and he'll could you know and you can see further than that you know anything else it's not earthbound amen that's how we should be amen so we shouldn't be looking you know you take Saul and David David was still I mean Saul was the man age and it came to a where he was judged the kingdom was taken from him and he his Armour was brass which is divine judgment p'lice armor was divided it was was brass as well they received the same kind of judgment that system came to an end and God had a little shepherd boy that was going to go beyond house all thought and house all the things and he was going to actually take the throne and take the whole land why was happening that going for a man age to an Eagle age and that's how it was that's how it was in Christendom there was all these big ministries around hidden shoulders above the rest the man of the hour with power those those time have come to an end amen we're not under that kind of does the man age man's ideas man's words of Pentecost was the last move of the Reformation amen now we know God just adds he doesn't take away so we have everything the Reformation had but now we're transformed hallelujah so so so David comes along and and Saul tries to put this brass armor please read the story it's brass yeah so so Saul tries to take his judgment and say fight with this thing and David said no this won't work this ecclesiastical vswir and freedom why because God actually I said no man's wisdom doesn't work man's Bible school system doesn't work man seminary symmetry doesn't work it's not going to defeat the giant right so see I can't wear this it doesn't work so he just went with what he had hallelujah and it didn't look like much but it's all he needed hallelujah and it's the same thing with us that's why we don't lean on the understanding of man amen it's not about get a general consensus and then we'll walk on with that notes an individual walk with God I mean David knew he was anointed and he was going to be king that's why he knew why he was anointed you've got to know why you're anointed why this word has anointed you why is it anointed you because there is a place and then Jesus throne that you will sit to he that overcometh in this age you will sit with me and my throne as I've set with my father in his throne hallelujah that's why you've got a Rick guys why has this word come to me because I'm the Bride of Christ and I have a Dominion I'm going to sit in as as a ruler joint heir with Jesus Christ amen we're not just here just have wonderful time go out forget who we are how Lou you know we've got a you to look at where are we going where are you going in your Christian walk what's the end goal this is going to be changed why because I've received an anointing that will change my body hallelujah I've got it in me amen and just like thee just like the seals were taken off the book to reveal the contents of it and I'd say the seals would take it off Ruth's life you know to Moabite with nothing just gleaning in the field striking along not even in the economy of Israel no you want me to be part of the lineage of Jesus Christ hallelujah because her place remember her place in God's Word was not to be a widow there's no one here does there's no you know to be a widow you don't have any part of the land that's yours you don't have any inheritance right but God ordained that she wouldn't stay that way but that she would become married to boas did now basically him belongs to her I mean so so God moved her that she would receive her position in the land hallelujah that was the mystery know she was me tree part of missing him hallelujah and it's the same thing with us we're we're all dating to be part of this word Amy it's not by what we think we ask what God has ordained us to be that's all that matters hallelujah you take Rahab Rahab's living under a death sentence a mystery son whom hallelujah she and Salman found a bitly him hallelujah Amen but they had to come open Jericho's the land was sealed up because Jericho was there once Jericho was taking the land was open up for his role to go in and conquer hallelujah it's the same thing the book came over the whole land the son of man came open Rahab was living there right there I mean but God ordained that she would actually receive inheritance in the promised land hallelujah I mean why don't you receive the spies because she had to have had a place in the land and that place was given her in the land because she'll be united with Salman hallelujah amen as it says in Romans 7 no you're not brethren for I speak to them that know the law how that the law hath dominion over a man as long as he liveth for the woman which hath her husband is bound by the law to her husband as long as he liveth but if the husband be dead she is loosed from the law of her husband so then while her husband liveth she be married to another man she shall be called an adulteress but if her husband be dead she is free from that law so that she is no adulteress though she be married to another man wherefore my brethren ye also are become dead to the law by the body of Christ that you should be married to another even to him who's raised from the dead that you II should bring forth fruit unto God hallelujah why could ruse be United two boys because the first husband was dead hallelujah amen that's like our our our union with the world a man was killed hallelujah Christ killed it I mean that we could be united to him hallelujah amen so it's what need to think about these things why are we here why is you know why are we why are we rising in the character of Christ while we're becoming more like him because he has ordained us to end up in a certain place predestination means your destiny is predetermined amen you have but you have to have confidence and where God wants to take you I mean David then didn't worry about what people were doing like Saul was he was anointed because and he knew that anointing would take him to the kingship cuz and him was to be the king he had confidence in that how about you I mean I'm just gonna read a psalm and then we're gonna quit Sam 57 I believe it is I believe it this I've been having a good time in the Sam's it's so wonderful 1:56 oh he says be merciful to me O God for man would swallow me up he fighting daily oppresses me my enemies would daily swallow me up for they be many that fight against me o thou most high what time I am afraid I'll trust in thee and God I will praise His Word and God I will put my trust I will not fear what flesh can do unto me every day they rest my words all their thoughts are against me for evil they gather themselves together they hide themselves they mock my steps when they wait for my soul what shall they escape by a iniquity and mine anger cast down the people Oh God now tell us my wanderings put there are my tears in thy bottle are they not in my book when I cry and to thee then shall my enemies turn back this I know for God is for me and God will I praise His Word in the Lord will I praise His Word and God have I put my trust I will not be afraid what man can do unto me though vows are unto me o God I'll render praises unto thee for thou has delivered my soul from death will not thou be will will not thou deliver my feet from falling that I may walk before God in the light of the Living hallelujah what does he say I will not feel what flesh can do unto me he says thy vows are upon me O God verse 12 what is this Val you gonna be king you're gonna be king hello lujah amen what does his vow upon you you going in a rapture amen your bodies are going to be changed you're gonna submit with sit with me in my throne as I've sat down with my father in his throne hallelujah so David was trusting Lord you've given me a promise doesn't matter what the enemy is doing you've given me a promise I'm walking according to that promise to that Val now how about you if a man under the butter bulls and goats can do that how about you he said well he was fighting all natural we fighting spiritual enemies that may be so but we can still overcome if David can do it I can do it if Joshua can do it I can do it if Rahab can do it I can do it if Caleb can do it I can do it if Elijah can do it I can do it if Elijah can do it I can do it if Hanna can do it I can do it I mean if Ruth can do it I can do it if Moses can do it I can do it hallelujah hallelujah I mean if David can do it I can do it Athena can do it I can do it a fool can do it I can do it hallelujah if the woman the wife can do it I can do it hallelujah if bleed you can do it I can do it hallelujah I mean a brother Bram can do it I can do it hello if all the Saints through the agents did it I can do it was the same God was with them as with me Holly if he promised them and they made it to their previous safe place I will turn work is the same God that promised them promise me so I will not fear what the enemy can do unto me I because his vows are upon me Oh God Holly and I will render praise unto thee hallelujah so I think we can just rejoice and we say thank you Lord how long I've seen you take the book maybe that day so the lamb step forth hallelujah for me hallelujah I've wrestled I've overcome I see my blood upon the earth now I've come to claim what I purchased hallelujah that's why this message came your way why it's a claiming message I mean to claim you claim your soul Holly doesn't matter what the devil does to you I mean the devil has a right to fight us in our minds it doesn't make us not safe I mean here's a right to fight us in our bodies it doesn't make us not safe he can't get our soul I mean he gotta get the part of us that belongs to God I mean sit don't worry about the mind battles don't let it try and drop you a free you on hallelujah he will fight you but you will overcome I mean you've just got to recognize God that's not you talking to me that doesn't make me you don't make me tossed about you don't make me down and depressed God would never do that to his children hallelujah you were to recognize who that is God doesn't God doesn't tell you to be order against your brother and sister that's not God's thoughts I mean you got to recognize your enemy he's very diligent you've got to recognize them but our God is greater Alleluia God knows what we
