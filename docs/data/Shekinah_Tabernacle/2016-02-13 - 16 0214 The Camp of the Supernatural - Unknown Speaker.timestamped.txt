[0:00] i wish the lord would just bring it back
[0:02] um and my mom was standing up amen with
[0:05] her hands in there
[0:06] and for yay for her it's hard
[0:09] but she defied gravity amen she made a
[0:12] choice
[0:12] and all the devils around her had to
[0:14] flee well she stood up and said but i
[0:16] don't want this anymore
[0:18] and she's here
[0:22] and nothing we said or done on that camp
[0:24] could have changed it god had to come
[0:26] down god had to do the work amen and
[0:29] that's what broke everything on that
[0:31] campus we didn't do anything there
[0:33] we were in opposition we were walking we
[0:36] were praising the lord focusing on him
[0:38] but he had to come and do it yeah and
[0:40] that's saturday night with our sunday
[0:42] night when we were praising and
[0:43] worshipping
[0:44] that was a big night for us guys that
[0:46] was where the lord said i'm pleased with
[0:48] you he doesn't come in and visit if he's
[0:50] not pleased amen and because we were
[0:52] able i mean you we were jumping around
[0:55] for joy and i was sitting there and i
[0:57] thought like we could walk into eternity
[0:59] right now we can seriously walk because
[1:01] there's nothing holding us back
[1:03] but we should keep that walk because
[1:05] just the next week when we get back then
[1:07] satan comes back oh yeah but are you
[1:09] good enough are you sure that is going
[1:10] to hold you is this is this the next
[1:13] battle push on
[1:14] let's just push on hey man like john
[1:17] shared brother and i i appreciate it you
[1:19] know mine was also my temperament and
[1:22] and i don't think sometimes when i say
[1:24] stuff and then lord brings it back and
[1:25] says shut up
[1:27] this is not don't say anything if you
[1:28] don't say anything good just keep quiet
[1:31] focus on me and walk on amen because
[1:34] you're going to rob someone else from a
[1:35] blessing because your attitude is bad
[1:38] and so i listened to the adoption series
[1:39] yesterday when i was driving up to
[1:41] kapiti and it's exactly the same there
[1:43] was one in the cab
[1:45] one in the camp that took the i think it
[1:47] was a a bracelet
[1:49] and and and 13 people died or 16 people
[1:52] had to die yeah because of one man yeah
[1:55] and i said lord i don't want to be that
[1:57] man yeah so i'll turn my face back to
[1:59] you and i say forgive me for my secret
[2:01] faults i'll walk on
[2:03] i'll just walk on
[2:04] and and i just pray that that would be
[2:06] attitude this year just amen everything
[2:08] that that tries to derail you just walk
[2:10] through it amen just walk through it
[2:12] it's not easy but just keep on walking
[2:14] man because it can it can rob someone
[2:17] from a blessing
[2:19] and you know what we were that we and we
[2:21] all were a blessing to everyone because
[2:23] our attitude was fixed on god thank you
[2:25] so praise the lord for that weekend he
[2:27] changed my life my whole outlook my life
[2:29] changed this weekend and then he takes
[2:31] you through a trial the next week just
[2:32] to say yeah
[2:35] i taught you something this weekend i'm
[2:36] forgetting already
[2:38] and then you say sorry god and you just
[2:39] walk on yeah
[2:40] so yeah just praise the lord i think we
[2:43] can give the lord
[2:50] so
[3:04] okay so we all know the captain of the
[3:05] host is
[3:07] right
[3:08] one thing i was very thankful on the
[3:10] camp that i realized is that physically
[3:12] we were not in the army or we didn't
[3:14] have to do any service here because if
[3:17] that guy at the back was my sergeant
[3:19] major
[3:21] when he when he got up it was a saturday
[3:23] morning that you that you brought the
[3:24] word i just thought i would not go
[3:26] around a mountain over a mountain i'll
[3:28] just go through it if he was my leader
[3:30] if he was my peloton
[3:32] i i just felt so motivated and so
[3:35] spirited about that and i and i just sat
[3:38] back and said oh okay well we are
[3:39] actually in an army thank goodness it's
[3:41] a spiritual one yeah because we've got
[3:43] the captain and we've got our
[3:46] so i will still go through a mountain
[3:48] for him and i realized that that um
[3:53] they they had a as a family they had bad
[3:55] sleep and it was you know obviously it
[3:57] was the camp and the and all the
[3:59] organization and and the arrangements
[4:01] and everything yet he was there he was
[4:04] there first up in the morning he was
[4:05] looking after everyone and he just put
[4:07] himself lost and
[4:09] yeah what example i just i want to
[4:11] glorify god that he brought us a leader
[4:15] like this
[4:16] so balanced and so full of love and that
[4:20] just completed the whole
[4:22] the whole weekend for me that everything
[4:24] is for love and and for the love of god
[4:26] and that he loves us as well
[4:36] this is a this is a um testimony
[4:40] i just want to say it because sometimes
[4:41] when you confess it then the lord acts
[4:43] on that
[4:44] and um
[4:46] it's
[4:47] about what i got from the camp
[4:49] um
[4:51] and
[4:52] those of us that have been doing this
[4:54] for a little while you know
[4:55] when you get on a bit you just enjoy
[4:57] serving the brethren and seeing other
[4:58] people get a blessing and that's
[5:02] you know people like brother ben and
[5:03] brother andy and different ones you know
[5:05] that
[5:06] i can guarantee they actually get more
[5:08] of a blessing out of seeing everyone
[5:10] else blessed and about them being
[5:11] blessed themselves because look
[5:14] we've all had our turn we've we've been
[5:15] blessed now we we just enjoy serving and
[5:19] seeing god do things in people's lives
[5:21] and seeing people move on that's what
[5:22] that's what we enjoy and i know that's
[5:24] that's what you're talking about about
[5:26] brother ben you know that's and that's
[5:27] the way that a christian is you know you
[5:29] you get helped along for a while then
[5:31] you then it's your turn you help um but
[5:33] nonetheless
[5:35] every now and then god just does
[5:36] something
[5:37] for those that maybe you know he just
[5:40] that's why he said the i should not
[5:41] muzzle the mouth of the ox that treads
[5:43] out the corn
[5:44] you know if he's hungry you'll limit her
[5:46] some tea
[5:48] and and
[5:49] um this is this is my little testimony
[5:51] about what the lord gave to me on this
[5:53] camp
[5:54] it's only a small thing but it meant a
[5:55] lot to me and um brother
[5:59] um
[6:00] i had a few comments brother amand
[6:03] said he saw me one night and
[6:04] said oh you couldn't really play the
[6:05] instrument something that happened to
[6:07] you you know and he jokingly said to me
[6:08] oh lord
[6:10] that's what he said that well that's
[6:11] what's happening oh lord let me have
[6:13] what he's having amen
[6:15] well
[6:15] but don't say amen yet because it
[6:19] and and sister already mentioned the
[6:20] same thing and
[6:22] i just want to share with you a little
[6:23] bit about about that and it was special
[6:25] to me
[6:26] um
[6:28] i've been fighting a very hard battle
[6:29] for about eight years
[6:32] and it's it's it is what it is
[6:35] but i've just been battling this thing
[6:38] day after day
[6:39] week after week month after month year
[6:41] after year
[6:44] it's all right but you just gotta keep
[6:46] going just battle battle battle
[6:48] and some of the brothers here have been
[6:50] kind of involved in that too
[6:52] that
[6:54] that that battle it doesn't matter what
[6:56] it is but it's just been a it's been a
[6:57] battle that you can't just sort of walk
[6:59] away from it's just always been there
[7:00] battling away and about a
[7:04] maybe a month ago
[7:06] the lord started giving me scriptures
[7:07] about um
[7:10] david all his life he battled and he was
[7:12] having to fight all the time he was a
[7:14] man of war
[7:16] and then he wanted to do something for
[7:17] the lord he wanted to build a temple for
[7:19] the lord
[7:20] but the lord said to him look you're a
[7:22] man of war you've said too much
[7:24] innocent blood or not innocent blood but
[7:25] you've just shed a lot of blood
[7:27] you're not going to do it but your son
[7:28] is going to build the temple for the
[7:30] lord
[7:31] so david's life was was all battle and
[7:33] war
[7:34] but then there came a time when
[7:36] solomon came on that god gave rest and
[7:39] peace
[7:41] and there was rest in the land and then
[7:42] solomon could go about and just work
[7:44] this work of the lord because he didn't
[7:45] have to go out and spend all his effort
[7:47] fighting enemies and spend all his money
[7:50] building up armies to defend himself he
[7:52] could actually then channel that into
[7:54] the work of the lord that he wanted to
[7:55] do it just the law began to show me
[7:56] these sorts of things
[7:58] because you all know what
[8:00] what we are sort of trying to do for the
[8:01] lord
[8:02] and it feels like for so long it's just
[8:04] been a battle fight fight fight fight
[8:05] fight
[8:07] and as the lord was showing me that i
[8:08] don't know if you remember the sermons
[8:09] brother ben was preaching we're all
[8:10] about rest you know come and i'll give
[8:13] you rest come in all year that labour
[8:14] and heavily and i'll give you rest they
[8:16] were all about that time that they were
[8:17] coming in and and they were channeled
[8:20] another way but i know the lord was
[8:21] speaking that to me that i'm going to
[8:22] give you rest from all these battles and
[8:24] all these wars and it meant a lot and
[8:27] then
[8:28] you know you go through the camp and you
[8:29] just you just help out do what you can
[8:32] and it's you get a blessing but
[8:34] sometimes god just comes down and speaks
[8:36] to you something
[8:38] and and
[8:39] that's what happened as i was playing up
[8:41] there it's like god just sort of opens
[8:42] up a little small window for a minute or
[8:44] two and he just sort of speaks something
[8:45] to you
[8:46] and and he just said i'm going to give
[8:48] you rest in peace from this whole battle
[8:51] you've been fighting for
[8:53] a long long time i'm gonna i'm gonna
[8:55] give you peace with that amen
[8:59] you know when you're playing the music
[9:00] and when you're doing things sometimes
[9:01] you've got to then it's like a little
[9:03] baby you're trying to enjoy something
[9:04] and then it gets
[9:06] upset or whatever you've got to go off
[9:08] what you're thinking and tend to it so
[9:10] it was like that with the music i had to
[9:12] change songs or something so to go back
[9:14] to
[9:15] my mind off that and back to where we
[9:16] were and that sort of thing
[9:17] and then when we got to the next song i
[9:19] thought oh lord you can i'd like to
[9:20] actually hear that again i enjoyed that
[9:23] but he didn't tell me again but i just
[9:25] maybe this was me maybe it was god but
[9:27] he's i just felt him say you know what
[9:28] i'll tell you a game by bringing it to
[9:30] pass
[9:32] so that's just the testimony that i've
[9:33] got that the law is going to give peace
[9:56] but actually his first time came for me
[9:59] in my life
[10:00] but god is so good
[10:03] i meant
[10:07] because i can still create the emboss
[10:10] pier
[10:11] my home
[10:13] and my workplace
[10:16] so many times actually i watch the
[10:19] youtube for something else rather than
[10:21] what you've got
[10:23] but i can see after camp i'm not
[10:25] interesting anymore
[10:30] close the load
[10:32] more and more
[10:35] i can deal with my husband a while
[10:37] whatever situation he pulled to me i'm
[10:40] so happy so glad food in the road
[10:45] and the other thing is my workplace i'm
[10:47] so
[10:48] i kind of task a person so if
[10:50] my stuff has ever done their task i'm so
[10:53] frustrated
[10:54] and i usually tell them directly but i
[10:57] can see i can see i can use you know
[11:03] eic you know system so i can
[11:06] you know
[11:08] i can change it i can see i can change
[11:11] my attitude towards
[11:13] and i can see
[11:22] got those
[11:23] you know
[11:24] great atmospheres i can see them i enjoy
[11:26] putting down the load all the times
[11:29] the cat is so good pretty low hey
[11:32] man
[11:50] so one day i'll share a bigger testimony
[11:52] but i um
[11:54] i just want to i just want to catch on
[11:56] to to what isaac said in regards to
[11:59] to
[12:00] if god sees something
[12:02] that he brings it to pass
[12:04] um
[12:07] it's it's incredible how
[12:09] the song jubilee came to
[12:13] existence
[12:14] and this time
[12:16] i've been fighting a battle for the last
[12:18] six
[12:19] odds seven odd years now
[12:22] it's been pretty
[12:24] pretty big in my life um
[12:30] and god's come and he's
[12:33] he's changed so much in a short
[12:36] time that it's just it's just incredible
[12:40] and
[12:41] the only thing that i want to say is
[12:43] that each one of us have got troubles
[12:44] each one of us have got its own thing
[12:46] each one of us has got your own walk
[12:48] everybody's got the same not the same
[12:51] thing but you've got struggles in your
[12:52] life that only you and god know about
[12:55] and nobody can change that but god
[12:58] the only time that he can change that is
[13:00] if you absolutely lay your life down and
[13:02] go
[13:03] i'm done struggling
[13:07] let god it's like all this
[13:09] the problem is is usually
[13:12] you know god gives us the the the the um
[13:18] the parable of potter and plate
[13:21] um
[13:22] if you can imagine that the spindle is
[13:25] spinning around spinning around with
[13:26] this piece of clay on it the clay can do
[13:28] nothing
[13:29] on its own
[13:31] absolutely nothing it's worthless
[13:33] junk just sitting there doing nothing
[13:36] and um
[13:38] as soon as
[13:39] as soon as god's ready and he's got a
[13:42] vision and he knows right this is the
[13:44] time
[13:45] he starts working on this clay
[13:48] but he doesn't just just work on it
[13:50] softly there's a beating there's a
[13:53] molding there's a twisting there's a
[13:55] kneading and all that so this clay gets
[13:58] formed and kneaded and twisted and
[14:01] chucked this way and chucked this way
[14:02] and just absolutely
[14:06] mashed up
[14:07] before it actually starts getting molded
[14:14] there might be bits flying off here bits
[14:15] flying off there and there's people
[14:17] around you that put the bits back and
[14:19] but everything that happens in your life
[14:21] all stay part of this one piece of clay
[14:23] it never goes away but it stays part of
[14:25] your testimony it stays part of who you
[14:27] are
[14:30] and before god works on the clay he
[14:32] gives you promises
[14:34] like the small window that he opens he
[14:36] gives you
[14:37] i will bring it to creation
[14:39] god only has to say it once
[14:41] but what he says and what he promises he
[14:44] will
[14:45] bring separation it will happen as
[14:48] promises are yesterday man it will
[14:49] always
[14:51] happen
[14:52] and
[14:53] god promised me quite a few years back
[14:56] that when i said lord i now i just i
[14:59] need you i don't care i need you he
[15:02] promised me that he will finish the work
[15:04] that he started and he will give back
[15:06] whatever
[15:07] i lose
[15:10] and that was awesome to hear
[15:12] and then he started kneading and
[15:14] twisting and molding and had hurt
[15:18] it was
[15:20] definitely not what you expect when god
[15:22] starts working your life puts trials and
[15:24] tribulations in your way that you think
[15:26] but why is this happening
[15:30] but in at the end of the day he says he
[15:32] works everything
[15:33] for the good for those who love him
[15:36] and although it might not feel that way
[15:38] and although it might look absolutely
[15:41] dark and desperate that is exactly when
[15:43] you let go and oh god mold the clay
[15:47] not you you don't work in yourself
[15:50] and that's when he does the work
[15:52] and although things seem absolutely
[15:55] useless
[15:57] job felt that way as well right and god
[16:00] came and said well
[16:02] i did this
[16:03] for your good
[16:05] and and you know there's so many there's
[16:07] so many of those things that you see in
[16:08] the bible and
[16:10] it was just before camp that god started
[16:12] working
[16:13] and showing me right this is what the
[16:15] vessel should look like this is what
[16:17] i've planned and so forth
[16:18] long story short god will
[16:20] he will
[16:22] he will deliver on his promises
[16:24] every
[16:25] time amen and hold fast to those
[16:27] promises because that's all you have
[16:30] and just let him do it and walk you all
[16:32] like like karman said as well it doesn't
[16:34] matter what's happening just walk your
[16:35] walk and seek him first seek
[16:37] you first the kingdom of heaven and all
[16:39] these things will be added unto you and
[16:40] that's what i held on to
[16:42] such a long time
[16:44] and my jubilee
[16:45] you know feels like it's it's here and i
[16:48] can be happy and glad
[16:50] and rejoice in it but
[16:53] hold fast for him
[16:55] and what you said was very true is the
[16:56] same thing that i saw is that that
[16:58] usually what a potter makes is a pot of
[17:00] some kind to hold either water or
[17:02] anything or something like that and at
[17:04] the end of the day when god is finished
[17:06] with you
[17:07] then yes you don't get molded anymore it
[17:10] is a time of peace but then he pours his
[17:12] spirit into you
[17:13] to pour out somewhere else amen and to
[17:15] give and to give and to give and
[17:17] whatever he fills you up
[17:19] you then give and that's where the
[17:21] musicians and
[17:23] and and brother ben and andy and
[17:25] everybody comes in where it's like they
[17:27] are they now to serve um and every now
[17:29] and then god will still speak to them if
[17:31] foreign foreign
[17:34] so god bless you guys for what you do
[17:36] and
[17:36] and
[17:37] yeah one day i'll share a bit longer
[17:39] testimony won't take too much time
[17:41] please
[17:56] brothers and sisters um
[17:58] like what just hannah shared before for
[18:00] me
[18:01] i was my first camp and um
[18:05] it was what i took away from it was
[18:06] having to change the atmosphere um and
[18:09] like you see when i got home from camp
[18:10] these things the world i bought sport or
[18:12] a movie at the end of the night and
[18:14] these things i just had to strip out and
[18:16] it was changing my atmosphere um and
[18:18] things were really really hard for my
[18:19] wife at the moment so
[18:21] you know usually when we get home
[18:23] we just fall to bits
[18:25] um but changing the atmosphere before my
[18:27] wife got home and putting what i felt
[18:29] aside
[18:30] giving things to my wife and just
[18:33] yeah changing everything music
[18:36] making sure it was good in the house
[18:39] encouraging her to read a bible with me
[18:42] praying together
[18:44] it's made a huge difference eh so that's
[18:46] yeah well i got a lot more than that
[18:48] from ken there was a lot more but for me
[18:50] it was just saying you know i hannah
[18:51] said the atmosphere is a huge start to
[18:53] getting where you want to
[18:54] be and the thing i hadn't met god was
[18:58] really just trusting the lord
[19:01] but with every single bit
[19:03] and i read this week that uh in a
[19:05] daily devotional that um you need to
[19:07] trust your
[19:08] pastor and
[19:10] i do now
[19:11] a lot more than what i did before then
[19:13] and he hit on the head for me what i
[19:15] wasn't letting go of
[19:17] um
[19:18] and when i let go of that
[19:20] that's when i wanted to focus on the
[19:22] atmosphere and i wanted to focus on my
[19:24] bible
[19:25] and since then yeah i can start to see
[19:26] that love letter that he's put through
[19:28] there and i've started from the
[19:29] beginning and i'm
[19:30] just going to go through to the end and
[19:31] see what happens but that i just wanted
[19:33] to share because if vanessa touched on
[19:34] that and just said i couldn't get by
[19:36] without saying thank you to you all and
[19:38] that i really trust my pastor
[19:40] he's a man of god and uh he wouldn't
[19:42] have done and set up all this without
[19:44] that inspiration from him and you are
[19:45] fantastic brother thank you
[19:57] all right
[19:59] you know what yes you said about the
[20:00] potter
[20:01] when he molds them
[20:03] when a potter molds the pot he never
[20:06] takes his hands off the pot
[20:09] and that's amazing he washes it with
[20:10] water
[20:12] and he always holds on to that pot
[20:15] and it's when those finer details come
[20:17] into play
[20:18] that the pot is nearly done
[20:21] that's wonderful
[20:22] very good that's wonderful
[20:26] let's stand

[37:40] thank you for the job
[37:42] amen
[37:43] well
[37:44] camp for me
[37:48] sunday night with you everything to me
[37:51] um the whole camp was phenomenal
[37:53] it was very stressful for me even though
[37:55] i didn't do anything
[37:57] i mean i just like to thank everyone
[37:59] here
[38:00] i mean brother corbin you know omar and
[38:02] the ladies i mean in the mother's room
[38:06] doing the rooms you know everything just
[38:09] everyone just taking their position
[38:11] you all here
[38:12] you know the reason
[38:14] why was camp so good
[38:15] well god was there amen but just because
[38:18] you came with expectations
[38:20] and he came and met us individually
[38:23] amen and you know so camp it was very
[38:25] much a step up from uh from from the
[38:27] first one i think the first time we
[38:28] didn't really know what we were doing or
[38:29] what we were going to expect
[38:31] amen but uh you know thankfully the lord
[38:33] yeah he was very he was gracious to us
[38:35] amen things could have gone pretty
[38:37] pear-shaped there at camp
[38:39] but the lord just in his mercy just
[38:41] navigated us through it
[38:43] you know in the beginning there was a
[38:44] lot of uh i'd say there's a lot of
[38:46] spiritual warfare going on and that's
[38:48] the first few services
[38:50] but then god just took over
[38:52] and he had the glory that's why we're
[38:54] that breakthrough sunday
[38:56] sunday morning brother you know when
[38:57] brother tim invited me about the service
[38:59] he said i felt we had a real
[39:00] breakthrough
[39:02] and then sunday night god just did what
[39:04] he needed to do
[39:06] amen it's the same thing that same
[39:08] battle is an array
[39:09] here
[39:10] but let's press it on amen amen let's go
[39:13] to hebrews chapter 12 and i want to go
[39:15] to genesis chapter 31.
[39:17] i just want to take a thought from the
[39:20] from from the scripture uh
[39:23] especially genesis so let's read genesis
[39:25] 31 first before we go to hebrews um
[39:28] because
[39:29] uh hebrews is a bit of a context so
[39:31] we'll go to genesis 31
[39:33] and um
[39:35] you know
[39:36] camp was wonderful but let's build on
[39:38] camp amen
[39:39] you know camp
[39:40] you know let's not just rest back and
[39:42] say well he did wonderful things there
[39:44] let's press on and take every promise
[39:46] let's keep pressing the battle until the
[39:47] endless bodies amen amen i pray god just
[39:50] gives us a greater zeal amen i mean to
[39:52] live for him and just love him
[39:54] but everything
[39:56] amen let's just press on amen amen god's
[39:59] given us the country the land is ours
[40:02] every promise is ours
[40:04] amen let's take it so genesis 31 i'm
[40:07] going to read from verse
[40:08] 11.
[40:10] down to verse 13
[40:12] and then we're going to go to the first
[40:13] and then we're going to read then we're
[40:15] going to drop down to verse 53
[40:17] so genesis 11
[40:19] i mean sorry
[40:20] 31 and verses 11 to 13. and the angel of
[40:24] god spake unto me in a dream this is
[40:26] jacob saying jacob and i said here am i
[40:29] and he said lift up now thine eyes and
[40:31] see all the rams which leap upon the
[40:33] cattle
[40:35] ring
[40:36] ring straight and speckled and grizzled
[40:38] for i have seen all the laban death unto
[40:41] thee i am the lord i am the god of
[40:44] bethel
[40:45] thou anoint us the pillar and where thou
[40:47] vows avow unto me now arise
[40:50] get me out from this land and return
[40:53] unto the land of thy kindred
[40:55] and then we'll drop down to verse 30 uh
[40:57] sorry 53 of the same chapter
[41:01] and so this is this is now laban is
[41:03] saying his font remember lavon was
[41:06] rachel
[41:07] and uh lee is mum
[41:09] i mean sorry dad parent dad and so now
[41:12] jacob's returning back to his land where
[41:14] you're returning back to the promised
[41:16] land and there's a final separation
[41:18] taking place here between between laban
[41:21] and jacob
[41:22] the god of abraham and the god of of of
[41:25] nahu the god of their father judge uh
[41:28] betwixt us and jacob swear
[41:31] by the fear of his father isaac then
[41:33] jacob offered the sacrifice
[41:35] upon the mount and called his brethren
[41:37] to eat bread and they did eat bread and
[41:39] tarried all night on the mount and early
[41:41] in the morning laban rose up and kissed
[41:43] his sons and his daughters and blessed
[41:45] them and laban departed and returned to
[41:48] his place
[41:49] and jacob went on his way and the angels
[41:52] of god met him
[41:53] and when jacob saw them he said this is
[41:56] god's host and he called the name of
[41:59] that place mahanayam
[42:02] and let's just go to hebrews chapter 12
[42:04] as just a bit of context
[42:10] and uh we'll just read from verse 18
[42:12] down to verse 24.
[42:16] for ye
[42:17] this is where paul is saying this is we
[42:19] have come for ye have not come unto the
[42:21] mount that might be uh that might be
[42:23] touched and that burnt with fire nor
[42:25] unto blackness and darkness and tempest
[42:28] and the sound of a trumpet and the voice
[42:30] of words which voice they that heard and
[42:32] treated that the word should not be
[42:34] spoken to them anymore
[42:36] for they could not endure that which was
[42:38] commanded and if so much as a beast
[42:40] touched the mountain it shall be stoned
[42:42] or thrust through with a dart and so
[42:45] terrible was the sight that moses said i
[42:47] accidentally fear and quake
[42:49] but ye are coming to mount zion and unto
[42:52] the city of the living god the heavenly
[42:54] jerusalem and to an enumerable company
[42:56] of angels to the general assembly and
[42:59] church of the firstborn which are
[43:01] written in heaven and to god the judge
[43:03] of all and to the spirits of just being
[43:05] made perfect and to jesus the mediator
[43:08] of the new covenant and to the blood of
[43:10] sprinkling that speakers better things
[43:12] than that of abel amen may the lord
[43:14] bless his word you may be seated so i
[43:17] want to i want to take that thought
[43:18] really from
[43:20] from there where jacob he you know you
[43:22] know he he comes into a season in his
[43:24] life and he recognizes that this place
[43:27] he's come to as a place and he calls it
[43:30] uh mahanayam and that means that means
[43:33] the place of two camps
[43:35] the place of two hosts
[43:37] and so there's a natural there's a
[43:38] natural host here
[43:40] where there's him in his family but then
[43:42] he recognizes he's more than just him in
[43:44] this place i remember the angels of god
[43:46] have come to visit him in this place
[43:48] and this is very significant because
[43:50] surely after this you know he's gonna go
[43:53] see esau and he's and he's and he gets
[43:56] really distressed because he's he
[43:58] remembers that he had to run for his
[43:59] life
[44:00] you know it was it was quite a few years
[44:02] before this but he had to run for his
[44:03] life because he he took the birthright
[44:06] from us from his brother and his brother
[44:08] wanted to kill him so so he ran for his
[44:10] life and now he had to return home god
[44:13] had said return amen to to the place you
[44:16] once were in
[44:17] and it was shortly it was shortly after
[44:20] this where where he saw the host of the
[44:23] angels there in this place
[44:25] that he would send first he would try to
[44:27] buy his favor of his brother and he and
[44:30] and you know the story he sends his
[44:33] flocks he tries to bribe him and then he
[44:35] sends his family to try and maybe soften
[44:37] his heart while they're my kindred but
[44:40] that didn't change change jacob you know
[44:42] he and then after that he wrestled with
[44:44] god he wrestled with an angel all night
[44:47] and so and then it was only after when
[44:49] he was wrestling you know the sun was
[44:51] coming up
[44:52] and
[44:53] you know and and and the angel said to
[44:55] him let me go he says i won't let you go
[44:57] till you bless me and he touches his
[44:59] thigh
[45:00] and he and it caused him to walk
[45:02] different and he changes his name from
[45:04] from jacob to israel amen from suplanta
[45:06] to prince with god amen and but he
[45:09] recognized that they you know
[45:11] and this is very important because
[45:14] these things happen
[45:16] we find that in the scripture there are
[45:18] great times of you know in great times
[45:20] of distress and jacob was going into a
[45:23] time of distress
[45:25] in times of great distress and when
[45:27] things are coming to a great climax
[45:31] in these times is when there's an
[45:32] opening heaven opens
[45:35] where god causes the believer to know
[45:37] that it's more than just them but the
[45:39] eternal is with them right
[45:41] amen you know don't think of camp is
[45:43] just camp
[45:45] amen but we're we've come into a season
[45:48] and i trust that you you very much
[45:49] recognize it there's a natural camp
[45:52] i mean your natural life however you
[45:54] have it but there's a supernatural
[45:56] camp as well
[45:57] i remember we're living in a place of
[45:59] two camps that's right amen that there's
[46:01] a natural one and there's a supernatural
[46:03] camp
[46:04] and to god god caused jacob to come into
[46:07] this place
[46:08] and this was the same place that david
[46:11] fled to when epsilon took the throne he
[46:14] fled to mahanam
[46:15] amen and and in the bible when people go
[46:18] to a place there's a reason they go to a
[46:20] certain place
[46:21] like ruth came into bethlehem
[46:25] which is the house of god's bread amen
[46:27] you know and and because she was a type
[46:30] of the bride and boaz was the mighty man
[46:33] of wealth who was a big important man in
[46:36] the house of god's bread speaking of
[46:38] christ and they had the
[46:40] uniting there happened in bethlehem
[46:43] and jesus was born in bethlehem because
[46:45] he is the house of god's bread he is the
[46:47] bread i am the bread that came down from
[46:49] heaven amen there's a reason he was born
[46:51] there
[46:52] and so whenever people go to places in
[46:54] the bible the name of the place is very
[46:56] significant that's right i mean that
[46:58] their footsteps have come to these
[47:00] places so david ran from absalom he fled
[47:03] from him and he went to mahoney so he
[47:05] went to a place whenever you know
[47:07] because we are walking our walk
[47:09] and the devil will either raise someone
[47:12] up or he'll just come against you
[47:13] directly to try and push you out of your
[47:15] position
[47:17] amen david was the king he was standing
[47:20] in his position and then the enemy
[47:22] anointed his son epsilon
[47:24] who was never meant to be king and he
[47:26] put in his heart i want to be king and
[47:28] he rose up in pride
[47:30] but notice where did david go to
[47:32] to receive strength and we'll read the
[47:34] scripture maybe maybe we could just read
[47:37] it now actually let's go to um
[47:39] second samuel 17.
[47:44] it's got a second samuel 17.
[47:50] and we'll just read verses 26
[47:54] to 29.
[48:03] so this is david
[48:05] he's fleeing
[48:11] remember he's fleeing for his life
[48:13] he's fleeing for his life remember
[48:15] there's a council of one councillor
[48:17] there's another councillor and they gave
[48:19] epsilon epsilon was getting counsel from
[48:21] them and epsilon believed the wrong
[48:23] council and the one guy who said you
[48:25] should do this go pursue him go take him
[48:27] when when when he when he heard that
[48:30] epsilon did not take his advice he set
[48:32] his house in order and he and he went
[48:34] and hung himself because he knew there
[48:35] was no way i was going to be successful
[48:38] i mean so so david was fleeing for his
[48:40] life you can go read the story and this
[48:42] is a second samuel 17 verses uh
[48:45] 26-29
[48:47] season it came to pass when david was
[48:49] come to mahanayam
[48:51] that
[48:52] that
[48:54] show be the son of of nash
[48:58] of rabbath of the children of ammon
[49:00] and and
[49:02] forgive me for these names and
[49:05] uh and mecca the son of of emile of
[49:09] la
[49:10] uh lodiaba and vasri of gilea gillilite
[49:14] and i'll skip the last one brought b
[49:16] beds and basins and earthen vessels and
[49:18] wheat and barley and flour and parched
[49:20] corn and beans and lentils and pert and
[49:22] parched pulse and honey and butter and
[49:24] sheep and cheese of kind
[49:27] for david and for the people that were
[49:29] with him to eat and they said the people
[49:31] is hungry and weary and thirsty in the
[49:34] wilderness so they came to this place
[49:36] and they got refreshed
[49:38] i mean after fleeing
[49:40] and so
[49:41] we
[49:42] you know he went to this place he went
[49:44] to mahanayam because it's a place of two
[49:46] camps
[49:47] amen he went to a place where not just
[49:50] to receive physical strength now this is
[49:52] just me but there's a reason he went to
[49:53] this place why didn't he go to gilgal
[49:55] why didn't he go to some other place
[49:57] he went to mahanaya he went to a place
[49:59] of two camps he went to a place where
[50:01] jacob recognized the host of god is here
[50:04] amen i mean that that the supernatural
[50:07] realm this eternal realm would open up
[50:09] and angels would descend and god
[50:12] would cause jacob to recognize this more
[50:14] than just him in this walk
[50:16] i mean it's more than just more than
[50:18] just him doing his little thing and
[50:20] thinking that he's doing the right thing
[50:21] but god was guiding his steps
[50:23] and it's in times of distress and we've
[50:25] had times of distress
[50:27] you know i've had the post camp blues i
[50:30] had the pre-camp loose
[50:32] amen i just had the blues
[50:34] hallelujah
[50:36] because things would go terribly wrong
[50:38] and you know but you've got to recognize
[50:40] when things are going wrong where do you
[50:42] where do you turn to to receive your
[50:44] strength that's right do you receive it
[50:46] from natural things or do you do you go
[50:48] to a place where you know god is present
[50:50] and then because if you turn to natural
[50:52] things you'll you'll give a natural
[50:54] answer
[50:56] and you'll answer in your flesh and
[50:57] things will blow up and you say why did
[50:59] this happen that's right it's because
[51:01] you're receiving the wrong strength
[51:03] but if you turn to a place where god is
[51:05] hey i mean because god god isn't just a
[51:08] camp god isn't just a church and god is
[51:11] everywhere you go amen amen if you just
[51:14] open your open your understanding or
[51:16] just open your heart and just recognize
[51:18] i'm not alone in this world
[51:20] amen there's angels there's a scripture
[51:22] it says that the angel of the lord
[51:23] encamps about those who fear him
[51:25] and it's not saying angels it says the
[51:27] angel of the lord and that is god and
[51:30] angelic 4.
[51:31] so the very god of heaven and camps
[51:33] around you amen amen hallelujah he's
[51:35] with you every day
[51:37] amen if we could just look beyond these
[51:39] five senses just just one time
[51:42] amen just to see who's with us
[51:44] hey friends
[51:46] we're going to take every promise
[51:48] amen jacob did not settle for being just
[51:51] in a land of a foreign land it's when he
[51:53] was coming back into as an inheritance
[51:55] amen amen he got his family he got his
[51:57] wives and now he's going back amen i
[51:59] mean to the land that was given to
[52:00] abraham he was going to possess that
[52:02] land hallelujah so as when he is going
[52:05] back to his inheritance there's a
[52:06] visitation of angels
[52:08] and i'll jump way ahead of where i'm
[52:10] going but we've had a visitation of
[52:12] angels
[52:13] amen in this hour where where where the
[52:16] prophet stood up and said no i had these
[52:18] you know you know i just had a vision
[52:19] and there was there was you know there's
[52:21] a whole cluster of birds came little
[52:23] birds
[52:24] and then some bigger birds came and then
[52:26] and then suddenly from eternity like a
[52:28] split seven angels appeared with swept
[52:31] back wings
[52:32] hallelujah and he was caught up into the
[52:34] constellation of angels
[52:36] amen and so and this was all taking
[52:39] place
[52:40] and then he said now you know he was he
[52:42] was northeast of tucson on a mountain
[52:44] wherever he was you know the blast came
[52:46] and shook the country this isn't his
[52:47] vision and he thought maybe it's his
[52:49] death
[52:50] and then so after this he prayed
[52:53] and he prayed he said lord if this is
[52:55] the end of my life can you just send
[52:57] your power so i'll know
[52:58] nothing happened but he said lord if
[53:01] this is the purpose of the ministry send
[53:03] your power back now and he said it
[53:04] almost took him from the roof
[53:06] now he was a man who had thousands of
[53:08] thousands of visitations of god
[53:11] and you can see you know you know you
[53:13] hear brother biscuit's testimony when
[53:15] when he's in the car with brother
[53:16] branham
[53:17] and then brother brown's asking him you
[53:18] know do you think this ministry could be
[53:20] that of elijah the prophet and so his
[53:22] ministry said this ministry
[53:24] and then brother eddie said well he felt
[53:26] very insufficient to answer me says i
[53:28] feel
[53:29] i think it just seems that way
[53:32] you know yes and then instantly he said
[53:33] this being just came in
[53:35] he couldn't see it but it was like right
[53:37] here between them
[53:38] and he said and you go watch it he says
[53:41] my fellow my next breath will take me
[53:43] into eternity
[53:45] now
[53:46] we've been in the presence of god i've
[53:48] been the presence of god yes but i've
[53:49] never really felt that my next breath
[53:51] would take me into eternity and then he
[53:54] looked at brother branham in his bed
[53:55] because he'd been
[53:56] hunting for a good week so unshaved his
[53:59] bed was all sticking out
[54:00] and it looked like and he looked like a
[54:02] man who was just about to die
[54:04] and then brother brown looks at me says
[54:06] you know brother eddie ten thousand
[54:08] times ten thousand he's come to me and
[54:10] it's always the same like i could just
[54:12] die
[54:13] because that's why
[54:14] you think
[54:16] sometimes we'll feel the blessings of
[54:17] god
[54:19] but there's a reason why when an angel
[54:21] appeared to someone who says fear not
[54:22] right because it's a real fearful thing
[54:25] yes amen so he was a man who had
[54:27] thousands of visitations but he said
[54:29] this one vision
[54:31] when god sent his power
[54:33] so as an answer of is this a further
[54:36] part of the ministry it almost took him
[54:37] from the room to me that's a significant
[54:39] thing yes
[54:41] and then so he goes you know he goes
[54:43] hunting there a few months later
[54:46] constellation of angels come now
[54:48] remember as i said with jacob those
[54:51] angels appeared to him there because he
[54:52] was going back into his inheritance
[54:54] his inheritance wasn't where his
[54:56] father-in-law was living his inheritance
[54:58] was in the promised land amen amen and
[55:01] so there was a visitation of angels
[55:03] there
[55:04] before he went into his inheritance yes
[55:07] and here we are
[55:09] and we'll go to the scripture mate but
[55:11] i'm just i just want to this is where
[55:12] i'm going
[55:14] the prophet had a visitation of angels
[55:16] here on sunset mountain
[55:18] and then they said go back to
[55:19] jeffersonville for the seven seals are
[55:21] going to be open
[55:22] the inheritance is going to be made
[55:24] known
[55:25] i mean what's in the book is going to be
[55:26] made known you're actually going to know
[55:28] what the mysteries are amen not just not
[55:31] just what the enemy's doing but what
[55:32] god's
[55:38] if you don't know what the will says
[55:40] right you know you can have a very rich
[55:42] i've got a very rich uncle
[55:44] but i'm not holding my breath to get
[55:46] anything from him
[55:47] but
[55:48] it takes a lawyer and probably said this
[55:50] a few times but it takes a lawyer who's
[55:52] qualified to actually open the will and
[55:54] allocate what's in the world
[55:56] not just anyone can do it
[55:59] it's someone who actually has the has
[56:01] the credentials to do it that's right as
[56:03] the same thing with a prophet it it's
[56:05] only a prophet can open the will amen
[56:07] that's right amen because it's the new
[56:09] testament it's the new will
[56:12] it's the will and testament so god has
[56:14] been laying up jesus when he died he
[56:16] paid the price for the will
[56:18] he died because if if if he was alive he
[56:21] could not give the contents of the will
[56:23] he's right but only he will be different
[56:24] when the guy is dead
[56:26] amen so he had to die that we could
[56:29] receive the will amen the inheritance
[56:31] that we have yes amen amen we have an
[56:34] inheritance in heaven yo yo
[56:36] incorruptable yes amen and we have that
[56:39] same we have a part of their inheritance
[56:42] here amen i mean so that's why jesus had
[56:45] to die because there was parts of adam's
[56:47] race that will fall and he said well i
[56:49] don't i want to give them what they lost
[56:52] i mean i want to restore to them what
[56:54] they lost what adam lost i want to give
[56:56] back to them
[56:58] hallelujah amen so now there was a time
[57:01] that was a time in this hour
[57:04] i know brother marcus touched on at the
[57:05] convention but you know
[57:07] this was a season
[57:08] we are living in a season where we had a
[57:10] visitation of angels yes but not just
[57:13] that
[57:14] because remember jacob
[57:16] jacob after he had the visitation of
[57:18] angels
[57:19] then god wrestled with him
[57:22] amen because if you read the scripture
[57:23] he says i've seen god i've wrestled with
[57:25] god and prevailed
[57:27] amen
[57:29] and god changed because remember a name
[57:31] represents a nature or a life
[57:33] you think of jesus you think of the man
[57:35] of galilee
[57:37] raising the dead going to lazarus's
[57:39] grave delivering legion feeding the
[57:41] thousands you're walking on water
[57:43] raising again on the third day
[57:45] packing your sins to calvary you think
[57:46] about all that don't you when you think
[57:48] of jesus so jacob before his name was
[57:51] changed he was a supplanter
[57:53] hey he tricked easter out of his
[57:54] birthright and he did everything he
[57:56] could to to to get all the wealth all
[57:59] you know you know wealth of labar and
[58:00] all these things
[58:02] but then his name was changed his walk
[58:03] was changed amen i mean his his his bone
[58:07] came out of joint or whatever it was and
[58:09] so he walked different and he was called
[58:10] by a new name
[58:12] it's not just a supplanter but a prince
[58:13] with god
[58:15] so there's a visitation of angels
[58:18] and then god himself came
[58:20] and he wrestled with him and it caused
[58:23] jacob to be changed to israel
[58:26] amen and then now you bring it down into
[58:28] us because you say well that's nice that
[58:30] brother brown had a visitation of angels
[58:32] but that's just not it
[58:34] amen because god promised that in
[58:36] revelations 10 that he himself would
[58:38] descend
[58:39] amen jesus himself the covenant angel
[58:41] would come
[58:42] so there'd be a visitation so he had the
[58:44] visitation avengers on sunset mountain
[58:46] and then when he went to jeffersonville
[58:48] he would sit there and he said you know
[58:49] it's unusual and then you go hear it or
[58:52] read it he says that's unusual i'm not
[58:54] sure what simon said in the series but
[58:56] he said normally he always has visitors
[58:58] coming
[58:59] but he's just by himself he had time to
[59:01] study and you know every day he'd go in
[59:02] because he didn't know what the next
[59:03] seal would be
[59:05] and then he said he said he and then he
[59:07] came into the room
[59:08] and showed him what it was
[59:10] in the word so he was now the angel of
[59:13] god had come amen amen the same one that
[59:16] met jacob now came down and opened his
[59:18] word to us
[59:19] hallelujah but not only that now that
[59:22] word comes to you amen and then you
[59:24] begin to wrestle and then you begin to
[59:26] wrestle
[59:27] hallelujah you can't say you know i
[59:28] remember when i first heard this word i
[59:30] was wrestling
[59:32] i was wrestling but i didn't let go
[59:34] until i was changed
[59:36] i mean don't just get partially
[59:38] delivered or partially changed or don't
[59:40] just be affected be changed
[59:42] i mean be permanently changed by him
[59:45] amen hallelujah because of jacob just
[59:47] let go
[59:48] jacob knew he needed a change
[59:52] amen how could he be the head of his
[59:53] people if he was still a supplanter
[59:56] i mean he needed a change and you can
[59:58] know in your own self
[1:00:00] amen you need to change if you haven't
[1:00:02] been changed
[1:00:04] hallelujah he never went back to being a
[1:00:06] supplanter
[1:00:08] amen and when god does the work you
[1:00:09] don't go back to what you used to be
[1:00:12] the devil may try and send it your way
[1:00:14] again but there's something in you that
[1:00:15] says there's nothing in me that wants
[1:00:16] that amen hallelujah because you have
[1:00:19] stepped into a supernatural realm and
[1:00:21] you've been changed amen hallelujah
[1:00:24] that's right i mean it's a very god
[1:00:25] himself now he's not just in 1965 i'm
[1:00:29] sure you know he felt the prince of god
[1:00:31] there at camp
[1:00:32] hallelujah what caused the people to you
[1:00:34] know you know i went back and and i
[1:00:36] listened to the after song service there
[1:00:38] sunday night
[1:00:39] amen i'm so glad we had the crowd mike
[1:00:42] because we're just praying then the
[1:00:44] whole place just erupts
[1:00:46] hallelujah and you can see god's doing
[1:00:47] and then and then we sing the saints go
[1:00:49] marching in
[1:00:51] hallelujah things begin to happen why
[1:00:53] because he came into the building
[1:00:56] amen that same god i'm always contending
[1:00:58] the same god
[1:00:59] i mean it's present here
[1:01:01] that is back there and there's no
[1:01:03] excitement that's not trying to work you
[1:01:05] up it's a reality
[1:01:07] oh lou you think heaven's your god isn't
[1:01:09] just some distant place
[1:01:11] he said jesus said i'll be with you even
[1:01:14] in you to the end of the world
[1:01:15] because it's not us that is the
[1:01:17] christian he has to come in and be the
[1:01:19] christian in you
[1:01:20] because when you receive the holy ghost
[1:01:22] you enter into rest
[1:01:24] just like god ceased from his own works
[1:01:27] amen so you cease from your own works
[1:01:29] and he is the christian in you
[1:01:31] amen hallelujah what a rest it is yeah i
[1:01:34] mean even in every storm you just plow
[1:01:36] through the storm hallelujah amen
[1:01:40] don't give the devil an inch amen don't
[1:01:42] retreat don't let him try and steal what
[1:01:44] he did for you he will try he tried to
[1:01:47] rob it from me
[1:01:48] i looked i just said no i refuse hey i
[1:01:51] mean to look at the negative god did
[1:01:53] great things
[1:01:54] hardly he spoke to my heart amen
[1:01:56] hallelujah don't let him because he will
[1:01:58] try and rob you
[1:02:00] he will try and rob you and if you
[1:02:01] believe his lie you'll be robbed that's
[1:02:03] right i remember if you remember what
[1:02:05] god did for you and hold on to it say
[1:02:06] satan this is mine amen amen this is
[1:02:09] part of my inheritance
[1:02:11] hallelujah you have no right to take
[1:02:12] this from me amen hallelujah you're
[1:02:14] gideon ahead of time
[1:02:16] that's right he didn't go to mahoney but
[1:02:18] he had because remember a place of two
[1:02:20] camps is when the supernatural comes
[1:02:22] down
[1:02:23] and people are like gideon
[1:02:26] gideon was in a time of harvest
[1:02:28] a time of harvest is normally a time of
[1:02:30] joy
[1:02:31] because all your labors you you know you
[1:02:33] begin to see the fruit of your labors
[1:02:36] you know tilling the ground and then and
[1:02:38] then sowing the seed and then cutting
[1:02:39] out the weeds and doing whatever you do
[1:02:41] making sure the vines are growing up on
[1:02:43] the trellis and you know you just have
[1:02:45] everything ready
[1:02:46] and finally the season's right the
[1:02:49] fruit's on the vine
[1:02:51] hallelujah but so he was in a time of
[1:02:53] harvest but then he was threshing weak
[1:02:56] by the wine press he was trying to do it
[1:02:57] in secret
[1:02:58] because he was afraid
[1:03:00] he was afraid the enemy was coming just
[1:03:02] like every other harvest
[1:03:04] every other camp
[1:03:06] every other special meeting
[1:03:08] every other time that the word just
[1:03:10] becomes such a blessing
[1:03:12] amen
[1:03:14] and the enemy will just ride in again
[1:03:17] oh that's mine take it away
[1:03:19] and he's actually in just about a state
[1:03:22] as if there never was a heart
[1:03:24] amen
[1:03:26] now gideon
[1:03:28] gideon could not he did not work out or
[1:03:31] plan how am i going to be delivered of
[1:03:33] this thing right amen he was stuck in
[1:03:35] this condition
[1:03:37] but that condition is no condition for a
[1:03:39] son or daughter of god
[1:03:41] amen that was not gideon's portion
[1:03:43] that's right hallelujah he didn't he
[1:03:46] didn't say no i'm going to cut down the
[1:03:47] idol in my father's house now i'm going
[1:03:49] to blow the trump or whatever we did
[1:03:51] together israel we're going to fight
[1:03:53] we're going to plan and get weapons he
[1:03:55] didn't plan that
[1:03:56] he was he was he was a fugitive in his
[1:03:58] own land basically doing things in
[1:04:00] secret yes
[1:04:02] amen but then now
[1:04:04] a supernatural realm opened up to him
[1:04:07] god he throws an old man with a staff it
[1:04:09] was the angel of the law they're going
[1:04:12] to speak to him he says gideon thou
[1:04:14] mighty man of valor hallelujah amen he
[1:04:16] began to speak what what what he really
[1:04:19] was
[1:04:20] i mean what he really was he wasn't he
[1:04:22] wasn't meant to be a man trying to just
[1:04:24] have a harvest quietly that that the
[1:04:26] enemy wouldn't steal it away but he was
[1:04:28] a mighty man of valor that's what god
[1:04:30] saw in him
[1:04:31] a mighty man of valor
[1:04:33] and that's what he sees in you
[1:04:35] highly a mighty man or woman of valor
[1:04:37] are you are people of faith
[1:04:39] i amen that can stand up and say i'll
[1:04:40] not let the devil rob me of my harvest
[1:04:43] holy i'll not let the devil take what
[1:04:45] belongs to me
[1:04:46] because he'll try and steal god's love
[1:04:48] from you you're trying to steal the
[1:04:49] peace he'll try and steal the joy you're
[1:04:51] trying to say it's just a drudgery to be
[1:04:53] a christian that's right i say if if if
[1:04:55] he's taken anything from you do not let
[1:04:57] him hold on to it
[1:04:59] harlow you have a right remember it's in
[1:05:01] the will
[1:05:02] well how do i know i'm part of the will
[1:05:04] because when the voice of god came your
[1:05:06] way something in here said that's me
[1:05:09] that's how you know you're part of the
[1:05:11] will not because you're born in a
[1:05:13] certain family or you're good or ugly or
[1:05:15] whatever you may think you are amen it's
[1:05:17] because something in here says yes
[1:05:20] that's how you know you're part of the
[1:05:22] will amen amen the apostles
[1:05:24] they were part of the will
[1:05:26] the woman at the well was part of the
[1:05:28] will
[1:05:29] amen legion was part of the world
[1:05:31] because in part because in the will they
[1:05:33] said the spirit of lord is upon me to
[1:05:35] deliver the captives that's right amen
[1:05:37] and jesus remember in luke 4 he reads
[1:05:39] the scripture from isaiah he says this
[1:05:41] day the scripture is fulfilled so this
[1:05:43] day this part of the will is being
[1:05:45] enforced amen amen that's right and so
[1:05:48] all those ones they were part of the
[1:05:50] wealth
[1:05:50] because when they heard
[1:05:52] the
[1:05:53] testator speaking
[1:05:56] the one who was going to give the world
[1:05:57] when they heard him preach they said
[1:05:59] never a man speak like this man yes
[1:06:01] there's more than just a man peter said
[1:06:03] they aren't the christ the son of the
[1:06:04] living god the scribes and pharisees
[1:06:07] heard the same preaching
[1:06:08] and they got angry and wild and they can
[1:06:11] and they planned how are we going to
[1:06:12] destroy this one
[1:06:13] why because they weren't part of the
[1:06:14] will
[1:06:16] hallelujah
[1:06:17] you hear the word
[1:06:19] amen something in you says i may not be
[1:06:22] able to put it all together or i may not
[1:06:24] understand how to but something in me
[1:06:26] says that's for me amen hallelujah
[1:06:28] you're part of the will amen amen he
[1:06:31] died for you
[1:06:32] not just to forgive your sins but give
[1:06:34] you a victorious walk
[1:06:36] hallelujah amen
[1:06:38] amen where am i now
[1:06:42] jacob
[1:06:44] i'll read this
[1:06:46] this isn't part of a prayer this is an
[1:06:48] end time evangelism
[1:06:51] he says i give them to you this morning
[1:06:53] father as trophies of the grace of jesus
[1:06:55] christ and of his word
[1:06:57] which we have preached this morning they
[1:06:59] are yours
[1:07:01] keep them safely lord until that day and
[1:07:04] may they grow as babes may the waters
[1:07:06] here in the pool find them as they have
[1:07:08] confessed their sins dying out they're
[1:07:10] gonna have a baptism services we're
[1:07:11] talking about
[1:07:12] being buried in christ to raise again in
[1:07:15] a new life to walk in a new world walk
[1:07:18] with new associates walk in a new
[1:07:21] company walk with angels walk in the
[1:07:23] presence of the supernatural
[1:07:25] them things that they can't see around
[1:07:28] them but they feel and know that they're
[1:07:31] there and they're lasting things the
[1:07:33] supernatural is the lasting we give them
[1:07:36] to you father in jesus name amen
[1:07:40] hallelujah
[1:07:42] we
[1:07:43] friends
[1:07:45] we walk in a supernatural realm
[1:07:47] the bride walks in the supernatural
[1:07:49] realm yeah amen don't ever look to
[1:07:51] natural things for your answer
[1:07:54] david fled to a place as i've said david
[1:07:56] fled to a place
[1:07:58] a place of two camps
[1:08:02] and he knew he was king
[1:08:04] he stood in his position even though he
[1:08:05] had to run
[1:08:06] i mean he didn't forfeit the crown he
[1:08:08] had to run
[1:08:09] but he went to a place that he received
[1:08:11] physical strength and also he received
[1:08:13] spiritual strength as well amen and then
[1:08:15] after that and then you read the next
[1:08:16] chapter after they go to mahanayam then
[1:08:18] they put the people in a ray for battle
[1:08:20] then they fight epsilon
[1:08:22] amen and then the victory is one
[1:08:24] amen
[1:08:26] god doesn't want us to lean on the arm
[1:08:28] of flesh
[1:08:30] god does not want you to lean upon the
[1:08:31] arm of flesh the scripture speaks
[1:08:33] against it amen especially your own
[1:08:36] flesh yes
[1:08:37] amen god remember we our source of
[1:08:39] strength is not
[1:08:41] physically one another
[1:08:43] our source of strength is spiritually
[1:08:46] what's in one another and what's in him
[1:08:49] amen because if god is in you i can
[1:08:51] contact the god in you
[1:08:53] amen and so if god is in one another
[1:08:55] then we can actually receive strength it
[1:08:58] says
[1:08:59] you know a word in season how good is it
[1:09:01] amen yeah no that's not verbatim from
[1:09:03] the word but it says a word in caesar
[1:09:05] says how good is it where do you get
[1:09:06] that word in season sometimes it's from
[1:09:08] here sometimes it's from the message
[1:09:10] sometimes it's from your brother and
[1:09:11] sister amen amen amen amen and so if you
[1:09:15] look if you look for the supernatural
[1:09:18] because that is supernatural
[1:09:21] where someone's just talking away you're
[1:09:22] talking away
[1:09:24] then i just say something not even
[1:09:25] really conscious of it it just anchors
[1:09:27] in your heart there we go
[1:09:29] i have my answer and you just walk on
[1:09:31] that is
[1:09:32] supernatural hallelujah
[1:09:36] now
[1:09:37] he says this this is another
[1:09:40] you don't mind these this isn't the
[1:09:42] infallibility of god's spoken word
[1:09:45] so what we worried about what we're
[1:09:47] skewing about
[1:09:49] while we go along great big long face
[1:09:52] let's look up and grin
[1:09:54] look up and not only grin but laugh not
[1:09:56] only laugh but raise up holy hands
[1:09:58] everywhere giving praise and glory to
[1:10:00] god for his promises are yea and amen
[1:10:03] amen not yes and no not yes and no but
[1:10:06] yes
[1:10:07] there's no no in it
[1:10:10] yes our foundation stands for sure our
[1:10:13] foundation of god god laid in zion the
[1:10:17] cornerstone
[1:10:18] there we are can't slip can't slide
[1:10:21] can't move
[1:10:22] now remember that cornerstone he laid
[1:10:24] was christ
[1:10:25] amen he's talking about he speaks about
[1:10:27] in romans
[1:10:29] in zion i learned a cornerstone
[1:10:32] and he
[1:10:33] wait let's just read that together come
[1:10:34] just go to romans
[1:10:57] all right verse 30.
[1:10:58] let's keep reading okay so so romans 9
[1:11:03] it says what shall we say to the
[1:11:05] gentiles which followed not after
[1:11:07] righteousness have obtained to
[1:11:08] righteousness even the righteous which
[1:11:10] is of faith but israel which followed
[1:11:13] after the law of righteousness has not
[1:11:15] obtained for the lord
[1:11:17] wherefore because they sought it not by
[1:11:19] faith but as it were by the works of the
[1:11:21] law for they stumbled at that stumbling
[1:11:24] stone as it is written behold i lay in
[1:11:26] zion a stumbling stone a rock of offense
[1:11:30] and whosoever believeth on him this is
[1:11:32] the person who shall not be ashamed
[1:11:35] so that rock is christ
[1:11:37] that rockets christ whoever believes on
[1:11:38] him shall not be shall not be ashamed
[1:11:42] you know faith let's just let's just
[1:11:43] deal with a few things
[1:11:45] the thief on the cross and i've said
[1:11:47] this
[1:11:48] faith
[1:11:49] reveals faith
[1:11:51] is
[1:11:52] how do you become righteous it's
[1:11:54] revealed to you christ has revealed to
[1:11:56] you in the season that he's manifesting
[1:11:58] himself
[1:11:59] amen so he's not a god of history to you
[1:12:02] but it becomes a living reality today
[1:12:05] that calvary is not just a a historical
[1:12:07] story
[1:12:08] i mean it becomes a living reality to
[1:12:10] you
[1:12:11] i mean that god when he's declaring his
[1:12:13] word this hour that's why brother you
[1:12:15] know your brother tim was saying this
[1:12:17] message is a love letter to you amen
[1:12:19] amen amen it's not it's not a bunch of
[1:12:21] doctrine or a bunch of dudes and dogs
[1:12:23] it's a love letter to the bride
[1:12:25] amy and she loves his words
[1:12:29] so that's why when people say they love
[1:12:30] the message
[1:12:32] if it's an intellectual love then
[1:12:33] they'll just see doctrine but it was the
[1:12:36] real revealed love of god amen amen
[1:12:39] thou love him
[1:12:40] because he is his word and the bride
[1:12:43] loves the word because the word is jesus
[1:12:45] christ
[1:12:46] amen amen now that's not intellectual
[1:12:48] gymnastics
[1:12:50] amen amen it's not a historical word a
[1:12:52] living word
[1:12:54] amen so revealed faith gives you
[1:12:57] righteousness amen amen jesus if he
[1:13:00] himself has revealed himself to you that
[1:13:03] causes you to believe on him and that
[1:13:05] makes you righteous hallelujah amen
[1:13:07] really yeah
[1:13:09] the thief on the cross
[1:13:12] remember the story you read you read the
[1:13:14] two accounts one time they're both
[1:13:15] rallying on jesus if they'll be the son
[1:13:18] of god take yourself off and you know
[1:13:20] but there comes a time where one thief
[1:13:22] says to the other
[1:13:23] shut up basically we we we deserve to be
[1:13:26] here but he doesn't deserve to be here
[1:13:28] it says remember me lord when you come
[1:13:30] into your kingdom
[1:13:32] and then what did what did jesus say
[1:13:35] he said
[1:13:37] he didn't say thou filthy sinner
[1:13:40] you're going to hell
[1:13:41] he says today you'll be with me in
[1:13:43] paradise amen amen so he saw one thief
[1:13:48] it was revealed to him here's the lamb
[1:13:49] of god
[1:13:50] dying for him it was revealed to him
[1:13:53] amen and that being revealed to him and
[1:13:55] him confessing lord when you come into
[1:13:57] your kingdom remember me
[1:13:59] that caused him his final destination to
[1:14:01] go a total different way amen
[1:14:07] after that he was pardoned he went into
[1:14:08] paradise he went to the same place that
[1:14:11] abraham isaac and jacob and all the
[1:14:13] heroes of faith he went to the same
[1:14:14] place
[1:14:15] he was in the same bracket
[1:14:18] as moses as daniel is all as joseph
[1:14:21] joseph was a perfect type of christ but
[1:14:24] because he was a man he had to fail in
[1:14:25] one place and he tried to get his dad to
[1:14:27] like pharaoh
[1:14:28] when they came into because he said i
[1:14:30] think it's uh uh don't say to them that
[1:14:33] you're shepherds because the shepherd is
[1:14:34] abomination to the egyptians he tried to
[1:14:37] get him to lie
[1:14:38] and that was the one against him
[1:14:40] but this thief
[1:14:42] this thief
[1:14:44] that was there
[1:14:46] by it being revealed to him
[1:14:49] he made him on path
[1:14:51] and both of the same category
[1:14:54] amen hallelujah amen same category as
[1:14:56] elijah same category as all the heroes
[1:14:58] of faith and put him into that category
[1:15:01] amen amen
[1:15:02] and so if you believe and i just i'm not
[1:15:05] about make-believe or trying to believe
[1:15:07] if something's anchored in your soul
[1:15:09] that this is not a church this is not a
[1:15:11] denomination this is not some theology
[1:15:13] this is god revealing himself
[1:15:16] in his word
[1:15:17] hallelujah what does that do that's
[1:15:19] imputed to you for righteousness
[1:15:21] amen amen that's right remember people
[1:15:24] aren't just partially righteous
[1:15:26] you're either you know brother brown
[1:15:27] makes a story he says he says there's no
[1:15:30] black white
[1:15:32] you know like uh you know it's either in
[1:15:34] or out
[1:15:35] amen
[1:15:36] there's not a drunk sober man
[1:15:38] it's either you're drunk or you're sober
[1:15:41] and so you're not partially righteous
[1:15:44] because we're talking about being
[1:15:45] righteous as in going in a rapture
[1:15:47] that's what i'm talking i'm not talking
[1:15:48] about the church going in the
[1:15:49] tribulation
[1:15:50] they have some righteousness because
[1:15:52] they receive
[1:15:54] eternal life and the white throne
[1:15:55] judgment but we're not here to go
[1:15:56] through a tribulation
[1:15:58] we don't gather to go to the great
[1:16:00] tribulation or to go to the judgment so
[1:16:02] when i talk about being righteous i'm
[1:16:03] talking about going in a rapture
[1:16:05] and if you go on a rapture there's
[1:16:06] nothing holding you down
[1:16:08] i mean there's no change of the enemy
[1:16:10] there's nothing holding you down
[1:16:12] amen we're free people
[1:16:14] amen we're free indeed
[1:16:16] hallelujah so god you know we just have
[1:16:19] to recognise if something in you
[1:16:21] and you sure you may have you fail
[1:16:24] and whatever more but you must remember
[1:16:27] those failures are not part of your
[1:16:28] inheritance you're right it doesn't
[1:16:30] matter if you're born with them
[1:16:32] family traits that are not of god must
[1:16:35] be broken today amen
[1:16:37] amen in the blood of jesus christ it
[1:16:39] doesn't matter if you say well my
[1:16:40] grandfather had this problem now my
[1:16:42] father had this problem now i've got
[1:16:43] this problem
[1:16:45] that may be so
[1:16:46] but it doesn't mean you have to keep
[1:16:48] that problem amen amen the blood of
[1:16:51] jesus christ cleanses us from all
[1:16:54] amen even things that you're inherited
[1:16:56] because whether we like it or not we
[1:16:58] inherited good things and bad things
[1:17:00] from our families and it wasn't their
[1:17:02] fault
[1:17:03] they are the best parents that they
[1:17:05] could be but we inherit bad things as
[1:17:07] well
[1:17:08] but god can come and i've seen it
[1:17:11] yes can break inherited curses amen amen
[1:17:15] amen he breaks things because he doesn't
[1:17:17] want you
[1:17:18] packing things that don't belong to you
[1:17:20] remember there's a will
[1:17:22] amen and he wants only for you to enjoy
[1:17:25] the contents of the will
[1:17:26] he doesn't want you to take any baggage
[1:17:28] that you may have brought to him
[1:17:30] amen as i've said a lamb is not a sheep
[1:17:33] is not a beast of burden
[1:17:35] you are not made to pack things that are
[1:17:37] not of you
[1:17:39] you say well i've tried to give it to
[1:17:40] him before
[1:17:42] that's satan lying to you
[1:17:45] trying to basically tell you he can't
[1:17:47] deliver you
[1:17:48] or he can't set you free
[1:17:50] that's what he's oh you've you've you
[1:17:52] you've tried to give it to him
[1:17:54] why hasn't he taken it from you and
[1:17:56] satan is basically saying he can't do it
[1:17:59] the blood is not enough
[1:18:02] amen
[1:18:04] friends there comes a time
[1:18:06] there comes a time
[1:18:08] everything must die
[1:18:10] that
[1:18:12] everything in you that is holding you
[1:18:14] back and remember you don't actually
[1:18:16] have to
[1:18:17] spend your life saying now
[1:18:19] what happened to me that made me this
[1:18:21] way
[1:18:22] because when god comes along
[1:18:25] you just walk with him walk with him
[1:18:26] whatever you doesn't matter you may be
[1:18:28] tearing yourself into on the inside and
[1:18:31] the devil may be just warring in your
[1:18:32] mind just walk with god amen walk with
[1:18:35] god above all and then god in his season
[1:18:38] remember jacob his whole life he was a
[1:18:40] supplanter
[1:18:42] amen and because he was blessed because
[1:18:44] that was through where christ would come
[1:18:47] i mean
[1:18:48] he
[1:18:49] he was actually blessed by being a
[1:18:51] supplanter
[1:18:53] but there came a time
[1:18:55] where he wrestled with god
[1:18:57] and he was no longer a supplanter is
[1:18:59] that you know to be known as a
[1:19:01] supplanter you don't want that
[1:19:03] reputation
[1:19:05] i mean no one would want a reputation
[1:19:07] you know cheating people out of things
[1:19:08] and doing shady deals and all these
[1:19:10] things you know no one would want that
[1:19:12] reputation
[1:19:13] but he was born with it
[1:19:16] but then there came the season remember
[1:19:18] where a supernatural camp and a natural
[1:19:20] camp came together amen and then he had
[1:19:22] a and then he met god face to face and
[1:19:25] wrestled with him
[1:19:26] hallelujah
[1:19:27] that's when god basically said
[1:19:30] i have to take this out of you jacob
[1:19:33] and to show i've taken it out of you i'm
[1:19:34] going to give you a new name
[1:19:36] hallelujah
[1:19:38] amen amen
[1:19:41] now
[1:19:42] we all know the story of 2nd kings
[1:19:44] chapter 6.
[1:19:46] i won't give a quiz what it is i'll just
[1:19:48] tell you
[1:19:50] but elisha
[1:19:52] elisha is there
[1:19:54] and there's war between israel and syria
[1:19:57] and the king of syria is sitting there
[1:19:59] in damascus and he says why is it that
[1:20:01] israel knows where our armies are going
[1:20:03] how is this how and then one guy says
[1:20:05] well there's elisha the prophet and he
[1:20:08] tells the king of israel even the
[1:20:10] secrets in your bed chamber
[1:20:12] so he says okay let's go find him
[1:20:15] he somehow thinks he can get this guy
[1:20:17] that's how ridiculous the devil is you
[1:20:19] know the devil the devil will actually
[1:20:21] afflict you and all that does is drive
[1:20:24] you to god
[1:20:25] that he will be defeated
[1:20:27] hallelujah
[1:20:28] if you allow it because some people they
[1:20:30] just bottle things up and they hold
[1:20:32] things in
[1:20:33] amen but there comes remember every son
[1:20:35] and daughter of god must be free
[1:20:37] amen and not just be free but walk in
[1:20:38] that liberty
[1:20:40] so now
[1:20:41] everything that the devil does you say
[1:20:43] the devil's on my back i'm going through
[1:20:45] this trial you should thank god the
[1:20:47] scripture says thank god because all it
[1:20:49] does is drive you closer to the lord
[1:20:51] himself
[1:20:55] and so and and i'll get somewhere with
[1:20:57] this and so elisha so so he sends an
[1:20:59] army go find go find elisha so they go
[1:21:02] to a city and they find out that he's in
[1:21:05] he's in he's in dothan
[1:21:07] so they go there
[1:21:08] and then and then his servant i think
[1:21:10] his servants gerhardia might be wrong
[1:21:12] he he goes out and he sees that the city
[1:21:15] is surrounded by the syrian army he
[1:21:18] begins to shake
[1:21:19] things are looking bad
[1:21:21] and then elisha is just sitting there oh
[1:21:23] i'm just i'm just adding a bit you know
[1:21:25] you know the prophet he you know he
[1:21:26] dramatizes stories to make them more
[1:21:28] real
[1:21:29] hey man that's why he does it
[1:21:31] i think so now so so elisha's just there
[1:21:34] but but he's not worried remember he's
[1:21:36] the one here's one who's a prophet he
[1:21:38] has the supernatural in him you know he
[1:21:41] is the word made flesh in his age
[1:21:43] so he's not too worried and then so now
[1:21:46] you know so so as servants all being
[1:21:48] worried how we're going to get out of
[1:21:49] this one you know how we're going to
[1:21:50] survive they're going to take the uh
[1:21:53] you know take the city and then elisha
[1:21:55] just prays he says but there's more for
[1:21:57] us than against us yes amen there's more
[1:22:00] there's so many more for us and against
[1:22:01] us
[1:22:02] and then so he just prays lord open the
[1:22:04] young man's eyes
[1:22:06] and then his eyes his spiritual hey his
[1:22:08] eyes his natural eyes were fine but his
[1:22:10] spiritual eyes were very much fixed shut
[1:22:13] so he wanted him to see open you know
[1:22:15] open his eyes he opened his eyes and all
[1:22:17] the hills around them were flame
[1:22:19] chariots of fire there was a
[1:22:21] supernatural army
[1:22:23] amen there
[1:22:25] wasn't that wonderful that same host is
[1:22:27] in here
[1:22:29] amen that same member of the battle is
[1:22:31] of the lord yes that's right i mean to
[1:22:33] that same host that was with elisha shaw
[1:22:35] with the bride of christ amen amen
[1:22:37] because you think
[1:22:39] you know the bride and of course there's
[1:22:41] been a bride from from from pentecost
[1:22:43] all the way down through you know all
[1:22:45] the believers of every age will come
[1:22:46] forth in the resurrection as the bride
[1:22:49] but this is
[1:22:51] i'll put the
[1:22:51] this way adam and eve were the pinnacle
[1:22:53] of god's first creation
[1:22:56] were they not it wasn't the frogs or the
[1:22:58] or the sheep or or the whales or the
[1:23:00] universe it was adam and eve that was
[1:23:02] the pinnacle of history
[1:23:07] amen amen and then so now god has been
[1:23:10] but remember adam and eve they fell so
[1:23:12] god said i'll but i will rebuild them
[1:23:14] again
[1:23:15] and so in the old testament that's why
[1:23:17] you see in the old testament you see
[1:23:19] jesus
[1:23:20] and joseph you see jesus and abraham you
[1:23:23] see jesus and isaac and moses and
[1:23:26] nehemiah and ezra and all the prophets
[1:23:28] you know you see jesus being reflected
[1:23:30] through these peoples amen but then now
[1:23:32] when he when when jesus was born
[1:23:34] everything was in the prophets partially
[1:23:37] came as the fullness of the godhead
[1:23:39] bodily was in christ amen amen so he was
[1:23:42] in moses of parties and jeremiah parties
[1:23:45] and you know all the prophets apart but
[1:23:46] now all those ones and that's why when
[1:23:49] you read i think it's matthew 16
[1:23:51] where jesus said to his disciples who do
[1:23:53] men say that i am
[1:23:55] they say well you're elias or jeremiah
[1:23:57] so one of the prophets because they when
[1:23:59] they when they read what that prophet
[1:24:01] did they saw it being lived out of jesus
[1:24:03] that's right
[1:24:04] in part in the prophet but now it's in
[1:24:06] the fullness in him
[1:24:09] and then so the man was rebuilt
[1:24:12] but that's not the whole story the woman
[1:24:14] eve has to be because the scripture says
[1:24:16] he is the second adam
[1:24:18] well if he's the second adam where's the
[1:24:20] second knee
[1:24:21] amen amen amen remember
[1:24:24] eve was in adam and then eve came in
[1:24:28] and then that was the whole thing yes
[1:24:30] right amen i could say
[1:24:33] what is it the
[1:24:34] i know there's some joke about the woman
[1:24:36] no the man is the test run and the
[1:24:38] woman's the perfection or something
[1:24:39] because she's the last thing that was
[1:24:41] made i know there's some jokes so i
[1:24:43] but you know
[1:24:46] sisters can say amen that's fine
[1:24:49] and so but but she was the last thing
[1:24:51] that was expressed
[1:24:53] amen adam was expressed male and female
[1:24:55] shawba was just in one body but then
[1:24:57] there was a mystery in adam which was
[1:24:59] eve that was now expressed and she was
[1:25:01] the last part of the creation that was
[1:25:03] expressed amen because remember it was
[1:25:04] all in god's mind and then he just spoke
[1:25:06] it out and then first you know the
[1:25:08] universe and everything in the creation
[1:25:10] and the earth and you know and it
[1:25:12] unfolded itself and finally there's adam
[1:25:14] and eve but evil is the last part
[1:25:17] amen eve was the last part that god was
[1:25:19] looking for that's right
[1:25:21] and now here we are
[1:25:23] because
[1:25:24] god i'll put you know
[1:25:26] here we are god rebuilt the man
[1:25:29] in jesus christ and now he's rebuilding
[1:25:31] the woman eve not as one but a
[1:25:33] multi-member body amen i mean through
[1:25:36] seven church ages
[1:25:37] but now there comes a time and you know
[1:25:39] i said this at camp about
[1:25:42] how god when he restores it's just like
[1:25:44] a wheat plant you put the wheat seed in
[1:25:47] the ground
[1:25:48] but then when when the stalk or the
[1:25:50] first blades come forth
[1:25:52] it doesn't look like the weed at all
[1:25:54] but as the plant begins to grow
[1:25:56] then finally you have the shook and then
[1:25:58] the sugar is the wheat and the shook
[1:26:00] looks like the wheat but it's not the
[1:26:02] wheat
[1:26:02] so it goes from a blade that doesn't
[1:26:04] look like the weed at all so something
[1:26:06] looks very close to the wheat but then
[1:26:08] in that shook is the wheat
[1:26:10] so you start with the lutherans yeah the
[1:26:12] yeah the reformation that doesn't look
[1:26:14] like pentecost at all
[1:26:16] i mean if you just compare the two but
[1:26:18] god is destroying god is working amen
[1:26:20] and then the anabaptists and all the
[1:26:21] different movements that came forth
[1:26:22] after that then the methodists and so on
[1:26:25] and then finally it comes down to a time
[1:26:27] and brother tim touched on it about the
[1:26:29] bright age now the bride is coming forth
[1:26:33] amen right he following me
[1:26:35] i mean so now he's actually saying here
[1:26:37] is the pinnacle
[1:26:39] of christianity
[1:26:41] amen it was shown very quickly in the
[1:26:44] ephesian age in the book of acts
[1:26:46] it was shown very quickly there but then
[1:26:48] it remember it says that you know you
[1:26:50] know the letter to the ephesian age
[1:26:52] he says but they'll have left thy first
[1:26:54] love
[1:26:56] repent you know and remember from where
[1:26:58] you fell so they'd already begin to fall
[1:27:01] so it's shown in maturity and that's why
[1:27:02] i see the book of acts how they operated
[1:27:04] and how the spirit led the people and so
[1:27:06] on that was god showing a mature bride
[1:27:09] amen amen but they had to go into the
[1:27:12] ground because god
[1:27:13] that was just god's program yeah so
[1:27:15] instead of a harvest there being
[1:27:17] gathered there it was actually that
[1:27:19] church was planted in the ground to come
[1:27:21] forth again amen amen are you following
[1:27:24] me this is all right so now that was
[1:27:26] demonstrated but now
[1:27:28] that had to die but then there had to
[1:27:30] come another
[1:27:31] crop at the end time
[1:27:33] that would be like them
[1:27:35] but not just looking at a close book
[1:27:37] because remember paul i think paul was
[1:27:39] already dead
[1:27:40] when when john wrote the book of
[1:27:42] revelation
[1:27:44] amen
[1:27:45] john wrote it in 1896 i think paul was
[1:27:47] already dead
[1:27:49] by then
[1:27:51] yeah
[1:27:52] so paul
[1:27:53] did not have the revelation that john
[1:27:55] had
[1:27:56] on something
[1:27:58] you see but he was the messengers of the
[1:28:00] age so that age actually did not and
[1:28:02] then when they looked at it
[1:28:04] you know i think even luther he didn't
[1:28:06] want the book of revelation and in the
[1:28:08] scripture i might be wrong but it was
[1:28:09] one of those reformers they didn't want
[1:28:10] to actually put the book of revelation
[1:28:11] in
[1:28:12] because i said it was just all symbolic
[1:28:14] and they didn't understand what it was
[1:28:16] i mean but there came a time
[1:28:19] when the will was open
[1:28:21] amen and when the will is opened that's
[1:28:23] why it's so important listen to that
[1:28:25] message
[1:28:26] you just don't try and hey sure it's
[1:28:28] good to try and do study and work it out
[1:28:30] but just listen just absorb it
[1:28:32] i mean just listen to the word and as
[1:28:34] you listen to it you become that word
[1:28:36] amen amen so just enjoy it and you'll
[1:28:38] become one with it
[1:28:40] and then so now it comes a time now
[1:28:42] where the will's opened and there's a
[1:28:44] person to receive that will hallelujah
[1:28:47] and so i'll say remember this is the
[1:28:49] last we're at the end of the church ages
[1:28:51] the same gospel is going to the jews
[1:28:53] so god no he he he built something
[1:28:57] greater and greater and greater
[1:28:59] amen you know
[1:29:00] and then so
[1:29:02] not to sound proud
[1:29:04] but we
[1:29:06] are the pinnacle and this is where i've
[1:29:07] been trying to get to because you've
[1:29:09] been following me the bride in this last
[1:29:11] days is the pinnacle of god's new
[1:29:13] creation amen
[1:29:15] amen
[1:29:17] so don't look at yourself as some
[1:29:19] struggling
[1:29:20] downtrodden
[1:29:21] second-class citizen that may be
[1:29:23] scraping to heaven
[1:29:24] that's not how god sees you
[1:29:27] that's not how god sees you
[1:29:29] but god has allowed it that you are
[1:29:31] actually wit and then and then when he
[1:29:33] saw you
[1:29:35] born into the earth he says good yeah
[1:29:37] but then when you're born again he says
[1:29:39] now it's very good
[1:29:40] now i can have a relationship with this
[1:29:42] woman that i've always wanted to love
[1:29:44] and adore
[1:29:45] hallelujah hallelujah so now it's very
[1:29:47] good we are the you know the bride and
[1:29:49] i'm talking about around the world
[1:29:52] that is what god is remember the second
[1:29:54] you know the prophet he makes a
[1:29:56] statement he says that the that the
[1:29:58] widow woman that elijah went to
[1:30:00] you know you know after there was the
[1:30:02] drought and everything in israel and he
[1:30:04] went to the book uh brook cherith and
[1:30:07] then that dried up eventually and says
[1:30:09] now go to the widow woman
[1:30:11] he actually says that that widow woman
[1:30:13] was the same caliber as the prophet
[1:30:17] amen now here's a gentile widow woman
[1:30:20] who's about to die because there's a
[1:30:22] drought in her country and god and his
[1:30:25] mind is looking at her saying
[1:30:27] she is the same caliber as elijah
[1:30:29] and here was elijah who stood against
[1:30:31] bale and all this false stuff and he you
[1:30:34] know you know you know he stood there
[1:30:36] strong flat-footed in the trial hey
[1:30:38] against all the pressure that jezebel
[1:30:40] could put you know
[1:30:42] and then he actually says this woman's
[1:30:44] the same caliber hallelujah hey all the
[1:30:46] other you know 7 000 didn't bow to bail
[1:30:49] but the rest of the nation did that's
[1:30:51] right amen so he was sent to a woman
[1:30:54] that would do the same thing he would
[1:30:56] have done
[1:30:58] amen
[1:30:59] and now here you
[1:31:00] are i'll put it this way
[1:31:03] you know
[1:31:04] don't let the devil i'm just saying
[1:31:05] these things says don't let the devil
[1:31:07] ever try and think
[1:31:08] you're just not going to make it
[1:31:11] you're just not worthy
[1:31:13] forget what he says
[1:31:15] i mean you just have to put it at jesus
[1:31:17] feet and just and just recognize god a
[1:31:20] few of my i can't make myself worthy
[1:31:22] you made me worthy you died for me on
[1:31:25] calvary i mean the sin offering the sin
[1:31:28] offering of ignorance in the scripture
[1:31:30] you know
[1:31:32] when the lamb is taken in the old
[1:31:34] testament to the priest to be given on
[1:31:36] the behalf of the worshipper
[1:31:39] as soon as the lamb comes into view the
[1:31:41] priest is there and and i heard you know
[1:31:44] you know cloverdale just had a winter
[1:31:45] camp so i've been listening to the um
[1:31:47] sermons it's been phenomenal but but
[1:31:49] brother kaije was talking about the sin
[1:31:51] offering he's one preaching and he said
[1:31:54] now as soon as the lamb so so he comes
[1:31:56] to worship he's got his lamb and he's
[1:31:59] maybe pulling it with a uh
[1:32:01] um you know a collar or whatever as soon
[1:32:04] as that lamb comes into the view of the
[1:32:05] priest
[1:32:07] the priest is not looking at the
[1:32:08] worshiper he's looking at the lamb
[1:32:10] because that lamb has to be perfect
[1:32:12] that's right i mean that lamb has to be
[1:32:13] without blemish otherwise it's not
[1:32:15] accepted so so the lamb so so the so the
[1:32:18] worshipper he actually just goes and the
[1:32:20] priest's mind he goes totally out of you
[1:32:24] he's not even in his thoughts anymore i
[1:32:26] mean he just he just studies the lamb is
[1:32:28] this lamb perfect
[1:32:31] and if the lamb is found without blemish
[1:32:33] i mean then he's offered in the place of
[1:32:34] the worshipper amen hallelujah and then
[1:32:37] we've had a perfect lamb amen amen we
[1:32:39] have a perfect lamb today
[1:32:41] hallelujah that god doesn't look at you
[1:32:43] or your situation or what you think you
[1:32:46] are god just looked at the lamb
[1:32:48] and he goes to lamb up calvary
[1:32:50] hallelujah and he went through all of
[1:32:51] the hall of critics and you know your
[1:32:53] pilots judgment all these things he says
[1:32:56] i find no fault in this man amen and he
[1:32:59] was actually confessing what jesus what
[1:33:01] god was saying about jesus
[1:33:03] amen i found no i find no fault in my
[1:33:05] son
[1:33:06] he's a perfect one amen hallelujah
[1:33:09] so don't don't look at you
[1:33:12] god doesn't look at you
[1:33:14] he looks at the lamb
[1:33:16] if you if it's been revealed that the
[1:33:18] lamb died for you
[1:33:21] what does that mean god doesn't look at
[1:33:22] you he looks at the lamb
[1:33:24] hallelujah
[1:33:26] amen is that okay
[1:33:28] he doesn't look at you you know you just
[1:33:30] think if you're a priest and you're
[1:33:32] sincere
[1:33:33] you wouldn't take any animal amen you'd
[1:33:36] be studying that you would really you
[1:33:38] know men they just focus on stuff
[1:33:41] amen you ever been in that situation you
[1:33:43] just you just focus on and everything
[1:33:45] just kind of dims out
[1:33:47] you multiply that by a few million and
[1:33:50] now be a priest
[1:33:52] because if he does his job wrong
[1:33:54] he's going to be held accountable
[1:33:56] and god remember remember
[1:33:59] those priests had to live a perfect life
[1:34:00] otherwise they would have been stoned
[1:34:02] without mercy amen so he had to make
[1:34:05] sure
[1:34:06] that that lamb was examined thoroughly
[1:34:10] and if you ever examine something
[1:34:11] thoroughly everything else just fades
[1:34:13] away
[1:34:14] hallelujah
[1:34:16] we have a perfect lamp
[1:34:18] if it's been revealed to you that he is
[1:34:20] the lamb of god
[1:34:22] amen then he he died for you
[1:34:27] hallelujah
[1:34:28] now
[1:34:30] so elisha
[1:34:34] he caused he prayed that that man young
[1:34:37] man's eyes would be open
[1:34:40] and we have to
[1:34:41] our eyes need to be open sometimes too
[1:34:44] amen is this okay i'm just i'm just kind
[1:34:47] of going where we're going and so now
[1:34:49] god
[1:34:50] god allows us
[1:34:52] to be in a trial
[1:34:54] to go through things
[1:34:56] because god wants us to know who's with
[1:34:58] us yes
[1:34:59] remember it's more than just angels
[1:35:02] the angel lord and camp's about those
[1:35:03] who fear him
[1:35:06] and so you take shadrach meshach and
[1:35:08] abednego
[1:35:12] they were going to the fiery furnace
[1:35:14] no doubt they had pressure before
[1:35:17] but now really he came to crunch yeah
[1:35:20] amen
[1:35:21] when that when that big
[1:35:22] idol was was raised up there in the
[1:35:24] plains there in babylon
[1:35:27] and and here came here came the crutch
[1:35:30] are they going to bow or are they going
[1:35:32] to
[1:35:33] are they going to burn
[1:35:35] amen so the enemy ratcheted up the
[1:35:38] pressure
[1:35:39] remember the pressure and jacob's life
[1:35:40] was ratcheted up that's right he's about
[1:35:42] to go see esau that's right
[1:35:44] amen so now here was he was these three
[1:35:48] and there's no record of any other
[1:35:49] hebrew standing up
[1:35:51] no doubt they would have had church they
[1:35:53] would have had a prayer meeting before
[1:35:54] then it would have taken a while for the
[1:35:56] idol to be built
[1:35:58] amen they didn't just slap it up
[1:35:59] overnight it would have been it would
[1:36:01] have been building and they would have
[1:36:02] said okay what's this thing
[1:36:04] while the king's written a law that when
[1:36:05] that built and everyone blows a trumpet
[1:36:07] everyone has to battle it
[1:36:09] okay
[1:36:10] and now remember the king has supreme
[1:36:12] power so what is decreed is going to
[1:36:13] happen
[1:36:14] and then so they would have had they
[1:36:16] would have prayer meetings about it and
[1:36:18] no doubt they would have preached about
[1:36:19] it
[1:36:20] amen yes they would have gone to the you
[1:36:23] know because they had because remember
[1:36:24] daniel he read the scrolls that jeremiah
[1:36:27] wrote that's right yeah so they had they
[1:36:29] had the work
[1:36:31] and they would have no doubt read
[1:36:32] deuteronomy or you know your law of
[1:36:34] moses thou shalt not have other any
[1:36:36] other gods before me shall not worship
[1:36:38] any graveyard rumors they would have
[1:36:40] preached and prayed about these things
[1:36:42] and said right brothers
[1:36:44] hey it was just the three of them in
[1:36:45] daniel in the whole kingdom
[1:36:47] that was standing on the word
[1:36:50] amen sometimes we think we're in the
[1:36:51] minority we know the minority american
[1:36:53] one with god is the majority amen i mean
[1:36:56] you may be the only person in your
[1:36:57] family but if god is anchored in your
[1:36:59] soul that god he is jesus christ is the
[1:37:02] same yesterday today and forever
[1:37:04] you're the majority in their family
[1:37:07] and you know they would have they would
[1:37:08] have prayed they would have read the
[1:37:09] scripture but now came the crunch time
[1:37:12] now came the time when the idol was
[1:37:13] there the people were there the
[1:37:15] musicians were there what were they
[1:37:16] going to do
[1:37:18] remember these people
[1:37:19] those three didn't have the holy ghost
[1:37:21] they don't have the victory that we have
[1:37:23] but they stood upon the word amen and
[1:37:25] then there's the trumpet
[1:37:27] then everyone probably very piously bow
[1:37:30] down
[1:37:31] and they stand there
[1:37:33] as all people
[1:37:35] amen
[1:37:36] and i don't know how it happened but the
[1:37:38] guards came and grabbed them dragged up
[1:37:40] before the king he would have been
[1:37:41] sitting there because remember it was
[1:37:42] like the it was the dedication day
[1:37:45] it was the big day
[1:37:47] so the king would have been sitting up
[1:37:48] on his throne in a big pavilion all
[1:37:51] part you know all looking splendor and
[1:37:52] all the robes and all these things
[1:37:54] dragged him before the king
[1:37:57] he said
[1:37:58] why didn't you bow
[1:38:01] and they said oh good king live forever
[1:38:05] but be known unto you we will not about
[1:38:07] anything you've made
[1:38:09] amen
[1:38:10] even if our god doesn't deliver us we're
[1:38:12] still going into the fire yes now
[1:38:14] remember trials are for a reason amen
[1:38:17] amen
[1:38:18] and so they were bound
[1:38:20] and so god i mean so the king had that
[1:38:22] furnace but burning seven times harder
[1:38:25] than normal
[1:38:26] and we live in an age that is burning
[1:38:28] seven times more than normal amen
[1:38:31] there's pressure in this age that if we
[1:38:32] went back you know if we got transported
[1:38:34] a hundred years ago
[1:38:36] we would just sit there and go oh
[1:38:39] it's so easy to be christians in this
[1:38:40] place amen amen all the woman
[1:38:43] dressed modestly amen there are no
[1:38:46] billboards of naked men or woman
[1:38:48] the lust spirit all the all these demons
[1:38:51] that have been released in the state
[1:38:52] they weren't back there that's right so
[1:38:53] we'd go there say this is oh i love them
[1:38:58] so the furnace has been burning seven
[1:39:00] times harder that's right amen
[1:39:02] hallelujah right and then so but they
[1:39:04] said even if god does not deliver us we
[1:39:06] will not bow hey amen hey mensa even
[1:39:09] remember so the devil comes along your
[1:39:11] way and says look is this and i put this
[1:39:13] on you and you're fighting this i would
[1:39:16] say this even if you're never delivered
[1:39:19] i would not bow to him
[1:39:21] i would not bow to satan in his devices
[1:39:24] hallelujah even if you're because he
[1:39:25] says you're never going to be delivered
[1:39:27] i'd say well i don't care
[1:39:28] i'm serving god amen i'm serving the
[1:39:30] lord for me in my house i'm serving the
[1:39:32] lord
[1:39:34] hallelujah remember just walk with him
[1:39:35] don't get fixated on the problem
[1:39:38] because if you look at the problem then
[1:39:40] your focus is on the problem but if your
[1:39:42] focus is upon the word have your focus
[1:39:44] is upon the lord
[1:39:46] amen
[1:39:48] whose focus is stuck on just say if you
[1:39:50] broke your arm
[1:39:52] does your focus stay on the arm once
[1:39:54] it's been mended
[1:39:56] oh my arm's broken my arms no you look
[1:39:58] at the cast don't you you look at the
[1:40:00] medicine that you've been given
[1:40:02] amen

[1:40:05] look at the things that make you better
[1:40:07] amen amen
[1:40:09] don't look at the injury
[1:40:11] it may be a spiritual wound or something
[1:40:13] you know or whatever it is the devil's
[1:40:15] trying to derail you in some way some
[1:40:17] mind battle don't look at the mind
[1:40:19] battle
[1:40:20] look at the medicine
[1:40:22] amen look at him
[1:40:24] don't look at your problem
[1:40:26] because if you look at your problem

[1:40:46] in things got real jonah you're in the
[1:40:48] bottom of the ocean yeah but he said no

[1:41:00] serving god
[1:41:03] it yeah it's all for my good anyway
[1:41:05] god is showing me a part of himself in
[1:41:06] this trial
[1:41:08] hallelujah so shadrach meshach and
[1:41:10] abednego they're bound up
[1:41:12] they're being led into the furnace
[1:41:14] and they have in their hearts hey if we

[1:42:39] reason we're unhappy is because there's
[1:42:40] another world hallelujah that we've been
[1:42:43] called to go to i mean israel was
[1:42:45] stirred up and bonded here in egypt they

[1:43:16] the prime of your fitness and prime of
[1:43:18] life
[1:43:19] this thing is a pest house
[1:43:21] this thing oh yeah this body that we
[1:43:23] look after so much this is a pest house
[1:43:26] hallelujah it wars against you
[1:43:29] your your flesh was against your spirit
[1:43:32] amen and your flesh remembers things
[1:43:34] that you used to do and it still wants
[1:43:35] to do them
[1:43:37] amen hey amen amen because this flesh
[1:43:41] your memory brother tim brought it out
[1:43:43] your your spirit is your mind
[1:43:47] amen but the soul is the real you
[1:43:51] so the devil comes into your spirit and
[1:43:52] he tries to say you think these things
[1:43:54] fine amen
[1:43:57] but god
[1:43:59] but the real you
[1:44:01] even if you agree with this guy
[1:44:03] the ruyu actually says that is not me
[1:44:05] amen
[1:44:06] amen amen because the son or daughter of
[1:44:09] god remember we are part we are part of
[1:44:12] the word
[1:44:13] amen a son is actually part is an
[1:44:16] expression of the father
[1:44:18] yeah so if we're sons or daughters of
[1:44:20] god we are expression of our father amen
[1:44:22] amen amen
[1:44:24] when when his life comes in then we
[1:44:26] express him amen we don't actually
[1:44:28] express our individual selves we express
[1:44:30] our father
[1:44:31] the same characteristics nature
[1:44:33] everything we express him
[1:44:35] amen so now as so so if he is the word
[1:44:38] remember in the beginning was the word
[1:44:40] and the word was flesh i mean and the
[1:44:42] word was with god the word was god then
[1:44:44] that word became flesh and dwelt among
[1:44:46] it saint john 1 verse 1 verse 14
[1:44:49] amen
[1:44:51] so if we are part of him
[1:44:53] then the only thoughts that really
[1:44:55] belong to us
[1:44:57] is the will
[1:44:59] amen
[1:45:00] and that's why this the word of god can
[1:45:03] actually reach down to the soul of a son
[1:45:05] or daughter of god is because there's
[1:45:07] something in there that says that's me
[1:45:09] amen that can identify
[1:45:13] you know before god came your way you
[1:45:15] tried to do all kinds of things
[1:45:17] i'll try sport i'll try parties i'll try
[1:45:20] drinking
[1:45:22] i'll try a woman i'll try whatever it is
[1:45:25] amen
[1:45:27] you know there's our man things but in
[1:45:30] this inner son or daughter of god
[1:45:32] there's something in them crying out
[1:45:34] amen that's not satisfied with whatever
[1:45:36] i'll try business i'll try money i'll
[1:45:38] try
[1:45:39] fame whatever it is but there's
[1:45:40] something in them that says
[1:45:42] this is not really what i'm looking for
[1:45:45] amen yeah but when the word comes their
[1:45:48] way
[1:45:49] something in them says this is me
[1:45:52] amen
[1:45:53] you're following me
[1:45:55] so
[1:45:56] how do you you know you know brother
[1:45:57] braham's asked a question i think i
[1:45:59] think brother tim even read it or
[1:46:00] mentioned it
[1:46:02] someone asked brother branham how do i
[1:46:03] know i'm thinking god's thoughts how do
[1:46:06] i know that you know he says well his
[1:46:08] thoughts are his word
[1:46:10] that's how you know you're thinking
[1:46:11] god's thoughts
[1:46:12] so if you're thinking thoughts i'm never
[1:46:15] gonna make it
[1:46:16] how am i gonna
[1:46:17] how can i even call myself a christian
[1:46:20] amen
[1:46:21] you know i'm just never gonna be free of
[1:46:23] this thing
[1:46:24] that's not god's thoughts
[1:46:28] amen
[1:46:29] someone say amen
[1:46:30] is that right if god said whom the son
[1:46:32] is set free is free indeed
[1:46:34] my peace that i give you not as the
[1:46:36] world gives
[1:46:37] amen amen and then you know but then the
[1:46:41] devil tries to yeah but then if you
[1:46:42] agree with those thoughts
[1:46:45] amen then it can actually take hold of
[1:46:48] you
[1:46:49] remember you can't think
[1:46:50] thoughts
[1:46:52] you can't stop thoughts coming into your
[1:46:53] mind
[1:46:55] but it's what you do with them that's
[1:46:56] what's right
[1:46:58] amen it's what do you do you let it
[1:47:00] build up
[1:47:01] or do you just kick it out
[1:47:05] amen
[1:47:06] because if you let it build up
[1:47:08] you know why do people become depressed
[1:47:10] i
[1:47:11] i suffered depression for about three
[1:47:13] four years
[1:47:14] at university i know what it's like
[1:47:17] and it is a spirit
[1:47:19] but then how do but if people keep just
[1:47:22] looking at well i actually feel i feel
[1:47:24] down and i'm down and things are bad
[1:47:27] you know if you keep meditating upon
[1:47:29] those things
[1:47:30] then you just feed that thing it becomes
[1:47:32] louder and louder and louder
[1:47:35] amen but if you if you even if you feel
[1:47:38] that way because it's a real thing
[1:47:40] but if you feel that way but you say no
[1:47:42] my hope is in the lord
[1:47:43] he is my strength he's my deliverer yes
[1:47:46] amen i don't know when he may do it but
[1:47:48] i'm just going to walk with him amen
[1:47:50] amen that begins to undo all those
[1:47:52] things amen
[1:47:54] amen
[1:47:56] now
[1:47:59] i just read this a little close
[1:48:03] now this isn't when their eyes are open
[1:48:08] now they didn't understand what he was
[1:48:09] talking about but yet their minds they
[1:48:11] didn't know what to believe this is the
[1:48:13] two on the way to emmaus
[1:48:17] now there's just many people like that
[1:48:19] today there's many people like that in
[1:48:21] in in belmont beaumont today
[1:48:24] they don't know what to believe but do
[1:48:26] you know what they did they did the
[1:48:28] wisest thing any man could do they
[1:48:30] invited him in
[1:48:32] as it's on the way to mass he was going
[1:48:34] to go you know on woodsby but but they
[1:48:36] constrained him no come come stay with
[1:48:38] us
[1:48:39] so they invited him in
[1:48:43] that's it that's it that's then and only
[1:48:46] then he can reveal himself when he's
[1:48:48] invited to come in
[1:48:49] welcome him and say lord jesus i know
[1:48:51] the scripture says that i might not
[1:48:53] understand it but come into my heart i
[1:48:55] want to accept you i want to believe you
[1:48:57] then manifest yourself to me notice they
[1:49:00] invited him
[1:49:02] they invited him in now they couldn't
[1:49:04] explain it
[1:49:05] they didn't understand what he was
[1:49:07] talking about it was all mixed up to
[1:49:08] them they couldn't understand it but yet
[1:49:11] they said invite constrained him you
[1:49:13] must come and he said no
[1:49:15] i've got to be going on
[1:49:17] oh but lord you must come and you must
[1:49:19] come in and constrain him until called
[1:49:21] upon him until he had to go in that's
[1:49:23] the way you do and then when he gets
[1:49:25] inside that's when he can reveal himself
[1:49:28] he can make himself known when inside
[1:49:32] amen notice how he did it after his
[1:49:34] resurrection the true promised word see
[1:49:36] they did not realize who he was but once
[1:49:38] inside of them then he opened their eyes
[1:49:40] that way when he got inside the building
[1:49:43] with them there he opened their eyes
[1:49:45] after he got inside he opened their eyes
[1:49:47] what not just took them by the hand open
[1:49:50] let your eyes come open their eyes were
[1:49:52] open anyhow physically he said done
[1:49:56] i mean i mean dothan rather where where
[1:49:59] elisha was there in the sirians see his
[1:50:01] eyes are open but spiritually his eyes
[1:50:03] were closed
[1:50:05] see and then not only that but then
[1:50:07] remember elisha prayed caused the
[1:50:08] sirians to be blind
[1:50:11] and then so he steps out who are you
[1:50:13] looking for
[1:50:14] elisha the prophet
[1:50:16] i'll show you where he is and he's
[1:50:17] talking to them
[1:50:19] you gotta read the story so physically
[1:50:22] they could see but spiritually they were
[1:50:23] blind
[1:50:25] amen
[1:50:26] invite him in
[1:50:28] where listen
[1:50:31] last year was a hard year
[1:50:33] amen
[1:50:36] if satan has his way he will cause us to
[1:50:39] have another hard year
[1:50:41] amen
[1:50:43] if satan has his way
[1:50:46] but we need to
[1:50:47] by god's grace press on
[1:50:50] and don't let the devil rob us of any
[1:50:52] blessing
[1:50:54] amen amen amen don't let him rob you
[1:50:57] because hard times will come
[1:50:59] trials will come
[1:51:01] misunderstandings will come
[1:51:04] but if you look to him
[1:51:06] amen
[1:51:08] jacob was facing the greatest trial
[1:51:10] of his life
[1:51:13] and he ended up a new man
[1:51:16] what about you
[1:51:18] amen
[1:51:20] we
[1:51:22] we must
[1:51:23] take everything that belongs to us amen
[1:51:25] and if there's anything holding you back
[1:51:28] you get rid of it
[1:51:30] amen amen if there's anything in your
[1:51:32] life and god actually says well you need
[1:51:35] to you need to give this up
[1:51:38] you got to be willing to give it up amen
[1:51:40] amen
[1:51:41] because god just doesn't take things
[1:51:43] from you to leave you without it he's
[1:51:45] not like a
[1:51:47] mean older sibling that just takes a toy
[1:51:49] off a younger one
[1:51:52] he does that because he wants to do more
[1:51:54] why did why did we start there with that
[1:51:56] opening scripture about the separation
[1:51:58] between jacob and his father-in-law
[1:52:00] because there had to be that separation
[1:52:03] he had to leave his land where his
[1:52:06] uh wives were born go back to his
[1:52:08] inheritance
[1:52:10] and then there had to be a separation of
[1:52:12] the families then the angels of god came
[1:52:14] amen then he wrestled with god himself
[1:52:17] and he was changed
[1:52:19] you see
[1:52:21] i mean we have some musicians to come
[1:52:24] but we just just press on friends
[1:52:27] press on whatever comes whatever comes
[1:52:30] just walk with god
