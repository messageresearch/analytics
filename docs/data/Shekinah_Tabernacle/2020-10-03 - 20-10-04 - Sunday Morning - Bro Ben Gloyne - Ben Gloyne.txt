you to where you are now amen hallelujah hallelujah you may take your seats and brother david i'll invite you to come and give your testimony [Music] thanks i won't be leaping around thanks thanks i'll stand back slightly morning all right unusual for me to be here i don't seem to get around there much these days i used to do a lot of travelling and fellowships here and there but these days the wife and i are just happily sitting in mastodon and still enjoying the things of the lord but uh i just thinking um i actually came to the lord 53 years ago and things were so different then they were absolutely in a different world what it is now um anglicans i was an anglican very very strong anglican and uh not that i knew anything but uh church was that's all it was church and whatever the minister said that was it and um wife and i got married in 1963 down back a wee while we had our 57th wedding anniversary the other day um and we we were we were what you might say interested christian people um we i was an anglican and my wife was a presbyterian so i said well i tell you what it's no good you're going to the presbyterian church for me going the african church so i will change and become a presbyterian so uh yeah you know what if you do those take the lessons and all the rest to become a presbyterian and um any anyway so hey can we just move this back a little bit brother am i loud enough for you all to hear all right well yeah that's good that's good yeah anyway uh actually just before we go any further could we just pray dear lord this morning oh jesus look what i feel you presence here hallelujah my lord my savior lord as i share these things this morning they mean so much to me because you are my life outside of you lord i have nothing oh jesus may your presence just touch everyone this morning what a savior lord i just pray that you just forgive me for my ways and may the brethren be blessed lord because we're glorifying you it's nothing to do with us it's you lord may we just continue to have your way thank you for that i just ask it now in jesus name amen amen thank you lord you know just thinking down through the years brethren you know one of the hardest things for anybody particularly for a man has to humble himself you know here today oh i'm so humble i'm so humble i got no idea what it's like no idea what it's like i've shared my testimony with i know hundreds maybe even thousands of people and just about every time i just i end up in tears because it's real jesus is real amen you know this this whole bible is what revealing jesus christ he is the mystery of god revealed amen today anyway uh as i say the wife and i got married in 63 and we used to we used to read the bible every night i had no idea what it was all about but we read the bible every night and uh in those days if you can if you can just what what i want to try and say today is sort of listen to what i say because in those days there was no such thing as a message there was no william branham it was billy graham came to new zealand and crowds went to here billy graham my wife went to billy graham and she was saved under billy graham's ministry and so she was a christian i mean it was just how crazy it was i was an anglican and i thought i served god you know i can't just i was a good man i didn't do anything wrong sort of thing and but my wife was a uh what do you call those uh youth for christ youth for christ and anyway so i remember one christmas i think might have been just about before married i think and she wanted to go to this this christian camp and so i always remember that why can't i and i said dear i said i will drive you to the camp and i will leave you there but don't you dare ask me to come in so i drove her to the camp stopped the car as she got and the way i went i just was not wanted to be and because i've been trained by my mother particularly a very very strong woman and she said david she said don't ever let anybody get any of these crank religions just stay away from them have nothing to do with them because anglican church is the only way to go and um i went to massey college in 1957 i was there for a year studying poultry farming of all things and uh anyway um there were some guys there had a prayer group and it just just in in me i sort of just sort of thought oh i'd like to be i'd like to be identified with something like that so i went along and i used to sit there in a cold sweat because if they dare ask me to pray i wouldn't know what to do but but there was just something in me i said i like the idea but anyway um we used the wife and i used to read the bible every night and uh if you can just understand in those days there was the anglican church presbyterian church that's all there was and then through circumstances we moved to just outside of gisborne on a farm just outside of gisborne i was meant to be a technician it was a it was a bit of a waste of time i became a farm labourer basically and anyway things things didn't work out things weren't going very well and we had some friends that we'd met previously and and why carawana when we were there and uh they're a lovely people so that they they moved to a podiky and so we one night one weekend we went to stay with them and this lady called vera porter uh she uh she sort of said she said i've just been to an anglican baptism and she said you know in your book your book it says there be baptized and then i uh be baptized and you'll receive the holy ghost she said why don't they leave the name of jesus christ out i said i don't know whatever they say is right and of course we had quite a big discussion and william branham came into the discussion but i sort of said no no no such thing billy graham's the only man of god that the world knows about no anyway so then they got in touch with people called searles and gizman do any of you here know the cells at all red shell okay okay yeah well anyway uh so i got a ring on the phone one day and um guy said god bless you brother this is regell i said oh yeah yeah she said he said we have fellowship every week you know and we'd love you to come along and have fellowship with us so i said thank you very much put the phone down i said to the wife i said no thank you uh but anyway so it so happened i shouldn't be rambling on but it so happened that uh the couple from a poetic came over to our place for a weekend and they wanted to convert us and and they sort of said you know william brown am i no not interested in that stuff she said well what about t.l osborn i said i'll tell you what i said i watched my tv program on saturday night and i said i'll tell you what you have t.l osman for half an hour and then you watch my program far for now hour so they did that so but it meant nothing to me just just there's nothing us anyway so um once again as i say when you think about it practically nobody in new zealand knew anything about william branham there's no such thing as a message or anything and we were just ordinary people that went to church on sunday on sundays and uh anyway so um then we got the when the couple came to see us like the next morning they said oh uh why don't you just come in the meats at that reach shell and we said no i suppose we can't we all get out of it so yeah so we went to gisborne because we lived out of guzman went to gisborne and uh oh and these two old guys come out uh of the house and oh no god bless you this is rich shirl oh big man he was i suppose you remember and another brother called jim hill i don't know anybody remember jim hill at all no okay brother jim anyway hey god bless you god bless you i thought man we're getting involved in this queer outfit and but they were having a meeting just like here this morning and so we got invited into the meeting and i didn't understand anything about it really except i was amazed that one of the sisters sung in tongues never heard it before never just weird weird and and then at the end of the service there was a little boy called john priby and he it was nine months old and he had colic and so they prayed for him well my wife and i had never seen anything like this before it was so amazing or unusual and anyway so we stayed for dinner actually that chap john prieby now is a good um um what should i say what's one of these latest beliefs down in alexandra i saw him just a couple of years ago and we had some time together um but anyway so he's he's healthy um but anyway um we stayed for lunch and then we drove away oh and actually read searle got my wife and i and he talked to us about the revelation of jesus christ and i sort of kept on saying what is he going on about i have no idea why is he pushing this subject anyway so we drove away and i said to my wife i remember going up the hill back to i said dear i said they're nice people but i said we're not going to have anything to do with them we're just not interested in that sort of carry-on okay right so anyway nothing much else happened but then then sort of things went from bad to worse on the farm and oh the far the bickering between the different men on the farm i rosemary and i happened to be in the meat in the sandwich in a way but anyway um on the uh 29th of january 1967. uh we're getting at the bed on the friday thursday night and um rosemary said to me oh she said i'm thinking you're getting baptized i said what she said i'm thinking of getting baptized i said if god wants me to be baptized he's gonna have to tell me full stop okay right so anyway uh that was the end of that but then the next day we went we did our shopping friday night when did our shopping in gisborne and put out and we had two little maori children foster children as well as our little boy and so we got our groceries got our fish sorry got our fish and chips take them home and then and then and we got some groceries from the supermarket and while we were getting this stuff packed for us there was a young sandy head kid there packing out groceries and he said oh he said um why don't you go around to mum and dad's for tea this is howard's earl and uh he was i think 16 or 17 just a young kid and uh oh i said no no no no i couldn't very well tell him we didn't want to go around there um but anyway i said go on go on he said look they'd love to have you and we felt like sort of paupers going into the king's house because they were had a big home nine kids and anyway so no no no no no no they're in the finisher i said to rosemary we're in a bit of a spot aren't we and uh oh okay so we better go around so we went round to their place and and um they had our fashion ships and once again reg started talking the revelation of jesus christ that what's the church built on oh here we go again we're going to have to listen to this again anyway so okay so we had that and then we and we left and um this is where uh things changed because as we are leaving and i'm telling you again nobody knew anything about red's uh brother branham and anyway as we were leaving rich just said oh he said oh by the way brother here's a couple of books you might just like to look at them sometimes oh okay throw them in the car so anyway we got home and i said i said the rosemary well i suppose we'd better have a look at these books see what's this one here beyond the curtain of time oh okay so we started reading it and as i say all these things were me like going into a foreign country a foreign land that i've never experienced or seen anything before and uh anyway um started reading this book before we would put the kids to bed and then started reading this book and uh oh a sort of a strange feeling came over me and i sort of thought i've never experienced anything like this it's and i've read the first couple of pages and i could tell rosemary was a little bit emotional about it too so i said we'll put it aside but we'll read it some other time and um so anyway so we went to bed and um we were just just i say it again we knew nothing i knew nothing about any spiritual i'd never even heard the word praise is so unusual because i knew absolutely i was in a foreign country i never knew anything about it and anyway so we're just lying there and then this presence came and i started swelling up and swelling up and yeah i said what's going on what's going on ah and and and then a sound and didn't know what it was and i and i sat up rosemary said what's wrong i said i just feel like god's going to speak once again not having any idea or anything and um so anyway we talked about it for a few minutes and then we laid back down go to sleep and lying there and suddenly this um sort of like a wave coming in at the beach a ripple came over me and uh i wanted to weep and i thought don't be ridiculous listen i say again about being humble a fully grown man lying in bed beside his wife and he's going to start weeping you can't absolutely gratificate it can't happen it can't happen that went away and i laid there and about 10 minutes later oh she came back again i can't i can't and anyway so oh i started to get really worked up by then i didn't know what was going on and anyway so then about the well a few minutes later came again and i just had to let go and i wept and wept but all the time i didn't know what it was all about i didn't understand anything it was strange no voice or anything nobody told me anything and anyway i just lay there weeping i said dear i said get that lady on the phone happens 11 at night get that lady on the phone and tell her i want to be baptized now even though i didn't understand what was going on something had happened in me yeah and anyway um she rang i mean lisa this is actually what happened she rang raised my wife rang because old crank telephones in those days and she rang and i heard her and she said and vera the woman said what's wrong and rosemary says david and and vera said what's wrong she said he's crying and i honestly believe when i say this i'm sure i remember thinking get an ambulance because there's something wrong with me i can't understand what it is anyway but the thing about it was vera said praise the lord and i thought all the ridiculous things to say but anyway they were on shift at the time so they couldn't come so she said well the only thing i could suggest is ring ridge seal so red chill david wants to be baptized now and he's and he's weeping and uh as i say all this is so strange i couldn't understand what was going on but i i can't remember then what happened for the rest of the night but anyway we decided we'd get baptised following saturday but i know the next morning brother and sister i tell you as plain as a nose on my face i've been reading this bible for four years i had no idea what it was all about and i came down to breakfast next morning opened the bible wow i've never seen this before yeah and from 53 years ago they're still the same this is this is listen see it's it's the it's the spirit on the word yes sir yes sir today we get a lot of people saying oh i know the word i'm in the word i'm in the word no no it's the life in the word you know it's the holy ghost is the life of the church amen without the holy ghost it's all dead i don't care and i feel today when i look and see how things have changed um and over the years now it's just common for people to say you know oh you're in the message oh yeah i'm in the message i know oh you know this you know i tell you what i know one thing that's jesus christ and crucified and from that time 19 january 20th of 1967 my life changed forever and i just in a way i suppose so many people must have got embarrassed with me because every time i got up to speak there i'd be bawling my eyes out i love jesus he's just so wonderful because something had changed in me and so the following saturday i always remember again we went out to the river and there was about 20 of us both of us and my wife got baptized first in the name of the lord jesus christ and then brother i think his brother reg said um oh brother if you like to say anything so i got up there i opened my bible and it was a oh oh psalm 27 the lord is the my light of my salvation and i bawl my eyes out just so real absolutely and in the morning after that experience on the saturday morning i had to go out and milk the cow and because we were on a farm there uh and i remember walking out with a bucket of walking out the paddock there and the presence of the lord was so real i was bawling away and i said lord just leave me alone i can't take anymore it was just so real and i had no idea then just what it meant but how what it is to know jesus that's you know brethren outside of that you've got nothing exactly right and i feel today i've heard so many i i don't know i've heard thousands of sermons i suppose in my time and i just feel sadly there are so many i've got it all figured out in here but i've never met him that's what it's all about you know and i just even in the last days and weeks i've been sitting at home and weeping just sitting there weeping at the reality of my savior what he did for me outside of knowing him brethren you've got nothing i don't care how super duper you are but to know him when you it's just it's something that's way beyond any understanding and i was just reading brother branham there the day before yesterday i recommended his greatest sermons ever christ the mystery of god revealed and it's something brethren that that i believe you can only understand it by the spirit and brother branham just said a quote there i've got it written down but i'll try and quote it he said god became from god to become me yeah when you think about that it's just mine it's more than mind-blowing to realize the god of creation became me he he took upon himself my sin everything about me and i believe one of the sad things today brethren as so many people think i'm a great person i'm a good person i'm this i'm that amazing i'll tell you what one glimpse of calvary brother and you realize hallelujah brother branham just another sermon there and becky had said to him about something how important we are he said give me a glass of water yeah glass of water becky or whoever just stick your finger in the water yeah now pull it out the hole that's left that's how important you are see we're nothing absolutely we're nothing and when you come to think that god creation came and laid down his life suffered suffered in a way that no human being could ever suffer why because of your sins because of my sins when i was born in this world i was born a sinner i did not commit sin every one of us and that's where i believe this this wonderful message that we believe if you only just i say to so many people read your bible and you'll see how that in the beginning god created everything perfect absolutely wonderful perfect creation and he placed his first son in that creation then he realized his first son was lonely he said it's not good that a man should be alone and so what did he do he took a rib out of the side of adam he caused the deep sleep to come upon him and he took a rib out and he made a woman and i just quite often think brethren just imagine how it was for adam who'd been living for it and how long he'd been living on his own and one day he's presented with a wife it's the typing of what's coming one day soon but anyway then adam and eve happy together but then what happened this is the whole key of to me is the whole key of the bible the blood cell god's perfect blood cell in adam and eve was broken and from then on every single human being is a hybrid and if you know anything about hybrid you'll know a hybrid can never reproduce itself i don't care you get a tin of white paint you put some black paint in you can never have perfect white i don't care how far you go it's hybrid it's polluted and that's every one of us we're born into this world as hybrid human beings so we in ourselves can never reproduce jesus christ because we're hybrid that's right see that's why somebody had to come outside of this world come into this world as a perfect human being and pay the price of my sins that the hybrid in me that i might be redeemed from this rotten state that i'm in that i can't change i can't be any better uh somebody had to come and pay the price because god made a law and a law is not a law if there's no penalty and somebody had to pay the price and that's why jesus came he came from the outside i just sort of think how wonderful i'm sorry i'm going on on my time but i just think it's just so wonderful do you realize the god of creation formed himself a pinhead in in the womb of mary a pinhead the god of creation it's hard to understand it but the very spoken word of god came into mary and then i just think one of the things that really just tears me up too also when joseph and mary were about to be delivered and they went to bethlehem the house of god's bread they went to bethlehem and they went to the inn and joseph would have knocked on the door and the guy would have said yes what's the problem we need a room my wife's ready bit to be delivered and uh and and the um the man will have said sorry mate no room but my wife's going to have a baby no room i'll tell you what there's a stinking little stable out the back there oh jesus hallelujah that's what it's all about the greatest man that ever lived came into a stable to be born i'm sorry i've overtaken my time but there's so much more i could tell you but i think we'll just leave the thanks i didn't come here to run the service i just came to share a testimony that i believe you know brethren i'm just an old guy now getting on 83 years old but i love the lord jesus amen amen and i know he's life he is the only life and he dwells in here and i'll tell you what if you know that i don't care what happens in your life you already have the token the down payment of eternal life amen i just pray that the lord bless you this morning i'll just close with the word of prayer dear lord this morning as i just stand here i realize i've probably overtaken my time but i just pray lord for every one of us here this morning that will appreciate you because outside of you lord there's nothing you are my lord you are my life you are my everything and i just thank you lord even um this morning the songs that we've sung lord for from brother james there they're the songs that we used to sing years ago i remember lord he is my everything he is my all hallelujah i just pray you'll continue to have your way with these people lord i just pray that my testimony might have been a blessing to them i thank you for that i just commit the rest of the meeting and to your care now as i ask it in the name of our lord jesus christ amen amen amen thank you brethren praise the lord you know the same god they met brother david 50 years ago still here you know he's still meeting us and i i honestly believe that there's children as they come up in the message you know or under their christian parents you know they just we go to church but there has to come a time where each one meets god right amen and he's here so he's in his presence is here in this building amen let's stand and we're going to sing this and be so honest waymaker you are here [Music] [Music] turning lights around you are here [Applause] [Music] you are

this morning hallelujah amen thank you brother james thank you musicians thanks brother david for sharing a testimony jesus still lives amen god bless you amen like to welcome andy here too god bless you just feel at home amen praise the lord let's um let's go straight to the scripture shall we go to luke chapter 24 amen but you can touch him this morning hallelujah i believe it amen i mean luke 24 we're going to start from verse 13 we're going to read down to verse 27. i'm sorry i don't have a a slideshow um amen says here and behold two of them went that same day to a village called emmaus which was from jerusalem about three score furlongs and they talked together of all these things which had happened and it came to pass that while they commune together and reasoned they tried to work out what's going on jesus himself drew near and went with them but their eyes were holding that they should not know him and he said unto them what manner of communications are these that ye have one to another as you walk in a sad and one of them whose name was cleopas answered and said unto him are thou only a stranger in jerusalem and has not known the things which have come to pass in these days and he said unto them what things and they said unto him concerning jesus of nazareth which was a prophet mighty indeed and word before god and all the people and how the chief priests and our rulers delivered him to be condemned to death and have crucified him but we trusted that it had been he which should have redeemed israel and besides all this today is the third day since these things were done yay and certain women also of our company made us astonished which were early at the sepulcher and when they found not his body they came saying that they had also seen a vision of angels which said he was alive and certain of them which were with us went to the sepulcher and found it even so as the woman had said but he but him they saw not then he said unto them o false and slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken ought not christ to have suffered these things and to enter into his glory and beginning at moses and all the prophets expounded unto them all the scriptures the things concerning himself amen what a what a portion of scripture you can walk with the lord and not realize who's talking to you but we know that's not the end of the story that's right amen but let's let's bow heads in a word of prayer this morning lord jesus lord we believe lord you are present lord you are here lord you said in your word you promised where two or three are gathered in my name there i am there i am in the midst and lord we know you always come where you're invited so lord we invite you lord jesus to this building and not just to this building but to where we are at lord and lord to our very hearts oh god may you come be welcome lord may you come speak the words of life lord jesus may you just be exalted in the service lord lord we're so thankful you are the same the same yesterday today and forever lord you're alive lord upon the earth lord i just pray you'd speak to us like only you can lord may your anoint speaker and hear it one more time lord may you give us strength and our bodies lord give us a tent of ears oh god may there be no distractions be able to distract us today amen lord may he bless the service bless from the oldest to the youngest among us oh god dear god anyone who may be watching this now may just go to to where they are lord you're the same god lord jesus you're a personal god and i just pray you come come by our way today for your glory in jesus christ's name amen amen god bless you friends you can have your seats this morning so as i um mentally briefly uh briefly mentioned last sunday about you know i want to speak about seeing jesus and his program now we know that god's program brother abraham says is to take the world empty of the world fill you with him and then check the world with you amen but we know on a so we're going to go the 10 000 foot view that we're going to come down to cleopas and his friend on the way to emmaus because we know that that that same jesus that spoke to them and walked with them is walking with his children today amen that you know the lord is not just in heaven someplace he's not just in history but he's the same in 2020 as he was back then he's just as real he's just as alive it means i'd like to speak on seeing jesus and his program now brother brown would pray in uh in the contest at the end of 1962 he says oh god that may we be one step higher up the ladder until we see jesus and his program because if we can see jesus and his program we know where we are in time amen we know what has to take place we know where we are in his program because many people are wondering what's going on in the world you know what's happening in the world and we know it's all in here right you know we are still living in bible days amen the god of the bible's alive hallelujah so you know we want to just just go into these things now and and so if we can see him and his program we can have confidence to walk with him because we know where he is we know where we are we know where we're going now we know history repeats itself you know um you know we know the profit would parallel israel and and and how they are formed and and how they had like a golden age and they went down into idolatry and he paralleled that with even the history of america how they came in there they pushed the natives out they found it under freedom of religion they had great presidents like washington and lincoln but they came down to such a low end to what we have today and um but both of those countries and i say not even those countries but the world and you have the opportunity that they had israel had the messiah walk in their midst they had the living lord jesus the very lord of glory the god of christ and put on flesh and walk in their midst and they had an opportunity not just as a nation but as individuals to accept him right but we know that it was prophesied that sadly they would reject him i mean and they would turn him down and and america and i'll say the world and ourselves today had the same opportunity to receive the gospel brother braham said in 1957 that that america turned down the gospel of jesus christ and um you know so the thing is if you receive him then you'll have a paradise there'll be trouble on every hand but in your soul you know where you're going right you'll have a you'll have a real peace but but to reject him you go into chaos and unfortunately we are living in an era where we just see chaos and the world is falling apart because they rejected the lord jesus christ and unfortunately you reap what you sow and this world is now reaping what it so many years ago but there's a people upon the earth now this is not all doom and gloom right because there's an exit out of this place called the rapture amen and god will take those who know him with him in that rapture right so this is not all doom and gloom right hallelujah this is actually the greatest time to be alive think of it we don't have to die to to to go to glory we can be alive i mean to be transformed i mean in a moment a twinkling of an eye so sadly israel rejected him as the church world would reject him in this day and we know that is prophesied because in revelations 3 when it speaks of our age rich increase with goods have need of nothing he says behold i stand at the door and knock so he's on the outside of his church knocking trying to get in so he's been fully rejected he's on the outside and unfortunately this is what's happening so if we look at history now forgive me if i'm i feel like you know if you need me to slow down just just say hold on or something i don't know give me some kind of signal i don't want this to go over your head because you if you look at history you take from when john the baptist was here to the destruction of jerusalem we're living in that span that history is repeating itself we had a forerunner come he introduced us to jesus christ amen and the bride has a real pentecost who's had a pentecost that same pillar of fire comes and dwells in you changes your life transforms you you see him living hallelujah where the word is not just ink on paper but it's in flesh in your life hallelujah so so a forerunner introduced jesus christ john the baptist introduced jesus christ those who really you know heard his message went to pentecost received the baptism of the holy ghost and then the book of acts was written and we know the book of acts is not the acts of the apostles as the acts of the holy ghost in the apostles and the same thing has happened today we've had a forerunner come introduce us to jesus christ the living word right we have received a true pentecost and i'll say if you haven't received a pentecost it's here to be received well that same god that you read about in the book of acts you should be able to read the book of acts and see him do the same things in your life amen if he did it in the beginning he'll do it at the end the same guy that lived back there is the same god that lives today he hasn't changed one bit amen he's still the same god but in that span the church was you know so so the book of acts was being written but then it came to a place where where jerusalem was destroyed now when we think about the destruction of jerusalem it didn't just one day is all peace the next day titus turns up with his army and just destroys the thing there's a whole if you look at history there's lots of insurrections rebellions riots uprisings and finally it culminated in the destruction of jerusalem and you see what why is that happening because the world was falling apart because they rejected the one that could keep the world together which is the lord and you see today the same thing this world is falling apart why because they've rejected the messiah and now there's fighting and and strife and things going on because the problem is history must repeat itself and it's not just a city now it's not just a nation it's a world but there is a way of escaping this day hallelujah amen now the thing is though the problem uh with with with people is is time can be such a curse because the longer time goes on the longer it seems that a promise seems to linger then people lose their focus on really what the goal is and even even uh you know peter would say in second peter 3 says this second epistle beloved i write unto you and both which i stir up your pure minds by the way of remembrance that ye may be mindful of the words which are spoken before by the holy prophets and of the commandments of us the apostles of the lord and savior knowing this first that there shall come in the last day scoffers walking after their own lusts and we see that right and saying where is the promise of his coming remember because it's been more than yeah actually for two thousand years the church will be saying he's coming he's coming he's coming and people are saying it's been two thousand years two thousand years two thousand years even in this day in the 50s he's coming he's coming we're in 2020 people say where's the promise of his coming for since the fathers fell asleep all things continue as they were from the beginning of the creation this is what they say and this is what people think well the prophet's been dead sixty years or fifty years whatever the other fathers have gone asleep that first generation that really met the lord there and you know so where's the promise of his coming they say things have been continuing on but he says for this they are willingly ignorant of that by the word of god the heavens were of old and the earth standing out of the water in the water whereby the world that then was being overflowed with water perished but the heavens and the earth which are now by the same word are kept in store reserved under fire against the day of judgment and production of ungodly men but beloved be not ignorant of this one thing that one day is what the lord is as a thousand years and a thousand years is one day so in god's timing our lord jesus was was crucified and rose again just a couple of days ago that's pretty fresh in his mind hallelujah amen the lord is not slack concerning his promise as some men would count slackness what slackness are they not he's not getting around to it but he's not slack concerning his promise as some men can't slackness but is long suffering to us would and when i read those i'm so thankful you're long suffering towards me how they're not willing that any should perish but that all should come to repentance so god is not slack as men would think of slack he is on time right he's on time he's on his schedule i mean it will not be too late or too early it'll be right on time amen but the problem is with the delays people lose focus we never want to lose our focus we we never want to lose our enthusiasm i mean the fire and the passion of serving the lord when we first met him hallelujah that that that fire and that passion should be burning it should be burning greater our enthusiasm amen we're a lot more down the road now than when we first believe hallelujah we're we are that day closer we're a sunday closer to the coming of the lord hallelujah we are one church service closer to the coming of the lord hallelujah you know it could be this moment i pray it is but if it's not i'm going to be looking for him tomorrow hallelujah that one that saved and called you is the one that's going to wrap you isn't that glorious hallelujah we're going to get to the tour on the way to emmaus at some stage because it's that it is that personal it is that personal it's not some abstract idea christianity is not an idea it's not a bunch of doctrine this message is not a bunch of doctrine it's jesus christ revealed it means it's not something god didn't send it to fuss and fight over god sent it that his holy ghost will come and live it through your life amen brother abraham had the um when he's when he's um speaking in is this the time of the answer in 1962 he he says look upon this the light had never come upon us where where junior jackson had the dream of brother bram taking the crowbar and taking the top off the pyramid and and the white rockers there and when all of them got up and i told them to watch that and all them came to came up to look in but he said while they were looking in he looked out the corner of his eye and believed it was and watched me and i slipped off to one side so junior jackson's in the stream and he watched his brother slip off to one side and started going towards the west towards the setting of the sun coming up a hill going down a hill going up a hill going down the hill getting small and small all the way out of sight and he said then when when i did that he said then the brethren turned around after all said where did he ban did he vanish where did he go and said some took out that way some took out that way and some another but a very few stayed and looked on what i had told them so he wandered off and everyone's looking where's he gone where's the prophet god what's going on and he and remember he was instructed instructed look on this look on this but then time went by and then so they wandered off doing all kinds of other things he says very few stayed and did what he told them to do why because the time went on people look at start looking at other things we have something to look on hallelujah this word amen we should look on this it will tell us where we are where we're going what's going on you know that scripture in luke 24 brother brown will preach a sermon modern events are made clear by prophecy he's saying that luke 24 is a prophecy of today everything makes sense because of that prophecy today amen now he says and look in 1963 sorry for all the reading but here we are now today we see faith is designed to do this same faith today sees the same thing a faith of the church today should see the program of god i want you to don't miss that now the church today is called that's called of god will certainly see the program of god because the program of god is written out here the blueprint and the holy spirit by faith is the one who reads it and sets it together so this is god's program is written in here i'm sure we can agree with that for our daily life how church should be how we treat one another treat anyone on the street treat our children treat our parents everything everything is all that's god's program is written in here but the thing is the devil will try and twist us from the program of god and as and and the reason i read that quote from is this time the end is because obviously they're thinking god involved and actually there the program was look on this look on the word but they're thinking change i'm going to go do something else they wandered off so we don't ever want to let the devil twist our thinking off of god's program because he'll always twist it onto something else he says and god keeps his word that's the reason the church is coming in with the worship of mary and of other women and things it's that same spirit under a religious head and that's the reason they have to get their mind off the unadulterated word of god to produce that program so there's a lot of programs going on in the world heaps of programs we want to have god's program amen and and the thing is when the devil will swap he'll always try and twist our minds off the word of god to another program and he always wants to swap the supernatural for the natural right so what do you do in the church history swap the power of god the holy ghost and the people and swap it just for a natural form of religion amen so we never we never ever want to just accept what the devil would try and give us so um you know he always try and swap a natural church for a spiritual church what was the church in the beginning the holy ghost was on everyone he was in everyone he wasn't just in the minister of the song leaders he was in the laity right and everyone was participating in spiritual worship hallelujah it wasn't just an anointed minister or whatever but it was everyone was anointed everyone was part of the body right but then he he swapped that for creeds and dogmas of men saying oh only the priesthood is holy now and so he took the anointing off the people and put it on the priesthood that's what the devil did and he just made that into a cold form so he'll always swap the natural for the spiritual but we want the spiritual i mean we want the genuine if there's a genuine to be had i want that genuine harley and i believe this morning we have a genuine amen but we should cultivate it nurture it rejoice in it be happy about it right treasure amen don't take it for granted amen now israel in the time of jesus was longing for a messiah this will all come together eventually i i i i really trust israel in the time of jesus was longing for their messiah but they had it all worked down their minds how he would come some thought that the you know the forerunner would come down on a you know come down to heaven on some golden you know you know staircase and say now here he comes and now here comes the messiah would go to the high priest and you know they had it all worked out you know and they wanted a great king like david that would that would push the romans out of the country now you've got to think of the mindset of the jewish people at that time because they were oppressed by the romans they wanted to right the wrongs of the past they wanted their own nation so they thought their messiah would come with a great big sword and just drive the romans out but god doesn't give us what we want he gives us what we need and they needed a baby in a manger they needed a sacrificial lamb right they didn't need a great warrior like that they needed a sacrificial lamb to wash them from their sins hallelujah so so that's what they were expecting now the kingdom of god when when when john the baptist started preaching when jesus preaches the kingdom of god is nigh so it's coming and even the scribes and pharisees they would ask him in luke 17 he says and when he was demanded of the pharisees when the kingdom of god should come he answered them and said the kingdom of god cometh not with a cometh not with observation so you're not going to see it with your natural eye you know you know it's not by weights and sizes and people and you know it's not by observation you can't observe this you can't study it with your mind and work it out he says neither shall they say low or low therefore behold the kingdom of god is within you so the lord was trying to get them to see that this is this is not a natural kingdom this great kingdom of god it's not about it you know it's not about palaces on the earth and great castles and men and you know what they were thinking great kings with great big crowns and all that kind of stuff no the kingdom of god was greater than that it was the holy ghost within the people amen that's what he's trying to say you won't observe it with your eye your mind what you know remember no the kingdom of god is within you amen and even even the um even jesus when he was standing before pilate he would say my kingdom is not of this world if my kingdom of this world then my servants would fight that i should not be delivered to the jews but now is my kingdom not from hence so he was telling because remember pilate was told this man's claiming to be the king of the jews they haven't said he's the king of the jews and they gave him over you know to pile the crucified but but jesus said my kingdom's not of this world these people have it all wrong these scribes and pharisees have it all wrong that my kingdom is the kingdom of heaven it's not a natural kingdom that i'm establishing but i'm going to establish my word in the hearts and your hearts of men and women hallelujah and then and then pilate would sign to him art thou king then jesus says thou says i'm a king and to this end was i born for this cause came i enter the world that i should bear witness unto the truth everyone that is of the truth heareth my voice i'm so glad hallelujah you hear his voice i mean you know you're of the truth i mean so so jesus was trying to tell them my kingdom's not a natural kingdom but remember the jews had a big idea we're going to reestablish the kingdom we're going to buy a great political move we're going to drive the romans out we're going gonna we're gonna reestablish the kingdom of david remember he was the son of david so they were expecting him to act like david act acted but he was a far greater soldier than david was because he went down into hell and took the keys of heldeth and the grave of satan amen he actually released the prisoners from the prison house i mean he actually had a bleach had a weapon in him that could wash away sin change the nature of man that that fallen nature we were born with he could undo that he could transform in a moment and tweak with an eye i mean a soul hallelujah why do you say all that it's because we don't have to put up with sin we don't have to put up with human problems this is not there's not seven steps to becoming a christian i mean you know this is god's transforming power that's what we need and that's what is available amen this morning yes sir hallelujah the scribes and pharisees were worried they would say in john 11 if we let him thus alone all men will believe on him and the romans shall come and take away both our place and nation they were worried about their establishment upon the earth and how they stood and you know they were worried about those kind of things and and one of them named um caiaphas being the high priest that same year said unto them ye know nothing at all nor consider that it is expedient for us that one man should die for the people and for the that the whole nation perished not says prophesying this man has to die for us but that was their that was their mentality was we've got to keep our position in the country amen this is all they worried about they won't worry about the word being fulfilled they are more concerned about their standing in the community what other people thought of them what the romans thought of them you know i'm hyper so i've got to be a certain way and they weren't interested in actually what the word said they are more worried about their earthly position on earth than anything else and and even it came to a point in john chapter 6 that when those men when they had seen the miracle that jesus did said this is not of a truth that a prophet should come into the world when jesus therefore perceived that they would come and take him by force to make him a king he departed again into a mountain himself alone so they were they were looking for a messiah and they said we're going to make him king he perceive this is what their motive is going to be so he withdrew from them because he knew this is what this wasn't the kingship he was he was set forth to have but this is what they were looking for even the disciples that walked with him for three and a half years even after the resurrection they would ask him in acts chapter one lord will thou at this time restore again the kingdom of israel so even they were under an expectation though they though they walked with him they heard his teachings they saw the miracles he even said that you know my kingdom is not of this world but they're under expectation because this is how they were built are you going to restore the kingdom now are you basically going to drive the romans out and establish the throne of david again you know but this was it's interesting it you know this was before pentecost this was before pentecost it was the same thing you never read after pentecost that they strove among themselves who'd be the greatest that's right they only did that as carnal believers before they met the lord at pentecost they strove i'm the greatest no this is the greatest i'm the best one that's carnal unconverted men yet they are anointed to cast out devils yet they were anointed to do miracles but they were not fully converted even jesus would say to peter when thou art converted strength in the brethren though they did all these things they were under the same expectation are you going to restore the kingdom now and he said unto them it is not fair to know the times or the seasons which the father has put in his own power and now so so but now he's going to tell them what's going to happen but ye shall receive power after that the holy ghost has come upon you and ye shall be witnesses unto me both in jerusalem and in all judea and in samaria unto the uttermost part of the earth so they are under this expectation but i want to ask you a question do you ever read in the epistles anywhere about restoring a natural kingdom the church now is it has it ever been the church's mission to actually fight a natural battle going on some injustice some nation building has it ever been the church's real mission you don't read about it go through hebrews it's not there romans not there amen all the way down timothy titus river may be it's not there because the program of god was never based upon natural kingdom building but unconverted men will try and build kingdoms right church kingdoms personality cults wherever it may be man always tries to build that but god was never interested in that that actually works against the program of god because god's program is that he fills you with his presence right and then he shakes the world with you you say well the world hasn't heard about me but you can shake your world right you can shake your school or your job wherever you are on the street you can shake your little world god wants to use you to shake your world hallelujah now the reason they weren't all caught up in natural kingdom building is because they actually became they saw jesus and his program remember this is not a mental oh i understand the program this is not this is he comes into you and then you see his program and you see him amen the lord had already prophesied of the destruction of the temple so they knew these things were going to happen they jesus would go with his disciples that look at the stones of the temple and how great it was and you know how how great these stones are but then you know jesus just said there shall be not left one stone upon another that it shall not be thrown down this is matthew 24. so they're looking look how big this building is look at the great stones and the gold and all these things jesus says not one stone will be left upon another so they knew a expiry date was on this temple they knew the expiry date was coming they didn't know the exact day but they knew it was coming amen and then even jesus would would lament it oh jerusalem jerusalem now that killers the prophets and stone of them which are sent under thee how often i've gathered thy children together even as a hen gathered her chickens under her wings and ye would not behold your house is left unto you desolate so they knew this would be who's you all following me they had a vindicated messiah that said this is going to come down it doesn't matter what anyone would try and do like you look you look for the prophecies of daniel i think i've said this before it says that the greeks would come and and conquer the medes and persians and you read the history of darius and alexander the great it didn't matter what darius did he couldn't beat alexander didn't matter how many many had didn't matter his tactics he used he couldn't win a battle why is that because he was pr it was prophesied that this one would come and take him out and it's the same thing today it doesn't matter what we try and do doesn't matter what this world tries and do it'll say peace and safety peace and safety but then sudden destruction will come upon it right you can't stop the wheels of prophecy turning so it's better just to get on board i think i think life's a lot simpler we just get on board it'll it'll take away a lot of worry it'll take away a lot of trouble it'll take away double-mindedness amen it'll take away all those things because you see god's word is being fulfilled hallelujah israel as i said if you read history israel wasn't just a peaceful place but there was rebellion brewing for years there's many rebellions rights just go read wikipedia it wasn't just one thing and then titus turns up there are many things going on there was a series of riots and revolts that erupted sporadically this is my words from 37 a.d to 66 a.d which caused the jewish people to actually expel the romans from parts of israel but there was so much infighting within the factions of the sadducees the pharisees and the zealots and even in 80 i think 68 there was actually a civil war going on briefly in jerusalem and they actually wiped out most of the government their own government why because as as as a world falls apart it begins to tear itself apart you see any kind of country that goes through strife civil war it tears itself apart other other actors will be aiding either side sure they will be but you know it'll be tearing itself apart but i'll just say this they tore themselves apart trying to make israel great again let's make america great again let's make christendom great again let's make the world great again they tore themselves apart under that slogan that's what i'm saying the history is repeating itself right and then eight yeah so most of the israeli government was killed in 1868 then in a.d 70 titus laid siege and destroyed jerusalem and there was a great slaughter and he even let the jews in from other parts of the world who had come to celebrate the passover feast so they had it they're at a season of a great holy festival titus is around the outside he just lets them in lets them in lets them in they starve even some of the zealots actually burnt a lot of their food supplies to try and preempt something and then he went and massacred them all all because they said will not have this man rule over us they want to brabus instead of jesus you reap what you sow but can you imagine i just want to maybe just just let's just go back to those times before titus turned up you know from from 1837 even up to you know even at that point there was a lot of there's a lot of strife and trouble against the romans but could you imagine being a jewish believer in in the holy land in that day there'd be a lot of voices going on we're going to rise up and there'd be public support would try and be gathered because it'd be under a religious banner we're going to fulfill the scripture it's time for the messiah to come we're going to restore the kingdom and you know but but the true believer who was fully converted they wouldn't have been caught up in it that's right but imagine the pressure you say you're a jew and you're not joining this only real jews will join this we've got to restore the kingdom we're going to restore this land of abraham isaac and jacob you know there'll be a pressure come on you but the true believer wasn't interested because they were serving they're in a different program they weren't in the program of of of the political arena in that day they're under a different program and even even when titus remember jesus warned them when you see this all taking place flee pray that your flight is not on the sabbath why because the gates are closed or in the winter time or whatever just flee the city and so when titus begin to came all the christians just fled for their lives and they weren't caught in it because they heard they had a vindicated messiah say when you see these things happen see they were looking on this are you with me they weren't following other voices they were looking on this because they knew it had been proven it had been vindicated it was accurate it was correct hallelujah and so when titus came in they fled for the hills and they weren't caught up in the destruction and it's the same thing with the bride of christ today amen we can't go through a tribulation amen we can't go through the destruction of today i mean if you have the holy ghost if he is on the inside of the inside of you i mean the lord's going to take you with him hello isn't that the wonderful thing we have a way of escape today hallelujah it's not something you you work out in your mind you meet a person amen jesus is a person you know part of his program now we're just going to go kind of from that view down zoom in you know part of god's program is entertaining jesus when jesus went to the feast of of of simon the pharisee he was invited but only one one person and actually entertained him in that feast and it's the same thing you know we always invite him to come to church but do we invite but but do we entertain him all right or do we leave him in in service you know with with with dirty feet unwelcome in the corner remember it's our attitude towards them as we worship as we hear the word i mean that's how we entertain and we pour our lives at his feet we take everything we have breaker alabaster box we give him worship we give him praise we give him thanks hallelujah and by doing that you're actually entertaining the lord amen hallelujah wouldn't that be a great thing imagine if he came in his physical form we know we'll meet him in the air but just imagine that he came in his physical form and he knocked on your door oh boy imagine that hallelujah be a rejoicing time hardly be a worship time you begin oh lord jesus lord you come to a place such as mine i'm so thankful you'd come here your presence would come here hallelujah that i can really entertain you amen and his presence comes into our house and and his presence comes into the church hallelujah and some are washing his feet and some are entertaining him saying stay a bit longer lord stay a bit longer lord i want to entertain you lord and some sit there and just leave them unwashed feet every service we can wash his feet every service we can refresh him amen glory to him hallelujah brother baby says in the worst sinner in the city and jesus many times is not entertained as a guest when he comes to the church god help us to recognize that jesus wants to be entertained but when the holy ghost comes into the church and wants to bless the church people just sit there just as cold and starchy that's the same thing that the pharisee did now i'll just ask you a question has jesus ever done anything bad to anyone only good amen he's never been mean to me he's never robbed me he's never cheated me he's never made fun of me he's never humiliated me he's never hurt me in any way he's only done good i so we can come into the church now now remember this is who we're worshiping he's never done anything bad amen right are you following me you say well i'm going through trials he isn't doing anything bad to you hallelujah so why do we why do we come in now we all have trouble we all have pressures and burdens and things but why do those things dictate to us how we should worship god are you with me i mean here was a woman she was a prostitute she wasn't even invited i mean everyone knew who she was she had a lot of trouble in her life you know no doubt she was put out on the street by her parents saying she is a very scarred human being in her spirit but yet all that was put aside when she saw jesus with unwashed feet not made welcome all of her past and her complexes and her scars and whatever it was she put that to one side because she's like i must make him welcome hello and then she got all the money she had she went to the apothecary bought the best said i want that one and maybe he looked at her saying okay well where's the money all remember all of that money that she earned to buy that was from her life it wasn't from a it was from her prostitution but she gave it she got the alabaster box put in a rope somehow got past the foot wash flunky and those different ones and she got to where jesus was hallelujah and she broke that alabaster box anointed his feet washer washed his feet with his tears dried us dried his feet with her hair and all those things she was entertaining jesus and she never even asked him sir can i do this to you never asked didn't know how she'd be accepted but she was accepted you come to the lord you'll always be accepted all that comes to me will know i'll know why it's cast out he said doesn't matter what condition you know it's amazing people want to get patched up before they come to church they want to get their lives right before they come to church that's the wrong way around i mean we're coming to the prince of god that god can patch us up he can fix us and heal us and mend us and change us it's not about this it's not about having the haircut you know what about the heart i mean she looked wrong on the outside but her heart was i must entertain jesus i must wash his feet hallelujah all the pharisees were like you know they were they were all like this and they would have had the finest finest one not just a farmer's one you know they were looking the part but in the inside they weren't the parts harley but she was the part on the inside and that's what matters oh that's the thing that matters if your husband i want to entertain jesus i may not understand she didn't understand all things but something in her said i must wash his feet amen that's part of god's program i like it amen and he don't get sick of it it doesn't become common to him hey we've got eternity we're going to worship him do you think he's going to get bored do you think we're going to get bored even if we yeah i don't think it'll be just this but even if we just get round the throne and that's eternity oh boy and we worship him and we crown and king of kings and you know you know and that's all we do for eternity it won't be boring it will be awesome that'll be glorious i mean wave after wave of his holy spirit moving over us and we'll just praise him and give him glory he said that's boring oh no no no to step into his presence that's why i pray this become real personal just about now when we step into his presence let not let's not push it away and care about what other people will say about us who cares she didn't go to simon the pharisees said no mr simon mr pharisee sir do you mind if i come and do this in your face what do you think what will you think about me she didn't care she had to get to jesus hallelujah and that's what we want to do but she had a revelation that this jesus of nazareth was more than just a man see the whole program of god is built upon revelation where jesus would ask his disciples in matthew 16 who do men say that i am and he's and he's asking us the same question who do you say this jesus is well he was a healer he was a good man he did this it's beyond that he was a prophet more than that he was god manifested in the flesh he was the god of the prophets hallelujah and when peter would say to him thou art the christ the son of living god see god wants a response right he wants a response and peter said thou art the christ son living god he says blessed art thou simon bar jonah for flesh and blood has not revealed this unto you so the apostles the other ones didn't didn't reveal us to you your parents didn't tell you you know no one told you but my father which is in heaven has revealed this unto you and upon this rock i'll build my church so the revelation of who jesus christ is that's the revel that's the rock that the church is built upon amen hallelujah so the whole program of god is built upon divine revelation this is from things that are to be jesus said in saint matthew 16th chapter flesh and blood has not revealed this to you but my father which is in heaven has revealed this to you what was it a revelation of who he was and upon this rock i'll build my church and the gates of hell can't prevail against it see the revelation of jesus christ in this hour not what he was in another hour what he was now the bible expresses it's growing in the bride to the full stature therefore if the corn of wheat of christ had to fall in the ground so did the bride had to fall on the ground through the dark ages any grain that goes into the ground must die or it can't produce itself reproduce itself and the great church that he established on the day of pentecost by the sending of the holy ghost had to suffer martyrdom and go into the dirt into the earth in the dark age to bring forth again in the age of luther and to come out to the full stature of the bride of jesus christ in these last days therefore the bride and the rapture will come forth and there is all pre-planned by god all backed up from the beginning he knowed every man every place who would sit all about it it's all pre-planned god knew it would be here and he made it that way so that when we get there he's gone to prepare a place for us and when we get there it'll all be prepared just like even this night i'd say this day is prepared like this hour is prepared yes his grateful knowledge tells him all these things he says in in the message modern events may clear by prophecy and and i'm coming to a there's a purpose of reading these the shark held it and now the shack pulls away it has to and remember 20 years has passed by no denomination has come out of it it won't we're at the end of denominations the wheat's taking shape that's what's the matter with the wheat now it must lay in the prince of the sun to ripen before the combine picks it up now the events that we see taking place it's absolutely shown in the bible of every age we think we're all out of cater but we're not everything moving just exactly with god's word amen no but but what i've found interesting over the years is when people have had have taken these kind of quotes that we just got to land the prince of the sun and ripen and we just got to lay here in the prince of the sun and you know they're they're insinuating that there's no manifestation of god no more because we're just laying in the presence of the sun right so they're saying that there's you know and and and you know brother ramsay was like you know like the um you know luther was like the arms and the feet of the body and different parts and the tongue was the pentecostal move the eyes of the prophet now we're the mind of christ we're going to land the prince of the sun there's no moving parts there's no manifestation you know we're just laying in the prince of the sun to ripen but they fail to realize what did the first piece of grain do what did the first fruits do amen so so now we're talking about jesus what did jesus do he cast out devils he rejoiced greatly amen amen he healed the sick raise the dead amen he was obedient to the word of god for his life there was a big manifestation holy that was the biggest manifestation ever to strike the earth of god's presence was in the ministry of our lord jesus christ and he said that ministry will continue on through my bride down through the ages now if we and then you look at the first book you know you look at the first church that was a that was a wheat church as well did they just land the prince of the sun and and talk about doctrine no they went and cast out devils are healed by sick they raise the dead amen people were born into the kingdom by their ministry hallelujah many things they were led by vision god manifested his word through their lives [Music] that was in the beginning it shall be at the end so we can't just say well we're lying in the friends of the sun sitting around talking about doctrine it's not that there's no god comes into us and he casts out devils he raises the dead heals the sick shows visions dreams signs and wonders those things are still going on today hallelujah because if that's what the first at the end will do the same thing hallelujah amen now luke 24 we're coming down again now now we're here with clurpus and his friend took me a while but here i am brother braham said that modern events are made clear by prophecy and he went to luke 24 and says this is a prophecy of this last day you want to see what's going on in the world read luke 24 read the death burial resurrection of our lord jesus christ and you'll see what's going on in this day you know it's amazing the two on the way to emmaus they ever stop and think about who they are walking with they were walking with the one who caused all these events they are walking with the resurrected lord jesus christ himself they weren't walking with another disciple they were walking with him but it was hidden from them who he really was but it's incredible now this is god in print form amen we can walk with this for years and we can think it doesn't understand what's going on in our day it was written over two thousand years ago by how many different authors it it doesn't know this book doesn't predict what's going on here remember they looked at him saying are you a stranger do you not understand what's been going on do you not understand what's just happened what's just transpired and he's acting like what do you mean and he was the one in front of he was the one in the garden with them he was the one with pilate he was the one on on the cross here's the one that was in the tomb here's the one that rose again amen he was all those ones but he's acting like what do you mean what things tell me what's going on and people will look at the bible and look at the message and they'll think it doesn't understand the day and hour which i live oh the message was preached over 50 years ago brother bradman see what was going on in this day and it's more current today than it was when it was given oh this bible doesn't i mean i mean you know it's 2000 years old it's just a historical book and it's more alive and it's more current and it's more real many of the prophecies that peter and paul and the apostles gave we're living in them right it's actually manifesting now it wasn't for their days for today amen so so they had no idea they had no idea the one they were walking with was the answer to all their problems and all their questions and was the only one that could give clarity to where they were says the problem people sadly can walk along and and now this is i'll just put it this way this is now about seven billion people i'm talking about the world is walking along and it has no idea what's going on and it thinks that no one has the answer but someone has the answer someone has the answer and here he was walking with his you know purpose and his friend and sometimes we're walking along you know we can come to church sunday after sunday wednesday after wednesday you know we could have family devotions whatever but we can be looking at the word and just thinking it doesn't really understand this day and age who's been there yeah oh brother brown had no idea what would be happening in 2020 really are you sure this bible doesn't predict this date are you sure that's a stranger in this day it doesn't understand the events that are going on really they talk to him like don't you know what's going on we read it didn't we don't you know what's just happened and people look at the scriptures saying don't you know this it doesn't understand it's a stranger it knows exactly he knows exactly what's going on amen this as i said the bible is more current more alive the message is more alive today than it was when it was first given they were walking alongside and they were talking to the word made flesh who had risen and they didn't recognize who he really was and they thought that he had no idea what was going on i'm just going to repeat this just to i want to label this point it's just a bible it was written thousands of years ago it's not culturally relevant today it's a different era today times have changed things you know it doesn't fit with today really i want you to think about it because remember just like the reason i read that dream that yo yo brother bam said look on this but if you're not looking on this you'll think something else is better to look on right if you if you think this is not worth looking on you'll look at something else right but this has the answer we have the answer today well the message is over eleven hundred yo eleven hundred odd sermons preached fifty years ago it's not relevant today really are you sure our brother have got it wrong are you sure his ministry is a stranger in the land today it is but he knew exactly when he prophesied things happening it's for tight it's for today but you don't know what's going on you don't know the struggles that are going on in the world you don't understand you live in a little bubble brother ben you're not interested in these things but if you only knew him amen amen if you really knew who was walking with you even i'll say this morning and trying to get your attention and try and open your eyes i mean you you'd really understand oh my if you could just see the lord jesus being present hallelujah and he has the answer to all of your questions [Music] before this mary and the other woman went to the tomb to anoint jesus with spices his body they went there broken and said just as the two on the way to emmaus to try and find comfort in anointing the dead with spices or try and get some consolation and many people they'll go to dead places to try and find comfort he's not dead he's risen they went to the wrong place but mary was spoken to by jesus in her trouble and in her great sadness and that great sadness turned to joy when she just said when he just said to her one word mary amen and her eyes came open and so it's you lord you've risen hallelujah we've all had different plans this year if we stood here a year ago and we said how's 2020 going to be we'd all be wrong yeah that's right everything we planned on doing out the window i think what's going on here god wasn't surprised they were very he would even tell them i'm going to be crucified who's read that he tells them more than once i'm going to be crucified and third i'm going to raise again but when the event happened they were like what's going on they had plans their plans were dashed to a million pieces but the lord's plans is the program that we've gotta we've gotta hold on to see when plans get dashed many people think now their lives are on hold actually i hear a whole generation's on hold there push the pause button we can't do this and this and this and the problem when that happens is it often produces insecurity what's going to happen now my whole future that i had has now gone off and it produces a lot less lack or loss of focus and a paralysis who's with me you understand we had plans we all had we all had plans who has plans those plans just left and who knows when it's going to return so what does it produce insecurity what's going to happen just just think just naturally now many people want to go study go study if you can many people want to go overseas but now we can't do those things but i had this all planned out this is what i was going to do now what's going to happen with my life what's my future going to be who's had those kind of questions and it produces allah a loss of focus why are you talking about these things very simply they their whole life was falling apart when jesus died their whole life yes that was like covered but times a billion yes because they couldn't remember they in the jewish way you are either part of the synagogue or you are an outcast and they publicly said any man who follow anyone who follows us jesus of nazareth he's an outcast in society and it's not like new zealand we can just basically just just disappear into the woodwork everyone knew everyone and so they had decided we are actually going to become outcasts in our own nation to follow this jesus and now this jesus was dead in a tomb and now that tomb was empty and they had no idea where he was don't you think that would produce some kind of insecurity it would produce like a paralysis in their lives but then he began to walk with them and this is what i'm going to say he will go with you amen he went with them to make sure they understood what was going on in their day it wasn't now okay you know he didn't sit them down and make them sit a test he walked with them and opened the scriptures to them i mean that then they would understand exactly what is happening now amen brother man would say this he says should make it plain today the thing that we see the holy spirit doing he once said search the scriptures and he wants us to do it today notice he began with moses prophecy now we've got jesus and the two on the way to emmaus now i've gone there he began with moses prophecy the bible said he beginning with moses and all of the prophets he started with moses a prophet said moses the lord your god shall raise up among you among the people the lord god shall raise up a prophet now he might have said purpose and your friend here did not moses say that in these days the lord god would raise up a prophet and this man that they crucified did he meet that qualification now moses prophesied this and now you and now you haven't had a prophet for for hundreds and hundreds of years and here is this man raised up and what was this man's forerunner did you say get it and all the prophets said about him for this age he spoke to them that sure would have been interested to listen at him wouldn't you like to have heard him i'd like to have heard him to hear him what he said what that the prophet said about himself but he ever said it was him he just showed them by prophecy he just said the prophet said this would happen see let's go back a few minutes and now let's listen to the words quoted from himself watching the word itself quoting the word of himself the word itself quoting the word of himself not tell them that he was that but just let the word speak for itself then we know who he was the letter of the word quoting the word in flesh quoting the the word of the letter being fully identified with himself look here now let's listen to him quote now we know that they were all briefed of the late happenings uh that is of the crucifixion and of the story of the resurrection the tomb as we just read now he goes straight to the word of prophecy about himself now let's just think that he said this he said a lot more than this but watch let him say hear him say turn to zechariah 11 12. was it the messiah to be sold according to the prophet for 30 pieces of silver you just said that this man was sold for 30 pieces of silver turn over you're getting the scripture zechariah 11 and 12 and he said did you notice that david said in the psalm psalm 41 and 9 that he was to be portrayed by his friends again then again in zechariah he was forsaken by his disciples then in psalms 35 11 accused accused by false witnesses you just said he was isaiah 53 and 7 he was done before his accusers isaiah 50 and 6 they scourged him the prophet said psalms 22 that he was to cry on the cross my god my god why is that forsaken me did he do that i mean day before yesterday afternoon psalms 22 again 18 his garments were parted among them did they do that and psalms 22 7-8 mocked by his enemies the church psalms 22 again there would not be a bone in his body to be broke but they pierced my hands and my feet he said holding his hands behind him no doubt at the time isaiah 53 and 12 said he had died between male factors isaiah 53 and 9 said he was buried with the rich psalms 16 and 10 said i'll not leave his soul in hell neither shall i see my holy one to see corruption and was not malachi 3 the forerunner of this man oh i'd like to have heard him quote that look at the prophecies notice then all the types he would have went through about isaac in genesis 22 how god foreshadowed isaac and his father abraham took his own son packing the wood up the hill and offered up his own son i like it i just asked that did he do that did this just happen i'll just ask the question about today has he sent a forerunner in this day did he do that did he come down on the ohio river did he do that did a healing revival go around the world did he do that i mean has he called the bride to himself did he do that did he prophesy destruction is coming to the world has he done that is the world falling apart hallelujah has all these things happen hallelujah as a bride being called has you been washed in the blood of the lamb i mean has you be made a new creature in christ amen to the prophecy that i'll pour my spirit out upon all flesh has he done that hallelujah amen [Music] but you don't understand what's going on in the world yes i do all that other stuff let it go on amen but you've got to join the scribes or the pharisees the or the zealots and join in our campaign we're gonna we're gonna deliver israel from the romans oh no let them do what they do let the world do what it does amen let it do what it does go for it but what about the bride of christ we should do what we should do amen hallelujah he's walking with us what did he do he walked with them until they saw he was alive hallelujah because they went into the house and he took the bread and he did something he did before he died he broke the bread and their eyes came open it's the lord hallelujah and then we've had a same ministry in this day what jesus did before his crucifixion he's done again today hallelujah and her eyes have come open master it's you amen you're not a you're not a rumor you're not a nice idea you're alive hallelujah i can say the tomb's empty not because the tomb is empty but because he's alive anyone could have taken his body and buried it someone said look the tomb's empty but it's very different when the one who went into the tomb says i lay my life down i'll take it back up again i'll be with you even in you to the end of the world and he comes and vindicates that promise to you personally hallelujah glory to his name hallelujah amen that's how i know the tomb is empty amen the god that gave the promise is the god here to fulfill the promise hallelujah well there's a lot of things going on in the world let it go on soon and very soon we're going to see the king soon and very soon we're going to see the king he said can he walk with you like that and just make it so live yes he can this is not a pie in the sky idea jesus can so walk with you in his word and make it so alive to your heart transform you in a moment hallelujah amen are you sure about that yeah it happened to me amen this bible became a new book his love filled my heart spoken tongues changed my life hallelujah the bible became a living reality and it still is i've seen him heal the sick i've seen him change the storms i've seen him cast out devils i've seen him come down and change lives i've seen people receive the holy ghost year after year i've seen god transform people i've seen this bible live and i'm not saying that the boast because he's alive geez i was so i'm just i'm just a simple kind of fellow i just realized if if they say he's alive then he's alive and if he's alive i can meet him and if i am he said to me met lord i want to meet you hallelujah and that's the kind of god he is and if he says i'm your comforter then lord you're going to have to comfort me sometimes and i follow them comfy lord i need a guide you need to guide me through this trouble and it guides me through the trouble lord i need you to heal my body he heals my body lord i need you to come on the scene for me and my family and he comes on the scene for me and my family lord i need you to undertake in this troubleless time when the world is falling apart says i'm your rock i'm your foundation i'm your stability i'm your guide in this dark time oh liz it doesn't matter what's going on in the world the world will fall apart worse and worse it'll get worse but there's a people on the earth this this book tells me everything that can be shaken will be shaken rule that cannot be shaken will remain what will remain the kingdom of god and the bride of christ so let the world fall unfortunately yes does it make you happy to say well what happened there with the jews from from jesus day to the structure of jerusalem's repeating again does that make you happy it doesn't make me happy who who in their right mind would rejoice that the world's going to be burned it has to i'm sorry but it doesn't make it doesn't give me any joy that the people i know may go into that i should have heard a big big big fat amen right there are you no none of us are even our worst enemy why would you even want your enemy because the reason you wouldn't want them to go into that is because they had to go stand before a white throne judgment at the end of it why on earth would you want anyone doesn't matter what they did to you and how long and whatever could be years and decades of abuse and scarring and hurting and pain you wouldn't want them to stand in that place so i don't rejoice about these things but the thing is it should give us a real realization remember there is going to be a rapture sir amen just as sure as i'm standing here there will be a translation of a people hallelujah and we are living right in the throes of it amen amen oh but these people want me to do this and this wants me and all this going on put god first in everything put him first in everything and everything will come out just right but put him first hallelujah yes he walked with them to make them realize that he was alive and not just that but to make them realize that they were part of the resurrection hallelujah because remember it wasn't just him that was resurrected there to be a people that were once dead and trespassed and sins be made alive in christ in the upper room hallelujah you know it astounds me and and i'll just find a place to quit but it astounds me jesus appeared to himself jesus appeared to 500 of his disciples but only 120 were in the upper room where were those other people i don't want to be like those other 380 if i can do that you know i don't want to be one of them i would have been one of the 120. yes sir you know so we don't just want to be caught up in something at all you know the lord moving i think no we want to know him personally amen we want to know him in such a way that if you're the only one remember enoch walked with god it was a day it wasn't just you know sometimes we think of enoch as just a green grassy field not a care in the world and god says you want to come up he's like yeah okay there was trouble there was strife there was judgment coming the world was falling apart in his day but yet he could live in an atmosphere he could live in an atmosphere that the only thing that mattered really with him was walking with his lord jesus and that was pointing to you why do you think he died he died that he'd dwell on you not just whatever historical fact that happened but he would make calvary live that you'd actually see the power of the cross living in your life and you'll walk with him in such a way i'm just gonna i'm gonna i'm gonna quit but you say world events go read it i know i've probably said it over the years but go read the the the betrayal of the lord all the way to the resurrection and brotherhood says these are modern events made clear mondevinci you see around them and make clear by that yes you say but what about everything else in the world no that's the event remember the greatest event that's going to take place is that people are going to leave this world who will not taste death that's going to be a big event in the calendar sure the world will go on and not see it but there will be a people and they will walk with god and will be not because god has taken them thank you and i believe by his grace not by oh have you earned it oh no remember people who try and you know people try and uh what do you call it debate or reasoning out with god but i'm a good person i'm this i can sing i'm this i was raised in church all these things remember if you give them all your good you've got to pass them all your bad yes and our righteousness is but filthy rags in his sight so we have nothing in our own nothing to bring to the table he just says meet me surrender your whole being don't just join a church you're not my greatest fear we just joined church [Music] yes that's a failure jesus didn't die to make church members he died that he would live in people he'd die that he'd come and dwell in people and live his word out of people and that's why he died i don't want to just be a church person i'm sorry i'm probably rambling on now but you know he can walk with you in such a way you'll make everything clear all your troubles will vanish remember their broken hearts didn't stay broken hearts can you imagine that you don't know what's going on a few hours later they see him break the breath lord it's you mary goes to the tomb thinks he's a gardener put yourself there i put myself there often and he says to her if you know where he's been taken tell me so i'll carry him away the lord didn't want him to carry carrie didn't want her to carry away a dead body he wanted her to have a resurrection he wanted her to meet him amen hallelujah and she he just said her name and said mary her eyes came open and all her broken hearted disappointments just vanished because she realized what he promised to do he has done it amen hallelujah glory to his name amen god the musicians please our lord lives amen hallelujah let's not be caught up in all these things going on it won't help us none i mean let's let's just stand this morning shall we i'll ask you a question is he that real to you is he that real to you if what i've said is a bit foreign i just want to ask you just want to slip your hand up this morning and say lord make it real where it's no longer just an

up in you lord jesus lord maybe anointed with your spirit lord not like that lord lord there would have been an anointing no doubt upon all the jews for that revolt and that rebellion and all those things but there are another people in that land that are anointed with your holy ghost and they weren't caught up in all those political ploys and pools and fights and all those things lord they were caught up in you so lord i pray we would be that category of people today lord i just asked you to touch each one here and lord i just pray that we wouldn't wander off into other things but we just
