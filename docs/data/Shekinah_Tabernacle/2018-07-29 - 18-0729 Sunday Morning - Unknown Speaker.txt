it's a type of when the Lord was at Gethsemane he had to make the choice of whether he was going to go all the way with the Lord or when he was he was gonna go all the way to Calvary or not essentially whether he was going to pay the ultimate price he came to that point and it's a type in our life you know we get to that point where we have to decide am I going to go and give everything up for the Lord or am I going to what road am I going to take in this was a song I wrote at that time when I made that choice to go all the way with the Lord and you understand what the words of the song [Music] there's a cool from a land far away and it's reached the high huts of every party to this day [Music] on the mountains on the seats on the rivers and the valleys it's been spoken [Music]

musicians good to have everyone here great to have all the visitors god bless you all trust you feel at home I mean let's um let's go to Hebrews chapter 12 this is not on the PowerPoint but um see if we can drive this thing okay we're not going there yet but we'll go here first so Hebrews 12 and we're going to read from verse 18 [Music] see it's here for ye o not come onto the mount that might be touched that burnt with fire nor unto blackness and darkness and tempest in the sound of a trumpet and the voice of words which voice they that heard and treated that the word should not be spoken to them anymore for they could not endure that which was commanded and if so much as a beast touch the mountain it shall be stoned or thrust through with a dart and so terrible was the sight that Moses said I exceedingly fear and quake but ye are come unto Mount Zion and unto the city of the Living God the heavenly Jerusalem and to an innumerable company of angels to the General Assembly and Church of the firstborn which are written in heaven and to God the judge of all and to the spirits of just men made perfect and to Jesus the mediator of the New Covenant and to the blood of sprinkling that speaketh better things than that of Abel amen let's go to Psalms chapter 50 and we're going to read the first six verses of of Psalms 50 this is the mighty God even the Lord has spoken and called the Earth from the rising of the Sun until the going down thereof out of Zion out of Zion notice we're out of Zion the perfection of beauty God has shined our God shall come and shall not keep silence a fire shall devour before him and I shall be very tempura surround about him and he shall call to the heavens from above and to the earth that he may judge his people gather my Saints together unto me those that have made a covenant with me by sacrifice and the heavens shall declare his righteousness before God has judged himself Selah which means a pause Amen may the Lord blesses word you may have your seats this morning now I want to talk about I want to talk about with the help well I pray by God's help you know Zion this morning you know that where we women read about Zion or we read in in in in Hebrews chapter 12 their Zion it speaks of a of a place we know the City of God was cool I mean the City of David was Zion but it also speaks of people it's not just a physical location on a map but it's actually a people that have been redeemed they've been washed in the blood of the Lamb and and God dwells in those people and God shines out his light from them now we read there in Hebrews chapter 12 where Paul as Paul is talking to the Hebrews he's trying to get them to see that what they have you know if you read the book of Hebrews is always contrasting the blood of bulls and goats with the blood of Jesus Christ he's contrasting you know the you know the Aaronic priesthood and the high priest of natural priesthood to the priesthood the other priesthood of Jesus Christ him him being our high priest he's saying that what we have is greater than what they had on the blood of bulls and goats it's more powerful it changes people I mean you don't have to offer a sacrifice year after year or you know but by one blood by one offering he has perfected them forever that he is sanctified so we don't have to go and repeat and offer a goat or a sheep or you know a bull you know for our sin offering but his blood is enough I mean his offering is enough hallelujah because under the blood of bulls and goats if you know whatever caused me to take my take my lamb you know on my behalf because I send you know that that lamb was given on my behalf and I was justified in the sight of God because God received that sacrifice but the thing that was within me that caused me to sin and bring their sacrifice it was still there it would not change my heart I still had the same nature yet being as sincere as relied on and waiting to serve God but still my nature was still unchanged so I would come back possibly the next year and the same thing I did the year before it would cause me to fall in sin again and I would offer another layer and the cycle would repeat but under the blood of Jesus Christ I mean we do not stay in that same cycle of sin and getting up and sitting and getting yo-yo it's not that cycle but God breaks that cycle I mean where he comes in and his blood changes the nature of the believer that the thing that once we had them in prison Amen would would be broken by the blood of Jesus Christ and they do not have the desire for that sin anymore that's what the power of the blood does I mean it's not just saying I believe in Jesus but that life that was released that day on Calvary comes into the believer and they had not been be sitting by sin anymore I mean we are free the believer is free indeed we're not under the bondage of sin and death anymore because this blood has loosed us yes he has set us free from that and now we can walk with Him hallelujah so that so Paul is trying to tell the Hebrews here that you have not come to this mountain Amen you have not come to Mount Mount Sinai where the law was given I mean where where they were looking you know the children of Israel said to Moses and Moses said it to God whatever you tell us we will do and then the law came the law came and they began to find out they could not keep this law and you can and that is shown by the multitudes of animal sacrifice that was given I don't know how many animals they on yo the amount of animal blood that was shed upon the earth because they could not keep the law amen but then you know but Paul is saying you have not come here you have not journey to this place you have come to a better place hallelujah he says now but you have come to Mount Zion and to the city of the Living God I mean where God dwells right God doesn't just dwell in heaven he dwells in the heart of the believer Amen when when the day of Pentecost was fully come come God came down he dwells in 120 I mean the beginning of the New Testament era God came and dwelt in his people the Apostle Peter said that we are living stones lively stones built up into the temple of God hallelujah so we're not we're not you know we're not just a bunch of people gathered we were living people you know Jesus was taken you know he was walking around the temple in his day with the disciples and and one of the disciples said what what good stones are here look at this masonry how incredible this is and Jesus was saying really he could have see it don't know you shouldn't marvel at those stones that's just man cutting stones and putting it into a building it has no you know it's just a structure that man is built I mean but Jesus was gathering living stones when he called the disciples come and follow me he was gathering stones for his building I mean when he went to the woman at the well she was the stones for the building holy really Jim was the stones for the building Peter James and John returned for the building hallelujah USA you know Jesus could have said don't worry about this temple look at these stones I'm gathering hallelujah and it's the same thing today friends I meant that the believers in this day a part of the building of God I mean where God will take you shape you hallelujah like Solomon when he built the temple there's there's materials from different parts of the earth came came together in Jerusalem and he built thee and he built the temple and it's the same thing with us we maybe gather all different parts of the world it's really irrelevant where you come from it's where you end up that's the main thing I mean you may have been from the opposite side of the world but when God found you it's not necessarily moving to a physical location it's a spiritual location I mean where once dead in trespasses and sins God takes you because he knows where the stones have to go he knows how his building goes together hallelujah and he finds you and he shapes you and he mulch you and he places you in the body hallelujah so we've come to the city of the Living God the heavenly Jerusalem and to an innumerable company of angels you know jesus's ministry a large part of it was to open that unseen realm to the people here was Peter James and John you know then you have God and you want God to the Mose day all the headers the concept of a God that you know he spoke to them back there but where is he today and they well then you was fishing and you know some parts of the scripture was just in their mind and he comes he comes God and flesh gathers them he heals the sick cast out the Devils controls nature raises the dead hallelujah begins to speak about he he opened a spiritual realm to them to show them that life is more than just what you see or what you hear or what you feel what you smell it's more than just natural senses there's the realm that's far greater than we can see and God was wanting them to see what you see around you is just a small part of of creation but this heaven Hallowed is Angel's I mean is God amen there's also the devil and his demons amen but we have come to an innumerable company of angels now it's amazing when you know you think of Isaiah I mean sorry Alice I mean Elijah there is in the city of Dothan there the Syrians come to try and catch him you know and and his servant comes out in the morning and he gets so scared because he sees a Syrian army around around the city and he's getting worried probably maybe he woke up Elijah Elisha we're in trouble how are we going to escape out of the city the Syrians have found us what's going to happen and they and then Elijah sis don't worry it's okay it's more for us than against us you know and he just prayed Lord open my servants eyes and in the servant was more worried and shaken by the armies of heaven I'm in there around the Prophet amen Elijah's your Elijah's prayer didn't bring the angels of God down the army of heaven down and just opened the servants eyes that the servant would understand that the armies of heaven are kept around the prophet of God hallelujah and now if that is the case under the blood of bulls and goats now how much more people that have been washed in the blood of Jesus Christ I mean they've been quickened by his spirit I mean the bone of his bone life is why pleasure is flesh I mean you have a lot of security around you I mean yeah we thinking the presidents and all the you know all of their security around them that's nothing compared to you I mean you've got a security detail I mean I can't assign to you every day of your life and the enemy he could only touch you with God's permission right God knows what's going to happen and God allows it to prove his salvation hallelujah hey your job could stand on the you know all he had was offer a lamb and your foot it in fear on behalf of his family his children he offered a land for them least win the least they would send his word that they would send me something wrong who's read the book of Job he applied he offered the sacrifice on the Bahamas family out of fear and that's all he knew he didn't know who really God was or what was going to happen you're on the life after this he said a tree you know your flower it dies it comes back to life again tree can do the same you know he saw he saw nature come back to life after it died this is man where does he go he had no idea and he had no idea that the devil had gone and spoken to God and God pointed Jobe out and God said this is a perfect man and he's just living his life he's got his family in his business and whatever more you know and God points him out he's your he's perfect he's none like him and he doesn't know what's going on and his job and then the next day you know he whole bunch of servants come in to him he says you know you know sheep have been taken these animals being killed by lightning all these things last one that comes and says all of your children were in a house and the wind blew and it fell down and killed them all and there he was but he was standing on the lamb in you that God required the blood of a lamb hallelujah and and and he was he was perfect because he stood he knew that that's what God required and God accepted that sacrifice but the whole trial was now before the trial as I said he says he sees nature come back to life where does he go but then at the end of the trial he could stand and say now I know my redeemer lives and though the skin worms you know eat up this flesh with my eyes I'll see God and I'll stand with him on the last days upon the earth and opened the hole and opened eternity to him the trial openly yo the trial opened an unseen round to him right make God real to him hallelujah amen and God and you know as I said God wants to prove his salvation and in jobs day the blood of a lamb was salvation for them and God wanted to prove it in jobs life even though he didn't understand he could stand on that lamb amen now a new rule company of angels angels are still here hallelujah the Holy Ghost is definitely here God is present amen to the General Assembly and the Church of the firstborn amen God doesn't have grandchildren God has children that are birthed by his Spirit I mean which are written in heaven our names are written in heaven I'm just going to go very quickly through this cuz we go to the rest of our message and to God the judge of all and to the spirits of just men made perfect now sometimes when we think of God being a judge worse think of you know ways think of judging as in finding people guilty but a judge doesn't always find people guilty he finds people innocent right it's like when the woman was caught in adultery I think it was in John chapter 8 I mean in she's brought before by the scribes and Pharisees she's brought before Jesus and now now the thing is you know they say to him this woman was caught in adultery in the very act now the law of Moses is the man and the woman should be brought but they just pervert the word and they just bring the woman because they're trying to catch God they're trying to catch God out right but then this whole scene is actually now that and then Jesus doesn't say wood it begins to write in the sand you know they see it's he that without sin let him cast the first stone and from the oldest to the youngest they dropped their stones and they walk away convicted by their own conscience and then Jesus says her woman wears on accusers and he says there are none Lord she recognizes more than a man she was standing in the presence of right and and then she said he says to her neither do i condemn me God said no more so don't go back to your old life I mean but you've been but but he acquitted her she was found innocent right her judge his judgment actually set her free I mean that the accusers voice was silenced because the judge was standing there and set her free that's the same thing with us now when the devil comes to accuse you before God saying they did this to me this way and their this way I mean God looks at it says no they never did it in the first place my blood has cleansed them right I've been set free I'm talking about the real believer picture here is justice righteous by his own offering Alou you and to the spirits of just men made perfect now notice it does not say the bodies have just been made perfect but the spirits of just men made perfect this body has to be changed we know that the soul is redeemed right but this body it needs a body change right but the spirits of just men made perfect is that God would fully cleanser people right so the things that we are born with amen or the devil you know the you know the Prophet tells us it's very easy to actually catch an evil spirit without realizing it we can sympathize with someone and that spirit that Sodom can come on us and we can catch it without even realizing come under the influence of a demon power right and then so but God but the Apostle Paul is saying we have come to a place where the spirits of just men have been made perfect so there's been a full cleansing I mean of the spiritual part of a person right so all the pride is gone right all the lust has got all the wrath and the anger and the malice and the strife and the bitterness is gone hallelujah being cleansed hallelujah I mean we don't have to walk around with unforgiveness and bitterness and deceit having a lying spirit hallelujah we don't have to carry those things the blood of Jesus Christ cleanses from motion I mean temper problem you don't have to carry that round lost you don't have to carry that round why do we tear the devil's bags I'm not the devil's bag boy to carry the devil's bags he can carry his own luggage hallelujah isn't that right we sign for too much stuff we take on well I've always been this way and my granddad was this way my great granddad was this way that's just how I am where's your identity right I was born a glowing that's my last name but God but God gave me a new birth he changed my nature right he changed who I was not me trying to change myself you just gotta surrender you you'll be willing to forsake all then you can become his disciple you know forsake your old life forsake your old way hallelujah and then by that now he changed my nature that I begin to find out my real my natural parents are still my natural presence and I love them but my real father is God I made it if my real father is God I want to be like him hallelujah children want to be like their parents when they young they want to be just like mommy or daddy right but then so when you begin to when God reveals it to you that actually your father is God you ought to be like him and God is his word right would it be like his word amen so now we where where is your identity should be with Jesus Christ the word amen and to Jesus the mediator of the New Covenant and to the blood of sprinkling that speaketh better things than that of Abel this is where we've come now Abel's blood could not redeem Abel's blood can only cry out for you know that that he had been killed but his blood couldn't do anything right but the blood of Jesus Christ cleans us from all sin it transforms a people there's a power in the blood there's more than a religion it becomes a life it becomes a reality in your life I mean where you're no longer it's no longer either liveth but Christ liveth in me amen and he's still the mediator of the New Covenant now our mediators you know he's the go-between between both parties right so he is ever alive to make intercession for us I mean to stand in the gap on our behalf the scripture says that he is our advocate we have an advocate which is Jesus Christ and advocate works on your behalf amen you know we are saved by grace and our workers by grace and the definition of New Testament Grace's of the divine influence upon the heart and it's reflection and the life that's Grace when grace comes into your life amen God moves on these are divine influence upon your heart Lord I want to live your word I want to see a word manifested in me I mean that you'll be living hallelujah and there's a reflection in the life I mean as I've seen well you know while ago you can take Hebrews 11 the chapter before this the faith chapter and you can call it the works chapter because works is what man sees faith is what God sees so you say by works Noah built the ark because that's what man was seeing but by faith he's built it because it was revealed to him it's kind of there's going to be a flood but his life was not expressing his faith hallelujah Abraham's life by leaving where he was you know going to a country he didn't know of dwelling there there that was an expression of his faith Moses going down to Egypt with a rod to deliver Israel that was that those works was an expression of his faith right so by works he delivered right because that's what man saw hallelujah Joshua amen him taking the land dividing it to Israel that was an expression of his faith he had to believe that he had the ministry to place the people in the land Alleluia you go through David as well I mean David you can see his faith was expressed in his life and his works he knew he had come to the throne at the right time he didn't have to kill Saul he had two opportunities to do so right but he knew God would bring him to the throne at the right time so his life was an expression of his faith and James his faith without works is dead you need both together what works is faith express your life should be an expression of what you believe and our life is an expression of what we believe amen now we read in Psalms 50 that out of Zion the perfection of beauty God has shined now when God looks what man calls Beauty and what God calls be there's two different things you see the Tabernacle in the wilderness I'll show the picture of the replica it's just a tent I say we we say well that's just a tip man would say that's just a tent God would say that's beautiful amen Israel dwelling in its homeland living as you're living with God God in the midst would say well that's just a bunch of people you know there's nothing too special God say that's beauty God has always failed in every generation he has failed and he speaks through a veil and Moses day Moses was the veil right here was an 80 year old man with a staff his wife she's with the two boys going you know a back of a mule whatever they're on they went down into Egypt and it you know you know just the casual observation say well that's just an old man with his wife and two boys now here was God now God had taken someone God was veiled God was going to speak God was going to do here is veiled and and there's always the problem sometimes we forget well sometimes people do not understand God is always hidden and he reveals himself you're the hardest thing to do is for immortal to get another mortal to believe them I mean it's always been a battle to get a mortal to believe another mortal you can say well you're just you and this is what you think no but you know sometimes it's more than that and we find out here that God has always been had skin on him when Moses seen him he had skin on him look like a man when God was behind the curtains he had skin on him and gods night and his churches veiled in his church with skin on it he is still the same God tonight we find that but now as ever the skin veils what catches the traditions you just can't believe that that God is making them people act like that see it's because God has veiled in his church and skin skin on it that's right he has had from the unbeliever and reveal to the believer yes sir God was veiled in Jesus Christ I mean God was veiled in his church you read Acts chapter 9 Paul's on the road to Damascus God comes to him light shines upon him he says who are you Lord that word a lot of Supreme one who are you he says I'm Jesus whom you persecute now Paul wasn't chasing after a supernatural light he was looking for Christians and he wanted to put them in prison that's what he is doing but God was saying now you're persecuting me because I'm veiled in those people amen it's a God as always veiled and God should be veiled today I mean if you really know the Lord Jesus Christ he'll be in you his Holy Spirit will be in you know when just be with you he died on Calvary that he was dwelling man he'd reveal himself through man this that's what he's always wanted now let's go to Isaiah 12 [Music] [Music] better each from verse three from verse 1 do a bit of reading now if that's ok as they're 12 and 1 and in that day and in that day thou shalt say O Lord I will praise thee thou was angry with me that anger has turned away and now comfort us me behold god is my salvation i will trust and not be afraid for the lord jehovah is my strength and my song he has also become my salvation wherefore withdrawing show you drew water out of the wells of salvation and in that day shall you say praise the lord call upon his name declare his doings among the people make mention that his name is exalted sing unto the Lord for he hath done excellent things this is known in all the earth cry out and shout thou inhabitant of Zion for great is the Holy One of Israel in the midst of thee amen jehovah of the Old Testament is Jesus Christ of the new hallelujah see sang with joy draw out well he says he says with joy therefore with joy show you draw out water out of the wells of salvation amen if we really recognize who is among us hallelujah there's such joy amen if you need to you know if there's anything you have need of draw it out with joy what you redeem me Lord you've washed me there's power in your confession Amen you've got to speak it right you wanna say Lord you're my healer Lord you're my Savior you're my Redeemer you're my comforter hallelujah cover me Lord ah morning although you're my strength the joy the Lord is our strength hallelujah you say well now we read they're the spirits of just men made perfect that's the believers condition in this day now many people you may think well how can I be that way well the season seeing Corinthians 5:21 he that hath made for he hath made him to be sin for us speaking of Jesus who knew no sin now it's very easy to say that he was made sin here's our sin offering Amen that we that we might be made the righteousness of God in him you ought to you ought to believe both parts of the scripture he was made sin for me that I'd become 8 be be made his righteousness amen so if he was made sin who believed he was made sin for me sin for you he took your son up to Calvary he was your sin offering he went to hell on your behalf there you don't need to go there Amen he he died a sinner in your place that is a righteous one you'd go to heaven however he took your place that day you don't need to go to hell Jesus already gone here he went he took your son down there that you don't need to take your own son down there and be stand and be stuck there hallelujah what an exchange isn't it wonderful I mean that we might be made the righteousness of God in him so therefore the real believer is as righteous as God is righteous Amen is as holy as God as holy as this pure as God as pure is that too strong I don't think that's too strong you know if if he took my place that I'll be made in His image and if he was holy and pure and righteous without spot he said I'm going to have a bride have a church without spot or wrinkle or any such thing and it's his doing it's his blood amen and then when that comes and when the life that was released at down Calvary comes unto you you'll live that life too sure what you are amen it's his doing aren't you glad he told his doing and you're glad I told him you just yield yourself and I'll just say well he's gonna do it it's like love doing hallelujah and your faith draws you in pay him in and then he takes you and changes your nature amen glory to God I'm glad I'm glad faith brings the promise down right faith doesn't push the promise away faith brings the promise to you I miss just like Abraham the same faith that he believed God to leave his land and gun to the promised land that same faith poured Isaac I mean to the same faith Lord forgive me same face should be Lord fill me fill me with your spirit brings the Holy Ghost down hallelujah amen it doesn't push faith speakers on this wise the word is nigh thee even in thy mouth right doesn't say doesn't say you know who will cool them down from above or you know up from below no it says faith speaketh on this wise the word is nigh thee even in thy mouth even in my heart the word which we preach so he's saying that the works he's saying and Jesus's word right so he say he's not distant faith doesn't say he's distant faces he's present I mean that the promise is present Alleluia now with joy shall you draw out the water of the wells of salvation that Jesus said this he says jesus answered to seed unto her the woman at the well if thou knewest the gift of God and who it is that saith to thee give me to drink thou wouldest have asked of him and he would have given thee living water the woman said I'm saith unto her Sir thou has nothing to draw with and the well is deep from whence then hast thou that living water now let's just read this he says in John 7 and the last days of that great feast Jesus stood up and cried saying if any man thirst let him come unto me and drink he that believeth on me as the scripture saith out of his belly shall flow rivers of living living water but he spake but he this spake he of a spirit which they that believe on him should receive for the Holy Ghost was not yet given because Jesus was not yet glorified so he sang to the woman at the well you need to drink of this water you need a drink of this water and if you drink of this water you'll never thirst again but then he also says now if you have this water it will flow out of you out of your belly will flow of living water speaking of the Spirit of God so the people that really know their God there'll be an outlet right it just won't be going in and then and end them I mean gonna be flowing out and out and out kaalia flying a river of living water it's not a trickle it's a gusher hell yeah a river is a lot of water moving hallelujah so you say now the Spirit of God will come unto them and will flow out hallelujah and that's the glory that shines out of Zion right as the Spirit of God shining forth I mean that when you come in contact with believers I mean sometimes you go away you feel so refreshed hallelujah because you cover the presence of God doesn't matter how they may be feeling necessarily you say I feel so refreshed I feel so much better cuz of that fellowship I did why is that because you've been in the prints of living water has been flowing through them from one part of the body to the other hallelujah isn't that right hey man it's not just what God pulls in and it stays there it pours out hallelujah you see that over the day of Pentecost he comes the great source of the great gusher it comes into the room like the sound of rushing mighty wind fills each one I mean they didn't just say this same wasn't that a wonderful experience they burst out of that place holy they begin to dance and shout and act like a bunch of drunk people under the intoxication of the Spirit now they could live with everyday life hallelujah we're gonna get drunk on some bunch of alcohol there's a spurt we're gonna be drunk on which is a spirit of God hallelujah and they didn't stay there they burst out of that place because the life has to spread right life has to spread love just straight I mean you see you know like here we have the roar up in Canada there's the rut with the moose and stuff you know those moose will take on trains they'll take on a train he comes a freight train they're on the tracks something's in them this is a threat something something life must come forth and they'll take on anything hallelujah because life must come hallelujah and how much more than believer and we're more than just animal life I mean we're redeemed and daughters of God but they should be something in you life must be expression life must come for hallelujah let's must go for a me that's how it should be you can't hide it under a bushel I'm gonna let it shine hallelujah Amen that's how it should be why because out of the believer comes this river of living water amen and you can't stop it flowing there's something bubbling so our program tells the story when he's hunting he comes to the stream and it's bubbling he says you know if the stream could talk you have a conversation what makes you bubble stream that's because the deer come mr. deer comes and drinks from you seeis no because mr. beer or whoever else comes into Encino he says well why do you bubble because it's something pushing from the inside which is pushing the water up hallelujah should be the same thing with the believer there's something in me that's pushing this out I can't stop it it must come forth hallelujah and how I live and how I speak and hard treat one another there's a life coming lujah I'm so glad it bubbles so you believe it it's bubbling it's bubbling deep with them we're singing you're laughing or whatever it goes you know the song some folks don't understand it what's wrong with these people but I can't keep it quiet it's bubbling bubbling bubbling day and night hallelujah there's nothing wrong with being excited well you should be excited Amy what's wrong with this is glorious what do you mean I'm going to heaven I've got any title life I mean I've got overcoming power of the devil I got peace with God what what is there not to be excited about you know all all this in heaven - what do you mean we just get it all here you get it all can you really have it all yeah but it depends what you're talking about I mean with God you can't have it all you can't have your cake and eat it too Oh glory to God I'm so glad that's the way amen but now as I said about we've come to a you know come to a company of a your company of angels we have to look how god we have to what we speak about ourselves should be what God says about us must be that way our testimony and God's testimony to be the same right we can't speak contrary to what God says about us I mean and our lives should speak what God says about us even more hallelujah just like brother Graham tells the story of that slave there's witness you know slavery and you know in America slave owner goes to a plantation looking to buy slaves and he say and it's re-examines all the slaves he sees this one and he goes to the plantation owner what's different with this one does he eat different no eats the same does he sleep in different places the other slaves no he he he sleeps in the same bunkhouse or whatever does he do any different kind of work no he does the same work what makes him different and the plantation owner says I was wondering that myself because the slave was acting very different to the others he worked hard I mean but you know he was different conducted himself a different kind of way and then so the plantation owner Tulsa tells the slave boy I was wondering this myself I come to find out that he's a King son and his father is a king of a tribe in Africa and though he may never go on and and and take over his father's Kingdom he knows he's a son of a king so he he conducts himself as a king son hallelujah should be the same thing we're in the same world as everyone else we're not in a bubble weren't in some commune and some up in the mountains in there where we eat the same kind of food we have the same kind of trials we're the same kind of hardship right but yet there should be something in us that we conduct ourselves differently I mean because we're kings children amen we're Kings children Alleluia I trust that you know that he means we should conduct yourself because I'm a son of the king hallelujah amen so his his testimony was the same as his father's testimony back in Africa that's my son that was taken he's a king son and he's here in America saying I'm a king son and he loved according to who he was so our testimony and God's testimony vows needs to be the same this is speaking here in Isaiah 49 it says they shall not hunger nor thirst neither shall the heat nor Sun smite them for he that hath mercy on them shall lead them even by the Springs of water shall he guide them and I will make all I will make all my mountains away my highway shall be exalted behold these shall come from the far and low from the north and from the west and these are the land of of cinema and then he says here sing o heavens we have that up there sing sorry let's go back a bit technology isaiah 40:8 sorry 49 8 & 9 we'll start from there they'll say the Lord an acceptable time have I heard thee and in a day of salvation have I helped thee and I'll preserve thee and give thee for a covenant of other people to establish youth to caused to inherit the desolate Heritage's that thou may say to the prisoners go forth to them that are in darkness show yourselves they shall feed in the waist and their pastures shall be in all high places they shall not hunger nor thirst neither shall the heat nor Sun smite them for he that hath mercy on them shall lead them even by the Springs of water shall he guide them and I will make all my mountains away and my highway shall be exalted behold these shall come from far and low these from the north and from the west and these from the land of of sinem singer heavens and be joyful on earth break forth into singing o mountains for the LORD hath comforted us people and will have mercy upon his afflicted I mean say sang sing be glad shout rejoice a man for the Lord has comforted his people Amen and he will have mercy upon his afflicted has he had mercy upon you amen has he comforted you hallelujah but Zion seed now notice now no it doesn't say science IDO I will sing our heavens and be joyful and and and I'll break for them to singing for the Lord has comforted me and he has had mercy upon me that was afflicted it doesn't say that it sees bazan said the Lord has forsaken me my Lord has forgotten me this is her testimony see this is sometimes we feel this way the Lord's forgotten me it's like I'm praying to a wall you know sometimes God will allow these things to happen sometimes they feel like I'm just not getting anywhere God wants to see what you're gonna do when your revival maybe is taken away are you going to stand upon the word and keep plowing through well you say well I don't feel it so I won't do it right we should do it because we believe it not because we just feel it I mean because when it's all taken away what are you gonna stand on your feelings one day you're feeling like Lord of I'm ready for the rapture now Here I am the next day Oh Lord am I ever going to make it it's feelings that's feelings don't go by feelings got my faith what do you believe in what does that get in your soul has this wood anchored in your soul stay on that stay on that word halle-loo cuz the devil will beat you around the devil knows how we built he studied us for thousands of years he knows how man works amen he's very good at working against us because he knows how men is built so we can't fall into his traps of walking by feeling we are full of joy unspeakable full of glory both Graham says that the church doesn't understand you know you know those it's not revealed to that he doesn't understand they don't understand the extreme joy that the church enjoys right now so there's times of joy but I'm saying when that's taken away what are you standing on amen do we have joy oh yeah now the Lord has forsaken me my child I mean time my my Lord has forgotten me can a woman forget her suckling child that she should not have compassion on the son of a worm yeah they may forget that's incredible well of course I've never given birth cuz I'm not a woman but I think you'd remember that you do remember having a child right you would remember that it wouldn't be a day that you are when did that happen but God says a woman can even forget having a child but he says now yeah they may forget see but will I not forget thee behold I have graven the upon the palms of my hands the walls are continually before me oh there's a god yeah we have to start testifying how God's is about us if he says I'm sinless some sunless the feces I've been made a saint by his blood I'm a saint right just like brother Albert Christine's dad's testimony when when God is dealing with him any and he's in Switzerland he's at a church service you know and it any talks to the evangelists and you know they're talking about things and and then there's a scripture that I think the Evangelist reads about being a saint being sanctified and the Avenger sister we'll have you ever thanked him for it he doesn't feel like a saint at that time and he says whatever you think them and they pray they thank him and then brother Albert's driving driving in his car for the meeting God comes down and he's got to pull the car because he's shouting and rejoicing because what he read he thanked him out of a heart of faith and believeth not trying not trying but it was that he actually believed it that God could make him a saint and God made him a saint right so his faith made the promise come alive to him amen and that's why we should thank him we should be thankful hallelujah amen now out of Zion he has shined and God calls her the perfection of beauty you take a people now God and nature nature is run just by instinct and it's out you know birds have to migrate or something zone they to move or eels or salmon or whatever great your migrations but it's built in them it's hardwired angels were made to worship God you know they were just built to worship right but man now is on a free moral agency and so the believer now out of their own heart and choice when God offers eternal life to them they say yes will you forsake all and follow me yes right will you live for me something in them just says yes right so now here's a people you know the devil doesn't think too much of humanity look at how he's made the world it's just you know he doesn't care and this world is trying to tell us that we are not important right we just a number we're just a bunch of genes it doesn't matter we are not important that's what the devil's trying to tell us right but God doesn't want us to think that way we are important to God we are special to God right and he takes a people that were born and sin shaped at iniquity come to the world speaking lies he takes them takes them out of the muck and mire of the world cleanses us God does a full cleansing I mean God does a full washing hallelujah God does a transformation and then he takes us and said such as jewels and his crown amen and normally when you see a king of something with a big crown and all this what we'd call bling you don't really look at the person you look at the jewels you say man that that King must be pretty loaded look at the big crannies God on his head right your chechen is drawn to the jewel but the jewel was cut it was set by a skilled craftsman I mean to reflect something and God takes you we can be a dot who who's never seen a diamond when it's just cut out of the ground it doesn't look like a diamond but that you may see in some jewelry it just looks like a piece of rock nothing too special that's like us we're just laying in the earth whatever you know wherever we're hewed from I mean God takes us but in his heart he's like this is the perfection of beauty in this jewel is my perfection of beauty and he takes us and he cuts his password he holds us up to the light cat sister but Maul polishes us now his lot can shine through hallelujah and then we said in his crown hallelujah and God says she is the perfection of beauty doesn't matter what the world says about beauty what does God say are people that are yielded to him I mean that are in their possession praising praising him out of a willing heart loving for him out of a willing heart letting him come and reflect himself through them holy and the beauty of holiness now that's Beauty to God amen now God said so Jesus so Adam and Eve Adam was called the first Adam right but then he calls Jesus the last Adam in the New Testament so now but there was the first Eve now there has to be a last Eve which is the church from Calvary - now there has to be a ransom group of people not just one woman but a whole body of people were just symbolized in that one woman right so there has to be now now brother Branham says when when we when God made the earth and everything and he and he made Eden and he put man in Eden you know and then he took out of Adam the woman he said that's Dells God's masterpiece family after he made that then he rested but then he said the devil Kaman was sin any and he broke it I think God has been rebuilding and through the Old Testament God was rebuilding the man because when Jesus his disciples came to him and Jesus asked him who do men say that I am they say some say you're Elijah Jeremias or one of the prophets it's because what they read about of you know you know Elias or Jeremiah where the prophets doing they could see in jesus's life so God through the prophets was rebuilding the man then finally all that was in the prophets the fall as the Godhead bodily was now in one man Christ Jesus there was the man restored right but now this where's the woman there's going to be a restoration of Eden dance to be and and and Jesus called the last Adam there has to be a last thief right so from Calvary down to now God has been building the woman hallelujah and so we'll see what does this got to do with the perfection of beauty being Zion now when God builds a masterpiece he builds a masterpiece he is the best artist he is the best sculptor maker he knows what he's doing so he took so he showed what a man should be in Jesus Christ he showed his character and a man doesn't and Jesus was a masterpiece don't you think he remains spake like this man there were men did things like this man did there are men treated people like how how he treated people how compassion was led by the Spirit of God wasn't oneness with the you know with God his father the spirit in him did the works and men he says I always do that which pleases my father hallelujah that's just the man now what about the woman Jesus died that now the last Eve would be formed from Calvary down to now and so if God is saying that Zion is the perfection of beauty see how do you look at yourself now I don't think it's proud to say that I'm gonna you know you know that I am sinless I'm virtuous I'm as holy as God as holy I'm part of his bride to me there's not being proud because if he's made me a certain way you know if you're made a certain way and he reveals it to you you're not proud about it for one right you're not arrogant the scribes and Pharisees they you know they received the same word that Moses received Moses received the law in Mount Sinai by revelation describes the Pharisee received it just by learning Moses was the meekest man in all the earth and God revealing himself to Moses made him that way right but the scribes Pharisees they just learned it they they became proud arrogant people and so now if it's a revelation to you this is what God has made you you don't become proud you become humble and yielded and thankful right but if he's made me thus then shouldn't I say this is what I am is it wrong to say like if David it's been anointed to be king of Israel would it wrong to be for him to say one day I'm going to be king God's made me king now I'm King right but the devil doesn't want you to believe in what God has made you to be he doesn't he doesn't want you to live according to your privilege he wants you to live under your privilege but let's but I believe we should live according to our privilege I mean let's not live below our privileges let's live according to our privileges in Christ Jesus amen let's have let's have the musicians let's just wind it up there but if God says the church is the perfection of beauty I say yay Lord and he is shined out of her hallelujah I say Lord shine forth your glory and the world may not understand it but they've never understood it I mean I trust you love them this morning let's just wait sorry can we just have one more we have that again let's read this last I move then we'll finish there won't be electronics in heaven I can just read it to you [Music] it's on my email should be oh did you know if you're close you that's right I just read it off here notice the great masterpiece of the family the husband and wife cannot be truly family unless they are one they have to be if they're not they're not a good family wife pulling one of my husband the other they'll be making awful family but an agreement with loved one to the other that's a family and now that's was God's masterpiece and now all the true family here portrays that see and now the masterpiece family has come again Christ and his bride ready to come the second Adam the second Eve ready now to return back to their home and the whole picture has been redemption from where it was bring it back see just bringing it back again hallelujah aren't you glad say Lord I'm so glad I'm part of your plane I mean I'm so glad I'm part of your plan of redemption hallelujah you gave me this part of you know I'm not the other side I'm I'm part of your body I'm in now okay well I'll leave this look I mean they stand shall we hello yeah don't leave the DEA will beat you down and say you're not worthy you're not worth it whatever you say no the Lord has made me sinless he's redeemed me he became sin for me that I've become the very righteousness of God in Christ hallelujah I mean yes I mean listen use of life Lord Jesus you've redeemed me and you called me by my name you have touched and changed me I can never be the same Lord Jesus you have healed me and you called me by my name [Music] you've have forever changed me I can never be the same oh now I'm
