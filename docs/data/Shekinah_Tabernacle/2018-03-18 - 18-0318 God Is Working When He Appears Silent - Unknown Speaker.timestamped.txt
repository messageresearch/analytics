[38:27] after that we're going to have the AGM
[38:28] either there or here depending on time
[38:31] it means let's turn to first Kings
[38:34] chapter 1 and then we're going to go to
[38:37] we're going to read a scripture from
[38:40] Matthew 26
[38:43] I heard a bit of preaching along these
[38:46] lines and I kind of took a bit of a
[38:48] thought and I wanted to expand it out
[38:51] it's very interesting I want to if I
[38:56] could title this before we read I want
[38:58] to preach on God is working when he
[39:00] appears to be silent and it's his first
[39:04] kings one
[39:05] I'm gonna read down here it says now
[39:07] King David was old and stricken in years
[39:09] and they covered him with clothes but he
[39:12] get no heat where for his servants said
[39:14] unto him let us let there be sought for
[39:18] my lord the king of young virgin let her
[39:20] stand before the king and let her
[39:22] cherish him and let her lie my bosom
[39:26] that my lord the king may get heat so
[39:28] they sought for a fair damsel throughout
[39:30] all the coasts of Israel and found
[39:32] Abishag Humanite and brought her to the
[39:34] king and the damsel was very fair and
[39:37] cherished the king and ministered to him
[39:39] but the king knew her not now we'll come
[39:43] back to those but see no notice now then
[39:46] at a Niger the son of hagath exalted
[39:49] himself saying I will be king and he
[39:52] prepared of chariots and horsemen and
[39:54] fifty men to run before him and his
[39:56] father had not displeased him at any
[39:58] time and saying why has thou done so and
[40:00] he was a very goodly man and his mother
[40:03] being be him after Absalom and he
[40:06] confirmed conferred with Joab the son of
[40:08] Zuria and abbath of the priests and they
[40:11] follow and they following Adonai Gaea
[40:14] helped them amen and know we'll go to I
[40:18] don't have this on the overhead but we
[40:21] go to Matthew 26 and we're gonna read
[40:25] from verse 67 and then when God appears
[40:31] to be silent he is working hallelujah
[40:35] and so Matthew 26 and we'll read from
[40:38] verse 69 down to verse 75 there's a very
[40:41] familiar piece of Scripture Peter Peter
[40:45] following Jesus when Jesus is on trial
[40:48] and Peter comes to this great trial
[40:51] hallelujah God knows how to shave us
[40:54] down God knows how to prove
[40:56] God knows how to mold us a man Jesus
[40:59] wasn't talking a whole bunch but he was
[41:01] working God was working amen now Peter
[41:05] set without the palace and a damsel came
[41:07] unto him saying thou also was with Jesus
[41:11] of Galilee but he denied before them all
[41:13] saying I know not what they'll say and
[41:15] when he was gone into the porch and
[41:17] other maid saw him and said unto him
[41:19] that were there this fellow was also
[41:23] with Jesus of Nazareth and again he
[41:26] denied with an oath saying I know not
[41:28] the man and after a while came unto Him
[41:31] as they stood by and said to Peter
[41:32] surely thou also art one of them for thy
[41:36] speech betray a thief
[41:38] amen Nina then began he to curse and to
[41:41] swear saying I know not the man and
[41:44] immediately the crowed and Peter
[41:46] remembered the words of Jesus which said
[41:49] unto him before the crow thou shalt
[41:51] deny me thrice and he went out and wept
[41:54] bitterly Amen may the Lord bless his
[41:56] word this morning you may have your
[41:57] seats that seems like very different
[42:01] kind of Scripture but I want to just I
[42:03] want to just show you when God appears
[42:06] silent he is working and it's always in
[42:10] the silent times really when God is
[42:13] actually wanting to prove or to reveal
[42:15] what's really in people we read here in
[42:18] 1st Kings where David had become old he
[42:20] had been he was established in his
[42:23] kingdom he was on the throne he had
[42:25] taken the taken the fullness of of the
[42:28] promised land and but he had come to a
[42:30] point in the movement where where now he
[42:33] was old and now people begin to worry
[42:35] you know what is going to happen to our
[42:37] King and we see here it was not David
[42:40] you know it was not David that said I
[42:43] need someone to warn me it wasn't David
[42:46] that said I need some external help of
[42:48] man to keep me alive
[42:50] it was the people around him were
[42:52] worried that that their King had lost
[42:55] was losing strength that he was going to
[42:57] die they were begin to get worried that
[42:59] the word that had established the
[43:02] kingdom was losing its strength because
[43:04] it was getting old I mean this message
[43:07] is still is alive today
[43:09] as it was when it was first ministered I
[43:12] mean the Gospels the Bible we read is
[43:15] not as as strong as as strong today as
[43:18] we know as when God inspired man to put
[43:21] it on paper it has not lost strength it
[43:24] has not lost any of its ability to
[43:26] redeem to transform amen to deliver to
[43:30] heal a mentor set people free to give
[43:33] you - to give spiritual sight amen it
[43:37] still has the same power that it was
[43:40] written in and the intent that it was
[43:42] delivered to man that power is still
[43:45] here and has not gotten old out God does
[43:48] not get old he does not lose his
[43:50] strength he doesn't lose his heat he
[43:52] does not lose his ability amen he still
[43:55] as powerful and as strong as the day
[43:58] when he first said let there be Sun Moon
[44:00] and stars amen and we're so thankful
[44:03] this morning that he has released a path
[44:05] through his word Amen that God has sent
[44:08] his transforming power upon the earth
[44:09] hollowly to change people from from
[44:12] living in darkness into light I mean
[44:15] from transforming them from sinners into
[44:17] Saints hallelujah from taking a people
[44:20] that were that were united with Satan in
[44:22] the world having a breaking that Union
[44:24] and he knighted me with himself I mean
[44:27] that they become the bride of Jesus
[44:28] Christ I mean that power is still here
[44:31] we don't need to have prop it up we
[44:33] don't need to find something to give it
[44:34] hate I mean we don't need to make it
[44:36] palatable every to the world it's still
[44:39] powerful it still has the ability to do
[44:42] what he promised he will do hallelujah
[44:45] but these men got worried how King is
[44:48] not giving he's got an old we've been
[44:51] walking with him for a while and he's
[44:53] aging but they did not understand that
[44:56] now had come a transition period in
[44:57] Israel where once it was a period of war
[45:01] and conquest but now had come a time
[45:04] where it was going to go from a time of
[45:06] conquest and war to a time of peace I
[45:08] mean where the temple would be built
[45:10] where stones and different different
[45:13] materials from from outside of Israel
[45:16] hallelujah we are here the Bible says we
[45:19] are living stones we are living stones
[45:22] hello
[45:23] lively stones Peters's and the stones
[45:26] they quarried and the wood and much of
[45:28] the materials from the temple didn't
[45:30] come from Israel they came from Gentile
[45:32] places hallelujah and God has found you
[45:35] you may have been in some some hole
[45:38] someplace doesn't matter where you came
[45:40] from but God when he was when he saw his
[45:43] bride before the foundation of the world
[45:45] he saw you he saw you maybe you're a
[45:48] little finger or you're a you're a bird
[45:51] or a spleen or whatever part of the body
[45:52] you were God isn't worried what part of
[45:55] the body you are he knows you're the
[45:56] pilot body he made you to live a certain
[45:59] function of the body
[46:00] hallelujah can be an eyebrow whatever
[46:03] more as long as you're part of the body
[46:05] hallelujah I mean so God knew where
[46:08] you'd be and you've been healed out of
[46:10] some pit hallelujah just like they had
[46:14] to go they think warriors they're too
[46:16] part of a Gentile world to to cut out
[46:19] the stones shake them bring them back to
[46:22] Israel hallelujah the same thing God has
[46:25] done for us I mean we were not even part
[46:28] of the Commonwealth of God far away
[46:30] someplace but God knew you had to be
[46:32] part of the building I mean so he said
[46:34] he said laborers they mean to go shoo
[46:37] you out hallelujah he said stonemasons
[46:40] to hew you out
[46:41] I mean this this message is the master
[46:43] stonemason I mean God knows how to shape
[46:46] his building
[46:47] God knows how to prepare human heart
[46:50] hallelujah and then now we've been
[46:52] gathered this was the season that that
[46:55] that Israel was coming into it and we
[46:58] know we're already part of that season
[47:00] but certain things had to be changed in
[47:03] the kingdom and people spirits had to be
[47:07] driven out that had no place in the
[47:10] kingdom for in the temple was coming
[47:12] together there was a change in
[47:14] dispensation was occurring so it wasn't
[47:18] now as I see it David David wasn't
[47:20] concerned he was cold
[47:22] God's not concerned what kind of state
[47:26] you know do we worship God this is not
[47:28] part of it but I've been pondering this
[47:30] thought for a while do we worship God
[47:31] based on our situation or the blessings
[47:34] or doing worship God
[47:36] of who he is do you worship God because
[47:40] of who he is or or because the blessings
[47:43] he may give you or your situation why do
[47:45] you worship Him I worship Him because of
[47:48] who he is
[47:49] hallelujah not based on your situation
[47:51] while you may going through and and
[47:54] whatever God is dealing with you and I
[47:56] wouldn't I wouldn't worship Him based on
[47:57] that I'd won't worship Him because of
[48:00] who he is
[48:01] hallelujah and so now they brought
[48:05] Abhishek they found Abhishek and now
[48:09] Abhishek the name it actually is from it
[48:12] means the father of era that is a
[48:14] blundering this is this is this person's
[48:18] name so we're going to the father Veera
[48:20] birth - this is an error this is a human
[48:23] ability that that found her - to keep
[48:28] the King warm now man tries to prop up
[48:31] the word but God is really wanting to
[48:34] see what is in the people
[48:35] it wasn't the king as I've seen a few
[48:38] times now it wasn't the king saying I'm
[48:40] cold on he someone to warm me this is
[48:42] man trying to prop up the move of God
[48:44] and you say well why didn't the king say
[48:47] anything the king the King appeared to
[48:51] be silent but God was dealing because
[48:54] the prophesy already come that thy son
[48:56] Solomon will build the temple he was
[48:59] going to be the next king the pattern of
[49:01] the temple actually came to David David
[49:05] begin to click all the materials the
[49:07] gold and different things he began to
[49:09] click materials for the temple he wasn't
[49:12] when God when we when David said to
[49:15] Nathan it's not right I live in a palace
[49:17] basely and God dwells in tents and the
[49:19] Prophet Isis Nathan said do all that's
[49:21] in thine heart and then Nathan goes
[49:24] awake God deals them go back and tell my
[49:26] servant David you know I took you from
[49:28] being a shepherd now I've given you a
[49:30] great name in all the earth but you're a
[49:32] man of war you're a man of blood so you
[49:34] shall not build a temple but your son
[49:36] will build the temple he didn't get he
[49:38] didn't get angry and and and discouraged
[49:41] at God because he couldn't fulfill it
[49:43] the inspiration was there to fulfill but
[49:45] it wasn't this place Amen a true person
[49:48] of God will rejoice the inspiration
[49:50] maybe there but if they know they're not
[49:51] the person for the job they will still
[49:54] rejoice in it
[49:55] hallelujah so he was still rejoicing he
[49:58] was still happy even though he knew in
[50:00] his in his flesh he would not see the
[50:02] temple built because he would had to die
[50:04] before it happened but he was still
[50:05] rejoicing that it was going to happen
[50:08] but now there are there are certain ones
[50:14] that are sitting in the kingdom and the
[50:17] and the conditions have to be right than
[50:21] them now to raise up now this is from
[50:25] brother Johnny DeMuth from our first can
[50:27] be made this statement when human
[50:29] leadership has taken out of the way the
[50:31] hearts of all men are made manifest and
[50:34] I can say that with with women and I
[50:36] could say it this way about God when it
[50:38] appears God is not in control the hearts
[50:42] of all men are made manifest God is
[50:44] always in control when he appears to be
[50:47] silent he is working david was silent on
[50:50] this matter but God allowed it God was
[50:53] working because we read there that after
[50:58] after Abhishek had been found and she
[51:01] was now being used to warm the king
[51:03] let's said then at an idea I'll put it
[51:06] back up let's see then at a night of the
[51:09] son of hagath exalted himself so here's
[51:12] one sitting in the kingdom and and it's
[51:14] got to be dealt with now we're going to
[51:16] come to Peter because it's easy to say
[51:18] well that's that person that that person
[51:20] but Peter needed a shaving down there
[51:23] are parts of Peter that had to be done
[51:24] away with for him to become the
[51:26] spokesman of of the day of Pentecost
[51:28] right so we're going to bring this down
[51:31] to a personal level and so now a
[51:32] teenager was there and he was the he was
[51:35] the brother of of Epsilon and we know
[51:38] what Epsilon did he he won the hearts of
[51:41] Israel and there was a coup and and
[51:43] David had to flee the kingdom and you
[51:45] know those things happen but but when
[51:47] epsilon began to proclaim himself king I
[51:49] mean no before that he he himself
[51:53] actually prepared chariots and horsemen
[51:55] about fifty men going before him and so
[51:57] you see with with with with with family
[52:01] on a natural level if one part the
[52:03] family does
[52:03] something the other part of the family
[52:05] will do it but then an annoyed you
[52:07] didn't wait to try and win the hearts of
[52:08] the people he said no we're just going
[52:10] to proclaim myself King and I'm going to
[52:11] get people of influence around me and
[52:13] then I'm going to take the kingdom this
[52:14] way but there were people that gather -
[52:17] they were ones that gathered - to add an
[52:20] idea that had been worth David the whole
[52:23] time and but these ones they had to be
[52:29] dealt with they had to be dealt with now
[52:35] we read here the ones that gathered to
[52:39] him there was it was Joab and there was
[52:44] a birth of the priests these were men of
[52:47] influence you go read the Bible they
[52:50] were men of influence
[52:51] Joab was was they basically David's
[52:53] right-hand man he's a powerful man in
[52:56] Israel but here was a man who shed the
[52:59] blood he killed innocent men in a time
[53:03] of peace they meant he killed he settled
[53:07] old scores in a time of peace he because
[53:11] he tricked Abner who killed Joe Abe's
[53:14] brother he tricked Abner to come out of
[53:16] a city of refuge and he killed him
[53:18] outside the gate this is the kind of
[53:20] character Joab was this couldn't be this
[53:23] couldn't be in the kingdom at a time of
[53:24] peace this had to be done away with
[53:26] hey all following me these things had to
[53:29] be dealt with and and he also killed
[53:32] another man see he had blood on his
[53:34] hands and this could not continue on as
[53:36] Israel was turning a corner from a time
[53:39] of war and conquest to a time of peace
[53:41] now abathur you see it's a you know it's
[53:45] amazing when people they they are built
[53:49] a certain way and they'll gravitate
[53:51] towards certain things based on how
[53:54] they're made and God allows it to be
[53:57] that way
[53:57] because God is wanting to prove what's
[53:59] in the hearts of all men and women are
[54:02] you following me they meant and so now
[54:06] Joe a job gravitated towards Aaron idea
[54:11] abbath of the priests gravitated towards
[54:14] um towards
[54:15] Aaron idea now
[54:17] epithet a priest he is from Eli's house
[54:21] you'll know the prophecy of Eli's house
[54:24] where Eli was told prophesied to him
[54:28] that his two sons were going to die that
[54:31] his house would be cut off from the
[54:32] priesthood there would come a time where
[54:34] where they could not be proceeding be
[54:36] cut off forever if you go read the
[54:38] prophecy and so he was the last priest
[54:41] from Eli's line and so God God knew
[54:46] prophecies it everything is working to
[54:47] God God is working everything we think
[54:51] sometimes what is going on in this place
[54:53] what is going on in my life and God
[54:56] knows exactly how to tell you God knows
[54:59] how to allow influences in your life to
[55:01] deal with you God knows how to stir up
[55:04] the nest
[55:05] hallelujah even who may be just a little
[55:07] thing here and losing it God knows how
[55:09] to deal with us hallelujah because he
[55:12] has our best interest in mind I mean he
[55:15] has a he has when he thought of me
[55:17] before the foundation of the world he
[55:19] saw the character you would end up in he
[55:21] saw how you'd conduct yourself he saw
[55:24] you made it as image I mean he saw you
[55:27] made in his image and so he now knows
[55:30] because he knows the end from the
[55:31] beginning he knows exactly how I'm going
[55:33] to get them there hallelujah brother
[55:36] Bram said God doesn't just squish this
[55:38] forces through a pipe and just make us
[55:40] overcome and we get spat out the other
[55:42] side er you know overcoming Christian
[55:45] God knows how to use the everyday kind
[55:47] of life and influences of man hallelujah
[55:50] this world this world is actually still
[55:53] in God's control safety he say well
[55:56] Satan's on a rampage God is allowing it
[55:59] amen
[56:00] nothing is out of cater everything is
[56:02] going exactly how it's meant to be we
[56:05] don't need to worry I mean we don't need
[56:08] to worry
[56:08] abut the world just get a blood cell
[56:11] apart we don't need to worry
[56:12] amen we don't need to be concerned about
[56:14] it when you see Jesus said when you see
[56:17] the end come lift up your heads before
[56:19] you know your redemption draws nigh
[56:21] that's what he said lift up your heads
[56:23] hallelujah we should be I've been the
[56:26] happiest people in all the world
[56:27] sure
[56:28] we should be burdened for the loss that
[56:30] I'm done and and the merely religious
[56:32] out there but we should be so happy all
[56:35] old he said when you see these things
[56:38] you've opened my eyes that the prophecy
[56:41] you can see it material in front of you
[56:42] understand and you've caused me to see
[56:45] it you've caused me to understand where
[56:47] I am hallelujah and you gave me
[56:49] instruction when you see these things
[56:51] lift up your heads before you know your
[56:53] Redemption draweth nigh
[56:54] I mean our attention to what the change
[56:56] in this body hallelujah hallelujah so
[57:01] now Eli I'm so at an idea
[57:05] edan idea was part of Eli's house he had
[57:10] to be taken out of the way it's easier
[57:12] not to embers of the priest said the
[57:14] king this is now David this is David
[57:17] committing all judgment to Solomon as
[57:19] the father has committed all judgment to
[57:21] the son yeah and on to empathy the
[57:25] priest said the King get thee to an
[57:27] earth off unto thine own fields thou I
[57:30] say this is actually him speaking
[57:33] directly to him forgive me for thou art
[57:35] worthy of death but I will not at this
[57:37] time put me to death because thou
[57:39] bearest the Ark of the Lord God before
[57:40] David my father Solomon speaking to him
[57:42] and because thou has been afflicted and
[57:44] all were and my father was afflicted so
[57:47] Solomon thrust out abathur from being a
[57:49] priest unto the Lord that he might
[57:51] fulfill the word of the Lord which he
[57:52] spake concerning the house of Eli and
[57:55] Shiloh God knew God knew this had to
[58:00] happen man God knew whatever that would
[58:03] do and a time where it seems God is
[58:06] silent it's always such a such a
[58:09] troublesome time when a kingship has
[58:12] changed because the king has absolute
[58:14] authority in his realm when he speaks it
[58:17] has to happen I mean it's not a
[58:19] democracy
[58:20] when he speaks that is the law and
[58:22] that's done there's always such a such a
[58:25] troublesome time when a kingship has
[58:27] handed over but now but now they came as
[58:29] a type you know as I said David wasn't
[58:31] saying anything that he wasn't receiving
[58:34] heat and the people got worried how can
[58:36] we keep this going
[58:38] it's a God knew by creating what it
[58:41] appeared to be a
[58:41] vacuum what it appeared to be a vacuum
[58:45] God allowed it to show what is in the
[58:48] people yeah
[58:49] what does in the people now
[58:58] let's go to let's go to Peter for a
[59:00] second Peter we understand no there was
[59:07] no one really like Peter and you know in
[59:09] the in the disciples he was always the
[59:12] one to answer the questions he was the
[59:15] one who walked out upon the water it was
[59:17] him
[59:17] no now stepped out he did and he was he
[59:20] was the one who said if it be you Lord
[59:22] walking on the water let me walk out too
[59:24] you know and I said that even here he
[59:27] was built you know all the apostles were
[59:29] built different ways just like we're all
[59:31] built different ways all different kind
[59:32] of personalities different ages God
[59:36] knoweth God as a God of variety amen and
[59:39] he wants his people to work together in
[59:40] harmony and so here was Peter Peter was
[59:43] the one when Jesus said who do men say
[59:45] that I am he said you're a Jeremiah
[59:47] Elias or one of the prophets
[59:49] and then so but then Jesus said who do
[59:51] you say that I am it was Peter who said
[59:53] thou art the Christ
[59:54] maybe he's always the one in class to
[59:56] put his hand up first me meet me you
[59:59] know and so he was the one who answered
[1:00:01] it and then he said you're blessed art
[1:00:03] thou simon simon barjona for flesh and
[1:00:05] blood has not revealed this to thee but
[1:00:07] my father which is in heaven that must
[1:00:10] have made him feel real good or God's
[1:00:12] revealing things to me hallelujah I
[1:00:14] received revelation I'm not just caught
[1:00:17] up with the crowd has become personal
[1:00:18] it's become personal to me now there was
[1:00:22] a genuine revelation from God but the
[1:00:25] problem is there still Peters humanity
[1:00:27] was still operating as humanity was
[1:00:30] still living and he had to God had to
[1:00:32] get rid of it he didn't change Peters
[1:00:35] personality Peter was still the same man
[1:00:37] who walked on the water was the same man
[1:00:39] who who preached on the day of Pentecost
[1:00:41] he has built a certain way he didn't
[1:00:43] changing from being blusterous this
[1:00:45] rugged old fisherman to bingham you know
[1:00:47] a little scholarly guy he's still the
[1:00:49] same but God had to take his humanity
[1:00:52] and get rid of it that God could fully
[1:00:55] express himself through because a
[1:00:56] different season had come now now the
[1:00:59] living stones are coming amen John the
[1:01:04] Baptist gathered people to introduce him
[1:01:06] to their bridegroom he was the one who
[1:01:09] introduced the people to Jesus
[1:01:11] that was his ministry Alleluia sir
[1:01:14] living stones were being gathered by a
[1:01:16] voice crying in the wilderness amen and
[1:01:19] in the and then the head of the corner
[1:01:21] came to his temple and he began to
[1:01:23] gather stones even again you know when
[1:01:25] he came out of the wilderness but after
[1:01:27] being tempted by Satan he began to call
[1:01:29] Peter James a girl John he was gathering
[1:01:31] stones hallelujah he is gathering stones
[1:01:35] to the building but they had to be
[1:01:37] molded and shaped and Peter had to be
[1:01:40] molded and shaped he was the one who
[1:01:42] Jesus saw the vision of someone having a
[1:01:45] sword you know trying to defend him in
[1:01:47] the garden
[1:01:48] how many sauce do we have they said to
[1:01:50] Jesus's there'll be enough Peter packs a
[1:01:53] sword because he's not gonna let
[1:01:54] anything happened to his Lord I'll die
[1:01:56] with you he says you know this has got
[1:01:59] to be taken God's got a God's got a mold
[1:02:02] God's got a shape he's gonna he can't
[1:02:05] fit into the building that way a man he
[1:02:07] can't fit into the building that way
[1:02:09] even though he's a living you know he's
[1:02:10] a stone that's the predestinated to be
[1:02:12] in the building he can't fit that way
[1:02:14] God's got to shave him off hallelujah
[1:02:17] praise God for the shaving time hey man
[1:02:20] so now here he comes with a sword and
[1:02:22] and here comes Judas Jesus said when he
[1:02:27] was preaching he had five thousand
[1:02:29] people in a meeting he preaches about
[1:02:32] you know certain things you must eat my
[1:02:35] flesh and drink my blood unless you have
[1:02:37] no power you have no life you have no
[1:02:39] part of me and he ends up with twelve
[1:02:42] everyone forsook him and then and then
[1:02:45] Peter says to him Lord you know Jesus
[1:02:48] turns to his disciples after he's had
[1:02:50] five thousand and and their ball lifts
[1:02:52] he's only got a small group and and and
[1:02:54] Jesus looks I'm saying will you go also
[1:02:56] and Peter's will the one who said to
[1:02:58] whom shall we go we know that thou has
[1:03:01] the words of eternal life he made me
[1:03:03] thought himself that sounded pretty good
[1:03:06] he's got this character it's got to be
[1:03:08] dealt with but then Jesus said don't you
[1:03:12] know that you know what have you had the
[1:03:15] devil and there's only 12 people Jesus
[1:03:20] knew who Judas was but the opposite of
[1:03:25] the
[1:03:25] right scenario had to be presented for
[1:03:27] what was in Judas to come out amen
[1:03:32] what was then Judas had to come out what
[1:03:34] was in Peter had to come out and so now
[1:03:38] Jesus at what it appears it used to be
[1:03:40] not long before the thousands of people
[1:03:42] flocked to his meetings great healings
[1:03:45] were done supernatural was done he spoke
[1:03:48] words that no one else had spoken before
[1:03:50] thousands flocked to him but then there
[1:03:53] came a time where not many were
[1:03:55] following him anymore and no doubt maybe
[1:03:58] Judas because Judas never really
[1:04:00] believed that this was the prince of
[1:04:01] life he didn't really believe this was
[1:04:04] the Messiah it had not become personal
[1:04:06] to him and so that's why and then and he
[1:04:09] got offended at Jesus you know about how
[1:04:13] the woman came with the with the great
[1:04:14] amount of spices your alabaster box and
[1:04:18] anointed him for us for his burial and
[1:04:21] and and he was offended at it because he
[1:04:23] because he said this this woman has done
[1:04:26] great waste we could have sold us and
[1:04:28] gave the money to the poor but in the
[1:04:30] Gospel of John that that profit
[1:04:32] anointing could look beyond his words
[1:04:35] and as he as but he as a thief I mean it
[1:04:38] could go beyond what man would say oh
[1:04:40] that sounds like a good thing he wants
[1:04:42] to distribute to the poor but actually
[1:04:43] deep down in his heart he was a thief
[1:04:46] amen and so now and so he got offended
[1:04:49] of Jesus leave her alone she does a good
[1:04:51] work and he's thinking they didn't do
[1:04:53] good but she didn't do a good work she's
[1:04:55] just a waster he got offended at the
[1:04:58] Christian the Messiah correcting Judas
[1:05:01] he couldn't take the correction they
[1:05:02] thought no how can i betray him I don't
[1:05:06] know how his thought process came to
[1:05:07] that conclusion but it came to that
[1:05:08] conclusion and so now the opportunity
[1:05:12] was arisen as we know he went to the
[1:05:14] chief priests and scribes and he said
[1:05:16] now I know how you can get him and
[1:05:18] secret where there's not a whole bunch
[1:05:20] of people around and then we come to the
[1:05:24] Garden of Gethsemane
[1:05:25] and here's Peter the mighty fisherman
[1:05:28] Peter with a sword
[1:05:29] Rita defenders Lord because he even said
[1:05:32] he had a revelation thou art the Christ
[1:05:34] but at the same time he said when Jesus
[1:05:36] begin to say I have to go and you
[1:05:38] I'm gonna be placed into the hands of
[1:05:40] wicked men and be crucified Jesus said I
[1:05:43] mean Peter said to him you will not do
[1:05:44] this you will not die and here's a man
[1:05:47] who has a revelation this is the Christ
[1:05:49] manifested in the flesh and then he's
[1:05:52] actually now trying to withstand the
[1:05:53] very program of God because of his
[1:05:56] humanity amen and so now here's the
[1:06:00] Spanish says no you will not die and
[1:06:02] then actually Jesus says get behind me
[1:06:04] Satan because he actually sees the
[1:06:06] inspiration coming through that man get
[1:06:09] behind me Satan
[1:06:10] amen this must be done I'm just
[1:06:12] paraphrasing and Ed limping a little bit
[1:06:14] and then so now he's Peter in the garden
[1:06:16] I'm gonna defend my Lord I'm all gung ho
[1:06:19] pulls a sword he's a fisherman tries to
[1:06:22] tries to take the word tries to tries to
[1:06:26] defend defend the word
[1:06:28] I mean defend the resurrected one with
[1:06:30] the word and all he does is cut off
[1:06:33] someone's ear so they can't hear anymore
[1:06:36] this is him in a zeal but because the
[1:06:39] stone had to be shaved I mean they had
[1:06:42] to be shaping of the stone because this
[1:06:44] was Peter and his building and him
[1:06:46] trying to trying to defend the Lord
[1:06:48] Jesus all he did was cut one man's ear
[1:06:50] off
[1:06:51] he wasn't even aiming for his ear he's
[1:06:52] praying for his head but he was a
[1:06:54] fisherman he wasn't a swordsman amen and
[1:06:57] many people in their zeal they'll take
[1:06:58] the word and I'll try and defend it and
[1:07:00] they'll just cut someone's ear off that
[1:07:02] they can't hear but then the mass needs
[1:07:04] to come and touch their ear and heal it
[1:07:05] again
[1:07:06] that they can hear I mean we're going to
[1:07:09] be careful how we willed this weapon
[1:07:11] we're going to be real careful how we
[1:07:13] wield this thing about we're standing
[1:07:15] for truth and your master swordsman amen
[1:07:18] this does not mean to be a friendly fire
[1:07:20] kind of thing we don't wrestle against
[1:07:22] flesh and blood we don't wrestle against
[1:07:24] one another I mean we don't wrestle
[1:07:26] against flesh and blood this is not a
[1:07:28] flesh and blood affair there's a there's
[1:07:30] a warfare against demon power in high
[1:07:32] places I mean where our enemy is not one
[1:07:36] another our enemy is the devil hey man
[1:07:39] and so we don't want to we don't want to
[1:07:41] have a lot of collateral damage around
[1:07:42] the place what's the point of you know
[1:07:45] there's I don't know what it's called
[1:07:46] but they're such a when it comes to
[1:07:49] victories in warfare
[1:07:50] where the one who actually wins
[1:07:52] the battle ultimately will lose the war
[1:07:54] because they lost too many casualties we
[1:07:58] don't want to be like that we don't want
[1:08:01] to be like that we want to you know we
[1:08:03] want to get complete victory no
[1:08:05] casualties on our side all of the enemy
[1:08:08] so they meant to here's Peter now he's
[1:08:10] defending you know he's defending trying
[1:08:13] to defend the Lord he just cuts off one
[1:08:15] man's ear but then he's got to come to
[1:08:17] this point because it's amazing when you
[1:08:19] think about it Jesus told them before
[1:08:22] the crows three times I mean before
[1:08:25] the crows you'll deny me three
[1:08:27] times and he looked into the eyes of the
[1:08:29] word and he basically said in his heart
[1:08:32] I will not
[1:08:33] he's the man who knows what's going to
[1:08:35] happen he's already seen it in vision
[1:08:37] he's already seen it in vision and he
[1:08:40] Stanley saying basically no you're wrong
[1:08:43] you're wrong the word you are wrong God
[1:08:47] has to shave it off and so he comes down
[1:08:51] east and and he's following he's
[1:08:53] following the Lord there and now here
[1:08:56] come here come woman and say aren't you
[1:08:58] one of them God knows how to actually
[1:09:00] humiliate us do you know that God knows
[1:09:03] what our ash heap is like job God wants
[1:09:06] us on the a she sometimes we have to be
[1:09:09] there job is sitting on an ash heap it
[1:09:11] appears God is not speaking but God is
[1:09:13] working I mean God knows had a mold and
[1:09:16] shape our character hallelujah it's
[1:09:18] through suffering our character is
[1:09:20] moulded it's through trials it's not the
[1:09:23] rejoicing times hallelujah amen is
[1:09:26] through it's through suffering and trial
[1:09:27] that our character is molded but he
[1:09:30] wants to mold our character he wants us
[1:09:32] to be in his image hallelujah
[1:09:35] it's like in Hebrews chapter 1 it says
[1:09:37] that Jesus was the Express image of his
[1:09:39] person and that in the Greek expressed
[1:09:41] image is like an engraving tool
[1:09:43] someone's taken at all had shaped an
[1:09:46] image amen this is an engraving tool
[1:09:49] he'll take his tool in and he'll and he
[1:09:52] will mold you engrave it upon your heart
[1:09:55] amen it's not some fluffy pillow nice
[1:09:58] time I think I'm going to engrave this
[1:10:01] I'm going to carve it into you
[1:10:03] hallelujah I'm gonna carve you into my
[1:10:06] image hallelujah I'm glad he does it
[1:10:10] don't you I'm glad we don't just have
[1:10:12] the character of the world I'm glad we
[1:10:14] have christ-like character because it's
[1:10:16] him doing it it's not a learned behavior
[1:10:18] I mean it's not a learned behavior God
[1:10:21] changes our nature God changes our
[1:10:24] thinking I mean God changes our outlook
[1:10:26] on life hallelujah
[1:10:28] and so Paul Peter needed a shaving down
[1:10:31] any and he any lifts it says after the
[1:10:35] crew he remember what Jesus said
[1:10:37] his pride just took a took a knock and
[1:10:39] he wept bitterly because he said before
[1:10:42] that I'll not deny you then the pressure
[1:10:44] comes down and he denies and he swears
[1:10:46] and he gives an oath I do not know this
[1:10:48] man and now he's honors a sheep now now
[1:10:53] he's ready now he's ready to be shaped
[1:10:56] you may have heard the story many times
[1:10:58] we could hear it one more time because
[1:11:01] we can't just talk about Etta Niger and
[1:11:03] and and abathur and Joab and say well
[1:11:05] they weren't part of the next move of
[1:11:07] God therefore they had to get away with
[1:11:09] no spirits had to be taken out of the
[1:11:11] kingdom spreads had to be taken out of
[1:11:13] the kingdom and the same thing with
[1:11:14] Peter Peter could not be the one of
[1:11:17] their Pentecost to preach the first
[1:11:18] Church sermon amen
[1:11:20] if he was in that condition and so now
[1:11:23] he came unto his heir sheep he wasn't
[1:11:24] rejoicing he was weeping bitterly he was
[1:11:28] weeping bitterly and now he's in the
[1:11:30] right spot for God to mold him and God
[1:11:33] to shape him and then and then the Lord
[1:11:35] Racer X as he said he would and he's
[1:11:39] there on any and he tells them come to
[1:11:44] Galilee and then they're fishing because
[1:11:46] they just go back to what they always
[1:11:48] did
[1:11:48] and then they see Jesus now on the on
[1:11:52] the shore and then John John says to
[1:11:57] Peter it's the Lord and he jumps into
[1:11:59] the water swims towards him he doesn't
[1:12:02] know if he's forgiven he doesn't know if
[1:12:05] he's been forgiven of that Judas
[1:12:07] wouldn't hang himself
[1:12:09] Judas we don't hang himself
[1:12:11] Peter doesn't know where he is he's
[1:12:13] being molded sometimes God lets us
[1:12:17] God is silent but God is molding it
[1:12:20] appears when God appears to be silent
[1:12:22] his word is continuing on as it always
[1:12:24] has but if we try and put our own human
[1:12:28] ability into what trying to fill what we
[1:12:31] think is a void it will fail and an I
[1:12:34] just saw a void in the kingdom and it
[1:12:36] failed
[1:12:37] Joab saw a bullied in the kingdom and it
[1:12:39] failed
[1:12:40] abathur saw a void in the kingdom what
[1:12:42] he thought and it failed amen because
[1:12:45] they did not continue in the line of
[1:12:47] God's Word amen and so if we humanly put
[1:12:51] out put it we're going to put our hands
[1:12:53] to it and try and steady the shippers of
[1:12:56] where in our humanity it will fail and
[1:12:58] God wants us to trust him
[1:13:00] even when he appears to be silent
[1:13:02] because God's love for us is not like
[1:13:04] parental care where us as parents want
[1:13:07] to protect our children from all the bad
[1:13:09] that is not him his love his love is he
[1:13:13] licked of love I mean he said Jacob have
[1:13:16] I loved Esau have I hated
[1:13:18] he loved before they were born he loved
[1:13:20] Jacob and he hated Esau I mean you say
[1:13:25] that's not fair
[1:13:26] I say praise God I'm a Jacob hallelujah
[1:13:29] praise God I'm a Jacob before I was even
[1:13:32] upon the earth or even a thought maybe
[1:13:34] in my parents mind God thought of me and
[1:13:37] God chose me and God loved me was an
[1:13:40] elective love and he may commit you to
[1:13:42] suffering like he did job or he may
[1:13:44] commit you to hardship like Paul law or
[1:13:47] any of the Saints down through the ages
[1:13:48] he may commit you to suffering like that
[1:13:51] but that doesn't mean God does not love
[1:13:53] you hallelujah
[1:13:54] may because God if he has chosen you
[1:13:56] before the foundation of the world like
[1:13:58] a scripture has said God does not change
[1:14:00] his mind
[1:14:01] I mean God does not say one day yes and
[1:14:04] one day no based on where you may think
[1:14:06] he may be hallelujah
[1:14:09] Amen time you know we judge things so
[1:14:11] much my time
[1:14:12] I mean people that's like the Christian
[1:14:14] walk is like Google real-time analytics
[1:14:18] things change and we're and we're just
[1:14:21] watching a graph move up and down and we
[1:14:23] think well we're doing good we're doing
[1:14:24] bad whatever more and I'm I'm you know I
[1:14:27] can take a rapture now and then the next
[1:14:28] moment how am I ever going to get there
[1:14:30] and we're up and down and God just looks
[1:14:33] through just just looks at us Amen God
[1:14:37] knows how to deal with us he has an end
[1:14:39] result in mind he's and he's determined
[1:14:43] he is that he is determined more than
[1:14:46] any person can ever be determined
[1:14:48] because he said this is going to happen
[1:14:50] and nothing's going to stop it happening
[1:14:53] amen and Peter you know Jesus knew
[1:14:56] because because after the Passover was
[1:14:58] fifty days till peanut cost I think it's
[1:15:01] about that 50 days Pentecost is 50 so
[1:15:04] now God knows I have to get Peter and
[1:15:07] shape because no one else was going to
[1:15:09] be the spokesman there on the day of
[1:15:12] Pentecost I've got to get this one in
[1:15:14] shape and I've got this amount of time
[1:15:16] Alleluia
[1:15:17] he knew half how he is going to get him
[1:15:19] his shape real quickly amen he knew how
[1:15:22] to get him in shape because he had at a
[1:15:24] predestinated moment he was going to be
[1:15:26] in an upper room and God was going to
[1:15:28] fulfill the promise of the Prophet Joel
[1:15:30] I'll pour my spirit out upon all flesh
[1:15:32] and he knew exactly the 120 that would
[1:15:35] be there and he knew the one that would
[1:15:37] preach to all those ones who are mocking
[1:15:39] them they meant he knew who was going to
[1:15:41] do it and he knew I have to get the
[1:15:43] stone in the building in the right place
[1:15:46] for that to happen
[1:15:48] Alleluia that's the same with us friends
[1:15:53] you have to just keep it in mind if God
[1:15:56] has chosen you that doesn't mean we just
[1:15:59] sit back and watch the world go by
[1:16:01] amen but God as we misunderstand God's
[1:16:05] dealing with us so much I think we must
[1:16:08] understand when we're going through a
[1:16:09] trial we have an or between someone and
[1:16:12] things are going on God is willing to
[1:16:14] prove what's in you just like job and
[1:16:17] abathur and and at an idea or even Peter
[1:16:20] or Judas he's wanting to prove what is
[1:16:23] in you what is in you it's very easy I
[1:16:27] mean to say you love someone when
[1:16:29] they're good to you but how much more
[1:16:32] now when they're bad to you and divine
[1:16:34] love is not human love human love is
[1:16:37] based on condition divine love is not
[1:16:39] based on condition amen and so it's very
[1:16:43] easy oh yes we have
[1:16:44] divine love I mean one between the other
[1:16:47] well that may be all be fine when we're
[1:16:49] having a honeymoon kind of time but wait
[1:16:51] till the everyday kind of life and
[1:16:54] there's children running around and
[1:16:55] hardship comes and uncertainty arises
[1:16:58] you know now there's got to be a proof
[1:17:00] of the love you still love me now amen
[1:17:05] they used to love me now well I don't
[1:17:07] know anymore
[1:17:08] well it can't be divine love their
[1:17:10] divine love doesn't change God can't
[1:17:13] love us any more than he already does
[1:17:15] well he would he what do you mean the
[1:17:17] fullness of his love was expressed that
[1:17:19] down Calvary what God became a man to
[1:17:22] redeem himself I mean to redeem us back
[1:17:24] to God there was a fool for God so loved
[1:17:27] the world
[1:17:28] that's expression of his love that he
[1:17:30] gave his only begotten son that whoever
[1:17:31] should believe on him should not perish
[1:17:33] but have everlasting life
[1:17:35] we all know that Scripture do we know
[1:17:36] that was excellent that was God
[1:17:38] expressing his love and God sending this
[1:17:41] message in the end time that's God's
[1:17:42] love being expressed because he doesn't
[1:17:45] want you to go into a tribulation he
[1:17:47] wants you to go into a rapture why did
[1:17:49] God send Malachi for upon the earth as
[1:17:52] that a people would become rapture ready
[1:17:55] hallelujah amen so we we misunderstand
[1:18:00] God's dealings but just because God is
[1:18:03] silent it does not mean that he's not
[1:18:08] working see if I can find this
[1:18:19] Paul had another Paul had the same kind
[1:18:22] of experience he had a very powerful
[1:18:25] ministry he affected a lot of people as
[1:18:28] we know but they came a point where some
[1:18:31] of the people who had seen God
[1:18:32] manifested powerfully through Paul's
[1:18:34] life they thought he became to be a bit
[1:18:36] washed up and one of them was Dimas he
[1:18:40] sees in second Timothy demas has has
[1:18:42] forsaken me preferring you know the
[1:18:45] other pleasures of this world or
[1:18:46] something like that but brother Behrman
[1:18:48] in present stage of my ministry he sees
[1:18:52] this
[1:18:53] now I mentioned Dimas didn't forsake him
[1:18:56] and start off to nightclubs I don't
[1:18:58] imagine Dimas did that because Dimas was
[1:19:00] a spiritual man he was a great helper if
[1:19:02] he ever took the history of Dimas he was
[1:19:05] a he was a notable preacher a fine
[1:19:07] cultured man highly policy Decatur he
[1:19:09] was a smart man but why would he forsake
[1:19:11] pool that's the thing what made him do
[1:19:14] it forsake Paul I don't believe you
[1:19:15] wanted to go to a nightclub or anything
[1:19:16] but I believe it was God separating Paul
[1:19:19] but I imagine Dimas let's take some of
[1:19:21] Dimas as thoughts as I was sitting down
[1:19:23] on the hillside wondering the other day
[1:19:24] about daylight I was thinking why would
[1:19:26] Dimas want to leave that fellow why
[1:19:28] would he leave that poor little preacher
[1:19:30] and lead him to the that lead him to the
[1:19:31] Lord the man who spearheaded the revival
[1:19:34] among the Gentiles a prophet indeed no
[1:19:36] one could say but he was a prophet he
[1:19:38] was more than a prophet he was an
[1:19:39] apostle and a great and mighty apostle
[1:19:42] to the Gentiles and Dimas would have
[1:19:44] associated with Paul had fellowship and
[1:19:46] seen the Spirit of God move upon that
[1:19:47] man and why would he turn his back on
[1:19:50] such a person as that had been
[1:19:52] vindicated that he was a servant of
[1:19:54] Christ but do you notice Paul loving
[1:19:56] this a Paul said about Dimas loving this
[1:19:58] present world
[1:19:59] I don't think Dimas back slid I don't
[1:20:03] think he did that but I think he got the
[1:20:04] wrong opinion of Paul now Adiemus came
[1:20:09] out of a rich family he was wealthy and
[1:20:11] money sometimes means religion to people
[1:20:14] like they say in California if you
[1:20:16] haven't got three Cadillacs you're not
[1:20:18] spiritual so it means if you're not
[1:20:20] successful if you don't have the finest
[1:20:22] church here in the city the people won't
[1:20:24] go it's almost that way here proves to
[1:20:27] you you've got to have the finest church
[1:20:28] in the country or they say well you mean
[1:20:30] you joined up with their little bunch
[1:20:32] like that did
[1:20:33] did you know our Lord didn't have a
[1:20:35] place to lay his head did you know he
[1:20:37] only owned one coat see and he had it he
[1:20:40] isn't just the kind of a person was
[1:20:42] pushed about and he didn't have no place
[1:20:44] to lay his head but he couldn't but they
[1:20:47] couldn't have thought the same thing and
[1:20:49] did about him and now I believe Dimas
[1:20:52] saw a failing seemingly in Paul's
[1:20:54] ministry I think that he thought that
[1:20:56] the old fellow was washed up before God
[1:20:58] now he thought that our people that that
[1:21:02] would pluck out their eyes you know to
[1:21:05] give it to Paul because Paul had the
[1:21:06] thorn in the flesh we see our own lives
[1:21:09] lead us to you because he gives riding
[1:21:11] it by himself because he couldn't see
[1:21:12] very well see here was Dimas now because
[1:21:15] DeMuth because God was singing now what
[1:21:16] does some demon what does in Dimas oh
[1:21:19] looks like Paul's washed up what is he
[1:21:22] gonna do when human leadership has taken
[1:21:25] now Paul wasn't taking other way as
[1:21:27] removed off the scene but when human
[1:21:29] leadership is taking the other way the
[1:21:31] hearts of all men are made manifest so
[1:21:34] when it looks like the leadership is out
[1:21:36] of the way or when it appears to be
[1:21:38] silent like in David's day the hearts of
[1:21:40] all men are made manifest and it's the
[1:21:43] same thing today we know appears that
[1:21:48] God is silent when it appears that he is
[1:21:51] not in control God is doing it now I'm
[1:21:55] going to close with this because I want
[1:21:56] you to ponder these things God is doing
[1:22:00] it for a purpose because he's wanting to
[1:22:03] see are you here only for the good times
[1:22:05] and the shouting and the rejoicing and
[1:22:06] the screaming or are you here we can
[1:22:10] week out I'm talking about your walk
[1:22:12] with God is it just because of his
[1:22:14] blessings well because you've seen more
[1:22:17] of the scripture than maybe a lot of
[1:22:18] other people like Peter thou art the
[1:22:21] Christ is some living God blessed art
[1:22:23] thou simon barjona flesh and blood has
[1:22:25] not revealed to this to thee but my
[1:22:26] father which is in heaven and upon this
[1:22:28] rock the spiritual revelation of who
[1:22:30] Jesus Christ is
[1:22:31] I'll build my church why are you still
[1:22:35] walk what does guys want to see what's
[1:22:37] in you you say well we're the salt of
[1:22:39] the earth well God's going to prove your
[1:22:41] saltiness God's going to prove your
[1:22:44] saltiness
[1:22:45] are you just salty to people that that
[1:22:48] that are believers or you salty to the
[1:22:50] world a salty to those ones who annoy
[1:22:54] you in the world around the church God's
[1:22:59] wanting to prove the salt and listen
[1:23:01] about divine love do you love anyone
[1:23:03] I mean irrespective of how they may
[1:23:05] treat you God's going to prove it
[1:23:09] just like job job was proved well not a
[1:23:14] story of joke joke joke loved the Lord
[1:23:17] but then it was now proven Satan's him
[1:23:21] well he only loves you because
[1:23:22] everything goes fine and then God say no
[1:23:25] that's not why he serves me and now then
[1:23:29] Satan of course he doesn't believe God
[1:23:31] says well prove it basically and then so
[1:23:34] the edge of protection was taken away
[1:23:36] Satan came up to the very borderline of
[1:23:38] that he was allowed to go you know Satan
[1:23:40] can't just he's he is bound by God's
[1:23:43] Word
[1:23:44] Satan is bound by God's Word and so now
[1:23:47] he comes into the very borderline the
[1:23:49] first time he just takes everything he
[1:23:50] can he doesn't know it's his body and
[1:23:52] then now he comes up before God yo the
[1:23:55] second time and God says see job still
[1:23:57] loves me John job still serves me and
[1:23:59] then so now but the in Satan says it's
[1:24:01] because his own health hasn't gone I
[1:24:04] mean got a litte sickness strike you
[1:24:07] heal allowed to happen to see what is
[1:24:10] your faith built on as it built on
[1:24:12] because everything's going well or is it
[1:24:15] built on the fact that he is God and
[1:24:17] you're his child irrespective of
[1:24:20] condition what is your faith built upon
[1:24:22] and Jared even in all those trials and
[1:24:26] his friends coming before him and
[1:24:28] telling him he's a secret sinner and God
[1:24:30] is too big to be interested in the lives
[1:24:32] of man all these things all those things
[1:24:34] he still stood amen
[1:24:37] now what about you because if you're
[1:24:41] still where Peter was God knows had a
[1:24:43] credit situation but I'm an apostle
[1:24:47] Gardner's had a credit situation but I'm
[1:24:50] the bride God knows how to create a
[1:24:52] situation but I'm going at a rapture God
[1:24:54] knows had a credit situation but
[1:24:56] everything God knows how to cry
[1:24:58] situation to see what's in you because
[1:25:02] we have to count father's gold
[1:25:04] God is not having a having a people
[1:25:07] that's a bunch of fools gold and gold
[1:25:08] and rock and stuff all molded into one
[1:25:10] pure gold and gold represents deity in
[1:25:14] the scripture feedin gold was put on the
[1:25:17] ark in some places I mean so that deity
[1:25:21] would be beaten to cover the wood and
[1:25:24] the Aqua just humanity Alleluia and
[1:25:27] Jesus was was beaten gold he was mad
[1:25:30] above any man I mean that their deity
[1:25:34] could cover humanity that when you see
[1:25:37] the ark you don't see the wood you don't
[1:25:38] see the humanity you see the deity
[1:25:41] Alleluia and we have to come forth as
[1:25:44] gold as well amen let's have some
[1:25:47] musicians please if you want to come I
[1:25:49] want you to ponder these things are you
[1:25:53] gonna put your head to it in your
[1:25:54] humanity keep things going or he just
[1:25:58] gonna allow God be God I mean I would
[1:26:03] allow God to be God because he knows
[1:26:05] what he's doing
[1:26:06] I mean really what it boils down to is
[1:26:10] when we lose confidence and we have to
[1:26:12] put our hand to it it takes because
[1:26:16] we've lost confidence in God I'd keep my
[1:26:19] confidence of Oz you if he's brought you
[1:26:24] thus far
[1:26:25] why did he bring you this far you see
[1:26:28] the devil still what you know you go
[1:26:29] read I think I've seen it a few Sundays
[1:26:31] ago see we're go read through the Bible
[1:26:33] and see where all the believers failed
[1:26:35] and the devil will come against you in
[1:26:38] the same way in the same way everywhere
[1:26:41] he came in he came against I became
[1:26:42] against every believer he'll come
[1:26:44] against you the same way you know you
[1:26:47] gotta study your enemy you can't just
[1:26:50] think we're on some nice flowery meadow
[1:26:52] and everything's all happy and pink
[1:26:54] clouds and you know we have an enemy and
[1:26:58] the enemy studies how you use the word
[1:27:02] he studies you because he wants to dis
[1:27:05] army from your weapon see you got to
[1:27:08] study him amen
[1:27:11] I mean let's
[1:27:18] I don't know let's just stand shall we
[1:27:21] I mean How Great Thou art do you have
[1:27:23] that oh praise the Lord yep yeah how

[1:27:38] hey man he's the everlasting father
[1:27:40] Prince of Peace the mighty God he's our
[1:27:42] lamb he's our advocate
[1:27:44] he's our high priest he's a comforter
[1:27:46] he's a intercessor he's a mediator
