wonderful songs to it to warm us up with one thing that I've been thinking about this week and you know when you're driving and you're thinking and you may have meditated upon the word of the Lord and and this week I thought about just singing when we sing a song do we actually sing the words or do we just listen to the melody and and echo the words as we go cuz I remember when I was still back in the world and what happened is you used to have songs playing and you would say man this is an awesome song and somebody would say have you ever heard the words and you're like yeah I'm pretty sure they'd tell you the words you gonna hats not that it's not the same song it's definitely not the same song and you go back and you play it and you actually listen to any go whoa okay I never knew they sang there and since I've become a Christian the words in the song is more important to me than just the melody so I really wanted to know what I'm singing about because that is where it is that's that's where I'm thankful and I want to sing the songs you know and mean it so tonight when we sing the songs I encourage you to to look at the words read the words and just take it in and really mean

him you can never be the same I think once you cut to them how can you how can you remain the same hallelujah slit some amen god bless you all let's just go to the book of Matthew we're gonna read chapter 11 just a just a couple of verses here Matthew if you're living then we're going to read from Luke the 18th chapter so Matthew 11 and we're going to read verses 16 and 17 and Jesus speaking says but we're on to shall I liken this generation it is like unto children sitting in the markets and calling unto their fellows and saying we have piped unto you and you have not danced we have mourned unto you and you have not lamented then let's go to Luke 18 you may think that's a bit unusual but um anyway Luke 18 and we're gonna read verse verse 35 down and it came to pass that as he came nigh unto Jericho a certain blind man set by the wayside begging and hearing the multitude passed by he asked what it meant and they told him that Jesus of Nazareth passes by and he cried saying Jesus thou son of David have mercy on me and they which went before rebuked him that he shouldn't hold his peace but he cried so much the more thou son of David have mercy on me and Jesus stood and commanded him to be brought unto Him and when he was come near he asked him saying what wilt thou that I shall do unto thee and he said Lord that I may receive my sight and jesus said unto him receive thy sight thy faith has saved thee and immediately he received his sight and followed him glorifying God and all the people when they saw it gave praise unto God amen may the Lord blesses word you may have your seats tonight just want to have a have a a very short just a simple thought on attitude we were in here in Matthew 11 where Jesus after you know in the in the previous part of the scripture it's amazing where where he he would speak yo the disciples of John the Baptist came to him asking yo are you him will surely look for another and then and then Jesus said you know just just watch the meeting a little but the lame walk the lepers are cleansed the Deaf hear the dead are raised you know the cost the other pours preach the gospel and then he begin to speak about John the Baptist how he was the you know how he rose his forerunner and all that they need any then he just in Tajiks here that you know what is this generation like what can i liken these people to and he said it's like you know children in the marketplace where where you know one one group is singing and the others calling to their fellows and they have you know and and so we have piped unto you but you have not done so so he's saying that the generation is not responding and the way that that they've been that God has spoken to them so he's saying it's like chill do normally when people play music what happens people dance you know and normally when people are sad if people respond and kindly said with them but he's saying this generation is actually the opposite they're not not interested in dancing then I understood in responding to the Lord and their you know so they're not even in tune with what God is doing and you know I kind of got a thought from I was serving jelly on Monday night and you know and and you try and scoop the jelly out of the bowl and it kind of does this you try and get in the bowl of conscious slides and slips around and you know a lot of people like that when it comes to God you know they will sit on this seat and they'll end up on like this and their feet up in the air and they all slimy and you know going like this and you know they're you know they think when's this gonna end and I wish there's a clock on the wall so I could turn and look at it and agonize in my heart about how long this is taking and it's like jelly rolling around on a hot a table you know it's like a bunch of slime rolling down a stick you know that's the most ridiculous thing where you can think that you're in the presence of the eternal I am a man that redeemed you that saved you that healed you that is here that is here not to beat you down not to make you belittle not to not to be cruel not to be mean but to lift you up to loose you from the chains of the devil y'all just check you're free to wash you to make you a new creature but yet we are out like this and we're like oh man we're just gonna end it yo this is horrible you know what kind of attitude is that alright you know I think have you ever tried to put jelly in a bowl don't be jelly attitude now I've got it your attention I hope I'll do a lot more of that I don't care I've already made myself look silly before you know anyway attitude definition of attitude it's a settled way of thinking or a feeling about something since when you got your mind made up about something that's your attitude towards it like for example when I was young my attitude towards broccoli was it's horrible that was my attitude it was my settled way of thinking about broccoli I cannot stand this broccoli I don't like it I don't want it does my attitude because it was settled that way my mind had to be changed that broccoli wasn't so bad after all you following me Amen you know you know it's like when you're young you think you have all the time in the world and you get bored when's this gonna happen wins it's gonna happen yes if my attitude was this way towards time but now my attitude has changed was time I need more of it I've got a value my time I'm going to use it you know because I don't have a lot of time my attitude change now it's incredible you think about here Jesus is on his way to Calvary I just want to go to the gates of Jericho he's blind Bartimaeus and he's sitting there begging blind and brother Brown tells a story that has has his parents or his mother would tell him how you know Jericho Joshua came through here Rahab put the scarlet yo cord out the window and yo they were safe when the walls fell down flat and yo you know Elijah came along here and great heroes the Bible lived in here and you know he would think if only that God was present I finally the God of Elijah was here then he had healed my blindness of only Joshua's here I wouldn't stay blind and so he was sitting there here's Jesus he's walking through Jericho where is he going he's not on a circuit to her he's not coming back in that form he is never gonna walk in that form through Jericho again never never never he's on his way to the cross so this is the last time his sacred feet are walking through that gate never again will he do it in that way now you think about that here is blind bartimaeus this is his opportunity to get ahold of the son of David this is why sure chance you don't read about people like blind Bartimaeus the woman with the blood issue Zacchaeus you don't read about them in the scripture because they were like this wondering when it's going to end you know I'm sick about this you know you don't read about them in the scripture because they had that attitude their attitude was he asked because he's blind he can't see what's going on what's all this noise someone tell me either said this sounds different I'm not used to this kind of noise at the gate I know what it's like but this is different he says who's this causing this ruckus and they just see it as Jesus of Nazareth passing by what has he done well I heard he he raised a big girl he healed these people he come to see and and and rice I mean I mean blind Bartimaeus the cogs and is he returning that sounds like things my parents told me that sounds like a God I heard about what was his attitude his attitude was you know it wasn't man I hope this goes away so I can get some peace no he knew this was his one opportunity this was as one shot and he was determined I'm going to make the most of my one shot I'm not going to let it pass me by I'm not going to say well I don't feel happy I don't feel good you know Wednesday Sunday two hardest days of the week why is that because we're here why is that because we're here to worship God why is that because God wants to come down and meet with us I mean and probably in a map maybe the greater the way then he would you're just yourself and so the devil fights you and then your mind battles and things happen and people look at you finding you take it wrong and you know and you're all twisted yo is it only me why cuz the dibbles trying to get us to miss our blessing give us the wrong attitude and say well it's always a battle well of course it's a battle someone's fighting you and it's not your family it's not your brother and sister it's not even your own self it's the devil's fighting you trying to rob you of a blessing you think about who's who's hood you know like in the discernment lines God comes down brother brems he's saying I'm just like you I'm just your brother I'm waiting for him to come and people who even critics knew when the angel Lord came down such a presence came into the building he didn't need to say he's here if I knew he was there and he would start calling people out telling them what's wrong than what they're even wearing he sees are they're missing it they're missing it God acts who was speaking to them directly and they're missing their visitation why maybe their attitude wasn't right maybe the other devil was trying to rob them of their blessing we face a real enemy well we have a real God father we have a Chern Living God I mean but you know we should have the attitude every time we open this Lord I want to get my blessing every time I talk to your Lord I want to get my blessing every time I sing this song I want to get my blessing holy every time I come to church I want to get my blessing that should be our attitude hallelujah they shouldn't be you see what we can get out of our nose and eat it and eat our fingernails and pick out what ears and stuff you know he with me blind Bartimaeus had one head had that one choice one one one time amen he took it by the horns he got what he needed because his attitude was right he didn't let the devil rob him the devil's not going to come to you and say yet you're a believer you're gonna make it yeah absolutely that's for you go for it no he sits on your shoulder saying what about this and this is going to happen tomorrow and this person's like this oh you know this is happening and what about this and this is going on and you need new clothes you didn't use shoes and you want to go on holiday and then it at all these million things way he's trying to get your attention that you will miss your blessing and this is boring wise Church boring because the devil thinks it's boring and he's trying to he's trying to give you his feeling about it hallelujah is the words not true and there's nothing to this I'm sorry there's everything to this I mean is everything to this word hallelujah it's true amen we've got a record we could have a testimony meeting right now and everyone come up and say was it true what happened to you this is what happened I was there I know it happened to me hallelujah so blind Bartimaeus had the right attitude and he got what he needed a meant and we want to be exactly the same way a man doesn't matter what age we are we want to get exactly where saying Lord you're here for me hallelujah you want to meet my needs I can't meet my needs you meet my needs get a hold of him Amen that's what we need to do so question are you jelly in a bowl or something that's just you know you could just put on the plate what attitude do we have the right mental attitude brother Brown says causes every divine promise to come to pass the right mental attitude towards the word will cause it come to pass a menace not can it be done yes it can be done he's already declared it will be done he purchased our salvation on the cross then it will be done amen hallelujah amen so you know we want to have a settled way of thinking as the meaning of attitude that the Lord the word is true amen he purchased our salvation the word is for me he's my Redeemer he's my healer he's my Savior he's my guide he's my comfort he's my peace amen he's going to take me in a rapture don't one of us children we should have that attitude father I'm here to meet with you hallelujah that's how we should be blind bartimaeus had the one chore option and he got what he needed he cried all the louder when he heard who it was how about you and I I mean how about you the woman with the blood issue she's in the scripture because she is determined if I could just touch the hem of His garment I'll be made whole she had 12 years of trouble till she got to him but the main thing that she got to Herman hallelujah that's that's what mattered she got to him she pushed through the crowd she pushed her every problem and she got to him hallelujah Anne was healed she had the right attitude the scribes and Pharisees had the wrong attitude it's amazing in the scripture there's an account where where Jesus and His disciples are walking through the wheat fields on the Sabbath day and as disciples pick up the corn they begin to eat it and the Pharisees are there criticizing why you're why you're your disciples eating on the Sabbath day my question is why weren't why were they in church they should have been in the synagogue on the Sabbath day but they're spending their energy walking around following the Son of Man to criticize them hallelujah and then Jesus go sis goes into the synagogue and there's a man with a withered hand that they can't help but he can help if is it lawful to heal on the Sabbath day and he says don't just stretch forth thine hand sometimes it can be such an easy thing but God's looking for your response how Louie he wants you to respond to his word amen and he stretched forth his hand it becomes as whole as the other one and it just made the Pharisees and things angry because their attitude was wrong we want to have a right kind of attitude par lujah you want to see more victory in Europe life to have the right attitude hallelujah that's what we want to do we want to have the right attitude it will change everything Amen but what causes what causes us to have the wrong attitude pride looking at our own self our own problems what we're going through being self-centered that causes us to have the wrong attitude well how do you change it how do you have the right attitude don't look at yourself don't have your eyes focused on you and your problems or what's going on your life we all have problems amen and and so I'm not putting down any problems we face real problems but they did a day that observed lying vanities this is in the book of Job forsake their own mercies so if your if your observe and he was in a whales belly he will he had some real problems he couldn't step out of the whale he couldn't get out he was trapped in this whales belly he says it's just lying Vanity's and if I observe the whale belly I'm going to forsake my own mercy so we don't want to be observable dit lying Balinese but I bet you very much if he pushed he says he's I feel wells belly he would have felt the stomach acid sloshing around all you know he would have felt it I'm in a whale's belly it's pitch-black surrounded in seaweed he was having a bad day but he has no it's just lying Vanity's i'm not going to observe them I'm not going to bring them to get a sitter ation I'm just going to consider amen the word of the Lord because if I consider that then I I will receive mercy but if I observe what's going on around me I forsake my own mercies who wants their own who wants mercy amen so one thing don't look at the lying vanities their temporal they shall pass they shall be done away with I mean so don't be focused on those things be focused on the word of the Lord amen you know as as brother M says yo what good can worry do a man will walk well what's the point of believing well faith can deliver me worry can't help me you gotta have the right attitude towards it the problem is we live in an instant age so we want an instant answer but God doesn't always give instant answers he answers in his time and his taught his program his timeline is very very different from ours I mean but we've got to be lined up with what he wants hallelujah hey I mean you say well I want an instant fix we don't always get an instant fix because God's building character God knows what he what we have need of amen but we're going to have the right right attitude about the Word of God I mean so don't be jelly amen don't miss your blessing even in a very simple service because many times if we if we fail to see the value of coming to church if we fail to see the value of the Word of God we will miss our blessing we will miss what God wants to give us if we say what's the point in coming yeah because what does the devil tell you don't go tonight it's cold or it's hot or it's whatever you're hungry you're not hungry you're full you got this you others just stay home he's trying to get you to miss the blessing he's trial was the point he just waved his arms around and he gets his words mixed up and you know they sing this way what's the point you know and and if you start agreeing with them I'll guarantee you one thing you'll miss your blessing oh you've been there before he's probably said the same things before you know you'll miss what God has for you if you don't see the value it's like you know we need to we need to cultivate spiritual appetites amen we need to cultivate spiritual episodes it's like a food you try something new sometimes the first bite isn't the greatest it's an acquired taste some things amen some things I refuse to acquire but you know some things are quiet dace like you take cheese that should be basically a bio you know you're a biological warfare agent people love it because they acquire the taste right why because they've been eating it over a period of time and they get they get used to it and they begin to like it the first time I had a cup of coffee it was horrible but now I've acquired a taste for it and I'll be honest quite often I need coffee just to function cuz I wake up and you know sleepers where's that where's where's mr. Sandman knees foot more sander Myers to keep me asleep you know but so you need it too you know so you see the value and what you're drinking you know and people get people get uh you know accustomed or they get used to certain food because they develop a spirit appetite for it you have to cultivate an appetite for the word of God if you want camp to be a if you want camp to be the greatest meetings of your life cultivate a spiritual Ziya now don't get right don't get right at camp get right now I mean start purpose in your heart have the right attitude yes Lord you're here where you said you'd never leave me nor forsake me I don't just need a big camp meeting to be rejoicing and shouting and jumping I mean but Lord you can minister a single scripture to me and I can shout and rejoice wherever I am I mean come but you got to have a spirit you have to cultivate a spiritual appetite develop it yo spend more time it pays off how do people win at the Olympics they train they put energy in because they know they can win the gold most of an athlete is motivation those who believe they'll lose lose those that believe they can win win you have to have faith in brother Isaac's here to that Wednesday he said yo you have to believe in yourself this is just the world they say yep their faith in yourself that you can do it I mean but if you don't believe you can do it you won't do it amen so you got to have faith in yourself I'm an overcomer why am I an overcomer he made me an overcomer I'm sinless why am i sinless he made me sit loose I am perfect why I perfect us he made me perfect I have to believe it about myself I have to believe that he died for me hallelujah I have to believe he has sanctified me I have to believe it if you don't believe it you won't be you have to believe you have the victory even if you do not see any evidence of it you must believe it I am more than a conquerer why cuz he made me more than a conqueror but I have to believe it that is for me I am blind by Timaeus he believed that that Jesus Christ could heal him he said thou son of David here's exactly right hallelujah and he got what he needed because he believed that he had faith that he could receive it amen so what about you cultivate spiritual desire you say well I didn't even know how to pray I still don't really know how to pray but just talk to him you don't have to grow have a great big eloquent speech of great flowery words you know brother Brown tells a story there was a guy walking down the street and he any-any walked past a a you know a house and outside the house there was a boy and he was on his knees like this he sang a b c d with all his haughty sincere I mean he got the end he said Amen he got up and the end the man's watching mrs. sunny why are you what are you doing that's praying you're praying you were praying you're saying the alphabet no I just don't know how to pray so I thought well the Lord understands my heart so if I just say the leaders he'll put it together how how I feel you say well that's ridiculous it's not ridiculous because many times we can't even get it out how we really feel and how we want to express ourselves we can't put our problems and things really how we really want to put it but God understands your heart your attitude is not just what it's not what you say it's your actions it's your heart how are you at you it's shown your attitude is shown by what you do amen he said I don't know how to pray brother Brown wrote a letter put it on a tree dear sir I know what he wrote so it's not about don't you know God knows what you mean because someone you know Jesus said don't be like the scribes and Pharisees standing in the marketplace saying great big prayers man would say all that man really knows what he's talking about God says no he know nothing he sounds good but he's got nothing to it so don't be you know took from your heart cultivate cultivate a spiritual appetite in prayer and in the word and you'll find that camp will just be a Jubilee you just have you just be dancing around the place the whole time hallelujah hallelujah you'll be dancing from the dining hall into the church around the church back to the dining hall hallelujah oh you can't do that really you sure oh yeah and you know people say you can stop dancing now he said no I can't stop hallelujah I'm having a revival glory hallelujah my rub off on those people who say it can't be done but why but why would people in be that kind of atmosphere have that kind of attitude because they've cultivated a spiritual desire before they go and that's what we need to do start you you put in you'll get out I mean you you reap what you sow holy so if you reaping like jelly you'll get back that amen and your ways reap more than you so amen a farmer plant seed do they just get one seed back know they get multiple I mean so put it put in the time say Lord I want to meet with you are you with me I'm giving you tools to overcome this is all free amen now honestly honestly you want to have a great camp what's everybody who must have a glorious time hallelujah who wants to meet the Lord again and again and again and again and he changes you and burdens are lifted and then pain is gone and conflicts with the God and and you walk in the camp it's like you walk into a place something happens you walk out holy it's like the third pole the people went into the room and the tent and then they you know yeah and then they came out and people said what happened they say I don't know I just went to his presence the Lord was in there came out something happened and then and then and then we go to camp you come out of camp hallelujah what happened to you and he tried to express what it's like to meet the pillar of fire but the Earth's just it takes more you're gonna meet him yourself to really understand this happened and this happened and this happened hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah we should have that kind of expectation we're not just to go through a motion hallelujah Amen so I'm just gonna leave it right there honestly cultivate this former relationship it's not about I read five chapters a day no cultivate a relationship read it think about it ponder it talk about it digest it hallelujah spend time and you'll find yourself the things that once bothered you they don't bother you and when they come back again you just put them under your feet you'll find yourself overcoming as you feed on the word hallelujah holy that's a great amen it's a great thing I mean so let's um let's head the musicians I don't want to spend too much time so let's have the musicians hallelujah come please I mean you love the Lord tonight hallelujah hallelujah puttin amen that's worth it as brother and II see you spend all your energy amen amen let some good do we do we know that song of Beulah land I'm longing for you I think I might need help brother Isaac actually I will need help what am i doing maybe let's then shall we I mean I'm kind of homesick for that country to which I've never been before who's homesick who wants to go home hallelujah won't it be wonderful just to see
