strength we just lay at your cross lord this morning and we come lord jesus father to your throne of grace lord boldly with confidence lord not in our self but in the finished work of calvary father

lord be impacted and when the devil comes may we cast them out in the name of jesus christ or for he has no plausibility no efficacy at all he's just a liar and a bluff and we call his bluff this morning show your hand satan because there's nothing there we have the upper hand we've got the hand we've got the straight whatever they call those things it's all just win we're the winners and we're on the winning team and in fact the team has already won we're just walking and rejoicing in our victory all the way to eternity but we must learn lord jesus discernment lord and we need something to discern and so father may you equip us this morning we yield ourselves to you we depend on you we lean on your everlasting arms not our own understanding lord but yours your wisdom we just surrender totally completely letting everything just go in our own strength and letting you be god be god today lord be god and our children be god and our teenagers be god and our mothers and fathers our brothers and sisters in every part lord be god or we worship you this morning in jesus christ's name amen hallelujah who's ready to have church this morning who's ready to give him glory amen i'm ready amen not because i got myself but he made me really amen oh yeah you know he gives life wherever he is there's always life there's resurrection there's power there may be funerals but if he turns up it turns into a rejoicing doesn't it who can who can say amen to that he can turn all things into a rejoicing tears come in the morning but at night but then there's joy in the morning amen he is a restorer and i just want to just encourage you this morning when it comes to giving praise to god we're about to sing songs who likes singing songs you know when we sing now where regardless if you feel up down left or right or centered let's be centered i like being centered but you see wherever you're at it doesn't change how worthy he is it doesn't change you might be down you might be having a hard week a hard month a hard year or a hard hour whatever it may be or rejoicing it doesn't change how worthy he is so i encourage you this morning don't base how you worship today and praise on how you feel because he's worthy so give him you're not a hypocrite if you give him glory and praise and you dance and shout and inside you're not feeling very good it's not hypocrisy that's giving god the glory he deserves regardless of circumstance and i can guarantee you if you do that sincerely now don't put it on you really believe it he will bless you he will turn your situation he will inhabit your praises and what happens when god comes in it changes everything if god comes in amen he went into a funeral back in the gospels and it turned into a as i just said

world can't take it the world can't give it so the world can't take it away [Music] hallelujah amen okay that's a hard act to follow i'm just a tiny testimony while they're sitting in a music stand please so i came down here with a heavy heart because we all go through trials and times in our lives when you know the lord seems further away or you feel like you've moved away or something like that and i had negative thoughts going around around around my head making tracks get deeper and deeper furrows as we do and it had been going on for quite a while and so i thought ah in my my heart wanted to be down here with the saints i really love the fellowship here i feel very welcomed and part of you of course we are part of each other [Music] but in some ways i was looking to the world to fulfill that need that i had i thought oh i'll go for walks in nature then i might get rid of these negative thoughts um i'll go to the zoo and i got to pet a kangaroo and that was awesome and and i thought oh that that'll take it away from me and um walk to the through the bird sanctuary and i'll be out amongst god's creation and that'll take it away from me and i'll walk through town and along the waterfront but all those things whatever the lord had whatever the world had to offer as our sister saying it was so shallow there was nothing it was beautiful god's creation but i couldn't it didn't fulfill me it didn't take away that that it didn't it wasn't the need the need wasn't met it was like a bandage over the top or something but it wasn't until there were two sisters during the the days that i've been down here and there was two separate sisters who didn't know my circumstances they didn't know this thing they'd be going on negative in my head and the lord used them through the body to speak to my heart and help deal with my how to handle those negative thoughts and i just really really thank the lord that he came down through those sisters spoke the words i needed to hear and i believe by his grace that i have the victory so i i just thank the lord it's amazing sorry it doesn't sound it's not 100 perfect it's got all the gold in the car i think oh i want to be in tune with the lord [Music] um yeah up can you do it by the end oh thank you i'm sorry it's the d give me a give me an e yeah [Music] see make it go see that make it go up to like it reaches the top with a red line [Music] a little bit high it's too high yeah thank you my brother gotta stay tuned so many times i've questioned certain circumstances [Music] or things i could not hope i mean understand [Music] many times in trials weakness blurs my vision my frustration gets so out of hand it's then i am reminded i've never been forsaken [Music] i've never had to stand [Applause] [Music] as i look at all the victories the spirit rises up in me through the fire my weakness is made strong [Music] oh he never promised that the cross would not get heavy on the hill would not be hard to climb he never offered victory without fighting but he's had help with always come in time just remember when you're standing in the valley of decision and the adversary says or giving but just hold on [Music] our lord will show up and he will take you through the fire again [Music] so when the load gets heavy and darkness does surround me and the devil whispers you are on your own i turn my eyes to jesus [Music] pour my heart out to him and he whispers he whispers to me you are not alone it's then i am reminded [Music] i've never been forsaken never ever been forsaken amen jesus always turns up right on time as i look at all the past victories and the spirit rises up in me i know that all god's promises his promises have been lost [Music] to me well he never promised that the cross would not get happy all the help would not be hard to climb he never offered victory without fighting but he said help will always come [Music] so remember when you're standing in that valley of decision and the adversary said giving just hold on [Music] our lord will show up and he will take you through the fire once again hey amen of that we can be certain saints we are never alone amen hallelujah oh isn't he wonderful hallelujah he meets every need amen and i believe that all of us have needs this morning and you know let's stand and just make that known to the lord and as we sing these songs

liberty there's hope there's joy lord and we love being in your company lord jesus we love being in a place where you are we love to feel the warmth of your spirit lord the purity the honesty the integrity what all the great characteristics law that a man could aspire to are all from you lord jesus lord and we we feel comfortable being in your presence lord we feel at home being in your presence lord as the song says i'm going home there's nothing holding me here lord there's nothing about the atmosphere of this world lord the the evil negative atmosphere that we enjoy lord or the things that it produces there's nothing about that that we enjoy lord but we enjoy your presence heavenly father lord and that's why he said come just as i am without one plea but that thy blood was shed for me and that thou bids me come to thee o lamb of god i come lord of me thank you that you made a way lord jesus for us to come lord that we could be with you lord not only in eternity but in this life lord we can dwell with you lord and that you kind of glory in the secret place lord say we just thank you for visiting with us here this morning lord we pray you would continue to meet with us lord as we surrender ourselves to you lord and we we endeavor to put our own thoughts and our own desires and everything aside lord to let the spirit of god have the free have liberty amongst us this morning lord we know that's where victory is that's where change is that's where hope is not in things that we can offer lord but in the things that you offer in your word lord and in your ways and your spirit so we just pray you'll continue to bless the service this morning we ask in jesus name amen amen praise the lord um you can take your seats this morning amen thank you musicians praise the lord what a powerful atmosphere here this morning amen amen it's very it's always good to be in the house of the lord as david said i was glad when they said let us go into the house of the lord and i was just praying last night and as i was just thinking about the things of the lord i just said lord i enjoy the atmosphere that you create i enjoy being around you i just enjoy laying down or praying whoever i am and just speaking to the lord and the presence of god comes and it makes you feel good it's never bad it's never it's never darkness it's never negative it's always positive the spirit of god is always positive and the more of the spirit of god we get in our life the more happier we will be that's that's how this works so i'm i'm i'm very happy to um you can bring that off for now i'm very happy to um be be here this morning and i think the law is gonna do great things for us this morning i mean i'm looking forward to to what he has in store i really enjoyed the special sister k um i can probably name on my hands on one hand the powerful times when there's been a song special and it impacts you maybe for the rest of your life you can look back and think well that was powerful and that you just made the top five that was a very that yeah it was very anointed the other one was when sister analyst you did a song remember that song you did and it was about the um it was a christmas one and there was other words in it no it was um yeah hallelujah hallelujah that's very powerful praise the lord it's nice to have these landmarks in our life um okay i i i've got a little thought on my heart this morning that i i would like to share with you and it at the start it may seem like it's going another way but i've got another direction i'm going to head at the end of it but i just want to say before i start that i i really appreciate all of you you people here as the body of christ i do really sincerely appreciate you all and you mean a lot to me and this fellowship means a lot to me and just i know brother impo and i will and whoever comes up here we always do our disclaimers at the start you know before we before we speak because we feel that's the right way to go about it but i think i i just feel in my heart to say this just just to to make it clear and i feel like i can when i moved to wellington i i just finished running a church in gisborne and it was very enjoyable in one sense but when i left i had no desire to ever do it again or to speak again or anything it didn't it wasn't in me to want to do it not saying that i wouldn't but it wasn't in me to want to i had i felt another calling of the lord to to to do so when i came here i didn't have a burden to want to do anything in a if i could say it in a really in a ministerial sense if i could put it that way but when i came here i said to brother ben i want to support you as best as i can and i said talk is cheap we can say something you know this is what i'm going to do but you know time will prove what if what we spoke was we meant it or not you know so i said look don't take my word for it but you'll see over time that i'll be here for you and i'll support you in whichever way that i can and that means if you want me to speak i'll speak although i don't want to if you want me to i will to support you it means anything you want from me i'll do it because i want to support you i want to support the fellowship and and i can say i can that's why i end up up here not because i asked to do it but i get asked to do it and i can't say no because i've said to the lord well i told him i'd support him and if he needs some help i'll get up i'll support him you understand that's why i do it i i like i was sitting in the room back there getting ready for the sermon and i didn't didn't even want to sit in the in the pastor's checks i thought man i just don't want to do that job i don't want to that's very hard you know and i've got a lot of respect for ministers of the gospel you don't understand i've got a lot of respect in my heart for ministers of the gospel it's not easy and anyone that aspires to do it and is eyeing that position up when you get there you'll find it's not like what you thought it was and you there's a good chance you wouldn't you won't enjoy it when you get there you know but but i really respect men of god that stand up and and like pastors and ministers and i really respect them so i'm so happy that brother ben does it and i don't have to do it and i can just be a support is that a right to say that yeah and and i feel i think i feel before the lord that i've that the calling here to just serve brother ben and help out as much as i can i feel like i've done that to the best of my ability it's it's something you think lord i'm i'm you know when the lord gives you a little job and a job description you say yep lord i'll do it you know if you feel good when you can do it for the lord you know and and the spirit of honesty i think i can say this and i won't say it for too long but you know i've done a lot of things in this church a lot of different roles i've had and i've tried to offload every single one of them and you all know i have all the time i'm trying to offload every single job that i've got to someone else it doesn't quite work but i've been trying to do that but the yeah i can say this the only thing that the only position that i've wanted to hold on to has been a a um trustee just because when i was in the other church i was people start doing a lot and the money gets to people and it started i was manipulated through that but money doesn't mean anything to me whether i've got a little or a lot the lord knows in my heart i don't care it doesn't hold me you know it's like it's just a tool for the lord whatever it honestly the lord knows that the day of judgment you know that's the truth it doesn't mean anything to me so i've said brother ben the only position i want to keep is that position not because i want control over it but because i don't want anyone else to control you over it you know so i want you to do whatever you want with it whatever you feel led and i'm here to make sure that you get to do what you want with it you know i don't want i i just couldn't bear the thought of people be like a minister being manipulated by that so so that that's the only the only reason why i've wanted that that because i know the lord knows lord it doesn't mean anything to me or not i'm happy when he brother ben can move forward in the lord he doesn't have to worry about that part of his life but that's enough about that i just wanted to just put that out there just to just to so you know my position of why i end up up here you know but i've got a nice thought on my heart this morning and you can bring up the slide there i had to sit down because my sermons sometimes have scripture verses later on and throughout it also and this is a thought called eternal separation eternal separation and it's a very powerful thought oh yes please bro eternal separation and in a way it's a very negative thought and and the way that the thought came to me as i was listening to a sermon was thank you was it a negative context but i just want to um just bear with me as we go through this because it's a very powerful thought and it's actually a very great thought eternal separation and the scripture that i that the scripture that's loosely based on is this one colossians 2 13 and you being dead in your sins and in the uncircumcision of your flesh has he quickened together with him having forgiven all your trespasses now i've got a bit of a lengthy reading from a quote of brother brandon but i want to read through it all you will know the you will know the quote but i just want to read through this all because it gets to the point at the end of this this message if you can't see that it doesn't matter i'm just going to um can you see that i'm just going to read it anyhow because i want to i want to get this one some time ago in a large canadian city i was holding a meeting and when i come from the the great arena a lovely meeting that night and i was in this great hotel now think about all the things in the story as i'm reading through it i don't know whether you have noticed have anything like it in the states and i was going up on the elevator and noticed whiskey bottles laying in the elevator and also that afternoon there'd been a great bunch of american americans come up there an organization a society a lodge and was having their annual get-together it was about five or six hundred americans there and they were really having a time and when i got off the elevator all down each floor when you would pass you would hear the hollering as it would go past the floor he'd hear the hollering and the foyers and and the and the screaming and the dancing and they thought they were having a good time but that kind of life leads to a place to where man wants to get rid of that type of life they take a pistol and blow their brains out so david couldn't have been speaking about that kind of life now this is david that loving kindness is better than life itself but he's saying he's not talking about that life that they think is good it gets so miserable until people jump off bridges they take poison to end their life so david could not have been speaking of that type of life and when my elevator stopped i heard a noise down along the hall and i looked and here come two american women just with their underneath clothes on and i'm probably 28 26 somewhere along in their years old under 30 perhaps mothers only in a miracle way of thinking it's just a little clean fun it's dirty black sin the bible said she that lives in pleasure is dead while she's alive but oh we think that's innocent fun it's the gates of hell and these young women perhaps their husbands at home playing the babysitter while they're stitching so party was having a little fun drunk as they could be with the underneath clothes on only a bottle of whiskey in their hand and men pulling them from room to room just a little clean american fun what do you think god thinks about that and maybe a man there pulling these woman with his innocent wife at home sitting with the babies brother branham's just come from a meeting a powerful meeting where the spirit of god is and he's been preaching and he turns up at his hotel to this so you can imagine why he eventually spoke out about it because he was in such an anointing just a little fun with the boss and i stepped back in a little place inside inside somewhere and they were coming down staggering beautiful woman and they stopped and passed the bottle one to another and pulled up their little skirt of the thing they had on they're under this skirt they threw it up they threw out their legs in the air and said whoopee this is life i just couldn't stand it any longer i stepped out i said you're mistaken lady that's death she turned and looked at me i walked over to them i had this very bible in my hand i said i'm a preacher of the gospel i and i too am an american and you call that life you deceived the devil has deceived you that's the road to hell and eternal separation from the presence of god so put yourself in his shoes he's just come back from this meeting ministering he's got a powerful anointing and he turns up to his hotel room to the scenario and he's thinking about all the things that it could be and he's just looking at it and he's just thinking about the sin that's going on all around him and eventually he can't take it anymore because maybe he was just gonna hide in the shadows there and let the thing pass but there's such a powerful anointing economy just had to go out and say something and in the end he said that's the road to hell an eternal separation from the presence of god eternal separation from the presence of god now the thought i want to speak on is eternal separation but i'm going to cover it in this way first before i go to another angle now when we talk about death we ask the question what exactly is death death is just a separation from life that's what death is when you die you separate from life it's a separation from life that's that's how you would determine death i got this quote here and god in the garden of eden when you pronounce death upon the human race that day you eat thereof that day you shall die every human being and death means separation and that's the reason we call it death for one another we just separate from one another because if somebody is alive and then you are no longer alive you have separated because death is a separation from life now there are two deaths that exist there are two deaths one death is a separation from natural life when i naturally die and you're naturally still alive then we will separate so i will die and you live so now we separate the second death is that we separate from spiritual life that's the that's the crucial one is the second death when we separate from spiritual life that's that's the important one that we don't want to miss out on that's why revelation says and death and hell were cast into the lake of fire this is the second death this is the second eternal separation from spiritual life it's an eternal separation there's no coming back it's forever in this space that's why i wanted to just cover this real quick that's why there's not an eternal hell when there's an eternal separation from life now god is the only source of life that there is there is no other life outside of god it that is the complete essence of what life is dwells in god so if you're eternally separated from that life then you must have an end at some point you cannot eternally go on forever being separated from life because you you're eternally dead you've got eternal separation that's why there's no eternal hell eventually hell is going to finish not exist anymore because you can't have eternal life and how otherwise god's life would be there keeping it going it's an eternal separation eternal separation now this is where we get deceived and this is how the world gets deceived as we end up in this scenario where we can be connected to a natural life and separated from spiritual life this is where all the trouble starts right here is in this scenario i can be a man or a woman i'm not going to say me because i'm eternally alive but a man or a woman can be alive here and dead over there it's possible if you're dead over there you can't be alive here no you can be alive here and dead over there and this is where all the deceit comes in it's because people can think they're alive like those women that said whoopi this is life brother adam said you're dead you're dead that you are actually dead you think you're alive and i'm having a great time you're actually if you carry on down the road you are no you are presently eternally separated from god presently that's why the scripture says you who who were dead in trespasses and sins while you were sinning you were dead you were dead not you were still alive because you had the ability to sin but while you were in that state you were eternally separated from god you were as good as dead you were dead in trespasses and sins so that's why the scripture here says here it is and you're being dead in your sins because while you are sitting you're you're actually dead has he quickened together with him having forgiven all your trespasses when we are saved it's it's the second death that we get saved from so we can be alive here and alive there that's the situation and that's why this scripture says but she that lives in pleasure is dead well she yet lives she's spiritually he or she it's not to do with a man and woman but those that live in sin are actually dead they're dead that's it the next stop for you is eternal separation from the presence of god which is life that's the way this works there's no other way about it but i love the scripture hear that hath and here let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches he that overcometh shall not be hurt of the second death there's an overcoming for the believer this is not all negative there's an overcoming for the believer where the second death is not going to harm us you know we we and that's what this is all about we're going to overcome the second death because we're all going to face death in this life actually our promise is a rapture but that's just a that's like a body change that's as good as we sort of bypass this whole get old and die and we'll have an accident and die we just sort of bypass that little bit and we go from here to the there you know this body change we don't see death we we take a little shortcut if i could put it that way because death is just you got to go through this journey but there's there's a group of people that will go you know and the moment in a twinkling of an eye we won't taste natural death and we won't taste spiritual there some of us will never taste death whatsoever we're quite a fortunate people no one else could actually say that he not could actually never he never tasted death he just now we talk about eternal separation separation means you're eternally separate from something and in this case death is an eternal separation from life from god and all the pleasant wonderful things that life offers you think about love you've got an eternal separation from any form whatsoever of love human beings have a form of love here because it's part of god right but that will be gone when you're eternally separated from god or joy any any joy that you could possibly experience so these are attributes of the spirit of god so if you take away life you take away all the attributes as well and how there will be no joy when you're returning eternally separated from god there is not one ounce of joy imaginable whatsoever you think when we get in a bit of a depressed state there are still ounces of joy here and there we're not totally void of joy completely it still exists and we could maybe be depressed and see an animal at the zoo and say hi that's quite a nice animal and we get a moment of joy for a small amount of time it still exists but in this place of eternal separation that doesn't exist there is no possibility of this thing ever coming to us or peace no possibility of peace ever existing in that realm any sort of goodness any gentleness any anything up that's a part of the spirit of god will not be there it's an eternal separation an eternal separation forever gone see we people can live and live be dying here but actually experiencing these things well there on earth and that's the deceit about it that's what this whole modern thing about love is you just love everyone love everything makes you feel good but it's wrong see and you're on the road to eternal death but that in itself is another deceit okay now i'm going to segue just a bit here because i want to pull the picture out a bit and talk now about the about a bigger happening that we are actually a part of as we speak as we speak this is what we are a part of and this is to do with the three stages of this earth that we live on and this is an event that is an exciting event for us and it's the three stages of this earth of what we're going through the first stage was when god made the earth and he made it perfect and he put life there this thing called life the thing that we're talking about his own life he breathed in man the breath of life and the man became a living soul and all around man was life when it was just adam and eve before the fall it was all life that's what existed here so that was the first state you see that little word life up there that was the first state now we had a scenario now where death and life were then mixed together in this earth that was now the second stage that that this world had to go through the scripture says while man slept his enemy came and sowed tears among the wheat and he went his way this thing called death was sown into this thing called life so we had a world now that was mixed with death and life that was the situation we found ourselves in stage two stage three was we get this end stage where i saw a new heaven a new earth for the former heaven and the first earth were passed away everything that every part of sin then existed and there were no more season it was a it was a the place again that had no death at all it was it was we have a world waiting for us actually this world that's full of life okay but there's a funny there's a situation in the middle here where there's an eternal separation happening an eternal separation think about this there was once life and death on the earth and if there's going to be a time where there is then only life there's an eternal separation for mankind happening as we speak that's why there's so much trouble in the world where the world is in a process of eternal separation of separating life and death it's separating that's that's what we are involved in right now a thousand years ago it wasn't the situation there was not this eternal separation happening it was because it wasn't the time yet people were going to dwell together and god was going to work his work within what he had to work with but now there's an eternal separation and actual physical eternal separation happening that's why the world is going the way it is that's why it's going crazy because there's becoming a separation it's separating there is a separation happening and one in one context in the bible it calls it a uniting there's a there's a uniting but it's it's evil uniting together and good uniting together he said take the tears and bind them do the harvest bind them put them that way put the put the tears this way put the wheat that way there's a separation and when you have a separation you have differences and everything is starting to become intense because of this eternal separation god is doing an eternal separation upon the earth as we speak good and evil are separating light and darkness life and death are separating worldwide this is an event that nobody else in the history of time will ever experience this event the the event of sin coming in was a great event but i'm not trying to be funny about this but there was not really anyone there to see it apart from only a couple of people you know but it was a it was a the magnitude between the first and the second was massive but there was only a few people to experience it but we are actually at this other point where there's a separation happening between life and death on this world we can even see it with israel going back to their homeland and god beginning to deal with the jews because there's a separation happening he's almost done with us he's pulling away dealing with the jews there's this big separation there'll be a time that's why the word says that him that is righteous be righteous still with him that is holy be holy still him that is filthy be filthy still because then it's like the end of separation now we just have to part our ways but that's the end of the separation that's it whoever's on which side you're on that's it we we're finishing up so we're at this we're at this point now i want to just twist this around a bit and then go to the other side and say what exactly is life then we say i've got life what does it mean when you're alive it means you're separated from death i'm alive how do you know your life well because i'm not dead i'm separated from death and as long as you're separated from death you're technically alive who enjoys being separated from death it's a great thing to be alive christians love to be alive i'm separated from death so now it's not just all negative this eternal separation is not just all negative it is if you're going to eternally separate to death but what if you're going to eternally separate to life then it's a very positive experience for the believer to be eternally separated from life that's why now now you say this what is eternal life to be eternally separated from death eternally separated from death and and to be eternally separated from anything at all that is related to death you think that depression where does depression come from the pit of hell it ain't going to be there in this place of eternal life because there's an eternal separation from depression there's only going to be joy that's all that is in the presence of god is joy there's an eternal separation from that any sort of worry anything like that any strife there's an eternal separation from that it's an eternal separation any hatred if you feel any bitterness there's going to be an eternal separation from that that's what eternal life is and eternal separation from death these two won't be together anymore they're going to be separated eternally never never to bother you anymore that's what this eternal life is and all these here's another one all these things here that that that plague us and that that that are just evil hateful things the lord knows if i had a i guess i can say this sometimes i marvel at the patience of god because i think lord i get so frustrated when i see evil around me and i just experience it if i had a button to push to end it all i'll just push it boom done that would be it i mean god knows i mean that i'm glad for the the long suffering of god that he's got a plan and amongst all this mess he's got a plan and he's getting people out and separating them out that's what he's doing at the moment he's long suffering because that's part of his qualities long suffering now we are on this part of life that are going to eternally separate from death okay now this is the place where we are at right as we speak that's what's happening in a global sense in a worldwide sense is that where we are the beginning the process because we believe we're on god's side we're in the process of eternally separating from death the bride is now now i'm going to take it this way for a bit because i want to bring something in to show you this is only going to be a short message this morning because i want to drive this little point home here this morning and in a global sense you had this you have the world you've got life then you had to mix them with death and then you had it there was a separation coming out and it went back to life again now brother browner preached a sermon called the third exodus and he's saying that the the first exodus was when the children of israel left egypt they made an exodus out the second exodus was when when when man went out of formality into the holy ghost into this this man's doctrine into the holy ghost you know with with in the book of acts when when that scenario happened and he said the third exodus is going from the holy ghost into the millennium moving out and that's the journey that the bride is on is in that third exodus leaving we're in that state there leaving all this death leaving all that nonsense this separation is happening that's that's our journey we are going from life and death to just this place of life this this great separation and eternal separation from all this mess all this depression all this anger all this hatred all this filth we're on this eternal separation to it now i want to type that to a story in the bible that we all know very well and it was and it was israel now abraham was was he was in the land and we're going to type them being in the land as as like his promise you know he was in the land of promise you call it the land of promise i love having a land of promise something we can anchor i hope into that's my land of promise there i'm gonna go there you think about the those that believed in the children of israel they had this thing in their heart the land of promise that land has promised to us well they're in egypt they knew lord i've got this land of promise and it's there and they could anchor their faith into that because the promises that be given to them but here was abraham he was in the land and he was in the land of promise and i'm going to type that to when he was there and his children they had we're going to type that to life they were there they were i know they didn't have the whole land but let's just type it as though they were in the land they had it and then through a different series of events when the famine came and things happened they were driven out of the land because of the famine and they had to go into egypt and end up in a scenario where they were outside of their land and they were mixed in with the egyptians and they were under the egyptians i'm going to call that this part here where you have life and death they were just all mixed together and then the egyptians started oppressing them after a while they were deceived into this too but the egyptians were just oppressing them every day they would they were slaves they would wake up in the morning and they had to be slaves and they although they had faith in their hearts they were mixed in with this with this thing called death called the egyptians they weren't they couldn't just go out and enjoy life they had to work they were slaves they were under this regime they weren't free they weren't free people they were under this slave regime which they hated and they knew in their heart there's a promised land for me back there that's where i belong for 400 years they were here but they had that word of promise that that's my land back there when i go there i'm going to be free that's where god is going to bless us that's where he's going to defeat all our enemies in that land and their whole goal was to get there that's where i want to get to anyone that was of faith that was the goal anyone that was an unbeliever maybe thought how can we work with the egyptians here and maybe i'll befriend a few other the guys and maybe i can make life here a little bit better for myself you're a fool if you do that if you're a jew and you had that mentality you had to walk in faith and um there's another land not this land and i'm going to get out of here and the ones that walked in faith would say lord get me out of here they would be praying you know and a lot of them did pray that's why the lord said i've heard the prayers of my people when he spoke to moses he said i've heard the cries of my people because there were men and women of faith that were crying out to god lord bring me to that land bring me out of this mess into that land right so now one day it happened one day it happened they went from egypt to the promised land they did this exodus this transition from there to the promised land right it happened so then now you can end up in this they separated from the egyptians they're separated for a while they'll mix them but then they then the time came where they were going to be separated and they for a group of them some of them died there and did their thing but a group separated out life and death was separated and they ended up back in the promised land okay that's that's my little that's my type there hell out here walking out very happy look at the looks on their faces how happy would you have been finally the thing you'd wanted for so long you were on your way out you were going you imagine that you've been a slave you've been under these safe masters for so long and then the next month you're walking out you've got all your positions on your back you've been given all the gold of the egyptians too they just gave them all their things and you were going you imagine that you imagine how happy you'd be right and they'd seen the power of god move in their midst they'd seen moses do these mighty miracles and they were just they were having a revival they were feeling real good and then they got to the red sea which geographically they'd actually shown where it was and it was like this you walk through this little crevice then it opens up to a massive big plane area where there's nowhere to go but either into the ocean or back the way you came because it was enclosed them by big mountains and they ended up in the spot and some of them began to murmur and say look moses you've brought us all the way here they've been on this great exodus but you've brought us all the way here just to die out here in the wilderness because they could see the egyptian army coming after them coming through the same place where they went back and they knew they're going to come straight through that little gap there and just come and slaughter us like flies you know we've got no hope and look out that's the most powerful army in the world and a lot of them began to murmur but some of them didn't but most of them did and complain and and be full of unbelief even though they were they were on their exodus they were out they were gone god had delivered them they were on their way to the promised land it was all happening and then moses spoke to them and said to the people fear ye not stand still and see the salvation of the lord which he will show you today for the egyptians whom you have seen today you shall see them again no more forever forever so god gave them a promise and said the egyptians that you see today i'm going to make an eternal separation between you and them you're not going to see them anymore forever there's going to be an eternal separation that you left there but they're still messing with you but there's going to be an eternal separation you see them today they're going to be gone forever they will not trouble you anymore they're going to be gone there's going to be an eternal separation between you and them you will see them no more forever right you'll see them no more forever but i want to ask you this when did the prophecy take effect when moses came and spoke to them and said that prophecy when did suddenly god make up his mind uh okay i didn't know this was going to happen i didn't realize you'd be stuck on this little peninsula and the egyptians were going to come have a meeting with people and say look we've got to figure out a plan here and come up with a night with us with a way to defeat these people okay i'll tell you what this is what we'll do uh we'll drown them in the sea let's quickly rush down and tell moses hey yeah we've seen the situation and and we've decided that yes um this is now what's going to happen um we're going to drown them in the red sea so you go across and then we'll drown them in there he didn't rush out and not know this was going to happen it wasn't at that point it wasn't when moses told the people that they were going to be gone forever that they were going to be gone forever they were going to be gone forever when they left even before they left they were going to be gone forever the prophecy was there it wasn't when they needed it it was it existed there think about it i want you to think about this now it existed there that's when the prophecy existed was when they were leaving okay this is an important now let me just segue for a little bit here right i know this is a voting booth who's voted you go on a vote and and then throughout the day you go to this one that one and you put your vote in and then they at a certain time they start bringing all the votes back to the counting rooms and these these people count them and modern technology is great they're sending all this information through to the these days it's run by the news media they're the ones that call the elections right but they send it back to them and they get these live feeds of of who this one's got a thousand votes this one's got 1 100 and they're watching the scale go up and down throughout the evening now there's a certain point in over the course of the evening that there are computer programs and and people analyze the situation and there's a certain point even when the votes are still being counted that they will say actually you know what even when the votes even though the votes are still being counted there is an impossibility that this one can this person cannot win and this one will win at a certain point in that process they say okay we've we've passed that point now if you look at the averages this many have always gone to this guy that many to that guy if that carries on the way it should and it generally will then this guy's the winner but and they will do what they will call it they will say right we're gonna call it we're going to call this area we're going to call that state we're going to call this we're going to call that now the voting hasn't been finished counting this the voting's still counted but they're going to call it they say all right we're going to call it this guy's won because it's an impossibility that the other one can win and very very rarely does that call is that call wrong because it's based on mathematics and how you can't you can't lose you know you're at that certain point now you understand how that works before the voting finishes well it's okay that guy hasn't officially won but let's just celebrate because he's going to win anyway this is we've won let's just celebrate okay this is an important you know what i'm saying here right now this is what i want to speak about about the scenario that we're in we're in this great exodus right same as these people were that prophecy they were going to win when they left they were going to win they didn't have to wait till the egyptian army was drowning in the red sea to know oh yes we can celebrate miriam got the tambourine out and celebrated they could have celebrated right here we've won we've won the odds are for us there is no way the egyptians are going to win we've won we've won this we won this whole thing it's in the bag people they could miriam should have started dancing when she was there walking out dancing we've won this whole thing oh but look the egyptians are still gonna run up run after you no we've won you don't understand we've won they can you can call and they they should have called an eternal separation right there i'm calling an eternal separation we've won these things that oppress me all of this stuff well i'm on this journey of one they're done i don't care what it looks like they're done we've won this whole thing it's in the bag we've won and this is where we need to be at as believers we're on this journey of eternal separation i want to declare to you we've won we've won it doesn't matter what it looks like it doesn't matter what what enemy comes on or anything like that we have actually we won we can call an eternal separation to anything that's bothering you today any anything that's of the death from the egyptians anything there you can just call it call it i've won that's it i'm done i've won call an eternal separation this is what i was speaking of two weeks ago when i just briefly mentioned that because i'm going through we always go through trials right that's why i appreciated the song this morning because that was what i wanted to actually speak about we go through trials and we understand that god wins that we can trust in his word we understand that through what we go through so as we go on that's why you go through one trial and then you may not go through it like you should you may have unbelief in there and start to doubt and then the lord pulls you through and you think why did i doubt in that trial i should have believed because look at the outcome right you'd feel silly when you're an israeli when you're a jew when you've been just crossed the red scene all the enemy has gone and you were the one that was complaining they're going to kill us and now oh they're all dead uh you know you feel silly and you should because you didn't believe there was unbelief from hell it's from hell you didn't you shouldn't have done you should have just believed you should have been taping the tambourine here going praise the lord we've won i'm going to call it the race isn't finished yet don't care i'm calling it we've won it's an impossibility that we're ever going to lose we're done we've won we won the whole thing and that's what the lord prodded my heart about when i went in a in this new trial i'm going through because you always get one you get one then that finishes you get another one already waiting for you you know it's lined up ready to go and i started to have a bit of doubt in the situation and the lord rebuked me and said why are you thinking that you have been going through this walk for too long to even think that thought why are you thinking it have i ever not delivered you in any situation have i ever not delivered you have you have you have i ever let you down then why are you thinking like that why are you calling eternal separation to that thought call it you've won call it just call it and i called it i'm like that's it i'm calling it a one that's it there's no more any that time that negative thought comes i'm done with it i've won i'm calling it there's an eternal separation where i'm going that thought doesn't exist therefore i'm on the way out of here i'm calling it you're gone i'm separating now i'm calling an eternal separation now that's where i'm at calling eternal separation anything like depression call it call it i'm calling the internal separations there it ain't gonna be where i'm going it's from where i just left then call it just call it we've already won we've won that battle anything that you go through if you've got any worry you worry about stuff we're on an eternal separation from worry just call it just call it don't don't think oh don't don't try and reason in your mind call those things that were not as though they were that's what that's the situation that we can they're wearing and that's what we can do as believers just call it a one i don't i when we eternally separate don't think i'll just go through this and maybe the next one i'm you know i'm calling eternal separation to that no more that's i'm done they they could have caught an eternal separation to the egyptians and they were gone that's it you're gone i don't care if you're all surrounding me you're gone you're gonna be in the red sea actually they didn't know where they were gonna be but they're like i don't care i'm eternally separating from you and you ain't gonna be where i'm going therefore i'm just going to enjoy life now with you being gone you're gone anything that you've got any anything that's from hell that oppresses you just call it call it call an eternal separation because where we're going it won't be just weigh it up are you going to be where i'm going no then you're gone eternally separate just draw the line say no no more that's it i'm done with it i'm done with this whole thing any kind of fear that you've got you've got fears you live with any sort of fear fear of the future you're not going to be worrying about your future when you're in heaven i can assure you of that so why worry now why where's that thought from from where you've just left then call it i'm done with it no more i'm having there's an eternal separation between me and that it's gone just call an eternal separation that's the something in your life that bothers you like a besetting sin that you think i can't overcome you can it ain't gonna be where you're going i can assure you of that just call it say no call it that's where we are as believers we just we we draw the line we say no that's it i'm done eternal separation between me and you eternal separation between me and the egyptians your death i'm gone there's this great separation happening even if you're you know you might be in this life chasing after natural things you know like the you know and you you maybe feel you shouldn't be but you're just chasing after them because it's this little thing just call it chase after god you know say no i'm not chasing after anyone i'm chasing after god that's it tell you what the things that we're chasing after in this life ain't going to be there when we get there they're not going to be there they won't be there then just call it call an eternal separation to that when you call it in your mind you think okay i'm eternally separate okay well then that's it it's like it's eternally separated i'm eternally separating from that to this new thing to whatever the promise of god is that's what you eternally separate to the the promise of god any any like if you're caught up in any sort of filth and stuff like your mind just call it it ain't going to be where you're going i can guarantee you of that then call it just call an eternal separation to it it's very easy satan likes to tell us that it's complicated oh you've got to do all these things no you don't you just call it resist the devil he'll flee from you just call it i'm calling it how's he going to do it i don't know you don't have to work and all that how's going to happen just call it i'm calling it it'll happen somehow somehow or another it will happen there will come an eternal separation if you want it so that's it i'm done with it no more no more of this no more other things if you're selfish if you've got a selfish trait you know you're not going to be selfish in the kingdom of heaven you're going to be loving and just for everyone else call it here then just call it any any traits in you that you think i just don't want that then just call it lord i don't want that anymore all of these things if satan hinders you from going to church you're going to be going to church in heaven i can assure you of that these little things you know like if there's a little thing just call it call an eternal separation from what from anything like that we have the ability to and the sooner that we do the happier that will be and we don't want to look silly when we don't and then it turns out that it all works out we're like oh i should have done that just call it just call an eternal separation we're on this exodus we're separating from all these things any unbelief any unbelief in the word of god just call it be say i'm done with it no i'm done no more no more because there is going to be an eternal separation to every bit of unbelief you've ever thought because that's going to go one way you're going the other way so let's just we must keep up with it you know keep up with god's program which is just call it call an internal step god's program here was everything was done you're as good they're on their way out the door god said look folks everything's as good as done just enjoy yourself miriam get out the tambourine start clapping start praising let's do this just enjoy yourself you've won we're on the way out of here that's where we're at this is that's the situation that's where we're at we just call it calling eternal separation and it's this this thought has helped me a lot when i start when this old thought comes back and i'm like oh no no hang on hang on no no i'm eternally separated from you no no no no no this is and when you get that thought in your mind you think that's a big thought to think never ever ever again wow like eternally wow okay that's not like oh i'll just try and keep you down as long as i can no no no you're eternally separated i'm going to be eternally separated it's gone done i'm finished with it eternally separated and that's the promise that we have as believers to be eternally separated as we're on this exodus that was my thought that i have you this morning so go for this week and start thinking that when it comes up think actually no i'm eternally separating you're these people start celebrating on your way at the door you know that's all you need to do amen amen it was it was only a small thought this morning but let's um it's nice because i think we should just have a time of worship this morning i really feel there's a nice atmosphere you know when we were
