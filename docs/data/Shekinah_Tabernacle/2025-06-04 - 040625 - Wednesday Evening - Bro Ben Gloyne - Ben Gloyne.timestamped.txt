[1:20] She sounds
[1:31] Thank you, Lord, for this wonderful
[1:33] you've given us, Lord, that you keep us
[1:34] safe, Lord, through the the week so far,
[1:37] Lord. And Lord, I just want to pray that
[1:39] you feel welcome in our midst, Lord
[1:41] Jesus, as we've come again this evening,
[1:43] Lord, to hear from you, Lord. And Lord,
[1:45] I pray that it wouldn't just be a
[1:47] routine for us to come here every
[1:48] Wednesday and every Sunday, Lord, but
[1:50] that we'd come ready and um prayed up,
[1:53] Lord Jesus, to hear from you, Lord
[1:55] Jesus, that we'd take it as a privilege,
[1:57] Lord Jesus, and not for granted, Lord.
[2:00] And Lord, I just pray you be with those
[2:01] that couldn't make it this evening, be
[2:02] their portion, Lord, be wherever they
[2:04] are, Lord. And Lord, I pray for those
[2:06] sick and body as well. Just I pray you
[2:08] heal the world, Jesus, and be with us
[2:10] the rest of this evening. I pray in
[2:11] Jesus name. Amen.

[18:35] Oh
[18:37] Lord, I give myself
[18:40] away so
[18:43] you can use
[18:47] me. Amen. I believe that's all our
[18:50] hearts desire tonight, isn't it? The
[18:52] Lord can use us for his good pleasure.
[18:54] Amen. God bless you all. Amen. Thanks,
[18:56] Josh. Thank you, musicians. Amen. Good
[18:58] to see everyone here tonight. Amen.
[19:00] Praise the Lord. Trust you all well
[19:02] tonight. Amen. Everyone's well. Praise
[19:04] God. Amen. Let's just go to the
[19:06] scripture tonight. Uh let's have a um
[19:10] small thought here before we go to
[19:12] prayer. Um so we're going to go to uh
[19:15] Luke 5 and verses
[19:28] 1-9. Amen. So Luke 51-9 it says, "And it
[19:31] came to pass as the people pressed upon
[19:34] him to hear the word of God, he stood by
[19:37] the lake of uh Guinness and saw two
[19:41] ships standing by the lake, but the
[19:43] fishermen were gone out of them and were
[19:44] washing their nets. And he entered into
[19:47] one of the ships which was Simon's, and
[19:48] prayed him that he would thrust uh would
[19:51] thrust out a little from the land. And
[19:54] he sat down and taught the people out of
[19:55] the ship." Now when he had left
[19:57] speaking, he said unto Simon, "Launch
[19:59] out into the deep, and let down thy nets
[20:02] for for for a draft." And Simon
[20:05] answering unto him, said, "Master, we
[20:07] have toiled all night, and have taken
[20:08] nothing. Nevertheless, at thy word, I'll
[20:11] let down the net." And when he had um
[20:14] and when they had this done, they
[20:16] enclosed a great multitude of fishes,
[20:18] and their net break. And they beckoned
[20:20] unto their partners which were in the
[20:22] other ship, that they should come and
[20:24] help them. And they came and filled both
[20:26] the ships so that they began to sink.
[20:28] When Simon Peter saw it, he fell down at
[20:31] Jesus' knees, saying, "Depart from me,
[20:33] for I am a sinful man, O Lord." For he
[20:35] was astonished and all that were with
[20:37] him at the draft of the fishes which
[20:40] they had taken. Amen. What a scene.
[20:43] Amen. Let's bow heads in a word of
[20:45] prayer tonight. Amen. If you have a
[20:46] need, I know we're going to pray
[20:47] tonight, but you want to lift up your
[20:48] hand even now and say, "Lord, come by my
[20:51] way." Amen. Gracious heavenly father,
[20:53] our hearts desire as we give ourselves
[20:55] to you, dear God. That you can use us.
[20:57] You can live through us, Lord. You be
[20:58] glorified in our in our lives. And as we
[21:01] have read your word, we're asking that
[21:03] you would anoint it, Lord, to our
[21:04] hearts, Lord, both speaker and hearer.
[21:07] And I pray, dear God, as as this as this
[21:09] meeting goes along, Lord, I pray you
[21:11] would fill us all with your Holy Ghost,
[21:12] dear God. May you touch every life. May
[21:14] you have preeminence, Lord. Come take
[21:16] control of all of us, Father. Lord, that
[21:18] when we come to pray, it would be none
[21:20] of us in our humanity praying, but it be
[21:22] you using our vocal cords, our lips, our
[21:24] tongues, Lord, to pray through us, Lord
[21:26] God, what you would have prayed. Father,
[21:28] we so glad we can bow our heads and our
[21:30] hearts in your presence, asking that
[21:32] you'd be merciful unto us, Lord, that
[21:33] your blood would cover us and may you
[21:35] come and take full control for your
[21:37] glory in Jesus Christ's name. Lord, we
[21:39] also especially want to remember those
[21:40] who could not be here tonight. Lord, be
[21:42] their great abundant portion. I pray in
[21:45] Jesus Christ's name. Amen. Amen. And God
[21:47] bless you friends. You can have your
[21:48] seats tonight. And just want to just
[21:51] want to have a bit of a a just a small
[21:53] thought here from this from this um line
[21:56] where where Simon Peter would say unto
[21:58] unto the Lord, nevertheless at thy word
[22:01] will I let down the net. And I just want
[22:03] to ask this question. What could Jesus
[22:05] do with what you give him? It's amazing
[22:08] that everything the Lord would be given,
[22:10] he would multiply. He would make it a
[22:12] great thing out of even a little thing.
[22:14] And we have this scene here where where
[22:16] Jesus was uh pressed about by people and
[22:19] and and and there's the um two ships
[22:21] there by the lake and you know Simon
[22:23] Peter and and and the others fishing
[22:25] with him. They had already given up.
[22:26] They had already been fishing all night.
[22:28] They had already been trying and they
[22:29] hadn't caught a single thing. They
[22:31] hadn't got a single bite if we could say
[22:33] it that way. And they were already uh
[22:35] defeated. They had already given up.
[22:36] They washing their nets on the shore.
[22:39] But then the Lord asked if if he could
[22:41] borrow one of their boats. Now, brother
[22:43] Bram says that there's nothing the Lord
[22:45] does not borrow, but what he what he
[22:49] pays you for. He says he says, "Can I
[22:51] use your boat for a moment?" And he just
[22:53] got in the boat. And they pushed out a
[22:54] little bit. Then after he got through
[22:56] speaking, he said, "Come here, Simon,
[22:57] and you all." God never borrows nothing
[22:59] from you unless he pays you for it. Is
[23:01] that right? Jesus taken what faith the
[23:03] blind man had or what faith a woman had
[23:06] that was deaf and started with that
[23:07] building faith. See what I mean? He had
[23:09] he takes something to do something with.
[23:11] So he took Simon's boat and Simon I
[23:14] doubt very much he was excited to be on
[23:16] the boat again after being there all
[23:17] night. And sometimes we can be laboring
[23:19] and we can just be walking with the Lord
[23:20] feeling like we're not getting anywhere.
[23:22] But I tell you what, you're on the
[23:23] breakthrough of a miracle. Amen. God is
[23:25] about to do something miraculous. Like
[23:27] Simon Peter, it's amazing. He wasn't
[23:29] even under expectation for God to do
[23:30] anything, but yet God did something. And
[23:32] sometimes, you know, we can even get to
[23:34] a point where the devil uh gets it in
[23:36] our mind. What's the point in trying?
[23:38] But you know, but there's always in
[23:40] those moments, that's when God's about
[23:42] to step upon the scene. When all hope
[23:44] seemed gone, when you know, when trouble
[23:46] is just up to your eyeballs in trouble,
[23:47] that's when God steps on the scene and
[23:49] does something even greater than you
[23:50] could expect. Because I don't believe
[23:52] that they ever caught this many fish in
[23:54] their lives. Amen. But you see, they
[23:56] were obedient to the word of the Lord.
[23:58] They had the Messiah in their ship. They
[24:00] had the right ship. They had the right
[24:02] equipment. I'd say they had the right
[24:03] faith. The faith just had to be put into
[24:05] action according to his word. And then
[24:07] what happened? And God created the fish
[24:09] in the net. Hallelujah. Cuz I doubt very
[24:11] much before they dropped the net in the
[24:12] water, they would have seen a nibble or
[24:14] no no seagulls or whatever birds are on
[24:16] the Sea of Galilee gathering around
[24:18] where the fish are. But God, when the
[24:20] net went in, the fish got created in the
[24:22] net. Amen. So, see, they just put their
[24:25] nets into the hands of God and see what
[24:27] God did with it. Did a far greater thing
[24:29] than they could ever do just naturally
[24:31] fishing. And you see, so whatever God
[24:33] borrows, he pays back. Amen. He's no
[24:36] man's debtor. He will pay back and more.
[24:38] So, amen. You think of the great things
[24:40] that await those that love him. Yeah. It
[24:43] hasn't even mentioned, it hasn't even
[24:45] come into the mind of man how great that
[24:47] place is. You know, brother Bram would
[24:48] try and describe being past the curtain
[24:50] at time and he, you know, described that
[24:52] blue blueg grass field and how everyone
[24:54] looked and all those things. But when he
[24:56] came to try and describe the atmosphere
[24:59] of that place, English words couldn't
[25:01] even touch it. sublime. Couldn't even do
[25:04] it justice. How great it was to be in
[25:06] the just perfect love and no no
[25:08] sickness, hardship, pain, sorrow,
[25:10] nothing. Just to be in that atmosphere
[25:12] and because, you know, so so heaven is
[25:14] going to be far greater than we can
[25:15] fathom. Amen. Cuz God, you know, see the
[25:18] devil does the opposite. He'll use
[25:19] someone and throw them away. But God,
[25:21] God asks, uh, you know, can he use us?
[25:24] Can he step into our lives? Can he use
[25:26] us for his, you know, for the finishing
[25:28] of his plan of redemption? And then he
[25:30] doesn't throw us away. He takes us home
[25:32] with him. Praise the Lord. So, here they
[25:34] are and they and they said,
[25:35] "Nevertheless, Lord, at thy at thy word,
[25:37] we're going to let down the net." So,
[25:39] Lord, at thy word, we're going to we're
[25:41] going to follow your word. What you've
[25:42] commanded us to do, we're going to do
[25:43] it. We've been trying all night and
[25:45] we've given up, but now because you've
[25:47] commanded us now, Lord, this is what
[25:48] we're going to do. Amen. And so the
[25:50] great and you know then and then there's
[25:52] also a time
[25:53] where you know where where Jesus had a
[25:56] had a big meeting and then he asked his
[25:58] disciples to you know we need to feed
[26:00] these people and they said it's we don't
[26:02] have enough money it's impossible and
[26:04] and then and then you know there was a
[26:05] boy walking along that was going to
[26:07] school but he heard the sound of the
[26:09] crowd and you know brother dramatized it
[26:10] and he says you know you know this boy's
[26:12] going to school but then he heard hears
[26:14] the cries and the hosanas and the glory
[26:16] hallelujah over the hill so he decides
[26:18] to skip school that Okay. And he, you
[26:20] know, goes towards the meeting and he
[26:22] crosses the hill. He sees all the people
[26:24] and he sees the prayer line up on the
[26:26] top of the hill. There's the Messiah
[26:27] there and, you know, all these things
[26:28] are going on. He finds himself somehow
[26:31] around where the disciples are because
[26:32] it's good to get close to where the Lord
[26:34] is. You know, you don't want to be in
[26:35] the back. You want to be really where
[26:36] his presence is. So, he, you know, is
[26:38] just drawn up there and then, you know,
[26:40] God times everything perfectly that when
[26:42] he came and kind of came into uh, you
[26:44] know, the, you know, what do you call
[26:46] it? hearing distance or whatever of the
[26:48] discussion of what's going on is the
[26:50] Lord is saying we need to feed them and
[26:52] where's the bread and all these things
[26:53] you know he just came along and you know
[26:55] and something in the boy just caused him
[26:57] to hold up his lunch something in the
[26:59] boy was responding to the need of the
[27:01] moment and he just lifted up his lunch
[27:03] to the Lord and you know and and and
[27:05] when the Lord saw it he said it's enough
[27:07] cuz he was the creator and he took those
[27:09] took those two loaves and f five loaves
[27:12] and two fishes rather and he and he
[27:14] began to bless it and break it and you
[27:15] know then it became you know, broke off
[27:17] cooked fish and cooked loaves and, you
[27:19] know, he, you know, fed that multitude
[27:21] of people and he made leftovers. I like
[27:23] that. Jesus makes leftovers. Amen. He
[27:25] makes He gives you more than enough. Not
[27:28] just enough, more than enough. He
[27:30] doesn't just He doesn't just balance out
[27:31] the ledger, he puts more than. Amen. So,
[27:34] I believe in leftovers. Amen. So,
[27:35] anyway, you see, praise the Lord. So,
[27:37] so, so there he was. So, so Jesus So, so
[27:40] the boy gave him his lunch and the Lord
[27:42] fed a multitude. So you think about, you
[27:44] know, the boy did not really fathom what
[27:46] was going to happen that day, but God
[27:48] knew the potential of what the boy was
[27:50] carrying. It's the same thing with our
[27:51] faith. You know, if we just give our
[27:53] faith, cuz many people, I think we
[27:54] wrestle with do we have enough faith or
[27:56] not? That's really not the question to
[27:58] be asking. Where have you placed that
[28:00] faith in or who have you placed that
[28:02] faith in? If you place your faith in the
[28:04] revealed word of the day, Jesus Christ
[28:06] himself. Amen. Then he can take your
[28:08] faith and multiply it. Amen. To do what
[28:11] his word says it will do. Because
[28:13] remember, it is God that fulfills his
[28:15] promises. It's not it's not the preacher
[28:17] that fulfills the promises or even you.
[28:20] It's he that performs his word. It's he
[28:22] that fulfills his promises. And he's the
[28:24] one that gave the promise. Right? You
[28:26] think of the body change, the rapture.
[28:28] Who's going to fulfill that? Well, the
[28:30] one who gave the promise. It wasn't a
[28:31] preacher. It wasn't the seventh age
[28:33] messenger, brother Brand, that gave the
[28:34] promise. It was the Lord. It wasn't the
[28:36] Apostle Paul that penned in the Bible.
[28:38] No, it was the Lord himself that gave
[28:40] the promise. And if he gave the promise
[28:42] then therefore he has the ability or
[28:44] more than enough ability to do it. Amen.
[28:47] Amen. So so so the important thing is
[28:49] what who who are you placing your faith
[28:50] in? It's not even a question of do I
[28:52] have enough faith or not. And you say
[28:53] even if I'm even if you feel lacking you
[28:55] be like that father with the son who had
[28:57] the epileptic spirit on him. Lord I
[28:59] believe but help my unbelief. So Lord
[29:01] take me the rest of the distance cuz I
[29:03] have a need in my life Lord and I but
[29:05] Lord take me to that place where it
[29:07] comes into manifestation. He will. He
[29:10] did it for the boy with the epileptic
[29:11] child. Do you think he'll not do the
[29:13] same thing for you? Amen. He took the
[29:15] boy's lunch and he fed the 5,000 and
[29:17] that's just the men counting the women
[29:18] and children. Do you not think he can
[29:20] take your faith? Amen. And multiply it,
[29:22] make it greater when you place it in his
[29:24] hands instead of you trying to humanly
[29:26] trying to work everything out, you place
[29:28] it in his his hands and let him fulfill
[29:30] his word. Isn't that beautiful? Amen.
[29:33] I'm so glad that whatever we place in
[29:34] his hands, he can he can meet the need
[29:37] with that thing. Amen. But you see, it's
[29:39] it's it's really the question also is
[29:41] not do you have enough faith cuz that's
[29:43] the devil's question. Oh, you don't have
[29:45] enough or and how does he know by the
[29:47] way, but it's actually our attitude
[29:49] towards the promise that matters. Amen.
[29:51] Cuz I think many times we focus on it.
[29:53] Maybe it's just me. I focus on myself
[29:54] too much. Turn the mirror onto the Lord.
[29:57] Look at him. Right? Stop looking at
[29:59] yourself and you. I know this is the
[30:01] selfie generation, but let's not be
[30:03] selfie Christians looking at ourselves.
[30:06] Let's look at the promise. Look at the
[30:07] one who gave the promise. Keep our eyes
[30:09] upon him. Who's the one who sent the
[30:11] message? Jesus Christ himself. Look at
[30:12] him. Amen. Look at his word. Look on
[30:15] this. Amen. Don't, you know, don't look
[30:16] on yourself or your track record or
[30:18] where you've been. That doesn't matter.
[30:20] Look at what he has said. Amen. But you
[30:22] see, it's the attitude we come. And this
[30:24] boy came with the right attitude. Here
[30:26] you go. Now, I remember being a young
[30:28] boy. Lunch was one of the favorite times
[30:30] of the day.
[30:32] the ending bell was the most favorite
[30:33] time, but lunch was the, you know,
[30:36] second favorite time. And I need to eat.
[30:39] Okay. So, this boy, I don't think he
[30:40] would part with his lunch for anything.
[30:42] But he saw something in him. Said, "Here
[30:44] you go, Lord. I'll give you this. I'm
[30:46] not going to be selfish with this,
[30:47] Lord." And so, he came with the right
[30:49] attitude. He didn't come fasting. He
[30:51] didn't he didn't he didn't kick up and
[30:53] throw a tantrum because he had to give
[30:54] his lunch away. He came with the right
[30:56] attitude. And it's the same thing when
[30:58] the Lord comes to us and says, "Give me.
[31:01] Can I borrow you? Can I use you?" It's
[31:04] not a tantrum or, "Oh, yes, I'm going to
[31:05] be a great person." No. Yes, Lord. You
[31:08] have the right attitude. Come with
[31:10] humility, love, and reverence. Right?
[31:12] Because Brother Ram says, "Before we
[31:13] pray for the sick," and we're going to
[31:14] be praying for the sick tonight. I mean,
[31:16] there's a lot of sick, you know, of us,
[31:17] there's sicknesses going around, all
[31:19] these things. So, he says, "But before
[31:21] we pray for the sick, we've got to get
[31:23] the people in that attitude." ude it's
[31:25] the attitude that always brings the
[31:26] results. I thought it was the music. I
[31:28] thought it was the dynamic preaching. I
[31:30] thought it was this or that. No, it's
[31:31] the attitude that brings the results.
[31:34] Amen. It's the attitude that you take
[31:35] towards God. What's your attitude? Well,
[31:38] Lord, you're more than able. Lord,
[31:40] you're in control. Lord, you're supreme.
[31:42] Lord, my life is in your hands. Whatever
[31:45] direction you want me to go, I know
[31:47] you're going with me because you're my
[31:48] shepherd. You're not going to send me
[31:50] away just by myself. You'll never leave
[31:51] me nor forsake me. So Lord, I know you
[31:54] know what's best for me. Hallelujah.
[31:56] Amen. Here's a woman that touched his
[31:58] garment. She was healed with a blood
[31:59] issue and a and a soldier spit in his
[32:01] face and put a crown of thorns on his
[32:03] head and felt no virtue. It's your
[32:05] approach. It's the attitude is what it
[32:07] takes. And that's what it is tonight,
[32:09] dear friend. It takes the attitude. We
[32:11] are and we believe that we are in the
[32:12] presence of Jesus Christ. But it's your
[32:14] attitude that brings the results. The
[32:16] dynamics is here and so I mean sorry.
[32:18] The mechanics is here and so is the
[32:20] dynamics. If you can just get started,
[32:22] God will do the rest. Well, how do you
[32:25] get started? Lord, I submit all
[32:27] everything into your hands, Lord. You're
[32:28] the supreme one. You made, you're the
[32:30] alpha and omega. You're the king of
[32:32] everything. Lord, I submit myself under
[32:34] your mighty hand. That's how you get
[32:36] started. Lord, I love you in every
[32:38] situation. I love you. I believe the
[32:40] Apostle Paul could have would have said
[32:42] that in the prison. Said that on the
[32:43] ship. Said that being on the run. Lord,
[32:45] I love you. I'm so thankful you found me
[32:47] on the road to Damascus. Lord, you
[32:49] turned my life around and I'm so glad
[32:51] that I'm your son and you're my God.
[32:53] Hallelujah. Amen. So, you see, Amen. So,
[32:57] so, so it's our attitude. But you see,
[32:59] we've got to we've got to uh surrender
[33:04] something, right? In order for him to
[33:06] get something, someone had to surrender
[33:08] something. So, the boy had to surrender
[33:09] his food and Peter had to surrender his
[33:11] boat. What if we and God just did those
[33:14] things with those things? What if we
[33:15] surrender all our
[33:17] life? What could he do? Amen. I'm just
[33:21] putting this. You say, "Well, I'm fully
[33:22] surrendered." Well, that's good. But
[33:24] what could he do through your life now
[33:26] if if we're in his hand? Amen. Amen.
[33:29] It's it's unlimited what he could
[33:31] do. Amen. Now, John Wesley said this,
[33:34] and I and and and I hope you can read
[33:36] this, but but this is what John Wesley
[33:38] saw in the potential of a surrendered
[33:40] group. He says, "Give me a hundred men
[33:42] who love only God with all their heart
[33:44] and hate only sin with all their heart,
[33:46] and we will shake the gates of hell and
[33:48] bring in the kingdom of God in one
[33:49] generation." That was John Wesley's
[33:52] conviction of the potential of a 100 men
[33:55] fully sold out to God.
[33:58] Amen.
[34:00] What could happen in this generation?
[34:02] You say, "Oh, that can't happen." Yeah,
[34:04] it can. We're living in the generation,
[34:06] by the way, the word's fully open. I
[34:08] mean, we're not under a partial
[34:09] reformation. soon under a full
[34:11] restoration. Right. God God is in his
[34:13] people once again. That's right. Amen.
[34:15] So, praise the Lord. Lord, there's great
[34:18] potential in my life that you can use
[34:20] me. Amen. To be a living witness to this
[34:23] generation. Now, the nice thing is it's
[34:25] not only things like boats or bread or
[34:29] our lives or things that that that we
[34:31] can give to the Lord. Okay? It says, it
[34:33] says here in in in 1 Peter 5, he says,
[34:36] "Humble yourselves, therefore, under the
[34:37] mighty hand of God that he that he may
[34:39] exalt you in due time, casting all your
[34:42] cares upon him, for he carth for you."
[34:45] Amen. So you can give him you can give
[34:47] him your cares. Now, he doesn't multiply
[34:49] them, but he but he carries them. You
[34:52] know, like brother Ram would say, you
[34:53] know, his yoke is easy. His burden is
[34:55] light. And he says his yoke is actually
[34:57] lined with eagle feathers. I mean,
[34:59] there's a joy in being yolked with the
[35:01] Lord. Amen. you keep Calvary before you
[35:02] and his, you know, what he's done to
[35:04] you. His yoke is easy, his burdens
[35:06] light. Amen. And you can cast all your
[35:08] cares upon him. You know, I'm so
[35:10] thankful the Lord is not, you know, uh,
[35:13] he's not made like many husbands are
[35:16] that when that when their wives begin to
[35:18] pour out all their needs and their
[35:20] troubles and their trials that he
[35:22] doesn't say just toughen up and be
[35:23] quiet. He's not like that. He listens to
[35:26] all of our needs. He takes them on
[35:27] board. He doesn't get upset with us when
[35:30] we get overwhelmed and begin to just
[35:31] pour out our our, you know, needs and
[35:34] our problems and our vent our
[35:36] frustrations. He doesn't get frustrated
[35:37] with us. He doesn't even get annoyed at
[35:39] us. Amen. He cares. Amen. Our value in
[35:44] no way diminishes because we get
[35:46] overwhelmed. Amen. Here is Elijah and
[35:48] he's, you know, just had his great
[35:49] victory on Mount Carmel. He's now
[35:51] running for his life and, you know, he's
[35:53] sitting there under the juniper tree.
[35:54] He's all discouraged because he's
[35:56] running because Jezebel threatened to
[35:58] kill his life. And there he is. He says,
[36:00] "Lord, take my life from me. He
[36:02] requested for himself that he might
[36:04] die." And said, "It's enough, oh Lord.
[36:05] Take away my life. I'm no better than my
[36:07] fathers." He's just he's just pouring
[36:09] out his frustration and trouble. And
[36:11] he's overwhelmed. And you know, God
[36:13] doesn't tell him, "Be quiet, Elijah. You
[36:15] shouldn't be talking like that, Elijah.
[36:17] Harden up, Elijah. This is the facts,
[36:18] Elijah." No. No. He took those cares.
[36:21] God took Elijah's cares upon himself
[36:23] because Elijah was giving him something.
[36:25] Praise the Lord. And was he still the
[36:27] prophet of God? Absolutely. Was he
[36:30] going? Now listen, look at this. He's
[36:32] praying contrary to the will of God. Cuz
[36:34] the will of God for Elijah is he goes in
[36:36] a chariot ride, right? That's God's
[36:38] ordained path for Elijah. He's got to
[36:41] find Elisha. He's got to do different
[36:42] things, but he's not going to die. He's
[36:44] just going to take a step onto a chariot
[36:46] and go up into glory. But here he is
[36:48] praying completely the opposite to the
[36:50] will of God. Does God get upset? No.
[36:54] What does God do? He sends angels. He
[36:56] feeds him. He puts him back to sleep. He
[36:59] rests him. Amen. Because remember
[37:02] Elijah's going to uh the mountain where
[37:06] Moses was visited by God, right? This is
[37:08] this is his plan. And God doesn't tell
[37:11] him, "Don't go there." He doesn't
[37:13] intervene and say, "Look, where are you
[37:14] going? You're going the wrong way."
[37:15] He He knows that Elijah's overwhelmed.
[37:18] He just knows Elijah needs a break.
[37:21] Praise the Lord. Says you can cast all
[37:23] your cares, all your troubles. There's
[37:25] nothing you can't tell God. That he will
[37:27] get upset with you about.
[37:30] Amen. I I'm sorry. This is just how I
[37:32] view God. My God's a rock. He's stable.
[37:35] He can take anything. Amen. If he could
[37:37] take the sin of the world upon himself
[37:38] on Calvary, he can take my frustrations
[37:40] and my troubles and my confused mind and
[37:43] my thinking and all these things. He can
[37:45] take it all. Hallelujah. Why? Because
[37:47] he's my burden bearer. Amen. He can, you
[37:49] know, and what does he do? And I don't
[37:51] have it here, but the next few verses,
[37:53] you can read it. Go away and read it.
[37:54] Maybe this is homework. He sends an
[37:56] angel and he and he searches through
[37:58] heaven. He finds the best baker angel,
[38:01] right? Feeds him some cakes, puts him to
[38:04] sleep, I think, wakes him up again,
[38:06] feeds him again, and then gives him
[38:08] strength for his journey to the cave,
[38:10] right? And then and then when God then
[38:12] when Elijah's in the cave, God comes
[38:14] down, you know, you know, there's a
[38:16] whirlwind, there's a fire and all those
[38:17] things, but he comes God comes as a
[38:19] still small voice and says, "Elijah,
[38:21] what are you doing here?" Was he mad at
[38:24] Elijah?
[38:26] No. He just knew Elijah was overwhelmed.
[38:30] Praise the Lord. When my heart is
[38:31] overwhelmed, Lord, lead me to the rock
[38:33] that's higher than I. Right? You can
[38:35] cast all your cares. You can, this is a
[38:37] very stressful age. You can cast all
[38:39] your stress upon the Lord. Amen. Amen.
[38:42] Amen. And he doesn't multiply it. He
[38:45] takes it upon himself. Right? Like Moses
[38:47] was showing there when you the burning
[38:49] bush, how God tell him, "Take your hand,
[38:51] put it into your bosom." Pulls out it
[38:53] lepous. Put it in again. It became
[38:54] normal. So what is that showing? God
[38:56] saying, "I'll take your sin and your
[38:58] troubles. Put it into my bosom. Pull it
[39:00] out and it's gone." Amen. Hallelujah.
[39:04] Praise the Lord. So we can we can cast
[39:07] all our cares upon him because he cares
[39:10] for us.
[39:13] Amen. Aren't you glad? How I'm so
[39:17] thankful about that? You know, we can to
[39:19] me that gets us in the right attitude.
[39:21] Lord, you care. Lord, you're interested
[39:22] in everything. What I'm going through, I
[39:24] may be going in a cycle, going around
[39:26] the mountain, but yet you care about me,
[39:28] Lord. Praise the Lord. Amen. I just want
[39:31] to finish with this. This is from uh the
[39:33] uh Africa Trip report. what he says. Now
[39:34] look friends, you might
[39:36] have, how do you say that? Sained.
[39:38] Sained. It's like, you know, when you
[39:40] fish, maybe Maron, you can help me. Do
[39:42] you know these kind of words? When
[39:43] you're like fishing and there's
[39:44] virtually no fish left in the lake or
[39:46] whatever, you're sing I think is what it
[39:47] is. Through every doctor's office in the
[39:49] country, you may have been in every
[39:50] clinic there has been there at the very
[39:52] best of our beloved doctors might have
[39:53] given you the last prescription they
[39:55] can. You've done everything. You might
[39:57] have been through this prayer line, that
[39:58] prayer line, this prayer meeting, this
[40:01] Why do you say tonight? This is Saturday
[40:03] night, tomorrow, Sunday. Let's say this,
[40:05] Lord, I've done all but at thy word. I'm
[40:08] going to let down the net tonight.
[40:09] Tonight, I'm going to believe. This is
[40:11] the time when I'm going to take you at
[40:12] your word. When you said, that's why I
[40:15] underline that. When you said, see, God
[40:17] loves to be reminded, Lord, you said.
[40:20] You said, Lord, amen. Whatsoever things
[40:23] you desire when you pray, believe you
[40:25] receive it and you shall have it. I'm
[40:27] letting down tonight, Lord, every doubt,
[40:29] every fear at your word. I'm coming,
[40:31] Lord. Hallelujah. We're coming, Lord,
[40:34] tonight as a group of people washed in
[40:36] his blood, Lord. Amen. Taking at your
[40:38] word, Lord, cuz you said if two agree on
[40:40] earth concern anything, you'll do it. He
[40:42] said it, not me. Amen. So, let's have
[40:45] the musicians
[40:47] uh
[40:48] tonight. Praise the Lord. Amen. And
[40:50] we're just going to I want to sing that
[40:51] song. He's a miracle working. You know,

[40:54] Isaac's song. He's a miracle working
[40:56] God. And then, um, we're going to take
[40:58] the prayer requests and then we're going
[40:59] to have a time of
[41:04] prayer. I've got it
[41:06] here. Amen. I'm not sure what what key
[41:09] this should be in, Brother Josh, you
[41:11] know.
[41:16] Amen. Should we Should we stand tonight?
