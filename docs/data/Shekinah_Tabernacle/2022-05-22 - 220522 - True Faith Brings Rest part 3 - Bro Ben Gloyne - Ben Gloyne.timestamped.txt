[43:45] for i know whom i have believed and am
[43:48] persuaded that he is able to keep that
[43:50] which i have committed unto him against
[43:52] that day
[43:53] amen
[43:54] hello i know in whom i have believed i
[43:57] trust you have that same
[43:59] uh revelation in your heart now we're
[44:00] going to go to acts 27 as well we're
[44:02] going to go acts 27 and verses 17 to 26
[44:05] this is a bit of a lengthy reading here
[44:08] but
[44:09] so acts 27 and 17.
[44:17] so in the midst of the storm when the
[44:19] apostle paul's on his way to rome
[44:22] so just notice that here so
[44:25] which when they had taken up they used
[44:27] helps undergirding the ship and fearing
[44:29] less they should fall into the
[44:31] quicksands strike sail and also were
[44:33] driven and we being exceedingly tossed
[44:36] in a tempest the next day they lighted
[44:39] the ship and the third day we cast out
[44:41] with our own hands the tackling of the
[44:42] ship and when neither son nor stars in
[44:45] many days appeared and no small tempest
[44:47] lay on us all hope that we should be
[44:49] saved was then taken away
[44:51] but after long abstinence paul stood
[44:54] forth in the midst of them and said sirs
[44:56] you should have hearkened unto me and
[44:58] have not loosed from crete and to have
[45:00] gained this harm and loss and now i
[45:03] exhort you to be of good chair for there
[45:06] shall be no loss of any man's life among
[45:08] you but of the ship but they stood by me
[45:10] this night the angel of god whose i am
[45:12] and whom i am served saying fear not
[45:14] paul thou must be brought before caesar
[45:17] and lo god
[45:18] hath given thee all them that sail with
[45:21] thee
[45:22] wherefore sirs be of good cheer for i
[45:23] believe god that it shall be even as it
[45:26] was told me
[45:28] amen and let's just go to um hebrews 11
[45:32] and 1 very familiar scripture amen to us
[45:35] all but we're just going to
[45:37] read that again
[45:39] so hebrews 11 and verse 1
[45:42] says here
[45:49] so hebrews 11 1 it says now faith is the
[45:51] substance of things hoped for the
[45:53] evidence of things not seen
[45:56] amen let's bow heads in the word of
[45:58] prayer this morning
[46:00] gracious father we just want to ask lord
[46:02] as we come into your presence lord that
[46:04] you will just do a work in our hearts
[46:06] lord may you just lord i just pray that
[46:08] you'll just manifest your faith in our
[46:10] lives dear god i pray that you'll make a
[46:13] very clear differentiation between human
[46:15] faith and perfect faith and lord we want
[46:18] to walk in perfect faith lord we want to
[46:20] walk according to the faith of the son
[46:21] of god and just want to pray dear god as
[46:23] we've read your word i just want to ask
[46:25] lord it's the same god that lord you
[46:27] spoke to the apostle paul there lord
[46:29] through great storms lord but he told
[46:30] him that this is not going to be the end
[46:32] father he could he could trust in your
[46:34] revelation lord you quicken that to him
[46:36] and father lord we go through the storms
[46:38] of life as well and i just pray to god
[46:40] that may we just realize lord this is
[46:42] not our end we're just going through it
[46:43] lord you're going to take us through for
[46:44] your glory father we want to commit our
[46:46] lives into your hands just pray you
[46:48] would be with us lord bless the reading
[46:49] of your word may bless the hearer and
[46:51] speaker dear god be with those who are
[46:53] streaming as well we ask these things
[46:55] lord for your glory in jesus christ's
[46:57] name amen amen amen god bless you may
[47:00] have your seats amen i want to welcome
[47:02] david here too god bless you bro how you
[47:03] doing good to see you amen we so we get
[47:06] so every um so we're speaking about uh
[47:08] the difference between uh human faith
[47:11] and uh divine faith or perfect faith and
[47:14] true faith well uh if i can call it that
[47:16] uh perfect faith gives gives rest brings
[47:19] rest
[47:20] now the apostle paul
[47:22] was such a man that he could walk by
[47:25] perfect faith now we know he's our
[47:27] example he's the pattern of every true
[47:29] minister down through the age and also
[47:31] his life as a pattern even for the
[47:32] believer where where where god would
[47:35] take him he'd manifest the word for his
[47:37] day he'd sure he'd go through great
[47:38] trials and suffering but i just want you
[47:41] to know from the from the onset real
[47:43] faith does not is not a force field from
[47:46] from trouble now i'm probably going to
[47:48] repeat a bit from wednesday but i want
[47:49] to emphasize these things but you know
[47:51] but really brother brown says when you
[47:53] really meet god that's really when you
[47:54] get on the battlefield that's really
[47:56] where the battle really starts that's
[47:57] where trouble begins but the great thing
[48:00] is when trouble begins there is because
[48:02] you should know a god when you really
[48:04] meet him you know the lord that can
[48:05] defeat every trouble right so
[48:08] so there's a big difference between
[48:10] between human human faith intellectual
[48:12] faith and true faith now true faith is a
[48:14] revelation it is perfect faith true
[48:16] faith is not based on your emotion but
[48:19] it anchors in the word of god that's its
[48:21] resting place
[48:22] human faith is worked out it's
[48:24] manufactured by what a person does or
[48:27] thinks or learns
[48:29] human faith relies on the person's
[48:32] ability to overcome that is mind over
[48:34] matter and it will fail
[48:37] every every once human faith fails it
[48:39] has to fail because only god can be the
[48:42] unfailing one
[48:43] now human faith can be mixed with with
[48:46] revelation and so we've got to be very
[48:49] careful that our human faith does not
[48:50] interject into our revelation now
[48:52] the um peter the apostle had that great
[48:55] revelation where where jesus would ask
[48:57] his disciples who do men say that i am
[48:58] and you know they'd say well you're
[49:00] you're
[49:01] or elias or one of the prophets but then
[49:02] jesus asked him he said but who do you
[49:04] say i am and peter was the one who said
[49:06] thou art the christ the son of the
[49:08] living god and so peter would be told by
[49:10] jesus bless out thou simon by jonah
[49:13] flesh and blood has not revealed this
[49:14] unto you but my father in heaven so you
[49:16] didn't you didn't work this out by by
[49:18] the consensus of your fellow disciples
[49:19] or what people were saying or even your
[49:21] own mind it was actually god himself
[49:24] revealed it to you sovereignly he says
[49:26] now upon this rock i'll build my church
[49:28] which is that and that rock is the
[49:29] revelation of who jesus christ is the
[49:32] word but you see peter would come to a
[49:34] place where where where where because
[49:36] this human faith was still there because
[49:38] it was it was um before pentecost where
[49:40] where he would jesus would tell him that
[49:42] he he tells disciples many times i'm
[49:45] going to be giving him to the hands of
[49:46] wicked men i'm going to be crucified but
[49:48] on the third day i'm going to raise
[49:49] again and peter would try and withstand
[49:51] that
[49:52] and you know it's amazing how jesus even
[49:54] told peter that that you know before the
[49:57] crows three times because he said
[49:58] i'm gonna go die you know yo i'll go
[50:00] with you he says no before the
[50:01] grows three times you're gonna deny me
[50:03] or you're gonna die deny me thrice but
[50:05] peter peter didn't say no lord may i not
[50:08] fall into this temptation deliver me
[50:10] from it you know no he just he just
[50:11] didn't even answer him and basically
[50:13] what he was saying without saying was i
[50:15] don't believe you
[50:17] even though he had that revelation that
[50:18] jesus was the christ but in his humanity
[50:20] and his pride he thought no i'm going to
[50:23] overcome this in my own ability because
[50:25] he's a big burly fisherman he's a rugged
[50:27] fisherman he's a rugged apostle right
[50:29] but you see god god allowed him to go
[50:32] through that for actually that to be
[50:34] taken out of him so failure failure can
[50:37] be a real good thing because failure god
[50:39] uses failure to take things out of our
[50:41] lives because when we fail we're like
[50:42] lord i failed you know we can't blame no
[50:45] one else we are the you know the
[50:47] underlying or the or the or the same
[50:49] ingredient in every circumstance is you
[50:52] right so you've got to come to that
[50:53] realization actually it's me o lord
[50:56] standing in the need of prayer right
[50:58] it's not the other person it's actually
[51:00] me i need it right so peter had to come
[51:02] to that place where he realized his own
[51:04] human ability was a failure and brother
[51:06] graham says in perk perfect strength
[51:08] perfect weakness we must master the
[51:10] thought of human ability so what that
[51:12] means is we must come to realization
[51:14] it's not our own human ability that will
[51:16] that will make us be believers or help
[51:18] us overcome we cannot do it it takes him
[51:20] it takes him inside us he's the
[51:22] overcomer right so so peter was lifted
[51:25] up and pried there and his pride was
[51:27] speaking that see because it was it was
[51:30] his human faith responded and he tried
[51:33] to speak his outcome in his own human
[51:35] faith i'm going to go die with you i'm
[51:36] going to stand everyone else will
[51:38] remember i'm going to stand i'm peter
[51:39] i'm not like john and all these other
[51:41] guys i'm i'm a different stuff but no no
[51:43] he was the same stuff
[51:46] so it was it was this human ability
[51:48] speaking that was mixed with pride
[51:50] and pride is always normally mixed with
[51:53] human faith
[51:54] and he failed miserably
[51:57] now but god's grace stepped in because
[51:59] god didn't want to leave him in that
[52:00] state he was he had the key to the
[52:02] kingdom he had to use them
[52:04] right so so god didn't leave him and i'm
[52:06] so thankful our lord doesn't leave us in
[52:08] that kind of state you know we may feel
[52:10] so broken and disheartened but god wants
[52:12] to work with you and that he cannot work
[52:14] remember he resists the proud he can't
[52:16] work in the pride proud life you know he
[52:19] needs he needs to bring us to a place
[52:21] where we say lord
[52:22] i failed
[52:24] i can't do this i need you and then he
[52:25] says well i've been waiting for you to
[52:26] say that because remember he's a
[52:28] gentleman he doesn't force himself upon
[52:30] anyone we have to be willing to say lord
[52:31] put me on your operating table i mean
[52:33] take your word and just do the surgery
[52:35] you need to do i rearranged my life
[52:38] amen so now so real faith is a
[52:41] revelation it's purely and sovereignly
[52:43] god given and no one can boast that they
[52:46] have it so there's just a recap from
[52:47] wednesday i'm just mixing in a few
[52:49] things now faith is not deciding what
[52:51] you want and then asking for it
[52:53] human true faith is not deciding well i
[52:55] want that lord give it to me
[52:57] that is that is human faith saying you
[53:00] know the name and claim it cut thing out
[53:01] of our humanity it's real faith is what
[53:04] you're lead to believe for it's what the
[53:06] lord leads you to believe or then you
[53:07] claim that right so you say lord lead me
[53:10] to every promise lead me to every
[53:12] promise and whatever arrangement you
[53:14] want to be if it's healing than my
[53:16] family then whatever more but lead me to
[53:18] that promised lord every promise you
[53:20] know by faith it's yours but lord take
[53:21] me to the promise
[53:23] pardon me take me to that promise oh god
[53:25] i mean because you've got to realize
[53:26] every time now we believe we're living
[53:28] in the season of the power of the spoken
[53:30] word manifested are we not amen you know
[53:32] the third pull is here we're not waiting
[53:34] for it to come it's here that power has
[53:36] been released into a bribe by this open
[53:38] word it's here right now right it's
[53:40] right here the former ladder rain are
[53:41] falling where we're living in the season
[53:43] of the bride's revival it's happening
[53:45] right now we're not waiting for it to
[53:46] come it's here i mean because revival is
[53:49] always linked with the opening of the
[53:50] word right and there's no other eighth
[53:52] myth there's no eighth messenger in the
[53:54] scripture we've had the seventh message
[53:56] he's opened the words to the revivals
[53:57] here
[53:58] right so it's all here
[54:00] so we're not looking for something it's
[54:02] here it's already within us
[54:05] oh we need the squeeze no it's already
[54:07] in you
[54:08] that power's already in you
[54:11] amen
[54:12] so now but every time the power of the
[54:14] spoken word was activated or or manifest
[54:16] in the prophet's life it wasn't him that
[54:18] caused it to happen
[54:20] he did not decide when he was sitting in
[54:22] the sitting there squirrel hunting i
[54:24] want i want these squirrels and i want
[54:25] to speak them into existence sure he is
[54:27] pondering on that scripture whatsoever
[54:29] he say right but it was god saying what
[54:32] do you need what are you here for
[54:34] i'm hunting oh well how many squirrels
[54:36] do you want it was god actually saying
[54:37] it to him but he had to respond to the
[54:39] call it wasn't him in his mind saying
[54:41] wouldn't that be cool if that happened
[54:43] that way no it was god given i mean when
[54:46] the little fish was given back its life
[54:48] it was the woods boys were having
[54:50] fellowship on the boat when they are
[54:51] fishing because they just got saved and
[54:53] they were talking about let's go see old
[54:55] sister son so there was a real christian
[54:57] we want to tell her that we've met the
[54:58] same jesus she knows and god came down
[55:01] into their fellowship and manifested the
[55:03] spoken word it wasn't the prophet that
[55:06] ignited it it wasn't even the woods boys
[55:08] that said let's let's let's pray you
[55:10] know let's speak life back into this
[55:12] fish no they were just having fellowship
[55:14] god stepped out into the fellowship and
[55:16] god caused it to happen
[55:17] not one of them made it happen it was
[55:19] god that said i'm going to do this
[55:22] amen
[55:23] now yeah the squirrels god asked them
[55:24] what do you have need of now hattie
[55:26] writes boys
[55:27] their salvation wasn't based on the
[55:29] prophet decided i'm going to give you
[55:30] your voice
[55:32] you know it was actually because she
[55:34] just subconsciously just just blurted
[55:35] out that's nothing but the truth brother
[55:37] branham she couldn't help but say i
[55:38] believe that
[55:40] right and then god stepped into it so it
[55:41] wasn't them that orchestrated it was god
[55:43] that caused it to happen
[55:45] amen the tumor being spoken out of uh
[55:48] sister meter's side and we'll come to
[55:50] that a bit more soon but you know sure
[55:52] they prayed and they prayed and they
[55:53] prayed that it would be done
[55:55] and
[55:56] you know i think it's very important to
[55:57] note that the prophet took his family to
[55:59] the doctor now i mentioned on wednesday
[56:01] i touched it how god can respond in
[56:03] different ways so you know there's like
[56:05] a you know you know like the four living
[56:07] creatures around the throne so there's a
[56:08] line anointing so it's like an instant
[56:10] miracle or it can be the ox anointing
[56:12] where you've got to carry it to death
[56:14] right or it's the man anointing it's
[56:16] man's wisdom
[56:17] right so god uses medicine right god
[56:20] uses different things but god can lead
[56:22] you and then it's also a divine healing
[56:24] we hands are laid upon you anointed with
[56:26] oil and you shall recover
[56:28] so but we don't want to be in such a way
[56:30] that god you have to answer me according
[56:32] to what i think is best
[56:33] no you can have it your way jesus it's
[56:36] the reason i had brother isaac sing that
[56:37] song you know you can have your your way
[56:39] jesus so whatever way so i think it's
[56:41] important to note that that she was
[56:43] gonna get the surgery
[56:45] right she was booked in she was you know
[56:47] she saw the specialists all those
[56:48] different things so they were going that
[56:50] way
[56:51] but then the lord and his great
[56:52] sovereign grace you said speak what you
[56:54] will and it'll be done
[56:56] right so but but it wasn't the prophet
[56:57] that caused it to happen it was god that
[56:59] caused that to happen
[57:01] amen
[57:02] now
[57:03] who's who's ever heard of the um of the
[57:06] healing of uh i think it's donnie morton
[57:09] it was it was actually published in
[57:11] reader's digest now this was a boy a
[57:14] little child that that that that had a
[57:16] bad um
[57:18] uh head cancer or something he wasn't
[57:19] very good
[57:21] well we'll be running around the church
[57:22] later don't you i
[57:24] hallelujah when the spirit of lord moves
[57:25] upon my heart i dance like david dance
[57:28] glory to god
[57:29] hallelujah so here was this well i'll
[57:32] just read the account of it
[57:34] he says now now so i was talking to
[57:36] someone says that about about a prayer
[57:37] line so this father and mother got their
[57:39] child into into the meeting they they
[57:42] came all the way from winnipeg um canada
[57:44] i think this is down in california where
[57:45] it happened he said now as i was talking
[57:48] to someone there's brother brahm in the
[57:49] prayer line i happened to hear it and i
[57:51] seen that father go away and i said
[57:52] what's the matter he said he didn't have
[57:54] a prayer card then something said to me
[57:56] bring him back so i said bring him here
[57:58] and the father came up and tears running
[57:59] down his face needed shaving he walked
[58:02] up and here's the here's the readers die
[58:05] here's the reader's digest said see i
[58:07] asked no questions but looked straight
[58:09] to the face of the baby i told the baby
[58:11] where it was from it had been to mayo's
[58:13] clinic and all about what was the matter
[58:15] with it how sick it had been and
[58:16] everything and so the father started
[58:18] crying and started to leave and said he
[58:20] started off the platform and he turned
[58:22] around he said that's right sir he said
[58:24] but will my baby ever live i said
[58:27] that i can't say i said just a moment i
[58:29] seen a vision appear
[58:31] i said you won't want to believe this
[58:33] because mayos and hopkins both said that
[58:35] the operation couldn't be performed on
[58:37] that brain but i'll tell you what you do
[58:39] you tomorrow you just go ahead with this
[58:41] baby within three days you'll be going
[58:43] to meet a black-headed woman on the
[58:45] street and that woman's going to ask you
[58:46] what's the matter with the baby and when
[58:49] and then she's going to tell you of some
[58:50] little country doctor out here that can
[58:52] perform that operation and you won't
[58:54] want to believe it because mayo's turned
[58:55] it down and said it's impossible to be
[58:57] done but that's the only chance your
[58:59] baby has through the power of god the
[59:01] mercy of god and that operation well you
[59:04] think well why didn't god just heal it
[59:06] right there the power of god was there
[59:08] yeah the lord discerned what was wrong
[59:10] and what where the child had been where
[59:11] it was from why didn't it just take the
[59:13] cancer away
[59:14] god works how he wants to work
[59:16] but it's through the power of god the
[59:18] mercy of god and that operation
[59:20] see now if you believe me to be his
[59:22] prophet do as i tell you it's like
[59:23] putting the figs on hezekiah and so
[59:25] forth he said he turned around and said
[59:27] thank you walked off two or more days
[59:28] had passed he was down on the street one
[59:30] day and a lady walked up said what's the
[59:32] matter with your baby i said it's got a
[59:34] brain disease
[59:35] and he was going on talking like that
[59:37] says they thought it was awful bad you
[59:39] know and she and he said just in a few
[59:41] minute minutes something taken place she
[59:44] said sir i know someone who can do that
[59:47] operation he said lady look mayo
[59:49] brothers give it up and said it can't be
[59:50] done see the man up here was praying for
[59:52] it named brother brahman said he had a
[59:54] prayer for the baby he said wait a
[59:56] minute blackhead black-headed wearing a
[59:58] gray um coat suit said that's her said
[1:00:02] where is that doctor and she told him um
[1:00:06] they took him up there and the doctor
[1:00:07] performed the operation the baby got
[1:00:08] well
[1:00:10] see now that came through the reader's
[1:00:11] digest you see and mayo brothers called
[1:00:13] me in on an interview for he said
[1:00:15] reverend branham what did you do for
[1:00:16] that baby i said nothing i never touched
[1:00:18] it i only told what god told me to tell
[1:00:20] it the man obeyed it
[1:00:22] caesar god god works through many
[1:00:24] different avenues but we're going to be
[1:00:26] open to what if that what if that father
[1:00:28] was just disappointed but i want him
[1:00:30] healed now i don't want to have some
[1:00:31] operation he would never have got it
[1:00:34] you see so we need to be sensitive to
[1:00:36] the leading of the holy ghost we can't
[1:00:37] just put god in one box as god cannot be
[1:00:39] boxed
[1:00:40] amen
[1:00:42] hallelujah now faith is not an
[1:00:44] imagination
[1:00:46] faith is not something you work out it's
[1:00:48] not a
[1:00:49] you know it's it's something you really
[1:00:51] possess
[1:00:53] it's just as real as you coming to
[1:00:55] church today in your car
[1:00:56] in your automobiles just as real as
[1:00:58] you're sitting in the church it's just
[1:01:00] as real as you hear my voice it's a
[1:01:02] substance not an imagination not an
[1:01:04] emotion but something that you have and
[1:01:06] it comes to you by the hearing of the
[1:01:08] word of god and that only faith cometh
[1:01:10] by hearing and hearing the word of god
[1:01:12] that puts it back to where your faith is
[1:01:14] then it's not in some individual it's
[1:01:16] not in a man it's not an organization
[1:01:17] it's not a group of people it's in god
[1:01:19] because god is the word see your faith
[1:01:22] is in god now i think it's very
[1:01:24] important when we realize where faith
[1:01:26] come from but it's also very important
[1:01:28] we realize where unbelief comes from now
[1:01:30] unbelief is caused by a demon spirit
[1:01:32] anointing a person and the unbelief in
[1:01:34] that spirit goes into the person and
[1:01:36] they disbelieve the word of god but if
[1:01:39] you take the opposite of it where does
[1:01:40] faith come from the holy ghost
[1:01:42] overshadows a person and the faith that
[1:01:44] was in god that said let there be sun
[1:01:46] moon and stars and created the universe
[1:01:48] now comes into the person and they
[1:01:50] believe the word
[1:01:51] amen so if you're feeling cold and
[1:01:53] different not listening to what's going
[1:01:56] on totally your mind is somewhere else i
[1:01:57] say what is anointing you
[1:02:00] amen because because god won't make you
[1:02:02] think about tomorrow or the next day or
[1:02:04] whatever your problem is he'll get you
[1:02:05] focused on him
[1:02:08] amen so it depends who you entertain in
[1:02:10] your seat this morning i'd entertain the
[1:02:11] lord say lord
[1:02:12] faith cometh by hearing and hearing the
[1:02:14] word of god here is the lord
[1:02:16] increase my faith
[1:02:18] amen now i want to read this because
[1:02:21] we've got to realize we're here for a
[1:02:22] purpose
[1:02:24] we're here for a divine purpose
[1:02:26] now this may be a bit scrambled leg
[1:02:27] style but we're going to get somewhere
[1:02:29] so but i just want you to realize we're
[1:02:31] we need to look beyond the now
[1:02:33] we need to look beyond the circumstances
[1:02:35] of now
[1:02:36] and and brother bam says and i know my
[1:02:38] redeemer liveth he says and god
[1:02:41] did not make a tree just to see if he
[1:02:43] could make a tree he made a tree for a
[1:02:45] purpose and god did not make you and i
[1:02:47] just to see if he could do it he made us
[1:02:49] for a purpose therefore there is a
[1:02:51] purpose of all of us being here you're
[1:02:53] not here just to be another human being
[1:02:55] you're here because god made you for
[1:02:57] some purpose you're not just here to eat
[1:02:59] the food that god growed you're not just
[1:03:01] here to live in the house that man made
[1:03:03] or wear the clothing that someone
[1:03:04] fashioned you're here for a specific
[1:03:06] purpose no matter how little you are how
[1:03:09] big you are how important you are how
[1:03:11] unimportant you are you're here to serve
[1:03:12] a purpose just as my finger is here to
[1:03:15] serve a purpose my nail on my fingers
[1:03:17] for a purpose my eye
[1:03:19] every part of our bodies is to serve a
[1:03:20] purpose and it was not put here just to
[1:03:23] see if what it would look like when it
[1:03:24] was put here but it was put here to
[1:03:26] serve its purpose it was god's divine
[1:03:28] plan to do so and if we were here for
[1:03:31] some purpose now listen to this this is
[1:03:33] this should help us we should be running
[1:03:34] amen where's william
[1:03:36] release him now this is the time there
[1:03:39] is nothing that can destroy us until
[1:03:42] god's purpose is fulfilled nothing can
[1:03:44] harm us until that purpose that god has
[1:03:47] put us here for has been made manifest
[1:03:49] no matter how much trouble we have how
[1:03:51] much heartache or sorrows that we go
[1:03:53] through all of these are reasons and
[1:03:55] there's a reason for it i mean so we
[1:03:58] didn't just be put here just to be put
[1:04:00] here because we could be put here we're
[1:04:01] put here for a purpose and so if we have
[1:04:04] a divine purpose then we still
[1:04:06] that purpose still must be fulfilled if
[1:04:08] it has been fulfilled then we'll be
[1:04:10] taken home
[1:04:12] right we you're here for a purpose we're
[1:04:14] not here just to occupy time right but
[1:04:16] you're here for a divine purpose now
[1:04:18] we'll have troubles on the road
[1:04:20] but faith doesn't look at the trouble
[1:04:22] we'll have heartache on the road but
[1:04:24] faith doesn't look at the heartache amen
[1:04:26] faith looks at the promise looks at the
[1:04:28] end and so the apostle paul he went
[1:04:30] through a lot of trouble now as i said
[1:04:33] in the beginning faith does not give us
[1:04:35] a a a force field that keeps trouble
[1:04:37] away
[1:04:38] it does not it actually brings trouble
[1:04:40] close
[1:04:41] because that troubles used to develop a
[1:04:43] character actually to develop the word
[1:04:45] in your life to bring it forth amen that
[1:04:48] that we mature that we grow we become
[1:04:50] stabilized you know we say well i've
[1:04:52] i've faced this before you know lord i
[1:04:54] know you delivered me then you'll
[1:04:55] deliver me again i believe you will
[1:04:57] however you do it i don't know but yeah
[1:04:58] it gives a trust it gives a rest
[1:05:02] amen faith does maturity does now so
[1:05:05] we're here for a purpose right so now
[1:05:07] the apostle paul knew he was there for a
[1:05:09] purpose
[1:05:10] if we could just go into that ship there
[1:05:12] it wasn't a small storm it wasn't a
[1:05:14] gentle breeze gusting it was a big storm
[1:05:17] they fit
[1:05:18] they thought we're toast we're going to
[1:05:20] the bottom
[1:05:21] you know we're done we're cooked we're
[1:05:23] throwing everything overboard we can
[1:05:25] we've done everything we can but the
[1:05:26] apostle paul's in his cabin i don't know
[1:05:28] maybe he was holding on and you know as
[1:05:30] as the boat's pitching and rolling but
[1:05:32] he was in contact with god
[1:05:35] because he said lord you told me before
[1:05:37] this is not my end this storm is not my
[1:05:40] end this trouble is not my end this boat
[1:05:42] is not my end i'm getting off this ship
[1:05:44] i mean because you said i'm going to be
[1:05:46] a witness in rome you said amen i'm
[1:05:48] going to be a witness there i'm not in
[1:05:50] rome yet so therefore this ship i can't
[1:05:52] go down with the ship i mean so he
[1:05:54] looked beyond his circumstances and he
[1:05:57] looked to where he was going to end up
[1:05:58] now we've got to be to have the same
[1:06:00] kind of eyes of faith i mean we may be
[1:06:02] in a storm pitching rolling trouble on
[1:06:04] every hand trouble in the family trouble
[1:06:06] with finances trouble in relationships
[1:06:08] whatever it is they say lord this is not
[1:06:11] the end
[1:06:12] you said i'm going in a rapture your
[1:06:14] word says my family's coming with me you
[1:06:16] said every divine promise is mine this
[1:06:18] is not the end of my journey lord i
[1:06:20] don't believe it is lord jesus you're
[1:06:22] going to take me through
[1:06:24] hallelujah we should that yo that's how
[1:06:26] we should believe shouldn't we
[1:06:28] and if the lord takes us home obviously
[1:06:30] it's our time
[1:06:32] and we can rest well we've done our
[1:06:34] course
[1:06:35] so we can't lose either way
[1:06:37] hallelujah but you know you've got to
[1:06:39] look beyond i was looking at the um
[1:06:41] maybe i'll bring it out and you know in
[1:06:42] the future but you know what season lady
[1:06:44] ocean
[1:06:45] uh it says that you're poor richard
[1:06:47] miserable blind and naked
[1:06:49] and that blindness is actually linked
[1:06:50] with pride
[1:06:52] so the reason this world can't see
[1:06:54] beyond the now is pride
[1:06:56] and i say the problem is many believers
[1:06:58] can't look beyond the now because of
[1:07:00] pride pride manifests in many different
[1:07:02] ways having a pity party can be pride
[1:07:04] it's all about me
[1:07:06] you know worshiping trouble worshiping
[1:07:08] self you know that's that actually
[1:07:10] caused the blindness to come on
[1:07:12] we don't want to be a proud people want
[1:07:14] to be a humble people
[1:07:16] you can have it your way jesus
[1:07:18] whatever's going on my life fall apart
[1:07:20] lord you can have it your way
[1:07:22] hallelujah because we need to come to a
[1:07:25] place where we recognize that that how
[1:07:27] our life is going perceived by us isn't
[1:07:29] but does not is not a reflection of
[1:07:31] god's approval
[1:07:34] he says
[1:07:35] the cloudy skies and storms of life are
[1:07:38] no sign of god's disapproval neither are
[1:07:40] the bright skies and still water signs
[1:07:43] of his love and approval
[1:07:45] oh but i thought you know if i give my
[1:07:46] life to him everything will go well no
[1:07:48] this is not how this works you know even
[1:07:51] even i think paul and um like i remember
[1:07:53] who was with him was telling the
[1:07:54] thessalonians you know these
[1:07:56] thessalonians just been birthed into the
[1:07:57] kingdom and they began to preach them
[1:07:59] through great you know great tribulation
[1:08:01] you enter into the kingdom of god you
[1:08:03] didn't sign up for a picnic here boys
[1:08:05] you're here for a battle you're here you
[1:08:07] have a rugged faith god's going to prove
[1:08:09] what's in you what he's put in you by
[1:08:10] the baptism of the holy ghost
[1:08:12] amen yo yo and we're the same way it's a
[1:08:15] great tribulation we're going to enter
[1:08:16] into the kingdom of god
[1:08:19] hallelujah you know if we could if we
[1:08:21] only saw out our time upon the earth i
[1:08:24] doubt any of us would sign up for this
[1:08:27] but to get it comes past the curtain of
[1:08:29] time yet say lord i don't want to bypass
[1:08:31] any of it
[1:08:32] even i think the prophet was asked one
[1:08:34] time he saw a trouble come out and god
[1:08:35] said do you want to bypass that he says
[1:08:38] no lord i'll surrender i'll go through
[1:08:39] it
[1:08:41] so may the lord give us grace that that
[1:08:43] wherever he leads us we'll say lord here
[1:08:46] i am reporting for judy i love you lead
[1:08:49] me through
[1:08:50] hallelujah
[1:08:52] amen his approval
[1:08:55] of any of us is only in the beloved his
[1:08:57] love is elective which he had for us
[1:08:59] before the foundation of the world does
[1:09:01] he love us oh yes
[1:09:03] how shall we know we shall know because
[1:09:05] he said so
[1:09:07] and manna and manifested that he did
[1:09:09] love us for he brought us to himself and
[1:09:12] gave us of his spirit placing us as sons
[1:09:15] how do you know he loves me he told me
[1:09:17] and didn't just tell me he brought me to
[1:09:19] himself
[1:09:20] amen and then you manifested it by
[1:09:22] bringing it bringing me to himself
[1:09:24] that's how i know jesus loves me because
[1:09:25] he revealed himself to me he called me i
[1:09:28] had to surrender to the call but there
[1:09:30] was a time i said lord i'm coming
[1:09:32] i don't care what my friends say i don't
[1:09:33] care about all that you know peer
[1:09:35] pressure is a real thing and it held me
[1:09:37] back for a couple of years because i'm
[1:09:38] afraid to lose my friends but then the
[1:09:40] lord just keeps calling
[1:09:42] and you just get so sick of this being
[1:09:44] up and down and enough religion to make
[1:09:46] you miserable say lord here i am
[1:09:48] hallelujah i think that's you god god's
[1:09:51] grace brings us to that place
[1:09:53] praise the lord what about my best
[1:09:54] friend or bffs whatever don't worry
[1:09:56] about them if you want to help them
[1:09:58] serve god and god will get a hold of
[1:10:00] them
[1:10:01] you know that's how we should believe
[1:10:02] for it amen so he said so and he
[1:10:05] manifested that he loved us because he
[1:10:07] brought us to himself so you know we
[1:10:09] should never have a question does god
[1:10:10] love me
[1:10:11] have you been gathered to him
[1:10:13] have you been brought to him
[1:10:15] hallelujah well then he loves you he
[1:10:16] said so but he proved it he called you
[1:10:18] by his grace
[1:10:20] amen
[1:10:21] you know we should just let off the
[1:10:23] pressure
[1:10:24] i've got so many burdens no the problem
[1:10:26] is people get so burdened down with
[1:10:28] things they can't enjoy god is because
[1:10:30] they're holding on to the burdens we
[1:10:31] should give them to him cast your cares
[1:10:33] upon him because he cares for you oh but
[1:10:35] what about this and this and this don't
[1:10:37] cast him upon him
[1:10:38] i mean we shouldn't be all crippled down
[1:10:40] and we can't even rejoice and be happy
[1:10:42] no more we can't let god touch us
[1:10:43] because we're holding on to our burdens
[1:10:45] you know who's ever carried enough stuff
[1:10:47] they can't see where they're going
[1:10:49] you know that's like that with burdens
[1:10:50] and trouble you know god wants to say yo
[1:10:52] he's there just pass them in but you're
[1:10:54] carrying them like this you can't see
[1:10:56] where you're going and you know there's
[1:10:57] a step but you you start stumbling
[1:10:59] around and
[1:11:00] put them down
[1:11:02] give them to him
[1:11:03] he's the one who sorts it out he's the
[1:11:05] he's the burden sort of router
[1:11:07] that's his new job title yeah he'll take
[1:11:08] care of you but you got to give it to
[1:11:10] him
[1:11:11] and not just say but then hold on to it
[1:11:13] you know it's like sometimes you pass it
[1:11:15] pass something to someone and they don't
[1:11:16] let go he's like give it to me
[1:11:19] who's ever had that you know pass it
[1:11:21] here give it here like little child you
[1:11:23] know give me that they got to give it to
[1:11:24] you but they're still holding on and you
[1:11:26] gotta like
[1:11:27] you know william there's like a spoon
[1:11:29] give it here it goes here you gotta kind
[1:11:30] of twist his arm and there we go thank
[1:11:32] you very much for passing that to me
[1:11:35] yeah but that's how we are with god
[1:11:38] lord i got these problems i know
[1:11:41] lord don't you care i do give them here
[1:11:43] give them to me oh but lord don't you
[1:11:45] understand i do understand i went
[1:11:46] through it myself i i'm in humanity i
[1:11:48] was in humanity like you are i know it's
[1:11:50] like this suffer loss and hardship and
[1:11:52] heart i can be misunderstood and
[1:11:54] rejected and despised and i understand
[1:11:56] it more than you do
[1:12:00] you know so someone looks at you funny
[1:12:02] and you feel so like cut off from the
[1:12:03] world and you think you're the you know
[1:12:05] but then the lord jesus the whole world
[1:12:07] he died of a broken heart
[1:12:10] i don't mean this to be ridiculous but
[1:12:12] who's i don't see anyone in this room
[1:12:13] who suffered that
[1:12:15] because no one's died here
[1:12:16] let alone have a broken heart but you
[1:12:18] see you know he
[1:12:19] yeah we think the devil tries against i
[1:12:21] think no one understands us no one cares
[1:12:23] but you got to give it to him you're
[1:12:24] going to give it to the lord
[1:12:25] see he see the devil basically what he
[1:12:27] does but by that he's but trying to tie
[1:12:30] your burdens or your trouble your pain
[1:12:32] to you
[1:12:34] so you can't let go of it no no the lord
[1:12:36] cares but you've got to cast your keys
[1:12:37] upon him does he love me yes he told me
[1:12:40] what is this message sent to do it's
[1:12:42] actually meant to tell you jesus loves
[1:12:43] you
[1:12:44] that was the reason malachi 4 came i
[1:12:46] love you with an unfailing love i've
[1:12:49] come to redeem you i'm going to carry
[1:12:50] you away i'm going to take i've already
[1:12:52] taken your sins away that down calvary
[1:12:53] but you're going to receive it by faith
[1:12:55] but i have come to prepare you because
[1:12:56] you've got a place at the wedding supper
[1:12:58] table that's why this message came
[1:13:01] amen so oh does he love us yes of course
[1:13:03] he loves us he sent this message your
[1:13:05] way he sent himself
[1:13:07] more than god sent a prophet no god says
[1:13:09] this is a god-sized job mighty angel
[1:13:11] descends christ himself in angelic form
[1:13:14] want to gather you to himself to carry
[1:13:16] you far away
[1:13:18] hallelujah why because that mighty angel
[1:13:20] is the anointing of the holy ghost in
[1:13:21] the end time
[1:13:22] hallelujah with that open book in your
[1:13:24] life you'll manifest every promise and
[1:13:27] the last great one of those promises the
[1:13:28] change of the body
[1:13:31] amen and then so sometimes we struggle
[1:13:33] does he love us you know the devil comes
[1:13:34] along says he doesn't love you
[1:13:36] and as i've said before it's the devil
[1:13:38] trying to put his experience on you
[1:13:41] the devil knows nothing of god's love
[1:13:42] because he's just a servant
[1:13:44] all he is is a servant he's just someone
[1:13:46] hired basically he's not part of the
[1:13:47] family you know god's love and affection
[1:13:50] and care and you know compassion and
[1:13:52] worry concern was never upon him
[1:13:54] he got fired
[1:13:56] right he's still kicking it he's still
[1:13:57] upset about that
[1:13:59] you know but he got fired
[1:14:01] right he's under our feet
[1:14:03] i mean so why why on earth should we
[1:14:05] listen to a fired servant no no he got
[1:14:07] fired
[1:14:08] you just got to call security the the
[1:14:10] holy ghost i mean to kick him off the
[1:14:13] premises
[1:14:14] you can even say devil i'll escort you
[1:14:16] off the premises
[1:14:17] hallelujah
[1:14:19] amen
[1:14:21] so
[1:14:22] he said so and now and how do i prove my
[1:14:25] love to him
[1:14:27] who wants to know that
[1:14:29] everyone's interested i'm sure by
[1:14:30] believing what he said
[1:14:32] and by conducting myself with joy amidst
[1:14:35] the trials that he and his wisdom allows
[1:14:38] to come to pass
[1:14:39] so yes we believe what he said but now
[1:14:41] we've got to actually conduct ourselves
[1:14:43] with joy
[1:14:46] well how
[1:14:47] that's not humanly possible well i know
[1:14:49] two brothers that were in prison
[1:14:52] they preached the mighty service but by
[1:14:54] the end of that they weren't escorted to
[1:14:55] their nice hotel room and you know no no
[1:14:57] no god said no i've got a different
[1:14:59] hotel room for you tonight because
[1:15:00] there's a predestined seat in that
[1:15:02] prison house so sometimes the lord will
[1:15:04] put us in a put us in a trial and a
[1:15:06] hardship and we feel like we're in a
[1:15:08] prison house but that's because someone
[1:15:10] else is in that same kind of state but
[1:15:11] they need to know him and the reason is
[1:15:13] you get into that is because it's
[1:15:14] someone that you can actually get a hold
[1:15:16] of and that you wouldn't ordinarily get
[1:15:18] a hold of just like paul and silas i
[1:15:21] don't read in the bible where they
[1:15:22] actually took a tour of prisons
[1:15:24] unless they were actually escorted to
[1:15:26] that tour by soldiers
[1:15:29] right but they would never have gone
[1:15:30] near the philippine jailer unless they
[1:15:32] got thrown into that prison
[1:15:34] and sometimes we get thrown into things
[1:15:36] because there's someone in that that's
[1:15:38] associated with that trial that needs to
[1:15:40] be free
[1:15:41] amen so so paul and saw us they could
[1:15:43] have sat there feeling sorry for
[1:15:44] themselves
[1:15:46] poor me why this happened lord but
[1:15:48] you're the great jehovah of miracles
[1:15:50] you're the almighty god that part of the
[1:15:52] red sea and did all incredible things
[1:15:53] and they could have shared testimony
[1:15:55] after testimony of what he did in their
[1:15:56] lives and felt sorry but no they said
[1:16:00] silas yes paul
[1:16:02] hallelujah
[1:16:04] we know he loves us because he said so
[1:16:07] we know he loved us because he called us
[1:16:09] you know as a pharisee of the pharisees
[1:16:11] i was dead against what i'm doing right
[1:16:13] now but he called us amen he's shown us
[1:16:16] love hallelujah and you know what silas
[1:16:18] what paul that this joy that i have
[1:16:22] the world didn't give it to me the
[1:16:24] salvation i didn't learn about the
[1:16:26] salvation at gamalie's feet i didn't
[1:16:28] learn this i didn't receive the holy
[1:16:30] ghost that was with moses it was now and
[1:16:32] me i didn't receive it by learning and
[1:16:34] being a pharisee god gave it to me
[1:16:37] hallelujah they begin to sing and they
[1:16:39] begin to shout they begin to testify so
[1:16:41] amen even in that hardship and that
[1:16:43] trial they conducted themselves with joy
[1:16:47] hallelujah
[1:16:49] now was that a learned behavior
[1:16:50] absolutely not
[1:16:52] because learned behavior doesn't bring
[1:16:53] god on the scene it's good to have
[1:16:54] learned behavior but you gotta let god
[1:16:55] anoint that loom behavior it's gotta be
[1:16:57] from your heart it should be burning
[1:16:58] from your heart i mean salvation should
[1:17:00] be burning from your heart amen this is
[1:17:02] how we should be like jeremiah said one
[1:17:04] day i'm not going to preach anymore but
[1:17:06] he couldn't but he had to open his mouth
[1:17:07] because he's like fire shut up in his
[1:17:09] bones i mean so what you know al this
[1:17:11] message should be burning on our hearts
[1:17:14] jesus lives the tomb is empty not
[1:17:16] because it's just empty because he
[1:17:18] resurrected out of that tomb i mean he's
[1:17:20] alive forevermore this bible lives amen
[1:17:22] he's the same god today he can save
[1:17:24] anyone he wants to do anything he wants
[1:17:26] to there's no case too hard for god it
[1:17:29] should be burning hallelujah god can
[1:17:31] help anyone any situation any state
[1:17:34] amen he saved me how do you get it
[1:17:36] burning just think about what he's done
[1:17:37] for you
[1:17:38] if he's done if he's just called you
[1:17:40] that's incredible thing because it's not
[1:17:42] naturally within man amen to seek after
[1:17:44] god god put it in you come to me my
[1:17:46] child i'll give you eternal life that's
[1:17:48] god given that's enough to tear up the
[1:17:50] whole world
[1:17:51] [Applause]
[1:17:52] hallelujah that's why brother ram said
[1:17:54] if you don't know what to say just say
[1:17:55] how your candle got lit
[1:17:57] i mean because that will produce a real
[1:17:59] heartfelt witness and because man is
[1:18:02] looking for something real they're not
[1:18:04] looking for something learned they're
[1:18:05] looking at something real
[1:18:07] not on here but in here
[1:18:09] hallelujah when you begin to witness
[1:18:11] someone maybe you feel led to say about
[1:18:12] the seals it's bursting from your heart
[1:18:14] or the church as it's bursting from your
[1:18:15] heart it's not a learned thing and
[1:18:17] something just comes out
[1:18:19] hallelujah about all about malachi 4 any
[1:18:21] promise of today it's not in here it
[1:18:23] comes out here it's not oh i should say
[1:18:25] this now and this no no it just comes
[1:18:27] out
[1:18:28] amen should be fire shut up in our bones
[1:18:32] hallelujah but the devil doesn't want
[1:18:33] that fire
[1:18:35] he fights that fire brother said all
[1:18:37] hell is against this revelation what
[1:18:39] christ and the people once again the
[1:18:41] word put on flesh
[1:18:42] amen but you see we can conduct
[1:18:45] ourselves with joy
[1:18:47] in the midst of the trial
[1:18:49] hallelujah
[1:18:51] well
[1:18:51] a big part of that is don't lean on how
[1:18:53] you're feeling
[1:18:55] you know it says in psalms 27 maybe
[1:18:57] we'll just read that actually i wasn't
[1:18:58] gonna
[1:19:00] you know these things i just think i'll
[1:19:02] i'll bring that out next time but
[1:19:04] i guess you know what's the saying about
[1:19:06] how people say i'll do it tomorrow
[1:19:08] but the answer is well today was
[1:19:10] yesterday's tomorrow
[1:19:13] you know so
[1:19:15] yep
[1:19:16] now psalm 27
[1:19:20] this is the condition of of of of people
[1:19:22] who are ready for the rapture brother
[1:19:24] brown preach this text this is his
[1:19:26] opening scripture psalm 27 we'll start
[1:19:28] from verse one
[1:19:30] and um and so he didn't go to first
[1:19:32] thessalonians four as the background for
[1:19:34] the rapture he went here showing this is
[1:19:36] the state that we would be in when we're
[1:19:38] rapture ready
[1:19:40] amen he says now the lord is my light
[1:19:42] and my salvation
[1:19:44] whom shall i fear
[1:19:45] the lord is the strength of my life of
[1:19:47] whom shall i be afraid now this should
[1:19:49] be revelation
[1:19:50] right not just nice scripture but no he
[1:19:52] is the strength of my here's my light
[1:19:54] and my salvation the reason i can see is
[1:19:56] god i mean my salvation is of the lord i
[1:20:00] mean it wasn't something i did it wasn't
[1:20:01] just the church i go to no god save me
[1:20:04] god called me he lightened up my path
[1:20:05] that i can see
[1:20:07] i mean that this world's falling apart
[1:20:08] but i'm not falling apart
[1:20:10] i'm just continuing on loving the lord
[1:20:13] hallelujah whom shall i fear
[1:20:16] well no one is the answer the lord is
[1:20:18] the strength of my life of whom shall i
[1:20:20] be afraid
[1:20:21] it's amazing how fear comes in this is
[1:20:23] this is the condition that people will
[1:20:24] be because he's why why is he saying
[1:20:26] about fear and being afraid because
[1:20:27] there's a fearful time
[1:20:29] this is a fearful time but we are not
[1:20:31] ordained a man to live under that fear
[1:20:35] there's no fear in this world that is
[1:20:37] actually meant to be our portion
[1:20:39] amen we are here not to be afraid but to
[1:20:42] be fearless why because our god is god
[1:20:45] he's the king of glory he'll look after
[1:20:46] you has he looked after you this far
[1:20:49] he'll look after you the rest of the way
[1:20:51] amen so we are anointed you know what i
[1:20:53] love brother graham says about the um
[1:20:55] we'll come here but you know brother
[1:20:57] bram says about the you know four
[1:20:58] anointings down through the church ages
[1:21:00] we know we're under the eagle anointing
[1:21:02] but he'd speak about the martyrs and the
[1:21:03] oxides different things he said they
[1:21:05] were anointed that way that's all they
[1:21:07] could do
[1:21:08] they were they lived by that anointing
[1:21:09] they couldn't help but just give
[1:21:11] themselves as a living sacrifice
[1:21:13] amen so they lived under that anointing
[1:21:15] and that's all they could do and under
[1:21:17] the man age anointing the same way so
[1:21:19] now the anointing in the age will make
[1:21:21] the people live a certain way they can't
[1:21:23] help it i mean so the bride is under an
[1:21:25] eagle anointing we can't help but see
[1:21:28] what we see we can look above politics
[1:21:31] look above what's going on in the world
[1:21:32] look above economics we can look above
[1:21:34] all those things because we're anointed
[1:21:36] aiming to look through what the word
[1:21:38] says about us and what the word says
[1:21:40] about this time and we can walk fearless
[1:21:44] hallelujah
[1:21:45] he says they couldn't help but live that
[1:21:48] give their lives because that's what the
[1:21:49] anointing they were under that's the
[1:21:51] same thing with you and i
[1:21:53] hallelujah amen when the wicked
[1:21:57] even my enemies and my foes came upon me
[1:21:59] to eat up my flesh
[1:22:01] they stumbled and fell
[1:22:03] no
[1:22:03] you know the you know the real enemy we
[1:22:05] have you know the devil is actually not
[1:22:07] our main enemy
[1:22:09] he's been defeated
[1:22:11] right he's been he's been conquered but
[1:22:13] the guy that is your biggest enemy is
[1:22:15] the person you look in the mirror at
[1:22:17] and that's not your spouse when they're
[1:22:18] standing next to you it's you
[1:22:20] it's you
[1:22:21] right it's you it's not the guy next to
[1:22:23] you or the woman it's it's you
[1:22:25] brother ham said the biggest enemy i
[1:22:26] have is william branham if i can get him
[1:22:29] out of the way god can do things that
[1:22:30] william brown knows nothing about amen
[1:22:33] so to me when it speaks about when my
[1:22:34] enemies come against me sure we can say
[1:22:36] that's the devil because he's our enemy
[1:22:38] there was a time he came against us we
[1:22:40] stumbled and fell in sin
[1:22:42] he was our task master he was a he's a
[1:22:44] horrible task master he'll make you
[1:22:45] think that it's actually good to serve
[1:22:47] him he's a liar
[1:22:48] but then there came a point where where
[1:22:50] god took that slave mentality off us
[1:22:52] revealed to us that we are sons and
[1:22:54] daughters of god and the devil's under
[1:22:56] our feet then that same devil comes back
[1:22:58] but then the results are very different
[1:23:01] he is expecting this will be easy just
[1:23:02] like shamga yeah the philistines come
[1:23:05] along well we're just going to get his
[1:23:06] crop again that's what happened last
[1:23:07] year this will happen this year it's
[1:23:08] amazing he's you know you know they they
[1:23:11] sent 600 soldiers to one farmer
[1:23:13] but the devil knows what's in you
[1:23:15] just like the philistines really i think
[1:23:17] subconsciously they knew what was in
[1:23:19] though shamgar didn't know what was in
[1:23:21] him until finally there was enough boot
[1:23:23] steps stomping up the road
[1:23:25] and it actually activated a faith within
[1:23:27] him when he looked at the looked at the
[1:23:29] state of his family and how they're all
[1:23:31] skinny and you know their clothes were
[1:23:33] ragged and now they're going to face
[1:23:34] another winter and you know the
[1:23:35] philistines going to take you know all
[1:23:37] the crops you know what i like about a
[1:23:38] true son or daughter of god
[1:23:41] the trial they're in lifts faith into
[1:23:43] them actually activates their faith in a
[1:23:45] great way it brings god when the enemy
[1:23:47] comes in like a flood i'll raise up a
[1:23:49] standard that's god's anointed word in
[1:23:51] you
[1:23:52] hallelujah so they're stomping up the
[1:23:54] road and then he begins to realize
[1:23:56] i'm a circumcised son of abraham i'm
[1:24:00] living in my inheritance amen and and
[1:24:03] and my god told my forefathers one will
[1:24:06] chase a thousand kill chase ten thousand
[1:24:09] now he did not stop and say now fellas
[1:24:11] for philistines can you number off
[1:24:14] you're like some kids going you know on
[1:24:15] a class trip number one no no no he he
[1:24:18] just took his ox code brother i said he
[1:24:20] jumped out the window and he killed one
[1:24:22] after another after another i mean that
[1:24:25] was a different season because he
[1:24:27] realized what he already was he did not
[1:24:30] become a circumcised son of abraham when
[1:24:33] he realized it he already was that was
[1:24:35] by his birth amen and by our new birth
[1:24:38] we need to realize we're sons and
[1:24:40] daughters of the king i mean so so
[1:24:43] there's a time that devil came against
[1:24:44] you you stumbled and fell
[1:24:46] but then just like shamgar when he
[1:24:47] realized who he was
[1:24:49] then those enemies laid dead at your
[1:24:51] feet
[1:24:52] hallelujah
[1:24:53] amen but there's another set of enemies
[1:24:55] that we have which are our five senses
[1:24:58] which is our emotional realm as well
[1:25:00] that is the enemies of faith
[1:25:03] what we see can be an enemy
[1:25:05] right what we see remember we don't look
[1:25:08] to what we see we look to the promise of
[1:25:10] god
[1:25:11] just like um i think it was one of the
[1:25:13] bother bosworth brothers their son was
[1:25:16] actually dying in hospital
[1:25:18] and you know you know his his vital
[1:25:20] signs got so low you know no one had
[1:25:22] actually come back from that point and
[1:25:24] they called brother brown men to come
[1:25:26] pray for him and brother and prays for
[1:25:28] the boy and then and then and then the
[1:25:30] mum and dad yo
[1:25:31] brother bob's worth one of them because
[1:25:33] he was two bosses with brothers said to
[1:25:35] his wife you know this is so wonderful
[1:25:37] our son's gonna live in there and
[1:25:38] they're both hugging each other and
[1:25:40] crying and rejoicing and praising lord
[1:25:42] and then the nurse is just like what's
[1:25:44] got what
[1:25:46] and and she's just kind of shocked like
[1:25:48] what's wrong with these what's wrong
[1:25:49] with these parents
[1:25:51] and then and then he says to her i mean
[1:25:54] she says to him rather
[1:25:55] um
[1:25:56] excuse me
[1:25:58] you know your son's dying you shouldn't
[1:25:59] be acting this way you know look at his
[1:26:02] vital signs his heart rate and pressure
[1:26:04] all those things no one ever has come
[1:26:06] back
[1:26:07] past this before
[1:26:08] and you know he just said to her you
[1:26:10] know look you're looking at what your
[1:26:11] instruments tell you and that's
[1:26:13] perfectly fine
[1:26:14] because they're good things but we're
[1:26:15] looking beyond that to the promise of
[1:26:17] god and they said you know his prayers
[1:26:19] have never failed once and what happened
[1:26:21] the boy was healthy well and strong
[1:26:23] married
[1:26:24] had kids you know because she was
[1:26:26] looking by what she saw
[1:26:28] they were looking beyond what they saw
[1:26:30] to faith
[1:26:31] by faith to the promise
[1:26:33] i mean so so what we see can be an enemy
[1:26:36] what we feel can be a big enemy
[1:26:39] it can be a big enemy you know feelings
[1:26:42] can shut down deliverance
[1:26:45] it can it can actually shut down god
[1:26:47] working with us
[1:26:48] you know
[1:26:49] it's amazing how
[1:26:51] um
[1:26:52] especially men
[1:26:54] you know their wives or their or their
[1:26:56] or their girlfriends before they get
[1:26:57] married you know they can start having a
[1:26:59] conversation and the conversation get
[1:27:01] quite emotional
[1:27:02] and then for some reason the men think
[1:27:04] it's just it's just their wife or their
[1:27:06] girlfriend manipulating them with
[1:27:07] emotion because they get emotional about
[1:27:10] talking about certain things and they
[1:27:11] just shut down the whole conversation
[1:27:13] now let me ask you a question
[1:27:16] what was she doing when when she looked
[1:27:18] into your eyes with tears of love saying
[1:27:19] i love you
[1:27:21] was that emotional manipulation
[1:27:23] no
[1:27:24] that was genuine love brothers also amen
[1:27:28] sisters they have been too you know you
[1:27:30] see it wasn't a manipulation to try and
[1:27:32] get you to think and do a certain thing
[1:27:34] no but the thing is people thinkers
[1:27:36] especially men i'll say this we get very
[1:27:38] uncomfortable talking about emotional
[1:27:40] things things that you know we get
[1:27:42] uncomfortable when when emotion comes
[1:27:44] into a conversation sometimes and the
[1:27:46] main reason is that is because we get
[1:27:48] uncomfortable talking about it because
[1:27:50] quite often it's us that need to change
[1:27:52] and we're not willing to talk about what
[1:27:53] we need to do
[1:27:55] brother say amen i'll say amen on behalf
[1:27:57] of every man in this church amen
[1:28:02] and then so what people say is no woman
[1:28:03] you're skiing emotional and they shut
[1:28:05] down the conversation but what is
[1:28:07] actually on its road is was deliverance
[1:28:10] of something
[1:28:12] so we can't just shut down things
[1:28:14] because oh it's emotional manipulation
[1:28:17] no no no no don't
[1:28:18] don't go yo
[1:28:20] our walk is not an emotionless walk
[1:28:23] a marriage without emotion is dead
[1:28:26] there's serious trouble there
[1:28:28] so you know we are built with emotion
[1:28:32] this should not be shocking to anyone
[1:28:34] you know we are emotional creatures
[1:28:37] if you actually shut down your emotions
[1:28:39] it's actually the devil disabling part
[1:28:41] of you
[1:28:43] oh but this is no but but but we just
[1:28:45] walk by the word brother yeah yeah we do
[1:28:48] but god never sent this message to shut
[1:28:50] us down emotionally
[1:28:53] right
[1:28:53] so we can't
[1:28:55] you know
[1:28:57] so that can many times be because i
[1:29:00] found christie and i have had serious
[1:29:02] conversations and the more uncomfortable
[1:29:04] i feel the more healing and you know the
[1:29:06] more deliverances brought
[1:29:08] he said i'm not enjoying this but it's
[1:29:10] good for me
[1:29:11] you know so
[1:29:13] we can't just say no no shut that down
[1:29:15] you know that's not right you're just
[1:29:17] manipulating me no no it's not that way
[1:29:20] amen now no one expected that just then
[1:29:22] but there it is you've got to be willing
[1:29:25] if you're uncomfortable talk about it
[1:29:27] until it's seen through don't just no no
[1:29:29] no no it's not manipulation you know i
[1:29:32] actually think you know the person you
[1:29:34] you marry 100 of the time wants the best
[1:29:37] for you
[1:29:39] i think they actually have your
[1:29:41] emotional physical spiritual welfare
[1:29:44] enviro uh you know in mind normally
[1:29:47] yeah no is that a shock you know is that
[1:29:50] is that is that um controversial it
[1:29:52] shouldn't be
[1:29:54] so you can't just say oh that's
[1:29:55] manipulated no it's not actually because
[1:29:57] there's things in us that need to be
[1:29:58] dealt with
[1:29:59] things from our upbringing from our
[1:30:01] nature from our culture things that are
[1:30:03] contrary to the word of god they need to
[1:30:04] come out
[1:30:06] oh yes
[1:30:07] and
[1:30:08] how do they come out i just you know i
[1:30:10] just need to hear that preach no no
[1:30:12] fellowship
[1:30:13] is all part of it talking one-on-one
[1:30:16] being vulnerable
[1:30:17] in
[1:30:18] conversation with your spouse
[1:30:21] amen
[1:30:24] so
[1:30:25] so feelings
[1:30:26] can beat us down that way they can be
[1:30:28] our enemy
[1:30:29] to shut down
[1:30:31] or
[1:30:31] they can beat us down the other way by
[1:30:34] we feel on cloud nine
[1:30:37] we're actually ready
[1:30:39] lord today's the day i'm ready lord
[1:30:41] hallelujah the morning went well the
[1:30:44] miracle of miracles the kids got out the
[1:30:46] door at the right time there's no
[1:30:48] squabbles not world war three you know
[1:30:50] everything was fine there was harmony in
[1:30:51] the house everything
[1:30:53] we're ready lord
[1:30:54] we're ready
[1:30:55] because you feel good right and then
[1:30:59] the next day
[1:31:00] it's like polar opposite
[1:31:03] you know you're just thankful blood
[1:31:04] wasn't shed
[1:31:06] you know by the time the school
[1:31:07] drop-off's done you're just thankful
[1:31:09] that you got through and lord what's
[1:31:11] wrong with me yesterday i felt so happy
[1:31:13] and so rejoicing in you and no what's
[1:31:15] happening is you're riding on emotion
[1:31:19] remember god gave us emotion but we
[1:31:20] shouldn't be led by emotion
[1:31:23] faith is not emotion
[1:31:25] sure emotion comes with faith right but
[1:31:28] faith is not emotion
[1:31:29] so so the devil can use our emotions
[1:31:32] against us
[1:31:33] amen
[1:31:35] and you know anyone with half a half a
[1:31:38] pulse
[1:31:39] knows what it's like to be led by
[1:31:41] emotion the wrong way that's why you've
[1:31:42] got to subject everything to the word of
[1:31:44] god
[1:31:45] amen and we'll come to that probably
[1:31:47] another time but
[1:31:48] you know so these five senses can be our
[1:31:51] enemy and we can stumble and fall
[1:31:53] against them
[1:31:54] our emotional realm can be our enemy
[1:31:57] but faith looks beyond it
[1:31:59] you know the apostle paul in that storm
[1:32:03] no doubt there would have been a real
[1:32:04] you know you know the devil puts fear
[1:32:06] upon us who's experienced that
[1:32:09] he puts real fear on us we
[1:32:11] christine and i were down in
[1:32:12] christchurch when the first earthquake
[1:32:14] struck there's a few years ago now there
[1:32:16] you know some so we lived in a little
[1:32:18] one-bedroom mezzanine apartment
[1:32:20] and and we lived down a quiet street but
[1:32:22] but before the earthquake struck as you
[1:32:24] people all know you know sometimes you
[1:32:26] hear a noise before it shakes and it was
[1:32:28] like a freight train was coming right
[1:32:30] through our place and in the place of
[1:32:31] finally up and down it wasn't just a
[1:32:33] gentle somehow we got down to our front
[1:32:35] door we started praying
[1:32:37] and you know all within me wanted to
[1:32:39] open my eyes and look around
[1:32:42] because it was you know but i said no
[1:32:44] i'm not going to look i'm going to pray
[1:32:46] because my help cometh from the lord my
[1:32:48] help is not going to come by observing
[1:32:49] the building
[1:32:51] right and god came down
[1:32:53] and we had one of the greatest prayer
[1:32:54] meetings we ever had
[1:32:56] right in that moment
[1:32:58] amen we had another time the first house
[1:33:00] we're here in freckleton grove there was
[1:33:02] a there was a demon spirit in the house
[1:33:04] and the first one of the first times we
[1:33:05] prayed against that there was a real
[1:33:07] fear came on me when i was praying and i
[1:33:09] didn't accept that fear i said satan how
[1:33:11] did you try and put your fear upon me
[1:33:13] and you know and and then after we
[1:33:16] prayed christine said oh you felt that
[1:33:17] too but you know sometimes we get oh i'm
[1:33:19] scared like it's yours it's not yours
[1:33:21] the fear is not yours it's the devil's
[1:33:23] fear but he tries to put it on you to
[1:33:25] try and your faith to pull you
[1:33:26] back say no i may feel this but i don't
[1:33:29] accept it
[1:33:30] i accept the promise
[1:33:33] amen so we're going to go beyond how we
[1:33:35] feel
[1:33:36] right but faith brings feelings right
[1:33:38] because anything without emotion is dead
[1:33:40] you bury it
[1:33:42] amen so faith brings love
[1:33:45] faith brings joy
[1:33:46] revelation revelation brings love
[1:33:48] revelation brings joy revelation brings
[1:33:50] peace you feel peaceful
[1:33:52] right
[1:33:53] amen you feel those things but you see
[1:33:56] faith is not based on those things but
[1:33:58] it brings those things
[1:34:00] amen so he says here about divine
[1:34:02] healing divine healing
[1:34:05] is not based on some emotion it's not
[1:34:07] based upon laying on of hands or some
[1:34:10] feeling or strange feeling or sensation
[1:34:13] it's based upon a faith in a work that
[1:34:15] was done for you by jesus christ at
[1:34:17] calvary it's a finished product see you
[1:34:19] may come and get hands laid upon you you
[1:34:21] may get oil be anointed with oil because
[1:34:23] that's according to the word but your
[1:34:25] faith is actually in it's done
[1:34:28] right
[1:34:29] i mean just like you know we can have
[1:34:30] such a great time at a camp but you know
[1:34:32] our faith shouldn't just be based on the
[1:34:33] emotional high of a camp it's got to go
[1:34:36] beyond that that that after you leave
[1:34:37] that atmosphere that atmosphere goes
[1:34:39] with you
[1:34:40] in your everyday life right you
[1:34:42] your faith is greater than the feeling
[1:34:45] amen
[1:34:46] now real faith
[1:34:52] so i'm just trying to
[1:34:53] sometimes my notes well probably a lot
[1:34:55] of time they don't make sense my
[1:34:56] sentences i try and put in here
[1:34:58] amen no
[1:35:00] real faith does not swing like a yo-yo
[1:35:03] or a pendulum
[1:35:04] it stays right on course
[1:35:07] now your emotions may swing but that
[1:35:09] doesn't mean
[1:35:10] that you don't have faith
[1:35:13] right you'll have trouble but that
[1:35:15] doesn't mean that you don't have faith
[1:35:17] now i was going to read that yes that's
[1:35:18] what i was going to do here so the
[1:35:20] apostle paul as i said i just want to
[1:35:22] emphasize this again
[1:35:24] real faith does not is not a force field
[1:35:26] from trouble here's the apostle paul
[1:35:29] it's in galatians 2 and 20 i am
[1:35:30] crucified with christ nevertheless i
[1:35:32] live yet not i but christ liveth in me
[1:35:34] and the life which i now live in the
[1:35:36] flesh i live by the faith of the son of
[1:35:38] god who loved me and gave himself for me
[1:35:41] so he's saying the life i now live
[1:35:43] i live by the faith of the son of god
[1:35:45] it's not my own faith it's not my
[1:35:46] intellectual faith or anything it's
[1:35:48] actually god's own faith the same faith
[1:35:50] that when he spoke his word let there be
[1:35:52] sun moon and stars and he believed and
[1:35:53] it was so that same faith the apostle
[1:35:56] was living by
[1:35:57] but then if we could go to second
[1:35:59] corinthians 11 we can see uh the the
[1:36:02] time
[1:36:03] that the apostle paul had because real
[1:36:05] faith does not keep hardship away
[1:36:08] we look at the apostle paul he says um
[1:36:10] says ii corinthians 11 23 are they
[1:36:13] ministers of christ i speak as a fall i
[1:36:15] am more and laborers more abundant and
[1:36:17] stripes above measure and prisons more
[1:36:19] frequent and death deaths off so this is
[1:36:22] this is his this is his experience
[1:36:25] how is your christian experience paul
[1:36:27] i'm going to tell you
[1:36:29] so this is like you know who wants to be
[1:36:31] a missionary
[1:36:33] this is this is his experience
[1:36:36] of the jews five times received i 40
[1:36:38] stripes save one thrice was i beaten
[1:36:40] with rods once was i stoned thrice i
[1:36:43] suffered shipwreck a night and a day
[1:36:45] i've been in the deep in journeys often
[1:36:48] in perils of waters and perils of
[1:36:50] robbers and perils of my own countrymen
[1:36:52] imperials by the heathen and perils in
[1:36:54] the city and perils in the wilderness
[1:36:55] and perils in the sea and perils among
[1:36:57] false brethren in wariness and
[1:37:00] painfulness and watchings often and
[1:37:01] hunger and thirst and fastings often and
[1:37:04] cold and nakedness beside those things
[1:37:06] that they are which are without which
[1:37:08] cometh upon me daily the care of all the
[1:37:11] churches now i'll say this a lot of
[1:37:13] people they'll just get to the first
[1:37:15] part of this list and quit
[1:37:17] if it's just human faith they'll give up
[1:37:20] they said lord but i thought you'll be
[1:37:22] in me and i'm an overcomer and they'll
[1:37:23] never be no no no no no but you see the
[1:37:25] apostle paul he had all this trouble but
[1:37:27] he never quit
[1:37:28] he never gave up he knew he was there
[1:37:31] for a purpose right sure he got stoned
[1:37:33] and beaten all this trouble but his life
[1:37:35] was still within him he had not finished
[1:37:36] his purpose yet amen it should be the
[1:37:39] same thing with us because remember he
[1:37:40] had real revelation it wasn't a nice
[1:37:43] idea that he became an apostle was god
[1:37:45] said separate to me paul and barnabas
[1:37:47] right so he could he could go through
[1:37:49] all these things but yet keep going
[1:37:52] hallelujah
[1:37:53] how about you and i
[1:37:55] we come into difficulty you know it's
[1:37:57] like brother ram said about these
[1:37:59] serophenician woman who came to jesus
[1:38:02] her her daughter was grievously vexed
[1:38:03] for the devil
[1:38:05] she had she was perseverant she had real
[1:38:07] revelation faith if she just got to
[1:38:09] jesus then then her daughter will be
[1:38:11] well but you see brother em said she had
[1:38:14] trouble she had difficult but her faith
[1:38:17] did not well what was her difficult well
[1:38:20] jesus said you know i'm not sent to you
[1:38:23] difficult you know it's not me to give
[1:38:26] the children's bread to the dogs
[1:38:28] she had difficulty so in her humanity
[1:38:31] she had difficulty but her faith had no
[1:38:33] difficulty so if she was just going by
[1:38:36] her feelings she'd say
[1:38:38] and i thought this was the man of
[1:38:39] galilee who did nothing but good
[1:38:41] and i've come to him in my time of need
[1:38:44] and look at his response
[1:38:46] how dear how dare him i've come all this
[1:38:49] way i have this great need he's healed
[1:38:52] others why won't he yo
[1:38:54] he spoke to the centurion who was a
[1:38:57] gentile like me
[1:38:58] and see you'll go receive as you believe
[1:39:01] and here i am he's calling me a dog
[1:39:03] what a racist this guy is how dear what
[1:39:05] a sexist oh woman of dogs and all these
[1:39:07] things you know so she and her flesh she
[1:39:10] had difficulty
[1:39:11] right but her faith knew no difficulty
[1:39:14] because her faith went through those
[1:39:15] problems
[1:39:16] right her faith wasn't willing to take
[1:39:18] no for an answer because her faith it
[1:39:21] had already been revealed to her
[1:39:24] when he says the word
[1:39:25] she's going to be well it was already
[1:39:27] revealed she wasn't going and saying i
[1:39:28] hope this works she knew it was going to
[1:39:30] work it was revealed see so she had
[1:39:33] difficulty but her faith had no
[1:39:35] difficulty you know listen to
[1:39:36] perseverance brother speaks about it i
[1:39:39] mean so if we have real faith we may
[1:39:41] have difficulty we may have obstacles
[1:39:45] but our faith will take us through those
[1:39:47] things
[1:39:48] the apostle paul's faith took him
[1:39:50] through being in prison
[1:39:52] being beaten being shipwrecked
[1:39:54] being stoned
[1:39:56] all those kind of things his faith he he
[1:39:58] had difficulty but his faith did not
[1:40:00] why because his revelation was i'm going
[1:40:02] to rome
[1:40:04] i'm going to run to be a witness
[1:40:06] amen so we're going to be the same i
[1:40:08] trust that our faith is the same kind of
[1:40:10] faith you know what brother ram said
[1:40:11] about you know we think of the martyrs
[1:40:13] in the dark ages
[1:40:14] we think man the faith they had to stand
[1:40:17] stand in the colosseum all the lions and
[1:40:19] the beating and the everything that they
[1:40:20] suffered
[1:40:21] no doubt they would see someone
[1:40:23] crucified oh yeah that's the pastor the
[1:40:24] other day
[1:40:26] but they didn't quit
[1:40:27] that faith was rugged
[1:40:29] you know and brother am said the same
[1:40:31] faith that they had to overcome there is
[1:40:33] the same faith you have to live daily in
[1:40:35] this world
[1:40:37] hallelujah we're going to realize the
[1:40:39] faith we have is powerful
[1:40:41] the faith we have made the worlds i mean
[1:40:43] the faith we had amen brought the
[1:40:45] resurrection and the faith we have they
[1:40:48] had to overcome
[1:40:50] amen
[1:40:52] but it depends what you lean upon see
[1:40:55] you go by emotion you'll be defeated or
[1:40:57] or reasoning in there but if you go by
[1:40:58] faith
[1:40:59] take how you feel everything back to the
[1:41:01] word
[1:41:02] look beyond what you see
[1:41:06] amen
[1:41:08] amen so paul was bouncing up and down in
[1:41:11] that storm but god said he's going to
[1:41:13] rome
[1:41:14] that was it that was his absolute
[1:41:16] his absolute wasn't the storm his
[1:41:18] absolute wasn't the chains his absolute
[1:41:20] wasn't what all the other sailors and
[1:41:22] things were saying in their panic and
[1:41:23] their fear and their trouble no his
[1:41:25] absolute was the angel of god said
[1:41:26] you're going to rome god told me i'm
[1:41:28] going through him that was his absolute
[1:41:30] i mean i trust that we have the same
[1:41:32] kind of absolute i mean god's speaking
[1:41:34] to us god revealing himself to us we're
[1:41:36] going to get through we're going in a
[1:41:38] rapture
[1:41:39] amen we're going to have an absolute not
[1:41:41] we can't just have shifting sands of our
[1:41:43] ideas and our emotion that will come
[1:41:45] upon us and we'll stumble and fall i
[1:41:47] mean but we have an absolute of a
[1:41:48] revelation of the word of god we will be
[1:41:51] victorious
[1:41:52] remember it doesn't take away the
[1:41:54] trouble faith does not take away the
[1:41:55] trouble amen but faith gives you a way
[1:41:57] to overcome the trouble to go through
[1:41:59] the trouble
[1:42:00] hallelujah
[1:42:02] you know the apostle paul one time you
[1:42:04] know he he he blinded what the magician
[1:42:07] you know i think was on the island of
[1:42:08] crete or malta you know he said you
[1:42:10] child to the devil you'll be blind for a
[1:42:11] season right but then after that he was
[1:42:13] in another place and the someone the
[1:42:15] coppersmith ran him out of town
[1:42:17] did he say lord where's my faith gone no
[1:42:19] he just sold you wrong
[1:42:24] don't let disappointment
[1:42:25] keep you
[1:42:26] disappointed keep going on with god
[1:42:30] amen
[1:42:32] hallelujah now
[1:42:35] here we are he says now you see somebody
[1:42:37] else so this speak about perfect faith
[1:42:39] this is brother brown preaching perfect
[1:42:40] faith
[1:42:41] he says now then when god by his word
[1:42:44] not by what someone else did what
[1:42:46] someone else said but by what god's word
[1:42:48] said he said let every man's word be a
[1:42:51] lie and mind be true now you see
[1:42:53] somebody else do something by a worker
[1:42:55] act of god or a promise of god and many
[1:42:57] of them say i can do it too it's an
[1:43:00] imagination
[1:43:02] and when they do they find them wrecking
[1:43:04] up
[1:43:05] out there somewhere it's got to be a
[1:43:07] substance
[1:43:08] now it is potentially a faith it is
[1:43:10] something that you could bring you up to
[1:43:12] a faith it is potentially like you've
[1:43:14] asked me for an oak tree and i give you
[1:43:17] an acorn potentially you have an oak
[1:43:19] tree but it hasn't produced itself yet
[1:43:21] but when it really brings itself out
[1:43:23] it's an oak tree
[1:43:26] and when you imagine that god does this
[1:43:28] but when it's revealed to you
[1:43:30] it's faith then a perfect faith that
[1:43:32] cannot fail so testimonies are good
[1:43:34] because it builds faith but when you say
[1:43:36] oh i can do that too but it's not
[1:43:38] revealed that's just imagination right
[1:43:40] so we need to say lord reveal your
[1:43:42] promises to me man not just be it's good
[1:43:44] to imagine the promise of god
[1:43:47] amen and the devil puts negative things
[1:43:49] in your mind
[1:43:50] oh this is going to happen and this is
[1:43:52] happening and it causes your imagination
[1:43:53] to go it always goes downhill
[1:43:56] to destruction is really the end before
[1:43:58] the credits roll
[1:44:00] right so he puts things in your
[1:44:02] imagination so why not so to me it's
[1:44:05] good to imagine what god could do
[1:44:07] but don't take that as a leading
[1:44:09] right take it as god revealing his word
[1:44:11] to you and that's the leading because if
[1:44:13] god's revealed it to you he will cause
[1:44:15] it to come to pass like elijah mount
[1:44:17] carmel he wasn't wondering is this going
[1:44:20] to work is my bluff and my bravado going
[1:44:22] to hold out no he went there and he and
[1:44:25] after the sacrifice was prepared he
[1:44:27] prayed said lord may the people know
[1:44:29] that thou art god and i've done this
[1:44:30] according to your word so he saw by
[1:44:33] vision exactly what was going to take
[1:44:34] place he stepped into the vision he
[1:44:36] wasn't guessing is the fire going to
[1:44:38] fall is it going to rain he knew it
[1:44:39] would happen
[1:44:41] it was revealed to him see that was his
[1:44:43] absolute in the circumstance it's going
[1:44:44] to be the same thing when god reveals
[1:44:46] his word reveals the promise
[1:44:49] i mean then we can walk with confidence
[1:44:50] because when it's revealed then perfect
[1:44:53] faith cannot fail
[1:44:55] it's a faith then see see that's the
[1:44:57] reason these visions are so tremendous
[1:44:59] to me because it's been proved right
[1:45:01] every time see and i know that he
[1:45:03] promised that and he promised it in his
[1:45:04] word and here he comes and promises it
[1:45:07] for this day therefore you know where
[1:45:09] you're standing when he said so see it
[1:45:12] that gives me a faith because he never
[1:45:14] does nothing contrary to his written
[1:45:16] word see and if it was contrary to the
[1:45:18] word i couldn't have faith in it brings
[1:45:21] it back again to the word see faith in
[1:45:23] hearing the word of god you must hear
[1:45:25] the word god's word is that all
[1:45:27] sufficient word it's all you of need of
[1:45:30] is his word now faith being the
[1:45:32] substance and in there we find out in
[1:45:34] hebrews what faith was and what those
[1:45:37] uh did who had faith see there's many
[1:45:40] times that people have faith today and
[1:45:41] tomorrow they haven't got it the next
[1:45:43] day there's something and something else
[1:45:45] but when god once anchors it and you see
[1:45:47] it there's nothing ever going to make
[1:45:49] you move from it
[1:45:51] hallelujah so nothing can make paul move
[1:45:53] from it
[1:45:54] shipwrecks beating stonings trouble
[1:45:56] distress naked peril sword nothing could
[1:45:59] move him from that face because it was
[1:46:01] revealed to him and when this message is
[1:46:03] revealed to you that the lord himself
[1:46:05] reveals it to you nothing can move you
[1:46:07] from it doesn't matter what critics say
[1:46:09] trouble says doubt say atheists say
[1:46:12] whatever says religious spirits say
[1:46:14] nothing can move you from it because
[1:46:16] it's been revealed
[1:46:17] amen i pray that's why we should pray
[1:46:19] for lord reveal your word to me don't
[1:46:21] just stuff my head with it lord put it
[1:46:23] down in my soul that it lives and is
[1:46:25] alive
[1:46:26] i mean because we have received the
[1:46:28] faith once delivered to the saints of
[1:46:30] revelation we've received it amen it is
[1:46:32] in the building right now it is in your
[1:46:33] heart moving amen that faith that was
[1:46:35] once given to them is given to you
[1:46:38] although that's why we can say lord
[1:46:39] reveal yourself to me
[1:46:41] and make your promises alive that's why
[1:46:43] it's so important you know i bet i bet
[1:46:46] you the devil will put you say i'm going
[1:46:48] to read the bible i'm going to go read
[1:46:49] yo pray and the devil gives you a to-do
[1:46:52] list
[1:46:53] of things that you need to do
[1:46:55] what's he trying to do because he knows
[1:46:56] that faith cometh by hearing and hearing
[1:46:58] the word of god he's seen it down
[1:47:00] through the ages
[1:47:01] he doesn't want to admit it but if he
[1:47:03] actually told the truth once he'd say
[1:47:05] this works
[1:47:06] it defeated me here defeated me in moses
[1:47:09] time and joshua's time and david's time
[1:47:11] down through the apostles time the
[1:47:13] prophet's time i've been whipped down
[1:47:14] through the ages because
[1:47:16] of the faith once delivered to the
[1:47:18] saints he knows the damage it's done to
[1:47:20] him he still carries the bruise in the
[1:47:21] scars he still doesn't have the keys to
[1:47:23] his own house he can't find him
[1:47:25] right so he tries to keep us from it
[1:47:30] amen she said lord may we just re and
[1:47:32] i'm talking to myself very much so may
[1:47:34] we rearrange our lives
[1:47:37] that we can actually drink in the
[1:47:38] promises of god
[1:47:40] hallelujah meditate upon them read them
[1:47:43] enjoy them not in a stress way saying oh
[1:47:45] i've got to remember this and no no you
[1:47:47] know you know what builds faith
[1:47:50] love builds faith
[1:47:55] you want you want more faith love and
[1:47:57] more he says here and speak to the rock
[1:47:59] how simple how simple when you just
[1:48:00] believe god's word and take him at what
[1:48:02] he says isn't it simple just love
[1:48:05] if you love him
[1:48:07] love in your heart for god will create
[1:48:10] faith
[1:48:10] [Music]
[1:48:12] love in your heart for god will create
[1:48:14] faith who wants more faith
[1:48:16] love him from your heart it will create
[1:48:18] faith
[1:48:20] i mean just just just enjoy his word
[1:48:23] just lord i'm so thankful i can read
[1:48:25] i've got psalm 31 thank you lord i can
[1:48:27] read that
[1:48:28] thank you lord so amazing what you said
[1:48:30] through dave just just just enjoy him
[1:48:32] he'll produce a greater love which will
[1:48:34] produce a greater faith
[1:48:37] amen now
[1:48:39] i'm going to read this
[1:48:41] our lord jesus was our example
[1:48:44] i'm going to read two more no i was
[1:48:45] going to read this now and and then i'll
[1:48:48] hit pause and we'll continue on another
[1:48:50] time now now
[1:48:52] here's our example now everyone knows
[1:48:54] this quite very well but but see he says
[1:48:56] g see real faith is subconscious
[1:48:59] it's not something consciously in your
[1:49:00] mind it's down in your heart that's real
[1:49:02] faith
[1:49:03] right so
[1:49:04] jesus no matter if he was in a storm and
[1:49:07] in the and the gal was knocking the boat
[1:49:08] from one side to the other or you're
[1:49:10] standing in a face of a mess of demons
[1:49:14] if he was hanging anywhere it never
[1:49:15] moved him
[1:49:16] he walked right on just as calm as quiet
[1:49:19] as he could be why he was simply
[1:49:21] unconscious of fear or anything around
[1:49:23] him so down in his heart he didn't have
[1:49:26] those things
[1:49:27] right so so when so when i'm reading
[1:49:29] this it says that he was unconscious of
[1:49:31] it that doesn't mean he had these
[1:49:32] blinkers on like this and didn't see it
[1:49:34] or didn't hear it
[1:49:36] see remember real faith is not an
[1:49:38] absence of the enemy
[1:49:40] real faith is proven in the presence of
[1:49:42] the enemy just like david said thou set
[1:49:44] a table before me in the presence of my
[1:49:46] enemies amen you know my hair with oil
[1:49:49] my cup runs over for joy so god sets a
[1:49:51] table for his bride in the presence of
[1:49:54] the devil
[1:49:56] come to devil i invite you to this feast
[1:49:58] you're not eating
[1:49:59] don't touch the food now don't hurt the
[1:50:01] oil on the wine
[1:50:03] but he allows your enemy to come when
[1:50:05] you're feasting on the word of god
[1:50:09] so faith is not an absence of the enemy
[1:50:12] it actually is proven in the presence of
[1:50:13] the enemy
[1:50:15] amen if i can put it that way see so he
[1:50:18] was simply unconscious or fear or
[1:50:19] anything around him that's right
[1:50:20] whatever was going to happen or or
[1:50:22] whether it wasn't going to happen he
[1:50:24] knowed it was going to happen because
[1:50:25] god said so he didn't say oh have i
[1:50:27] prayed through i wonder if i fasted long
[1:50:30] enough i wonder if i did this he just
[1:50:32] walked right on
[1:50:34] see unconscious that's right see he
[1:50:36] didn't say have i done enough for for
[1:50:39] for the father to do anything no no he
[1:50:41] just walked right on work because he's
[1:50:43] walking in perfect faith he knew who he
[1:50:44] was
[1:50:45] no that doesn't mean we shouldn't pray
[1:50:47] and fast
[1:50:48] right
[1:50:49] but he wasn't scared of his own ability
[1:50:52] to bring the promise of god to pass
[1:50:54] because he was just walking trusting
[1:50:56] fully surrendered
[1:50:58] he just walked right on unconscious
[1:50:59] that's right he believed that that god
[1:51:01] said was truth the word must be
[1:51:03] fulfilled and he knowed what his life
[1:51:06] was to fulfill them that's right
[1:51:09] and you're here to fulfill it too
[1:51:11] we're here to fulfill the word
[1:51:13] we're here to fulfill the word first
[1:51:14] thessalonians 4 revelations 19 the
[1:51:17] marriage of the lamb has come
[1:51:18] that's right here right now going on and
[1:51:20] his wife has made herself ready unto her
[1:51:22] was granted she'd be right in fine linen
[1:51:24] and clean and white the rices of saints
[1:51:26] i mean we put on he says here's the
[1:51:28] wedding gown
[1:51:29] here's my righteousness put it on at
[1:51:31] fencing you'll find it's tailor-made
[1:51:33] hallelujah for your for your inside man
[1:51:36] not for this physical man but the inside
[1:51:38] man this fits me just well
[1:51:40] hallelu you know i remember um brother

[1:51:44] christchurch he came over the dedication
[1:51:46] of the church the first time and he
[1:51:48] related this dream he had when he was
[1:51:49] gathered around the throne and you know
[1:51:50] the crowns were being given out and his
[1:51:53] name was called yeah everyone's there
[1:51:54] rejoicing and you know and then and then
[1:51:56] you know it goes up before the lord and
[1:51:58] the lord puts the crown upon his head
[1:52:00] and he's thinking in the dream i wonder
[1:52:02] how he knows my hat size
[1:52:04] you know it fits so well and then and
[1:52:06] then and then other names are called out
[1:52:08] and then and then brother brown's name's
[1:52:10] called out
[1:52:11] and they're looking around where is he
[1:52:13] and he's actually i hope i don't get
[1:52:15] this wrong but he's like walking the
[1:52:16] other way because he feels so unworthy
[1:52:18] and two brothers had to pick him up by
[1:52:19] their
[1:52:20] arms pick him up and put him down and
[1:52:22] before the lord and the lord put the
[1:52:24] crown on his head and then before he
[1:52:26] even stood up he said no lord this is
[1:52:28] all you
[1:52:29] and then as soon as he did that this
[1:52:31] emotion just came over everyone came up
[1:52:32] brother ron saying that's so true and
[1:52:34] they put their crowns down before the
[1:52:35] lord it's like this big pile of crowns
[1:52:37] was just formed and formed the law was
[1:52:39] at the top of it and all this glory of
[1:52:40] the lord just swept over all the people
[1:52:42] hallelujah but you know
[1:52:44] he thinks how does the crown fit i mean
[1:52:46] how does the lord know well it's made
