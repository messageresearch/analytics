on them god lord i pray to some blessed hear lord jesus jesus christ [Music] i am an email emailed heavy oh actually we can stand stand amen we'll just turn to our bibles i mean thank you thank you musicians that was awesome thank you brother for the cure that was that was that was actually really i like the song leading man it was good um if we're going to alternate bibles to um to mark mark 14 and we'll go um and go to verse 3. so mark 14 and then to verse three amen and it says here and being in beth uh bethany the house of simon the leper he sat at me so this is jesus and we will i trust we all know the story became a woman having an alabaster box appointment and spikenard very precious and she broke the box and poured it on his head and there were some and there were some that had indignation within themselves and said why was this waste appointment made for it might have been sold for more than 300 pence and have been given to the poor and they murmured against her amen and jesus said let her alone why trouble you her she hath wrought a good work for me for she for ye have the poor with you always when so ever you well ye may do them good but you have uh but me ye have not always she has done what she could she has come beforehand to anoint my body to the bearing verily i send you whether so ever the gospel shall be preached throughout the whole world this also that she hath done shall be spoken for a memorial for her i mean how powerful amen amen so i was thinking on that i want to preach my sermon um this afternoon is called our past faults can't hold us i mean so what we do actually doesn't affect us you know if we if if it's forgiven us god forgives us it cannot hold us at all amen amen and i'd like to look at the story and just use a story for a little bit of as an example i like to think on this woman you know the act that she did she brought her alabaster box to jesus you know and i was thinking you know i i like to think about the story a little bit and you know maybe you know she didn't let you know what she did wrong take bring that blue box woman and anoint jesus you know she didn't let it allow it to stop her and i like to think you know maybe she worked for a whole year you know to to she she all she wants stills i want to buy this alabaster box and anoint jesus i mean maybe she worked for one entire year you know to buy this box for jesus and you know it would have been hard it's like oh you know who faults might have got to after week one you know i've done this i shouldn't really be doing this but maybe she pressed on and she saved up enough money to to buy this box i mean because you know the people back in those days you know they weren't they weren't very rich and you know maybe she was one of those people you know quite poor so you're just here to save up for a while and then you know also you know maybe there was someone taking an example you know maybe she was real poor she went to the sky and she says oh could i please buy some some bread some food off you and you know maybe turn her down and shamed her because oh you know you're poor and and maybe he was with you know adam and and bethany with with um simon let her in them and with with jesus you know maybe he was sitting there and she came and she says oh no look who's here you know i've this man's disgraced me and i have to go be disgraced again and as you know but this is how i have to get to god you know but she made it and and and look what happened to her for doing that um this also that she has done this is verse nine done shall be spoken for a of for a memorial of her she gets remembered amen amen i mean i believe you know she gets eternal life i mean but how how powerful is that you know she don't shouldn't allow her faults to stop her and and now she's remembered amen so she pushed me she she pushed on through man hey man oh sorry you guys might be seated i'm sorry sorry i don't think you've got it done and then if we could turn to um james five and then we'll go to verse 15. so james chapter five and then go versus 15. so james 5 and verse 15 it says here and the pure of faith shall save the sick and the lord shall raise him up and if he have committed sins they shall be forgiven him amen so if you've ever done anything wrong it shall be forgiven you and then also says here in verse 16 confess your faults one to another and pray one for another that you may be healed and i was gonna finish there and so you know you know confessing our faults there are certain things that if we do we must go apologize for those things no yes but you know we we we can't you know just you can go apologize for you know whatever you want you know but it's you know i wouldn't but you know there are there are certain things that there are certain things that you must you know some things you do you have to apologize and and you know it's you know once we confess our faults god can then there's a light come because you know satan likes as well in darkness you know as soon as soon as we we bring that darkness to the light light just shines and it just and and we can see things what it is you know we're not we're not stumbled at this massive darkness we can just step over it like it's a little a little twiggy you know just step on it amen amen i want to use i want to use a bit of a bit of an example i was um there was this place that i've been to and you know i didn't like it all and i you know it but and and i left and then a couple months later i was it was kind of you know satan likes to everything's glamorized i say hollywood it's actually the where they have the hollywood um uh like presentation stuff it's actually like a place in the hood or some you know some real dumb place but it's got a nice signboard you know that everybody can see those like this you know and you know satan was trying to glamorize it for me i'm like man you know i wonder if i should go back and then something inside me said no that's extremely wrong and i actually and i and i and i apologized for being there in the first place and then instantly the light shone man also oh my goodness what an awful dark place i never ever am going back there again in my life amen it was so terrifying i was like oh my goodness but yeah you know we um you know if we our faults shouldn't let us you know shouldn't shouldn't hinder us you know because we're the bride of christ amen and it says in the bible you know that um once you're saved i think it's in john or something once you're saved no man shall pluck you out of the world's hand so if you you know you can't go anywhere anymore you're now you're trapped and you've been giving this eternal life that you can't let go amen amen so why do we why would we live in our faults and just let things you know smash us down man we want to raise up because yeah amen oh they're quite powerful and then um uh brother branham actually does um i just want to read a quote from brother branham and he says here amen put um put them in the sea of forgetfulness and remember them no more that's what kind of god we have not goes and digs it up again and holds it against you forget i forget amen that's the brother that's what brother branham says you know god god um uh devil's saying you know god doesn't have a um god doesn't have a satan's got a book you know and he just opens up and so you know sam's got a book about each and every one of us you know and it's it's you know it's not about the good things it's just you know what we did wrong you know we feel down he comes and tries to read it to us little little little passages of what we where we messed up but amen but god doesn't have one of those he just grabs it and throws it away i mean so it wasn't there to begin with amen i found i was like you know what what a great god we serve you know he doesn't just doesn't just disgruntle us and hold us down you know yeah with positive people amen so there's you know it's just awesome to be to be here be with you guys and just yeah with a lot of positive brethren that no i've loved people and you know generally there's nothing wrong anyways you know it's just an awesome awesome place to be you know yeah it's like man how how how amazing yeah anyway yeah i'm just gonna i'm just gonna leave it at that but i hope you all were we're truly blessed amen [Music] thank you [Music] get that [Music] because he's given jesus christ is [Music] [Music] jesus christ [Music] has [Music] the lord has done [Music] [Applause] [Music] jesus christ [Music] [Music] jesus christ [Music] you can sit now if you want this is a little bit strange for me because uh english is not my first language i know that you are quite familiar now with a south african accent but now you're going to have to get used to the spanish one so and probably i'm not going to speak for long but i thought that brother david he was going to speak for a longer time so probably he's going to be the favorite of the kids now so we can open our bibles in a book of luke chapter 15 and verse 11 this is a very uh popular story it's the prodigal son um amen so i said and he said a certain man had two sons and the younger of them said to his father father give me the portion of good that followeth to me and he divided unto them his living and not many days after the younger son gather all together and took his journey into a far country and they wasted his substance with righteous living we can pray now almighty lord we want to give you thanks for everything thank you thank you for that service that we have this morning lord thank you for your blessing sir we want to ask you to please use me lord to probably just bless someone that needs to hear something from you my lord we want to ask you this in the name of our lord jesus christ amen amen so i felt in my heart to talk about this because i wanted to talk about another thing i wanted to preach about the king david what no when i was driving my car from levin i felt in my heart the entire week to to say something to to the young people so if you are not young you can walk out no just kidding so i wanted to share a little bit of my testimony because when i was a kid i was like one of you i was always a church and i was like one of you guys when when you sing you lift your hands and you feel the presence of the lord amen so one of the most beautiful remember that i have when i was a kid was when my parents they used to rent this old vhs you know there's movies all movies my brother and we used to watch movies about uh king david or jonah and all these movies and we were learning about the lord i'm pretty sure that some of you parents you're doing the thing and you try to teach your kids about the world and and that was a blessing for us for me and my brother my brother just did so he knows that everything what i'm what i'm going to say is true [Laughter] so there is a proverb uh a very true proverb that said train up a child in the way that he should go and when he is all he will not depart from it and that's why it's so important that you young people are here because you're learning the way your parents are teaching you the way this is the only way that's the only this is the only way so when i start to grow up my parents they start to um trying to get us more involved in the church so they start to um buying us guitars or mandolins from my brother so we they wanted us to be more involved with the church and we and be active at church and that's so good my brother he is so nice when you can see that if someone is playing the base and go to the bathroom there's like three little kids that try to grab the base or the guitar or whatever they just want to be there that was something that really touched my heart the first time that i came here when we moved the first service i came here we were i think we were singing um my god no yes my god is awesome and there was a little kid behind me and he was singing just almost i don't know how to say it but he was singing so loud my god is awesome and i feel so blessed with the young kid here because man they they're so nice that's all good i i really love them glory so my childhood got like engraving my heart with all those beautiful moments that my parents and they were trying to teach me the word and that was just awesome that's something when you grow up you cannot get rid of it because that's really really engraving your heart yes but when i became a teenager i became more wise too all wise [Laughter] and i started to doubt about everything everything in the bible that wonderful book became to me like a book of tales i didn't want to believe anymore in the bible there were so many stories like a donkey that speak and and the whale and i thought no no there's now i'm smarter yeah i don't want to believe this no no but the thing is that in my house my parents they were praying for me and they knew what i was going through and they were praying for me they were praying for me and i really give them a hard time really give them a hard time my brother and when the devil start to drag me to the world was slowly but slowly with music with a girlfriend with alcohol with drugs but slowly slowly and there was a time that was just in the world i could realize that man i'm here in the world i don't want to believe in god because no one of my friends believed in god so i don't want to believe i wanted to fit with them but my childhood was here yeah hey man and when i realized that i was totally lost i knew there was a deep calling a deep my brother hallelujah and i was told and there was no way out so i prayed to the lord so i was a atheist i didn't want to believe in god but i prayed because i i really knew that it was a god yes i wanted to say there was not but i knew that there was a god hallelujah in in the verse 17 of the parable of the prodigal son said and when he came to himself and that's what happened to me when you can be lost but there is a moment that you you you come to yourself and you realize everything and and keep saying and he said how many um hard servants of my fathers have bred enough and to spare and i perish with hunger and i realized i was lost but i prayed to the lord and my mind got restored amen so when i was when i was a kid i always listened to the um to the other brother saying god is my savior but to me he was not mercedes because i was not lost but when i got lost i could see that he was my savior amen amen but you don't have to go to the world to realize about that because in the world there's no anything for you you are not going to be blessed in the world because you are meant to be here here here's your place it doesn't matter if some of your friends they can be happy over there but you're not going to be happy because the lord is going to drag you here there is no escape i'm so sorry there's no glory there's no okay for you my brother so all the time when i was um reading the parable of the prodigal son um there's not many people talking about the father's side of that story because i'm pretty sure that that father he was just praying for his son and he was praying and praying and there is a in the book of acts chapter 16 verse 31 said and they said believe on the lord jesus christ and thou shalt be saved in thy house so to that promise you can hold and you know that your kids they need to come back there's there's no way out it's a promise from the lord yeah that's right so the lord had another plans for me and i'm very happy that to be here my brother and today i can tell you all of you kids that there's nothing for you over there there's just sorrows you're gonna be sad you're not gonna be happy you're gonna be happy just for a couple of months or something but believe me god is going to make your life this is a little bit hard but your life is going to be miserable out there because you are not meant to be there you are meant to be here so and probably one day you can walk off through that those doors and believe that you are never going to come back but you are going to and the way that you're going to go out is not the same way that you are going to return you are going to come back like with a broken heart and only you're going to to normal brother surrender your heart to the lord there's nothing for you over there so our heavenly father he's not gonna let us to get lost yeah and now um me and my brother we are third generations of believers and the story started with my grandma that she was one day in the countryside and she heard a sound in the field and she ran there and there was some missionary brothers preaching the gospel in the middle of nowhere and she believed and by the faith of that old woman my grandfather is going to be safe my uncles are going to be safe and all our family is going to be safe my brother and me and pedro we are now opera and i how do you say that we are the first generation now here on a higher ground my brother we are the first generation believe in the message so just to end the decision that you're going to make today or in a couple of days is going to affect your future yeah so you you should choose wisely because with god everything everything is possible and there's no anything for you out there and there is so many brothers here that they can tell you the same thing it doesn't know anything for you out there anything and i heard once that to remember something you need to do something different otherwise you forget so i really would like you young people to stand up and go and give a hug to your parents and tell them how much you love them and how much you how happy you are for your parents to teach you the way how to go to heaven so you can now stand and go and hug your parents if they are here [Music] so one day if one day you start believing that you are smarter i want you to remember this moment the moment when you were so grateful to the lord so that's all what i have that's all i want to i wanted to share with you and i would like to invite brother kiera to sing another song and [Applause] um can we sing the blessing so god bless you and thank you for listening [Applause] [Music] [Music] um [Music] the lord bless you and keep you make it space [Music] face the lord [Music]
