[Music] foreign foreign [Music] welcome to the house of law this morning [Music] it's very nice to be here it's good to see your faces to see redeemed Eternal sons of God and Daughters of God we had a little game of basketball and Futsal with the adults and the youth the other day and I had to um we had the the adults team had these um purple basketball tops which I think fish must have got from somewhere and we were the 11 8ors emphasis on the word lemon but um we had to share these tops because we didn't have enough of them so one brother would come off sweetie and there and then he would take his his singlet off and give it to me he like I had I got um rather Marion's won one session you know what Mario's like he runs fast and doing all the stuff and he's sweating but we agreed that it was eternal DNA on there so we didn't mind I said I'll take it I'm gonna look forever now I've got Eternal DNA on me so because he's a brother in Christ amen it's good it's good times to be living in now we live in such exciting times for the bride of Christ the lord is ministering and moving in our midst and is going to do more and more in such a powerful way and the conditions in the world are becoming such that that's just the way it has to be the the presence of God is going to raise up the standard like he said that he would against the the onslaught you know we see morally the situation in the world is decaying there's a there's a moral decay if you look at statistics from what they was even in this country 120 years ago to what there is now it's it's a phenomenal difference divorces there were maybe a couple of cases yeah not many per year murders there were one per year things like that it was it's just amazing that the the place where we've come and even um you know there's an onslaught of Darkness even the the economy you know we think we've had a bad run with covert and things this there's like a currency crisis at the door for the world which most most people don't realize it's there that the whole currency system's about to finish it's done these have never lasted for much time they have all come to an end these currencies that we use and this this one is about to come to an end it's happening as we speak it's Banks all around the world are buying up gold and things are happening it's it's phenomenal the place we were at and the the signs that the prophets were told the things that that we knew would happen are happening it's so exciting a lot of people are scared but we're not scared we're excited because the Bible said when you see these things happen you look up your Redemption drawers nice amen and and you know we we're going to have such a good time in the Lord day by day as time goes on you know the the power of God and the presence of the Lord is going to be more and more manifest in our lives day by day you're on the winning team and it's good to be on the winning team and we don't have to fear a thing so let's stand this morning and and just give the Lord thanks and praise that that we can come and I think you'll find as the weeks and months roll on go go buying this this has to happen more the the most valuable thing in your life will be the the Lord his word and the brethren I think you're fine because you'll realize that those are those things are eternal amen and that's what we want this morning is to to set our mind on things Eternal this morning no we don't come here to to do natural things to increase naturally we come here to increase spiritually and to to set our eyes on spiritual things this morning so let's just having a prayer Heavenly Father we're so grateful that we can be here this morning Lord to set our eyes upon things Eternal Lord upon the unchanging almighty God Lord the the all-powerful god the the faithful God the the comforter Lord of me would humbly invite you into our presence this morning Lord may you minister to us through the music and and may the mayor songs invite you here Lord as you inhabit the Praises of your people as we we go forth Lord to to battle this morning battle against the enemy and all his his ways of unbelief and doubt that he would try and put in and his his work all his negative words and his words of unbelief we want to resist those this morning Lord and accept your words of truth Lord and apply them to our hearts by faith that they would bring forth fruit that they would they were purpose to bring forth Lord so we want to invite you to our midst bless the ministry maybe you've receive it as being from the Lord this morning Lord and we're so excited to be here Lord and to be able to to praise you in such a time as this lord it's it's a it's it's such an a powerful time your Prophet said that if he could choose any time to live and it will be this time Lord because although we see these things happening we see the full manifestation of the power and the word of God in our midst Lord there's Amen to get to a place where it's never been before where we're even in the book of Acts they tried to get to it but they didn't they didn't get to where we are getting to now because it wasn't the season for it Lord but now it's the season for for the four-man infestation of Christ amongst his people so we just thank you Lord and we just want to commit this service to you in Jesus name amen praise the Lord uh when the role is Called Up Yonder I'm going to do it sort of like a when the Trump bit off the Lord shall stand the time shall be no more and the morning [Music] hold up yonders pull on that riding clouds

for praise the Lord amen thanks brother Isaac thank you musicians amen amen good to have everyone here this morning praise the Lord amen as brother Cuba said sadly this is their last Sunday with us we love you both very much it's been great to have you here this side and I believe it won't be seven years until we see each other again amen praise the Lord amen let's um let's go to uh judges 15 this morning um I'm gonna go to judges 15 and 11. just working okay good I'm not getting any crazy hand signals on the back so it must be okay all right um so I've spoken a bit about on these lines and overseas but so I thought I just felt to share it here too but just like some restaurants everything comes out different even though it may be the same meal anyway judges 15 and 11 I'm going to read down to verse 16 here it says uh then 3000 men of Judah went to the Top of the Rock uh item instead of Samson know us they are not uh that the Philistines uh rulers over us what is this that thou has done unto us and he said unto them as they did unto me so I've done unto them and they said unto him we uh come down to bind thee that we may deliver thee into the hand of the Philistines and Samson said unto them swear unto me that you will not fall upon me yourselves and they spake unto him saying no we will bind thee fast and deliver the into their hand but surely we'll not kill thee and they bound him with two new chords and bought him up from the Rock and when he came unto Lehigh the Philistines shouted against him and the spirit of Lord came up mightily upon him and the chords that will upon his arms became as Flex that was burnt with fire and his bands loose from Office hands and he found a new Jawbone of an ass and put forth his hand and took it and slew a thousand men there with and Samson said with the Jawbone of an ass heaps upon heaps with the Jawbone of an ass have I slammed a thousand men amen it's about his Amen in prayer this morning amen gracious father we want to thank you so much we can come to honor the resurrection this morning Lord knowing that Lord the tomb is empty dear God because you Rose law that death could not hold you the grave could not keep you Lord and it cannot keep us Lord because you said because I love you shall have also amen so we want to thank you Lord that we can look upon each other and say what a resurrection this is Lord because of what you've done in our lives and dear God as we come this morning we've read your word we need you the great author once again to come and make it live oh God so Lord may you anoint both speaker and hearer Lord may you come live among us Lord touch our hearts speak to our lives like only you can amen indeed God we want to remember Brother Andy Lord as he's ministering up and Fielding this morning Lord I pray you'd fill his mouth with your words Lord and speak to everyone eat up their lord according to your riches and Glory May bless the Clifford family and give them Journey Mercies home Lord and father in on here Lord who who couldn't make it here because of sickness or Lord of need in their life Lord River they may be Lord May touch them and be their portion we love you Lord we want to thank you we can commit Our Lives into your hands Lord in Jesus Christ's name amen amen God bless you may have your seats this morning so I'd like to take a thought here about a paradox where where brother Brown would say um uh mentioning this the scripture where Samson would kill a thousand men with a job owner of an ass here um he said now so this little fellow standing out here all at once here Came Upon these Philistines and and surrounded him to kill him and he took the Jawbone of a mule that was laying there a wild one little donkeys picked up the Jawbone of that mule and the spirit Lord came upon him and there was a paradox how did he beat down with a Jawbone of a mule though that half um half thick half inch thick helmet over the top of the head with a Jawbone of a mule why the first that old jaw bone uh laying there the first liquor would have hit it would have burst it to a thousand pieces over the top of those helmets all those big shields win a thousand rushed in upon him and he beat every one of them to death a paradox that's when the spirit of God Came Upon him and then the prophet says oh if we could only bleed your bones in the hands of God there would be another Paradox yeah amen so he's saying if we're just like that that Jawbone there in the hands of hands of Samson if we're like that in the hands of God God you know there'll be another Paradox upon the Earth and we know a paradox you know it's something that's unreasonable but it's really incredible Webster it says it's true it's something incredible it's you can't understand it it's just a mystery but it's incredible it's unreasonable but it's true that's what a paradox is and God has is calling a people for another Paradox and really our life already are a paradox they are unreasonable to the world Amen when we look at you know you know it's a paradox when we look through the scripture to see you know the kind of people that God calls it's actually unreasonable you know when he doesn't call the learner he doesn't call the educated he doesn't call the religious and the pious and the you know the high and mighty of society but he but he calls the outcasts he calls the people who would never be considered for anything you know we're not the strongest we're not the fastest we're not the smartest we don't have a Nobel Prize Among Us I mean you know we don't have great a lot of degrees and phds and so on and nothing wrong with those things but we don't have those things among us really you know we are we are the just the unknowns of society but God uses those kind of people to perform a paradox when you think about this very scientific age we live in we are where man knows where he thinks he knows pretty much everything top of a you know you know Google will tell you how quickly it is you know that'll that'll give you a search answer back and you know everything's at our fingertips like never before and man thinks he's got everything worked out but your God is going to work a paradox in this age he's going to take a people and work a paradox where it's something that to man it's unreasonable you know it's something that is that is just not you know shouldn't be so but it is true amen you know the great Paradox we know as a people walking with the Lord and and then and then and then they take he he takes them like he did Enoch and we are not because God takes us home amen so you know the Lord would say in Isaiah 55 my thoughts are not your thoughts neither my ways or your ways saith the Lord for as the heavens are higher than the earth so my ways are higher than your ways and my thoughts than your thoughts amen so his thoughts his thoughts are different to man's thoughts you know that's why man is going in the completely opposite direction to to God's way it's because our ways our thoughts naturally are not his thoughts but when the spirit of God comes into a person's life and then then therefore they receive the mind of Christ they walk with God that's a paradox amen I mean that's a paradox when it's not even within man to seek after God it's actually not even in our own makeup to seek after him it's actually a work of Grace you know you know the grace of our Lord actually that puts a hunger the Deep calling to the Deep Amen to that in itself is a paradox where maybe all of your family all of your friends all of your colleagues they are not interested in God at all maybe religion but not God but yet there's something in you says I want him that's a paradox I mean it's unreasonable to the world to think that actually Jesus Christ is alive amen his word is true he's fulfilling it in this day you go on the street start telling people about the prophecy that's being fulfilled in this day they'd say that's unreasonable you know they would explain it away they say you're crazy man you're full of conspiracy theories and fake news but no the Bible is not fake news the Bible is not conspiracy theory I mean but the Bible is we are living in Bible days once again we're seeing so many scriptures being fulfilled in the day we live I'm so thankful for that amen we're not wandering along blindly amen see man thinks that the way up is up right so so those who are smart those who are proud and you know you know those who have a Persona of being Invincible they think that's the way that is up but really with God the Way Up Is Down amen because whosoever exalts himself shall be a beast and he that humbleth himself shall be exalted so so that's a paradox in itself man says that's unreasonable amen that actually the Way Up Is Down but with God the Way Up Is Down amen so the more humble you get the more he can lift you up amen the more humble you get the more he can show you in his word the more humble you can get the more God can live in your life I remember but when we think we're something and then we think we can fulfill it and we think we can do it then well we're just going down we're not going up amen so it's really the opposite Amen brother Brown would say give me a preacher give me a Christian give me a housewife that's a Christian give me a farmer or a factory worker that will put God first in everything I'll show you a man who will be successful in spite of all the devil can put on him he seeks God first see that's a paradox I mean because we know we're not exempt from trials amen just because we're Believers actually we get more trials I mean when you give your life to the Lord you're actually signing up for the battle amen because why because now you've got an opposing Force you've actually actually declared a revolution against the devil saying devil I'm not going to be under your tyranny anymore you're turning anymore I'm going to Dethrone you amen I'm gonna I'm gonna I'm actually gonna become a Republic from hell yeah amen I'm not I'm not under its Dominion anymore I'm not part of it's Commonwealth I'm a free man or a free woman amen that's when that's when the battle begins amen but you know it's a paradox for someone to actually start walking with God and keep walking with God Amen that itself is something that's unreal reasonable it's incredible but yet it's true and it's more than possible Hallelujah I'm in a paradox seems so unreal to the world I meant something that they can't prescribe to something beyond their knowledge and understanding but when a simple heart will take that word and sink it into the depths of its being then the word produces the the live facts of that promise see a paradox is when you can believe the word and faith and it manifests it's incredible but yet it's true amen when you look at the promise of receiving the Holy Ghost God changes your nature burns out all the desires of sin and lust and everything that's a paradox where God himself changes the human nature of a person amen maybe there are genetics that they were born with you know it was all contrarian couldn't ask for forgiveness was you know stubborn and all these different things totally irreverent to religion but when the new birth comes to that kind of person they're quick to forgive they're loving amen you know you know they're not irreverent but they love the law with all their hearts what is that that's a paradox I mean for for God to change the nature of a person amen you're a living Paradox this morning I don't know if you realize it but you're a living Paradise so when I say God will have another Paradox I'm actually saying it's here right now amen we're not looking for something in the future but we're living paradoxes I mean and when you become a paradox you'll see a paradox more and more amen it's like in order to see a miracle you've got to become the miracle remember the greatest Miracle you'll ever see amen is not missing limbs come back I mean not even the resurrection of the dead but a converted soul from from unbelief to Faith I mean those are once walk in darkness are now walking with the Lord filled with the spirit and his goodness that is the greatest Miracle because that is an eternal Miracle remember Lazarus was raised but he had to die again isn't that right amen so that was incredible that would have been amazing to see I would have loved to seen that but yet Lazarus still had to go by the way of the Grave amen but on the day of Pentecost amen when the spirit of God came down into the into the disciples that was the greater Miracle because they passed from Death to life sure their natural bodies died but they didn't die amen they just changed remember death is just a travel bus to get us to where we want to go I mean to live is Christ but to die is gay in the Apostle Paul said amen so we shouldn't fear death we shouldn't fear the unknown because we know where we're going amen it's a paradox I mean for a people to walk upon the earth I mean but to know that there's a heaven to know there's a real there's a real heaven with a real Jesus that we're going to live in and it's more real than this world that's a paradox because with our five senses we can't look into the Unseen even even NASA and all of its telescopes and things it can't look into the Unseen World all the technology of this world could not look into the Unseen realm but that unseen realm was far more real than this one yeah so it's a paradox for a people to look actually to the Unseen by faith and see actually I have a theophany body I have an eternal body in the heavens waiting for me I have a real heaven I'm going to I've got a seat at the wedding supper table that's a paradox when God anchors that in your heart Hallelujah you become a living paradox Amen brother bran would say in the breach message amen he said John must have got real happy because John looked beyond the curtain of time when those seals were broke he says John must have looked in and seen past the curtain of time and said oh there's John Hallelujah well I said John store himself beyond the curtain of time already amen he must have got real happy and that's what happens when the word comes open God's actually telling you you're already there amen you may be in this Earthly Journey but you're already there hallelujah amen why because we're sealed to the day of our Redemption Hallelujah that's a paradox if you're unhappy I trust you get Happy by the end of the service hey man if you're going through a lot of trials in life I trust that they'll won't mean so much to you anymore after the service I remember you'll go out of this place rejoicing saying Thank You Lord amen you've brought me this far you're not going to leave me Hallelujah amen see it is unreasonable to think that it's actually faith is all that God looks at and that's what pleases him it's unreasonable to the human mind yeah why because the devil's made all kinds of religions with all kinds of works you know they you know the poor Catholic people think if they do their penances and they say they say they're Hail Marys they go on pilgrimages and they go rub these bones of Satan whoever and do all these different things they get less time in purgatory I feel sorry for them they're sincere they're devout they wanna they don't want to be in purgatory any longer no Purgatory is made up we know but they believe it right but they don't realize that it's actually Faith it's actually what you need a revelation yeah amen and because the Bible says in Hebrews 11 and 6 but without faith it's impossible to please him she just take the opposite but with faith it's impossible not to please them right Hallelujah you become a living Paradox where it's not your works that please God remember this is not like a coffee card program well you know you buy none and get a free coffee you know well Lord I've prayed long enough I've listened much and I've done all this therefore Lord I'm entitled to a miracle this is not how this works no faith is what pleases God because Faith looks beyond circumstances remember faith is not based on how much money you have or not or the or how well your body is or how your family is doing or whatever more faith is not based on those things faith is independent of all those things and if we could realize that faith is independent of those things that our joy of the Lord doesn't come from what our our natural senses declare I mean because my natural senses may God my bank account say well there's a lot of zeros there right but that doesn't get me down right or fight you know you know so so My Five Senses shouldn't dictate to me my joy in the Lord my faith should dictate to me my joy in the Lord but you see this this age is a very self-absorbed age it's the age of selfies in me and me me me me and I I iPhone I life iCloud all these eyes see nothing against Apple but hey you know Samsung's just Android you know whatever but you know but it's all about me and you know it's an obsessed generation and and the more obsessed people become the less happier they become because they see their faults their failures sure we all have them hey man praise the Lord we're still going to be in these bodies these bodies need changing praise God I think the older we get the more happier we are these boys have been changed not because we age but because we see our failures you don't begin to realize man this guy Lord you must really love me praise the Lord hallelujah but you see now this is why amen when we can look Beyond and see that our joy and God isn't based on how well or sick or rich or poor whatever it's not based on those things but it's actually based on the Lord saved us he's he saved me to keep me he's redeeming by his blood amen I'm one of his I mean then we can rejoice in any trouble and that's a paradox I think yeah you know you think about Jonah Jonah was a paradox in the valley of oil he was there you know you see the kids cartoons and plays and things of Jonah and the well and you know he's got like this much belly to walk in he's walking around that Wells belly I don't think it was like that at all he would have been because you know he would have been played squished up like this for three days and nights you know he didn't have a lot of legroom and stuff he would have been squished in like this fishing seaweed and everything total Blackness had no idea where he was but yet but yet he became a living Paradox because by faith he ignored the whale's belly and it was pushing him like this and the squeezing him and you know doing all kinds of stuff would have been real yuck you know the seaweed round his neck and all these things brother man talks about but he became a paradox because he looked beyond the whale's belly he looked beyond himself he said Lord I'm going to pray once more to your Holy Temple and he didn't have a GPS you know there's uh apps I don't have my phone here but you know there's apps you can get that show that where the stars are and everything in the heavens so and and then even you know you know I imagine the Muslims would have one for where the cabalers and Mecca and I can find exactly where it is and so you know if it was Jonah was today he would have had an app on his phone they said now where is the temple and he couldn't no but he didn't do that it was by faith he looked well so he became a paradox many many Israelites no doubt would have said well the well Jerusalem's this way so I'll pray this way but they wouldn't be praying in faith this is the mental it was reasonable now we'll pray physically this way but Jonah by faith became a paradox and God heard his prayer and he got released out of whale's belly Hallelujah but you see in order in order to be see in order to see a paradox we must become a paradox or if you're a Believer you already are a paradox see It'll become in order to take a Rapture to see the dead in Christ rise it'll be the biggest Paradox the world has ever seen now we just on um you know on Tuesday there was Anzac Day we commemorate the you know the for yeah you know the anzacs you know with the you know new zealanders they first fought in Gallipoli then the Western Front and we know this nation to a lot of you probably doesn't mean a lot but you know in this nation the Anzac Day means a lot because it's part of our founding um founding events of this of this country as we know it where where New Zealand soldiers would fight actually under the command of New Zealand uh officers are not under the British now we know that they went to Gallipoli and the campaign was was and you know absolute failure where where they had one last push you know when you go look at the papa they're the uh uh exhibition they had one last push to take The High Ground of China and and it was actually the Wellington it was actually the Wellington the Battalion that took that hill and they and they held it for as long as they could but they lost so many men they were relieved by by actually some British and unfortunately the the um the the Turks had a counter-offensive and they're pushed off the hill and um after that failure they knew that they couldn't actually take that high ground and take the peninsula so so they had to withdraw but a big part of that failure was actually friendly fire from from British artillery so so the Wellington Battalion they took China beer but then it was actually the British artillery which actually took out their commanding officer who was a Christian man and you know you know all those kind of things happen now I say that because because we are on our way upper mountains we're here to take a high ground you know to climb a mountain where you know you go from faith and patience and virtue and knowledge and all those things up to Divine love and once we reach Divine love then the resurrection happens when the church is full of divine love charity right I mean so there's a hill that we must climb amen and possess that High Ground now the first church aimed at that High Ground I mean they pray you know you know you know they were they were determined Amen to to take to to press the mark of the high calling in Christ they believe they were going to be that generation that would see the dead in Christ race amen when the Apostle Paul wrote to the Thessalonians he wasn't saying you know two thousand years later this is going to happen he said we which are alive and remain I believe the Apostle Paul actually when he when he's inspired to write that the we he said I rejoicing saying that's me I mean but he didn't realize he was the part of the Dead in Christ was going to be he was going to be that part of that fulfillment so the church there in the Ephesian age they aimed at taking that high ground but because they were anointed Amen to actually Unfortunately they lived out their name of aiming at and to relax that's what if um Ephesus means to aim at but to relax so they anger that high calling but they relax and eventually they drifted and then eventually went went down to a dark age but God said he will restore and then now at this end time we've come back again amen and now we're not at the bottom of the hill we're actually right at the top amen but the devil doesn't want us to take the summit amen he wants to do every counter-attack he can aiming to push us off the summit when we start fussing we start fighting amen we just we just throw away any kind of Christian love any kind of forgiveness that's what he wants he wants us he wants us to be fussing and fighting holding grudges full of metals and strife and envy that's what the devil wants us to be amen and and if he can get us to be that way then what happens is we actually begin to retreat because hurt people Retreat within themselves right they can still be Christian doesn't mean we're not saved doesn't mean we're not going to Rapture but hurt people Retreat within themselves amen but God wants to work a paradox where where our hurts don't Define us but he defines us our identity is in the Lord our identities and our freedom in Christ Our identity is not in Friendly Fire and you know barrages of gospel malice and strife and all those things and pain to the past those things don't Define us he defines us amen amen so you know brother Brown would say that every age could only live according to their anointing so so when you go into the martyrdom age of the ox anointing there you know you know the Believers actually gladly gave themselves as a Living Sacrifice to be burnt at the stake to be tortured all those things they're anointed to overcome to go through that and give their lives they could only live according to that anointing but now just like the first age they can only live according to their anointing they couldn't actually aim at and become because the anointing of the age but now we can only live according to our anointing yeah and our anointing is an eagle anointing amen we can look from eternity to Eternity where we're not going to aim at and relax and then drift we're going to aim it and become because we're anointed to become it amen hallelujah just like unfortunately there you know the anzacs could never take chanukbir they could never take the high ground but we're anointed to take the high ground and now High Ground is not someplace in Turkey there but our high ground is a resurrection amen holu is to climb the summit here amen that's what we're anointed to do but it will take a paradox to do it amen because the enemy's weapons are very natural weapons amen sure he may be spiritual but he'll use natural unforgiveness natural pains natural hurts natural misunderstandings and he'll use those things to try and get us to withdraw within ourselves and just function as as Believers but not pressing forward but friends it's time actually to jump out of the trench and charge amen why it'll be a paradox amen but amen we can Quinn every fire he died of the enemy we can we can actually deflect every blow yes Hallelujah but it takes a paradox to do it what is that Paradox where we can turn the other cheek I mean we can actually forgive amen it's a paradox actually not to hold a grudge it's a paradox not to in this age where where we're so connected with social media what does social media do you can murder someone's character all around the world with one tweet or one post or one Instagram thing it makes it so easy to do that but it'll be a paradox for people not to fall into that trap and not do it yeah because it's unreasonable to hell because we are actually swimming against the tide of culture Hallelujah and it's a paradox that'll take us to do it Hallelujah amen so I I believe I'm looking at the people that are going to take The High Ground and not just take it but hold it amen until we get extracted hallelujah amen praise the Lord why because we're living by the anointing of the Holy Ghost to do it now Samson was inspired to pick up that Jawbone you think about that he always breaks the flax there and no doubt he begins looking around for a weapon because the Philistines are shouting at him that you know they're all around him but he's inspired maybe there was rocks there maybe there was bits of wood maybe different things but he's inspired not to pick up a rock but to pick up a Jawbone yeah I mean see because now naturally it did not look like a weapon it was not a weapon to face men that had bronze brass helmets and Shields and things as brothers I read that quote it just would have smashed the pieces the first blow but the thing is God looks beyond the outside amen he doesn't look at the outside man he looks at the inside man yeah amen God never looks on how tall we are how strong we are how well we can talk our vocabulary he doesn't look at any of those things everybody looks at the human heart that's why God being the god of paradoxes uses us to show his paradoxes I mean because he wants to show us that actually we are not built I mean we are not Believers because of anything we can bring we can just bring a Hallelujah as we as we read amen lift up our hands and praise him again and again Hallelujah see Moses and Pharaoh looked at the same people they looked at Israel as slaves Pharaoh just saw slaves he just saw a tool to build some monuments you know he didn't see people he didn't see Egyptians he didn't even see you know he saw people he valued less than his horses or as or as prized positions they were just tools if they died while they died that's just a lost Widow it's not even accountable who cares about them but see Moses looked out the same window Pharaoh did but he saw God's promised people amen he saw God's children now that to me is a paradox where naturally they look like man they're defeated their God has left them they're useless they're just nothing more than slaves but to look at them and say this is God's prized possession this this is God's chosen ones from all the Earth these are God's chosen people amen and Moses looked at them and saw these people will fulfill God's promises amen so that was a paradox but now there's also a paradox for Moses when you think about him he was 80 years old when God called him and normally when people are 80 years old that's when they really stayed in their ways they always do what they've always done then they get into a real routine right but it was a paradox for God to call them at that age not at a young age right so so that was himself was a paradox as God was going to make him the Paradox and then do a paradox through him just like he does you and I he makes us the Paradox whatever age we are and the and the manifests of paradox through us I trust you're with me this morning amen see Moses saw God's promised people and it was unreasonable but yet it was true right Moses went down one-man Invasion imagine him turning up at the turning up at the Customs border there when he's going down into Egypt you know he's filling out the form you know what's your purpose of travel visiting relatives well yes that's true business conference is kind of business trip other and he writes Invasion he gives it to the passport by the Customs guy Stone Face reads this he just thinks crazy old man stamp stamp enjoy your stay he's probably I'm going to enjoy my stay you know one-man Invasion 80 year old man with a staff in his hand I remember the thing is he did it it was a paradox I mean one one spear one even little rookie recruit with a sword could have ended the whole thing Egyptian Soldier I mean could it but it was a paradox he went in there amen and he delivered a million odd people however many it was that itself was a paradox hallelujah amen amen now see on the outward Pharaoh did not realize what these people were capable of I mean because because when God saw them he he saw his promised people now outwardly Caleb and Joshua looked like any other men yeah you know they were slaves they had their Huts they had their food like anyone else they had their work they had to do but on the inside of them was a paradox I mean there was a paradox on on the inside of Caleb and Joshua because on the inside of Joshua was a faith to stop the Sun and the Moon I don't know how it happened I just believed it did I don't know the science behind it or the mechanics but I believe the Dynamics of it it really happened amen so so within it was a paradox to make that happen amen within him was a paradox to give his life over to the captain of the host of the Lord to follow his battle instructions to Cross Jordan amen and take Jericho amen and do all those things that was a paradox it was a paradox where God told them no one will be able to stand before you all the days of your life that's a paradox he was unbeatable Joshua was unbeatable you think of General's great you know great generals that fought battles they never you know there's very few that had a record like Joshua that didn't have the equipment to actually have the invasion in the first place but he did it yeah yeah it was a paradox you know we think about us we look at the natural things we have amen but really God is our supplier God is our God is the material Giver amen remember Joshua did not have Siege equipment he didn't have you know I don't know if he did it but maybe he was looking at all of his weapons and stuff before they crossed Jordan they knew they were going to Jericho if I'd gone to the Armory yeah he walks in hey what do we have do we have a battering ram sorry do we have any ladders This Tall maybe they had a couple of ladders okay do we have do we have any um assault Tower things no do we have catapult that probably say what's a catapult yeah they had nothing to take that City they had nothing right and many times we go to battle we think we have nothing but we have the one thing we need which is the Lord Jesus Christ he will make something out of nothing I mean so he knew that God would give them the victory but he just had to seek the mind of the Lord until he found how God to do it I mean you know how God would charm that's why he went out was meditating he was praying no doubt oh great Jehovah God he told me as as you were with Moses you'll be with me now here's this obstacle I can't I've got to take the city it opens up the whole Promised Land amen but how can I take this city and when he is singing on The Lord that's when the captain of the house of the Lord came down to say I've come to take over this whole campaign not just this battle but the whole of your walk the whole of your walk with me I'm going to take over the whole thing and that's what God does when he comes down into your life he's not just to help you he's here to take over is it a take over your human battle take over all the Temptations All the Troubles all the things you'll go through he's come to take it over and not just for one instance but for every instance until you leave this earth Hallelujah for so it's a paradox now Caleb Caleb was probably the biggest paradox in that whole story me don't think you know Josh was stopping the Sun and the Moon to think no no Caleb was to me the biggest paradox Caleb wasn't even an Israelite he was a kennesite he wasn't even part of Judah he was he was a gentile and his name Caleb means dog so God is going to show a paradox and a man who's called a dog who's not even an Israelite oh look this is how God works I mean so here's Caleb no doubt maybe he's growing up he was a hard dog throw him a stick you know make fun of him but God was showing even someone who's called a dog a paradox is gonna happen and that's why the woman the seraphenician woman who came to Jesus his daughter was grievously vexed with the devil oh son of David have mercy on me and your other disciples saying they're calling after us and Jesus says send her away and you know but but she had a faith to work a paradox amen and yo and Jesus even called her a dog so it's not meat to give the bread or whatever to the dogs you know but she said yay Lord but even the dogs get the crumbs from the table it was just a crumb of a blessing liberated her daughter I mean how much more life that God gives us amen of His blessings and his goodness what can it do amen so you know here was here was Caleb he was called a dog see God's joke I'm going to use a dog I'm going to use those who are not the princes of the world I'm not going to use the great ones to work my Paradox see Caleb and Joshua they saw the same Giants they saw the same land they saw the same troubles amen but you know yeah so so they could have agreed with most of the other 10 spiers report but what they disagreed with us is is the other 10 spy said no we can't take it Caleb and Josh said no doubt they would have been tearing out there here what do you mean Brothers what do you mean we can't take this land we're more than able to take it because God's given it to us amen so that would have been you know so so now for 40 years Caleb was a walking paradox he had tasted the land he had had the grapes he had seen it you know I believe when he was walking through the land something spoke to him said that mountain yeah that's my Mountain not just any mountain that one's mine I mean that Mountain's mine so for 40 years no doubt he'd tell his family what do you think was a dinner conversation it wasn't about the sand and the and the manner and what this other tent's doing and this tribe's doing this and these fusses going on here in the church this is going on you know troubles are like sand they blow in and they blow out yeah and they blow in and they blow out what's the best thing to do open the if they blow in just open the other side of the tent let them blow out so trouble come to the head you know what sister a brother so-and-so didn't this person said this troubles coming in you just opened the other side of the tent how do you do that father forgive them they don't know what they do I love them we're part of the same body it just blows out that's a good thing to do but some people they just let sand collect in their tent let it blow out let the Holy Ghost just blow it out this morning I mean let them let them take all those things away but see Caleb see Caleb was living in the same place everyone else was living but then in his tent there would have been such an anointing I believe of faith children Hallelujah no doubt they say I know what pops is going to tell us tonight you know I crossed that Jordan I saw the green fields I saw I saw what what was promised to Abraham I was walking on the same ground Abraham was walking on though he wasn't my father something in me says I'm a child of Faith like he's the father of the faith honey and I was walking there around in the promised land amen I saw the fields I Saw The Meadows I saw the streams I saw these things but then when I saw a particular Mountain something said that's your Mountain dad tell us about that what's the city like well it's got big walls it's got big doors why is that because it's got Giants there yeah yeah amen the sons of Anika there see God wants to work a paradox many times the devil sits on your biggest blessing he will sit on your biggest blessing now if you let him drive you away with discouragement he'll stay there but if you have in your heart no that blessing's mine that promise in the scripture's mine doesn't matter what devil tries to say it's not for you those days of Miracles have passed God doesn't move like that anymore there's too many people in the church we can't have a holy ghost meeting anymore get that out of your head I mean God is still God he's a god of Miracles he'll work a paradox if we let him work a paradox I mean so yo Caleb remember he's he's old he's not a spring chicken anymore you know he's getting up in age he was about 80 odd years old when they crossed the Jordan to take the land but for all this time he's saying give me my mountain give me my mountain and maybe his children were going to think man he's just praying the same old prayer thank you Jesus thank you Jehovah thank you for my inheritance in the Promised Land but it was a paradox because he got it he got it now he would he would be he would gain an inheritance among the children of Judah this is what it says in Joshua 15 and 13. now Judah means praise it's important when you think about where people are placed yeah he would he did not get a he did not get inheritance among the tribe of Manasseh Manasseh means causes to forget like like Gideon was of the tribe of Manasseh Gideon means a mighty warrior but he had forgotten who he was and why because he's living under his tribal name because because when the angel came to him yo he's threshing wheat he says get in your Mighty Man of Valor he's basically just telling him the meaning of his name but Gideon stretching wheat in secret afraid why he's forgotten who he is amen so now Judah means praise this is why this is why Caleb who's a dog a gentile dog has an inheritance among a tribe who means praise Hallelujah because when you know when God brings you in it should produce a praise Hallelujah Rahab was a moabite the law said she had she could not enter the congregation of Israel no motorbike could amen but Grace overshadowed the law and then she married to Boaz who was of the tribe of Judah Hallelujah now now Rahab no sorry Ruth Ruth her her mum-in-law and dad-in-law their names together mean Pleasant worship so when they came into Moab they saw Pleasant worship being lived out I believe it drew her and it actually carried her through when when they died her husband died all those things happened right so now she saw Pleasant worship but then now she came into Judah begin to manifest praise why because Grace allowed her to come in amen Rahab Rahab became part of the tribe of Judah Hallelujah why what happened the token was applied her family came in the walls were destroyed Amy what did it do it generated priests I'm free I'm not stuck in this prison anymore I'm not under a death sentence anymore I found Mercy In This Place hallelujah what happened it produces praise I trust yeah I think some of you can agree with me amen we were destined for destruction but God said no you're not going there that's not your inheritance that's not your portion and I'm going to bring you into Green Pastures I'm going to bring you to a place by The Still Waters I'm going to a place where your soul is fed which is the word of God not of not a building amen we understand that Holy and what should that produce such a praise Lord You Found Me Lord you did a paradox in my life you know I would never come to a place like this I'll be serious before I met the Lord I'd never come to a church I was very reluctant even to step into one well there's a paradigm God had to do a paradox in my life amen and bring me into a place like this praise the Lord hallelujah words so when now we become a living paradox Hallelujah praise the Lord Hallelujah now there and they're in Jericho there was a man called blind Bartimaeus and I shared a thing a bit about him last time he became a living paradox there he was blind man begging on the street Jesus was actually walking towards Calvary but yet has he began to call out when he heard the testimonies of what the Lord did because remember when he was raised as a boy his Mum would tell him about Joshua and Caleb and Elijah and Elisha and all the and Rahab all the great things that happened in his City and said that same Jehovah God is alive today amen so he had that in his heart believing actually God is still God and then when he heard that big tumult of Jesus going by because there's always noise where Jesus is you know some people were crying out Hosanna and praise God and God's visitors you know how amazing this is others were crying out your beelze above get away from this fellow have nothing to do with them and you know this is a great bunch of noise going on and blind butter May has heard this tumult go past him and and it had already gone past him by the time someone said to him actually answered him because he's saying what's going on what's this noise who's going by he heard a lot of other people go by before but this was different I trust when Jesus comes by your way you realize this is different amen this is not just another day this is your day Hallelujah so now here he was you're crying out someone began to say to them oh blind bottom ass you know there's noise that you're hearing it says Jesus of Nazareth amen that's going by maybe he'd ask you know what did this Jesus do why is this all this about him and what's going on and people crying out son of David all these things and you know this person we're going to testify to him Lazarus was dead four days he came back to life you know the dead you know you know death can hear the blind can see all these things we can realize this is Messiah walking past me amen this is the son of David amen here's a living Paradox coming by this is the god of Joshua the god of Elijah the god of Elisha the god of Rahab amen was walking past him and then so he began to cry out and people say shh be quiet you know you're just causing too much of a fuss but he cried out all the more the Bible said but it was actually his faith sometimes you've got to be noisy for Faith to project right sure you can be quiet but sometimes you've got to really cry out get next to yourself amen let God take over amen so and then in the Bible says then Jesus Stood Still so his faith caused the son to stop just like with now now Joshua's Faith caused the s-u-n to stop but brother man says it was the same kind of faith that Joshua had is the same kind of faith that blown by the man's had I mean because one one stop the natural sun and moon amen but now here is a faith that stopped the Son of God greater than the son amen but the one that the sun symbolizes was upon the earth and the same Faith Joshua used to stop the Sun and the Moon blind Bartimaeus had to stop the son on his way to Calvary that he would meet his need amen because many times think isn't that incredible the sun and the moon will stop but you know you're saying Faith the same Faith you have actually causes Jesus to stop and hear your petition and meet your need and answer your prayer Hallelujah I'm looking at a people who are living Paradox as much as Joshua was why because we have the same kind of faith I mean when Jesus is walking through seven Church ages right I mean we're here in the end of the lady of cnh he's walking from here and he's going to keep walking up into Glory what in his bride His Holy Ghost is going to lift off the Earth amen because he's you know in Book of Revelation he says I sort of like the son of man walking among the seven golden candlesticks that wasn't the physical body of Jesus walking through seven Church ages it was him Christ and the people walking through seven Church ages so he's walking the son of man is walking through this age on his way to a rapture but then your faith says have mercy on me I see the world is falling apart I see your troubles on every hand nuclear war is going to happen there must but there must be Mercy in this place for me while judgment's about to fall what's happening causes him to stand still go get him holy boy because Jesus called blown by the mass to come to him Hallelujah as we heard they're an Easter he dropped his biggest garment because he wouldn't need it anymore amen hallelujah then he walked away being able to see what happened he became a paradox Amen in the same Faith Joshua had amen blind Bartimaeus had he didn't he didn't stay blind bottom ass he was just bottom ass from then on Amen see you see how physical condition shouldn't Define us our emotional spiritual you know you know we'll be hurting our spirit but we shouldn't be hurting whatever your name is hurting brother hurting sister you know blind whatever spiritually no no we should just be our names or it should be redeemed hallelujah praise the Lord amen now so you can see the kind of people God you know David David was a man after God's Own Heart but he wasn't born perfect so you know some might think the reason David was a man after God's Own Heart because he was perfect but David wasn't perfect no he wasn't born perfect he wasn't he wasn't perfect in all of his ways that's why he was anointed no he was just a teenage boy probably being silly and everything like other teenage boys are right but his heart was he wanted to do God's will he loved the Lord that's what made the difference amen that's why you know I think when when when Jesse was um calling his calling his sons he didn't even include David he's just uh was that llamaki you know you know he he's the late one you know there's a gap maybe with the sons then there's David you know he's not even he's not even going to be he's not important enough but God doesn't look on the outward he looks at the heart so he David was brought in he was anointed and then he was anointed and then it would say of him you know in Acts 13 22 and when he had removed them speaking of Saul he raised up under him David to be their King to whom also he gave testimony said I have found David the son of Jesse a man after my own heart which shall fulfill all of my will Hallelujah and that's actually why God has anointed you and I am we've been anointed by a Vindicated word amen I mean we've been anointed by the Holy Ghost right what does that do why because God looks beyond this God even looks beyond how we perceive ourselves and he actually sees the people that have have a heart that all of his will would be done not just a part of his will not just saying a sinner's prayer and continuing waiting on and sin but those who want all of his word fulfilled Amen to repent be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ receive the Holy Ghost dress in a hole in this way all those different things it's our heart that boy because it's in us to fulfill all of his will Hallelujah amen but you see David became a paradox because we know we know that Israel was all eye for an eye tooth for a tooth right it's all about revenge and David had opportunities to kill Saul but yet he became a paradox because he realized that he wasn't looking for kingship but God anointed him to become king and if God had raised not to become king then God will actually cause Saul to be taken off the scene he doesn't physically need to put his hand to it to get rid of Saul now that is a paradox praise the Lord amen he became a living Paradox why because well you know because he began to think differently to how man naturally thinks remember his men said now's your opportunity he's asleep you can pin him to the ground with his own spear finish the whole thing you should be king God anointed you King and then no no David thought well you know he's taken my wife McCall from me he's killed the priests I've been on the run all these years I've had all these troubles most of the Psalms when he's crying at us because Saul's after him right all that pain would be actually would actually produce praise in his life yeah we can draw strength from his pain praise the Lord my God my God why is our forsaken me all these troubles now my enemies are around me and yeah you know my pillows wet with my tears all these things he experienced those things he lived out the sound before he wrote it down but God but but you see he became a paradox because those things didn't him they made him stronger and because because it made him stronger we can draw from that strength because remember when all those things were going on it wasn't David being manifested it was Christ and David being manifested that's why the Psalms are not really the Psalms of David they're actually the Psalms of God Hallelujah it should be the same things with us that now when pain comes into our life we give it to God it actually becomes a strength to someone else right hardship comes an excessive Christ is manifested out of our lives praise the lord we can become a paradox I mean just like the you know Gates of the gates of the city I'm gonna I'm gonna kind of wind this up soon about Too Close you know the gates of the New Jerusalem are Pearl we know pearls are made because of an irritant gets into a you know shellfish it produces a pill right so so our our irritations of life should actually just produce an entrance into God's blessings amen even if you're upset by your own personality it should just be an entrance into God's blessings glory amen everything in life should be actually an entrance into God's blessings it's not CC trials and troubles aren't designed to keep us away from God they're actually designed to bring us closer to God Amen brother Brown says if you you know if you have trials and troubles actually it's because you found favor with God glory amen job found favor with god he's a perfect man in all the Earth there's none like him that was God's testimony of Joe and what happened he had the biggest trial probably anyone's ever had in their whole life why because he found favor with God see you know you know God didn't say to Satan well I hope you didn't see job when you're walking along I'm embarrassed of my son no he's a perfect man he pointed him out God pointed him out to the devil hallelujah amen what but but job became a living Paradox amen the Hebrew children and the furnace they became a living Paradox but the Paradox to me was incredible which was unreasonable but yet true well that's just the definition was that was that they said well if we burn we burn if not well but we're still you know if God Saves us yes praise God if not was done we're still not going to bow humanly that was unreasonable because basically Nebuchadnezzar was saying them boys I'm going to give you another chance I like you you're very valuable to me I've trained you I've put a lot of energy into you and look what you're doing to me you're making me look silly yeah I'll give you another chance that's why he bought them before him trying to intimidate them to Bow even further but but but you know they just said well King live forever you know if we burn we burn if not God will save us but either way we're not bowing to this guy not bad to this image your your resemblance of Daniel isn't very good anyway but you know what I mean like they wouldn't that was a paradox that was incredible but yeah true and then when when I went into the furnace what happened they just had fellowship with the son of man with the Son of God hallelujah amen so I brought God down into the trial I mean Daniel in the Lion's Den was a paradox why because those lions were hungry they were they were they just eat people but yet Daniel God closed the mouths of those lines for Daniel to use a lion's mane as a pillow I mean it was and it was a paradox why because Daniel himself was a paradox first because he has a paradox because when he went to when he went down to Babylon he says I'm not going to defile myself with the king's meat I'm going to make my stand early and this is just how I am and he wouldn't compromise on anything amen so so he was a paradox first because it would be reasonable we've got to fit in look we're slaves our our country is destroyed we're Exiles here now we've just got to adapt and just survive and you know but Daniel said no no no no I'm a I'm a Hebrew I'm a son of Abraham I'm not doing what they do sure I have to learn their language sure I've got to you know know their customs and see how they operate but I'm not going to be partakers of what they do he became a living paradox praise the Lord aren't you glad you know if a man under the blood of bulls and goats in Exile can do that how about you and I with the Holy Ghost hallelujah amen God always gives us overcoming power hey man now there's another Paradox I'll just finish with this one I just finished with this one we live in Satan's highest achievement of civilization he has spent six thousand years I think making this world everything is made upon this Earth especially in the first world it's all in the third world now anyway to entice people to live in sin and unbelief this is what this world this world has been designed see this world is not a mistake this thing's not a mistake you know just like the printed printed word is not a mistake God ordained this at a certain time right right translate into English at a certain time you know brother brahma's first words you know recorded well we've got these new recording gadgets because they had just released the technology for recording from the military it was on wire recording it wasn't a mistake he said that first because the voice in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery God shall be finished so it's had to be the days of his voice so the voice had to be recorded yeah so so all that all this technology is here it's not a mistake but the devil wants to use it to entice people to Blind them amen to what is actually happening upon the Earth so this is Satan's Eden he's actually put a lot of effort into this he's he's done a lot of hard long days sleepless nights to actually produce this world and we are built the same way as the rest of humanity hey we're still human okay yep some people still believe that I probably say at every service sometimes yeah we are still human we're going to realize we're human we cannot defeat the Devil with our mind we can't outsmart him he will always outsmart us amen the only way we can ever defeat him is by the anointing of God by the word of God that's the only way we will ever win we'll never win in your own ability well I've seen this before I know what to do no no no you should be on your knees saying Lord you delivered me once now deliver me again Lord I've seen your hand here and I want to see your hand here Lord I need you more now than I ever need you in all my days amen that's how we should be Lord I just need you more amen so then that's the only way we'll win if we keep that almost a desperation Lord I won't let you go till you bless me Lord I need more of you in my life Lord I want to see you live I don't want to live off just testimonies of years ago right but you're the same today we'll come live today this is what I need hallelujah amen so he's made the Satan's Edom it's to ensnare the whole world as it says I think in habakkuk one of those books there's a net that they worship to actually goes around the whole world and draws them in we have a we have the internet yeah it's actually entire it traps people in a web of social media and games and different things it traps people yeah right so the devil's made this world thinking I've got Humanity but the thing is he looks on the outward he doesn't see the gene seed of God that's placed in us and we can be up until our eyeballs Beyond and all those things you're going to be in the biggest gamer the biggest movie fiend drunk drugs whatever more you can be up to hearing it but God says I'm not afraid of what you can do devil I'm not intimidated by what you can put in front of my children amen if there's a seed there they're coming out holy if there's a seed there they can't stay there they must come out like the woman of the well no doubt the devil thought you know maybe the devil thought he doesn't need to send his imps to her anymore he's got her you know five husbands one she's living with they're not married all these things life is ruined the devil thinks I can just leave her be just like the thief on the cross well he's gonna die he's going to come to hell I've used him all these years as a thief and doing all horrible things to people maybe the devil thought I can just leave him there to die but God knew where that would be God knew the condition that be when when he would meet them you know God doesn't ever Panic if we step actually Into Darkness I can say if you're his You're Gonna Come The Prodigal Son you see how the father treated the son when he came home to me that's all Grace and I believe the father would have treated him the same way when he left amen so now the father had confidence my son's going to come home sure he's going to be like he's dead he's going to come back alive we're going to Rejoice but he's going to come home Hallelujah that's why when we pray we shouldn't pray out of fear we should pray out of Faith see job offered the lamb out of fear for his children he should have been off but at least he offered it right at least he prayed for them so I'm not saying don't pray if you're if you're scared pray anyway but don't pray out of fear oh Lord what's going on it should be Lord you're more than able to get them wherever they go whatever they do I believe goodness and mercy Lord send it on their Trail and bring them home to you amen because I'm not looking Lord on what I see what I hear how they treat me I'm looking to your word and that will produce a paradox and we stand on his word alone and produces a paradox amen God does incredible things amen hallelujah so there they were woman of the well man on the cross but yet God said I see my seed in them they've got to come they were up to here in darkness but it doesn't matter how deep we are if there's life God will bring it out amen hallelujah so here we are in this age the devil's spent all this time brother Bram calls it this is Satan's Eden this is his paradise that he's made amen but now if you think now this is such a paradox where the devil has made this Eden but yet God can reach through all of his Darkness get a hold of you and I it doesn't matter how deep we are in it amen pull us out and then we become a living Paradox but yet we are not taken out of his Eve and we're still living in the Eden so we're still walking in this world it's getting worse and worse but this but God has done such a work in our hearts there's nothing in us that wants it we're not caught up in the politics we're not caught up in the Civil troubles we're not caught up in the economics of the world whatever's going whatever's trending in the news actually there's nothing else we just say well I read that the other day in the Book of Revelation amen let's move on praise God we're on time lord lord you're on time you're under budget you're on schedule praise God see that's how we should be right we shouldn't be consumed by it right amen so there's something now God does such a paradox in our lives that we are not caught up in this world anymore and the devil tries to bring out greater things flash your things surely this will get them nope he'll try this doesn't work he tries this doesn't work Hallelujah what's that now it's because you're a paradox it's unreasonable to him it's unreasonable to this world but it's incredible but yet it's true Hallelujah so we are now a people being a living Paradox upon the Earth I'm just finishing with that see sometimes we think well God's not doing anything for me I say he kept you another week and Satan's Eden he kept you another week in Satan's Eden you're still walking Victorious right you still said thank you Jesus for the blood applied thank you Lord I'm safe thank you Lord you fill me with your spirit thank you Lord I'm still a believer in spite of everything the devil see see a man man or woman can live so close to God that even the devil doesn't know what to do with them he'll send sickness he'll send trouble he'll send misunderstandings hardship pain he'll try and resurrect your past and make that drag you back he'll bring everything but then the devil get to a place where he says I have run out of things in my inventory I tried it all and it just won't work you look at brother Ron Spencer he's falling off a ceiling a roof 40 feet under concrete broke every vertebrae in his back doctor said he'd never walk again he's walking right he was burned up in a propane fire 80 something percent of his lungs destroyed but then he was in a meeting where where um where there's preaching and and someone was preaching about chaos coming out of all I mean order coming out of chaos and he stood up said this is my moment and then he said he felt like his column of air come up come over him and he's got brand new lungs and he's and he's had Strokes he's had snake bites he's been struck by lightning twice all these different things now he's got stage four cancer over three years ago the doctor said you're gonna die are you still alive he's still preaching he's a living paradox amen and if God can get a hold of him and the devil can try every trick in the book against him but yet he's still standing loving the Lord how about you and I Hallelujah his life is a paradox you say well I haven't been through all those things but yeah are you still a Believer this morning do you love him with all your heart you just want more of him you're looking for his return every day say thank you Lord Jesus there's another day gone I'm a day closer to you taking me home thank you Lord Jesus another day God I'm closer to every promise amen thank you Lord hallelujah that I am the promise is on its way you're a paradox you're a paradox so that the world can't work you out it does you don't fit in their boxes Hallelujah but you fit in God's great plan amen so if you stand on his word God will produce another parity amen amen if we can just be like your bones in the hands of God God will do another Paradox what is that just be fully surrendered love him and God will be God will make you a living Paradox in a greater way hey man let's have the musicians this morning praise the Lord amen hello paradoxes how are you see the devil yo he'll tell you oh no there's nothing to this is just religion and you know going to church is just well that no we're paradoxes we are manifestations of God's Great Saving Grace amen so let's stand this morning and
