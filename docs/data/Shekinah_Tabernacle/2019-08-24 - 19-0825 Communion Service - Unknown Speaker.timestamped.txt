[32:45] a special
[32:49] [Music]
[34:07] Weston tells dead brain dead we were
[34:11] praying in their house and and it just
[34:13] came to mind that we we have promises in
[34:15] God that's out but see the bride
[34:19] we don't mind what the Lord does he does
[34:22] okay that's his will we happy with his
[34:25] will we're always happy we don't lose
[34:27] being Christian well we still have
[34:29] promises and I've been singing this song
[34:33] for awhile but just before that we
[34:35] wanted to go back to South Africa and
[34:37] and question tell wanted to be with a
[34:39] granddad and it seemed like everything
[34:42] we wanted to do was hindering it
[34:44] hindering us to go back thee and we just
[34:47] don't understand why we knew that it was
[34:49] either the attack of the enemy or the
[34:51] will of the Lord so it's hard for a
[34:53] Christian to know when is it the will of
[34:54] the Lord and when is you you under
[34:56] attack and then I started singing this
[34:59] song and I said Lord I'll stand on your
[35:00] promises and whatever comes to pass is
[35:03] in your hands so as a Christian I can't
[35:06] lose so this is just a song I want to
[35:09] sing to declare that do not give up you
[35:12] stand on these promises and the Lord
[35:14] will make everything come to pass
[35:21] standing on the promises of Christ my
[35:26] king through eternal ages ladies places

[46:10] evening I want to speak about
[46:14] I wanted I wanted to take a scripture
[46:16] where you know notice how when they
[46:19] would as I as I pointed out we were
[46:22] reading in verse 11 that you know the
[46:24] tablet lends a line skirt at the shoes
[46:27] on their feet stuff in their hand eat it
[46:29] in haste they're ready to leave and I
[46:32] and I trust that you know in your own
[46:34] heart you're ready to leave this world
[46:35] you are you know we're so thankful you
[46:37] know you just think what a privilege it
[46:39] would have been in that day to kill the
[46:41] lamb I mean to roast the lamb to apply
[46:43] the blood hallelujah I mean take Castle
[46:46] yo sweep all the living out of your
[46:48] house and and and and be ready Amen for
[46:51] that time when the trumpet will blow and
[46:54] it would be time to leave we're in a
[46:56] leaving time I mean this message it's
[46:59] really you know the rapture is really
[47:00] the secret going away hallelujah of the
[47:03] bride a menace like you know Romeo and
[47:05] Juliet you know there's one night you
[47:07] know Romeo comes along with his letter
[47:09] brother Bram says goes up to the side of
[47:11] the house gets Juliet takes her away
[47:12] it's like that it's a secret going I
[47:14] mean but the bride is not surprised when
[47:16] the bridegroom arrives because he has
[47:18] but she has been expecting him
[47:20] hallelujah and I trust when you see that
[47:22] did in Christ rise and you will Amen you
[47:25] you're the first words I trust you might
[47:26] say as I've been expecting you I've been
[47:29] waiting for you to come hello Lou you
[47:30] here you are let's go hallelujah so you
[47:33] know here we are that we have a great
[47:35] privilege this this day to apply the
[47:38] blood now we understand that to apply
[47:41] the blood in this day is is that the
[47:43] literal life of God is applied in your
[47:45] life that he comes and dwells in you and
[47:47] notice that you know as he as Moses was
[47:51] instructed they had to apply the blood
[47:54] on the two side posts of the two side
[47:56] posts the door and the lintel so showing
[47:59] that it had to be applied to your body
[48:01] spirit and soul not just a part of your
[48:03] life
[48:03] you know but your whole being had to be
[48:05] under this blood and so I'm glad that
[48:08] you know when we apply the blood today
[48:09] we applied the Spirit of God you know we
[48:12] don't just apply it to our flesh we
[48:14] don't just apply it to our spirit I mean
[48:17] but we apply it to our soul to the whole
[48:18] body I mean that our whole life comes
[48:21] and under that blood and you know you
[48:23] you know you think about you know your
[48:25] brother bound dramatizes where he speaks
[48:27] about you know
[48:27] someone comes along maybe an Egyptian
[48:29] that's friends with the Israelites say
[48:31] come on gertie we're going to go out and
[48:32] party tonight and she said no not
[48:34] tonight we're under the blood I mean
[48:36] we've heard the call and you know we're
[48:38] under this blood and no doubt the person
[48:41] who tried to get the daughter to come
[48:42] out you know come out from under the

[51:01] you'd use another one and with that same
[51:03] faith then you apply it to color the
[51:06] salvation of your house hallelujah but

[51:12] bunch of hyssop around we have a blood

[51:30] healthy they are all strong now it
[51:33] doesn't say they weren't feeble before
[51:34] Moses came into Egypt to deliver them so
[51:37] maybe they are some sick maybe some were
[51:38] on their deathbed but they when they ate
[51:41] the lamb you know you just think about
[51:43] your old grandparents or maybe some
[51:45] someone really sick in the home you go
[51:47] we're leaving tomorrow how are we going

[52:10] devil always says there's no value in
[52:12] reading him you know what his brother am
[52:14] saying
[52:14] when he's asked how do you become a
[52:16] better Christian read your Bible pray

[52:20] it makes you strong I mean so the
[52:23] opposite you get weak but the devil will
[52:26] never say hey listen read go pray go

[52:47] strength of that lamb by their sacrifice
[52:49] they left Egypt now you got to think
[52:53] about it now when when when
[52:54] when you know when when they left when
[52:57] they left Egypt every promise of that
[53:01] land belonged to them already they had
[53:04] every promise I meant their inheritance
[53:06] was already prophesied halia the cities
[53:09] of refuge you already prophesied right I
[53:11] meant where Benjamin would be where

[53:24] everything they had need of to go take
[53:26] the land they already had hallelujah and
[53:29] and going out under the blood lamb was
[53:31] like a downpayment to what they you know
[53:33] yo for the land right now you say that

[54:15] it gets to its predetermined destination
[54:17] I mean and once it gets there then it
[54:19] can come open he says it's the same
[54:21] thing with the seal of God hallelujah
[54:23] where we're sealed amen we cannot be
[54:26] unsealed till we get to the day of our
[54:27] until we get on the other land right and
