[Music] [Music] so [Music] [Music] you [Music] do [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] so [Music] foreign [Music] foreign [Music] so [Music] [Music] so [Music] [Music] so [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] you [Music] so [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] so [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] praise the lord welcome again to the house of the lord how are you all feeling this morning good so good that's the right answer and the lord we're always feeling so good regardless of what's happening regardless of what the circumstance is we are so good because you know when you win christ you win everything that's it you've won you've won the whole game of life finished done i've won this whole thing so what happens after that doesn't really matter we've won so we're all champions this morning thanks to the thanks to our champion of champions the king of kings and the lord of lords that that won the victory for us amen i've really enjoyed the ministry so far at this camp it's um if the brothers that ministered knew the things that were going on and even in my own life and things they just having everything exactly for where i'm at for a lot of things and um it's been outstanding actually you know i've often thought like you know we have these meetings and we we like to bring someone in from overseas but i've always thought that i these are my favorite guys right here man from taranaki from auckland from around the place you know it's just our mental state because we think if we get someone in from overseas and that they come in it's like oh it's going to be something you know whereas if they drive from down the road oh that's just by the sun so from down the road you know but but it's not like that in the lord i mean we need to get past that that mental block because you know when jesus went to his hometown they said isn't this just jesus joseph's son and they they didn't respect them they couldn't they didn't listen to him and and it said that because of their unbelief he could do he couldn't do very many mighty works because they they they didn't esteem him as from the lord they just sustained him as from down the road you know but that's the reason why we've been so blessed at these meetings is because i don't think our minds have esteemed these brethren from just down the road we've esteemed them as being from the lord and and and the lord's blessed us for that and we need to always keep that and the same goes with our pastors and the ministry and the the people in our fellowship when we esteem them as from the lord we get really blessed and and the fellowship any fellowship flourishes when we when we respect the the order that god's put into place and we we receive it as being from him when we don't do that i'll show you a fellowship that goes down faster than a lead ball because that's how it happens but i'm so glad that that we're of a nature that we respect ministry we we receive ministry as from the lord and if we continue to do it which we will because that's the season that we're in we're in a season of victory i really like your sermon last night bro it was really good and and i'll just hear this one thing before i have brother ben up um i've been going through a big thing at the moment and i was wondering how it was all going to happen a very big thing and um i was burdened you know when you get a burden to really find out from the lord what the answer is and then one night about two months ago i thought lord i just want to find out how do i do all this how do i get through this whole thing that that i'm doing and through the prayer a really strong answer came back and it said it's going to be different than the way you've always done it it's not going to be you trying to figure things out or work it all out or do that it's going to be a different season you just don't need to do anything it's just going to happen it's just going to be by faith and this is in a bigger sense right because we we all want to operate by faith but this in my mind i thought this is a bigger thing than just oh i'm going to try and do this by faith this is a new season of operating and i tried to explain it to shan about a month ago um and i just explained it like that but i said it's i haven't really explained it properly because it's not like by just trusting the lord and we just go on it's i think it's different than that it's like a whole new i'm not going to do things the old way of i'm changing everything how i do things that i'm not going to think about tomorrow i'm going to actually just the lord's in control of it all i was just it's i said it's bigger than just i'm going to trust in the lord it's a different thing and that's why i was so blessed yesterday because i basically thought these guys gave my answer this is what i'm talking about i'm talking about that that's the season so it was it was it was exactly what i'm going through in a in a seasonal sense too and i think all of us are becoming like that where where we are looking to the heavenlies more than the earthly you know and and we all because we're a body we all go through this together we don't one person doesn't just happen it's a it's a body work and every one of us are going through the same thing and we're in for a great time we're in for an outstanding time in the lord we're this is like the things that are happening in the world are just outstanding you know it's we're in for such a good time like the things we're going to see and experience so you hear all these passports and all this stuff like that don't worry about it it's actually it's going to make this experience all the more fun what if we just drifted on with nothing how boring would that be right life just goes on and we just work and do our thing it's not going to be like that we've got some intense pressure coming in it's going to be fantastic going to have such a good time yeah man that's the way it's going to be and and i'm looking forward to it we don't approach it with fear we approach it with faith this is our journey out you know where things are heating up to leave for us to leave and we're going to leave victorious we're not going to leave defeated we're going to leave the most victorious people that were ever walking upon the face of the earth that's there's going to be no one more victorious than what we're going to be when we leave this earth and in the history of mankind it's the season we're in that's that's the way it's going to happen so when you when you hear all this stuff on the news just be happy but i used to follow the news quite a bit but i don't really do it too much these days because i don't really have enough time but every now and then i'll say this and i just better check the news just to make sure everything's falling apart like it should be and i'll scroll through yep that's it's going down real quick that's good yep we're all on track so we don't have to have any fear there's no fear what's the worst thing that could happen to us you could die wow and that's the season we're in i'm looking forward to it i'm going to invite brother ben up with young william [Applause] good morning amen this is a family camp god's about families hallelujah where's my girls can you come up here real quick yeah put you on the spot come up here got my gates cup

every day but we're just you know having having a day out doing doing things and so i just want to say your life has a greater impact than you realize you know nothing done in the lord is in vain amen

thing have i desired of the lord that i will seek after thou may dwell in the house of the lord all the days of my life to behold the beauty of the lord and to inquire in his temple from the time of trouble he shall hide me in his pavilion and the secret of his tabernacle shall he hide me he shall set me up upon a rock this is talking about you this is your condition amen hallelujah and now shall

lord is that right he has your everything here's what holds everything together and when you are married to the lord everything about your life is held together is that right praise the lord i want to uh uh say thank you to you all for your uh welcoming spirit this morning and uh and uh the kind words that's been spoken over the last day or so to the ministering brethren here and we hold you in high regard and i just pray that the lord will be able to do something again special this morning i believe if you can understand the subject that will be brought out this morning then everything about what is going on in the world and in your own life will be completely understood um so i thank you musicians we're just going to pray let's just bow our heads precious heavenly father lord we come here lord for to glorify you lord jesus lord we're here not to follow man lord it's you doing the work everything that we see going on in amongst your your elect it's you doing it lord and i pray lord that you would come amongst us this morning lord i pray you would have the preeminences lord i'm just a man my body's weak and it's suffering a little bit but lord i pray that you'd come and burn out anything that's trying to hinder me lord jesus i pray lord god any spirit that would try to interfere this morning lord we come against it in the name of jesus christ and cast those things out that you may have the liberty lord we pray father we ask this in your name the name of jesus christ amen thank you uh musicians um if we could have the first slide up this morning we are going to take a a subject that i've already taken in various forms in our own church i'm going to do a part three this morning and this subject is a very challenging one very challenging one now the lord gave this to me about two or three months maybe three months ago and when you come to comprehend the depth of it everything that you see on the earth becomes understandable everything you see in world events everything you see in the church events everything you even see in your own self becomes understandable and so for those who are streaming in this morning don't don't look at this with critical spirits go and check it out with the message as everything i've done for the subject this morning i've done with a fine-tooth comb and i'm not a kind of guy who goes up in the pulpit and tear and just makes things up so now we're going to go and look at this heading this morning now every single person on this earth right now has been affected by the word of god whether they like to know it or not is that right and so the sanity that is coming into your life is causing insanity upon the earth say is that right man sanity coming to you is causing the world to go insane and there's something causing the world to go hysterically mad at such a rapid pace it's all from the word of god there's something that's coming out of the scriptures making them go stark raving mad but making you come completely sane so now there's an expectation over you for this hour and you must live within that expectation because we are a prophetic people we are not a people that wander around with supposition we should not be like wandering stars wandering here and wandering here and wondering in our minds we should be stable stars settled behind in relation to the north star christ himself and i'll say to you this is not an hour for negativeness negativeness puts you in the camp of the devil oh my goodness if you've got a negative thoughts about yourself you're already in the camp of the devil that's a mouth wouldn't it now we're going to read from genesis the seed book anything you see in black is up there is what i had put there for you to to look at if anybody wants the notes from this meeting go and see brother bear amen now abraham was old and well stricken in age and the lord blessed abraham and all things not some things now are you the royal seat of abraham he's not going to just bless you with some things he's going to bless you with all things is that right praise the lord and abraham said unto his eldest servant who was that eliezer who was the eldest servant come at the end time who was our eliezer brother branham came at the end time elijah to fulfill malachi 4 5 and revelations 10 7 is that right he was the chief reaper that ruth met they're right come on now we have there's some elected amends praise the lord and abraham said unto his elder servant of his house that ruled over all that he had but i he said put i pray thee thy hand under my thigh i want you to put my hand your hand where i have seed to reproduce myself from oh my this is deep stuff man god is concerned about his genetics is that right you just don't go it he didn't say put it under my armpit he's concerned about his genetics and i'll make thee swear by the lord the god of heaven and the god of earth you shall not take a wife unto my son of the daughters of the canaanites among whom i dwell he says i don't want you to go and get yourself a wife from satan's eating amen but you should go into my country what kind of a country is that the place of its origin to my kindred and take a wife unto my son isaac now the seed of abraham that god is concerned about is not god is concerned about not the natural seeds for the end time he's talking about a spiritual seat this is a seed that has representation in heaven that has a theophany waiting amen praise the lord let's just bow our heads lord jesus your word is true and we are living in such an astounding time lord and lord i pray that you come and open the book to us personally in our own personal lives lord and i pray that reality would sink into hearts about what you're doing right now i pray in jesus name amen maybe seated my goodness those seats are the noisiest seats i ever heard it just sounds like there's some ghosts around the place you know my goodness me now i can't get this gadget to go there bro okay now abraham if you want to get more information about abraham you got to go and see it as paul teaches in the book of hebrews by faith abraham when he was called to go out into a place which he should after receive receiving an inheritance obeyed and he went out not knowing where he went and so when we start out of this walk brothers and sisters when we hear in revelations 18 come out of her my people we did not know where he was going to take us to is that right well i sure did it in 1984 but god he orchestrates your footsteps and then further down the road he goes and shows you where you've come from and then you connect and know where you're going to praise the lord by faith he's adjourned in the land of promise as an estranged country dwelling in tabernacles with isaac and jacob the heirs with him of the same promise now these men these sons had the same destiny as their father now when he came out of babylon there was an action coming from another dimension oh my he was looking for a city whose builder and maker is god and if you are the royal seat of abraham you are doing the same thing because there is a positive pulling your negative into a reality because when you heard this message was eagle food you heard from your theophany the theophany did not say oh well um you've heard from me now nothing more is going to happen your theophany is magnetizing you to the scriptures to scriptural fulfillment that's why we are a people of prophecy he looked for a city his building maker was god therefore sprang the even one and have as good as dead so many as the stars of the sky and multitude and the sand which is by the seashore innumerable the ones that stand by the seashore was the natural jews but when he talked about the stars in the sky and multitude he was talking about me he knows talking about you come on now we're not sitting in church just to pay religion praise the lord god was connecting abraham to the his reality now the holy ghost comes at the end time brother branham says it goes from justification sanctification baptism of the holy ghost to the person of the holy ghost so the person of the holy ghost comes to connect you to your reality and that is why he says in the sermon things that are to be i think it was he says you are this is matching time you are being matched by the holy ghost to your reality is that right this is reality time he said this world is not even real we're just passing through saints [Applause] we're pilgrims on a journey we came from eternity we come down through time our gene was put in a period of time now we're going back to our origins by an eagle anointing that lifted the darkness off of your life i still broke over you and the light went through the darkness and touched the gene on the inside of the soul praise the lord and god has been lifting the seals off of your life breaking away the earthly bringing in the heavenly taking you in a transformation from the earthly to the heavenly that is what the holy ghost is for in this hour it's not to make you just seek that you can gusta how using a gift is to make you aware praise god oh my i'm already worn out already oh my genetics god's genetics are you god's genetics i don't want don't don't you don't look in the mirror with this uh what you think is mama and daddy's genetics that's sticking inside of you to the people looking at the earthly things and combat and trying to make it look nicer the genetics that god placed in my soul well he's just making that nice i'm not interested in just filming everything up on the outside you know god always works from the inside to the outside it's that right in exodus chapter 25 god showed moses a pattern of the tabernacle in heaven where did he start in the holy of holies is that right he didn't start on the outside he started on the inside is that right so god starts on the inside and redeems the inside and i want to tell you this body is not yet redeemed has got to be changed and the atom has a dispensation of the fullness of time which is in ephesians chapter one which is the end time because ephesians is the end time book is that right we are in a time where our atoms are going to be changed that's the expectation you talk about nuclear power man have they got nothing like what's going to happen and the servant said perhaps the woman come on now perhaps hey they will not be willing to follow me into this land must i need to bring thy son again unto the land for whence thou camest and abraham said beware that thou bring not my son there again and the lord god of heaven which took me from my father's house and from the land of my kindred which spake unto me that swear unto me saying unto thy will i give this land he shall send his angel before thee who was with brother brennan he said the mighty angel and the earthly angel are on the land on the earth at the same time and when the earthly angel left the heavenly angel did not leave and that heavenly angel was continuing the work that eliezer sparked that angel that descended from heaven the prophet said oh i like this he left his throne to come to another throne the throne of his redeemed praise the lord are you a throne are you a throne that god has calmed down too there is a throne of mercy and judgment inside god's people now call me a heretic the way that calls that's called heresy that's the way that i worship my god if someone wants to know whether the way to salvation is the way to mercy is where they're going to go to the final voice of the final age under her messenger you are the most important people on this opinion don't you ever get that out of your heads brethren because that devil will come along and try to make you think lower than what you really are and the moment that you think yourself lower than what you really are you're in the devil's territory because you're now taking negative thoughts when i come up here i come up here for a war and i come up here for a war that i ain't going to lose see well i ain't up here here here to lose not any wars brethren and you shall take a wife unto thy my son from this and if the woman will not be willing to follow thee then you shall be clear from this my oath only break not my son wither again what did that angel come to do he came to break the amnesia that's been over you amnesia comes because you have been hit by worry shock and two opinions you are born on this earth with worry shock and two opinions this whole world is full of it but the angel came to have you to look at familiar things the familiar things breaks the amnesia so the ministry must take you back to familiar things [Applause] this world is not familiar things eternity is familiar thing and that's why he said to john look up come and see the reality of yourself praise the lord there's a day breaking brethren is that right my goodness i hope we haven't started yet let the killing machine go and the servant took ten camels of the camels of his master and departed for all the goods of his master were in his hand as he rose and went to mesopotamia unto the city of naha he had the whole seven seals in his hands is that right he had the whole under whole revelation from genesis to read the book of revelation and he made his camels to kneel down without the city by the well of water at the evening time at the time of the evening sacrifice at the time of the evening sacrifices when full praise comes back the seals have been open the revelation comes forth god comes down says to the angels i don't want to hear that total worship anymore i want to hear worship of the redeemed and god inhabits the praises of his peoples amen and come at the time when the woman go to draw water oh my prayer praise god are you drawing water amen at the evening time and he said o lord god my master abraham i pray thee send me good speed this day and show kindness unto my master abraham and behold i stand here by the well of water and the daughters of the men of the city come and draw out water and here was a woman that came out to the well at evening time and inside of his soul was the same dna that abraham had the same dna the same attribute and she was of the same lineage as abraham because in the old testament you married of the same bloodline and in the end time we marry of the same bloodline the holy spirit is the life of the blood when you get the holy spirit you are marrying into the same bloodline are you with me now praise the lord amen and how did rebecca respond from the voice she responded with the voice of her dna thank you lord now watch what he did he gives her a down payment before the reality of the message i should submit the reality of the marriage and he placed upon her the sign of deity he gave her a golden earring some golden the golden bracelets to hear and to serve amen now eliezer came into rebecca's house i want you to catch these things what do you represent when he came into her father's house his father recognized eliezer who he was the mother recognized who eliezer was the brother recognized who eliezer was and the maidens recognized who eliezer was but only one got married recognizing who eliezer was and is does not mean you're going to get married knowing who revelations 10 7 is does not mean you're getting married come on now we're going to go deeper with this work there's only one woman getting married who knew the purpose of eliezer hey man brethren too many people to say oh i know who brother brandon was that don't mean to amazing time isn't it amen now in genesis 24 53 and the servant brought jewels of silva and jewels of gold and raymond and gave them to rebecca he also gave her to her brother and her mother precious things they got precious things but they did not get what rebecca got steep man many people are getting blessed by elias's message but they did not get the silver redemption by marriage the gold position of deity by a marriage and they did not get a change of raiment a change of rain they got gifts they knew who eliezer was and too many people are resting on the gifts that come from acknowledging the message of the hour but they haven't come into the fullness of redemption i'm sorry i've got this out like this brethren but i ain't into mincing words so there were blessings on a family they got precious things they got gifts in that move of god but those gifts had no connection with marriage there was salvation under the message eliezer brought and there was redemption under the message that eliezer brought and salvation and redemption are two different things redemption is to bring back what god always owes back into position salvation is for many many people on this earth brothers and sisters but redemption is only for a part of god my burns don't it that's why we got to know who we are i am sweating like a dog up here at the moment she freaks out you standing now she had the journey to meet isaac that right she got that get on the camels she went on the camels to meet isaac with her on the journey was eliezer and with her on the journey was the maidens and as she's on the journey she's got one thing on her mind oh my goodness that man she's got one man on her mind but the maidens are withered too is that right they're on the journey but only a one woman is going to get married praise the lord and on that journey she's going through a transformation she's just moving from the things from her her family's place as she's moving and moving up higher coming into a relationship with the one she can see in the invisible by a vision and she doesn't know it she's been moved by two reigns did you hear what i said she's been moved by two reigns and she don't know it how would i know because in this end time two reigns have come down right now to give us rapturing faith so i can go here and i can look back and know what happened back there because everything that god did back then goes in cycles of prophecy and here we are living at the end time and there's two rains that have come down and those rains are not only affecting god's elect it's affecting the whole world i found a quote this morning that will blow you out of the water it's going to be dynamite i'll read it to you in a moment to keep you in suspenders [Applause] and type we're not getting into it yet keeps you awake and type as she's moving towards isaac the fourth seal is on the earth is that right how has come up on the earth demon powers have been loosed as she's moving towards isaac is that right she's watching the world go insane as she's moving towards isaac and she's living in the prophecy of eliezer as she's moving towards isaac she's heard what uh what elias has said and she's looking at everything going on around her as she's moving towards isaac and her theophany is affecting her at the time of the evening sacrifice there shall be light in the evening time sacrifice is that right watch this girl sister rebecca my dear friends i hope this is happening to you and rebecca lifted up her eyes when she saw isaac and the prophecy had carried her to a destination she gets off the camels and she's seeing isaac who descended from heaven and a voice is that right for she said unto the servant elijah who is this man i feel pull from this man what matters is that walks in the field to meet us when at evening time hallelujah praise the lord and the servant has said it's my master therefore she took a bail and covered her head my dear friends when you cover your face with a veil there's only one person you're thinking about is the man you're going to marry but she could see through the veil she could see through the mail world events behind the veil she's only concerned about isaac remember behind the veil all she wants to know about is isaac but through the veil she sees the world falling apart praise the lord are you getting it yet the veil doesn't make you blind to what's going on the world the veil just shelters you from the effects as you're looking towards isaac she was no longer looking at the servant she wasn't looking any more out of family she wasn't looking at the damsels that were on the journey with her but didn't go weren't behind the same veil her prophetic surroundings had carried her to him and through the lattice of the veil she could see everything everybody else can see well ask the damsels is the world falling apart damsels yes it is uh is the force seal on the earth damsel oh yes are people going and saying on the earth the devil's oh yes it is well rebecca could say well through this veil i can see the same thing but behind the veil i only want to know about isaac my dear friends if you could get that into your hearts it does not matter what is happening to this world there could be a bunch of pumpkin heads in every government on this earth for a look at isaac [Applause] [Music] okay how many networks are running this world i'm looking at isaac and that he takes care of everything so you want to take care of all your problems it's because you're not looking at isaac you're not looking at jesus christ you're trying to do this everything on your own steam because you're not looking at him all that mattered to her is that she could see him and he took her into a tent into his tent and she took a veil and put it upon the shoulder of isaac to say you are my headship when she came out of the tent she did not have that physical veil on her but she was still veiled amen because she was no longer looking at life through those old eyes she was connected to the revelation of who she was hey did you get it that is our foundation who you are in christ ain't gonna let no stupid news media or anything else like that try to talk me out of that i do not care what satan's eden says about this day and that we can't make it i'm looking at the one i'm married to and he said he would take care of me and he said he would take care of you get that into your head and never have a negative thoughts [Applause] all right we're going to talk about these two reigns if you catch this your problems are all over people say man you're a stirrer i know i do not deny it right watch these words those words mean far more than what most people realize the effect of merge reigns upon the elect and the world joel chapter 2 verse 23 be glad then you children of zion who's that that's the bride of christ is that right he said be glad he said not be sad amen is that right let's get the spelling right it says gl not s and rejoice is that what he says there was so many glum looking faces and yawning going on for he has given you the former rain moderately and will cause to calm down for you the rain when where rain comes in seasons rain comes in seasons for seed is that right there is a season you are a seed of god by election there are seasons for the seed the former rain and the latter rain in the first month or the coming together they didn't used to come together but they come together i tell you something this will uh make some fellas feel good i've been in this message for nearly 40 years what used to irritate me so much was when these young guys his young ministers ben mathen andy now there's this young guy here [Laughter] catching on ten times faster than what i did after all the hard work and labor and these guys come in and get the same portion and i'm thinking just accept it man that's god's way and when i realized that i relax myself because god's doing her work they're right so i didn't want to embarrass you the arnold he's a good man don't worry i like arnold very much now watch and the floors shall be full of wheat where do you take wheat a garner is that right the bats is this a bat i want to say this is this this a bat full of wheat it's got to go to a place you don't go and feed the wheat to the ranch you put it in a storehouse to take it to another dimension praise the lords and the vats shall be full of wine and oil oh my goodness me they're so full of revelation that comes from the holy spirit we are in a time there's no restrictions on revelation [Applause] and i will restore to you and i'm going to ripping you right back to your true origins restoration and redemption is the same thing brothers and sisters all the years that got where you were getting eaten up in your six-sealed body all the blessings that you could not access right let's go deeper now no one no one's sleeping yet that's good you never sleep in front of me brethren it's mighty dangerous now watch former rain carves at the time seed is planted in the ground to start the growth that's a natural okay but spiritually it's when the lord brings the seed word teaching to his people to start the growth brought god brought a shout to activate the seed inside of you to start the growth is that right now the latter rain usually in the old testament comes seven months after the seed was sewn see it was sown seven church ages ago now something happens the rain comes months later after the plant has grown and brings it to final maturity spiritually it brings the word seed that's already been started growing in the soul to its adoption and to its maturity now there is a principle of god and this is the thing you must understand and that's why many ministers get so totally confused now i've met a lot of confused ministers i can tell you my their pack of trouble makers a principle of god what he does on a dispensation he does on the world level a nation level a church level a family level and an individual level so there is a capstone on a dispensational level but there must be the capstone in your personal life as an individual do you understand me now so you place prophecy over all these categories as they come down to one person praise the lord now we're going to look at what the prophet says about the political economic and religious world watch these things you see we can get we can so limit god by not reading all the other quotes he says then we find also this unrest what year was that 1960 man i was only a little candid in 60 and you talked about unrest back then look at that at the whole world now everything seems to be nervous unrest the time has run out east and west has met one another now we just told you something come forward from the east and went west and has come and met it now the natural world that parallels the spiritual world now the bible said in my scripture reading there would come a day when the lord would not be caught but called be neither day nor night it's a dismal day just enough light to see how to get around that's the day we've lived since the beginning and that's all the way during the church ages it was a dismal day during the church ages she says the sun rises and the east sets in the west not a different sun the same sun that rises in the east it's in the west civilization has traveled with the sun now i said but china was the oldest civilization our first that we have record of now we're back in the west coast where east and west has met civilization has traveled with it praise the lord he says and during the time in the east when the holy spirit was poured out first was on the eastern people is that right on the eastern people and in israel he says now i'm quoting this again he says they had the first light the sun shines in the east first and the s o r n shines in the east first on the eastern people now we've had a dismal day seven church ages didn't have any clarity of understanding was the dark time but like him at the end time you don't bring light if there's already light we've had enough light to walk in enough to believe it on the lord jesus and save so he's just talking about salvation we formed churches lutheran netherlands baptist presbyterian all those great churches but we've never exactly had a promise and a ladder rain as we're prophesied to have now he's saying that in 1960 but before the seals were open oh my it's getting close now in the last days there would be a ladder rain and the former rain and the latter rain would be together now the first rain was in the east the latter rain is in the west and in the latter rain both former rain and latter will be together we are in our time my dear friends we're teaching and maturing run together [Music] so when some of these young guys start coming in and receive the former rain the teaching rain that came from the message of the hour the same holy ghost that ignited them brings them rapidly to maturity there is a rapid maturity over the earth there's a rapid maturity when amongst god's elect and it's causing the world to do the same thing brother says there's unrest there's an overlapping of the east and the west in the natural world and the east and west in the spiritual world so what was taught in the former rain overlaps and merges into the latter rain teaching and maturing comes together you can get taught something and within days stuck and you can't stop it because god's doing it but if a dirty low down teaching comes in you will go and mature into false teaching is that right now you know why ministry must be precisely accurate on the word why they had to be eunuchs they ain't meant to give seed of themself notice i'm taking it from the word of god not from brother adrian they'll watch i don't know if the techy stuff down here is going to make this work but it don't matter no it don't work but anyway it starts in the east and it goes to the west 2 000 years ago it started in the east and here we are it's in the west but when it comes out to the west as far as it can go where does it go back to the east what happens to america after it's gone as far west as it can go it goes down what's happening to china is coming up where is the message taking the most effect you do know what i'm talking about don't you uh that's how it's meant to go brethren it's turning but the tech up here was well you know we're not going to worry about that now watch here's the diagram of it you want to get it later on you can have it it starts in the east the son of man ministry where civilization started a former reign teaching in the east there's 2 000 years of teaching in the seven church ages and the church is eaten down in those seven church ages by the local uh the locust cankerworm what's first second third fourth seal here's the prophecy but at the end time there comes a cloud what does a cloud bring rain to what the siege do you understand now now he says here just stay with me because this is too important to miss out on okay a teaching on the second raid merges with the latter reign and revealed he says a strange thing our lord he was on earth he taught more of the second coming than he did of his going away he didn't talk about too much on of his first coming he was always speaking about a second coming is that right he said better than 80 of his talk was on his second coming he gave people warnings i'm just reading from the highlights if jesus talks so much uh 80 of his time on the second coming then it behooves us to to listen and see what he said would take place he says you'll hear of nation rising against nation kingdom against kingdom you'll hear of these things what's causing it to happen and said down low as he says the fig tree putting forth its buds and all the other trees and then if you watch the scriptures nearly everything he's talking about is a second coming i won't read all this out compare it now everything's on his second coming he's only one bit on his first text first coming teaching now we go back to this this this new picture here when jesus came he had a teaching to the jews and samaritans under a son of man ministry but not to the jews oh sorry sorry not to the gentiles there was a former rain moderately this coming of the son of man the first time in the east everything goes around in a circle and merges in then there's a long dry season not much rain during the church ages not much holy ghost because there's not much of the word the holy ghost is connected to the word when there's more word there's more holy ghost is that right at the end time the word was released the fullness of the holy ghost comes down is that right that's just basically i'm just a farmer trained in the cow shed that's all i know at the end time comes the visitation of the son of man again so there is emerging at the end time of the latter rain and the former rain and it's going to do a rapid work amen so there's a cloud to bring the rain now watch now just keep that picture in your mind as we flip to another quote it says written in the resume of the ages he said this age started after the turn of the 20th century as it was to be an age in which the true church would return to being the bride she was at pentecost we know that there must of necessity be a return of dynamic power down next to the next hard highlights it was not for the latter rain can only come after the former rain which is the the spring or teaching rain now you watch the pentecostals today they think that they have the latter rain they ain't got anything at all because when the former rain came they rejected it and they could speak in tongues until the cows come home they ain't got the holy ghost they've just got an anointing on them they are not converted and yet they have gifts how could this be the real thing when the teaching lane had not come the prophet messenger who was to be sent to teach the people and turn the hearts of the children back to the pentecostal fathers had not come yet so with the pentecost he says it was a mixture of the unrighteous partaking it was also was with devil power as men were under the control of devils yet no one seemed to realize it then to prove that it was not real these people even before a second generation had appeared organized and wrote their unscriptural doctrines yet anointed by the holy ghost but without the holy ghost the rain was falling on them it was falling on their spirit they thought that they were born again they were not born again because they still look like the world acted like like the world and did everything like the world now next quote i'm having actually got to the the thing i wanted to to really hit are you with me now the serious time the spoken word is the original seed it says so it is this this time in this country that that person will appear for it's a scripture and it's thus saith the lord then in the latter rain there will come a mount carmel showdown bible fulfilled to the letter john the baptist's messenger before his face and malachi 3 planted a former reign and was rejected by the churches the denominations the pharisees and sadducees in his day jesus came and had a mount transfiguration showdown this forerunner of the last days or so for the former reign this is jesus will be the showdown between denominations and creeds which is the word when he comes a showdown the rapture of his bride praise the lord now i'm just going to click through i'm not going to read this but here i'm going to show you the quote i've got this morning and it's a right hum dinger because if you noticed in the last few years things have have gone sky high with inequity now the seals have been open since 1963 it was a year that i started school and i watched the world deteriorate since then but in the last few years it went sky high hey they can't even tell the difference between a male and a female now how dumb can you get i can i can i know the difference between a male and female i won't even go in charge of 50 bucks to go and show them quick examination yourself soon find out whether you're a male or female i will i will they're a pack of insane weirdos totally demon possessed hell has come up and possessed them because of the rain now brother branham's just preached the seals he's preached the token and here it comes you ready after the seals i am looking for a time of a break forth of the spirit of god in these last days that we're now living in for another surge of the holy ghost and guess what it has come [Applause] and that is what's causing the world to go into chaos and you to go into maturity [Applause] we are in that search now [Applause] amen for rapturing faith just before it comes and everything is sitting straight in order for that but i declare to you this day prophecy has been fulfilled we are in it and the whole world is going stark raving mad because the rain is falling on the just and the unjust this is not some lying white male up here i'm telling you what a prophet said now we're going to go and just skip out a few of these things because otherwise it's going to be here till next year watch the scriptures watch the scriptures you're reading it proverbs proverbs is a parable a mystery that is revealed is that right proverbs chapter 16 verse 15 in the light of the king's countenance and that is that our kink is that the mighty android descent from heaven is that right he's come as prophet priest and king son of man priest into sitting are for thee for us and is our king the lamb has come the marriage of the lamb has come and who was the one who introduced that bride to the king it was the what was the angel with the seventh vial they're right and the angel with the seventh vial is there uh and he and a fire contains what a plague you see i see insanity coming upon the earth it's already happening but the seven vials is in the tribulation the fullness of everything is in the tribulation there's an amateur judgment on the earth right now and the light of the king's countenance is life or if i want life in this day i better look at the king's countenance [Applause] and when i look at the countenance i have his favor praise the lord i have found favor with the king amen and he's as the clown of the letter reign oh my goodness the scripture [Applause] and i saw another mighty angel descending from heaven clothed with a cloud and when he found me and he found you i found favor with him because he was connecting to his dna and i heard from my theophany because my dna was connecting to my reality i found favor in the cloud and as his face was the sun and his fetus pillars of fire and in his hand a little book open and guess what my name was found written in the book your name was found written in the book how do you know your name is found written in the book because there's a supernatural poll [Applause] at the right time right season oh somebody might be sitting in here i haven't had an experience yet with the lord don't worry there's a time in the season for each individual there's a dispensational season and a personal [Applause] season are you happy praise the lord favor means acceptance but to the world he was veiled but not to us he's not veiled to us is that right to the elected his face must become unveiled because it's the power to change into the same image the devil knows this concept of god if you keep looking and looking and looking at every garbage that comes out on the social news media you will be changed into the image of that garbage is that right and that's why you have everybody going around like a bunch of zombies fiddling around with a stupid screen all day long and what they've been is a change into the image of the idiocracy they see on the screen but god comes down with an open book and he says look on this and be changed into the image what you look at so he rips the veil off of himself rips the vial off of you and now you have a contact to look directly at your reflection bloodbath gives the parable oh i don't even gonna last oh body just needs changing look you're just gonna have to get the notes okay you're going to see brother ben afterwards there's just no way i can finish this i i'm not even 10 percent through because i've just i i'll knock off in about 15 minutes that's it your body is just talking already brother brown talked about rather than talked about the little boy in the bush you know and that little boy had a daddy who shaved in a mirror up on a tree it was a piece of broken mirror you know the story and so he watched his dad shaving in that mirror and all you could see in the mirror was his daddy's head see he only see a part of the person in that mirror and for seven church ages the bride could only see a portion of the prophecy is that right but at the end time there was an invitation to go to auntie's house in the city and so he came from one location to another location and there was a house in the city with seven steps going up into the passage which was in the house is that right and so god is taking us from a portion of understanding to see ourselves fully because in that passage at the end of the passage was a full-length mirror that shows you in all your totality you're not no longer looking through a dark glas glass darkly at yourself you are seeing the fullness of yourself but he had to go and walk up and see the image he says is this real or not don't have a walk don't go get closer boy don't get scared don't have a closer look at yourself is that right and he walked up closer and closer and he said as he waved in the mirror esther waved back as he waved in the mirror ruth waved back [Music] as he waved in the mirror hannah way back as he waved in the mirror abraham waved back and he looked in the mirror all the female attributes of god ways back and was seeing his walk her walk from genesis to revelation the footsteps of the righteous are ordered by the lord though i fall though i fall in my flesh i should not be cast down the bible says and romans 8 he says when you have come to receive the spirit of god there's no more consciousness of sin now get it now know what consciousness means no more desire you can still fall is that right you can still fall over because you're flesh but there's no more desire and what happens when you fall over in your flesh get back up again stop grizzling all right get back up again and one john chapter one he says uh if you he says if a man says he does not sin he's a liar and one john chapter 3 says a man cannot sin because the seed remains so he's talking about the outside man can sin and if you say this does not sin you're a liar but if you say this sin you cannot sit in here because the word is inside here so this sins and forms over get back up god's looking at this tell it to the devil don't let a negative thought come into your heart brothers and sisters oh look what he did look what he did if god don't remember it why should you the devil keep reminding you every time you find special you young fellas i know what teenagers is like i happen to have been one of them once years ago and i wasn't exactly a very polite one either but god by his grace redeems me did you ever notice brothers and sisters this perfect god he put all the stars perfectly in place rotating in their in their right positions he was so great and he goes and makes the botany life and all the botany life is so perfect and all the cells got these words of plastic but everything but the cells were so perfectly in order is that right such a great creator and then and then this great creator he puts in the bible the worst people on the earth the worst bunch of people thieves and liars and murderers oh my goodness he was so perfect to show his retention i shake my head man [Applause] i cannot find anybody in the bible that was a decent guy when they started out that's how great our god is is that right oh my goodness me here's james you've got you've just got to love james i tell you so this guy read the old testament be patient oh who's patient around this place you know i've missed some impatient people i want it yesterday lord be patient therefore brethren they saying that to the brethren not to the worldly people now brethren be patient is that right of you fellas after the coming of the lord speaking for the seven church ages now behold the husbandman waiters hey look look at the words what does a husbandman do a husbandman is a person who looks after plants and seeds is that right he didn't go and say the farmer said the husbandman he talked about nature botany life but he's bringing in a spiritual sense behold the husbandman waiteth well a husbandman just doesn't go plant the seed that not over seven church ages that don't for the precious fruit of the earth and has long patience for it until he received the early and later rain he's by the seven churches amen now when you ask anything of the lord yes it must be seasonal did you get what i said he said ask ye the lord reign in the time of the latter rain amen you must ask according to the season so the lord shall make bright clouds and give them showers of rain to everyone grass in his field he's talking about your spiritual walk you know why some people get nothing because they don't ask if i don't get an answer i keep going back and back and back because in the book of luke maybe 19 or whatever there was a widow woman who got and she lost her husband and the seven church ages in the end time she's come with a desire to be avenged of her enemy and she comes up to an unjust judge and so the lord puts himself as an unjust judge he's a just judge but he's just putting himself in that parable form and he's the kind of man and she comes up says offends me of my enemy says no avenge me of my enemy i want some blessings no she keeps going back and back and back and drives and clean up the wall he says she's he says all right you can have it and he says shall i find faith when revelations 10 has been revealed at the end time shall i find that time of faith that you can ask and keep asking and keep asking and keep asking until he gives it to you because he doesn't want want some so soft soap believers where everything just falls into into their lap wants someone if you've got some problems in your life you can ask keep asking keep asking keep asking i've been delivered over from some things i've had for 60 years and do you think i could get rid of these things i ain't going to go and give you the list i'm 63. i had had a problem for 60 years i got it from my natural dna of my parents and you think i could throw it but i kept asking asking and asking because the season had come ask ye the lord the rain and the time of the latter rain [Applause] praise the lord amen praise god let's look at what joe what james saw this guy i love james because he's straight man i don't like the wishy-washy preachers man it makes me sick in my stomach listen to some women the scenery for the end time later reign is speaking now at the end time go ye now you rich man weep in hell for your miseries that shall come upon you your riches are corrupted your garments are moth eaten your gold and your silver is cankered and all the banks are rusting apart what was it talking about silver and gold is the banking system is that right it's where you value things the whole thing is conquered you shall end shall witness against you and shall eat your flesh as it were fire you have heaped up treasure together for the last days behold the heart of your labor is who you ripped off that's how farmers talk anyway and reaped your fields which is of you of you kept back by fraud crieth that the cries of them which have reaped are entered into the ears of the lord of sabawath it's not the lord of sabbath sabbath it means the lord of war you have lived in pleasure on the earth and been wanted you have nourished your hearts as in the day of slaughter what are we seeing on the earth right now what's god doing the rain is forcing every human being and to come into a maturity of the seed that has been placed in them now i'm just going to say some things as it flashes in front of me in fact i'm going to end up on this look i haven't even got a part away through this but you have to get the notes okay a teaching reign on a dispensational level will bring a dispensation to a maturity a teaching reign that comes from the word of god upon you will bring you to a very rapid maturity now let's say you start teaching yourself something that's wrong about yourself on a personal scale you start teaching yourself all right i'm just no good how you're going to end up i've ministered all around the world and i can go into a church and i know whether that church is going to end up in a total disaster or not i was in a certain country once preaching with an american minister come to the last meeting and five people came in that were not a part of that church and i was and they are people from a false teaching and i'm looking at them and they'll kind of yet get get get that sort of people like yapping like a jack russell dog and when the meeting was over they started maneuvering around that church teaching false stuff within a few months that whole church went into two souls doctrine rapidly amen it took years and years and years to clean that garbage out of that church i have seen people in this message come and talk to me and i'm listening to the what they are talking about and i sometimes warn people i said now that man or that woman or this person or this person they're going to cause a church split why because i hear what they are saying and inside of themselves they have taught themselves that they are something that god has not made them amen and i warn people i says watch that watch that watch that watch that some people don't even listen says look man this is a dangerous time if you teach yourself something the wrong way you're going to rapidly grow into it amen now let's just say you have something in your life that should not be there okay now catch this something in your life that should not be there now let's say it's a lust that should not be there okay well just hypothetically now okay now if you say in your heart i don't want that to be there god can deal with it the moment you say oh it's okay it's okay i can keep this i can keep this boof you're going to turn straight into the image of that lust you have what's causing it the surge of the holy ghost at this end time is making the whole world become what it is is that right all right we will stop there look brethren it's too big a sermon now you got to ask yourselves right now now this is why when i look at the church like this i said praise god me i look at our church in strep i say thank you jesus because i watch what's getting taught i watch what the pastor and the ministers are teaching and what they teach goes on the people and then they grow straight into a maturity like that i'm so thankful for righteous pastors that have a revelation of this message and you pray for those pastors that god will protect them i'm not a pastor but i know what they go through nice watch i know many many pastors worldwide my god they suffer and the devil taunts him and and gets them to feel depressed about these these things and as long as they start getting depressed and thinking in that depressed state they are going to go into some big troubles but what about you brothers and sisters this is the hour that you can pray for anything in that word and keep
