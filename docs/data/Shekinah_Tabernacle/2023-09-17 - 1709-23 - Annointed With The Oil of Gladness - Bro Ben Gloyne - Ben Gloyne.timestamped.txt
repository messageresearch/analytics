[31:32] worship Him and of the angels He saith
[31:34] who maketh his angels
[31:37] um spirits and his ministers a flame of
[31:38] fire but unto the son he saith thy

[34:09] Lord we commit the service into your
[34:11] hands Lord in Jesus Christ's name amen
[34:14] amen God bless you friends you can have
[34:16] your seats this morning so I want to
[34:18] speak about the oil of glass Madness
[34:19] amen I'm so I'm so thankful that when
[34:22] the Apostle Paul was inspired to write
[34:25] about the anointing that was on our lord
[34:26] Jesus that he did not call it the oil of
[34:28] sorrow or the oil of formality or
[34:31] coldness or indifference but it's the
[34:33] oil of gladness amen and we can see that
[34:35] the uh he's speaking of the Holy Ghost
[34:37] that was upon him
[34:39] and this oil as you know this this
[34:43] anointing oil as you see this he was
[34:45] anointed above his fellows and we know
[34:47] that the fullness of all that God was
[34:49] was poured into Christ amen that so this
[34:51] anointing was poured out during you know
[34:54] just in portion into the prophets down
[34:55] through the Old Testament but when our
[34:57] lord Jesus our God became flesh it was a
[35:00] fullness amen of this oil and it's
[35:02] gladness and I I pray we get happy this
[35:05] morning amen when we when we realize
[35:07] that and and our gladness should be more
[35:09] than just an emotion the emotion goes
[35:11] with it but if we realize that the same
[35:13] anointing that was on our God is now
[35:15] within us amen that this gladness amen
[35:18] would would manifest in our lives now I
[35:21] read there about Sarah as a bit of a
[35:23] context because Sarah would come to a
[35:25] place in her life where her laughter
[35:27] turned from her laughter from unbelief
[35:30] and resentment and frustration to a
[35:32] laughter of Joy amen because the word
[35:34] had been fulfilled in her life that it
[35:37] was no longer it was no longer a a cycle
[35:40] of many years 25 years of a unfulfilled
[35:43] promise in our life that you know she no
[35:46] doubt got very frustrated Abraham didn't
[35:48] get frustrated because it was real to
[35:50] him it was revealed to him he was going
[35:52] to have Isaac so you know time did not
[35:54] frustrate him but he just got stronger
[35:56] in faith as it became more impossible
[35:59] but because it wasn't real to Sarah it
[36:01] became frustrating and we know that you
[36:04] know someone who can have such a
[36:05] revelation can be rejoicing overcoming
[36:07] that could actually cause a frustration
[36:09] in someone who is not in that same kind
[36:10] of position but I'm so thankful that we
[36:13] can walk with God that God that same
[36:14] atmosphere can meet one another amen
[36:17] that Sarah because Abraham knew that she
[36:19] was part of the promise and he kept
[36:21] praying and loving the Lord and walking
[36:22] with them knowing that in God's season
[36:24] God would meet Sarah amen so so finally
[36:27] there came a visitation in Genesis 18 I
[36:29] don't have it on my slides but we know
[36:31] it very well where God put on flesh amen
[36:33] and two angels also went and visited
[36:35] Sarah at Abraham and it was Abraham it
[36:38] wasn't Abraham's visitation it was
[36:41] Sarah's visitation because God would say
[36:43] according to time of life you're going
[36:45] to have the promised son and time of
[36:47] life speaks to a woman and not of a man
[36:49] so there there was God speaking to
[36:52] Abraham but it was it was Sarah's
[36:54] visitation but because the promise
[36:56] wasn't made real to her yet amen she
[36:58] laughed within herself saying this can't
[37:00] happen can I have pleasure with my Lord
[37:02] I'm old he's old you know this is
[37:04] impossible but in God God revealed that
[37:07] that that that that that that that was
[37:09] what she was thinking in her heart so if
[37:11] I stutter and splatter we'll get there
[37:13] eventually okay you know it'll come out
[37:15] okay you know so you know so so that was
[37:18] that was her visitation and that was God
[37:21] coming to her to turn her heart from
[37:23] unbelief and doubt to Faith I mean
[37:26] because we know that faith comes from
[37:28] God Amen you got to be anointed to
[37:30] believe amen and it's this anointing of
[37:32] gladness Amen that brings Faith
[37:34] Hallelujah so so I believe when she had
[37:37] that visitation when God spoke to her to
[37:39] say no you will have the son amen say it
[37:42] was a manifestation of Elohim that
[37:44] caused her heart to turn from doubt to
[37:46] Faith in the promise and we've had that
[37:49] same visitation in this this day where
[37:51] God has put on flesh and a prophet amen
[37:53] God reveal himself through brother
[37:55] Branham to turn the church's heart from
[37:57] from unbelief in the promise to Faith in
[38:00] the promise to give her strength amen
[38:02] that she can manifest the promised word
[38:04] of this season which is the change of
[38:06] the body that we will receive the
[38:08] promised out in the meeting in the End
[38:09] Amen so her heart so so her laughter was
[38:12] doubt amen her laughter was frustration
[38:15] at the promise of God but after that
[38:18] visitation she said laugh with me
[38:20] Hallelujah my heart has turned to
[38:22] laughter amen because why she's now
[38:25] rejoicing and the promise amen that God
[38:27] had given her had become manifested in
[38:30] her life so to me she received the oil
[38:32] of gladness Amen because he says here
[38:35] now that God has made me to love and
[38:38] that wasn't a laughter promise in doubt
[38:40] and unbelief but that was laughter and
[38:41] Faith saying Thank You Lord here's the
[38:44] promise I mean thank you Lord you turned
[38:46] my heart that I was resisting the
[38:48] promise I was angry I was you know we
[38:50] get to Stage our life we just get
[38:51] frustrated I mean we see a promise in
[38:54] the word we see the Promise and we've
[38:56] seen it happen many times you hear it on
[38:57] tape but then you just get so frustrated
[39:00] again you can't get to that spot and
[39:02] Sarah was frustrated here's Abraham
[39:04] rejoicing and having a good old maybe
[39:05] around the campfire get up and do a
[39:07] dance around the campfire praising God
[39:08] Amen and she's sitting there saying
[39:10] there he goes again that old you know
[39:13] but then it came her term I mean it
[39:17] wasn't just him dancing around the
[39:18] campfire saying glory to God she joined
[39:20] in the dance amen because the same
[39:21] Revelation that was upon him was now on
[39:23] her amen and it brought forth the
[39:25] promised son anyway so I pray that amen
[39:28] God pour out your all of gladness this
[39:29] morning amen that we'd see the promises
[39:32] there are a lot of today for us amen
[39:34] will be fulfilled Hallelujah did that
[39:36] become such a revelation we'd walk by
[39:38] that Revelation like never before
[39:40] I mean so he was anointed with this oil
[39:43] of gladness above his fellows now this
[39:46] word gladness
[39:47] as an exaltation specifically I welcome
[39:50] a gladness is an exceeding Joy amen an
[39:53] exaltation if that's how you say that
[39:55] word from the Oxford languages
[39:57] dictionary it's so it's a noun it's a
[39:59] feeling of triumphant Elation or
[40:01] Jubilation into rejoicing so it's not a
[40:04] feeling of defeat it's not a feeling of
[40:07] lukewarmness it's not a feeling of
[40:08] indifference you know it's a feeling of
[40:11] triumphant
[40:12] elation
[40:14] Hallelujah because you see when you get
[40:16] anointed you begin to see the victory
[40:18] the Lord has won for us the same way he
[40:20] sees it amen when we see that he he
[40:23] looks at Calvary as a finished work and
[40:25] he openly triumphed over every Spirit of
[40:28] hell he conquered hell itself every
[40:30] devil he conquered everything that could
[40:32] be conquered that day he conquered it
[40:33] and he Transit he conquered over it amen
[40:36] now he's here to manifest that victory
[40:38] in our lives amen so so he rejoices in
[40:41] the work of his hands amen he rejoices
[40:44] in the work of his hands and we are the
[40:45] work of his hands amen so
[40:48] Hallelujah it brings a feeling of trough
[40:50] now now I just want to say now this is
[40:52] more than just when I say a feeling it's
[40:54] more than just a feeling
[40:56] right because feelings come and feelings
[40:58] go
[40:59] one day you can feel like Satan Ray I'm
[41:02] gonna throw you until you learn from
[41:03] limb the next day I say Lord help me
[41:05] deliver me from this affliction
[41:08] but feelings come and go so but so so
[41:10] when I use the word feeling please take
[41:12] it Beyond a feeling to a revelation in
[41:15] the heart right that that that's Rock
[41:17] Solid that cannot move in spite of
[41:19] whatever's going on in your emotional
[41:21] realm there's a rock in your soul of
[41:24] Triumph I mean so so if so I trust that
[41:27] let's just put that glossary term out
[41:29] there so you don't get so you don't
[41:30] misunderstand me that well we're just
[41:32] going by feelings now because we know we
[41:34] won't the day of the Rapture some of us
[41:36] will be happy some of us will be sad
[41:38] some of us will be troubled
[41:42] but that's emotion
[41:44] that doesn't change the fact that we're
[41:45] on our way to heaven shouting Victory
[41:47] okay so so don't get in your mind that
[41:49] we have to be in a state of Nirvana of a
[41:51] a triumphal feeling in our spirits and
[41:54] then we're Rapture Ready okay because
[41:55] remember in the season the Resurrection
[41:57] the two on the way to emmaused our
[41:59] downcast their world had fallen apart
[42:00] everything had everything had crumbled
[42:02] around them and they're going back to
[42:04] their Village and they're living in the
[42:06] season of the resurrection and Jesus
[42:08] walks with them opens the scripture to
[42:10] them until they see him and that they
[42:12] realize they're part of his resurrection
[42:14] amen and this is the same thing that's
[42:16] happened in this day as God is Walking
[42:18] With Us opening his word to us to reveal
[42:20] to us we're part of this Rapture amen
[42:23] season Hallelujah the change of these
[42:25] bodies amen the resurrection amen of the
[42:28] of the Dead Saints and the translation
[42:30] of the living

[45:03] received the Holy Ghost you've entered
[45:04] into an eternal rest I mean it's not
[45:06] keeping a day that was a shadow but the
[45:08] reality is when you receive the Holy
[45:10] Ghost so this is a song for you and I
[45:12] every day because we're in the Sabbath
[45:15] every day

[45:18] humanly from my own works now God is
[45:20] living as the Apostle Paul would say
[45:22] it's no longer either liveth a Christ
[45:23] that liveth in me he knew what the
[45:25] Sabbath was amen
[45:27] amen it is a good thing to give thanks
[45:29] unto the Lord and to sing praises unto
[45:32] his name almost high to show forth thy
[45:34] loving kindness in the morning and thy
[45:36] faithfulness every night upon an
[45:38] instrument of ten strings and upon the

[46:05] creatures in Christ Jesus amen how can
[46:08] that not make you glad amen when you

[46:24] through the scripture you know our God
[46:26] has never been defeated amen he's never
[46:28] retreated amen he's never backed up he's
[46:30] never thought I don't have enough to win
[46:32] the day no he's always had more than
[46:34] enough amen he had more than enough an
[46:36] Enoch's day for Enoch to walk with God
[46:38] you know many times we think of Enoch I
[46:40] just think of him as like all I have a
[46:42] picture in my mind is Enoch walk in this
[46:43] green grassy meadow the birds are
[46:45] chirping the sun's are shining no
[46:47] trouble
[46:48] he had a lot he had trouble in his life
[46:50] because he was he was the Shadow and
[46:53] we're the reality there were things
[46:55] going on in the world there was trouble
[46:56] going on in every hand but yet he chose
[46:58] to walk with God he didn't walk with the
[47:00] trouble he didn't walk with the problems
[47:02] he walked with God Amen so so this is
[47:06] yeah but so so God nothing could stop
[47:09] Enoch taking that walk
[47:11] God ordained that walk and Enoch took
[47:14] that walk amen so every day is Walking
[47:16] with God and then one day he got so far
[47:18] home yo yo he said well I've got to make
[47:20] my way back now home God and God says no
[47:23] no just keep walking with me and he
[47:25] walked all the way home with God hallelu
[47:26] instead of his natural home he went to
[47:28] his Heavenly home and I believe it's the
[47:30] same thing with you on I let's just keep
[47:32] walking we're an idea with the oil of

[48:40] that's not the oil of gladness that's
[48:42] the devil trying to push you down in a
[48:44] pit somewhere amen don't sympathize with
[48:46] the Devil is like I just continue from
[48:48] Wednesday the devil wants you to
[48:50] sympathize with them if you sympathize
[48:52] with that Spirit you open the door and
[48:53] you be and that Spirit comes on you so

[49:07] them you say well you don't understand
[49:10] what we're going through Jesus knows
[49:12] exactly what you're going through amen
[49:14] he conquered every spirit that can be
[49:16] conquered he knows exactly what we're
[49:18] going through amen he can relate to you
[49:21] because he's been there
[49:22] so never think no one understands amen
[49:25] maybe no one understands here but he
[49:27] does but he wants your his oil of
[49:29] gladness to come upon your life amen and
[49:32] then that will set you free and break
[49:33] the bands of the enemy Hallelujah hey
[49:37] man that's all we need just just
[49:39] sympathize with the Lord he wants you to
[49:41] agree with his word amen he wants you to
[49:44] say yes Lord Hallelujah see it doesn't
[49:47] matter what state we're in Gideon was a
[49:49] mighty man availability stretching weed
[49:50] in secret but God wanted him to agree
[49:53] that's why the angel came to and said
[49:54] you're a mighty man just agree with what
[49:56] I'm telling you you are doesn't matter
[49:58] what you feel you are this is what I say
[50:00] you are Hallelujah and that's what
[50:02] matters it doesn't matter what you think
[50:04] you are it's what he says you are that
[50:07] stands forever
[50:08] Hallelujah why because he's trying to
[50:10] get you to see how he saw you when he
[50:13] wrote your name in the Lamb's Book of
[50:14] Life and if you can just agree with that
[50:17] image amen you'll have a voice of
[50:18] Triumph irrespective of what's going on
[50:21] in your life
[50:25] hey man that's why Sarah could now laugh
[50:28] because she saw herself as God saw her
[50:31] amen she was a princess with God that's
[50:34] why her name was changed amen you're a
[50:36] princess with God we're royalty this
[50:38] morning amen doesn't matter what we are
[50:41] how much money what money that doesn't
[50:43] care about nothing no we are made in
[50:45] God's image Hallelujah that's your girl
[50:47] such an oil of gladness Amen I know I
[50:50] know who I am
[50:51] Hallelujah
[50:53] I mean the Apostle Paul was anointed
[50:55] before with a with a Scully intellectual
[50:58] kind of Darkness but then the oil of
[51:01] gladness found him on the road to
[51:02] Damascus
[51:04] Hallelujah
[51:06] Hallelujah
[51:07] amen he says now thanks be unto God
[51:10] which always causes us to Triumph in
[51:13] Christ before they'd say my Pharisee
[51:16] Doctrine makes me Triumph those things
[51:18] don't help no one amen but if you're in
[51:20] Christ you all he always causes us to
[51:22] Triumph I mean he will not put his name
[51:24] to shame Hallelujah he always uphold his
[51:27] children Hallelujah and maketh manifest
[51:30] the savior of his knowledge By Us in
[51:32] every place for we are unto God a sweet
[51:34] savior of Christ in them that are saved
[51:37] and in them that and in them that perish
[51:40] amen that sweet savior is a nice odor
[51:43] like in the Old Testament I think I said
[51:45] a few Sundays ago God likes food God
[51:47] like you know like nice Aromas yellow
[51:50] incense and things and you know but
[51:51] that's just a shadow
[51:53] now here's the reality it's a
[51:55] surrendered life
[51:57] it's a lover a life that loves God
[51:59] that's Anointed with the oil of gladness
[52:01] that brings up a sweet scent before the
[52:04] Lord he looks downstairs I enjoy that
[52:07] worship and that's this and that's not
[52:09] just singing in church that's just an
[52:11] everyday kind of a life I mean your life
[52:13] is offering a sweet smelling savior
[52:15] before the Lord hallelujah
[52:17] and you're glad he's made us a Living
[52:19] Sacrifice
[52:20] I mean he looks down and says well
[52:22] there's a lot of Darkness but actually I
[52:23] see a lot of light I mean I see myself
[52:25] upon the Earth Hallelujah
[52:29] Hallelujah
[52:30] amen now as I said
[52:32] the oil of gladness this is what the
[52:34] Lord was anointed above his fellows the
[52:36] fullness of the god here bodily dwelt on
[52:38] me did not have this anointing by
[52:40] measure but it was without measure
[52:43] but we understand that that our Lord
[52:45] hears he was despised and rejected of
[52:47] men a Man of Sorrows and acquainted with
[52:50] grief now because many times you may
[52:52] think well how can you have the oil of
[52:54] gladness does that not mean you should
[52:55] always be happy
[52:57] as I'm saying it's above feelings it's
[53:00] greater than feelings I always say it's
[53:01] deeper than feelings now we're going
[53:03] there it's deeper right because it's in
[53:05] the soul it's more than just in your
[53:07] spirit realm even though it comes forth
[53:10] right you begin to feel glad
[53:12] but it's not a euphoric feeling we must
[53:15] have all the time that means we are
[53:17] ready okay because you see it says he's
[53:20] he's despised and rejected of men a Man
[53:22] of Sorrows and acquainted with grief if
[53:24] you're acquainted with something you
[53:26] know you begin to know that real well
[53:28] right so and we head as it were our
[53:30] faces from him he was despised and we
[53:32] esteemed him not surely he hath borne
[53:34] our griefs and carried our sorrows that
[53:36] yet we did a steam him stricken smitten
[53:38] of God and afflicted
[53:41] so he was so he had a hard life
[53:45] physically yeah he didn't have a place
[53:47] to lay his head he had a lot of trouble
[53:48] there's people pulling him you know he
[53:51] wanted to be killed he knew exactly what
[53:52] he wasn't shocked when the scribes and
[53:54] Pharisees you know came to get him he
[53:56] wasn't shocked that Judas betrayed him
[53:58] he knew all those things would happen so
[54:00] but yet he had this oil of gladness
[54:02] above
[54:04] any other Prophet amen his anointed
[54:06] because he could look because of this
[54:08] oil of gladness he could look beyond the
[54:11] Here and Now
[54:13] by me you know as as Jesus would say
[54:16] here in Luke 10 21 in that hour Jesus
[54:19] rejoiced in spirit
[54:21] amen now that rejoicing and spirit is
[54:24] true to have exceeding joy to jump for
[54:26] joy Jesus jumped Jesus ran Jesus danced
[54:31] he wasn't a formal kind of hippie kind
[54:33] of a God no he wasn't that kind of way
[54:35] at all he was a real happy guy
[54:37] I mean but so so because and the reason
[54:40] he rejoiced in spirit he said I thank
[54:43] the O Father Lord of Heaven and Earth
[54:44] for thou has hid these things from the
[54:46] wise and prudent and has revealed them
[54:48] unto babes even so farther so it seemeth
[54:50] good in my sight all things are
[54:52] delivered unto me I mean turn me of my
[54:54] father and no man knoweth who the son is
[54:56] but the father and who the father is but
[54:58] the son and he to whom the son will
[55:01] reveal him and he turned uh he turned
[55:03] him unto his disciples and said
[55:05] privilege privilege blessed are the eyes
[55:07] which see the things that ye see for I
[55:10] tell you that many prophets and Kings
[55:12] have desire have desired to see those
[55:14] things which you see and have not seen
[55:15] them and and to hear those things which
[55:18] you hear and have not heard them amen
[55:20] says rejoicing because he is saying Lord
[55:22] these things are hidden but they're
[55:24] revealed to a certain group of people I
[55:26] mean because there was a joy set before
[55:27] him which was us redeemed dancing around
[55:29] the throne amen so so his his Joy came
[55:33] from a more than a here and an hour he
[55:36] looked beyond the crowds and what was
[55:38] going on you know normally the No Doubt
[55:40] the disciples were there without you
[55:41] know you're fed the fourth hour or five
[55:43] thousand and whatever and multitudes are
[55:46] following him they thought man this is
[55:47] really gaining traction yeah but in
[55:50] God's mind it wasn't gaining traction
[55:52] you know and then he had to say that
[55:54] yeah you know certain things in John 6
[55:56] unless you eat my flesh and drink my
[55:57] blood you have no life in you all those
[55:59] things you know because it wasn't
[56:00] numbers he was looking for he was
[56:03] looking for character he was looking for
[56:05] parts of himself and when he began to
[56:08] gather those ones
[56:09] that was his Joy
[56:11] that was his Joy can you imagine he's
[56:15] walking by the Sea of Galilee we just
[56:17] see fishermen he sing attributes he sing
[56:20] parts of himself that he saw before the
[56:23] foundation of the world Amen they're in
[56:25] a fallen State because they're not but
[56:27] but within them is an image that must
[56:29] come forth and that's why when he came
[56:31] into his ministry he came out of the
[56:32] Wilderness after the 14 day temptation
[56:34] all those things he says come follow me

[56:51] holy what was he doing he was on a
[56:53] treasure hunt Hallelujah he went to
[56:56] Samaria there was a great treasure in
[56:58] Samaria the the city didn't see it see
[57:01] her as a treasure but she was a great
[57:03] treasure in heaven because she had
[57:04] representation in heaven so he could
[57:07] have said to his disciples I have Nico

[57:10] got a great Jewel

[57:15] armed guard are we going to get robbed

[57:19] diamond greater than gold greater than
[57:21] whatever's in the treasury in Rome or
[57:23] wherever this is a greater Jewel that's
[57:25] an eternal one amen so he went Gathering
[57:27] Jewels he revealed himself

[57:51] demons guarding that Jewel see it don't
[57:53] matter the security the devil puts
[57:55] around

[58:28] Tomb
[58:29] how ridiculous the devil is they you
[58:33] think about caiaphasis you know he sees
[58:34] the guards he sees the tomb sealed the
[58:37] Roman Legions and they're on high alert
[58:38] because if that guy gets out they're
[58:40] dead you know if the disciples come
[58:42] along steal his body that's the end of
[58:44] their Quran they're not just fired
[58:45] they're executed
[58:46] and he and he would no doubt would have
[58:48] had such a smug look on his face the
[58:50] devil gets smug sometimes but it ain't
[58:53] over till it's over so you know that
[58:55] when the smug look on his face it's
[58:57] finally done
[58:58] we crucified the plan worked boys high
[59:01] fives first bumps whatever they did I
[59:02] don't know you know we got him he's
[59:05] there we've got these guards they can't
[59:08] get them out and spread alive that he's
[59:09] raised and the devil thinks he's got you
[59:11] yeah the devil thinks he can just let a
[59:14] Spirit come in
[59:15] get blinded under some entertainment or
[59:18] something of the world
[59:19] I've got them in a tomb
[59:21] oh no
[59:23] oh no
[59:24] why because that may be what Friday
[59:26] looks like when Sunday is coming
[59:28] amen that made me look like Friday it's
[59:30] all ruined it's all fallen to pieces
[59:32] it's all gone like there's no but
[59:33] Sunday's coming resurrection's coming
[59:36] Hallelujah it doesn't matter what
[59:38] someone's head and buried behind and
[59:40] sealed behind I mean there's no tomb
[59:42] that God can't bust through I mean
[59:45] there's no guards of Hell whatever
[59:46] unbelief skepticism whatever more God
[59:49] can bust through that thing and bring
[59:52] his Jewel out Hallelujah because he
[59:54] ain't leaving until they're all gathered
[59:57] Hallelujah he ain't leaving until
[59:58] they're all on Amen so hallelujah amen
[1:00:02] that was his joy and I tell you friends
[1:00:05] if that's our joy
[1:00:07] that's our joy Lord there's got to be a
[1:00:09] jewel here
[1:00:10] somewhere
[1:00:11] maybe here maybe here I don't know
[1:00:14] find may we find him Lord
[1:00:16] you see that light
[1:00:19] come that flame of the Holy Ghost get a
[1:00:21] hold of someone yeah that should be our
[1:00:23] greatest joy that was his greatest joy
[1:00:26] oh that should be our joy
[1:00:28] amen
[1:00:31] Hallelujah
[1:00:33] you see brother around makes a statement
[1:00:35] in the Mighty God unveiled before us
[1:00:37] he says now I mean a woman and delegates
[1:00:40] of this convention you're on a
[1:00:42] convention today hello how are we doing
[1:00:43] I want to say this without respect of
[1:00:45] persons but in in the view of today in
[1:00:47] the view of what
[1:00:49] um we're here for today I'm afraid that
[1:00:50] the traditions of the fathers and church
[1:00:52] fathers has hid this from too many
[1:00:54] people since the Holy Ghost has come in
[1:00:56] this last days as prophesied and the
[1:00:59] veil had been rent too many people try
[1:01:01] to hang to their traditions of the
[1:01:03] fathers that's why they can't see this
[1:01:05] extreme joy
[1:01:07] amen and peace and things that the
[1:01:09] church has today yet it's in plain view
[1:01:12] to those who believe
[1:01:14] amen so there's an extreme joy that we
[1:01:16] have today
[1:01:17] Hallelujah praise God how's your how's
[1:01:21] your yo your joy should be extreme
[1:01:23] remember it's deeper than your feelings
[1:01:25] okay and then we just keep that in mind
[1:01:27] I mean you can be feeling so indifferent
[1:01:29] down whatever more but yeah there's
[1:01:30] extreme joy but you see the veil of the
[1:01:33] traditions of the Fathers as the whole
[1:01:35] you know
[1:01:36] yes well the Lord's allowed us all my
[1:01:38] life to Humble me you know I've got the
[1:01:40] sword in My Flesh and just to keep me
[1:01:42] humble because of the abundance of
[1:01:43] Revelation that I have and you know yo
[1:01:46] I'm just you know the Lord's allowed Us
[1:01:47] in my life and that's a tradition of the
[1:01:50] fathers has God told you it's meant to
[1:01:52] be there don't just assume the devil's
[1:01:55] in your mind and mind bowels and trouble
[1:01:57] because God's trying to keep you humble
[1:01:58] no he wants you to have joy and peace he
[1:02:01] wants you see we don't have the spirit
[1:02:02] of fear but love power and a sound mind
[1:02:04] I mean a sound mind is one that there's
[1:02:07] not a constant torment in amen see sure
[1:02:11] we're not immune from mind battles but
[1:02:12] there should come a point where it's
[1:02:13] like okay Satan I'm sick of this
[1:02:16] I'm sick of this mind battle
[1:02:18] go talk to yourself devil
[1:02:21] you go look in the mirror and tell
[1:02:24] yourself these things I know you're a
[1:02:26] decrepit creature anyway but hey just
[1:02:28] just just go talk to yourself business
[1:02:30] hours are closed you know the amazing
[1:02:32] thing about a throne room
[1:02:34] this security
[1:02:36] and if the king don't like somebody they
[1:02:39] get kicked out
[1:02:40] they have no right the only way they can
[1:02:42] come in and do what they do and then
[1:02:44] leave
[1:02:44] is if they have greater power than the
[1:02:47] Gods see Moses Brotherhood said you know
[1:02:50] one soldier with a spare could end of
[1:02:51] the whole thing
[1:02:53] but he had the oil of gladness
[1:02:56] because God's people are coming out
[1:02:58] they've been in slavery 400 years but
[1:03:00] God's people are coming out do you think
[1:03:02] about him and Aaron now
[1:03:03] they walk into the throne room naturally
[1:03:06] you think who are these stinking
[1:03:08] Shepherds coming into this great big
[1:03:09] Palace
[1:03:10] and the gods could have said just get
[1:03:12] out you can't you're not welcome here
[1:03:13] maybe they you know like the movies they
[1:03:15] cross the across the spares over the
[1:03:16] doorway you know but they also because
[1:03:19] the anointing was there they had to give
[1:03:21] way
[1:03:22] they had to give entrance because the
[1:03:25] devil could not stop them coming in and
[1:03:27] delivering their message Amy it's the
[1:03:29] same thing with Elijah came before King
[1:03:30] Ahab do you think he was welcome there
[1:03:33] in Samaria they had already started to
[1:03:35] put the prophets of God to death and
[1:03:37] here comes one guy fuzzy face out of the
[1:03:39] Wilderness you know
[1:03:41] it won't be rain or due till I call for
[1:03:43] it one God with a sword could have ended
[1:03:46] the whole thing but no the but the
[1:03:48] greater one came into the throne room
[1:03:50] than a natural Throne Hallelujah says
[1:03:52] the same thing we've got to realize hey
[1:03:53] we've got security we don't have to put
[1:03:55] up the devil raging in our mind all the
[1:03:58] time no we can call security he can be
[1:04:00] evicted
[1:04:01] amen he can be evicted amen doesn't
[1:04:03] matter how real how verbalt it can be no
[1:04:05] it's just trying to get you to worship
[1:04:07] it
[1:04:08] amen
[1:04:10] so we don't sure we're not immune for
[1:04:12] them but we don't have to put up with
[1:04:13] them
[1:04:13] we had to put up with nonsense this is a
[1:04:16] no-nonsense kind of place I know about
[1:04:18] the devil's nonsense now
[1:04:19] all right we don't have to put up with
[1:04:21] that stuff amen so there's we have an
[1:04:23] extreme now please when you read this
[1:04:24] stuff the devil will probably say you've
[1:04:26] never had this feeling it's Greater Than
[1:04:28] A Feeling
[1:04:29] right it's greater than a feeling okay
[1:04:32] but you got to realize the mighty mighty
[1:04:34] God unavailable for us brother Brown's
[1:04:36] not just preaching about God veiled in
[1:04:37] him he says no he's valid in people I
[1:04:40] mean these son of man Luke 17 30 is
[1:04:42] veiled in is manifested in human beings
[1:04:44] Christ revealed in a multi-membered body
[1:04:47] now it was in it was in brother Brown's
[1:04:49] Ministry the son of man was revealed
[1:04:51] Jesus Christ but that revealing of the
[1:04:53] son of man continues on through the
[1:04:55] bride of Christ amen so the Mighty God
[1:04:57] is unveiled he's been unviable for us
[1:04:59] and you know when he's unveiled when
[1:05:01] you've stepped into his presence and
[1:05:03] he's changed your life that means
[1:05:05] there's no vowels of tradition of long
[1:05:07] faces long hair long skirts grumpiness
[1:05:11] buzzsaw kind of attitudes you know oh
[1:05:14] we've got to be Pious and got to be
[1:05:15] referent no I think we should get out of
[1:05:17] order long enough someone to get saved
[1:05:19] yeah where did you get out of order long
[1:05:20] enough that that actually demons flee
[1:05:22] that we can really Express see the
[1:05:25] biggest problem is when we suppress
[1:05:26] what's going on within us that's very
[1:05:29] unhealthy and that's the biggest problem
[1:05:31] in this country especially with men as
[1:05:33] we suppress how we feel
[1:05:35] oh boy it'll hold together don't worry
[1:05:39] and if not well hey there's some effects
[1:05:41] there I'm sure we can
[1:05:42] you know but that's the biggest problem
[1:05:44] in this country especially as men don't
[1:05:47] know how to express how they feel they
[1:05:48] bottle up things and it's manifested in
[1:05:51] violence or anger or withdrawment or
[1:05:54] whatever it is
[1:05:56] but you see you should never suppress so
[1:05:58] the devil's fighting you trying to
[1:06:00] suppress you no just say no I'm gonna
[1:06:03] I'm gonna expose you devil I'm gonna
[1:06:05] expose you before the world if I need to
[1:06:08] you're going to get exposed and you're
[1:06:10] gonna look like the silly fella
[1:06:12] yeah
[1:06:13] amen so we should never express these
[1:06:15] things I mean I mean suppress we should
[1:06:17] have seen that's why you know we're not
[1:06:19] meant to just be a Pious bunch of
[1:06:21] statues I'm not saying we are you know I
[1:06:23] know I'm preaching to the choir but you
[1:06:24] know we should but we should let our
[1:06:26] emotions come out it's healthy to let
[1:06:28] our emotions come out
[1:06:30] amen
[1:06:34] amen pardon me
[1:06:36] now
[1:06:37] all that Christ all that wasn't God
[1:06:39] excuse me
[1:06:40] oh
[1:06:42] was poured unto Christ
[1:06:44] amen and all that was in Christ was
[1:06:46] poured into the church
[1:06:48] amen so that oil of gladness is now in
[1:06:51] you and I
[1:06:52] remember this is not something that's
[1:06:53] this is this is today's news and and
[1:06:56] some of us a bit have have have been
[1:06:58] have had this oil of gladness for a long
[1:07:01] time some of us are short time it's all
[1:07:03] fine you've got it if you've got the
[1:07:04] Holy Ghost you've got it I mean so
[1:07:07] all that was in God was poured into
[1:07:09] Christ other than Christ was poured into
[1:07:10] the church
[1:07:12] now
[1:07:13] this baptism is the same one
[1:07:16] that we have received as as the sons of
[1:07:19] thunder would ask him their mother said
[1:07:21] you know granted that that my two sons
[1:07:24] can sit on your right and left hand
[1:07:26] and then they ask can you drink the cup
[1:07:28] that I'll drink and be baptized with the
[1:07:29] baptism that I'll be baptized with and
[1:07:31] they said we can
[1:07:33] and he said truly that is true you shall
[1:07:35] drink of the same cup and you'll be
[1:07:36] baptized with the same baptism so you
[1:07:39] will receive the same oil of gladness
[1:07:41] amenby says unto them about they said
[1:07:44] but to sit on my right hand and on my
[1:07:46] left is not mine to give but it shall be
[1:07:49] given to them which are uh for whom it
[1:07:51] is prepared of my father
[1:07:53] so so the people that will sit on us
[1:07:55] right and left hand is a predestinated
[1:07:57] place and it's for a certain people amen
[1:08:00] it's a people that have been prepared to
[1:08:02] sit there amen so prepared over so so
[1:08:05] now if we come down to this last day the
[1:08:08] promises down through the church ages
[1:08:10] the promise to this lettuce in church
[1:08:11] Jesus to them that overcometh will sit
[1:08:13] down on my Throne as I sat down on my
[1:08:17] father's Throne so now he's saying now
[1:08:18] the Overcomers of this age they will sit
[1:08:21] so so we are the sons of thunder wanted
[1:08:23] to sit
[1:08:24] was not for them because they're not on
[1:08:27] this age amen but it's for the bride in
[1:08:29] this last age it's been prepared for you
[1:08:31] and I amen so there's a place of
[1:08:34] position power and authority amen that
[1:08:36] we've already been seated in Heavenly
[1:08:38] places but this is the Overcomers Throne
[1:08:41] amen that we will sit in in the
[1:08:43] millennium
[1:08:44] Hallelujah so I trust no because you got
[1:08:47] to realize man what we were we're not I
[1:08:49] know I say it probably very very simply
[1:08:51] but we've risen above a lot of things
[1:08:53] hey we've risen above sin we've risen
[1:08:56] above skepticism we've risen about
[1:08:58] formality we're represent above all
[1:09:00] kinds of things of the world and God Has
[1:09:02] Lifted us higher and higher
[1:09:05] so what's happening we are overcoming
[1:09:07] God through us is overcoming these
[1:09:10] things so whatever sins we were in Once
[1:09:12] Upon a Time but we're no longer that
[1:09:14] person we've overcome this
[1:09:15] right well they've been conquered so now
[1:09:18] the reason we're on this trajectory to
[1:09:21] the Overcomers Throne is because we're
[1:09:24] Anointed with the Overcomer himself with
[1:09:27] there's an oil of gladness because
[1:09:28] you've got to see the anointing we've
[1:09:30] received takes us to a position right so
[1:09:33] now the world brother Ram said that
[1:09:35] these spirits of you know rock and roll
[1:09:37] in Hollywood thinks will take the world
[1:09:38] to Armageddon
[1:09:40] so the demon powers of the world will
[1:09:42] take the world to the battle of
[1:09:44] Armageddon right but we're not Anointed
[1:09:46] with the spirit of the world we're
[1:09:47] Anointed with the spirit of Christ so if
[1:09:49] we're Anointed with the spirit of Christ
[1:09:50] he dwells within us he's going to take
[1:09:52] us to the Overcomers Throne we're not
[1:09:54] going to Armageddon well actually we are
[1:09:57] going to Armageddon but not that way
[1:10:00] we're going to come with Christ on white
[1:10:02] horses come out of heaven in Revelations
[1:10:04] 19 and fight the battle of Armageddon
[1:10:06] right for that spread of rock and roll
[1:10:08] will take the world through that battle
[1:10:09] but on the wrong side are you following
[1:10:11] me praise the Lord so the anointing we
[1:10:13] receive will take us to a place now I'm
[1:10:15] saying these things I trust that makes
[1:10:17] you glad it doesn't make you unhappy Amy
[1:10:21] just like David when he was anointed to
[1:10:23] be king it took him to the throne it's
[1:10:25] the anointing that took him to the
[1:10:26] throne it wasn't himself that took him
[1:10:28] there it wasn't his own abilities how
[1:10:30] smart he was how clever he was as
[1:10:32] Charisma whatever abilities he had it
[1:10:34] was not those things that got him to be
[1:10:36] the king it was the anointing in his
[1:10:38] life that got into the throne amen it's
[1:10:40] the same thing with you and I it's the
[1:10:41] anointing of God this should make us
[1:10:43] this the soil of gladness why because
[1:10:45] the love affair amen we don't this is
[1:10:48] not a oil Affair or trepidation that's
[1:10:50] the oil of gladness why you love your
[1:10:52] bridegroom he means more to you than
[1:10:55] everything in the world you can take
[1:10:56] this whole world but give me Jesus
[1:10:58] holistic is a there's a pulling power
[1:11:00] see we're being pulled we're not being
[1:11:02] pushed or kick we're being pulled
[1:11:04] there's a drawing why because the
[1:11:06] anointing thing is drawing you into
[1:11:07] Heavenly places it's drawing you into a
[1:11:09] rapture
[1:11:10] that's what the third poll is amen it's
[1:11:13] a word that's come to change our bodies
[1:11:15] I know it's the power of the spoken word
[1:11:17] all those things but ultimately it gives
[1:11:18] us rapturing Faith through what these
[1:11:20] bodies have changed
[1:11:22] I trust this is not all hashtags and
[1:11:24] buzzwords but there's something uh real
[1:11:26] in here I mean but you see there's an
[1:11:28] anointing has come upon the Earth to
[1:11:31] bring us to our expected end which is
[1:11:33] the overcomer's throne
[1:11:35] Hallelujah so you see even though we're
[1:11:37] surrounded by many enemies now it's
[1:11:39] going to read this because I enjoy
[1:11:40] Psalms 23. it says yo that yea though
[1:11:42] walk through the valley of the shadow of
[1:11:44] death I will fear no evil now this is
[1:11:47] not mind over matter just something in a
[1:11:48] Believer I have no fear I don't know
[1:11:50] what I'd feel like when I got to this
[1:11:52] point but I just have no fear you you
[1:11:54] can hear many testimonies of those who
[1:11:55] are on death's door who thought they
[1:11:57] were going to die no fear you can speak
[1:11:59] to Christine then Switzerland many years
[1:12:01] ago she'd had an overdose anaphylactic
[1:12:04] reaction to Tramadol found herself
[1:12:05] leaving her body and a an unbelieving
[1:12:08] auntie he's there by the bedside crying
[1:12:10] and she's saying I just wish I could
[1:12:12] tell her how great this is
[1:12:14] no fear
[1:12:16] why because she settled her account long
[1:12:18] ago at Calvary
[1:12:19] amen but you see there's many examples
[1:12:22] like that there's just no fear and
[1:12:23] humanly it seems very strange
[1:12:26] but but that oil of gladness just takes
[1:12:28] over like never before
[1:12:30] Hallelujah you see because you realize
[1:12:32] now it's like when death starts to
[1:12:33] strike the real you comes out in a
[1:12:35] greater measure
[1:12:37] so if you love them more if you love
[1:12:39] them now you just wait till these five
[1:12:40] senses leave and you realize actually
[1:12:42] you are you know it's like our brother
[1:12:44] and now the opposite of that is you know
[1:12:45] brother Ram said about that Sunday
[1:12:46] school teacher she was dying you know
[1:12:49] the class even came into the hospital
[1:12:50] room and then her brother said her her
[1:12:53] human Spirit was leaving her mental
[1:12:55] faculty were leaving and she realized
[1:12:56] her true state I'm lost cries out to her
[1:13:00] pastor you deceiver of man so she
[1:13:03] thought she was fine until that moment
[1:13:05] she realized she wasn't fine now you
[1:13:07] take that into the positive now
[1:13:11] you know how the devil fights us you're
[1:13:13] not a Christian you'll never overcome
[1:13:15] you're never gonna get there and then
[1:13:17] there's that moment
[1:13:19] with actually these human factors leave
[1:13:21] I have I'm more found than I realized
[1:13:24] I'm more secure than I've ever been
[1:13:25] about that Hallelujah I'm not a strong
[1:13:27] Foundation it's greater than I ever
[1:13:29] thought hallelujah amen
[1:13:35] oh my hallelujah hallelujah

[1:13:49] amen but thou Anointed with my head
[1:13:51] whether or no thou prepares the table

[1:14:17] what worth with sadness sorrow pain
[1:14:19] sickness no with joy maybe which is
[1:14:22] beyond anything that's going on in our
[1:14:23] lives and my cup runneth over amen David

[1:14:28] what I was like to get happy in the
[1:14:29] presence of God Amen I say how much more
[1:14:31] are people under the blood of Jesus
[1:14:33] Christ everywhere it's God's not just
[1:14:34] with them but in them Hallelujah
[1:14:38] Hallelujah you see now this oil of
[1:14:40] gladness makes us very bold
[1:14:43] when you get anointed you feel like you
[1:14:44] can take on anything yeah amen you see
[1:14:47] this here and we go with David David
[1:14:49] before the host of the Philistines and

[1:14:55] I'm gonna annihilate this whole Army he
[1:14:56] was anointed with the oil of gladness I
[1:14:59] mean that what what why is it an oil of
[1:15:01] gladness in that situation because you
[1:15:02] know your God can do anything against
[1:15:05] any enemy and you'll come out packing
[1:15:07] the victory Hallelujah so yo if you ever
[1:15:10] get fearful you say no that's not my
[1:15:12] anointing you get worried about what you
[1:15:14] say no that's not my anointing my
[1:15:16] anointing is an anointing of boldness
[1:15:18] and courage and a stability Hallelujah
[1:15:22] amen
[1:15:23] praise God now
[1:15:25] you know this this oil is unlimited
[1:15:29] the devil can't limit it God's poured it
[1:15:32] poured out all the I know what all the
[1:15:34] Vats of Heaven the whole thing who's
[1:15:37] ever like poured out a bucket or like a
[1:15:39] swimming pool or say it's just it just
[1:15:41] goes everywhere Hallelujah that's what
[1:15:43] God's done it's not just an anointing by
[1:15:46] measure even down through the church
[1:15:48] ages anointing by measure because that's
[1:15:50] that part of the word down through each
[1:15:52] age you're still the Holy Ghost working
[1:15:53] but now it's the full word has opened up
[1:15:56] because the seals reveal Christ
[1:15:59] Hallelujah so now the anointing that's
[1:16:01] on this ages without measure
[1:16:05] I like a lot of food I like a lot
[1:16:08] oh
[1:16:10] I bet
[1:16:12] praise God so that's without measure
[1:16:14] amen we have more than just what Luther
[1:16:17] had though we have what Luther had but
[1:16:19] plus right we have more than what Wesley
[1:16:21] had but we're well we're but we have
[1:16:22] what where's he about plus and the same
[1:16:25] with the Pentecost we have that plus
[1:16:26] because God's a god of addition amen but
[1:16:29] we because the full word has come open
[1:16:31] this anointing is not limited amen and
[1:16:34] the devil can't limit it Hallelujah even
[1:16:38] under the third seal if we can go there
[1:16:41] even under the third seal where there's
[1:16:43] the black horse rider hey man he's
[1:16:45] riding with those scales in his hand oh
[1:16:47] yeah a pair of balances in his hand but
[1:16:49] notice this voice that actually tells
[1:16:51] you tells him what he can and cannot do
[1:16:53] that's why I'm so thankful the devil's
[1:16:55] got to ask permission before he does
[1:16:57] anything he's got to ask permission from
[1:16:59] our God and God has the final yes or no
[1:17:01] the devil can't sing he's not the
[1:17:04] devil's not like a rebellious child that
[1:17:06] you tell them no and they just do the
[1:17:08] yes anyway
[1:17:09] no if it's a no it's a no and he can't
[1:17:12] make it a yes hallelujah our god has all
[1:17:14] control of everything amen so notice
[1:17:17] this voice from the midst of the 4B so
[1:17:19] this is the voice from the Throne of God
[1:17:20] itself
[1:17:21] this is a measure of wheat for a penny
[1:17:23] and three misses of barley for a pennies
[1:17:25] in other words you can you can control
[1:17:29] the bread of life in this way the staff
[1:17:31] of life you know natural things but see
[1:17:33] thou hurt not the oil in the wine
[1:17:36] so Satan you can control economics you
[1:17:38] can do all these different kind things
[1:17:40] but you cannot hurt the oil the
[1:17:42] anointing oil and stimulation by
[1:17:44] Revelation you cannot stop that Satan

[1:18:02] of unlimited Revival Hallelujah this is
[1:18:05] the age we're living in right now amen

[1:18:10] can sure fight he fights I know he
[1:18:12] fights and tries to stop and get us
[1:18:13] distracted but he can't stop the flow of
[1:18:16] the anointing
[1:18:17] Hallelujah and he can't stop amen the
[1:18:21] the wine the stimulation of the
[1:18:23] Revelation amen amen he would love to
[1:18:25] stop it he would love to he would love
[1:18:27] to make us all formal lukewarm powerless
[1:18:29] and cold he would love this church to be
[1:18:31] that way he would love your life to be
[1:18:33] that way but God's saying you can't do
[1:18:35] that to them amen you can't do that to
[1:18:38] them no they have they have an open
[1:18:41] they have all access to all that I am

[1:22:18] around like drunk people in the book of
[1:22:20] Acts Acts chapter 2 where they receive
[1:22:22] the oil of gladness amen because I saw

[1:24:07] greatest achievement

[1:24:14] preached amen John would say he would
[1:24:17] Rejoice saying because he's saying he is
[1:24:19] the friend of the bridegroom
