[33:01] to your hands and um
[33:02] yeah just bless us we pray in jesus name
[33:04] amen
[33:06] praise the lord god bless you all this
[33:07] evening
[33:09] how's everyone doing good good that's
[33:11] good thank you
[33:13] musicians it does feel a little bit more
[33:15] spacious up here
[33:17] it's nice praise the lord um
[33:23] okay um so i'm going to go through this
[33:25] reason
[33:26] um let's go to the next one and we'll
[33:29] just
[33:30] read and then you can have your seats
[33:33] so my thought i've got tonight is called
[33:36] the future
[33:39] who has a future
[33:42] it's in about one seconds time we just
[33:43] arrived that's how the future works
[33:47] um and it's in a small way it's a
[33:51] continuation of what um brother um
[33:54] james spoke about last week but just
[33:56] from a different perspective
[33:58] so um the scripture that i've got
[34:01] for this is um matthew 25 13 and says
[34:04] watch
[34:05] therefore for you know neither the day
[34:07] nor the hour
[34:09] wherein the son of van cometh you don't
[34:11] know what time in the future that will
[34:12] be
[34:13] you can take your seats um this evening
[34:16] i'm going to go through this uh
[34:17] reasonably quick
[34:19] because i thought this was maybe i
[34:21] thought it maybe i didn't maybe i didn't
[34:23] think about it enough to
[34:25] be concerned but i thought this was
[34:26] actually a normal preaching service not
[34:28] a prayer service
[34:30] so i've lined up a preaching service
[34:34] size sermon so you might not be saying
[34:37] that after an hour brother
[34:40] no look if i go fast i can get through
[34:41] it real quick but i i think by the grace
[34:43] of god we can
[34:45] i believe i'm dealing with intelligent
[34:47] people that can
[34:48] just focus and come through that's and
[34:51] look once again i'm not going to say
[34:52] to you anything that you don't already
[34:55] know
[34:56] i'm not clever enough for that i just
[34:58] sort of get a whole lot of stuff that
[34:59] you do know and put it all together
[35:00] and if you get enough of the same thing
[35:02] people think wow but i'm not giving you
[35:04] anything
[35:05] you're not going to get anything well
[35:07] hey maybe you might but i'm
[35:09] i'm not going to say that i'm going to
[35:10] say that by goes grace's word is just
[35:13] it's it's just nice it's just sound you
[35:15] know and it just all makes sense
[35:16] that's what i love about the word of god
[35:18] it all makes sense
[35:19] if it doesn't make sense we can just
[35:21] wait on the lord and eventually it all
[35:22] makes sense and and
[35:23] everything in life makes sense when we
[35:26] apply
[35:27] the wisdom of god to life and the more
[35:29] the wisdom of god that we get in our
[35:31] life the more life makes sense
[35:32] everything makes sense even things that
[35:34] don't make sense we know why it doesn't
[35:35] make sense
[35:36] we know why this world is a mess and a
[35:38] mess because
[35:40] we're living in a a permissive
[35:42] world-type state that's not going to
[35:43] make any sense so we don't try and make
[35:44] sense of this world
[35:45] and try and make it a certain way
[35:47] because we know it's not going to be
[35:48] that way
[35:49] praise the lord okay so now what we're
[35:51] going to talk about tonight
[35:52] in a few different um aspects of it as
[35:55] is the future right so so
[35:59] but i want to start by by just talking
[36:02] about our ability to see
[36:04] things right because
[36:07] this thing called the future is as a to
[36:10] us as a mysterious
[36:11] area that we don't have access to and
[36:13] it's kind of strange
[36:15] like in a natural sense with our eyes we
[36:18] can see
[36:19] forward right so we look at a road here
[36:21] and we can see down the road
[36:23] imagine if you couldn't see ford if
[36:24] you're going to see backwards you know
[36:26] whatever
[36:27] okay so so we there's a lot of things in
[36:29] life that we have the ability to
[36:31] look into like i can say oh i'm gonna
[36:34] walk down this road to that mountain
[36:35] over there and there's we can walk
[36:36] walk and get to the mountain because
[36:38] we've got the ability to see
[36:41] this way right this might not
[36:44] be relevant but maybe it is we can see
[36:47] like things like numbers we've got the
[36:49] ability to look downwards into numbers
[36:51] and see
[36:52] see a long long way in numbers now
[36:53] numbers all make sense but we've got
[36:55] this ability as a human to
[36:57] we can look down we can make sense of it
[36:59] we can travel if i said to you if you
[37:00] start at one and you count to a hundred
[37:02] if you travel if you go there you'll get
[37:04] to 100. we we know that that's
[37:05] we can look down in that path right this
[37:08] is just we may we
[37:09] i've just given you a few examples of
[37:11] how we have this ability to look
[37:14] forward to to look right
[37:17] we've got this ability also to look at
[37:19] like um
[37:20] action consequence we've got to look
[37:22] forward into that
[37:24] realm as well i like this verse
[37:27] surely the tuning of milk brings forth
[37:29] butter and the ringing of no
[37:31] of the nose bringeth forth blood so
[37:34] forcing a breath bringeth for strife
[37:36] so we can say so you can look ahead and
[37:38] say if you if you beat the butter like
[37:40] this
[37:40] then further down the track you'll have
[37:42] if you beat the cream
[37:43] further down the track you'll have the
[37:44] butter and if you punch some in the nose
[37:47] enough times eventually blood will flow
[37:49] out of his nose so
[37:50] yes knows uh so the forcing of wrath
[37:53] bring a full strike
[37:54] there's this you know we've got this
[37:56] ability to look forward into lots of
[37:58] things
[37:59] it and it helps us actually get around
[38:01] it helps us get by you know
[38:02] this ability to look forward but there's
[38:05] this
[38:05] one kind of frustrating thing
[38:09] that we cannot look into we we
[38:13] something stops us from seeing it we
[38:16] and that's the future that's we're on
[38:19] this
[38:20] we're on this line of time and we only
[38:23] get to see the present we cannot
[38:25] look past that we cannot look past the
[38:28] present
[38:30] and it's it's it's a funny way that
[38:33] humans are made but we all
[38:37] possess the same function right that we
[38:40] that that we're we're stuck in this
[38:42] thing that we actually can't see
[38:43] and nobody can see the smartest man in
[38:45] the world can't see
[38:48] people people all have a future they
[38:50] can't see
[38:51] you you can't see it like i've got this
[38:55] guy here i've got the past and the
[38:56] present
[38:56] and and right on the line there is as
[38:58] far as you can see
[39:00] you can't you can't see one minute ahead
[39:01] of you you can't
[39:04] right and there's this mysterious place
[39:07] called the future
[39:08] that lays before all of us
[39:12] but these things amaze me and amaze my
[39:17] mind like what it did david when he
[39:20] started thinking about the ways of god
[39:21] and he said
[39:22] he just said i can't fathom how this all
[39:25] works it's too
[39:27] such knowledge is too big for me to
[39:30] comprehend
[39:32] right now we look at the future as being
[39:34] something new
[39:36] every day like oh there's a new day
[39:38] tomorrow there's a new future
[39:41] and it's the strangest concept to
[39:43] understand that somebody's been there
[39:45] already
[39:50] this my brain has trouble dealing with
[39:53] this
[39:53] but i believe it i'm just saying i have
[39:55] trouble dealing with it
[39:57] i want to read you the scripture this is
[39:59] jesus speaking he said and when they
[40:01] came now to jerusalem unto beth fudge in
[40:04] bethany
[40:04] at the mount of olives he send us forth
[40:06] two of his disciples and saith unto them
[40:08] go your way
[40:09] into the village over against you and as
[40:11] soon as you be entered into it you shall
[40:13] find
[40:14] a cult tied where never man set loose
[40:17] him and bring him
[40:20] so now i know they're going distance but
[40:23] he's saying when you
[40:24] get there in the future you'll find it
[40:25] there
[40:27] it'll be there
[40:31] i often say hey can you go there and
[40:32] pick up this tool someone goes to get
[40:34] the tool oh the tool's not there
[40:35] oh i left it there but in the meantime
[40:37] someone's taken a tool somewhere else
[40:39] so i i was just hoping it would still be
[40:41] there but i wasn't sure it would be
[40:42] there i was presuming it would be there
[40:45] jesus is saying at that point in the
[40:47] future it'll be there
[40:48] when you get to that place then he said
[40:51] and if any man said to you unto you why
[40:52] do you this say him that the lord hath
[40:54] need of him
[40:55] and straight away he will send him
[40:56] hither
[40:58] so also when you get there if someone
[40:59] asks you tell them this and they will
[41:00] tell you this
[41:02] in the future and been there hasn't
[41:04] arrived yet
[41:06] and they found the cult by the door and
[41:08] they went their way and found the cult
[41:09] by the door
[41:10] without in a place where two ways met
[41:12] and they lose him and certain of them
[41:14] that stood there said unto him what do
[41:16] you
[41:16] loosen the cult and they said unto him
[41:19] even as jesus had commanded
[41:21] and they let them go jesus has need of
[41:24] it okay you can take it
[41:28] this event had already happened at some
[41:29] point it was it already happened
[41:32] somebody was there and saw it happen
[41:34] before it happened
[41:36] this amazes me because this makes the
[41:39] world a very very different place when
[41:40] we
[41:41] understand this the world is not just us
[41:44] and going along we know that but it just
[41:48] the more we realize it
[41:50] the less we actually worry and then he
[41:52] said all this was done
[41:54] that it might be fulfilled which was
[41:55] spoken by the prophet saying
[41:57] tell ye the daughter of zion behold the
[41:59] king cometh unto thee meek and sitting
[42:01] upon a donkey
[42:02] and on a cult the foal of a donkey so
[42:06] maybe a thousand years before this
[42:08] someone else has said oh by the way
[42:10] at this point someone's going to
[42:13] this man is going to ride on a hall on a
[42:15] on a cult and he's going to he's going
[42:17] to come riding in on a cult
[42:19] this was even before that happened a
[42:21] thousand years before this or however
[42:22] long it was
[42:23] this is what's going to happen this
[42:25] event had already happened and
[42:26] someone already knew about this event
[42:28] happening
[42:30] somebody's walking around in this place
[42:32] we call the future
[42:34] as if it's the past we just can't see it
[42:37] our eyes we've got something over our
[42:40] eyes that
[42:41] make us not be able to see but someone's
[42:43] seen it all
[42:46] someone's seen it all
[42:51] now i want to i want to just talk about
[42:55] this for a
[42:57] minute because it just to reiterate what
[43:00] i've been saying
[43:01] this is brother branham and he's saying
[43:04] he he was in a he was overseas and he
[43:07] saw the the boy that had been hit i
[43:08] think was a motor
[43:10] accident right then he realized
[43:14] i've seen this before this event has
[43:17] happened before and i've seen it
[43:19] and he said turn back to the fly leaf
[43:22] he's telling the brothers of them you
[43:23] look in your fl in your fly leaf i had
[43:26] people all over
[43:27] america write in the fly leaf of their
[43:28] bibles see if it would come to pass see
[43:30] if it was i said read your fly leaf look
[43:33] look at there i said see them cedar
[43:35] trees see them rocks
[43:37] boy about eight years old light brown
[43:39] hair croc haircut big brown eyes
[43:42] legs broke down hands like this
[43:44] automobile
[43:45] why brother moore that's the boy exactly
[43:48] so
[43:50] he's seen it before we've i've i've seen
[43:54] this event before
[43:55] someone's been there jesus has been
[43:59] there
[43:59] he he walks he walks outside of our
[44:03] time and he's he's been there right he's
[44:05] been into the future
[44:08] this is the great thing about the great
[44:10] test about being a christian
[44:11] is actually the future that's the great
[44:13] test do you think if we
[44:15] that's the really thing that we don't
[44:16] know that if you did if we knew the
[44:18] future we wouldn't have to have faith we
[44:20] we wouldn't have to say i believe the
[44:21] lord will provide because when we say
[44:22] that we say
[44:23] he'll provide in the future it's
[44:24] something where i can't see but i
[44:26] believe he will
[44:26] if we didn't have this call it blindness
[44:29] then
[44:30] and we knew what would happen then we
[44:31] couldn't have faith for that event to
[44:33] happen that's how this
[44:35] that's the beauty of this system that
[44:37] the lord's made all his systems are
[44:38] wonderful
[44:41] okay like like let's just touch on this
[44:42] concept of faith real quick like
[44:45] all of the promises of god are actually
[44:49] the result is in the future where we
[44:50] can't see and that's what faith
[44:52] has to do is take hold of him say in the
[44:53] future this will happen like this
[44:54] because his word says here that it will
[44:56] happen
[44:57] don't forget jesus is standing in the
[44:58] future saying yeah that's what will
[44:59] happen
[45:00] i'm here arranging it for you the way
[45:04] that you believe it if you can take it
[45:06] that way
[45:07] they shall take up serpents and if they
[45:08] drink anything
[45:10] now it shall not hurt them in the future
[45:14] they shall lay hands on the sick that
[45:15] are sick and then in the future they
[45:17] shall recover
[45:18] right right but the thing that accesses
[45:20] the future for us is faith
[45:23] see that that's the thing that ties that
[45:25] ties us to the
[45:26] promise in the future is this thing
[45:29] that's the eyes that actually have the
[45:30] ability to look into the future as the
[45:32] eyes of faith i say we can't see it we
[45:34] actually can
[45:35] if we believe it that way we can we can
[45:37] see into the future
[45:38] because i say i laid hands on this sick
[45:40] person
[45:42] in the future they will recover might be
[45:44] tomorrow might be next week might be
[45:45] week after but faith says they will
[45:47] recover right
[45:48] uh faith it can also
[45:52] in the future could be victory if that's
[45:54] what you so need
[45:55] right um no weapon that is formed
[45:57] against he shall prosper
[45:58] and every tongue that shall rise against
[46:00] the unjudgement thou shalt condemn
[46:02] in the future if anyone comes against
[46:04] you you will defeat them a name
[46:06] in the name of the lord that's what's
[46:07] your that's what lies in the future for
[46:09] you
[46:09] right this is the hero to drop the
[46:10] servants of the lord and the
[46:11] righteousness is of
[46:13] him or or let's say for blessing
[46:16] you want blessing in your life jesus
[46:19] says
[46:20] that we're talking financial blessing he
[46:21] said those things he said bring me all
[46:23] the tithes into the storehouse that
[46:24] there may be meat in my house and prove
[46:26] me now herewith that if not that
[46:28] sometime in the future sayeth the lord
[46:30] of hosts
[46:32] if i will not open the windows of heaven
[46:34] and pour you out a blessing that there
[46:35] shall not be room enough to contain it
[46:37] that's a that's a so we we so now for
[46:40] for a result
[46:42] in the future by faith right
[46:45] that's how that's how this christian
[46:46] walk works and that's faith is
[46:49] a more mature faith knows it doesn't
[46:51] sort of hope for it it knows it okay if
[46:52] i do this this will happen end of story
[46:55] this is the way it's going to be don't
[46:56] forget now i've kept the pictures of the
[46:58] lord in the future because he's always
[47:00] in the future
[47:01] we worry he doesn't worry he's there
[47:03] he's or he's standing there
[47:05] he's standing in our fearful tomorrow
[47:07] he's right there he's
[47:08] there he knows that he doesn't worry
[47:09] about anything he's just there
[47:11] he has to be there he has to be
[47:14] if he's not there he has to he has to
[47:17] already be there
[47:18] he's already at tomorrow already there
[47:22] right okay
[47:25] so i'm gonna i'm gonna i'm gonna segue
[47:27] slightly here just to
[47:28] bring it from a different perspective
[47:29] then like we can worry about the future
[47:32] a lot of times
[47:33] and it can derail our christian walk if
[47:35] we worry about the future
[47:37] right and now jesus deals with this
[47:39] concept of the future
[47:41] because there's a way that a christian
[47:42] ought to deal with the future that's
[47:44] very very simple
[47:46] and that is don't worry about anything
[47:48] don't worry
[47:49] and don't try and make an effort to make
[47:51] your future better for yourself in this
[47:53] life that's what he said don't make an
[47:54] effort to do that
[47:56] that's contrary to the way that we want
[47:58] to do because we're unsure of the future
[47:59] so we want to make an effort to make it
[48:00] better for us there
[48:02] right but i want to read you these just
[48:04] go through what the bible says therefore
[48:05] i say unto you
[48:06] take no thought for your life i.e what's
[48:09] our life
[48:10] our life is basically the future we're
[48:14] genuinely not
[48:15] we're worried about the future not the
[48:16] past the past has been it's the future
[48:18] we worry about
[48:19] take no thought for your life what you
[48:20] shall eat or what you shall drink nor
[48:22] yet for your body what you shall put on
[48:25] is not life more than meat and the body
[48:27] than raiment so saying
[48:29] don't even think about it don't even
[48:30] worry about it don't worry about your
[48:32] future
[48:33] behold the fowls of the air for they sow
[48:36] not neither do they reap nor gather into
[48:37] barns
[48:38] you heavenly father feedeth them we
[48:41] think well if i don't do this and this
[48:42] this the next year at this point i'm
[48:43] going to have this and this and this
[48:45] he's saying look at the fouls they don't
[48:46] do any of that they get fed why are you
[48:48] striving to go and do that
[48:50] consider the fouls are you not much more
[48:54] than they what's your view by taking
[48:55] thought can add one cubit to a stature
[48:57] and why take your thought for raymond
[48:59] why were what are you going to put on
[49:00] tomorrow consider the lilies of the
[49:02] field how they grow they toil not
[49:04] neither do they spin
[49:07] yet i say unto you that solomon that
[49:09] even solomon in all his glory was not
[49:10] arrayed like one of these
[49:12] consider that lilia just doesn't do
[49:14] anything
[49:15] doesn't try and get a nice nice clothes
[49:18] it just
[49:19] basically sits back and does nothing and
[49:21] ends up with something
[49:22] that's different than the concept that
[49:23] we think we need to do but this is what
[49:25] the lord is saying that we should be
[49:26] and there's a very important reason why
[49:28] is because if we start thinking on these
[49:30] things
[49:30] then it derails our the word of god
[49:32] that's in us and our christian thrust in
[49:34] our life
[49:34] if we start thinking of our future in
[49:37] the wrong way that's why he said
[49:38] you need don't think about that right
[49:41] wherefore i've got god so clothed the
[49:43] grass of the field which today is in
[49:44] tomorrow's cast into the oven
[49:45] shall he not much more clothe ye a ye of
[49:47] little faith
[49:49] therefore take no thought saying what
[49:51] shall we eat or what shall we drink or
[49:53] with all shall we be clothed
[49:54] for after all these things do the
[49:56] gentiles seek why because they don't
[49:57] deal in faith in the future
[49:59] they deal and i i don't believe there's
[50:02] any i believe i've got to do it all
[50:03] myself and figure it all out myself
[50:05] therefore i've got to put on all my
[50:06] worldly effort to make my future better
[50:08] for myself
[50:09] and the more that i do that the more of
[50:10] an esteemed human being i am and i'm
[50:12] actually
[50:13] i'm an esteemed honourable human being
[50:14] because look how much i've
[50:16] got for myself for the future but that's
[50:19] nonsense
[50:20] if you're a christian it's nonsense it's
[50:22] a carnal worldly way of thinking that we
[50:23] shouldn't
[50:24] go down that track because we'll derail
[50:26] our christian life
[50:27] for all these things do this gentiles
[50:29] seek for your heavenly father
[50:31] knoweth that you have need of all these
[50:32] things but seek ye first the kingdom of
[50:34] god and his righteousness and all these
[50:35] things shall be added unto you
[50:37] take no thought for the morrow for the
[50:38] moral shall take thought for itself
[50:39] sufficient
[50:40] until the day is the evil thereof don't
[50:43] worry about it leave it don't even think
[50:44] about it don't worry about it
[50:46] just just seek me in my righteousness
[50:49] and i'll just deal with all that
[50:51] either way right but now we've got to
[50:54] make sure that we
[50:54] understand that the either way god's
[50:57] limited his
[50:59] i think i could say this he's put it
[51:00] he's put a limitation on his contract
[51:02] with us
[51:03] lord you said you'd give me all these
[51:04] things he actually didn't just to
[51:06] just to sort of make it as if i serve
[51:08] god then everything in my life will all
[51:10] just turn out rosy
[51:11] it may not and if it doesn't he never
[51:14] promised that it would
[51:14] yeah right the only real thing is he's
[51:17] promised even in those scriptures with
[51:19] food and clothing
[51:21] when you if you find the other places
[51:23] where we promise you'll get all these
[51:24] other things
[51:25] he said food and clothing he limited as
[51:27] part of the contract to food and
[51:29] clothing
[51:29] because he knows that's actually all you
[51:30] need to stay alive i need food
[51:32] need to be clothed and i live for
[51:33] another day
[51:36] but that's what it says and that's why
[51:38] that's why paul says but godliness with
[51:40] contentment is great gain for we've
[51:41] brought nothing into this world
[51:43] and it is certain we can carry nothing
[51:44] out
[51:46] and having food and raiment it has to be
[51:48] there with content
[51:49] so saying if you've got food you've got
[51:50] clothes done you you're sorted the lord
[51:53] has looked after you 100
[51:55] you've got no problems in the world all
[51:57] right that's that's all
[51:59] that's what it is now i'm going to touch
[52:02] on this one because
[52:04] this is now the parable of the sower so
[52:06] that the the um
[52:07] soil went to sowing some sowed amongst
[52:10] the um
[52:11] just fell on groundwork that just died
[52:13] straight away some fell amongst some
[52:15] um on the wayside although the first one
[52:18] that the birds of the air came and
[52:19] plucked it out the word of god didn't do
[52:21] anything in their life the second one
[52:22] was
[52:22] in sort of stony ground where it took
[52:25] root straight away but then
[52:26] when pressure came on when people
[52:28] realized oh i've actually got to pay a
[52:29] price to serve the lord they
[52:30] weren't interested in making any sort of
[52:32] sacrifice for the lord so that seed died
[52:34] the third one fell among thorns so this
[52:37] word fell into someone's life but it
[52:38] started growing up
[52:40] but then it says but he also then the
[52:42] thorns started to grow around the seed
[52:46] and made the seed not be able to bring
[52:48] forth the
[52:49] fruit of the word that was in it that it
[52:50] was supposed to he also that
[52:52] received the seed among thorns is he
[52:54] that heareth the word
[52:56] and the care of this world to start
[52:59] putting the effort into
[53:00] into the future to as a care of the
[53:02] world
[53:03] and the deceitfulness of riches because
[53:05] it's not actually bad
[53:07] i can help people the safeness of riches
[53:10] choke the word and become unfruitful
[53:12] right because they they although the
[53:16] word was growing in there they had all
[53:17] these other things in their life
[53:20] we can that choke the word and it
[53:22] becomes unfruitful very very easily can
[53:24] the word of god that's in us become
[53:25] unfruitful because
[53:26] we think we're doing the right thing by
[53:28] by putting effort into the future but
[53:30] we're actually not supposed to put any
[53:32] i know that might sound quite out of
[53:34] left field but that's actually what the
[53:36] bible says
[53:37] oh brother lord call me do this well are
[53:39] you sure are you sure
[53:42] we get programmed into this mode that oh
[53:44] no the you know i really feel but
[53:47] you got to make sure you feel that from
[53:49] the lord it's not just
[53:50] our pressure of conforming to the way
[53:53] that
[53:54] a smart wise person should act and then
[53:56] go and do that
[53:58] do you understand what i mean right
[54:00] because we can easily
[54:01] i want to keep it right because we
[54:04] always you know we can
[54:06] we can get on this track so easily and
[54:08] the word in our life gets choked out
[54:11] now let me say this now the future
[54:14] for for non-christian people is whatever
[54:16] life they have left that's what they
[54:17] call the future this is the life that
[54:19] i've got left
[54:19] that's the future because they believe
[54:21] when i die there's nothing so
[54:23] i've only got 30 years left to live i've
[54:24] got to you know if i don't do it now
[54:26] then in this amount of time i won't have
[54:27] this when i'm this agent
[54:29] right so then i've got to start putting
[54:31] effort in now for that right
[54:33] and i want to read this scripture and
[54:36] the lord commended the unjust steward
[54:37] because
[54:38] he had done wisely for the children of
[54:39] this world are in their generation wiser
[54:41] than the children of light
[54:43] so meaning that because
[54:46] they only focus on this on the life they
[54:50] have in this world
[54:51] then in the worldly sense they are going
[54:54] to be wiser than
[54:55] us because their efforts are going to be
[54:57] are going to give a better
[54:58] natural result than ours will because we
[55:01] our efforts are not going in towards
[55:02] this life they're going into
[55:04] a life to come right but worldly people
[55:06] are far smarter than us
[55:08] far far smarter because only because
[55:10] they have no faith
[55:12] and they put their effort to achieve
[55:13] things in this life and then that's it
[55:15] they're done
[55:16] like they because they they think
[55:18] they're done right
[55:19] and for a long time i used to think
[55:21] maybe i'm just really dumb you know
[55:23] maybe i'm just not i haven't got a lot
[55:25] enough now to me you know because i i
[55:26] think i'm
[55:27] you know these guys think that they
[55:28] think like that and i think like this
[55:30] you know i used to think i was a bit
[55:32] maybe a low iq i still think that but
[55:35] this has helped me to
[55:36] understand right that that that we as
[55:39] christians
[55:40] we go beyond this future we we our
[55:42] actions are for eternity
[55:44] that's where that's where our effort in
[55:46] this life is for eternity
[55:48] so we're actually one step ahead of the
[55:50] smart people we're sowing into eternity
[55:52] that's why i've got these two and two
[55:54] little brackets laying it up for
[55:55] yourselves treasures upon earth where
[55:56] moth and rust hath corrupt and where
[55:58] thieves break through and steal
[55:59] don't put your treasures here jesus sang
[56:02] don't put your treasures there
[56:03] but laugh for yourselves treasures in
[56:05] heaven
[56:07] which is all the things you do for no
[56:08] result
[56:11] all the times you take abuse and don't
[56:12] do anything
[56:14] all the effort you make for nothing it's
[56:15] all there right it's all there
[56:18] at the time it may seem like it's futile
[56:20] but it's not futile it's all there
[56:22] there's an account being saved up laugh
[56:24] yourselves treasures in heaven where
[56:25] neither
[56:26] moth nor rust earth corrupt and where
[56:27] thieves do not break through and steal
[56:29] but where your treasure is there will
[56:30] your heart be also very very easy to get
[56:33] our treasure here
[56:33] very very easy we we are made like that
[56:37] because that's the pride of life and
[56:38] everything kicks in we've got to have
[56:39] this like that guy because i've got to
[56:40] look like i'm sort of
[56:41] i know what i'm doing in the world i've
[56:43] got to make it hey we succumb to that
[56:45] pressure
[56:46] god's not interested in that pressure
[56:49] he's not interested in making us look
[56:50] different either
[56:52] this is the rich man that might put all
[56:54] his effort in you know the scripture but
[56:55] he put all his effort in for here and
[56:57] now
[56:58] and he said i'll say to my soul soul
[56:59] that has much goods laid out for many
[57:01] years take thy knees
[57:02] eat drink and be merry but god said unto
[57:04] him thou fall this night shall the soul
[57:06] be required of thee
[57:07] then who shall these things be which
[57:08] thou has provided
[57:10] all your effort what's the for all your
[57:13] life's effort
[57:14] for what
[57:17] so is he that lath up treasure for
[57:19] himself and is not rich toward god
[57:21] a life that just lays up treasure for
[57:23] themselves here and is not rich towards
[57:24] god as a wasted life
[57:26] absolute waste of them i don't care what
[57:27] they achieve they've wasted
[57:29] completely wasted their life
[57:33] well i'm here i just want to nail spare
[57:34] time is that all right real quick can i
[57:36] now spare time
[57:37] okay who's got who's got sort of a
[57:40] little bit of spare time
[57:42] who's got lots of spare time okay no one
[57:45] wants to put the hand up because they
[57:46] don't know what i'm going to say they're
[57:47] like i don't want to say that because
[57:48] you might prove me wrong there
[57:51] you go you're white so put your hand
[57:52] down we don't have any spare time
[57:56] no spare time whatsoever i want to show
[57:58] you why
[58:00] we have none nothing right
[58:03] now in order to have something spare you
[58:05] need to have a few components to get an
[58:07] end result right
[58:07] so so in order to have speed you need to
[58:11] first find out how much do i have
[58:13] right so i've got three i have three
[58:15] i've got three phones
[58:17] okay not a good example because how many
[58:20] do i need
[58:21] two right i only need two phones i've
[58:24] got three two then
[58:25] then by this definition the end result
[58:27] the end factor which is one
[58:28] that's what i've got spare right that's
[58:30] that's what we call oh you don't you can
[58:31] take my third phone that spare
[58:33] i don't need it i've got three you need
[58:35] two got one left right
[58:37] let's apply that same you know say
[58:38] that's how that's how spear works that's
[58:40] the concept of spare right so let's
[58:41] apply that definition to
[58:43] to time and our future how much do you
[58:45] have
[58:50] i might have one minute left i might
[58:51] have 20 years left i might have 25 i'm
[58:53] not sure
[58:54] i don't know how much i've got how much
[58:56] do you need
[58:59] well i need all of it actually every
[59:01] single last bit of time i need
[59:04] how much do you have spare none i've got
[59:07] nothing spare
[59:07] i allocate it to places i allocate it
[59:10] there's a huge difference i
[59:12] allocate it if i want to allocate it to
[59:13] wasting it on things that are futile
[59:16] then i can go and do that right we
[59:18] allocate it
[59:19] we don't oh i've got about a couple of
[59:20] days spare time i'll just do nothing
[59:23] no you allocated two days to do nothing
[59:25] we did right
[59:27] that's how it works we allocate it and
[59:29] every moment is precious
[59:31] every moment is hey man we might have
[59:33] one day left so
[59:34] 24 uh 12 hours is half your life left
[59:37] man
[59:38] i've only got half my life i'm gonna and
[59:40] in 24 hours
[59:41] i'll be gone man i'm going to make the
[59:44] most of my last 12 hours of my last 24
[59:46] hours see that you walk circumspectly
[59:49] not as fools but as wise redeeming the
[59:51] time because the days are evil wherefore
[59:52] be not unwise but understanding what the
[59:54] will of the lord is
[59:55] meaning redeem the time don't realize
[59:57] you've only got a limited amount of the
[59:59] stuff in the future
[1:00:00] there's only a small amount there you
[1:00:01] don't know how much you got redeem it
[1:00:03] take it real seriously what you're going
[1:00:04] to do with it take it real seriously and
[1:00:06] sow into the kingdom of god
[1:00:08] therefore now this is this is now
[1:00:11] solomon looking around at this concept
[1:00:13] and and understanding in all his wisdom
[1:00:15] that all of this all of these things we
[1:00:17] do is all futile
[1:00:18] it's a big complete waste of time he
[1:00:20] says man work work works works then they
[1:00:22] die then all this stuff gets passed on
[1:00:24] and they can't take any of it with him
[1:00:25] what's the point of all his labor
[1:00:27] he's starting to look around at the
[1:00:28] futility of life and he was absolutely
[1:00:30] correct
[1:00:30] he says therefore i hated life because
[1:00:32] the work that is wrought under the sun
[1:00:33] is grievous unto me for it is all vanity
[1:00:35] and vexation of spirit
[1:00:37] that's all this life is if we just put
[1:00:39] it if we just sow into it that's all
[1:00:40] that
[1:00:40] all is that if you take it in that
[1:00:43] context right
[1:00:45] that's that brings me on to this that
[1:00:46] picture like this
[1:00:48] darts for argument's sake
[1:00:51] now people can allocate all of their
[1:00:53] future
[1:00:54] to throwing a little needle with some
[1:00:57] little wings on it onto a board on the
[1:00:58] wall that's about that far away
[1:01:02] then they go to another tournament
[1:01:05] and that's what they allocate their life
[1:01:07] to
[1:01:09] that's it what did you do with your life
[1:01:10] i threw needles into a board
[1:01:12] and you go and talk to them they talk
[1:01:13] about darts oh that starts they're
[1:01:15] telling different dart manufacturers
[1:01:17] you wouldn't believe how much
[1:01:18] information there is about darts but i
[1:01:19] can guarantee you these guys could keep
[1:01:21] you entertained for
[1:01:22] days about all the different facets
[1:01:23] there is to darts
[1:01:25] it's a complete waste of time a complete
[1:01:27] waste of time
[1:01:28] just like all sports are it was designed
[1:01:30] for children to have a little bit of fun
[1:01:32] kick a ball around you know hey we're
[1:01:33] just children we don't understand the
[1:01:35] concept of time we
[1:01:36] to us it's just it's an endless supply
[1:01:38] we just want to have fun and play which
[1:01:39] is fine you know the lord said when your
[1:01:40] child just enjoy
[1:01:42] being a youth until you get to solomon's
[1:01:44] point where you realize there's no
[1:01:45] it's all vanity then you've got to start
[1:01:47] thinking i've got to do something with
[1:01:47] it but when you're a child you just play
[1:01:49] sports is designed for little children
[1:01:51] to kick a ball around or run around with
[1:01:52] a ball
[1:01:53] not adults adults to run around with a
[1:01:56] ball
[1:01:56] and think it's serious it's nonsense i
[1:01:58] film a lot of sports
[1:02:00] and i've got to listen to commentators
[1:02:01] and coaches and that talk in my ear
[1:02:03] with all the commentary coming through
[1:02:04] and rambling on for three days about how
[1:02:07] important they think this thing is that
[1:02:08] we're watching
[1:02:13] and and i have this little i always have
[1:02:15] a
[1:02:16] i never tell him this but i've always
[1:02:17] got a i shouldn't say this but it's a
[1:02:20] waste of words but
[1:02:21] the judges you know often the judges and
[1:02:23] certain games get in the way of our
[1:02:25] camera view
[1:02:26] and we ask them to move they say i've
[1:02:27] got to be here because the rules say i
[1:02:28] must see this line and that line and
[1:02:30] there
[1:02:30] i've got to see when the ball's there i
[1:02:32] feel like saying look chill out mate
[1:02:34] this is a game it doesn't really matter
[1:02:36] and it's actually entertainment you know
[1:02:38] you're an entertainer so i've got i'm
[1:02:41] behind the camera
[1:02:42] i'm filming this thing people are
[1:02:43] watching it for entertainment man no one
[1:02:45] cares
[1:02:45] you know i'm actually above you it's not
[1:02:47] as important as what you think
[1:02:50] right but it's nonsense and the only
[1:02:52] reason why that it gets somewhere is
[1:02:53] because it's entertainment and it
[1:02:55] entertains people to spend their future
[1:02:56] watching it
[1:02:57] now now the the worst thing with this
[1:02:59] guy is there are people that watch darts
[1:03:01] spend their life watching darts
[1:03:04] can you believe that they'll sit down
[1:03:06] for three days and watch cars go around
[1:03:07] a circle
[1:03:08] and so and so one who cares who won
[1:03:10] where he won what
[1:03:12] no didn't when the next year is going to
[1:03:13] come back and do it all over again if
[1:03:14] and he
[1:03:15] he gets his cup he can't keep it another
[1:03:16] guy comes in and then and people are
[1:03:18] striving they want that cup so there's
[1:03:20] this big circle
[1:03:21] it's just to feed men and women into
[1:03:23] this machine steal their future then
[1:03:25] they die and go to hell that's all it's
[1:03:26] for
[1:03:27] to take their attention take their time
[1:03:29] and then they end up going to hell
[1:03:31] they've been entertained to hell because
[1:03:33] they thought car racing was important
[1:03:34] darts were important or something it's
[1:03:35] nonsense it's all nonsense
[1:03:37] i hope there aren't many sports fans in
[1:03:39] here
[1:03:41] i have to say it how does
[1:03:44] okay so now i'm almost done here but
[1:03:47] when we think of the future right
[1:03:49] you know when we're young we think we've
[1:03:50] got a bright future and everything no
[1:03:52] and i still believe i've got a great
[1:03:53] future because
[1:03:54] with the lord it always gets better
[1:03:55] right but our concept of the future
[1:03:57] changes when we're a believer it should
[1:03:58] get better but unfortunately when we uh
[1:04:01] you know when we're not a believer it
[1:04:02] can get quite clear you know that's
[1:04:03] where people can get depressed and down
[1:04:04] because they can't see
[1:04:06] they can see a repetition happening in
[1:04:07] the future of the past which was bad and
[1:04:09] that they may think oh it's going to go
[1:04:10] bad again anyway so
[1:04:12] but but really when we look at our
[1:04:14] future the future that we all have
[1:04:17] what do we have in the future really we
[1:04:20] we should be able to look according to
[1:04:22] the fact that someone's already been
[1:04:24] there and he's
[1:04:24] given us a few ideas this is what your
[1:04:26] future is going to look like then we
[1:04:27] should be able to look at that and say
[1:04:28] okay what does my future now
[1:04:30] and this timeline for the next amount of
[1:04:33] time till the world's done what does it
[1:04:34] look like
[1:04:35] and jesus there's a parable here jesus
[1:04:37] said now learn a parable of the fig tree
[1:04:39] when his branches eat tender and put us
[1:04:40] forth leaves you know that summer is
[1:04:42] nigh
[1:04:42] so likewise when you shall see all these
[1:04:44] things no it is at the door it is
[1:04:46] near even at the door really i say unto
[1:04:48] you this generation shall not pass till
[1:04:50] all these things be fulfilled
[1:04:51] right so saying at a certain point where
[1:04:53] you see the fig tree putting forth the
[1:04:55] spuds which is always israel when you
[1:04:56] see that putting forth the spuds
[1:04:57] the generation that sees that will not
[1:04:59] pass away till it's all fulfilled
[1:05:01] okay so now i want to do that you
[1:05:03] probably can't see this map but i've
[1:05:04] drawn a little arrow map of i think it's
[1:05:06] 1900 1900 120
[1:05:08] years ago you look at the map for israel
[1:05:12] you'll find turkey
[1:05:13] uh sorry yeah is it uh
[1:05:16] yeah yeah the turks yeah the turks the
[1:05:18] the ottoman empire turks the turks
[1:05:20] had it was part of that empire they were
[1:05:22] there that's why the australian light
[1:05:24] horsemen fighting the turks and
[1:05:25] and world war one that there was no
[1:05:27] country called israel as such on the map
[1:05:29] it didn't exist
[1:05:30] right now we look at a map in 2000
[1:05:33] there's a country there that exists
[1:05:36] like the the fig tree exists now it's
[1:05:38] there
[1:05:39] so you say when you when you see this
[1:05:41] thing start to grow up out of
[1:05:42] essentially nothing
[1:05:44] then this generation that saw that which
[1:05:45] was 40s
[1:05:47] won't pass away to all be fulfilled
[1:05:49] right so there's a specific timeline
[1:05:51] won't pass away everything's going to be
[1:05:53] fulfilled that's
[1:05:54] that's our future that's what lies ahead
[1:05:56] of us at some point
[1:05:57] right he said behold i'll send you
[1:05:59] elijah the prophet before the coming of
[1:06:00] the great and dreadful day of the lord
[1:06:02] before that happens i'll send you this
[1:06:03] person then you'll know
[1:06:04] you'll have that sign and that sign hey
[1:06:06] two or three witnesses that's enough my
[1:06:07] future's
[1:06:08] looking reasonably different than maybe
[1:06:11] 200 years ago is future
[1:06:13] my future's looking very different now
[1:06:15] we might say well i'm going to die
[1:06:16] anyway well
[1:06:17] yeah but there's a different concept we
[1:06:19] should put to it you know
[1:06:21] and it's should we adjust our life and
[1:06:24] how we do things based on the
[1:06:25] information that we know
[1:06:26] right now this might not seem very wise
[1:06:29] and there's
[1:06:29] there's this push always to go the other
[1:06:31] way but
[1:06:33] i think about it and i think well it
[1:06:34] would make logical sense to base my life
[1:06:37] around information that i know right
[1:06:39] because the last two slides i showed you
[1:06:40] i kind of know that
[1:06:42] but i shouldn't say i kind of know that
[1:06:43] i know this is pointed out your future's
[1:06:46] basically
[1:06:47] coming to an end and you've only got
[1:06:49] this amount of time it's going to be
[1:06:50] done right this is going to be done
[1:06:54] so now you have to you think about that
[1:06:56] about noah
[1:06:57] and the lord said unto noah the end of
[1:06:59] all flesh has come before me
[1:07:00] for the earth is filled with violence
[1:07:02] through them and behold i will destroy
[1:07:03] them with the earth
[1:07:04] so the lord said right this is what's
[1:07:05] going to happen the men are wicked i'm
[1:07:07] going to destroy them
[1:07:07] he told noah now
[1:07:11] based on that information what then
[1:07:13] should we do
[1:07:14] if we were back there well i would look
[1:07:17] around and say well my best bet is
[1:07:18] probably to help you build this boat
[1:07:20] and spend and you know be here that's my
[1:07:24] best bet if i know that's what's going
[1:07:25] to happen this is my escape this is
[1:07:26] where i should put my effort in
[1:07:28] if i didn't believe it i'd just carry on
[1:07:30] building because the bible said they
[1:07:31] built they sold their marriage they did
[1:07:32] all these things they lived their life
[1:07:35] and well that's not a bad thing to do
[1:07:37] brother we've got to do this that that
[1:07:39] yeah well what benefit would it have
[1:07:41] been for you to do that when
[1:07:43] in noah's time what benefit
[1:07:46] it's going to get flooded over in a
[1:07:47] certain amount of years mate when that
[1:07:48] boat's done
[1:07:49] when that boat's built and the rain
[1:07:50] comes your house is gone
[1:07:53] oh in 20 years i reap from this orchard
[1:07:58] don't you understand this is going to
[1:07:59] happen this is probably you i don't
[1:08:01] think you'll ever reap from that orchard
[1:08:03] you understand what i'm saying not to
[1:08:04] scare us but to really should we change
[1:08:06] our life based on information we know i
[1:08:08] think it's
[1:08:09] it's actually prudent that we should or
[1:08:10] you think about when when daniel and
[1:08:12] them were in were in babylon
[1:08:14] and daniel after a while he said in the
[1:08:16] first year of his reign
[1:08:17] i daniel understood by books i
[1:08:20] understood by the scriptures
[1:08:22] and god saying what the future would be
[1:08:24] the number of years
[1:08:25] where of the word of the lord came to
[1:08:26] jeremiah the prophet that he would
[1:08:28] accomplish 70 years in the desolation of
[1:08:29] jerusalem
[1:08:30] i understood that he said for that time
[1:08:33] you'll be there for about 70 years into
[1:08:34] the future and then at that time you'll
[1:08:36] be going back
[1:08:36] right so he had information about the
[1:08:38] future
[1:08:40] that he believed and i set my faith into
[1:08:42] the lord god to seek my prayer on
[1:08:43] supplications and fasting with sackcloth
[1:08:45] and ashes
[1:08:47] okay the 70 years is almost up that's
[1:08:48] and our future is now over in
[1:08:51] israel not here if you now you think
[1:08:54] about if there were some people that
[1:08:55] were sort of
[1:08:56] lukewarm believers that kind of believed
[1:08:58] that but kind of didn't and they started
[1:09:00] making an effort to
[1:09:01] build a business and the place where
[1:09:03] they were cause after seven years you
[1:09:04] get to know people you've been there 70
[1:09:05] years you've got contacts you're
[1:09:06] probably quite well-liked you
[1:09:08] you've mingled into the community you
[1:09:10] could start building up building a
[1:09:12] business doing this doing that
[1:09:13] daniel would've said hey what are you
[1:09:14] doing oh brother you know got to do
[1:09:16] these things you know provide for the
[1:09:18] family
[1:09:19] hey we're not staying we're not staying
[1:09:21] here
[1:09:24] the 70 years is always like we're going
[1:09:25] back there all the effort you put in
[1:09:26] here unless you're going to stay here
[1:09:28] with these guys
[1:09:29] all your effort is in vain
[1:09:32] i'm going to keep it that way people
[1:09:33] always want to correct it back the other
[1:09:34] one but you know
[1:09:36] but we do that too much to justify
[1:09:41] to justify adhering to the cares of this
[1:09:45] life
[1:09:45] you know we get about 15 of those to one
[1:09:48] of these
[1:09:49] so i'll keep it on this side this is the
[1:09:52] last quote i'm going to read then i'm
[1:09:53] done is that all right
[1:09:55] now now this is brother brown speaking
[1:09:57] about this and now this this will sort
[1:09:58] of
[1:09:59] seem to throw out everything i've said
[1:10:00] but it doesn't really when you
[1:10:02] if you be honest about it right should
[1:10:05] evangelist continue on the field
[1:10:06] in this hour so they're saying should we
[1:10:08] just stop you know
[1:10:10] he's here in this hour of course what
[1:10:12] they mean certainly by all means
[1:10:14] don't change your thing if jesus is
[1:10:16] coming in the morning preach today like
[1:10:17] it was going to be 10 years from today
[1:10:21] but live like it's going to be at this
[1:10:22] hour
[1:10:24] some people say plan like it's 100 years
[1:10:26] live like it's today but
[1:10:28] he said don't don't get scruffed up now
[1:10:31] that's what i'm trying to warn you about
[1:10:32] see just don't be the odd peculiar don't
[1:10:33] change nothing
[1:10:34] but if you're doing something wrong or
[1:10:36] doing evil repent see come back to god
[1:10:37] continue in your evangelistic service
[1:10:39] just as you always did
[1:10:40] if you're building a house put it on up
[1:10:44] jesus comes tomorrow you'll be found
[1:10:45] faithful at that duty
[1:10:47] yep if you're building a church go on
[1:10:49] put it up i'd rather be putting my money
[1:10:50] in something like that and be found
[1:10:52] let me found with it in my pocket i like
[1:10:54] that
[1:10:56] just just keep on continuously
[1:10:58] everywhere i understand congregation
[1:10:59] says amen
[1:11:00] continue right on and just go on as you
[1:11:02] are now just
[1:11:03] just don't stop don't do nothing just go
[1:11:04] right on just as you are keep on serving
[1:11:06] the lord now for instance
[1:11:07] if i was if i was working for a man and
[1:11:10] you know it was 15 minutes before
[1:11:11] quitting time well you say ah just 15
[1:11:13] minutes more so i might as well just
[1:11:14] go over and sit down you'll get docked
[1:11:16] for that 15 minutes you've got to you
[1:11:17] know you've got to work work right till
[1:11:18] the end
[1:11:20] if you're planting wheat plant your
[1:11:21] wheat you're digging potatoes go and dig
[1:11:22] them out
[1:11:23] say well nobody will eat them that don't
[1:11:25] make any difference dig them out anyhow
[1:11:26] see yeah just continue as you are i got
[1:11:28] a letter from someone the other day
[1:11:30] somebody told them
[1:11:31] well the time is at hand sell the farm
[1:11:32] you won't need the food
[1:11:34] that you that you live off of on the
[1:11:36] farm he said because this
[1:11:38] millennium is going to start and you
[1:11:39] won't need it so just go on ahead and
[1:11:41] while the tribulation period is going on
[1:11:42] your children is not safe just let them
[1:11:44] let the children have the farm where
[1:11:47] they can eat off of it but you'll sell
[1:11:48] your farm
[1:11:50] people did that at one point in the book
[1:11:52] of acts
[1:11:54] just to keep it in context right they
[1:11:57] did that
[1:11:58] and and or something like that and now
[1:12:01] they had it
[1:12:02] i said oh my i find it he was coming
[1:12:03] tomorrow and i was a farmer i'd put my
[1:12:05] crop in today sure he made me a farmer
[1:12:06] i'm going to stay
[1:12:07] at my duty that's right if you made me a
[1:12:09] mechanic said somebody said the other
[1:12:11] day
[1:12:11] a fella came in and said say brother you
[1:12:14] know what he said i'm going to give you
[1:12:15] the second set of keys i bought a new
[1:12:16] car he said i'm going to give you the
[1:12:17] second set of keys
[1:12:18] told his pastor said i'm going to give
[1:12:20] you the second set of keys because the
[1:12:21] rapture might
[1:12:22] come you know and i said i won't need it
[1:12:24] anymore
[1:12:25] the parcel is going to miss it you see
[1:12:26] so you keep my keys you stay here you
[1:12:27] can have the car
[1:12:29] oh that's making ready isn't it all
[1:12:32] right but that's the way it is see we
[1:12:33] mustn't
[1:12:34] be that way we we must be a sane solid
[1:12:37] christian see
[1:12:38] that i'm putting it to work right up to
[1:12:39] the last minute i've got a job today and
[1:12:40] i'll be right around faith with the post
[1:12:42] of duty
[1:12:42] if he comes in the morning i want to be
[1:12:44] standing right here in this people you
[1:12:45] say brother branham
[1:12:46] if he was to come this morning shouldn't
[1:12:47] you be out there i said no sir this is
[1:12:49] my post of duty i'll be standing right
[1:12:50] here preaching when he comes
[1:12:52] saying the same things i am then when he
[1:12:54] comes i'll just move right on with him
[1:12:56] see if i'm hiring potatoes i'll be
[1:12:58] hiding away just as hard as i can
[1:13:01] when he comes i'll just drop the hole
[1:13:02] and take off remember in the jubilee
[1:13:03] year that was
[1:13:04] if they was hoeing with a hoe they just
[1:13:07] kept on hiding they know the julie year
[1:13:08] was maybe
[1:13:09] 10 minutes more than the trumpet will
[1:13:11] sound at the jubilee year they just kept
[1:13:12] on pitching hey
[1:13:14] whatever they was doing but when the
[1:13:15] trumpet sounded then they dropped the
[1:13:16] pitchfork and gone see that's
[1:13:18] that's it just keep on pitching handle
[1:13:20] the trumpet sounds all right
[1:13:22] now i believe that i believe that's what
[1:13:25] we should do
[1:13:26] right but i also believe that we should
[1:13:29] make sure that what we are doing
[1:13:31] is the will of god for us and we're not
[1:13:33] just getting sucked into a care of this
[1:13:35] life which is
[1:13:36] very very easy to do because too many
[1:13:39] times
[1:13:40] people use that to justify what i'm you
[1:13:42] know i'm just going to do this and when
[1:13:43] the lord comes i'll be doing this
[1:13:45] but maybe they shouldn't be doing that
[1:13:46] they're doing that to
[1:13:48] secure their future not that there's
[1:13:51] anything wrong with that
[1:13:52] but if they're doing that because they
[1:13:54] think they need to secure the future
[1:13:55] therefore they're
[1:13:56] you can't train them out of it then how
[1:13:59] can god move
[1:14:01] how can god move in their life now this
[1:14:04] might sound
[1:14:05] oh that's not saying well the bible
[1:14:07] actually says to
[1:14:09] think like this think like this think
[1:14:12] like
[1:14:13] you didn't you it's a funny concept but
[1:14:16] he actually said act foolishly to what
[1:14:17] the world would call foolish
[1:14:20] see we're wise we we plan for the future
[1:14:22] and i sort it all out
[1:14:24] the lord actually said don't think like
[1:14:26] that don't worry about it
[1:14:29] i'm just saying what he said that's what
[1:14:30] he said right and
[1:14:32] and we just have to be honest with
[1:14:33] ourselves to make sure
[1:14:35] am i am i just pushing my way in my
[1:14:38] future and doing it my way out of fear
[1:14:40] out of worry out of because i've got a
[1:14:42] you know i've been so programmed this is
[1:14:44] the way to go
[1:14:46] am i am i doing it for that or or am i
[1:14:49] really pliable
[1:14:50] could the lord tell me tomorrow stop and
[1:14:51] i stop i do something else i couldn't
[1:14:52] care less
[1:14:54] really really you know that that's what
[1:14:57] and i believe each one of us are so i'm
[1:14:59] preaching to the converted here right
[1:15:00] i'm preaching to the converted but but
[1:15:02] it's something we all have to always
[1:15:04] check in our lives you know
[1:15:06] and and and don't be scared to look
[1:15:11] foolish to the world
[1:15:12] to have treasure in heaven it doesn't
[1:15:14] matter what the world thinks of us oh
[1:15:16] look at the car they drive whatever
[1:15:18] no no that doesn't matter the lord
[1:15:19] doesn't even look at that that's why
[1:15:21] jesus said it's a sin
[1:15:23] it's a sin to look upon one person and
[1:15:25] think that they are better than somebody
[1:15:26] else
[1:15:26] based on what they have he actually said
[1:15:29] in james it's a sin
[1:15:31] if you someone comes in and you esteem
[1:15:32] them more than someone else
[1:15:34] based on natural circumstances he said
[1:15:36] that's sin
[1:15:37] that's a strong word sinful behavior
[1:15:40] that's what he said i was shocked when i
[1:15:42] read the verse and realized that sin
[1:15:44] god calls it sin in our life we think
[1:15:46] sin is murder and adultery and things
[1:15:47] you see that sin to think like that
[1:15:50] let um stand this morning uh this
[1:15:53] morning
[1:15:54] this evening and we'll just um we're
[1:15:56] just praying then i'm going to hand the
[1:15:57] service over to um
[1:15:59] um brother ben just search your legs
[1:16:01] we'll pray
[1:16:02] thank you lord jesus for your grace to
[1:16:05] us
[1:16:07] lord and for the ability that we have
[1:16:09] lord as as
[1:16:12] just mere humans lord but we have the
[1:16:15] ability to make you
[1:16:16] the shepherd of our lives because you've
[1:16:18] called us lord jesus
[1:16:20] and lord we just want to daily surrender
[1:16:22] our life to your leadership
[1:16:24] lord jesus lord and may we may there be
[1:16:27] maybe nothing stopping each one of our
[1:16:29] lives that would
[1:16:30] that that lord your wish would be our
[1:16:32] command that if you said come here we go
[1:16:33] there
