[Music] so [Music] [Music] me praise the lord welcome to church again this morning it's good to it's good to be here it's good to be in the presence of god i was reading in um exodus last night and you know where the lord was dealing with moses and when they were leaving egypt and exodus 33 14 god said to moses he said my presence shall go with thee and i will give thee rest and then moses said if thy presence go not with me carry us not up hence and i think that's our prayer you know we like moses said lord if you're not going to come with us just leave us here you know i don't want to go i don't want to lead this people up to without the presence of god being with us if thy presence go not whether with me carry us not up hence and we just want to invite the presence of the lord with us this morning because we want the presence of the lord to carry us hence you know to move us forward we want his mind and his desires and everything that he wants to be manifest in our midst this morning so let's just stand and sing let's just stand and pray and then we'll sing some some worship songs to the lord heavenly father will you desire that this morning lord we know that there are many promises that you've laid out for us lord but we want just want to follow you day by day lord to attain those promises lord we desire your presence to go before us lord is moses said if thy presence go not with me then carry me not up hence lord and we ask that your presence will be with us this morning lord to to move us forward lord as that pillar of fire was there in the wilderness in the tabernacle in the wilderness lord if it was if it stayed there the people stayed but when it started to move then the people were moved lord may that be our experience lord may we just go with you lord as we see you moving in a direction we just follow you lord because you know the way through the wilderness lord you know the way through every every situation in our life you know the perfect way lord we don't want to think that we know the way lord but we want to surrender to you lord as brother adam said he would pray in the morning because he realized that life was too complicated for him he just wanted to be led by you daily lord so we just desire that this morning we ask that you'll um bless our service may come and meet with us lord bless the songs bless the ministry and bless our attitude may our attitude make you feel welcome lord and our our thoughts our mind our desire lord we know that you don't just you don't you see more than just the way we look lord but you see what our heart is like lord and that's what you respond to so may our heart be open may it be uncritical may desire to draw you into our midst may it be full of love for each other for you lord may there not be anything that would hinder us um this morning lord say we just thank you that we can come to you and you said we're two or three gathered together in your name there you are in the midst so we just um thank you for that lord and i just want to commit the service to you in jesus name amen amen praise the lord there's not one person in this world that i don't like i was just praying last night and i thought lord i have i just love everybody in the whole wide world i can't you know like when you realize the grace of god that's given to us to me how could you have any sort of true animosity i mean sometimes you get you know frustrated with so-and-so on this particular occasion because of this it's not really talking about that you know that's just the situation but but actual animosity or any negative feeling in your heart towards anyone that that just tears them down and i think lord your grace has built me up how could i have a little spot of any of that in me anywhere for anyone to tear someone down when i've been lifted up from the grace of god you know the bible says he has been forgiven much loveth much and it felt nice in prayer to know to say lord i actually don't have anything in my heart towards anybody ever anyone that's done anything towards me whatever amen you know it's a it's a peaceful feeling amen and that's that's you know when we get in that atmosphere that's where the spirit of god is you know that's where god dwells in in that type of atmosphere so let's let's get in that atmosphere this morning i was glad when they said let us go into

highway we're shouting on the hallelujah side i think it's a song but it's true isn't it glory be to jesus amy we got the victory today hallelujah so i think you know we've got a lot to be happy about i mean let's go to um i have lots of scriptures here but you know how things dance around a bit you know me by now anyway luke 22 31 we'll go here then we're gonna go acts 12. amen good to see each and every one of you today god bless you hallelujah amen i was telling christine we're walking out the door i feel like we're going to give the devil a couple of black eyes this morning amen why not he showed up at the wrong place amen luke 22 31 hallelujah and the lord said simon simon behold satan hath desired to have you that he may sift you as wheat but i have prayed for thee that thy faith fail not and when thou art converted strengthen thy brethren hallelujah and then we go to acts 12 and um we're going to read verses 5 to 7 i'm going to jump down to oh we can just read all the way down to 11 why not so x12 here x12 and it says here peter therefore was kept in prison but prayer was made without ceasing of the church unto god for him so notice they didn't just sit back and say well he was a good brother and when herod would have brought him forth the same night peter was sleeping between two soldiers bound with two chains and the keepers before the door kept the prison and behold the angel lord came upon him and a light shot shined in the prison and he smote peter on the side and raised him up saying arise up quickly and his chains fell off from his hands and the angel said unto him gird thyself and bind on thy sandals and so he did and he saith unto him cast like garment about thee and follow me and he went out and followed him and was not that it was a that it was true which was done by the angel but he thought he saw a vision when he uh they were past the first and second ward they came unto the iron gate that leadeth unto the city which opened to them of his own accord and they went out and passed on through one street and wherewith the angel departed from him and when peter was gone out sorry and when peter was come to himself he said now i know of a shortie that the lord has sent his angel and has delivered me out of the hand of herod and from all the expectation of the people of the jews so amen let's just pray this morning if you ever need you're gonna raise your hands to the lord you know i believe we're in his presence today it doesn't matter if you've had the worst week of your life our god is still god and he all things work together for good i mean those that love him and are called according to his purpose gracious heavenly father we thank you we can come into your presence and sing a song to you oh god i feel like they're redeemed around the throne and john when the book was opened they sang a new song lord jesus crying out and praising you for what you've done father your mighty plan of redemption and we find ourselves in that plan oh god we find ourselves lord the manifestation of prophecy in this hour we want to thank you for that oh god that lord you've lord put us on the earth lord to be a living epistle read known of all men i just pray to god as we have come to the preaching of your word now i pray o god may you take me under your divine control lord and not just only me but the whole congregation here o god we want to be anointed with your holy ghost we want to be filled lord to overflowing oh god father we want to be just lord just to see you come and do the supernatural in our midst you're a supernatural god lord jesus i pray you just come and bind every hindering spirit and cast out the name of jesus christ may you have liberty lord we've come to see you today we've come to worship you and praise you lord to express on our hearts how much you mean to us oh god so we love you we're going to tell you lord you're the greatest one in all the earth lord we love you so much we thank you lord we just want to commit the service into your hands we also want to pray for brother gary walker and his family dear god i pray father lord you are the god of all comfort lord i pray you just be very present very real father strengthen and encourage the lord and comfort him in the family oh god father may you grant it dear god we just want to lift them into your presence by prayer father anyone else here may be suffering and hurting lord father i want to just ask for them oh god may you touch them and meet their needs lord because you are mindful of every situation and we thank you lord in jesus christ's name amen amen god bless you may have your seats um this morning trying to pull the wrong sleeve here there we go um yes i did actually on friday i had flowers seemed to brother gary on all of your behalf so i trust he will receive them amen um so i want to talk about here i want to continue on from um wednesday uh in a way but you know we live in an hour where well actually every believer has had a decision in life what are they going to do about it when the devil comes to their address are they just going to let them come in and say well i just it's predestinated and you know but brother brown tells us that god doesn't just force us through a pipe and make us overcome we have a part to play we have a human will that we've got to either fight the enemy or not fight the enemy you know brother brown says in many uh you know in quite a few places he he poses the question what are you going to do about it he says here now this is why i probably should just print out things because i can go from page last one to the first one but he asked the question if i can find it he says it's like you know the revival just kind of dries up a bit and then he and he says what are you going to do about it are you going to go into organization or not so we're going to just organize and have our systems all set up and everything but we're going to let god live you know sickness strikes what are you going to do about it hardship comes what are you going to do about it trouble rises up what are you going to do amen because you know we're believers today aren't we we've been trained to fight this is this is a battlefield i'm glad you know well wouldn't you like a sunday school picnic for a kind of a life well yes or no because it's only those who really step onto the battlefield it's not the armchair critic that'll get any praise or anything you know it's those who really press the battle they may fail brother brahm said i'd rather be on the field trying to save souls and make a failure but what are you doing about it you know so here we are satan has a will well together satan has a will he he he was desiring to destroy peter he wanted to destroy him not only there where jesus says that satan has desired to have you to sift you as wheat but i have prayed for you that your faith will not fail so jesus was interceding for one of his apostles because he knew the job that peter had to do he had the keys to the kingdom he had to put it in the lock and open the door to the jews the gentiles and the samaritans all the same way acts 2 38 amen repent and be baptized everyone in the name of the lord jesus christ for the remission of sin you shall receive the gift of the holy ghost that was the keys being put in the door to open it that the people could come into the kingdom of god so he had a job to do and satan was trying to take him before he fulfilled his job hallelujah but then jesus said i have prayed for thee that when satan comes to sift you that your faith would not fail and we have the same kind of situation where where peter said well you know god has delivered him out of the hand of herod and from all the expectation of the people of the jews but really it was the devil's expectation i'm going to kill this guy i'm going to kill this believer i'm going to cut his head off in the morning this was his expectation so it was really the devil's expectation being manifested through a people but you know you know but what would have happened if the church just said well i guess he'll just be like james he was a good brother and they began to have a memorial service before he even died but they weren't those kind of believers they prayed without ceasing that god would intercede hallelujah and god begin to act you know you think about how impossible the situation is to get out you know he's chained between two guards within the inner prison and then the angel comes in and a light shone in the prison why didn't the light shine on it wake up anyone else well it wasn't for them it was for peter hallelujah but that was now it was the church's expectation that god can deliver because he's the god of deliverance against the expectation of the devil through the jews that he's gonna die and one expectation one right we're here to fight we're not here just to take it we're here to give it back and more and them some hallelujah yeah because we are a people that are kings and priests unto our god hallelujah so i want to go i'm going to read some scriptures here then we'll get into it so we read here in ephesians 2 and 1 and you hathy quickened who are dead in trespasses and sins where in times past you you walked according to the course of this world according to the prince of the power of the air the spirit that now worketh and the children of disobedience among whom also we all had our conversation in times past and the lusts of our flesh fulfilling the desires of deflation of the mind and we're by nature the children of wrath even as others but god who's rich in mercy for his great lover and he loved us even when we're dead in sins hath quickened us together with christ by grace he has saved and has raised us up together and made us sit together in heaven heavenly places in christ jesus that in the ages to come he might show the exceeding riches of his grace and his kindness towards us through christ jesus so as we're talking about on wednesday we have the bride has been elevated to a position in heavenly places in christ jesus now this position is our position in christ as adam was in this position before the fall and he could tell nature to move he had dominion over the earth but because of sin he forfeited that he he he fell from his position and now man has been under the bondage of satan and death until now or until calvary where people could actually be elevated back to that position that adam fell from and the prophet tells us that we have received now everything that adam lost eternal life hallelujah and that eternal life is not just a not just a um what do you call it a consolation when a believer passes on well we'll see them again no that eternal life is actually to have dominion over the earth because it's god's own life hallelujah so that's the position we are to be seated together in heavenly places in christ jesus and we the apostle paul tells us that god places us then you know there's a big difference between professing and possessing proof there's a big difference between just confessing a promise or professing a promise to actually possessing that promise we want to be possessors of the promise today we don't just want to talk about it sure we should talk about it right because they overcame him by the blood lamb and the word of their testimony but it's not just to profess it but it's to possess it hallelujah so here we are now there's actually a people upon the earth that don't just talk about being the bride of christ made one with christ they are right but now it's time for us to exercise our god-given authority amen here we are because you know christianity isn't just to be talked about it's to be lived it's to be manifested the apostle paul said the gospel did not come to you just in words only but empowering demonstration of the holy ghost amen and we're living in an hour where people don't just talk about it but it's a demonstration amen with the dynamics of the holy ghost of coming to the church once again hallelujah amen this is where we are but yeah we have a powerful position amen that we are inhabiting now the devil has been squatting in this position and you got to kick him out right that's like just like the just like the israelites you know there were there were enemies all over their inheritance all over their promise all over their god ordained position you know when the when the patriarchs were birthed the hebrew mothers would would speak their name and that was prophetically saying like benjamin or or ruben or naphtali or asher or gad you know that that name was associated with a certain position in the promised land so they were actually prophesying this is where these people will eventually end up hallelujah so it's the same thing when we're birthed into the kingdom there's a word there's a name a bride this is jesus christ holy and that's prophesying now where you will end up but i tell you do you want to get there you know i say if if if we have been predestinated by foreknowledge god could look see god didn't say well i'll save one and not lose one but because he could look through time by foreign say that one will be saved that one won't because he can see the end from the beginning now if god saw me that i'd be predestined to be an overcomer i'm going to live that if he saw me by foreknowledge that i'm going to be a serpent bruiser in this hour i said lord be beat unto me according to thy word i'm going to be a serpent bruiser see it depends really what you believe you are amen you know just like brother brown would tell the story of the son of the king of the african tribe he was now a slave in america but he conducted himself differently i mean to the rest of the slaves because he's the son of a king though he will probably never go back and take his throne of his father back in the homeland he conducted himself as a son of a king and brother ram says we as sons and daughters of god should conduct ourselves like sons and daughters of god he maybe never saw that throne i don't know he may not remember even where it was in africa but he had a revelation i am the son of a king hallelujah and you know we were in god's mind we don't remember being there there's not pre-existence of souls like the mormons would preach but you know i trust there's something's anchored in your heart i'm a son or daughter of god i want to conduct myself as a son and daughter of god hallelujah amen so now this is the so as the israelites went and remember god told them i've given you the land but they had to go fight they had to put the armor on they had to pick up their shield their sword their helmet whatever equipment they had they had to go fight the battle hallelujah just like you know this i think brother andy showed us when he came back from the holy land that time he said there's some jews that are literally overnight they'll set up a settlement put up a guard tower you know because they're possessing their land they believe they believe it's theirs that they're actively putting works into their faith right so they're not just talking about this is our land they're possessing their land right but there's some jews they are not interested in taking their land because they say well god has to give it to us so which side is a really a believer i say it's the one who actually go out and possess it and it should be the same thing with you and i remember works as faith expressed i mean that our works our life should be a manifestation of our faith or a manifestation of our revelation amen hallelujah now here we are that and for by grace you're saved through faith that is not of yourselves as a gift of god not of works least any man should boast for you his workmanship created in christ jesus unto good works which god hath before ordained that we should walk in them so if he's ordained me to be a serpent bruiser amen what do you believe you are today hallelujah there we go we'll let it be unto you according to your faith amen remember if you believe you'll never overcome you'll never overcome if you believe you can never be free you'll never be free but if you believe no the lord has made me free i'm going to be free hallelujah you'll be free amen what did what would jesus say let it be unto you according to your faith according to your faith you'll find your daughter that way or whoever you know so it's really what are we believing for now it says here in revelations 1 and verse 6 that he has made us kings and priests unto god and his father to him be glory and dominion free and ever amen now a king and a priest has two different roles but these roles are merged into one people now a king we know has a dominion a king has absolute authority in their dominion they don't have a democracy a real king has absolute power what he says will happen what he doesn't say doesn't happen he doesn't have to ask anyone he just says this is how it's going to be this is where we're going if anyone raises up against him it is now a revolution and they're convicted of of of sedition or whatever you call it and that person is normally hung and courted this is medieval times i'm talking about who knows about these things i used to like those things because yeah as a boy and you know swords and fighting and castles and whatever you know but you know that is that is a rebellion if you rise up you know if someone rose up against the king they had to be sure they'd win and so now we have a dominion over over satan hallelujah over hell death in the grave the victory was won that day on calvary and now he has given god has given us that same dominion amen he says all power and heaven earth has been given unto me jesus said after the resurrection what did he do with it he didn't just put it in his trophy cabinet and sit back no he poured it out into his church on the day of pentecost amen giving you that same authority and power that he had because he won it he gave it to you hallelujah so we are kings over a dominion now we're not kings over a physical dominion jesus says my kingdom is not of this world right we're not here to build a republic of whatever you know physically no we're not interested in that we're interested in that god would so fill up people with his presence that they would become a powerhouse amen of the holy ghost hallelujah brother taz used that quote and i just really like it let's just see if we can if i can find it no i probably can't find it but we'll just leave that it'll come as i scroll but he said that we've become powerhouses of the holy ghost now powerhouse i mean has a lot of power in it it's another name for a power plant highly a power plant produces power i mean when the holy ghost comes into you you become a power plant i mean you got nuclear fission going on on the inside of the inside there's no nuclear waste right there's no bad byproduct it's just divine love projecting the power of god projecting peace projecting joy projecting love projecting faith projecting hallelujah hallelujah isn't that right so we become a power plant we don't need to be plugged in we have the source inside amen we've got batteries on the inside already hallelujah we've become a powerhouse and that's what brother brown said i've not come to make organization i've come to make people full of the holy ghost the powerhouse of the holy ghost i mean when the word is manifested through their lives and that's what we're here for isn't it what are we here to do today become powerhouses hallelujah you know if if you know armies they they they they put a whole lot of propaganda behind their latest weapons the north koreans will fire some rocket someplace and they'll blow their trumpet and tell the world look at this missile we have and you know they think they're pretty fancy with it but you know there's a lot of other nations got a far more powerful weapons but they will always project power saying how great we are and if those weapons can do what they say they can do they'll have confidence in that weapon don't mess with me i'll push a button and we'll see you later now we have the mo but if they're afraid if but if they doubt that weapon then they'll doubt their ability to actually stand their ground that's the same thing with the united brotherhood even says that if you think your weapon is equivalent to the devil's weapon the devil's got you right that he thinks you know so the devil tries to get you think you have a he has a weapon but he's defeated i come to remind you the devil's defeated he has no arrows to his bow he's nothing but a bluff amen but if he gets you to think that his doubt is equivalent to your faith he's got you but he is a defeated being i mean this weapon we pack is the best weapon you can ever find in the history of the world hallelujah but you so you've got to recognize what you have the armor we have is the best armor hallelujah i mean so we've got to have confidence hey this thing works amen and i trust you know it works amen so we have you think that same the same faith that came into the upper room on the day of pentecost what did it do it opened the prison doors gave sight to the blind raise the dead healed the sick cast out the devil holy ghost fell upon people that heard the word amen hallelujah devils were cast out salvation came to people that was the faith that that was the weapon they were equipped with and they went out of the upper room shouting and rejoicing and praising god because one they knew it worked but two they knew they had eternal life hallelujah so that so they weren't not gonna die on the battlefield hallelujah they were gonna go all the way and that same faith we've been restored to the weapon you have casts out devils heals the sick raises the dead amen brings divine healing brings salvation brings peace amen brings joy hallelujah cast the devil out that's that's that's the weapon you have i'm looking at a bunch of soldiers today hallelujah amen that's the weapon we have now so we are kings and priests unto god and his father to be him be glory and dominion forever and ever amen just reading the uh verse six so he he's given us dominion over the devil amen you say there's nothing new about this well peter said i just you know i want to tell you again the things you've heard too to make it a bit more real just as we uh heard a couple of sundays ago when the enemy comes in like a flood i'll raise up a standard said the lord and brother ram says he makes the promise more real that's him raising a standard amen so now so now a priesthood or a priest right what do they do brother bam says in the seven church ages he made us priests did you ever know what a priest is what his officers a priest is to make sacrifice to make intercession over in hebrews it said that we the church is the royal priesthood that's peter a royal priesthood a holy nation of peculiar people see hey now that word peculiar it doesn't mean you're odd that means you're a special treasure to god so doesn't mean no you're an oddball sure we're eyeballs to the world but it doesn't make doesn't mean you're weird a weird people that means you're a special treasure to god that word peculiar amen so don't get all complex and funny thinking well i'm just weird no we're the normal people if you've got the mind of christ you're normal you are actually the baseline of normal on the graph do you know everything else is left and right and up and down and whatever how many three-dimensional graph you want it's all over the show but the but the bride that has the mind of christ remember the mind of christ made the world and nature and everything worked right it wasn't a broken system under adam and eve under adam and eve and you know and and then before they fell the world worked right eternal life was there nature was in balance everything was fine and they had the right kind of mind but when sin came in man lost that mind and look at where we've ended up this world is falling apart but yeah we have the best technology the best way to share data see how things work we we're the best systems you think technology wise to make the world run but it barely runs at that you know we produce more food every year than the world needs to eat but yet there's world hunger why is that well it's actually you know it's because of what but yet there's starvation there's millions in starvation why because the world's fallen apart we're the best medical technology that there's ever been praise the lord for it but yet people on waiting lists things happening you know the hospitals are barely running nurses and everyone are burning out why because the world's falling apart you know we have you know in this first world we shouldn't they shouldn't be a hungry person they shouldn't be a sad person they shouldn't be a cold person you know there shouldn't be anything but yet mental illness has skyrocketed families are broken this why because the world has fallen apart malnourished poverty all these things there shouldn't be that in this country but yet it's here why because the world is falling apart or has fallen apart why because the mind of man is darkened that's why i say if you've got the mind of christ you're actually the baseline of normal we're the only saying you know the believers the only sane bunch in the world they people may not think that but yes we are i mean you know as i've said before people think we're brainwashed well yeah my brain needed washing that was a filthy thing i'm glad the blood of jesus christ takes out every stain every mark hallelujah so i'm glad my brain got washed by the holy ghost amen so we are we are so the so the bride or the believer is the bride is kings and priests so now see it's a holy nation of peculiar people a royal priesthood offering here it is now offering spiritual sacrifices every man and woman that comes to god enters into that veil into the holy of holies so we are here to make spiritual sacrifices to our god and to make intercession that's our role so we don't only have a dominion but we can now intercede and make spiritual sacrifices hallelujah you say well there's nothing new about this um you know i was just thinking about wednesday you know when we said about how it's now the time let's just read ephesians 3 and 8. unto me whom less and all the saints as this grace given i should preach among the gentiles the unsearchable riches of christ and to make all men see what is the fellowship of the mystery which from the beginning of the world hath been hidden god who created all things by jesus christ to the intent that now unto the principalities and powers in heavenly places might be known by the church the manifold wisdom of god according to the eternal purpose which he hath purposed in christ jesus our lord in whom we have boldness and access with confidence by faith by the faith of him say well there's nothing new about the the powers the prince powers and powers and heavenly places being known be made known unto the church and that's true but has it been made known unto you that's why we preach these things because it hasn't become a revelation to you you know do you realize the power who we who you are in christ you know you know my wife read this biography of this man called hurricane kelly who hurricane kelly was that his name what earthquake kelly earthquake kelly anyway ones in the air ones on the ground but you know there's a lot of mess can happen earthquake kelly he was raised in witchcraft or something but he then he became a christian and then he saw i think maybe before his conversion afterwards there was some boys that just gave their heart to the lord and because they were under the blood the devil couldn't get them but then they started they baxled and went back into the world and he thought how foolish they were they were actually protected under the blood even just just giving their hearts to the lord not even receiving the holy ghost he thought how foolish these boys were they were under a protection but then they walked out from under that protection and that's just the way the devil is he does not want you to realize who you are right now see if boys who are just justified by faith under the blood could be protected in such a way how much were people who are not just justified but sanctified and not just sanctified but filled with the holy ghost i mean so to realize the position that we are in right now hallelujah and the protection we have right now if you realize who was with you every day you would be fearless you wouldn't worry about nothing how you just commit all your cares upon the lord because he's with you every day he cares for you in your situation he's not you know he's in control of all things remember the jews wanted to kill peter but god said he ain't dying here he was it had already been prophesied jesus told him to death he would die and that death was not being beheaded in a prison so he couldn't die in that place you know we're ordained to go on a rapture you know we've been prophesied to go on a rapture you know the rapture is a revelation it's got to become real to you amen that your body's going to be changed hallelujah it's not just some doctrine that's airy fairy it's got to become a reality i'm going to walk with god and will be not because god's going to take me holy i pray that just break forth upon every soul you think about how great that is i can't die you can kill this thing you know in under how many years should should the lord tarry this thing will die anyway i won't be dead i'll be on streets of gold i'll be living in the presence of the one i love and i'll see him face to face hallelujah so what could you do imagine lazarus after he got resurrected they wanted to kill him and jesus he would have thought really i just had fellowship with oh yeah good take my life i'll go i just i'll just pick up that fellowship with abraham i was having hallelujah or moses all you know hallelujah so i pray that we would really realize the rapture is you and i amen just like people say the message i am the message it was a prophecy of a bride coming forth hallelujah we're living epistles right peter said paul said we're living epistles better known of all men so actually the living manifestation of the word of god you know the bible prophesies of a people in the end time rising up into her position i will restore thus saith the lord amen hallelujah you know it's easy to look at the scripture and you know speak of you know see the prophecies of of jesus coming right you know isaiah 9 6 different ones all the way down through from genesis all the way down through but within those prophecies were a people there was a peter james and john there was a woman at the well you know even even jesus the other prophecy where it said that he'd be a light to the gentiles you know paul said i'm a light to the gentiles yes he said oh he's just he's just trying to grab a scripture that pertains to the messiah and potato to himself to make himself something no it wasn't he was part of that prophecy hallelujah so so even even within these prophecies of the messiah coming there had to be a bride coming as well that's been prophesied in the scripture so really do you know that you are just a fulfillment of prophecy is this okay you think about it really jesus what was what was john's ministry the fulfillment of prophecy what was jesus ministry the fulfillment of prophecy what was the upper room a fulfillment of prophecy that's why peter said this is that spoken by the prophet joel i'll pour my spirit out upon all flesh he said this is the fulfillment of what you've been reading this is manifesting right here isn't that right hallelujah and then the gentiles coming in was a fulfillment of prophecy the blinding of the jews a fulfillment of prophecy amen this world has fallen apart it's a fulfillment of prophecy we're in satan's eden a fulfillment of prophecy second thessalonians amen but within all that there's a bride i shall restore thus saith the lord amen that we would be brought back to appear back to the book of acts pentecost the faith of the fathers holy the bride would return in the end time so what are we a fulfillment of prophecy what is this church built on a fulfillment of prophecy what was the prophet's ministry a fulfillment of prophecy it's not anything hooky spooks it's just fulfillment of prophecy amen but we have we got to realize that i pray that that becomes a revelation to you even you take you say well my life is pretty mundane joseph's life in the prison was pretty mundane in egypt he didn't do a lot of different things you know he you know he eventually came to a schedule of running the prison oh you know he's in different places in part of his house in the prison his life became pretty mundane but his life was a fulfillment of prophecy every day his life was a fulfillment of prophecy god was moulding and shaping him in the everyday do you see god's hand in your life in the every day you know i trust we don't say i just can't wait for the weekend yeah that's how it used to be in the world but well it was really i can't wait for wednesday but you know because the weekend started on a wednesday but you know people always looking for the future god's going to do something for me in the future no god's doing something for you right now and i'm not just talking about this service i'm talking about when you wake up in the morning he's working and when you have lunch he's working when you're at school he's working when you're at work he's working when your home is working he's working on you hallelujah amen now brother bram says and sirs we would see jesus so if the church only knew its position and the greatest hindrance in the church is fair they're afraid that it just won't work well it just won't work for you that way it will not work that way it must be absolutely believers amen not make believers but believers from your heart see so if the church only knew its position but the greatest hindrances has is fear so the devil tries to make us afraid it won't work for you but you know i always just come i'll be thinking about this no promise of god has ever worked for the devil this is his testimony because he doesn't believe it he fights against it so no promise salvation didn't work for him healing doesn't work for him deliverance doesn't work for him right adoption into the body doesn't work for him peace he can't get it joy and god no he can't it doesn't work for him right faith no he can't get it so his testimony is you think it'll work for you but he just tries to project his experience onto you that's what he does you think that oh you really think you're the bride well he's not the bride he can't be the bride but he tries to put it up you think you're going to overcome well he can't overcome he's already been overcome by his own delusion he can't be set free by it so he tries to make you think you'll never overcome you think he can be healed or whatever you know he tries to put his own experience hey you're following me he tries to put his own experience upon you why because no promise of god has ever been for him well actually the only promise of god for him is that he's going to burn in a lake of fire right that's his promise god poor god fulfilled your promise for him real soon would be nice but for us we're in a different category amen our lord died for us we have salvation salvation's for you and i who's just said one day salvation's for me hallelujah deliverance is for me the joy the lord is for me amen his strength is for me his peace is for me his overcoming powers for me and i'm not talking about tomorrow i'm talking about right now that thing that fights you all the time see what you've got to recognize we were watching uh was it the three or you know one of the jeff elkins films last night and there was the one bit where the guy comes along and he keeps walking basically around and he comes back into the desert there's a uh what a windmill he looks up he sees that same devily fort comes along he kills him comes back around the seas the windmill again and that same devil's there he's like but i thought i defeated you and then the lord tells them you've got to recognize what prophet says you've got to recognize that thing died at calvary just walk on stop stop fighting the thing now this is a revelation that it's done right that you've been like and and that devil is telling you you'll never be free this is generational spirits i'm talking about now generational problems your parents had it you had it yeah you've got it this one had it you'll never be free because i'm a part of you right but then he wrote but then the lord told him no that thing has been defeated at calvary that generational problem maybe the things your parents did that you're stuck with that you can't no the lord defeated that at calvary amen so just walk on hallelujah amen oh i need something fancier than that no no you've got to recognize your enemies being defeated amen amen he says in christ the mystery god revealed he says the new birth is christ is a revelation god has revealed to you this great mystery and that's a new birth uh now what are you gonna do when you get all that group together what is that group that jesus christ has become a revelation to them right this is what he's talking about where the revelation is perfectly in harmony and god expressing it through his word by the same actions the thing same things that he did making the word manifest so we've already been through a few actions and things he did he cast out devils he raised the dead he interceded for peter he also prayed for us if you read john i don't just pray for these but the other ones that will believe through their word amen so he interceded he cast out devils he had a dominion so what do you do when you get that same group together that has the revelation perfectly in harmony and god expressing it through his word by the same actions the same things that he did making the word manifested oh if the church only knew its position it will one day then the rapture will go when it knows what it is i trust that that's more than just a nice thing you put on instagram or put on your fridge but we would realize what we are that we are the word made flesh today amen now when the lamb takes the book in in revelations 5 now when we read in revelations 1 that where we make kings and priests to our god now in revelations 5 when the lamb takes the book the same the same phrase is used again the people that said they sung a new song thou art worthy to take the book to open the seals thereof for thou were slain and has redeemed us to god by their blood out of every kindred tongue and people and nation and has made us unto our god kings and priests and we shall reign on the earth so now this is just me and my little as brother johnny demoff would say this is just in fellowship that when the lamb takes the book the full realization that we are kings and priests to our god comes into manifestation and i beheld i heard the voice of many angels round about the throne and the beast and the elders and the numbers of them were ten thousand times ten thousand and thousands of thousands saying with a loud voice worthy is the lamb that was slain to receive power and riches and wisdom and strength and honor and glory and blessing hallelujah so there has become a realization into our lives we are kings and priests to our god we have dominion over the devil this is not i'll see if this works we know it works that we have power to cast the devil out that's a principle work of the church is to cast out the devil wherever you find them don't live with them kick them out hallelujah amen so by god god says by for knowledge now i'll just read this abraham and a seat after him so you see now why the church itself is pre-elected by god now let me take the word out of first thessalonians the first chapter said predestinated now that's not a good word to use before people because predestinated will be better if we use it like this that it was by four knowledge god by his foreknowledge could predestinate to his own glory see he didn't say i'm going to choose i'm going to choose you and i'm going to send you to hell i'm going to choose you and send you to hell that isn't god's idea he wanted all of us to come to heaven but being god he foreknew who would come and who would not come now that clears out um romans uh nine and eight and nine there where he said that the election of god might be sure that before either boy was born talking of esau and jacob god said i love jacob and i hate east or c has for knowledge let him know that esau was nothing but little shyster anyhow that jacob had recompense to that birthright see his foreknowledge lets him know if he didn't know the end from the beginning that he wasn't god see and the bible says that we the church what we are predestinated so we're previously by full knowledge that god could look through time and see you and i believe if he could say to him that and them that overcometh they'll sit down on my throne as my as i sat down on my father's side and overcome i believe he he's seeing me as an overcomer right so if he see me as an overcomer i say lord may i manifest that do you believe he saw you through time before there's any molecule star anything and he saw you in this hour 2021 overcoming amen having dominion over the devil be victorious by the blood of jesus christ not defeated not a not a survivor but an overcomer amen we aren't victims here we're overcomers holy we're victorious hallelujah amen so jesus prayed that peter his faith would not fail he interceded for him now it's the same way as i said with the church they interceded prayer was made without ceasing of the church unto god for peter and so we have the same office to intercede on people's behalf you say this is nothing new but i just want to emphasize it our prayers work the effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man availeth much not a veil of little avail of march amen so our our prayers can actually stop satan's will happening we know satan has a will in isaiah 14 and 12 how thou art fallen from heaven o lucifer son of the morning how thou art cut down to the ground which dideth weak in the nations for thou has said in thy heart i will ascend into heaven i will exalt my throne above the stars of god i will sit also upon the mount of the congregation the sides of the north i will ascend above the heights of the clouds i will be like the most high that sounds like a man with an agenda he's got a will but we have the power i say the authority this morning to stop his will coming to pass in your life amen see it's just like david there with goliath it was revealed to david he could take out goliath goliath's will was we're going to win right but a man stepped into the gap he said no no you're not going to win this is the end hello bride brother i'm saying the statue of the perfect man that's what i was trying to look for before we're not building an organization i'm not here this morning to build an organization christ never sent me to build organization christ sent me to build individuals to the statue of jesus christ that they might be the powerhouse and the dwelling place of the spirit by his word by his words he building individual to that place not build an organization to a greater denomination but build the individual to sons and daughters of god that's your idea add your faith virtue to your virtue knowledge well we're coming now you're coming to a place so that's that's why we have church amen and when the holy ghost is enticing spirits when the holy ghost gospel is nothing more than one great powerhouse of joy hallelujah what do you believe i believe this holy ghost gospel is nothing more than one great big powerhouse of joy the holy ghost gospel is the perfect intoxication for every man that's got the blues you feeling down take a drink hallelujah you're feeling in the blues and just feeling like you can't get the victory take a drink you take a drink of the gospel of jesus christ be filled with the holy ghost you're a drunk until you leave this world aiming joy unspeakable full of glory there's a constant stimulation it's a constant indoxification drunk day and night amen amen that's the word of god hallelujah amen hallelujah amen as i said a powerhouse we are made to be powerhouses of the holy ghost right now right now now they say i'm a powerhouse of the holy ghost by his grace amen that's what we that's what we're built to be brother man says in the deity of jesus christ he says the son of god that was in the cradle is in the heart now he's a deity of god he's the god the creator he was in the world and the world was made by him and the world knew him not and today that's what's the matter with the church the hope of glory the baptism of the holy ghost has come into the people's hearts and they don't recognize what it is they think it's a little church joining or something like that but that is the god the creator living in you and giving you all the power and you're in possession of everything that he had and so it um so is it in you to abstain from evil to do good to shun evil and flee to righteousness to turn away from temptation all malice hatred strife envy and so forth come right away from it for it'll take him from your heart if you will receive him embrace him and love him and hold him in your heart and love him that's a good way to be isn't it if you received him just embrace him and love him say lord i'm not letting you go i know it's you holding on to me but i want to hold on to you real good hallelujah just like when i pick up william he holds on to me i'm the one carrying him but he holds on to me that's how we should be with the lord don't you think so i mean i tell you the church together with that kind of a power has the power to bind the heavens heal the sick open the eyes of the blind hallelujah the death uh uh the dumb speak the deaf hair the cripples walk the blind see why it's recognizing the power of or not it's recognizing the power of almighty god into your heart there he is the deity he says you love him amen so he says here that many people don't realize what they have they have the holy ghost they don't realize what they have because if we really realize who's in us oh i'd say lord just just come live take dominion do what you want to do hallelujah amen but some some will say well i can never be part of that brotherhood season kinsmen redeemer oh the love of the father that he has shed upon us when we were sinners aliens from god might be drawn nigh to god and so much that we become sons and daughters of god not servants the gentile church was never a servant no so the gentile church is a son and daughter you are sons and daughters of god who has received the holy ghost amen what if you're an offer and turned away but if you've went but if you went on through to the holy spirit you become sons and daughters now sons and daughters who has the most power before god an angel an angel's a servant is that right they're his servants but what are you you're his sons and daughters who has the most power in heaven then a sinner that's been saved by grace or an archangel standing by his side who's never fallen who's got more power amen the sinner that's been saved by grace is more authority in heaven than the archangel that stood by aside without sin because he's a son a son has more authority than the servant of course oh we forget what we are we forget many times what made us what we are and we after we become what we are then we forget how we got there how did we get here god called us god saved us god redeemed us god washed us from our sin god filled us with his presence hallelujah so a sinner saved by grace has more authority in heaven than an archangel so gabriel's got to keep his silence when you're talking hallelujah or michael or wormwood or you know they have to actually keep their hold their peace guys my daughter's talking to me my son's talking to me harlow because his ear is always open to your prayer why because the blood puts us back on speaking terms it puts us in that condition that's why i put it by the front door i like to read that when i walk in lord i've been put into you've made me in this condition the blood has put me back on speaking terms with you hallelujah so now the words that come out of my mouth they're not in vain irrespective of how i feel remember faith is not a feeling holy god still hears our prayers amen he says i don't care what you've done how black your sins are how smart your life is god is standing tonight knocking at your heart's door to forgive you no matter who you are he says i don't care what you've done if you're a son you have a right to return now because it's a jubilee time hallelujah so we are a royal priesthood amen we're a royal priesthood so now we have an ability to come before god and intercede amen he says if you're but you're a chosen generation a royal priesthood a holy nation of peculiar people that ye might show forth the praises of him who hath called you out of darkness into his marvelous light amy which in times past were not a people but now but are now the people of god which had not obtained mercy but now have obtained mercy hallelujah so now we have you think about it now i keep getting this thought you just think this is this is very elementary but do you know what you have your life matters your life makes an impact i mean your life can change the eternal destination of somebody it can change the course of history moses life changed the course of history hallelujah john the baptist's life changed the course of history the the woman of the wells life changed the course of history her life mattered maybe she thought you know when she was going to the well you know i said well what's my life what's the point of even being i've ruined my life but god saw her i need to go by the way of samaria he had a predestinated seed that he had to pick up and and redeem because her life was going to make an impact hallelujah you know maybe peter james and john just fishing thinking well i've just got to be a fisherman this is just you know no one knows me the emperor whatever stuff going on in life but their lives were going to shake the world harley i think it was dwight moody there was a old wash woman had a burden i want to have a meeting and and she would wash clothes and make money she hired some old preacher you know advertise this meeting i think only dwight moody turned up this little boy with hair down his back gave his heart to the lord hallelujah and god used him as a powerhouse aiming to send about 500 000 souls at least into the kingdom of god his life mattered amen is the same thing where you say i'm not a big name person but you're the bride of christ hallelujah it's always it's normally the inward parts of the body that matter hallelujah right you know you're spleen are you conscious of your spleen but you need it your intestines you conscious of your intestines every day no you need it it's not on your mind but when it when there's a pain in the body you realize you really need that intestine it's the inward parts it's the hidden part so i've said before you break a bone in your little toe you know all about it but when it's normal you don't think about it but it's those inner inward parts that really matter so it's not about being the outward bits it's the inward bits hallelujah we're all important our lives have significance we're not here just to float along we're here to actually change lives maybe make an impact in history hallelujah i mean that if the if hebrews chapter 11 would continue to be written our names would be in that book hallelujah that's how important we are amen that that that washer woman that's all that's recorded of her life in history but her life is identified with all those souls that dwight moody saved amen he said well i'm not really doing much you could just do one thing it changed the whole course of someone's life oh but we're in a gleaning time don't ever just don't listen we might be but don't ever just like dilute it down and say well maybe there's just one or two there could be a whole bunch you know uganda exploded a few years ago there's about 50 000 people just came in into the message in about three years and they're all from all different denominations it's gone now into the seventh adventist they're coming out it's just exploded you know the message has been there since the 70s oh but that's africa uh we're still on the same planet earth we're all people so why can't god do that here are you just too far out there no who says i am why should we limit god to say well there's maybe one or two what if there's 50 000 people coming amen and i i don't care i don't care who god uses to do it just say if it would happen i'm not i don't care as long as someone does it you know if you want god to bless you you're going to be happy and god blesses someone else you want god to use you to be happy for god to use someone else amen you can't be jealous of anything god does because god won't use you amen but we have boldness to come into the holiest of all by the blood of jesus christ we've got boldness to come in i mean just like esther as we're saying on wednesday she actually the one person that the king would have wanted next to his side was her but she was afraid to go in but the king hasn't called me for 30 days and you know some people just sit back and say well if i'm predestined i'm predestined if i'm not well i'm not that's unbelief talking you know you can't just sit back and say well if god will he will if not not no no the violent take the kingdom by force god is rewarder of them that diligently seek him he's a reward he actually rewards so that seekers will lord what would you have for my life lord what about this situation this person said this this he rewards those kind of people he doesn't reward those people say well if it's predestinated it'll happen and you know the big problem through church history if people have cabbage down on predestination too much that's why that's why john wesley came in with armenianism because the church world had cabbage down on calvinism too much what's the point of sending missionaries well if they're there they're there not not they'll come in somewhere that's unbelief talking and he brought the church back more towards the middle but now we know under the message we have a perfect balance between calvinism and armenianism right but so but god has always had to swing the church say come on what are you going to do about it amen you've got a weapon you've got armor get on the battlefield hallelujah you pray pray big you know i can't remember who said it but if god's on your side you should have big plans you used to have real big plans you've got a real big god hallelujah amen but the devil will say well you don't no those things won't happen why because god doesn't you know it won't happen for him amen nothing wrong with having big plans with god amen amen remember the footsteps of the righteous are ordered of the lord but you've got to walk for god to drive you amen he says there's a man here that can turn on the light there's a man present don't get scared no matter what they say i've seen it come to the spot to where i don't know where to move next but he's always present the never failing presence he's always there he can turn on the light yes sir he's just waiting to see what you're going to do he can flip the switch on any time he wants to yes sir she's waiting to see what are you going to do about it are you going to turn to him or are you just going to go up on some kind of tantrum somewhere this person this person this is wrong whatever no are you going to turn to him he's saying what are you going to do amen and he says here in awakening jesus that's why you're sick tonight maybe that's why the lull of the revival is to see what you're going to do about it but to see what you're going to do about what you've seen done are you going to pick it up make another organization out of it so that's the same question with you and i what are we gonna do about what we've seen done we've seen the son of man revealed in this day and the prophet tells us the son of man is not just in a one-man ministry but he's still being revealed in a bride body around the world jesus christ is alive i mean we could run down the street and say come see a man that's totally all i've ever done is this not the messiah this is not religion there's a true and living god the bible we're in bible days again what are we going to do about it hallelujah amen brother ram says that we emphasize the mechanics so much we forget the dynamics right we can have all the mechanics we want that's what what what is an organization that's just all mechanics we have this treaties and this is how things are this is what the pastor does and it's all kind of bottled down like this but there's no dynamics in that thing hallelujah hey we have the mechanics we want more dynamics or maybe i just want more dynamics i want to see god just take over take over my life not just in church but i wake up in the morning i'm no longer my own i'm his no longer my thoughts it's his thoughts not my words his words not my ambition his ambition that's how i want to be every day and we're coming to church god just takes off your web at times of singing i've just been in the back marbling this is god singing it's like god just takes over the worship hallelujah well yo yo we've had those thoughts i said it to brother isaac i think it's like god just took over took over the singing hallelujah hey we're singing the same songs it's different when god takes over or when we're actually trying to drive the thing amen and so it should be the same thing god just take over pour in the dynamics what is what is what has god really done in this time this is just me he's taking all the limitations off god of himself the seals came off the book he's revealing christ to you and i he's taking all the man-made limitations off of god hallelujah well that's what i think anyway i think god's unlimited in his power and limiting his ability he's the almighty just like brother umph said yo let god be god don't let it don't let god be a object your of your imagination what you think he can do let him be him amen he created every molecule every piece of matter in existence he made it he spoke it forth you don't think he can bring order yo bring chaos into order he can bring an or life that's in chaos and bring it into order what were our lives chaos he's spoken to that chaos brought an order amen we're away from god alienated from him he brought us into order why did he bring us into order that that order would push forth and impact someone else it's like a chain reaction who seen a chain reaction which had a nuclear bomb yeah that's a little thing but just it's just a few it's just a few atoms striking other atoms just a big big you know that's what our life should be like hallelujah just a big chain reaction amen out holy yeah the holy ghost influenced me to this person this person that person that person to this person yeah just be a chain reaction going through from me down to my family my family back up to me hallelujah shouldn't it be that way you know the girls at night gabe says are we gonna have family prayer now praise the lord what's that a chain reaction is coming back let's pray let's read let's sing hallelujah amen that's good so we need to so he's a rewarder of them that diligently seek him hey we're more than a nuclear bomb amen remember the one that made the sun is a new and i don't know how many they've tried to quantitate the amount of energy or you know all the nuclear fission that happens in the sun that's a nuclear reactor that's not fuel nuclear fusion sorry that happens in the sun we're more powerful than that that ball of burning gas up there takes about eight odd minutes for the sunlight to get from the sun to here we're more powerful than that because the one that made that is in us hallelujah but we need to seek the lord for every situation right lord what is your will david went to battle with the sling against the lion and the bear and goliath there's no record he picks up the sing again there's some battles where i mean pretty much every battle he would fight he would seek the lord first and sometimes the lord would say go up and fight them they've been given into your hand but there's in chronicles 14 it says therefore god enquired again of the lord and god said unto him go not up after them turn away from them and come upon them over against the mulberry trees and it shall be when they hear a sound of a going in the tops the mulberry trees that then thou shall go out to battle for for god has gone before thee to smite the host of the philistines so he had to wait on god should i charge should i retreat shall i move here what should i do he was sensitive to the leading of the lord we should be the same way you know there's different plans for different battles you couldn't take things you know for example you couldn't take the battle plan that the soviets had to invade nazi germany and apply it to the normandy landings or apply it to the pacific it wouldn't work the terrain's different the battle's different right and we have different battles we've got to face we say lord what is your will in this battle you know it's just like god has many different ways of healing and you can apply this to the four anointings of the cherubim for example the lion anointing yet prayed for and you get well over time they shall lay hands upon the sick and they shall recover brotherhood says that that is that is divine healing but another one can be an instant healing which is a miracle he said people misunderstood the difference between a miracle and divine healing divine healing is actually it basically your body flushes it out but a miracle is a miracle that's gone instant like the eagle you could say or it could be you have to go by man's ways through medicine or how's your diet are you getting enough sleep are you really you know you're all stood up in your mind have you thought of relaxing or reading a book or something that you know to try and just you know hello yeah that's like man's way doing things or it can be a sickness under death like the ox anointing because remember elisha he got sick and that sickness took him to death but the main thing is you're gonna seek the lord and so the lord will show you which one it is and the whole purpose of it is that your faith will not fail right because you can receive a sickness that will take your life but it won't take your faith amen and really you step from this body to a new body that's a divine healing hallelujah why because you you you're healed you've been liberated from that sickness it's no longer oppressing you anymore amen but now in order for our faith i called this and i tell you now at 11 35 that i want to talk about being putting faith into action and that wasn't a preliminary that was basically the whole sermon you know but it says in galatians 5 for we through the spirit wait for the hope of righteousness by faith for in jesus christ neither circumcision availeth anything nor uncircumcision but faith worketh by love so the way faith works is by love that's why the devil wants us to be grumpy at each other that faith doesn't work it becomes the wrath of man praising god instead of out of divine love faith can't work if it's not by love so it's absolutely such an important fundamental principle in the christian walk do not lose your love for anybody amen if you've lost your love the devil's got you because your faith ain't going to work hey you can still dress the part speak the part be the part but what about being a possessor of the promise not just a professor a means of faith worketh by love that's divine love now brother brown says in desperations he says now the word plainly states if you want to put this down galatians 5 and 6 faith worketh by love see faith worketh by love and the only way you can have faith is to have love first because after all faith is love's incentive that's exactly what faith is it's an incentive to love now if you don't have love you can't have faith see how can you have faith in your wife if you don't love her that's in the philia which is just a human love now how about in the agapo to god how can it be if you don't love god if you said that you loved your wife and you never told tell her about it never set her down and make love to her expressed it to her kissed her hugged her and tell her she's the best cook in the country all the things that you know and how pretty she is and how much you love her if you didn't do that she'll never know it that's the way if you love her you express it that's the way we do to god when we love him we tell him about it we sit down and adore him and worship him and see love drives us to that hallelujah amen you mean to express yourself and how great how great your spouse is or how great the lord is what is love drives you to tell them or to put it into action hallelujah amen i got one big grin i'm pretty happy about that one hallelujah praise the lord but shouldn't it be that way it's not just you know someone said ah i you know they say like a husband never tells their wife that you know he loves her and he said well i told you when i propose if it changes i'll tell you you know what kind of what kind of life would that be you're always living she'd always been living in this uncertain limbo does he still love me after i've had the kids and all this has happened da da da da you know does he still love me and he never says it that's like god you know god's a person he wants us to express back to him what we mean to him is he your everything he is you all isn't he just wonderful he's the great one he saved me when i was on when i thought i was unsavable he redeemed me when i thought i was unredeemable when no one else cared about me jesus cares he cared a lot hallelujah he cared so much he poured his life out if he went to calvary just for me he would have done it all the same hallelujah if this yeah if the rapture was just for one god would have had the prophet go through all he did just for me hallelujah he brother brahm says and he cares do you care and i hope that each one of you get that especially you people to be prayed for that so uncomfortable this morning and maybe troubles that doctors cannot touch you know these troubles doctors cannot touch right we believe that doctors help people i believe that god heals by medicine god heals by surgery god heals by understanding god heals by love just a little love goes a long way let somebody be all upset and just show them you care for them see god heals by love god heals by prayer god heals by miracles god heals by his word god heals whatever source it is god heals by it it's god that heals free said i'm the lord god that heals all thy diseases so all of it should work together and man and different ministry should work together for that see amen hallelujah now we're just going to i'm just going to read one more scripture well if the musicians want to come actually now i'm going to read the description a couple of quotes i know there's been quite a bit of reading but this is here this is how we are you know a pastor does a bit of everything right we're not a one-trick pony so sometimes we'll dance around sometimes we'll just stand here sometimes we'll do a bit of both right so you know the important thing is you become the word as you receive the word the important thing is lord your word i receive it so you want to become you want to become the word receive it as it comes now we read here in psalm 34 i'm just going to read this in a couple of quotes i'll bless the lord at all times his praise shall continually be in my mouth you know if his praise is continuing in your mouth you've got no room for for for fussing fighting stews troubles quarrels there's no room my soul shall make her boast in the lord the humble shall hear of and be glad o magnify the lord with me let us exalt his name together i sought the lord and he heard me and delivered me from all my fears they looked upon him and were lightened and their faces were not ashamed this poor man cried and the lord heard him and saved him out of all of his troubles the angel of the lord encampeth around about them that fear him and delivereth them o taste and see that the lord is good blessed is the man that trusteth in him hallelujah now brother abraham was um he was preaching god hiding himself in simplicity and this was in my notes before we we're talking about yes we talk about things on a saturday night i'm like they're already in my notes anyway and anyway so it's not me talking about it's christine's telling me about it anyway now it says so so this is at the end of the service and um sister vanessa um um highlighted this says now just a few minutes ago it was traveling so it's about the angel lord moving in the congregation a light came from over this way way back here way over there and back again i said to brother demus shakarian come here come here see see it coming right here watch as it passes over there's a little lady there and just as i said it it's right over that little lady about that time she throwed up her hands began screaming there it was seed just passed right over went right over to that corner right back around this way i don't see it now see it's actually the truth i tell the truth see and here it is c4 receive the baptism of the holy ghost now i want if you want it it's yours it's yours if you're willing just to open up but now you have a conception of what you should do you have a kind of idea well now if i'll just stand here like this no no you can sit down don't make any difference where you're at but where you will open yourself up and then the holy spirit will strike then well sometimes it begins to anoint you and you don't just lead on through with it you get a little scared you're afraid you pull back just surrender yourself surrender yourself to the holy spirit don't be afraid of fanaticism if it is the devil acting don't you think we'll know it yes sir he won't come around don't you worry he won't bother you just surrender yourself to the holy spirit when you feel that glorious like this little minister said that um he did that night standing up where something warm came over him if he just knowed how to surrender himself right then that's all lord jesus i believe you i accept you then something is will will start taking place mean it from your heart then it takes place so important when the lord's moving just say lord i surrender to you right now amen amen let's stand this morning amen let's sing let's sing that psalm 34 magnify the lord with me i mean satan has the will but god has a will the bride has a will you're going to let the devil just
