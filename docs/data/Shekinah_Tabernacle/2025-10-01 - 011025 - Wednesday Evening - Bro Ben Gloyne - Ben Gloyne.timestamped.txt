[1:29] God bless you saints.
[1:31] I just want to welcome you back into the
[1:33] house of the Lord this evening.
[1:36] Just as we're about to start, we're just
[1:38] going to open up in a word of prayer.
[1:41] Let's pray.
[1:44] our most gracious and most eternal
[1:45] heavenly father. I just want to come
[1:47] before your presence, oh Lord, this
[1:48] evening, we just want to welcome you
[1:50] into our midst, oh God. Father God, as
[1:53] we've gathered here tonight, just to
[1:55] hear your word, Father God, and to obey
[1:57] your instructions that you left, Father
[1:59] God, before you crucified, that we
[2:01] should wash each other's feet, oh Lord,
[2:03] and also just drink communion and eat
[2:06] the bread, Father God. We just pray that
[2:08] you may be with us this evening, that
[2:10] may you may just bless us, oh Father
[2:11] God, and that you may be among us. And
[2:14] even as we go on this week, oh Father
[2:15] God, that you may just continue to dwell
[2:17] in our hearts. I just want to ask
[2:19] committing all these things into your
[2:20] hands. All those who couldn't make it
[2:22] this evening, and all those who are sick
[2:24] and unwell, that you may just heal them,
[2:27] Father God, and be with them, oh Lord. I

[14:02] I was a rich. I remember who I was.
[14:10] I was lost.
[14:12] I was blind.
[14:14] I was running out of time.
[14:18] The city
[14:20] separated.
[14:22] The reach is far too wide.
[14:26] And from the far side of the chasm,
[14:30] you hide me in the side.
[14:34] So you
[14:36] made a way
[14:38] across the great divine,
[14:42] left behind
[14:44] heaven
[14:46] to build it here inside.
[14:51] There at the cross,
[14:54] you paid the debt I owe.
[14:58] Broke my chains, free my soul.
[15:02] For the first time, I had all.

[15:29] life.

[21:50] without him? What he's done for us.
[21:52] Amen. Thank you musicians. Thanks for
[21:54] the care. Appreciate the songs. Amen.
[21:56] And I thought this very fitting uh for
[21:58] brother Ka to finish on let the weak say
[22:00] I am strong cuz I want to just take a
[22:03] little thought before we approach the
[22:04] Lord's supper tonight uh about strength
[22:07] for the journey.
[22:09] Amen. So let's um let's just open the
[22:13] well you don't need to turn to this but
[22:15] I know everyone knows the scripture
[22:16] really well. Um but this is Acts chapter
[22:19] 2 and verses 38. We um I have this here
[22:23] so I just got to rearrange myself. Amen.
[22:32] Amen. So it says here this Peter
[22:35] preaching on the the first ever church
[22:37] service on the day of Pentecost. He's
[22:40] and and then well the previous verse
[22:41] says you know the people that heard him
[22:43] were pricked in their hearts said men
[22:44] and brethren what shall we do? So what
[22:46] shall we do to be saved? Then Peter said
[22:48] unto them,"Repent and be baptized every
[22:50] one of you in the name of Jesus Christ
[22:52] for the remission of sin, and you shall
[22:54] receive the gift of the Holy Ghost, for
[22:56] the promise is unto you and to your
[22:58] children and to all that are far off,
[23:00] even as many as the Lord our God shall
[23:02] call." Amen. So, let's bow our heads in
[23:04] a word of prayer tonight as we prepare
[23:06] our hearts. Amen. Let's let's pray
[23:08] together. Almighty God, we just want to
[23:11] say thank you, Lord. You're our
[23:12] strength. You're our sufficiency. You're
[23:14] our all and all. We've come this night,
[23:16] dear God, to remember your your
[23:18] allsufficient sacrifice, Lord. You're
[23:21] the perfect lamb. And we're so thankful
[23:22] that we can be partakers, Lord, of of
[23:26] your sacrifice because you did it on our
[23:27] behalf. And by grace, by faith, we've
[23:30] come to say thank you, Lord, for all
[23:32] you've done. So, Lord, as we uh just go
[23:35] through this service tonight, we do not
[23:37] come uh to do a ritual, Lord. who have
[23:39] come with thanksgiving our hearts to
[23:42] acknowledge that Lord it's by you Lord
[23:44] Jesus not by our ability it's by what
[23:46] you have done that we can walk this walk
[23:49] Lord and take Lord this journey all the
[23:51] way into glory so I pray you'd bless us
[23:53] tonight prepare our hearts Lord as we uh
[23:55] Lord approach the Lord's supper Lord as
[23:57] we call it and I pray our hearts would
[23:59] there'd be nothing between us and you
[24:01] Lord we commit our lives into your hands
[24:02] we plead your blood I plead your blood
[24:04] over us as a people father may have your
[24:06] way this night for your glory be with
[24:08] those who can't be here as wellord Lord,
[24:09] we lift them into your presence by
[24:11] prayer as well. In Jesus Christ's name,
[24:13] we commit ourselves into your hands.
[24:15] Amen. Amen. God bless you. So, you can
[24:18] have your seats uh tonight. So I want to
[24:20] speak just just as I was I was reading
[24:23] through the church age book again and
[24:24] and and um brother Brown was bringing
[24:27] this out in the in the Ephesian age but
[24:30] uh just just just the scripture and how
[24:32] how the church of Pentecost was the
[24:35] pattern was the example how how how how
[24:38] we should be and I just want to read
[24:40] this just just here and we're going to
[24:42] go back to uh what we read but it says
[24:44] now now thus the church was at Pentecost
[24:47] is the standard it is the pattern. There
[24:50] is no other pattern. No matter what the
[24:51] scholars say, God has not changed that
[24:53] pattern. What God did at Pentecost, he
[24:56] has to keep on doing until the church
[24:58] age is close. Though scholars may tell
[25:00] you the apostolic age is over, don't you
[25:03] believe it. Such a statement is wrong on
[25:05] two counts. First of all, it is wrong to
[25:08] suppose that there aren't any more
[25:09] apostles just because the original 12
[25:11] are dead. An apostle means a sent one.
[25:13] And there are many sent ones today, but
[25:16] they are called missionaries. As long as
[25:18] men are being called and sent forth with
[25:20] the word of life, there is an apostolic
[25:21] age going on. Secondly, they refer to an
[25:24] age of manifested Holy Ghost power as
[25:27] being over since the Bible has been
[25:28] completed. This is untrue. There is not
[25:31] even one scripture that suggests that,
[25:32] but many conclusively state otherwise.
[25:35] Here is our proof that both of these
[25:37] charges are false. Acts 238:39. Then
[25:40] Peter said unto them, "Repent and be
[25:42] baptized, every one of you, in the name
[25:44] of Jesus Christ, for the remission of
[25:45] sin, and you shall receive the gift of
[25:46] the Holy Ghost. For the promise is unto
[25:48] you, and to your children, to all that
[25:49] are far off, even as many as the Lord
[25:51] our God shall call." The promise of
[25:53] power with which the apostles were
[25:55] endued at Pentecost, is to you Jews, to
[25:57] your children Jews, and to all that are
[25:59] far off Gentiles, and to as many as the
[26:00] Lord our God shall call, both Jew and
[26:02] Gentile, until he stops calling, the
[26:05] Pentecostal message and power will not
[26:08] cease.
[26:09] Now to me when the Lord you when Peter
[26:13] is saying to as many as the Lord our God
[26:14] shall call we think well where are they
[26:17] being called to okay because this
[26:20] scripture many times we just take it as
[26:21] a as a salvation scripture and it is
[26:24] it's the it's the door into heaven and
[26:28] it's God's provided way and God has not
[26:30] changed with his provided way but it's
[26:33] more than just a initial salvation then
[26:35] it's kind of you put that to one side
[26:37] and you keep walking on because Where
[26:39] were you being called to? See, you
[26:42] weren't called to a church. You weren't
[26:44] called to a religion. You weren't called
[26:47] to a tradition or an idea. No, you're
[26:51] called to a place. And that place, as I
[26:54] said, is not a church, but it's it's to
[26:56] glory. Amen. You This calls me as the
[26:58] Lord of God shall call. I was thinking,
[26:59] where's he calling from? I mean, he's
[27:02] not calling from the synagogue. He's not
[27:04] calling from an earthly world. He's
[27:06] calling from that other world, from
[27:07] heaven itself. And there's a call has
[27:09] gone out. Come.
[27:13] You want to come?
[27:14] &gt;&gt; I know. Yeah. This is I'm glad someone
[27:16] wants to come. Praise the Lord. But you
[27:19] see, there's a call. It's like, you
[27:20] know, if you're in your house and you're
[27:23] calling to your children or to someone
[27:25] for them to come where you are, they
[27:27] hear your voice and then they obey your
[27:30] voice. Sometimes it takes a bit longer,
[27:31] but eventually they do. And then, you
[27:34] know, then they get up from what they're
[27:35] doing. They stop what they're doing and
[27:37] they start walking where the voice is
[27:39] calling them. And then finally they hear
[27:42] your voice. They respond. They begin to
[27:44] walk. Then eventually they come into
[27:46] your presence where you are. Right? And
[27:49] now to me as many as the Lord I got
[27:51] shall call is he's calling us into
[27:53] glory. Praise the Lord. I know this is
[27:55] probably very elementary but it made me
[27:57] happy. So I'm going to be happy tonight.
[27:59] Amen. So as many as the Lord our God
[28:00] call. So, so his voice has been sent to
[28:03] the earth and there's something in us
[28:05] that's been pricricked saying what can I
[28:06] do? When you first heard this message, I
[28:08] trust something moved in you saying this
[28:10] is different. I realize my religion
[28:13] didn't cut it. You know that I need more
[28:15] than just a religion. I need the
[28:16] reality. I need God himself. And it and
[28:19] it was a call. It was a call to a union.
[28:22] It was a call to a rapture. It was a
[28:24] call to a body change. It was call it
[28:26] was a call to your place at the wedding
[28:28] supper table. And so now if that call
[28:31] has gone out which it has and it's and
[28:34] it's to move us from this world to the
[28:36] next world then if that call has been
[28:38] made then God has given power that we
[28:42] can fulfill that call that we can end up
[28:44] in our end destination. Amen. There's
[28:48] see that's why I read that that's why it
[28:49] blessed me. The Pentecostal messaging
[28:51] power will not cease as long as God is
[28:54] calling to you and I supernaturally. Not
[28:57] just a blanket call, but to a bridegroom
[29:00] call, as brother Ramon says it, to a to
[29:02] a wedding, to a union. There's a call.
[29:04] And so, if there's a call, then God will
[29:07] supply and has supplied the ability and
[29:10] the energy and the strength and the
[29:12] determination and the perseverance to
[29:16] follow that call all the way to the end.
[29:19] Amen. And that end is not halfway
[29:22] between here and there. That end is not
[29:24] disappointment. Though sometimes we end
[29:26] up in disappointing circumstances, we
[29:28] end up because remember this walk is a
[29:30] rugged walk. It's not an easy walk. It's
[29:33] not a picnic. It's not a just a gentle
[29:35] stroll on a nice summer's day and
[29:37] everything's fine and dandy. It can be a
[29:39] very rugged time. Sometimes we have
[29:40] those nice times, but but the strength
[29:43] of this call is really shown when when
[29:46] you go through difficult circumstances.
[29:48] Amen. Because that's when because faith
[29:50] cometh by hearing and hearing by the
[29:51] word of God. So this call actually puts
[29:54] faith in you.
[29:56] Who heard the word then you begin to
[29:57] believe. What happened? Faith was
[29:59] deposited. And now that faith comes to
[30:02] maturity and is tested to prove that
[30:05] it's faith. Amen. So it's not always the
[30:07] easy times. It's in the difficult times
[30:09] when the when the power of the call, if
[30:11] I can put it that way, is really proven
[30:13] because God knows it works. It worked in
[30:16] Enoch's day before Calvary. It worked in
[30:20] Elijah's day. That was before Calvary as
[30:23] well. It sure works after Calvary. Amen.
[30:26] Because of the blood of Jesus Christ.
[30:28] Amen. It's like Jesus would say, "Let
[30:30] not your hearts be troubled. Ye believe
[30:32] in God. Believe also on me in my
[30:34] father's house are many mansions. If it
[30:36] were not so, I would have told you. I go
[30:38] to prepare a place for you. And if I go
[30:40] and prepare a place for you, I'll come
[30:41] again and receive you unto myself, that
[30:44] where I am, there ye may be also. So
[30:46] he's saying, where I am, not where you
[30:47] are. See? See, the call comes to us just
[30:50] like someone in a house you're calling
[30:51] to or someone across the office or
[30:54] somewhere. They hear your voice, they
[30:55] respond to it, and they come to where
[30:57] you are. Praise the Lord. Now, I I I'm
[31:02] sure that we we're very much aware that
[31:05] the reason we're believers is because of
[31:07] his grace, his strength, his ability.
[31:12] Amen. When you want to quit, there's
[31:13] something in you says you can't quit.
[31:16] Amen. There's something in you that says
[31:18] when you want to just throw up your
[31:19] hands and say, "What's the point?"
[31:20] Discouragement comes, you know,
[31:22] difficult times come, maybe questions,
[31:25] maybe gets foggy, you know, you can't
[31:27] really see the way. there's something in
[31:28] you says keep walking
[31:31] &gt;&gt; and and why because the because you know
[31:33] brother Ram says there's three pulls.
[31:35] Okay. And the third pull is actually the
[31:37] bride being pulled to Christ and it's a
[31:40] it's a it's a force that's drawn you. We
[31:44] live in a supernatural time.
[31:46] &gt;&gt; We live in a very supernatural time. But
[31:48] that third pull has actually called you
[31:50] to himself. I mean, you're not called to
[31:53] to just because the miracles are done,
[31:55] though they are, or the thoughts of the
[31:57] heart are revealed, though they are. But
[31:59] no, it's the word Christ becoming open
[32:01] as that voice has come to you and
[32:04] something in you says, "I'm going to
[32:05] follow that voice." And you can't work
[32:08] it out necessarily. You can't put it all
[32:10] together. When I first heard, Brother
[32:12] Brham, I had no idea there was a
[32:13] message. I had no idea that he was a
[32:15] fulfillment of Malachi 4. I had no idea
[32:18] that the rapture was coming. I had no
[32:19] idea about that. But something the the
[32:22] voice behind his voice, I heard a call
[32:25] and something moved in me to say I want
[32:27] to start following that call. But I had
[32:29] to come to a point of full surrender and
[32:31] giving my life to obey the call. Cuz
[32:33] it's like when you, you know, when your
[32:34] kids call you or when you call your
[32:36] children, either one, they have to
[32:38] surrender to the call to come to where
[32:41] you are. It's the same thing. We have we
[32:44] have given our all. We've heard that
[32:47] call. Who's heard that call? You can't
[32:49] necessarily put it in words or really
[32:51] describe what it did, but you know that
[32:53] it's something's gripped you and it's
[32:57] not religion. It's not something that's
[32:59] trending. It's not it's not a nice idea
[33:02] or what everyone else is doing. It's
[33:04] certainly not popular culture. I mean,
[33:06] it's totally really against the grain,
[33:08] but it gripped you. And you can see and
[33:10] as you're walking, God is proving that
[33:12] word over and over again.
[33:16] Praise the Lord.
[33:19] Now our Lord Jesus has paved the way
[33:24] and he gives abundant grace
[33:27] to the responder of his word. Aren't you
[33:30] glad? It's grace. It's divine influence.
[33:34] Now I'm going to read this psalm. I
[33:36] won't be too long, but uh it says to the
[33:39] chief musician unto GitHal for the sons
[33:43] of Kora. How amniable are thy
[33:45] tabernacles, oh Lord of hosts. My soul
[33:48] longeth, yay, even faintth for the
[33:50] courts of the Lord. My heart and my
[33:51] flesh crith out for the living God.
[33:54] Yeah, the sparrow hath found in house,
[33:56] and the swallow a nest for herself,
[33:58] where she may lay her young, even thine
[34:01] altars, oh Lord of hosts, my king and my
[34:03] God. Blessed are they that dwell in
[34:05] thine house. They will uh they will be
[34:08] still praising thee, sealer. Blessed is
[34:11] the man whose strength is in thee. In
[34:13] whose heart are the ways of them, who
[34:16] passing through the valley of Becca,
[34:19] make it a well. The rain also fillth the
[34:21] pools. They go from strength to
[34:24] strength. Every one of them in Zion
[34:26] appearth before God. And you may not
[34:28] feel stronger, but you've been going
[34:31] from strength to strength.
[34:33] Amen. You've been taking mountains.
[34:36] You've been casting out devils. You've
[34:38] been taking land promises. You say,
[34:41] "Well, I don't feel very strong." Well,
[34:43] his strength is known in perfect
[34:45] weakness.
[34:47] Amen.
[34:48] But we've been going from the believers
[34:50] going from strength to strength. Imagine
[34:51] if we you were just a brand new
[34:53] Christian and maybe the things you're
[34:54] facing now or just overcome faced you
[34:57] back then.
[35:01] May have been too much. God knows what
[35:04] we can handle. Even even Israel uh Moses
[35:08] led them a God told them to go a certain
[35:10] way, you know, towards the promised land
[35:13] because he said if they go basically a
[35:14] direct path, the warfare will be too
[35:17] great. They need to go the the scenic
[35:19] tour because they need to go from
[35:21] strength to strength.
[35:25] Oh Lord God of hosts, hear my prayer.
[35:27] Give ear, oh God of Jacob, sealer.
[35:29] Behold, oh God our shield, and look upon
[35:31] the face of thine anointed. For a day in
[35:33] thy courts is better than a thousand. I
[35:35] had rather be a doorkeeper in the house
[35:37] of my God than to dwell in the tents of
[35:39] wickedness. For the Lord God is a son
[35:41] and shield. The Lord will give grace and
[35:43] glory. No God no good thing will he
[35:46] withhold from them that walk uprightly.
[35:48] Oh Lord of hosts, blessed is the man
[35:50] that trusteth in thee.
[35:53] Now I just want to read this. This is
[35:54] from Charles Spurgeon. I hope that's
[35:56] okay. I open my Bible app and and a
[35:58] commentary comes up and I thought this
[36:00] is really nice. He says, "Bounteous is
[36:03] Jehovah in his nature to give in his
[36:05] delight. His gifts are beyond measure
[36:07] precious and are as freely given as the
[36:10] light of the sun. He gives grace to his
[36:12] elect because he wills it. To his
[36:15] redeemed because of his covenant, to the
[36:17] called because of his promise, to
[36:19] believers because they seek it, to
[36:21] sinners because they need it. He gives
[36:23] grace abundantly, seasonably, I mean
[36:26] seasonably, constantly, readily,
[36:27] sovereignly, doubly enhance the value of
[36:30] the boon of the manner of the bestowal.
[36:33] Grace in all its forms he freely renders
[36:35] to his people.
[36:37] Amen. Praise the Lord. Comforting,
[36:39] persevering, sanctifying, directing,
[36:41] instructing, assisting. Grace, he
[36:44] generously pours into their souls
[36:46] without ceasing. And he always will do
[36:48] so. Whatsoever may occur. Sickness may
[36:51] befall, but the Lord will give grace.
[36:53] Poverty may happen to us, but grace will
[36:55] surely be afforded. Death must come, but
[36:57] grace will light a candle at the darkest
[36:59] hour. Reader, how blessed it is as years
[37:01] roll round, and the leaves begin to
[37:04] fall. To enjoy such unfading promises
[37:07] this, the Lord will give grace.
[37:10] The little conjunction and in this verse
[37:12] is a diamond rivet binding the present
[37:14] with the future. Grace and glory always
[37:16] go together. God has married them and
[37:19] none can divorce them. God will never
[37:21] deny a soul glory to whom he is freely
[37:23] given to life upon his grace. Indeed,
[37:26] glory is nothing more than grace in its
[37:28] Sabbath dress. Grace in full bloom,
[37:30] grace like autumn fruit, mellow and
[37:32] perfected. How soon um how soon we may
[37:35] have glory, none can tell. And maybe
[37:38] before this month of October has run
[37:39] out, we shall see the holy city. But at
[37:42] the interval longer or shorter, we shall
[37:43] be glorified earong. glory, the glory of
[37:46] heaven, the glory of eternity, the glory
[37:48] of Jesus, the glory of the father, the
[37:50] Lord will surely give to his chosen. Oh
[37:52] rare promise of a faithful God.
[37:56] Amen. So I put that in there because
[37:59] one, I liked it, but two, it shows he
[38:02] freely supplies every need. Amen. You
[38:06] may feel weak, he'll give you strength.
[38:08] You may feel distressed, he gives you
[38:10] comfort. Amen. You may feel like you
[38:12] don't know where to place the next step.
[38:14] He guides your steps. Amen. You may be
[38:17] sick, he'll heal you. Amen. You may be
[38:19] troubled, he'll console you. See, he
[38:22] gives you strength because remember the
[38:23] call is not just a call to salvation as
[38:27] I read Acts chapter 2, but that call is
[38:29] all the way
[38:31] to adoption, to the body change, the
[38:34] rapture, to the wedding supper in the
[38:37] sky, to eternity rolling on when the
[38:39] devil and everything's no more. Praise
[38:42] the Lord.
[38:43] &gt;&gt; Amen. And so we can we can we can stand
[38:47] like Caleb and say, "I'm as strong now
[38:49] as I was the day I left Egypt." Amen.
[38:52] Give me this mountain. Why? Because he
[38:55] went by the strength of Almighty God. It
[38:57] wasn't his natural strength or his
[38:59] tenacity, you know, of human ability
[39:02] that made him that strong. No. Oh, no.
[39:04] It was because when he walked out of
[39:06] Egypt, he ate the blood of the lamb.
[39:09] Amen. that that the life was given for
[39:11] his house and he walked out in the
[39:13] strength of the lamb and because of
[39:15] revelation because of that lamb he
[39:17] conquered that mountain at 84 years old.
[39:20] Amen. That you you know the giants were
[39:22] there all the big hindrances were there
[39:25] but because of the strength of the Lord
[39:27] he took it. Amen. And it's the same
[39:31] thing with us.
[39:33] We walk because by him. Amen. I mean, if
[39:38] you think it's you being a Christian,
[39:39] you're going to fall on your face and be
[39:41] sorely disappointed, right? If you think
[39:43] it's your human ability, all it is is
[39:46] our surrender and then then he pours his
[39:49] strength in. Amen. And he has gone on
[39:53] before, he has already conquered all
[39:54] things. So, whatever you're going
[39:56] through uh at this very moment in your
[39:59] life, when you when you take of the
[40:01] Lord's supper, remember, just just have
[40:03] it in your heart. Lord, you've already
[40:04] conquered. You've already conquered my
[40:07] sickness, my trouble, whatever I'm going
[40:10] through. Maybe you feel down, depressed,
[40:12] I don't know, whatever. Whatever's
[40:15] fighting against you, our God has
[40:17] conquered and he's conquered in a mighty
[40:19] way. Amen. As he's called the royal seed
[40:22] of Abraham. Now, this is brother Brand
[40:24] in and possess uh possessing the gates
[40:26] of the enemy after trial. The royal seed
[40:28] of Abraham. Now, the natural seed could
[40:30] not point to that. But the royal seed
[40:33] can conquer already conquered. He has
[40:35] gone before us and conquered the gate
[40:37] for us. Amen. He is now after 2,000
[40:40] years, he stands in the midst of us, the
[40:41] mighty conqueror. Not only did he
[40:43] conquer sickness, he conquered sickness.
[40:46] He conquered temptation. He conquered
[40:47] every enemy. He conquered death. He
[40:49] conquered hell. He conquered the grave
[40:52] and rose up again. And 2,000 years
[40:54] later, here he stands among us this
[40:56] afternoon identifying himself the mighty
[40:58] conqueror. Amen. He is still here alive
[41:01] vindicating his promise. The royal seed
[41:04] of Abraham. Oh my.
[41:07] He is here proving his word. Amen. To
[41:10] show you that the call you first
[41:13] responded to is a call all the way up
[41:15] into glory. And he will strengthen your
[41:18] steps until that day when our bodies are
[41:21] changed and he takes us all home. So
[41:23] take courage, dear Christian. Amen. God
[41:26] is on the scene and he has poured out
[41:29] his abundant grace. What was the cry
[41:31] when the headstone the capstone came
[41:33] down was shouting grace grace unto it.
[41:36] Amen. And this is the season where that
[41:38] capstone of divine love has come down
[41:39] upon the bride of Jesus Christ. So we
[41:41] don't cry out our own ability or look
[41:43] what we've done. No we shout grace
[41:45] grace. Amen. A divine influence has been
[41:48] magnified like never before. I say the
[41:51] full strength of the of Calvary is in
[41:54] manifestation in this day. Amen. And we
[41:58] happen to be blessed enough by the grace
[42:00] of God to be able to partake of his
[42:03] allsufficient sacrifice. Amen. That we
[42:06] can walk victorious in every
[42:08] circumstance. Because remember, the God
[42:10] that called you is not going to leave
[42:12] you.
[42:13] &gt;&gt; He's going to take you all the way.
[42:16] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. So, let's um can we
[42:18] have the deacons, please, tonight? I
[42:20] didn't want to be too long, but I just
[42:22] want to let's I just I just want to
[42:24] encourage you. God is more than able.
[42:27] Whatever you're going through, don't
[42:29] despair. Don't be discouraged. Amen. No,
[42:32] God is more than able. Amen. Yeah.
[42:34] Please bring it over here. Amen. Let's
[42:36] all stand. Amen. Because you think what
[42:38] what amazing what incredible price the
[42:41] Lord Jesus put. He paid the ultimate
[42:44] price that day on Calvary where he
[42:46] poured out his life without measure.
[42:49] I just want to hold something up. Sorry.
[42:52] Christine pointed this out. Sorry,
[42:54] honey. I'm going to I'm going to drag
[42:55] you into this. This is a bear. Okay.
[42:57] Yeah, it's a bear. Remember what brother
[42:59] Chris Mitch preached a few years ago?
[43:01] It's bear season.
[43:02] &gt;&gt; Amen. So So it's open season on whatever
[43:05] enemy's roaming in your ground. You have
[43:07] a right to take your sword or take your
[43:09] gun, whatever weapon you got. Slingshot,
[43:11] kill the thing.
[43:13] &gt;&gt; Amen. And but how do we do it? By the
[43:16] sacrifice of Calvary, by the blood of
[43:18] the Lord Jesus Christ, by the Holy Ghost
[43:20] living in us. Amen. The enemy must be
[43:22] under our feet.
[43:23] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, amen. We thank the Lord for
[43:26] all he's done. Amen. So, let's just bow
[43:27] our heads, shall we? Just I just pray
[43:29] this will be a real sacred moment
[43:30] because you got to think, Lord, you
[43:32] know, when we get there, we'll say,
[43:33] Lord, it was all you.
[43:35] &gt;&gt; It was all you, Lord. You found me. You
[43:37] kept me. You've brought me here. You put
[43:40] it in me to respond to your call. It
[43:41] wasn't my human ability. It was
[43:43] something in me that said yes. Amen. So
[43:46] it so it's all him. Amen. So let's just
[43:48] bow heads. Let's pray. Amen. Gracious
[43:50] heavenly father, almighty God, as we
[43:53] stand here tonight Lord, we are so
[43:56] thankful Lord that we can Lord partake
[44:00] Lord Jesus of this of this unleaven
[44:02] bread that represents your body. Lord I
[44:04] pray you would bless it my God. Father,
[44:07] as you stood there, Lord, at the um at
[44:09] that Passover, Lord, the last one you'd
[44:11] have with your disciples, you said you
[44:13] longing to have that with them, Lord
[44:15] Jesus, because now was this time when
[44:17] you would you would be offered, Lord, as
[44:19] our sacrifice, Lord, is the uh John the
[44:22] Baptist said, "Behold the lamb of God
[44:23] that would take away that takes away the
[44:25] sin of the world, Lord. You're about to
[44:27] do it, Lord." Few hours after that
[44:29] moment, dear God, and you took the bread
[44:31] and you and you broke it and you blessed
[44:33] it, said, "This is my body which is
[44:34] given. Do this in remembrance of me. So,
[44:38] Father, as we partake of this unleavened
[44:40] bread, Lord, we think of your body that
[44:42] was marred more than any other man.
[44:44] Lord, you were wounded for our
[44:46] transgressions. The chastisement of our
[44:48] peace was upon you. You were bruised for
[44:50] our iniquities, Lord. But by your
[44:51] stripes, we're healed. So, Father, I
[44:54] pray, dear God, if there's anyone sick
[44:55] here, Lord, that would partake of the
[44:58] bread and the wine, Lord, which
[45:00] represents your blood, your life, that
[45:01] you poured out without measure in
[45:03] completeness. Lord, you were more than
[45:05] just wounded. You gave your life, but
[45:06] you said, "If I lay my life down, I'll
[45:08] pick it back up again." Lord, you gave
[45:10] your life as a total ransom for us, my
[45:14] God. Lord, you purchased our salvation
[45:16] completely that that day on Calvary. And
[45:18] Lord, we're so thankful that we are
[45:20] partakers of your divine grace, Lord
[45:23] Jesus, that we've become one with our
[45:24] sacrifice, my God. Lord, as we uh Lord,
[45:27] as everyone who comes and stands here
[45:29] and partakes of the bread and the wine,
[45:30] Lord Jesus, they are they are they are a
[45:33] living testimony showing that they are
[45:35] be they have become one with you, Lord,
[45:37] as they become one with this bread and
[45:38] wine representing your your body and
[45:40] your blood. So, I pray you'd bless this
[45:42] wine, Lord, that represents your blood.
[45:44] You you'd bless this bless this bread
[45:46] which represents your body. And Father,
[45:48] we just want to just pray you'd purify
[45:50] our hearts. Forgive us any sin, Lord. I
[45:52] pray for everyone here, Lord. Just may
[45:54] may there be nothing between us and you.
[45:57] And dear God, we also especially want to
[45:58] remember those who are sick and body who
[46:00] can be here tonight. Lord, brother Phil
[46:02] comes to mind, Lord Jesus. Pray you
[46:04] touch them, my God. May you raise them
[46:06] up for your glory, Lord. Anyone else,
[46:07] Lord, who's unwell in body, Father. May
[46:10] you be their abundant portion. So, dear
[46:11] God, we commit this time into your
[46:13] hands. We thank you so much, Lord, for
[46:15] this in Jesus Christ's name. Amen.
[46:19] &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you, friends. You can
[46:20] have your seats and you just you just
[46:22] come up when you're ready. As the Bible
[46:24] says, carry one for another and let a
[46:27] let a man examine himself before he
[46:29] partakes. Amen.
[46:31] [Music]
[46:34] No matter what I see,
[46:38] no matter what I feel,
[46:42] no matter what I hear,
[46:46] I believe.
[46:49] No matter what I'm told,
[46:53] no matter how it seems,
[46:56] no matter what it cost,
[47:01] I believe.
[47:05] And if I look and it seems like it's
[47:09] broken,
[47:10] [Music]
[47:12] I'll lay a hallelu
[47:15] on the altar.
[47:20] And if I look and it seems like it's
[47:24] over,
[47:25] [Music]
[47:27] I'll lay a hallelujah
[47:30] on the altar
[47:34] because he's a miracle. He's a miracle.
[47:39] He's a miracle working God. He's a
[47:43] miracle. He's a miracle. He's a miracle
[47:47] working God. He's a miracle. He's a
[47:52] miracle. He's a miracle working God.
[47:57] He's a miracle. He's a miracle. He's a
[48:01] miracle working God. A miracle working.
[48:05] No matter what I see,
[48:09] no matter what I feel,
[48:12] no matter what I hear,
[48:17] I believe.
[48:19] No matter what I'm told,
[48:23] no matter how it seems,
[48:26] no matter what it costs,
[48:31] I believe.
[48:35] And if I look and it seems like it's
[48:38] broken,
[48:41] I'll lay a hallelujah
[48:44] on the altar.
[48:48] And if I look and it seems like it's
[48:52] over,
[48:55] I'll lay a hallelujah
