[22:30] [Music]
[22:51] we're on a journey
[22:57] [Music]
[23:27] yes
[23:31] interesting
[23:33] [Music]

[24:25] [Music]
[24:33] to be
[24:38] thirty
[24:39] [Music]
[24:53] bummer
[24:56] [Music]
[25:05] where
[25:15] and now the bride herself
[25:18] himself
[25:20] [Music]
[25:31] I mean hopefully should stand as we
[25:52] create the work we'll go to a bruise
[25:54] this fighting this fight
[26:47] and you just five points PowerPoint and
[26:52] you'll get some reason that's not
[26:56] bringing
[27:19] amen
[27:27] just like my slideshow and I'll start
[27:29] and he opened it PowerPoint that's
[27:33] called a body thou has prepared Hebrews
[27:39] 10 verse 5 wherefore when he cometh into
[27:42] the world he saith sacrifice and
[27:44] offering thou what is not but a body
[27:46] thou has prepared me the time it pray
[27:55] dear Heavenly Father Lord we just pray
[27:58] father that you just come and just
[28:00] anoint this word Lord I only see Lord
[28:03] that Satan were just trying to attack
[28:05] what I'm trying to show the people
[28:06] father Lord we just pray that your Holy
[28:09] Spirit would come down like oh Jesus
[28:12] just cast the devil out of this place we
[28:15] love you we thank you and we praise you
[28:16] in the precious name of the Lord Jesus
[28:18] Christ
[28:27] so a time had come when God had been
[28:30] building this masterpiece up through the
[28:32] Old Testament and he had built it up to
[28:35] the point where now the son was going to
[28:36] camp because God no longer wanted the
[28:39] sacrifice of bulls and goats all right
[28:40] he wanted a body they wanted a body to
[28:43] dwell in and he wants exactly the same
[28:45] thing in a second coming he wants a body
[28:48] to dwell in and the scripture that we
[28:50] just read it can apply also to this
[28:52] coming God has always chose man to
[28:55] express himself and the whole Bible was
[28:58] an expression of the character of Jesus
[29:01] Christ everything that was in Christ is
[29:03] on display even the bat that good you
[29:07] know the good things but also the bad
[29:09] things that ugly things us all revealed
[29:11] and the Bible but there was going to
[29:16] have to come a time where Jesus Christ
[29:18] would come into the world and break that
[29:20] cycle of sacrifice and bring us into
[29:23] into the blood atonement of Christ right
[29:26] and John 1:18 it said no man has seen
[29:31] God at any time there a low hand the
[29:33] eternal thought no man had seen God at
[29:35] any time the only begotten Son which is
[29:38] in the bosom of the Father he hath
[29:39] declared so in the first coming it was
[29:44] being declared and in the seeking coming
[29:47] it would do just the same the expressed
[29:49] and the Jesus would be expressed in the
[29:51] flesh and he's going to work through a
[29:54] prepared body and we know brother
[29:58] Branham taught three comings of the Lord
[29:59] right not two comings like the world see
[30:02] but three comings because this first
[30:04] coming was to redeem his bride and his
[30:06] seeking coming was in his bride and the
[30:09] third coming he comes with his bride so
[30:12] we can't mix up those coming and his
[30:16] bride and coming with us Brian yeah God
[30:20] has always had a three-fold plan like
[30:22] he's completed in threes and there's a
[30:24] work to be done on the body of Christ
[30:26] and the seeking coming and it started
[30:29] with that shout where he himself
[30:32] descended but he never left he continues
[30:36] and now he has a voice and their voices
[30:38] and the bride
[30:39] and it continues right on to the final
[30:42] right body thou has prepared me it
[30:48] was Christ and brother Brennan revealing
[30:50] the Son of Man and its Christ and the
[30:52] bride I mean when when when the prophet
[30:55] went off the scene God didn't go off the
[30:57] scene God stay amen have you got that
[31:02] brother can you give me a remote and
[31:08] take me on to the second slide x1 verse
[31:17] 7 and he said unto them it is not for
[31:21] you to know the times or the seasons
[31:22] which the father hath put in his own
[31:24] power but ye shall receive power after
[31:27] that the Holy Ghost is come upon you and
[31:29] you shall be witnesses unto me both in
[31:32] Jerusalem and in all Judea and in
[31:34] Samaria and unto the uttermost parts of
[31:37] the earth this is our this is our
[31:40] mission to get this word to the
[31:42] uttermost parts and when he had spoken
[31:45] these things while they beheld he was
[31:47] taken up and a cloud received him out of
[31:49] their sight and while they looked up
[31:51] steadfastly towards heaven as he went
[31:53] behold two men stood by them in white
[31:57] apparel which also said Ye men of
[31:59] Galilee why stand ye gazing up into
[32:01] heaven the same Jesus which has taken up
[32:03] from you into heaven shall so come in
[32:06] like manner as you have seen him going
[32:08] together it wasn't every man that saw
[32:12] him ascend into heaven it was just the
[32:15] ones that he came to his bride and not
[32:17] every man will see him when he returns
[32:20] it will be those that are looking for
[32:22] him why because the world's looking for
[32:24] now Pierce hands and we're not looking
[32:27] for now Pierce hands we're looking for
[32:28] the Word made flesh I mean and he's
[32:32] returned and like manna and the son of
[32:34] man ministry and the son of man has
[32:36] declared and said that's our Judge up
[32:39] there he was declaring the coming of the
[32:41] Lord
[32:48] I think I've got control of this Matthew
[32:57] 28 verse 16 then the eleven disciples
[32:59] went away into Galilee into a mountain
[33:02] where Jesus had appointed them and when
[33:04] they saw him they worshiped him but some
[33:06] doubted and he has returned and like
[33:10] manner that he went up and he's been
[33:12] declared there's our judge and his bride
[33:15] believed amen but some doubted so don't
[33:20] worry about the people that doubt this
[33:21] message that wasn't given to them to
[33:24] receive the message and they're just
[33:26] fulfilling the scripture because some
[33:28] doubted and right now he's working in
[33:32] the church and I believe he's working in
[33:34] this church and he has a ministry and my
[33:37] question to myself was what is their
[33:39] ministry what is their ministry that's
[33:41] on the bride Matthew 8 verse 19 and
[33:48] certain scribe came to him and said unto
[33:50] her master I will follow thee
[33:52] whithersoever thou goest and jesus saith
[33:54] unto Him the foxes have holes and the
[33:57] birds of the air have nests but the Son
[33:59] of man hath not where to lay his head so
[34:02] they were asking him where is your
[34:04] kingdom we're weird where do you go I
[34:07] thought the son of David come to
[34:09] establish a kingdom where do you lay
[34:10] your head and King David you know he
[34:15] thought the same thing he wanted to
[34:16] build the Lord a house but the Lord
[34:19] didn't want to dwell in the house made
[34:21] by hands he wanted to dwell and Men and
[34:24] so the Lord's been building up this
[34:27] bride through seven church ages until
[34:29] she can come into a maturity and because
[34:31] that Capstone's got to come down the
[34:33] seeking coming
[34:34] that's the headship and it's coming to
[34:36] the body so now he has a place where he
[34:39] can lay his head today that scripture is
[34:42] fulfilled I mean the bride will be
[34:46] Christ himself expressed and the flesh
[34:50] brother Brennan said she is him just as
[34:53] he was in his first coming so will he be
[34:55] in a second coming the bride is the
[34:57] feminine part of God right so in when
[35:01] God took Adam and he said it's not good
[35:03] that man be alone and so Lucy creates
[35:06] men and he takes a lump of dirt and he
[35:09] creates men and now he's gonna and now
[35:12] he's saying now I'm going to create a
[35:14] bright because he doesn't go and grab a
[35:15] different month do it man it grabs the
[35:18] same lump the same lump that Adam was
[35:20] made out of he takes out an ad on the
[35:22] site so the brightest every part of
[35:24] Christ as he is part of private it's
[35:27] just been separated to the express to
[35:29] the body the marriage of uniting us here
[35:48] and mighty goddamn bow before us then it
[35:51] was God in them days it was God and a
[35:54] man but his son Jesus the Son Jesus
[35:56] Christ we believe that not just a
[36:00] prophet not just an ordinary man
[36:03] ordinary human it was God in Christ God
[36:06] and man the fullness of the Godhead
[36:07] bodily and a man God and a man yeah I
[36:11] mean now it's God and men the fullness
[36:15] of God and the Godhead bodily and his
[36:17] entire church manifesting himself
[36:19] manifesting himself fulfilling his word
[36:22] now we find God and all ages has had
[36:26] skin on earth he God has been hid behind
[36:28] a veil is this not working so the Lord
[36:39] showed me something and it's quite hard
[36:40] to Express so I really just I just pray
[36:44] the Lord will help me to show you it the
[36:46] way that he revealed it to me so I want
[36:49] to go back and look at the Tabernacle in
[36:51] the wilderness because it's revealing
[36:53] something for our day because the Old
[36:55] Testament was a shadow right yeah a
[36:58] shadow was not the real so if you see my
[37:00] shadow on the wall there and that but
[37:03] that's not actually me it's only it's
[37:05] only a shadow of me it's showing the
[37:07] real thing but the shadow is not the
[37:10] real thing
[37:10] so the Tabernacle in the wilderness was
[37:12] not the real thing
[37:13] but it was a shadow of the real thing
[37:15] that would be expressed that's his full
[37:18] bedroom it was a shadow of the real
[37:22] thing that would be expressed in the New
[37:24] Testament and we know it had three
[37:26] courts our outer court the inner court
[37:28] and the Holy of Holies and it's our body
[37:30] our spirit and our soul represented and
[37:34] inside the Holy of Holies was the mercy
[37:37] seat which as Jesus Christ Christ was a
[37:40] true mercy seat but the tabernacle was
[37:43] veiled with badger skins and I asked
[37:48] myself brother Branham talks about us
[37:50] all the time they were behind badger
[37:51] skins so I started searching deeper what
[37:55] what does this mean so we're going to
[37:59] come to that in a minute the next was a
[38:00] scam of Iran
[38:02] it was dyed red showing the blood
[38:04] offering Isaac being offered up the hat
[38:07] to be an offering he had to come through
[38:09] the blood before you could have access
[38:12] to come further into the tent to
[38:13] approach than the SEC so and Easterns
[38:24] revised Bible dictionary this is on the
[38:27] on the Bible on or anywhere you find
[38:30] your Bible dictionary this is the
[38:33] revised version and they said the word
[38:36] badger skin is found in Exodus these
[38:39] scriptures and in numbers the tabernacle
[38:42] was covered with badger skins the shoes
[38:44] of woman were also made of them in
[38:46] Ezekiel our translators seemed to have
[38:49] been mislead by the similarity and the
[38:51] sound of the Hebrew takács and the Latin
[38:54] Texas a badger the revisers have
[38:56] correctly substituted seal skills
[39:00] Wow Wow
[39:02] because this is just a shadow right and
[39:04] now the whole team is hidden behind the
[39:08] seals so it's going to take the opening
[39:10] of the seals coming and approach Christ
[39:12] I also found it interesting that this
[39:22] badger skins that's true that's
[39:24] mentioned six times in Exodus and if you
[39:27] know your Bible numbers sex has always
[39:29] got about to reveal something in the
[39:31] seventh of a six waterpots revealing
[39:33] Christ there was a seventh right so I
[39:37] thought this is something going to
[39:39] happen here and the next time the
[39:41] seventh time it's mentioned as a numbers
[39:43] chapter four which is also an important
[39:46] number number of deliverance so numbers
[39:52] for first five it says and when the camp
[39:55] sitteth fourth so now they're talking
[39:57] about when the camp moves right Aaron
[40:00] shall come and his sons and they shall
[40:01] take down the covering Bale and cover
[40:03] the Ark of the testimony with it and
[40:05] shall put there on the covering of
[40:07] badger skins and shall spread over it a
[40:11] cloth wholly of blue and shall put on
[40:14] the staves thereof
[40:15] so the tents about to be packed up to be
[40:19] moved and I thought what's this picture
[40:21] painting because if the bible's painting
[40:24] a picture here of what they did with the
[40:26] mercy seat when they when they moved
[40:27] there was a process of how they moved
[40:30] the mercy seat in Christ as that mercy
[40:35] seat and he's wrapped up in a vow that
[40:37] the veil was broke at Calvary right the
[40:40] veil was torn at Calvary giving men
[40:41] access to the mercy seat but the
[40:44] fullness of Christ was still to be
[40:45] wrapped up in a mystery and had behind
[40:47] seven seals head behind skin God still
[40:51] veiled behind skin bailed behind the
[40:54] seals so why a cloth of blue I R so I
[40:58] studied what is blue mean in the Bible
[41:00] what does it represent and blue I found
[41:04] as representing the law and so I
[41:07] searched in the Bible blue and I found
[41:09] it came out 49 times and the Old
[41:12] Testament 49 times 49 the 49th year was
[41:15] the longest year right because why we
[41:17] were held under law and so then you go
[41:21] over into the new test and that and the
[41:23] word blue is not even mentioned at all
[41:24] it's not even in the New Testament so
[41:28] then I went to my other Bible app that I
[41:30] had and i typed in blue and it came out
[41:32] 50 times and I thought what's going on
[41:35] here why is the Bible contradicting
[41:37] itself what happened in the second Bible
[41:39] ever brought up another word that the
[41:42] first Bible web didn't and that was blue
[41:44] Ness so the word I had still had blowing
[41:47] up a balloon s and so I found out and I
[41:50] thought oh yeah this is very interesting
[41:52] yeah
[41:58] so it come up in proverbs 20 verse 30
[42:02] so straightaway I thought oh 50 so
[42:05] here's my 50th verse coming into this
[42:08] blue and it says the blueness of a wound
[42:10] cleans up the way evil so do the stripes
[42:13] that n-word parts of the belly so now
[42:15] we're going to transition from law of
[42:18] the Old Testament and to the Grace and
[42:19] the New Testament and we know in Isaiah
[42:22] 53 it says but he was wounded for our
[42:25] transgressions he was bruised
[42:27] see the blueness right the blueness of a
[42:31] wound cleanses the way evil he was
[42:32] bruised for our iniquity and and and the
[42:36] so do the stripes and wood parts of our
[42:38] bella le and by his stripes we were
[42:41] healed amen
[42:44] it's the jubilee which breaks us away
[42:46] from the law you know though we fall
[42:49] though before we shall not be cast down
[42:51] amen the sounding of Revelation 10 seven
[42:57] has broken you free from the law of men
[42:58] and from tradition and that's why you
[43:02] know you say well we have that we have
[43:05] if we're not under the law we can just
[43:07] sin right but it's not it's not that
[43:10] we're under a law but when C relied you
[43:15] know she lied directly to God in God
[43:19] could have killed it but she was under
[43:21] grace because she was a part of of
[43:23] Christ right Jacob he lied upon the name
[43:27] of God but he was a part of Christ but
[43:31] we don't we just we don't sin we live a
[43:33] holy life because we love Christ not
[43:37] because we're under the law and you will
[43:40] neither come into the fullness of this
[43:41] message and see Christ while you're
[43:43] stuck under that book you will not see
[43:47] God doesn't roll over his bride with law
[43:51] yeah he doesn't want to bribe that Susan
[43:54] out of out of been suppressed like a
[43:57] controlling husband that controls his
[43:59] wife she she she just as with him
[44:02] because she's scared she'll get a
[44:03] beating
[44:04] I mean he wants a wife that serves
[44:07] because she loves him so you know it's
[44:12] other laws that have been broken the law
[44:14] of gravity right don't tell me to be
[44:17] quiet and sit down in my view I mean
[44:19] that law of gravity has been broken I
[44:22] found it funny one time Nadine was
[44:26] riding a bike and she was texting and I
[44:28] said that's not a good idea
[44:30] she said there's no law against that I
[44:32] said here there is it's called the law
[44:33] of gravity
[44:35] but we're defining gravity you know
[44:38] often thought about this
[44:40] that's that law of gravity that stops
[44:43] you from raising your hand and surrender
[44:45] to Christ we go I surrender all okay
[44:52] now the police come in here and say put
[44:53] your hands up I surrender
[44:56] what are we give Christ you know what do
[45:00] we get the devil what do we give Christ
[45:02] we ought to fall surrender as we love
[45:06] [Music]
[45:10] and shall put there on the covering of
[45:13] badger skins and shall spread over a
[45:14] cloth holy of blue and she'll put the
[45:16] staves and the staves zero to get to the
[45:19] mercy seat you had to break through the
[45:21] law break through that blue cross you
[45:24] have to be freed from the law before you
[45:26] can go through the opening of the seals
[45:28] and approach that in a veil to go
[45:31] through that in a veil you can't even go
[45:33] through the in avail until the seals are
[45:36] opened and now you come right into the
[45:38] place where Christ is amen all wrapped
[45:41] up in a mystery so don't get stuck in
[45:44] tradition don't get caught up looking at
[45:46] the law you can have an intellectual
[45:49] understanding of this message right yeah
[45:52] and you can have an understanding of the
[45:54] seals yeah but still have very little
[45:57] revelation and what will happen the
[46:02] devil will get you looking at everybody
[46:04] else's fault what about the mote that's
[46:10] and all he's doing is robbing your
[46:14] attention yeah he doesn't want you to
[46:15] get anything out of the service so
[46:17] instead of receiving from the ministry
[46:19] you're looking or looking at the
[46:21] preacher going there or you're looking
[46:25] at someone else man whose skirts short
[46:27] today I can even see her knees or
[46:28] something else and you'll you know help
[46:34] us not to be like that because that's
[46:36] been broken and what you need to realize
[46:40] is you have an opportunity to help that
[46:43] person and you're going to sit there and
[46:45] judge them
[46:47] and put them out of the body so it's how
[46:50] do you apply your ministry towards the
[46:52] issue that you've maybe recognized until
[46:59] you can recognize the trumpet sound
[47:01] sounding the jubilee you can not see
[47:03] Christ the word as he's hidden behind
[47:05] those seven seals this whole mystery
[47:08] this whole picture of this Tabernacle
[47:09] wrapped up and this picture and you have
[47:13] no access to that mercy seat without
[47:15] coming through the process that's been
[47:16] laid out the other interesting thing was
[47:22] all the precious things of this
[47:23] Tabernacle when it was moved were
[47:25] wrapped up and badger skins and seal
[47:28] skins so the seven golden candlesticks
[47:30] they took it down they wrapped it up in
[47:31] a seal skin so you can't even see the
[47:33] messengers to the church age until the
[47:36] seals are open and you can see them
[47:41] these badger skins and regards to the
[47:44] tabernacle were mentioned six times in
[47:46] Exodus and seven times and numbers
[47:49] making thirteen we know thirteen as a
[47:52] number of a woman so what's it showing
[47:54] us this whole tabernacle is showing a
[47:56] picture of a woman because brother
[47:58] Branham said it was husband in the Old
[48:01] Testament and wife and the New Testament
[48:04] and this was the shadow so I was showing
[48:06] Christ at the same picture and the New
[48:08] Testament are showing a woman it's all
[48:12] about marriage a seventh seal and it's
[48:14] revealed and every type in the Bible and
[48:16] just in case you search this and look
[48:18] and you see badger skins come out 14
[48:21] times the last verse which is in Ezekiel
[48:24] it talks about the sandals that the
[48:28] woman would wear so now as a picture of
[48:31] a woman that's got her feet shod with
[48:33] the gospel the opening of the word
[48:35] walking in the light of the word that
[48:37] just all pieces together it's just
[48:40] amazing he's leased some very important
[48:45] work to be done in this time and he will
[48:47] now work through his bride
[48:55] bespoken weirdest original see those in
[48:58] the bride do only as well no one can
[49:01] make them do otherwise they have thus
[49:03] sayeth the Lord or they keep still they
[49:06] know that it has to be God and them
[49:08] doing the works for filling his own word
[49:10] he did not complete all his work while
[49:13] in his earthly ministry so now he works
[49:18] in and through the bride
[49:20] she knows that for it was not yet time
[49:23] for him to do certain things that he
[49:25] must now do but he will now fulfill
[49:29] through the bride that work which he
[49:31] left for this specific time amen there's
[49:37] been a work leaf to do in this time and
[49:39] this breach right we're in a breach
[49:41] between the church ages and the
[49:43] Millennium because brother Brennan
[49:45] showed us when Christ came the first
[49:48] time he come a son of man but in through
[49:50] the church agents he was son of God but
[49:53] then there would come a time at the end
[49:55] of the Laodicean Church age spiritually
[49:57] that he would come again as son of man
[50:00] before he's the son of David in the
[50:03] Millennium so we're right in this breach
[50:06] now right in this breach time and
[50:08] there's been a work lift to do we
[50:12] actually have a part in the plan of
[50:14] redemption for this day and the time of
[50:19] Easter there would have been no
[50:21] hopefully for God's people if she didn't
[50:24] play her part in God's plan of
[50:26] redemption right the whole plan of
[50:29] redemption for God's people actually
[50:31] rested on Easter do you think of that
[50:34] and how important our ministry then is
[50:37] our God still has a voice for the people
[50:45] of the world even as he has given a
[50:47] voice to the bride that voices and the
[50:51] bride as we have said so my three
[50:54] questions
[50:55] do you recognize who he is and some some
[51:00] response do you recognize who he is
[51:02] do you recognize who you are
[51:06] I mean until we do we know what our
[51:08] ministry is what's our ministry because
[51:12] this is what I'm asking myself what's
[51:15] the work that he wants to do through me
[51:17] and a second coming
[51:23] identified masterpiece of God he is
[51:26] making a bride yes sir he is hoeing the
[51:28] chips now chopping off the world Oh
[51:30] church joining in creeds and
[51:32] denominations and dogmas all has to be
[51:35] cut away from the church the formal
[51:36] ideas their indifference their doctrines
[51:39] and things come back and let the master
[51:41] pick up the bow let the master pick you
[51:44] up in his hands strike the word say
[51:47] Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today
[51:49] and forever now this is incredible
[51:52] say Amen Lord make me mold me make me
[51:56] Lord what I should be then there'll be a
[51:58] different thing then if I be lifted up
[52:01] from the earth I'll draw all men unto me
[52:04] amen now he's placing the scripture on
[52:07] the bride if she'd be lifted up she'll
[52:09] draw me in unto her because he's been a
[52:12] bride call that's called you out of
[52:13] Revelation chapter 3 right through the
[52:16] opening of the word and to Revelation
[52:19] chapter 4 and we're under their eagle
[52:21] anointing that rapture anointing will
[52:23] have been lifted up and now we're in a
[52:25] position where we can call the bride why
[52:29] cause we're repro for saying the same
[52:31] word that's already being spoken as a
[52:34] rapture taking place right now through
[52:36] the descending the shout the voice of
[52:38] Trump and he's calling us up out of
[52:41] Darkness and as he's lifting you up you
[52:45] know we've got to these Rebekah's and
[52:49] Stokes Valley
[52:49] you know there's Rebecca's in Vietnam
[52:53] this still a Rebecca to be called and
[52:56] this still has to be in a liaison
[52:58] ministry going out to call the Rebecca's
[53:03] no man could come unto Jesus unless he
[53:07] drawed them and the son of man through
[53:10] his bride as now calling his own the
[53:14] Prophet Elisha was the first fruit of
[53:16] the resurrection to call
[53:18] bride that Christ didn't leave with
[53:20] brother Brennan yeah but he played
[53:22] placed a double portion of that same
[53:25] spirit onto Elijah and the ministry
[53:29] continues the bride call as continuing
[53:31] through you revelation 10 verse 8 right
[53:33] you must eat the book and reprocess I
[53:36] the word there's some Debra's in this
[53:40] church that are already up the mountain
[53:43] that have already been lifted up they're
[53:44] placed right there set mature and
[53:47] Deborah was dwelling up Mount Ephraim
[53:49] and now Ephraim means to be I will be
[53:51] doubly fruitful and Deborah is calling
[53:55] down into the valley where JJ Ella's and
[53:58] she's under the suppression of cesira
[54:01] and she but she wants to Sarah to come
[54:03] up so Sarah the devil was going to be
[54:05] sold into the hand of a woman jo was
[54:09] predestinated but she's not in her
[54:11] mature place yet but there is a mature
[54:14] one that's helping her come near that
[54:16] legalistic you know we're not judging
[54:19] our brother or sister that's doing wrong
[54:21] but we're going to go and help them come
[54:23] into the same maturity of the word
[54:26] because jail hos under that suppression
[54:30] she has to take so Sarah into her own
[54:33] tent and strike the tent pig through the
[54:37] temples right through the temples which
[54:39] is the battleground and the mind she has
[54:41] to crucify the devil in her own mind
[54:43] because you cannot be united to Christ
[54:46] until your old husband is dead not
[54:48] divorced did
[54:49] Amen he continues this quote he's
[54:59] cutting you out now cutting you down to
[55:02] his word only cutting all the creeds and
[55:04] dogmas everything away from you trying
[55:07] to get you back to a bride for the son
[55:09] another masterpiece part of the word
[55:12] that word Jesus couldn't take that place
[55:16] you remember that day when they read in
[55:19] the book he read just a part of the
[55:21] prophecy left the rest of it for the
[55:25] last day we're supposed to take them
[55:31] so this is six months before he comes
[55:33] and preaches in me such birth pains and
[55:36] you know what happens on birth pains
[55:38] brother Brennan goes to take his test
[55:39] and the page is stuck together and he
[55:43] can't find his place in the tears and a
[55:46] Catholic priest gets up from the back
[55:48] and he's all dressed in his robes and he
[55:51] comes up and he said God's fixing to do
[55:53] something read out of my book so brother
[55:56] Brennan takes his book and he reads his
[55:59] text and he carries on doesn't think
[56:02] anything about it he's still focused on
[56:04] why his pages were stuck together but
[56:08] then as he was driving home I think the
[56:11] Lord says to him remember the time where
[56:13] Jesus went into the temple and the
[56:15] priests gave him the book and he read
[56:18] and he said this day the scripture is
[56:21] fulfilled so now in the second coming of
[56:24] Christ right and brother Brennan is in
[56:27] the same situation and in the priests
[56:29] hands in the book and he preaches the
[56:31] second part of the verse and he says
[56:33] this day the scriptures were thought
[56:35] that scripture related to Christ right
[56:38] so now he's showing the son of man
[56:41] ministry this day the scriptures fulfill
[56:44] and brother Branham was preaching birth
[56:46] pains which was the Vengeance of the
[56:48] Lord
[56:49] she's now groaning in pre tribulation
[56:52] and shaking she's burning about to give
[56:55] way to a more glorious one and the Lord
[56:59] shows him this day the second the second
[57:02] part of the scripture has been fulfilled
[57:03] the same Jesus Christ again behind the
[57:06] skin veil and a prophet but when Christ
[57:10] descended and veiled himself behind the
[57:12] Prophet God didn't leave with that
[57:14] prophet he just failed himself again
[57:17] behind skin and a bride hallelujah
[57:22] we're living in the second coming of
[57:24] Christ you know when Jesus came the
[57:26] first time when was his first coming was
[57:30] it when the star appeared and they said
[57:33] the Christ has come or was it when when
[57:37] the seed was placed inside the womb of
[57:39] Mary was that the start was that the
[57:42] first coming of the law
[57:44] or was that when he was born or was it
[57:47] when John the Baptist baptized and was
[57:49] that the first coming of the Lord or was
[57:51] that when he was on the cross and as
[57:53] he's dying and the graves opened and
[57:55] some of the dead raised up out of the
[57:57] grave was that the first camera or was
[58:00] the whole thing the first coming of the
[58:02] Lord then how should it be any different
[58:04] for the second coming it's not a single
[58:07] event right it was declared that brother
[58:11] Branham was the first fruit of the
[58:12] resurrection and it ends with the dead
[58:15] in Christ just like the first coming
[58:17] right amen it's a cycle what I found
[58:23] interesting just a little bit after he
[58:26] preached birth pains he preaches
[58:28] choosing of a bride and now he takes the
[58:31] sticks from Sam's and it takes from
[58:34] Revelation 21 verse 9 and he places
[58:37] himself in Revelation 21 verse 9 as the
[58:40] seventh vial angel because his ministry
[58:43] was to bring vengeance as started their
[58:45] cycle so at the opening of the word and
[58:51] the people rejected the word they
[58:53] crucified Christ for the second time and
[58:55] it started a cycle that was going to end
[58:58] with the full tribulation period right
[59:00] they said right now we're in pre
[59:01] tribulation but not all of this prophecy
[59:06] was fulfilled that day the scripture
[59:11] carried on right and there's an elijah
[59:16] pride ministry trailing right behind
[59:18] elijah to continue the work so i'll just
[59:24] pick it up and look for 17 and there was
[59:28] delivered unto him the book of the
[59:29] prophet Isaiah and when he read when he
[59:31] had opened the book he found the place
[59:33] where it was written the Spirit of the
[59:35] Lord is upon me because he hath anointed
[59:36] me to preach the gospel to the poor he
[59:39] has sent me to heal the brokenhearted to
[59:41] preach deliverance and to the captives
[59:44] recovering sight to the blind to set at
[59:46] liberty them that are bruised to preach
[59:47] the acceptable year of the Lord
[59:49] and he closed the book and gave it again
[59:52] to the minister and he sat down and all
[59:54] eyes were and sinning
[59:57] were fastened on him and he began to say
[59:59] unto them this day the scripture is
[1:00:01] fulfilled
[1:00:01] is same picture as what happens in the
[1:00:05] second coming right and the scripture he
[1:00:13] takes it from as as I a 61 verse 2 to
[1:00:17] proclaim the acceptable year of the Lord
[1:00:19] that's what Christ did right he doesn't
[1:00:20] come to judge the world not first coming
[1:00:23] he splits averse and the day of the
[1:00:26] vengeance of our God so now he comes to
[1:00:28] judge the world and the seeking coming
[1:00:30] but it doesn't end there it still
[1:00:32] carries on and this is where Elijah
[1:00:34] ministry picks up with a Brides ministry
[1:00:37] picks up and continues on to comfort all
[1:00:40] that mourn to a point unto them that
[1:00:43] mourn in Zion to give unto them beauty
[1:00:45] for Ashes the oil of joy for mourning
[1:00:48] the garment of praise for the spirit of
[1:00:50] heaviness that they might be called
[1:00:52] trees of righteousness the planting of
[1:00:54] the Lord that he might be glorified so
[1:00:58] we have a message to re prophesied of
[1:01:00] the world not a different message the
[1:01:02] same message right and our message as
[1:01:05] the world is and birth pains she's gone
[1:01:08] and this is the Uniting time you either
[1:01:10] unite to Christ or you perish but the
[1:01:12] world and there's only one place that he
[1:01:18] has provided that you can find that
[1:01:20] mercy seat and the bride is the mercy
[1:01:24] seat today right she is that she can be
[1:01:26] approached if you give you entertain
[1:01:30] angels unawares you offer somebody
[1:01:33] something and you actually don't realize
[1:01:35] that could be the Bride of Christ and
[1:01:37] the way that you treat that person may
[1:01:40] reflect on you when your face the white
[1:01:43] throne judgment and I'm not going to go
[1:01:45] too much on that because I want to look
[1:01:46] at that at another time a body thou has
[1:01:52] prepared me as bride to dwell Jesus is
[1:01:55] not far off I think I heard brother a
[1:01:57] man say Jesus is not far off away in
[1:02:00] some other world he's right here tonight
[1:02:02] and you can touch the hem of His garment
[1:02:05] he's manifesting himself again through
[1:02:09] you he's right here
[1:02:11] Jesus Christ I mean I look at you I see
[1:02:14] Christ why do I see Christ because I see
[1:02:16] the word made flesh in your life the
[1:02:20] bride is here for a purpose like Easter
[1:02:23] with a ministry God working through it
[1:02:25] so here to comfort all that mourn to
[1:02:30] appoint them that mourn in Zion and we
[1:02:33] know Zion is speaking of the bride to
[1:02:35] comfort all them that mourn and the
[1:02:36] bride yeah so how we were talking about
[1:02:38] not judging that helping to comfort all
[1:02:41] them that mourn and when to appoint all
[1:02:48] then that mourn in Zion and so in the
[1:02:51] Strong's when you look at this word and
[1:02:53] the Hebrew a point and means to put in
[1:02:56] place to sit in place so now it's the
[1:03:00] administrative Deborah putting that one
[1:03:02] that's not in her place you were
[1:03:04] pointing them appointing the bride
[1:03:06] showing her her place in the word to
[1:03:10] give them beauty for Ashes when I look
[1:03:15] into the mirror of God's Word it doesn't
[1:03:18] matter what my old life looks like I'm
[1:03:20] not looking at my old life I'm looking
[1:03:22] at the beauty that the Lord is doing
[1:03:24] sometimes it's hard but here's a ray
[1:03:27] doesn't find learn and clean away just
[1:03:29] don't criticize each other I just don't
[1:03:32] criticize because you have a ministry
[1:03:34] and an ability to put that person in
[1:03:36] their place through the word not through
[1:03:38] the heavy hand at all so this word for
[1:03:45] beauty and the Hebrew and means
[1:03:47] headdress or a turban to give them
[1:03:50] beauty for Ashes so they were once dead
[1:03:54] and their son but now you have the
[1:03:56] ability to give them beauty for Ashes a
[1:03:59] headship a headdress right because the
[1:04:03] headship has come that you can now have
[1:04:05] beauty for Ashes by putting on Christ
[1:04:08] instead of your old life that was dead
[1:04:14] you were born and sin and you were dead
[1:04:16] until that eternal seed that was inside
[1:04:19] you was quickened and lined up with the
[1:04:21] word lined up with your theophany
[1:04:25] Esther was head up to half the kingdom
[1:04:28] as yours you know why do you mourn why
[1:04:30] you said don't you know your inheritance
[1:04:33] don't you know what you have access to
[1:04:35] up to half of everything goes 5050 right
[1:04:37] marriage 50/50 sometimes we take a
[1:04:41] little more than 50 but Christ wants to
[1:04:44] give you 50 amen
[1:04:48] if you know who you are you will do the
[1:04:51] greater works brother Brennan seeing as
[1:04:53] you are a part of I am I am a part of I
[1:04:56] am it sees here the garment of praise
[1:05:01] for the spirit of heaviness and garment
[1:05:07] and this text here and the Hebrew it
[1:05:09] means a mantle you have the garment of
[1:05:12] praise the mantle what was Elijah what
[1:05:15] did Elijah pick up when Elijah left the
[1:05:18] scene he picked up a largest mentor so
[1:05:21] now you have the garment of praise why
[1:05:23] because you've picked up the Christ and
[1:05:26] knew the same ministry you put on that
[1:05:28] same garment garment of praise and carry
[1:05:31] on the same ministry because Jesus has
[1:05:34] left the work to be fulfilled and he's
[1:05:36] given us a double portion so what Christ
[1:05:39] did and the Prophet we should be able to
[1:05:42] do twice as much when we realize who we
[1:05:45] are and when Christ comes in and we come
[1:05:48] into maturity we should be able to do
[1:05:51] twice what we see we're not going to let
[1:05:55] the devil win anything and it should
[1:05:58] give you happiness to know who you are
[1:06:00] and that we have the power of the
[1:06:02] Resurrection in us and we have the power
[1:06:05] to call Lazarus from the grave it was a
[1:06:08] loud voice that awakened Nazareth and we
[1:06:12] just read the voices and the bride we
[1:06:14] have that loud voice we just have to
[1:06:18] have the faith to use it we have the
[1:06:20] resurrection life within us to call a
[1:06:22] bride to life that's been suppressed
[1:06:25] that they might be called the trees of
[1:06:27] righteousness the planting of the Lord
[1:06:31] there's not one member of the bride
[1:06:34] coming in today without hearing this
[1:06:36] message
[1:06:37] I'm just bringing it to a close I
[1:06:38] purposely not looking at my watch it's
[1:06:43] not one member of the bride coming in
[1:06:46] today without hearing this message
[1:06:53] taking sides with Jesus
[1:06:56] well one message that I preached this is
[1:06:58] my justification for going overtime well
[1:07:01] the one message that I preached to you
[1:07:03] all look I've been preaching from one to
[1:07:05] six hours I think this is interesting
[1:07:07] one to six hours six is always revealing
[1:07:09] Christ right one to six hours to you on
[1:07:12] a message well if I had to use one of
[1:07:14] those messages I take a week to take it
[1:07:16] just a little bit here a little bit
[1:07:18] there see because it's been stored up
[1:07:21] here it's just so much it's just so hard
[1:07:24] to express to you thorry
[1:07:26] because it's just it just all lines up
[1:07:28] together Nix Nix paragraph it's on tapes
[1:07:35] it'll go worldwide on the tapes with
[1:07:37] people in their houses them tapes will
[1:07:40] fall right into the hands of the
[1:07:42] predestinated of God he can direct the
[1:07:45] word he'll direct everything just
[1:07:47] exactly to its course that's the reason
[1:07:50] he sent me back here to do the store up
[1:07:52] food overseas and that's why we must be
[1:07:57] so sensitive to the leading of the Lord
[1:07:59] because every predestinated seed of God
[1:08:01] will find this message will find them
[1:08:04] because God directs his word and he's
[1:08:06] directing you he's directing you right
[1:08:08] to wear that Cedars that they can hear
[1:08:11] this message you know brother Brennan
[1:08:15] said that and then I didn't even know
[1:08:16] how this works right but he said there's
[1:08:18] going to be a people they never had the
[1:08:20] chance to hear the message and he said
[1:08:22] they will be raised up in the Millenium
[1:08:24] and given an opportunity to hear the
[1:08:26] message I don't even know how that fits
[1:08:29] but that's how much God directs his word
[1:08:35] it's directing your children as well
[1:08:38] you know and new children you have a
[1:08:41] ministry God can send you to talk to
[1:08:44] somebody about us he uses everybody he
[1:08:47] doesn't just use the ministry the whole
[1:08:49] pride the ministry musicians can come up
[1:08:58] it's not by chance it's not by chance
[1:09:03] that you were there when someone cried
[1:09:05] out to God God placed you there it's not
[1:09:09] by chance that brother Andy's going to
[1:09:12] Vietnam at a certain date of time for a
[1:09:15] certain amount of time to a certain city
[1:09:17] has been pre appointed by God it's not
[1:09:20] by chance because he's directing it's
[1:09:25] not by a chance then brother Branham was
[1:09:28] unfund land and a boy was hit by a car
[1:09:31] and killed and it just happened to be
[1:09:34] that the Prophet was there and the
[1:09:36] Prophet had seen it in a vision years
[1:09:38] before the Prophet didn't know that deed
[1:09:40] boy was going to be in Finland but God
[1:09:42] directed him to go at Finland at a
[1:09:45] certain time right in a certain season
[1:09:48] right to a certain town to a certain
[1:09:51] road where the dead boy was hurt as he
[1:09:53] can direct his word brother Branham said
[1:09:57] I'm afraid we're not getting people to
[1:09:59] Christ and that stumbled me for a long
[1:10:02] time when I seen people really strongly
[1:10:04] preaching the message and I thought why
[1:10:07] just take this Bible and preach the
[1:10:10] Bible because the Prophet said we're not
[1:10:12] getting people to Christ and the Lord
[1:10:14] revealed to me that this word is Christ
[1:10:17] and this message as this and this is
[1:10:21] there and without without this message
[1:10:24] this is just incompetent because I don't
[1:10:27] understand it because it has to be open
[1:10:30] so you're not going to get people to
[1:10:33] Christ without showing them the opening
[1:10:35] of the seals for a start because the
[1:10:37] mercy seat was wrapped up in the seals
[1:10:40] and if we just preached milk all we're
[1:10:44] going to do is grow big babies right
[1:10:46] there has to be something that we're
[1:10:48] growing into because it's the word as an
[1:10:52] it yeah and when you apply the net on
[1:10:55] the right side of the boat it'll catch
[1:10:56] the trophic trout maybe a me read our
[1:11:02] text again we for when he cometh into
[1:11:04] the world he say it's a crow Feist and
[1:11:07] offering thou what us not but a body
[1:11:10] thou has prepared me and I want you to
[1:11:13] recognize it he has prepared a body and
[1:11:15] it's your body and it's Christ in you
[1:11:18] the same Christ that was in the Prophet
[1:11:20] it's the same Christ that's in you it's
[1:11:22] still the second coming
[1:11:24] it started in the Prophet that's still
[1:11:26] here and never lived I know there's a
[1:11:34] whole lot more to the bride's ministry
[1:11:36] and this is maybe just a opening to my
[1:11:38] thought of what is here ministry but
[1:11:40] this is just to show you the Lord is
[1:11:42] working through here it means so let's
[1:11:47] sing a couple of songs do we have that
[1:11:50] song let your word be born and a manger
[1:11:55] of my heart I said and worship extreme
