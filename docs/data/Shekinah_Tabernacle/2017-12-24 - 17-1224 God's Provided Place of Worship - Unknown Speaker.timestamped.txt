[50:06] slideshow so today so see it's here so
[50:15] it's so we're going to read Luke chapter
[50:17] 2 verses 1 down to verse 18 and it came
[50:22] to pass in those days that there went
[50:24] out a decree from Caesar Augustus that
[50:26] all the world should be taxed and this
[50:28] taxing was first made when Cyrenius was
[50:31] governor of Syria and all went to be
[50:33] taxed every one into his own City and
[50:35] Joseph also went up from Galilee out of
[50:38] the city of Nazareth into Judea unto the
[50:40] City of David which is called Bethlehem
[50:42] because he was of the house and lineage
[50:45] of David to be taxed with Mary his
[50:47] espoused wife being great with child and
[50:49] so it was that while they were there the
[50:52] days were accomplished that she should
[50:53] be delivered and she brought forth her
[50:55] firstborn son wrapped him in swaddling
[50:57] clothes and laid him in a manger because
[51:00] there was no room for them in the end
[51:02] and they were in the same country
[51:04] shepherds abiding in the field keeping
[51:05] watch over their flock by night and lo
[51:08] the angel of the Lord came upon them and
[51:10] the glory of the Lord shone around about
[51:11] them and they were sore afraid and the
[51:14] angel said unto them fear not for behold
[51:16] I bring you good tidings of great joy
[51:18] which shall be to all people for unto
[51:20] you Is Born This Day in the City of
[51:23] David a savior which is Christ the Lord
[51:25] and this shall be a sign unto you you
[51:27] shall find the babe wrapped in swaddling
[51:29] clothes lying in a manger and suddenly
[51:32] deals the there was with the angel a
[51:34] multitude of the heavenly host praising
[51:36] God and saying glory to God in the
[51:38] highest and peace on earth and goodwill
[51:40] towards men and it came to pass as the
[51:42] angels were gone away from them into
[51:45] heaven the Shepherd's said one to
[51:47] another let us now go even unto
[51:49] Bethlehem and see this thing which has
[51:51] come to pass which the LORD hath made
[51:53] known unto us and they came with haste
[51:55] and found Mary and Joseph and the babe
[51:58] in a manger and when they had seen it
[52:00] they made known abroad the saying which
[52:03] was told them concerning this child and
[52:05] all they that heard it wondered at those
[52:07] things which were told them by the
[52:10] shepherds amen and let's go to to Tirana
[52:13] me chapter 16 and verse 1
[52:32] we're gonna read down to verse eight so
[52:36] this is see you see it now see one there
[52:43] you see the rustle of Indian paper come
[52:46] to a cease and then that's the cue says
[52:48] observe the month of a bird which is
[52:51] April and keep the pass over unto the
[52:52] Lord thy God from the month of Abib the
[52:55] LORD thy God brought thee forth out of
[52:57] Egypt by night thou shalt therefore
[53:00] sacrifice the Passover unto the Lord thy
[53:02] God of the flock and the herd and the
[53:05] place which the Lord shall choose to
[53:07] place his name there now notice is very
[53:09] important the place he shall choose thou
[53:12] shall eat no leavened bread with it
[53:14] seven days shalt thou eat unleavened
[53:16] bread there worth even the bread of
[53:18] affliction for thou camest forth out of
[53:20] the land of Egypt and hast that thou may
[53:23] us remember the day when now comes forth
[53:25] other land of Egypt all the days of thy
[53:27] life and there shall be no leavened
[53:29] bread seen with thee and all biko seven
[53:32] days neither shall there be anything of
[53:34] the flesh which they'll sect sacrifices
[53:36] the first day it even remained all night
[53:39] until the morning
[53:40] thou mayst not sacrifice the Passover
[53:43] within any of thy gates which the LORD
[53:45] thy God giveth thee but at the place
[53:47] which the LORD thy God shall choose to
[53:50] place his name in there shall vow
[53:52] sacrifice the Passover even at the going
[53:55] down of the Sun at the season when thou
[53:58] comest forth out of Egypt and thou shalt
[54:00] roast and eat it in the place which the
[54:02] LORD thy God shall choose and thou shall
[54:05] turn in the morning and go unto thy
[54:07] tents six days shalt thou eat unleavened
[54:09] bread and on the seventh day shall be a
[54:12] solemn assembly to the LORD thy God thou
[54:14] shalt do no work there and amen may the
[54:17] Lord bless his word you may have your
[54:19] seats this morning I'd like to speak
[54:22] this morning on God's provided place of
[54:24] worship now we we are here in this
[54:28] Christmas season and we understand that
[54:31] you know we rejoice in the in the birth
[54:34] of our Lord Jesus Christ and many people
[54:39] will no doubt look at it as a historical
[54:41] thing in it and it was in that sense but
[54:43] he's a present God
[54:46] he's not in a manger anymore this
[54:47] morning if we go to Bethlehem we'll and
[54:49] even if they could find the manger he's
[54:51] not there anymore those shepherds aren't
[54:53] there anymore I mean but the but the
[54:55] Shepherd's message that Messiah is upon
[54:58] the earth presently amen is still the
[55:01] same that message is still the same and
[55:04] now we got to find we have to find in
[55:07] this hour where God has chosen to put
[55:10] his name and that's where we shall
[55:12] worship a man this is important we don't
[55:14] he said you weren't you shouldn't
[55:16] worship Justin just in any gate but in
[55:19] the gate that I have put my name in
[55:21] there you shall worship now we
[55:23] understand the Old Testament the Apostle
[55:25] Paul would speak in Hebrews 10 and 1 he
[55:28] said for the law having a shadow of good
[55:30] things to come and not the very image of
[55:32] things can never with those sacrifices
[55:33] were say offered year by year
[55:36] continually make the comers thereunto
[55:38] perfect and then in Colossians 2 and 16
[55:40] he says let no man therefore judge you
[55:43] in meat or in drink and respective
[55:44] holyday or of the new moon or of the
[55:46] Sabbath days which are a shadow of
[55:48] things to come but the body of Christ
[55:51] so we read through and the Old Testament
[55:52] was a shadow pointing towards a reality
[55:55] that we are now living in amen so we
[55:58] know the Old Testament is not just a a
[56:00] history of something that doesn't apply
[56:02] to us but it's a shadow pointing to
[56:04] Christ amen so we've got to find the
[56:07] gate we're going to find the place where
[56:09] God has chosen to put his name and
[56:11] that's where the believers are called to
[56:12] worship now we know in the Old Testament
[56:14] when they were journeying from Egypt to
[56:16] the promised land they had the
[56:18] Tabernacle in the wilderness and we
[56:20] understand that eventually that
[56:21] Tabernacle would be made into a temple
[56:23] made of stone and golden wood in the in
[56:26] the promised land but it wasn't the
[56:28] season for it to be made into that
[56:30] temple that Solomon built it had to be a
[56:31] mobile tent because that was how that
[56:33] because the people were journeying and
[56:35] that's where God placed his name and
[56:37] that was God's provided place of worship
[56:39] and then eventually David David's son
[56:42] Solomon would build him a house of stone
[56:44] and that was God's provided place of
[56:46] worship but that was just a shadow that
[56:49] was just a shadow he comes he comes
[56:51] Jesus is now born upon the earth and he
[56:54] says destroy this temple and in three
[56:56] days I'll raise it up again and the
[56:58] scribes and Pharisees
[56:59] caught up in there and there yo the
[57:01] physical things and the natural things
[57:03] and they didn't understand that he was
[57:05] speaking of his body which was the
[57:07] temple now God's name when when he
[57:12] reveals his name he is showing something
[57:15] he's going to manifest to the people now
[57:18] before man comes you read in Genesis 1
[57:20] it says God in the beginning God made
[57:23] heavens and the earth but then and that
[57:25] word God means Elohim the self existing
[57:28] one but then when but then when man is
[57:30] about to come up on the scene in chapter
[57:32] 2 it says and then the Lord God made and
[57:34] that's the self existing one who begins
[57:37] to reveal himself before man came upon
[57:40] the earth there was no one that he could
[57:41] reveal himself to he couldn't reveal
[57:43] himself to the animals they had nothing
[57:45] to respond back to him with he wanted
[57:48] his family upon the earth he wanted a
[57:50] relationship with his family to reveal
[57:52] himself to them that they could have a
[57:54] union they could have a relationship a
[57:57] mentor this is and then it's the Lord
[57:58] God and then now when when Abraham is
[58:03] walking with God God shows himself as El
[58:06] Shaddai I you know the life giver the
[58:08] it's called the breasted God like a
[58:10] mother breastfeeds a baby the strength
[58:12] Giver
[58:12] and he's known as Melchizedek who had no
[58:15] beginning or end we understand that was
[58:16] God himself a many he was young Almighty
[58:20] God God revealed himself in different
[58:22] ways through his name Amen it was the
[58:25] same God the whole time it wasn't a
[58:26] different God the same God revealing
[58:28] himself in different ways to Abraham
[58:30] because God has attributes we understand
[58:33] before there was a beginning he was a
[58:35] savior before there was a beginning he
[58:37] was a redeemer before there was anything
[58:39] Amen he was a sacrifice he was a priest
[58:42] he was a husband he is the comforter
[58:44] here's a provider here's a protector
[58:47] here's the captain of the host maybe it
[58:49] is a mighty mighty Conqueror he's all
[58:51] these things and many more and they are
[58:53] bound up in him but he wanted to express
[58:55] those attributes upon the earth to his
[58:57] people so he allowed sin to come into
[59:00] the picture men to be born into a fallen
[59:02] state then he did he that he could that
[59:05] he could show himself as a savior as a
[59:07] redeemer as an advocate hallelujah as a
[59:11] sacrifice
[59:13] they mean so God would begin to show
[59:15] himself down through the Old Testament
[59:18] was the same God but he would change his
[59:20] form but it was the same God all the
[59:21] time now it says here in Exodus 6 when
[59:27] Moses is speaking to Moses is speaking
[59:29] to God as his Nexus 6 and one says then
[59:32] the Lord said unto Moses now thou shalt
[59:34] see what I will do to Pharaoh for with a
[59:37] strong hand shall he let him go and with
[59:40] a strong hand shall he drive them out of
[59:42] his hand I mean our God is a God of
[59:44] deliverance and God said unto Moses and
[59:48] in said unto him I am the Lord and I
[59:50] appeared unto Abraham and to Isaac under
[59:52] Jacob by the name of God Almighty but by
[59:54] my name Jehovah was I not known to them
[59:57] now if you go read back in the Old
[59:59] Testament where it says then the Lord
[1:00:01] spoke to Abraham if you go look at the
[1:00:03] Hebrew that that word is actually
[1:00:05] Jehovah but the thing is they did not
[1:00:07] know Abraham did not know God as a
[1:00:10] deliverer he was never in slavery
[1:00:12] he was never in bondage so now God was
[1:00:15] going to express himself the same God
[1:00:17] that was back there with with Abraham
[1:00:19] Isaac and Jacob was going to show
[1:00:20] himself as a deliverer as a redeemer I
[1:00:23] mean to break the yoke affair off the
[1:00:25] people amen and that that Pharaoh would
[1:00:28] let them go and they would leave Egypt
[1:00:30] and they've gone to their inheritance
[1:00:31] God was going to express that part of
[1:00:33] himself hallelujah and the thing is he
[1:00:35] did it
[1:00:35] amen how God he was born he was born as
[1:00:39] a baby in a manger I mean he came the
[1:00:41] mighty deliverer upon the earth I mean
[1:00:43] it said every man woman and child free I
[1:00:46] mean from the yoke of sin from every
[1:00:48] worker the enemy of God as a God of
[1:00:50] deliverance friends we shouldn't just
[1:00:52] paint up some manger seananners and that
[1:00:54] lovely I just so rejoice it came my
[1:00:57] deliverance hallelujah and he didn't
[1:00:59] just come 2,000 years ago but he's a
[1:01:01] present God today a true Shepherd will
[1:01:04] say Messiah is present upon the earth
[1:01:06] now hallelujah they won't say I'll just
[1:01:08] look back in history and minutes like
[1:01:10] having a painted fire a painted fire
[1:01:12] doesn't get you warm
[1:01:13] it could be so lifelike you can have the
[1:01:16] most advanced yo TV or whatever and have
[1:01:20] a fire there and place it in your
[1:01:22] fireplace if you have one at home you
[1:01:24] won't get warm and may look
[1:01:26] very wonderful that may even look more
[1:01:27] real than a real fire it doesn't get you
[1:01:30] up and it's the same thing today I mean
[1:01:32] what's the point of just looking back in
[1:01:34] history if he's not the same God today
[1:01:36] what's the point in just saying yes he
[1:01:38] did those things back there but we don't
[1:01:40] know where he is
[1:01:40] amen and and and we look at say yes he
[1:01:44] did it back there for them he delivered
[1:01:45] them back there he's hid them free back
[1:01:47] there but what about today I mean he's
[1:01:50] not a God of history I mean when I think
[1:01:52] of Christmas I don't think of a God of
[1:01:53] history only I mean because he was in
[1:01:56] the manger but he's not in the manger
[1:01:58] anymore
[1:01:58] hallelujah he was back there but he's
[1:02:00] present I'm in the Centurion when he
[1:02:03] went to Jesus this is a Gentile coming
[1:02:05] to Jesus and he says I have a sick
[1:02:07] servant now this is Gentile faith and he
[1:02:10] said over 6 servant and Jesus says I'll
[1:02:12] go and lay my hands upon them I'll come
[1:02:13] into your house and lay hands upon him
[1:02:15] because that was Jewish faith let me
[1:02:17] just go lay your hands and they all
[1:02:19] would be well
[1:02:19] but the Centurion said I'm not worthy
[1:02:21] that you for you to come under my roof
[1:02:24] but I'm a man of authority Amen I tell
[1:02:27] soldiers to go and do and they go and do
[1:02:29] and he recognized Jesus was a man of
[1:02:31] authority as well but a far greater
[1:02:32] authority than just a soldier and he
[1:02:34] said but just speak the word only and I
[1:02:37] know my servant will be well he had a
[1:02:39] revelation that God sending his word was
[1:02:43] exactly the same as Jesus stepping into
[1:02:46] the house amen to - to pray for the
[1:02:49] servant because he knew that Jesus and
[1:02:52] his word of 1 you cannot separate them
[1:02:55] they are not two different people are
[1:02:56] two different things when the work comes
[1:02:58] your way
[1:02:59] that is the Messiah coming to you that
[1:03:02] is Jesus Christ coming to you hallelujah
[1:03:05] and this Gentile faith I mean he's not
[1:03:07] just up in heaven someplace while one
[1:03:09] day we'll meet and one day we'll see him
[1:03:10] and we'll be like yes he's present upon
[1:03:12] the earth his spirit is brooding upon
[1:03:14] the earth looking for those
[1:03:16] I mean who will receive him hallelujah
[1:03:20] see so so we're instructed now God says
[1:03:23] the place I put my name the place of his
[1:03:26] choosing he will not meet you on the
[1:03:28] basis of your theology he will not even
[1:03:31] meet you on the basis of only your
[1:03:32] sincerity amen but he meets you in the
[1:03:35] place that he is ordained not the place
[1:03:37] is convenient for us but
[1:03:39] place that he is ordained and we
[1:03:41] understand it's not a physical location
[1:03:44] Amen because we know that God put his
[1:03:48] name in his son amen
[1:03:51] we understand that win when the saw in
[1:03:54] Isaiah 7:14 it says therefore the Lord
[1:03:59] himself shall give you a sign behold a
[1:04:01] virgin shall conceive and bear a son and
[1:04:03] shall call his name Emmanuel which is
[1:04:06] God with us and I was a a nine and six
[1:04:08] for unto us a child was born
[1:04:11] for unto us a son is given and the
[1:04:13] government shall be upon his shoulder
[1:04:14] and his name shall be called wonderful
[1:04:17] counsellor the mighty God the
[1:04:18] everlasting father the Prince of Peace
[1:04:21] those are that that's what his name
[1:04:23] shall be but then when we come into the
[1:04:25] New Testament we find he's not called
[1:04:27] the wonderful the everlasting father
[1:04:30] counselor Emmanuel I mean he wasn't
[1:04:33] called that name it says in Matthew 1
[1:04:35] and 18 it says now the birth of Jesus
[1:04:37] Christ was on this wise when his mother
[1:04:40] Mary was espoused to Joseph before they
[1:04:43] came together she was found with child
[1:04:45] of the Holy Ghost then Joseph her
[1:04:48] husband being a just man and not willing
[1:04:50] to make her a public example was minded
[1:04:52] to put away privately but while he
[1:04:55] thought on these things behold the angel
[1:04:56] Lord appeared to him in a dream saying
[1:04:59] Joseph thou son of David fear not to
[1:05:01] take unto the mirror thy wife for that
[1:05:03] which is conceived of her is of the Holy
[1:05:05] Ghost and she shall bring forth a son
[1:05:07] and thou shalt call his name Jesus for
[1:05:10] he shall save his people from their sins
[1:05:12] this is the purpose of God saying this
[1:05:15] is why he's going to be called Jesus
[1:05:16] he's my salvation manifested upon the
[1:05:19] earth more than your salvation from a
[1:05:20] physical slavery I mean but a but a
[1:05:23] salvation from sin from unbelief from
[1:05:26] all the works of the flesh and then from
[1:05:28] a full of nature
[1:05:29] hallelujah is not just oh yes he's my
[1:05:31] he's my Redeemer he's my Savior but you
[1:05:34] but real faith produces it in the life
[1:05:36] I'm in the faith and the promise
[1:05:38] produces that in the life hallelujah and
[1:05:41] now all this was done notice that it
[1:05:44] might be fulfilled which is spoken of
[1:05:46] the Lord by the Prophet saying behold a
[1:05:48] virgin shall be with child and shall
[1:05:50] bring forth a son and they shall call
[1:05:52] his name
[1:05:53] manual which is being interpreted God
[1:05:55] with us then Joseph being raised from
[1:05:57] sleep that is the angel of the Lord had
[1:05:59] bidden him and took unto him his wife
[1:06:01] and you heard not till she brought forth
[1:06:03] her firstborn son and he called his name
[1:06:05] Jesus well then why didn't he call him
[1:06:08] the everlasting father the mighty God
[1:06:10] the counselor Prince of Peace because
[1:06:12] all of the oaths are encapsulated in the
[1:06:14] name of Jesus Christ that's why the name
[1:06:16] of Jesus is the name above all names
[1:06:18] because it's through the name of Jesus
[1:06:20] Christ deliverance is given salvation is
[1:06:23] given the rapture is given the body
[1:06:26] changes given aim in the devil's place
[1:06:28] down to the feet hallelujah rubble a
[1:06:30] believer because it's the name of Jesus
[1:06:32] Christ amen and that's why you see the
[1:06:34] angel the angel wasn't contradicting you
[1:06:37] know because that same angel of God
[1:06:39] anointed the prophet Isaiah has the Holy
[1:06:42] Spirit that same one anointed the
[1:06:44] prophet Isaiah gave him the prophecy the
[1:06:46] same one came to Joseph they weren't
[1:06:48] contradicting one another
[1:06:49] Amen but the interpretation of you shall
[1:06:51] call him your you know the you're a
[1:06:54] wonderful counselor the mighty God the
[1:06:55] everlasting father Prince of Peace the
[1:06:57] interpretation of that was the name
[1:06:59] Jesus hallelujah amen s now it's the
[1:07:03] same thing now now so God and Jesus said
[1:07:05] I come in my father's name John 5:43 I
[1:07:09] come in my father's name and you
[1:07:10] received me not if another shall come in
[1:07:12] his own name him you will receive so
[1:07:16] what name did he come in Jesus that's
[1:07:18] the name of the Father
[1:07:20] Allu yeah I came in my father's name
[1:07:23] he says you shall worship in the place
[1:07:25] with a Lord God shall choose to place
[1:07:28] his name in so the Lord placed his name
[1:07:31] in his son not in a physical location
[1:07:34] but in his son hallelujah and Jesus
[1:07:37] himself said Jesus said unto the
[1:07:39] beginning this is John 10 and 7 merely
[1:07:42] with us and he I am the door of the
[1:07:45] Sheep he is the door he is the gate Amen
[1:07:48] God place his name in there
[1:07:50] hallelujah so God won't meet us any in
[1:07:53] any other place but in this place now we
[1:08:00] understand that Jesus is his word he's
[1:08:05] not a separate
[1:08:06] as would the man of Galilee was the word
[1:08:09] made flesh and dwelt among us here's his
[1:08:13] word you cannot if you leave the word
[1:08:15] you've left Jesus he's not he's not
[1:08:19] simple you cannot separate him from his
[1:08:21] word if you leave the word you have left
[1:08:23] God and so now the place he has placed
[1:08:26] his name and you say well that's the man
[1:08:28] of Galilee in the beginning was the word
[1:08:30] and the Word was with God and the Word
[1:08:32] was God and the Word was made flesh and
[1:08:34] dwelt among us it's not just ink on
[1:08:37] paper it's a being he's a being and he
[1:08:41] led his children from from from Genesis
[1:08:44] all the way down out of Egypt into the
[1:08:47] Promised Land he was one who spoke to
[1:08:49] Moses his one who spoke to David is one
[1:08:51] who spoke to all the prophets down
[1:08:52] through that was the word and it became
[1:08:55] manifested in them hallelujah and then
[1:08:58] now and then the fullness of the Godhead
[1:09:00] bodily
[1:09:01] I mean twelve and the man Christ Jesus
[1:09:03] here comes God's lamb now we're going to
[1:09:05] get to the Shepherd's because history
[1:09:07] repeats itself but he is his word so now
[1:09:11] where does God place has provided place
[1:09:14] of worship is in his Living Word for the
[1:09:16] day I mean it's not in tradition I me
[1:09:19] remember this Bible I trust you don't
[1:09:22] think this is just God's Word out of
[1:09:24] tradition or out of culture but God has
[1:09:27] revealed it to you this is me in print
[1:09:29] form I mean you could have the
[1:09:31] revelation this is you in print form
[1:09:32] Lord God this is not someone's man's
[1:09:34] idea and someone translated it this way
[1:09:36] this way in that way but this is God and
[1:09:39] printful hallelujah so it's got to go
[1:09:41] more than just from tradition but now he
[1:09:45] is his word now how do you get into this
[1:09:47] GaAs provide a place of worship is it by
[1:09:50] joining a church now it's not by joining
[1:09:51] a church as it by joining a denomination
[1:09:54] is not by joining a denomination we are
[1:09:56] told in the scripture in first
[1:09:58] Corinthians twelve by one spirit you're
[1:10:01] baptized into God's chosen place of
[1:10:03] worship by one spirit you're baptized
[1:10:05] into one body I mean because he only
[1:10:08] meets the people under the shed blood he
[1:10:10] doesn't meet you anywhere else he says
[1:10:12] don't sacrifice don't bring your
[1:10:14] sacrifice to any other gate I meant
[1:10:17] bring it to the place I have chosen
[1:10:19] lelou you and you are the living
[1:10:21] sacrifice you're going to present
[1:10:22] yourself as a living sacrifice not a you
[1:10:26] know I trust you not a Christian out of
[1:10:28] convenience you know I was praying I say
[1:10:31] Lord I was praying this morning Lord
[1:10:33] you're not an errand boy you're not a
[1:10:36] mascot you're not some some go do this
[1:10:39] for me go to this mean if you do this
[1:10:41] for me I'll serve you if you don't well
[1:10:42] I'll put you on the Shelf a little but
[1:10:44] you're not a god of convenience he is
[1:10:46] the Lord God Almighty I mean he's the
[1:10:49] creator of heavens and earth I mean he's
[1:10:51] the head of the body and we are the body
[1:10:53] and the body subject to the head I mean
[1:10:55] it's going to be a your the message of
[1:10:58] the Shepherd's was God has United
[1:11:00] himself with men I mean because God
[1:11:02] became man halia deity and humanity
[1:11:05] became one and that was the message he's
[1:11:08] been born upon the earth hallelujah he's
[1:11:11] became flesh I mean there's have been a
[1:11:13] uniting time between God and men
[1:11:15] hallelujah and it's the same thing today
[1:11:18] friends Allu yeah it's the same thing
[1:11:21] today God it's the same message today
[1:11:24] there's a uniting time going on but you
[1:11:27] got to find out where he is in his in
[1:11:29] his word he's not in where we think man
[1:11:31] man builds all the big cathedrals and
[1:11:33] different structures and they have their
[1:11:34] beautiful music and sound and lights and
[1:11:37] whatever more oh is that where goddess I
[1:11:40] say not God is in his word God is in his
[1:11:46] word first and if that word is in you
[1:11:48] there that means God it is in you but
[1:11:50] the word has said it's a living word
[1:11:52] it's not just remembering things in here
[1:11:54] it's got to anchor down into here it's
[1:11:56] going to be quickened down into here Amy
[1:11:58] because of us quickened down into here
[1:11:59] nothing can move you nothing can shake
[1:12:01] you it's not the opinion of your family
[1:12:03] or your culture or were you raised it's
[1:12:06] now I'm going to stand on this because
[1:12:08] there's eternal life in this word
[1:12:10] hallelujah so God's place of worship is
[1:12:15] in his manifested word for the day
[1:12:17] because that's where Jesus is he's not a
[1:12:20] God of tradition I don't serve God out
[1:12:22] of tradition I don't serve him out of
[1:12:25] culture I serve him because he he he
[1:12:28] called me he drew himself to me I
[1:12:30] surrendered
[1:12:33] to me to him rather amen I fully
[1:12:36] surrendered he changed me he became real
[1:12:39] to me I mean I trust when you look at
[1:12:41] the Scriptures he then God spoke to
[1:12:42] Abraham you chapelle say he spoken to me
[1:12:44] too maybe not in the death maybe not in
[1:12:47] the same way but it's word became a
[1:12:49] living reality maybe he said leave leave
[1:12:52] this old life leave this old world I'll
[1:12:55] take you to another place I'll take you
[1:12:57] to another land hallelujah and you may
[1:12:59] be still living in the same house you
[1:13:01] may live and be doing the same job but
[1:13:03] you've left it lifts your old lives and
[1:13:06] your old way of doing things I've heard
[1:13:08] your voice
[1:13:09] hallelujah you know it's just like the
[1:13:11] wise men they saw his star in the east
[1:13:13] and they came to worship Him I made a
[1:13:16] star as a messenger and they followed
[1:13:18] that messenger to wake the Christ was
[1:13:20] hallelujah and a real messenger of God
[1:13:23] will point you to where he is in this
[1:13:24] day not just back in history but where
[1:13:26] he is in this day a neighbor ham lifts
[1:13:28] and he follow God and he went to his
[1:13:31] inheritance hallelujah I trust is the
[1:13:33] same with you remember Christmas is
[1:13:36] about gifts the world has has made it
[1:13:39] about gifts now God has given a real
[1:13:41] gift it doesn't it doesn't wear out it
[1:13:44] doesn't have a warranty like we would
[1:13:46] think of warranties if it breaks you
[1:13:47] know you know there was a brother at
[1:13:49] home Canada and he made this heat he
[1:13:54] invented a a system like a so what you
[1:13:58] can do is it's like a trailer system and
[1:14:01] it goes on top of your ute and and you
[1:14:04] push a button and in and then your boat
[1:14:06] just goes from the you to whatever into
[1:14:08] the water and back again just just just
[1:14:09] one man can load and unload a boat and
[1:14:12] he's getting the pots made in China and
[1:14:15] they ask him how long do you want the
[1:14:17] warranty to go forth this is not our
[1:14:21] kind of God hey yo yo the houseand you
[1:14:25] want a one year or three years hey you
[1:14:26] know how long do you want this thing to
[1:14:28] work for how God isn't like that doesn't
[1:14:32] have that kind of warranty I mean it's
[1:14:34] it's it's you regained it to the day of
[1:14:36] your redemption the redemption of this
[1:14:38] body hallelujah
[1:14:40] I mean I'm glad we don't have that kind
[1:14:42] of warranty
[1:14:45] amen so now he said he'd put his name
[1:14:47] remember Jesus spoke to the woman at the
[1:14:50] well and they begin to talk yo she said
[1:14:52] Jacob Douglas well and this happened and
[1:14:54] our Father say ship worship Jerusalem
[1:14:56] and Jerusalem and all these different
[1:14:58] things he says no it's coming a change
[1:15:01] it's coming a change there now he says
[1:15:06] but the hour cometh and John 4:23 the
[1:15:09] hour cometh and now is when the true
[1:15:11] worshipers shall worship the father in
[1:15:13] spirit and truth for the father seeketh
[1:15:17] such to worship Him he's seeking such to
[1:15:19] worship Him in spirit and in truth God
[1:15:21] is a spirit and they that worship Him
[1:15:23] must worship Him in spirit and in truth
[1:15:26] that that's a requirement you must
[1:15:29] worship Him in spirit and in truth and
[1:15:31] ever the truth is not just a collection
[1:15:33] of man's ideas that have come together
[1:15:35] like it was with the scribes and the
[1:15:38] Pharisees and the Herodians that a
[1:15:39] collection of man's thinking oh this is
[1:15:41] how it's going to happen and this is how
[1:15:43] it's going to be and they and they would
[1:15:44] no doubt say that's the truth but it
[1:15:47] wasn't the truth that was man's ideas
[1:15:49] thinking it was the truth the truth is
[1:15:51] where God says this is my word I've come
[1:15:55] to back up my word and prove that this
[1:15:56] is so and it's God declaring this is
[1:15:59] truth hallelujah not just not just
[1:16:02] someone's idea I mean it's like I think
[1:16:05] brother he'd spoke on Wednesday about
[1:16:06] brother Browns preaching on the Spirit
[1:16:09] of Truth he and he relates all these
[1:16:11] hunting testimonies and different things
[1:16:13] and he comes down to the end of that
[1:16:14] service he says now he's here the Spirit
[1:16:18] of Truth is here because to call people
[1:16:20] out just like Jesus ministry the first
[1:16:22] time call people out say this is what's
[1:16:24] wrong with it missus while you're
[1:16:25] praying for any and so what does God
[1:16:27] doing he's saying what this man just
[1:16:28] said is the truth and I've come to back
[1:16:31] it up and many times it's more than just
[1:16:34] hunting testimonies it was the word
[1:16:36] coming I mean the word became open it
[1:16:38] was preached to us and God comes in
[1:16:40] behind and say this is truth this is the
[1:16:42] truth this is my truth that's why I'm
[1:16:44] backing it up
[1:16:46] Alleluia so God has placed his name and
[1:16:49] his son and that's where you have to get
[1:16:53] into him
[1:16:54] that is God's provided place of worship
[1:16:57] hallelujah and we know by one spirit
[1:17:00] we're baptized into that one body and
[1:17:02] Peter Peter had the keys to get into
[1:17:05] that provided place and he preaches on
[1:17:07] the day of Pentecost says men and
[1:17:09] brethren what shall we do to be saved
[1:17:11] this is the people's response because he
[1:17:13] just says you've crucified the very
[1:17:14] Messiah that you believed would come and
[1:17:17] he says repent and be baptized every one
[1:17:19] of you in the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:17:21] Christ for the remission of sin amen and
[1:17:24] and you shall receive the gift of the
[1:17:27] Holy Ghost for the promises unto you and
[1:17:29] to your children as many as far yeah and
[1:17:31] those that are far off even diverse
[1:17:34] places here we are as men as the Lord
[1:17:37] our God shall call that's how you get
[1:17:39] into God's provided way it's not our
[1:17:41] choosing well I'll do it this way this
[1:17:42] is what tradition teaches me I want to
[1:17:44] get rid of tradition let's go back to
[1:17:46] the word I mean because if we take away
[1:17:48] the tradition it's like Jesus said to
[1:17:51] the scribes and Pharisees by teaching
[1:17:53] the commandments and doctrines of men
[1:17:54] you make the Word of God of Norfolk he
[1:17:56] says in vain do you worship Me
[1:17:59] hallelujah and one of the one of the
[1:18:01] commandments as you shall not take the
[1:18:03] Lord's name in vain
[1:18:04] and many times we think that's just
[1:18:06] people swearing no to take his name in
[1:18:08] vain is to say I'm a Christian but you
[1:18:11] serve in Creed's that's what's taking
[1:18:13] that his name in vain --is amen and
[1:18:16] Jesus when he came to the earth he
[1:18:18] didn't do away with the tika moments he
[1:18:20] magnified them you read Matthew 4 and 5
[1:18:23] he says you have heard of all time you
[1:18:25] shall not commit adultery but I say unto
[1:18:27] you he that looks upon a woman to lust
[1:18:29] after has committed adultery already he
[1:18:32] said you've heard of all time thou shalt
[1:18:34] not kill
[1:18:34] but says whosoever looks on his
[1:18:36] brother's angry with him without a cause
[1:18:37] has committed murder already he
[1:18:40] magnifies it because he's a lawgiver
[1:18:42] he was the lawgiver the cab down on
[1:18:43] mount sinai he say well that's a that's
[1:18:47] a more of a grievous weight but you got
[1:18:49] to understand his grace is greater than
[1:18:51] the law I mean his mercy and grace is
[1:18:53] greater than the law hallelujah
[1:18:55] and he magnified it because he wanted
[1:18:57] the people to see you can't love these
[1:18:58] Ten Commandments you can't even keep one
[1:19:00] of them because you got to fool a nation
[1:19:02] to begin with I mean you're lost and I'm
[1:19:04] done to begin with but here I am Here I
[1:19:07] am driver shadow the law
[1:19:09] change your nature put myself on you I
[1:19:11] mean that I will live my word out of you
[1:19:13] hallelujah
[1:19:15] that's God's Christmas gift that's God's
[1:19:18] Christmas gift I'll change you I mean
[1:19:20] from a fallen creature I mean for a
[1:19:23] wretched loss undone I mean under the
[1:19:25] slavery of Satan I'll break that yolk
[1:19:27] I'll change your nature that when you
[1:19:30] cannot overcome I will overcome I will
[1:19:33] come into your flesh and overcome for
[1:19:35] you
[1:19:36] that's a good gift I think Allu you
[1:19:39] glory to God now he say why are you
[1:19:46] talking about why'd you read about
[1:19:47] shepherds God doesn't change it's
[1:19:51] amazing it astounds me you know we just
[1:19:53] read it oh yes the Shepherd's by night
[1:19:56] and you know we don't even think man
[1:19:58] doesn't change man doesn't change God
[1:20:03] doesn't change either the same people
[1:20:05] that were back there the same spirits
[1:20:07] that were back there as upon the people
[1:20:09] today and we see God was showing himself
[1:20:13] God was showing himself by where he was
[1:20:17] born and he was showing himself to the
[1:20:20] kind of people who would follow him look
[1:20:26] at who God revealed himself to here they
[1:20:29] were the most holy place the most holy
[1:20:31] country in the world you could say
[1:20:32] there's Jerusalem with the fine temple
[1:20:34] there's different places but God
[1:20:38] bypasses all those things he bypasses
[1:20:41] the high priest he he he bypasses the
[1:20:44] Bible schools he bypasses the Sanhedrin
[1:20:47] he bypasses all those places
[1:20:49] he doesn't even consult them he doesn't
[1:20:52] even tell them and he comes to some
[1:20:55] Shepherds some Shepherds on a field
[1:20:57] outside of Bethlehem and here these
[1:21:00] Shepherds are now do you think K if it
[1:21:04] says man is proud and pride keeps a lot
[1:21:07] of people out of here them pride keeps a
[1:21:10] lot of people out of here them do you
[1:21:12] think cave you know I don't know who the
[1:21:13] high priest was when Jesus was born but
[1:21:15] this yeah do you think the high priest
[1:21:17] would come into a stinking manger a
[1:21:20] manger in those days was just like a
[1:21:23] it wasn't even a nice like a nice place
[1:21:25] that we know you see a manger scene it's
[1:21:27] just like a cave on the side of a hill
[1:21:29] do you think the high priests in all his
[1:21:31] great robes stinking animals do you
[1:21:40] think he would go to that kind of place
[1:21:42] he wouldn't be identified they would not
[1:21:44] be identified with that kind of kind of
[1:21:47] place being here was God God was birthed
[1:21:50] in this place he was God's lamb he had
[1:21:52] to be born in a stable
[1:21:53] he couldn't be born in a palace do you
[1:21:57] think they would lower themselves they
[1:21:59] would hold their nose they wouldn't go
[1:22:01] in do you think about it they wouldn't
[1:22:05] be identified they were not willing to
[1:22:08] be identified with him and God knew they
[1:22:10] wouldn't be identified so he bypassed
[1:22:13] all of them they couldn't receive the
[1:22:14] message but those humble shepherds
[1:22:17] shepherds know about sheep being born
[1:22:19] shippers know and shepherds in those
[1:22:21] days are not like shepherds you see in
[1:22:23] this country with dogs and whistles and
[1:22:25] whatever more they call this sheep by
[1:22:27] name they have a relationship with their
[1:22:29] sheep their sheep know them and they
[1:22:32] know the Sheep know them and the
[1:22:34] Shepherd knows the Sheep then you they
[1:22:37] knew what it was like to see a sheep be
[1:22:40] born and there knew where sheep would be
[1:22:43] born and God was showing this is the
[1:22:46] kind of people we're 2,000 years down
[1:22:48] the road friends he's come once he's
[1:22:51] coming again we're gonna meet him in the
[1:22:54] air but he's already seen his word he's
[1:22:56] revealed himself in his fullness in the
[1:22:58] same time amen he's here upon the earth
[1:23:01] messiahs present hallelujah but you see
[1:23:04] the people who would be identified with
[1:23:07] such a one were illiterate I could say
[1:23:10] Shepherds upon the field that was the
[1:23:14] category of person that would that would
[1:23:16] go now how comfortable they would have
[1:23:21] been in that manger how comfortable I've
[1:23:25] been in a place of this many times I
[1:23:27] know how they have ranged I know what a
[1:23:30] manger as' you know high priests and
[1:23:33] things I'd say what's a manger what do
[1:23:35] you go get the servant
[1:23:36] sindermann that I'm not going in there
[1:23:37] it would be humiliating their pride
[1:23:40] would be you know their their their
[1:23:42] persona would be damaged you see the
[1:23:45] high priest going into they've made you
[1:23:47] can he just send a servant that's you're
[1:23:50] proud you understand what I'm saying
[1:23:51] that's too proud to go into that card
[1:23:53] place but the ship would say this is
[1:23:55] exactly this is I'm used to these kind
[1:23:58] of conditions I'm used to the smell I'm
[1:24:00] used to this animal life around me yeah
[1:24:03] and they went and they found the Messiah
[1:24:07] and they after they went they declared
[1:24:10] messiahs upon the earth now what a
[1:24:13] strange message that would have been if
[1:24:14] they ran into the synagogue and they
[1:24:16] begin to declare messiahs here and
[1:24:19] angels little yo visited us we had a
[1:24:22] whole heavenly hosts sing the First Noel
[1:24:24] was sang by heavenly beings to us and
[1:24:26] messiahs upon the earth and we heard
[1:24:29] what the angel told us and we found him
[1:24:31] he'd become manifested in flesh you
[1:24:33] think I think the synagogue were think
[1:24:35] that's a bit strange because it didn't
[1:24:37] come their way I want you to think about
[1:24:39] this because many times God never comes
[1:24:42] the way we think he should
[1:24:43] he never manifests the way we think he
[1:24:46] should hallelujah and so we have to lay
[1:24:50] aside our thinking and we have to come
[1:24:54] with his thinking now how could they and
[1:24:59] notice a shepherd knows the nature and
[1:25:02] character of a sheep and they are
[1:25:03] identified with their sheep now our
[1:25:06] natures have to be changed to match his
[1:25:09] nature if the high priest surrender
[1:25:12] themselves and became like shepherds
[1:25:14] they would have heard the message and
[1:25:15] they would have seen where he was born
[1:25:17] but the nature but a proud arrogant
[1:25:19] nature is not like a Shepherds nature of
[1:25:21] sheep's nature and so now our nature has
[1:25:24] to be changed to match his who wants
[1:25:28] eternal life you can't just take it how
[1:25:31] you want it you got to come his way and
[1:25:33] become like him there's a reason that
[1:25:36] that God the great creator of heavens
[1:25:39] and earth became the lost of the law was
[1:25:42] born in a in a stinking manger I mean
[1:25:45] because God has trying to tell us now
[1:25:46] you've got to just consider yourself
[1:25:48] you're just a manger
[1:25:49] and sister cherish sang let this let
[1:25:52] this manger let it be bought in the
[1:25:54] manger of my heart
[1:25:55] Amen all we are we think we're so
[1:25:57] wonderful and we spent so much on these
[1:25:59] bodies and everything but at the end of
[1:26:01] the day all we are as a manger but you
[1:26:03] got to you got to consider yourself as
[1:26:05] all I am oh god be born in me he's
[1:26:08] looking for hearts to manifest himself
[1:26:10] through he's searching the earth where
[1:26:12] could I find a channel where could I
[1:26:14] find a yielded vessel to manifest my
[1:26:17] word that's what he's looking for
[1:26:20] hallelujah amen and then he came down to
[1:26:23] Jordan the Lamb of God came down to
[1:26:24] Jordan and then John points them out and
[1:26:28] you see the nature and then God the
[1:26:30] spirit of God descended upon him like a
[1:26:31] dove know the nature of a dove and the
[1:26:34] lamb are very similar you go study them
[1:26:36] they're very similar now a lamb and a
[1:26:40] dove can have fellowship because they've
[1:26:41] got the same nature birds of a feather
[1:26:43] flock together the saying goes but if
[1:26:46] one was a wolf
[1:26:47] do you think if do you think John would
[1:26:50] say here comes the wolf of God to take
[1:26:52] away the sin of the world do you think
[1:26:53] God would show himself as a dove coming
[1:26:55] down a dove can't rest upon a wolf they
[1:26:58] don't have the same kind of nature but a
[1:27:00] dove can rest upon a lamb and a dove can
[1:27:04] lead a lamb hallelujah and this is how
[1:27:07] we've got to be we got it we can't have
[1:27:09] our wolf nature that we're born with I
[1:27:11] mean we've got to want to get rid of it
[1:27:13] and Lourdes your God has released a
[1:27:16] power to change our nature
[1:27:18] amen to this human nature has done away
[1:27:21] with I mean that we receive his nature
[1:27:23] because who wants him to abide he abides
[1:27:27] he abides hallelujah he abides with me
[1:27:30] it's not just a nice song that's a
[1:27:32] reality
[1:27:33] God is not a bunch of thoughts he's a
[1:27:35] person amen and you got to meet that
[1:27:37] person hallelujah
[1:27:39] and so now they could not receive in
[1:27:43] order to receive the real Lamb of God
[1:27:46] you have to have his nature and God has
[1:27:50] to change your nature to match his
[1:27:53] nature and then he can come and dwell in
[1:27:56] you because we want to be in his
[1:27:57] provider place of worship
[1:28:00] Alleluia we are likened to sheep
[1:28:03] a sheep forfeits their rights all they
[1:28:06] do is bear wolf
[1:28:07] they let around their picked up their
[1:28:09] Sean you know I think I've seen it a few
[1:28:11] times when I was young we used to do
[1:28:13] docking at my friend's farm

[1:28:18] they're not they don't struggle all that
[1:28:20] much when they know you've got them by a
[1:28:21] good hold they just give up you take
[1:28:24] them to the offense and the someone else
[1:28:26] cuts off their tail and does whatever
[1:28:27] more you know and you put them back down
[1:28:29] but that's how we've got to be we don't
[1:28:32] want to kick like a goat against his
[1:28:35] word we don't want to kick like a goat
[1:28:37] goat against the world say I'm a lamb I
[1:28:39] for food oh oh but but I've I've rights
[1:28:42] yes but if you're a Christian you give
[1:28:44] up your rights I mean because he's a
[1:28:46] head remember this is not Christianity

[1:32:57] day oh don't go to the synagogue and if
[1:33:00] you go and hear Jesus or people saying
[1:33:03] don't go to his meetings if you go to
[1:33:04] his meetings you'll be cast out you have
[1:33:06] no fellowship anymore he didn't let

[1:33:12] know you're the Messiah we know you're
[1:33:14] coming into power hallelujah and he just
[1:33:18] walked the road irrespective he said for

[1:33:44] going to have a bride I'm going to have
[1:33:45] people without spot or wrinkle washed in
[1:33:47] the blood and Paul would say in
[1:33:50] Ephesians it's the mystery husband and
[1:33:52] wife become one flesh as great as the
[1:33:55] mystery of Christ in His Church they
[1:33:57] become one they're not two separate

[1:38:17] being carried by a woman he's the one
[1:38:20] that can really help the sudden keeper
