you pass the woman with the blood conditions she didn't let you pass hallelujah zacchaeus and bartimaeus they didn't let you pass oh god we're not gonna let you pass tonight lord come into our ship hallelujah oh god come lord and bring change where change is needed in jesus name we commit the service to you lord we love you and appreciate you in the name of jesus christ amen hallelujah amen hallelujah well the presence of the lord is definitely here amen amen glory to god thank you musicians we can uh i won't put that there where's that hook gone hallelujah um who knows can someone please josh can you just stick that clip back on we're all uh getting tangled up here amen who's ready to worship jesus hallelujah amen while you're standing let's turn in our bibles to mark chapter six and it's an honor as always and a privilege to be standing here uh before the purchase of the blood of jesus giving um honor to brother ben pastor and thanking ben for the opportunity and the confidence amen and also we have a little celebration for tomorrow his name is jono hey man how are you going to be jono 12 am happy birthday bro amen hallelujah amen well let's just read amen i want to speak i just you know um want to continue on that series we begin and this is part two of that two tree series and it's called the revelation of the tree of life at the darkest hour amen and so i just want to read now from mark chapter six from verses 45 to 52 and the context of this reading is going see we want to just put sign some light on what it means when we go off on an intellectual whim or without jesus and our own idea our ambition how fitting the song was you know we want to surrender those things to the lord and and lay it all down because we can end up where the disciples ended up on the ship when they went without jesus amen so when you go without jesus it may be all right for a little while but you wait trouble is on the way absolutely every time no matter what you can't escape it travel is on the way amen and the the reality of that is when in context with this particular series is you begin eating from the tree of knowledge of good and evil and you leave off the tree of life amen and you put your faith in your own ambitions and intellectualism and it will take you into trouble it may take a while but it will get there amen hallelujah so let's just read mark 6 45 to 52 and it says and straightway he constrained his disciples to get into the ship and to go to the other side before unto bethsaida amen while he sent away the people and i just want you to pay significant attention particular attention to these verses because every word and line in this story in this uh transcript of history has got meaning very very personal meaning so and when he had sent them away he departed into a mountain to pray and when even evening was come the ship was in the midst of the sea and he alone on the land all right so they ventured off without him hallelujah and he saw them toiling in and rowing see he he he sees don't worry he sees for the wind was contrary unto them and about the fourth watch of the night the darkest hour he came cometh unto them walking upon the sea and would have passed by them all right that's okay we can strain him tonight okay hallelujah you say come lord jesus hallelujah amen you he's looking you know might you might not speak it with your lips but with your heart he's he can feel that desire in your life come lord jesus amen hallelujah let me read so you can sit down and enjoy the comfort of your seats while i stand i like that brother and bob thank you very much amen okay so and the fourth watch passed by them but when they saw him walking upon the sea they supposed it had been a spirit and cried out my how many times we've seen that for they all saw him and were troubled and immediately i love that immediately he talked with them hallelujah and said unto them be of good chair it is i be not afraid and he went up unto them into the ship and the wind ceased and they were so amazed in themselves beyond measure i like that and wondered hallelujah and in the in matthew it says and they worshipped him so you can see now oh hold on let me just read this for they considered not the miracle of the loaves for their heart was hardened amen may the lord add his blessing to the reading of his word you may be seated hallelujah amen hallelujah see they had temporarily lost the vision of where they came from they went through some trials they went through a hardship and in that and getting immersed in that with their focus off the very source of their strength they lost their vision they became hardened in their heart their heart was unmalleable in that condition and therefore they lost their vision of what had just happened you see they just come from a mighty revival they had come from a revival where the son of man was creating bread and fish and feeding thousands of people a miracle of epic proportions amen yeah hallelujah they had temporary lost their vision but god i love this because it never ends like that it never ends you just sitting in a dark place sometimes we end up in a place where we lose our vision sometimes we end up in a situation where we cannot see the wood for the trees and we go through things in life and trials may beat us down until we can't see but god rich in mercy will not let you remain in that condition hallelujah whether it's you whether it's a church whether it's an age whether it's a family whether it's a dispensation whatever it may be the lord will not leave his people sitting in darkness great light will come to the people to change the situation amen hallelujah i'll make you guys a deal if you paul i will preach amen i want you to apply your faith every one of you and pull amen and then you'll get what you need is everyone hungry tonight does everyone need a blessing tonight amen i encourage you now just pull amen i encourage you to say lord whatever that need is in your life you make it known to him i want you to touch the hem of his garment hallelujah because you see the revival that these people came into they went from a revival they went from a mighty revival and then they ventured for a while into the dark of the night in their own strength in their own ability and they were without jesus and all the trouble began but you see jesus would then come and he would go from where he was at and he would he would go and he would begin to enact redemption he would go and he would say you know what these people are getting into a dark condition they might be getting into a dark place in their lives they might be going through the hardest trial the sea the demons of the sea would swear that they would drown these people but you see now jesus saw it and jesus sees what you're going through jesus sees the struggles that you go through in your life has anyone been delivered in this place hallelujah so then you are in the story tonight amen we're just establishing a few little ground roots here hallelujah the churches were constantly struggling now on a church level over the last 2000 years with intellectual giants you see the human being is always wanting to revert to his mind it's a natural what i don't even know what the word is aversion no that's the opposite to that but it's like an inclination to go into that intellectual realm and begin to do it in your own strength but christianity is not based on our intellect christianity is not based on our ability christianity is entirely based on rest entirely and utterly and completely based on rest so that he can operate hallelujah so that he can express his attributes so that he can say i am the savior i'm the redeemer i'm the one that wants to work in your life so that you can love me more he wants you to love him more so he wants you to see that side of him so rest little bride rest amen see the churches though and us in ourselves personal and on a church level con struggled for many years with intellectual giants waves tossing them under the vice of science and educated faith you see many times if you see over the church history they would rise up there would be a revival and god would move in them and then within a couple of generations it was intellectual again within a couple of generations because they were scared of losing what they had or what their founder had and they begin to intellectualize it and they begin to write books around it and they begin a church government around it and then they start the whole conduct order and doctrine and it make a denomination and then it goes to seed then it's no longer able to reproduce until you see now this church not this church but the the age they came and they went they adventured you know there was jesus and he was doing these great things and and and and the church just begin to get go united says in ephesians that they were aimed at but they relaxed and and they they had the deeds of the nicolaitans and they begin to go down and and they begin to walk without him in general there was always a witness but there was and as a general move it began to go down and they begin to venture into the sea without him hallelujah over the last 2000 years it got worse and worse and worse until one day hallelujah one day he came amen and he said be not afraid it is i and he spoke it through a little kentucky and amen he came and he revealed himself and said be not afraid of his eye i'm going to reveal myself to you in a full measure again amen you're going to have a nice contact with me more than more than ever before amen because i'm going to give you something that's going to make you live forever i'm going to let you eat of something that you will never die amen the very essence of what adam and eve walked away from when they left the garden of eden is what is being given back to the church hallelujah amen and so it says here a message came at the darkest hour of laodicea saying be not afraid it is i however the believers of this very message have also battled against similar patterns so here we have now i'm just going to lay like a few so that you can know with the context of where we're going and so you have now god raises up a mighty prophet and he takes the people out of all of the false teachings and consolidates everything together so that we have a true message and and and reveals the truth and the conduct and everything and begins to take the people out of denominational thinking out of the roman catholic tiebacks all of those doctrines and everything that tied the people back into rome tied those churches back to roman teaching and he would take the people he would consolidate truth again and he would begin to shine that light on the people and the people would gather around this prophet the seventh angel amen and and they would begin to gather and they would begin to walk with him and god would say to this prophet william branham now turn northward and take my people out of the wilderness take them out of this pentecostal denominational wilderness take them out of what this man's age and take them into the bright age take them out and take them into the promised land take them from all this thinking of man and bring them in to the field of promise bring them to the true baptism of the holy ghost amen so under luther martin luther you have justification the start of the reformation the people were freed and released from the slavery of the superstitions of rome and then under john wesley later on they begin to clean up the people's lives under sanctification amen and so he sanctified the church and then later on he began to reveal the gifts again under the pentecostal outpouring of 1904 around that age and allowed to see an age begin and he began to pour out a spirit upon them to what to reveal the gifts of the spirit and so then you have justification sanctification and the baptism of the holy ghost those three ingredients restored to the church and then he sends a messenger elijah the prophet to bring those things together to reveal the holy ghost himself take the people out of the wilderness out of the denominational darkness out of egyptian slave mentality you see when they came out of egypt they came out of rome they still had roman thinking do you know that the church denomination nominal still had roman thinking they were still very much chained down to a roman way of life and they started that slave mentality but for many years they were hit by that task master and their teachers were hit by that slave master of rome and those different doctrines and those different teachings and that way that wasn't the true way but a prophet was given to bring us out of that to bring the church out of that and so what happened was he brought them out amen hallelujah he obeyed the heavenly vision he was not disobedient to the heavenly vision he stood up against councils and councils of great ministers all international bodies and none of them could refute it none of them could stand up with him and even say one word against it they couldn't and he challenged them and you can hear it on the tapes he actually in those meetings and he did not bat down and god proved his word for this was not done in the back room this was like as lightning goes from the east to the west over the whole earth as a witness that god was taking his people into a higher revelation of himself to take luther's message of truth wesley's message of truth the the restoration of the holy ghost baptism and all of the gifts of the spirit and the supernatural and consolidate it and reveal the true holy ghost himself and so when the church came over jordan came into a death to all those things through jordan came into the promised land lo and behold who comes down but the mighty angel himself the captain of the lord's host comes down with a sword in his hand who knows the story does everyone know the story your children do you know the story does everyone know are you with me i need a drink i'm very dry he comes down into the promised land comes down to reveal i've come to take over amen now a great change takes place a dispensational change begins to shift what is it it's the revelation of the holy ghost himself it's the fullness of god revealed amen and we read in revelation chapter 10 how a mighty angel would come down in the seventh church age and he would come down with what in his hand does anyone know what he had in his hand rebecca well yes he did have a sword in his hand the captain did in the old testament but what did the mighty angel have in his hand in 1963 when he came down uh noel a bible he had an open book in his hand the sword of the spirit was open hallelujah and that's the great difference saints that when he came down in this age he revealing the full inheritance of everything that's been lost since adam that's what the baptism of the holy ghost gives you hallelujah that's what this message has brought us out to receive amen is everyone warm yeah good i'm very warm it's so hot is it summer mate okay see and so but it doesn't stop there because you see the same cycle the same intellectual battle the same nicolaitan spirits that would come upon the church in the beginning of the church ages to make them cold formal intellectual and powerless as the same spirits that would come on people that would follow this message you know that none of us are exempt from that just because you follow the message it doesn't mean that you ain't going to get attacked by those same spirits that's why you have to discern them and that's why tonight i'm here to talk to you about these things so that you can discern these spirits so that you when they try to come on you hey that devil ain't got nothing he won't be able to touch you because you've got discernment because you've been made aware of these things because you see what they are trying to do to you on an individual level is bring you into an intellectual condition to take you to try and do it yourself solve your own problems you know entertain yourself you see we have a big problem as a human and that problem we'll call it a problem for the sake of this as you need entertainment you need joy right we need joy everyone wants to be happy right does anyone in here not want to be happy you can put your hand up anyone does anyone not want to be happy does anyone in here not want to have joy no one everyone wants to have joy right everyone wants to have peace amen so therefore that is the that's a question to humanity and so now the intellectual side of it the feasting from the tree of knowledge the tree of knowledge has got a lot of things that you can do to be happy you know that of good and evil use a lot of good things in the tree of knowledge of good and evil that can give you happiness they can give you joy but you know what there's a lot better things in the tree of life amen that's why in this end time the lord's come to take you completely from the need for joy out of those other things hallelujah and so you can see now how we fight these same spirits these same spirits are going to come against us to try and cause us to solve these problems the problem of having comfort the problem of having money that's a big problem right that's a big problem that's why god said you're the royal seat of abraham and you can live above that you can be the head and not the tail you don't have to be subservient to the economy whether it goes down whether it goes up you don't have to worry you don't have the fear right that problem solved now god says at his right hand as the fullness of joy and there are pleasures forever more does everyone know that psalm 16 there are pleasures forever more and at his right hand there is the fullness of joy amen so there is joy unspeakable and full of glory just from him so he solved that problem but you see when we begin to venture into our own intellectual understanding and ability we begin to venture away now we're in a position where we are vulnerable to anything and so we don't want to be in that position now as people believers of the message after the prophet came and he he took the people into the land and the mighty angel came down with the open book and he began to preach the opening of the seven seals and reveal the inheritance from dan to beersheba the whole promised land all the inheritance and begin to speak and you know within there is your inheritance and you begin to speak the inheritance to the people that would come out under this message and establish the boundaries and establish the borders and begin to to declare it all out for us right you're with me to speak it all out and give it to the people and then lo and behold not many days later the prophet was taken off the scene and then the trouble then the intellectual spirits begin to come in and begin to cause the people just like it did to the jewish people they had a mighty messenger joshua gave them all the land the captain came down and says i'm gonna fight your battles go and take it all and they could have courage and be courageous and follow and turn not to the left or to the right and follow the message of joshua and take all the land take the land take your inheritance all of it from all of jerusalem judah take it benjamin take it right dan take your land did they take it some but what happened it says and and judges now judges one two three around that time it says now the the elders that passed away after joshua then the people to begin to not call on the name of the lord anymore you know they went now they were like well we've got all this land now we've got like this great message and we've got this the great teaching we've got the great doctrines we're the people of the book right oh my so then they begin to venture into their own intellectual ability many many of them they went into their own ways and they they they compromised they begin to make friends with the inhabitants of the land and they begin to marry their wives and and and cross over and god was not happy why because they ventured without the lord they begin to do it in their own ability you know and this is something that we have to be very aware of just because we have a message it doesn't mean that we're not uh you know we that we are completely vulnerable from these same spirits so i just want to encourage you now we're going to get there amen amen we're going to get there hallelujah amen but remember it went to the same pattern the people in this message the the message you could say messaged them now i'm not talking about that true seed that experience and had to battle this and thought through it and with stalwart and they began they had faith right through it your samsons your roots you know they went right through that time of judges they went right through and it was it was they had a glorious time even though all this destruction and darkness was right around them and sometimes they got so far down they just got pushed down but that faith of abraham rose up in men like shamga in the time of judges when benjamin was killing this one and this one was slaying that one and that tribe nearly wiped out benjamin and they cut people up and all those things happened in the message you know that and yet there was sand guards and there was roofs and there was boazers that took the faith hallelujah that took the land that was claiming their inheritance and there's a people throughout the time of this message in the last 40 50 years that it's been since the seals open since the word came forth since the tree of life was revealed to the people since then there's been a people with a true faith there's been a people that have stood fast there's been a people like shamgar that's fought against all the demon powers that's taken land that's taken this message and translated into every language faithful stalwart soldiers right through it and yet there's all these false things and legalism and intellectualism and and this one going that way and this one going that way this church dying this pastor falling away this one doing that that one doing that these ones all the way in the millennium are gone and then you have a new earth probably already these ones still in the old testament why because of intellectual they ventured after a great revival of bread and fish when there was creation brother brown said what did he do to those atoms you know how he he created cooked fish and cooked bread he just released those atoms what you see they they there was a great revival and and once that revival and then they went out into the sea and they were all right you know it was all good for a while until they got into the dark of the night amen you don't want to ever ever venture without christ don't ever venture without him because the sea is dark the sea is rough amen and if you do it's not the end hallelujah because he will come revelation 2 7 that says here this was meant to be an opening scripture but it didn't quite get that but um the first um so it says revelation 27 it says he that has an ear let him hear what the spirit sayeth unto the churches to him that overcometh will i give to eat of the tree of life which is in the midst of the paradise of god hallelujah you see and through all the ages of the churches they did eat of it in in part they they got a portion of it because they will be raised up and they will live forever but now in this age that tree is being materialized into this dimension to cause these bodies to never die exactly the thing that adam was not allowed to touch that's what that open book comes to reveal right that's what the baptism of the holy ghost in the end time with the open book you know it's not a close book it's not just a partial revelation of him if you receive the baptism of the holy ghost revelation 10 1 to 6 7 1-6 happens in your life that happens to you and you hear a voice from heaven like john heard go and take the book out of the hands of him that stands upon the sea and upon the earth you go and take the book is anyone hungry here has anyone heard that voice tonight have you heard him say to you go and take that book hallelujah you're invited if you haven't you just did go and take the book go and eat it hallelujah you know now there is a we you what you don't want to do and i believe i'm not talking but i'll just say this is you don't want to say oh that stuff's just too deep we don't want to go into those things it's just too messaging don't ever do that you hunger you call on the name of the lord with all your heart and say lord i want to know i want to experience that book open because in that is your identity in that is your inheritance hallelujah the prophet you know because you see now that coming of of the fullness of the holy ghost himself comes down into your heart that is the beginning of the lord's coming right the coming of the lord begins in your heart this is significant it's not just another anointing you're not just justified now you're not just sanctified anymore you're more than that you're not just got gifts that's what these other churches have in the old other ages now that was what they got and that was the light that god was giving so they were justified sanctified and whatever they got in that that was the holy spirit to them but to you it is given to know all and to receive all the lord and so thank you lord that very thing that which i've just said is the very picture where you were found one day floating on the sea rocked around by the storms of life in your darkest hour and here he comes walking on the water he was watching you all that time from his mountain top watching you and then one day then one day someone told me of your mercy oh amen hallelujah and through those words he came and he stepped out of the bible he stepped out of history and he said here i am you know he says be not afraid be courageous because this is a very fearful time but you're not to be feared you're not to be afraid you'll to be courageous the demons that try and trouble you and try and keep you and try and push you down are everywhere and all around but be courageous because behold it is i jesus and he steps out of history out of an idea out of being just some form of religion and a person reveals himself to you hallelujah and what happens praise the lord what happens from there oh my we'll get there another revival takes place you know that they went from revival creation whatever you want to call it revival to storm to revival and that revival now we're going to just we're going to relish in that this this next revival we are relishing in it but i'm going to preach it to you hallelujah and then you're going to respond by let by praying and laying your people and your is it prayer night tonight or is it just service you're going to lay your people like what they did at the guinness eric lake i'm getting way ahead of myself but you're going to lay your people you're going to lay your needs and the needs of your people wherever they may be at whatever region they may be in whatever your need is you will touch the hem of his garment tonight so remember this promise now because what what what it is justin you know i'm just being very frank here is it's the tree of life the tree of life has been revealed in this dimension for you to eat spiritually but it will manifest in your flesh because he says i'm the vine and you're the branches and so now what if the holy ghost is holding nothing back and the book is open and all the thunders have been released and all the mysteries and everything has been opened and it's all been revealed to you and and not now i don't say you have to know everything right i'm talking about it it just comes inside you yeah it's in you whether you understand everything or not it's in you by the baptism of the holy ghost and then you yield to him and you consecrate your life and you begin to love him and i mean really love him with felio anagapo not just some love that's way up here somewhere but i mean you really fond who's fond of jesus who's good when you think of him do you get physically do you feel physical love because i believe he wants to bring you to that so you're friends then you yield and then all of a sudden you begin to become fruitful what are you a branch to that same tree now the tree of life becomes manifested in this world it's becoming flesh again so now there's seed inside your fruit that people eat amen and tonight by faith we can touch the hem of his garment and give out that seed word and fruit you know you can just we've got such authority right in the spiritual realm you know and and and you know maybe the storms of life you're busy you go through lots of things and the mind battles are strong whatever we all go through those things right you're not alone we all go through them right but you have discernment because you see authority without discernment is useless i've said that every time i think i preach but just that you cannot have there's no point in having authority if you can't discern good and evil and know that that's a demon troubling you or a demon troubling your brother that's making you upset and and you realize that it's the devil because once you discern it and you know who it is that's causing that and it ain't your brother and it ain't your sister and it ain't your friends it's the devil and that's when you begin to pray with targeted faith to destroy the enemy and make him regret ever giving you that mind battle this is war yes my lord i have to do it i'm inciting you to war and i believe the lord is inciting you to war hallelujah the bar has gone out the roof ben preached it that's in season man that's such a powerful thought that this war you don't just give you know the devil was always trying to you know when jesus came to the maniac of gadara he was trying to reason the devil was scared because you know if he gets cast out into somewhere else he can't get back so he says get me let me go into this herd of swine so they were trying to negotiate their casting out don't negotiate the devil you cast them real good you cast them back into hell don't just cast them out there cast them into hell cast them into out of darkness you see when jesus cast him he said you cast him into out of darkness there's a take it tell him where to go and don't just leave it there then you begin to wage war because that guy attacked you what are you going to respond or you're just going to let him off don't let him off you know the troubles that people are going through you know the people that may be struggling and you just say lord i'm now going to pray as a retaliation a retaliatory response because that devil's going to know he's going to know that when he attacks me he ain't gonna get no friendly warfare back he's gonna get a real war back and you see then you begin to pray for people then you begin to engage in warfare then you begin now you see now i think i was praying it but this is something the lord revealed to me because the word has come to you the word of god divides soul and spirit and joints and marrow and discerns the thoughts and intents of the heart right it's a very sharp sword that can cut through atoms the atom is the smallest thing well probably nuclear physicists will say different but for us the atom is like the smallest particle right now the sword of the spirit can cut it open you know that the sword of the spirit can split the atom and i'll tell you when jesus comes down in the mount of olives after the wedding supper after armageddon and and to finish finish off the demons and finish off the enemy comes down into jerusalem and he begins to the fire that proceeds out of his mouth dissolves the people while they stand the enemies that were attacking him and against him and those people that were destroying his kingdom and the devil's people that were fighting directly against god the fire that comes out of his mouth dissolves them while they stand as describing nuclear fire because the word of god is quick and powerful and sharper than any two-edged sword so now the word and your prayer is actually nuclear power is your prayers are nuclear power that devil ain't got nothing hallelujah he's weak he's a bluff and when he attacks you he's showing his cards you know that he's showing his cards he goes this is what i'm attacking and he's like oh is that all you've got i like the is that all you got right this is war don't let them off and do not bargain with them hallelujah don't entertain them the moment you become aware of what's going on deal with it right there don't wait till the end of the day go down into the toilet at your work go down to your office shut the door and deal with it and if it's real bad just deal with it right there smack him amen amen what happens is you begin now the law begins to teach your hands to war you need to learn and the only way to learn is to do it the only way to learn is to face him and brother brown says any person that's ever mounted to anything in god has had to face the devil head on if you're not facing the devil head on you're not really doing too much damage to his kingdom you're kind of just drifting around like a log in the ocean you know and not really got so much you know but but when you begin to engage in the war and when you see people that are struggling and you begin to pray for them and you're entering into a burden for those people as a retaliatory response but also as a general love because you love people if you want to develop your love for people more begin praying for them pray for people enter into their burden feel for them that's why i preached that sermon the week before because you need to be daring enough to love people and and open your channel of love and feel philadelphia love for people and it does hurt if you get hurt but it's worth it because then when you pray for them and when you enter into their burden you can feel it you know brother branham when he was praying for those men with the jacket uh you know he couldn't that guy didn't have clothes or shoes whatever he just had rags and brother brandon felt sorry for him he had compassion and and through that connection of love that man got healed it's like when you connect with somebody you begin to pray for them it develops faith muscles it develops love muscles hallelujah it develops this connection and they might not even know that you're doing it and yet you've got this connection with them and you love them and you begin to grow and develop hallelujah amen and you watch and rejoice your heart when you see people change and you see them having a revival and just to think maybe you had a little part to play in that revival you know and that develops your love and then when that person gets attacked it's personal ben will know all about that when he sees anyone in this congregation get under attack it's personal hey ben real personal because they're you love them and you care and you don't want them to go through those things and so the devil gets a better hiding because when you pray you break through and pray you don't just say a little prayer oh thank you lord i please pray bless us for this and that and um i just pray that you'll just heal them and no it's more there's a connection there you uh you enter into his gates with thanksgiving you enter his courts with praise and you wait until the spirit of god comes and then you pray it's different because you care there's something different there's something with more substance hallelujah amen the prophet says this and um only believe hallelujah i want to challenge you now this is a challenge for me a challenge for you hallelujah says and in time the old wheels grind slow but it grinds sure it's got to be just the way god said it was going to be no matter how unreal it seems but it's going to be that way as we talked last night one time they didn't have electricity but some man believed now we're talking about tree of knowledge and tree of life here because there's a thrust these people they want you know if they get something in them that has to bring forth a fruit to the tree of something whether it's tree of life or tree of knowledge you get this burden right and something's going to be birthed something that may be minor or major monumentous whatever it's got so these people over throughout time have had these these great burdens and and and huge things have come forth from big fruit for the different trees okay tree of knowledge and tree of life all right but some men believed there was such a thing can you imagine now you children would not even think about it and even us they didn't used to have electricity you couldn't just turn the light on yeah but there was somebody that said we can harness that thing they got a burden for the tree of knowledge hallelujah and they got such a burden that they spent their whole life are you with me their whole being was was was completely caught up caught up to make this thing to harness this lightning that they and electricity static they could see and they wanted to channel it so that it would bring forth something how much more now i challenge you right how much more the tree of life hallelujah amen there's fruit to be born hallelujah and now it's like you know make your calling and election sure you know that's one thing it says that if you diligently seek this you you won't fail or fall you know and and because it'll place you in your purpose it'll place you where god has made you for so that fruit can come forth and he will begin to reveal to you why you live why you're here what are you on this earth for can you get down and say lord i want to know i don't want to just float around or be tossed with the waves of the sea like a buoyant log i want to be anchored hallelujah says here one time they didn't have electricity but some man believed that there was such a thing and he kept working tireless hours until he discovered what it was hallelujah and the same thing by television by automobile and so forth god put all these things here for our benefit what about the tree of life now if we who are acquainted with the supernatural would just take a man where the man in his senses is limited to his senses but a man in his spirit is unlimited so now we're transferring now to a different realm the tree of knowledge can only climb so far and it breaks back that's why all these denominations go so far then they break back or the disciples they go so far and then they they're about to drown or you know your life you go so far you might just climb that tree of knowledge you might become a phd you might become a professor but if you're walking without christ you watch out it will only go so far then it will fall back denominations they went so far then they fell back because they went into an intellectual condition amen but the tree of life goes on hallelujah forever and now and now that science this is the challenge now i want you to listen very carefully and how that science has taken man farther with his five senses than we have with his soul that's the challenge now these people have had burden after burden and you know and they've and then fruit has come because they found their purpose they you know in the tree of knowledge and they begin to things just develop and look at the hard work and the mechanisms and it's just like developing until oh who knows what's going on out there tapping into the very gods laboratory the prophet says why because there's this desire to imitate the tree of life using technology and using the intellect that's why you have gps it's to replace the guide of the holy ghost who's ever been guided by god to something and he's guided you and you've walked and he says go that way and then go that way and go that way and then go down and pick up this thing that's the real gps he says i will be your god yes my lord amen amen hallelujah amen you have these big like cars right and you travel in a car and it started off about 20 miles per hour 10 kilometers that way and 10 kilometers an hour that way right that was as fast as it could go but they were traveling at the speed of the thought of man because that was man's idea that was the intellect that was thought and it had been pushed into this like car and it went that way they traveled by thought but it was only 10 miles an hour and it got wetter and better and better and better until they want to travel at the speed of light i don't think it's very possible i've had big discussions about that because apparently it's impossible so we'll just call it that because actually you see the lord travels at the speed of light amen he says i am hallelujah i am the light of the world hallelujah but you see now you travel and i was i remember just flying in an airplane you know you kind of can't sleep properly and you're just dozing in and out now when i'm like dozing in and out my i start thinking strangely like i'm like oh what am i what am i doing in this cylinder 30 000 feet in the air you know i'm thinking this is freaky you know what how did i end up here and i just say lord you got me here i trust you i'm in this like and then i start pondering i'm like oh this is actually the mind of man this is thought and it's been put together into this very complicated cylinder that's flying 30 000 feet in the air and i'm going this is very high if anything goes wrong we're going down one engine you know and i've had engines stop and i think my i don't want this engine to stop i'm very glad for the aircraft engineer because they check it over real good so that not many engines stop because it's not very nice if it stops in the air and when you're going like this and it goes whoa you're praying and there's hail mary's going all over the place and no man because people are scared because that is the that is really the effort of the tree of knowledge it goes so far but then it falls backwards it has turbulence right it has turbulence and it has it has it has a potential to fail but let me tell you one thing if you put all your faith or your trust or your yielding in the tree of life he will never fail you [Music] he will never fail you he will never leave you nor forsake you he will not leave you unfinished if anyone feels unfinished today i'm sure we can all say yes then just remember he will not leave you unfinished being confident of this very thing that he which begun a good work in you shall continue it unto the day of jesus christ that that's comforted me many years because sometimes i felt like i was like lost and undone or like just completely like man i'm failing and but then i always had faith knowing that he begun something he begun something a devil would try and howl at me you don't believe you don't have faith right ever when i was early on and i held to that because i knew that god started something amen and i could take the devil right back and begin testimony meetings hallelujah take him back to where jesus begun and then you know that the word said that he which begun a good work shall continue it but you see the tree of life will never fail you hallelujah but i want to challenge you that there is such an exponential increase of technology and advancement and the prophet gave a parallel and said that as technological advancement takes place in the spirit the lord is revealing a further part of the inheritance so that we go from just you know the age of horse and buggy justification the age of um um you know car sanctification the age of um aeroplane the the pentecostal outpouring of the spirit then the age of the astronaut is now the holy ghost himself the capstone of god's love taking us out of the earthen ways under the eagle anointing and let me tell you it's not an eagle on the ground who knows that it's a flying eagle anointing it's an eagle anointing that takes you to fly above judgment above sin above darkness above lust above fear into a position with christ hallelujah above those things so when you pray people things change because you have vision to see hallelujah and you say lord let me have that isab that you said because you know he promised isaf to us in this day the laodicean church in revelation 3 he says come to me and take of this i serve and put it on your eyes so you can see that's for you we you know we many of us born in the message but you still need the isaf take it oh yes it's like you would go to the shop and you go buy some ointment for your itchies you know spots whatever and you go buy that and your buyer won't take the ointment from him amen same you might not see it but it's there and you can put it on wipe it on your eyes and let you see spiritually give you spiritual vision to see beyond the veneer of all of this so that you can break through and see reality hallelujah hallelujah amen and i just challenge you now if all of this effort has gone in and they've built up this whole big thing of technology and the tree of knowledge has got as the prophet says science has taken man farther with his five senses than we have with the soul and see he's preaching this early on in the message but now under the opening of the seals and under the revelation of the son of man and under the fullness of god he's taken us into an astronaut age and raised us up above these things so now the fruit that you bear can bring change hallelujah you can change nations you know that if god gets a hold of you you're omnipotent you know that omnipotent or powerful hallelujah nothing is impossible to them that believe that's why i'm encouraging you to pray i'm encouraging you to a supernatural prayer life approach god the right way and he'll come praise the lord hallelujah just approach him the right way don't run into it just rest sit back and and worship kneel down and worship whatever you need to do just worship god enter in his gates of thanksgiving his courts with praise within minutes seconds the presence of the lord just broods down over you the blood put us on speaking terms amen hey that doesn't there's no other catch there's no like speaking terms plus or speaking terms and then you've got to do this this and this and this i'm going to be a really good girl today and then i've got my mom speaking to no you just make sure that you just lay your life before the lord consecrate yourself to the lord trust in his grace and mercy and watch what happens hallelujah amen and be not afraid of desire the prophet says satan seen them go off like that without god now he's talking about them going on the sea satan's waiting for people to leave the jurisdiction of faith he's waiting and he's waiting for someone to go off in their own intellect and see what happens he's waiting so just be careful now he says this satan's seen them go off like that without god and so he said now let's get rid of them and that's just the good way to get rid of it too and matthew 14 24 you know and i just want you to see now in this storm so the storm enabled the revelation of jesus in a powerful way don't be discouraged when you find yourself in a similar storm because you walked in your own path revelation awaits you the lord will not leave you in the storm the law will not leave you in your condition matthew 14 24 says but the ship was now in the midst of the sea tossed with the waves for the wind with contrary you see it's always going to be contrary even when you're walking with the lord the wind will always be contrary to you and always trying to push you but just keep pressing the battle keep pressing on do not cower under fear watch how the lord always strips fear away first he doesn't want us to be afraid hallelujah perfect love will cast out all fear amen and he sees your struggles says here in mark 6 47-48 and i will be repeating myself a little bit but i just wanted for emphasis here and when even was come the ship was in the midst of the sea and he alone on the land and he saw them toiling and rowing he sees those things that you go through he sees you toiling in prayer he sees you beating the the ground he sees that when you're struggling under some slave master and and he and he's waiting for the moment he's going to come he's going to set you free and you're going to get liberation thank you jesus hallelujah liberty from that besetting sin liberty from that fear liberty from that lust or by liberty from your own ability hallelujah you know the prophecy if you can just master your own ability by getting it out of the way then god can perfect to strengthen you you've got to master weakness you know and he saw them toiling and rowing for the wind was contrary see they were battling and battling they were trying they'd realize we're gone too far now this is still dark everywhere the storms are raging the seas whatever 10-foot swells 10 meters raging it's impossible it's coming to the darkest hour and they're rowing and they're trying and many times we find ourselves in these situations where we're just trying and going and we just think it's never going to happen it's never never going to get delivered from this thing this pathetic says oh and no it's not it's not there is an end to it hallelujah because the tree of life is here the redeemer is here hallelujah your season for deliverance is here hallelujah the lord is clearing the title hallelujah he's clearing the title he's clearing all the family traits that are negative he's clearing all of those deceptions the lies that may be in your children's minds that are holding them prisoner hallelujah he's clearing those lies he says be not afraid it is i i have come to take over this battle be not afraid hallelujah the visitation is here amen hallelujah amen for the win was contrary unto them anyone that stands for christ the wind will be contrary unto you but greater as he is in you than he is in the world and about the fourth watch of the night he cometh unto them walking upon the sea and would have passed by them hallelujah he would have passed by them oh my hallelujah but there's a people that are that know that the lord is walking on the water they know that there's a calling in their life they know that there is their time for deliverance it's their time for healing hallelujah they know it's their time that this fear shall disappear that these gossip spirits will disappear that this this darkness will disappear in the darkest hour and the fourth watch of the night just like it was for the church the church was in its darkest place and babylon was taking over denominational systems on everything and the locusts and the palmer women the caterpillars just like in your life sometimes it gets to a point where the locusts and the caterpillars and all those things begin to eat but then he comes the real message this message ain't no doctrines it's more than that this message is a revelation of a person this message is a person of being hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah she's here in the fourth watch in the darkest hour bleak storms are aging like it is out there but then you sit here in peace and you sit here and it's just peaceful and you've got something what do you have what changed it who came in hallelujah oh i just want to encourage you tonight amen hallelujah to think about the magnitude of your benefit and would have passed by them and when the disciples saw him walking on the sea they were troubled saying it is a spirit and they cried out for fear oh my how many times you see now as the revival begins to pour out their intellectual spirits now begin to attack the people that are getting in revival hallelujah you know what we've been attacked as a church people think that we're too wild or whatever or too pentecostal there's all sorts of things and they're looking upon from an intellectual perspective from an external perspective and not knowing that we're experiencing them not knowing that it's the i am causing this disruption it's a passing disruption you know what pattern disruption is a very good technique when you want to make a change and you want to make a statement and i want to tell you jesus christ is making a statement in this generation and you guys are a statement of jesus christ because he's making changes he's taking you from intellectual faith into a true dynamic spirit and truth to prepare you to leave the earth and let you eat from the tree of life you eat from the tree of life and you live forever he put you in rapture and condition disrupting the pattern that all the people would go off and become formal and have all the doctrines tied up all the mysteries together every type every shadow and it's all complete and the the the evidence of the holy ghost is that you understand the message you understand all the doctrines of how pious but really the lord comes to disrupt the pattern to take it from here and make it a heartfelt religion to make it something that changes lives that's why in the darkest hour when it was all going grim and everyone's going off and sin and and leadership is failing and and and all this stuff's happening all over the world internationally and you think wow and all these websites going out there criticizing and yet the lord is working amongst his elect and he is creating an intimacy that we've never seen before and bringing a people closer than they've ever been before to disrupt the pattern of the tree of knowledge and making a religion making a denomination the lord will not settle for a message denomination when he returns will he find faith yes here we are why because he came why because he came and he changed it amen amen hallelujah not because we've done anything it's because of what he's done it's because we found ourselves sailing we found ourselves on that storm riding someone else's ideas riding someone else's faith maybe it's mum and dad's faith but then one day he comes to you and makes it real to you young children hallelujah oh my but straightway jesus spake and i love this they were trouble saying it as a spirit and they cried out for fear and when i what i was going with this is they come and they they begin to look at this dynamic supernatural miracle-working god who changes people's lives who who makes people dance who makes people shout for joy who gives them joy unspeakable so they can't even contain it until they're drunk in the spirit hallelujah can't contain it hallelujah amen i know it's wednesday and you're all really tired but you can't contain it amen you know every service can be like camp every service you don't have to have a mediocre service what you want and what you call for even now from this point moment on is what your faith is what you'll get you know that if you want to go to bed you're just going to have a desire for bed amen if you're thinking about your job and how big and hard it's going to be tomorrow then that's all you're going get you're gonna get a big hard job hallelujah but if you're here and you are ready meaning business with jesus right now hallelujah great things are about to happen great things are about to happen because you see he's come to disrupt the pattern and take it from this grey matter whether it's small or big and take it down here and make it a heart reality amen to take that storm and when you comes into your ship then you become completely angered and the storms begin to settle hallelujah and it says here but straightway jesus spake unto them saying be of good chair it is i be not afraid and if you take the literal translation of this which i i i love it it says take courage i am do not fear that's the literal translation and the apostolic one take courage i am do not fear [Music] take courage children i am not just not not just i am he but the the fact that it's not it's a revelation of him that's what this message is he came to take the church out of a stormy black sea and reveal himself as the i am to remove fear hallelujah some are afraid of our joy they call it pentecostal some look at the behavior of the believer and are offended some disdain the freedoms that we enjoy hallelujah the prophet says this in a prophet like unto moses he says in this hour that we're now living and there's trouble on every hand there's no place to go to sickness is crowding so hard against our scientific researchers till they have not medicines that'll touch the diseases and the atomic race the missile race the world shaking the church in the condition that it's in and jesus comes walking right up by his promise to us the same jesus that walked on the sea that night walks right praise the lord do you receive that amen the same jesus that walked on the sea that night to take them from a storm from death certain death and raging seas and and all and the demonic power over them that was controlling them they were under the jurisdiction of the devil because they had ventured into their own ideas into the tree of knowledge and they were beginning to use their own intellect and they were trying their hardest rolling rowing rowing rowing and then he came hallelujah hallelujah and that is what is happening tonight he is stepping out of the bible out of history the same one that went to them that day why is he doing that what is the reason is to take us from that situation come into our ship and now listen here i must continue this we must finish and then we'll have the musician the same jesus that walked on the sea that night walks right in out of the bible into the congregation hallelujah you're going to call me a holy roller anyhow but i feel like shouting yes sir christ of the bible the god of history walking right into the congregation on his promise of his resurrection there it is he's walking on his promise so i encourage you tonight embrace the promises of god abraham embraced the promises he held them close he they were precious to him and it's important that you take the promises of god and you embrace them and you hold them tight and you lay hold of eternal life hallelujah the violent take the kingdom by force so know that he comes and appears riding on his own promises of his resurrection the grave could not hold him death could not hold him hell could not hold him there wasn't room to hold him he broke the bands asunder and walked out and now it's your turn it's your turn yield and be fruitful healed to the vine hallelujah hallelujah and peter answered him and said lord if it be thou bid me to come unto thee on the water and he said come and when peter was come down out of the ship he walked on the water to go to jesus hallelujah but when he saw the wind boisterous he was afraid and began to sink he cried saying lord save me and immediately i love this immediately jesus streets forth his hand and caught him and said unto him o thou of little faith wherefore did us thou doubt and notice now peter didn't sing here and when they hallelujah when they both were coming to the ship the wind ceased you see there was a journey back peter he had the the the grace and the daring and the courage to step out to go to jesus and i'm calling you tonight to step on the water amen step on the water to go to jesus step out in faith hallelujah step out hallelujah you may find that there will be struggles yes but watch what happens he will teach you the law when you enter that prayer life when you find your purpose when you find your calling when you your reason to live on this earth what are you here for i ask you that question do you know where you stand do you know what your purpose is on the earth you're made for a purpose every single one of you are made for a purpose do you know where you stand don't waste time nothing else will be as good nothing else will fit you properly all your own ideas you might know you think you know yourself more than he does but he knows you better and he's got a purpose for you and then when you get into that purpose then you begin to pray through that calling the faith of the son of god operates in your life and before that you wonder why is my prayers not being answered why i pray for this and it doesn't happen why i pray for that it doesn't happen but then when you find your purpose and then you pray through that purpose and you know your calling and you know the will of god for your life and you begin to channel it through there and then your prayers become answered it's because you're anointed to that that's where your anointing is that's where god will begin to empower you to enforce victory for your ministry for your calling for whatever you are made for and you can pray through those channels and you'll have confidence in god like elisha he followed elijah over the river and then he received the mantle now he could do the same thing yeah absolutely amen that was free can we stand we're going to finish this but we're going to finish it standing and we're going to get the musicians up hallelujah and immediately jesus stretched off his hand oh and and when they were both coming to the ship the wind ceased can you play um i'm sailing over stormy seas amen uh peace be still just play that song quietly i'll just read the rest of these scriptures and it says here and when he saw the wind uh boisterous he was afraid and begin to sink and he cried lord save me and immediately jesus stretched forth his hand and caught him and said unto him oh thou of little faith wherefore did estelle doubt and when they both were come into the ship the wind ceased then they that were in the ship came and worshiped him saying of a truth thou are the son of god the ark returns to break amnesia the lord is that ark that the prison the the revelation of christ among the people amen in the old testament they had the ark of the covenant and it was treated as the presence of god amongst them and you see when that ark returned to jerusalem it brought worship it evoked worship and david danced around that ark the ark returns to us to break the amnesia christ comes to the people in the ship comes into your ship comes into your life reveals himself as i am to break the amnesia and to restore true worship in your life [Music] and separated conditions can bring amnesia but god rich in mercy will come to you for they considered not the miracle of the loaves for their heart was hardened you see they were so it was just so foreign and even though they were just in a revival but the lord would come into their ship because now the sea was calmed and then they were able to cross over and this is the revival that the lord is bringing us into and when they had passed over they came into the land of guinness eric and drew to the shore and when they would come out of the ship straight away they knew him and ran through that whole region roundabout and began to carry about beds and those that were sick when they heard where they heard he was you see there was a desperation in the people when they realized that he was there they realized that revival that was before is happening again and i can declare to you that the revival that happened in the 60s is happening again hallelujah the revival that you hear about in those old days with all the things happening is happening now christ comes out of history out of message history out of the time of judges out of all of the confusion and wildness of what it was it's not that anymore because he is here and he's the one that's come to change it all so that we can rejoice the storm can be stilled the spoken word can be manifested this is the season for it right now who receives that tonight is everyone ready to pray according to what they did here in the lake of guinness eric is everyone ready to bring their sick to bring their their troubled to bring family members that are struggling and they need them bring them to him now this is where we're going to do it hallelujah this is the time someone in your family may be struggling some region may need a revival whatever it may be tonight we're at guinnesses the revival is on do you perceive it amen it says here they they brought their sick that when they found out where he was it was a desperation and whether so ever he entered into villages or cities or country they everyone say they they laid the sick in the streets and besought him that he might touch that they might touch if it were but the border of his garment that's significant that's significant because that is the same condition of the
