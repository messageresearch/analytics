Ministry you know my uh my parents heard him preach brother Dereck in Oakland and they were very blessed amen and they said oh you you know they said oh you going to have them preach you know so you so and and they're very happy that we were so you know so I've already heard some very good reports so it's going to be it's going to be wonderful hallelujah amen let's just go to um I want to go to uh let's go to Ruth chapter 3 again I want to pick up kind of uh I want to color in the picture a little bit more amen um because we live in an age where God has allowed uh we live in a season where God has has allowed his people to walk in a way that uh they have never been able to walk in ages past and I want to I want to speak about a uh maybe if I just start a subject you know I want to really speak about a subject when the wood becomes manifest you know there's uh you know there the Bible is full of Prophecy and it's been laying there some of them for thousands of years but yet there comes a season when that word becomes manifest amen and we understand that God you know his word you know Paul says that the sorry to have you standing but Paul says that uh you know the works were finished from the foundation of the world speaking the book of Hebrews so his word and it being manifest in The Eternity it's already done but then it comes from The Eternity down into time and it becomes manifested amen so what's already in in Heaven Must come upon the Earth and be manifested thank you Lord and so let's just read here in in in Ruth uh chapter 3 and we'll read verses 5 to9 then we'll go down to verse 18 and it says now um so so um so um so the earlier part of the chapter Naomi Ruth's mother uh Ruth's mother-in-law instructs her what to do and then Ruth replies and she said unto her all that thou sayest unto me I'll do and she went down unto the floor and did according to all that her mother-in-law B her and when Boaz had eaten and drunk and his heart was mared she went to lie down at the end uh he went to lie down at the end of the Heap of corn and she came softly and uncovered his feet and laid her down and it came to pass at midnight that the man was afraid and turned himself Behold a woman lay at his feet and he said who art thou and she said pdon me I am Ruth thy handmaid spread therefore thy skirt pardon me over thy handmaid for thou art a near Kinsman let's just drop down to verse 18 um oh let's just read from verse 16 and when she came to her her her mother-in-law she said who art thou my daughter and she and she told her all that the man had had done to her so what Boaz had promised to do and she said these six measures of B gave he me for he said to me go not empty unto thy mother-in-law then said she sit still my daughter until thou know how the matter will fall for the man will not be in rest until uh until he have finished the thing this day amen so may the Lord bless his word you may you may be seated so just to uh just to a a quick summary of of a couple of Sundays ago we speaking about Ruth and how how Ruth was instructed find where he lays down this is the earlier part the chapter 5 where he lays down mark it lie his feet and then and then he will he will then instruct you what he's going to do and so Boaz is a type of Jesus Christ Ruth is a type of you and we were instructed to find where he laid down and Jesus laid down at Calvary and then so when when when we lay down at the feet of Jesus where he died then he begins to act on our behalf okay so because we understand reading the book of Ruth Boaz you know the first first say three chapters of Ruth it's Ruth doing everything everything but then there comes this chapter Where She lays at his feet and says cover me with your skirt because I'm a you know I'm a you because you are a Kinsman to me and so Ruth is actually saying because Ruth is not an Israelite she's a moabitas so Ruth is actually asking boas to cover her shame her old life everything she was to cover it with his righteousness and then um and because you are a Kinsman to me and there's the lord of the Kinsman red redemer were a a family member if they had the ability if they had the money or if they had the desire to do it they could redeem someone that was ens slavery yeah so so everyone everyone remember a couple of Sundays ago so then once once Ruth did this and Boaz knew that she was a Kinsman under her then Boaz began to act on Ruth's behalf and then the next chapter of Ruth it's all Boaz now he goes and redeems Naomi to to to marry Ruth then he marri Ruth and Ruth is no longer an alien in Israel but she's married to Boaz and all of her past life has done away with because she takes on his name thank you Lord and it's the same thing with us we take on the name of Jesus Christ and our old life is obliterated amen our our our everything we used to do that's not us anymore but now there's a part of the there's a part of the story and um so I just wanted to use it as a background because we're looking for a season where Paul would would would speak of in Romans chapter 8 and I just want to um I want to read this because Paul Paul when he was writing to the Believers he would he would speak about Redemption and and he would say that the blood of Jesus Christ has has redeemed you but he would speak about he would speak in Romans chapter 8 and he would he would speak about the adoption the fullness of adoption and we let's just read from from verse chapter 18 and Romans chapter we're going to have a bit of reading today but I want to I want you to recognize as Paul and I know I've said this a few times but Paul in the book of Hebrews he always contrasted what they had to what they had I mean what they have to what they had so what they had under the blood of bulls and goats he contrasted it to what they have now under the blood of Jesus Christ and he was making that great contrast because the Hebrews remember the Jews were slowly going out and the Gentiles were coming in so blind was coming on the on the Hebrews and the eyes of the Gentiles were coming open all right so he was contrasting these things cuz he was trying to get them to see that what they had was greater you know don't just be because he said let us go let us go on let let us just not start the walk let us go unto him am mean so don't just start walking with the Lord don't just get baptized repent and get baptized go all the way into the baptism of the Holy Ghost amen because Paul said to Apollos in Acts 19 we're going to read this but I just want to say this he said to Apollos in Acts 19 have you received the Holy Ghost since you have believed I mean so Apollos was believing he was preaching from the scripture that Jesus was the Christ so he was a Believer but he had not received the Holy Ghost since he had believed and that's many times there comes a failure is that people do not go on and to receive the Holy Ghost God can do a work and he starts a work and he trans you know he you know he delivers from things and he you know does a glorious Deliverance but then you have to be sealed in amen amen so and and so that's why Paul was trying to tell the Hebrews what you have is greater what you have is greater than the blood of bulls and goats you know let us go onto the fullness of it amen and so now Paul would say to the Romans in in in in chapter 8 here in verse verse 18 down he says for I reckon that the suffering of this present time and not worthy to be compared with the glory that shall be revealed in us for the earnest expectation of the creature and we know that that word creature is the creation waiteth for the manifestation of the sons of God for the creature was not made was made subject to vanity not willingly but by reason of him that had subjected The sameon Hope because the creature itself also shall be delivered from the corruption of bondage and to the glory Liberty of the children of God for we know that the whole creation granth and travaileth in pain together until now and not only they but ourselves also which have the first fruits of the spirit even we ourselves grown within ourselves waiting for the adoption to Wi the Redemption of our body so Paul Paul would begin to speak here and we understand adoption now I just trust that you follow me today but we understand that adoption in in in Bible language is not like it is today because today adoption is you go get a child that's not part of your family and then you sign a piece of paper saying now this is legally my son or daughter and then now they're part of your family that is that is modern day adoption but Bible adoption is a is is a child that's been born into the family it's the placing of that child in the family amen so it says you know you know Paul would say that the we're under chutters you know you you know the son is under chuds and he's instructed but then there comes a day when the when the father asks the chudah well how's my son doing and the chuda says he's exactly like you and then so the father now says okay he's ready and then there's a there's a there's a ceremony where now the son is now placed in his position as a son and his authority and word is the same as the father speaking amen so so that is that is real adoption it's the placing that it's the placing of the son in their position in the body of the family same with the daughter amen so but he's saying that the fullness of that adoption is the change is the Redemption of the body and that Redemption of the body is the body change okay so the fullness of our adoption because now now with God working all around the world is when you're birthed into the kingdom now then the Holy Spirit places you in the body of Christ amen so whatever the because all of us have a gift all of us have some kind of ministry if it's a five-fold Ministry if a helper a government or a musician or you know whatever it is it's we have that gift within us and then now the Holy Ghost takes you and places you in the body to function fully in that position so that itself isn't adoption amen but the fullness of that adoption is when these atoms are changed and we go into the next world that's the fullness of it so now we are looking we are looking for that season but now as I said I said in the very beginning there just my opening comments is that now there has to come a time when that becomes manifested amen because the word is all complete it's all finished but it has to be manifested down into time and so God is God he a lots prophecies out for certain ages remember Noah could not have had a Rapture it wasn't time yeah Moses couldn't have had a Rapture it wasn't time the first church they believed they were going to go on a Rapture but there were seven Church ages amen and we're living at the end of the seventh Church age so now we're living in a season where that scripture of the of the adoption to the Redemption of our body that is going to be become manifested amen amen now I want you to understand from the get-go this is all God's doing amen you cannot change you canot create a Rapture in your own strength that's right amen and then many times you know we think of we think of the bride of Christ and we think of you know what we think it is to really be the bride of Christ and we put that image on some pedestal but the reality of it is very different that's right you John the Baptist it says you know Isaiah prophesied you know when he comes with his message every high place will be made low and every low Place made High and the you leaves will clap their H hands and the mountains will skip like Rams and all these things were going on but here was a man who came out of the Wilderness wrapped up in a camel skin standing kneed deep in mud in the Jordan repeating you know preaching the kingdom of God is at hand you've got to repent right and that was the manifestation of that prophecy amen amen so when you know no doubt when they read that they think W what a glorious all the high places made Low Low Places made high it's going to be incredible and when it was fulfilled he was one man out of the Wilderness a w you know you know a man who you know preached about you know the AES laid to the root of the tree New Generation of Vipers and that was the manifestation of that scripture and then he says about the you know you know about the Messiah coming he says he'll take a fan in his hand he thoroughly Purge his floor and do all these things and here came a second cousin after the flesh amen and here was now the Lamb of God to take away the sin of the world and you see how his ministry was you know so man has no idea it's going to be a glorious thing and it is a glorious thing amen amen but often but but the but the manifestation of it is very different to many times what we think it is amen so now we're in the season now where there's a there's there is the Redemption of our body now I want to go let's just if you're still in Romans chapter 8 I want to go further further up now now there has to be there has to be a recognition that there's a people that know that they're Sons and Daughters of God all right and so if we read up here from verse verse 14 it says for as many are as led by the spirit of God they are the sons of God for ye have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear but you have received the spirit of adoption whereby you cry Abba Father the spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit we are the children of God and if children then ears ears of God joint ears with Christ if so be that we suffer with him pardon me we may also be glorified together so he says now you have not received the spirit have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear but you have received the spirit of adoption or the placing of a son whereby you cry Abba Father and that word Abba it speaks of a father as a as a as a vocation and the vocation is now identify as a person that's being addressed so when the spirit of God comes upon the seat of God there's a cry out of their heart saying Abba Father or my father my father there's a distinct recognition or Revelation that God is your father amen so the true baptism of the Holy Ghost causes a person to recognize who their father is where they come from and where they're going amen and and and I was thinking about this now our identity you I mean how we conduct ourselves is really the vast majority of it is based on our identity amen we know we have different personalities but for example if I was born in Australia my identity would be different to me being born here and how conduct myself would be different because I'd be molded and shaped by the culture over there amen even you know and or or if my parents chose to live in South Africa I would be different to what I am now because the culture and the situation around me molds me and shapes me a certain way and and that is because I'm identifying myself with that country amen why are new zealanders proud to be new zealanders because they're they're associating this is my country this is where I'm from this is the nation of my birth amen and they identify themselves with whatever the New Zealand culture is and you take that to every country under heaven but then there Comes A Time now when you recognize I trust you recognize that you're a son or daughter of God where the spirit of God has come upon you where you cry Abba Father or my father my father and then now that Revelation causes your life to be conducted very differently amen because you know you're a son or daughter of the king wow amen it's just like the you know brother Bram would tell the story of that of that African you know who was a slave there taken over to America and the slave buyer goes to the plantation and he sees all the slaves and he notices a particular slave and he says I want to buy this one and the plantation owner says no he's not for sale and and then he but then he studies them a bit more and he says well why is he different do you feed him different no he he receives all the same food as the other slaves does he live a different place no he he he he he sleeps in the same you know same place they sleep that you know well and then he says well why is he different and then the plantation owner says well I wonder that myself and I found out that he's a son of a king of a tribe in Africa hallelujah amen and because he is a son of a king he conducts himself as a son of a king and even though he's an alien in this place and you know he'll never go back and take the C he still conducts himself that way hallelujah amen and if a if a man with just a natural recognition knowing who he was could conduct himself in such a way how much more a son and daughter of God who's been Blood Washed who's been redeemed by the blood of the Lamb amen because our identity is not to be with our culture amen amen our true identity is to be with the word am amen amen that's right amen so there comes a time when we begin to recognize who we are Hallelujah now in Galatians let's go to Galatians chapter 4 because we know very well and brother Braham brings us out we do not become Sons or daughters by the new birth we already were Sons or Daughters of God am mean you you know that's why you just got to rejoice it doesn't matter what condition you may find yourself in and the things you wrestle with you've just if you know I come from God I go back to God Amen if you know that you are a son and daughter of his don't Focus on the battles you may be facing or the problems you may have or the questions you may have focus on God Amen because many times we look at the things that we're battling with trying to work it out and we get sidetracked amen when David was going to be stoned by his own men after the amalekites whoever was took their families away burnt Zig the city took all their families away what did David do amen I know brother Andy was in spy you know wrote the song but David did not you know try and work out the situation he didn't let it Sidetrack him he delighted himself in the Lord amen amen oh that must have been a hard you know he kept the focus he knew the problem was there he didn't disregard it cuz he had to get back his own family but he delighted himself in the Lord and the Lord now came and instructed him what to do and rallied his men and everythingall so that is the most that is the most important thing cuz there's so many voices in this age there's so many distractions it can just be everyday life can be a distraction but don't get if you have and we all have things that we're facing we have problems with whatever more but the secret is don't get so wound up in your mind about the problem focus on God amen amen because man has been focusing on the problem since they left Eden and look where Man Has Come amen we can't continue in the same way that's if you if you lift it before the Lord delight yourself in him he will give you the answer and he will actually put his finger on the on the root cause of the thing thank you Lord amen just as brother John said in the song service you know it brings things from undercover amen now um sorry Galatians chapter 4 and and verse 4 to7 but when the fullness of the time was come God sent forth a son made of a woman made under the law to redeem them that were under the law that we might receive the adoption of sons and because ye are Sons I like that word are amen God sent forth the spirit of his son into your hearts crying Abba Father wherefore Thou Art no more a servant but a son and of a son then an heir of God through Christ so we are not we are not servants amen there's a big difference between a servant and a son a servant a servant can lose his position in the household amen based on his own ability amen just like a job how do you how do you lose a job you don't do it as you should be and you get fired amen but the difference between a servant and a son is a son is always part of the family because you're a blood you're blood relative to the head of the family amen and by being born into that family you have been given a position in that family a servant cannot go to the place of a son amen are you following me I trust this makes you a bit happy this morning because you ought to understand that there's there's come a day where everything that the devil has held against you has been struck off amen and we're living I'm going to go to Revelations chap 5 because well I might just I might just mention it now just to know just so you know where I'm going John when he saw the book being taken remember he's lifted up into an eternal realm but I said everything in eternity must be manifested upon the Earth okay so John when he saw the book being taken and the lamb opening the seals it says that John everything in heaven in the earth and under the Earth heard John cry out worthy and honor and blessings and glory be to the L amen cuz he's redeemed us so John so John was rejoicing before that he was weeping but then he's rejoicing but now he's lifted up into Eternal realm and John represents the bride of Christ amen one man in the vision brother Braham says can represent a whole body of people than Lord amen just like John being taken up at the end of the church ages up in the Rapture he is symbolizing you he's a symbol in the book himself and so now when John sees the lamb take the book and begin to Rejoice that I'd say that Revival amen that Revelation can't just stay up in the eternities it's got to fall Upon A people am mean that word must become manifested Lord just like the great and the harlot's being burnt and the will becoming new and everything else that you read about in The Book of Revelation so must the Revelation that the lamb has taken the book amen he took it on your behalf remember it's all symbol and he wiped away all the claims against it that Revelation must drop down onto a people that's where I'm going cuz that's the fullness of redemption thank you Lord it's tied up with what the lamb does for youl not what you do but what the lamb does for you and then what you do for the lamb is just actually you your love projecting back to him for what he's done for you that's right amen amen that's why we live the Christian Life out of Thanksgiving just like Wednesday when God was moving I just sat there I just so thankful cuz God doesn't have to move he's not obligated that's right God is Sovereign amen amen God is Sovereign this is just how I feel I might be off too far on one side but I feel God does not have to bless us like he does oh but where're his children he's still Sovereign amen it's his choosing I'm going and he saw the remember he saw the meeting before the foundation of the world sure but he actually made a choice they my children are there I'm going to go visit them that way amen because I choose to not because not just because they're calling for it but because I want to do it amen so it's all what God is and that's why I just so thankful because God is gracious amen God is good to us thank you Lord Wonder amen so so that's where I'm going but now so a son now as he said now we because you are Sons he sent forth the spirit of he s sent forth the spirit of his son into your hearts crying Abba Father father so there has to come a recognition now now remember as I said about the using the story of the slave I mean the African who was a son of a king but now a slave in America he was now he his life was conducted as a King's son amen so now when the true spirit of God comes into the soul of the Bride they will conduct themselves according to the king hallelujah amen amen and they will know who their father is that's right amen because if you know who your parents are and you love them you want to live a life that is pleasing to them to give them honor and he deserves all honor glory and praise amen and you and you see now it's like the it's like the story of the prodical son it's in Luke chapter 15 now we understand that the reason the reason the son could go back to the father's house and be restored back to his position as a son is because he was a son amen I know it may be very simple but I just trust that it it it it it it means a bit more to you the reason that he could go back remember he says I want my inheritance so the father gave him the inheritance but then he had didn't have the wisdom how to use it and he found himself in poverty in a Strange Land feeding feeding the pigs of a you know of of some farmer over there and he was so hungry that he just wished he could eat the pig food amen this is the condition he found himself in but then he came to himself he says if I could only just go back to Father's house but then I know it's I know it's the heart of every repentant son or daughter of God he says I'm not worthy to be a son I'll just be happy if he makes me a servant but now but now the heart of that is one we should we have to come to God with humility like that but number two it's what's happening now is he doesn't when he's saying those things he do not understand the grace of his father because he's thinking now I will become a servant so I can earn my way back into the family amen he's thinking I need to earn I need to earn the respect and Trust of My Father Again beautiful and I know naturally you know you have to you can't just demand trust and respect you have to earn those things but this was his heart so number one he had to come that way he couldn't just storm back home and say Here I Am dad cuz he never would have been placed back in his position cuz he would never have learned his lesson amen so he came in real Godly humility and reverence knowing he had done wrong but then the flip side of that was you know because if his father just said okay now you be a servant he would have been very happy with that because but then he'd have to feel now I have to earn my way back and to be a son again amen amen but the re but but you see the father he was not looking at his son that way he just wanted his son back amen amen so even before his son got to his father's house the father cuz they were praying and his prayers caused the drought and the hardship hallelujah amen because he was a he was a Believer and and so the father was looking for the son to come back amen and so when he was coming back the father ran to him put put a good robe on him and put his ring on his finger remember the ring just like the king his signant was on his ring his seal was on his ring and whenever laws are written they had to seal it with the Seal of the king to show that the authority of the King was behind those words and so that's why the that's why the son that's why the father gave his son the ring he's actually saying now because remember he was a he was a bigger he was in rags when he came she's like I I'm going to put my robe over you so so what you have just done is not even seen anymore as as our lord Jesus doesn't just cover our sin but wipes it away and not only that now I'm going to put a ring on your finger to show now you're my son you're back in your position amen but the reason that the father did that is because he was a son he didn't become a son he already was a son amen and it's the same thing with you and I amen this world may Cloud us over and we may think all different kinds of things but there comes a season when the word comes your way Hallelujah and you just think now I need to return to Father's House amen back to a real relationship with Jesus Christ and then when you come he's waiting hallelujah thank now if we go to First Peter I want to read read a scripture time good so 1 Peter chapter 1 and 8-12 I'm in second Peter okay whom having not seen ye love and whom though now you see him not yet believing you rejoice with joy unspeakable and full of Glory receiving the end of your faith even the salvation of your souls of which salvation the prophets have inquired and searched diligently who prophesied of the grace that should come unto you searching what or what manner of time the spirit of Christ was in them did signify when it testified beforeand the sufferings of Christ and the glory that should follow unto whom it was revealed that not unto themselves but unto us they did Minister the things which are now reported unto you by them that have preached the gospel unto you with the Holy Ghost sent down from heaven which things the Angels desired to look into so now Peter's Peter's Peter's saying the prophets were looking for this time and by the Holy Ghost they weren't Minister when they spoke of it they weren't speaking to themselves but to you they ministering them to you yeah so the so the Believers down Through the Ages have been looking for the restoration of the Sons and Daughters of God and annihilation of sin amen that's what they've been looking for because they know they know that God because since God's in nature and you know the seasons that goes you know you know we're back in Spring a year a year before this we're in Spring and so the so so there so it's like an eternity amen but so it doesn't stay the same season the seasons change yeah and so now the Believers knew that how life was under the blood of bulls and goats or what you know whatever condition they're in they knew this is not the end of it The Season's got to change Eden's got to come back again sin's got to be done away with these bodies have got to be changed you know they knew they knew that there there was more to it wasn't just this now for eternity amen and so they were looking into these things then God would reveal to them what he's going to do but there comes a season where the prophecy becomes fulfilled or the word becomes manifested amen and so now red Redemption Redemption I just want to speak about Redemption for a little bit now Redemption must happen through a person maybe I'll go back a bit Redemption means to redeem back something back to its original position yes that's what Redemption is Redemption is not just say just say my phone here which I'm going to read some things out it if I went and bought this phone and I never had it in the first place that's not redeeming my phone yes redeeming my phone is it's mine but it gets lost and even if I have to pay a price for it I will and then I take it back to myself that now the phone has been restored back to its original position and so the Redemption of man happens exactly the same way now I now I know you've heard these things for a long time but I want you to understand God is in a process of redemption yes so he wants to rest Resto us back before there was a fall yes amen and the first part of that is he restores your soul back before there was a fall but now your body has to catch up with that Redemption amen and but but Redemption so we were Fallen but to be redeemed is not just to be patched up but the fullness of redemption is finished when these bodies are changed amen amen when Jesus died on Calvary it wasn't just it wasn't just to forgive us of our sins though that is the main part of it cuz he had to purchase our Redemption and he did but the fullness of the fullness of what he did at Calvary will be manifested when these bodies are changen but then there's also When sin is done away with and The Serpent and the dragon and the false prophet is thrown into the Lake of Fire and then the world is renewed amen and there's a new heavens and a new Earth that that all started amen we know it started with the flood because because the you know brother B tells in the future home but the purchasing of the Earth the claiming part of the Earth was now when Jesus died on Calvary he's laying he's laying claim amen so maybe I'll jump back a bit now the book in the right hand of him that sat upon the throne is called the title deed to the Earth yeah so it's so it's like buying a piece of property with when you buy it you have a title amen you have the title and so and because you have the paperwork just say if this is it you can prove legally by the paperwork this piece of property belongs to me and so now when when Adam and Eve were in the garden Adam had the paperwork had the deed to eternal life he had the deed to the Earth yeah amen now if I've repeated myself I feel that we you need to really this needs to sink in quite a lot because you got to understand there's nothing held against you anymore amen amen so now so now when When sin came into the world that book remember it's symbolic but that right to eternal life was lost by Adam but it couldn't go into the hands of the devil it went back into the hands of the original Creator which is God himself amen and there it is set and now there's a dis dispute over who does Adam's Fallen race belong to amen because if you can you know and the world itself but Satan's really all he really cares about is destroying the souls of men amen so there's been a dispute from that day to this day who does who does who does Humanity who do who do they belong to and Satan Satan because we are born in a fallen State he has a claim on us amen that's right he has a claim on you by your first birth and so he can and because now so Humanity now because of that Satan says no they belong to me but remember he's a squatter he's just a bluff amen but there has to come a time where where it's actually proven who does man belong to yeah and so now in the days of Noah the world was washed off just like you were repent to be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ but sin still came through the ark amen so even though the sin was what all the previous sin was washed off sin still came through amen just like you and I amen okay that's right and but then now Jesus came and he laid claim this is mine amen this was Emanuel God became flesh the word became flesh and dwelt Among Us and by Jesus dying on the cross now in his life he was laying claim this world is mine Adam's Fallen race is mine nature is mine this whole thing's mine he's laying claim amen and so and it's just like us now remember his blood Sanctified the Earth but there still there's still sin amen and so it's the same thing with you and I God sanctifies us of our old life of our old nature but then now the Holy Ghost has to come in and change the nature of the individual that they don't end up in the old life amen it's like it's like a person who has fallen into debt and they can't pay the debt and then a then a rich man comes and he says I'll pay your debt off amen now that man whose debts are now wiped he can be thankful but he can go into debt again what he needs is the spirit of the rich man to come into him that he has wisdom how to use his finances because if the spirit of the rich man comes into him then he won't get into dead again and it's the same thing with you and I you know the Lord has forgiven our debt okay but we need the spirit of God to come in and I trust he has am amen and if he has you will not come into dead again amen because it's not you now it's him are you following me amen so now so now Jesus sheds his blood upon the Earth and now there's a there's a dispute going on and you can see it in Jesus's Ministry you can even go back to Mo you know all the way when when the when when the truth comes like for example you take Moses and Pharaoh there was a dispute who does Israel belong to amen Satan was in Pharaoh saying they're my slaves are do with them what they want what I want to do they're just they're just a tool they're not even human beings they're just slaves then God comes down and Moses saying let my people go and there's now a contest and then now God says and and the reason that all those plagues fall in Egypt on the Nile and and everything that's happened is God is bringing judgment down on the gods Amen on the gods of the Egyptians and then now and then he finally brings the last plague he brings his death amen because is because there's a there's a dispute going on and God is actually saying now you have to let them go they're my property I'm going to make you let them go amen and eventually it comes to a spot where Mo Pharaoh says take the get out with whatever you want just just get out of the country amen because Moses plagues Egypt until finally finally Israel actually they have to acknowledge they're not our slaves take them they're actually God's people amen amen and because Redemption so Redemption must happen through a person and in those days of Moses it happened through Moses and Redemption has to be by Blood so life has to be given blood has to be shed and that's the purchasing price to actually lay claim on it but then Redemption is also through Power amen because there has to be a force on God's end saying this is my property amen it's not just a mental arithmetic or whatever saying oh yes I'm redeemed but God comes down that's why there's always such a there's always such a battle you comeing amongst the truth and literally all hell breaks loose why because the because the truth is being ministered and Faith cometh by hearing and hearing the word of God so Faith begins to rise that you begin to and your eyes begin to come open I'm a son or daughter of God Amen I'm not just born in this world and these are my natural parents you begin to actually recognize amen amen you be because Faith Rises you begin to recognize I'm from Heaven amen I have no part of Satan all this world I'm I'm a part of God hallelujah hallelujah so that begins to rise and it's like Pharaoh putting the pressure on on you you on the Israelites they have to get their own straw I'm going to make it harder for them to make bricks and mean pressure comes down why is that because they're Rising they're rising from slavery into sunship thank you Lord hallelujah and it's the same thing remember this is a spiritual battle this is not a picnic amen that's why you know don't find it strange when all the fiery Trials come and the hardship comes and the battles come amen because it's actually the devil and he'll use whoever he can and he'll and he'll put pressure on you are you going to Bow I'm going to make you bow amen and you're not going to like it and I'm going to beat you in such a way you'll never want to try it again he's a slave master friends it's not a fluffy duck he's a slave master amen but then you've got to recognize all that is because he's a he's afraid he's afraid if you rise to your position he becomes your life and you've got to tell him what to do amen it's just like Moses I've said it before what the first thing Moses did before Pharaoh remember Pharaoh the representation of pharaoh was the king cobra that's right amen he he has like one or two of them on his on his uh headdress and there the first thing do is Moses tells Aaron throw down the rod and it becomes a the Cobra picks it up by the tail again and it becomes a rod again and God is showing Pharaoh I can loose you I can bind you I can loose you I can bind you I can do whatever I want with you Pharaoh amen you're loosed and now you're bound you're loosed and now you're bound Hallelujah and it's the same thing with the bride of Jesus Christ amen you got to recognize that there's power in your tongue you can loose Satan and you can bind Satan amen he is under your Authority hallelujah we're not slaves anymore friends we're Sons and Daughters of God Amen by the blood of Jesus Christ thank you Lord hallelujah so it's by Blood and it's by power amen and our Redemption wasn't just from slavery naturally amen but our Redemption was from slavery spiritually hallelujah we're free people and I that's why I said in the beginning don't look at the situation you find yourself in look in whom your whom your father is thank you Lord amen look at whom your father is so it's by power so now the blood redeems the believer of all the guilt and penalty of sin yes and then the power of the Holy Spirit delivers you from the Dominion of sin amen hallelujah amen so now those two things we're being Redeemed by the blood of the lamb but then the life that was in his blood is now released upon you and gives you the power that sin you are not a slave to sin anymore but now sin is under your feet amen you say well I've got these battles just just just keep fighting you say well I've got a lot of opposition just kill one at a time amen focus on the first devil then kill the next devil then kill the next devil just keep fighting amen just like the children of Israel coming into the promised land they had to take Jordan then they took AI then they took another city and another city and they fought another battle they just kept going yes amen amen Caleb and Joshua they didn't care how small they how the rest of them thought or how big the enemy was God's given us the land am that part of the Redemption was now we're going to possess our land and they possess their land and if that was under the blood of bulls and goats how much are people under the blood of Jesus Christ Amen brother Braham says in the breach message he says he says about Moses saying let there be flies and there was flies and let there be frogs there was frogs and he says if a man can do that under the blood of bulls and goats how much more are people under the blood of Jesus Christ that God has bridged the chasm between God and man Hallelujah and he said now that could be a real text that's right hallelujah how much more now there's no Gulf between you and God amen amen the blood puts us on speaking terms again Hallelujah you've got to speak to your Mountain amen now so Redemption is by Blood it must be through a person and and God became Our Redeemer and it must be by Blood and he shed his blood and it must be by power and that's the power of the Holy Ghost amen all right and now we have I want to read let's go to Hebrews chapter 9 and we're reading verses 14 to 17 now remember Paul in this book of Hebrews is saying we have greater and you got to understand the bride of Christ in this age has greater than previous ages okay because it's God's season to do certain things amen they still be there they're still going in a Rapture but the book of Hebrews says but them without us cannot be made perfect or complete so there has to be a people maybe let's just read this I mean I'll just mention this before we read Hebrews chapter 9 now in the Old Testament those who died under the blood of bulls and goats they were waiting for someone to come to clear their sin debt because the blood of balls and goats just covered their sin that's why they went into a place called Paradise they but they had to wait for someone to come with a real purchasing power that didn't just cover their sin but annihilated it CU remember Satan had claims on them Satan had claims on Moses oh he's got a temper Satan had claims on even Abel and everyone down through amen because everyone is born in a fallen State amen and through that Fallen state that is Satan's claims on you that's right amen so all the True Believers in the Old Testament Satan still had claims on them amen even though the blood that God instituted through the blood of bulls and goats it still covered their sin so they weren't lost but they were waiting for some a man had to come a man caused the fall so a man had to redeem amen so they're waiting for a man to come that could be the Redeemer that could undo everything that they were born with and wipe it clean amen and so when Jesus came amen they're waiting for him to come they had seen him in many different forms down through the Old Testament but now he was in flesh Hallelujah and then now in Matthew 27 it says when he arose many of the Saints arose with him amen and then he says he took captivity captive amen and he and he went up into Glory he ascended on high and lad captivity captive so all the Believers of the Old Testament were in Paradise they weren't in torment they're in Paradise but they needed someone to come to wipe their de cing amen so here was Jesus now with with the blood to do it Hallelujah not the blood of an animal but the blood of God now and he pays the price on full amen and then he goes into paradise and he empties Paradise out so they are all waiting cuz remember there were claims on them but then Jesus came and actually struck all the claims off saying they belong to me and Satan lost all claim he had on the old test Saints amen hallelujah so but them them by themselves were not perfect or complete without Jesus coming amen amen they were waiting for him to come to pay the price amen that's why when he arose when he shed his blood it was wiping all the claims Satan had against them out amen amen so then when he arose the Saints of old arose with him and went up into glory amen hallelujah amen but now there Comes A Time so so the first so so so now the day of Pentecost comes and Braham says in the Easter seal he says now remember these they all believe Jesus died on Calvary yep they accepted what he did but now the life that was in him had to come into them and he says notice that Pentecost their bodies were quickened by the new life they received he says that makes me feel religious think uh here were men fishermen Tax Collectors The Humble little woman of ordinary Housewives little virgin girls they were believers they were were believing that this was the truth they believed that when Jesus died they believed on him and Rose up again from the dead they believed that to be absolutely the testimony of God that he had quickened them to life now they go up to the day of Pentecost to receive their abstract do you know what an abstract is it's when a deed has been cleared amen so he says so an abstract title deed is now a deed like for example this is just say this is a deed to a house then there has to be a search now does anyone lay claims on the house and if no one has any claims or the claims are not settled I mean sorry if the claims have been settled and there's no claims against it then it can be sold amen but before that it cannot be sold because there's claims are you following me amen so there comes a point now so now it says now when they go up to the day of Pentecost they receive the abstract do you know what an abstract is it's when a deed has been cleared they went up there to receive their abstract and they were quickened so he says Oh What A Thrill they had brought the land had been brought for them they had received it he says is it true or not he says we seen them raise up but now what about us we Are Witnesses we seen stood the man crucified we seen the clouds come over the Earth and darken the skies the earthquake and chook there was a nervous prostration but they put him in the grave they Spar him in the side with the I mean I mean Spar him in the heart with a spear and they took his body down laid him in the grave of of Joseph arthea and then they find out that on the third day he raised up again and as the disciple said we Are Witnesses of this we' seen him raise up we know he's alive but then now they had something had to come down from heaven now to show that the clay that Satan had on them had been struck off amen that their Redemption had been paid for so now that's why he said he went they went up to day of Pentecost they received the abstract they received the Holy Ghost amen and so when they received the Holy Ghost God was actually showing them I have purchased your salvation but now by him coming dwelling in in you I'm actually showing now that the devil has no right to hold anything against you amen because when you receive the Holy Ghost what's happening you're thoroughly repented of everything you've surrendered your life completely to the word amen then God looks down on that and he wipes away everything that Satan could hold against you hallelujah amen amen that's what it means by the coming of the abstract so now because you must you must understand if you have been if you really know the Lord anyone here amen amen amen if you've been sealed into the kingdom by the the Holy Spirit which is the same thing then God has forgiven you of past present and future sinj amen remember if we sin if we confess our sins he's faithful and just to forgive us amen but by God sending down the abstract amen by God giving you the Holy Ghost he's actually showing remember if there's sin Satan has claim that's why he says now I've actually eradicated that Amen to show that I forgiven you have past present future sin amen are you with me amen are we all here amen amen you got to understand that if you're a new creature in Christ God has forgiven you of everything thank you Lord amen and there's something in us that when we do wrong we say Lord forgive me and if we do that he's faithful and just to forgive us says in first John chapter 1 Hallelujah so they received they re received their abstract title now let's go to Hebrews chapter 9 sorry I was want to go Hebrews 9:14 and 17 but you see actually before we read this sorry I said that before but before we read this but now what happens is you come to Acts chapter 15 and there are false Brethren come in saying we have to observe the law and there's a big dispute so what's happening now because if if Satan can get you to believe something that's wrong if you have false doctrine of or belief then he has claim on you amen he has claim on you and so now false Brethren came in say that weren't weren't fully born again like the like Acts chapter 2 and they said well we need to we need to still do parts of the law amen and so now there was a dispute and then from there on then there became a decline where the church started in Pentecost but ended up in the dark ages amen and false Doctrine came and Trinity and all these different you know sprinkling babies instead of baptizing you know repentant people in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ all the things you know that are not scriptural but by the devil injecting those in now he had claim amen amen so there had to come a time now but all the True Believers are going to be there okay but they without us canot be made perfect now Jesus and that's why I use the illustration with Jesus in the Old Testament remember we don't have to pay for any salvation amen but Jesus had to come to make them complete amen amen and then so there has to come a people that come to their position in Christ amen amen when the word is made manifested completely and when we come to that position amen then they become Complete because when we come to our position then the dead in Christ rise amen why why hasn't there been a Rapture yet because God is molding and shaping and preparing us and then we when we come to our position then the gener I mean then the dead in Christ raise so they're waiting for us and with us then without us canot be made perfect amen so now let's read this here where Hebrews chapter 9:14 how much more right let's go from verse 13 for if the blood of bulls and and of goats and of Ashes of a heer sprinkled uh sprinkling the unclean sanctifieth to the purifying of the flesh how much more shall the blood of Christ who through the eternal spirit offered himself without spot uh to God Purge your conscience from the dead Works to serve the Living God for this cause he is the mediator of the New Testament that by means of death for the Redemption of the transgressions that were under the first testament they which are called might receive the promise of e of Eternal inheritance for where a testament is there must also of necessity be the death of the testator for a testament is a force after men are dead remember Testament is a will otherwise it is of no strength at all while the testator liveth whereupon neither the first testament was dedicated without blood for when Moses had spoken every precept to all the people according to the law he took the blood of calves and of goats with water and Scarlet wood uh and hisop and sprinkle both the book and all the people saying this is the blood of the testament which God hath enjoined uh unto you moreover he sprinkled the blood both the Tabernacle and all the vessels of the ministry and almost all things are by the law purged with blood and without shedding of blood is no remission so they received an abstract title in the day of Pentecost but there was still the fullness of redemption was the change of the body as we read okay so when when Jesus you know you know we read here now that a testament or a will can only be enforced when the person's dead right but then now in our case Jesus didn't just die to give us what's in the will but he arose again to ensure what's in the will is given to you okay but they had to come it so but the fullness of that will went back into the hands of the original owner okay you following me I'm just going to tie this all together I hope by the help of the Lord and so the fullness of that Will was up in the hands of the original owner okay so the Believers all the way down through received eternal life yeah but they had to come a time now where all claims against the bride of Christ are wiped out yeah and so they had parts of the will I'll put it this way this is just my terminology this is just me they had parts of the will cuz they had eternal life they were given overcoming power to overcome the works of the enemy in their age but they had not received a body change okay but now there comes a season where everything Adam lost is fully restored back into the hands of man that's right amen So Adam controlled the World by the power of the spoken word amen because the second Adam demonstrated everything that the first Adam lost he had dominion over nature everything was subject to his voice amen so he was demonstrating this is what Adam lost I'm now demonstrating it and so if that was the case of the second Adam then there has to come a people a second Eve that demonstrates everything as well that the second Adam did for them yes amen okay so the same Ministry that the first Adam had dominion over all things remember we overcome the world Amen Satan be under your feet amen amen all things will be placed under your feet and so there has to come a season where that word is manifested amen I trust you know and we're living in the hour amen so there Comes A Time now where there's a people upon the Earth and they demonstrate everything the first Adam and Eve did by Dominion because remember if you're an air with Christ you're joint I mean you're if you're part of him you joint ear amen so everything he received you fall ear too because of what he did amen amen so now there is a people there is a people now upon the Earth amen upon the Earth right now that have the power within them amen to bring everything under their Dominion yes amen amen now this is not pie and the sky we are now living in the season of the manifestation of the sons of God the revealing of the sons of God we're living in that season we're living out that season amen amen I said a while ago you know a people cannot live any different to the anointing they have received amen so if we're Anointed with the Holy Ghost to do certain things we're going to do those certain things you following me and so now there has to come a time where the fullness of the title is taken amen so now John John at the end of the seventh Church age and he represents the bride of Christ he's taken up into a Heavenly realm and he sees that book in the right hands of him that sat upon on the throne and he wept much cuz he couldn't see anyone worthy to take back everything that Adam lost remember he rested on joh uh uh he rested on jesus' bosom he was called The Beloved disciple he saw Jesus hanging between heavens and earth paying for his um salvation but he recognized if no one was found worthy to take back everything Adam lost the whole creation was still undone and lost but then he saw the lamb step forth amen and he said weep not John for the lon of the tribe of Judah has prevailed he's found worthy to be open the seals and then when John turned he look he saw a lamb remember it's all symbolic cuz Lambs don't have hands and seven horns and seven eyes amen but speaking of Our Redeemer he couldn't find a man he couldn't see a man worthy enough to redeem everything that Adam lost and then now but then out of the eternities comes our lord Jesus hallelujah amen who's been intercessing who's been intercessor on the behalf of the Saints he steps forth amen and then now he takes the book and so now what's happening now is beforehand remember I said there were claims on the book even though it was in the hands of the original owner Satan says well I cause him to fall it's Amen that's why he's the prince of the power of the year he controls nature because he's laying Adam used to control nature but he forfeited his position and now that's why Satan's in control of this world Amen and so he's actually even though he can't take it he says it's mine because I've got claims on Adam's Fallen race and but then now the lamb the second Adam steps forth because he has the blood he purchased it on Calvary but now he steps forth and takes the deed Hallelujah and by laying Claim by taking the book he's actually he's actually demonstrating there is no claim am mean all the the claims have been struck off the book he I trust this means something to you I know you're listening very quietly but I trust it means something to you because he could not take that book if there was a claim against the book amen but by his own blood he wiped out every claim Hallelujah and then he takes the book to himself so he takes the fullness of the will everything Adam lost and then he looses the seal so he opens the contents of the book amen and then he begins to speak it out hallelujah hallelujah amen and that's why when you have remember John it says in Revelations 10 I was about to write what those seven Thunders uttered but God said write it not but seal it up until the time of the end so there was a part of the will that was actually held back amen Until the End Time amen but then now now comes the season Hallelujah now comes the season where that which was sealed up in the word those seven Thunders has now spoken and brother bam says the seven Thunders is the revelation of the Seven Seals amen so everything in the seals remember when when Jesus said glor I've glorified thy name I'll glorify it again no Jesus said glorify me with the glory I had before the foundation of the world and a voice spake Out of Heaven I've glorified it and I'll glorify it again some Heard a Voice some heard a thunder so what's a thunder it's the voice of God that's not interpreted amen that's that's not understood so it was a thunder but now it's not a thunder now it's a voice yes am amen so that's why the seven Thunders is the Revelation contained in the Seven Seals it's not another thing I just want to say this right now we're not looking for those seven Thunders to utter amen amen some people say we're going to have a seven Thunders Revival the bride is because brother Ram says well the seven Thunders nothing's nothing's come that will awaken the bride we're still waiting for those seven Thunders but then after that he says he says why do the people all they PR say fast and pray fast and pray F you know sound of trumpet it's going to be a new Breaking of the day fast and pray fast and pray he says why do they do that they're good people they feel the pull of the hour being Christians but he says they have missed the Awakening of the Bride yes amen amen and it was Jack Moore one of his managers who was actually missing the whole thing they says they're good people they're sincere people but they've missed the Awakening of the Bride so what is he saying he's saying that those seven Thunders have uttered because the bride has been awakened a Revival is an Awakening amen amen amen so we're not looking for those those things cuz some people are still uh and I'll just say this very simply if the if the seals if Christ has become real amen if the seals have become open to you then you're having a Revival if the word has become open to some people it's still a thunder but to others it's a voice amen and when God speaks it causes people to come into their position amen hallelujah praise God that's why some people still have the dispute is the seventh seal closed or open well to some it's still closed but to me it's open amen amen because I've seen the lamb step forth amen hallelujah amen and so now so that part of the will was held back okay it says in Hebrews 1 and one one and two sorry I know I've said these things before but you verse three who being the brightness of his glory and the expressed image of his person and upholding All Things by the word of his power when he had himself purged our sins sat down on the right hand of the Majesty on high now notice it doesn't say upholding All Things by the power of His word but it's by the word of his power yes what does that mean when God releases a word he's releasing power okay so every age a word has been released and it releases a power to help the people overcome what the enemy is doing hallelujah amen so then now when the seals have come open when the Thunders have uted he is releasing a power to the church through that word amen that that was held back until this end time and that's why I say there's part of the part of the will okay that was held back until the end time amen and so that's why that's why now we' have come to an age that we're living in and you live in it every day amen where God has released a power through his word am so we can take a body change amen so everything that Adam lost is now back in your possession amen hallelujah because I know it's all symbolic but Revelations 10 the book that's opened by the lamb it doesn't stay in the Lamb's hand right amen it ends up in you amen it ends up in the bride so the bride manifests what is in the will it's like if just like if I died I left you all uh you know your your house or whatever I left you if you go and possess the house you're manifesting what's in the will amen amen you're manifesting it and it's the same thing today now God has his will and he's opened it and he's released it through his word and now by because of power comes in through that word and you have faith to live it it lives in you what's happening out you manifest what's in the will I trust I'm not speaking some other language right now yeah you understand amen we're living in a season for the Redemption of the body amen amen and God has released a power through his word that we can walk into that position yes Hallelujah because part of the will that they didn't have you have hallelujah amen and that is why that is why friends that is why the world is waiting for the manifestation of the sons of God and you happen to be that manifestation amen that's why I said before now I need some musicians to come because we're out of time but that's why I said before when John the Baptist came what he looked like and what the prophecies were they seemed like two very different things that's exactly what God wanted them to be okay so don't get caught up in a trap where you feel you should be something else that's why brother R says just live a humble simple Christian Life just walk with God Amen you know brother Braham when he when he had the manifestations of the third pole he spoke the Scrolls into existence the tumor out of existence the storm out of existence gave the fish its life back had he writes two sons received eternal life amen that wasn't him willing things to happen it was actually he said if without an anointing come down when he's hunting the first says what do you need God says what do you need you hunting squirrels how many do you want or five where do you want them to come it was all God initiating it amen but there was the need there and then that power that was already in the prophet became activated amen so it was in there because remember if you have the Holy Ghost in you you have the power within you to speak a world into existence and go live a private life on it you have that power but that power is is is governed by a law and that law is the will of God amen amen so when the need and that's why just just have confidence in God when a challenge comes your way God will cause you to rise to the occasion amen because you have the anointing within you when the enemy comes in like a flood I'll raise up a standard and that standard is the bride of Christ amen amen it's in you it's risen up Hallelujah so he had a need and God anointed him and gave him that need to show that the god of creation was now on the Earth again amen amen but it wasn't it was and it's just like his wife's tumor they prayed they fasted they Anointed with oil but then it came down to the time amen they still went the medical way as well amen but then it was actually God said now speak it it'll be amen amen because that power was there but at the right time in the right seasonall then he said when she when the surgeon gohost to cut her might disappear then a grapefruit size tumor just went and amen amen so we have the power I just want to say we have that power within us amen so much more to you than meet the eye amen you got to know that because God has released us to us in this age amen I don't like that clock Brother Andy I agree it keeps moving but he took the book amen and the prophet now was used and he struck off all the false doctrine of the church amen amen so now Satan has no claim on you hallelujah amen so it's not just your sinlessly perfect but he took a man he took a Ministry and he and he eradicated all the false Doctrine because wher a false Doctrine Satan says I made them believe that they're mine amen so so he used that Ministry to eradicate all the false Doctrine out of the church so not so now there there's nothing holding you here hallelujah amen amen there's nothing Satan can't hold anything against you that's right remember brother Braham said you never did it in the first place you're Justified the first place is God's thought of you before the foundation of the world the first place is God's mind amen so when God thought of you whatever whatever we may be facing in life and battling with and maybe being overcome by God didn't think about us that way you never did it in the first place right amen where's the first place God's thinking of you amen that's why he said to Job where were you when I laid the foundation of the world and the sons of God and stars of God shouted for Joy where were you job then job began to realize I was with you amen he wasn't trying to make job feel little he's trying to get job to see you are in my mind shouting and rejoicing you were one of those Stars amen and that's why John he's taking pastor curtain of time there he sees the lamb take the book and open the seals and then brother ad said John must have seen John amen and that's why he rejoiced cuz he saw himself up there amen hallelujah and that's what happens when the word comes open you see you Mama it's me amen and that that is that is the season we're we're alive in so just walk with God Amen walk with God Amen let him prove his salvation in your life amen he's the one who has to prove remember we are like I'm I'm I'm going to stop but that's like this you know we have a whose Bible is this whose Bible is it and you say well it's yours but what if someone says no it's mine this is like we're just property but you know and God I'm trying to use this analogy but to God we're not property but Satan think for property but it's basically you know there's a claim the Bible can't say I belong to Ben it has no voice amen so it's whoever who says who does it belong to and God just well that's mine and it's not the Bible dictating whose hand it's in it's the person who lays claim on it that has the right to lay claim on it and it's that's why I said let God prove his salvation in your life cuz when he lays claim on you it's not you saying you know it's not you trying to hold on to God it's actually God saying this one's mine amen and the and the ones I have engraved in the palm of my hands I'll never forget them amen hallelujah that's why just let God prove his salvation let God prove who you are in him just walk with him he's the one who has to prove it thank you amen you have to surrender to his word and walk on that's all you need to do amen would you like to stand with me there's nothing held against us friends amen we're free people today Hallelujah you got to remember that hallelujah we're free hallelujah amen can we just sing we're walking in the newness of life no longer a slave to Sin from my old self I am free amen Amen Hallelujah Lord Jesus you me and you call me by my name oh you have touched and changed me I can never be the same Lord Jesus you
