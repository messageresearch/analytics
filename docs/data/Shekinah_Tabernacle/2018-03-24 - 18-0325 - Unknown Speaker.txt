God bless you all good morning everyone give everyone here slide the welcome Tiffy's mum and dad god bless you just you feel welcome I mean good to have right - hey - god bless you you got your Bibles handy let's go to Isaiah chapter 2 so we did so we had the AGM last Sunday and we did have a vote on changing the church named Bob just a way to pray about a bit more and I'm going to see through few questions on the whatsapp see one's mind about it to be sure that now Hosea to end this verses 14 we're gonna read down to verse 23 and then we're going to go to the Song of Solomon chapter 8 loves the Song of Solomon amen hallelujah I was there - 14 this is there for behold I will allure her and bring her into the wilderness and speak comfortably under her and I'll give her vineyards from thence and the valley of Achor for a door of hope and she shall sing there as in the days of her youth as in the day when she came out the land of Egypt Aliyah they came out of the land of Egypt they went across the Red Sea they were singing they were shouting amen and it shall be that day saith the Lord that thou shalt thou shalt call me Ishi and shall no no shall call me no more barley so uh she means husband and barley means Lord so they'll show know thou shall call me issue your husband and thou shalt call me no more barley or Lord they means changing change in a relationship for I'll take away the names of Balaam out of her mouth and they they shall no more be remembered by their name and in that day I will make a covenant for them with the beasts of the field with the fowls of heaven and with the creeping things of the ground I'll break the bow and the sword and the battle out of the earth I will make them lie down safely I will betroth and I'll betrothing unto me for ever ye old betrothed thee unto me in righteousness and in judgment and in loving-kindness and in mercies I'll even betrothed thee unto me and faithfulness and thou shalt know the Lord and it shall come to pass in that day I will hear say at the Lord and I'll hear the heavens and they shall hear the earth and the earth shall hear the corn and the wine and the oil and they shall hear Jezreel and I will sew and I will sew her under me in the earth and I will have mercy upon her that had not obtained mercy and I will say to them which were not my people thou art my people and they shall say thou art my god Amy I'm sure you can say I'm livin that scripture out hallelujah and then that's got a Song of Solomon chapter 8 let's see here this is a man this is great we know the whole Bible is a love story I mean it's all encapsulated in the Song of Solomon the trust you can see yourself in the book it's a Song of Solomon 8 or read verses 5 to 7 who was this that Kamath up from the wilderness leaning upon her beloved I raised thee up under the apple trees this is the bridegroom speaking to the bride I'll start again from the beginning who is this that cometh up from the wilderness leaning upon her beloved I raised the up under the apple tree there thy mother brought thee forth there she brought thee forth that bear they set me as a seal upon thine heart as a seal upon thine arm for love as strong as death jealousy as cruel as the grave the coals are of other coals of fire which of the most vehement flame many waters cannot quench love neither can floods drown it if a man would give all the substance of his house for love it shall utterly be contemned I mean let some bow hits in a word of Prayer gracious father's we have read your word this morning lord I just pray father you had come and just take the service under your control father may your Holy Spirit anoint each heart father Lord may you speak to every life Lord may your word love father might become flesh I just pray Lord there be such clarity in your word Lord may you take the service Lord I just want to move myself out of the way that you can speak father we just want to commit the service into your hands Lord you see there are many sick among us Lord hoo hoo Lord who could not make it today for those who are sick here myself with a cold fire let's pray you touch each one Lord may you raise them up Lord I just ask father Lord because we know by your stripes we were healed Lord and as you shed your blood on the cross to save us you also she had your blood on the cross to heal us and Lord we thank you Father for for our healing as well as our salvation so father I pray you would raise us up father in Lord may you lord the per you've sent your word may it be manifested in our lives this morning granted in Jesus Christ's name we ask these things amen I mean God bless you all you may have your seats I want to if I could take a title this morning I want to speak about the we read there in hosea chapter 2 about how that the Lord would would give the people the valley of Achor for a door of hope and she shall sing there as in the days of her youth we have come to us we have come to a time where where the bride of Jesus Christ I believe has has begin to well not begin to but is recognized who she is you know the the scripture the scripture as I said is a love letter it is not a it is not just a book of stories it is a book of love and Christianity is a relationship between God and man as in a marriage between husband and wife and here we have in Hosea that God is prophesying he is speaking to Israel but we know they were just a shadow with it we are the reality that he's saying that there would come a day would when we would no longer call him Lord but we would call him husband I mean because someone someone who addresses someone as Lord has a different relationship to that who was married to him I mean so it come a time where God would elevate his people from being being servants or subjects that he would unite himself with those people that they would become joint heirs with himself Alleluia so there so they came a time now where God was saying in Hosea that I'm going to bring you back to a place I'm going to give it to you as a possession and this was the valley of Achor now I just want to just just lay a bit of a foundation to show you here I know this is familiar to to many of us but when we speak of the Old Testament we are not just finding some stories that maybe fit what we're saying but the Old Testament as a shadow and the New Testament is the reality so what was laid out in the Old Testament was a was a was was pointing to something like if I had my hand and I had a light shining on my hand you'd see the shadow of my hand on the wall and as my hand goes closer to the wall the shadow would begin to look more like my hand right but then there comes a time where you don't see the shadow anymore you see my hand you see the reality right so the Old Testament was the shadow of something that was coming into reality which is the New Testament okay so now so when we talk about the Old Testament we talk about Israel they were living out a shadow of what we would be living out in reality you're following me this is very important because I want you to understand that the old test was not just some history or some law but it still applies today and what the believers faced in the Old Testament is what we are facing today but in a different form and their journey out of out of Egypt under Moses into the Promised Land was a prophecy of a people that would come out of the world and would be placed positionally in the body of Christ and their inheritance hallelujah so now we read here this is and I just want to show you this from Scripture now which it says in Hebrews now Paul is paralleling the journey of Israel out of Egypt under Moses and he's paralleling their journey to the to the believers that he's writing to the Christians that as they journeyed out of the world from from out of Egypt sorry through the wilderness into the Promised Land so we must leave the world we must come out of out of Egypt and come into Christ they meant for now he begins to speak about a rest here I'm going to come around to Hosea but I want to lay these things out a little bit wherefore as the Holy Ghost saith today if you'll hear his voice harden not your hearts as in the provocation of the day of temptation in the wilderness when your father's tempted me proved me so my works 40 years wherefore I was grieved with that generation and said they do always earn their heart they have not known my ways so I swear in my wrath they shall not enter into my rest while it is said today if you'll hear his voice harden not your hearts as in the provocation for some when they had heard that provoked howbeit not all that came out of Egypt by Moses but with whom was he grieved forty years wasn't not with them that had sent whose carcasses fell in the wilderness and to whom swear he that they should not enter into his rest but to them that believe not so we see that they could not enter in because of unbelief let us therefore fear at least a promise being left unto us of entering into his rest least any of you should seem to come short of it for unto us was the gospel preached as well as unto them but the word preached did not profit them not being mixed with faith in them that heard it for we which have believed to enter into rest as he said as I've sworn in my wrath if they shall enter into my rest although the works were finished from the foundation of the world for he spake in a certain place on the seventh day on this wise and God did rest the seventh day from all his works and in this place again if they shall enter into my rest seeing therefore it remaineth that some must enter therein and they to whom it was first preached entered not in because of unbelief again he limited a certain day saying and David today after so longer time as it said today if you'll hear my voice harden not your hearts for if Jesus had given them rest then would be he not afterwards have spoken of another day there remaineth therefore a rest to the people of God for he that entered into his rest he also has ceased from his own works as God did from his let us labor therefore to enter into that rest lest any man should fall after the same example of unbelief now in the Old Testament there was a Sabbath day that they kept and the risk that he's also talking about us entering into the Promised Land there to say that was a type of the rest where they came out of Egypt they went through the wilderness and they had enter into their inheritance which was them entering into but we know that Jesus when he spake because he said no we were just read in Hebrews that that there has there is a risk that that that is for us and it's not keeping a day Amen it's not keeping some holy tradition or keeping some day they had to keep the Sabbath under the Old Testament but we'll read in Colossians that was just a shadow of things to come but Jesus now standing who is the lord of the Sabbath he or the Lord of rest he said at that time jesus answered and said unto him I thank thee O Father Lord of Heaven and Earth because thou has hid these things from the eyes of wives of the wise and prudent and has to reveal them unto babes even so father for so it seemed good in thy sight all things had delivered unto me by my father and no man knoweth the son but the father neither knoweth any man the father saved the Son and he to whomsoever the son will reveal him and then he says come unto me all ye that labor and are heavy laden and I will give you rest take my yoke upon you learn of me for I am meek and lowly in heart and you shall find rest for your souls my yoke is easy my yoke is easy and my burden is light so Jesus is now speaking now come unto me and I'll give you rest for yourself he wouldn't have said that if keeping a day or keeping the law was sufficient but that was just a shadow now here he was to give the reality I'm going to give you rest for your souls come unto me and take my yoke upon you hallelujah now we understand from the scripture that the true rest of God is when you truly enter into Christ when you are born again by the Spirit of God you enter into rest amen so if you've truly met him you have entered into rest are you all following me the true Sabbath is not keeping a day the true Sabbath or the rest Sabbath means rest as when you are fully when you are sealed into the kingdom by the Holy Ghost that is the rest hallelujah now he says and Isaiah 28 speaking of this day that would come he c is for precept must be upon precept precept upon precept line upon line line upon line here a little and there a little for what stammering lips and another tongue will he speak to this people to whom he said this is the rest when he may cause the weary to rest and this is the refreshing yet they would not hear so with the stammering lips and another tongue I'll speak to these people and he says this is the rest and then when the Lord came down on the day of Pentecost and filled 120 in the upper room I mean there was God now come and dwelling in his church giving the rest to their souls giving him the real Sabbath and they am and then when that happened they you going to read the book of Acts they came out of the upper room they were all trying to be pious and things that the Bible says they were acting like drunk people as with stammering lips no the tongue they're rejoicing hallelujah this is the promise of profit you know you know that was given by the Prophet Joel I'll pour my spirit out upon all flesh Pilate is the fulfillment I'm entered into race they were happy about it hallelujah they're rejoicing about it I mean because they entered into the true race hallelujah it says in Colossians 2 it says let no man therefore judge you in meat or in drink or a respect of a holy day or a new moon or Sabbath days for which of the shadows of things to come but the body is of Christ so Paul is already telling them don't let any man judge you and me to drink her I keep the stay or I don't keep this day I have this feast or whatever more a New Moon's or sabbath days that's a shadow I'm it's just a shadow pointing to a reality so the shadow was keeping a day but the reality is entering into eternal rest where God will come in and seal you into the kingdom hallelujah so that is that is the so I read all that to show you now that what Israel went through from from going from Egypt into the Promised Land as a shadow or you're pointing to what we are going to do in reality right this is the Old Testament is more than stories and laws and and history it's more than that it's a prophecy speaking of it speaking of it in time people Amen so now here we are so they journeyed now so they journeyed from they journeyed from from Egypt under the Ministry of Moses and God God called them out because he wanted to unite himself with him he wanted to join himself with his people so he called them out of slavery I mean said send a prophet and to enter and to Egypt the prophet Moses and that was to deliver them out of the out from under the taskmasters whips from you know from under slavery call them out amen because he wanted to unite himself with those people that not only that that they would he would be their God but he would say these are my people and I identify myself with my people hallelujah so he called them out now and they journeyed from from from Egypt and they Jenny you across the Red Sea and they went into the Promised Land but now when they entered into the promised land the land was sealed up the inheritance was sealed up hallelujah so now they head to the first way for the for the land to come open as Jericho had to be taken so Jericho was the interest to the lane you're following me they had to take you know I'll tell you this friends maybe I'll jump ahead to it back in Genesis when the patriarchs were being named and the inspiration they were called certain names call them Natalie or Reuben or GERD or as a car or Benjamin or Manasseh or 'iframe or whatever the names were I mean those inspiration their name was actually identifying where they'd be placed in the land I mean where they would be positionally placed was based on the name that they were given and so when when Joshua comes down to his ministry and his ministry was to place the tribes and certain parts of the land I mean he was guided by the Holy Ghost where where where the blessings that they were placed on the patriarchs I mean back in Genesis were identifying where they would be in the land and by the inspiration of the Holy Ghost he's his Manasseh you're up here Ephraim you're down here dad you're here Zebulon you're here you know he was he was placing them because their name we're pointing to this is your inheritance hallelujah their names we're saying this is where you gonna live this is your position in the promised land hallelujah now you say well what does that got to do with us now we are called by a new name Amen we are called by a new name brother Branham would come into the first seal and he would he would he would begin to identify he would begin to talk about the first seal but he's now when when the lamb takes the book of revelations chapter four and five it's it's our inheritance being everything Adam lost now that went into the hands of the original owner I mean gee our Lord Jesus our lamb the second Adam he purchased our salvation on Calvary but then he had to claim back everything that Adam lost so he could give it back to Adams redeemed race I mean our inheritance so now when when when the seals are open the Prophet messenger is standing on the earth and his commission go back to Jeffersonville preached the seven seals out of the book of Revelation did now what happens is the lambs take in the book and he's now beginning to give an inheritance back to the people and so in order to give an inheritance it's going to be a name change are you following me so he says in the first seal he says it's sealed up the Lambs blood paid the price that thundered when he spoke it out and when he did a white horse rider started out it was and still it was assembled now watch he said it would be known in the last day but it comes forth in a church symbol you understand at church it comes forth in a symbol of a church that they know there is a seal but just what it was yet they don't know because it's a white horse rider and it's only to be revealed in the last day when this actual seal is broken broken to whom not to not to Christ but to the church notice oh my this makes me tremble I hope the church truly understands it see see what I mean you people I'm gonna call you bride see that you'll understand it the voice is a thunder the voice came from where from the throne with a lamb they just left us the Intercity she's I'm gonna call you bride so you understand what's go because it's a that's a title or a name and it designates a position or an inheritance I mean just let's talk about the Old Testament tribes they were called certain names because they're going to be placed in certain part of the body amen so now as he so now as our inheritance is being read out to us to the Bride of Christ now so now the Prophet saying I'm not going to call you church anymore I'm going to call you bride that you'll understand this because now the inheritance is open up and if there's a name Amen it designates a position and so we are predestinated to a position in Christ I'll just go keep sipping nose with the tar start to fall off I'll just read Greece it will be fine but you see how our name represents a position is everyone following what I'm saying so Manasseh Manasseh was called Manasseh because he was had to live in a certain inheritance that's why he was called that because his name was a prophecy this is where your four bit I mean this is where your descendants are gonna live it was a prophecy saying this is where they'll be or or Joseph or I mean I mean you know Judah or any of the tribes it was prophecy saying their name will mean they live in this part of the land and so now when God says I'll call you bright now he's saying I'm going to give you a different inheritance to what the church may have had Alleluia so it's a prophecy now saying you're going to dwell in a certain position I mean because we know our inheritance is not a piece of real estate like Israel is the state our position I mean our inheritance is our position in Christ hallelujah so now he's saying now I'm gonna call you bride so we are predestinated unto the adoption it says in Ephesians 1 blessed be the God and father our Lord Jesus Christ who has blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in Christ according as he has chosen us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and without blame before him in love amen having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus to himself according to the good pleasure of his will to the praise of the glory of His grace for in Heath made us accepted in the beloved now we understand adoption in the Bible as not is not say going to China or going to some family that's not a blood relation to you and and they're now signing some paperwork saying now this child is now part of my family that's my Bible adoption Bible adoption is the placing of a child that has been birthed into the family and to their position in the family that's adoption that's bible adoption hallelujah son our Bible adoption is now we're birthed into the kingdom by the Holy Ghost and then he himself places us in our position in him amen so we are predestinated unto the adoption of sons hallelujah this is our our destiny has been predetermined amen you understand what I'm saying so so God is telling you I mean that your destiny is that you will be placed as a son or a daughter of God hallelujah this is what your destiny is they mean so just like he said just like the Hebrew mother said Manasseh when Manasseh was born that was now predestinated Manasseh was predestinated to dwell in that part of the land because of the name that was given because because the child was burst into the family I mean so now it was predestinated to be placed in that part of the body just like the Bride of Christ were being predestinated unto the adoption of sons hallelujah that means we're not a servant I mean that means we're not just some hired help hallelujah but that means we're a part of the children of God and we're part of his family by His grace I mean out of every kindred nation and tongue hallelujah God has predestinated a people I mean upon the earth I'll not leave them in slavery I'll not leave them in darkness I mean I want to leave them spiritually dead or blind but I'll awaken them by my word I mean they will know they will know as they are knowing amen hallelujah God wants to know God wants you to know who you are I mean he doesn't want you just to think well I'm from certain country this is my family this is my socio-economic place in the world I mean that's not what it's about God wants you to understand you're my child and then you're my son in my daughter hallelujah you're part of my family amen but you see now it's more than just having little children I mean God wants to marry a woman he's looking for a people to marry to a men to unite himself with I mean to say this is my wife this is the feminist part of me hallelujah that's what he's wanting to do they mean this way he says now I no longer call you search I call you bride that you'll understand it there you understand what's going on lelou yeah now as I said your Jericho was the entrance into the land and the church has come out of come out of the Dark Ages they've been under under the Reformation under under Martin Luther and and the others of the Reformation that came out the Dark Ages and the churches journeyed the churches journeyed from frot from Egypt through the wilderness and then they came to a point in these last days were nowhere to go for this the fullness the inheritance hallelujah but now the entrance of the of the kingdom had to be opened and so as Jericho it was Strada shut up because of the children of Israel no one went out and I went in so this was the entrance into the land Joshua had to take Joshua had to open the land to the people I mean this is this was the entrance and they crossed the Jordan I mean but the book was sealed I mean the land the inheritance was sealed up I mean without taking without taking Jericho they couldn't be placed in there in their position in the land I mean so now it was sealed up and then they take and then you know the rest of the story God comes down as the captain of the hosts of the Lord takes over the battle hallelujah takes over the battle amen he begins to instruct Joshua what to do maybe just like God comes and takes over our battle hey Joshua goes out he's trying to work out how can I open this how can I open this inheritance to the people amen brother Branham was given a Joshua Commission I mean to to take the people across Jordan into their position in Christ hallelujah and Joshua stand is saying how am I going to take the land and a man comes with a sword drawn and Joshua says you forced her against us he says I'm not for you I'm not against you but I come as the captain of the hosts of the Lord he says he says I'm not on your side you're on my side I mean I'm in charge of this battle it's the same thing with us now God we're not on yeah I mean our God is our captain he he's come to fight your battles I mean if you can just get your humanity out to one side I mean God can live hallelujah so now Allu yeah amen oh I've been rejoicing hallelujah I mean for now yeah and then they take they take Jericho so now the land is unsealed I mean the land comes open the inheritance comes open I mean so now what was sitting you could say in Scrolls that was given on Mount Sinai could now be lived I mean it could now be manifested in their lives whereas more than just then your Moses saying you go possess the land and when you go possess the land do this and this and this as well just hearing ministry but now they could possess or they could live out what Moses gave them to do they meant for now Joshua he says after Jericho has been destroyed he says in Joshua during them at that time saying cursed be the man before the Lord that raises up and builds the city Jericho and he shall lay the foundation there I've been his firstborn and in his youngest son he shall set up the gates so the Lord was with Joshua and his fame was noise throughout all the country I mean so he says cursed be the man who tries to seal up the promised land again amen cursed be that one who tries to say the book is sealed that the inheritance is not for you it's for another time for a future time cursed be the man that seals up the book hallelujah because the inheritance has come up but in the same time I mean we know exactly everything that is allotted to us hallelujah we're not Singh what our position in Christ is or if we more than overcomers we know we're more than overcomers and then we know that we're more than conquerors through him that loved us I mean we know our sins are all washed away I mean we know we don't have to do penance and do some pilgrimage someplace and try and pay our way out of out of hell or whatever whatever nonsense we know jesus paid it all and then we know we're without sin without spot or wrinkle washed in the blood of lamb hallelujah hey people get excited about all different kinds of things what about eternal faith what about things that really matter in life hallelujah so we know our position we know the devil's under our feet I mean we know is defeated that day on Calvary hallelujah I mean it's like Miriam and you know when they when they crossed the Red Sea and they and their slave masters were did behind them they begin to dance they began to rejoice I mean the ones that were whipping me and beating me a dead I mean they tried to follow me but they couldn't follow me hallelujah we're going to recognize the spirit badness in the world I mean I mean they didn't bury hallelujah and now whoever shot two agents or we're not a bunch of slaves I mean as God told Moses and children of Israel go take the lame I'm in you to the fight for every inch of your inheritance but go take it I give you the slain hallelujah and we have to recognize Amen if the enemy's being drowned in the Red Sea behind us I mean the enemy in front of us will be like the ones behind us hallelujah I mean I wouldn't be too worried oh just go take your go take your inheritance hallelujah but then they come to a I this is really wrong oh you know where I want to get to they come to the city of AI so now the books off I mean the inheritance is open they begin to journey they've taken Jericho the next place they come to his AI but before AI I mean we know akin he took the Babylonian diamond in the gold wedge in the silver he took it from he took her from Jericho and he hid it under his you know you know in his team and so now when they're going to take AI now I mean they lose the battle and Joshua says what's going on we call a halt we're to find out what's wrong because they were I must define a whole campaign without losing a man I mean I promise you you're wherever you set your feet you will possess it hallelujah so he was told you will not lose it's the same thing we're friends we are we have been told you shall not lose you shall have the victory hallelujah though you may be pushed down get back up it's not having the falls of him that gets back up put your helmet of salvation back on pick up your shield of faith and the sword of the Spirit I mean press against the enemy hallelujah we will that last him hallelujah amen and we're not called to just have some trench warfare amen build our position and bunkers and say well I believe this and I'll stay with this and I'll stay with this wherever we're called to advance we're cool to take the whole word I mean we call the tank our whole adherence police they come to AI now and then they lose the battle and then any Joshua says we're gonna call a stop I mean call a halt and then they cast lots and they come down and it comes down to Aiken who's the one who took the Babylonian garment and the gold wedge and the silver and in Jericho and then now Joshua Joshua and Israel they they take that sent out of the nation and they do this in the valley of Achor you may say well what's that good to do with what we're talking about I'll go back to here again so I'll give thee I will get thee I'll give her their vineyards from thence and the valley of Achor for a door of hope and she shall sing thee now the valley of Achor was where akin was dealt with and the sins that were holding back the sins that were holding back the people from taking the risks and lay and God is telling the bride I will give this place as your position Amen that you all know you possess this place where passion has been done away with in the land I mean that it's no longer holding you back but now it's a memorial that God has dealt with us now you're gonna advance and take the rest of land only there's been a breakout friends I mean the devil can't ride all this within me you know you know we may have formed a beachhead roulette right sir hallelujah I mean God's dealt with the past only it goes that with your transmission and because that was your your other things you feel so shameful about I mean as blood has washed you and his blood is cleanse you he doesn't hold you hold it against you why should you hold it against yourself why should you hold it against yourself I mean there comes a time where he says I'll give you this as a position hallelujah Amen hallelujah so now and then and he says that she'll sing there as in the day she came out of Egypt I mean the day she came out of Egypt I mean she crosses the red red sea you talk about a Pentecostal Jubilee hallelujah because it would became a reality that the enemy was dead that's why they sung that's why they shouted that's why they danced because they knew their enemy was defeated and was dead behind them hallelujah says that's why you shall sing there and because our enemies been defeated hallelujah this the thing that afflicted you and your inheritance has been done away with hallelujah that you can possess now the whole lame hallelujah amen because now and that's why I read the scripture who is this who was who is this that cometh from the wilderness leaning upon her beloved this is the bridegroom speaking to the bride who's this one that leans upon me I mean who is this one that leans upon me I mean and in the bridegroom saying this is the virtuous one this is the one who's been washed it white as snow there's what has been cleansed of all sin I mean that would be without spot or wrinkle made every would hole I mean this is the feminist part of me this is the one who's become the word hallelujah I mean who is this who is this my beloved this is the anointed bride I mean just as the bridegroom was anointed the fullness of God he badly was that one man Christ Jesus now that same anointing has come upon to me me me many mean but people hallelujah a bunch of people ooh yeah friends were called to take a land amen this lands come open I mean this word has come open I mean we're not waiting for a seal to open we're not waiting for the inheritance to come down it's already happened I mean this is not a sealed book anymore we're probing at things theologians trying to probe God comes and says this is what you are God says this is what I've done for you hallelujah is not a mystery anymore it's been revealed hallelujah who's this my beloved who who is this that leans upon the arm of her beloved I mean this is the one who who's given a winning band of unmerited predestinated grace before the foundation of the world hallelujah talking about you hallelujah I mean God listen to invisible union of the bride in Christ that's glorious I mean because he's declaring now there's a union going on there's a marriage why did Jesus die to marry a people it's all about relationship the Bible Allu yeah now I will go back to where we were where you'll no longer call me Lord but you shall call me husband you've got to recognize him as your husband he said never been married I mean you'll know what it's like to be married when you when you marry him hallelujah it's not just some rule or some distant person can I come and speak to you now is it okay you know it's like no husband hallelujah I need you and then he's there you know we give God purpose have you thought this is not way out of left field you know we give God purpose you know we give God God was there before there was anything created before the earth angels or any molecule and is there alone God knows what it's like to be lonely he's he's there alone in eternity with his great thoughts and he begins to express himself then finally it comes down this atom and a garden and paradise and then God is looking at Adam and he's actually speaking about himself as saying it's not good that man should be alone because he's alone and and Adams loneliness is a reflection of his loneliness and he's I need to express myself God wants to express himself God wants to make himself knowing but he needs a people to have a relationship with to express himself to he wasn't just satisfied with having a bunch of animals on the earth he one of the people he wanted someone on his level hallelujah and so he made Adam he says this is not good after then it was very good or good but now this is not good something's gone wrong well it hasn't gone wrong but in his mind this is not good I'm gonna fix this and then he puts Adam to sleep he takes a feminist part of his spurt out of him and he takes a part of Adams body and makes the female body he puts a finished part of Adams spirit into Eve and she wakes up Adam wakes up and then we're now Adam sees he says I see a part of me oh yeah I don't see a different animal I don't see whatever the closest was I don't see the serpent which was the closest to the man I don't see an animal was different I see part of me and they were called Adam before the fall they were called Adam because they were one one person in two bodies because his here's the man and here's the woman and they make the hole they make the one person hallelujah you know this is saying about how you talk about your spouse especially meant the woman is the better part of me the better half of me holy and that's not half Rob this is what Adam could have said about Eve his here's the other half of me which completes me amen and it's the same thing with us in God now God created a bride he created a people and he didn't want them to be groveling up his steps thinking will will I be accepted will I be even thought of you know will he turn and look at me that's not what God wanted us to be MMB would but but he wanted us to be now here's my husband because he wanted to express himself God loves to express that's why this this universe is that God could express himself he put as he wrote the Bible in the stars he wrote the Bible of nature you see death burial resurrection and the change of seasons I mean God is revealing himself a nature he reveals himself in the heaven he doesn't just want to stop there he wants to reveal himself personally to you and that you would know him in a personal way I mean that you would know him better than maybe you know yourself hallelujah it's like Esther come to the book of Esther she's all worried I've got to go before the King oh here I'm afraid to go before the one that's you know that loves me that I found grace in his sight you read the book of Esther says the king is to found the Grace in the side of the king it wasn't her doing anything that was particularly that mattered she found grace in her sight he following me she was wise because she listened to Haggai and hagar knew the heart of the king and that's why she arrayed herself in a certain way I mean but ultimately it was because the king I mean when when he saw Esther she found grace in his sight but now so she's afraid now I've got to go before him and I haven't been summoned and this could mean Dean and this is her husband who doesn't what spouse doesn't want to be around the other spouse something's very wrong if you don't want to be around your husband or your wife your that's the one person you want to have the most around you so she goes in before the king she needs to understand don't call me Lord call me husband she has to come to a place in her walk that he is more husband than the Lord he followed me and so she goes in and of course she finds favor in his sight ask what you will even up to half the kingdom and that doesn't mean that would have split the Empire and to means I make you join here with me hallelujah it's Adele we have two friends you got a look at him in a very different way he's not some distant God someplace that the church world tries to make him that's not why he died on the cross he didn't done the cross to be some distant God someplace I mean but he died I'll be with you even in you to the end of the world and my blood cleanses you that I can do well in you amen let's go I want to go do this is the promise I mean I'll give her vineyards and the valley of Achor for a door of hope it's a door of hope now shall sing there what's it now hoping the bibles and expectation it's not it's not like I pray you'd never don't do it that's not like buying a lottery ticket and say well I hope I win that's not Bible huh hope and the Bible's and expectation that it's going to happen so I will give this valley for a door of expectation hallelujah and this is a door of expectation because there are God has done done away with this that we can continue to take the fullness of the land that's down expectation I mean this has been the sin has been dealt with now we can advance take the fullness of the promised land and behold this is the promise for our day behold I stand at the door and knock and If any man hear my voice and open the door I will come into him I will come into him not I will be next to him old coming to him I will dwell in him If any man hear my voice is why the voice of the seventh angel so important is the voice of God to this generation amen it's a love Alleluia and he open if you open the door I will come into him I will come and dwell in them and will sup with him and he with me to him that overcometh will I grant to sit with me in my throne even as I also overcame and sit down with my father in his throne he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches now so he says I will come in to him and will sup with him now I took this both ways the word sup here it means to dine that is the principle or evening meal we're in the evening time we're in the evening time this is the principle feast this is the main part of the meal of the day hallelujah I will come and dwell in him and we're going to have a communion we're gonna have a relationship holy it's not just gonna be a working relationship this is a love relationship Pauline this is a marriage I mean there's a principle feast I mean we don't just live off man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceeds out of the mouth of God and we will get a whole buffet table hallelujah probably the whole tape load of food hello Lewis the principal it's the principal or evening meal and also when I thought of sup now this is just me but it's like when I don't know brother Steve Bristol Meechum listeners in his sermon about why the cup I didn't listen to the whole thing but was wonderful what I heard but it's now when we know when a Jewish man traditionally he goes to get engaged he doesn't give a ring he gives a cup he gives a cup and now the acceptance of the of the like the will you marry me is now the woman takes the cup and drinks it and then the man takes it back and he smashes the cup because he can't give it to anyone else now Alleluia so now this is this is just me when I read this I will sup with him and he with me I mean this is this is a communion I will come and unite myself with these people hallelujah I'll come and unite myself because if he says I will come into him I will come and dwell in them that's a uniting amen and the bride and Christ is uniting in this day hallelujah Amy this is not only the main the main meal of the day it's a uniting time Alleluia and so now they're so we're living in an hour where we no longer caught we do call the blood because he's still Lord but we call him husband our main relationship with him as husband hello Lou yeah I knew now what a day to be alive it is a return and Jubilee that's why it's so important you say well why people call talk about the bride the bride the bride because we're going to know who we are in him that's why he died the purpose that he died for is that you would know who you are I mean that we're no longer a slave or no longer a servant he doesn't want servants he wants a wife he wants to unite himself and remember it's all his doing it's all his doing Amy and it says if any man as I said as we read there so I'm just going to skip back to it if any man hear my voice and open the door he's the one that comes he's the one that gives thee you know he's the one that comes first and he sends his voice upon the earth all we have to do is respond hallelujah because this is purpose for sending his voice upon the earth I'm gonna I'm gonna come and dwell in a people they will sup with me and meet with them hallelujah so it's all his doing I mean who is this that leans on the arm of her beloved this is a leg this is a woman that was was once United to the world hallelujah that was once married to the world I mean but God came and killed that Union hallelujah the first husband died hallelujah that we begin that we're allowed to be united to another and then another is Christ hallelujah amen no I'm just going to go back to this and if we had time or time would permit us rather we'd go back and take the birth of those patriarchs when they were born by those woman and each one when the baby was born and the mother and labor added the voice of this patriarch positionally placed him in his place in Palestine hundreds of years later how can we put in confidence in this written word of God because it's so inspired and every phrase of it hangs together and it's drawing a picture of us what God was and what God is and always will be now we find out when Joshua divide the inheritance of the people each person was placed positionally exactly the way these Hebrew mothers name those children how they were placed in Palestine just at their place ash again net Faline each one Judah every one had placed in their position what wonderful picture it gets us because of the type of God placing in the church himself every member every stone every place every Christian to itself each one of us in our particular peculiar way has a place in the house of God like Solomon's Temple when it was cut out all around the world but when it was brought in to Joppa Florida it took there by oxcart and these odd rocks had their place when the temple went together we are being previous led to a place hallelujah and he says Alba trophy let's go back don't mind reading a bit more I will betroth thee unto me and faithfulness now thou shalt know the Lord and it shall come to pass in that day I will hear saith the Lord I'll hear the heavens know hear the earth and the earth shall hear the corn and and the wine and the oil they shall hedge Israel and I'll sew her unto me in the earth there speaking of a woman I'm gonna apply the woman in the earth Alleluia that's you by the way and them in the earth and I will have mercy upon her that had not obtained mercy and I'll say to them that were not my people thou art my people and they shall say thou art my god the speaking of a Gentile people because because when Hosea was not speaking this Israel we were not the people of God we were Gentiles not even in the economy of God I mean but when God before the foundation of the world when he looked down and says I'm going to have a bride I'm going to have a people made in my image I mean he wasn't just looking at the Jewish people he was looking at you he's looking at Gentile people and they and and I'll have mercy upon her that had not obtained mercy and I'll say to them which were not my people without my people and they shall say thou art my god hallelujah amen so now here we are here we are friends I'll give you a position I'll give you this valley of Achor as a door of Hope a door of expectation this will be part of your position hallelujah I mean that whatever happened in the past when you came into the land that's been done away with I want to have a Jubilee hello I want to rejoice I mean you say well I stumbled and fell it's been done away with I give you this position saith the Lord that you would know that everything's been done away with assumes been dealt with that you can advise and take the whole and helu you amen glory to God hello there yeah we have some musicians please you say well what is this got to do with me this is your walk don't let the past hold you back don't let your past hold you back if God doesn't remember it why should you I mean the devil is actually a very bad historian I have said in the past he's a good historian because it loves to remind you of what happened but he only takes you to a certain point he never takes you to the point where he was cast out he never takes you to the point where he was defeated he never takes you to the point where you stood up and faith when your eyes came open I mean were you no longer a slave Amy but now you are the head and not the tail I mean he never takes you to the point where you chased him out and then when you stood up and took the Word of God amen and cast him out of your family hallelujah was filled with the Holy Ghost he never takes you to that point hallelujah see the bad historian I mean so friends we no longer slaves he wants you to take the fullness of this word I mean it's weird not me to just sit back and say well this is good enough take the whole inheritance I mean we're not cool just to take some denominational idea if this is how things are who says this is how things should be in terms of well this is my walk and this is how God works and this is it we get him all worked out that's just big denominational I mean God was reveal more of himself I think even we want to accept them amen this is what let's let's sing um I want to sing our God is tremendous hello yeah no they see can we first thing that song everything's open all these chains broken and the Apostles they had to come to a point they had to realize you know God is more than we even recognize Peter Peter the messages of the first stage he had God will worked out with in a seminary idea and then God came down says I'm very different to what you think I am and he handed us ritual in he had us form I me but then God came and revealed himself and he realized I mean the God he thought he was a worshipping wasn't the God he has been to be worshiping I meant [Music] other Jeremy after this we'll pray I think can you lead some songs because this thing doesn't work anymore aren't you glad he doesn't want us just to sit just after Jarek are the words come up and there's no sitting part of the land and get cozy he says I'm gonna give me this place as a position I mean he can look back insights that worth I'm going
