[18:25] seated god bless you now I want to I
[18:32] want to go into something I won't I'm
[18:36] not going to pick it up on sunday cuz
[18:38] there's still a few things on insults
[18:41] Song of Solomon chapter 2 that I want to
[18:43] speak on but I was really pondering this
[18:46] past past couple of weeks that you know
[18:49] this there's so much that has happened
[18:51] in this day now that we that you know
[18:53] that we live in and really if you look
[18:57] at all the all the church ages from from
[18:59] from the first church age all the way
[19:02] down to this church age if you look at
[19:05] all the scripture that's been fulfilled
[19:08] most of us been fulfilled in this in
[19:10] this generation that we're alive in and
[19:13] I wanted to maybe maybe just just go
[19:16] into these things and maybe a little bit
[19:19] of detail that we could really you know
[19:23] really maybe not only just appreciate
[19:26] what we have but also mainly more
[19:28] emphasized what is going on and what we
[19:32] have what the enemy is doing but not
[19:34] only what he's doing but what God is
[19:36] doing yeah because we live in an
[19:38] incredible time where you know we see so
[19:41] much scripture you know being fulfilled
[19:43] you know if we just go to this is going
[19:47] to be a bit of an overview service but I
[19:48] just want to just just just go through a
[19:51] list of things like if we go for example
[19:53] 22 revelations chapter 13 and and we go
[20:00] down to verse 11 now it says here so we
[20:06] won't read it a save time but we'll go
[20:08] on to it later but the first part of
[20:12] Revelation is 13 it speaks of it speaks
[20:15] of the Beast that was wounded that was
[20:17] healed at all the world worshipped it
[20:19] and that power of course as the it's a
[20:22] political power but it's the Roman
[20:24] Catholic Church
[20:25] but then it has the next part and I just
[20:27] wanted to write because this is
[20:29] interesting because it says I beheld
[20:31] another beast coming out of the earth
[20:33] emember remember what we're reading here
[20:36] is symbolic and so in the in the book of
[20:39] Revelation that says that water's our
[20:42] peoples nations multitudes of yo of
[20:45] people so earth as a place where it's
[20:47] not really that inhabited and so there's
[20:50] another beast coming out of the earth so
[20:52] this piece of speaking of is a is
[20:53] actually a nation because it's a
[20:55] political animal okay and he had two
[20:59] horns like a lamb and he spake as a
[21:02] dragon now we have this so so this
[21:08] nation that's come out of a place it's
[21:09] not very densely populated this beast is
[21:12] coming out the earth this is actually
[21:14] the United States of America and and he
[21:18] had to logg two horns like a lamb and he
[21:21] spake as a dragon so these two horns are
[21:25] the it's it's the horn speakers of a
[21:28] palace of two horns its its its civil
[21:31] and ecclesiastical power so civil
[21:33] government power and ecclesiastical
[21:35] which is religious power so so it had
[21:38] two horns like a lamb so it was like a
[21:40] lamb but it wasn't a lamb and they found
[21:42] it they found it America on the freedom
[21:44] of religion that's why the Pilgrim
[21:46] Fathers they left the old workers are
[21:48] being persecuted the other Puritans so
[21:51] they moved to the new world to escape
[21:53] the persecution that was in the old
[21:55] world so a lamb it speaks of religion of
[21:57] speaks of freedom of religion they meant
[22:00] so it was so it was a nation founded and
[22:03] and and the purpose of that founding was
[22:07] a freedom of religion where the
[22:08] denominations of the old world that
[22:11] control the true worship of God and
[22:13] that's how America was really founded so
[22:17] it had two horns like a lamb and now
[22:19] brother brahim says that this being like
[22:22] lamb it's actually that's actually and I
[22:24] don't have the quote just saw me but he
[22:25] says it he says it's their Buffalo you
[22:28] know you know the Buffalo that they're
[22:30] you know that roams the prairies espeak
[22:32] you that is watched actually this
[22:33] animals it's a buffalo and and he spake
[22:37] as
[22:38] dragon so to speak as someone it's like
[22:41] a further convinces you have you said
[22:43] something and then I repeated basically
[22:45] what you said i'll be speaking as
[22:47] brother cabin because I'm just repeating
[22:49] what he's saying and so initially
[22:51] America never never ever would would
[22:54] would unite with Rome even you see like
[22:57] great presidents like I think I think it
[23:01] was eisenhower and if you're there other
[23:02] early ones they would not bow down and
[23:05] they would not you know have a meeting
[23:07] with the Pope and kisses ring and you'd
[23:08] all these things but you see that wasn't
[23:12] that long ago but then when Pope John
[23:14] Paul passes away there's a picture and
[23:16] there's there's there's the two george
[23:18] bush senior and junior and there was
[23:20] another president and there was Bill
[23:22] Clinton all former presidents and their
[23:23] kneeling down and you know in front of
[23:26] in front of his body praying that the
[23:30] Pope's funeral so there's been a massive
[23:32] massive shift from where one time the
[23:35] president would never ever go and do
[23:37] such a thing there's all these former
[23:38] presidents they're basically paying
[23:40] homage to this man who's dead and the
[23:43] very very nation that they are actually
[23:45] the head of was founded by fleeing that
[23:48] power and so so comes a time because
[23:53] remember we read scriptures like this
[23:55] and sometimes we just think it's like a
[23:57] narrative this happens in this happens
[23:58] and this happens but this the scripture
[24:02] actually it doesn't you know there's a
[24:06] there's a gulf of time and i'll show you
[24:08] in the scripture how this is so there's
[24:10] a gulf of time between it had two horns
[24:13] like a lamb and he spake as a dragon
[24:16] that's why there's a comma there is
[24:17] actually a golf and time between these
[24:19] two things and so now America now is
[24:22] speaking as the same as the as the
[24:24] Vatican speaks it's saying the same
[24:27] things because they're they've become
[24:29] allies but there was a time where they
[24:32] weren't allies now I'm going to show you
[24:37] in the scripture just quickly or yeah
[24:39] it's like you see this principle if we
[24:41] go to Luke chapter 4
[24:52] if we're going to Luke chapter 4 and
[24:56] we're going to read the scripture here
[24:58] with Jesus in the synagogue and he gets
[25:01] handed the book so if you go to Luke
[25:03] chapter 4 verse 16 and then we're going
[25:08] to read then we're going to read where
[25:14] where there's actually quoted from Sony
[25:17] came to Nazareth where he had been
[25:19] brought up and as his custom was he went
[25:22] into the synagogue on the Sabbath day
[25:23] stood up for to read and there was
[25:26] delivered under the book of the prophet
[25:27] Isaiah and when he had opened the book
[25:31] he found the place where it was written
[25:33] so so Jesus searched out this and he and
[25:35] he's quoting it now the Spirit of the
[25:37] Lord is upon me because he has anointed
[25:39] me to preach the gospel to the poor he
[25:43] has sent me to heal the brokenhearted to
[25:45] preach deliverance to the captives and
[25:47] recovering of the sight to the blind to
[25:49] set at liberty them that are bruised to
[25:52] preach the acceptable year of the Lord
[25:54] and he closed the book and he gave it
[25:56] again to the minister and sat down and
[25:58] the eyes of all then there in the
[26:00] synagogue were fasted on him and he
[26:02] began to say unto them this day the
[26:04] scriptures fulfilled in your ears okay
[26:07] but now if we go back to eyes go back to
[26:10] the Book of Isaiah and I believe that
[26:15] it's chapter 61 so this is this is the
[26:20] we're going to read what Jesus quoted
[26:33] okay so as I 61 and verse 1 so this is
[26:37] what he found to read the sprue the Lord
[26:40] God is upon me because the LORD hath
[26:43] anointed me to preach good tidings unto
[26:46] the meek he has sent me to bind up the
[26:48] brokenhearted to proclaim Liberty to the
[26:51] captives and the opening of the prison's
[26:54] of them that are bound to proclaim the
[26:58] acceptable year of the Lord now that's
[27:00] as far as he read but that's not the
[27:02] whole verse and the day of vengeance of
[27:04] our God to comfort all that morn so you
[27:08] see Jesus when he read he didn't make a
[27:10] mistake because the word never makes a
[27:12] mistake he was the Word made flesh he
[27:14] never made a mistake so when he found
[27:16] that in the book of Isaiah he
[27:17] deliberately stopped reading halfway
[27:21] through verse 2 he deliberately did it
[27:25] so what he was doing as he is actually
[27:28] showing that that first part of verse 2
[27:32] he was fulfilling that in the days of
[27:34] his flesh but then that second part was
[27:38] to be fulfilled at a second coming
[27:41] because the day of vengeance of our God
[27:43] that speaks of the day of the Lord the
[27:46] Great Tribulation terrible that's going
[27:48] to be that wasn't when he came the first
[27:50] time that would happen when he comes the
[27:52] second time CC he deliberately split you
[27:55] know split the scripture but if we just
[27:57] read that without understanding that we
[28:00] would think that that is all connected
[28:02] together at the same time you following
[28:05] me so but but we can see here there's at
[28:09] least the others 2,000 year gap between
[28:12] the first part of verse 2 in the second
[28:14] part of verse 2 so so so there's a gulf
[28:17] of time it's all the same word but
[28:20] there's a gulf of time between it being
[28:21] fulfilled and it's the same way we read
[28:24] there in Revelations 13 is it was a gulf
[28:26] of time not quite two thousand years
[28:28] about 200 odd years where where it's at
[28:32] weren't too had two horns like a lamb
[28:34] but then it's fake as the dragon yo now
[28:38] do you want to see it in one more place
[28:40] let's go to Luke chapter one
[28:50] even even even the scripture where it
[28:52] has commas it has you know punctuation
[28:55] all those things those things are put
[28:57] there for a reason it's not just for
[28:59] good English it's there for a reason
[29:04] okay so Luke chapter one and we'll just
[29:10] start reading from verse 13 so this is
[29:12] this is the angel of the Lord speaking
[29:14] to Zacharias which is the father of John
[29:16] the Baptist but the angel said unto them
[29:18] fear not Zacharias for thy prayer is
[29:20] heard and thy wife Elizabeth shall bear
[29:23] thee a son and thou shalt call his name
[29:25] John and thou shalt have joy and
[29:27] gladness and many shall rejoice at his
[29:29] birth for he shall be great in the sight
[29:31] of the Lord and shall drink neither wine
[29:33] nor strong drink and he shall be filled
[29:35] with the Holy Ghost even from his
[29:37] mother's womb and many of the children
[29:40] of Israel shall he turned to the Lord
[29:42] their God and he shall go before him in
[29:45] the spirit and power of Elias to turn
[29:47] the hearts of the father's to the
[29:49] children and the disobedient to the
[29:52] wisdom of the just to make ready a
[29:54] people prepared for the Lord now that's
[29:58] it now we just read there in verse 17 he
[30:00] shall go before him in the spirit and
[30:03] power of Elias to turn the hearts of the
[30:05] father's to the children okay now if we
[30:09] go to melt go keep your finger there and
[30:11] we're going to go to Malachi 4
[30:21] now I know this is a very familiar
[30:25] scripture to us all so we'll go to verse
[30:29] 5 of Malachi form is going to show you
[30:31] how this this is speaking of two comings
[30:33] of Elijah the scripture split as well
[30:35] behold i'll send you elijah the prophet
[30:37] before the coming of the Great and
[30:39] dreadful day of the Lord and she he
[30:42] shall turn the heart of the father's to
[30:44] the children and the heart of the
[30:46] children to their fathers least I come
[30:49] and smite the earth with a curse now we
[30:51] read there in Luke chapter 1 verse 17 he
[30:55] shall turn the hearts of the father's to
[30:57] the children but there's no talk the
[31:00] angel never says that John the Baptist
[31:01] was going to turn the hearts of the
[31:03] children to the father's yep because
[31:06] that is speaking of a another Elijah
[31:08] ministry so God Himself an angel now a
[31:12] true angel never a true messenger a true
[31:17] angel does not miss quite the word yep
[31:20] so we have here that the angel speaking
[31:23] to Zechariah he actually split Malachi
[31:26] for there shall turn the hearts of the
[31:29] father's to the children and that was
[31:31] exactly what he is doing because he
[31:33] wasn't turning them back to the faith of
[31:35] the fathers which was Moses he was
[31:37] turning them from that faith of what
[31:39] they had made of that faith to receive
[31:41] Christ yeah so so there was there was
[31:45] two thousand years between the first
[31:48] part of Malachi to the second part of
[31:51] Malachi amen but we we would just read
[31:55] it we just think it's all one event but
[31:58] there was two different ministries and
[32:01] then we can further Caesar see this if
[32:04] we're if we're going down this way we'll
[32:06] go to we'll go to Matthew chapter 11
[32:17] and they will go to be civil
[32:23] and as they departed Jesus began to say
[32:26] to the multitudes concerning John what
[32:28] went ye out into the wilderness to see a
[32:30] reed shaken with the wind but what went
[32:33] ye out for to see a man clothed in soft
[32:35] raiment the whole day that we're soft
[32:36] clothing are in Kings houses but what
[32:38] went ye out for to see a prophet yeah
[32:41] son to you more than a prophet for this
[32:43] is he of whom has written behold I say
[32:45] my messenger before thy face and he
[32:47] shall prepare thy way before me bill I
[32:49] said to you among them that are born of
[32:51] the woman of women there's has not risen
[32:55] a greater than John the Baptist not with
[32:57] standing he that is least in the kingdom
[33:00] is greater than he that was keep reading
[33:04] and for the days of John the baptism
[33:06] until now the kingdom of heaven
[33:08] suffereth violence and the violent take
[33:10] it by force for all the prophets and the
[33:13] law prophesied under John for if you
[33:15] will receive it this is elias which was
[33:18] for to come he that hath ears to hear
[33:21] let him hear so Jesus himself was saying
[33:23] he came in the spirit of Elijah and in
[33:26] that even even that that verse verse 10
[33:30] behold hace mi mission before thy face
[33:33] he shall prepare the way before thee
[33:34] that was Malachi 3 and verse 1 but I
[33:37] just rent continue reading down because
[33:39] Jesus himself is saying that John came
[33:42] that was this is elias which was for to
[33:45] come and then now we'll go to Matthew
[33:48] chapter 17 and will read will read verse
[33:57] 10 he says now is everyone there yep and
[34:05] his disciples asked them saying why
[34:07] didn't say the scribes that the last
[34:09] must first come and jesus answered said
[34:11] unto them Elias truly shall come first
[34:13] and restore all things but i say to you
[34:16] that Elias has come already and they
[34:18] knew him not but I've done unto Him
[34:21] whatever they listed likewise shall also
[34:24] the sudden man suffer of them then the
[34:26] disciples understood that he spake unto
[34:28] them of John the Baptist so look he says
[34:31] he says a lie so verse 11 a loss truly
[34:35] shall come
[34:36] restore all things so he's going to come
[34:38] he shall come as it in the future he
[34:40] shall come and restore all things but i
[34:42] say to you that license come already and
[34:44] then you have not so they saying he had
[34:48] already come and that was John the
[34:49] Baptist but then here speaking of a
[34:51] future profit that would have the spirit
[34:53] of Elijah that would restore all things
[34:55] so he's talking about the took there's
[34:57] the two comings of Elijah he shall come
[35:00] and he's come he speaking of two
[35:02] different ministries yeah and that and
[35:05] that is all from you see how God can
[35:08] take a scripture he can split it in two
[35:10] and they can be for totally two
[35:12] different Cummings and even the book of
[35:14] Revelation sometimes we read it and we
[35:16] think this happens this happens this
[35:17] happens this happens but it's not all in
[35:19] order that way there's gulfs of time
[35:22] between even it as I showed you that one
[35:25] scripture there's two hundred-odd years
[35:26] between the first part of Scripture in
[35:29] the second part that's why it took a
[35:31] prophet to come and show us truly what
[35:33] is in the word because otherwise we
[35:35] would be you know stumbling around
[35:37] trying to work these things out for
[35:39] ourselves so now let's age that we have
[35:43] you know the short spin when when the
[35:46] lady accenture change that's why i read
[35:49] that read that there in Revelations
[35:51] three the short span of wind of when the
[35:54] Spirit of God was poured out in azusa
[35:56] street 1906 the gifts of the Spirit were
[35:58] restored and then now we're down a
[36:01] hundred and hundred and whatever years I
[36:04] can't do math right in 110 years from
[36:08] then to Nell and as they oh yeah you
[36:10] gotta got a nod that's that I can I can
[36:12] I can I can work that up a short space
[36:15] of 110 years there's been so much of the
[36:17] scripture being fulfilled if you look at
[36:20] it and these things had not happened in
[36:23] the first six Church changes you know we
[36:26] can see we can see in this age Satan has
[36:30] been enthroned as god of this world
[36:32] Jesus Christ has been thrown out of his
[36:34] church Jesus Christ the Son of man has
[36:36] been fully revealed like never before
[36:39] amen so and and the Catholic Church has
[36:43] pretty much consumed the whole earth I
[36:45] meant as an as an in control we're on
[36:48] the verge of a one world government
[36:50] which never would have happened there's
[36:51] been two hundred thousand thousand
[36:53] demons released a mint upon the earth as
[36:56] railsback as a nation the bride is
[36:59] taking her position Satan's churches
[37:02] taking her position I mean there's a lot
[37:04] of things that have happened these last
[37:06] hundred years that have never happened
[37:08] before and it's very important that we
[37:10] would look into them to understand where
[37:12] we are in the world because even just oh
[37:15] and they're very sorry i forgot to
[37:16] mention the very reason that we even
[37:19] went to Revelation 13 saying by the man
[37:21] saying it was a buffalo is because very
[37:23] recently in the last month the official
[37:26] animal of america is the buffalo amen
[37:32] you say well that's just clutching at
[37:33] straws no it's not brother Bram said it
[37:36] would be that way and then finally the
[37:39] Buffalo is now the official official
[37:41] animal of America I thought that I
[37:45] thought that's interesting we also have
[37:48] you know we have we have Protestantism
[37:51] and cat you know Catholicism dev United
[37:54] back together the World Council of
[37:56] Churches was not here a hundred years
[37:58] ago and now pretty much unless you you
[38:02] know we are very much in the minority
[38:06] Amen virtually every do not work no
[38:08] we're not denomination but if you look
[38:10] at Christianity as a whole all of its
[38:12] pretty much been swallowed up into that
[38:14] thing amen and so there's so many things
[38:19] that have happened and it's not just to
[38:22] mentally well you know mentally say well
[38:26] yes I understand how the Bible goes
[38:28] together but if you can really recognize
[38:31] where we are and not only you know and
[38:34] not only where we are what the enemy's
[38:37] doing I think you look at you yourself
[38:40] and you look at the world and you could
[38:43] in a totally different way if you could
[38:45] really grasp you know we had another
[38:48] thing you have this this age we've had
[38:51] we've had a prophetic ministry like
[38:53] never before has come upon the earth the
[38:57] man ages come to an end I'm just
[38:59] throwing these things out because I'm
[39:00] going to go to the greater detail as the
[39:02] lordly
[39:03] suppose one of you know there's been a
[39:04] change of dispensation endless H like
[39:07] never before amen it's like it's like
[39:11] when Jesus came jon was here rather the
[39:14] law was actually the blood of bulls and
[39:17] goats and the you know and the and the
[39:20] and the priesthood and the temple and
[39:23] all these things that have become
[39:24] ingrained into the Jewish Society those
[39:28] are things have been done away and they
[39:31] came a day you know like I'm yo hood I
[39:34] heard by the Isaacs sermon i watch that
[39:36] he had a had a picture of a missile
[39:38] coming out of the ground he sees it'll
[39:40] be a day like any other day and some you
[39:43] know and all these things will be
[39:45] released you know it wasn't they like in
[39:48] the other day when Jesus died the day
[39:50] like any other day when he was there was
[39:56] a day like any other day when when when
[39:58] when he the son of god Karen Elson up
[40:02] Calvary it was a day like many other
[40:03] days they had many executions they have
[40:06] many crucifixions but that day was very
[40:09] different kind of day because that they
[40:11] know the way into the Holy of Holies was
[40:13] going to be declared I'm in the you know
[40:16] I heard brother Bram saying availing of
[40:18] God the the real mercy seat was hanging
[40:21] in plain view on Calvary here is the
[40:22] mercy seat and then the day before that
[40:26] you could take a lamb to the priest and
[40:28] you'd be justified the day after that
[40:31] you take a lamb to the priesthood do you
[40:32] no good it was a big change had just
[40:36] happened but other day like any other
[40:37] day amen and so and then and then so
[40:42] they continue doing what they are doing
[40:44] but God had had had turned a corner and
[40:46] change what he was doing and it's the
[40:49] same thing in this day oh oh I'll put it
[40:53] bluntly there was a time when you could
[40:56] go to denomination and you could receive
[40:58] eternal life then they rejected the
[41:00] source of eternal life and you can go to
[41:03] now I'm not talking now when I say this
[41:06] I'm talking about going in a rapture
[41:08] eternal life I'm talking about becoming
[41:10] the bride of Christ eternal life I'm not
[41:13] talking about white throne judgment
[41:14] eternal life because we don't have a
[41:16] Church that we'd go to white throne
[41:18] judgment we we've gathered around this
[41:21] revealed word that would go to rapture
[41:23] that is the reason we've gathered not
[41:25] nothing I am tamiya this is my heart of
[41:29] any one of us go to the white throne
[41:30] judgment I feel like I failed amen
[41:34] because we're not here to go to weather
[41:36] and judgment week here for a body change
[41:38] we've heard this word because we're
[41:40] going to receive a new body I mean
[41:43] there's something in us that is
[41:44] responded to this word because there is
[41:46] a new body for us amen so so I'm not
[41:51] talking about receiving eternal life the
[41:54] way their own judgment I'm talking about
[41:55] going in the rapture so there was a time
[41:58] where people could be in a denomination
[42:00] and they could become one of the Bride
[42:02] of Christ and so therefore they would be
[42:04] in the rapture but there came a time
[42:06] when they rejected Christ and there's no
[42:09] resurrection for a rapture and
[42:12] denomination anymore that may sound
[42:14] pretty pretty strong but it's just like
[42:17] the first coming of Christ the lamb the
[42:21] lamb the blood of lamb cover their sins
[42:23] but then it came the next day the blood
[42:26] didn't do any good because the real
[42:29] blood was shed on Calvary they came a
[42:31] time because but because they rejected
[42:33] him pilot awesome should I release you
[42:37] Barabbas or Jesus and they said give us
[42:41] Barabbas give us this murderer what
[42:44] should I do with this one called the
[42:45] Christ crucify him will not have this
[42:48] man rule over us amen and so there he
[42:52] came to his own and his own received him
[42:54] not yeah so now and it happened again in
[43:01] this day where Jesus is behold I stand
[43:04] at door knock and that is not some
[43:09] people take that text and they say
[43:11] that's Jesus knock you on your heart
[43:12] because he wants to come in and to a
[43:15] degree that is true but that's not the
[43:16] full truth of that scripture it is that
[43:18] he's on the outside of the church world
[43:20] trying to get back in because they
[43:23] rejected him and they and they because
[43:27] they held on to their creeds and dogmas
[43:29] and man's ideas
[43:30] and they rejected the truth and that's
[43:34] why he was rejected just like when he
[43:36] came the first time they held on to
[43:37] their traditions of the fathers the
[43:39] traditions they had and they rejected
[43:42] the Prince of life and they thrust them
[43:44] out and they killed him so he comes a
[43:49] time and it's already come where to go
[43:52] on a rapture to go on a rapture now you
[43:55] won't find that you won't find that at a
[43:58] denomination but you'll find it where
[44:01] Jesus is now let's go to first John 17 I
[44:07] want to probably lay this principle in
[44:09] and then we'll see here we go I've been
[44:14] listening to brother Lonnie's bible
[44:16] study series as well but i don't want to
[44:19] repeat what he said but i want to kill
[44:21] her in the picture a bit more so and so
[44:30] this is now why you could say oh that's
[44:32] so shocking how could you say there's no
[44:34] rapture for those people they're good
[44:35] people absolutely but there's a
[44:38] principle in the scripture that people
[44:41] forget and this is the principal first
[44:45] John and we'll just read from verse 5 no
[44:50] verse 3 that which we have seen and
[44:53] heard declare we unto you that ye also
[44:57] may have fellowship with us and truly
[45:00] our Fellowship is with the father and
[45:02] with a son Jesus Christ and these things
[45:05] right we unto you that your joy may be
[45:07] full this then is the message which we
[45:11] have heard of him and declare unto you
[45:14] that God is light and in him is no
[45:17] darkness at all if we say then we have
[45:23] fellowship with him and walk in darkness
[45:25] we lie and do not the truth and then
[45:31] that do not the truth and my imagine
[45:33] that means practice not the truth but if
[45:35] we walk in the light as he is in the
[45:39] light we have fellowship one with
[45:41] another and the blood of Jesus
[45:44] I says son cleanses us from all sin if
[45:47] we say we have not sinned we deceive
[45:50] ourselves and the truth is not in US if
[45:51] we confess our sins he is faithful and
[45:54] just to forgive us our sins and to
[45:57] cleanse us from all unrighteousness if
[46:00] we say that we have not sinned we make
[46:04] him a liar and as word is not in US this
[46:08] is a very important principle because
[46:10] John is saying if we walk in the light
[46:12] remember there's a qualifier but if we
[46:16] walk in the light as he is in the light
[46:19] then we have fellowship one with another
[46:21] which is us and God and the blood of
[46:24] Jesus Christ His Son cleanses us from Al
[46:29] elson so in order to be cleansed from
[46:33] all sin you got to walk in the light
[46:37] amen so if you take the opposite of that
[46:41] if you do not walk in the light as he is
[46:43] in the light you don't have true
[46:45] Fellowship you would God and it doesn't
[46:48] cleanse you from all sin yeah this is
[46:52] very important because every church
[46:55] every Church under heaven they would say
[46:59] do you believe you if we ask them do you
[47:01] believe in Jesus dying on the cross all
[47:03] of Christendom would say absolutely and
[47:05] then you'd go to maybe some more I don't
[47:09] know I don't know about the Catholic
[47:10] being go to the vast majority and say
[47:12] well have you accepted him as personal
[47:14] Savior absolutely they would say do you
[47:17] believe that the blood of Jesus Christ
[47:19] was enough to cleanse you from your son
[47:21] absolutely do you believe he died for
[47:24] you on Calvary I'd say absolutely yeah
[47:27] we would all we would all but it's only
[47:29] pointing to an a historical event a
[47:32] meant by one offering here sanctified he
[47:36] has perfected them forever that are
[47:38] sanctified so it was done and you have
[47:41] to believe he died on the cross for you
[47:42] don't get me wrong you must believe he
[47:44] did a mint but then what enables you to
[47:48] receive what he did for you amen now I
[47:53] hope this comes out alright so for
[47:56] example
[47:57] if an order to receive what he did based
[48:01] on the scripture we must walk in the
[48:03] light amen so two people can say they
[48:08] genuinely believe in Calvary but if one
[48:11] is not walking in the light then they do
[48:13] not receive what happened on Calvary and
[48:15] its fullness yeah because that's the way
[48:19] that's the reason that's the reason that
[48:22] the bride doesn't go on a tribulation
[48:24] because the bride there's no sin in the
[48:28] bride she is cleansed from all sin he
[48:32] dwells in his bride she is part of him
[48:35] yep she is part of him she is sinless so
[48:40] there's nothing here that can hold her
[48:42] when the body change happens yeah
[48:45] because the tribulation the Tribulation
[48:49] Period is a whole purging nature is
[48:52] purged amen Israel is purged the world
[48:56] is purged yeah because it because it's a
[48:59] great because the judgments of God are
[49:01] poured out upon the earth and its
[49:02] fullness there's a judgment being taking
[49:05] place and so the church that goes into
[49:09] that they receive that judgment as well
[49:12] because they're in this earth amen but
[49:15] then if he took our judgment on Calvary
[49:18] then why would why would if he took our
[49:21] judgment there then why would we go to a
[49:23] place to receive judgment and the Great
[49:26] Tribulation the only reason that would
[49:29] be is that the people have it fully
[49:32] received what he did on the Calvary for
[49:35] you and so if that is the case so what
[49:41] happens then is that there's people the
[49:44] reason people go and to the great enter
[49:47] the tribulation is because they're not
[49:50] fully walking in the light amen they
[49:54] haven't totally become one with him
[49:57] that's why that's why people you know
[50:01] that's why it's essential No is that
[50:04] clear this is like a Bible study done
[50:06] that make sense a mint because why would
[50:09] God fully pay for our
[50:11] you know why power sundeck clean
[50:13] annihilate anything held against us and
[50:15] then send us into a judgment time why
[50:17] would he do that doesn't make any sense
[50:19] you know so if he if he paid for our if
[50:22] he took our judgment on Calvary the
[50:24] wrath of God was poured out upon Jesus
[50:26] Christ the man there on Calvary if that
[50:29] was poured out for you upon him he
[50:31] became me he took my place I mean that
[50:34] you know that I could be sinless if that
[50:39] happened then why would he send me into
[50:41] a time when the world is judged amen but
[50:45] the only reason I would a people would
[50:47] end up there yet believing in Jesus is
[50:50] because they're not walking in the light
[50:53] amen now we're going to find out what
[50:56] this light is because it's not some
[50:57] airy-fairy thing it's a very concrete
[51:00] thing in the scripture so we'll go to
[51:01] the book of John
[51:11] and I believe it now we got a chapter
[51:17] five we're going to read this member
[51:25] John with yo we just read it in in two
[51:28] places three places John was sent to
[51:33] prepare the way the Lord the scribes and
[51:36] Pharisees went to him and they said who
[51:39] are you are you the crisis is now I'm
[51:41] not and they said who are you says I'm
[51:42] the one crying in the wilderness to
[51:45] prepare the way which is from Isaiah I
[51:47] think chapter forty he was directly
[51:49] quoting The Book of Isaiah saying this
[51:52] is me yep so John John was fulfilled
[51:57] scripture he was fulfilling his part of
[51:59] the word yep I'll go to verse 33 and
[52:04] John five he sent done to John and he
[52:07] bear witness under the truth but i
[52:10] received not testimony for a man but
[52:13] these things I say that you might be
[52:15] saved he was a burning and a shining
[52:18] light and you were willing for a season
[52:21] to rejoice in his light but I have a
[52:24] greater witness and that of John for the
[52:26] works which the father have given me to
[52:28] finish the same works that I do bear
[52:31] witness of me that the father has sent
[52:34] me so Jesus saying that he was a great
[52:38] he was a burning and shining light and
[52:40] you're willing for a season to rejoice
[52:43] in his life what was john i said it yeah
[52:45] yeah i've already given you answer John
[52:47] was a scripture being loved out he was
[52:50] the fulfillment of the scripture so
[52:53] whenever the word has manifested because
[52:56] he was he was Isaiah 40 the voice of one
[52:59] crying in the wilderness he was that
[53:01] word made manifest he was the one to
[53:04] prepare the way the Lord Malachi 3 verse
[53:07] 1 he was that word made manifest he was
[53:09] the first part of Malachi 4 we read to
[53:12] turn the hearts of the father's to the
[53:13] children he was that word made manifest
[53:16] so when the word has made manifest it is
[53:19] light yep so when the word has made
[53:22] manifest it is light
[53:24] and that's why Jesus said he is a
[53:27] burning and shining light and you're
[53:29] willing for a season to rejoice in his
[53:32] light because they are rejoicing because
[53:34] it says in the scriptures as many as
[53:37] received John's baptism they received
[53:39] Jesus amen because they were there
[53:43] rejoicing in and in the light that John
[53:46] gave which was a so if you received now
[53:49] here's a principle whenever God does
[53:53] something that is light yep so when
[53:57] Moses came it was light you could say
[54:00] you could take this same same scripture
[54:03] and you could apply it to Moses he Moses
[54:06] was a burning and shining light yeah he
[54:09] was because he was the deliverer that
[54:11] would come he was that part of the
[54:13] fulfillment of the prophecy God gave
[54:15] Abraham how their seed with sojourn in a
[54:18] strange land 400 years I've inflicted
[54:21] then that be brought out with a mighty
[54:22] hand into the Promised Land there was a
[54:25] prophecy so when Moses went God
[54:28] Commission moses god says in Exodus
[54:31] chapter 3 i've i've heard the cries of
[54:33] my people i am come down and says behold
[54:37] i send you so God promised Abraham I'll
[54:41] deliver them with a mighty hand what
[54:43] what did he use he used a man to deliver
[54:46] his people so he came down he came down
[54:50] I could say n Moses to deliver his
[54:52] people from Egypt and take them to the
[54:54] promised land amen and all the people
[54:56] that rejoiced in his life because he was
[54:59] the Word made manifest they receive
[55:02] salvation from the from the from the
[55:05] afflictions of of Egypt they receive
[55:08] deliverance from the from the whoops and
[55:10] the mud pits and all these things now
[55:12] I've delivered out of that and now we'll
[55:13] take it up into the Promised Land amen
[55:16] so they receive deliverance by receiving
[55:19] that but then but then now what happens
[55:24] is that every generation God does
[55:26] something they meant so God so and and
[55:31] it's up to the people of that generation
[55:32] to believe in what God is doing in that
[55:35] generation amen it's not
[55:38] enough just to believe in a historical
[55:40] god yo but you must believe those six
[55:43] but it's not just enough to believe a
[55:45] historical God you have to believe what
[55:47] he's doing in your day amen and because
[55:52] because if every generation they had
[55:56] that challenge you know because the
[55:59] challenge in Moses's day wasn't wasn't
[56:03] just believing that they were going to
[56:05] be taken out of Egypt too I mean you're
[56:07] taking out of Egypt into the Promised
[56:09] Land speaking of Israel when those
[56:10] slaves the challenge was is this the man
[56:12] to do it is this the one that's been
[56:15] commissioned and as I say you know and
[56:17] there was always when when challenges
[56:19] rose up like Quora Nathan and the
[56:21] wilderness the challenge was not against
[56:24] we're going into the land the challenge
[56:26] was it gets Moses amen the challenge was
[56:29] against Moses and then and then so all
[56:33] the trials came because it even says and
[56:36] I don't have the scripture off the top
[56:38] of my head but God even says to Moses he
[56:41] says he says I'm going to get the people
[56:43] to that the people would believe you I
[56:46] meant because the people had to believe
[56:48] Moses because they didn't believe Moses
[56:52] they weren't going to sit down and
[56:53] listen to what he said and they were
[56:54] going to act upon it yes so the
[56:56] challenge so the children that day was
[56:59] not just to believe yes God wrote to our
[57:01] told our father Abraham we're going to
[57:03] leave this place one day the challenge
[57:05] was was Moses the man to do the job was
[57:08] Moses the ones fulfilling that scripture
[57:10] to take us out and then now you come to
[57:13] John the Baptist you know the scribes
[57:15] and Pharisees believe the Book of Isaiah
[57:16] but then when it was fulfilled I'm the
[57:19] voice of one crying in the wilderness
[57:20] could they believe that amen because
[57:24] just having a historical God is no good
[57:26] you must have a present they got ya and
[57:29] then when Jesus came they believed
[57:32] Isaiah 9 a virgin shall conceive they
[57:35] all believe that but then when it
[57:37] happened it's a very different thing
[57:40] amen and then now when the when the when
[57:43] the Apostles are in the yarn 120 there
[57:46] in the upper room the Spirit of God
[57:47] fills them like the promise was and then
[57:50] Peter says the
[57:51] is that spoken by the Prophet Joel I'll
[57:54] pull my spirit out upon all flesh he's
[57:56] saying this scripture has been he could
[57:58] say this day this scripture has been
[58:00] fulfilled because because they were the
[58:02] fulfillment of Joel's prophecy for that
[58:05] day and then so the challenge was could
[58:08] they believe and receive now what had
[58:10] happened yeah so they had to receive the
[58:13] people had to receive that and then and
[58:16] then you even come if we go to if we go
[58:19] to Acts chapter 18 we have a group of
[58:26] people here that only have the baptism
[58:30] of John but by the time Paul comes and
[58:33] speaks to them John has come and gone
[58:36] Jesus is come and God the Holy Ghost is
[58:41] poured out and these people actually
[58:43] living in the past they don't know that
[58:46] God has moved on now we're going to read
[58:50] from verse actually the end of X 18 or
[58:52] even verse 24 and a certain Jew named
[58:56] the Paullus now we're going to see these
[58:58] people are Christian people I'll show
[59:00] you bought at Alexandria an eloquent man
[59:03] in a mighty in the scriptures came to
[59:05] Ephesus this man was instructed in the
[59:07] way of the Lord and being fervent in the
[59:09] spirit e spake and taught diligently the
[59:11] things of the Lord knowing only the
[59:13] baptism of John and he began to speak
[59:16] boldly in the synagogue whom when Aquila
[59:18] and Priscilla had heard they took him
[59:21] unto them and expounded unto Him the way
[59:23] of God more perfectly and when he was
[59:28] disposed to pass into acacia the
[59:30] Brethren rotek sorting the disciples to
[59:32] receive him who when he was come help
[59:34] them much which had believed through
[59:37] grace for he mightily convinced the Jews
[59:41] and that publicly showing by the
[59:43] scriptures that Jesus was Christ so here
[59:47] was someone who believed in Jesus yep
[59:50] but then if we got x 91 and it came to
[59:53] pass that while a pulse was at Corinth
[59:56] Paul having passed through the upper
[59:58] coast of Ephesus and finding certain
[1:00:01] disciples he said unto them have you
[1:00:03] received the Holy Ghost since you
[1:00:05] believed and they said unto Him we have
[1:00:08] not so much as heard whether it be any
[1:00:10] Holy Ghost and he said unto them unto
[1:00:12] what then were you baptized and they
[1:00:15] said under John's baptism then Paul then
[1:00:18] said Paul John veli baptized with the
[1:00:21] baptism of repentance saying under the
[1:00:24] people that they should believe on him
[1:00:26] what should come after him that is on
[1:00:29] Christ Jesus and when they heard this
[1:00:32] they were baptized in the name of the
[1:00:34] Lord Jesus and when Paul had laid his
[1:00:37] hands upon them and the Holy Ghost came
[1:00:40] on them and they spoke with tongues and
[1:00:43] prophesied and all the men were about 12
[1:00:48] so here was a group now you got to walk
[1:00:51] in the light as he is in the light
[1:00:53] there's principles all the way down
[1:00:55] through the scripture so here was a
[1:00:56] group of people they had received John's
[1:00:59] baptism they were preaching that Jesus
[1:01:02] was the Christ but they had missed the
[1:01:03] coming of the Holy Ghost they had missed
[1:01:06] a very purpose of Jesus ministry was
[1:01:08] that God might dwell in people once
[1:01:09] again and so now they had a choice they
[1:01:13] could have either rejected what Paul was
[1:01:15] saying saying this is some new
[1:01:17] fandangled thing I'll have nothing to do
[1:01:18] with it this is what we believe and they
[1:01:21] would have stayed in darkness because
[1:01:23] God had moved on or they could receive
[1:01:26] what God had done and got rebe apt eyes
[1:01:29] correctly and received the Holy Ghost
[1:01:31] and we read the end of the story
[1:01:33] they-they-they believes what Paul told
[1:01:36] them and they walked in the light as he
[1:01:38] is in the light amen and they received
[1:01:42] the Holy Ghost because if you truly if
[1:01:44] you're truly sealed into the kingdom
[1:01:46] that means that means now if you've been
[1:01:49] sealed into the kingdom God has has
[1:01:52] totally wiped out your past present and
[1:01:55] future send it amen if you're a finish
[1:01:58] work then there can be nothing in your
[1:02:00] future that can be held against you I
[1:02:02] mean because God doesn't seal you into
[1:02:05] the kingdom just to unseal you if you do
[1:02:07] something wrong that's not how it works
[1:02:09] he seals you in and you're sealed unto
[1:02:12] the day of your Redemption Amen see your
[1:02:15] finished work and you just basically
[1:02:16] grow
[1:02:17] going and maturing in the Lord until
[1:02:19] these atoms are changed hallelujah amen
[1:02:23] of course you're still here yeah I think
[1:02:24] I've gone over before there's a
[1:02:26] difference between capital s I NS kept
[1:02:29] unbelief and then little sis sins which
[1:02:33] are like you know as it's in a first
[1:02:36] shot if we confess our sins he's
[1:02:37] faithful and just to forgive us so the
[1:02:39] things we probably do wrong every day
[1:02:41] but if we confess them to him than his
[1:02:42] faithful and just to forgive us amen so
[1:02:46] then so if we're sealed into the kingdom
[1:02:50] then God has already wiped he doesn't
[1:02:53] attribute our past present or future
[1:02:55] since or unbelief that we had against us
[1:03:00] amen brother Graham says now we went God
[1:03:04] sees a believer he doesn't see the
[1:03:06] believer he sees the blood of the Lamb
[1:03:08] he just sees it he just hears a voice
[1:03:11] coming through the blood Oh were you so
[1:03:15] he doesn't see you he sees he sees the
[1:03:18] blood and he just hears your voice go
[1:03:20] through the blood Amy I'm glad that
[1:03:22] that's true amen so they had the
[1:03:26] challenge now would they walk in the
[1:03:29] light as he is on the light because even
[1:03:32] now if we go back to X chapter 9 and
[1:03:36] then we'll quickly go we'll go to the
[1:03:40] book of Revelation which got to accept
[1:03:41] and I'm very quickly and we'll go to
[1:03:45] verse 15 but this is after so X 9 is
[1:03:49] when when Paul meets Paul meets the Lord
[1:03:53] on the road to Damascus and he gets
[1:03:54] converted and then now this is the Lord
[1:03:57] speaking to entice who was meant to go
[1:04:00] and pray for Paul that he had receivers
[1:04:04] site and baptize them and so forth I
[1:04:06] believe it's and he says here actually
[1:04:10] no just pray from it that he would
[1:04:12] receive a site and in the Lord towels
[1:04:14] towels Ananias because it in i sighs but
[1:04:17] Lord is persecuted many in Jerusalem
[1:04:19] he's an enemy of your people but then
[1:04:21] the Lord tells them but the Lord said
[1:04:23] unto him go thy way for he is a chosen
[1:04:26] vessel unto me to be a my name before
[1:04:28] the Gentiles and kings and the show
[1:04:31] of Israel for I will show him how great
[1:04:34] things he must suffer for my name's sake
[1:04:37] so Paul was now a chosen vessel to take
[1:04:40] his name the name of the Lord before the
[1:04:43] Gentiles kings and children of Israel
[1:04:45] and then Paul writes in the book of I
[1:04:48] come every was first a second
[1:04:50] Corinthians this is them that a
[1:04:52] spiritual among you let them acknowledge
[1:04:54] that the things are right unto you they
[1:04:57] are the commandments of the Lord amen so
[1:05:01] then Paul Paul this is in a few places
[1:05:03] he he received a dispensation of the
[1:05:06] gospel a dispensation of the gospel is
[1:05:08] committed to him so word for an age
[1:05:11] seven Church ages was committed to Paul
[1:05:14] amen because all the all the true
[1:05:18] believers depending upon how it's light
[1:05:21] now given through the ages at all tied
[1:05:23] back to what Paul said this was his in
[1:05:26] Galatians 1 if an angel if we or an
[1:05:29] angel teach you any other gospel that
[1:05:31] which you ever received let him be
[1:05:32] accursed and even repeats it again so
[1:05:36] what Paul said was the foundation and
[1:05:39] every true messenger depending on the
[1:05:41] light that they received well it will
[1:05:43] dovetail with what Paul said amen so
[1:05:47] that's why pulsing and in bed
[1:05:49] Corinthians the things that I write unto
[1:05:52] you there were two spiritual link them
[1:05:54] acknowledge they are the commandments of
[1:05:55] the Lord so there's a challenge now here
[1:05:58] comes a man and he's actually saying
[1:06:01] these letters are right to you they are
[1:06:03] the commandments of God if your
[1:06:05] spiritual you'll catch it that's what
[1:06:07] he's saying basically he's saying if
[1:06:09] your spiritual you'll acknowledge this
[1:06:11] is actually God riding this is not my
[1:06:13] idea this is God yeah so the people had
[1:06:17] a choice now they could say ah but we
[1:06:19] just believe in Jesus and that's a yo I
[1:06:22] don't need a messenger I don't need a
[1:06:24] prophet I just all I need to do is
[1:06:26] believe in Jesus that sounds very good
[1:06:28] but jesus said if you receive if you
[1:06:33] receive them I send I mean if you
[1:06:36] receive them I've sent you've received
[1:06:40] me and if you've done that you've
[1:06:42] received him that sent me
[1:06:44] amen and I'll find the scripture but
[1:06:46] it's there Jesus says that and so if you
[1:06:49] take the opposite of that if you reject
[1:06:51] them that Jesus sends you reject Jesus
[1:06:56] amen that's yeah it's that simple and so
[1:07:00] if that's the case then if you receive
[1:07:03] who me since then therefore you receive
[1:07:07] him and you receive him that sent them
[1:07:10] yep so if you receive who Jesus sends
[1:07:15] then then you're walking in the light
[1:07:18] yep are you following me so far yeah
[1:07:23] this is very important because you must
[1:07:25] understand we are a church but we're not
[1:07:28] like other churches it's not trying to
[1:07:30] be exclusive this is this is a
[1:07:32] scriptural principle and it's been all
[1:07:35] the way down through it's been from it's
[1:07:37] been from Adam it's been as you say
[1:07:40] first profit there was no or God spoke
[1:07:42] to they meant if you receive Noah you
[1:07:46] ought to God in the boat if you reject
[1:07:48] no there's no way you're getting in the
[1:07:50] boat there's no way you'd get in the arc
[1:07:52] why would you you'd say you're crazy old
[1:07:55] man the world's going to get better it's
[1:07:57] fine don't worry you know and so it's a
[1:08:02] scriptural principle if you receive him
[1:08:04] that God sends you receive you receive
[1:08:07] Jesus Christ amen that's why people
[1:08:10] can't just say well all I need to do is
[1:08:12] believe in Jesus it sounds good but if
[1:08:15] you're a chick the one that Jesus sends
[1:08:17] how can you say well how can you say
[1:08:19] you're following Jesus a mint because
[1:08:21] God doesn't frustrate his own plans amen
[1:08:27] so let's just go to revelations
[1:08:33] and we'll go to revelations chapter one
[1:08:35] and we'll just read the last two verses
[1:08:49] now this is all in the church age book
[1:08:51] but I just wanted to lay it out because
[1:08:54] it's important that we understand these
[1:08:57] principles of the scripture right the
[1:09:00] things which thou has seen and the
[1:09:02] things that are and the things that
[1:09:05] shall be Hereafter the mystery of the
[1:09:08] seven stars which are source of my right
[1:09:10] hand and the seven golden candlesticks
[1:09:15] the seven stars are the angels of the
[1:09:18] seven churches and the Seven
[1:09:21] candlesticks with our source are the
[1:09:23] seven churches so now we're about to
[1:09:28] I'll just close with this now the seven
[1:09:32] churches we know what they are because
[1:09:35] revelation is two and three John is
[1:09:37] commanded to write to seven churches but
[1:09:42] these books are prophetic so they're not
[1:09:44] just speaking to a local church because
[1:09:46] I've read a book on the Book of
[1:09:48] Revelations once I pass through it at
[1:09:51] your from the Christian group at campus
[1:09:54] there in Canterbury University he gave
[1:09:55] me this book about the book of
[1:09:57] Revelation and basically what this book
[1:10:00] said was this basically was all
[1:10:03] fulfilled the seven these seven churches
[1:10:05] that that Jesus is writing to through
[1:10:08] John they were literal churches and
[1:10:10] there were only two them it's not
[1:10:12] prophetic or anything that's interesting
[1:10:14] win it because when this commentary book
[1:10:16] came to revelations chapter 10 it didn't
[1:10:18] say a whole lot I didn't know what the
[1:10:20] seventh angel was in the mystery of God
[1:10:22] should be finished it just it just
[1:10:24] totally skipped because it was a verse
[1:10:25] by verse commentary and just totally
[1:10:28] jumped over that verse so now so these
[1:10:32] so but these were literal seven churches
[1:10:35] there in Asia Minor which is Turkey but
[1:10:38] it wasn't just writing to them or
[1:10:39] speaking of 7th periods of time from
[1:10:44] from from when Paul founded the church
[1:10:48] Ephesus all the way down to the rapture
[1:10:51] that's a prophetic time and so if there
[1:10:56] are seven churches and we read the
[1:10:58] interpretation the seven stars are the
[1:11:00] seven angels
[1:11:03] of the seven churches so these angels
[1:11:06] now they are not heavenly beings here
[1:11:09] because an angel in the Bible it does
[1:11:11] mean a heavenly being like Gabriel or
[1:11:13] you know one of the angels will also
[1:11:15] means and they would angel means a
[1:11:17] messenger so while we're while we're
[1:11:21] here let's go to Gleason's chapter 4 I
[1:11:24] just want to show you a scripture here
[1:11:33] glaciers chapter four and 14 because
[1:11:40] Paul rain through the glaciers season
[1:11:45] Galatians 4 and 14 I just having a bit
[1:11:48] of a Bible study so so so i want you to
[1:11:50] see these things in the scripture and my
[1:11:53] temptation was not in my flesh I mean so
[1:11:55] an temptation which was in my flesh you
[1:11:57] despise not nor rejected but received me
[1:12:02] as an angel of God even as Christ Jesus
[1:12:06] so Paul himself is saying to the
[1:12:09] Galatians you receive me as an angel of
[1:12:12] God even as Christ himself yep and Paul
[1:12:17] was the angel to the first church each
[1:12:19] so they received them correctly they
[1:12:22] didn't worship him but they received
[1:12:24] them as an angel of God even Christ
[1:12:26] Jesus because they they they could see
[1:12:29] what Paul's ministry was Jesus Christ
[1:12:33] revealing himself through the foot first
[1:12:34] you change messenger so now at their
[1:12:39] seven of their seven churches and
[1:12:41] there's a start to each H now if the
[1:12:44] people wanted to walk in the light as he
[1:12:46] is in the light they had to receive the
[1:12:50] message of that star but we understand
[1:12:54] that only it's really only in this end
[1:12:59] time that we know who these messengers
[1:13:02] are but it's when but it's not you must
[1:13:05] understand it's not receiving the vessel
[1:13:08] it's receiving the Ministry of the
[1:13:11] vessel such receiving the word that came
[1:13:14] out of the vessel because that word
[1:13:17] that is spoken as light yeah so if you
[1:13:20] receive because remember a star it's
[1:13:23] like the moon you know you know in the
[1:13:25] scripture it speaks about the Sun and
[1:13:28] the moon and the stars and it's just all
[1:13:30] symbolic the Sun is Christ the moon has
[1:13:34] no light of itself it just reflects the
[1:13:36] light of the Sun onto the earth and we
[1:13:39] have no light in ourselves but we're
[1:13:40] just reflecting the light of the true
[1:13:43] son Jesus Christ amen and stars stars
[1:13:48] you see like we see Jupiter or Mars or
[1:13:51] we see I think I'm there's um now is
[1:13:54] another season where one of I think
[1:13:56] mercury or or Venus I'm not sure which
[1:14:00] one is actually you can see it going
[1:14:03] going between it's going between the Sun
[1:14:06] and the earth and you and you can
[1:14:08] actually see it move across the Sun
[1:14:11] we're in it we're in the season every so
[1:14:13] often they could do that that's why
[1:14:14] captain cook went to Tahiti one of his
[1:14:16] expeditions was to actually track I
[1:14:19] can't move which planet it was but to
[1:14:21] track that planet go across the Sun it's
[1:14:25] true it's this way I don't know why that
[1:14:26] we need to do it buddy but they went
[1:14:28] there but you see a star like the earth
[1:14:31] is a start it reflects light or Mars or
[1:14:34] yo we can see the planets this does they
[1:14:36] have no light of themselves they're just
[1:14:38] reflecting the light of the true son yep
[1:14:44] so a star all it does is reflects the
[1:14:47] light of the Sun to the earth it's
[1:14:51] heralding a message like the day style
[1:14:53] you know whichever one its heralding its
[1:14:55] heralding the dawn yeah and maybe we're
[1:14:59] going to that later sometime too but so
[1:15:02] these seven stars are the seven messages
[1:15:04] to the church and so to walk in the
[1:15:06] light you had to receive that stars
[1:15:08] ministry yep so the people in Paul's age
[1:15:12] they couldn't just say well I'm just
[1:15:14] going to follow Jesus I believed he died
[1:15:16] and rose for me and you know that his
[1:15:19] blood cleanses they had to believe that
[1:15:20] but they had to receive what that what
[1:15:23] that ministry was saying yeah and then
[1:15:26] you come down all the way through and
[1:15:28] then brother
[1:15:30] I'm gives a principal in the judges book
[1:15:32] he says he says the ministry that
[1:15:34] affects the age most that is the
[1:15:36] messenger to the age so Paul we can
[1:15:39] agree because even when John wrote the
[1:15:41] book of Revelation or he received those
[1:15:43] visions over two year period however
[1:15:45] long it was Paul was already dead he has
[1:15:48] already been beheaded but his ministry
[1:15:51] affected that first church age greater
[1:15:53] than all the other apostles because he
[1:15:55] was the start of the age and then you
[1:15:58] can even come down to the dark ages with
[1:16:01] a worthy with a messenger to the dark
[1:16:04] angels being I believe it was calamba he
[1:16:08] actually died before the thigh Tyrone
[1:16:10] age i believe it was before that
[1:16:12] actually even started he died just
[1:16:15] before it started he said well how was
[1:16:17] he the message ative into that age he
[1:16:20] found today hey hey he founded a Bible
[1:16:23] School up on the west coast of Scotland
[1:16:25] on an island and this and and the person
[1:16:29] who said this is not a believer but a
[1:16:31] but a Bible scholar and he said that
[1:16:34] that that bible school that was founded
[1:16:36] by Columba for the next nine hundred
[1:16:39] years all of the evangelical work for
[1:16:42] Europe came from that Bible School
[1:16:45] because because that was the Dark Ages
[1:16:47] when the Catholic Church basically
[1:16:48] smothered out all the truth but it was
[1:16:51] from that Bible School for the next nine
[1:16:53] hundred years amen so the teachings of
[1:16:57] that one man affected the church for the
[1:16:59] next nine hundred years because of what
[1:17:02] he did so to me that is the best and
[1:17:05] that's why that's to me a further
[1:17:06] vindication of our brother branham
[1:17:08] because pem being a prophet he could
[1:17:10] place the messengers he placed because
[1:17:12] that ministry was to make all the
[1:17:14] mysteries of God knowing sews all these
[1:17:16] loose ends that things that people would
[1:17:18] look at and they didn't fully understand
[1:17:20] like you take the church ages you can
[1:17:23] take Larkins book and brother Branham
[1:17:25] quotes from it he knew what the seven
[1:17:27] Church ages were but you know what the
[1:17:29] messengers were he didn't know who they
[1:17:30] were so people had partial truth down
[1:17:33] through but then finally took a profit
[1:17:35] at the end to tie all the loose ends
[1:17:37] together amen and so so I took a prophet
[1:17:42] to identify the men
[1:17:44] to go to identify the stars to the ages
[1:17:47] and to me that's a further vindication
[1:17:49] then he picked the right messenger to
[1:17:51] the Dark Age it's because history proves
[1:17:53] that ministry affected the age for the
[1:17:55] most amen and so now those people in the
[1:18:02] dark age if they wanted to walk in the
[1:18:04] light they would come under the effects
[1:18:07] of their bible school because the
[1:18:10] because the message of the h founded the
[1:18:12] bible school and if and if that bibles
[1:18:14] will continue to faithfully teach what
[1:18:16] they received and if the people would
[1:18:18] have received the preaching from that
[1:18:21] bible school because they went through
[1:18:22] all of Europe yep they would have been
[1:18:25] walking in the light amen yep and then
[1:18:30] Luther came along the just shall live by
[1:18:32] faith you know and the people that
[1:18:34] receive that message then they begin to
[1:18:37] walk in the light yep but it was now
[1:18:39] another age and down on through things
[1:18:43] have been out the words been opening up
[1:18:45] through various things and so that
[1:18:49] that's what's the principle if you
[1:18:51] receive whom I send you receive me Jesus
[1:18:56] saying so if you receive who i sent you
[1:18:59] receive me so if you do that then you're
[1:19:02] walking in the light see it's not you
[1:19:06] know when I talk about walking the light
[1:19:07] I'm not talking about fully
[1:19:08] understanding and comprehending
[1:19:10] everything but if you walk on the line
[1:19:13] as here's and the light then the blood
[1:19:15] of Jesus Christ cleanse you from all sin
[1:19:17] a mint and God and God will keep walking
[1:19:22] with you that you do and then also G
[1:19:26] this isn't first John but the Spirit of
[1:19:30] Truth who you have received that may be
[1:19:34] so I might begin mixed up but says it
[1:19:37] says in there
[1:19:45] yes first John chapter two verse 27
[1:19:59] no actually that's not the scripture I'm
[1:20:00] looking for I believe this in John
[1:20:05] chapter 14 and maybe after this if we
[1:20:07] could have some musicians to come I
[1:20:09] don't want to keep you too long tonight
[1:20:20] 1320 yes believe us and to you he that
[1:20:26] receiveth whom server eyes send
[1:20:29] receiveth me and he that receiveth me
[1:20:31] receiveth him that sent me yep so that
[1:20:36] that's very important
[1:20:46] I just leave it but he says I yes John
[1:20:53] 16 and verse 13 he says howbeit when he
[1:21:00] the spirit of truth has come he will
[1:21:04] guide you into all truth for he shall
[1:21:07] not speak of himself but whatsoever he
[1:21:10] shall hear that shall he speak and he
[1:21:13] will show you things to come so when the
[1:21:17] spirit of truth has come he'll lead you
[1:21:19] and guide you into all truth that means
[1:21:21] that spirit of truth is the Holy Ghost
[1:21:23] yep so if you really know the Lord Jesus
[1:21:27] because remember Jesus and the Holy
[1:21:28] Ghost are the same it's not there's not
[1:21:32] two different things did the same one so
[1:21:35] if you truly know him he will lead you
[1:21:37] and guide you into all truth yep so it's
[1:21:41] not us trying to grasp well am I walk in
[1:21:44] the light now because the wood has
[1:21:45] expanded and grown all these things if
[1:21:47] you walk in the light as he is in the
[1:21:50] light I'm just going to join these two
[1:21:52] together and operates pleasing to the
[1:21:54] Lord if you walk on the lightest tears
[1:21:56] of the light then you have fellowship
[1:21:58] who you and God and then the blood of
[1:22:01] Jesus Christ cleanses you from all sin
[1:22:03] and then if the spirit of truth is come
[1:22:06] he will lead you and guide you into all
[1:22:08] truth amen so if you walk if you walk
[1:22:13] where he is I'm just going to paraphrase
[1:22:15] those two scriptures if you walk where
[1:22:17] he is then he'll lead you and guide you
[1:22:20] into all truth and his blood cleanses
[1:22:22] you from all sin amen and that's very
[1:22:29] important because there's so many
[1:22:34] beliefs around so many ideas but yet God
[1:22:39] has said now if you walk in my light
[1:22:43] then the blood of Jesus Christ cleanses
[1:22:46] you from all sin so he'll vindicate
[1:22:48] whereas lighters and to prove this as me
[1:22:51] and then all we have to do is walk in it
[1:22:54] receive it and walk in it if we want our
[1:22:57] all of our sins to be
[1:23:00] you know then and then if that is the
[1:23:02] case then the blood cleanse us from all
[1:23:04] sin I meant but if we reject what he's
[1:23:07] doing an hour day then the blood cannot
[1:23:10] cleanse us from all sin yeah based on
[1:23:13] that principle amen what would we like
[1:23:19] to sing
[1:23:27] praise the Lord for the you girls
[1:23:28] alleluia amen one of them amen listing
[1:23:34] one of them but um yeah let's stand but
[1:23:38] I want to so not this sunday i want to
[1:23:41] wrap up Song of Solomon or maybe next
[1:23:45] two sundays but I want to go into this
[1:23:47] this this this last hundred and ten
[1:23:49] years has been incredible time and a lot
[1:23:53] of things have happened we are there's
[1:23:56] so much scripture being fulfilled you
[1:23:58] know and it's such a glorious thing and
[1:24:02] I want to just to put in that kind of
[1:24:03] introduction to really emphasize we need
[1:24:07] to walk in the light amen alleluia amen
