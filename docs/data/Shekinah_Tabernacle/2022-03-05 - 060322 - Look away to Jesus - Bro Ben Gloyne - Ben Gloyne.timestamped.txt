[40:45] cross despising the shame and has set
[40:48] down at the right hand of the throne of
[40:50] god
[40:51] amen and then we've got another reading
[40:53] from 2nd corinthians 4 and 16.
[40:56] i'm going to read down to verse 18 one
[40:58] of my um
[41:00] i've got a lot of um favorite bits but i
[41:02] like this
[41:03] for which cause we faint not
[41:07] but though our outward man perish yet
[41:09] the inward man is renewed day by day for
[41:11] our light affliction is but for a moment
[41:13] worketh for us a far more exceeding and
[41:16] eternal weight of glory while we look
[41:18] not at the things which are seen but at
[41:20] the things which are not seen for the
[41:22] things which are seen are temporal but
[41:24] the things which are not seen are
[41:26] eternal
[41:28] amen praise be to god this is bow he's
[41:30] in a word of prayer amen this morning
[41:33] gracious father we love you so much we
[41:35] want to praise your mighty name thank
[41:37] you dear god we can make the devil
[41:38] uncomfortable when it comes to our house
[41:40] lord we can make him uncomfortable by
[41:42] praising you and giving thanks unto you
[41:44] and rejoicing in you and lord we love
[41:46] you dear god just like lord like the
[41:48] prophet he said when the devil got into
[41:50] his car when he was driving along he
[41:51] said well devil i'm going to sing to you
[41:53] all the way so he sang all the way until
[41:55] the devil got out of the car and lord i
[41:56] believe we can do the same kind of thing
[41:58] we can make the atmosphere so
[42:00] uncomfortable for the devil we can make
[42:01] it so full of praise and glory unto you
[42:04] the devil just is not comfortable
[42:06] anymore being around us no more so
[42:07] that's what we want to do lord in our
[42:09] lives not just in this moment lord but
[42:11] in every moment in our lives just may
[42:12] our
[42:13] our lives be a worship and a praise unto
[42:15] you in everything we say do and think oh
[42:17] god may you grant it father and dear god
[42:20] you see many of us are sick in body lord
[42:22] we're on well father's cover 19 virus
[42:24] this devil and different sicknesses have
[42:26] afflicted us oh god and lord these
[42:28] people with trouble lord jesus and their
[42:30] spirits father i pray lord you touch
[42:32] each one of us lord by your mighty hand
[42:34] oh god we want to thank you that by your
[42:36] stripes we're healed lord i want to
[42:37] thank you dear god that you've already
[42:39] made an atonement lord to heal us of all
[42:41] diseases father and all troubles in our
[42:43] spirits oh lord i pray dear god as we
[42:45] read your word may you anoint it to our
[42:47] hearts oh god i want to get myself out
[42:49] of the way lord may you speak lord for
[42:51] your great glory lord i pray you would
[42:53] be walking in every lounge every place
[42:55] that we're watching the service lord
[42:57] you're a personal god you're not a god
[42:59] there's a distant place somewhere but
[43:00] you're here with us now so i pray your
[43:02] presence will be very real oh god to
[43:04] each and every one lord for your glory
[43:06] in jesus christ's name amen
[43:09] amen god bless you friends you may have
[43:10] your seats this morning
[43:12] um i'd like to i think
[43:14] as i said my title is uh looking away to
[43:17] jesus
[43:18] and um i think this is the most
[43:21] important vital
[43:22] uh thing well i i think the word thing
[43:26] is not the right word to use but it's
[43:27] the most vital you could say commandment
[43:30] or exhortation we could ever
[43:32] hear i believe in this season is that we
[43:34] must look away to jesus
[43:36] now
[43:37] the prophet says here this is this is
[43:39] from the sermon look away to jesus he
[43:41] says now for a text i'm going to take
[43:42] this look away to jesus and he says look
[43:45] away from the world to jesus
[43:47] moses made the serpent and here the
[43:49] prophet was later speaking of it that
[43:50] that would happen looking away to jesus
[43:53] so you know to say oh look away to jesus
[43:56] it can seem very eerie fairy but to me
[43:59] it's actually a very concrete uh
[44:02] instruction because he's saying look
[44:04] away now it's interesting we where how
[44:06] the prophet says look away to jesus
[44:08] because what uh what i believe the lord
[44:10] is saying in this age is that as there's
[44:12] lots of things we'll be looking to that
[44:14] we need to turn our focus from and turn
[44:17] our focus on to the right thing and that
[44:18] right thing is our lord jesus christ so
[44:20] so notice he doesn't say look to jesus
[44:22] says look away to jesus because there
[44:25] will always be something upon this earth
[44:27] that will have our attention and the
[44:29] devil wants our attention like never
[44:31] before and this world is a
[44:33] tension-grabbing world and everything
[44:35] it's not just advertising but every part
[44:37] of life there's an attention
[44:39] parting uh grabbing part of it and so we
[44:41] must look away from those things to our
[44:44] lord jesus christ so that's why i like
[44:46] it how the prophet really said look away
[44:48] from the world to jesus
[44:51] amen now we know many great things are
[44:53] happening in this world and i want to
[44:54] but you know i believe that if we can
[44:56] put it in its right spiritual context we
[44:58] can really say well we can see it for
[45:00] what it is right so you know brother
[45:02] brandman you know i've got a quote uh
[45:04] here um later we'll come to it he says i
[45:06] always want to look at everything
[45:07] through the word so we're going to start
[45:09] with a few things here it's interesting
[45:11] i
[45:12] this is for the next time i speak i want
[45:13] to talk about lies
[45:15] and this will maybe
[45:17] in some way may make a slight kind of
[45:19] well i'll come back to this when i talk
[45:21] about lies but lies are a very
[45:23] interesting uh subject because lies are
[45:25] not just you know
[45:26] white lies lies uh full-blown lies they
[45:29] can be lies to save face they can you
[45:32] know be lies to make yourself sound
[45:34] better or make someone sound worse to
[45:36] distort truth there's many different
[45:37] facets of lies and and and where they
[45:39] come from and you know the influence
[45:41] that make them but anyway that's next
[45:42] time but you know there's a lot of
[45:44] there's a lot of i could use the word
[45:45] because it's today's trending
[45:46] misinformation in the world today
[45:48] but if we have the right information
[45:50] which is from the word of god then we
[45:52] can discern what's going on and we can
[45:54] place it in its place
[45:55] just like brother ferdi was saying that
[45:57] you know what's happening with russia
[45:59] right now is is the backdrop now uh
[46:02] before we read this quote here so i
[46:04] can't blank the um um slides but you
[46:07] know brother brown um you know he says
[46:10] well
[46:11] let's just read this first i know some
[46:12] of you already read all the way through
[46:14] now see don't worry about russia russia
[46:16] is a small pebble on the beach
[46:18] don't worry about communism you will
[46:20] watch romanism when it's uniting with
[46:22] churches there's nothing written in the
[46:24] scripture about communism ruling the
[46:26] world and i go by the word regardless of
[46:29] what anyone else goes it's the word i
[46:31] believe it's romanism that takes the
[46:33] world and romanism is the mother of
[46:35] organization there never was an
[46:37] organization till rome and every one of
[46:39] them came out of it and the bible said
[46:41] so she's the mother of harlots i could
[46:43] stay half a day on it again but i guess
[46:45] i might as well move on so he's saying
[46:48] this in greatest bad level thought
[46:49] because this is the battle of the mind
[46:51] but the thing is every spirit in the
[46:53] world wants to get your attention to
[46:56] capture your mind for you to receive
[46:59] that spirit and become one with it
[47:01] are we are we together this morning
[47:03] right that's what every spirit wants to
[47:04] do the reason that we do not fall under
[47:06] the spirit of this world is because we
[47:07] have a contrary spirit to the world
[47:09] we're the spirit of christ right but if
[47:11] you if you lay aside the spirit of
[47:13] christ and take the spirit of the world
[47:15] again you'll agree with the world you'll
[47:16] look with the world you'll think like
[47:18] the world you act like the world because
[47:20] you have that spirit but if you
[47:22] you know cast off the spirit of the
[47:24] world receive the spirit of christ right
[47:26] if you truly do are born again receive
[47:29] the holy ghost then you
[47:31] your spirit can't jail with the spirit
[47:32] in the world
[47:34] now
[47:35] this was so so the prophet says that
[47:37] russia is a small pebble on the beach
[47:41] now to me i think that's a very powerful
[47:42] statement because you know he was told
[47:45] in 1933 to watch russia watch the king
[47:48] of the north we know in that time i
[47:49] think brother ferdi spoke about this on
[47:51] sunday and i thoroughly love that
[47:53] service it touched my heart deeply but
[47:55] you know you know
[47:57] in those days it was the soviet union so
[47:59] it was when russia became russia again i
[48:01] mean that's easy what watch it you know
[48:03] and we know what what what russia is
[48:05] doing in this hour as was prophesied but
[48:07] the thing is the prophecy is that's just
[48:09] a small pebble on the beach we don't
[48:11] even need to worry about it
[48:13] don't he says don't worry about
[48:14] communism watch that romanism watch that
[48:17] compromising lukewarm religious spirit
[48:20] come in and mix everything together see
[48:22] that's the thing that we have to go to
[48:24] get so
[48:26] but the thing is so with russia now what
[48:28] what i loved how we used the word russia
[48:30] is just that's just the backdrop
[48:32] all right now the backdrop now brother
[48:34] isaac could um um surely enlighten us
[48:37] all on this kind of thing but you know
[48:39] i think i think when when when a when a
[48:41] playwriter or a filmmaker are putting a
[48:44] play together
[48:45] they they think of a scene and they
[48:48] think of what the main characters are
[48:50] doing in the scene and then they think
[48:52] about what is the backdrop based on what
[48:54] the characters are doing
[48:56] right so so it's not the backdrop
[48:58] dictating what the characters are doing
[49:00] it's the other way around
[49:03] hello
[49:04] yes so so i can't hear anyone so i need
[49:06] to see something going on
[49:07] if you pull some muscles waving well i
[49:09] yeah i'll appreciate it yeah so so it's
[49:12] not the it's not the it's not the
[49:13] backdrop dictating to the main
[49:15] characters what's going on it's the it's
[49:18] it's what the main characters are doing
[49:20] which he dictates what the backdrop's
[49:21] doing so now if the bat drop is rising
[49:24] up as it is as she is you know she's
[49:27] like you know you know they say russia
[49:29] is a beer you know and she's like she's
[49:31] woken up and she's you know she's going
[49:33] after her cubs that have lit you know
[49:34] lift the knees you know like ukraine you
[49:36] know wants that soviet block back you
[49:38] know so but that's the backdrop and we
[49:40] know the backdrop is prophesied to to
[49:42] drop a bomb on the vatican and blow up
[49:44] the united states we know that but
[49:45] that's the backdrop so so the main
[49:47] characters have to be doing something in
[49:49] order for the backdrop to come into
[49:50] position second right so if the bride of
[49:53] jesus christ is coming into her position
[49:55] he said the reason the backdrop is doing
[49:57] what it's doing is because the bride is
[49:59] in her position for a rapture
[50:01] amen
[50:02] so that's why we can rejoice and we can
[50:04] just trust in the fact no no we are not
[50:06] remember we're not catching up to the
[50:07] backdrop
[50:09] we are not catching up to the backdrop
[50:10] this is not how this works no the
[50:11] backdrop is catching up to the main
[50:13] characters right which is the bride
[50:16] christ and his bride are the main
[50:17] characters
[50:18] amen so he says and i go by the word
[50:21] regardless of what anything else goes so
[50:24] he'll go by the word regardless of
[50:27] people's emotion public opinion hysteria
[50:30] what's trending
[50:32] i'm going to go with the word and that's
[50:34] why we have to bring everything subject
[50:35] to the word of god we have every thought
[50:38] every feeling it can be very close to
[50:40] our natural birth our natural identity
[50:42] whatever more but we must bring it all
[50:44] subject to the word of god that we can
[50:46] go by the word of god
[50:49] amen now
[50:51] brother barum had this dream now now
[50:52] this is a dream from
[50:54] um that he shares when he preaches the
[50:56] sermon is this the time of the answers
[50:58] now i want you to look at this because
[51:00] as time goes on
[51:02] i'm afraid as this delay goes above this
[51:05] appeared delay goes on more people are
[51:08] wandering away and and that'll make
[51:10] sense when i finish when i'm reading
[51:12] what i'm reading he says and i and he
[51:14] and he said i dreamed a dream and there
[51:16] it was i just sat still and i listened
[51:18] and watched he said and i dreamed that
[51:20] there was a some great big hill like out
[51:22] in a field there was some bluegrass or
[51:24] something was said and on the top of
[51:26] this hill where the water had washed
[51:28] away the soil there was a top rock um up
[51:31] on top of the hill like a top of a
[51:33] mountain it was rock no grass and where
[51:36] the water had washed down it cut some of
[51:38] those some kinds of readings on those
[51:40] stones and you were standing there
[51:42] interpreting this reading on these
[51:44] stones so i think this is junior
[51:45] jackson's dream
[51:47] you know i might be wrong but so you're
[51:48] saying brother brown was there
[51:49] interpreting these readings on these
[51:51] stones i said all of us and here it is
[51:54] the way he put it he said the brethren
[51:55] from georgia and all around we're all
[51:58] standing together listening to you
[51:59] interpret the mysterious writings on
[52:01] those stones that mountain
[52:06] and said then you picked up something
[52:08] like some i'm i'm up from the air
[52:10] something like a wrecking bar or a
[52:11] crowbar wasn't it brother something like
[52:13] that a wrecking bar real sharp and said
[52:16] that's how you done it i don't know and
[52:17] you said you struck the top of that
[52:19] mountain and and ripped it around and
[52:21] lifted the cap off
[52:23] um cap of it off it was in the shape of
[52:26] a pyramid and you ripped the top of it
[52:27] off now that was in now that was months
[52:29] and months and months before the pyramid
[52:31] message was preached and said brethren
[52:34] that was white stone granite and you
[52:36] said the sun or the light had never
[52:38] shined on this look on this watch this
[52:41] that's the instructions look on this
[52:43] watch this
[52:45] and that's right because in the
[52:47] formation of the world the world was
[52:48] formed uh before there was light we all
[52:50] know that god moved upon the water and
[52:52] then in the beginning he he spoke for
[52:55] light and naturally down under there and
[52:57] in the age that formation was that light
[52:59] had never come upon that stone he says
[53:02] look upon this light had never come upon
[53:04] it before and when all of them got up
[53:06] and i told them who watched that and all
[53:09] of them come up to look in but he said
[53:12] while they were looking in he looked out
[53:14] of the corner of his eye i believe it
[53:15] was and watched me i slipped off to one
[53:17] side started going towards the west
[53:19] towards the sitting of the sun going up
[53:21] a hill down a hill going up a hill going
[53:22] downhill getting smaller and smaller and
[53:25] went all the way out of sight and he
[53:28] said then then when i did that he said
[53:31] then the brethren turned around after a
[53:33] while said did he vanish where did he go
[53:36] he said tooks
[53:37] some took out that way some took out one
[53:40] way and some another but very few stayed
[53:43] and looked on to what i told them
[53:46] so so in this in this dream
[53:49] brother braham is standing there and
[53:50] there's the there's a stone which is the
[53:52] word it's got it's got writings in it
[53:54] and he's standing there in the dream
[53:55] interpreting the word to the people and
[53:57] then as he's doing that he grabs this
[53:58] crowbar and he takes he takes the top of
[54:01] the mountain off like the pyramid and
[54:03] the sun had it was shot upon it so now
[54:04] this is the word coming open because
[54:06] remember john
[54:07] john was about to write what those seven
[54:09] thunders were right but he was forbidden
[54:12] to write it so what happened is now the
[54:13] light had never struck there yet it had
[54:15] never become manifest yet until the days
[54:18] of the voice of the seventh angel so
[54:19] brother brown takes the word because
[54:21] that's his commission he opens it to the
[54:23] people
[54:24] takes the book gives it to the prophet
[54:26] he opens it to the people right and and
[54:28] we're instructed now to look upon this
[54:30] look upon this revealed word but then
[54:32] now when the prophet left people are
[54:35] wondering oh where is god now you know
[54:37] oh god seemed to prophet but what's
[54:38] going on now and some people they just
[54:40] wander off on this doctrine or this
[54:42] opinion or this idea they just wonder if
[54:44] it says but very few stayed and looked
[54:47] on to what i had told them
[54:50] right so we want to be the kind of
[54:52] people that stay and look
[54:54] right
[54:55] looking upon the word because remember
[54:57] as we behold him we become him
[54:59] right as we behold the word we become
[55:02] the word amen so we can't just wander
[55:04] off on our own opinions no matter how
[55:06] many quotes are associated with it i
[55:08] mean we want to stay and look
[55:11] i mean so so there's the challenge now
[55:13] because people people can get
[55:16] disenchanted they can you know you know
[55:18] things cannot go their way or something
[55:20] could just happen and they can start to
[55:21] look on other things but we don't want
[55:23] to go down that track we want to stay
[55:25] and look
[55:26] yes
[55:30] now
[55:31] i'm just going to go into because um i
[55:33] think was brother methanol or one of the
[55:35] brothers at camp they
[55:36] they're talking about demon powers
[55:38] fighting
[55:40] now we know that in
[55:42] in heaven before the angels fell um you
[55:44] know before the devils fell they were
[55:46] angels right devils fallen angels now in
[55:49] heaven there's hierarchy of different
[55:50] powers of of angels you know it's not
[55:52] like there's just if i can say it this
[55:54] way michael and gabriel and then there's
[55:56] all the other angels the same no no no
[55:58] there's different powers of angels right
[56:00] just like in just like in the human race
[56:02] you can say there's this
[56:04] uh i hope this doesn't come out wrong
[56:06] but you know there's smarter people
[56:07] there's richer people there's poorer
[56:08] people you know there's different
[56:09] abilities within human beings right we
[56:11] just you can't make yourself einstein
[56:13] you're either born einstein or you're
[56:15] not you know or you can't make yourself
[56:17] bait home and that gift is already
[56:18] within you you know you can't you know i
[56:21] could i could i could spend a life or
[56:23] ten thousand lifetimes trying to play
[56:25] the piano like just a little i'm never
[56:26] going to get there right it's just not
[56:28] in these hands you know but because i'm
[56:30] not made that way right right well
[56:32] i try and learn to sing like analysts i
[56:34] can't do it right no matter how how many
[56:37] how many how many lessons i could ever
[56:39] get it ain't gonna it just ain't gonna
[56:41] ring true so you know because there's
[56:43] different abilities within people just
[56:45] like in angels there's different classes
[56:46] there's different abilities there's
[56:47] different powers and right so now when
[56:50] so when
[56:51] those angels fell they did not lose that
[56:54] power right or that or that strength
[56:56] within the kingdom so so it went from
[56:58] they had a place within heaven's kingdom
[57:01] and then they fell
[57:02] and then now they have a position in
[57:04] hell's kingdom right
[57:06] so this is shown here in daniel 10
[57:08] because remember we want to be a
[57:09] scripturally trained church that's the
[57:11] only church that will stand in this end
[57:12] time that's where you want to be so so
[57:14] in daniel 10 he says and he said unto me
[57:16] oh daniel this is daniel he's been
[57:18] praying because he wants to know the
[57:19] answer to to the vision or the dream
[57:21] he's just had he says and he said unto
[57:23] me there's the angel coming to him oh
[57:25] daniel a man greatly beloved understand
[57:27] the words that i speak unto thee and
[57:29] stand upright for unto thee am i now
[57:32] sent and when he had spoken this word
[57:34] unto me i stood trembling then he said
[57:37] unto me fear not daniel for i was
[57:39] for from the first day that thou didn't
[57:42] set my heart set thine heart to
[57:43] understand and to chasten myself before
[57:46] thy god thy words were heard and i am
[57:48] come for thy words isn't that amazing
[57:50] god hears as soon as we start
[57:52] amen when we when we set our hearts to
[57:55] understand when we chase ourselves
[57:56] humble ourselves before the lord i mean
[57:58] an answer is actually already on its way
[58:00] i mean but we've got to understand just
[58:02] because the answer doesn't come straight
[58:03] away doesn't mean god hasn't heard our
[58:04] prayer
[58:05] right but it's the enemy trying to stop
[58:07] that answer coming to us so we need to
[58:10] you know we need to keep
[58:12] perseverant in prayer until an answer
[58:15] comes if it's a no praise the lord if
[58:17] it's a yes praise the lord whatever the
[58:18] answer is i'm happy
[58:20] amen i liked how brother cabin said on
[58:22] sunday how brother ferdi's talking about
[58:24] you know their new bodies and their
[58:25] hairstyles and different things and you
[58:27] know brother could be said i'm you know
[58:28] i you know i think it was uh you know
[58:31] i'm open for anything
[58:33] you know i like that kind of answer
[58:35] because it shows you know he doesn't
[58:37] have his mind made up you know a real
[58:39] christian doesn't come to god with his
[58:41] mind made up god does how i want you to
[58:42] do it you know he's just open for god's
[58:44] answer so so i really like that amen
[58:48] so he says now uh
[58:50] verse 13 but the prince of the kingdom
[58:52] of persia was stood me one in 20 days
[58:55] so now that that prince of the kingdom
[58:57] of persia wasn't the literal king of
[58:58] persia right it was the anointing that
[59:00] was upon the kingdom it was that demon
[59:02] power that was upon the kingdom and and
[59:05] so that this this power was stood this
[59:07] angel coming for 20 days and this angel
[59:09] could not bring the answer until a
[59:11] stronger angel came to help him says but
[59:14] lo michael one of the chief princes came
[59:16] to help me and i remained there with the
[59:18] kings of persia now i am come to make
[59:21] the understand
[59:22] uh what shall befall my people in the
[59:25] latter days for yet the vision is for
[59:27] many days so
[59:29] so the you know this so this angel
[59:31] though it's you know one of god's angels
[59:33] one of god's messages a mighty angel was
[59:35] not powerful enough i mean to to to
[59:38] basically push this demon power of the
[59:40] king of persia i mean kingdom of persia
[59:42] aside to bring the answer to daniel
[59:44] though daniel was a true believer
[59:45] seeking god waiting for the answer to
[59:47] come this angel needed a more powerful
[59:50] angel than itself
[59:52] for him to bring the answer to daniel
[59:54] right so we can yeah i'm sure we can
[59:56] just see from this one example that
[59:57] there are hierarchies of angels powers
[1:00:00] that's right amen and so just because
[1:00:04] and angel fallon became a demon it's
[1:00:06] amazing god because god built them a
[1:00:08] certain way he actually let them with
[1:00:10] that ability though they have fallen
[1:00:12] you know just like man you know you take
[1:00:14] some of the most gifted people in the
[1:00:16] world right now
[1:00:17] and you know it blows their mind how
[1:00:19] they'll solely get sell their life just
[1:00:21] for a few million dollars and just for a
[1:00:23] you know a few moments of
[1:00:25] you know drug fuel destruction upon this
[1:00:28] earth but yet they have the most
[1:00:30] powerful gifts many of them started off
[1:00:31] singing in church choirs and different
[1:00:33] things but it's amazing when as soon as
[1:00:35] they took a step towards the wrong god
[1:00:37] didn't strip them of that power god
[1:00:38] didn't take their gifts from them he
[1:00:40] just let them go
[1:00:41] right along but it just shows we'll have
[1:00:42] to give an account for the gifts that we
[1:00:44] have in our lives
[1:00:45] amen that's right brother
[1:00:48] amen so now
[1:00:51] in this in this war that's going on
[1:00:55] oh yes okay okay so so i'm going to take
[1:00:57] this sorry as i said in my notes i've
[1:00:59] just got my slides i actually don't know
[1:01:00] what slides coming next so i know
[1:01:02] roughly in my mind because i put it
[1:01:03] together so
[1:01:04] um so now when it comes to demon powers
[1:01:07] there's this
[1:01:08] just like just like in a natural
[1:01:10] civilization you know we have our we
[1:01:12] have our mayor right who's in charge of
[1:01:13] the city or or councillors who's you
[1:01:16] know then we have the mayor who's in
[1:01:18] charge of the city then we have then we
[1:01:20] have the um mps and we have the prime
[1:01:22] minister then we have our governor
[1:01:24] general then there's the queen that's
[1:01:25] the hierarchy of the of the english or
[1:01:28] of the new zealand system right of our
[1:01:30] government now we know some of it's
[1:01:32] symbolic some of it's not but but
[1:01:33] there's still a hierarchy
[1:01:35] and then even even in the law today the
[1:01:38] governor general can actually dissolve
[1:01:39] parliament they they have a right to do
[1:01:41] that and it actually has happened in in
[1:01:43] australia before where the government
[1:01:44] general dissolved parliament they
[1:01:46] actually made the you know you know
[1:01:48] change of government or whatever because
[1:01:50] there was trouble going on so even
[1:01:52] though it appears symbolic there's still
[1:01:53] some authority in those positions now
[1:01:55] it's the same thing in demon realms
[1:01:57] there'll be a demon over a suburb
[1:01:59] and a demon over a town a demon over a
[1:02:01] city a demon over a province and a demon
[1:02:03] over a country
[1:02:05] and so
[1:02:06] so here's and there's and there's even
[1:02:08] brother brown i think he uses the words
[1:02:09] we'll see in the next slide or two
[1:02:10] tribes of demons
[1:02:13] and he says and then so so when i looked
[1:02:15] at the man so so now this is brother
[1:02:17] maybe standing on the platform in oregon
[1:02:19] and that demon possessed man's coming
[1:02:20] before him he says i'm going to tear you
[1:02:21] limb from limb you know there's that
[1:02:23] great challenge going on it says and
[1:02:25] when i looked at the man i heard myself
[1:02:26] talking i don't know whether it may
[1:02:28] sound strange but it was the holy spirit
[1:02:30] speaking the holy um the bible said take
[1:02:32] no thought of what you shall say it will
[1:02:34] be added then and it said because that
[1:02:36] you have defied the spirit of god
[1:02:38] tonight you will fall over my feet he
[1:02:40] said well i'll show you whose food i'll
[1:02:42] fall over and he drew his great arm back
[1:02:44] and he started to hit me like that i
[1:02:45] said satan come out of the man just
[1:02:47] about like that in the name of the lord
[1:02:49] jesus and yeah
[1:02:51] right back to strike and he started
[1:02:53] going oh and his eyes rolled back he
[1:02:55] started going around and around and he
[1:02:57] fell down until he laid across my feet
[1:03:00] and i couldn't move anyway so there both
[1:03:02] had made a challenge the spirit of god
[1:03:04] and the spirit was and the spirit that
[1:03:06] was in him both of them made a challenge
[1:03:08] so something had to happen the audience
[1:03:10] was waiting and the fellow
[1:03:13] and um and the policeman said is that
[1:03:15] man dead i said no sir said is he healed
[1:03:18] i said no sir he worships that spirit he
[1:03:20] won't give it up see but would you move
[1:03:23] him off my feet and so then when
[1:03:26] they got over there i just turned around
[1:03:28] to the audience i said as i was saying
[1:03:30] faith is the substance of things hoped
[1:03:32] for and a man sitting in a wheelchair
[1:03:34] just raised up in a lady on a stretcher
[1:03:37] and nowhere everything in there was
[1:03:38] healed right there and they just packed
[1:03:41] them away and the next morning was a
[1:03:42] great big truck going down the street
[1:03:44] people saying only believe walking
[1:03:45] behind this great big truck full of
[1:03:47] stretches and wheelchairs and everything
[1:03:50] amen now now brother brown shows what it
[1:03:52] was what was it the chief of that tribe
[1:03:54] of demons had made the challenge and
[1:03:55] lost it you see and so that's when the
[1:03:58] spirit of god struck the building and
[1:04:00] everything was healed amen so it goes to
[1:04:02] show that the devil tries to put his
[1:04:04] spirits upon the people they need to
[1:04:06] hold back the promises of god but when
[1:04:09] the chief one is broken all the others
[1:04:11] run for cover i mean
[1:04:13] breaks out and he has his full liberty i
[1:04:15] mean and the people and i pray it's the
[1:04:17] same thing where you and i are sitting
[1:04:19] right now i mean the chief
[1:04:21] i said the chief
[1:04:22] of this tribe of sin has been broken by
[1:04:24] the blood of jesus christ i mean you
[1:04:27] know all superstition all fussing
[1:04:29] fighting whatever more has been broken
[1:04:31] we we we are not here to live under our
[1:04:33] privilege i mean the devil's being
[1:04:35] defeated i mean i say lord just just
[1:04:37] just just have free reign in our lives
[1:04:39] amen hallelujah
[1:04:42] amen so so so now this was just so so
[1:04:45] this is just in a tribe of demons a
[1:04:47] local tribe of demons but now when you
[1:04:49] take this into a national
[1:04:51] scene
[1:04:52] when it comes to wars against countries
[1:04:54] you know all that is actually two demons
[1:04:56] fighting
[1:04:58] we're going to look at this for what it
[1:04:59] is okay so so now right now in the world
[1:05:03] the demon that's over russia is fighting
[1:05:05] over the demon that's over the ukraine
[1:05:06] they're fighting each other
[1:05:08] right it's two it's two demon powers
[1:05:11] clashing
[1:05:12] he says now we find that because
[1:05:15] that people do this and cause these
[1:05:16] great fusses and so forth now as long as
[1:05:18] satan controls it there's going to be
[1:05:20] wars and troubles and war jesus said in
[1:05:23] in saint uh saint matthew 24 said you'll
[1:05:26] hear of wars and rumors of wars and wars
[1:05:28] and war why because the prince of the
[1:05:30] earth the satan the power of the nations
[1:05:33] is a national spirit here a national
[1:05:35] spirit adherence devils they can't get
[1:05:37] along with one another
[1:05:40] did you ever take a bunch um did you
[1:05:41] ever take a bunch in the eskimo country
[1:05:43] up there where they go on dog sleds
[1:05:45] northern alaska and way up there around
[1:05:47] in the northwestern territory when the
[1:05:49] god there was tying off these dogs
[1:05:51] called huskies and he'd tie one here and
[1:05:53] taiwan out there and taiwan over here i
[1:05:56] said why are you doing that he said
[1:05:57] they're so full of the devil they'll
[1:05:59] kill one another see just kill that's
[1:06:01] all they think about well that's the
[1:06:02] devil you see he's a killer he just the
[1:06:05] nation just even devils fighting devils
[1:06:07] see they're just fighting
[1:06:09] one another
[1:06:11] amen they're just fighting one another
[1:06:13] so what's going on in the ukraine and
[1:06:14] yeah with russia that's just devils
[1:06:16] fighting devils right because one is
[1:06:19] trying to usurp the other one wants to
[1:06:20] dethrone the other so that's just all
[1:06:23] war is because if man was in his right
[1:06:25] mind without any demonic influence it'd
[1:06:26] be peace i believe
[1:06:28] because no one in their right mind would
[1:06:29] want to kill another right but as demon
[1:06:31] power gets on people i mean they you
[1:06:34] know you know they come under the spirit
[1:06:35] that's under their country and they just
[1:06:36] want to kill each other but you know i'm
[1:06:38] glad we're going to a place where
[1:06:39] there'll be no more death and no more
[1:06:41] fighting there'll be no more devils
[1:06:43] fighting each other they'll be burning
[1:06:44] that's where they'll be i look forward
[1:06:45] to that moment hallelujah
[1:06:49] amen so now this is so so this is this
[1:06:52] is this is what's going on in warfare
[1:06:54] but now it's actually the same thing
[1:06:55] when it comes to an uprising within a
[1:06:57] country like a revolution that
[1:06:59] revolution is actually other devils
[1:07:01] within the country are rising up to try
[1:07:03] and dethrone the one that's that's
[1:07:05] controlling the country that's a
[1:07:06] revolution
[1:07:08] everyone together right just like the
[1:07:09] french revolution there was one spirit
[1:07:12] ruling the country then another spirit
[1:07:14] rose up and dethroned that other demon
[1:07:15] power but there was a lot of bloodshed
[1:07:17] and killing i mean for that to take
[1:07:19] place so now here's the thing we've got
[1:07:23] to be very careful in this hour
[1:07:25] what spirit we let ourselves be used by
[1:07:29] because the thing is when it comes to a
[1:07:31] revolution you know jesus says our
[1:07:34] kingdom my kingdom is not of this world
[1:07:36] if my kingdom was of this world then my
[1:07:38] servants would fight right so he's
[1:07:40] saying now my kingdom is not like the
[1:07:42] kingdoms of this world where where where
[1:07:45] because the kingdoms of this world is
[1:07:46] just demon power
[1:07:48] fighting each other
[1:07:49] in jesus day there was the roman demon
[1:07:53] you know the demon over the roman empire
[1:07:55] was suppressing the jewish nation right
[1:07:58] there was a demon power ruling the
[1:08:00] jewish nation and it was wanting to rise
[1:08:03] up and take its place again as being
[1:08:06] you know a free people if i can say it
[1:08:08] that way i hope this doesn't come out i
[1:08:10] hope people don't take me the wrong way
[1:08:12] so now because every nation under heaven
[1:08:14] is is controlled by the devil
[1:08:16] jesus jesus was even given them by satan
[1:08:19] himself during the great you know during
[1:08:22] his great um trial there in the desert
[1:08:24] he says you know he showed him all the
[1:08:26] kingdoms of the world and it wasn't just
[1:08:28] at that moment it was all down through
[1:08:29] time so he would have shown him new
[1:08:31] zealand he would have shown him canada
[1:08:32] america different part you know china
[1:08:35] russia all these countries you know he
[1:08:37] says i'll give these all to you if you
[1:08:39] just bow down and worship me now
[1:08:42] jesus did not say to him satan those
[1:08:44] aren't yours
[1:08:46] he did not say that he did not challenge
[1:08:48] that at all he just says no no because
[1:08:49] he knew he's going to fall into it
[1:08:51] anyway she says get behind me satan you
[1:08:53] know you know worship the lord thy gods
[1:08:55] but the thing is now when it comes to
[1:08:57] demon powers fighting with the nations
[1:09:00] we've got to be very careful we don't
[1:09:01] fall under the influence of that one
[1:09:03] demon power fighting the other demon
[1:09:04] power we're going to stay
[1:09:07] we're going to stay away from that stuff
[1:09:09] remember look away looking away to jesus
[1:09:12] right don't look to what's going on in
[1:09:15] the nation or going on in the world and
[1:09:17] being caught up in the spirit of it
[1:09:18] because that's what the devil wants us
[1:09:20] he wants us to look away to the world
[1:09:22] god wants us to look away to jesus to
[1:09:25] him right so so the devil's saying look
[1:09:27] to me look away from the word look away
[1:09:30] from your source of strength look away
[1:09:31] from where you can get your deliverance
[1:09:33] from and look to me
[1:09:35] and what is there hatred malice strife
[1:09:38] envy variance you know
[1:09:41] false accusers and continent despises
[1:09:43] those that are good unholy without
[1:09:45] natural affliction truth breakers false
[1:09:47] accusers you know that's that's the
[1:09:50] attributes of being under his his demon
[1:09:54] influence
[1:09:56] so it's just demons fighting it's just
[1:09:57] devils fighting devils no matter how
[1:09:59] sympathetic we may be no matter how
[1:10:02] sorry we may feel for those who are
[1:10:05] fighting
[1:10:06] right and i'll just talk about our
[1:10:08] nation for a bit no matter how
[1:10:09] sympathetic we may feel for for the
[1:10:11] cause
[1:10:12] we don't want to get caught up into
[1:10:14] devils fighting devils
[1:10:16] the kingdom we are of is not of this
[1:10:18] world
[1:10:20] amen
[1:10:22] now
[1:10:23] brother anne makes a few statements
[1:10:25] because i think it's very interesting in
[1:10:27] this day we must be very careful where
[1:10:30] we're at this age we live in now if
[1:10:32] you've already read that well you've
[1:10:33] already read it but you know i'll read
[1:10:35] it soon but i want to say this this is
[1:10:37] the age of people's rights this is lady
[1:10:39] osea that's the that's the that's the
[1:10:41] spirit in this world not just one part
[1:10:43] of the world the whole world so we must
[1:10:45] be very careful that we don't just have
[1:10:48] the spirit of ladocia when we kick back
[1:10:50] against things
[1:10:52] you know it's all but it's you know and
[1:10:53] but people can put a religious veil over
[1:10:55] it but it can just be actually the
[1:10:57] anointing of laodicea upon a person
[1:10:59] kicking back against whatever
[1:11:01] whatever the government's doing we've
[1:11:02] got to have a real clear motive and
[1:11:04] objective that's pure before the lord
[1:11:06] you know we can't just have a rebellious
[1:11:08] nature that's suddenly found a cause
[1:11:09] that it can rally to
[1:11:11] now he says listen once more this is in
[1:11:13] 1963 after the seals open i'll say where
[1:11:15] brother brown was a prophet he says but
[1:11:17] i know
[1:11:18] that there has to be a law here a fire
[1:11:20] marshal's law just so many we have to
[1:11:23] leave so much isles and so forth and
[1:11:26] they and that they cannot help because
[1:11:28] that we are as christians we've got to
[1:11:30] do that for the bible said jesus told us
[1:11:33] to give caesar those things that pertain
[1:11:35] to caesar and then to god the things
[1:11:37] that belong to god so we try to and if
[1:11:40] we do not obey caesar it's very doubtful
[1:11:43] we'd obey god
[1:11:44] and as long as caesar's laws don't
[1:11:46] interfere with gods we must obey god
[1:11:49] first and then these fire hazards and so
[1:11:51] forth well they know how to take care of
[1:11:54] that and they told us
[1:11:56] now someone may take this and say well
[1:11:58] but wouldn't the fire laws
[1:12:01] actually interfere with gods because it
[1:12:03] stops people coming into the meetings
[1:12:07] wouldn't people think that
[1:12:09] but obviously the prophet of god could
[1:12:11] see no no this is caesar's laws it's not
[1:12:14] actually stopping us believing what we
[1:12:15] believe
[1:12:16] so it's actually okay he has to render
[1:12:18] to see the things of the season he says
[1:12:20] he says if you don't obey caesar it's
[1:12:22] very doubtful you obey god
[1:12:25] see i'll say it like this some people
[1:12:27] just follow the message
[1:12:29] the part of it that they want to follow
[1:12:32] the part that they agree with is the
[1:12:33] part that they follow but the parts they
[1:12:35] don't agree with well that's your second
[1:12:37] pull see we don't need to worry about
[1:12:39] that the word's open yeah we've moved on
[1:12:40] there's more no no no all of this is
[1:12:42] actually just an excuse because they
[1:12:44] just agree with what they want to agree
[1:12:46] with
[1:12:47] this is not a smorgasbord religion
[1:12:48] friends i'm not here just for a part of
[1:12:51] the i want the whole oh i want the whole
[1:12:53] land we got we told take the book not
[1:12:55] just the contents not just the cover and
[1:12:58] the cover and the maps and the no take
[1:13:00] the whole book and eat it
[1:13:02] right
[1:13:02] the good bits the bad bits whatever bits
[1:13:05] you think they are you know i like more
[1:13:07] sweet food people more like savory food
[1:13:09] but if they're sweet and savory in the
[1:13:11] book i've got to eat the whole thing
[1:13:13] right i don't just want to eat the bits
[1:13:15] you know i
[1:13:16] i've never made it a rule maybe we
[1:13:18] should make it a rule but i always you
[1:13:20] know i made this word up a few years ago
[1:13:22] and i unfortunately haven't well i
[1:13:24] shouldn't anyway i shouldn't make it a
[1:13:26] joke but you know i made this thing
[1:13:27] called you know we should have something
[1:13:29] called presert which is dessert before
[1:13:31] the main right
[1:13:34] you know if you're a sweet tooth you
[1:13:35] know i would like that kind of thing but
[1:13:37] cc because my preference is i have a
[1:13:39] sweet tooth so i'd rather the sweets and
[1:13:41] in the main but some people don't like
[1:13:43] the sweets they just want the main so
[1:13:45] you know so the thing is
[1:13:47] analyst agrees with me i go all right
[1:13:49] now um but the thing is you know you
[1:13:52] can't just have the bit you want you
[1:13:53] need the whole you need the whole word
[1:13:55] you can't just have the bit that caters
[1:13:57] to your preconceived idea that you
[1:13:59] already enjoy or maybe you know that you
[1:14:01] gravitate towards you need the whole
[1:14:02] thing so i find it very powerful how the
[1:14:05] brother graham says if you don't obey
[1:14:07] caesar it's very doubtful you'd obey god
[1:14:10] amen so lord lord check our motive and
[1:14:12] objective right now and he says
[1:14:14] christianity ain't what you say it's
[1:14:16] what you live it's what you do it's an
[1:14:18] example you're the salt of the earth i
[1:14:20] said then the law says jesus says give
[1:14:23] you give caesar them things that belong
[1:14:25] to caesar you break the speed law out
[1:14:26] there what are you doing you're doing
[1:14:29] wrong you sin give caesar what caesars
[1:14:31] and gods what's god's well
[1:14:34] you say well the law is wrong i can't
[1:14:36] help what wrong it is it's wrong to
[1:14:39] break jesus commandment and if you do
[1:14:42] don't give caesar the things that ceases
[1:14:44] that ceases then you did what jesus told
[1:14:47] you not to do
[1:14:48] and the transgression of the law of sin
[1:14:51] that's right we're all guilty we do it
[1:14:53] but when you see yourself wrong stop it
[1:14:55] people are watching you people don't go
[1:14:57] to church
[1:14:58] they'll read you see what you do so now
[1:15:01] the prophet is saying that
[1:15:03] this word here to give caesar that which
[1:15:06] is caesar's supersedes
[1:15:08] amen our opinion of how wrong the law is
[1:15:10] because we we have to we have to agree
[1:15:13] there's many laws in this country that
[1:15:15] are wrong
[1:15:18] right we may not agree with them all but
[1:15:20] he says now if you break that law then
[1:15:22] you're breaking jesus commandment which
[1:15:23] is higher than the law
[1:15:25] because he says well the you know
[1:15:26] because people say well the law's wrong
[1:15:28] why should we have to have mandates and
[1:15:29] all this kind of thing he says well sure
[1:15:32] but i can't help what the wrong is it's
[1:15:34] wrong to break jesus commandment
[1:15:37] right
[1:15:38] so it's wrong to break
[1:15:40] what jesus has said give to caesar
[1:15:42] that's which ceases
[1:15:44] now the reason i believe the whole
[1:15:46] reason for this is is because if you
[1:15:49] start breaking the law
[1:15:51] because you start kicking against
[1:15:52] authority then you actually fall under a
[1:15:55] demonic influence that's trying to rise
[1:15:57] up to dethrone the one over the country
[1:15:59] already
[1:16:01] i don't want to join sides with that i
[1:16:02] want to look away to jesus
[1:16:08] amen now he says this why did the why
[1:16:10] did russia wake up
[1:16:12] why did the nations wake up
[1:16:14] why has man being able to achieve when
[1:16:16] scientists 300 years ago french
[1:16:18] scientists rolled the ball at a certain
[1:16:20] speed across the earth and proved by
[1:16:22] scientific research if a man ever made
[1:16:24] the terrific speed of 30 miles an hour
[1:16:26] gravitation would take him off the earth
[1:16:28] according to his weight according to the
[1:16:29] weight of the ball now he's going 17 000
[1:16:32] miles an hour so each still trying to
[1:16:34] climb on he's just recognized that
[1:16:37] lately why has to be that way why the
[1:16:39] church used to stand
[1:16:41] i mean used to stood on the rock of
[1:16:43] jesus christ no matter what anyone said
[1:16:45] they stayed right with that word the
[1:16:47] message of the hour luther wesley went
[1:16:50] uh went down
[1:16:52] sorry and went through there and now
[1:16:55] they've turned back to traditions what
[1:16:57] has done it
[1:16:58] past 25 years israel has worked has
[1:17:01] recognized that they're in the homeland
[1:17:02] for something it was prophesied that
[1:17:04] that have to be gathered again hosea
[1:17:06] said so we read it a while ago god help
[1:17:08] us to understand it all right
[1:17:10] at the same time the bride has
[1:17:12] recognized the evening light see this is
[1:17:14] so important friends just to begin to
[1:17:16] recognize the hungry pentecostals have
[1:17:18] begun to recognize that their
[1:17:19] organizations hasn't got anything that
[1:17:21] they're looking for they're so twisted
[1:17:23] and tore up see it's a time for
[1:17:24] recognition recognition you've got to
[1:17:27] recognize the world has recognized the
[1:17:30] nations have recognized science is

[1:17:40] people on the earth that he's
[1:17:41] predestinated to life he recognized this
[1:17:44] is the time to send his message he's did
[1:17:46] it the people has recognized the bride
[1:17:48] time has realized the evening light i
[1:17:51] mean that's why it's so important we can

[1:17:54] the backdrop is not the main event amen
[1:17:56] the back you're the backdrop it's just
[1:17:58] showing where the world is but the
[1:18:00] reason the world's in this condition is

[1:19:08] you know for the fullness of the holy
[1:19:09] ghost to pour himself into the church

[1:19:13] pouring himself out more and more and

[1:21:27] from the lord he wasn't ashamed about
[1:21:29] that i mean we should we should be able
[1:21:30] to

[1:21:33] and say devil my help cometh from the
[1:21:35] lord i mean you've come against me

[1:21:40] i mean brother braham said that if you
[1:21:42] know the devil comes against any of
[1:21:43] god's children he's got jesus christ on
[1:21:45] his hands you better be careful
[1:21:47] amen amen

[1:21:53] lord i mean i'll wait for the god of my
[1:21:55] salvation my god will hear me rejoice
[1:21:58] not against me oh my
[1:21:59] my enemy when i fall i shall arise when

[1:22:04] light unto me
[1:22:05] hallelujah amen so don't rejoice devil i
[1:22:08] shall arise i say the bride is rising
[1:22:11] right now
[1:22:12] amen now this is just me
[1:22:14] where a person looks to is where they
[1:22:16] draw their strength from
[1:22:18] so
[1:22:19] where you really look to
[1:22:21] where you're i say um i can't remember
[1:22:23] who said it it was quite a while ago but
[1:22:25] but your your your crutch your support
[1:22:28] is really your religion
[1:22:30] your mind your main support thing
[1:22:33] so people people will look to all kinds
[1:22:35] of things and they'll draw strength from
[1:22:37] it now the word strength is more of a
[1:22:39] positive word because in actual fact a
[1:22:41] lot of people look to negative things
[1:22:43] and they draw i can't say it's strength
[1:22:46] but they're trying to draw some
[1:22:47] spiritual sustenance or some kind of
[1:22:49] nutrients from it
[1:22:52] so now
[1:22:54] if people are looking to
[1:22:56] the news
[1:22:58] they're actually looking for more than
[1:22:59] just information but they're looking to
[1:23:00] draw strength they're looking to draw
[1:23:01] something you know you know if if this
[1:23:04] is their main crutch because we know
[1:23:06] there's nothing wrong with reading the
[1:23:07] news but some people get so obsessed
[1:23:08] with it and geoplot um politics and
[1:23:11] different people's opinions and
[1:23:13] different things they're actually
[1:23:14] drawing strength and i'll and actually
[1:23:16] say it this way if there's if there's
[1:23:18] something in here drawing it's because
[1:23:20] it's a spirit in here drawing
[1:23:23] right so what it feeds on what it feeds
[1:23:26] on actually dictates what's in here
[1:23:28] as your source of strength so some
[1:23:31] people's source of strength will just be
[1:23:33] they'll just they'll just bury
[1:23:34] themselves in entertainment that's where
[1:23:36] they're trying to draw strength from
[1:23:37] some people bury themselves in social
[1:23:39] media platforms
[1:23:41] that's that's where they draw their
[1:23:42] strength from right some people draw
[1:23:44] their strength from youtube or tick-tock
[1:23:46] or something that's where they draw
[1:23:47] their strength from but they're not
[1:23:48] getting strength out of it
[1:23:50] right there's no strength in those
[1:23:51] things
[1:23:52] you know some people draw their strength
[1:23:54] from you know pain
[1:23:56] they have pain in here so they go via
[1:23:59] social media other things and they read
[1:24:00] about other people's pain and they're
[1:24:02] actually drawing strength it's actually
[1:24:03] the spirit of them is drawing strength
[1:24:04] from the other person's pain they're
[1:24:06] actually worshiping what's what what has
[1:24:08] happened to them or what they feel
[1:24:09] they're going through
[1:24:11] right so people so where people look to
[1:24:13] us where they draw their strength from
[1:24:15] but the thing is those kind of things
[1:24:17] they can't help no one
[1:24:20] but that's where people think you know
[1:24:21] but but they have a need in their lives
[1:24:24] and they try to draw strength from it
[1:24:26] that's what they're looking to
[1:24:28] you know we can say we're believers we
[1:24:30] can say we message believers and praise
[1:24:32] the lord but the thing is what are we
[1:24:33] drawing our strength from
[1:24:36] we've got to be drawing our strengths
[1:24:37] from the revealed word of the hour
[1:24:39] because
[1:24:41] if you look at it now
[1:24:44] in this in this open book here
[1:24:46] that we've been
[1:24:48] we've been given
[1:24:49] in this day by the seventh angel
[1:24:52] in this is rapture
[1:24:55] and this is peace
[1:24:57] and this is strength
[1:24:59] and this is joy
[1:25:01] and this is overcoming power
[1:25:03] and this is understanding who i am and
[1:25:05] this helps me to be comfortable in my
[1:25:07] own skin and this helps me understand
[1:25:09] everyone else in the body even and this
[1:25:11] helps me appreciate my family
[1:25:14] and this helps me to be more long
[1:25:15] suffering and this gives me a joy that
[1:25:17] passes all understanding right in this
[1:25:20] amen and this in this takes away
[1:25:22] superstition
[1:25:24] and this takes away your man's opinion
[1:25:27] and this takes away you know being
[1:25:28] worried about what everyone else thinks
[1:25:30] and what's going on in the world all of
[1:25:32] that is and if you look unto jesus right
[1:25:35] look away to jesus if you look away from
[1:25:38] other things because you know you look
[1:25:40] at someone who's who's got a depressive
[1:25:42] spirit they withdraw themselves but then
[1:25:44] they feed that depression on other
[1:25:45] things because they're trying to draw
[1:25:46] strength i mean from something but it's
[1:25:48] that spirit within them is drawing
[1:25:50] strength from the wrong thing i mean but
[1:25:52] if the holy ghost is truly within a
[1:25:53] person amen they they will see actually
[1:25:56] the only place i can draw strength from
[1:25:58] is the word of god and they will
[1:26:00] actually get strength from what they
[1:26:01] draw from
[1:26:03] amen you know people who draw their
[1:26:05] strength from the world they don't get
[1:26:07] strength right it's like someone who
[1:26:08] lives on mcdonald's all their lives
[1:26:10] they're drawing strength from something
[1:26:11] but there's no nutrients in it it can't
[1:26:13] sustain them it can't make them stronger
[1:26:15] it makes them weaker it just ruins their
[1:26:17] immune system it makes them fatter makes
[1:26:18] them more lethargic they can't think
[1:26:20] they have less of a drive these are all
[1:26:22] been proven things if you've you know
[1:26:24] i'm probably showing my age but that you
[1:26:25] know that you know that documentary
[1:26:27] super size me which came out a few
[1:26:28] decades ago now the guy lived on
[1:26:30] mcdonald's for a month any any any
[1:26:33] documented his physical changes and even
[1:26:35] his emotional state it just all went
[1:26:37] downhill
[1:26:38] see we don't want to be like that but
[1:26:41] but this thing is people draw their
[1:26:42] strength from different things and
[1:26:44] unfortunately it's like living on
[1:26:45] mcdonald's for a month
[1:26:48] they become weaker they become less
[1:26:52] you know they become more lethargic they
[1:26:54] become more double-minded they become
[1:26:56] more withdrawn they become more you know
[1:26:59] you say they become less thankful less
[1:27:01] appreciative less loving it's all about
[1:27:03] you know because why they're feeding off
[1:27:05] the wrong thing i'll say if you're doing
[1:27:07] that amen don't let your crutch be some
[1:27:10] little thing on the internet but look
[1:27:11] away to jesus
[1:27:13] look away to him because in him you can
[1:27:15] get life is life and life more
[1:27:17] abundantly in him you can get joy you
[1:27:19] can actually draw joy i mean from the
[1:27:22] rivers of water amen you can draw peace
[1:27:24] you can draw love you can draw
[1:27:25] understanding i mean you can draw such a
[1:27:27] stability oh god you can draw a clear
[1:27:29] mind i mean you can draw being level
[1:27:32] headed i mean you can draw i mean real
[1:27:34] discernment where you can actually
[1:27:35] people can tell you all kinds of things
[1:27:37] and actually the discernment of god will
[1:27:38] say no hold on
[1:27:40] the spirit behind that amen the intent
[1:27:42] of that of that of that statement and
[1:27:44] all that literature is trying to destroy
[1:27:46] me and and you can discern and withstand
[1:27:49] it i mean i trust you're all together
[1:27:51] this morning i mean so i just i want to
[1:27:53] ask you that question so where are you
[1:27:55] drawing strength from
[1:27:57] because it's what you're looking
[1:27:58] to amen i trust i trust rule we are all
[1:28:02] drawing our strength from the lord jesus
[1:28:04] christ the revealed word this day
[1:28:07] amen
[1:28:08] he says in the message thirst here
[1:28:11] by your desire
[1:28:13] you can tell who is on the throne of
[1:28:15] your heart
[1:28:17] by what you love that's what tells see
[1:28:19] you say well i think them things are all
[1:28:21] right brother branham well just remember
[1:28:23] now in your heart you know what's there
[1:28:25] yes sir by what is feeding your soul
[1:28:28] what your soul is thirsting for and you
[1:28:30] can see it satisfies if it isn't a word
[1:28:33] then there is something wrong because
[1:28:34] the holy spirit lives on the word only
[1:28:37] now i just want to say this the devil
[1:28:39] wants to tell us that there's no fun
[1:28:41] serving god
[1:28:43] there is no the devil tries to tell our
[1:28:45] young people there is no fun there's no
[1:28:47] satisfaction there's nothing even
[1:28:49] it's just not cool to serve god i tell
[1:28:51] you it is the funnest thing to serve the
[1:28:53] lord amen it is the greatest thing to
[1:28:55] serve the lord amen to come under his
[1:28:57] anointing to go to to step into his
[1:29:00] presence i mean to dwell in his presence
[1:29:02] i mean is the most satisfying the
[1:29:04] greatest thing you can ever you can ever
[1:29:06] be in that the heavenly realm where
[1:29:08] we're going to be in eternity comes down
[1:29:09] into your room and you feel his presence
[1:29:11] amen that that's that's to me that's
[1:29:13] what serving god's all about i mean
[1:29:15] there can be the mechanics of reading
[1:29:16] your bible and praying and going to
[1:29:18] church and listening to sermons but it's
[1:29:20] the dynamics that when his holy spirit
[1:29:22] comes in amen and the word becomes alive
[1:29:24] and there's just a joy leaps from your
[1:29:26] heart and it's just so wonderful you
[1:29:27] sing songs and you hear lyrics you just
[1:29:29] want to start crying and rejoicing and
[1:29:31] see see that is the satisfaction amen
[1:29:34] that comes amen from serving the lord
[1:29:37] and of course knowing you know where
[1:29:38] you're going amen when when your life
[1:29:41] finishes but you see now we want to have
[1:29:43] the right desire in our hearts don't let
[1:29:45] the devil derail your desire into
[1:29:47] something else i say look away to jesus
[1:29:52] amen now the thing of it is so now now
[1:29:54] we're going to look at what do people
[1:29:55] look for because to say look away to
[1:29:58] jesus now some people have uh many
[1:30:00] different ideas of what it means to do
[1:30:02] to look to jesus it depends what you see
[1:30:04] when you look right now think of it as
[1:30:07] now now these next few statements are
[1:30:09] from the message look away to jesus says
[1:30:10] the thing of it is that people look for
[1:30:12] those things speeches instead of the
[1:30:14] word this is what they're looking for
[1:30:15] the word being manifested is evidence
[1:30:17] that it's right i mean the word being
[1:30:19] manifest i mean they'll never look at
[1:30:21] that they have to have an intellectual
[1:30:24] conception to know go to the seminary
[1:30:25] learn how to bow how to stand in one
[1:30:27] place and and that rule chokes up a
[1:30:30] minister to death it's really filled
[1:30:31] with the holy spirit amen now that's
[1:30:33] intellectual so the evidence i mean the
[1:30:35] word being manifested is the evidence
[1:30:37] that it's right
[1:30:38] hallelujah amen so so when the word
[1:30:41] because god interprets his word by
[1:30:43] bringing it to pass
[1:30:44] amen so he said a virgin shall conceive
[1:30:46] i mean mary was found with child had had
[1:30:49] emmanuel when that happened it didn't
[1:30:51] need no interpretation it came to pass i
[1:30:53] mean when he said i'll pull my spirit
[1:30:55] out upon all flesh amen and then my hand
[1:30:58] made you'll prophesy i've been with
[1:30:59] dream dreams young men see visions all
[1:31:01] those things and then we saw on the day
[1:31:03] of pentecost they meant a bunch of what
[1:31:04] were acting like drunk people the pillar
[1:31:06] of fire came down separated himself into
[1:31:08] 120 upper room they are shouting
[1:31:10] rejoicing screaming staggering like
[1:31:12] drunk people i mean that was the
[1:31:14] interpretation of joel's prophecy it
[1:31:17] didn't need interpreting god brought it
[1:31:19] to pass right so now so
[1:31:22] the word became manifested and that was
[1:31:25] the evidence that it was right now here
[1:31:28] we are in this end time and the bride
[1:31:30] around the world amen is becoming more
[1:31:32] aware of who she is and we see our lord
[1:31:35] jesus christ moving more i mean in every
[1:31:38] service you see camp meetings around the
[1:31:40] world god moves more in power i mean the
[1:31:42] young people were becoming more alive on
[1:31:45] fire i mean the promises are becoming
[1:31:47] more real i mean the quickening power is
[1:31:49] moving upon the people i mean the word
[1:31:51] is more richer it's greater i mean it
[1:31:53] means more to us we're being molded and
[1:31:55] shaped into his image what's that that
[1:31:57] is that is the word becoming manifested
[1:32:00] i mean that is actually proving that's
[1:32:02] the evidence that it's right i mean that
[1:32:04] is proving that there is actually
[1:32:06] that's the proof that there'll be a
[1:32:07] restoration the end time is correct
[1:32:10] hallelujah and we're living in it amen
[1:32:12] we are living evidence that the word is
[1:32:14] right because it's being manifested in
[1:32:16] our lives
[1:32:18] hallelujah now when moses looked so i've
[1:32:20] got a couple of pictures here for the
[1:32:21] children i mean when moses looked
[1:32:24] amen he looked away because many times
[1:32:27] we've got to look away from our
[1:32:28] disappointment
[1:32:30] we've got to look away from our regret
[1:32:33] to look to jesus
[1:32:34] now regret and disappointment can be a
[1:32:37] real cage
[1:32:38] but we're going to look away from those
[1:32:40] things see moses was a backslidden
[1:32:42] prophet he was he was 80 years on the
[1:32:44] backside of the desert you know he he he
[1:32:47] just said well i'm just going to be i'm
[1:32:49] going to just look after my
[1:32:50] father-in-law's sheep and i'm just going
[1:32:52] to raise my children here and this is my
[1:32:54] portion of life but he knew he was that
[1:32:56] promised deliverer i mean but he just
[1:32:57] somehow was willing to live below his
[1:32:59] privilege and here he was but he looked
[1:33:01] away from those things and he looked to
[1:33:03] jesus now we know that the same angel of
[1:33:06] the lord that was in the burning bush
[1:33:08] there is the same i mean became flesh
[1:33:10] you know as jesus christ we understand
[1:33:12] that right jehovah of the old as jesus
[1:33:14] of the new so he looked away from his
[1:33:16] regret and trouble and he looked into
[1:33:17] the lord and when he looked away to
[1:33:20] jesus of you know if i can put it that
[1:33:22] way and he saw everything he needed was
[1:33:24] in that pillar of fire everything that
[1:33:26] moses lacked was in that pillar of fire
[1:33:28] amen he lacked the ability to free his
[1:33:31] countrymen he lacked the ability to
[1:33:34] fulfill the prophecy he has ordained to
[1:33:36] fulfill amen he was ordained to fulfill
[1:33:39] the prophecy given to abraham that the
[1:33:41] children of israel amen would would
[1:33:43] would be in bondage 400 years but then
[1:33:45] god would bring them out to a mighty
[1:33:46] hand he couldn't fulfill it in his own
[1:33:48] ability everything he had needed to
[1:33:50] fulfill that prophecy was in the burning
[1:33:52] bush in the pillar of fire and i'll say
[1:33:54] the same thing with you and i today
[1:33:56] everything that we lack is in the pillar
[1:33:59] of fire today amen everything we lack is
[1:34:02] in him we cannot we are born under
[1:34:04] prophecy you know that
[1:34:06] amen
[1:34:08] hallelujah
[1:34:09] there's a prophecy that there'll be the
[1:34:11] lamb's wife the weddings i mean the
[1:34:14] marriage of the lamb has come and his
[1:34:15] bride has made herself and unto him was
[1:34:17] grounded ships should be arrayed and
[1:34:19] fine and clean and white which is the
[1:34:21] righteousness of saints hallelujah amen
[1:34:23] that's a prophecy right
[1:34:25] we can't fulfill it in our own selves so
[1:34:27] everything that we lack to fulfill that
[1:34:29] prophecy that we're born under that
[1:34:30] prophecy is in the prophet of fire
[1:34:33] praise the lord
[1:34:34] amen so he looked away from his his
[1:34:36] regret and 40 years back son of the
[1:34:39] desert all those things he looked away
[1:34:41] to jesus and he saw everything that he
[1:34:43] had need of was in the pillar of fire i
[1:34:46] mean moses when he was in egypt he had a
[1:34:48] choice to make one day while he was the
[1:34:50] great general in the army he looked out
[1:34:52] of the same window that pharaoh did
[1:34:54] pharaoh seen the israelites and of
[1:34:56] nothing but a bunch of mud dogs but
[1:34:58] slaves are no good all the egyptians
[1:35:00] looked upon them the same but moses
[1:35:03] couldn't see no beauty in them because
[1:35:04] they were ragged they were poor they
[1:35:06] were beaten they were rejected people
[1:35:09] by the world so when moses looked at
[1:35:11] them he looked he saw something
[1:35:13] different he saw god's heritage he saw
[1:35:15] god's promises
[1:35:16] amen
[1:35:19] and moses standing with a foot on the
[1:35:21] throne and yet by faith looked at the
[1:35:23] unseen moses refused refused to be the
[1:35:26] son of pharaoh because he knowed he was
[1:35:28] the son of abraham phew i knew
[1:35:31] i know you know i'm a fanatic i'm
[1:35:33] fanatically about one thing that's jesus
[1:35:35] christ and his promises amen i like that
[1:35:37] we should be fanatics about jesus christ
[1:35:39] and his promises moses had rather be a
[1:35:42] son of abraham than to be the son of
[1:35:44] pharaoh why he couldn't see it in the
[1:35:46] natural if he's the son of abraham the
[1:35:48] muppets was for him the slave whip what
[1:35:51] was it but he had recompense to the
[1:35:53] reward for he endured as seeing him who
[1:35:55] was invisible
[1:35:56] who made the promise there
[1:35:58] you are
[1:35:59] i mean peter looked up
[1:36:01] peter looked one way one day and when
[1:36:04] peter walked up into his presence jesus
[1:36:06] said your name is simon you're the son
[1:36:08] of jonas he knew right then when he
[1:36:10] looked the first time on jesus he knew
[1:36:12] that was the fulfillment of what the
[1:36:13] word of god said he would be amen i
[1:36:15] wonder if you found the same thing when
[1:36:18] you looked at him for the first time i
[1:36:19] wonder if the promised word manifested
[1:36:21] itself to you
[1:36:23] when you looked at him amen when you
[1:36:26] looked at him did you see you know i
[1:36:28] trust when you first looked
[1:36:30] i mean you saw more than a healing
[1:36:31] ministry
[1:36:33] you know i trust when you first looked
[1:36:34] you saw more than a prophet i trust when
[1:36:37] you first looked you saw more than just
[1:36:38] a sermon
[1:36:39] i trust when you first look you saw more
[1:36:41] than just you know bible days are here
[1:36:44] again but i trust when you look you you
[1:36:46] heard the voice behind the voice and you
[1:36:48] and you heard messiah calling you you
[1:36:50] heard the very christ of the bible step
[1:36:52] out of history and manifest himself to
[1:36:54] you and i i mean i trust that's what
[1:36:56] when you look away to jesus i trust
[1:36:58] that's who you see as you see messiah
[1:37:01] amen living in our midst once again
[1:37:05] praise the lord
[1:37:06] i'm sorry but yeah
[1:37:08] pray for me i'm just running a bit out
[1:37:09] of steam but but we'll get through now
[1:37:11] the woman at the well
[1:37:13] she had a look one time and what did she
[1:37:15] see she expressed it in the city she
[1:37:17] said come see a man who told you things
[1:37:19] i've done isn't this the very messiah
[1:37:21] when she took her first look at jesus
[1:37:23] she saw messiah hallelujah i love that
[1:37:26] amen i trust you see messiah when you
[1:37:28] see this message more than books and
[1:37:30] tapes i mean more than good doctrine
[1:37:32] more than just true bible teaching but i
[1:37:33] trust you see messiah you see jesus
[1:37:35] jesus christ himself people can look at
[1:37:38] the same thing today and call it mental
[1:37:39] telepathy they call it spiritualism they
[1:37:41] call it any kind of devil name they can
[1:37:44] they can call it because they don't know
[1:37:46] what they're looking for amen what are
[1:37:48] you looking for i mean i'm looking for
[1:37:49] rapture i'm looking for the one who died
[1:37:52] that down calvary i mean i'm looking to
[1:37:54] meet him in the air i mean i'm looking
[1:37:55] to see the fulfillment of every promise
[1:37:57] that god has made i mean i'm looking to
[1:37:59] see if people made this image i mean i'm
[1:38:01] looking for messiah the word made flesh
[1:38:03] that's what i'm looking for
[1:38:04] amen i wasn't looking for an
[1:38:06] intellectual church i wasn't looking for
[1:38:08] a different lifestyle i wasn't looking
[1:38:10] for just a nice group of people i was
[1:38:12] looking for jesus christ the god of the
[1:38:13] bible
[1:38:14] amen praise god
[1:38:17] amen people who look at the same thing
[1:38:19] today so i'm just going to start from
[1:38:20] here again people who look at the same
[1:38:22] thing today and call it mental telepathy
[1:38:24] they call it spiritualism they call it
[1:38:25] any kind of devil name they can call it
[1:38:28] because they don't know what they're
[1:38:29] looking for amen they don't understand
[1:38:31] they're looking for a creed looking for
[1:38:33] a jew
[1:38:35] for a genius to set the church in order
[1:38:37] they're looking for more members and
[1:38:39] fail to see the blessed lord jesus
[1:38:40] christ in his identified word right
[1:38:44] my lord jesus
[1:38:46] you know sometimes we can get
[1:38:47] discouraged
[1:38:49] after we look
[1:38:51] and we can try and go back to what we
[1:38:52] used to do
[1:38:54] peter when he looked the first time he
[1:38:55] saw messiah he saw the christ
[1:38:58] but then
[1:38:59] even after the resurrection because he
[1:39:01] was so discouraged in himself and his
[1:39:03] failure to try and stand for the lord he
[1:39:05] just said to his disciples let's just go
[1:39:07] fishing
[1:39:08] he said i
[1:39:10] you know i go fishing
[1:39:12] and they said unto him well we'll go
[1:39:14] with you
[1:39:15] and they went forth and entered into a
[1:39:16] ship and immediately that night they
[1:39:18] caught nothing it's amazing how the you
[1:39:20] know god is actually so good to put us
[1:39:23] on a heap of discouragement sometimes
[1:39:25] god is so good i mean to put us on some
[1:39:28] kind of ash heap like peter was put on
[1:39:30] because he doesn't want us to look away
[1:39:33] to the world he wants us to look away to
[1:39:35] him
[1:39:36] because the reason he wants us to do
[1:39:38] that is because there is more of him for
[1:39:41] us that we know nothing about i mean
[1:39:43] peter was just not that many days from
[1:39:45] the day of pentecost i mean for the
[1:39:48] infilling of the holy ghost amen to go
[1:39:49] from just because remember he knew what
[1:39:51] it was like to preach under the
[1:39:52] anointing because he was sent jesus sent
[1:39:55] him and the disciples and the century
[1:39:56] off to preach the gospel cast out devils
[1:39:59] he knew what it was like to heal the
[1:40:00] sick aiming to preach under the
[1:40:02] anointing but he didn't realize the
[1:40:04] greatness of being filled with the
[1:40:05] presence of god i mean more than an
[1:40:07] anointing but god dwelling in his in his
[1:40:09] very soul amen so he got discouraged he
[1:40:12] says look you know because what happens
[1:40:14] many times is people we never realize we
[1:40:17] never think about the valleys and the
[1:40:19] trials that we will have to go through
[1:40:22] after we give our lives to the lord
[1:40:24] he doesn't charge the whole walk
[1:40:28] amen he gives us a glimpse of glory
[1:40:31] we see our names written in the land's
[1:40:33] book of life right we hear from our
[1:40:35] theophany we know we have an eternal
[1:40:37] body waiting in the heavens we know it's
[1:40:39] all there right we know he's going to
[1:40:40] take us away amen we know we're going in
[1:40:42] a rapture but he doesn't show us the
[1:40:44] trials and the deep struggles and the
[1:40:46] pain and the hurt that we you know that
[1:40:48] many times we have to go through those
[1:40:49] things
[1:40:50] amen we don't
[1:40:52] we're not showing those things right
[1:40:55] so
[1:40:56] what can happen is we can be discouraged
[1:40:59] by by
[1:41:00] by those things
[1:41:02] and it causes us to look to something
[1:41:04] else and this is what happened with
[1:41:05] simon peter is
[1:41:07] because remember this here in john 21
[1:41:09] that i didn't read verbatim but but here
[1:41:11] it is on the screen for you to read you
[1:41:13] know he he was carrying this weight of
[1:41:15] discouragement this is like he says how
[1:41:17] was a lead balloon
[1:41:18] amen and he didn't know the deliverance
[1:41:20] from it because he denied the lord three
[1:41:22] times curse while doing it all those
[1:41:24] things so there he was living with this
[1:41:26] thing so he's so he must have thought in
[1:41:28] his heart because he never would have
[1:41:29] thought it would have ended up like this
[1:41:32] jesus being crucified even though jesus
[1:41:33] told them and you know
[1:41:36] but their eyes weren't open to it and so
[1:41:38] so he's walking along with this
[1:41:39] discouragement and many times we you
[1:41:42] know if if if if we could write down you
[1:41:45] know what our christian walk would
[1:41:47] entail
[1:41:48] when we start and where we are right now
[1:41:50] those two lists wouldn't be the same
[1:41:52] thing
[1:41:53] in terms of battles and you know things
[1:41:55] he didn't know these things were going
[1:41:56] to happen
[1:41:57] right so he got discouraged so he looked
[1:41:59] away he says i'm just going to look back
[1:42:01] to my old life
[1:42:03] i go fishing
[1:42:04] but they caught nothing
[1:42:07] and the lord does that because it
[1:42:09] because the lord wanted
[1:42:11] peter to come back to him
[1:42:13] here's another picture for the children
[1:42:14] here they are fishing
[1:42:17] and and it and it's dawn and i don't
[1:42:19] know if you can see it but you know here
[1:42:20] just on the seat bank here there's a
[1:42:22] white figure glory
[1:42:25] and there's and there's there's a
[1:42:27] fire
[1:42:29] there's the lord jesus cooking breeding
[1:42:31] fish upon the fire
[1:42:33] and no doubt this is john here on the
[1:42:34] bow of the ship and he's just told peter
[1:42:36] it's the lord because i heard that voice
[1:42:39] from the seashore saying have you caught
[1:42:41] any fish you know no doubt they were
[1:42:43] real grumpy when they said no i haven't
[1:42:45] caught a thing
[1:42:46] you know and and then john looks again
[1:42:48] because remember john john is
[1:42:50] represented in the bible he's like the
[1:42:51] eagle prophet amen who can look from
[1:42:54] eternity to eternity and he looked past
[1:42:56] what peter can see he says it's the lord
[1:42:58] there on the
[1:42:59] you know you know on the on the seashore
[1:43:02] so peter area is jumping out he's
[1:43:04] jumping out because he looked
[1:43:07] he looked away to jesus
[1:43:09] he didn't know how he'd be received when
[1:43:11] he looked away but he knew
[1:43:13] he had to go anyway
[1:43:15] hallelujah there's something about a
[1:43:17] previous mad seed of god we may
[1:43:19] miserably fail but there's something
[1:43:21] within us saying i just want to get back
[1:43:23] to where jesus is
[1:43:24] amen so he jumped in the water
[1:43:26] he swam to where the lord was why what's
[1:43:28] happened he looked away from his own
[1:43:30] discouragement in himself
[1:43:33] in his own disappointment and his own
[1:43:34] deeds he looked away from those things
[1:43:37] amen and he looked at jesus and when he
[1:43:39] looked away and he saw jesus and he went
[1:43:42] swimming to him
[1:43:43] amen
[1:43:45] he was asked those great questions peter
[1:43:46] do you love me it's so amazing it's such
[1:43:48] a simple question eh jesus doesn't ask
[1:43:51] complicated things like what were you
[1:43:52] thinking what was going through your
[1:43:53] mind when you did this and what you know
[1:43:55] they said no do you love me see the lord
[1:43:58] comes down to the core of the man
[1:44:00] do you love me peter
[1:44:02] amen and then so peter says you know you
[1:44:04] know i love you
[1:44:06] and then he asked them three times in
[1:44:08] the third time
[1:44:09] peter says well peter answered that same
[1:44:11] thing i just said lord you know i love
[1:44:13] you
[1:44:14] amen and peter we know he had to go
[1:44:17] through those things but he had to look
[1:44:19] here to look away to jesus
[1:44:26] amen
[1:44:29] now
[1:44:33] hallelujah
[1:44:35] he had to look away now it's the same
[1:44:36] thing with us we need to look away to
[1:44:38] jesus
[1:44:39] more than ever before i'm just going to
[1:44:40] wrap up with this statement i think i've
[1:44:42] got i've got one more slide after this
[1:44:45] now brother braham says that my purpose
[1:44:47] is so
[1:44:48] you know we should we should we should
[1:44:51] live
[1:44:52] we need to look away from our feelings
[1:44:54] sometimes
[1:44:55] we need to look away from how we feel
[1:44:57] sometimes we need to look away from
[1:44:59] those things and look to jesus right
[1:45:02] because remember
[1:45:03] we shouldn't live
[1:45:05] by how we feel we should live by how we
[1:45:08] what
[1:45:08] sorry we should we shouldn't live by how
[1:45:11] we feel we should live by what we
[1:45:12] believe
[1:45:14] right
[1:45:15] so if we feel
[1:45:17] rejected if we feel despised if we feel
[1:45:20] misunderstood if we feel this brother
[1:45:23] did this the sister said this and this
[1:45:25] and this i'll stay no no we shouldn't or
[1:45:27] i'm feeling grumpy you know i'm feeling
[1:45:30] upset
[1:45:31] we shouldn't live by how we feel because
[1:45:33] our feelings change like the weather
[1:45:35] right we should live by what we believe
[1:45:39] i mean the joy the lord's my strength he
[1:45:42] saved my soul i'm going to heaven amen
[1:45:45] we're on the winning side the blood of
[1:45:47] jesus christ has cleansed me from all
[1:45:48] sin he's faithful and just to forgive me
[1:45:51] i mean hallelujah i fear for my
[1:45:53] theophany i mean my lord is more than
[1:45:55] enough i love it how the apostle paul
[1:45:57] says that my sufficiency is of god i
[1:46:00] mean so what makes me sufficient is my
[1:46:02] sufficiency is god's own sufficiency i
[1:46:04] mean so you know we have this
[1:46:06] sufficiency of the lord amen in this
[1:46:08] hour he says now my purpose is as we all
[1:46:11] know by the scripture
[1:46:12] that divine healing has already been
[1:46:14] secured for every believer
[1:46:16] amen
[1:46:17] hallelujah that makes me happy it's part
[1:46:20] of jesus suffering he was wounded for
[1:46:22] our transgressions with his stripes we
[1:46:24] were healed we are healed for as moses
[1:46:28] lifted up the bra serpent in the
[1:46:29] wilderness so must the son of man be
[1:46:31] lifted up same cause and that was a type
[1:46:34] christ is the antitype and then if the
[1:46:36] old atonement could produce healing how
[1:46:39] much more should the new one a which has
[1:46:41] the which has got uh better things to
[1:46:44] produce divine healing now jesus was
[1:46:46] lifted up for the same cause that the
[1:46:48] bra servant was he was made sin because
[1:46:51] the serpent was made out of brass and
[1:46:53] brass is a symbol of divine judgment and
[1:46:56] serpent showing the serpent's
[1:46:58] curse from the garden of eden where sin
[1:47:01] and sickness entered
[1:47:03] and jesus cannot nobody cannot preach
[1:47:05] jesus christ as the atonement without
[1:47:07] preaching divine healing no one can
[1:47:09] preach the gospel without preaching
[1:47:11] divine healing because see you don't he
[1:47:13] see you don't have to have certain
[1:47:15] things like if the animal had got a hold
[1:47:17] of you you don't have to just cut its
[1:47:19] foot off or cut its arm off or whatever
[1:47:21] he he's got around you just kill him
[1:47:23] from the head and you've got it and
[1:47:25] that's the way jesus did when he died
[1:47:27] for sin he killed everything that sin
[1:47:30] ever did he completely redeemed us we're
[1:47:33] now drawing the remuneration from our
[1:47:35] great the earnest money of our complete
[1:47:38] deliverance
[1:47:39] and his coming again it means we're just
[1:47:41] drawing the earnest money right now amen
[1:47:44] of everything he's done so he's
[1:47:45] completely redeemed us amen as he died
[1:47:48] down calvary to purchase our salvation
[1:47:50] who's fully saved
[1:47:53] not
[1:47:54] not pastor who's fully saved so if we're
[1:47:56] fully saved and we're fully healed
[1:47:58] amen because it's one of the same act
[1:48:00] amen so that's why we can look away to
[1:48:03] jesus
[1:48:04] i mean to look away from our symptoms
[1:48:06] and our worries and our troubles and our
[1:48:08] sickness sure they're there but look
[1:48:10] away from them the world's falling apart
[1:48:12] we can't put blinkers on and say it's
[1:48:14] not but we've got to look away from the
[1:48:16] falling apart of the world and look to
[1:48:18] the one who can deliver us
[1:48:20] amen we're going to look away from the
[1:48:21] shifting sands of man's opinion and look
[1:48:24] to the one who's a firm solid rock to
[1:48:26] stand upon which is the word of god
[1:48:28] amen so i just want to leave it there i
[1:48:31] want to encourage you all friends look
[1:48:32] away to jesus
[1:48:34] amen he's the author and finisher of our
[1:48:35] faith
[1:48:37] hallelujah
[1:48:39] amen so let's just bow heads in the word
[1:48:41] of prayer uh this morning and then i'm
[1:48:43] going to turn the service back over to
[1:48:45] brother armand

[1:49:54] of us a peace and a stability or is it

[1:51:23] week before we
[1:51:25] um
[1:51:26] there was a big wrong speech that i was
[1:51:28] talking about uh danny reagan was
[1:51:30] actually talking about that prince of
[1:51:31] persia and how gabriel couldn't get
[1:51:34] there you know he couldn't get there
[1:51:35] because those those angels were keeping
[1:51:38] him back and it's just a confirmation
[1:51:39] that sometimes we don't we don't look to
[1:51:42] the unseen we look at the obvious but we
[1:51:44] forget that there's far greater things
[1:51:46] happening around us and the lord has
[1:51:48] everything in control so we just thank
[1:51:50] the lord for his mercy and and
[1:51:52] i encourage you eat it right eat good
[1:51:56] eat healthy eat eat what i would say is
[1:52:00] feed on the word
[1:52:02] eat the word pray the word forget about
[1:52:05] the world tick tock youtubes those
[1:52:07] things it's distractions just stay in
[1:52:09] your word no matter what you care now

[2:03:00] and you lord then you will heal us
[2:03:02] because that is your word lord and we
[2:03:04] hold on to that word
[2:03:06] lord the same can happen here with us in
[2:03:08] our midst is what happened in durban
[2:03:10] south africa the same can happen with us
[2:03:12] with that maniac that took on the
[2:03:14] prophet lord he actually challenged you
[2:03:16] he didn't tell his brother ben uh
[2:03:18] brother branham also lord and and what
[2:03:20] he forgot lord is greater is the one
[2:03:22] that is with me lord and within me and
[2:03:25] lord brother branham just stood on the
[2:03:26] word and he had love and compassion lord
[2:03:29] and he looked at this man and he knew
[2:03:31] this was not a physical battle lord he
[2:03:33] knew that this was a spiritual battle
[2:03:34] father and he wasn't going to fight it
[2:03:36] out of the physical realm he's going to
[2:03:38] say lord you come up and i will not take
[2:03:41] thought for what i say right now because
[2:03:42] the holy spirit will say it and he did
[2:03:44] and it was thus say of the lord and he
[2:03:46] fell at his feet lord so will every
[2:03:48] enemy come against a sickness cancer
[2:03:51] depression lust any spirit that is not
[2:03:54] from you lord that's boasting and trying
[2:03:55] to push the
[2:03:57] the agenda of the enemy lord god will
[2:03:59] raise the standard lord and you will
[2:04:02] beat that the enemy at any time any
[2:04:04] place anywhere lord because you are
[2:04:06] within your bride lord let us never
[2:04:08] forget that let us never belittle the
[2:04:10] one that is within us lord let us never
[2:04:13] doubt father let us just believe in our
[2:04:15] faith to receive the promises that
[2:04:17] you've given us through your word
[2:04:18] through this message lord jesus i pray
[2:04:20] that this wouldn't just be a message not
[2:04:23] just another sermon lord but the words
[2:04:25] that were spoken today would touch each
[2:04:27] one of our hearts lord and lord even the
[2:04:29] ones that didn't listen lord
[2:04:31] may that word go and just pierce the
[2:04:34] heart and the soul lord and justify the
[2:04:36] sin lord and shed light upon that seed
[2:04:39] so that she can grow lord i pray this in
