god bless you saints testimony evening testimony evening so what we're going to do is we're first going to open up a and read a scripture and just open the evening up and we'll pray and then we'll open up for testimonies and after that i want to share just a little thought and then we'll go in to pray together and we'll just pray and if there's any pre-request we'll we'll address them as we go amen so if you all just stand and we're just going to go to john 19. and then we're going to read the verse 28 to 30. amen good evening saints i love wednesdays because it's such a mission to get here sometimes eh and then the whole day everything goes wrong and everybody's working on your nerves and then you work on your own nerves and then everybody else works on your nerves with you and it's tough but we made it brother isaac we made it amen we're winners it's all rigged it's all rigged amen and it's the truth okay so let's read this it's a it's a it's a little bit hard but it's going to just tie into what i want to share with you tonight afterwards and it will definitely tie in with what happened this weekend amen brother um ed can you mute me completely on the foldbacks please sorry thank you brother love the sound technicians okay verse 28 it says after this jesus knowing that all things were now accomplished that the scripture might be fulfilled saith i thirst so now remember he's hanging on the cross and and he's done everything for us and now he's hanging on the cross and his only command there is i'm thirsty i thirst so all that things that was preached this weekend comes down to this point where jesus says i thirst just give me a drink you know more people on death row have more rights than our lord jesus when he died i thirst and now they were set a vessel full of vinegar and they filled it with a sponge with vinegar not even give him a cup of water and they put it upon his up and they put it to his mouth and when jesus therefore had received the vinegar he said it is finished and he bowed his head and he gave up the ghost may the lord had his blessings to the word now it is a it is a hard scripture you all can have your seed because we're going to testimony and i don't want to preach because i've got something for after the service and i'll try my best to be fast because i know it's um wednesday but what happened this weekend was something that i haven't experienced in a long time okay because we had ministers local ministers all come down in a space of three weeks the whole thing was put together everybody showed up there was no no camp or no anything yet camp was there the believers that was there they just all got along the food was served we ate in the church then we cleaned up the church then we had church then we danced in the church and we cleaned up the church then we had church you know and then we ate some more and we fellowshipped them all we had church but see the one thing that i've realized is that's how heaven is because there i could be who i want to be there i could be who i am really am i don't have to fake pretend i don't have to keep my guard up i don't have to try to to always keep it in to say i love jesus you say that in your workplace people look at you funny but we still love him there's no everybody's got one goal we love the lord and i just want to quickly touch on a couple of things that was said and then i'll open it up for testimonials because that might help you because me being me i turn around i forget about it instantaneously so i'll just share a couple of things that stood out very first service very first service we had it at the title and it was holy spirit versus enticing spirits and in one thing that brother terest said that just anchored in my soul he says there's always going to be a fight between the two there's always going to be a fight between the two and there is a fire and i say i just called it the lake of fire because we're on the winning team and who's ever on the other team will be pulled the loser gets pulled into the fire amen so it was very clear that once you pick a side there is fire so either the fire is going to save you or the fire is going to consume you but you choose brother isaac what you want the fire to do for you amen and that dovetails so much with your sermon it was so beautiful see god has a mind so and that's that's the friday night when we showed up so for you wasn't there that i'm just giving you a bit of a you know we missed you all we missed you all you all were missed okay so it's not like you're excluded from this you can share a testimony it doesn't need to be about the weekend it's what what god puts on your heart so i'm just just throwing that out there and then we had brother andy come up with disappointment to divine appointment and i was jubilating look look i was just i i've learned a new word rapturnessness was it rapturousness that sounds like me thank you i appreciate it i like it when english-speaking people teach me english because i only speak in a self-defense but what i got out of your service is and he could have touched a lot about it but he said that there's the tomb and mary turns towards the tomb trying to find god in a place where he's not because he's alive and he's risen and then he paralleled it with believers today that's still looking for a god of history that's still trying to find him there in a denominational world that's still trying to find him in a grave that's sealed the graves no longer sealed it's open so we can't look to up to a pastor or a individual the word is open so if the word is open we should turn to them and then and in our hurts and everything that was in the past if you could leave it in that too and you keep walking with the lord what can happen so so brother andy god bless you thank you very much for me that's what i got out of it i don't want to look into my past and see a dead tomb yes it's part of my testimony but i want to look at the living god and i want to walk forward with him amen and so don't worry this is definitely not me preaching and uh getting fully into god fully into worship you know giving it all if you get here if you sing a special if you show up to church show up with everything don't don't leave nothing don't leave nothing because you'll be disappointed because you will not get anything because you reap what you okay and if you throw something upon the water shall it return to you well then what you're gonna put into the service is what you're gonna get out that's just how it is newton's third law say for every action is an opposite but equal reaction that means if i take a tennis ball and i whack it at that wall it's going to come back to me the equal force and that is just that's just the world grabbing a little bit of our bible which is written first and taking that and putting it in layman's terms but the real thing is you reap what you sow and if you sow evil you'll reap more because it's going to come back to you tenfold so that's just me and fellowship then then we had brother um cubin man what a life that guy lived so so he said something which was very very it kind of struck me here because i always said to these young men and marion as a witness i said to them if you can keep your testimony if you can keep the testimony if you can live clean if you can overcome through this message which gave you all the answers the word is open if you can just hold on to it and don't go try to find some cool testimony some scar some hurts if you can bypass that you have done far greater far greater than any of us that came out of the world you don't need a massive testimony you don't need to go standing and try to be a a ron spencer with the the cancer that he's fighting and all those things you don't try to have to be this massive believer that if you believe in god you'll have your battles but it doesn't need to be in the world and when he said that he says don't brothers sisters whatever you do do not chase after a big testimony because they're going to find it in the world and think that god will save them and then they'll have this massive testimony and there'll be something in the church it's a lie so if you can keep clean and live holy that is a far greater testimony and that's what i got from him and he said you should pray pray and pray for your children amen and then we had brother um afridi that went up and and he made it very clear that he's 87 years old and he was preaching like a 18 year old you know so and the one thing i got from him man if i'm his age one day hey and i'm jumping around and preaching with all that that everything in me and being resolved and not being scared of evil he wasn't scared to go toe-to-toe with satan and that's the thing is now if you really look at at natural terms if 87 year old man comes to you and he rolls up he sleeps and he says i'm going to punch you okay seriously as a young man you'll go what i'm telling you if i was satan and brother freddie comes to me and says i'm going to punch you i would go oh dear okay i would run because that man has a testimony he has a life he has a burden and he said if i'm going to serve god and if i die here and this and he said oh to allah brothers he says if i die in a service you ain't burying me you are praying and i'm coming back to life and he didn't say it as he was downing it he said it because it's going to happen that way and he will pray and people he will stand up there because he believes in the resurrection amen and that's why i said this message lives and then he said one thing he really said except from devils that will scatter because that's the ba that's the being you are you've got the holy ghost in you and there wasn't one fight when jesus was upon this earth that he lost and now he's not on earth but he's in us because with in his corporal body and he's still beating every devil it's the same god okay and he said one thing that stood out is his parents pray for your children parents pray for your children and we had a wonderful testimony and i pray you see that sister shannon i pray you just hear it tonight if it's on your eyes i maybe just call you up by the way and just say to share it because because the power of prayer goes beyond what we could comprehend and then we had our pastor stand up brother being a what what a service look that wasn't i won't lie not because it's our pastor and nothing that was the lord speaking to all of us saying get back to true worship don't mock this is not a game they mocked and they scorched and they did all those things and where that they end up do not ask do the same because we have all the answers and people sometimes take those answers of the message and all the quotes of brother branham and all the things that are read in bible and they start flicking it out that's not that's not worship worship is if you take that word and you give it back to him you say lord let it grow in my life i i i was changed after that i can promise you that thank you brother ben god bless you it was one thing he did say he said simon he said simon simon got dressed he ate his breakfast he went and there was a commotion and he got there and then they called him and said you simon take that cross it wasn't who he was it wasn't how long he's been in the message it wasn't how many hail marys he said or how many praises said it was simon you carry their cross there was no nothing of his history there except for where he came from and after that simon's life changed because when he picked up the cross and the blood of jesus christ was dripping on him that changed because then for the first time the cross really meant something to me to say but why do they always say pick up your cross and follow jesus they don't say pick up the nice fancy cross without the blood stains and all those things that's there on the wall like the betrayment they say pick up that cross the one that's full of blood the one that our master carried pick up that cross and take that with you and carry it all the way there and we forget sometimes that the cross when people preach the cross we forget we think it's a wooden stick it is where our master has bled and died on so when they say do that it means wake up wake up it's not it's not what the world makes it to be it is your cross become one with your sacrifice and keep going forward he didn't say take it back and let's see if jesus can do it again they say pick it up and walk and he did that and he was blessed for it because how many years later did that little girl come and brother branham prayed for her and said because simon the lord hasn't forgot about it and she received a sight back it's moments like that that changes your life forever so god bless you so that was what i got out of the weekend i do believe when i went there i thought it was going to be it was going to be totally different and thank the lord it was because yeah i'm not i'm not the same i'm definitely not the same praise the lord so if there's anybody that has a testimony in the mics open what we'll do is we'll do one or two testimonies we'll sing a cup a song again then we'll do a testimony of this more we'll do a song and then we'll actually just close the evening and i'll maybe just deliver a bit of mail that the lord gave me and then then we go into prayer and we go home so i don't want to stretch out the night too long i'm looking at the time so anybody with a testimony it's just a shannon [Laughter] did i did i did that right sister yes please it is very important because these young children on that screen they're looking and they would love to hear that and these mom and dads that need to hear that too i already gave it last time oh um bear with me if it's not the mic it's going to be my eyes um but okay where do i start so the testimony i gave it was the one of the best camps i've ever been to or best meetings i've ever been to and the reason why was because i'm thank you because god is god of miracles and there's nothing too hard for him and i have a son my eldest son who met god himself and wanted to be at the camp for the first time um so the previous camps and he's actually lighting up my whole house on fire with god [Applause] i think satan knew that he would um be the way he is so he tried all he could but god is um and he's powerful he knows he knows the right timing god's got the right timing amen so my testimony was um it was about four or five years ago when things started when when you're a mom that's all you want is your family to see your children serving the lord because the lord became very precious to me when i was 21 years old i met him and he saved me and oh man when brother freddie gave that um his thing you could just see the lord he's risen he's real and when you've met him you know he's real he walks and talks with you anyway so you want that for your children and that's all i i lived for you know is to have the lord in me um and then you know of course you want him to you want to see him and others and definitely your family and so when i when i started seeing things going um the other way i freaked out poor dave he's my first child too so um i yeah i freaked out um and um i probably got more stricter as well thinking that i would because i would i would wrap him in cotton wool if i could and not let him go down the places i went down so um but the lord had other plans um and then so um so when i saw him doing that um i started stressing out quite a bit and you know you in of course you take it to the lord and but i um uh yeah i started going gray and i started losing my hair which apparently my mom is hereditary when she stresses she lose her loses her hair so i came up for prayer and brother ferdi prayed for me and it was so profound because when you come up here and you get prayed for that's no longer the preacher that's god himself and um so he prayed for me and i knew it wasn't him it was god speaking and he said lord please forgive her. and i thought man that's profound isn't it please forgive her and i knew why he said it because i was doubting the word and i was worrying and i was taking it upon myself so i i took that away and it was over years and it was getting um you know yeah wasn't the funnest and um and then um there were a few songs that came through my path uh along the way and one of them was um uh sister latabo sung it actually when when it was really dark and some dark places um sister latabo sung the song this is how i fight my battles because um that you got to a place where you're just so burdened you don't even feel like you know uh being around people or worshiping or anything like that and then satan tries to take your joy and he tries to take your worship away from god who who he hasn't changed um and then latabo sang this is how i fight my battles talk about a burden that left lifted and then um when something happens in your home when when there's strife in your home it not only is with the children it can come you know it can satan wants to just take over your whole family so it could come and and try to he wants to destroy um the family and marriages and things like that and there was there was another part another song that um isaac's saying and it was um not today satan and i knew that was for me because i was um believing lies and um and it really and sister bronwyn had a vision as well about the butterfly in the um whales belly if you remember that and i know it's for a few people i know it touched my touch me as well because i realized i was looking at lying vanities um instead of god's word god's word is true and it is real and it says um in the book of acts for the promises unto you and your children and to all that are far off and he says our children will possess the gates of the enemy it's not a hope so it's they will it's done it's done it was done before the foundation the world it's not a hope so it's gonna happen and um and then on the camp um last camp uh dave i don't know you were kind of in that spot where you were kind of still in the world kind of one foot in the world one kind of wanting to go to the lord and uh one two rules are in our house one is no drugs or alcohol in our house and you go to church and so um because he wasn't planning on going to the meeting we were gonna lock the house and and he would have to camp on the lawn unless he came and praise the lord he came and um and it was a real blessing and we sang that song oh man that's why i stood up i had to stand up each time it was sung um the goodness of god and it oh because we were singing that at that last camp and we were praising and i was praising the lord like it hadn't happened quite yet but it was it was it was it was there it was coming and so this camp this camp um this camp uh his word was made manifest so that everyone can see it because it was made manifest before foundation of the world but now my son met the living god and it's not just my god it's his god and he's risen so we have a son who has lost his amnesia we have a son who's come back to christ um and i love how isaac put it he said um because i was the one that was doubting and isaac said to me he said no david's a dove he's got a homing device and that's all our children they've got a homing device in them so when they go out they know where home is in christ and he's gonna they're all gonna come back they they i mean it's done so start rejoicing it's actually done okay [Applause] and davey you're awesome young man god bless you so we're going to ask brother isaac just to sing us lead us in a song or sing a song stand up so everybody stays awake remember this is this is the service is you this this is this is for the lord between you and the lord so what what you want to put in you're going to get out so so you just draw it out guys this is testimony this is life this is god working amen [Music] [Music] this is [Music] this is [Music] surrounded by you it may look like [Music] oh [Music] this is this is [Music] thank you [Music] i'm surrounded by you [Music] this is and this is and this is [Applause] [Music] is [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] it may look like i'm surrounded surrounded by you it may look [Music]

praise the lord amen we could keep worshiping one night but we've got more testimonies to get through so you can have your seats amen amen the only reason i asked brother isaac to sing the songs is i don't know any keys amen see hallelujah that's how you fight your battles it's not us it's him you just call him he'll sort him out he's defeated him so many times before who wants to share their testimony reuben amen i was really blessed by a song that brother keeping uh kubin's church saying that was that one that talked about that promise and it said about i can't quite remember the song but jonah just told me what was it again oh nothing impossible that song i just loved it and it really blessed my heart [Applause] [Music] [Applause] anybody else sister lundy see i like it when it happens hey we can't stop testifying because that's what we do because it's not about us it's giving him the glory hey testify sister you tell him this is it's not about the weekend but it's been it's been coming a long way and um so since well last year with this whole covert thing that started and everything there was such a fear in me about the whole thing and as a christian you know you're not supposed to fear and you know you're not supposed to dwell on those things and all of that but it got to a point where i actually physically got sick the fear just was so big and and that i i started having all these symptoms and it felt like i couldn't breathe and i it was just so real and i was trying to explain it to everyone and he said that he can't he wants to climb into my burden but he can't because he he just doesn't have any fear around the whole covert thing and um it kept every time that i started feeling like that i started singing or i started reading the word or i put a sermon on or or just because it i made the mistake of reading too much and about what is going on in the world and wild all everything and it it got got to a point where it got too much and i led the devil too much freedom in my life around that and um so the one i i was sick and i just decided that i'm not gonna and i i started realizing but this is not a physical fight that i'm fighting this is a spiritual fight that i'm fighting and um every time that i felt like that i started reading or i started praising the lord or and that it completely it completely went away but then after when this whole thing started over again it came back and i thought but lord why i thought i had this i've overcome this the fear is gone everything is is gone and i started just doing the same thing and and starting going back back to the word and every time the fear is is upon me and i even went to to got to a point where i put a timer on my i completely blocked all the news and everything on my phone so that i couldn't access any of it to help me to just completely put that away so that i can i can be in the word and go to the word instead of going to to to the world side of it and the more i started testifying the more satan tried to just bring bring that fear back and bring that fear back and i was testifying to um to naomi the one day as well and i said to her but i know the lord has taken this away but i know satan is trying to to to bring it back to me and um every time the lord just gave me that every time that came back and i thought lord but what do i need to learn out of this what is the what is the lesson that i need to learn why do you keep bringing this back to me and um the more i started this every time i started testifying on you okay satan just came back and then then the the battle got real because then jono tested positive and then all of a sudden i realized okay but now i've been testifying and saying all of this is gone and the lord has taken her away but now is the real testing time do i still fear this thing and do this thing i still have a hold on me or not and then i realized but that's why the lord said sargent i had to physically get into the fire be in the fire to see the fourth man to see but the lord is there and he's taken that away and i don't realize how big fear can be and how it can absolutely you with everything you're doing it is and and as a believer because you know you shouldn't but satan only needs one small thing and he can run with it if you let it run if you give him that space to run and i'm thanking the lord that all of that and through all of that and through everybody that was sick that fear is completely gone and he has taken all that fear and i'm just i'm thankful for him for that that is amazing [Applause] [Music] amen brother isaac will you lead us in another song you can stand up again and please just praise the lord [Music] [Music] i am a child of god i'm no longer i'm no longer i am a child of god i am a child of god you unravel me with a melody [Music] deliverance from my enemy to and i am a child of god [Music] from eternity you have chosen me your love has called my name i've been born again i've been born again into your family your blood grows [Music] [Music] [Applause] i'm no longer [Music] [Music] you split the sea amen and you split the sea so i can walk right through it my fears [Music] you rescue me [Music] [Music] my fears [Music] i am [Music] [Applause] [Music] i am a child of god oh yes i [Music] am no longer [Music] oh god i'm no longer i'm no longer a slave to fear for i am [Music] i am a child of god amen who is a child of god amen you're no longer a slave to fear amen fear is a liar and a very terrible one because he states the obvious he can't see until the unseen he can't even see in front of his own nose he can only see what god wants him to see so don't give him power amen can have your seat saints don't give him power sister landy thank you for your testimony you know see david had the testimony in the bible and his testimony was that he also got stuff wrong and every other believer so if you think believers are just guys that believe everything and just overcome everything and have no struggles and just walk and it's kumbaya and everything is fine it's not how it is it's a war it's a battle it is every day when you wake up like brother freddie said he said every day he made it to that that that that study of his he said i won that is christianity ain't given to you on a silver plate definitely not life everlasting is given to you but you're going to fight all the way there amen testimony brother ben our sister know me you're after brother ben um i've been praying for my friend um it was looking pretty bleak for a while there from but um yeah he got off so i just want to give the lord thanks that he's a free man today and i know he's real happy um the lord's working great miracles really in connor's life and miller they don't see it all the time but they're definitely asking heaps of questions he rang me tonight we've gone there for a few me and maybe there for a few nights for dinner here and again and i've just stopped them and prayed for the food and he rang me tonight to say that they tonight they just stopped and prayed for the food so yeah i thank you for your prayers for them because yeah they're top lads and they need jesus most most people need jesus yeah i sort of touched based on devo man it was a massive battle when i came into bellingham it was quite close to me um and then it was like he just got ripped away like satan just took him it was like and he wasn't the same person and you know being a christian's it's real hard like it's real easy in this room but it's real hard and the hardest part was um he came down one day and the devil was just working and he decided he wanted to punch me and i had a broken leg and everything in me just wanted to fight back and i i couldn't walk after my brace on and i just i battled for so long to forgive him and then the lord just shows you things and it's it's only over the devil you're like no it wasn't it was the person it's never the person the person who wants to hurt you is the demonic spirit on the person and we are in a battle so don't just keep loving people because that devil hates love and he hates you to overcome call you come sister know me i wouldn't date punch david i'm just keep now i'm just joking um just when lundy came up here at um she was talking about you didn't name the devil but his name is anxiety and um it just um after you said that i was um when we were singing i was counting in my head and when i was 24 which um i just calculated what is seven years ago um i was fighting the same devil and i didn't know what was going on but then i had an anxiety attack and all this random like having all these symptoms and um yeah so i talked to a few friends and they're like just feed on the word so that's what i did and that's how i overcame and um got some got my cousin who was who had just had a real experience with the lord to pray for me and different things like that and that's how i overcame and i was just calculating in my head um when we were singing how how many years ago was that and i was like it was seven and then i was like oh what month did that start because i remember the exact day when those symptoms started happening and i just realized it's almost like in about a week it would be exactly seven years and i was thinking that's so cool perfection amen our god is so cool amen he is mighty he is almighty any other one more taste oh here we go oh i've got two brothers now fighting for the mind you go you it's the opportunity you taste the fat brother good evening saints thank you for all the testimonies that it's been shared this evening mind is not a testimony as such but it is a testimony i'll testify to god right um firstly the devil tried to hold me back i was down at covert didn't know where they were going to make the meetings i made a booking for four nights with my family to go to palmerston and to enjoy the services i was talking to brother tears i was excited for what the lord is going to do in manawatu for what the lord is going to do amongst the fielding fellowship they never had anything like this before so it was us as brothers and sisters to go and support them and i'm thankful for my pastor he never stops any one of us if we say we're going whether it's fielding whether it's taranaki whether it's auckland whether it's south island he allows us to go because we want to break this devil's walls down we want to we want to annihilate the devil and let him know we're going to trample all over him to get there so he tricked me by giving me covert and he kept me at home and i couldn't come for the sunday service here brother isaac preached and if you know my wife sister shannon i can't share the screen with her you you need to own this so i thought i was just going to listen in to the word you know and and and when you when you streaming in when you're youtubing and i shared that with pastor today you're not dedicated you're not yes the children are running by or the dog went past and somebody walked past the front and and you your eyes get taken away straight away but when we're in the church when we are together whether it's it doesn't have to be a church as such it has to be a place of worship that we can all come and gather and we we look forward we look up we look we look for the for our lord so you're you you're in one accord you're ready for this you're ready to give it all you got as you said when you come to church you want to give it everything you want to come here ready right and you want to receive everything that's coming for you you're not worried about your neighbor your wife your children for me and for you so i was ready to go to manoa too and this all come about and then i get a message on saturday evening from my pastor how are you doing brother we're missing you are you okay are you joining us and then a couple of minutes later my deacon brother in the back there how are you brother what's happening we missed you we haven't seen you um we need you uh hold on i'm just one person but when i got there on sunday morning and i said to him i'll see you all bright and early i left home early my wife and my family we got up there and lo and behold to me my brothers are there before me you know how wonderful it was to know that my brothers were standing in the gap before me normally on a sunday we are early we come to church we do all those kind of things but to see my brother's faces brother matt brother brother ed everyone ready because i was not there to do my part my brothers stood in my gap to do that whatever was necessary my pastor was there it is so important that we all go and we do these things manual too was similar to wellington very dry for a long time but i can tell you after this weekend after this weekend the ground is broken the ground has been tilled the four-man letter rain has dropped praise and worship after the service because of the victory we were dancing we were singing brother onions all respect to you brother isaac respect to you because when you give the right people the mic after the word has been preached the anointing is false you don't have to be a singer you don't have to be a songwriter you don't have to be a preacher when the glory of the lord falls you just have to bathe in his spirit sister well done sister shannon well done people that got into the tune into the one accord of the god's word when it was preached and after the songs came that's all what was needed for manoa too that place has been shaken that place has been stirred the ground has been tilled the rain has fallen all those dry seeds those rotten seeds are now gonna bud all those people that have been in manoa too that heard this word before and have fallen away that life is going to come through now it's all because of all your support for your praying for the for the people coming together it was the most important thing and brother freddie said something that was very important that stood out for me he said and he took it upon himself as a pastor it's us pastors holding the people back to join each other and it's important because we our pastor that's why i said i respect my pastor because he doesn't stop anyone to go brother and paul he wasn't with us but he was with us you was in taranaki but he was doing the same thing in taranaki that we were doing in fielding because of our past days allowing us to go share the word share our love support the people support the brothers that's what it is i missed you sister naomi on sunday i wasn't there but i believe you were there on saturday i was trying to get to see different things that was happening and you only can take him so much i was so excited i was so excited to get there on sunday and i danced with brother anyas and i enjoyed myself i can tell you when you're in the house of god you take your cap off put it on the seat and just be yourself you know you brother you just have to be yourself there's no there's no putting on a face whether you came with this ugly face as mine there when you leave you'll have a handsome face god bless you thank you one more brother and then we'll we'll sing a song and then maybe just god bless you um i i was expecting much more testimonies and i'm still expecting more statista to come [Laughter] did i see properly sister on the group so i thought i would be like ahmad is here okay i my my one is is based on amos chapter three i think it's verse seven i think amos three verse seven who knows that scripture and daniel thank you denny it says amos chapter 3 verse 6 shall a trumpet be blown in the city and the people not be afraid shall the evil in a city and the lord have not done it verse 8 you all know verse 7 the lion hath road who shall not fear the lord has spoken who cannot but prophesy so i'm so glad to hear all these wonderful wonderful testimonies and i could feel when i was in taranaki that there is fire burning manawatu site and i was following some of the services we also had a wonderful time and what i want to tell you is that if the lord speaks who can keep quiet if you find if the lord speaks and you keep quiet or nothing happens that you're going against that scripture if i lie on the rose here now by the door there's going to be an action and he's the lion of the tribe of judah isn't he so glad to see you brother steve i went and took a seat there in taranaki so what i want also to say was that you know brother and sister when you you you you always get what you expect and if you expect the lord to be with you in the car he's going to be with you in the car and you know how he he comes when you think and you talk to him he comes you can't i can't expect the lord to come when i'm not thinking about him i'm not talking about him i'm talking about other things and then how can he come so he came also on on thursday night on our way to taranaki as we were talking talking all of a sudden the spirit of the lord just broken everybody was just crying and praying and loud as we could and i i can't explain what happens it's because you know one day brother then said you know atmosphere is everything atmosphere is everything so so we went to taranaki they are greeting you we had a wonderful time with the milan family we were with brother marion we had a wonderful evening together and his siblings and your sister also we had a very good time together brother daniel we also spoke about you and but we had a good time the footsteps of the righteous are out of the lord so the last thing that i want to say is that he's coming soon he's coming very soon brother adrian preached about this and he said you know you know i was telling brother end yesterday you see you've got to be under the uh what's the weight india told you when there is a revival a revival you you are a revival yourself now when when when the revival goes away the devil strikes when every time when the revival goes away the devil's tracks when the the revival was coming to england there was no war but when the revival left or was struck so every time keep the revival in your heart let me keep revival doesn't matter what is happening around me keep him closer because when you keep him closer he comes he comes very close amen and lastly i dreamt last night but i'm waiting for the interpretation of the dream it was about the rapture i always ask the lord lord give me a heavenly dream so last night i dreamt that we were going we were leaving and now i don't remember all the dream but i'm waiting for it to be interpreted i don't know how it's going to happen but we i think very soon we are going and that's what i'm thinking so may the lord bless [Applause] you that's a fake um i've spoken to sister tisa she was thinking she's gonna share her whole testimony so also how she came to the lord so if you guys we've got a little bit of a sermon if you want to hear it we do it now or do we do it another time it's up to you i i've wednesday's church for me so i don't care so are you guys here do you want a year how long do we have sister teaser if you hit the highlights we can color it in later you can sit down and do it but then the camera doesn't see you hey but if you wanna here you go amen good evening this is my testimony i now have a reason to live to glorify he who is seated in the heavenly places the most high i had transformed mentally and spiritually my last few years was endlessly searching for this faith polluted by the world i was a mere mortal in this temporary world that incites love but to my dismay more hate through that i carried my pain and transgressions and despair my walk is now a continuum of living a holy life for jesus christ i recently felt in my heart to be baptized for the second time merely at first i was hearing but not a doer nor fully comprehending the life of our lord and his will for me so on a sunny afternoon i was welcomed by his presence crying out in tears of joy the knowledge of who he said he was to me we get closer to god when we pray like we never have before and come to him with all our sorrows angst and truly believe strengthening faith with fellowship and church through our lord this priceless gift offered to all not only speaking with words but dispersing of the flesh just that tent of ours just a free fall into my savior jesus christ without a shadow of doubt in all his amazing glory what was revealed of the holy spirit was this pure knowing i was being embraced and assured like a long lost father that you belong to him eternally i recall at the time i was shaken but i understood what real love was i had been in complete awe tears of piety and joy and a total rebirth he was in my presence and i now understood i had felt unwavering goodness spiritually i had been shaken by the merciful act of this great the great i am who will lead me in light and by surrendering all with faith walk righteously so i may please my father in heaven so now i surrender joyfully by hiding myself in jesus christ foregoing all fears shortcomings desires and doubts i lay it all at his feet so this is my verse speak lord for thy thir servant heareth and knowing that my god yeshua that he lives in me and this is unspeakable joy for me thank you god bless you amen we call just stand we quickly read the word sister teaser when you meet the lord and all our believers would know when you have a personal experience with the lord it changes you and i used to listen to metallica and all those type of things and and all this worldly music and actually what happened is oh we got another testimony here we go amen oh we got mo oh bring it on amen hold on just want to put you on you you can have your seats i apologize i was waiting for everyone from the services to have that chance before i come so i realized that i'm being closed out over a few months i'm saying starting from last year i've been hearing preachers they would be preaching and then they'll talk about youtube paramount was just saying that when you're a christian it's not just all blissful you have your battles to overcome we all have to be overcomers so you go through a battle you think you're alone but the more it keeps on being said on the pulpit you realize that you're not alone and i was going to sit down and not say anything but i thought you know what if i was not the only one let me just share my testimony perhaps it can help someone i would say there they would preach i would make my pledge with god and said i will not watch tv i'll call it tv and i will try to stay away from reading too much books because i'm a reader and you find that you even know that okay if i'm looking at a title here for me to know whether it's clean or not i have to go to dove and check is it clean if it's okay for kids to even watch i'm going to watch it but it takes your time from the weed yes it's a very clean thing that you're doing you can sit there your kids can sit there and watch what you're doing not a problem but it takes your time from the word and when the devil tries to make distraction he tries to make total distractions so that what you're doing is going to stop you from growing spiritually and it's going to stop you from growing with your career and i would be sitting there asking myself where exactly is this leading you because at least if you were studying and then you're going to tell me that what you're doing is going to help you progress with your career at least that would be something if you were reading spoken with and listening to the word and you're saying when you live there you can share the word with someone that would be beneficial to your spirit but if whatever you're doing is not benefiting those two it's just for entertainment just i had a very rough day i'm just winding down and then it becomes a habit that's where the problem starts but i realized that on my own i couldn't do it because it's something that you stop with your human abilities you reason with yourself you look at it you say you know what if i continue doing it i'm crucifying the lord jesus once more myself then you stop that's your own human abilities then three years or four years down the line you pick up the very same thing that you stopped four years ago you even ask yourself lord why i thought i'm an overcomer then what happened a few weeks ago i was sitting at home the young people came to pray and then normally either tiana would drop the tower or he'll ask one of us to come pick her up but that day she said i'm not coming back i'm going to be at church praying the whole night i'll come in the morning then that struck me i said okay it's normally parents praying for children now you look in there you realize that god is trying to work you are not giving in you're trying to work things out yourself i don't know what she's praying for but just the fact that she's going to be at church the whole night alone praying that struck me then the following day i received a message from sister hannah you because on the sisters group we pray for one another she says to me you're on my list for this week what can i pray for i said i've got only one request to be an overcomer then the ball started rolling from there and i just felt a weed lifting from me then the following week there was a brother who had a gift of divine healing and praying for people back home who passed on actually people trying praying for him he stopped them he said don't pray for me i am leaving he explained his circumstances how he saw himself going and then he doesn't want to be here anymore so you see people are different in new zealand and all the first world countries a wedding is a wedding and that's it a funeral is a funeral entertainment with us is it it's different every opportunity that we meet we reach out so that week of the funeral starting the thursday if not the wednesday they had services throughout and there was a revival for me i would see the i would be praising and worshiping four hours in a row and the following day the same thing it's because they started the midweek services with the family and they did the memorial service at church then the funeral as well was just the climax then i felt that what has been happening the past the previous week was really building up to something that is going to be a full overcoming for me then the next week i was sitting just finalizing wrapping up the week it was i think now it was actually the tuesday as i was sitting there i felt just something says stop the fasting normally i think about it and then i involve everyone and telling them that i'm going too fast then i started just there and i just involved i just told my husband tomorrow i'm starting here first i'm going to fast for seven days he said okay it's fine and the more you fast the more you pray then the one time i was kneeling down praying then i felt this unwelcome presence and then i knew that the fight is on now but with my eyes closed i saw i saw two demons standing right behind me trying to pressurize me with fear and then i told them your time is up this is where it ends so while i'm is struggling so you guys are the ones busy influencing me to carry on this way imagine what i'm fighting with looks very innocent because you wouldn't find me watching anything that is evil but look when i look behind me this is in the spirit world my eyes are closed i'm busy praying i can see those two demons so i'm just saying just watch what you're doing it may look innocent but it's not always innocent if it's if it's taking you away from god or if it's taking you away even from just progressing even with your career because if you're in this world you still need to be able to progress to be able to fend for your family so if what you are doing is making you be stagnant realize that is the devil behind that so i just want to give god the glory and the honor because on my own i wouldn't have done that but when i look at everything around that someone starting to pray the other one saying can i pray for you the other ones just giving testimonies after testimonies at a funeral service i keep looking back i'm saying so my revival came through a funeral service and it really just blows my mind i thank god for that god little amalekites that make their way in your life hey brother andy hey man i wasn't going to he was going to carry on and then sister sepi took the bold move amen god bless you sister sepi that was really awesome um so like actually it's quite interesting my testimony is it's gonna flow from that very well um these meetings were so powerful for me because we need the body we need each other and and i don't know if anyone really felt the theme was this was a body we're a family and we need each other so much and more than we realize because when we and this covert and all the pressure of society and everything that's come on and pressuring us is trying to separate us it's trying to part us it's trying to divide us and when we're away and apart and the devil's attacking our mind about this thing and that thing and and it's all just a bunch of lies and it gets festering in our minds and we beg and well i'm talking for myself you know and you begin to feel animosity a little bit carnal that's just a carnal man right and i'm definitely um that youtube i don't watch evil things or anything but i watch woodturning and it when you said wind down from a hard day it's exactly exactly and and it really that i that that was my reasoning i would do that i would sit down and i'd put on you know everyone's gone to bed i might just watch some wood [Laughter] someone turning wood on the lathe you know i'm just watching that that's my prime time with jesus prayer time fighting a battle praying for people praying for myself and so you know i would do that and and and and you know over the last however long you know a year you could say um just being busy um and you know i just started getting flat and started getting carnal just begin to um become a bit i don't know detached emotionally detached socially even to the point where i don't even feel like going to church you know something that's how bad it can get and it can be so innocent just by not having a good spiritual revival in my life and you know what i was at these meetings and just being together and and i believe that it was ordained of the lord for us to be charged recharged and i believe that we've been recharged and something that really struck me for myself as i in the recharge and you know now we're in recharge stay charged for me you know i've been recharged and now i'm going to stay charged and that's a fight and for myself i'm fighting in prayer and spending time with the lord and feeding on the word and rejoicing just a pure joy in the lord because the spiritual man needs strength the spiritual man needs food if you don't if i don't feed the spiritual man i'm not going to preach so if i don't feed the spiritual man my old nature is going to get strong and then it starts dictating things and it starts wanting things and it starts the struggles that i've you know in the old man begins to starts to rise up so it's important that the spiritual man gets his food gets her food and a lot of it hey amen let's open our arms and say lord fill my cup to overflowing and and take advantage of every moment that we're together because our flick of fires together and it's more glory and then when we pray just lord fill me up i need to be full of the holy ghost i need to be full of your love and and that's been something that's been such a blessing to me over this weekend is that i've been filled with as love and without being spiritually strong there's no way we can handle the pressure of this world and so i believe to this is me in revival amen and so alleluia i believe that we can all be in revival hallelujah let's stand with each other for each other in revival and let's feed each other if someone comes to my place to to fellowship i'm going to make sure i give them food not just natural spiritual food if i come to your place please give me spiritual food because i'm hungry and i'm needy amen we all need each other and we need him and it's god with skin on amen amen hey listen i can do this all night you know me hey i i i'm a fool for christ so if you find this boring just shake yourself out because this is about to get better amen i i wasn't actually going to do this but um i actually said um to a few people over the weekend about how i felt about the weekend but with what sister sheppy said and with what andy said i thought there's no way i'm not going to give god the glory again okay so i'll we can give him the glory once and twice but we can give him the glory all the time okay so um um as most of you know i was struck down with covenant and i was actually really really sick and um it got to the point where i just was not getting better and every day was the battle and um anyway i started to get a bit better and um the friday night um was okay to go to the services but i was actually really tired at the end of it all and i got home and um saturday morning matt said to me just stay home and rest because he could see that that i was really it had taken a lot out of me and i was really really tired so um i took the opportunity to stay home and i actually i couldn't actually get out of bed on saturday morning and everybody had gone and i opened up youtube i opened up youtube and um and i was watching and then i started to get really really angry and i i was angry and i was jealous because i really wanted to be at the meetings on saturday but i i just couldn't give and i just i just didn't have the energy and i didn't have the strength and i was actually really i was laying in my bed and i was i was so angry with what this culvert was doing to me and how i was feeling and and all of that because it's not me anybody that knows me knows that i'm really not someone that just lays in their bed for days and days and days and days and my my kids will tell you i just lay in that bed for days and days and i couldn't actually get up and get out of it and i didn't know what was going on with me but the saturday morning i was just laying there and this anger was building up and and then andy's started to preach and he's um i was so disappointed with the whole situation and his title was from disappointment to divine appointment and it doesn't matter where you are you can be sitting in a church you can be sitting wherever i was laying in my bed with no energy and i didn't know what was happening and the lord came on the scene in a divine way he through andy he came into my room and he told me that i'm gonna be okay and he gave me the strength to be able to get up and i went from being angry and disappointed to having the strength to stand up and actually have a shower get dressed and i actually cooked lunch for sunday and be able to clean the kitchen and do things and it went from being anger and disappointment to a total divine appointment with the lord and it didn't it didn't matter that i was laying in my bed but if that appointment i had that appointment with him at that time as sick as i was he came through to me in my bed and rose me up and it was it was so appropriate over the weekend jesus rose so did i i rose out of my bed and i face the world and since then every single day i've been getting better and stronger and i've not laid in that bed again so i just want to thank the lord for that and thank you andy for you know just heeding always heating to the lord's call and and you know for the way the lord uses you and for how you stood in the gap thank you for that too [Applause] i got the deacon looking at me so let's just get the deacon up here hey brother andy you said you were having a revival i would never ever in my life picture you having such a quiet revival in front of us i thought you'd be going through this room man you should have been holding it back okay god bless you saints and um thank you sister teaser for breaking the ice because it was now you that now opened up the floor i was just like brother and paul waiting for the testimonies to come and there you go i was asking the lord if i if i can say this over the stream that objectively i am in the best church in new zealand he hasn't answered me yet so i might be in trouble i love you all i love you all and um just quickly breaking it down so on monday night so last monday um i sent out a little text we've got a little whatsapp group for them for our mobile sound and streaming and i said um why do i hear a little birdie chip that we are doing the sound and streaming at this feeling meetings because me and lundy we were starting to think oh we're gonna have an awesome time next to each other just gonna rejoice by the way it was our wedding anniversary on sunday i was like that was perfect yeah [Laughter] and uh yeah here comes the work so the lord the lord knows and i've and i've made a vow to him we will labor while it's day and that's why we're here so yes so and and the lord blessed brother armand brother matthew at the back so so relaxed and i'm stressing lundy says i don't fear i don't fear covet at all but if there's nothing planned and we supposed to do things i i get a bit jittery anyway so they were so calm and so relaxed and i have got questions i think brother armand's question he said brother brother alpha's sound was the only concern he had the sound coming from brother alpha i said i'm very glad you've got only one concern i've got several so that's how that conversation started but in all honesty everything everything worked out everything worked out brother matt went beforehand looked at the facility by the way all the everything that you saw in the church not in the kitchen ran on two plugs two plugs that in itself it's it's incredible that that that's not the town hall that's that's providing that power i can tell you in that the lord was there before us and he started preparing because he saw he knew right so with that in mind and with the week going on i've been making plans for the monday because we didn't have services sorry yeah yeah monday i would have gone hunting or something but then there was this opportunity for me to to get some meat and everything and i was telling a friend yes you know i'll make a plan we can we can do it i think i said on saturday was it saturday initially and then it just couldn't work out so i had to go back to to him and say is there any way we can move it out to monday and um again that's the lord he came back and said yes yeah because now we're talking i'm throwing other other people's plans now on the road and then and and everything just worked out and i said thank you very much we could we can do that on monday and get together within the meeting so in the meetings i was i was tremendously tremendously blessed with each uh message and and i won't go into that because brother monty you gave us the highlights but but sunday was was was big sunday night sunday afternoon nights sermon we came on monday and and this this thing i organized was to slaughter some sheep and it tied in so perfectly after brother ben's sermon that i saw this in real life i had the blood on my hands for real life i i saw that when that sheep is on its feet it just wants to get away but once you've got them in that position josh you can testify he tried it he pulled it up first time put it on its bum put it down and it you could pit it it was so it just gave up it was surrendered and what was what was actually quite sad was it was ready it was ready to be to to give its life and we did it and and there was no struggle or anything but that got so real to me that he here it is we can we can preach as much as we like but here it is and don't you worry the amalekites were there they were trying to come in into those meetings so being in a in a position that i am unfortunately we see the good and the bad but brother andy i'm so glad you said that that i saw a body i saw a body of believers i saw walls broken down i saw people that's just hungering to fellowship around the world be amongst people of like-minded faith because what we are hypocrites out there praise the lord and here i have my true identity and with that i got to love people more because they identified the malachite immediately addressed it immediately got it out the door immediately i i have more love for people like that now because they they they knew as well they knew as well imagine quickly it was just standing there sorry i'm taking a bit of time um when moses was a baby and he was in the basket what would that that princess or whatever pharaoh's whoever would they have done the same if they know what they know now they would have killed that baby they had the law it was it was there and what happened so the same don't pit this malachi don't don't make it grow get it out the door so praise the lord this this weekend was awesome the week is already a challenge so praise the lord i love it amen [Applause] got one thing in my testimony and i've got todd's just burning in with me um i'm just so happy to be part of this church church is so so important to be part of a body of god and even with david like i was thinking i'll give a testimony you know what i was thinking about david i don't mean to you know make it all about david but um i was thinking man that boy has had so much prayer put into him and god's put so much people into his life and what would we be without each other like i was just thinking oh he he put three young men down at the bottom of our house marian bin john and he went over there probably disturbed them and so they would pray for him they prayed for him all the time and then i've got precious sisters and brothers who's in the same boat praying for for him and praying for our children and then i've got brother ben started counseling sessions would go 45 minutes to our house when we were filming would pick him up have him over and then he would take him back um and then sister melissa the myburg family lived by us going through a hard time they would start praying then sister robin i it was amazing i would tell her sister robin he's um dave can i go into two details hey can i go into two details um i said look he just he he's he's smoking things he shouldn't be smoking he needs to get off it so she would go pray the next week he'd be off it then i told him he needs a job that she'd pray the next week he was he wanted a job because he he wanted to he wanted to be on the dole you know so he didn't want to be on the dole anymore a week later and then another time there was four different people in this church in this church said i have had david on my heart so bad this week i've been praying for him four people they didn't they didn't come together and say i'm praying for it individually they came to me and said man i've got him on my heart and then uh the gloin see david out of kelson that same week and said man i've had we saw david we prayed for him he had a near-death experience in a vehicle that drowned and he almost died in a river so oh this church is so important and i'm just so thankful for all of you i really love you and i'm i just love coming every time so praise god david i'm looking forward to your testimony bro you can share it anytime when you're ready amen so we're just going to close the evening because it is going going a bit later on it's a are still early we can still go along but hey amen who loves the lord amen you wouldn't show up if you don't love him you know what he loves you more okay yeah here we go brother come in i love this stuff hey this is what this is what we're made of you're challenging me [Laughter] family i want to say something about pastor moses that fielding i met pastor moses 20 years he is soft and loving and supportive and encouraging from the day i met him till today he's that type of man he's a man that'll stand by you shoulder to shoulder you preach that your sweat but in the grind with you that is pastor moses i backslidden my family backslidden we left the message church we went out after five years in new zealand to the salvation army pastor moses met me he wasn't a pastor at the time he was a brother and he greeted me the same way and after i left he greeted me the same way when he saw me always greeted me shook my hand he said man of god i didn't know what it means i didn't i didn't take any notice because i was away from the missed church i was running away david i've been there all right i was running away because i didn't want this and i didn't want that and i wanted to be comfortable i want a little bit of youtube i want some some movies yeah but this man of god saw me the same from day one till sunday when i met him he greeted me the same way now who can be that that is only god in the man god is living in him therefore he's a pastor today right so i just wanted to share that little bit because brother moses never changed the way he saw me he never changed the way he looked at me he never changed when he greeted me or he had didn't have anything in him to say oh you run away before no he greeted me the same way so that is very important for brother moses he's got a very special place in my heart because of that simple thing of his simplicity that god has made him in that way that he could touch you he could love you he could respect you for who you are whether you are struggling whether you're on top of the world whether you're down in the gutter the same so i just want to say thank you to brother moses if he's watching this we appreciate you and we respect you as a pastor amen [Applause] the brother bean looks like he wants to say something all good come on brother [Applause] amen glory hallelujah 100 charged amen we're going to stay charged you see that i like that amen praise the lord amen god bless you yeah i it was tremendous just for the family of god to come together what a beautiful bouquet god has different flowers amen i had a great time a real great time it was a battle but uh i heard brother ron spencer say he'd say that um someone would be battling the devil all week he says hold on devil i'm going to go to church i'm going to get my payday you know and then finally payday comes and then there'll be an old sister says let's have church so it was like that it was a battle up to the meetings but once we got there once i got there finally on sunday payday glory amen what a resurrection it is eh to see god and the people amen so i love you all proud of you all i think we're that's bad oh yeah no i lo i'm so good to see you there and be part of the meetings and just the bride is rising up she's rising up she's on her feet she knows who she is god's doing great things in this hour and god has given us grace to be part of it not just to be an onlooker but to actually possess the promise amen and to to embody that promise and body the word so i encourage you any amalekite comes around shoot it in the head this is not a kindergarten for the devil we kill it we can have more victory than this we can always have more victories how much do you want let's see let's see where the ceiling is there's no ceiling with gods let's just keep going up amen but god bless you we love you looking forward to greater times but yeah amen victory i mean god bless you [Applause] okay so let's let's close it um i'm gonna ask the musicians just to maybe sing us one song and then i'll give you a little thought i promise i won't be long because i need just to deliver some mail tonight we'll close with a song and you guys can go for the rest of your week you may see as much as you like my memory kicked in um so we're turning 10 in june we're turning double figures um i when brother freddie said that it's the pastors that keep people apart it's not the devil i decided i don't want to be worse than the devil so i happen to invite everyone um small detail we need a building so please pray for a building i haven't officially put an email out but i just happen to invite everyone that was there but hey why not i like a big party don't you you know don't want to sit in the corner and just blow a thing yourself and say happy birthday we must invite everyone so um yeah pray sister priscilla is on the job we have full confidence in you um but yeah let's just pray the lord will guide you to the right place either between here and why can i wherever just let's yeah because you see the hunger three weeks brother moses said he didn't even invite the whole country because the building was too small and covert restrictions were going on about three weeks all those people came we all came just because we want to i think people have come to a place where they just want to get in contact with the supernatural god it's not about like few years ago there was that convention in rotorua if i can say it maybe i'm trouble but it was all factions and this one's checking out this one and this one's standing against this one preaching it's this thing and it was terrible it was all but now that's gone we've taken a wrecking ball and just just bulldozed the walls and you know god but god's doing that so i'm exp yeah i believe we can have a big crowd praise the lord so let's pray for a building amen and uh yeah god bless you [Applause] i'm coming back to the heart of [Music] worship it's all about you it's all about you jesus [Music] jesus i'm coming back to the heart of worship and it's all about you [Music] it's all about you jesus i'm sorry lord if [Music] it's all about you just one more time to the heart of worship and it's all about you it's all about you jesus [Music] it's all about you [Music] it's all about you lord jesus as we open your word tonight lord thank you for the testimonies thank you for the lives that's been lived in this age lord the the people around us that when we are down on our knees or we down and out or we depressed or confused or or even lord just backslid these people praying for us these people that take time lord in their busy days to stop and say lord remember brother ahmad lord remember brother david lord remember this one i just stand shoulder to shoulder like brother kibin said as well and i just want to come and add my prayer and say lord be merciful see the situation be the first man in the fire lord because the fire is raging lord thank you for being that god thank you for being a living god that lord when my brother and sister prays i know they got me covered oh lord they covered me with their prayers lord i said tonight to sister these are lord as well i said my mom and dad prayed for me and i believe lord all those prayers were answered by you the mighty god lord and if they didn't pray for me lord where would i be today so lord as we open this word we asked lord that you would just drop a little thought into our hearts lord that would just give us strength and encourage us to move forward with you lord i pray this now as we open this in the name of our lord jesus christ we pray amen amen we can all have your seats we open the word musicians you can all have a seat as well i promise i'll try to be fast because i know we're late but i i need to say something here i love you all you're the reason i wake up in the morning i i am not a pastor by no means but i always thought if if i would ever lay my life down if if my last day was here upon earth i believe i'm going to take the rapture i'm just saying that just for the record but if the lord should take me before that time okay i want people to stand there and say you know what brother mund was a for real life christian amen and the devil hated him and he loved god and he walked with god amen and shouldn't be that all of our testimonies because see i'm going to put my notes away but there's one thing i want to say jesus said it is finished and then if we look at at john 18 he gets to a stage and and he says here and we know what happens there is he's in the garden praying and judas iscariot comes in with his posse of of dudes to come in and crucify our lord take him away and they come before the lord and they ask him this and this is the thing that caught me now they said they they said i want to read it to you i'll read it they went in john 18 and verse 4 it says jesus therefore knowing all things that should come upon him he knew he knew everything was going to happen right now i need your attention so if there's any children that want to sleep now i pray the lord would wake you up these testimonies that i will share is not to bore you and it's not to get you i know it's late but guys let's push just just five minutes man ten minutes let's push it back now okay because think about it children if jesus christ stopped in front of the cross and just said oh just i cannot do it sorry i had enough and he turned around he walked away we wouldn't be sitting here we couldn't overcome and we would have been nowhere because we weren't in the economy of god we weren't god's chosen people we were just here by grace never forget it god has no right you have no right in your life children to say i'm a christian god makes you what you are you are predestinated brother david you're predestinated but god don't owe us nothing he paid that price he doesn't know us nothing but he loves us so if we ask five minutes man give it your five minutes man is that last five minutes let's push it don't don't fall asleep you'll miss your blessing man it'll go right past you amen it says jesus says went forth and he said unto them who seek you but look he says jesus therefore knowing all that should come upon him so he knows what's going to happen he's standing there and he knows and he's looking them and he says who seek ye who do you seek and they answer him they say jesus of nazareth now who was with him judas so judas is here with all these guys he's just if you look at the whole book of john that i that i went through in chapter six he's been feeding 5 000 people he went over to um capernaum walked on the water gone on the boat went over all the boats went over with him because they wanted more bread more miracles more everything they wanted the easy thing and he said no no take other breed take my life take take something you can you cannot hunger again so so the people know what's going on and these people coming to arrest him is asking we want jesus of nazareth when they went there do you not think they knew who he was do you not think they had the knowledge of who they're going to arrest or they just blindly did it and just trust the word of a guy called judas that sold him for 30 pieces of silver they knew what they were doing this wasn't done in the dark but i want to show you something we want to go on and this is the thing that struck me and he says i am he and judas also which betrayed him stood with them so he's looking at this all and as soon as he said it i am he they went backward they went backward they fell backward now how many people has been in this message this is my burden and said i've experienced god i've seen miracles i've tasted of the bread of life i had experience and then when i say i am he i am he that died for you on the cross i'm he they fall backwards because look when they fell backwards what happened and they fell backward and they fell to the ground and he asked him again usiki and they said jesus of nazareth and jesus told them i am he if ye therefore ye seek me let these go their way now isn't it strange that we're in a message that gives us hope life love temperance okay meekness gentleness kindness brotherly love bringing us all together as as as all the testimonies here tonight saying we need each other we need god so if if we're all in one accord or going forward with the lord who's the ones kicking against the message brother qimin said it the ones that wants a little bit of the world who's the ones kicking and saying all these rules all these regulations you know it's a hard saying you know weep bands and cut skirts and no no no no whoa whoa hold on just hear me out who's the ones kicking against the message do they have any better do they have any better where do they go to they go backwards because see when the church ages was restored when all the seven church ages moved on god added and added and added and he never took away but when he came now in the form of a prophet and he started opening the seals and he says i am he they couldn't take it and they walked away now i'm not majoring on them but i want to show you something these people knew who jesus was they saw the miracles the testimonies were said and then when he's when they go to arrest him to crucify him he says i am he so for me that's a cry out to say hey i am jesus of nazareth but you actually have a chance but they had their minds made up they didn't listen to those words and then he says to them he says so let it can be fulfilled to say let these go their way and their prophecy on it was saying that might be fulfilled which he spake of that theme that gave us me to them that thou gavest me i lost none now here it comes to us and then i'll close with this jesus christ very last commandment very last thing that he asked us i thirst after everything is gone for us everything is done for us but you know what he said before it's finished and he said it already in chapter 18. he says i've lost none so this is this is not now anymore about us this is about him and that's why the resurrection weekend was there it wasn't about us it's all about him we just sang it it's all about you jesus and he said he said no matter what state you currently now gonna be or where you think you are ending up he said i have lost none amen devil can't take them from me father has given them prayer has covered them i will raise up stones i will get somebody to pray for david i will get somebody to pray for our month i will get people to have prayer meetings and and utterance and prophecy and i will make mountains moves but you will come amen because it's not you it's the father that's within you and you know what you might feel man it's hard and i don't understand all the mysteries and and this world is so shiny and it's so easy to get distracted it's fine do you not think that the almighty god cannot get you out of your state amen and i want to declare to you if you're running if you are running and your parents are praying watch out amen watch out i was running i was running my parents were praying some people might not have 32 years in their life to run but tell me can god not save you can god not get you where you are don't lose hope don't try to figure this out don't try to fit into a mold don't try to don't try to deny who you who you are just be for real life christian just be for real say god i don't understand it fine there's nothing wrong with it god i don't feel it there's nothing wrong with it brother andy is just saying he's had a revival and he's been jumping on up man you've been jumping i love that hey it was good to see you jumping brother andy and i just don't feel i want to jump like him at the moment just hold on just hold on god said i will lose none amen so parents if god if the devil says to you your children is lost that's not what god said god declared it already before he was crucified before he went for the crucifixion before he got the stripes on his back for our healing before he was beaten and his beard ripped out before people spat on him and gave him false worship before that he said i've lost none so that's before he took the cross how much not more now after the cross when the blood has been shed and there's a way back to jesus christ how much not more now it must mean something man so if church is boring hold on god has got more for you in store but i want to bring you to what i opened up this morning or this evening if you put in as much effort into this gospel into our lord jesus christ as we put into youtube and twitter and facebook and snapchats and what's the other things that they do young people instagrams micrograms or whatever it wants to be doesn't care man i've got all day i used to know these things but if you could if you could take that time so it's a tip you said it's so beautiful and you can just say okay lord you know what i don't know all the things but what i'm gonna do is i'm gonna go back to you and say you know what i will give you at least my worship in the morning and i'll give you my i will not do device time before i play my head down i will put that stinking phone down or i will pick up my bible or i'll put on a tape or i'll sing a song to you but i will consciously will do an effort lord to get closer to you watch what happens in your life because you know what when i struggle the most when i struggle the most is when i feed the most of those things and everybody testified to that is there anybody in this building that cannot testify to that when is it going hard in your life when is it going hard in my life when i do this because it's shiny and you know what the world is designed to be shiny it is the best satan could do gives you the best soccer player or the best ragbio chester colby man that guy's name was mentioned more and more outside the stage than jesus christ it was come on reuben sidesteps and he does this and he's so cool and so and i'm like i don't even know which history is and then he i guess i go and google chase there and he does a stepping he's got a point but but what is that promoting how did it help me one day to defeat the enemy one day he never said i love jesus christ i don't know that when he was playing wreck he gave his gift to who to the world now musicians i'm going to close now but while the lord dropped in my head you have gifts the world is writing songs about our god those people out there are writing songs about god and they use their gifts and they make money off it yeah man and they push those gifts and it's hill's song and all these songs and everybody's song and every band can play seeing jesus christ do you know how much talent is sitting tonight in this church a gift that god places in your in your body before the time before world even began he placed a gift in you you're a musician i don't even know a key man i can't even find my car keys sometimes i'm like brother andy i don't man we can lose keys quickly hey i don't have it but you know what i've got a guitar and i can maybe only play the key of dn only really badly but i'm trying but there's musicians and gifts in our church that god has placed here to further the kingdom of god and you choose to sit on your chair shame on you when jesus christ just wanted a little bit of water after everything he suffered for us and we choose to sit on our chair and when the time comes up to testify or to sing a special you hide it under a bushel now hear me out i've been there you think i like standing here i'm as nervous as i could be every time i get up here because i know that god will hold me accountable for every word that comes out of my mouth i am sometimes sitting there thinking what am i doing but you know what i'm going to do it anyways because i love him so why don't you take your gift and you give it back to the lord and you see what happens you think every time i had a real battle brother isaac at a stage man you were writing songs like there's no tomorrow and every song peace be stole i needed to be have peace be still i'm sailing you know and then i even sang it just like brother isaac at the stage because i'll be sitting like oh no i'm saying lean over because every time i sing it it strengthens me because that time in my life i had turmoil but but god gave oh sorry brother isaac i love you but you just got that beautiful voice i wish i i would love to see one day like him i said i'm saying no i don't sound like you but you know but i could feel myself sailing away and all these problems and all the tension jubilee when did we dance at jubilee come on let's testify our church cam jubilee came out who was not dancing man i had my kids jubilee every day jubilee jubilee and everybody jubilee and we jubilee and everybody and why because a surrendered gift said i will write songs for god amen and that man was on a mission because he couldn't stop writing songs we we we struggled learning them faster he couldn't even remember office songs but it's not just brother isaac and i'm not saying everybody go write a song now look i'm way off my notes there's a reason for it but you're not just a musician you know sister jenny the labor you put into this church to make it look clean the time and effort you take on your side god bless you for it who else is doing it everybody has a place don't think on majors think on everybody and this body has a place and that's why i said one thing that reminds me of easter and when i look at the lord he says i lost none so kids you've got a big thing coming your way because you are coming no matter what the devil says and the ones that's not here they're just on their way they're just a bit sidetracked but they're on their way amen amen amen if you don't believe it i believe it for you amen 32 years old as lost as could be god reach the mercy through brother andy and brother ed and brother ben in my life if it wasn't for those three men i'm telling you i wouldn't be here i know predestination i know god but i would have gone around the mountain a couple of times more so now i'm going to close if you have a gift if you have a gift if god could give his life for you suffer do a lot of things for us i wouldn't even want to be there i wouldn't be able to see one of you go through that how much not more the the lord of glory don't you think you can give a little bit of your gift back your time i'm talking to myself this is me preaching to me i never preached you guys because i love you you guys are just awesome i get to i get to preach to my voice every day that's awesome i'm not preaching to you a little bit of your time back if you take 24 hours in your day and you divvy up how much time you give to the world and how much time you give to this gospel and how much time it takes to go and pray on your knees before you get to sleep and what do you pray about then i'll tell you how you're walking with the lord brother and he said it the same you get distracted he's looking at wood turning man it would be boring i'm sorry how does returning i don't understand it but then again it's not my interest okay but don't worry i've got plenty of other things i'm watching okay so it's hit home here you know i was i was also a youtube fan you know sometimes i look at sermons and then other times and the devil is so subtle like it is something popular we go one minute yeah that's not so bad two minutes three minutes i'm gonna go to sleep i've done it okay so if there was anything i got out of tonight if there's anything i got out of tonight let us have a revival let us change the way we see each other change the things we look at and start giving god back what god deserves amen who's with me if we kind of do it if we're going to jump in let's jump in completely or let's leave it but don't go halfway because guess what you're only going to disappoint yourself because the ones that's going to enjoy it is going to keep on enjoying it and the ones that doesn't like it will not like it and then once that god says i'm yeah and they want to backslide they'll backslide and the ones that walks away will walk away and the ones that praise him will praise him and the brother andy's that want to jump or jump and the alphas that's very loud and scream and shout will shout because we will still go on but the thing is and and bro and i want to say it brother ron spins is seated you get guys that train for gold medal yeah yeah all of us want to olympic gold medal in it but who gets it who gets the olympic gold medal the one that trains that eats that's disciplined that wanted more like the guy next to him they're standing at the 100 meters and all he's thinking is i'm gonna eat this guy for breakfast i'm gonna win i will cross that line first i will not lose that's the one that wants it who gets the tries in the matches huh the one where he's got a big prop in front of him and he goes no or just runs around him with scores to try he wants it more than the other guy that's the rule that's how it works in the world if you want to have first place you have to get that's it there's no losers i i ran against brother ben and all the brothers and i thought man that guy had the right attitude because all he said when he showed up he's got i'm going to beat brother armand and guess what he beat me come on babe is that true he beat me because the challenge was said that i'm sure i'm faster than him and he goes nah i'm gonna win and what happened i wasn't ready that man was born for it and he ran like i meant it like a mongoose i don't know it's just he just went i thought man that guy's fast you know and you it's bad as when you're in a race and you look at the guy in front of you and you're going he's going faster and far oh no don't be that guy don't be that guy sucks to lose losing is for losers we're winners we're different we're a different cut we've got a different attitude now here's the kick everybody wants to get to heaven who's going to make it to heaven there's only two monkeys in the ark who's going to be the who's going to be the two monkeys because three can't go in so the violin takes it by four so if you want it bad enough you will show up you'll be prayed up you'll be ready for church when the pastor steps forward you'll go lord may that man speak to me when the song leader comes up and say hey we're going to sing a song called jupiter i'm going to jubilee i don't feel that way but i'm going to jubilee if it says let's worship god you get on your knees or you stand up you sing or you even on top of your chair singing but you're going to worship god because you reap what you sow amen i do get very excited so do forgive me and i get very loud sometimes sorry brother alpha but if you're gonna give it all if you're gonna give it all give it all amen let us stand musicians if you want to come up if you haven't given your all i encourage you i'm not going to call people forward for prayer i don't think this is this type of service this is encouraging service if you haven't given you all do you not think this is where you put a stake in the ground tonight right here don't promise me don't promise me but do you want first place do you want to be that one that give god's perfect worship like he wants it you don't have to do it our perfect worship way you can start playing any song this is the little boy i just want to want to have a bit of just a real time now if you're going to go for it if i'm going to go into a fight i can promise you if you ever fight me you're going to lose so i don't play fair i win the devil comes up to me and he says in my mind oh you know what i'm going to get you i had at the accident the other day and i did my back brother ben off brother ed with the sheep tweaked my back brother andy remember when i had my back so bad hey brother ben testify i hurt my back really really really bad the moment i tweaked it you know what i said to satan not today amen not today and brother ed stood up from the chair the moment i stood up that evening asking what happened i went oh and he says oh you're right i said yep not today i'm just reminding satan where he belongs so if you're gonna do it if we're gonna do it this year we don't need a camp revival every time we don't need a prayer meetings upon prayer meetings we don't need um camps and and get togethers with all the other churches all the time we don't you can if you put it all in here if you put it all in every day and you get off your devices put it down when you get home and it's a stupid device it's not going to get you anywhere you go to heaven this don't go with you okay that stays right there youtube won't go to you your favorite pastor on youtube won't even go to you if he's not he's not surrendered i'm telling you now be careful who you follow amen so i think us as a church to start using our discernment just use this and say lord you know what i'll give you praise first and then i'll worship you and then i'll pray and then i'll pray for for um brother ben god bless you sorry brother we almost forgot your name and then i'll say lord because i love brother ben and i know he's young and he's got a lot of battles i'm going to pray for you brother ben i'll pray for you any day i love you okay and you know and then i'll pray for brother andy because he wants to he always needs prayer he says just pray for me always help me you know and when i come to my house i'm going to have a sermon ready for him so next time invite him he's going to get preached at because he wants it amen and let us pull now let us pull now man you will be surprised what happens in this church if we put god first i think we held off long enough i think we held off long enough come on church man liam stein i love you my boy you
