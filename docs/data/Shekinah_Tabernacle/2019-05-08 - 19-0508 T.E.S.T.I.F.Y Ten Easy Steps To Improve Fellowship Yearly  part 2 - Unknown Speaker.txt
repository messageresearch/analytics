========================================

don't make his life miserable without it sir that you that's like his service to you is grief hey like it's burdensome because he says that they may do it with joy and not with grief for that is unprofitable for you now I want to tell you the most basic of things that you can do for your pastor this is the most basic of things you want to know what the most this is now this is coming from a pastoral experience right the most basic of things is when he gets up here on Sunday morning and he sees and post sitting me you know makes him feel good he's like yes brother umph oh you know you think about Hermes put all this effort in he's put all this effort this is this is a labor of love for the Lord he's put all this effort and he together people and to speak of the things of God in to build people up into and he prepares his message you need tools on things throughout the week and he's thinking what could I what can I speak to the Brethren this week where's the Spirit of God leading me and I just want them to be closer to you and and I desire that how can i how can I help them how can I courage him I want to see them built up that's as hard as hard as pure pure towards you and when he sees you're sitting in the and then the church on Sunday morning it makes them feel real good is the Lord brother Perry greens that if you love God you've tuned up to church on Sunday morning and if you love your church you'll turn up to church on Sunday night you're ready for it and if you love your pastor you'll tune up to church on Wednesday night you know because the pastor's that all of them so as God so as the church always there but you know it makes them feel good because it he needs support you know now one of the important important things about a pasta is respecting him and one of the important things is know that's very very important I'm gonna throw a little thing out there respect them enough that even if he's wrong sometimes give him grace make sure the level of respect goes higher than oh well if you get something wrong then you know that like to me that respect was sort of down here somewhere but you know pastors don't get everything right that do we know that's the truth right we have to do I get everything right no do you know will it pass there no there are some situations he has to deal with and make decisions and we are here is to pick the best of four bad options each one's going to make him look bad you know when when when human beings get in pickles and situations and and in permissive wool situations things get messy you know and the poor past is sitting here you know he's he sometimes he's caught up on this and he's he's got four bad options to take what options does he take either one he's gonna look bad but but always respect them you know and if you respect her men and encourage them thanks for that message I enjoyed that I you know I've really enjoyed that thank you for this and encourage them in and your mind respect him there's a supernatural element to that that makes them feel at liberty and makes them feel like he can lead you know because if you if there's a if the respect is gone it's it breaks something up and it just makes them loop makes them lose the confidence to lead oh they don't really like me anymore maybe of maybe I'm a bit washed up you know it and it's Satan's that's playing on it and they and it can hinder their their ministry to us so always be respectful to the pastor hold him in high esteem he's got a very serious job to do but lean adult with joy be nice to me happy you know why not think about what it is to be in his shoes you know help him out like John do whatever you can God will bless us if we respect our pastor guarantee it I can guarantee it I've been in the position went yeah the way and it was terrible but if we just bless our pastor and always be respectful God can move and God even see it if you if you do it the other way you know then I'll take the candlestick away he concealed take it away if we pastors are actually quite delicate a real pastors quite a delicate person too he's not a generally not a you know he doesn't have a lot of thick skin ease very open very I know he learns to be a bit but looks good after a while but you know so that's our that's our first one is to really respect our posture and the the the leadership and if you ever have negative thoughts about your posture quickly deal with them because because that's the first step and things all breaking down all around us is that but I can guarantee if we do it the other way if we really respect our posture and as unto the Lord and think Lord I want to receive from you through this you know the Lord we respect the Lord but you know respecting the past there is actually as unto the Lord God will move okay now here's another very very important my number two step number two equally important respect each other equally important brother Ben has preached about it quite a lot but we get to know people in the flesh and the more you get to know so on in the flesh the more you realize how much of an actual kind of failure they kind of are you might have thought that once pretty quite an awesome guy you know that's the truth as you get to know them you're like man that guy's got a lot more flaws than I thought hey and when I start thinking that about my friends I think oh no they're thinking the same about me hey and the unfortunate thing about me as I can't see my own flaws and I think I'm the best thing out what we all do right hey let's be honest you know hey that's the way that's the way that it is you know we you know because we we're not we're not really gonna think we're really no good otherwise and we're gonna have confidence and the things that the way we think of the things that we do otherwise if we didn't have confidence and then we wouldn't do then we didn't think they were the greatest choices that we wouldn't make than me I've made a good choice here that's the truth right but but we get to a place with the believers with the Brethren they become someone mystical that you don't quite know to someone that you know to someone that eyes doing that again hey now avoid that thought right our job as believers as to as to the she ate the two right because the flesh man and the spirit man are two different things and some of us are some of us swing between these two a lot more than others you know some of us kind of have a hard time here then we come up here and we you know now our aim than serving the Lord is that we might come and be that our flesh may be more and more a subjection than our our way that we are would come more and along with her spirit man and yet we've got the fish man that Conner you know we're all on this journey trying to make these two combined you know to be so you generally see the spirit man more than all the time that's the purpose of the teaching and molding of the Lord right but this is flesh this natural man that is kind of annoying sometimes Hey he's kind of predictable sometimes he's he's frustrating sometimes you know that's the truth right don't act on that don't act on that whatsoever you know just rush it aside now if they do these things brush it aside but don't react and the flesh to anyone it's what they said about the Corinthians they you're not comma ylim Walker's mean you know they were you had these two men sort of walking on the flesh and they were just having all this bickering in the flesh and he's doing this doing that you know it's if we want God to move amongst us then we've got to look past that and no matter how long you've known some someone that so-and-so as a son or daughter of God and they have the ability to be led by the Spirit of God and and we've got to have a confidence in their walk that's very important you know when you feel like someone's lost confidence in your Christian Christian walk it's very hard to get out of that sometimes Jana said it's hard because they when people have confidence and you you feel like yes I can I can trust it all I can be a Christian I can do this you know but as you as if someone loses confidence in your Christian walk it knocks you back now that can knock you back from serving the Lord it can it can hinder us and we don't want that in a fellowship we want to always respect the fact that actually sister Chantel can raise their hands and praise the Lord you know on one day she's probably going to break out into tongues and interpretation and that you know why not why not you see if we if we think oh this you guys again because we're not here for so many years then we won't get anything better please say Lord one day it's just going to move on from that you know then it's then then things will continue to happen as we look at the spirit man a woman rather than the natural man and always keep that in our minds and then and we'll be a fruitful body of Christ amen number three this is very very important when you're my feet these new batteries okay now if I've learned anything in my walk it's this one deal gently with each other gently I just found the scripture the other day this was not the one I was going to use but I actually enjoyed it so much that I put it here because it really speaks about this verse he that covereth a transgression seeketh love but he that repeated the matter separated fury friends I like that first but he that covereth the transgression seeketh love that's when you know something has happened you you you but you just you know something Bad's happy you know something that someone's done but you just sort of brush it aside and your deal gently now what I mean by dealing gently is let people make mistakes let them make mistakes to each other and to you let them make mistakes and don't just run in and mmm you know they were real gently there's a saying that says all's will walk with hobnail shoes where angels fear to tread now there may be a situation where God may be allowing something in someone's life and and he may be allowing them to do some sort of catastrophic failure somewhere because you've got a plan he's got an idea he's got something in mind for that person but he knows I've tried these other ways my son my daughter but unfortunately this is now the method I'm gonna have to use to just tweak this little piece that's a new he might bring them through maybe a bad situation but we have to believe that every situation that every brother and sister was going through is by the divine hand of God now if we respect them will understand that therefore if they're going through this situation or something like that and gods dealing you imagine if we come in and do our little deal in there you know and it's contrary to the to God's idea now we think well I've got the idea in the situation I kind of know this I'd need to go and tell them that because I know them well I've learnt that I actually don't know I don't know I'm not God why my knowledge on life is very very very limited the sphere of influence I have is a person that very limited ender the the my knowledge is I kind of know my wife okay my children year all right when it gets to anything outside of that I think this is getting way too complicated for me but our far too complicated who knows more than that like know like he even run at work you know every everyone you meet you kind of you're saying - no see God knows all of that and every every intricate situation involves and then every everything about every individual person and what they've been through where he's leading him everything he's got tools that he's using to mold and make the believers and I am very very cautious to get in a mess with that with God's work you know because I really don't know what's happening I don't know so we have to deal it's a very important thing I've learned that just to deal gently with the Brethren they'll deal very gently don't don't deal harshly we you know if he is a close friend and you can hey it was stupid yeah no bro you know if you know we can take it tell them but if you don't know the brother very well even if he's a brother if you haven't you haven't got a real strong human bond with them I just leave it alone many times I think look I don't know that person will know if I'm not going to say a single thing I don't know them they're a brother sister but I don't know them well enough I wouldn't dare go and say anything you know just be just deal gently very very important being God can work you know if we start yelling roughly and listen it will just cause will cause a mess and next one number four this is a very important moment be humble and be teachable be humble and be teachable we aren't very good in the body of Christ when we think we know everything and we think we're pretty good and we're kind of you know the more we realize that we don't know then the more we can be taught and the more we can actually be of a benefit to the kingdom of God the scripture says likewise ye younger submit yourselves unto the elder yay all of you be subject one to another and be clothed with humility for God resisteth the proud but giveth grace to the humble and to be of any asset in the body of Christ if we think we know a lot and we think we're pretty good we think we're quite a good asset then God's got a bit of dealing in our lives to Humble us down to where we have to realize we actually don't know that much I'm not I'm not as great a guy as what I thought I was and I just need all the help that I can get that true hey be humble and be teachable you know we when we think we know it all is when we make all the mistakes when I was younger I knew your whole lot more than what I do now you know and you're a whole lot more don't know where it's all gone you know you supposed to get smarter over the years you know I've kind of know less and this and this you know when they're when all the Pharisees are going to throw the stones at the the woman that was caught in adultery you notice who left first when Jesus wrote on the gun who left first all the older guys they're like actually no no no no yep I don't know anything about this I'm out of here the last ones to leave young guys kind of know mm-hmm in a little while longer to realize no you don't know either you know that doesn't mean when you're old you're humble abut you know as you go along in life if the Lord deals with you you do get humbler and you realize I don't know much I don't know much at all and I'm just reliant on the grace and mercy of God I'm relying on him if a young brother wants to tell me I'm alone tell me you know hmm you know what when you're like that till you can take it you can take a look you can take a lot of rebuking you take a lot of things you know it doesn't matter you rebuke a wise man have you made wiser you know you think I'm stupid at that really man thanks for telling me I didn't cause I was is that's the truth right you didn't man yeah I actually am well thanks now but wiser don't do that anymore you know but if you rebuke a fool you'll hate you for it and a fall is quite a prideful person tell him something he's all upset I shouldn't be telling me I'm awesome at plants courtesy and he's no good you know and you got to sort of tread delicately and you know it's all this everything you do is all friction and you know it's just with yelling with pride here the more humbler we become the more we just you know we can be told and pushed around and listened it doesn't bother us no yeah you know and then we become an amiable nice member in the body we can just be you know we're not gonna get worked up over things hey most of the things you say about me badly right you know probably a lot more you don't know about you know by the grace of God hey I'm glad he's got me okay now here's another important one you charge them slightly we get into a spiritual side and a fellowship right which is rule over your own flesh very important in a fellowship let's want to read this one from first Peter 4 verse 1 to 2 it says for as much seen as Christ has suffered for us in the flesh arm yourselves likewise with the same mind well he did has suffered in the flesh has ceased from sin that he should no longer look for the rest of his time in the flesh to the lusts of men but to the will of God now I like an each person in a fellowship and the body of Christ to a part of the wall we're all a part of the wall right and we have a responsibility to defend our part of the wall and that that that wall is our flesh because the devil own can only work through our flesh really he can't the devil can't work through the Holy Ghost he doesn't have you know he can only work through through our flesh through our own and human spirit and our own thoughts that are not in line with the Word of God that's we can work he can't work in the thought the Word of God cuz that's the Word of God that's why brother MCS it can't be you can't impersonate this like you can't impersonate that the true Holy Ghost it is the Holy Ghost it's the real thing itself right but but it's L it's our responsibility and a fellowship as to guard our piece of the wall to ensure that we don't get let down our guard and then the enemy comes in through us and starts messing around and fellowship because we can do that I can I can make my guard down and just beats that walking in the flesh and then I might start doing things that wouldn't otherwise doing start influencing my friends and the fellowship to to do things that they wouldn't otherwise do because I'm their friend and I this is still one sproates all right you understand or I could start to get negative on things in start to get all carnal and start to say hurtful and nasty things to people that I wouldn't otherwise say or say things about people that I wouldn't otherwise say and it starts this negative venom ticking through the fellowship and it's not I need it that's not really me but I haven't ruled over my flesh and I've let this thing come in and now I'm kind of you know I'm affecting the fellowship you know there's a sign I think on brother I'll raise you a quote from brother Brennan that says I'm you know our attitude someone help me just been there our attitude your attitude towards someone else could determine the eternal outcome I believe is the is the quote now I think this all ties together because if we if we are acting in the spirit and situations then I believe we'll do the right thing and and if we just keep if we keep the the enemy out of our own life and we just think the Spirit of God work through us through the fellowship then it will all be alright attitude towards people will be right so so we all have to roll over at our own part of the wall no one can do it for you nobody can do it for you and I'm relying on you you're relying on me if brother imposes on the other side of the wall fighting over there I'm relying that he's going to be holding his part of the wall because I can't I gotta look after my part you know okay after his part and if he doesn't we all suffer not like your brother I'm gonna put on me if I don't we all suffer he's humble enough you'll take it he's such a smiley guy like him when you smile you've got energy you know we walked at the top of that hill where the wind was blowing the most amazing one you've ever felt in your life at the top of the rumor take a hill and you can't even stand at the top and then pose up there laughing laughter makes you young and vibrant we're all over your own flesh next one this goes with it but now this is now the positive side of it we filled with the spirit be filled with the Spirit of God if you want to be a channel of blessing to the fellowship and just everywhere you go you're just pouring out life be filled with the Spirit of God make an effort to be filled with the spirit and make your life tender and soft and just the Holy Ghost just living out through you the more we do that the more you'll get there the rest of the fellowship on fire just by being just did just making an effort to be filled with the Spirit of God as there's so much of the Spirit of God to be had it's often us that restrict it be filled with the Spirit of God if we live in the spirit let us also walk in the spirit be filled with the Spirit of God we're all over your flesh to me filled with the spirit your pastor will love you he'll love you can we you'll be as favorite he wants to be the pastor's favorite come on well what's the scripture there's a scripture about you know we provoke one another to good works right we so this is like a competition who's going to be the pastor's pit but actually the Lord will be happy you know the Lord is well pleased when we when we were when we were amiable a good part of the body you know the Lord's actually the Lord is pleased with that he has the he has emotions he and there's a it can be he always loves us but he has emotions I'm happy with that I'm not happy with the head you know and he can be pleased with how we operate and you know when we get full with the Spirit of God the more we get filled with the Spirit of God the less I think we'd do things wrong and the more we act in the in the Spirit of God and in the right spirit then I think that the more white will be in situations when we act in the in the through the spirit of God now we all know when that is right this be honest with ourselves we all know when reacting in the flesh they when we like worked up over saying we know I know I've just learned these days that when I get like that I think man I I just and I fail all the time but I think man I've got a hmm I can't when I get like that shut my mouth don't do anything don't say anything don't don't make any choices don't do anything just get yourself right first and then you'll start making the right decisions again and saying the right things this and that past that we just thought get away on me but I fail all the time but by God's grace he points out where I fouled and next time I say right bring it on again on it don't have another garlis you know I don't be full with the spirit and often I can trace it back to the list of the Spirit I had then the more I was prone to do that now that's not saying the Holy Ghost comes and goes in your life but there's a that more we give time to the Lord the more of the measure of Christ's and more of the influence of the Holy Ghost can be in our life and the more effective and soft we can be here's another one let the Word of God dwell in you richly there's this may seem like they're all part of the other ones but it's actually it's these are there's this word of God that directs our life and gives us answers and situations thy word have a head and one heart that I might not sin against thee David's adore thy word is a lamp unto my feet and a light unto my path therefore the more of this word that we know and we endeavor to have it dwelling in our hearts in each situation we can it's it's fresh and alive in our mind and we can actually think in the situation the Word of God comes up and yes this is the right thing that I should do here because the Word of God is dwelling in us richly it's it's vibrant it's in our mind now if we don't give that attention when a situation comes up we have a there's a plenty of other thoughts that could take its place and that we could act on but if we let the Word of God dwell on us richly as Colossians 3:16 says let the Word of God of Christ dwell in you richly in all wisdom teaching and admonishing one another in Psalms and hymns and spiritual songs singing with grace in your hearts to the Lord daily will I meditate upon thee and meditations of her heart and often with me you know I'm if I be about slackens area I think man it's been I'm sort of been chewing on this one for a while now you know it's thumb bike I need to get some more to chew on you know that's just me right I need to get I think that I've been I've been chewing this not that the word gets old but you know this is this new manner to behead in our life you know and we should boys but if the word of God dwelling in us richly this will make us act different amongst their body of believers and make us act different it'll make us make the right choices here we go this one here now now we're all still done we're doing the we're doing the Christian thing where you know this one's very very important in the body of Christ love your life for Christ not for yourself live your life for Christ I want to read mark 12:29 2td says and jesus answered him the first of all the commandment says hear o Israel the Lord our God is one Lord and thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart with all thy soul with all thy mind and with all thy strength this is the first commandment you tell me what other functionality the human being has a slope from the most four things pretty much everything that we our mortal existence has wrapped up into our heart our soul our mind and our strength when you boil each thing down I can't see any other area where we can where we don't need to love the Lord from it pretty much encompasses the human being but I want to labor on this one for a little bit because it's so important it's so important that we don't focus we don't get caught up in the cares of this life and the deceitfulness of riches that can choke the word we were just talking about that word wants to come out and do things grow multiply and once they're multiplied it's all there you know we're right there we're ready to multiply but the Bible says the cares of this life and the deceitfulness of riches come in and they choke the word inhibit that becomes unfruitful and it's so easy who knows what a care of this life is basically everything we do on a daily basis to survive we're not talking bad things are we we're talking I got to go to work I got to do this I got it there and they've got to do Korea go do all these things you know just a care of this life it's all of us and the deceitfulness of riches and and you know just as this is just my thought but I decided in my life and my service to the Lord I'm gonna take a risk you know I'm gonna risk it all I'm gonna risk it all it might sound strange but I'm gonna risk it all for the Lord I'm just gonna I'm gonna give him more and have no other options if it all doesn't work I've got no plan B well this is it you know we need it we need to check our lives that were actually that we are not getting caught up in our own interests and our own interests and our own desires and I'm not talking these are bad things these are what we perceive as good things but you know I wonder sometimes whether whether we actually you know we get to this point and then we we get a bit older and then we realize we've got to sort of look after our future and sort things out and we start going off and then you know our focus can go they may have children so they now all our focus starts to shift off the things of God and off his work on to all these kids of life that seems so good but it's so easy to get sidetracked on those who's heard the prophecy that brother nibel gave it's actually not on this on some of the sermons but the pec that I've got it's on it's that of a sermon and I want to tell you this I've always thought in my mind Lord my life is going to be serving you and doing your work whatever it might be if I have get married if I have children if I do all these things they're not going to be my I'm not going to have children they're settled in and right let's just focus on my family and get things all you know I said unfortunate old shed in the early early days my life's not going to be like it's not gonna just my attention is not going to get diverted even though I've got a responsibility it's not all my responsibility I just want to say this how I feel about it I know that requires that much but it doesn't require that much and it will take that much if I give it to it my career will take that much if I give it to it everything all these kids it's life there's no limit to what they will take the only limit they've got is what I give it I say I'll give you this much and no more that's all you get you you get a much no more and if you don't give it amounts to say that's all you can get and if you feel it's taken too much and that's and it needs that much say Lord I don't want to give this thing that much change it so I can give it this so I can actually give you enough so that the work can be fruitful in my life there's the quote that the old save us thee because based on that always thought that way but I thought I'm like correcting this or am I kind of like you know going wee bit crazy and then I hear a not a quote it was a tongues and interpretations and it was brother Neville speaking when will the Lord speaking through brother neva when he interpreted and there must have been a young minister and the meetings and he said young Minister there was a time when you were in the temple serving God and you were doing these things and now you've you've got yourself a family now you're sitting down settling down into family life and you're just you're not really caring for the things of God anymore and it was rebuked to this young Minister that his life had slowly become focused just on his family and on all these other maybe his career because he's got to buy the children bikes and christmas is coming up and now need to build them a little house out the back and you know I've got to take them out on a Saturday and do this and do that and you know let's nail it and it kind of you know before you know it it was taking up all of his time and the Word of God couldn't take root and flourish anymore now that's not being crazy because we only get to live once we only get one shot at the Saints you get one shot you lay down on your grave when you're old and you lie down and you think what did i do what did I give you get one shot one shot something could take years from your life and was it worth all those years years of focused years of energy I focus for years on a certain thing and I look back with regret because it was just a natural business and natural thing I look back with regret and I think why that cost me years of energy of enthusiasm of this time and gave me nothing on a lady on on my deathbed and think lord I gave everything that I could I live my life different I lived it different I didn't care about those things I didn't care about my career I don't care about all these Lord I was I took risks I risk it all for you lord I risked it all now that's what they did in the book of Acts we never convicted they risked at all the raptures coming the coming of the Lord is knowing we're so busy burning up our future here think about it now we can be wise as we get older but there's a point where we've got to put off even our carnal wisdom and think I just don't want to get stuck in that rut but I want to get stuck in that rut I only get one life I get one chance to to give all my talents for the Lord I get one chance this is it look around you real live this is it we get one chance no more chances after this we get one and their life is like a vapor like a flower comes up and goes down what is it worth some of these other things that we do sometimes I think to myself what's it all worth I want to go down to the grave saying Lord I gave it all for you and I felt me to do this thing and I pursued it I felt there was your calling for me and I pursued it I had a talent and I and I fought hard and rushed off these other things and restricted them so that this talent could come forth and serve you I could I could invest it back into you I invested him that when I saw it was a gift I had in my life I worked on that that's the truth we get one chance I've got two more next one give give and it shall be given unto you good measure pressed down and shaken together running over shall men give into your bosom for the same measure you meet well what's the same measure that you meet with all that shall be measured to you again yo yo don't be stingy in anything yeah give love give things give stuff give encouragement give help give time give be a giver be a channel of blessing be a giver when you're in a fellowship be a giver how can I help you know when I talk about these things the more you live your life like this at least you got time to complain about things right give how can I give in the situation don't be a taker takers thinking oh this is no good what can i you know because they're theater if you're at a place to take you're gonna be you're gonna think well that wasn't really what I wanted today I'm not happy if your mentality is to take what can I give to me I'm waiting it wasn't quite what I wanted but if we think what can I give when we clean up to a fellowship what can I give anytime you see a need you're gonna want to go oh I can maybe help there maybe I can do this when you've got the different mentality when we think to be a giver not a taker and a fellowship but it changes the whole way we look at something like I think often times if I see I wouldn't call it a problem at a PHY see a situation that needs a solution I think look I'm not prepared to go and do anything about it then my mouth stays shut about it if I'm not going to be a solution then I'm not going to be part of the problem and just complain if I'm not going to be a solution you know if someone else is doing something and I if I think more I can do that better within either go and do it or don't say anything if you're not going to be a solution right but but just don't be afraid to give give give the Lord loves a cheerful Giver but it keeps us young keeps us vibrant it keeps us you agree with it give give me some as white people have a problem giving sometimes you know the Englishmen they they try and give give hey you got a breakthrough cultural things sometimes the more we give the more we receive the more we give that it's inexhaustible if we just the Lord said the measure that you meet what if you give out you'll get it all back you see someone is just that open conjure they just seem to be pouring out with all sorts of stuff you don't think where does it all come from but the more we're a conduit for anything that's the Lord just wants to just bless and know so if we go like this there's no flowing going on there there's nothing happening but you know the more we just give the more we received and the more we can give we can just be a blessing if we live our life like this you know we just the Lord can really start to work and he can give back to us and we can give out and it's just we're and we can just all be a blessing in whatever manner we've got to just you know could just be a torrent of fountains everywhere from every person yeah people tell Christina Christi give us too much you know stop put a lid on it but I've always said don't put a lid on it no no way man okay there this is my last important point the young people here we're going new doesn't mean much the old people will go yet stay fervent stay zealous and stay youthful stay fervent zealous and youthful I took the scripture from Caleb another one lady why Caleb said as yet I am a strong this day as I was and that day Moses sent me as my strength was then even so as my strength now for war both to go out and to come in useful and vibrant is what I ever was and strong is what I ever was now now we you know we talk about the often II you know we're gonna we're gonna you know we're waiting for a theophany let me ask you a question how old's your theophany 21 useful vibrant you know that's our theophany so we want to you know get closer and closer to a theophany at the often is young as we go through the toils of life and mindset can get old know this again this year another New Year's thing this year you know the first New Year's New Year's thing at a church this is awesome man it was so good you know the 10th one another one we've got to sit up God do this we've got a you know and about till 12 are gonna be tired in the morning you know when we've done at 10 times that's called getting mentally old don't do that don't do that stay mentally young you know push those sorts of slides that now man I'm as excited as a five-year-old to go to this thing man that's gonna be awesome hey I'm still 21 you know we gotta watch as you get older don't let those old thoughts creep in you know there's nothing more awesome to see old brethren serving the Lord like they're little kids like the Esau brethren you know that guy's like a little kid you know he's like he gets younger every time I see him and he's got so much bounce of torment like he's alive you know the guys are thinking his 80s you know there's people younger than him in rest homes slowly dying why because they mentally got old and they lead all they get it all this I can't do that know what don't do this they get sick of everything because they didn't they get negative and leave thoughts like that don't do that stay stay 21 yes al we all are we just like look a bit older but we're not we're all 21 stay vibrance there youthful stay zealous stay excited about the things of God stay excited brother Santos doing it awesome oh we tried that about five times hidden with kids mr. sixth time I work with him you know if he wants to gon go and do this average let him do it you know and got along with a be excited about it don't be don't oh you tried that last year you know don't do that how many now I don't want to pour water but how many old people have you seen that have poured water on all these ideas you know like now they're not they're not the old because in their mind they've gotten old they're getting tired you know but they don't have to that's a choice we can push those thoughts aside because because the the the more experienced ones have so much wisdom that they can actually they're such an asset to the believers you know so we've got a we've got a responsibility to stay so we can stay a part of everything you know we can keep up no problem at all man we can keep up can you keep up sister Robin [Laughter] yeah yeah we can stay forever Ellison youthful stay excited you know keep your mentality like that don't get don't get me into the old otherwise we'll become before your night will be pouring cold water on all these ideas you know a demon and then we're complaining you know but you know if we have full of the Spirit of God with the word of Christ is dwelling in us richly we're we're fervently wanting to serve the Lord and everything that we do and all of that okay we're not gonna have time to get old you know and get mentally oh we're just gonna be like man I've got time to think those thoughts other things to do man I've got I've got a kingdom to work for you know I'm here for a purpose I'm not here just sitting around doing nothing i man I'm here for a purpose and the Lord put me in this fellowship to serve and to workers work that's why I'm here I'm not just sitting around I only have time to complaint anytime to mumble and he'd be negative this is positive we're serving God here you know when we focused that way we're actually part of the solution not the problem and if everybody's like that the army just moves forward forward forward forward all the time that's the way it works now I know I see it there with ten steps right but there's actually 11 number 11 is don't limit God to 10 steps and I don't know if you can see that little tiny black dot there as a comma because hey it's as many as what the rule wants to do cuz I don't know everything but these are just the Lord the Lord's got he's infinite in his wisdom and infinite and the things that he can do so whenever you say the word testify what does it stand for hey see hey you'd never remember that if I didn't give you yet kind of a hey okay so let's go out and testify I mean it's um we stand up and we'll just um I'm going to pray and then I'm going to play the guitar and then I'm going to ask brother Jeremy to sort of lead
