experience thank you you know there's something are we going there's something um you know when you do something you know how something should be there's something satisfying when it's the way that it should be and there's something very dissatisfying when it's the way it shouldn't be let's go to um I've just got one verse to read this morning Psalm 94:1 then you can um it says oh Lord God to whom Vengeance belongeth oh God to whom Vengeance belongeth show thyself may the Lord bless his word you can take your seats um this morning how are you all this morning it's good to see you you're good to have a good sleep feeling Wide Awake ready to ready to uh listen put your um spiritual thinking capts on you know me are try keep it nice and simple my brain doesn't really like too many complicated things so I've got to like I read something and it's very complicated and I've got to sort of figure out I've got to uncomplicated for myself you know so I can understand it CU I yeah sort of it's got to make sense in my my mind you know and the the things of God are so big so so vast and yet we can you know he can make them so simple to us and and I appreciate that because yeah I do simple the thought that I um have been thinking about lately has been a thought called Vengeance Vengeance it's a very powerful word Vengeance maybe appeals to the guys more than girls guys you like Vengeance girls like Vengeance come on you're in the wrong team your father loves Vengeance your heavenly father father he's a god of Vengeance and we all have that attribute in us so I've just had this you know just a thought I want to I want to take you through it there's a there are quite a few different um facets to this thought I've tried to sort of bring it all together and talk about this thought of um Vengeance this concept of Vengeance you know it runs runs quite deep when we think about it and the general idea of it is that it's punishment infliction or retribution exacted or or done for an injury or a wrong it's kind of like you're you're you're settling the score you know you're getting back at somebody and and and by the time your vengeance is done the scores all settled you know there was a There Was An Unfinished account that was settled after Vengeance takes place now believe it or not the god that we serve this morning as a god of Vengeance very much so there there is not a day that goes by that he's not a fierce fierce God of Vengeance and and it's something very important to understand about about God that you know if we read in nahem chapter 1 ver2 it says God is jealous and the Lord Revenge the Lord revenge and is furious the Lord will take Vengeance on his enemies and he reserve wrath for his enemies this God doesn't play around he's a god of Vengeance and the moment he has to take Vengeance he takes Vengeance furiously there's no half measures there's no holding back it's just vengeance is is is dealt out relentlessly and to the fullest extent of what it needs to be to settle the score and he never plays games he never says Ah you know just take it easy today it's always 100% Furious Vengeance that's actually the god that we Ser you know we we picture the Lord here and sandals and robe and saying you know blessed are the peacemakers which is what he is as well but there's a part of God that's that's 100% Vengeance I want to take you through this just to show how it would happen we take Israel when they were in their land and you know the Lord brought them into the land of you know this land of Israel and then he gave them Commandments to live by and he said okay you do this you do that and it will go well you if you you if you sin you do these other things it would go bad for you like the law and he would govern that law with them himself like he would be the judge of that law over them himself and he wouldn't judge other nations because other nations he didn't place that requirement on them because they weren't his people but his own people he gave them the law and he said right you follow this like my children this is my these are my rules you do well you prosper you don't do well it goes bad okay but the children of Israel often went the other way you know they they turned away from God they broke these laws and then by default they started Living in a manner that wasn't pleasing to the Lord so they went this other way now he didn't take Vengeance on them but I want to show you how it would unfold but to to just to think about this thought this this is a bit of a side thought but when you look at this concept of hate you can understand just through this example that how this concept of hate works and and actually why Satan is a tool in the hands of God as well cuz we we often say it oh Satan's a tall in the hands of God but when you understand how it works you realize he has to be because he is a hater he hates that's what he does his whole life is just his whole being is hate and hate has to do what hate wants to do like if you have hate on you 100% you can't love you know you you would just hate that's just how you would because you can't be something you're not so Satan can't be anything he's not he's he's he's Darkness he's hate right so so now what would then happen was to to God how do I explain it like God is essentially protecting his people in this land right and he'll he's sort of putting a barrier up around the borders if they do well right here's a barrier you do well right now CH let's take this example the children of Israel had people all around them let's say for example one country was one country hated them and one country loved them that were on their borders and let's say God at one point took this protection away from the borders that the two different countries are going to react two different ways to this country called Israel right the country that hates them are going to hate them oh the borders are down we can get in we're going to go and Destroy them no they can't do any they can't do it any other way they are just go to go and hate we'll go rape we'll go pillage we'll go destroy go do whatever we can and for as long as we can cuz that's what's in them but the country that loves them which in their Cas is nobody around there that loves them but just for an example of this even when the borders are up they'll go there and be nice and hey how can we help you you know glad we could be here they will love right so God often times see the minute he lets Satan go somewhere Satan will by default begin to pillage and Destroy he just has to he can't he won't sit back and love ah I'll love these guys I'll build them up in the things of the Lord I'll encourage them to build the temple you know he will go and hate so so why I say that was because in this case in this case he used Babylon when they did wrong he said okay well then as a as a chastisement for you I'm going to take this away from you and now babylon's just going to come in because these people hated them so he knew as soon as I take this protection away that was there they would just come in so so this Babylon of its own desire would come in and start to go in and want to destroy them destroy the temple destroy everything you you're following me very easy and so Babylon at one point came in and they raped and pillaged the land and they took the children of Israel out of the land and over to Babylon it was a traumatic experience when they got over after the course of time now remember Babylonians couldn't do anything but hate they just hated Israel you know now when they were over there the children of Israel at some point in time began to call upon the Lord there's the there's a verse that says by the Rivers of Babylon where we sat down there we wept when we remembered Zion and and and our captives the Babylonians said oh why don't you sing us some of those happy songs of Zion give us some of that give us some of that foot tapping joyful you know Jewish music they said how can we sing in a Strange Land you know and David said if if if I forget Jerusalem let my tongue cling to the roof of my mouth you know that I can't even praise if I forget that's where I'm from that's that's where Joy sits is in that land they say we can't sing those songs and they be to call upon the Lord and say Lord bring us back to the land and they were they were so remorseful and they were they repented they said all we we see what we did wrong and so there was a genuine repentance okay so when this happened and they moved the heart of God then two things begin to happen two things begin to shift the first one is God begins to have mercy from his heart upon his children so so mercy and compassion starts to move because he senses their remorse and he wants to forgive and he's moving that way but then the next thing that's happening while the while the mercy and compassion is is happening One Way vengeance is beginning to build upon Babylon because what did Babylon do hey you guys just you guys are just destroyed my people so Vengeance begins to build you say well you let them do it God say I didn't let you do nothing all I did was open the took the protection away you chose to go in you chose to destroy them I didn't do it you did it so now my Fierce wrath is against you cuz they did nothing wrong to you were just there doing their thing and you just went in there and destroyed them yeah and now you deserve the fullest extent of my Vengeance even though he used them to punish Israel but yet they were still 100% responsible for their actions and they were and they had 100% Fierce vengeance upon them and they were their time was done and the more Israel called upon the Lord the more there was Vengeance brewing in the heart of God towards Babylon he said I'm going to finish you completely that's why he said flee out of the midst of Babylon and deliver Every Man's Soul be not cut off in her iniquity for this is the time of the Lord's Vengeance he will render under her recompense he says make bright the arrows gather the shields the Lord hath raised up the spirit of the kings of the mes for his device is against Babylon to destroy it because it is the Vengeance of the Lord and the Vengeance of his Temple these guys went and destroy my temple they got Vengeance I'm going to destroy them he says therefore thus sayith the Lord the Lord of behold I'll plead thy cause and take Vengeance for thee and I will dry up her sea and make her Springs dry I'm going to finish that woman and and and that's what God did he destroyed Babylon because he took vengeance upon them because he's a god of Vengeance he doesn't just oh well you know yeah you know what you had every right to go in there I suppose they were being bad no you had no right to touch them now men and women being like how we are we're like amateur God so we actually if we were honest with ourselves we like Vengeance and we like stories of Vengeance ah I got them back you know that's in a sense that's part of our makeup now I'm not saying it's correct I'm just saying that's we're like God and we do have an ATT we we do have an attribute in us that likes to take Vengeance right but get to it later on I've just got some stories of vengeance there's a group called The it's probably n n nakam and these These are these are men that went through the um concentration camps survivors and when they got out there was about 50 of them they formed this group and they were going to take revenge for the Holocaust that was their plan and and they were indiscriminate of who they killed or how they would go about this they just wanted to kill as many Nazis as many of these people as they could they didn't care what who else they killed in the process or what happened they would just after as many Nazis as they could to kill them right so the first plan they had was um this was the leader of the group ABA kova hatched a hatch plan a to poison the water supply of nurg w Hamburg and Frankfurt and Munich but he was caught and had to Chuck the poison before he could initiate the plan so he was prepared to to poison the whole water system of all these cities to try and destroy a few Nazis he wouldn't care if he just killed half of the Jima population because these guys had so much Vengeance in them they hated what happened to them and they just wanted Vengeance they they made a pack we're going to take Vengeance the next one Plan B that didn't work so plan B um the na targeted German prisoners of War held by the United States by poisoning bread with arsenic they targeted bakeries that Supply prisons and poison 3,000 loaves of bread targeting more than 12,000 Nazi prisoners more than 2,000 German peer WS were seconded but no deaths resulted from the attack disappointing so disappointing back to the drawing board you know but they had Vengeance they just wanted to take Vengeance here's another one operation wrath of God this is another Israeli a Jewish one this is actually quite a the bad one this is during the Olympics of 1972 the like a Palestinian group took the Israeli Olympic team hostage and they ended up killing um I think it was 11 of the Israeli um Olympic team and and it was It was kind of it was almost broadcast live on the news as it was happening and things like that but you can imagine the Israeli government was so furious at what had happened and they had such they wanted to meet Vengeance they wanted Vengeance to happen upon these people because they essentially shamed them in front of the world and killed their Olympic team and so they had the whole government had this Fierce sense of Vengeance that they launched this operation called operation wrath of God what they called it to to settle the score these people and it says Wrath of God's goal was fairly simple it assassinate the members of the Palestinian armed militant group Black September and others within the Palestinian liberal Liberation Organization the op was author was authorized by Israeli Prime Minister Goldie m in the Autumn of 1972 and is believed to have been carried out for two decades 20 years they're meeting out Vengeance um the mosed was was brutal in delivering its Vengeance against the perpetrators of the Munich Massacre when they closed it on a Target they sent a letter to the family of the deceased hours before carrying out an assassination the letters read a reminder we do not forget or forgive that's how Fierce their Vengeance was it was just going to go on and on till they doubt to every last person they could find that was part of this for 20 years pass on the mantle you're in the government next remember Vengeance okay one of them clst at a home here was called um if you may may not have heard this the burning of the bo which was in the B of islands in um 1805 I think it was so this was a um uh it was actually a Timber merchant ship that had come into up north and they were coming in to get big long Cody um Timber and Export it they bring it overseas on the ship was a young moldy boy and he was the son of a chief that was from there and they they may gone around the world and come back and um for whatever reason they don't know but this moldy boy didn't want to do much work I think being a son of a a chief he thought no there's below me or something and he didn't really cooperate so they ended up the people on the ship mistreated him really badly and whipped him and flogged him had him locked up and you know for a long big big part of this journey and so when he got back to his home he went to Shore and he told his father who was the chief of what they' done to him on the ship and so these men were um unsuspecting of what had happened with The Moldy boy Chief when he went in and told them so the captain and a few of the other men went into Shore to to go up a valley and have a look at some big Cody trees which were massive thousand year old trees to cut down and they I think they didn't get far past the shore cuz they got killed and eaten yeah probably a little bit skinny but you've been on a ship for a while you're quite skinny you know should have fatten them up for a while sorry so then so they killed and eight these these people and then later on they disguised themselves as that party and they came back to the ship with the intention of Revenge cu the chief wanted to take revenge on this on this captain and on every everyone in that ship there were men women children in there so they they went back to the ship the main with you know disguised as the the captain the people that left they went back there and then on the command they attacked the ship and all the other boats the Walkers that around went in and they they they ransacked the ship um all night just and killed a lot of people and there were survivors hanging off the side and everything the next day this Chief here turned up um TPI was his name and he tried to stop what was going on because he was friendly towards the Europeans they actually all were till they mess with the chief's son but they got rid of him and um continued to kill as many as they could funny enough this is just sometimes how I guess the rewards are met they towed the ship it sort of mored or I guess it beached up on the on the mud flats and they began to take all the gunpowder and different things out but one of the a piece of flint lit and it set the gunpowder a light and this whole ship blew up and the one person that died di in that particular explosion was the chief's uh the son the was the chief the man that had sort of orchestrated the whole idea of Vengeance he got blown up there and died um and incidentally there were only a few survivors one was a mother and a baby and another one was a baby and there was one one boy he was the cabin boy that survived and they didn't kill him because when the young um chief's son was in prison he would go and bring him food after him so he he looked after this boy and so his life was sped he never never died the cabin boy but word of this got around the world of this Vengeance that the these moldy people had taken upon the ship and that and and there were plans for for the gospel to come here and different things to happen but they all got put on hole because they thought we're not going to go there to that bunch of cannibal Killers you know so the the whole thing got put off by years and years maybe 10 years no one wanted to come here and it got a bad reputation but I don't know if you remember me talking about it but there was a guy Samuel and he always wanted to come here and share the gospel and he always thought of the event differently he thought no I want to hear their side of the story because I don't perceive these people just to be Killers like that they don't just go and kill for no reason so he wanted to go and find out why did they want to take this Vengeance it sounds like Vengeance to me so he he he was delayed because he couldn't get support to come over here because people said we're not we're not funding any trip to go over there um but eventually maybe 10 years later he arrived back here and then he made peace between the two tribes the and then I just wanted to say this because I just like the first when he came and preached he came he preached up from the Bay of islands but it was on Christmas Day 18:14 and he said behold I bring you Glad Tidings of great joy I just always like that that was the first I guess the first time there was a a a sermon preached in New Zealand it was and that was the opening line behold I bring you Glad Tidings of great joy now when we talk about the attributes of God we can say that God has shared a lot of his attributes with us right he's he said a lot of what I am I can I'll give to you to you be like me you know I'm this I'm that so so he says things like verily I say unto you he that believeth on me the works that I do shall he do also and Greater Works than these shall he do because I go to my father the things I do you're going to do I'm going to share them with you you'll become you'll be like me right so he says uh you'll you'll heal the sick you know you'll cleanse the lepers you'll raise the dead you'll cast out Devils freely you have received freely give you can have these attributes that I am you you can begin to do them it's a um you know in my name you'll cast out Devils you'll speak with new tongues you'll take up serpents and if you drink any deadly thing it won't hurt you you'll lay hands on the sick they shall recover he's he's passing all of his attributes on to us but the one thing he never shed with us was Vengeance he never said you can take you can have my Vengeance he never shared Vengeance never that's why he said oh Lord God to whom Vengeance belongeth oh God to whom Vengeance belongeth show thyself amen and he even said says in Deuteronomy to me belongeth Vengeance and recompense their foot shall slide in due time for the day of their Calamity is at hand and the things that shall come upon them make haste and Romans it says dearly beloved avenge not yourselves but rather give Place unto wrath for it is written vengeance is mine I will repay sayith the Lord so never ever authorized man to have Vengeance he never gave Vengeance to anybody he said vengeance is mine so essentially actually to take Vengeance like all these men did they were wrong cuz that Vengeance Belongs to the Lord and he never shared it with us never gave it to us and and as a matter of fact we're actually we're actually taught to suffer wrong rather than take Vengeance we're supposed to say oh it's okay and and not take Vengeance back right now but that doesn't mean there's no Vengeance you got to understand we serve a god of vengance so if we don't take Vengeance mark my words somebody will see what happens when you do that like this here therefore if eny hunger feed him if he thirst give him drink now it's not just to make the man feel good or the woman feel good whatever it might be I'm not saying to people whatever it might be but it's very powerful because he says in doing so you'll put you'll heat coals of fire upon his head why cuz there's an unsettled score and and and somebody is going to have take Vengeance and settle that score somebody and I know who it's going to be if you if you uh give up that opportunity it doesn't go that score just doesn't stay unsettled you understand that God's a faithful God of Vengeance he's going to take Vengeance absolutely that's why the Bible says it's a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the Living God because a man can can suddenly he find himself I'm in the hands of the Living God because I've got Vengeance from God coming upon me we a man and woman can end up in that situation where they've fallen into the hands of the Living God it's a fearful thing we I've got a verse for that shortly you remember the arish massacre when that that um truck driver went and and um took ended up taking maybe 20 of these young girls hostage in that little single room armish Schoolhouse in Pennsylvania he was a very warped man and he hated God and things like that and um and he and he he wanted to rape and do things um so he he ended up taking all these girls hostage and sent all the teachers and all the boys out and had all sorts of awful plans but it kind of just eventuated a different way and he ended up killing I think it was 11 of these arish school girls before he shot himself and um word of the spread around the world like wildfire and they say it wasn't so much because it was a shooting a school shooting because there were plenty of school shootings there weren't really that common in 10 you know only 10 not that it was small but I think the reason why it spread around the world because they were like well even the armor schools are not safe from this you know you think oh inner city schools you know yeah people got shoot up there but an armor school you know of all places You' think wouldn't happen there so it became an a a worldwide uh event like it it everyone knew about it but the armish did something unusual in their response was that from the get-go because they believe that we don't take Vengeance we we it's not given to us to take Vengeance it's given to us to forgive that's what we've been told to do not take Vengeance so their response from day one was we hold nothing against this man that killed all of our children we forgive him we don't take Vengeance we wish him all the best he's dead but more so we feel sorry for his wife and his children uh and to the point where they the the world flooded money to the Amish in in terms of gifts and that they they flooded money to them they took some of that money and gave it to the Widow and the children of the deceased man to help her in her troubles what she was going through and when they had the funeral there were about there were 70 people at the funeral of this man that was the killer 40 of them were his family and 30 of them were arish to support the the woman than the children you know and and and the world couldn't comprehend the response because the world is used to Vengeance they're used to used to the the victims the survivors whoever coming out saying you know I I hate that man I hope he burns in hell you know that they're used to that response not used to we responsive I have mercy I forgive in the face of such a traumatic experience like You' just killed 11 little girls in our small tight knit Circle Our Lives will never be the same again and yet we forgive and and the the mother the wife of this man was so touch he said your love for our family has helped provide the healing we so desperately need gifts you have given have touched our hearts in a way no words can describe your compassion has reached beyond our family beyond our community and is changing our world and for this we sincerely thank you I me you to say that if they hadn't have done that response you wouldn't be hearing this today it would have just it would have just gone down and been a little blip on the radar but because of their response even years and years later people are still talking about it films being made about it of their response which was not Vengeance forgiveness people debated it on talk shows should they have done that should they have had mercy right they should have had vengeance they debated it it was such a powerful thing but now that man is gone now but even in these circumstances there's no account that goes unsettled if you if you forgive and suffer wrong it doesn't remain unsettled just want to assure you of that second Thessalonians says so that we ourselves glory in you and the Churches of God for your patience in faith and all your persecutions and tribulations that you endure which is a manif token of the righteous Judgment of God that you may be counted worthy of the kingdom of God for which you also suffer seeing it as a righteous thing with God to recompense tribulation to them that trouble you righteous and you who are troubled rest with us when the Lord Jesus shall be revealed from heaven with his mighty angels and flaming fire taking Vengeance on them that know not God and that obey not the gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ who shall be punished with Everlasting destruction from the presence of the Lord and from the glory of his power Vengeance and this is the verse here for we know him that has said Vengeance belongeth unto me I will recompense sayith the Lord and again the Lord shall judge his people that's why he says it is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the Living God to find ourselves on the receiving end of Vengeance and if we even as a Christian maybe potentially could we there's only one anomaly I suppose this concept of who he's given it to is that he actually has given it to governments he's actually authorized governments that they can meet out Vengeance where it's needed there's a verse in um and this is this is the exception on this this concept it says submit yourselves to every ordinance of man for the Lord's sake whether it be to Kings as supreme or Governors as unto them that are sent by him for the punishment of evildoers and for the praise of them that do well so he's actually said yeah but there's one exception because we're men and women and we've got a society and things have to happen a certain way he's realized okay well I have to authorize a certain in a certain system that yes you may take Vengeance and he's Vengeance in a way you can meet out a punishment for something and now some governments go corrupt and everything but generally speaking we all have this concept we want a good government that will take Vengeance on someone's wronged me I can go to the government they did wrong to me and then the the government comes in and and takes Vengeance throws that person in prison does something they they they have Vengeance on my on someone that wronged me right that's how that's how it works like like if we didn't have if we didn't have that Concept in society society would be just chaos but the Lord has actually given that concept to man said the governments can actually can uh Implement Vengeance right that's why you can't have this thing called vigilante justice which is where if you wrong me I go and I can break the law to get you back if you break like if you come and hurt me you're wrong but I can't come the next day with a bat and beat you to get you back for what you did for me because I'm I'm not under the law I can't take vengeance upon you but the law can I can go to the law and say uh this guy beat me with a bat the other day you know here's my mark and here's this and they take fish into the court say F did you beat him with a [Laughter] B yeah but I didn't like how he talked to me at music practice I'm tired of it man I'm done and I have to and then the law will implement the Justice right this case here was um uh this was a Texas dad he he a man was trying to rape his 5-year-old daughter and he beat this man to death but he got off that crime only because he found he was he caught them in the ACT he caught this man in the act and they they argued and said well he used reasonable Force to protect his daughter the man didn't die then but he died of his wounds not long afterwards like whatever he but he tried to save him he told the noal mon can you guys get here this guy's dying but but they so they they didn't allow because the government can never allow vigilante justice they could never do that because it would undermine what they actually what they there for they can never say yeah fair enough bad man raping your daughter yet kill him they can never do that as much as we as Society want them to well just hey that man was wrong and he was right you know but they can't ever say CU that would undermine their whole the their whole structure but and it wouldn't be Godly either and they can't do it because God set up the system do you understand what I mean right so but in this case they said look it was reasonable Force to save her because you caught them in the a so that wasn't vigilante justice in terms of you tracked him down a week later and killed him that would have been different right one person that did was this lady Maran Bak German so her quite her daughter was maybe 12 13 she got raped by someone that she knew and it was during her the court um trial she actually went in there with a had it snuck in there like the third or fourth day whatever it was with a a gun in her overcoat and you know when the guy walked in she went there and shot like six or seven rounds at this man and killed him and now the whole world was saying look fear fear game you know the guy raped his daughter all Fe raped her daughter all fear but she still went to prison for that because it's like well you we were busy implementing Vengeance and you just took it yourself what didn't belong to you so they rightfully so put her in prison because if she had waited that he would have got his his time and the thing with vigilante justice it denies the right of the other person will fear trial too there may be confusion you know is that all right okay I just wanted to cover that because when you talk about vengeance there is still a certain amount that get meat here right okay I want to turn to this one turn to um what's the password on this bro there you go people you know I want to come back here and um turn this a little bit I want to talk about the City of Refuge now when the children of Israel when when the lamb was set up the Lord knew there'd be situations where there needed to be a place where a man or a woman could go if they were if they done wrong but they they they would not it was a mistake or something could happened a place where they could go to to Escape right it was called the City of Refuge and and the Lord set up six of these places he designated six in Israel he said speak unto the children of Israel and say unto them when you come over into Jordan into the land of Canaan then shall you appoint then shall then you shall appoint you cities to be Cities of Refuge for you that the Slayer May flee thither which kth any person at unawares like by mistake and they shall be unto you cities for Refuge that the for Refuge from the Avenger that the man slay die not until he stand before the congregation in judgment so he could flee to one of these cities one of these six cities there was one either side of the the river uh three either side of the river now the the first rule was if you murder someone you die so you try and get into City good luck you know he said because that's what this one here says but if he has thrust him of hatred or H at him by lying in waight has planned that he die or an enity Smite him with his hand that he die he that smot him shall be put to death for he is a murderer the Revenger of blood shall slay the murderer when he meeteth him real simple he ain't making it the no City because he's guilty okay now but if it's an accident then you can run to the City of Refuge because it says but if he thrust him suddenly without enity or have cast upon him anything without laying of weight or with any stone wherewith a man may die seeing him not like an accident and cast it upon him that he die and was not his enemy neither sought his harm then the congregation shall judge between the Slayer and the Revenger of blood according to these judgments and the congregation shall deliver the Slayer out of the hand of the Revenger of blood and the congregation shall restore him to the city of his Refuge whether he was fled and he shall abide in it unto the death of the high priest which was anointed with the Holy oil so in a sense they kind of get there then they have a judgment whether they can stay there or not if they're guilty throw them out they Avenger murders them not murder you'd say kill right but if yes it was an accident you didn't mean to kill that person then they may have been judging them in some other town but they would send them back to the City of Refuge that they first turned up in and the the and the agreement was that you will stay there until the death of the current high priest when he dies you're free it's quite a neat way how God did it because he then he designs I only want you to be in there for one year other people may be 40 years it depends how long the high priest was alive for you know someone may have been one day priest dies that same day well that was short it doesn't matter that was what the Lord had designated it's not like oh you got a 20 year sentence it's like it's as it's as long as what I think is going to work in my whole scheme because I want you to be out somewhere and do whatever you do right that's why it says but if the Slayer but if the Slayer shall any time come within the border of the City of Refuge whether he was fled and there renger of blood find him without the borders of the city off his refuge and the Revenger of blood kill the Slayer he shall not be guilty of blood because he should have remained in the city of uh remained in the city of his Refuge until the death of the high priest but after the death of the high priest the slash shall return unto the land of his possession so if this guy wanders outside the city and the guy that was after him sees him even though he was rightfully out to be in the city this man could just kill him you're outside the city okay that's how the city of ref Refuge worked now I've got a question in all this who was chasing this person who was chasing him well I'll answer the question there's a person called the Avenger of blood and actually that's that's actually a kinsman redeemer part of a Kinsman redeemer's job is to be the Avenger of blood you know when we think of the the kinsman redeemer we think you know they like oh we think of this you know which is what it is too you know to redeem like Boaz you know he was a kinsman redeemer that he ksom of redeemers have a certain amount of character to them because they've got to do something for somebody that that person could not do for themselves and they've got to it usually comes at a cost to themselves like but part of their job was to be an Avenger of blood as well because if your kin had been say your brother your someone in your family had been killed it was your job to go and execute vengeance upon that death and kill whoever it was that did that to your brother or sister or father whoever it was it was your job to go and avenge that blood you had to you're a kinsman redeemer you you got to chase after that man the through the whole country or woman whoever it was you chase them and you go and kill him that sounds rough but that was their job that that they were and and they would some of them were so intent they would wait outside the city set up home outside the city maybe for Years brother wait is that man going to come out this try and COA him out the minute that man stepped foot out that City CU they were an Avenger of blood that they were supposed to actually go and kill that person okay but now talking about I just quickly want to go through this just to type it this way first to show you the character that these that that a Kinsman had Boaz had to redeem Naomi but then in doing so he had to take Ruth and raise up seed to Ruth and that seed would not be his it would be Ruth's past away husband that's how the law of that's how the law of um kinsman redeemer in this sense worked that the the the Kinsman had to come and raise seed up and that if there was a boy that boy would be the son of the deceased husband and so it came at a cost to them that's why when Boaz went to the nin that had first rights to Naomi his first reply was yeah I'll take her and Bo said you understand that when you take her you've got to take um Ruth and you got to raise up seed to Ruth in place of your husband you got to it's going to cost you something here I just walk in and take it easy it's going to cost you something and and and that's why that man said I can't do it cuz I'm My Own inheritance I've got to my own things over here I can't do that I relinquish my opportunity to be a Kinsman you can you take her and and that's why with um Tamar it was the same it was Tamar's um first husband was was a wicked man and the Lord slew him so then um um uh her father his father what was his name um Juda so then Judah said to the ne to the the his his next in line which was Onan he said okay well you need to go and be a kinsman redeemer to um to Tamer and you you need to go and raise up seed to your brother so so when she has a a seed a son that's going to be the son of er that's what you need to go and do as a kinsman redeemer you need to go and do that to her and it took a it's going to take sacrifice for that man it's going to take effort he has to you know he has to redeem her and but what he did was he went in and he he slept with her but then it says that at the end he spilled his seed on the ground because he knew he didn't want actually to he want he didn't want to raise up seed and the Lord saw that as so wicked because he said I say you you you took her body but you see she didn't want her heart because in her heart she wanted SE she wanted a she wanted the line to carry on she she wanted to bring forth but you just took her body left her heart you basically just left your heart on the ground and you took her body cuz that's essentially what he did cuz that's what she want wanted and he didn't give that to her and that's what he was supposed to do and the Lord found that so wicked that he took Vengeance and slew him because you you should have taken her body and her heart that was your responsibility and you just did that I think about him and I think you would have been better off doing it now you're dead sure your brother might have had you rais seed to your brother let you be alive you made the silly move and then now you're dead you got nothing silly boy we we we we'll go on but but a Kinsman has the same responsibility to take Vengeance as well because there's this principle that the land must be purged that's why that's why it carries on and the Lord says moreover you shall Take No Satisfaction for the life of a murderer uh which is guilty of death but he shall surely be put to death and he says and you shall Take No Satisfaction to him that has fled to the city of his Refuge that he should come again and to dwell in the land until the death of the high priest if he leaves those Gates there's no mercy Take No Satisfaction don't be all soft on your heart oh the guy's been there for 40 years let him go see his family no satisfaction so ye shall not pollute the land wherein ye are for blood it defileth the land and the land cannot be cleansed by the blood that is shed therein but by the blood of him that shed it defile not therefore the land which you shall inhabit wherein I dwell for I the Lord dwell among the children of Israel so he's saying You must be an Avenger of blood you got to keep this land clean you can't just sit back oh well no if you must avenge your Kinsmen you must and God's saying if you don't you're going to defile the land this land's going to be polluted because you didn't avenge your kin you just let laid back and let him let this murderer run around you didn't avenge it and he said I I dwell here this is my land this is where I live keep it clean yeah it sounds powerful but it's but there's a there's a there's a bigger principle in all this of being an Avenger of blood and a Kinsman that we have a responsibility to now in this day we've got a responsibility as Kinsmen to we've got some avenging to do we've got some there's some Vengeance that we have to meet out that is a responsibility to cleanse the land I want to go to this and I'll I'll go into that I want to start talking about the day of Vengeance now Jesus when he was when he was here he it says one day he went into the temple and it says and when he came to Nazareth where and he had been brought up and as his custom was he went into the synagogue on the Sabbath day and stood up for it to read and there was delivered unto him a book of the prophet Isaiah so they a priest came up and and and handed a book on onto the where he was walked up with it and then it says and when he had opened up the book he found the place where it was written he read he said the spirit of the Lord is upon me because Heath anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor and he has sent me to heal the brokenhearted to preach Deliverance to the captives and the recovering of sight to the Blind and set at Liberty them that are bruised to preach the acceptable year of the Lord then it says he closed the book and he brought it back down to the priest and it says and he gave it and and he gave it again to the minister and sat down and the eyes of all of them that were in the synagogue were fastened on him and he began to say unto them this day is the scripture fulfilled in your ears so you're he said you're seeing the Fulfillment of this unfolding as we speak this is happening right now but then we go back into the the the place where he read from and we read it and it say this is where he read from it says the spirit of the Lord God is upon me because the Lord hath anointed me to preach Good Tidings unto the meek he has sent me to bind up the broken hearted to Proclaim Liberty to the captives and the opening of the prison to them that abound to proclaim the acceptable year of the Lord and then he stopped there but he stopped mids sentence and the last of it the next sentence says and the day of Vengeance of our God he didn't read that because it wasn't quite the day of Vengeance of our God but it's here now now brother Brandon preached the message and 24th of January 1965 called birth pains and he got up to start to read his message and he had a new Bible he opened it up then he said I'll will go to St John's gospel the 17th chapter and beginning with the 20th verse I wish to read for a text I think it's right he gets the wrong chapter and book verse for the first one because it's supposed to be 16 he says then he says Ah I believe I got the wrong place now excuse me uh just a moment I'm looking for jesus' prayer that uh Jesus prayer rather but for as I might have got marked down here on my text somewhere wrong it's where Jesus prayed or was saying that as a woman a travail for birth of a child child birth is TR so I'm looking for that verse and it's 1720 is not the right verse and then there's a bit of Talk Amongst them they say oh no uh you want 16 brother brandham uh chapter 16 verse um uh verse 21 it's 16:21 so so then he opens up his Bible like this and and I've put this verse down the bottom of the page like that so you can imagine this verse is sitting at the bottom and he reads John then it says very very sound to you that yes so no it's not that one so then he turns the page over to there which is so we got verse 20 then he turns the page over verse 21 and he says that they may be one and he says no no and we'll go back what' you say it was 1621 and he'll go back here and okay so yep that's 20 you turn back over and get 21 on the top of the that page you say that they no that's not are you sure it's 21 they say yeah brother brand it's 21 the verse you want and then after a little while he says well that's what it is there's a misprint in this Bible That's they're missing out a page you know there's that look there's no 21 here Brothers it's it's the we're in another place it's a you know at the start he thought it was something then he realized he's a mistake so then what happened then was a priest a Catholic priest that was in the in the meeting had a Bible on him and he walked up to the pulpit and handed brother Bram his Bible and and when he went up there he said he Catholic Archbishop John Stanley gives his Bible to brother bam and says he said just draw breath there's a reason why it was done and you know it and God will show you something to bring out of this that's wonderful something out of this that's wonderful and brother B says all right just use mine here brother Brenham he says thank you thank you very much thank you very much then he reads then he reads um um the I should have got that verse he reads about birth pains as a woman is in travail you know and birth pains coming upon the world he reads that and once he's finished reading the verse he goes and walks down and hands the Bible back to the priest and then he preaches a message called birth pains which is saying there's there's a pain there's a travail coming upon the Earth it's it's coming on and and there's a judgment there's Vengeance coming upon the Earth he began to preach the day of Vengeance because he was fulfilling the second half of this prophecy and the day of Vengeance of our God and he's ushering in the day of Vengeance there's a day of Vengeance coming on the earth like of God's Fierce Vengeance like you've never seen before he's and and and because you know you see the type that je the priest walked up to Jesus he read the first but bring it back down this one the priest walked up he read the and he brought it back down and he preach birth pains which is the the day of Vengeance and we are now living in the second half of this verse and it's all around you it's everywhere you look everywhere you look everything you feel everything you experience Brewing amongst all this is the Fierce Vengeance of God that's just permeating through the whole thing Vengeance that's a there's no escaping this day of Vengeance it's here and it's just coming on it's it's and it's it's not going to be it's not going to pull back it's not going to oh I take that back it's going to it's going to meet all of the punishment that it wants to that it desires to me this Fierce day of Vengeance these birth pains it's this tribulation there's going to be tribulation like the world's never seen before why because it's Vengeance there Fierce Vengeance it's a we the only thing we got going on for us here is a day of Vengeance that's it it's a day of Vengeance and and that's why he says say to them that have a fearful heart be strong fear not behold your God will come with vengeance even god with the recompense he will come and save you a lot of times he says vengeance is me coming to save you now I want to bring this around to a different way of who we are now in this time of Vengeance because we have a part to play in this Vengeance I say this actually we'll go back here after this after he preached birth pains brother BR preached a sermon called this day this scripture is fulfilled the next day this day the scripture is fulfilled because he said he said all the scriptures are going to be fulfilled yeah there's going to be birth P there's going to be a people on the Earth that are going to be victorious this day the scripture is fulfilled there's going to be a people on this Earth that are going to be undefeated Ed this day the scripture is fulfilled there's going to be a people on the Earth that are going to be righteous like I'm righteous that are going to do the works that I did this day the scriptures fulfilled we're living in the time of all these things coming to pass sure it's a day of Vengeance but there's also people that are going to rise up and be Victorious and undefeatable in every situation they're going to be victorious they're going to be they're going to be Overcomers there's not there's going to be no no devil no nothing that ever overcomes these people they're going to be 100% victorious in everything they're going to they're going to achieve everything that nobody through all the ages has ever done there's never going to be a people like this people this day the scripture is fulfilled that's he's saying this day that day is now there is going to be a people and and that's where that's where we for them when you when you look down All Through the Ages you've had Kinsmen your brethren All Through the Ages that have tried so hard to to overcome and every age they've been defeated Ephesus they almost got there but they were defeated who by this enemy there an enemy all through the ages has has essentially defeated our Kinsmen and who are we Kinsmen what is this now it's a day of Vengeance we're living in a day of Vengeance where we're going to take Vengeance there's going to be a people that are going to rise up and slay these demons these there's no devil every devil that that that win against every other person in history is going to come against us and is going to fail why because he's got to raise up someone that's going to take vengeance a Kinsman that's going to take vengeance upon all who is those people us you wonder why you're going through so many hard trials you got to get strong you got to be 100% Victorious no doubt no unbelief no losing you're not going to lose you cannot lose this one it's time for vengeance you got to take Vengeance there's going to be the same Devils that came there that are going to face that will face you and you're going to defeat every one of them you got to take Vengeance on your enemies for your can All Through the Ages this day the scripture is fulfilled today is a day of Vengeance Fierce Vengeance the most fiercest fight you ever had for Humanity in the sense of a gospel is nowall every devil that's ever comes through all the ages and and one anything every one of them is going to get defeated by who you who else you it's not just a story it's a d Vengeance Vengeance on your enemies Vengeance for your king if they almost got there in emphasis you think well they were amazing you're going to be bit cuz they were defeated oh yes but brother B said this the scripture is fulfilled there will be a people that will not be defeated I'm going through hard things get used to it toughest thing I've ever been through my life get used to it cuz you're fighting the hardest fight you've ever fought Christians are going to fight the hardest fight they've ever fought the bride will you never fought a fight like this one cuz no one's ever ever been totally undefeated and slain all the enemies nobody nobody get used to some hard stuff get used to being made strong that's why when that here that that's why this one I've spoken unto you this night do not fear believe my word have faith and believe if you knew what lay Beyond the Veil you would rejoice in the fire you would see what it delivers you from Hallelujah and you would volunteer for it rest in the trial don't fear Faith gives power to the enemy uh fear gives power to the enemy but Faith brings Deliverance now if you have one speak of unbelief you're done can I say that again if you have one spe of unbelief you're done done you failed I'm saying you you know in order to defeat every enemy it's got to be 100% faith not one single spe of Doubt anywhere think about it how could anything less take Vengeance on these enemies they managed to defeat everyone every single person All Through the Ages but they ain't going to defeat you and they ain't going to defeat me I got this this is just a little testimony my glad I'm not song leading after this so I don't know if you know but I've been through the hardest thing I've ever been through for the last two years in my entire life it's like I've just been I've had demons at me from every direction like just relentlessly like down to the wire for like you wouldn't believe like I've been through some hard stuff for this one's on another level this is like you kidding me there's a whole Legion of demons just following run all B it was just just intense now for two whole years they they just these things at me they comeing waves and this and that and like I never had a fear of ever being beaten because I got I don't know there's something in me that just I know overall I'm not going to be completely done although I might get smashed a pulp and end up on the ground I sort of you know may I kind of open my mouth is that all you got you know then I'll get up the next day and give it another go I never had a problem with getting up again it was never the isue but I got sick of being ended up on ending up on the mat like man there's a day when I'm not going to you're not going to get me at all these demons are coming at me they would they leave me for a bit then they'd come back and it would just come waves of stuff and and they would always get me just either a little bit or a big amount if they got me a big amount I shouldn't say nothing bad but it was just they would get me but if they got me a small amount it was not so bad but it was still an amount see if I want to be a kinsman redeemer Avenger of blood there's going to be nothing because a small amount means you get me nothing means I get you I I'm I get you and I'm like I get you you caused me so much grief you caused me so much hardship caused me so much trouble and I I've got this I got Vengeance Brewing up of me like you wouldn't believe on my enemies I'm like you guys and I thought you wait till one day I stand you do you you thrw everything you got at me and I don't and I don't end up down there you wait till I get to that spot there's going to be trouble for you like you never believed and about two weeks ago this thing came at with with everything it's got man and it was days and days and I just thought n today this time's the time I ain't budging one inch on these things man I'm I'm just going to stand these guys ain't going to get me on this one and day after day man I just stood stand and relentlessly it came but you know what after about 2 or 3 days of this I've just I fought back with everything I had mouth thought it's like it's now or never it's been years of this I'm I'm I'm dealing with these things today this day the scriptures fulfilled man I started beating these guys back it was so hard CU you just you used to all their blows to get you this way you come over here they get you there you just you know where they get you and every time he's going to come that way and I just I got I'm not going to let him get me there he ain't getting me there he ain't getting me there it was a like a fight to the death you know but everyone I repelled at all every single one after about two or three days I felt you know the Bible says resist the devil he'll flee from you after about two or three days these things started to be on the run I'm like that was it these guys are on the Run first time in years they ain't down this time didn't go down like you know when you realize that I didn't go down this time you get so much like confidence you think wow was that all you had and you couldn't do it am may you better watch out cuz I'm just getting started here like when David slew Goliath what happened when he slew Goliath he didn't go well that's Goliath done you know time to go home boys when Goliath fell what happened we can get all the rest of them too and the whole of the Israeli Army just started to moveing and these guys fled they slew them in The Valleys in the rivers on the mountains anywhere they could find them because they you know when you when you f one of these people you can just move you start moving through I thought you did the I got so much Vengeance Brewing on me against these things that have hampered me like and if you don't get me that time you actually the Revelation came you can never get me never I'm undefeatable now you can never ever get me I look around think I know your tactics you tried them all none of them worked you never got me that's a mentality you realize then you'll never get me then I'm going to be a pretty nasty kinsman redeemer a pretty nasty Avenger of Blood Cuz I can get you you can't get me so I want to go through and slay all my enemies defeat you at every turn you think that's pretty bold you tell me any other way we're going to do it tell me the other way just in closing here that's why you know we talk about a new there's going to be a new Heaven and a new Earth that's why this Earth has to be like there just there's got to be this Divine judgment there's got to be Vengeance taken on it because because the Lord said in this other the numbers here he says so you shall not pollute the land wherein you are and it says 34 says defile not the land we in and which you shall inhabit wherein I dwell for I the Lord dwell among the children of Israel now the Lord's going to end up dwelling here he's got to avenge it that's his job to do this that the avenging in terms of natural things and people we don't the avenging I'm talking about is against demons that have come against our Kinsmen so I'm not going to go around killing any any person naturally or punching them over you know it's not but yet God there's got to be avengeance for all the sin that's done upon this Earth that's why this whole birth pains and tribulation is coming on because it's it's got to be the Lord says I'm going to live here I've got to settle the score on this Earth I can't have un unfinished uh pollution on the land I'm going to have to I have to square everything up before we can move in essentially he's got to that and and that's God's Vengeance he said it's the day of Vengeance it's the day that I'm going to purge the whole land that's his Vengeance he's going about all the sin you see around you it it's it's not going to go unpunished there's vengeance is is brewing to sort the whole thing out to settle every single account and there's never been a time of so much sin in the world and so much evil and just heart the last time it got almost this bad was when it was when it was um Noah and and God in his heart thought I just can't take this anymore probably weren't even as many people on the Earth as then it's the same sort of thing I can't take this anymore that's why it's a day of Vengeance Fierce Vengeance that and every score is going to be settled every every it's all going to be squared up so that there's no pollution in the land so when we come back here it's going to be clean no no unfinished scores no unsettled it's a day of Vengeance so that's that's that was my little thought that I wanted to share with you this morning that that we live in a day of Vengeance for us it's a good day like who likes a good fight yeah man then you've come to the right uh decade you've come to the right what do we call this um you've come to the right Church age you know you come to the
