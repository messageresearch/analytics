[0:24] welcome to Global answers please join us
[0:27] as we discuss the relevance of God's
[0:29] eternal word relating to events in this
[0:32] day and what it means to you and now
[0:36] your host Lonnie Jenkins Hello friends
[0:40] welcome to another session of global
[0:42] answers I have a special privilege the
[0:45] next probably three or four sessions to
[0:47] speak to you individually I'm not
[0:50] planning on having any guests in the
[0:52] studio with me I want to talk to you
[0:55] about probably one of the most
[0:56] controversial subjects out of scripture
[0:59] or Rel religion and that is the godhead
[1:02] is there one is there two is there three
[1:05] is there many that's going to be our
[1:08] subject for
[1:10] today the big question would be are
[1:12] there many gods is there only one God or
[1:16] is that one God somehow
[1:19] divided and I want to make this clear
[1:22] that such points as these could not be
[1:25] known in previous ages the Bible shows
[1:28] us clearly that that is to be a mystery
[1:31] saved till the time of the end
[1:33] Revelations 10:7 tells us during the
[1:35] days of the voice of the seventh angel
[1:38] when he should begin to sound the
[1:39] mystery of God should be finished as
[1:42] he's declared to a servants the prophets
[1:44] so consequently it was an unknown thing
[1:47] until this age many have probed at it
[1:49] many have studied it many speculations
[1:52] have come and so we're not trying in any
[1:55] way to put down what people have always
[1:57] believed or previously believed that's
[2:00] not the idea the idea is that we want to
[2:02] share with you what God has done in this
[2:05] age in unveiling scripture so in the
[2:08] days of the voice of the seventh angel
[2:10] that would of course be the same angel
[2:12] that is the messenger to the last Church
[2:14] age in Revelations 3:14 it says under
[2:16] the angel of the Church of leoda that's
[2:19] the seventh Church seventh Gentile
[2:22] church and as we've told you before
[2:24] these churches though literal are
[2:27] actually symbolic of Ages to come and
[2:30] we're in that final age that Leo leodan
[2:33] age you can read about these in
[2:34] Revelations chapter 2 and chapter 3 the
[2:37] term angel merely means messenger it can
[2:40] be a super Supernatural being it can be
[2:42] just a man with a message sent from God
[2:46] and so we see that this mystery of God
[2:48] is reserved until this unveiling is to
[2:51] take place in the voice of the seventh
[2:53] angel so keep in mind we're not trying
[2:55] to put down previous teachings or what
[2:58] your church taught or what the oldtime
[3:01] churches taught that's not the issue the
[3:02] issue is God has done something new and
[3:05] we just want to share with you what God
[3:08] has done in in this
[3:11] age so just before the second coming of
[3:14] the lord of the Lord Jesus Christ God
[3:17] has graciously sent us a thus saith the
[3:20] Lord on many biblical things points that
[3:23] are essential to our faith in
[3:26] preparation for the next really big
[3:29] event in God's program which is the
[3:31] resurrection and the Rapture or the
[3:33] catching away or the meeting in the air
[3:36] as is spoken of in first Thessalonians
[3:38] chap 4 verse veres 15 to1
[3:42] 17 Faith comes by hearing and hearing by
[3:46] the word of God and this age is required
[3:49] to have a faith unlike any previous age
[3:52] before because no other age has had to
[3:55] believe for a change in their body the
[3:58] meeting in the air the Rapture and uh we
[4:01] shall all be changed in a moment in a
[4:03] twinkling of eye as Corinthians 15 says
[4:06] that's all the same event the change
[4:09] throws us into contact with the next
[4:11] Dimension and so this is the first age
[4:14] that's that has to have the faith to
[4:16] believe for that so consequently a very
[4:19] special message had to come a very pure
[4:22] word to bring a very pure Faith to
[4:25] prepare a people for this second coming
[4:27] this body's change so this series that
[4:30] we are embarking on today will last the
[4:32] next few meetings I'm not quite sure uh
[4:35] how many sessions we'll have together
[4:37] but I'm guessing we'll go probably
[4:39] another two or three uh at a
[4:42] minimum so we'll speak of the god of
[4:45] Abraham Isaac and Israel as the
[4:48] scripture refers to him is he one is he
[4:51] two is he three we look at various
[4:54] scriptures and we can see how the people
[4:55] could draw conclusions in Deuteronomy uh
[4:59] 3
[5:00] 239 it says see now that I even I am he
[5:06] there is no God with me I kill and I
[5:09] make alive I wound and I
[5:12] heal neither is there any that can
[5:15] deliver out of my hand for I lift up my
[5:18] hand to heaven and say I live forever
[5:23] that's God speaking God spoke through
[5:25] his prophet Isaiah in Isaiah 469
[5:28] remember the former things of bold for I
[5:30] am God and there is none else I am God
[5:34] and there is none like me declaring the
[5:37] end from the beginning and from ancient
[5:41] times the things that are not yet done
[5:44] saying my counsel shall stand I will do
[5:48] all my pleasure so when a god declares
[5:51] that he alone can tell you the future
[5:53] and holds the future there is no God
[5:56] except the god of the Bible that does
[5:58] those things because he holds holds the
[6:00] future he can tell you what the future
[6:02] will be and so he declares that what
[6:04] makes him the outstanding God of all the
[6:08] things that people might call Gods Moses
[6:11] wrote Under the inspiration of God in
[6:14] Deuteronomy 6:4 here o Israel the Lord
[6:17] our God is one Lord so when we look at
[6:21] that our conclusion would obviously be
[6:23] it seems there is one God but then we go
[6:26] into the Psalms and we listen to David
[6:28] in Psalms 1101 and it says the Lord said
[6:32] unto my Lord sit thou at my right hand
[6:35] until I make thine enemies thy foot stol
[6:38] and that's of course if we break it down
[6:40] just a little bit that's the Lord
[6:42] Jehovah said unto my Lord
[6:46] adone now this this word adone is used
[6:49] in reference to Kings to men to God to
[6:53] Masters rulers husbands prophets princes
[6:57] Governors then then sit thou at my right
[7:00] hand until I make thine enemies thy foot
[7:03] stol it could be that we can now draw
[7:06] the conclusion there are two gods and
[7:09] then now we jump into the New Testament
[7:11] in Matthew 3
[7:12] 3:16 when Jesus went down to be baptized
[7:16] by the prophet John and Jesus when he
[7:18] was baptized went up straight way out of
[7:21] the water and lo Heavens were opened
[7:24] unto him and he saw the spirit of God
[7:26] descending like a dove and lighting upon
[7:29] him listen now and lo a voice from
[7:32] Heaven saying this is my beloved Son in
[7:35] whom I am well pleased so now in these
[7:38] scriptures we see Jesus the son the Holy
[7:42] Spirit like a dove and the father
[7:45] speaking from heaven now what's our
[7:48] conclusion now it almost looks like
[7:50] there's three and yet when we go back to
[7:54] Moses writings the Lord our God is one
[7:56] God then we know we know that there has
[7:59] to only be one so consequently many say
[8:03] oh he's three in one and some say he's
[8:07] three persons yet one God some say he's
[8:11] three like water and in various stages
[8:14] water can be liquid water can be solid
[8:17] and be ice water can be powerful like
[8:19] Steam and yet all three forms are still
[8:23] water could it be that God has appeared
[8:26] in many forms some people say that God
[8:29] there are three manifestations or
[8:31] offices of God in the father and the Son
[8:34] and the Holy Ghost we often hear the
[8:37] term Trinity that actually is not a
[8:40] scriptural word it's not in the Bible
[8:43] Trinity according to the new
[8:45] international encyclopedia the term
[8:47] Trinity was originated by a a Roman
[8:51] Catholic father named tertullian and
[8:53] then looking further into the EOL
[8:56] glossery it says tertullian was the
[8:58] first one to use the term trinus which
[9:02] is Trinity to describe the godhead but
[9:04] of course that goes on to say in so
[9:07] doing he paved the way of the
[9:09] development of the Orthodox trinitarian
[9:11] or christological trinitarian doctrines
[9:15] and this was in about ad. 200 a good 150
[9:20] years after the forming of the Christian
[9:22] church in the book of Acts at
[9:25] Pentecost God declares to his prophet
[9:27] Isaiah Isaiah 45 522 look unto me and be
[9:32] saved all the ends of the Earth for I am
[9:34] God and there is none else I have sworn
[9:38] by myself the word is gone out of my
[9:41] mouth in righteousness and shall not
[9:43] return that unto me every knee shall bow
[9:47] and every tongue shall
[9:50] swear so there is a God that swears he
[9:53] is an absolute and one day everyone will
[9:56] know it right now this is called the day
[9:59] of man there's great debate about God
[10:02] some saying there is no such thing as
[10:03] God or a supernatural being as a godhead
[10:07] but those who believe know there is and
[10:10] many have had an experience to meet that
[10:13] personal God now this subject is not
[10:16] merely theology excuse me and not just
[10:20] for our better understanding and here's
[10:23] why proper understanding is
[10:26] essential hold on to this now
[10:30] we don't know where it is God is taking
[10:33] us unless we understand about God and
[10:38] Christ how do we know how to get to a
[10:41] place unless we know what the goal is
[10:44] the scripture says in Romans 8:29 that
[10:47] we are promised to be conformed to the
[10:50] image of his son that he might be the
[10:52] first born among many Brethren so this
[10:56] conforming to the image of Christ so
[10:58] what is our destiny as Believers to be
[11:01] conformed or fashioned like unto God's
[11:05] son so what would that be many try to
[11:09] make it simple and say oh that's just to
[11:11] be like Jesus but again we have a
[11:14] question because now they're thinking
[11:16] about Jesus of Nazareth yet that Jesus
[11:20] of Nazareth said to the father in John
[11:23] 175 now father glorify thou me with
[11:28] thine own self with the glory which I
[11:31] had with thee before the world was so
[11:34] Jesus was more than just the man born of
[11:39] the Virgin
[11:40] Mary before the foundation of the world
[11:43] he had a glory that was God's glory now
[11:47] we'll see how that was as we continue in
[11:50] this study Paul writes in First
[11:53] Corinthians 10:1 moreover Brethren I
[11:55] would not that you should be ignorant
[11:57] how that our fathers were were under the
[11:59] cloud and all passed through the sea and
[12:02] were all baptized unto Moses in the
[12:05] cloud and the Sea and did all meat
[12:08] excuse me eat the same spiritual meat
[12:11] here comes the verse now and did all
[12:13] drink the same spiritual drink for they
[12:16] drank from that spiritual rock that
[12:18] followed them and that rock was Christ
[12:22] so now we have Jesus of Nazareth
[12:25] declaring that he had a glory that was
[12:27] God's Own Glory before the foundation of
[12:29] the world we see that he was with uh the
[12:33] children of Israel as that rock in the
[12:35] in the
[12:37] wilderness so this conforming to that
[12:39] image is still is just a little bit uh
[12:43] mysterious we've got to be conformed to
[12:45] that image Paul writes similarly in he
[12:49] to the Hebrews Church in 11: 24 by faith
[12:53] Moses when he was come to years refused
[12:57] to be called the son of Pharaoh's
[12:59] daughter choosing rather to suffer
[13:02] Affliction with the people of God than
[13:04] to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a
[13:07] season esteeming the reproach of Christ
[13:11] greater riches than the treasures of
[13:13] Egypt for he had respect unto the
[13:16] recompense of the reward so here's Moses
[13:19] long before Jesus was born of the Virgin
[13:21] Mary here's Moses willing to stand the
[13:24] reproach of
[13:26] Christ remember we're to be conformed
[13:29] formed to this image so we see from many
[13:32] scriptures that Christ was in existence
[13:34] before he came into
[13:37] flesh we'll understand that in this
[13:41] series now another part of this puzzle
[13:44] called the
[13:47] godhead John wrote in chapter 1: 18 no
[13:50] man has seen God at any time the only
[13:54] begotten son which is in the bosom of
[13:57] the father he has de declared him so
[14:00] Adam was also a Son of God but he was
[14:03] created not begotten so Jesus the only
[14:07] begotten son now Luke writes God is a
[14:12] spirit so now how can a spirit God have
[14:16] a flesh son we've all heard about the
[14:19] blood of Jesus Christ and so we go
[14:22] through the scriptures we find the blood
[14:24] of Christ the blood of Jesus and the
[14:26] book of Acts declares that the Church of
[14:29] God was purchased by God's own blood
[14:33] acts
[14:35] 20:28 but of course that's not too
[14:37] difficult to understand in one sense the
[14:39] blood of every father is in his child
[14:41] not Mother's blood the father's blood is
[14:44] in his children in the womb the baby is
[14:47] fed by the mother's blood but there's a
[14:49] separating veil in there to keep the
[14:51] mother's blood from becoming the child's
[14:54] blood at Birth only the father's blood
[14:57] is in that child and the the life of
[15:00] that child is in that blood cell the
[15:02] life is in the blood cell keep that in
[15:05] mind we're going to need that fact as we
[15:07] go further
[15:08] along it's important when in this series
[15:12] we reach Calvary and the shedding of the
[15:15] blood of Jesus Christ we're going to see
[15:17] how important it is that we know whose
[15:20] life was in that blood cell that was
[15:23] broken at
[15:25] Calvary so now let's gather our
[15:27] scriptures directly related to our
[15:31] study you can read with me there on your
[15:34] television screen first we will look at
[15:38] creation Genesis 1:1 in the beginning
[15:42] God created the Heaven and the Earth so
[15:45] somewhere at some point God declares a
[15:49] beginning for God himself there was no
[15:52] beginning he's Eternal Eternal has no
[15:54] beginning and no end so in the beginning
[15:57] God created Heaven and Earth in John 1:1
[16:01] it says in the beginning was the word
[16:05] and the Word was with God and the Word
[16:07] was God you will understand that by the
[16:10] time we finish this series the same was
[16:13] in the beginning with God a second
[16:16] person or some other understanding
[16:18] will'll see that as we go in the series
[16:21] now here's how it ties to Genesis all
[16:24] things were made by him and without him
[16:27] was not anything made made that was made
[16:30] so now in the beginning God created
[16:34] heaven and earth now we find in John
[16:36] that he made that creation by the word
[16:40] so God created in Genesis the word
[16:43] created in John and then in Ephesians
[16:47] 3:9 it says that God who created All
[16:51] Things by Jesus Christ so here we have
[16:55] our first significant point in the study
[16:57] of the godhead God created by the word
[17:01] and the name of that word is Jesus
[17:04] Christ in Revelations 1913 it says his
[17:08] name is called the word of God that's
[17:11] not his name but he's called the word of
[17:14] God but his name is Jesus now in
[17:18] Colossians 1:15 you can read starting
[17:21] above this but we'll start there it's
[17:22] speaking about Jesus Christ and it says
[17:26] in Colossians 1:15 who is the image of
[17:29] the invisible God the firstborn of every
[17:34] creature so
[17:36] this invisible God is beginning to
[17:40] become visible and declare himself
[17:43] through Christ Christ becomes the image
[17:47] and then it says the firstborn of every
[17:50] creature so that goes back far beyond
[17:53] the birth out of the Virgin Mary that
[17:56] goes back before there was a a rooster
[17:59] or a hen or an elephant or a lion or a
[18:02] human it goes back even before that so
[18:04] before there was any creature he was the
[18:07] firstborn so now we find out how was he
[18:10] the firstborn to become the
[18:12] manifestation of the invisible God I'll
[18:15] give you just a simple thought on that a
[18:18] word is a thought expressed when we
[18:22] speak a word it becomes an expression of
[18:25] my invisible thought so God god with his
[18:29] great thinking desired expression and
[18:33] out of the thoughts of God came the word
[18:37] and then Colossians 1:16 says for by him
[18:40] were all things created that are in
[18:43] heaven that are in Earth visible and
[18:47] invisible this Dimension or other
[18:49] dimensions whether they be Thrones or
[18:52] dominions principalities or Powers Here
[18:55] Comes an important part now all things
[18:57] were created by him that's Christ and
[19:02] for him by him and for him we many times
[19:07] want to get ourselves in the picture
[19:09] there and and want it created for us it
[19:12] isn't it's all for God if we go back and
[19:15] just study the name of Jehovah and the
[19:19] name of Elohim or the name of Adonai we
[19:23] find that those Hebrew names for God all
[19:26] boil down to the self-existent one who
[19:29] reveals himself and that's what we're
[19:32] studying now this self-existing one this
[19:35] invisible one desires to reveal himself
[19:39] he wants to be made known now back to
[19:42] Colossians 1:1 17 and he is before all
[19:46] things and by him all things consist and
[19:51] he is the head of the body the church
[19:54] who is the beginning the firstborn from
[19:57] the dead that in all things he might
[20:00] have the preeminence that's what
[20:03] Christ's position is to be to the
[20:05] believer everything we talk about
[20:07] everything we live for everything we
[20:09] know about is to be Christ the focus of
[20:12] our life Colossians 1:19 for it please
[20:15] the father that in him should all
[20:17] fullness
[20:20] dwell all fullness in Colossians chapter
[20:24] 2 it says he was the fullness of the
[20:26] godhead bodily so when the godhead what
[20:30] do we term the godhead that's Father Son
[20:33] and Holy Ghost so all of those entities
[20:37] were in This Man Called Jesus Christ of
[20:40] Nazareth such a mystery how can all of
[20:43] God be in a man we'll find out as we
[20:46] continue in our
[20:48] study so we can see from these
[20:50] scriptures that the mystery surrounding
[20:52] the invisible God is
[20:54] revealed and through revealed in and
[20:58] through through Christ or to put it in
[21:01] another way Christ is the mystery of God
[21:05] revealed we have a book on that very
[21:08] subject and that's the title of it
[21:11] Christ The Mystery of God revealed you
[21:13] can go to on to our website which may be
[21:15] on the screen right now but if not we
[21:17] can put it on we'll put it on at the end
[21:19] of the screen and you'll see that the
[21:21] book will be available to you Christ is
[21:24] the mystery of God
[21:26] revealed now let's go into this same
[21:29] subject with some graphics and some
[21:32] illustrations and we are told by
[21:35] researchers that we
[21:38] remember much greater portion of what we
[21:41] see than actually what we hear so we're
[21:45] wanting to move now to a visual image so
[21:49] that you can see more about God and
[21:53] we'll just barely get started our time
[21:55] is almost up we told you that God is
[21:58] invisible but we have to show something
[22:00] on the screen rather than an invisible
[22:03] God so this light that you see on the
[22:05] screen represents the invisible God and
[22:08] in that invisible God were certain
[22:10] attributes desires things that were in
[22:13] him you remember in Colossians 1 it says
[22:16] everything was created by Him and for
[22:18] him so it was in him to be a judge it
[22:22] was in him to be a redeemer and if you
[22:25] think of each one of these that if he
[22:29] wants to Manifest this attribute to us
[22:33] then if he's going to be a redeemer
[22:36] someone has to be lost he wants to be
[22:38] believed we find that Adam and Eve
[22:40] stepped away from belief we find the
[22:42] early church stepped away from belief
[22:44] the the Jewish Church stepped away
[22:47] that's when then God turned to the
[22:49] Gentiles now he's working with us he in
[22:51] him is to be a Healer someone has to be
[22:53] sick in him is to be a guide someone has
[22:56] to be lost in him is to be a family
[22:59] catch that he's not going to create a
[23:02] family God is going to be a family for
[23:06] he's sharing his own eternal life so God
[23:09] in his family we can read about that in
[23:12] Corinthians 15 again he wants to be a
[23:14] comforter so consequently somebody has
[23:17] to be uncomfortable to need a comforter
[23:20] he wants to be a husband so there has to
[23:22] be a bride and we find that's the
[23:24] Gentile church he wants to be a savior
[23:27] someone has to be lost
[23:28] he wants to be a deliverer counselor
[23:31] provider Creator father King God
[23:34] Shepherd trusted and alsoo much more so
[23:37] therefore out of the mind of this great
[23:39] God comes a a a plan and unveiling
[23:43] through which we can learn more about
[23:46] him and learn about this invisible God
[23:49] so he makes a way for us to see this
[23:53] invisible
[23:54] God now out of God as he begins to man
[23:59] manifest himself out of God the
[24:01] materialization of God's thoughts comes
[24:04] this term in the Bible called the logos
[24:07] so the mind of God the attributes of God
[24:09] are now going to be expressed in word
[24:12] form this logos that comes out from God
[24:16] and we see this little looks like DNA
[24:18] floating around inside of this logos
[24:21] that's representing the attributes of
[24:23] God that are now that that now they've
[24:25] moved out of thought form coming into
[24:28] expression and then in moving into this
[24:31] expression we find that this logos is
[24:35] Christ and even the uh dictionary
[24:38] definitions and concordances will tell
[24:40] you the same Christ a theophany a body
[24:44] for Jehovah it is the anointing this is
[24:47] the son in a per figure remember father
[24:50] let them see me with the glory that I
[24:53] had with thee before the world was so
[24:56] the logos is Christ it's the anointed
[25:01] word here we got the Strong's
[25:03] Concordance definition down there logos
[25:05] equals something said including the
[25:08] thought and that part's important the
[25:10] logos something said including the
[25:13] thought and that the the Divine
[25:15] expression which is Christ so if we take
[25:18] God's word but change the thought we
[25:22] find that this attribute of God is no
[25:25] longer logos and now the logos of God is
[25:29] likened unto the germ that's in a seed
[25:33] in that the germ is what produces what
[25:37] the seed should reproduce so the thought
[25:39] of God placed into the word of God if
[25:43] not perverted will produce what God had
[25:46] in his mind but if we take that same
[25:51] word and add a different thought to it
[25:54] than what God had in his mind then the
[25:56] word can't produce prod what it's
[25:59] supposed to produce the classic example
[26:03] of that God calls his word a seed and
[26:07] every seed Genesis 111 has the ability
[26:10] to bring forth of its own kind God's
[26:15] word is a seed so if we hybrid a natural
[26:18] seed we mix it with something else now
[26:22] the end product is not uh easily
[26:27] determined the hybrid product can now
[26:30] produce an offshoot mixed with the
[26:33] original but not bringing forth after
[26:35] its own kind and I fear friends of mine
[26:39] that All Through the Ages man has
[26:41] concocted many things that have been
[26:44] injected into the word of God to hybrid
[26:48] it and that's why we don't see produced
[26:51] by the Church of the Living God what God
[26:54] is calling for because it has an
[26:57] injection in into it of man's thoughts
[27:00] man's Creeds man's dogmas that has
[27:04] killed the effect of the word of God so
[27:06] we do not see Christ on display as we
[27:09] ought come back with this next session
[27:12] friends we're going to continue on this
