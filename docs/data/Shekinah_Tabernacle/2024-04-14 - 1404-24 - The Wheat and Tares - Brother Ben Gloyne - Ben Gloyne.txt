========================================
[Music] amen it's good to good to be here one day Bruce you be up here opening in [Music] prayer think [Music] about 11 12 13 years ago I gave Bruce a Bible and I said I think you you you're better

possible that we could actually have the outpouring of the Holy Ghost and not receive any for ourselves if we don't open our heart and receive it you know we could it could be all around us but we

amen there's none like him amen promised us you'd never leave us nor forsake us he's a present help in time of trouble amen we're surrounded by his angels by his great presence amen praise the Lord thanks brother Isaac thank you musicians amen God bless you all great to have everyone here today everyone happy amen praise the Lord great to have so many visitors God bless you amen trust you feel at home amen we just love the Lord around here it's what we do so praise the Lord let's um let's go to the scripture amen um who enjoyed Wednesday I enjoyed Wednesday what an amazing presence and what a glorious time so amen really enjoyed that amen let's um we're going to go to um I want to go to First Peter 3 and verse 1-4 um just this I'm not talking about dress well I'm talking about a greater dress wear of the Holy Ghost so I'm not talking about natural dress wear you read this some people go like this no don't I'm not talking about that I'm talking about a greater dressing greater adornment amen so he says here likewise you wives be in subject to your own husbands that if any obey not the word they also May without the word be won by the conversation of the wives while they behold your Chase conversation coupled with fear whose adoring let it not be that outward adoring uh adorning sorry of plating the hair and of wearing of gold or putting on of apparel but Let It Be The Hidden man of the heart and that which is not corruptible even the ornament of a Meek and quiet Spirit which is in the sight of God of great price if God puts a great price on something I think that's an important thing to possess amen so let's just bow our heads in a word of prayer this morning amen let's go before the throne of grace and prayer gracious Lord Jesus how thankful we are we can truly say from the bottom of our hearts there is none like you Lord we love you with all our hearts today we thank you we can be gathered this morning Under The Shadow of Your Great wings and we just want to ask that you would touch every life Lord Jesus may we leave these when when it's all said and done the final dismissal song is sung and all Lord we go to lunch or go our separate ways may we leave more like you change renew closer to you dear God may you grant it father we ask that you would take every Spirit under your control For Your Glory may you have the prence in our lives in this service we just want to commit Our Lives into your hands be with those who couldn't be here today be their portion Lord we thank you so much we can commit all things into your hands in Jesus Christ's name amen amen amen God bless you friends you can have your seats uh this morning so I want to talk about the want to keep this thought about the uh anointed bride body of Jesus Christ but I want to talk about what we're dressed in because I I honestly believe with all my heart if you could really see what God has dressed you in already that you're already if you have been filled with the Holy Ghost you're Rapture Ready amen you're ready to meet your king amen there's nothing that is out of you are ready amen it doesn't matter if you're asleep or awake or happy sad mad or glad amen when that moment comes to dead in Christ raise your body's going to be change so I think if we could look at life with such a confidence amen that God has made us ready amen I think I think we could just go rejoicing no matter what circumstance we're in whatever trouble's going on in life amen we can still lift up our heads and rejoice amen so you know it's amazing when you look at through the scripture I just wanted to start with this here about how how the um uh the Lord is saying this this adornment of a Meek and quiet spirit is a a a sight of uh in the sight of God is is of great price so so you know God is saying it's the inner man that matters you know sure what's on the inside manifest on the outside we know all those things but you know you can dress the part you can play the part you can say the right things but yet still be stuck on the Earth when the Rapture happens but if you truly know him amen you are ready so you know as it as it says in Revelations 19 and and from verse 6 I heard as it were the voice of of a great multitude as it was the voice of many Waters and as the voice of a mighty thundering saying Allelujah for the Lord God omnipotent reth let us be glad and rejoice and give honor to him for the marriage of the Lamb has come and his wife had made herself ready and to her was granted this is how she made herself ready see the legalists want to say now what must I do well what's given to you to put on Amen which is the word of God Amen the baptism of the Holy Ghost and to her was granted that she should be ar raay and fine linen clean and white for the fine linen is the righteousness of saints and he saith unto me write blessed are they which are called unto the marriage supper of the lamb and he saith unto me these are the true sayings of God am mean so if you've been called to the marriage supper of the Lamb you're a blessed person amen today now through the scripture there's always been a change in clothing amen it's very important see when men fa and they you know you know they fail and they realized they were naked they tried to make some clothing they tried to make a dress in order to be presentable when God would come because they knew God came down every evening they had church every night God would come down in the cool of the evening and he would have fellowship with his with his children saying how wasn't in the Garden today and they' say father it was so wonderful and you know he would they would Express to him everything they did and you know all the fellowship they would have and but they came a a a different evening where instead of being being robed in eternal life amen they were found clothed in fig leaves because so man has always tried to dress themselves to come into the presence of God but as soon as the voice of God came walking through the garden they realized their dress wasn't going to cut it I mean it wasn't going to meet their needs and it's the same thing with religion friends see it's so important we come into the presence of God Amen where where if we're falling short God will show us amen we don't need to guess anything if we're really sincere and and and genuine before God God will show us things God will show us what we need to get rid of or or or lay his feet amen God will show us that we're ready amen God you know brings stability he brings you know peace into our hearts but you see they realized that they were not dressed right and so God had to dress them and the first account of an animal ever being slain was was God killing a lamb to to to clothe his children and God would God would wrap them in that Covenant amen and say I'm going to undo what has happened this say I'm going to dress you right one day Hallelujah and I'm so thankful we're not looking forward for this dress where to come it's here amen the bride has made herself ready amen by by by by being being robed in what they were robed in before they fell we're been robed in it amen the baptism of the Holy Ghost amen so God God is always you know we we need to be dressed right Hallelujah and he's given us the right clothing to be dressed in amen now Jesus would tell a parable Jesus would tell a parable of a king inviting people to a great wedding supper feast and there was a man who came to the feast and when the king came out he wasn't dressed right right now these are just the words um um Christine was in Switzerland many years ago and and and and the Lord inspired to speak this to one of her relatives because they saying they're a good person and the and and and the Lord said you cannot get into heaven through the window of your good works that's right right you cannot see see this man was dressed strong and when the king came out he said friend why are you here without a wedding garment and the Bible says he was speechless he had no answer he had no way to justify now on Earth everyone has a justification you know the people who are liberal will say well she'll be right God understands me I'll be refined his blood's more than sufficient but without letting it change their lives or the legalist will say well I've done this I do this right I say this I dress this way this is how things they're trying to get into heaven through the window of their good works and Friends you'll be disint pointed on that day if you're trying to earn something with God saying well I was raised in the message I believe the message you know the devil believes this message you know the Bible says you believe in one God you do well the devil also believes and trembles am mean so just saying having a profession of Faith ain't going to do it amen no what you believe must be manifested in you amen that's that's absolutely Paramount amen now I trust we're okay this morning but you see see we will not be if we are not if we don't go through the door of Jesus Christ will not be dressed right to meet the king amen but it's on this side we get dressed right amen God's prepared all things for us amen amen to to be ready see this man was not adorned right he wasn't dressed right and so when the king came he got Thrust out of the thrust out of the feast now see it was this man he was speechless he couldn't say nothing and he was the bridegroom ordered him to be bound and cast into outer Darkness but he had uh but he had got in there all right now what did that indicate either he might have come in a window or come in the back door or he had come through some other way besides the provided way and he was cast out and there is a provided way today and it isn't by our Creeds or by any other thing but by Jesus Christ he is the way and the man comes to God through Jesus Christ receives the Holy Ghost and is robed just like the rest of them that comes rich or poor made all made alike no one can enter in only by him praise the Lord I'm so glad he's provided dress wear amen for you and I this morning amen so this this scripture here where it says to be adorned with a Meek and a quiet Spirit now the word meek you many people especially in this day you know people want superheroes or a super church or a super leader or a super military or super everything's got to be super in this day can't be average can't be subpar it's got to be super super super and people view meekness as a weakness people misunderstand people think weakness is are just pushed around and you know you're just like a tumble weed just get pushed around no that's not real meekness meekness is really associated with with humility and humility is a is a um sadly a very forgotten thing in this day but the power of God comes by humility amen it doesn't come by pride pride or arrogancy or self-sufficiency it comes by humility so this so this uh Meek spirit is is of great price with God so you look at the Lord Jesus you know you the Prophecies of him coming you know he was you know Isaiah would see that every Mountain will be made low and every low Place made High and the you know Mountains will clap their hands and all you I mean the mountains will skip like Rams and the leaves will clap their hands and all these things so no doubt when I when when John the Baptist was standing there you know he was preaching that this Messiah is going to come he's going to thoroughly purges floor he's going to you you know you know fan away all the chaff and do incredible things and here came the Fulfillment of the of the prophecy a Meek humble lowly Man From Galilee amen if you never knew who he was I doubt he could yeah yeah I believe he could just walk through a crowd and people wouldn't know who he was he looked like everyone else he was you know you you he only had one change of garment or you I think he only had the one change he was wearing you know he wasn't wealthy no place to lay his head but yet amen he was a Creator himself he was God made flesh the one who spoke the world into existence the one who prophesied he would come the one who gave life the one who you know you made made a way back to back to himself the very God who made all things yet he came the most humblest lowly Meek way hallu amen and it bypassed it bypassed all the proud The Arrogant the people who thought they had it all together it bypassed all those what did you and he stooped yet he became the lowest but he still reached out in his hand for me Hallelujah Lord amen so what man calls great God calls foolish but what God calls great man calls foolish see we want to we want to have our mind the same as God's mind I mean we never want to step over greatness so you look at you know you know Christian I were talking about it the other day you know you know brother Brandon if he was alive today or we were back in his day and you didn't know who he was do you think he would tell you who he was I'm Malachi 4 I'm Elijah I'm I've got the Capstone revelation of the word you know I'm here to turn the hearts of the people back I've got this great ministry do you think he would have been boasting about those things sir no you would have had he you would have said he's a nice sweet humble guy amen friendly good to talk to but you see yet Prophet messenger for the age amen but yet lowly Kian you know humble man amen why because humility brings the power of God it's not how much we shout and dance and scream and things all those things are fine but if it's not with a humble heart it's just a bunch of noise amen I believe in noisy times absolutely but there's got to be humility which has got to underp it all amen that we've got to trust in God that God must do it amen you know humility is being able to surrender to the word of God Amen and really let him live so you see these things here so so to be quiet now many people maybe are reading this maybe thought well quiet just means you don't say that's not what it means you know it means keeping one seat so you're fixed I'm serving the lord I'm walking with God I'm here Lord fulfill your word in my life be glorified in my life Lord I'm a Christian on my worst day I'm a Christian on my best day I'm still a Christian the world is falling apart I'm still a Christian everything's all together I'm still a Christian amen this is the thing that I'm fixed on this is my seat at the table God has called me here I am amen and that come to me the Lord says I'll no wise cast out so Lord I'm on your hands I'm your problem Lord Jesus Hallelujah so that's really what it means amen see it's one that is undisturbed or undisturbed you see sometimes people have a lot of problems and the and the common denominator in their problems is them so sometimes we got to look at where the where the three other fingers are pointing and say maybe maybe I'm the I'm the common denominator in this equ maybe if it's if I go subtract me plus God then no problem there is not a math lesson but you know don't carry any fives just but but it's simple none of him sorry none of me and all of him amen that's how it should be so but you see some are very disturbing they cause trouble they C and and it's not good trouble doesn't stir up to good works it just destabilizes causes Strife in a bad way but you see those who are both amen you see we've got to have more than just the right doctrin amen if the devil told the truth he would say it's all true but he's not saved he's not born again that's why it says in Titus here not purloining but showing all good Fidelity that they may Adorn the doctrine of God our savior in all things for the grace of God that bringeth salvation hath appeared to all men so this doctrine's got to be adorned there's got to be a life that really proves you know you know when people see your life they should ask you well what do you believe what's different about you because they should be able to look Beyond maybe how you dress maybe how you talk and say there's something there there's something different in this person something different in this family and sure they say they're Christians but but what is it what denomination are you none I'm part of a kingdom I was born into a kingdom amen the kingdom of God Amen so so the doctrine of God must be adorned with a good character it's got to be adorned with a with a life that is not just not just saying one thing and doing the other that's a bad adornment amen a good adornment is a person who's a person of their word if they're wrong they're wrong if they made a mistake they say it if they've you know said one thing and they can't do it they'll say they can't do it you know who's with me today amen amen so this is this is how we must be to so so the doctrine of God must be adorned amen showing you know showing all good Fidelity now this word per purloining sorry if you don't mind all the uh definitions but it means to to set apart to divide to embezzle to to keep back now we don't want to be as Paul say don't be poining don't keep things back and what and and what does that really mean you know to separate for oneself or to embezzle withdraw covetly it's to you know to appropriate for one's own use what that really is is to do something and appear to be more spiritual than you really are that's really what pining is because because the only time this word poining is used in the scripture apart from there is in Acts chapter 5 where anas and Safara they sold their land and they but they only gave part of it to the disciples the bad thing wasn't that they kept part of it for themselves that wasn't the bad part the bad part was they secretly did it and and professed to the church we've we've sold it this is the entire price so they appeared to be more spiritual than they really were that was pining and we know what happened to them they ended it 6t under because they lied to the Holy Ghost so if they just said look we sold it for this much we were keeping this much for ourselves they wouldn't be no issue but they're appearing to be more see they're advertising that they're more spiritual than they really were look at this great big sacrifice we doing look at this big thing that I'm doing if that were just honest it would have been would not have been a problem am we don't want to be like that but you see those who are meek and humble they don't go advertise who they are they don't don't try and project what God has made them to be the life within them lives and proves itself hallelujah amen so we're called to change reignment we're all born in the wrong clothes I'm not talking about Nike edites whatever your brand is I'm not talking about that guy I'm talking about spiritual clothing we're all born in the wrong clothing right we needed to be because you know this this age God would say it's naked miserable rich and blind and don't know it now I've never seen in my life not that I've looked but I haven't seen someone who's naked and blind and think they're fine naturally you know even a blind man who's naked knows he's naked naturally but this world has got to such a condition that it doesn't realize that it's not dressed at all that's right you see and so we don't want to go along in life and just think everything's fine but are we clothed have we really met the Lord this is really the question have we really met him well I haven't had thunder lightning but as he changed your heart has God done a work have you seen you can look back in your life once I was a sinner I didn't care about nothing and I was trying to do all my Shady deals and whatever more and live you know just all kind of trouble going on but then one day he came and I surrendered my life and he became not my parents God no more he became my God and His word became everything to me amen so so that's how you know you've really put on some new clothes Hallelujah because it says here King James it says for as many of you has been baptized into Christ has put on Christ uh contemporary English version says and when you were baptized it was though you had put on Christ in the same way you put on new clothes Hallelujah and I'll say when you put on this robe you can't take it off and you're actually part of the clothes you can't see see you can see there's you can see where the shirt is and where my skin starts right but this robe you can't see there's no there's no Gap hallelujah hallelujah because you are part of the clothes you you begin to realize this word fits me just right amen this message fits me real good amen it's tailored and I've been shaped amen so it fits me real good like Elisha when he was called by Elijah you know Elijah threw his mantle upon him that's right it didn't fit him just right so what happened is Elisha followed Elijah till they came to the Jordan after I don't know how many years amen Elijah was taken up in a Rapture right that same robe fell upon Elisha Elisha put it on hey this fits different now yeah what not that the mantle had been changed to to to match Elisha no Elisha was changed to fit the mantle it's the same thing with the word of God we don't want to change the word of God to fit us oh no oh no a True Believer wants God change me if I've got to lose a few pounds Lord I'm going to lose a few pounds I got a few pounds of malice Strife Envy Pride you know whatever it is arrogancy bullying whatever it is in me Lord if I've got to shed those take it off oh God hallelujah and you know what's wonderful about it you don't have to jump on a treadmill you don't have to work it off there's a gospel you take amen and it just falls off amen am mean you repent give it to the Lord and you'll find it's gone Hallelujah then you can walk about how you should really walk about not encumbered by all those things trouble in your mind all the time Hallelujah so this is a different kind of a and then what did he say he said and then Elisha said now where is the god of Elijah he took that same mantle smoke the same river and the same things happen Hallelujah and you look at the church of you know of the Living God today amen the same things that Jesus did we do he does through US rather the same Miracles the same power why because he's the same godah now here's a question what's that is it wheat is it only wheat now you can see we can't really see it but there's some there's some weeds up here the green ones that's obviously weeds but are they the only weeds in that field no there's tears in that field do you know how you tell what a do you know do you know how they can tell what a tear is it's when they both become the corn and the wheat become mature guess one guess which one doesn't bow the tear doesn't bow you see they can look the same sure if you examine you know there's um seed labs and things that examine seeds and so on they can tell them but when it's growing you can't necessarily tell so these ones who are sticking up that ain't wheat the ones that are bowing that's wheat amen so what does that got to do with you and I well On's the bow are worshiping what and when you see someone worshiping where does the attention go not the worshipper but the object of worship Hallelujah you see so ones who are really bowing who are really wheat they've really got dressed right they're bowing that in their life you don't see them you see Christ you see the word put on flesh amen but the tear look at me come under my shadow how many times have we been troubled by Tears I'm talking about SP I'm not talking about serpent SE things necessarily today I'm talking about anointings amen where people see see all that field enjoys the same weather enjoys the same Sunshine enjoys the same meetings enjoys the same camp enjoys the same prayer meetings enjoys the same message both of them amen right but one is bowing one is standing right and then but then Jesus said of course wait till the Harvest time then a separation is going to take place now I'm not calling anyone a tear here okay let's just let's just get that across oh he's calling me a tear no we're born we're all born tears Hallelujah we needed a change of clothing amen because we're all born lost Judas was born lost Peter was born lost the only difference is one went to Pentecost and got a change of reignment Amen praise the Lord Lord amen you say well predestinated seed absolutely but you know there's got to be a manifestation of that but you know you see so so the ones that bow they're weat the ones that don't bow they are tears see this is why the tears are not humble they will not they want to be the object of worship they want to be the main main thing they want to be you like brother Brown would say you'd see advertisements for meetings and he asked God God are the people coming to see the man or you and even asked about his own Ministry in those same kind of ways are we here to worship a minister or we here to worship God are we here to worship you know man or The God man the Lord Jesus Christ you see so so if we are born if we have been born again truly born again yeah there ain't any tear there is no desire to be known there's no desire to be a main part in history the days of big Ministries are over it's now body work right it's a different season see there was Caleb and there was Joshua and sure they had their part and taking the promised land but there was many unseen ones that fought the battles and took their inheritance right and we're living in that season the previous season was fine but we're living in a different season amen where the whole body is now advancing amen growing amen because we know now that it's see if you have the Holy Ghost in you you'll believe God you'll love God act like a Christian that's right it isn't see if it isn't you know them by the fruits they Bear by the fruits they bear that's how you know them so we can look at this feel and say well the ones standing up they're not humble they're not Meek they're not lonely because remember if Christ the head was meek and lowly yeah how much more you and I amen how much more his body upon the Earth amen none of us should be stuffed shirts thinking we're something the only thing we can boast in is the Lord amen he's the worthy one he's the great one Among Us amen it's not it's not any other Ministry or not any Min not even a church it's him amen he's the important one he's the man of the hour he's the messenger of the hour brother Braham says the Holy Ghost is the prophet of the hour amen do we de deviate to something else no we stay with the word but he is the mighty one who are we going to worship on that wedding supper day him Hallelujah whose Throne are we dancing around him but you see the devil wants his own throne and he has it in this day and he cannot understand humility because he's not made to be humble he's not made to be meek he's not made to be lowly cuz he's proud and arrogant he's lifted himself up saying look how great I am look how great y people are people are so y The Cult of celebrity is so strong in this day people want to be a seley they want they want worship you look at the great artists of the day they are worshiped they are like deities in flesh people think you know and so what has happened is that luciferian Spirit has come down into humanity and it's fully expressing itself now if that's the case for the tears what about the wheat what about the wheat Hallelujah because many times we say well the well the tears are mature look at the world what about the bride what about you and I the person you're looking in the mirror you say well I'm not ready no you're a lot reader than you think you are am mean you're a lot more mature than you realize amen praise God Amen huj Hallelujah because you got to realize if the Rapture happened in this moment you got to realize hey I got matured Hallelujah I'm golden green all the greenness of my Humanity was baked out of me the things I once wrestled with they've gone and now I've just God's brought me higher and higher with him amen and and what causes the maturity the atmosphere am mean it's the season live in amen it's not a we're not living in a winter season this is not a picture of a of a snow covered field and and and I can say there's Wheat Field you wheat seed in there you say sure there is sure but no it's not under the ground it's come out amen it's living out of you and I I trust you you're looking at me saying yes amen yes God's doing a work in my life yes he's making me more like him yes he's bringing stability in my life yes the trouble seem less Troublesome cuz I realize the god that's with me is far greater than the trouble like like Elisha you know you know he was in Doan there you know in the city and then you know his servant you know gazi whoever it was brother brah says when to take the milk bottles out in the morning we don't do those things anymore but you know and then he panics because he sees the Assyrian army gathered around the city he says basically to Elisha we're toast we can't get out and you know Elijah just prays god open his eyes his prayer did not bring the angels of heaven down no his eyes just his prayer caused his eyes open to realize who was already there and if we could realize in another dimension the angels are here God is here not to condemn you but to say you're my child ien you're actually wheat in my field amen you're not a tear you're part of me amen this is why you mature this is why you feel the way you feel or the way you think your desire is you want more of him why because you're part of him amen and when I see a field of tears and wheat I just see me as a wheat Hallelujah because when I realized God you found me you saved me you redeemed me I wasn't looking for you but are looking for me you found me you washed me you delivered me from many evil unclean spirits I realized Lord what else can I do but bow what else can I do I say thank you Jesus what else can I do but say Lord you are the worthy one amen cuz he has dressed us that when we'll see that great king we're going to go to the city that great king Hallelujah I'm looking forward to that moment aren't you friends amen hallelujah hallelujah amen you see the gospel glows in humility and meekness and humbleness and power you're powerful people this morning I don't I don't know if you realize but you you're more powerful than all the armies combined in this world and in hell you're a very powerful person amen your prayers can turn this world upside down if God Leed you to pray that way amen if God Leed you to pray that way you could create your own private world go live on it with the power that's within you already amen you could do it if God LED you to do it hallelujah amen why because we are the redeemed bride body of Jesus Christ now I just want you to see this here that many times people take this word peculiar they think we're a strange people and in a sense we are to the world we're odd balls we are the rebels as brother Jimmy preached a few Sundays ago I mean we're Rebels against Babylon we are the quirky group but this word peculiar doesn't mean that way cuz people get on their mind or the devil gets it on their mind we're strange we're funny we're going to have to stick out like a sore thumb no the world sticks out like a sore thumb amen we are the only a Believer that's got the Holy Ghost has a sound mind amen we are see never put on your children that what there a burden you got to Bear you got to be this way and it's hard no there should be such a joy I get to serve God I get another day to be a Christian I get another day say thank you Jesus and pray and and walk with the Lord this is this is a glorious life amen hallelujah is it easy not always but it's glorious amen hallelujah you know what I mean so let's not look at the negative let's look at the positive I'm a I'm a seed in his field I'm a wheat am amen so this word peculiar it means an acquisition you're being acquired amen amen amen by extension sorry extension a preservation you're a preserved people amen you've been obtained amen you've been purchased you are possessed by the Lord Jesus Christ and you are saved Hallelujah I like that don't you amen so you're not just no you're not a funny people no no you're preserved Jesus Christ you're saved amen you're his possession Hallelujah that's a glorious thing I think amen hallelujah that he would call us in robust in his righteousness now Hallelujah so saying the gospel glows in humility meekness and humbleness and power amen while Hollywood shines and everything everybody Haring and hollering and going to it see we don't need that now he's not saying we we don't need a shouting noisy service he's not saying that but he's saying that you know just Haring and shouting and who's ever seen like well you all have Christian music in this day it's It's Entertainment it's not worship easy contemporary what even oldfashioned stuff it's it's a worship of the Artist as opposed to a worship of God you see and that's why it says Hollywood shines that shines that's shiny false gold shines real gold glows amen F's gold is iron pyate there's no gold in it right we don't want to be fools gold we want to have the real gold that shines of deity of the Holy Ghost within us amen so the gospel glows there's a warmth that's with it there's a love that goes out there's a humility there's a you know there's a joy there's a presence there's a refreshing amen there's not a tenseness and a nervousness and a trouble you we may see if you come to church trouble that's fine but I believe that God does the work that when you leave you don't feel trouble you forget your trouble right cuz God reassures you once again everything's okay I'm with you in the battle amen you're not going to be defeated cuz I've already won hallelujah amen your strength Cometh From Me Remember the joy of the Lord is our strength Hallelujah so this gospel has power now you got to realize if you're a Christian today you're a powerful person amen because you have within you you are robed Hallelujah and a dress from Heaven amen that the devil didn't give you and he can't take from you amen God has given you a faith that the devil can't take from you and you are walking in the shiniest world there's ever been Satan's Eden Hallelujah and there's nothing in you that wants it amen glory see to me that's an incredible thing God put you in this world am mean to walk in this world and not want this world but just to want him that's a supernatural thing you got to realize you're a supernatural people this morning amen because you've been given a revelation amen of Jesus Christ and you're walking in this world look Adam and Eve fell in Eden and here as a bride God says to Satan look I'll put them in in the worst time and she will not fall like Eve did amen because she is ordained not to fall Hallelujah that's incredible thing you say God's not doing anything in my life you need to change you need to put on some spiritual glasses amen he's kept you from a lot of things the devil came into your mind tried to trouble you God kicked them out amen you want to go your own way do human things God says no this is the way you should go I mean you've been preserved and kept in many different ways and I believe that when we get to the other side there's going to be uh well there's going to be Hallelujah and glories then when God really unfolds what he kept us from it's just going to be a wow Hallelujah isn't that right you say he's not doing God's doing a lot he's working 24/7 on your case amen he's dispatched his angels to watch to to to keep charge over you amen Psalms 91 that scripture Belongs to You amen that you'll tread on the adder and the Young Lion and the serpent Hallelujah that the angels have kept charge over you that you won't your foot against a stone Hallelujah that's you amen you're walking in this world but you're not alone Hallelujah I like that don't you he we got to realize we're power God has not made us some empty little woman with nothing no we're endured with power from on high amen but it's sh but it glows in a meekness and a humility amen hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah it's not not not not self advertisement not China because remember these signs shall follow them that believe Amen to the life of the wheat the signs follow that life it's very different you take David and Saul signs LED Saul Samuel said to him you find the donkeys here you go to these prophets you'll prophesy with them this will happen here this will happen here signs LED Saul yeah signs follow David amen David got anointed by by by the same Prophet then he killed the lion he killed the bear he killed Goliath amen why signs were following his life when he went to the battle with Goliath he wasn't looking for a fight that day his dad just said take this food to your brothers amen he was serving in his family living maybe another kind of a day but yet God anointed him Amen in his everyday life and he down that giant and they had a great Victory what signs followed David amen that's why the wheat doesn't look for all these signs no the still small voice of God leads the wheat amen we don't need to try and work out things and sure it's nice to see rainbows and number plates and all these things but no it should be the word of God leading you amen not all these different signs because Saul failed amen cuz what he was led by signs amen no David the signs followed David amen this is why this we got to realize we have authority to cast out Devils I mean there's no Spirit we should be afraid of Amen we shouldn't be troubled by nothing the devil try and intimidate you and push it in your face now you can stand flat footed say my God is my strength devil you've got an expiry date you've come to the wrong house you've come to the wrong life you've come to the wrong mind you're going to get a beating Hallelujah this is because we're endued with power from on high am mean we're not some weak see the devil wants you to think that your weapon is equivalent to his weapon last time I read the book of Revelation he still got a bow no arrows he's nothing but a bluff he can intimidate how like who's read I think it's even in the Ukraine war now but especially World War II they would make fake planes and fake tanks that the Germans or the Allies will come and they drop their bombs on these fake tanks and planes and they think man we just destroyed an air field it was a bunch of fake stuff and I think it's the same thing today what it's but it looks probably from the sky it looks intimidating look at all these weapons where' they get all these tanks from well they just got some 4X tws went to M 10 they made a tank and it's the same thing with the devil it can look so real but it's just a bit of 4X two I mean there's no gunpowder there's no missiles there's no armor there's nothing in it it's nothing but a bluff but if you're bluffed by his bluff then his bluff works sometimes I think he says oh I can't believe that one worked yeah right but if we really test what he has you'll see it's just wood amen so when the Devil comes in and you put it to the test say no my God said this the word says this it is written you're putting his bluff to a test and you'll find it's nothing but a bluff remember Satan has to move yes amen he has to move we cannot just put up with him we cannot just say well this is how life is going to be this is how they're going to be this is how I am forget it amen Peter thought he was a fisherman he wasn't a fisherman he was an apostle he was a fisher of men amen all the disciples Paul thought he was a Pharisee how wrong was that guy he was real wrong he realized he was wearing the wrong dress though the wrong clothes when he met the Lord on the road to Damascus but sometimes we think well this is just how life has to be they probably thought that too how wrong were they amen so we should never back up to the devil we should never put up with him never tolerate him say Satan you're going to move in the name of Jesus Christ you're going to get out this is this trial has an End Amen this is not how it has to be amen are you with me today hallelujah amen cuz these signs shall follow them that believe amen we are God Has Lifted us up above the enemy but it isn't strange when you think about that we have the answer to the world's problems we have we have what the world needs amen right but yet if the world had what we have do you think I think they would act quite differently well actually they wouldn't cuz they' be changed like us but what I'm trying to say is if they had the same product imagine if some pharmaceutical company had a serum that made eternal life that would be advertised everywhere right but it wouldn't be with meekness or humility amen because we know what we car in our hearts right but Lord lead us to share it with others Lord create an opening that I can speak and if I've said too much pride me that I'll stop right why because we greatness is humility don't forget that church greatness is expressed in humility not how fine you can be he says I don't mean dirty I don't but I mean humble and spirit see I don't mean just go out and don't ever wash and clean up uh that you should do that you know that see but I'm talking about humility genuine humility not something is put on something that is its real humility amen this is see greatness is humility Jesus the greatest man to ever walk the earth didn't even have a peer he is unmatchable but yet meek and lowly and yet he'd stand there at lazarus's grave and say I am the resurrection and the life Hallelujah and he didn't just say it he proved it yes amen it's the same thing with the bride we don't just say it we God proves it in our lives amen amen there's not just a advertising or a words it happens amen amen glory to God hallelujah that's right am mean you see brother Bram says he's been in the company of Great Men who think they're great yeah who who who who wear all the finest clothes Drive the nicest cars all these things they think they're great but but they great men who are really great make the other person feel they're great so a great person isn't the amount of money in the bank account whatever they have stature whatever no it's not that great people make other people feel great that's right Hallelujah so if you want to see someone who's truly humble a truly great person they should make you feel great amen now that's just not pouring on empty compliments no there should be an atmosphere around them how they talk to you putting you above them amen should it should make you feel great amen but you see we must have with with with humility true humility brings the right attitude true humility brings the right attitude you see someone who is legal or liberal you know that person's that way because they're annoyed at the other if someone's legal they're anointed a liberal person if someone's liberal they get annointed a legal person but if you have genuine humility you're clothed with the Holy Ghost you love everybody amen you love everybody right you may see them that way listen liberalism legalism they are both ditches on the side of the road it's time to get out of the trench Walk The King's Highway amen amen who hey if that person's doing that that person is doing that love them the same remember we were unlovable once but God found us he loved the unlovable I was unlovable this Bible says I was his enemy and he died for me amen so we should never if we're truly humble say Lord you loved me when I was unlovable surely I can love someone else the same way amen so we should never ever have the wrong attitude that's amen praise the Lord because you can never cast a devil out by the wrong attitude you can never do it doesn't matter how much you think you know how much you do know if you've got the wrong attitude if you're annoyed at that person see this is so to me this is so astounding you never cast out a devil by the wrong attitude it takes love to do that and love is the most powerful force there is in the world now if you notice a devil is always hate hate is of the devil and then and when people hate someone remember it's a terrible devil to despise or dislike you mustn't do that Amen to me that there is like a yeah if you despise or dislike someone yeah that's a terrible demon influencing your life so we should never dislike anyone oh they did this to me they did that to me when Jesus was on Calvary he had no ought he had no anger he had no resentment the very ones who put him on the cross was spitting on him making fun of him he said father forgive them they don't know what they do I mean they looked beyond he looked beyond he looked beyond what they were doing and said father forgive them the lordu he didn't despise them he didn't dislike them he loved them this is this is our King and we're part of him are are we not amen amen and I you I know I've said it before but it's a you know it's a strange thing when he said they don't know what they do because they planned it yeah yeah humanly they knew knew what they were doing but God looked beyond cuz like the Apostle Paul summed it up if they really knew he W who he was they would never have crucified the Prince of Life so we should never despise it's a terrible devil to despise or dislike we should just love everybody if you just if you despise anyone dislike and say Lord take me to Calvary again take it from me Lord I want to have love for my enemies love for my friends love for everyone no matter what they've done am mean I want the right attitude towards everyone that Lord in your in your timing if there's something wrong if if there's a spirit there or something Lord you can anoint me to cast it out Lord hallelujah just like I said about that teenage girl on the Solomon Island screaming her name was Satan and thrashing about and all those things and I was asking God God what can I do and then this love and compassion came over me for her cuz I realized she's just another Soul like me my Lord Jesus died for her too she you know we have the same category and then I prayed for then that thing left amen what it's love that does it amen it's not how much you shout not how much you scream you see brother BR on the platform people come up before him he he just speaks he says Satan now you leave Satan the angel of the Lord commissioned me in a cave to say if you can get the people to believe me amen then then nothing can stand before my prayers I believe the people believe now get out amen and those things left you see why it was love and compassion I said God give us a good dose of love and compassion Lord in this Dying World this world that's hard and polarized and you know this world is building up am me to to tear itself apart in the Great Tribulation you see all the resentment past hurts and pains and strife between peoples and Nations it's simmering it's simmering that's why the world's so fragmented there's hatred between groups and everything because when the Holy Ghost leaves those things will just burst out and it's going to be a chaos of a world with the nations are split nations are divided you think there's going to be civil war everywhere it'll be World War II is and amateur tribulation compared to what's coming upon the Earth but you see it's bubbling up bubbling up bubbling up people hatred everything online polarized this group and that group you're not for us you're against us all these things and it's going to burst open amen don't be caught up in nothing political don't be caught up in nothing that's going on in this world you stay with the Holy Ghost you stay with the love of God whatever you do because if you're caught up in those things amen you'll be dragged into the tribulation but if you walk with this word you go up into glory amen so don't dislike these things that engineered to dis make you dislike someone well those people are my people I've been oppressed they've been oppressed those things may all be true but don't be caught up in it you stand in the middle say no there's a better way Brethren the love of God is the way amen he's the only one that can men this world the Prince of Peace is what this world needs amen it's not trying to write wrongs and whatever more yeah that's right amen no amen see the Jews back before Titus butchered Jerusalem you go read about that that was a horrible thing that happened there but you see imagine being a believer in those days being a Jewish believer and there's a big because it a it a political religious move to get rid of Rome yes and then now you've got a next door neighbor he doesn't see like you see he hasn't had a Pentecost like you've had he still believes in the blood of bulls and goats but yet you still get along or maybe he's even a Christian but he hasn't got the Holy Ghost yet and he goes to a political religious rally Rabbi Sono preached to us the other night we're going to get rid of these Romans we're going to we're going to our faith is going to bring the Messiah down because when we kick him out and purify the temple he's going to come to his Temple twisting the word and then but but we look at him say no that's not right that's right say what do you mean it's not right you're a Jew I'm a Jew we're in the same tribe you should stand with us what a Temptation look what the Romans did to your family look what they did to your brother look what they did to your uncle look what they've done to us as a nation you must stand with us yeah what a pressure yeah but you see that man who's got the Holy Ghost would say no I love the Romans how can you love them they're murderers they're brutal they're barbaric look what they've done to us we're going to Revenge we're going to get our Vengeance on them no but the love of God is controlling see his life is a worship it's not a tear sticking up saying we're going to do this no it's a surrendered life am me his life is reflecting of the one who redeemed him so then when Titus besieged the city the first time they lifted The Siege that man ran for the hills cuz he knew the prophecy of Jesus had to be fulfilled yeah you see but then when Titus came the third time no one escaped that's right it was a they were butchered that is going to happen on the World level yes yes they got caught in the city because they were caught up in a religious political move amen don't be caught up in that stuff don't be caught up in that stuff our lord Jesus was was rejected in this age right that's why the world's gone into a chaos walk out with him walk with him don't worry about anything else going on in the world social media is designed to divide right it's it's designed to divide you scroll for an hour what do you get out of it why do it I realized the other day Facebook's boring social media is actually boring why do you go on YouTube I list say that'll bless me am I'm looking for things to bless me I'm not looking for things to fill my time that's right amen you see so there's a reason it's not just stay away from it like a no legalist no stay with the word Spirits travel on those things to get your attention to put you into a false reality amen amen amen people want to live in a false reality why don't we live in the real one why don't we live in the one where there's a real God there's a real heaven we're going to there's a real wedding supper we're going to enjoy and we have all that and we can walk with God on this side amen we can see his word be fulfilled we can see his power see his glory be in his presence hallelujah hallelujah amen we don't just have some dead religion we have a living God Amen who really does save and redeem hallelujah hallelujah thank you Lord Amen brother I know put this up on his WhatsApp I thought that is brilliant love makes you do things and when the church gets the real love of God in their heart they'll do things they won't be ashamed oh Christ don't want you to be it isn't so much to be loyal he doesn't want your patronage he wants your fellowship that's what God wants is to have fellowship with you so people say well I'm loyal to the word and I'm standing true for the word that's all fine but if there's no love in there it's just going through a form right or patronage I pay my ti I come to church all those things are fine but without the real love of God motivating you you see someone who has the real love of God to me that's the third PLL right someone who really takes the whole word of God and they genuinely love the Lord that is the third po of manifestation because brother Braham the angel the Lord told Brother Bram the third pole cannot be impersonated see you people can try and impersonate saying well I keep the word I believe everything all these things but without the love of God in their souls to motivate them it's just an impersonation yeah that's right right so to me this is the third pull you really love the Lord with all your heart well brother said well it's not love no but there's love in it what's your what's your motivating factor yeah Lord you called me I want to you want to walk with me I want to walk with you I want to have fellowship with you Lord amen I'm in your field your sun is shining upon me amen I want to you've robed me in your righteousness now let's walk together amen see God could not walk with Adam and Eve with a fig Leaf garment that's right he dressed them to walk with them hallelujah what about in this day we're not we are robed in the baptism of the Holy Ghost amen hallelujah hallelujah amen let's just let's just go back to let's just go back to this shall we we'll close the wheat is mature amen amen the wheat is mature you're in that field you're not a tear you may be struggling but you're not a tear you may be having a hard life but you're not a tear you may be having a lot of trouble in your life but you're not a tear amen you're a wheat amen you're a wheat amen now we know that uh 50 days after um the Passover which is Pentecost there was the there was the uh Feast of the first fruits where the you know where where the mature part of the field will be cut down a section of it and the priest would be given it and it'll be waved before the Lord and they'll be thanking God the rest of the field is going to come into the same maturity right because grain natural natural uh fruit and everything grain it matures at different levels it's not one day it's green next day it's all golden some parts are more gold than the others but it's all as long as that life is there it's growing up right so now now Christ we know was that wave sheath amen that was waved over the people I just want you to see you got to look at when we see the word I trust you see you amen I trust you see you amen amen when you read the Old Testament when you read Joshua you see you when you see Caleb you see you when you see David you see you when you see the Mighty Men you see you when you see Ruth you see you when you see Esther you see you amen when you see Moses you see you do you see you amen when you see the prophets Elijah you see yourself on that when you come into the New Testament you see you what is that because that was just part of the word growing but now it's in full manifestation so you can see yourself in the whole Bible amen but he says this look he was plucked up from the earth and is waved over the people oh what a glorious Lesson by the quickening power of the first one although he had been typed and many times as we'll see later that he was typed but this was really the first fruit of them that slept he was waved over the promised seed that had promise of life amen so you were lying in the field one day but you had a promise of life thank you Lord hallelujah you had promise of life God wanted to fellowship with you God wanted to know you in the you know that you would know him in the power of his resurrection what happened is that he himself was waved the Holy Spirit was waved over you you came into the prince of God you came in contact with God one time maybe you heard a sermon maybe you read the Bible heard a tape I don't know what happened now that was his anointing being waved over you and God brought you to life and now you can see what what you've come under you're becoming amen what you're becoming like him amen you're becoming why it's matching time as he was Meek and humble so the bride is Meek and humble as he was lowly so we are lonely amen as as he loves so we love why because all the of the humanity is going away and he is coming in like never before hallelujah hallelujah amen as the gospel shined no as the gospel glowed in power in him it glows in power in you Hallelujah why because it's now matching time amen praise the Lord amen hallelujah I think amen so listen I'll just say this if you're trying to gather attention to yourself if you're trying to be the the big shot if you want evone to come under your influence go get a change of garment amen amen get a change of garment let him robe you in the in his holy ghost that you'll be bowed down become a wheat amen amen don't go through life

let's just walk with God he wants your fellowship amen love makes you do things what does it make you do forgive amen let go let go of past hurts and pains Amen Let Go of ill feelings that's what love makes you do that's what happen with Jesus on the cross amen when the church gets the real love of God in their heart you say how do I know I have that real love well what's happening in here something happens against you do you hold it do you put it in that memory file for five years down the road well F and when you get the chance to really let it out or do you just let it go amen say Lord they didn't mean that amen that's Lord forgive them you forgave me Lord you forgive them lord it's okay Lord Jesus glory to Lord is that is that how you do yes sir or or do you like holding grudges grudges are nasty things I mean it's like carrying a bucket of dog poo or something yeah that's what a grudge is gossip srid what's a just nasty stuff man you know why don't you trade that for a trade that for a different robe today instead of being clothed by all those things don't be this guy oh but but but but no no no the thief on the cross had the worst life he ended up on the cross next to Jesus that was God's ordained path for him to walk because in the moment he needed it he got eternal life amen you say well that's not fear I think if that th he's going to well actually we're going to meet him someday but if he could stand here and he could give his testimony the first part would be like oo you did that you shouldn't say that in church brother you did that did this but then when he gave the account of when he looked again cuz he railed on Jesus like the other Thief but then he looked again and then he told the other Thief we deserve to be here he has done nothing wrong he looked at Jesus said Remember Me Lord when you come into your kingdom amen now you'd ask well do you regret the life you lived he'd said no don't you see where I've ended up don't you see what God has done for me Hallelujah it was worth it all all the pain rejection hurt misery prison beatings whatever more under threat of death that was worth it cuz I saw him in my day now how about
