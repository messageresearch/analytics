Let's um let's just uh go to the scripture this morning. Um we want to go to Psalm 63. Amen. Trust everyone's all warm by the fire of the presence of God. Feeling good. Amen. Praise the Lord. I'm feeling pretty good. &gt;&gt; Amen. So Psalm 63 and uh verses 1-7. Okay, is everyone there? Maybe I'm the last one to get there. Amen. So, Psalm 63:1-7. Oh God, thou art my God. Early will I seek thee. My soul thirsteth for thee. My flesh longeth for thee in a dry and thirsty land where no water is. To see thy power and thy glory. So have I seen thee in the sanctuary. because thy loving kindness is better than life. My lips shall praise thee. I mean, thus will I bless thee uh while I live. I will lift up my hands in thy name. My soul shall be satisfied as with marrow and fatness, and my mouth shall praise thee with joyful lips. When I when I remember thee upon my bed, and meditate on thee in the night watches, because thou hast been my help, therefore, in the shadow of thy wings will I rejoice. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen. So, let's just approach the Lord in prayer this morning. We have one prayer request. Omar Robin has pneumonia, so we want to pray for her. If you have a need, just want to slip your hand up, say, "Lord, remember me at this time." Amen. Let's pray. Almighty God, we're so thankful, Lord. We can rejoice under the shadow of your wings. Glory to your name. Father, we've read your great eternal word. Now, we're asking you who gave the word to come anoint it, Lord, to our hearts, dear God. May you take control of the service. We, Lord, just want to so so thankful, Lord. We can rejoice in you, saying it's not I, but Christ in us, Lord, the hope of glory. Dear God, I just want to lift up Omar Robin into your presence by prayer. See this pneumonia, Lord has gripped her, Lord. I pray, Father, your healing hand would be upon her, Lord Jesus. Thank you, Lord. When you stood in Pilot's judgment hall that day, you took those stripes, Lord. You had this sickness on your mind, dear God. You purchased her healing in full. So, I pray you'd fully restore her back to perfect health for your glory, Lord. And Father, any other need in our midst, Lord Jesus, touch every life, Father, both here and those who are watching by the stream, be their portion as well, dear God. We love you, Lord. We thank you for this opportunity to gather, Lord, as a people. So, Father, may cover us in your blood and have your way in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you, friends. You can have your seats this morning. Amen. So, I want to talk about walking walking through this world and especially walking through uh dry places or or or sandy places. So we have here David would you know David is as we read here in Psalm 63 he longed to see the glory of the Lord as he had seen it in the sanctuary. So here was David as as as it said in the uh in the beginning of that psalm he was in the wilderness of Judah. He had uh he was he was now on the run from from Saul and his life had you know his life had become very complex and we live in a very complex age. It's not a simple age. It's a very complex age. There's so many things going on, so many voices, so many, you know, things are happening in this age. It's a complex age. Life never used to be like this. But you see, David, David used to have a simple life before before Samuel was sent to his house to anoint him. You know, he was just raising his father's sheep and, you know, he was just part of the family. But, but God had other plans for David because God wanted David to experience him in everyday life. not just not just see his power in the sanctuary where he go to church or however it was in those day but he wanted God wanted to prove himself to David in every part of his life and and so David remembered seeing his power and glory and he and he was hungry he was thirsty he was you know you know he was in this dry and barren land in this wilderness but he he had a desire God I want to see you and the reason that David was led out there in the wilderness was God was going to show him amen so there's many things that we walk through in life that are you know our paths you know we this This is a straight and narrow road we walk on, right? But it's not a smooth road all the time. Amen. It can be a very challenging road. It can be a difficult road. It can be a very swampy or muddy or however you want to say it road of it can be a very sandy road. Amen. Man's man's ideas fly in and fly out and you got to tread over those things. But the thing is, God wants to prove himself in those times. You know, he wants to prove himself in every situation of life. Amen. Because he wants to prove he's not just God in church or at camp or some special meetings. No, he's God everywhere. Amen. And he said, "I'll never leave thee, nor forsake thee." So, David was led out. See, it wasn't David's fault. He was on the run. He had not caused this at all. Really, what had caused it is that that a vindicated prophet of God was sent to his house to anoint him. Amen. And the anointing that came upon him, Amen, was to bring out the fact that he was a king. So, so David wasn't looking to be anointed. He wasn't looking to become king. Same thing you and I. We weren't looking to be the bride of Jesus Christ. We weren't even looking to become Christians. Amen. No. But God was looking for you. Amen. Like Samuel was sent to Jesse's house because God was looking for David. Amen. So this anointed word has come looking for you. Amen. It's anointed you. Amen. Transformed your life. Amen. Sins beneath you. Amen. He's filled you with his transforming power. He's changed you. What you were, you're not. Amen. God has done a great work. Amen. So now we're going to realize that we weren't looking for this. &gt;&gt; I wasn't looking for God as a drunk university student, but God was sure looking for me. Amen. And who he goes searching for, he finds. Amen. He gets a hold of, he keeps. Amen. He lifts them up on his strong shoulders, takes them into their sheepfold, into his sheepfold, and they're safe and secure forever more. Amen. No matter what they have to go through. Amen. But you see, the reason that he was on the run wasn't wasn't David's fault. It was as a result of what Saul had done. &gt;&gt; Saul because of compromising to try and keep the people together, Amen. caused the anointing to come off him and it went upon David. Amen. So now here he was in this spot. He was in this dry and thirsty land. Now see if I can drive this here. Now we live in a we live in a a complex age. Now I want to go here as well. Well, let's just read this. So David was very perseverant. He got he he took right out after Goliath, right? And after that same slingshot won the victory. Why? He believed in what he was trying to achieve. His achievement was right. It was in the will of God, in the word of God, and the plan of God. And if you can find out that your what your place is in the plan of God, even though you may be sick and nearly dead, you say, "I'm a Christian. How could that be in the plan of God?" It might be in God's plan to heal you and give you a testimony that will shake souls to the kingdom of God. Certainly, he lets those things happen. Maybe you had your ups and downs and the enemy scorching you from side to side. It might be that way. It's all in the plan of God. Amen. So, our walk that God's ordained is all in his plan. Amen. It's not always a simple we just want a, you know, cupidity expressway kind of experience. It's flat. We can go. It's straight. It's easy. There's no corners. But God's path for us isn't that way. There's ups and downs. There's bri patches. But isn't it amazing? Many times we get into a difficult place. And we begin to question our experience with God. But the reason we've got into those difficult experiences is because we have an experience with God. I mean, God has confidence in you. Not your humanity, but that seed he put on you. He has confidence that his salvation will hold. It will keep. It will prove what it is. Amen. That's why he allows you to go through difficult places. Amen. It's like Abraham. He went through a lot of spots. But God wanted to prove to Abraham who he really was. And he could never show Abraham who he was sitting in the ches living with his family doing all the comfortable things. No, his walk had to get into difficult places. had to get in places where there was tension at home and tension with, you know, among his extended family and all the with Lot, all these things. God brought him that way. &gt;&gt; Lord, &gt;&gt; was it Abraham doing anything wrong? No. So, why do we question ourselves when we get into difficult places? What have I done wrong, Lord? &gt;&gt; Actually, no. You're doing everything right. You're walking in the path God has ordained you to walk. Amen. I mean, because the footsteps of the righteous are ordered of the Lord. They can be difficult steps. I'm probably going to repeat this all the way through, but that doesn't mean God is displeased. It doesn't mean you're not a believer. Doesn't mean you're not part of him. No, that's the reason &gt;&gt; God wants to prove his word. Who's he going to do it through? You and I. How's he going to do it? He's going to take us through difficult things and we'll come out triumphantly out the other end. Why? Because he is our strength and our redeemer. &gt;&gt; Amen. It's like, you know, it's amazing how many times people get sick. And I don't know any balanced Christian that gets sick and they think, "Am I really a Christian? They think, "No, it's just the devil and it's sickness and but God's more than able." But then why don't we hold that same testimony when it comes into a mind battle? &gt;&gt; Why do we why don't we hold that? You know, because it's amazing how the enemy comes into our mind and makes us question and troubles and all these things. Then we start doubting our salvation. &gt;&gt; Why is that? &gt;&gt; No, a a believer is a believer. &gt;&gt; Amen. If you're under attack physically or spiritually, it's still the enemy, right? It doesn't mean you're not saved. Doesn't mean you're not victorious. It's just the enemy having a go at you. So why don't you have a go at him? &gt;&gt; I mean, take the word of God, stand in your God-given rights, and keep walking. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; But you see, what happens is many times, well, actually, all the time, when trouble comes, we begin to forget what he said. Now, I'm going to weave this in with this story. I'm going to try and tie these two accounts together, but you know, Luke would Luke would give the account of the two on the way to Emmas. Now, I love the story because brother Bram said this is prophecy that there's that there's believers in the days of the of the resurrection that God is going to walk with. He's going to open his word too and they're going to see him like what he did before he died. And that's you and I. There's a fulfillment of this prophecy is you and I, right? And so here they are. They're the living in the greatest week of history. the death, burial, resurrection of our Lord Jesus Christ. They're living in the greatest event. All the prophets long to see it. The angels wanted to look into it, but and here they were living in it, and the world had fallen apart. See, now they were walking through difficult ground. It was easy to walk with the Messiah when everything was going well. Lazarus came out of the grave. Oh, that's a nice path to walk in. Amen. The storms calmed on the sea. That's a great path to walk in. You know, uh Das's daughter comes from the dead. That's a great path to walk in. But when there's questions and when there's you know you don't have all the answers, you begin to wonder what happens is as sand of man's opinion begins to blow in and ideas of man and you know walking on sand can be difficult. &gt;&gt; I'm not talking about the sand that's right by the water. That's hard. I'm talking about the you know the like the dunes and stuff. It's hard to slog. You got to you can't just you you got to see where you're looking and watch and all these things. And they were they were walking down this kind of a path and they begin to talk together about all the things which had happened. And it came to pass that while they communed together in reason, Jesus himself drew near and went with them, but they did not know. Their eyes were beholden. They didn't realize who he was. And then he began to ask them a question. What manner of communications are these? Like why are you talking this way? What is going on? Now he was the one who caused it all walking with them saying, why are you talking like this? And then and then one of them, you know, Clopus was so so you know, I just imagine the look on his face. Hey, why you what do you mean? Why are you asking this question? Have you not been in Jerusalem? Have you not Have Weren't you there 3 days ago? Didn't you see what happened causes us to forget what he said? &gt;&gt; Amen. Be of good courage. I've overcome the world. I'll never leave thee nor forsake thee. Amen. All things work together for good. Those that love God are called according to his purpose. Those kind of things kind of we kind of when disappointment comes up, we forget what he said. Amen. And it isn't just like that like we have it today. When one little disappointment comes up about something, someone comes in and misconr misconstr something and then we go to say, "Oh, well, it's all fanaticism. Maybe there's nothing to it after all. Isn't that just a human race? Isn't that just a human race? Well, I know the divine healing isn't real cuz I know Mrs. Jones has prayed for and she didn't get well. That doesn't have one thing to do with God's promise. That has to do with Mrs. Mrs. Jones faith or the will of God. See now, but they had forgotten all of his words and that what he said he would raise on the third day. And they were present when he said it. And when he talked to his disciples, but they had forgot all about it. Sorrow had come. They've seen a man that had raised the dead after being dead for 4 days had seen that man let soldiers spit in his face. So here they were. They were walking. Their steps were, you know, I doubt very much they were skipping down the road to Emmas. &gt;&gt; They were walking with heavy hearts, you know, straightened, you know, short short steps, no doubt, just shoulders down and they're talking because their whole world in their opinion had fallen apart. But it was all according to God's plan. You see, and so disappointment had come in and someone, you know, someone comes and misconrs the word to you. Does it cause your cause to kind of shorten a bit? &gt;&gt; Oh, really? But I thought he said this and why are they saying this and all these kind of well that sand of man's opinion blows in. It gets harder to walk on the path. There's nothing wrong with you, nothing wrong with the path, but it's man's man's opinion, right? And God allows these things to come in that you know to prove his salvation in their lives. You see, they were walking this way not because of what they had done. They weren't backsliden. They had gone into sin. They weren't part of the howling mob that crucified the Messiah. It was God's ordained path for them. &gt;&gt; Are you following me today? I mean, I believe you are. Amen. So, you see, it became a very complex time in their lives. Like David's life went simple to complex. Running from Saul, on the run, all these troubles around him, all these things, he was living in a complex time. And so, we are living in a complex age. &gt;&gt; In the dark ages, it was either repent or perish. You know, the word for burden is weight or pressure. The pressure of the dark ages was either to bend or be broken, bow or die. It was the Inquisition, the power of the empire backing up satanic worship. Uh, be organized or pay with your life. Each age has its pressures. For example, the great burden of the last age is the pressures of riches, soft living, and a nervous tension in a complex age we seem unfitted to live in. This is the age we live in. Now, I I pray I'm not painting too much of a bad picture because we're built to walk through it and overcome, right? But you see, there's a very complex age. Now this is this is uh Thornton Key I think it was or is rather in 1925 early 1920s. Okay. So imagine imagine going back in that day contrasting it today. Everything's a lot less complex back there &gt;&gt; right? Can you imagine no phones, no internet, no computers, no electronics of any kind, no instant communications, no barrier of being, you know, you know, by a million opinions, no shopping malls, you know, but such a simple life. There's not all this complexity of things and arranging, you know, you hitch up the wagon. Imagine if we lived back in those days, I get a telegram from Pam. Brother Ed says, "I'm on my way." You know, how long would that take even with a car, &gt;&gt; you know? It's not, you know, and a lot less simple, but we don't live in that age. We live in this age, right? So, we can't go back to a horse and buggy era. No, we have to live in this time. And God has fully equipped us as they overcame in their age, we'll overcome in this age. Amen. So, there's all these complexities going on. There's a you know there's a there's a time of um you know this age is is is very much summed up in so this is from Pilgrim's Progress where they where they're just before the celestial city and they're walking along the enchanted ground and um you know they start falling asleep and wanting to rest a while and because the atmosphere of the of what they're walking through is is lulling them to sleep. And so this is the summary of what's going on there. So, as they near the end of their journey, they face another peril that is subtler and more harder to discern. They enter the enchanted ground, a city where the air tends to make unsuspecting travelers drowsy and lethargic. The enchanted ground represents dullness brought about by spiritual complacency and fatigue. So, so, so this is the age we live in. There's a there's a complacency in the world. Now, we got to realize, well, we know very well we live in Lady Oia. We're not of it, but we're in it. And it wants to affect us, right? But we've got to be able to withstand and we can withstand it and keep walking, right? God's anointed us to overcome. But you see, this is the atmosphere. Everything's so easy. There's no real hardship relative to 100 years ago, you know. But you see, so so there's a there's a complacency that can come in. There's a, you know, there's a whole even even Jesus would speak about this. Now, I'm just talking about the path that we're walking down at the moment. He says, "Take heed to yourselves, lest at any time your hearts be overcharged with um surfetting and drunkenness and the cares of this life, so that the day uh that day comes upon you unawares. For as a snare it shall come on the um on all them that dwell on the face of the whole earth. Therefore, watch ye therefore and pray always that you may be accounted worthy to escape all these things that shall come to pass and stand before the son of man." &gt;&gt; So, it's a snare that's come upon the whole earth. We live here, right? This is you know people are so you know mental health has gone through the roof and heart troubles and stresses and anxiety and all these things and I don't know what the percentage of people is it has to take and there's nothing wrong with it if you need it God gives doctors and medicine but you know people are on anti-depressants and suppressants and uppers and downers and all these things right we know the real cure is the Lord himself right but you see we live in this time of of everyone's anxious and stress and there's tension and all these things we live in such a complex time what's going to happen how we going to get out of this how's the world going to recover and all these things. No one knows the answer. You see? So, so it's become it's a snare upon the whole earth. &gt;&gt; But God rich in mercy &gt;&gt; has given us a way to walk over the snare. Amen. Cuz you got to realize you're fully dressed &gt;&gt; to walk through these conditions. Amen. Just like the brothers went hunting. I guess you would have been dressed for the occasion, right? You didn't go like this. No. Right. You were dressed for the conditions, right? And you're you're obviously what you wore kept you alive cuz you're here. Right? But you see, you plan for the conditions and God has pre-planned our dress wear for the conditions of this age. Amen. Which is the true baptism of the Holy Ghost. We'll come into that soon. But you see what has also happened is is there's seems to be a delay in the Lord's coming. But the Lord has allowed this to happen. So now here's the sand of of of people's opinion saying, well, if the Lord has come or or the Lord's coming, why is it why is it delayed? You know, the world has continued on as it has from the beginning. But you know even even Jesus would speak about this in Matthew 24 and he would he would speak about how how you know there'd be the servants and one servant you know the evil servant would say in his heart the Lord delayeth his coming. So he doesn't say it out loud he says it in his heart. Then normally what you say in your heart then your life begins to manifest that. Amen. So what does he begin to do? Begins to be um he begins to smite his fellow servants. He begins to attack his his own team instead of he's lost he's lost focus on the goal. What is that goal? To get whosoever will let them come in drink of the waters of life. Meet the Lord himself. Amen. Become one with him. Have a true spiritual relationship with Jesus Christ according to his word. Amen. That is that is that should be the thrust of every Christian. Amen. I want them to know the same one that found me. Amen. I want I want everyone to know him and the power of his resurrection. that he's more than a religion like when we're Christian and I were driving down the hill you know and I was saying about the Apostle Paul he said you know he didn't say I know what I believe he said I know in whom I have believed that's a very different thing amen because if you know what you believe it's just a list of doctrine but if you know him I mean I know in whom I have believed the person that changes everything because it's not about an argument now and this person said this and this happened here no I know him you've come too late I met the Lord Jesus Christ himself &gt;&gt; amen &gt;&gt; praise the Lord so he begins smite his fellow servants and you know he you know he loses his vision. He loses his purpose. He tears down attacks and then what does he do? He begins to become drunk. He begins to drink with the drunken. Now this world is drunk. &gt;&gt; This world is teetering. You can have excess of anything you want in this day. Food, exercise, entertainment, sport, pleasure, money, whatever you want. You can just get drunk on. You can go wild. And was a drunk man doesn't walk in a straight line. Believe me, I've been there. I don't recommend it. You see, but you see, this is what happens. You know, people just just stumble from one thing to another. They'll stumble from one conspiracy theory to another conspiracy theory, one doctrine to another doctrine. They're just stumbling around. Why? Cuz they've got they're drinking with the drunken. Amen. But then what happens is, you know, it's But you see, and then they they begin to lash out, you know, because getting drunk on the world inflames old wounds. We see this in this day we live in. All these old wounds of the past have come out. And sure, things need to be fixed, but the only thing that can fix this world is the Lord Jesus, right? But you see, old wounds are inflamed and come out hurts and pains and you know, you know, they bring up resentments and things that should have been healed &gt;&gt; sadly. Amen. Now, you see, this is very different to being drunk on the spirit. Amen. This is very different to being drunk on the spirit of God. Praise the Lord. Amen. you know, being drunk on the wine of stimulation of revelation. Amen. Why? Because it because, you know, it brings a it brings a healing. It brings a calmness. It actually brings a stability of walk. Amen. When you're drunk on the spirit. Why? Because it brings everything into perspective. Being drunk on alcohol takes everything out of perspective. But being drunk on the Lord brings it into perspective. Amen. Just like in the third seal where where the Lord commanded that black horse rider, do not touch the oil and the wine. So the devil had to obey that commandment. Satan, you can't touch the oil and the wine. You can't touch my spirit moving. You can't restrict that. And you can't restrict the stimulation by the revelation of the word. Amen. As a supernatural commandment from the throne of God, Satan, you cannot stop that. Amen. So if it cannot be stopped, I say let it flow. Amen. Cuz it's the one thing that will heal you. One thing will help. Amen. When God pours in his oil and God pours in his wine, Amen. And he binds up the wounds. Amen. He'll strengthen you and give you peace. Amen. Amen. It's like the, you know, it's like the uh story of the good Samaritan. Sorry if I'm a bit loud. You could turn me down. I don't know. I feel like I'm I don't mean to shout. Okay, but you see I just get excited. But anyway, you see the story of the good Samaritan. It's more than just helping natural people. Sure. You know, naturally, you got to think about this where this man was traveling from Jerusalem to Jericho. So, Jerusalem's up on the hill. Jericho is the lowest city in Israel. So, what was happening? This man was actually backsliding. He's going from a high elev where the temple was, where God was, all these things down to a place that was actually cursed. Remember Joshua cursed that place. Cursed be the person who builds this place again. Right? So, so here was a man who was backsliding. And in the process of his backsliding, he got mugged. He got beaten up and left for dead. And that's what the world does &gt;&gt; to people. And he said, "Well, I'm just going to go out. I'm going to find myself and I'm going to be free and I'm going to do what I want. I tell you what, you'll end up like this." &gt;&gt; Amen. But but you know those religious Levites and things, they could condemn him and say, "Well, you're in a bad way." But they couldn't help him. But then the Samaritan who had a who had a who had a bad name to begin with. Oh, you message people. &gt;&gt; You know, that's basically what it is. Oh, you're not you know, oh, look at you. But thing is, we carry something &gt;&gt; that can fix everyone. I mean, it can heal every wound. I mean, we carry the anointing of the word. Amen. That we can pour in oil. Isn't it strange? Have you ever seen a doctor pour oil and wine into wounds? &gt;&gt; You don't do that. Amen. This is not just He's not talking about natural wounds here. He's talking about spiritual wounds. Amen. Because you pour in, you don't pour oil and wine into wounds, but into spiritual wounds, you pour in the anointing of the Holy Ghost. I mean, you pour in the oil. Well, how do you do that? You create an atmosphere. It brings healing. Amen. It brings it brings deliverance. Amen. Where someone's all twisted up in their mind and trouble, but they spend time with you. What's happening? Then the oil begins, love is projected. Amen. The oil begins to be poured in. Amen. What happens is they leave you feeling lighter and better and happier. What's happened? Healing's taking place. Medicine's being poured in. Amen. And then you pour in the pour in the wine. The stimulation of the revelation of the word makes them happy. Gives them a spring in their step. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. This is what we're made to do. So it's very different. I'd rather be drunk on that. &gt;&gt; It solved all my troubles. &gt;&gt; It's given me peace that passes understanding. Amen. When you start to drink of this message of the hour. Amen. It gives you peace that passes understanding. You forget your troubles. You realize the enemy that's against you is actually not that big after all. And you can take him. Amen. You can down that devil. Amen. You can walk triumphantly. Amen. This is just my experience anyway. I like being drunk on the spirit. &gt;&gt; Amen. Make sure you forget all your troubles &gt;&gt; and it's not putting on blinkers. Amen. Now you realize I know in whom I have believed. It brings perspective. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. Oh, praise God. Now, but we are we are told in the same token naturally to be sober. We don't want to be drunk on this world. We got to be sober as we walk. Our walk should be deliberate. You know, it's not a cosmic accident really. When you think about, you know, when you look at a Christian who's really overcoming. I'm not talking about how well their life is going, but in themselves they got victory. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; That that is deliberate. &gt;&gt; That is a deliberate thing. It's like an athlete, you know, like our, you know, like the All Blacks or some great some people wouldn't say great team, but some great team that goes to compete. It's not an accident. They just turn up and they win. They've been training. They've got a goal in mind. I'm I'm going to lift that trophy. &gt;&gt; This day is my day. This tournament is my tournament. It's deliberate, right? And should it not be the same with us? &gt;&gt; Amen. We should be We should We should be deliberate in our day, Lord. Thank you. I've got another day to walk with you. Thank you, Lord, that you're going to reveal yourself to me. Thank you, Lord. You give me life in my body, Lord. I want to walk with you this day. Amen. Thank you, Lord. As I read your word, you're going to speak to me. Amen. Hallelujah. Who's with me this morning? You know, but but our walk should be deliberate. You know, it shouldn't be some cosmic accident that we get there. Should we know? Lord, you found me. Now I want to feed my experience, Lord. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. See, God has not appointed us to wrath, but to attain salvation by our Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. We're not the children of night that that day would overcome us. No, we're the children of light. &gt;&gt; Amen. We have light to walk in. We're not stumbling around. We're not trying to find our way. No, we know the way. Amen. But don't doubt the path that he's leading you down. No, it may be through mud, through swamp, through sand, of man's opinion, troubles, all these things. But I tell you what, friends, if you keep your mind on him, you'll have perfect peace. Amen. Amen. He will keep him in perfect peace whose mind is stayed on thee because he trusted in thee. Tell you what, if your mind is caught up in troubles and problems and how can this ever be and worries, that doesn't help anyone. &gt;&gt; Amen. But if your mind is on the word, &gt;&gt; Lord, you're my deliverer. Didn't he deliver you from sin? Didn't he deliver you from unbelief? I mean then then then what is the compared to that? What is the enemy that you face? It's like Moses would tell the children children of Israel before they went into the land, remember what God did when you come into the land. Remember what God did to the Egyptians behind you? The Egyptians were the superpower of the age. Amen. The you know the kingdoms in the promised land weren't that big compared to Egypt. Egypt could have taken the whole place themselves naturally. So So he's telling you, look, what you've come out of is actually bigger than what you're facing in front of you. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. You got to realize what you came out of darkness and sin and unbelief. That's far bigger. That that enemy that's under your feet already is far bigger than the one you face. &gt;&gt; Praise God. Trust ye in the Lord forever. For the Lord Jehovah is everlasting strength. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. Well, you say, well, how do we triumph? The same way the martyrs triumphed, the same way every age triumphed is by revelation. Because many he says be faithful unto death. He does not say be faithful until death but unto death. You may have to seal your testimony with your blood. Thousand j millions have died during all the ages. They died in faith like Antipus a faithful martyr. They held not their lives dear unto death. Often we think it would be impossible to be a martyr. But dare to recall that the faith that we daily use to triumph in Christ Jesus is the same faith that upholds the polycarps and all the martyrs. That the supreme faith will give supreme grace for the supreme hour. Blessed be God forever. &gt;&gt; Cuz we think how we don't have faith like that kind of faith you do. &gt;&gt; We're walking through different conditions than they did. &gt;&gt; Right? But it's the same faith that they had is the same faith you have. And their faith that caused them to overcome is the same faith that will cause you to overcome this complex age. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. Because what is the victory that overcometh the world? Even our faith revelation in the word. Amen. Gives us the victory. Now, this man is walking up a I guess it's a sandune, a desert. All these things, you know, it can be a difficult it can be a difficult thing to walk up these things. And many times, this is where our path takes us. Like David's path was taken to a dry and weary land. He wasn't dry. The Lord was with him. But he's walking through a dry and weary land. And so here's this person. He's walking uh you know the sandune or whoever he is. But you see and you know many times when we're walking these kind of ways our footing can be more difficult. It can be more laborious to walk &gt;&gt; right and and we come into these places and we got to realize that God has ordained us to walk through them. Right? So it can be you know sand can be what what can it be? It can be anxiety. It can be stress. It can be worry. &gt;&gt; People being jealous of you. &gt;&gt; If you're anxious, that doesn't mean you're not a Christian. &gt;&gt; If you're feeling stressed, it doesn't mean you're not a Christian. David would say, "Lord, when my heart is overwhelmed, lead me to the rock that's higher than I." Amen. He was a believer. He He was filled with the Holy Ghost. You can say anointed. He was king. All these things. He said, "Lord, when my heart gets when my emotions get supercharged that I can't cope, Lord, lead me to the rock that's higher than I." And what is that rock? a revelation of who Jesus Christ is. Amen. You begin to think about him. I tell you what, stress begins to go down. I mean, anxiety begins to vanish. Amen. Why? Because you you because you're not looking at you anymore. You're looking at him. I mean, you're looking at his ability. Amen. His strength, his word. I mean, you're looking at what he has done for you already. Amen. Because if you're built upon that rock of revelation, nothing can move you from it. And God did not plant you to move you. He did not put you there to take you off one day. You're part of that rock. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Praise the Lord. It would say about the Philadelphiaian age, I'll make them a pillar in the house of our God. And the pillar is part of the foundation. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's you as well. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen. Sand can be hard to hard to walk to. Drags you down. Takes a lot of conscious effort. But just keep walking. You know, it's like walking through mud. I remember when I was at Gabriella's school camp. I know Lily and Analise were there as well the years before. You know, the um the boys were led by one of the ranger guys to walk through all this mud and some of some of them lost their shoes, &gt;&gt; you know, but but walking through mud, you got to be real conscious of how you're walking, &gt;&gt; right? But you got to realize the shoes you're wearing cannot come off. &gt;&gt; Amen. They're built to walk through mud. They're built to walk through sand. They're built to walk through trouble. They're built to walk through all kinds of conditions because you have the right footwear. &gt;&gt; But just because you're walking through mud doesn't mean the mud is part of you. Amen. It's like, you know, you go out, you get muddy, you realize the mud didn't come from me, &gt;&gt; right? It came from the earth. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. But many times, you know, we're walking through difficult places. We think we are the mud &gt;&gt; or we are the sand &gt;&gt; cuz all these man's opinions and trouble comes and things blow and all these things happen and no, you're not that. You're just walking through it. &gt;&gt; I trust this makes sense today. And you got to realize, you know, that we the mud didn't come out of us. It's not of us. See, you know, people say, "Well, I'm just a highly anxious person." You know, you be walking through sand or mud. Anxiousness. You know, I'm naturally a stressed ball. You know, I'm a firstborn, so I'm just highrung. That's how I am. Not necessarily. &gt;&gt; You don't have to be that way. You know, don't don't own the mud. Don't own the sand. &gt;&gt; Amen. See, I wanted to put this in for William. The whole armor of God. Praise the Lord. I like swords and stuff. Anyway, I'm a boy. But he said, but but you know, part of the armor is that your feet would be shaw with the preparation of the gospel of peace. This word peace means it means primarily it's a verb. It means to join, to connect together. &gt;&gt; Amen. So, so we need one another. &gt;&gt; We need one another. &gt;&gt; Amen. We need to provoke one another to good works. To consider one another, to provoke unto love and to good works. Amen. We need one another cuz the cuz the journey can be hard sometimes. That's we need a brother or sister to take you by the shoulder and say, "Let's push." &gt;&gt; Let's keep going. You're going through something. I'm in it with you. Amen. You're going through a battle. Let's fight together. &gt;&gt; Amen. You You're struggling. Well, I'm going to join your struggle. Amen. I'm going to help you because we love one another. What is that? That's provoking one another to good works. And what is that doing? That's that shows that your feet are shaw with the preparation of the gospel of peace. &gt;&gt; Amen. When you care for one another, you're dressed the right way. You're not leaving We're not leaving anyone behind. &gt;&gt; Hey, the Marines weren't the first one to have that saying, leave no one behind. &gt;&gt; The Christian had it long before that. &gt;&gt; Amen. So, so we so it's so so it means a joining or a connection. It's the same thing when you know same word when Jesus would say that you know, you go to a house that be worthy, let your peace come upon it. What do you do? you become joined to that house. But if it's not worthy, let your peace return to you. And it's that same where it says, you know, think that I not come to send peace on the earth, but I come to send pe I come not to send peace, but a sword. Why? Because the word divides. It doesn't join together. It separates light from darkness, faith from unbelief, sin from righteousness. That's that's what the word does. It separates these things. A not a joining at all. Amen. But we're dressed this way to stand in the evil day. I mean, God has dressed us to stand and walk and overcome in this age. &gt;&gt; Tell you what, friends, you are built to walk through. Doesn't matter what condition that you're going through, you're built to walk through it. &gt;&gt; And we know the armor of God is not saying a prayer of like a Lord, I put on the helmet of salvation and the breastplate of righteousness and all these things. No, it is the baptism of the Holy Ghost. Your armor is supernatural. Amen. The shield of faith, that revelation, you hold up the quench of fiery darts. That's a supernatural thing. The sword of the spirit definitely is a supernatural weapon. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. You see, Timothy would be written to see Timothy's journey was a difficult one at times just like every Christian. And so, Timothy had got to a spot where he where where he started to withdraw within himself because of struggles, because of attacks, because of all these things. So, Timothy would be encouraged by Paul. He says, "Greatly desiring to see you uh to to see thee, being mindful of thy tears, that I may be filled with joy when I call to remembrance the unfained faith that was in thee, which dwelt first thy grandmother Lois and th and thy mother Ununice, and I'm persuaded that is in thee also." Because it's easy to look at other people and say, "Well, they're Christians. What about me?" And so, the Apostle Paul's telling him, look, the faith you see in your grandmother and your mother is in you. &gt;&gt; Amen. It's in you. You may not see it, Timothy, but it's there. &gt;&gt; Amen. And it's operating. So he's saying now listen because of this stir up I put in thee in remembrance that thou stir up the gift of God. So Timothy whatever's tried to whatever path you're walking through that's difficult bring into remembrance where you've been what God has done. Amen. Stir up the faith that is within thee. The gift of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. Which was in putting which is in thee by putting on of my hands. For God has not given us a spirit of fear but of power and of love and of a sound mind. &gt;&gt; Amen. This is what we're ordained to have. &gt;&gt; You say, "Well, I feel anxious. I feel fearful. I feel trouble." You got to realize the trouble's not you. The fear is not you. That's not who you're meant to be. &gt;&gt; Amen. That, see, it's not us. You say, "Well, I must be lacking somewhere in my Christian walk." No. Why do we Why do we identify as sand, identify as mud? You know, I saw a bumper sticker on a a Jeep yesterday, diesel vehicle or whatever it was. It says I identify as an EV. No, but the devil wants us to identify with him as opposed to the word, right? Are we all are we all together? I think we are. Amen. But see, that's why it's so important when we go through something as difficult. Amen. That that we hear the word of God because we are washed by the water of the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. There's a supernatural cleansing process when we open the word, when we come to church, when we hear the message. There's a supernatural washing &gt;&gt; that takes that takes place. Amen. Where it's amazing where, you know, if we really could, you know, have a testimony service, I believe there'd be many of us would stand here. Even myself, I came in those doors anxious and troubled and worried. And I walked out feeling feeling at peace, stable, strengthened, settled. Why was that? Because before I walked in with a lot of sand or dirt of the enemy trying to bog down my walk, but then the word came and it washed me and it cleansed me. Amen. So now I can walk like I'm meant to walk. Amen. Why? Cuz we're washed by the water of the word. Amen. We're not washed by the water of man's opinion. Amen. That or or the water of man's tradition. That doesn't wash anything. Amen. Those things might satisfy a religious itch, but it ain't going to wash. Amen. No. See, it doesn't it isn't made of the right stuff. Amen. The waters of separation that wash. Amen. It is Christ the revealed word. That's what washes. Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. It doesn't wash us that we just become a church member. No, it washes us till we get filled with the Holy Ghost. Amen. Transforms our life. Makes us new creatures in him. Amen. It washes off everything we walk through. &gt;&gt; You may have walked through a lot of difficult places this week. It may mean been like you're walking through a swamp. But I believe the word of God is here to wash that swamp from you. Amen. To give you strength and encourage you. Amen. It washes off all unbelief. It washes off all worry. It washes off all fear. It washes off jealousy. Washes off critical spirits. The word washes everything. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. That's what this word does. Amen. It is the best soap, if I put it that way, &gt;&gt; that there is. &gt;&gt; Why? Cuz we're washed by the water of the word. That's why it's so important. You feel all tense and troubled, go to your laundry. &gt;&gt; Go to the word of God. &gt;&gt; Right? Get it out. Apply it. Let it change you. Say, "Lord, I'm going through I'm struggling." Lord, you go to your source of strength. Your anxiety is not source of strength. Your worries or double minders, that's not your source of strength. Your source of strength is is the word. And I've never seen I've never seen someone go to the word of God sincerely and say, "Lord, help me." And he doesn't or she doesn't stay unhelped. &gt;&gt; God in his season comes and it's just gone. &gt;&gt; That's why you got to you got to meet the devil head on with that sword of the spirit. Amen. Take that word of God and chop that opinion down. Chop that thing down and that question mark and all these things. Why? Because the devil wants to control you by fear. It's like the serpent speaking to Eve. Basically, she was he was putting fear on her. Basically, God's holding you back. God hasn't told you the whole truth. Yay. Hath God said if she took that sword of the spirit and chopped that down, we would never be in the position we're in this morning. &gt;&gt; But we we're all faced with that same battle. &gt;&gt; Is it really true? Here comes man's opinion. &gt;&gt; Yeah, it's true. &gt;&gt; Does it really work? Yeah, it does. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Does this message really transform lives? &gt;&gt; Does it really cast out devils? &gt;&gt; Does it heal the sick? &gt;&gt; Amen. Does it prove the word is alive? Amen. Does he move among us? Has he not changed us? Amen. Has it not proved itself in 2025? &gt;&gt; Yes, it has. &gt;&gt; Man's opinion wants it to wants you to think everything else but that. Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. I'm I'm going to Where are we doing? I won't be too much longer. I won't drag this on too long. Amen. But see, we have the waters of separation, which is Christ, the revealed word. It washes everything. Amen. You say, "Well, where'd you get that from?" Well, very simple that he would cleanse us. Cleanse us with the washing of the water by the word. &gt;&gt; And that's why it's so important. You got to look at your look at your detergent and don't read the packet what it says it does. See what it does. &gt;&gt; Advertising can be false. You know, we had these laundry sheets and we found out Consumer Magazine did a test and and and they said they're the worst. The packet said one thing. The proof of the pudding was the test. &gt;&gt; Right. And I tell you what, friends, what's what's in the packet, it does what it says it would do of this word. Amen. It says, "For you were sometimes darkness, but now you are light in the Lord as walk as children of light." Amen. For the fruit of the spirit in all goodness and righteousness and truth, proving that what is acceptable unto the Lord. So testing by experience. Another another translation says what is acceptable unto Lord. So what what God accepts tested by experience. &gt;&gt; That's what I say. The word works. &gt;&gt; We've tested it. We've tasted and seen the Lord is good. &gt;&gt; Amen. That we can walk with confidence through everything that the Lord is my strength. He's my shield. He's my all in all. Amen. He is more than able to fulfill what he promised. He said he would do. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. See, what happens is sometimes we walk into dry places, but we got to realize that, you know, a desert place can be a one where there's no water. And people can get into that place where they get out of fellowship with with one another in the church and out of fellowship with the Holy Spirit. It brings us to a dry place, a desert, nothing alive. Everything's got stickers on it. See a desert, a little cactus like that sticker on it. Do you know what that is? It's a precious little tender leaf that hasn't had no water. It's just wound itself up so tight till it's a sticker. And when you see somebody like that, maybe it's a precious soul that could have been watered, right? would have been tender little leaf or something, but instead of that, it's wound itself up till it's just a sticker just punching at everything, you know, finding fault. It only needs it. The only thing it needs is just water. That's all. It's just it just needs a revival or a breaking up, a refreshing from the Lord. It'll unfold its little self if you just put it to the water. &gt;&gt; You know, you carry a lot of water with you. &gt;&gt; You know, you carry a lot of water. And you got to be careful. Someone else's experience doesn't become your experience, right? They could be bunch of stickers and everything's wrong and all these things. You got to realize, no, hold on. Just because they're going through that, that doesn't mean that's me. It doesn't mean I have to become like that, right? No, but you've got water that you can actually refresh that person. Amen. You can you can create an atmosphere around you that causes those stickers to unfill. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. Cuz we're not just armored, right? We're carrying water that we don't get thirsty. Amen. There's an artisian well of the baptism of the Holy Ghost that flows out of our living waters, flow out of our bosom. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. And not only that, but we have light to walk in. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. Jesus answered, uh, uh, are there not 12 hours in the day? If any man walketh in the day, he stumbleth not, because he seeth the light of the world. But if a man walk in the night, he stumbleth because there's no light in him. So, he doesn't say there's no light above him or in front of him. No, it's got to be in him. I mean, what is that light? Christ in you, the hope of glory. &gt;&gt; Amen. I trust I'm not losing too many of you here. Amen. So, you see now what happens is is that's the almighty God that's in you. If the light is in you now, you're not walking by memory. You're walking by or or by what you've learned. You're walking by revelation. Amen. Christ is in you. Amen. You got to realize this path we're walking down. The Lord is my light and my strength. He is within me. Right? And one way to test if people are walking by a church culture or a church tradition or revelation which is light is it's like if you have a room that you know where all the furniture is but then you you know even if it's pitch black you could be taught where everything is. So for example if this place was pitch black you had a blindfold on but I showed you before that. Now listen, three steps forward, you go through the door, three steps forward, turn right, two steps, then walk about 20 steps, you'll be at the front, and then you'll find there's three steps to walk up to, and then then five more steps and there's a chair, sit down. If you learned that enough, &gt;&gt; you could walk by memory in a pitch black room, right? Because you've been taught that. &gt;&gt; But then now, what if I move the chair over there? What if the pews get moved around? And now you'd be bumping into everything. You'd be stumbling into everything. Why? Because you're just walking by what you've learned. &gt;&gt; Amen. But if if there's a light on, &gt;&gt; if the light is on, it doesn't matter what is rearranged, it doesn't matter. This whole place could be totally different, but because you can see because there's light in you, it doesn't matter what gets rearranged, you're not going to stumble and fall and kick over the furniture, right? And it's the same thing with the word. The devil tries to come in and rearrange things and bring trouble and all these things. You say, "No, there's the light of the Lord is in me. I mean, I'm walking this path not by memory, not by education, not by learning. No, but by revelation. I mean, why? Cuz Christ is in me. The light is in me. So, I know where I'm walking. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. Aren't you glad that you because we are walking in a night time. Amen. The dawn has come, right? But we're I mean, we're walking in a night time, right? Christ is coming. You know what I mean? But you see, but because there's light in us, we don't stumble. &gt;&gt; Amen. man's opinion comes in, you can step around it, &gt;&gt; you know, like Yeah. Anyway, I'll leave that alone. Amen. But we are we are but then as we're walking sometimes we like we're walking through the jungle and you need a machete. &gt;&gt; All the all these vines and things try and entangle you, snare you, trouble you, all these things. But we've got the sword of the spirit to cut through &gt;&gt; every vine, every entanglement. And you say, "Why am I walking through this muddy water or this all this complex things? It doesn't make sense." I say, "God's given you a weapon to cut through." &gt;&gt; Amen. To cut through. And because you know who you are and you know that you've got light, it doesn't matter where you're stepping. That's irrelevant. I'm dressed for the occasion. Amen. I've got the tools to get out and God is with me. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So, you take the sword of the spirit and you can chop through everything that tries to entangle you. &gt;&gt; Amen. Because when Jesus was there in the you know you know in the in the wilderness there it said the spirit of God led him there to be tempted of the devil. Amen. Jesus had all the fine qualities of God in him. Do you believe it? He had powers upon powers. But when he met Satan he never used his power. He gave an example for the weakest of Christians. When he met Satan he said it is written man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceeds out of the mouth of God. The weakest Christians I mean the weakest Christian can take that stand hold it. Sure. God is um God's in his word. Every time when he met the enemy, he said, "It's written." I believe he had power to do it. But he met Satan on the same grounds with the same word that you can meet him with everyone. It's written. &gt;&gt; Absolutely. &gt;&gt; Amen. So the weapon we have Jesus used to combat the enemy. &gt;&gt; Amen. And the weak, you say, "I'm not feeling very strong in faith." You're more than enough. &gt;&gt; You're more than enough. Amen. To take that sword and chop the enemy down. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now let's go back to our tour on the way to kind of left them and we've gone here and now we're coming back again. And so they walked very heavy down that road. Disappointments had come in. People's opinion, things have been misconstrued. They're walking there. But the whole time they are wondering about what's going on. The Lord Jesus was right with them. And then finally they came, you know, so it's like they're walking through mud. They're walking through sand. It was difficult. You know that walk that was on the way to it. It was a difficult walk for them. But as they are walking, the Lord was just quickening the scripture to their lives. It's meant to be this way. Look at the prophecy. Look at the shadow. I mean, it's meant to be an evil age, a dark age, a troublesome age. All these questions of, you know, got to be floating around, all these things. But you see, but but then he came but then they came to the village. They came to the village and they and and it looked like he was going to walk by and they said, "Come come stay with us. The day is spent." Now, it took them about 6 hours to walk there through that mud, through that trouble. Jesus was walking with him the whole time. And then finally they came into the house. He actually sat down at the head of the table and he broke the bread and he gave it to them. Then their eyes came open and he you know he vanished right? So he did something that he did before the crucifixion. Right? He manifested himself in the same way he did before the crucifixion you know when he fed the multitudes right and their eyes came open. Now when they because of that when they went back to Jerusalem it wasn't a trudging walk of a downcast way. They ran they walked the same path but they ran it. took them like an hour to run back to Jerusalem. Amen. So, so, so one moment on the path, it was like walking through mud. And then after the Lord Jesus manifested himself, proved his word, their eyes came open. Lord, you've been with us the whole time through this tregery of this complex age we live in and you've been here the whole time. Their eyes came open. They ran back to the disciples. We have seen him alive. Amen. He has proved his word. Amen. He is alive and well. Amen. So, what did they do? They ran. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. It wasn't a muddy, hard walk anymore. Oh, no. It was easy. &gt;&gt; Why? Because he came and answered their questions. And how did he do it? By manifesting himself. &gt;&gt; By proving himself. And I tell you what, friends, has he not done that time and time again? I'm not even just talking about in the prophets ministry. What about today? &gt;&gt; Has he not proved his word &gt;&gt; constantly? Has he not proven himself alive? He's broken the bread of life and given it to us. Amen. He's quickened it to our souls. Our eyes have come open. &gt;&gt; Amen. We can say he's alive. Messiah is here upon the earth. Jesus Christ is the same yesterday, today, and forever. Amen. And what will that do? That will give you strength. &gt;&gt; Amen. In this in this complex age, you got to realize we're in this world, but not of this world. &gt;&gt; Amen. So, all this is going on, don't let it affect you. It'll try and grip you. It'll try and trouble you. You got to realize, no, I have been built. &gt;&gt; God has dressed me &gt;&gt; to walk through this age. That's what the message of the hour has done. has dressed us in the true baptism of the Holy Ghost with the true sword of the spirit. We've seen it cut down demons. We've seen it cut down sickness. We've seen it bring deliverance. We've seen it bring the baptism of the Holy Ghost. We've seen it bring prodals home. We've seen it done many mighty things that he promised it would do. &gt;&gt; Amen. So, the weapon you have, well, that was someone else that did that. The same weapon is in your hand. &gt;&gt; Take the word of God. You say, "Well, I don't feel like I'm a Christian." We don't walk by feeling. We don't walk by sight. We walk by faith. Amen. So don't walk. You say, "Well, I'm going through a hard time." The road will change. &gt;&gt; Who's with you in the easy times? The Lord. Who's with you in the hard times? The Lord. So keep walking. You say, "I'm never going to get out of this swamp." Oh yeah, you will. &gt;&gt; God wants to prove that you're not a fair weather Christian. &gt;&gt; Amen. It's like, you know, I used to be sailing when I was young and I came to a point where I'm not a fair weather sailor. &gt;&gt; If it's if it's blowing a gale, I'm out there. If it's still, I'm out there. I'm out there in any condition &gt;&gt; cuz I enjoy being out there. It's the same thing being a believer, right? We're not fair weather Christians. Trouble comes up, we walk with God. Sickness strikes us, we walk with God. Amen. Questions come up, we walk with God. There doesn't seem to be an answer, we walk with God. Amen. Why? Because we know he's walking with us and he's built us to walk through everything. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So, I just want to finish there this morning. But in summary, you may be going through something hard. You may be going feel like you're walking through sand. You're not the sand. Maybe you feel like you're walking through mud. It's very hard. hard slog. You're not the mud. What you're walking through is not you. It's just the path that God has ordained you to go down. It's not because he's annoyed at you. Not because he's disappointed in you. No, he wants to prove his word. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And he has confidence in you that in your walk, you'll come to a stage you'll say, "Lord, I need you in this moment." &gt;&gt; And he'll say, "I've been waiting for you to say that." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And in his season, he steps in. Even this morning, steps in. &gt;&gt; Amen. And what does he do after we've been through those things? We get washed. &gt;&gt; Amen. We're washed by the water of the word. Cleanse us so we can walk out happy, free, and rejoicing. The situation out there may not have changed, but we've changed. &gt;&gt; Amen. And God has dressed us to overcome all things. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. Let's stand this morning. &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's have the musicians, please. Amen. I want to sing that song that we um uh that you finished with Josh. Uh yet not I but Christ in me. Yet not I but through Christ in me. Amen. Let's sing this this morning. Praise the Lord. You happy to be a Christian today? I trust you are a believer. You given your life. You say, "Well, will he ever take me in?" He takes in anyone. Takes anyone. Amen. It's not who we are. We can't earn anything. It's what he has earned. Amen. He's such a merciful God. Amen. Let's just rejoice this morning. Oh, sorry. Of grace is Jesus my redeemer.

Lord Jesus, thank you, dear God. Father, we know whatever path you've ordained us to walk. You'll lead us through, my God. You'll give us strength, Lord. Thank you. You've dressed us to walk through every condition, my God. Thank you. You've given us the sword of the spirit, Lord, to chop through every obstacle. Thank you, dear God, that Lord, Lord, we got the right footwear on, my God, to walk through maybe muddy places, difficult times, sand of man's opinion, dry places. Lord, whatever it is, dear God, we know, Lord, that you will see us through, Lord, because you've led us through the valleys, Lord. You've led us over mountains, my God, through bri patches and fire and flood and all kinds of things. You've led us through, my God. So, I pray, dear God, as we walk, Lord, into this week now, whatever we're facing, may we just have a renewed confidence, Lord, a renewed faith in you. I pray that you'll give us such a strength, Lord, that we would just realize, Lord, such a stability. May we realize, Lord, what we're walking through is not us. It's just the environment we're going through, the conditions, the situations. Lord, we may be going through a complex age, but thank you, Lord. You've built us to overcome and walk victorious. So, Father, I pray you bless each one here. Strengthen them, my God. Pour in your oil and your wine of your word, Lord, and just strengthen each one, Lord. Give us a renewed step, Lord, like the two on the way to Emmas after you revealed yourself. Grant it, dear God. We love you, Lord. We thank you for your great mercy in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. God bless you, friends. So Mo's got a testimony, you know. Amen. So you can have your seats. You'd love to hear that. Amen. So God bless you. We'll just get this going. Oh, God bless you, saints. Um, so I just wanted to come and tell a little testimony because I feel like the Lord does things in our lives that if we don't share them, we're just going to forget them and they're just going to go into dust, right? So, I feel that I need to share this because So, we came to Oakland on Wednesday. We drove up there to pick up my sister and so we came back last night, came pretty late about 12:34 and then prayed everything, went to bed. Now, normally I'll put on my laptop to get an alarm so we can wake up in the morning for Sunday. And I'll put on the life of the prophet because he doesn't access the internet. So, I couldn't put on like the message or the Bible. So, I just put that on so it stays on, right? And so, I was listening and I was trying to fall asleep and I got to I think it was chapter 16 and it was telling about how her sister came to brother Brandham's house and she was asking to pray for her because she had accidentally backslid, right? And so as he was casting the devil out of her, right, the lady that was telling the story, she says that um as soon as he mentioned the name of Jesus, then everything in the room started shaking and the the door started banging and stuff like that. And in my dream, right, so I was obviously half awake. I be making some food and I I wanted to say amen in the name of Jesus Christ. But immediately when that happened, I couldn't say Jesus' name. So I immediately knew that this is an attack from the devil. And since I can't speak, he doesn't want me to say Jesus's name. So I just kept on trying and I couldn't speak. It was like my mouth was not even there. So I just kept on trying and trying and trying. And I started waking up and waking up and I said, "Jesus, Jesus, Jesus." And I shouted his name, right? And then I knew and the spirit of God came into the room, just started praying and casting the devil because he was in there. He was trying to constrict us. He was trying to destroy our sleep or something like that, right? And so that was just a really encouraging thing that I saw because these little things that the devil can come and just try to attack you and try to make you feel like you're you're low, right? But we're actually above him. It's Jesus is actually there. He's actually intervening in our lives, right? I just wanted to share that. Amen. God bless. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. Thanks, man. I appreciate that. Amen. There's power in the name of Jesus Christ. Hallelujah. The devil's defeated. Amen. Can we Can we just sing one more song? Can you humor me? I want to sing that song. Lord, there's nothing better than you. Yeah. I search the world. It couldn't kill me. Yeah. Can we sing it? Can we stand? Can we just sing that and then Yeah. services?
