[18:31] now let's have a pre-meeting at your
[18:33] house we're still staying in stokes
[18:34] valley
[18:34] and we moved from the house here at 243
[18:38] stokes valley
[18:40] you know four six two four three just
[18:42] there right and we moved up to mana
[18:44] drive and
[18:44] we were staying there and they said we
[18:47] want to have a pre-meeting why don't we
[18:49] have a pre-meeting in your house
[18:51] on a friday night they've even knew
[18:53] where i came from
[18:54] friday nights was definitely not nights
[18:57] i dedicated to the lord
[18:58] friday nights was where i was out and
[19:00] about with my friends doing other stuff
[19:03] everything but what the lord wanted me
[19:06] to do
[19:07] so i said to them okay come over let's
[19:10] have a pre-meeting now
[19:12] inside of me i was so scared because i
[19:14] never knew
[19:15] what this prayer meeting is i don't know
[19:17] what a premier ring is you know i've
[19:18] never had one
[19:19] especially not in my own house so they
[19:22] get there
[19:23] and i might be saying a couple of the
[19:25] highlights so i don't color in pictures
[19:27] i just remember the highlight
[19:28] reels pretty much that's how most of my
[19:31] memory goes
[19:32] and we sat and we were all sitting
[19:34] around in the couches and
[19:35] and brother andy said why don't you
[19:38] start praying first
[19:39] now i'm terrified they're sitting in my
[19:41] house and i've got the pastor
[19:43] and brother andy which is the other part
[19:45] that i'm like oh yeah we got we got
[19:47] we've got the ministers in my house so
[19:49] man
[19:49] are they gonna cast out some demons or
[19:51] something's gonna happen here because it
[19:52] felt very
[19:53] serious and i was really like oh what do
[19:57] i do and they say no you start praying
[19:59] but i don't know how to pray i don't
[20:01] know what to say and i don't know what
[20:03] to expect so it's all new for me
[20:05] and i closed my eyes and i prayed the
[20:07] first time i just say thank you that
[20:08] we're in the house and lord
[20:10] i've got family and friends that's now
[20:12] here and they're going to pray with me
[20:14] and
[20:14] you know i don't know what's going to
[20:15] happen because i've been honest but we
[20:17] just start praying and i just say thank
[20:18] you for everything that he gives me
[20:20] and it goes to the one and goes to the
[20:22] other and everybody gets a chance to
[20:23] pray
[20:24] and it comes around the second time but
[20:26] when we prayed the second time we
[20:28] started praying against things that was
[20:30] hindering us
[20:31] spirits and things that would be
[20:33] cleaning to the house before and and
[20:35] things that we used to do before and
[20:37] the whole prayer meeting changed so much
[20:39] that it was starting to talk to me
[20:41] inside and i got so happy and then all
[20:43] of a sudden
[20:44] the presence of the lord came down and
[20:46] it was tangible
[20:48] i don't know the right english to put in
[20:50] and i wish i had a better
[20:52] vocabulary it was so real
[20:56] that when it came down i knew that deity
[20:58] stepped into the room
[21:00] now never in my life have i ever
[21:02] experienced something close to this
[21:04] and i want to encourage you if you ever
[21:06] wonder what to do on a friday night
[21:08] invite some brothers and sisters around
[21:10] to your house
[21:12] and start praying and don't stop until
[21:15] the lord wants you to stop okay don't
[21:17] stop even if it goes two times even goes
[21:20] three times just keep praying on a
[21:21] friday night
[21:22] because guess what it is a million
[21:25] billion gazillion trillion google play
[21:27] sometimes
[21:29] much better than anything i had any
[21:32] other friday of my life
[21:34] and that is the truth as god is my
[21:36] witness
[21:37] it was the best experience i had in my
[21:39] life and i said lord might never forget
[21:41] this experience
[21:43] so kids you don't need to know how to
[21:45] pray
[21:46] you don't need to go and work yourself
[21:48] up all this big all you need to do
[21:50] is be available and god will make you
[21:54] able
[21:54] okay so just pray and pray what's in
[21:57] your heart
[21:58] but don't stop when you say amen because
[21:59] you never know that second time it came
[22:01] around it changed everything for me
[22:03] in my life amen and i experienced the
[22:06] presence of the lord on a friday night
[22:09] in my own house amen so i thought i just
[22:12] said it i don't know why but i thought
[22:14] i'll just hear that
[22:15] to you guys because again
[22:19] i would have never been here if it
[22:21] wasn't for his miraculous wonderful
[22:23] power amen so days of miracles kids
[22:26] are not over amen so let us stand and we
[22:30] sing away in a manger
[22:31] amen i don't know why i shared that i
[22:34] just felt lead to so
[22:35] may god get the glory out of that
[22:37] testimony
[22:38] and if you've ever experienced the lord
[22:40] jesus christ
[22:42] if you've really experienced him in your
[22:44] life there's no doubt in your mind that
[22:46] there is a god

[33:58] hoping sister maggie the birthday girl
[34:00] would have been here but uh
[34:01] i hope she's having a good time i mean
[34:04] when the days of
[34:05] purification according to the law of
[34:07] moses were accomplished they brought him
[34:08] to jerusalem to present him to the lords
[34:10] this is mary and
[34:11] and and joseph taking jesus to to the
[34:14] temple
[34:15] as it is written in the law of the lord
[34:17] every male that openeth the womb shall
[34:18] be called holy to the lord
[34:21] and to offer a sacrifice according to
[34:23] that which is said in the law of the
[34:25] lord a pair of turtle doves
[34:27] or two young pigeons and behold there
[34:30] was a man in jerusalem
[34:32] whose name was simon and the same man
[34:34] was just and devout waiting for the
[34:36] consolation of israel and the holy ghost
[34:38] was upon him
[34:39] and it was revealed unto him by the holy
[34:41] ghost that he should not see
[34:43] death before he had seen the lord's
[34:45] christ
[34:47] hallelujah hallelujah and he came by the
[34:50] spirit into the temple and when
[34:51] the parents brought in the child jesus
[34:54] to do
[34:55] for him after the custom of the law then
[34:57] he took him up in his arms and blessed
[34:59] god and said lord

[36:56] amen amen amen god bless you friends you
[36:58] may have your seats tonight and
[37:00] if i could just take a a a title i just
[37:03] want to ask you the question
[37:04] what do you see when you see the word
[37:06] made flesh now it's amazing that
[37:09] different
[37:09] you read through the gospels and you can
[37:11] start from genesis all the way down
[37:12] through
[37:13] it's amazing the people's reaction when
[37:15] god comes among them you know we
[37:18] uh we read it on sunday i believe but
[37:21] you know
[37:21] herod when he heard about you know the
[37:24] wise men came into jerusalem psyches
[37:26] turned me down a bit
[37:28] uh brother ed you know the wise men came
[37:30] into jerusalem i said where is he born
[37:31] king of the jews they're all excited and
[37:33] they're under expectation and
[37:35] and the whole city was moved and
[37:36] troubled by this and
[37:38] you know but herod herod wasn't all that
[37:40] excited about a king being born
[37:41] because he felt challenged he felt
[37:43] intimidated because in his little
[37:45] you know top two inches of his brain
[37:48] he said i'm king around here and it
[37:51] really just brought out he was a
[37:52] murderer anyway but it really brought
[37:54] out what was within him and
[37:55] you know he he he wanted to kill jesus
[37:58] because
[37:59] because he saw him as a threat to his
[38:02] kingship
[38:02] yeah and we know that you know uh the
[38:06] same
[38:07] the same attitude came out in the
[38:08] scribes and you know scribes and
[38:10] pharisees you know it took them a lot
[38:12] longer to come to that point but that
[38:13] was already in them anyway
[38:15] but you know you know they weren't like
[38:16] hear it here it was uh quicker out of
[38:18] the starting blocks you know so to speak
[38:20] about
[38:20] wanting to kill the lord but you know
[38:22] the scribes and pharisees you know were
[38:24] in the same boat because eventually they
[38:26] came to a place
[38:27] let's kill this man now we've come to
[38:30] the scene in the temple where jesus is
[38:32] to be presented
[38:33] you know the best that mary and joseph
[38:35] could have had as an offering was was
[38:37] say two turtle doves or
[38:38] you know because they were a poor kind
[38:40] of people and jesus was wrapped in
[38:43] swaddling clothes
[38:44] and here they are in the temple now we
[38:47] we must remember
[38:48] that they weren't the only ones in the
[38:49] temple there are many other first-born
[38:52] sons being presented to the lord you
[38:53] know
[38:53] that would just be one and men you know
[38:55] one of many
[38:57] and you know the other woman there you
[38:59] know everyone
[39:01] responds to the word being made flesh
[39:02] everyone
[39:04] you know there's a saying it'll either
[39:06] make you mad glad or sad
[39:08] and you know so i want to be the glad
[39:10] one not the sad or the mad
[39:12] maybe sad at first knowing i need
[39:13] salvation but after i've met him i'm
[39:15] glad
[39:16] right but it should ultimately make you
[39:17] glad i mean not mad
[39:20] hallelujah so you're mad sad or glad you
[39:22] know whatever category
[39:24] uh you choose to fall in well that's
[39:26] your choice but you know the other woman
[39:28] you know herod he wanted to kill the
[39:30] word made flesh the other woman when
[39:32] they saw that word made flesh
[39:34] when they saw it they saw an
[39:35] illegitimate child you know jesus
[39:37] you know there's already a rumor and you
[39:39] can even read this in in you know in
[39:41] in history that they say that jesus
[39:44] father was either a roman soldier
[39:47] or it was joseph himself that's what
[39:48] history would say
[39:50] you know so so before he even came to
[39:52] the came to the earth or even you know
[39:54] you know as he's just as
[39:56] a little boy baby there child you know
[39:59] he already had a bad reputation to begin
[40:01] with he already had a bad name now
[40:03] if we could just dramatize this you know
[40:05] there'll be a line of woman there
[40:07] they're all
[40:07] waiting with their gift and you know
[40:09] maybe they're carrying their baby in the
[40:11] best kind of blanket or or your needle
[40:13] work or you know they're all dressed up
[40:14] for the occasion this is a big day
[40:16] this is not just any day this is a big
[40:18] day and you know you know they're all
[40:20] excited but then there comes in another
[40:21] two into the line there's
[40:23] there's there's a poor kind of maybe 17
[40:25] year old kind of girl
[40:27] you know you know she's not wearing the
[40:29] best kind of clothes you know she has a
[40:31] baby and he's wrapped up in swaddling
[40:32] clothes not the nicest kind of
[40:34] you know you know kind of gown or
[40:36] whatever you would call it
[40:38] you know and and and they would they
[40:39] would come in
[40:41] and then immediately people would begin
[40:42] to see and there'd be a whisper begin to
[40:44] run down the line
[40:46] they're from nazareth you know i mean
[40:49] they're from bethlehem this is mary
[40:51] oh mary you know it's amazing how
[40:53] quickly things spread
[40:55] you know when when when my parents lived
[40:58] in papua new guinea you know
[41:00] the locals would tell you as soon as you
[41:02] get off the plane
[41:03] everyone knows who you are who your mum
[41:05] is who your dad is where you're from
[41:07] what they do they know everything about
[41:09] you you've never met anyone but they
[41:10] know exactly who you are
[41:12] they know where you're from your age
[41:15] things spread wildfire just spreads
[41:18] around
[41:18] you know so they begin to talk and now
[41:20] immediately now
[41:21] oh this is an illegitimate child
[41:25] i don't want him photobombing me
[41:29] you know i don't want him i don't want
[41:31] mary
[41:32] you know i'm trying to bring into
[41:33] today's language i don't want that photo
[41:36] bombing
[41:36] in my photos with my son when he's being
[41:38] dedicated to the lord
[41:40] and then because that stigma they begin
[41:42] to spread away and there's always a gap
[41:43] in the line
[41:45] there's a gap around him because no one
[41:47] wanted to be associated
[41:48] with the word made flesh they were
[41:51] embarrassed
[41:52] they were embarrassed to be near him
[41:54] even though they were in the temple they
[41:56] were claiming to be
[41:57] believers following the word but they
[42:00] were embarrassed to be
[42:02] identified with the very god that was
[42:04] actually the one they were claiming to
[42:06] worship
[42:07] they were embarrassed to be near him now
[42:10] we must never ever be embarrassed to be
[42:13] associated
[42:14] with him so now i may be talking a lot
[42:17] about back in the temple
[42:18] but really that same scene is played out
[42:20] today so what's your attitude you see
[42:22] someone you know it's very easy just to
[42:24] go through a form of church
[42:26] but then when the spirit begins to fall
[42:28] and maybe people begin to cry
[42:30] and shout or rejoice and be happy are
[42:32] you embarrassed
[42:33] to be associated with those kind of
[42:35] people i mean when
[42:37] people are going to testify and talk
[42:38] about god out in the public are you
[42:40] are you embarrassed we shouldn't be
[42:43] embarrassed
[42:44] we say i'm so glad i can say i'm one of
[42:46] them
[42:47] hallelujah i mean even
[42:50] even even um paul would say to timothy
[42:53] uh in in second timothy i don't
[42:56] i don't have it um in my notes but we
[42:58] can turn to that
[43:02] second timothy 1
[43:06] and verse 18 he says the lord uh grant
[43:09] unto him
[43:12] no sorry verse 16 the lord give mercy
[43:14] unto the house of
[43:15] oniferous for he often refreshed me and
[43:18] was not ashamed
[43:20] of my chain so he was not ashamed of the
[43:22] condition that the apostle paul
[43:25] was found in and also
[43:29] paul would say to timothy in verse 8 be
[43:31] not thou therefore ashamed of the
[43:33] testimony of our lord
[43:34] nor of me his prisoner but be thou
[43:37] partaker of the afflictions of the
[43:38] gospel according to the power of god so
[43:41] to paul's telling timothy don't be
[43:42] ashamed of me don't be ashamed of the
[43:45] messenger yeah right we shouldn't be
[43:47] ashamed you know to say
[43:49] we believe god's seen a prophet his name
[43:51] happens to be william branham
[43:53] and he fulfilled malachi 4. and i'm part
[43:55] of that fulfillment because my heart's
[43:56] been turned back to the apostolic faith
[43:58] of the fathers
[43:59] we shouldn't be ashamed of those things
[44:01] amen but you see
[44:03] you see now now but they thought that
[44:05] jesus was an illegitimate child
[44:08] remember jesus you know that you know
[44:10] even even when jesus came into his
[44:12] ministry
[44:13] the scribes and pharisees said to him i
[44:15] believe it's in john 6 of john 8 we be
[44:17] not born of fornication
[44:19] see they were they were talking about
[44:21] the garden but they also talked about
[44:23] him and his birth
[44:24] upon the earth right but you know so
[44:27] something that's illegitimate now i did
[44:29] the definition of illegitimate it means
[44:32] it's not authorized by law
[44:34] and it's not in accordance with accepted
[44:37] standards of rules so something that's
[44:38] illegitimate
[44:39] it's not accepted right you know there's
[44:42] no there's no legitimacy
[44:43] you know behind it you know if you if
[44:46] you take that
[44:46] into a religious realm a church
[44:50] that is legitimate to not illegitimate
[44:52] but the opposite
[44:53] it's one that's recognized so
[44:56] so for example you know what
[44:58] denomination do you belong to
[45:00] if you say you can say any denomination
[45:02] you want and people say that's a
[45:04] legitimate church
[45:06] right anyone under the sun what bible
[45:08] school did your pastor go to
[45:11] if i had a dd behind my name that would
[45:13] give me legitimacy
[45:15] because i've studied it i didn't get my
[45:18] degree
[45:18] in a theology college i have a i have a
[45:22] postgraduate diploma in biochemistry but
[45:24] when it comes to theology
[45:26] i mean when it comes to lord i got my
[45:28] degree of neology
[45:30] down on my knees i met my jesus that's
[45:33] where i got my
[45:34] degree hallelujah so but the thing is if
[45:38] i
[45:38] you know if i went to bible school
[45:39] people ask me what bible school did you
[45:41] go to i didn't go to any
[45:43] you know and they and they can't get
[45:44] their head around that you know what
[45:46] kind of denomination is it oh we're
[45:48] independent
[45:49] what do you mean the thing is when you
[45:50] begin to talk about those kind of things
[45:52] the legitimacy of a church goes down in
[45:56] the people's eyes
[45:59] just like jesus carrying uh mary
[46:02] carrying jesus
[46:04] to the temple a bad name was associated
[46:06] with him and no
[46:07] people were embarrassed to be near where
[46:08] he was now if we go back to
[46:11] the the days of exodus of the first
[46:13] exodus because we know there's parallels
[46:15] between
[46:16] every exodus in the scripture and we
[46:18] know we're in the third exodus we're
[46:20] going from this world to the next world
[46:21] and that would be
[46:22] as i said that'd be such a cool
[46:23] christmas present hallelujah
[46:26] but you see when when when um when
[46:29] joseph is bringing his father and and
[46:31] all of his family down into
[46:33] down into egypt and he's going to
[46:35] introduce his father to pharaoh
[46:37] um joseph begins to tell his father you
[46:40] know that ye shall
[46:42] say this is what you should say to him
[46:43] thy servant's trade hath been about
[46:45] cattle from our youth
[46:47] even until now both we and also our
[46:49] fathers
[46:50] that we may dwell in the land of goshen
[46:52] now this is genesis 46 34 if you're
[46:54] taking notes
[46:55] that we may dwell in the land of goshen
[46:57] for every shepherd
[46:58] is an abomination unto the egyptians so
[47:01] so they were shepherds
[47:03] they had sheep that was their livelihood
[47:05] their goats that are cheap they had
[47:07] you know shepherds but he's trying to
[47:09] say don't tell them
[47:10] this is your trade because this is an
[47:12] abomination to the egyptians now
[47:15] this word shepherd here in the scripture
[47:17] i mean let's start with the word
[47:18] abomination this is
[47:20] so an abomination i mean something that
[47:22] is
[47:23] disgusting this is this is from the
[47:25] strong's concordance
[47:27] it's something that's disgusting morally
[47:29] it's something to be loathed or detested
[47:31] so this is what egyptians thought of
[47:33] shepherds they are disgusting morally
[47:36] they are loath and they're detested it
[47:38] wasn't a trade that you'd say boy when
[47:40] you grow up you want to be a shepherd
[47:42] reuben you want to be a shepherd in
[47:43] egypt that's what you want to be
[47:44] everyone will love you for it no
[47:46] everyone will detest you you know
[47:49] you know if if they you know how you get
[47:52] to i think it's high school you get
[47:53] asked questions what do you want to be
[47:54] when you grow up
[47:55] you know and so i want to be a ship but
[47:57] the teachers say no you don't
[47:59] you don't want to be a shepherd but you
[48:01] see
[48:02] that's right this is what the egyptians
[48:04] thought of it now now i'm coming to a
[48:06] point this is going to tie a neil
[48:07] we may go this way but we'll get there
[48:09] okay now a shepherd in the hebrew here
[48:12] so this word shepherd now says an
[48:13] abomination something that's
[48:15] disgusting morally something loathed or
[48:17] detested
[48:18] now a shepherd in the hebrew is from the
[48:20] from two words
[48:21] it means one means to tend to flock and
[48:24] the other one means two
[48:26] uh uh two it's a collective name to
[48:28] migrate or a collective name for a flock
[48:30] of sheep or goats
[48:31] so he's talking about a shepherd he's
[48:33] talking about those who have sheep or
[48:34] goats
[48:35] so those that occupation was an
[48:38] abomination
[48:39] to the egyptians now so
[48:43] if they were an abomination to the
[48:45] egyptians
[48:47] how much more do you think it would have
[48:48] been an abomination to the egyptians the
[48:50] offering that the israelites gave
[48:52] on the passover so the very thing that
[48:55] they were detested
[48:57] and they loathed the israelites took the
[48:59] lamb
[49:00] took the blood of that lamb and put it
[49:02] on the door in lintel
[49:03] and no doubt the egyptians when they saw
[49:05] that they said that's disgusting
[49:08] why on earth that i loathe that thing i
[49:10] detest your worship that's a disgusting
[49:12] kind of worship that's not how our
[49:14] church does it
[49:15] that's not what that's not what we
[49:16] believe that's a disgusting word
[49:18] how do you believe that doctrine i mean
[49:20] serpent seed come on
[49:22] one god and many manifestations what do
[49:24] you mean by that baptism in the name of
[49:26] lord jesus christ
[49:27] holiness dress oh that's a horrible
[49:29] thing yeah isn't that what the world
[49:31] thinks
[49:32] they think it's detestable it's
[49:34] disgusting
[49:35] but it's the word that's right right so
[49:38] so the very thing the very thing that
[49:42] the israelites
[49:43] offered that save their firstborn
[49:46] was the very thing that the egyptians
[49:48] detested
[49:49] they did not want to be identified with
[49:52] it
[49:53] they were embarrassed to be around it no
[49:54] doubt they detested it they said it was
[49:56] morally disgusting it was wrong
[49:59] but it gave life it preserved life those
[50:02] who believed it and applied the blood
[50:04] that preserved life amen but that was
[50:07] the attitude of the egyptians
[50:10] to what the israelites did but that was
[50:13] the word made
[50:14] manifest and that was their because
[50:16] their culture trained them a certain way
[50:18] they saw it a certain way because of how
[50:20] the culture trained them
[50:22] we shouldn't look at the word of god
[50:23] according to culture and also even a
[50:26] message
[50:27] culture i'm just quoting quotes and
[50:30] quoting scriptures and no life and going
[50:32] through a motion now we're gonna go
[50:33] beyond that
[50:34] the very god that died on calvary he
[50:36] said i'll be with you even in you to the
[50:38] end of the world
[50:39] and this is what this we know the end
[50:40] time message releases the holy ghost
[50:42] upon the people
[50:43] because there's no more creeds there's
[50:45] no more dogmas holding him back there's
[50:47] nothing to bar him no more but he's free
[50:49] to be released upon the people
[50:50] and that's what we believe we believe
[50:52] we've been restored back to a book of
[50:53] acts
[50:54] church before there was a fall we know
[50:56] we're not restored back to the problems
[50:57] in the church we're not restored back to
[50:59] the division and the
[51:00] and the fussing over legalism we're not
[51:02] restored back to that
[51:03] we're restored back to a people
[51:05] individually led by the holy ghost
[51:07] and god lives in power and manifests
[51:09] himself and the word puts on flesh in
[51:11] those people
[51:12] and they can gather as a group and that
[51:14] same holy ghost will work through that
[51:16] body
[51:16] hallelujah that's what we believe do we
[51:18] not isn't that what the message is
[51:20] meant to produce are we not restored
[51:23] amen
[51:23] hallelujah hallelujah
[51:27] amen you know even so
[51:30] we should never ever have the egyptians
[51:31] attitude to the word
[51:34] i don't want that kind of attitude i
[51:35] want caleb or joshua's attitude let's go
[51:37] take that mountain
[51:38] ah let's go let's go into that promised
[51:40] land amen we've been called out let's go
[51:42] in now hallelujah
[51:44] amen we should be ready to leave
[51:47] amen hallelujah as as as moses told the
[51:51] people of israel get all the living out
[51:52] of your house we're applying the blood
[51:54] get all the unbelief get all the malice
[51:56] get all the strife get all the unbelief
[51:58] get a
[51:58] you know get anything that would hinder
[52:00] the word get it you know anything that's
[52:02] not pleasing to the lord just get rid of
[52:03] the thing apply the blood
[52:05] amen you know peter would say but
[52:08] sanctify the lord god in your hearts
[52:10] and be ready always to give an answer to
[52:13] every man that asks you a reason of the
[52:16] hope that's in you
[52:17] with meekness and fear having a good
[52:20] conscience that whereas they speak evil
[52:22] of you
[52:23] as of evildoers so don't be surprised
[52:25] that people speak evil of you
[52:28] we shouldn't be shocked they spoke evil
[52:31] of the lord jesus and i just asked the
[52:32] question what do you ever do bad
[52:35] and the answer is nothing nothing but
[52:38] yet they spoke evil of them so
[52:39] whereas they speak evil of you as of
[52:41] evildoers well how do they do that they
[52:43] call it a cult
[52:44] they call it bondage they call it
[52:46] brainwashing narrow-mindedness man-made
[52:49] control
[52:50] that's what they call it do they not
[52:52] amen
[52:53] but so so whereas they speak evil of
[52:55] years of evildoers
[52:57] um they may be ashamed that falsely
[53:01] accuse you
[53:02] i mean accuse your good conversation
[53:04] which is your behavior
[53:05] in christ so have a good conscience that
[53:08] whereas they speak evil of you as of
[53:09] evildoers i'm just repeating this
[53:11] that they may be ashamed that falsely
[53:13] accuse you
[53:14] accuse your good conversation which is
[53:16] your behavior and christ so we should
[53:17] have a good
[53:18] we should have a good behavior how we
[53:20] should conduct ourselves should be
[53:22] beyond reproach now let's go back to
[53:26] let's go back to the let's go back to
[53:28] the temple
[53:30] so if the unbelievers in egypt thought
[53:32] that of the
[53:33] of the shadow of the lamb and the
[53:35] passover how much more now what they
[53:37] would think of the real lamb
[53:39] when he came they detested the shadow
[53:42] if they detest a shadow they will to
[53:44] test the reality
[53:46] they can't help it right but if the
[53:49] believers believe the shadow
[53:51] the believers will believe the reality
[53:53] hallelujah
[53:54] and and and we'll get to that kind of
[53:56] thing later but you know
[53:58] here she is now and i look there's an
[54:00] expectation standing way down there
[54:02] along some of them holding a little lamb
[54:05] as they're leading up for their time for
[54:06] their baby their babies wrapped in pink
[54:08] and blue and so forth
[54:10] coming along the line silk needlework
[54:13] so there's all the mothers queueing up
[54:15] to you know to
[54:16] to give their offering for their
[54:18] firstborn
[54:20] but i see standing there a little woman
[54:23] puts your puts you mind of the holy
[54:25] ghost church
[54:26] just a little despised she had a kind of
[54:29] a black name
[54:30] a little virgin stood there about 17
[54:33] years old engaged to a man
[54:34] and she had a baby in her arms some of
[54:37] them say pointing their finger to a look
[54:38] at that baby it isn't wrapped in fine
[54:40] needle cloth
[54:41] but it's just got a swaddling cloth
[54:44] wrapped around it
[54:46] that's that's what they take off the
[54:48] back of a yoke of an ox when they plows
[54:50] there's nothing in the stable to wrap it
[54:52] in
[54:52] so they just took that off and wrapped
[54:54] it i imagine holding two turtle doves a
[54:56] peasant's offering
[54:58] well what was wrapped in swaddling cloth
[55:00] the king of kings and the lord of lords
[55:02] the rest of them stood their space they
[55:04] didn't want to go near there they were
[55:06] good
[55:07] that's about the way people feel today
[55:12] but there was someone else in that there
[55:13] were two people in the temple
[55:16] that were not ashamed or embarrassed
[55:18] when the word came into their
[55:20] presence hallelujah we read about simon
[55:23] imagine standing there you're in prayer
[55:26] i just dramatized it you
[55:28] you're getting up in age you love the
[55:29] lord with all your heart you know the
[55:31] messiah must be coming soon there's been
[55:33] nearly 400 years of silence there's been
[55:35] no prophet
[55:36] and you're just something just
[55:37] something's just in you
[55:39] what are you up to today simon i'm going
[55:41] to go pray
[55:42] hallelujah what are you looking for
[55:44] simon i read about a lamb
[55:47] hallelujah i just read the other day in
[55:49] the scrolls of genesis and you know
[55:50] moses was inspired that you know adam
[55:52] and eve were wrapped up in the animal
[55:54] skins of a
[55:55] you know i believe it was a lamb that
[55:56] where they were wrapped up in and you
[55:58] know the promise was given of the seed
[56:00] of the woman and
[56:00] i'm looking for that seed of the woman
[56:02] hallelujah you know and he would
[56:04] read through all the prophecies you know
[56:05] i mean i mean all the prophecies and
[56:08] yeah maybe just a burn came on his heart
[56:10] i want to see him before i die
[56:12] i've already gone over my three score
[56:14] and ten but but but you know i i just
[56:17] want to see him before i die you know
[56:18] he'd be praying and then
[56:20] i don't know if an angel came to him
[56:21] it's not recorded but but but the holy
[56:23] ghost spoke to him
[56:24] and said simon you're not gonna die
[56:27] until you see the lord's christ
[56:29] how excited he must have been notice he
[56:31] wasn't a little boy that was young that
[56:33] had decades of life ahead of him
[56:34] he was right at the end so he must be
[56:37] real excited boys
[56:38] i could die tomorrow i've had to see him
[56:40] before i die tomorrow
[56:42] hallelujah he would have been excited
[56:43] it's going to happen real soon
[56:45] hallelujah so he was under expectation
[56:48] hallelujah hallelujah if he's not coming
[56:51] today he'll come tomorrow
[56:53] if he's not coming tomorrow he'll come
[56:54] next week hello buddy
[56:56] i'm going to see him hallelujah you know
[56:59] and then he's staying there in the
[57:00] temple all the women are coming through
[57:01] as they were doing and then then the
[57:03] holy ghost moved on his heart
[57:05] simon he's in the building
[57:08] oh leah hello he's in the building
[57:12] and then and then and then he said where
[57:13] is he says just start walking
[57:15] he leads him he goes past one one mother
[57:18] no no no then there's a gap but the lord
[57:22] says yes
[57:23] and this one woman that stand with the
[57:25] baby and everyone else is ashamed to be
[57:26] even near where she is
[57:28] he comes straight picks up the child
[57:30] lord i can now let thy
[57:32] servant depart in peace for mine eyes
[57:34] have seen my salvation
[57:36] hallelujah what the holy ghost promised
[57:38] me is be manifested this day
[57:41] this prophecy has been fulfilled
[57:43] hallelujah
[57:45] and there was another there was someone
[57:46] else in the temple
[57:48] old anna the prophetess you know maybe
[57:51] if we spent a lot of time around the
[57:53] temple you know
[57:54] maybe you know no doubt some people
[57:56] would have some kind of attitude
[57:58] she's just gone a little bit crazy all
[58:01] she does is pray and
[58:02] read and sing to jehovah and just sits
[58:04] there in the corner and
[58:05] always in church and you know
[58:08] she's maybe you know fasting and praying
[58:10] that's all she ever does
[58:12] you know it talks about the lord and you
[58:14] know to the natural mind i think maybe
[58:16] she's just gone deep
[58:17] off on the deep end in her religion
[58:21] but she had something about her now
[58:24] brother brown said she was blind she was
[58:26] 84 years old
[58:28] and um you know nat you know to the
[58:30] natural world she couldn't maybe see
[58:32] much at all
[58:34] but in the spiritual world she could see
[58:38] far greater than the priests she could
[58:40] see far greater than even the religious
[58:42] heads of the country
[58:43] she could see 2020. and when i was
[58:46] reading this i thought
[58:47] god may i be blind to the world and may
[58:49] i see you
[58:50] either because maybe they thought with
[58:52] anna if you really knew what was going
[58:54] on in the world the political climate
[58:56] the economic climate what's happening in
[58:58] the other you know
[58:59] what's going on in rome and everything
[59:01] that the uh he's doing over there and
[59:02] what
[59:03] china's doing what russia's doing you
[59:05] know if you really knew what was going
[59:07] on
[59:08] you wouldn't be sitting in here praying
[59:09] and fasting but she was blinded to that
[59:12] that wasn't the main thing of her life i
[59:14] mean the main thing of her life is
[59:16] i want to worship god i want to pray to
[59:18] him and fast and
[59:19] you know and in the lord that same time
[59:22] that simon was
[59:23] led to where the christ was the holy
[59:25] ghost moved upon
[59:26] anna and you know someone who's blind or
[59:28] can't see very well they've got to be
[59:30] real careful how they walk
[59:32] but i believe she was you know the lord
[59:34] told her stand up
[59:35] stand up anna start walking and she just
[59:37] walked straight this is just me
[59:38] what she's led by the holy ghost all
[59:40] through the line of woman and everything
[59:43] hallelujah and then she saw
[59:47] amen and she came in in that instant
[59:50] giving thanks likewise unto the lord
[59:52] hallelujah but then it wasn't just that
[59:56] she didn't just see the lord and then go
[59:58] sit back down and continue fasting and
[59:59] praying
[1:00:00] but the scripture tells us in luke 2 38
[1:00:02] and spake of him
[1:00:04] to all them that looked for redemption
[1:00:06] in jerusalem
[1:00:07] so here was now a church that had seen a
[1:00:09] woman in the scripture represented
[1:00:11] represents a church right so here is a
[1:00:14] woman that has come in contact with the
[1:00:15] word
[1:00:16] i mean has seen that he's alive she
[1:00:18] doesn't keep it to herself you know
[1:00:20] there's something when you come in
[1:00:21] contact with the living god
[1:00:23] you can't keep it to yourself you've got
[1:00:25] to tell someone about it
[1:00:26] you've got to share it so you've got to
[1:00:28] shout it from the rooftop whatever you
[1:00:30] got to do
[1:00:30] because he becomes so real to you
[1:00:33] hallelujah that you know so she began to
[1:00:36] tell all them that looked for redemption
[1:00:38] in jerusalem maybe
[1:00:39] you know when she was led to the christ
[1:00:41] child she saw that word made flesh
[1:00:43] you know maybe she begin to make a list
[1:00:46] of who she's got to go visit because you
[1:00:49] begin to make plans
[1:00:50] i'm going to go see brother so-and-so's
[1:00:52] sister so and so maybe she'd say well
[1:00:54] levi lives closest to the temple i'll go
[1:00:56] to their family first
[1:00:58] and then and then maybe judah's place is
[1:00:59] on the way to to sister ruth said i'll
[1:01:01] go to rubens after that
[1:01:03] hallelujah he would she would have made
[1:01:05] plans she began to tell
[1:01:06] everyone you know imagine that
[1:01:10] the day before and it comes to your
[1:01:12] house
[1:01:13] how you doing anna oh hallelujah just
[1:01:16] praying and fasting and not just seeking
[1:01:18] god and
[1:01:19] you know praise the lord he's good you
[1:01:20] know hallelujah but then the next day oh
[1:01:23] my god
[1:01:24] hello sheep birthday how are you doing
[1:01:27] anna i've seen him
[1:01:29] he's alive hallelujah where'd you see
[1:01:31] him in the temple
[1:01:33] he's on the grounds right now hallelujah
[1:01:35] we're not looking for him to come he's
[1:01:37] here
[1:01:38] hallelujah oh my
[1:01:41] hallelujah those who are looking for
[1:01:43] redemption
[1:01:45] will see him amen
[1:01:49] so you can't keep it to yourself amen
[1:01:52] you've got to tell somebody
[1:01:54] about it hey we have the greatest
[1:01:56] message that has ever
[1:01:57] struck the earth what's our message he
[1:01:59] lives
[1:02:01] just tell him how you got your candle
[1:02:02] got lit it became more than a book more
[1:02:06] than a tape
[1:02:07] more than a song more than a church
[1:02:09] service
[1:02:10] he became alive he became real
[1:02:14] hallelujah i think i think that's a good
[1:02:17] thing to tell
[1:02:18] people want something real they don't
[1:02:19] want an argument anyone can
[1:02:21] you can spend a million lifetimes just
[1:02:24] back and forth with arguments
[1:02:25] people want to see life they want to see
[1:02:27] something real yes
[1:02:29] hallelujah so
[1:02:32] there's the mad and when we're at it
[1:02:35] and so the man is herod and there's the
[1:02:37] embarrassed ones
[1:02:38] you put that in some category then
[1:02:40] there's the glad we've covered the glad
[1:02:42] now we're going to go to the sad now
[1:02:45] peter peter was a fisherman
[1:02:48] hallelujah he was a fisherman
[1:02:52] one time uh
[1:02:55] one time you know jesus would come along
[1:02:59] and he would be sitting in simon's boat
[1:03:00] he'd be pushed off from the shore so
[1:03:03] jesus could preach the multitude on the
[1:03:05] bank and he began to teach the people
[1:03:09] but then when he had left speaking he
[1:03:12] says to simon
[1:03:13] launch out into the deep and cast your
[1:03:15] nets for for a draw
[1:03:18] and simon said but we've toiled all
[1:03:20] night now we're in luke 5
[1:03:23] and we've taken nothing so we've tried
[1:03:25] it you know
[1:03:26] who's ever been fishing and you see a
[1:03:28] big school of fish yes
[1:03:30] normally you see sea birds and they'll
[1:03:31] take you to where the fish are
[1:03:33] yep so he's basically in my mind he's
[1:03:37] looking over the sea galilee
[1:03:39] he says lord we haven't caught nothing
[1:03:42] i'm not seeing no sign of fish
[1:03:44] but at thy word nevertheless lord at thy
[1:03:46] word
[1:03:47] will put the net down so when he put the
[1:03:50] net down ma'am
[1:03:51] when he put the net down it became
[1:03:52] instantly full of fish
[1:03:54] so what had just happened the creator
[1:03:57] put fish in the net hallelujah
[1:04:01] hallelujah and then when simon saw this
[1:04:04] it says it says and when this was done
[1:04:07] they enclosed a great multitude of
[1:04:09] fishes
[1:04:10] and their net break and they beckon
[1:04:12] under their partners
[1:04:13] which were in the other ship that they
[1:04:16] could not uh
[1:04:17] that that they should come and help them
[1:04:18] and they came and filled both the ships
[1:04:20] so that they begin to sink and when
[1:04:23] simon peter saw it
[1:04:25] it says he fell down at jesus knee
[1:04:27] saying depart from me for i'm a sinful
[1:04:29] man o lord
[1:04:30] he saw this was god made flesh and he's
[1:04:33] saying i'm not worthy
[1:04:35] for me to be in your presence see this
[1:04:38] was the sad but he wasn't going to stay
[1:04:40] sad but he could see his condition
[1:04:43] hallelujah and then but then he began to
[1:04:46] tell them
[1:04:46] i'm going to make you fishers of men so
[1:04:48] i have not brought you into my presence
[1:04:50] just to make you feel
[1:04:51] unworthy that you would leave it i've
[1:04:53] brought you into my presence that i'm
[1:04:54] going to commission you to be fishers of
[1:04:56] men
[1:04:57] that's the same thing with us you know
[1:04:58] the lord doesn't convict us to
[1:05:00] leave us convicted or to leave us
[1:05:02] feeling wrong hallelujah but the law
[1:05:04] convicts us that he will actually
[1:05:05] take that from us and commission us with
[1:05:08] his holy ghost to go out and preach the
[1:05:10] gospel to the world
[1:05:11] hallelujah now we know the bible tells
[1:05:15] us well the prophet tells us that
[1:05:18] god may take his man but the spirit is
[1:05:20] still upon the earth
[1:05:22] and the devil may take his man but that
[1:05:24] same spirit is still upon the earth
[1:05:25] you see it all the way down from genesis
[1:05:27] to now right and now
[1:05:30] um brother braham says and jesus came
[1:05:32] and called satan takes his man
[1:05:35] and you can find them same spirits watch
[1:05:37] their nature
[1:05:38] identify yourself in your present state
[1:05:40] now where you're standing
[1:05:42] with some bible character
[1:05:45] now now to me now to identify yourself
[1:05:49] with some bible character is not you
[1:05:51] looking through the scripture and
[1:05:52] finding a character you like
[1:05:55] and saying it's me but to me it's the
[1:05:57] lord revealing to you who you are in the
[1:05:59] scripture
[1:06:00] by the nature that's in you now as the
[1:06:02] nature was in
[1:06:04] them right and this and what this does
[1:06:07] is give you faith
[1:06:08] that what happened in that bible
[1:06:10] character's life you'll see it
[1:06:12] reproduced
[1:06:13] in your life and then brother and says
[1:06:17] now where would you have been if you
[1:06:18] lived in noah's time where would you
[1:06:20] have been
[1:06:21] where would you have been in the days of
[1:06:22] the lord jesus when he was here on earth
[1:06:24] and his flesh
[1:06:25] what group would you be identified with
[1:06:27] tonight just think of it see
[1:06:29] what group would you have been
[1:06:30] identified with when paul was correcting
[1:06:32] them back there in corinthians
[1:06:34] for the things they were doing what
[1:06:35] group would you be identified with see
[1:06:37] just look back it's a looking glass we
[1:06:40] can see where
[1:06:41] wherever we were we are now
[1:06:44] that's what we've been uh that's what we
[1:06:46] have that's what we would have been back
[1:06:48] there because the spirit that's in us
[1:06:50] now
[1:06:50] identified back there that's the same
[1:06:53] spirit that was
[1:06:54] on them back there he says my
[1:06:58] now bible
[1:07:00] and the message teaches us that all that
[1:07:03] god was he poured into christ
[1:07:05] right and the and jesus christ the lord
[1:07:07] jesus christ is not the second person of
[1:07:09] the godhead
[1:07:10] he's not a lesser god or a minor god or
[1:07:13] the second person
[1:07:14] of the trinity but he is all of god
[1:07:17] manifested in a human body
[1:07:18] he is the godhead paul would say in
[1:07:22] corinthian i mean colossians 1
[1:07:23] 19 for please the father in him should
[1:07:26] all fullness dwell
[1:07:28] right so that's when why brother braham
[1:07:29] could take and he takes other scriptures
[1:07:31] when he says with the baptism of
[1:07:33] of of of jesus by john it says that
[1:07:36] that that god said that i'm pleased
[1:07:39] yeah i'm pleased to dwell in him right
[1:07:41] speaking of jesus
[1:07:43] because it please the father in him
[1:07:44] should all fullness dwell so not a part
[1:07:46] of god was in jesus
[1:07:47] all was in him colossians 2 and 9 for in
[1:07:51] him dwelleth all the fullness of the
[1:07:52] godhead bodily
[1:07:54] so therefore now if we have the holy
[1:07:55] ghost right now
[1:07:57] that same holy ghost has been anointing
[1:07:59] prophets and believers since the
[1:08:00] beginning of time by measure
[1:08:02] but in the lord jesus it was without
[1:08:04] measure
[1:08:05] now that's why people thought that he
[1:08:08] was one of the prophets he would say in
[1:08:10] uh matthew 16 he would ask his disciples
[1:08:13] who to mean say i the son of man
[1:08:14] am and they'd say well you're john the
[1:08:16] baptist you're
[1:08:18] elias or jeremiah one of the prophets
[1:08:20] because how they saw jesus act they
[1:08:22] could
[1:08:22] they could say i've read about that
[1:08:24] somewhere oh that's in jeremiah's life
[1:08:26] or
[1:08:26] i've read about the summer i see it in
[1:08:28] moses or i see it in elijah you know
[1:08:30] so because because they had god and
[1:08:32] portion but now all of the old
[1:08:34] you can say all the old testament
[1:08:35] prophets that was god pouring out by
[1:08:36] measure is now all of it
[1:08:38] in one body in in christ jesus now
[1:08:42] brother brown would say perseverance he
[1:08:44] says look at christ he is the fullness
[1:08:45] of god god dwelled in christ without
[1:08:47] measure
[1:08:48] he had the spirit without measure we
[1:08:50] have it by measure but if i got a
[1:08:51] spoonful of water out of the lake out
[1:08:53] there or the ocean
[1:08:55] so if i went and got got some of the
[1:08:56] pacific ocean or the cook straight
[1:08:58] if i got a bit of that water right see
[1:09:01] see the ocean that was in christ if i
[1:09:02] got a spoonful of water
[1:09:04] just be a spoonful of water out of it
[1:09:06] but the same chemicals that's in the
[1:09:08] entire ocean is in that spoonful
[1:09:10] it's not as much but the same chemicals
[1:09:13] and if we have the spirit of god in us
[1:09:15] it's the same works in the same spirit
[1:09:17] the same manifestation see
[1:09:19] then you base your faith upon that and
[1:09:21] when you see that it
[1:09:22] is then you can be perseverant you know
[1:09:25] where you're standing so he says now
[1:09:26] when you see that same spirit that you
[1:09:29] read about in the scripture
[1:09:30] living how it lived hallelujah you see
[1:09:33] it in your life
[1:09:34] he says then you can base your faith
[1:09:36] upon that because you see your
[1:09:37] experience
[1:09:38] lines up with god's bible because of the
[1:09:40] spirit that wrote the bibles in you you
[1:09:42] cannot deny that word
[1:09:43] and your life will line up with that
[1:09:45] bible even if you do not know the
[1:09:46] scripture from verse to verse to verse
[1:09:48] the nature in you will be the same as
[1:09:50] what paul was writing so
[1:09:51] you know as paul would say we are
[1:09:53] written epistles read unknown of all
[1:09:55] means the epistles i'm writing to you
[1:09:57] he's saying
[1:09:57] you are manifesting those epistles how
[1:10:00] was that because the spirit that
[1:10:01] inspired him is now in the believer
[1:10:03] causing that word to live through the
[1:10:04] believer hallelujah so now we can base
[1:10:07] our faith on that if that spirit is
[1:10:09] within us
[1:10:09] and we can be perseverant now if we look
[1:10:12] through the scriptures
[1:10:14] as i said before the same spirit that
[1:10:16] was on david to kill goliath is in you
[1:10:20] the same spirit that was on moses to
[1:10:22] call those plagues and bring deliverance
[1:10:24] is on you
[1:10:25] amen at the same spirit that was on
[1:10:27] elijah to go on a rapture as a you
[1:10:29] hallelujah the same spirit that was in
[1:10:32] elisha to bring the dead back to
[1:10:34] life is in you amen the same spirit that
[1:10:36] was on
[1:10:37] moses is on you or noah is in you
[1:10:39] hallelujah
[1:10:40] right the saints brothers on david is a
[1:10:43] new and you can bring that all the way
[1:10:44] down through
[1:10:45] you know into the new testament now and
[1:10:47] and sirs we would see jesus
[1:10:49] so i'm just speeding up a bit because i
[1:10:50] feel like we're running out of time
[1:10:53] okay now we see when man was anointed
[1:10:56] like joseph he betrayed christ
[1:10:58] where moses was anointed he betrayed
[1:11:00] christ when david was anointed he
[1:11:02] portrayed
[1:11:03] christ all leading up to christ and he
[1:11:06] was the fullness of the word
[1:11:07] the word was made manifest in him he was
[1:11:10] the complete anointed one they had it by
[1:11:12] portions we have it by portions he was
[1:11:14] the anointed one
[1:11:16] the entire plan of god laid in him god's
[1:11:18] plan
[1:11:19] before the foundation the world to
[1:11:20] redeem a lost world was in him he was
[1:11:23] the word
[1:11:23] and he still is the word the same
[1:11:25] yesterday today and forever remember
[1:11:27] he came to the fathers through the
[1:11:28] prophets uh
[1:11:30] made himself known through the prophets
[1:11:32] and in this last day through his son
[1:11:34] christ jesus
[1:11:34] he was god made manifest so he says it's
[1:11:37] christ it was christ in moses
[1:11:39] it was christ and david we all know this
[1:11:41] don't we it's christ and elijah christ
[1:11:43] and isaiah you know christ and ruth
[1:11:45] christ and esther all it was christ
[1:11:47] revealing himself now
[1:11:48] but now it is christ in you the hope of
[1:11:51] glory
[1:11:52] otherwise they were portraying something
[1:11:54] so we are portraying
[1:11:55] the same thing but the reality
[1:11:57] hallelujah so now as
[1:11:58] as as the apostle paul would say i mean
[1:12:01] even the mystery that has been hit from
[1:12:03] ages and from generations but now is
[1:12:05] made manifest to his saints
[1:12:07] to whom god would make known what is the
[1:12:10] riches of the glory of this mystery
[1:12:11] among the gentiles
[1:12:13] which is christ in you the hope of glory
[1:12:16] hallelujah so as i said that same spirit
[1:12:18] that anointed david to kill goliath
[1:12:20] that's how he spirits on me
[1:12:22] hallelujah the same one that was on
[1:12:24] solomon to build the temples in me
[1:12:26] amen hallelujah is that right if it's
[1:12:28] the same holy ghost remember
[1:12:29] it may not be the same magnitude of the
[1:12:32] holy ghost but it's just like as i said
[1:12:34] i can take a teaspoon of the cooked
[1:12:35] straight and it's the same chemicals in
[1:12:37] that water as in the whole body of water
[1:12:40] hallelujah same thing so now if that
[1:12:42] same spirit
[1:12:44] was in moses as in me then if then if he
[1:12:47] was commissioned to deliver a people
[1:12:49] then that same commission of deliverance
[1:12:50] is in us
[1:12:52] hallelujah at that same anointing that
[1:12:54] took elijah i know i'm repeating myself
[1:12:56] but i want you
[1:12:56] know what do you think about it that's
[1:12:58] right you know the whole you know we
[1:13:00] if we just put our lives completely into
[1:13:02] god's hands
[1:13:04] god will win the victory why because
[1:13:06] he's won it before
[1:13:08] you know basically he'd say i've been
[1:13:10] through this before
[1:13:11] i know how this works this is not my
[1:13:13] first battle this is not my first
[1:13:15] engagement with the enemy i know how he
[1:13:17] works
[1:13:18] i built him i studied him
[1:13:21] i know his tactics real well i know what
[1:13:23] he's going to do before he thinks of
[1:13:25] even doing it
[1:13:26] and before he implements it i know
[1:13:27] exactly when he's going to do it i'm not
[1:13:29] guessing
[1:13:30] remember he knows exactly what the
[1:13:32] devil's going to do when he's going to
[1:13:33] do it
[1:13:34] right he's not and it's not a guess you
[1:13:36] know a room of era
[1:13:38] you know like different militaries
[1:13:40] around the world they have their spy
[1:13:41] networks they can
[1:13:43] and and they can make an educated guess
[1:13:45] this is what they're going to do
[1:13:47] and sometimes it can be very accurate
[1:13:49] sometimes it'll be way off
[1:13:51] god is always completely accurate so if
[1:13:54] we could just really put our lives in
[1:13:55] his hands he'd say i've got this
[1:13:58] i've got your battle hallelujah i've got
[1:14:00] this i've been through it before i know
[1:14:02] what he's going to try and do to you
[1:14:03] i mean i i i looked you know i saw it
[1:14:06] happen before the foundation world but i
[1:14:08] looked through time
[1:14:09] amen so i've got this hell if we can
[1:14:12] just trust in god god's got this
[1:14:14] amen he's got this bride remember
[1:14:15] remember the promises we read about in
[1:14:17] the message and
[1:14:18] you know and in the scripture we didn't
[1:14:21] make the promises
[1:14:22] sometimes we say how is this ever going
[1:14:24] to happen well well it's not actually on
[1:14:26] our ability to to make it be fulfilled
[1:14:30] hallelujah if god gave the promise he's
[1:14:33] the one obligated to the promise
[1:14:35] he's the one who actually has to fulfill
[1:14:36] it it wasn't an abraham's ability to
[1:14:39] have isaac
[1:14:40] abraham wasn't the one who gave the
[1:14:41] promise god gave the promise
[1:14:43] therefore he could rejoice and count
[1:14:45] everything but not and just take god at
[1:14:47] his word
[1:14:48] hallelujah so the anointing that was on
[1:14:50] abraham was in me so i can believe for
[1:14:51] the impossible
[1:14:52] i can believe and rejoice in things as
[1:14:55] though they
[1:14:56] are even though they may appear not to
[1:14:57] be yes sir
[1:14:59] hallelujah you know i was um well i'm
[1:15:01] just thinking about sunday but you know
[1:15:03] brother braham says that you know god's
[1:15:05] word is like a great big arcade
[1:15:08] you know and then he also says that
[1:15:11] faith in the finished work of calvary
[1:15:14] is the key that unlocks the door to
[1:15:16] every divine promise
[1:15:17] now imagine imagine now if i had
[1:15:21] the key to your favorite store i had i
[1:15:24] don't have keys on me but imagine if i
[1:15:25] had that
[1:15:26] and i gave it to you and said just say
[1:15:29] if your favorite store is bunnings or
[1:15:31] mitre 10 or whatever it is whatever toys
[1:15:33] you want
[1:15:34] you know if you really believe that
[1:15:36] these were the keys to that store you
[1:15:38] would put your faith into action and get
[1:15:39] the keys
[1:15:40] but then you wouldn't just sit back and
[1:15:41] say i've got the keys you would be
[1:15:43] rejoicing
[1:15:45] all the way to the store and you'd be
[1:15:47] getting imagining in your mind
[1:15:49] what you're going to do when you get
[1:15:50] there oh there so maybe maybe before
[1:15:52] you'd see man i want to try that right
[1:15:54] on lawnmower i wonder how fast it goes
[1:15:56] you've got the keys in the store
[1:15:57] remember so as you're driving then
[1:15:59] you're imagining how fast it's going to
[1:16:00] go
[1:16:01] but then it but so so it goes to an
[1:16:03] expectation
[1:16:04] to a reality hallelujah and you don't
[1:16:07] just drive to the store and look at the
[1:16:08] store
[1:16:09] you open the door and you go in right
[1:16:12] and then you would get that right on
[1:16:13] lawnmower
[1:16:14] and and at first you're excited it's
[1:16:17] going to happen because remember you've
[1:16:18] got the keys to it yeah
[1:16:19] see you're excited and then you get on
[1:16:21] the thing and you bring to experience
[1:16:23] what you've been imagining in your mind
[1:16:25] so it's no longer just an expectation
[1:16:26] it's a reality this thing really goes
[1:16:28] that fast
[1:16:29] hallelujah then maybe you wanted to use
[1:16:31] a nail gun you get the nail gun you know
[1:16:32] maybe shoot yeah shoot the breeze but oh
[1:16:34] boy
[1:16:34] and then you go and build something
[1:16:36] things you've been imagining now it's no
[1:16:38] longer just
[1:16:38] ink on paper something that's imagined
[1:16:40] now you're actually doing it
[1:16:42] harley or your whatever's in that store
[1:16:44] and you wouldn't just stop with one
[1:16:45] thing
[1:16:46] imagine if we're outside you running
[1:16:48] we're here yeah right on lawn mower or
[1:16:50] whatever just hurting around there stops
[1:16:52] and then you walk out all satisfied you
[1:16:55] say what's wrong with you
[1:16:57] you got the whole store yes no no i'm
[1:16:59] good no no no well give me the key set
[1:17:01] you know but it's same kind of thing we
[1:17:03] don't want to just be satisfied with
[1:17:04] experience one promise of god
[1:17:07] every promise of god is in the arcade
[1:17:11] and god has given us the key of faith
[1:17:14] you know
[1:17:14] some some promises may be a little
[1:17:16] harder to get you know i think of you
[1:17:17] brother could be in about
[1:17:18] you know forklifts and getting stuff on
[1:17:20] high high things you know
[1:17:22] you can't just go and pick that up and
[1:17:23] open it you gotta get the fork lift out
[1:17:25] and you know
[1:17:26] pull it up and get it down but it's like
[1:17:28] faith you know
[1:17:29] you know if you don't have the faith to
[1:17:31] get it you say lord increase my faith
[1:17:33] that i'll get it because remember it's
[1:17:34] mine
[1:17:35] it may be out of reach maybe i can't get
[1:17:36] it down with my physical ability
[1:17:38] but i've got the forklift of faith to go
[1:17:40] get it
[1:17:41] hallelujah so now if the word is a big
[1:17:43] arcade every
[1:17:44] now you just think about every promise
[1:17:46] that's in the bible healing's in the

[1:19:43] if that's the way i say lord
[1:19:44] may we be a people that is
[1:19:47] that that that is so hungry or addicted
[1:19:50] as brother john andy's preached mary so
[1:19:52] addicted amen that we want to see every
[1:19:54] divine promise manifested
[1:19:55] oh jesus he's given us the key yes amen
[1:19:59] hallelujah that's all free
[1:20:04] anyway this book now so it's christ in
[1:20:06] us the hope of glory
[1:20:08] amen and this is a so now he's in modern
[1:20:10] events may clear by prophecy
[1:20:13] now this book is a book of prophecy it's
[1:20:16] it's believers are commanded to honor it
[1:20:18] and to read it
[1:20:19] and to believe its author for every word
[1:20:21] that's written in there must come to
[1:20:22] pass everything that's been promised
[1:20:24] has to come to pass because it's jesus
[1:20:26] christ in each age
[1:20:28] the same yesterday it was jesus christ
[1:20:30] was a noah was
[1:20:31] it was jesus christ of moses it was
[1:20:33] jesus christ and david it was jesus
[1:20:34] christ and joseph
[1:20:36] as jesus christ the same yesterday today
[1:20:38] and forever and as jesus christ
[1:20:40] among his people today doing the things
[1:20:42] that he promised he would do in this age
[1:20:44] is jesus christ
[1:20:45] i mean so what are you really going on
[1:20:48] about here
[1:20:50] i say in order for us to see who we are
[1:20:53] in the scripture
[1:20:54] the reason for it rather is not just to
[1:20:56] fill our head with types and shadows
[1:20:59] that is not the purpose of seeing
[1:21:01] yourself in the scripture
[1:21:02] but the purpose of that is the lord so
[1:21:05] so it's good to study those things out
[1:21:07] and i encourage you to go study them out
[1:21:08] but it can't just stay in your top two
[1:21:10] inches but it's got it the lord must
[1:21:12] quicken it to our hearts
[1:21:14] that we would see our nature now
[1:21:17] and the believers back there i mean so
[1:21:19] we can see
[1:21:20] if you if you look at the bride she is
[1:21:24] revealed
[1:21:24] in all the types of the old testament
[1:21:26] just like christ was
[1:21:28] so is the bride i mean so we can see
[1:21:31] christ and david but but we can see
[1:21:33] ourselves in david right we can see
[1:21:35] christ and joshua but we can see
[1:21:36] ourselves in joshua
[1:21:38] amen we can see christ and moses but
[1:21:40] then we can see ourselves and moses how
[1:21:41] do you see ourselves and moses well
[1:21:43] moses came to a point where where god
[1:21:45] basically told him i'm going to wipe off
[1:21:46] israel i'm going to start with you
[1:21:48] and he threw himself in the gap saying
[1:21:49] lord blot my name out
[1:21:51] and said and that was christ in moses
[1:21:53] interceding standing in the gap
[1:21:55] for an unbelieving people isn't that how
[1:21:57] we should be
[1:21:59] hallelujah all we can see we can see
[1:22:01] that nature in esther
[1:22:03] or in ruth or in the shunaway woman or
[1:22:06] any believer amen that because their
[1:22:10] lives
[1:22:11] see if you have that same nature in you
[1:22:14] that same remember christ and all them
[1:22:15] is in you
[1:22:16] then you and then the lord identifies
[1:22:19] who you are in the scripture then the
[1:22:20] outcome of that believer will be your
[1:22:22] outcome
[1:22:23] and then things that you do not see will
[1:22:25] begin to actually your
[1:22:26] your life will begin to be changed to
[1:22:29] manifest that outcome
[1:22:31] amen hallelujah and that will give you
[1:22:34] and
[1:22:34] and even just to see yourself as esther
[1:22:36] that should give you such a
[1:22:38] joy in your heart because the end of
[1:22:41] esther wasn't
[1:22:42] she was dead and haman was king no haman
[1:22:45] was dead and
[1:22:46] esther had a great victory amen
[1:22:48] hallelujah
[1:22:50] you know so it should give us such a
[1:22:51] revelation
[1:22:53] and that's why when i was thinking about
[1:22:54] this i said lord
[1:22:56] show me is enoch in the scripture
[1:22:59] hallelujah don't you want to see
[1:23:00] wouldn't you wouldn't be awesome if the
[1:23:02] lord said
[1:23:03] you're enoch amen we are he not carly
[1:23:05] but may just anchor down in here amen
[1:23:08] hallelujah i mean their lives were a
[1:23:10] manifestation of the word
[1:23:12] because they were part of that word amen
[1:23:14] amen so we are part of that word too
[1:23:18] amen he was being revealed in their
[1:23:20] lives and he's but
[1:23:21] he's being revealed in our lives now
[1:23:25] you say well how does this happen today
[1:23:28] well brother brown would tell a story of
[1:23:31] a
[1:23:32] of an african-american woman that had a
[1:23:34] son
[1:23:35] and that son went out with the wrong
[1:23:37] crowd ended up with a
[1:23:39] transmitted disease and was dying on a
[1:23:41] bed who knows the story we all know that
[1:23:43] story
[1:23:44] now here she is she's a godly woman no
[1:23:47] doubt
[1:23:48] she took her son to church tried to
[1:23:50] raise him in the love and fear of the
[1:23:51] lord
[1:23:52] but he got in amongst the wrong crowd
[1:23:54] and he ends up in the spot
[1:23:56] and something was inspired on her heart
[1:23:59] i'm like the shunamat woman
[1:24:03] so now the lord shows her she's the
[1:24:05] shunamart woman but then she begins to
[1:24:07] ask a very
[1:24:08] good question if i'm the shunammite
[1:24:10] woman where is my elisha
[1:24:12] where is my elijah so now now if you
[1:24:15] think about this
[1:24:16] before the lord ever showed her she's
[1:24:18] the shunammite
[1:24:19] then the natural course that would have
[1:24:21] happened is he would have died
[1:24:24] right because there was no medical help
[1:24:25] for him he was beyond
[1:24:27] so the natural course of it was he was
[1:24:29] going to die and her great burden was
[1:24:31] i don't want to see my boy lost but now
[1:24:34] what happens is she's reading the
[1:24:35] scripture or she's in prayer and the
[1:24:37] lord puts on her heart you're the
[1:24:38] shunammite
[1:24:39] so now the whole course of events are
[1:24:41] going to be interrupted
[1:24:43] you see the devil wanted to take his
[1:24:44] life before his time
[1:24:46] but god said no you can't take his life
[1:24:48] so now
[1:24:49] he put faith in her heart he put a
[1:24:51] revelation in her heart
[1:24:53] i'm the shunammite but then she asked
[1:24:55] the question well where is my elisha now
[1:24:57] i just want you to think about this the
[1:24:59] the shunammite woman in the old
[1:25:01] testament knew where elisha was
[1:25:03] when when when her boy got heat stroke
[1:25:06] or whatever he said oh my head in the
[1:25:07] field and lay on his lap and then
[1:25:09] her lap and then died you know she said
[1:25:11] to the servant sadler mule
[1:25:13] we're going to where we're going to
[1:25:15] where he is but then in the new
[1:25:17] testament so that's the shadow
[1:25:19] but in the new testament she didn't even
[1:25:21] know where elisha was she didn't even
[1:25:22] know who her life she didn't even know
[1:25:24] not only where he was but who he was was
[1:25:26] he even there
[1:25:28] harlow so her faith was even greater
[1:25:29] than the old testament one then because
[1:25:31] the
[1:25:31] reality is always greater than the
[1:25:33] shadow the shadow is pointing to
[1:25:34] something
[1:25:35] other so there she is i'm the shunammite
[1:25:37] woman
[1:25:38] but lord where is my elisha and then he
[1:25:41] just happens to be upon the earth see
[1:25:42] that's why the lord put that on his
[1:25:44] heart
[1:25:44] put that on her heart rather and then so
[1:25:46] now brother branham is just traveling
[1:25:48] around going on meetings but then a
[1:25:50] storm begins to
[1:25:51] break out remember this is her face
[1:25:54] because it's been revealed to her that
[1:25:55] she's a shunamite
[1:25:57] causing a storm to ground a plane and
[1:25:59] there has to be a delay when that
[1:26:01] flight's going to be taken off
[1:26:02] and so brother brown's just walking down
[1:26:04] the street and you know singing and
[1:26:06] you know and he's looking at a window
[1:26:07] something hunting things or something
[1:26:09] and then and then a voice just says to
[1:26:10] him start walking
[1:26:13] why because there's a woman actually the
[1:26:16] more
[1:26:16] that that morning in the early hours
[1:26:18] actually had a vision or a dream
[1:26:20] that a man in a you know carrying a a a
[1:26:23] a
[1:26:24] briefcase in your dress a certain way
[1:26:26] with a hat would be who was who looked
[1:26:28] exactly like brother brown was walking
[1:26:29] past her
[1:26:30] past her front gate why did this all
[1:26:33] transpire because the lord gave her a
[1:26:34] revelation she's the schumann
[1:26:37] hallelujah jesus you we should we should
[1:26:39] look at the treasure in our hearts
[1:26:41] what's that treasure
[1:26:42] he said you're the bride a man didn't
[1:26:44] tell you that
[1:26:45] preacher didn't tell you that even the
[1:26:47] prophet didn't tell you that god told
[1:26:48] you that
[1:26:49] either he may have used a preacher or a
[1:26:51] prophet or a church but god had to
[1:26:52] inspire that to you
[1:26:54] and for you to realize i misses jesus
[1:26:58] hallelujah by his predestination grace i
[1:27:01] am one of them
[1:27:02] hallelujah but so so now that shunammite
[1:27:05] woman
[1:27:06] she got that revelation then god changed
[1:27:08] the whole outcome of that situation
[1:27:10] to ground a plane that had elisha on it
[1:27:13] gave her a vision or a dream that he was
[1:27:15] going to walk past the gate and then so
[1:27:17] she's there before dawn waiting
[1:27:19] hallelujah and then and then brother
[1:27:21] brown was walking and it's actually
[1:27:23] apparently quite a few miles from where
[1:27:24] the lord told him to start walking
[1:27:26] and where but the lord said just just
[1:27:28] start walking and he just starts walking
[1:27:30] on and then he
[1:27:32] he starts walking past her house and and
[1:27:34] she just says good morning parson
[1:27:37] and then she's and then he stops and
[1:27:39] says how did you know i was a person
[1:27:41] he says well i was praying and and and i
[1:27:44] saw you walking down the street but
[1:27:45] where's your briefcase
[1:27:46] he left it at the hotel wherever he was
[1:27:48] hallelujah
[1:27:49] this is all transpiring because the lord
[1:27:51] gave her a revelation of who she was in
[1:27:53] the scripture
[1:27:54] that's what i wanted to see this is this
[1:27:55] is not just a nice idea this is a
[1:27:57] reality
[1:27:58] hallelujah and then so and then and
[1:28:00] then he came into the house and he said
[1:28:02] well i've been in king's palace but it's
[1:28:04] nothing compared to this
[1:28:05] hallelujah and then and then he you know
[1:28:08] she began to tell him
[1:28:09] you know what was going on in her son
[1:28:11] and you know he was there on the
[1:28:13] bed crying it's getting dark in here or
[1:28:15] it's dark in here and you know
[1:28:16] and then and then and then he said to
[1:28:19] her
[1:28:20] well auntie why don't you lead us in
[1:28:22] prayer
[1:28:23] and she began to pray and the prophet
[1:28:25] said and you could tell
[1:28:27] she knew who she was talking to
[1:28:29] hallelujah
[1:28:31] no and then and then he and then and
[1:28:33] then and then and then she prays
[1:28:36] and then and then the prophet grabs him
[1:28:37] by the feet and then prays
[1:28:39] he says lord i don't really know why i'm
[1:28:41] here but you know i believe it's because
[1:28:42] of this and this is why i'm here
[1:28:44] and then immediately he starts saying
[1:28:46] it's getting light in here
[1:28:48] so he was on he was on his deathbed but
[1:28:50] then life began to come into his body
[1:28:51] again
[1:28:52] hallelujah and then brother brown said
[1:28:54] soon after that he was healthy and well
[1:28:56] and and and he just walked out of the
[1:28:58] house got a cab and went to the airport
[1:29:00] and it was the last call for his flight
[1:29:02] but the it wasn't the prophet's faith
[1:29:05] that that that
[1:29:06] turned the course of that boy from death
[1:29:08] to life
[1:29:09] it wasn't his faith it was her faith and
[1:29:12] that faith was because of a revelation
[1:29:14] i know who this is who you are in the
[1:29:16] scripture
[1:29:17] hallelujah amen so i'm just gonna i'm
[1:29:20] just gonna leave it with that i'll say
[1:29:22] now if she
[1:29:22] if you if you think about that now she
[1:29:25] had a revelation
[1:29:26] i'm not well you're repeating yourself
[1:29:28] no to me this is well maybe i'm very
[1:29:30] simple person but to me this is
[1:29:32] i like it if she could see herself
[1:29:35] if she could see herself as a shooter
[1:29:37] might and then the whole course of life
[1:29:39] changed because it was now it wasn't in
[1:29:42] the old testament no more it was living
[1:29:44] and her faith actually caused events to
[1:29:46] change
[1:29:47] hallelujah that her elisha would come
[1:29:51] mean now how much more you and i if you
[1:29:53] see yourself as david or
[1:29:54] you know you see yourself as joseph or
[1:29:56] whoever it may be in the scripture
[1:29:58] then your whole life will be actually
[1:29:59] changed
[1:30:01] based around who god shows you you are
[1:30:03] in the old testament hallelujah even
[1:30:06] even those in the new testament
[1:30:08] yes sir hallelujah why because that that
[1:30:10] revelation will change the outcome of
[1:30:12] your life
[1:30:13] amen hallelujah amen that's why we can
[1:30:17] rejoice when we read about the woman the
[1:30:18] wow
[1:30:19] or the philippian jailer whoever it may
[1:30:21] be you know god inspires you that's you
[1:30:24] well if that's the case hallelujah
[1:30:28] where's the others there
[1:30:31] hallelujah brother brown was saying and
[1:30:33] and i'll just finish with this quote
[1:30:35] then if jesus defeated satan upon
[1:30:37] faith knowing who he was he knew who he
[1:30:40] was that's why he defeated satan
[1:30:42] he was a predestinated creature he says
[1:30:45] are you ready congregation says amen
[1:30:47] what about the predestinated bride of
[1:30:50] jesus christ now
[1:30:51] you believe the bride is predestinated
[1:30:53] the predestined bride of christ now the
[1:30:56] church the word seed with everything
[1:30:57] that god promised to put in the church
[1:31:00] in it right now it's in it now
[1:31:02] everything's in order the holy spirit
[1:31:04] has been given
[1:31:05] the seed has been sown the evening light
[1:31:07] has been shining
[1:31:08] the sign of sodom that jesus promises
[1:31:10] here in malachi 4
[1:31:12] a predestinated church he says o devil
[1:31:14] church of living god here and on tape
[1:31:16] too do you know where you stand
[1:31:19] amen do you know where you stand seated
[1:31:21] in heavenly places in christ jesus join
[1:31:23] here with christ
[1:31:24] blameless sinless redeemed by the blood
[1:31:27] of the lamb
[1:31:28] do you know you're in that condition yes
[1:31:30] remember faith is not about how you feel
[1:31:32] faith is not about what you see
[1:31:34] faith is not emotion amen faith is a
[1:31:36] revelation in the word of god
[1:31:38] so you may be feeling the worst you know
[1:31:40] is it incredible
[1:31:41] we read about the resurrection the
[1:31:43] disciples aren't skipping along
[1:31:44] rejoicing
[1:31:46] they're having the worst day of their
[1:31:48] life their world had fallen apart
[1:31:50] had it not the messiah they believed he
[1:31:53] was going to be the messiah was dead on
[1:31:55] the cross
[1:31:56] the the ministers that hold themselves
[1:31:58] up in some room the church treasurer
[1:32:00] committed suicide
[1:32:01] the whole thing fell apart and they're
[1:32:03] walking along
[1:32:04] sad the one they loved was murdered
[1:32:08] but then he came resurrected
[1:32:15] the greatest morning that there's ever
[1:32:16] been better than the first morning
[1:32:19] this is a better morning because it was
[1:32:21] a dual sun rising wasn't just a natural
[1:32:23] sun coming up but now the son was risen
[1:32:26] i mean a season of redemption had come a
[1:32:28] season of grace and salvation had come
[1:32:30] hallelujah and they're walking along
[1:32:32] broken now do you think they were full
[1:32:33] of faith
[1:32:35] no their world had fallen apart but yet
[1:32:38] here comes the resurrected messiah and
[1:32:41] he starts walking with them
[1:32:43] he says what's been going why are you
[1:32:45] sad and they're actually surprised what
[1:32:47] do you mean
[1:32:48] don't you know what's going on have you
[1:32:50] are you a stranger in the city
[1:32:52] we're in luke 24 you know where we are
[1:32:53] oh look remember brother ram says
[1:32:55] monster made clear by prophecy he says
[1:32:56] that's a prophecy
[1:32:58] and then so they're walking along broken
[1:33:00] sad
[1:33:01] here he comes doesn't reveal who he is
[1:33:05] and and they begin to fill him in with
[1:33:07] what's going on
[1:33:09] and then he says to them oh fools and
[1:33:10] slow of heart to believe
[1:33:12] the resurrected lord is walking with
[1:33:14] them and he opens the scripture
[1:33:17] and he opens the scripture and he opens
[1:33:19] the scripture to them did he fulfill
[1:33:20] this now let's turn here to psalms did
[1:33:22] he fulfill this let's go to isaiah 53
[1:33:24] was he wounded zechariah
[1:33:27] pissed my hands of my feet was his hands
[1:33:29] pissed you know was he buried among the
[1:33:31] rich he'd go to all the prophecies
[1:33:33] concerning himself
[1:33:34] hallelujah but then the reason he went
[1:33:37] with them
[1:33:38] do you think they were feeling happy
[1:33:39] their hearts began to burn within them
[1:33:42] but they're still sad because their
[1:33:44] world had fallen apart
[1:33:46] but then he went with them and opened
[1:33:48] the scripture
[1:33:49] and walked with them until they realized
[1:33:52] he was resurrected
[1:33:53] and the whole reason that he did that is
[1:33:55] because they were part of that
[1:33:56] resurrection
[1:33:57] it wasn't just him that rose remember
[1:33:59] they had to go to pentecost
[1:34:00] and be resurrected from a life of sin
[1:34:02] and death to be alive in christ
[1:34:04] so he went with them until they saw who
[1:34:07] he was
[1:34:08] and that he that they were part of that
[1:34:10] same resurrection
[1:34:11] what's happened today sometimes we'll
[1:34:14] feel rapture ready
[1:34:15] we can be in the sunday night at camp
[1:34:17] and we can just literally feel like
[1:34:19] we're just going to walk into
[1:34:20] eternity and you know if the devil came
[1:34:23] in that place we're just going to chop
[1:34:25] his head off and you know
[1:34:26] you know bring it on you know you feel
[1:34:28] 10 million feet tall and
[1:34:29] twice as round and you know but
[1:34:33] hallelujah but you know but then but
[1:34:35] then that's not
[1:34:36] necessarily the condition will be when
[1:34:38] these bodies are changed
[1:34:40] because god is wanting them to see him
[1:34:42] wanting us to see it's not how you feel
[1:34:44] they felt heartbroken but yet they were
[1:34:48] part of the resurrection
[1:34:49] that feeling they had in their heart did
[1:34:51] not stop the resurrected lord walking
[1:34:53] with them and opening the scripture to
[1:34:54] them
[1:34:55] and showing them who he was in the dark
[1:34:57] resurrection it didn't hinder him one
[1:34:59] bit
[1:34:59] because it's not about how we feel it's
[1:35:01] who we are in him that matters
[1:35:03] hallelujah so now says i say faith is
[1:35:05] not a feeling
[1:35:06] faith is revelation i feel full of faith
[1:35:09] today i feel empty of faith today
[1:35:11] hold on what's this that's right yeah
[1:35:13] you know it's not like
[1:35:14] well now i'm full and now i'm empty like
[1:35:16] food
[1:35:18] it's not that kind of thing but you know
[1:35:20] so we shouldn't go by how we feel
[1:35:21] remember they were broken-hearted
[1:35:24] and the word came open to them like no
[1:35:26] one else had been been open to
[1:35:28] and they saw it was the resurrected lord
[1:35:30] hallelujah and this message is that same
[1:35:32] jesus
[1:35:34] walking with you that's why he's a
[1:35:36] personal god he opens the bible to you
[1:35:38] it becomes more than stories more than a
[1:35:39] nice idea the message becomes more than
[1:35:42] just doctrine and quotes and
[1:35:43] becomes a it's messiah the word is
[1:35:45] messiah
[1:35:46] and he opens it to you because why does
[1:35:48] he show it to you because he wants you
[1:35:49] to know
[1:35:50] you're part of the rapture hallelujah
[1:35:54] he doesn't he he hasn't come just to
[1:35:56] excite our you know
[1:35:57] give us a religion tickle our religious
[1:35:59] itch or however you want to put it
[1:36:00] you know but he come to walk with you
[1:36:02] that he would you would realize
[1:36:04] in spite of your ups and downs feeling
[1:36:06] full of faith feeling no faith feeling
[1:36:07] happy feeling sad
[1:36:09] feeling glad or feeling mad whatever
[1:36:11] feeling you have he's walking with you
[1:36:13] to show you
