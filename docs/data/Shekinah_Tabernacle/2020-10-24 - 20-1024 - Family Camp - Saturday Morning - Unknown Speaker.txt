i shall not be [Music] [Music] hallelujah amen [Music] the devil doesn't stand a chance against the children of god hallelujah amen you may have your seats for our first special amen sister belinda heyman can you please make your way forward oh this song is called let god live and i wrote it earlier this year in june and some of the inspiration for it was um you know when in the bible when he talks about sham go and he planted his his fruit every season and then the philistines would come every season to steal his fruit but then eventually one year he just thought i can't do it but he cried out to the lord and says right now i'm going to stand against that enemy and then he just walked in that it just let the lord come and and work through him and with that with that jawbone he just slayed all those philistines and they no longer came to destroy his land anymore for him and his family and that was part of the inspiration for the song and then also where brother brenham talks about the greatest battle ever ford is in the mind and then um i think it might have been been mentioning that right here you know like where the no man's land is is where the final enemy will be you know dealt with and that when when we have overcome that we have the final victory you know then so that was the inspiration for the song there are times of trouble and despair [Music] so many burdens to bear but i've learned to put my trust in god and let god live let go [Music] having the victory i open my heart to the things of god and let god live in the greatest battle ever for the enemy surrounds me like a flood i will let the lord raise the standard and let god let him live in me let god live having the victory i open my heart to the things of god and let god live now i walk in perfect victory [Music] knowing jesus has come and set me free and i claim every promise of his word and let god [Music] having the victory i open my heart to the things of god and let god live and let god [Applause] amen brother onions you're special amen do you appreciate the lord amen come on brother god bless you greet you in the wonderful name of the lord i didn't hear amen i thought you were happy to be in the house of the lord for me to sing i need your support so if you are not happy maybe i'll just hand back the mic to the song leader until you happy now this song is a testimony since jesus came into my heart what happened since jesus came into my heart amen when i come to the chorus i'm singing in english your language our language i will sing the chorus in my language shona and if there's someone from africa who sings swahili will sing the chorus together amen [Music] love for change in my life every road since jesus came into [Music] below since jesus came into my heart

foreign [Music] inspiration in truth amen let's sing one more song amen before we invite them brother adrian over and are you ready for the word this morning amen listen that song you deserve the glory and the honor lord will lift our hands to worship as we praise your holy name i mean as we sing the song let's just even forget about everything just maintain the moment we're within let's think about him let's think about everything he's done for us as we give him this song as a worship as a prayer amen [Music] lord we lift our hands to worship [Music] lord we lift our hands to worship as we praise your holy name for you are great you do miracles or grace there is no one else like you no there is you are yes lord you do miracles so great there is no one else like you there is no for you were great you were great you are great lord you do miracles so great there is no one else like you there is no one [Music] let's give the lord the glory you deserve the glory [Music] we lift our hands and worship him [Music] for you are great [Music] [Applause] there is no one else like amen amen [Music] [Applause] amen praise the lord amen and a prophet says there's no one else like you [Music] amen he said you are greater than all the kings and all the potentates and all the presidents so we can glorify him and he says there's no one else like you praise the lord is that right you must be able to identify how god sees you because when god looks at you he looks at a part of himself is that right god came and searched out for a part of himself and we are here we are the searched out people and he called and we responded because we can only respond if we are an attribute of god so it's attribute coming to attributes is that right praise the lord well i just want to say how thankful to be into the house of the lord this morning and uh for the wonderful meeting last night thank you very much musicians we appreciate the musicians amen for creating the atmosphere praise the lord and uh brother freddie was saying last night how he uh you know accepted an invitation and wondered why he accepted the invitation well actually i was a little bit like that myself uh thank you musicians i was in switzerland at the time and an email came through from brother ben and i uh i said yeah i'll do a meeting and when i got home from europe i thought well the lord will give me something when i've been quarantined for two weeks and guess what nothing happens and it's just in the last few days that the lord just showed me do this and do this and do this and do this because i want to do a a part three of what i did in poland just a few weeks ago and it's something that is heavily on my heart to be able to get you into war mode amen we're in a battle this is not for a bunch of fairies we are soldiers amen we're in a battle and we're in a battle to the end not only to the end but beyond the end is that right because we are eternal beings we are not temporal beings we are eternal beings you are sure your body is a temporal body but this body is going to be changed in the twinkling of an eye but this part of ourselves is as eternal as what god is eternal he say man that sounds like heresy but that's the word of god amen we are as eternal as what god is eternal praise the lord brother ben thank you very much for the invitation uh it's just wonderful to be able to preach with some real preachers down here i'm just a farmer and i'm happy to be just called a farmer and uh but you know if the lord can use a farmer for his glory then that's all that matters to me you may be seated for a while okay when i came back from europe with my wife a few weeks ago i had i realized that there had been some serious changes in my life because i saw things going on in the world that was very serious and the lord enabled us to go into europe when that you could not get into europe uh it was impossible to get into europe but the thing is that with the lord nothing is impossible because he had people that were sitting in message churches that were wondering what is going on all around them and it is not because of the pastors and not preaching things the right way it's just that in every congregation there are people with weaknesses that that need to be strengthened you know so we're not here to go and run somebody down because you're weak we are here to strengthen you because you do not need to be strengthened if you're strong you need to be strengthened if you've got some weaknesses is that right praise the lord so uh i just want to um to just show you a few things and where is this little gadget here turn this thing on uh what am i doing wrong here brother you better go and turn this thing on i'm in the the dinosaur age with technology okay let's just see if that works i want to challenge you this morning as to what you are i want to seriously challenge you because this civilization brothers and sisters is dying for the lack of love amen and this is a civilization that has industrialized fear and you are living in an age where everything where you go is fear fair fear and the prophet god says fear is the biggest curse that's in the church and so we must get rid of all doubts we must get rid of all fear otherwise you cannot progress forward with the lord with a spirit now remember fear is a demon i'm going to call it call it what it is it's a demon and we cannot afford to have a demon of fear overshadowing us and the only way that you can have no fear is to know who you are in the book jesus knew who he was in the book and he had perfect faith by what the word spoke about her and you get perfect faith by knowing what the word spoke about you and when you know who you are that is your confidence that is your power that is your your identification is your power can you also say amen to that now when i was walking around casually through uh amongst the cosmos in other words the world systems in europe i did not know it but the lord was using me and i'm not the most spiritual guy here okay sometimes i think to myself my lord why did you choose me i look in the mirror and say i wouldn't choose me and you look in the red say well you wouldn't choose you either but i don't argue with god because he said he chose me and that's that and the story so i'm walking around not realizing that a lot of the time i'm walking around the world and amongst the world and this and the holy spirit's just doing things i want you to be conscious of who you are i was in krakow airport in poland just a few weeks ago and i had i was dropped off by the pastor i'm just walking around uh killing time until the plane left uh krakow to take me to frankfurt and i look and there's an african man in poland now you see african people in the western western europe but you don't see them in eastern europe because eastern europe is no money you know they they go there to get an education and things like that and i'm looking and and there's this this fellow up there i'll just put them back up there again can you put up that that slide please and i'm just walking around and i see this african man i said what an unusual thing to see a man there because and in poland the income is only 500 a month and so he goes and he's a the chicken opens up and the chicken to check in your bags he gets his boarding passes and go through security in the transit area and then sometime later i put my bags through get up my my boarding passes go through security into the transit area and i'm looking up to see where is the departure lounge and then as i see where the departure lounges this man the same man comes up to me and speaks speaks to me in polish i thought this man speaks polish i said look man i only speak english he's there he starts speaking in pure english and he says it's just a flight to frankfurt because uh i had to go from krakow to frankfurt frank victor to zurich onto a train up to the alps where our daughter lives and so i said yes this is the um the departure lounge to frankfurt and you know i i'm just a conversationalist if somebody wants to talk to me i'll talk to them back and so he just said i said well where you from man he says the ivory coast i don't know why they call that place in africa the ivory coast maybe there's some dead elephants on the coast or something i don't know why they caught on ivory coast and he says where are you from i said from new zealand and he said no he said well what are you doing here i said i'm a minister and he thought i was a government minister i tell you something i'm not one of those deceivers and it took him a little while to so he started walking with me and i'm not knowing the lord's using me he's and so he starts walking with me he says i've never had a white man talk to me before and my jaw drops and look i couldn't care if someone is black white pink blue polka dotted or striped in christ ain't no difference man and christ is no difference because in christ we all come from the same place we all just got trapped into a body that body is not the real you that body is not the real me and we got trapped into a culture called a pest house that pissed out is not your reality praise the lord we bypassed our reality but god places us in certain places and he expects us to utilize what he has made us for the sake of somebody else now we are living in an amazing time this is the greatest time to be leaving us right now and the only way that you can intercede or bring somebody to christ is by being an eternal being on the earth is that right jesus was an intercessor because he came from heaven and he's on the earth as a nearest kinsman to somebody else us and for any one of us to be an intercessor you have to first come from heaven praise the lord and be placed on the earth and stand in the gap for somebody who has no understanding of what god is doing in this hour praise the lord did this man walk with me i said look man i'm not a government minister i'm a servant of god he says what he said who supports you god who pays for your air tickets god and he was baffled because in the ivory coast these are big ministers come over from you know places in the world and they're jets with bodyguards and they come into ivory coast and he says they take all our money and you can't get to them you can't get to them for prayer he says man he says you're different of course i am different i wake up every morning i say man you're different i sure am you are too man were all different see anyway i'm not realizing the lord's using me and i said hey come on look look there's no seats over here just let's go and sit down here see we're talk talk talk talking away then it dawns on me i say i'm slow it dawns on me the lord is doing something with this man and so we sit down and i thought you know this inspiration is coming to i'm going to try this guy out i want to see what's in him i said look if you were to die right now man where you going he said i'm 70 to 90 sure i'll be go to to the lord i says well you're lost this is not a time to be 70 sure my friends 100 sure or not at all i said now look at the window see that world out there it's falling apart why is it falling apart i'm going to stir you now why is it falling apart you're making it fall apart you are making the world fall apart because as a civilization of faith rises up in us the cosmos goes down [Applause] and i know though i'm standing in a place where that man must connect with eternity so the only way he can connect with eternity is through an eternal being you understand now brethren you are the most important people on this earth i want to stir your faith up this world is dying for the lack of love so love must step forth [Applause] praise the lord and when love steps forth the grace is projected amen you must know who you are i am so excited about this day so now i start talking to this fella and he says uh you know he starts going on about how old that uh evade and apple and all that sort of thing so i started that genesis you know if if if an apple makes a woman pregnant well i tell you something man at harvest time there's going to be pregnant women all over the place but this guy caught an understanding of genesis then i'm saying now look out there the door to the gentiles is closing and it shocked him i said look man if someone was to put one million euros in front of me right now and give me a challenge either i take the euros or i am going to go and see the salvation of your soul what do you think i would choose i said i would choose your soul before any stinking money [Applause] because that money will pass away but your soul was worth ten thousand worlds i tell you something brothers and sisters that man he said to me he said you know you jesus of the bible is not doing anything supernatural anymore i thought here is my entrance my whole life is a testimony of the supernatural of god and your whole life is a testimony of god when i started on my testimony and the supernatural that happened in my life that man started screaming and the more testimonies testimonies i gave to him the louder he got and the louder he got and if you don't like emotion you won't like heaven because heaven is full of as full of africans [Music] [Applause] [Laughter] you africans don't have a monopoly on praise because i'm joining you amen praise the lord i gave this man a message book brother freddie called adoption a complete stranger went and bought me lunch and i was flabbergasted i've only met him for a few minutes and there's a report going on i said you want me to pray for your man says yes i said you know that god's calling you right now he says yes god is calling me right now now i'm not a spiritual he's not not super spiritual i'm just walking around minding my own business i happen to have the card of the pastor in southern poland right in my bag and i gave it to this man i gave him my my email my email my snail mail my phone number whatsapp everything i could give to this fellow he got it and i gave him to the the the pastor's uh address i said when you come back from ivory coaster to poland in october you go and bring this man up i contacted the pastor says you're going to have an a a man from the ivory coast contact you brothers and sisters is taking advantage of what you are do you like testimonies just give you one more okay [Music] because i want to get into the word you see now god's fear now he uses the black man now there's a white woman see now i said to this fellow isn't it amazing it's all these white people going on the plane and god bypasses all of them to go to you and he was astounded he says the lord's not motivating to me to any of these people here just to you he was just blown out now we're in zurich airport on the 20th on the 16th of september of last month and and the airports are like ghost towns there's nothing in them all the shops are shuttered except for six shops there was a souvenir shop two cafes a electronic shop and a place where the women get jingle jangles you know jewelers shop and and um a magazine shop now my wife wanted to get some souvenirs to take home so i said look you go into the souvenir shop and i'll i'll meet you a certain place and maybe a half an hour now you know sisters they like to shop and and i don't she goes in there she goes and you know with all oh you know you all respect your sisters it's this way that it is god made you that way just didn't make me that way so she goes and does her shopping and i go back and she's still shopping so i go for another walk around and i come back and she's still you know looking around again i go out then after a while i get fed up and i come back there's only one there's a woman behind the counter now watch how god does things the woman behind the counter she had a mask on now some people need to wear masks permanently but that one there she was behind the counter and i said to her i couldn't see her face she said i estimated around about 25. and so she's there and i said oh how's business and she speaks to me in english now she's a german swiss she starts speaking to me in english she says it's just no god this virus thing and this and this and this and she was really and she said such a scam and all this and sort of entry i started speaking to her about world events world events and talking about all the the the way that the world's uh falling down and what's causing it and this and this and and she and she's stunned that there's somebody who's not sucked in by at all amen she said i want to tell you something you won't believe this i said okay speak it now watch this i'm not knowing that the lord is using me okay now be careful with your walks because the lord can be using you don't know nothing she says i want to tell you something you won't believe me i can say it last year i used to work downstairs in this airport in the shop that sold t-shirts and a man walked into the shop with bare feet and a white gown on and i thought it's my time to die he said nobody else saw him there was he we couldn't even get it on the uh the close circuit tv he wasn't there i said girl god is calling you right now it says you go home and get on your knees and ask the lord to come into your heart i gave him my email my testimony i always give my testimony to people that i witness to because my testimony is on youtube it means very much to me how that the lord could take someone that's utterly useless could not speak had damage when he was a kid and god could put him in the pulpit it does not matter what your weakness is god can change that [Applause] i am a witness of that and i and i got to the stage now brothers and sisters if you want to get anywhere with god you must be able to take criticism because you cannot be hung in the hall of fame without people criticizing you and peop some people hate criticism but it's a part of the walk [Applause] is that right expect it praise the lord so she said i will i will i haven't heard from her since that doesn't mean to say she's first resurrection person she could be a second resurrection person but she had respect of what was spoken to her because when you carry this word when somebody respects that which you are carrying they are respecting god because you are the mercy seat do you believe it praise the lord okay one more walking around my wife and i went for a drive on saturday in switzerland and we stopped off in a certain town in the alps and there's a farmers market so we get out of the car everyone and my wife she wants to look at the tents and uh all the produce and things like like that and i like looking around other things and so i'm walking along and this uh young lady with a clipboard comes up to me and starts speaking to me in german i said look girl i only speak english so she speaks english now she picked the wrong guy for this she says i represent the united nations and said we would like to put you if we want to get our cameras here we'd like to interview you my wife said don't don't [Applause] this guy's a blatant guy don't interview my husband because she said they will ruin you she said all right all right we won't put you on camera we will just ask you questions and we'll write it down my wife or she is real happy i mean god bless you she's a nice lady and i love my wife very much because she's very guy i mean a woman a wife is is a guard over the husband is that right and so my wife goes and around the tents and things and she starts this this girl starts question number one what can be done to improve at the united nations [Applause] i thought girl i said an atomic bomb there was momentary silence then it started raining i said girl come with me sit down there i got some things to say to you so she sat down on the bench with me and i found out she was a denominational girl i says girl this world is toast it's completely falling apart and it says your access to mercy is coming to an end she says but sir but sir these things you're talking about is 10 years or 20 years in the future it says it's happening now does she swiss means that the shell is a little bit harder to crack but she i got through i'll be careful what i say because there's two sisters here that swiss it's a little bit harder to crack but i got through and i said look you the lord's calling you because something was registering in this this particular lady i don't know where she fits into the economy of god but i'm taking advantage of my position amen my position your position must be realized you are the access to mercy in this hour do you believe it praise the lord this is our subject we're going to go back it's our subject maybe you could just flick it back less down to our feet turn to our bibles to habakkuk now i'm a person i look at the scenery out there i've got to find it in the scriptures i'm a scriptural minister like these other brothers here i'm a scriptural minister i want to see what is god's expectation for us now you are a prophetic people amen you're under an eagle anointing we are not wallowing down here in the cosmos where you don't see anything we are up in a high place by a new birth is that right and it says in habakkuk 2 verse 1 now watch this man you have to understand who is this man what kind of age is he living in what is the scenery around this minor prophet he says i will stand upon my watch that means i'm going to stand in the position that god has called me into amen and i and sent me upon a tower now a tower is not somewhere down here a tower is somewhere up here so god had to open up the tower and those seven seals so we could stand up in the tower and look down because an eagle locks down and sees the panorama of um from genesis to revelation from eternity to eternity the ego sees the panorama and will watch to see what he will say unto me and what i shall answer when i'm reproved and the lord answered and said unto me write the vision make it a plan upon tables says i'm going to show you something uh have a cook because you are a representative of something that's going to happen right at the end time that he may run that read with it and he says for the vision is for an appointed time amen an appointed time it's got to come to pass but there must be the right time right season with the right people and the right maturity is that right and you are those people that he may run that readeth it the revision is for at a point of time but at the end it shall speak in other words it comes into expression amen he says wait for it because it surely will come it will not carry the word terry means wait it will not wait we are in the time when everything is speaking out its expression amen this bow hits the lord lord jesus i pray lord that you'd let the eagle fly this morning lord god lord jesus i'm just a man in my body lord god but in my soul lord i came from you lord god lord and our souls every one of us came from you lord we're in your eternal thinking lord god lord i want to cast no doubts upon people in this meeting lord that they could be sick and resurrection people lord god i want to believe in every heart here this morning is an election that comes from predestination and and law that you would call out those names from the lamb's book of life this morning lord god by a supernatural poor lord god that the people can be connected to what you're doing in this day lord i pray for i'm asking this for your glory in jesus wonderful name amen you may be seated now we're going to talk about habakkuk for a moment because we need to identify this man now we cannot leave characters in the old testament in the old testament amen because the old testament is a shadow of things that is to come so a shadow is a shadow because there's an element of light to make that shadow but at the time of the end time all the shadows come up into the reality time because this is the time of the rising of the sun so everything i look at in the old testament must be revealed now now watch this man we cannot leave him as a historic event now this man was in the time when josiah was the king so you know what happened in the days of josiah there was a book that had been lost that had been found there was a book called the book of moses and the book of moses was a book that was placed in the holy of holies beside the ark and every seven years at the feast of tabernacles that a high priest had to go into the holy of holies pick up the book come out with the book and read the book to the people at the feast of tabernacles and the prophet god says this is the feast of tabernacles right now so the high priest had to come down from heaven with an open book at the end time is that right and read from the open book and restore you back to your origins and there was a revival in the time of josiah there was a a revival a short revival before the babylonians completely took over hello now we are prophetic people are we every seven years the book had to come out and read to the people and what the reading of the book did it got rid of all the garbage and scattered all those scarecrows away and brought them right back to their true origins new zealand is not by origin africa is not your origin heaven is my origin and when the book came out he restored me back to my origin because perfect faith is my origin praise the lord and he was watching how that judah had become drunken they have become obsessed with sin now watch now in the days when josiah had the book restored he's in the days also of jeremiah the prophet and we've had a prophet like jeremiah in the last days is that right praise the lord a major prophet but here's one like habakkuk coming out that's your people amen that's all of you you're the habakkuk watching things happening on the earth babylon mystery babylon now moving in with a complete takeover but the book was what happened had his face in because the book was his stability the book revealed his origins and the book was holding him it's not you holding god as god holding you you can so many people say i'm holding on to god no you're not god's holding on to you if god's not holding on to you you will not last is that right it's god holding on to you and he does not choose you to lose you and i'm not being poetic amen praise the lord and so he's just seen judah sorry israel taken away by the assyrians then the babylonians took over the assyrians now the babylonians are going to come into judah and take away judah because judah has left the word of the lord amen and when they leave the word of the lord hell comes up like a flood now remember that what i've just told you we'll get into this later on if we get later on so now he had to have confidence he had to have an attitude when he saw evil moving in on the earth for a complete takeover now i'm just going to go and read you uh put up now the next one now watch this man he's seeing the evil on the earth and he says he says uh when i heard my belly trembled amen one part of him is frightened i had my lips quivered at the voice rodness entered into my bones and i trembled on myself that i might rest on the day of trouble we are in a day of trouble and i need to have rest in the day of trouble when he cometh up to the people he will invade them with his troops and he says although the fig tree shall not blossom watch the words no there shall be fruit on the vines the labor of the olive uh fail and the fields yield no mood and color from the fall uh the flock shall we cut off from the fold and there be no herd in the stalls there's economic failure so the economies are failing it says i'm seeing the economies failing through a roman inspired conspiracy the economies are failing yet i will rejoice in the lord i will joy in the god of my salvation the one who chose me i am going to have joy in that salvation the lord is my strength when in a time of trouble [Applause] and he will make my feet like hinds feet and he will make me walk upon high places i'm not going down to low places i'm out of the church ages i've come up into revelations four i've been caught up into him that came down amen and when john got caught up to him that came down what did john see john saw john amen the holy ghost in this hour connects you to the realization of your theophany it does not connect you to new zealand or south africa or wherever you come from it connects you to your theophany because your theophany is a word body the attribute is the word and the word must come to the word and it's only in the time of the eagle that you can be removed from the gravitational pull up into your reality and the prophet of god's word says we are bumping into those angels [Applause] you're coming to a meeting and the inspiration strikes he says you're bumping into angels praise the lord now you're a crazy man the way that they call crazy is the way that i worship my god amen praise the lord do you want to call me a crazy man thank you jesus now watch now a compression of events now yeah and if you catch this you'll understand genesis to revelation a compression of events in their heavenly and earthly parallels amazing thing now when we look at an occurrence on the earth we must realize brothers and sisters that a heavenly dimension is affecting it amen nothing's out of control heaven's controlling everything he says well the devil is doing this the devil is doing that yet but who's over the devil god is over the devil i think he made him for just say i'll just go and kill him off look he's there to be a contrast to bring god's character out in you so don't try to avoid the character building character building comes from ups and downs praise the lord now says and then he says in the lord's prayer he says let it be done on earth as it is in heaven so everything that's been done in this earth here your 16th element earth is to reflect heaven see i thought it was this is yes it's that earth too but we're also on earth let it be done let it be done on earth on in my earth let it reflect the prophecy coming from heaven praise the lord and jesus says in john 3 verse 12 he says if i have told you earthly things and you believe not how shall you believe if i tell you heavenly things amen says that no man hath ascended up to heaven but he that came down from heaven even the son of man which is in heaven says what he's here but he's there so many sense now people could see jesus earthly actions but they could not see him being controlled by another world come on now he was here yet he was there what are you by a new birth i'm here but i'm here [Music] i'm here but i'm not here because i'm looking at things for different eyes if i'm down here i'm looking at things just chaos and problems and things and that but when i'm up here i say all is well praise the lord all as well because the god who created me is in control of every situation and the prophet of god says never let a negative thought come out of your mouth because the moment that you speak a negative thought you're in the devil's territory [Applause] did he say that yes he did say that a negative thought you're in the devil's territory now watch now his body was a stumbling block to the people but inside of him was the throne of mercy and a throne of judgment now in my theme it's about the compression of events that every bible type releases the information of for the fullness at the end time now watch now we see five women here all those five women is you compressed into one woman is that right now ruth came out of the church ages but she's not called a queen amen did you come out of the church ages yes so we'll take this part of ruth that's part of me she meets the lord of the harvest boaz but first she meets the chief ripper is that right but she's not called the queen the queen part i'm going to have to go to esther right like she's come out uh ruth's come out of the churches church ages i've come out of the church ages also i'm like esther so i'm a queen also amen so i'm taking this piece and this piece and this piece and compressing it into me and to you well a sarah as she is she's not a queen either but the thing about sarah she's the one who had the body change so an aspect of my life is i'm having a body change so now i'm taking this this first verse and putting into here and that's me and there's rahab the harlot and she had to have the holy ghost on display in the time of the judgment in the land and the holy ghost has come into my life to connect me to the word i'm a privileged person here you are a privileged people we are being connected to the word in an hour of judgment and praise god for the hour of judgment because the squatters are going to be leaving the earth soon and they strut around saying we are the most important people we've been voted in you as a squatter and squatters can't stay in the house i've got an eviction notice for you my title deed is your eviction notice [Music] are you with me now the eviction notice has come praise the lord and rebecca well she wasn't a queen but she met eliezer what did eliezer give her goat silver and a change of raiment for a body change gave her gold because she's deity gave a silver because redemption is coming into the fullness of expression so is redemption but gave her gave her a change of raiment because we are being robed with a holy ghost robe to take a body change praise the lord for a message that can come and change our bodies let's go deeply now watch we're going to use the compression of events in the life of david because david is a church coming into power amen read marriage and divorce brother baby says david's church come into power so what we're going to do now is take events that happen to david's life and bring it right up to the end time because david is releasing something that you need to connect with now watch this now i'd love it when i saw the lawsuit put this in i don't even understand it he said and he come and showed me i'm not a bright boy i ain't been to school well i have been to school but i've got no degrees you know what acts chapter 15 the book of acts the holy ghost is moving amongst the gentiles and simeon has declared how god is speaking about the gentiles now coming in at that at the first dead visit the gentiles to take them out a people for his name and to this agree the words of the prophet as it is written after this i will return and build again the tabernacle of david he did not say the tabernacle of moses this must be a mystery going on here he's not talking about three rooms anymore he's talking about one room in one room he says i'll meet you in that place i'm not going to meet you in your intelligence i'm not going to meet you in your body i'm going to meet you in that place and in that place is where the rapture happens in this place that david made for the ark amen i will return i build the tabernacle of david which has fallen down praise the lord and i will build again the ruins thereof and i'll set it up i'm going to bring the soul into connection i'm going to bring the soul into connection with the reality of what was in the tent an attribute is coming into meta expression and god wants you to concentrate on what matters to him is the tense that's this man now now david was not a priest he was king now this tent it's on the move it was in the hands of the philistines amen so this ark sorry was on the way out of the hands of the philistines and david gets a hold of this ark and it's on a journey out of the enemy's hands and david wants to set it in its right place in jerusalem what are we new jerusalem is that right so it's on its transition and it's on a cart and david said we can't have it on a cart we're going to take it off the cart i can't leave it exposed to the elements oh my god so i'm going to make a tent for the ark i am going to make the tent for the ark amen and the ark so what he does he gets to preach the priest's robes he's not a priest now and he puts on the priest's ephod beautiful garments and he goes up to the ark and he's worshiping in the ark and he's not even a priest to show at the end time god is going to make someone a priest to get access to god at the time of the rapture direct access to god in their one room tent that god is looking at this says he says in the book of hebrews after we've come to the lord we have no more consciousness of sin that made consciousness means desire for sin amen will you fall yes will you fall every day yes paul did did did the lord change his mind about paul i don't think so did the lord change his mind about brother brennan when he uh got uh got caught up in some emotional things in the third pool no he did not go and and put but push the prophet away when in the standing in the gap sermon he just corrected the prophet and we can stand correction because we are the seed of god and though we fall though we fall he says you're going to fall but you're not going to stay down there grizzling and carrying on and snotting up and things like that to get back up again praise the lord so he's showing an end time position and this amazing thing that brother branham he's going to preach the rapture and who does he preach about david he will hide me in his pavilion in a time of trouble i don't want the troubles whether you won't be in the rapture then the rapture has to have a time of trouble you can't say oh i don't want there to be troubles god says it's a time of trouble and every time there was a rapture in the bible a trumpet was sounding and there was troubles because the troubles is what perfects you [Applause] praise the lord i don't know i'm going to get through this but we'll just give it a go anyway i'm only going to go for so long and then i'm going to say stop and i'm only going to go for so long then i'm going to say so long now watch this he's so inspired that his book of life is watching the ark the book of life now and suddenly the lamb's book within him screams out and he starts worshiping the lord because there's something inside of him the eternal part realizes what's going on now watch now david he got a revelation of the ark and when he prophesied of what was going to be end time actions here he is a king acting like a priest and what did the lord say about us will be made kings and priests unto our god because the book has been opened access has been made into the presence of god maybe i'll talk about that on monday or whenever a man-made tent and the prophet's preaching uh the lamb's book of life or something like that way back in the 1950s he says and and and he says when he's looking at that little tent about the third pool and after all the the fishing and all that sort of thing as he says and brother bran was behind the pulpit resting so after the prophets gone off the scene amen after that after 1965 things is happening and life is coming into the elect right at the end it says i'll meet you in that place i'll meet you in that place only and in that place is the word but it has emotions okay it has emotions but it's not emotions because for emotions sake it's because the word is producing the emotions it is not they a pentecostal emotions it is the word of god causing the emotions when and troubleless times are you with me now now each age has an allotted word of prophecy to be fulfilled is that right each age has its pressures its activities and and poses uncertainties so the holy spirit comes and strengthens the elect in each age now what does the word strengthen mean different to what i thought have a look now the lord's coming up to peter and peter's setting a pattern for every holy ghost believer the time brothers and sisters that you come to church and all you want to do is sit there and be fed by the five-fold ministry and do nothing is over it's time for you to rise up in your positions day of worshiping ministers is over it's your position that god is concerned about the ministers are servants they are down the bottom of the rung [Applause] not standing up in chairs over over here and a whole row of them come on now those days of those egotists are over [Applause] a minister is a servant [Applause] he gets you to the lord and then he backs out of it you follow the lord don't follow the man [Applause] praise the lord it's time for you to raise up from what god has made you [Applause] and here is peter he's come in contact with a son of man ministry amen it says watch the scenery and lord says simon simon behold satan has desired to have you today may sift you as weak he's going to pull you apart boy but guess what i pray for you and god has prayed for us praise the lord but i prayed for thee and that thy faith fail not and when you are converted strengthen the brethren humanistic you can't conv you can't strengthen anyone unless you're converted i'm on eggshells right now and he said until lord i'm ready to go with you i've got some news for you peter you ain't the pressures of this age going to get to you mate do you hear what i said the pressures of this age is going to get to you and you're going to buckle under the pressures unless you're converted says lord i'm ready to go with it i said and he said i tell you peter the croc should not grow this day and before you shall thrice deny that you knew me what a humble pie that peter must have eaten right there says nah not possible i've been in a message for 40 i'm a star wart of the message i will never deny you yeah what's happening all over the world right now then okay oh i i thought that was the man look how deep he is he knows the seven everything's he has got to be a man of god look he's so deep he's not even converted because he goes in he denies that the prophet was the prophet and he's preaching the seven everything that suddenly is not i is not converted i thought he was converted i'm so depressed it strengthens me because i'm a caleb i'm still standing right at the end praise the lord there's joshua and caleb's right at the end you should be the happiest people on the earth you are still here and it's god that's holding you oh i thank you jesus i can't even hold myself [Applause] amen stop pulling so hard you'll ruin me i'm 62 you know wife says every time i complain i said i wish i was 40. she says brother freddie my wife always reminds me about a man that i admire so much brother freddie does not like me saying these things but i admire that man if it embarrasses your brother freddie praise the lord and you know there's a minister in the united states who's preaching twice a week and he's 95. so when brother freddie gets down in the dumps remind him there's a minister over there there's always somebody older than us amen now watch now the scenery jesus is just before jesus goes to calvary and are celebrating the feast of passover and jesus has preached his last sermon which is communion what was brother branham's last sermon communion and it's the time when judas is making an agreement to sell out the lord into a false union amen and many disciples disciples including peter were not understanding the cycle of prophecy that was moving right in front of them and here was jesus preparing himself to fulfill his scriptures and order that they would become recipients of redemption and take their positions at the feast of pentecost that jesus had to do his part in order they could have their part but they were not understanding his part so they did not understand what was coming to them but when they understood his part then they could then understand their part are you with me now praise the lord now watch that what's the words to strengthen this completely messes up everybody's understanding to strengthen is to set another person's face steadfastly amen to set a person's face steadfast now steadfast does not mean it's steadfast i'm achieving the goal [Applause] amen ministers steadfast get them off the earthly things into the heavenly things and set their face steadfast to make stable to place firmly sit fast fix to set one's face steadfastly keep the face turned make firm to render constant and brother brenner's best preaching choosing of a bride and what did he see in the choosing of a bride the bride going up in the second part of the rapture cycle come on now [Music] doing this because there's a witch in the land amen jezebel is in the land and jezebel is influencing the elect can you say amen this world is too powerful for you to overcome on your own [Music] but i'm being led by the one who knows what jezebel's up to and as long as he's holding my hand and leading me i can go anywhere he wants me to go you mr gray cannot go into europe because of this you cannot get into switzerland because of this the planes will probably shut down you won't be able to get there so and you'll blow your doe if you go and buy tickets and if you want to go through australia you've got to have a transit document visa and you've got to have a quarantine this and a quarantine that and so you cannot go and i would advise you to stay home but i want to see my daughter and my granddaughters who my granddaughter have never met before have a limited time to go to europe so i said lord before the foundation of the world where did you see me [Applause] and europe you know what's the lord god to do he's controlling everything so he's got to go and make a way for us to get into europe but kiwis are not allowed in europe or switzerland the only way you can get into switzerland is if your wife has a swiss passport and she does [Laughter] praise the lord i said wrote to the government this was said are you sure i can get in they sent me with three prizes yes you can come now australia was a real mission to get through oh my goodness me i won't say anything about that get into switzerland go up to the passport people stamp stamp straight through not even a question asked i'm flabbergasted now i'm in europe thinking that i'm going there to see my family our family wasn't for that at all that's only part of it was to preach to the saints i had no idea i was going in there to preach to the saints and god was making a way he blinded me to what was coming and when i got there revealed it to me because if i hadn't known i was going in there to to preach i would have probably got a little bit nervous is that right brother tazewell get nervous but he blinds you sometimes to those things he's going to take you into and praise god that he does that so now to make one's face steadfast oh man i haven't even got into my subject yet but anyway now jesus here he isn't and luke 9 51 when and and it came to pass that when the time was come that he should be received up he steadfastly set his face to jerusalem the word steadfastly means strengthened he did not waver this way he did not waver that i'm going to achieve what god set me out to achieve he is the redeemer i am going to complete redemption redemption is not going to be something that's going to be particularly nice on my flesh but i'm going to complete redemption because in my heart i'm in a love affair and i'm looking at the joy that is set before me and who's the joy set before him you are praise the lord amen now watch what the prophet god says i like quotes sometimes yeah not all the time to to to you know to make a service go longer but it's good to have some quotes jesus told peter the night of the betrayal he was already saved he's but he's not converted he'll be he'll be you can be saved and still not have the holy ghost okay because he's a gene seed the seed that was put in to peter was already in peter was going to take him to that position of the holy ghost he might be shadowed over with this and shadowed over with that it does not matter how many shadows are over you brothers and sisters when your time and season has come the show the rising of the sun will shine upon that seed and the seed will come to life may it be these meetings that the seed comes to life praise the lord now after you're converted strengthen the brethren that's right oh sure you accepted christ as your savior but you're but when you're converters when you're really changed but he hasn't changed yet he cursed before the lord and denied him and everything ah and he was a chain seed horrors upon horrors jesus told peter that had followed him and cast out devils and done miracles and everything he says you're not converted yet but after you're converted then strengthen the brethren now watch this so astounding jesus is directing his words at a pattern that he wants for every converted person now hear me now peter was a preacher but he never strengthened one person amen he cast out devils never strengthened one person he laid hands on the sick they recovered he never strengthened one person it goes quiet didn't it he knew john the baptist was elijah he had a revelation that jesus is the son of god in matthew chapter 6 mark chapter 16. he had heard the seals being preached in matthew 24 in mystery form oh it's getting really touchy now wouldn't it he's under a son of man ministry jesus is a prophet like in this day yet he could be pressured by political religious circumstances to deny the lord because it was not converted he's laying hands on the sick casting out devils preaching the gospel and he's not converted and he's not strengthening one person that shocked me says now i know why so much so many ministers are falling away in this hour how can you walk away from the word you were never converted in the first place hey i'm not pc i said the way that it is you all know me i'm not some fairy walking around trying to say the right words now here was a spiritual trumpet that was going a spiritual war was being declared at the time when jesus was saying these things and they were humanly impossible to withstand and peter with all his zeal all his enthusiasm could not withstand those pressures even in this pressurizing day people are just falling away and the reason why the ministers are not pointing them to the vision is that right of a husband and his wife walking hand in hand upward onward christian soldiers back to eden again under a rapture cycle when the seventh seal has come down in a threefold manner what it was a seventh seer god himself coming down to reveal himself and take preeminences over the elect then positionally place them to take them back to eden and the biggest problem is that people cannot give god the preeminences because to give god the preeminences you must become a prisoner of jesus christ and a prisoner has no agenda of his or her own we've got our ambitions oh i want to be so educated oh i want to be so rich oh i want to be so this and so that but that's not giving god the preeminence that's what you want what does god want praise the lord amen now watch in our church lately but our el rey has been preaching some stuff on divine love and philly i love and all that and which has been a real blessing to our church is that right brethren from taranaki that is now peter is caught in a confusion watch this man he's confused now jesus is after the resurrection amen where are we in a resurrection time there's been a second crucifixion of jesus christ is that right and there's a resurrection time and when they had dying jesus saith unto peter simon son of jonas lover sell me more than these and peter is totally confused he thinks he's talking about human love he's not do you love me with divine love he's confused he said yeah lord you know us though i love thee with for leo or human love he's not talking about philio love or human love he's talking about do you love me because of who i am and i am the word he said feed my lambs amen he's going to get really confused he sat on until him again the second time simon son of jonas lovers tell me in others do you have divine love for me he said to them lord they all know that i love thee with philly i love come on now you're not you're not getting it because what is divine love divine love is sacrificial love divine love lays down its life for others it does not think of itself and when you give yourself to lord that divine love gives preeminences to god he said feed my sheep yes now he's going to really rub it in and he says and the third time simon says son of jonas yeah love of me only with a human fully i love you see how he's just coming down to where he's at now is that all you love me with peter was grieved because he said unto him the third time love was telling me and said unto him uh lord they'll notice all these things you know that i love thee jesus said i'm gonna feed my sheep but he can't feed his sheep because you're not converted here's a conversion in other words peter after you're converted let divine love feed my sheep in other words peter no longer are you going to be deciding what you do with your life it's not your ambitions it's not your desires you are going to be so subjected to me as a prisoner i will be bridling you like the prophet talks about in the prison of jesus christ you'll be so bridled to it with me with divine love that i can turn you any way that you i want to turn you and not only that at the end of your life you will be crucified like i am this gets a bit tender doesn't it so now jesus is preparing peter for the next part of the prophetic season pentecost and peter is in a lap over time between passover and pentecost amen now watch what he says jesus said if you love me feed my sheep now he never did say share them a lot of people like fleecing the sheep is that right he didn't say fleece the sheep he said feed the sheep he never said educate my sheep brother i want you to understand what the fantasy it means this and this and this and this well i want to see it working out in flesh and life thundering itself out praise the lord he said feed them well sheep is well sheep is correctly fed with sheep food and sheep food is the word for a man shall not live by word alone by everywhere that precedes out of the mouth of god and the food that they're looking for is life looks for life does not look for theology does not look for to be the most educated person in the message is looking for life hey praise the lord now watch this now sheep food i'm just building this up oh man i'm not even going to get i haven't even laid the platform yet i'm sorry but you know i can only go so far and i must still this the bodies are still a pest house you know sheep food the bible said we've just come through it over here in the church ages jesus is the hidden man of christ is the church's manner so we're talking about the manner we're talking about christ allotted out for each age to feed the sheep for that age you cannot feed the sheep and luther's day a rapturing food because it will choke them because they are in the main age they ain't under an eagle anointing the same holy ghost under a man anointing oh choke him so i had to reserve it for people who are an attribute of god that god before the foundation of the world knew a part of himself had to be put here and that part of yourself that is put here has been put here because there's uh there is something in you that can receive it forget about your head this is just the tree of knowledge it's just a tree of knowledge this is the tree of knowledge brethren this is where this is the tree of life praise the lord and he says if you've gone so far on the tree of knowledge jump over onto the other tree because the tree of knowledge will only go so far and all your you're studying and everything else and knowing how it all fits together will only go so far but now you have to step into revelation of what he's talking about because he is between the lines in a love letter is that right he says and christ is that hidden manner that comes from god out of heaven afresh every day every day we can't say well two weeks ago i had a great experience of god what about right now [Applause] praise the lord what about right now amen he says and we feast upon this manner which is christ and he sustains us through the journey till we reach the land on the other side now that's what he meant by feed my sheep amen now let's go a little bit further now now when peter reached the feast of passover everything changed i'm sorry we reached the feast of pentecost everything changed by conversion everything changes praise the lord by a conversion peter is not speaking about something he is the first one amen he is the one who life is speaking through the channel outwards he's not speaking about something he is the identity speaking praise the lord do you get it now you can talk about this and you can talk about that but i want to know who has god made you now he's speaking from his own identity his own position and his connection to the present tense prophecy that's coming to pass all around them and he knows i'm the mouthpiece of god i'm the tabernacle of gods i'm the temple of god i'm the temple that's connected to eternity praise the lord and jesus says back in john 21 he says verily very i sound to you now this is before this now it says when you were young and you didn't have the holy ghost you gird yourself and you walk wherever you would but when you shall be old you shall stretch forth thy hands and another shall gird thee and carry their weather whether you shall wood is not neither in other words peter after you've got the holy ghost the world can do absolutely nothing with you amen i sure can give you you get some problems but as i ain't going to remove the anchor because the anchor is being held and you are one scary person to the devil in that state i want to make the devil so miserable when he ever sees me says oh no he wants to go away for lunch real quick now watch now we just i don't want to go too much much further you know now watch the contest where is it now the food changes deeper the contest raise up mighty man mighty man not weak man mighty man mighty woman is that right warriors of faith not this kind of a warrior that's a worry that that's not the right kind of warrior a warrior is the one that goes into a battle is that right open this year lord now he's going to preach those seven seals to loose the warriors [Applause] gentile warriors that hidden manner that rock beneath the rock that we may see the program of god oh praise the lord amen cap off the pyramids of our life lord put the captive christ upon each and every one of us is that your prayer well how does this happen man quite simple it was going quiet by giving him preeminence that's not deep enough it is it's deep enough is that right i'm going to finish off this now i ain't even started very often sorry but i just worked my heart out over this last week and maybe i'll take the rest of it on monday morning now let's take a little trip back to genesis chapter five and we're going to interview enoch have a little interview enoch god bless you my brother says god bless you my brother says enoch i said enoch we're going to interview him now okay you know what does your name mean it says my name means dedication tell me about your life enoch well i am the seventh from adam and in the book of uh job god wrote the first bible in the heavens and job could see pleiades which is seven church ages he could see orion what happens to be the capstone coming at the end time is that right it says but god has commissioned me to make a pyramid which is the second bible now so i've been building this pyramid now this pyramid on the outside is from eternity to eternity and what you see with the visible part is the time realm and inside of the pyramid i have designed it a certain way by inspiration of the holy ghost and there are and there's a moses law going down there and it stops there and then and then up here is coming into the grace time and there's seven steps going up to there and there's a platform there where the messenger of the age stands and there's and and there's and there's two little dips there where it's the first and second pill and after that dip is where the king's chamber is well what about the top of the pyramid well the top of the pyramid the inspiration has told me to leave it off because that part is for the end time amen now enoch what is the political world like out there right now well it's just
