merciful amen that the things that he can do amen and my prayer this morning is that you know we're all diamonds and sometimes there's it gets a bit oxidized you know know and sometimes there needs to be a clearing yes Hallelujah there needs to be a shining Hallelujah so when the light of God shines through you it refracts into the beautiful rainbow colors amen it reflects that light and every attribute of his divine nature hallelujah amen let's um we got it up good sweet let's just while we're standing we'll go straight to the scripture oh yeah um this morning I want to speak on which is part six of the subconscious mind series and it's called clearing your title deed hallelujah amen and this one is more preaching than teaching so yeah we'll just we'll just enter in amen we'll enter into the the vision of the word amen hallelujah uh this is a a marvelous subject a wonderful subject and I don't believe that no human can grasp or capture the whole thing but I'll just take a little bit by the grace of God and share that with you Hallelujah that what he's shown me under his anointing and Grace about what he's done and what the abstract is and all these things that brother brandom speaks about and if you've listened to these messages and you might not all capture the whole thing but today let's Shine the diamond a little bit amen hallelujah let's turn in our Bibles and or if you just want to read we're going to we're going to start at Genesis 3 and verse 6-13 and it says and when the woman saw that the tree was good for food and that it was pleasant to the eyes and a tree to be desired to make one wise she took of the fruit thereof and did eat and gave also unto her husband with her and he did eat and the eyes of them both were opened and they knew they were naked and they sewed fig leaves together and made themselves aprons that would never work and they heard the voice of the Lord God walking amen amen they heard the voice amen if we have studied English that doesn't make sense in the English they saw the uh The Voice walking a voice how does a voice walk so it must have been a person amen walking in the garden to come down for Fellowship but they had eaten of another tree Lord God walking in the garden the voice of the Lord God Walking In The Garden in the call of the day and Adam and his wife hid themselves from the Pres presence of the Lord God amongst the Trees of the garden and we'll just go carry on and the Lord God called unto Adam and said unto him where art thou amen see the Lord God is already now calling He's already calling he's already he's he's he's starting this work of redemption already amen asking where are you and then he'll ask who are you who is this person and you'll see later on in the sermon what I'm talking about Where Art Thou he said and he said I heard thy voice in the garden and I was afraid because I was naked and I hid myself and he said who told thee that thou was naked hast thou eaten of the tree whereof I commanded thee that thou should us not eat and the man said the woman whom thou gavest to be with me she gave me of the tree and I did eat and the Lord God said unto the woman what is this that thou Hast done and the woman said the serpent beguiled me and I did eat and we skip down to verse 22 and the Lord God said behold the man has become as one of us to know good and evil and now lest he put forth his hand and take also of the tree of life and eat and live forever therefore the Lord God sent sent him forth from the Garden of Eden and in another translation it says that Adam was kicked out of the Garden of Eden he was given the boot basically like it wasn't just an easy thing it was go so there were and then the Lord says and therefore the Lord God sent him forth out of the Garden of Eden to till the ground from when he was taken Hallelujah so he drove out the man and he placed at the east of the Garden of Eden cherubims and a flaming sword which turns every way to keep the way of the tree of life so they couldn't enter back in there had to be something happened for them to enter back in because something left Adam's hands and where did it go Revelation chapter 5all and I saw in the right hand of him that sat on the throne a book written within and on the backside sealed was Seven Seals that's where the book went that's where the title deed went that's where Adam inheritance went it couldn't go into the hands of Satan had to go back into the hands of the almighty God Amen and so that's where the title deed has been for a long time but as we know and you're very familiar Revelation 10:1 and 2 and it says and I saw another Mighty Angel come down from heaven aren't you so glad Hallelujah that a an angel came down from heaven amen a captain came down from heaven amen he came down from heaven Hallelujah he came to you Hallelujah why was he coming to you he wants you to eat something hallelujah what was driven out for many years they were all driven out couldn't come back you've been a privileged people that's only in this generation that's eating this remember that it's a very big difference the title deed and clothed with a cloud and a rainbow was upon his head and his face was as it were the Sun and his feet as pillars of fire and in his hand he had a little book open so there's a big difference we've read Adam walked out kicked out got kicked out and God guarded it so he couldn't get back in there was no way he could get back and eat that tree and then we see where the book went and it was closed and now we see an event happen a glorious event where a little book is open and he set his right foot upon the sea and left foot on the Earth and now very glorious Revelation 108 and the voice which I heard from Heaven who knows that John is a type of the Bride amen amen so what John heard you hear amen have you heard amen Have You Heard a Voice speak from Heaven say and I don't know how that voice manifest to you but it manifest to me in a thirst I have a hunger for God I have a thirst to to know more about my my bridegroom I want to know all about him not in head knowledge but in heart knowledge I want to know all about him I want to know his personality and all those things and and it all is revealed in there and I Heard a Voice which I heard from himen spake unto me again and said go and take the little book which is open Amen in the hand of the Angel which standeth upon the sea and upon the Earth may the Lord add his Blessing to the reading of his word you may be seated amen we are eating the from the tree of life again Hallelujah you are what you eat amen amen so I want to just establish that as a foundation because we're going to we're going to soon go back to the time of Abraham and we're going to see a great picture unfold of God's Plan of Redemption brother brandom says here and this is just to further the foundation so that we can revisit these things later on in the sermon so if you're wondering where I'm going you just have to be a little bit patient what is this book of redemption this title deed Abstract title deed you say abstract what does an abstract mean it means it's searched all the way back to its beginning oh my we're going to go somewhere here like that little drop of ink this morning when it struck that bleach it went all the way back and When sin has been confessed and fallen into the blood of Jesus Christ oh my it gives an abstract right straight back to the Creator again amen and you become a Son of God Abstract title deed is held in the hand of the almighty oh my it's Redemption means all legal possession Amen to all all that was lost by Adam and Eve I want you to just say something with with me and we're going to say I have all legal possession I have all legal possession amen all legal possession Hallelujah now you might experience things in your life and things that are happening in your life that make you feel like you don't that devil is not going to just sit there and let you take that he going to fight you to The Bitter End he's going to fight you to try and destroy you to make you feel like you don't have what you actually have yeah that's right he's going to lie and he's going to deceive and he's going to do all these things so just because you're having a battle about it that's actually a good sign am that you have got something because if you're not being fought and you're not going through struggles and battles it means that you might not have it you know if it's just all easy and plain sailing all the time if the devil's not after you he's got you amen amen right going to go to Isaiah 51 I'm not going to preach too much at the moment but just want to lay this down harken harken now the reason I'm doing this is because and why I'm going back to Abraham is the inspiration came from here a long time ago to look to Abraham it says here hearken to me ye you that follow after righteousness ye that seek the Lord who seeks the Lord look unto to The Rock when ye are H this is all symbolism symbology or whatever and look unto the rock where you are human where did you come from what's the rock is Christ it's the rock you are human from The Rock Amen and so it's good to look at to the rock that you were he from it's good to find out your Eternal origin amen that you were one of those sons that shouted for Joy before the world even began Amen in the mind of God Amen and you'll find out one day we think now it's because it was in the mind of God it wasn't really there it wasn't happening it happened you were there because his mind is eternal just as real as you feel like you're right here you were in his mind just as real and when we get back to Eternity that was already that happened it was that's it's in a present tense Hallelujah so you really were there in his mind amen amen that's real his thoughts are Eternal so look to your recognize your Eternal value recognize your Eternal status that you never had a beginning and you'll never have an end no matter how much the devil tries to destroy you you never had a beginning and you'll never have an End Amen that's right amen but also whilst you're looking at The Rock when you were heu from and you were heu out by the prophet Hallelujah God brought you out of Egypt On Eagle's Wings amen unto himself Hallelujah amen so remember that's glorious and it is very glorious but he's also saying here now and to the whole of the pit whence you were dig what's that the clay the flesh side understand your nature because if you don't it'll get the better of you or trick you you need to understand those things and that's why we're going through the series to understand those things to give you advantage over your worst enemy which is you amen look unto AB abam your father and unto Sarah that bear you for I called him alone and blessed him and increased him for the Lord now you now it's like he changes now but he doesn't because now he says he's not because now you can recognize he's talking to you not just Israel because you inherit Israel's inheritance before they do yes amen the ultimate inheritance you get it first yes amen think about that apart from the select few of the Apostles the the whole Plan of Redemption came to the Gentiles first now it says here for the the Lord shall Comfort Zion amen that word Comfort can also be avenge he can avenge for Zion he can the enemy tries to get you just remember the Avenger is on his tail the Avenger is coming for him so you just hold his hand Hallelujah hold the hand of the captain amen that's what he set you free for it's to hold the captain's hand cuz the captain is our campaign manager amen he's the five-star general amen Hallelujah okay he says here he will Comfort all her waste places he will avenge all her waste places so all those waste places in your life that you can see and others may be able to see or not see if you're hiding it good the Lord will avenge them all amen hallelujah David said that the the bridegroom is like the son that comes out of his chamber and he goes through and he and the stars have have made a body for him to come and dwell in the midst and so the Son of God is moving through the people the Suns that are placed in their positions and there's nothing hid from the heat thereof there nothing hid from the heat of that glory of God that being that voice that walks amen amen amen he will Comfort avenge all her waste places so you can rest assure that what he begun in you he's going to finish it hallelujah amen hallelujah whatever your struggling with right now it may just be that God wants to do something in your life amen I can almost guarantee it as a general statement that what you're struggling with right now the things that you're failing at right now God is dealing with that he's put his finger on something and what is his finger is Judgment Hallelujah he's going to judge the sin he's going to judge the what is he going to do he's going to clear an abstract right back he's going to take that and he's going to poke his finger right back on the originator of that sin which is Satan the accuser of our Brethren and nail it right back hallelujah amen hallelujah don't you love these verses and he will make her Wilderness Hallelujah like Eden amen he doesn't want you to just warm up you he wants you to be a fruitful lady for God hallelujah amen and he will make your Wilderness like Eden oh my what a contrast Hallelujah a Barren dry cracked up land where the seeds fallen and can't grow because there's no water he going to turn that into a lush green Eden again hallelujah amen and her desert like the garden of the Lord joy and gladness shall be found therein oh my Hallelujah you know you come around to the Saint's house and they and and you just feel at home and it's nice and it's good and and it's and and it's and it's wholesome Hallelujah and you have fellowship and you talk about the things of God you're resting under the shade of the Green Tree Hallelujah because why cuz you're feeding on the tree of life you're eating the leaves that's healing your life hallelujah amen amen and the voice of Melody amen what does he give what happened when the Seal's opened they sang a new song Amen that song is your life it's what's happening it's not just what you're saying in fact what you say is very little in heaven what you say is very little it does make an effect because that's where you can speak and command things and pray but what what you live is really what the voice of Melody that's what you love is your life that's the Thunder that shakes the devil amen oh let's not go there yet shall we go there yeah we'll go there amen so let's start with Abraham Genesis 15:1 after these things the word of the Lord came unto Abraham in a vision saying fear not Abraham I am thy shield and thy exceeding great reward amen and he brought him forth abroad and said sorry I've skipped some verses so just because for time and he brought him forth abroad and said look now toward heaven and tell the Stars if thou be able to number them and he said to him so shall thy seed be and he believed in the Lord and he counted it to him for righteousness see God's now making a covenant with Abraham amen and you watch there's a sacrifice now that's going to take place of a ram that is 3 years old how old was Jesus when he went to Calvary how old was his ministry the when the Heaven and Earth kissed 3 years old the sacrificial lamb had to be washed and at the at at the threee Mark or three and a half but 3 year M he was sacrificed and he believed in the Lord and he counted it to him for righteousness and he said unto him I am the Lord that brought thee out of er the caldes I give to give thee this land to inherit it so here God is giving Abraham the title deed of the natural promised land and he said verse 8 and he said Lord God whereby shall I know that I shall inherit it good question you want to know you want to understand the perfect love of God you want to understand these things because if you don't you'll perish with lack of knowledge you have see there is a Godly knowledge we cannot just kick knowledge out completely there's a God knowledge and that's understanding your position in the the the Judgment seat of Christ and the that's understanding who you are it's being red up to maturity so you can make a stand because your enemy he knows all the laws of God he knows how to Swindle everything and if you don't know how to stand in the courtroom of God in battle you will be defeated and you'll walk in defeat but if you can understand the the legal side of these things not legalism but the the spiritual legal laws of God and how they work then you can become a lawyer you can become an executor of things yes amen amen that's what God wants to raise you to do because you're going to judge the world one day with Christ and he's training you now to rule and reign with him he's training you to be governor of many cities providing your faithful right now he's training you he's putting you through test he's allowing you to understand the spiritual law of God now don't worry and get all FR I've got to learn all the laws I've got to learn all these things oh don't worry about that amen you just hold the captain's hand the trials you go through and God placed in your life he painted you with the human race he painted you with your predecessors he took all the DNA of your predecessors and everyone like that and he put them all together he made you a certain way God is Sovereign a God that can hold six se illion stars together and make them all orbit and put them in Balance how much more can he paint you out of your predecessors and put you a certain personality in you and then put you through a race a challenge a battle that's predestined to bring out a certain ring in your life a certain Ting on the bell of your life the new song that you sing Hallelujah with your life will be a certain flavor amen amen and he will train you up to be a ruler amen but the struggles you go through is to develop your character it's to remove things out of your life where was I H here we go take so now he says how will I know if I inherited it and he said unto him take me an hepher of 3 years old and a she goat of 3 years old and a ram of 3 years old so there's a significance for 3 years old and that's why when I was think pondering on that the Lord reminded me that as after he was washed and and he he was washed as the lamb sacrificial lamb it was a three-year Ministry and a turtle do and a young pigeon and he took unto him all these and divided them in the midst so cut them in half and laid each piece one against another side by side but the birds he divided not and when the fouls came down upon the carcasses Abraham drove them away and when the sun was going down a deep sleep fell upon Abraham and lo and horror of great Darkness fell upon him and he said unto Abraham Abraham know of assurity that thy shall be a stranger in a land that is not theirs Satan was listening he was listening to this know of assurity that thy seed shall be a stranger in a land that is not theirs and Shall Serve them and they shall afflict them 400 years now it didn't say now we wonder some people critical and you know they say oh you know they they was more than 400 years the word must be faulty or whatever but it says they shall afflict them 400 years so it doesn't say they'll be there could be there for 5 600 years but they were afflicted for 400 years so they were slaves for 400 years so they might have been 30 40 50 how many years uh under Joseph and the good pharaoh and that but then they went into slavery and that Affliction was 400 years and also that Nation whom they Shall Serve will I judge and afterwards they shall shall they come out with great substance and thou shalt go to thy fathers in peace Thou shalt be buried in a good old age you can see now God gave Abraham the title but God also placed something on that title there was nothing that Abraham could do or fast or pray or believe he believed there's nothing more that Abraham could do other than become subject to the very word that was being revealed to him and surrender to what the ordinances amen he might not have understand why circumcision I mean no how do we you know it's like it's not uh you don't just try and figure that out he just did it yes he he just did it he became subject to the word that was revealed to him by God who descended down in his day as mesc to give him Bread and Wine and same God giving him his title deed but God placed something on that title he placed a a clause an e an easement on that title that said that yes you're in the land I give it all to you and your seed shall inherit the land but your seed shall s j in Egypt for 400 years first so there was something that no matter what Abraham tried or prayed or cried out to God or how good he could be as a Christian or a uh whatever you call I say Christian there's nothing he could do to to to to to change or twist the program God placed an easement on the title but one day God was going to clear that title Hallelujah one day it was going to come open again amen hallelujah Abraham just so you know had the the faith and the power the anointing to take that land because it shows when he took all his Farmers Hallelujah with ice picks and Spades brother Bram said and he went and took and overcome all those kings with armies and horses Abraham had the anointing he had the ability to do it yes amen God carries on here says but in the fourth generation they shall come hither again for the iniquity of the amorites is not yet full and it came to pass that when the sun went down and it was dark Behold a smoking furnace which is hell and a burning lamp passed between those pieces so the pillar of fire or something went between the pieces and that was in those days was the sign of a covenant that God cuz Abraham wanted to know how am I going to inherit the promise how am I going to inherit my inheritance who's going to pay for this how am I going to take this land where is the Covenant and he asked the question and here God performs The Covenant in those days they divided the Beast and they set they walked through the middle of the Beast and that and and and that was the Covenant that they made in this time and so he says and so God makes this Covenant with him by a sacrifice of a ram that's 3 years old and showing and type the very sacrif rice of Calvary in the same day that the Lord made a covenant with Abraham saying unto thy seed have I given this land from the river of Egypt unto the Great River the river Euphrates and now he names it out the kenites and the kenites and the cadit and the Hittites and the perizzites and the rims and the amorites Canaanites gites and jebusites all the ites amen and so all those ites those names actually all have meanings and you can associate the very meanings of every one of those names with the problems that you face in life right right but God's given you all the land amen he's given it all to you Genesis 161 and2 now Sarai Abram's wife bear him no children and she had an handmaid an Egyptian whose name was hagga and Sarai said unto Abraham behold now the Lord Lord has restrained me from bearing so there's a trouble troubles coming troubles coming the start of the church very first start the start of the church now that God had called Abraham out of the world out of Babylon he's now starting a church and right at the very beginning here comes the Antichrist Spirit here comes a false Vine that's about to come into the into into being here comes trouble for Israel trouble for Abraham's family that follow them right through and they're still troubling them today amen the Arab race not nothing against Arabs because there's elected Arabs as well it's not about flesh or anything but that they are from Hagar and and um Abraham that's the union is the Arab people now they have troubled Israel for 3,000 years 4,000 years that's a long time just from now what here what is it Sarah starts wanting the promise to come to pass she's getting now not in the wrong spirit either she just wants it to happen she's got faith or something human Faith she she's trying to make it happen God said it will happen it's going to happen yes so Sarah now and her ambition starts rising up she starts trying to make it happen she and Sarai said unto abrah behold now the Lord has restrained me from Beering I pray thee go in unto my mate it may be that I may obtain children by her and abrah hearkened to the voice of Sarai you know many times in the church when a pastor starts hearkening to the voice of the woman that he's pastoring the the church not saying us but it's been the the and and the the popular opinion the feminine opinion of this world and pastors which is like that relationship of brah and S they start hearkening they start crumbling and all of a sudden Antichrist Spirit comes in all of a sudden false things come in and everything all happen because they got to follow the Fashions they got to have their own captive Abraham hearkened to the voice of Sarai it's trouble Genesis 161 to 11-2 it says and the angel of the Lord now this is later this is after Sarai sorry Hagar had um had the baby uh was pregnant and it says and the angel of the Lord said unto her behold thou art with child and shall bear a son and shall call his name Ishmael because the Lord has heard thy Affliction and he will be a wild man my a wild man and his hand will be against every man and every man's hand against him and he shall do in the presence of all his Brethren isn't that trouble that's happened for 4,000 years because someone tried to make the promise come to pass you cannot make the promise come to pass you cannot fast forward the program of God Amen you cannot try and fast forward it and yes the problem is you know Sarah had gifts she was gifted her gift was an Egyptian maid and so now here Sarah now takes her gift and she anoints her her own gift and she starts to minister through her gift and she starts to take her gift and change the very church cuz Abraham now the church called out means Ecclesia called out now changing the church she now she's anointed her gift and she's now using her gift and her gift is now made to change things and make it happen and now we find many ministers in this message and many ministers all the way through everywhere that are anointed and they can see things in the word and they catch hold of something that may not have actually meant to be happening for a while and they start anointing their own gift and giving their gift and they start anointing it and they start preaching from their own gift and they take the church beyond the program of God or if they're complex and inferiorities and all the things like Saul and they follow this and that or maybe they're just scared because they've been told all these things and they take their gift and anoint it themselves and hold the people back and bring the People Back Into the Wilderness after they've crossed over or take the people further into the Millennium already or give the people Two Souls so they can sin and do all those things because they got a spirit of lust so they anoint that gift Sarah took her gift to make it promise come to pass now we now what do you got to do with your gift you're gifted all of you you've got gifts yes that's right don't you use your gift you can use it if you want God's not going to stop you but surrender that gift amen surrender that gift submit that gift let God use that gift because that gift if God can use it it's God God is the one that wants to he'll keep you where the pillar of fire is burning Hallelujah he'll keep you where the fire's warm amen where the fire's real you'll stay in the reality of this message Hallelujah you'll stay where the very battle is taking place where the scriptures is unfolding where the prophecy is happening now present tense walking with the everpresent Living God the I am amen he will keep you there amen the gift will stay there it will Minister from there Minister from eternity hallelujah amen that's right amen Israel 1 Corinthians 10:11 is our natural example now all these things happened unto them Israel for examples and and they are written for admonition upon whom the ends of the world have come you know Israel it's amazing so much like that is so much because you see Israel they get planted in the promised land they get planted they get placed in a land that's surrounded by enemies Hallelujah you know and you wonder sometimes why you're fighting and struggling because he's placed you in the middle of all your your enemies and this flesh this is the prom you know this is like the natural Promised Land you could say and it's like sinful nature and he's placed you your soul inside in the middle of all of your enemy your worst enemy amen but he said it's all yours take it Hallelujah you know brother bradam said in this quote he said that when the Holy Ghost comes into you it blends with your spirit so he comes in and then he pushes out amen your your your old nature your old it doesn't get kicked out it gets changed gets renovated by the Holy Ghost amen that's why he said be renewed in the spirit of your mind be renovated in the spirit of your mind let your subconscious mind be renovated amen and that's what we're speaking on today but we're taking a different angle so we might not mention subconscious very much today but just remember this is very much about the subconscious this is very much about all your memories and affections and all the things that's held in your life life that's holding you back they are your the Hittites and hivites and jebusites and one day we're going to speak about driving out your jebusite amen that enemy that's trampled you down and threshed you all your life that right punch that the brother Bon talks about you know the Lord can come and just give him another good one amen punch him out hallelujah hallelujah once your life anoints him kingen when your life anoints him King you can sit on the Pew you can come to church you can say all you want to say and please all the people but what is your life saying amen when your life anoints him King amen that makes a huge difference that's when he actually becomes king that's when actually you get the full victory in your life hallelujah amen turn not to the left or to the right meditate in it day and night you shall have good success Hallelujah if you're not willing to forsake all and follow him you will be an unsuccessful Christian you'll be an unsuccessful message believer successful now when I say that I don't mean like going out there and earning lots of money I'm talking about spiritual success Freedom Liberty the fruit of the spirit in your life Hallelujah the stature of the perfect man amen hallelujah we're going to go now we're going to talk tell a little bit from Abraham to kaders Bia and we're going to take some some steps here and show you that you know Abraham now and Abraham had this conditional Covenant given to him God elected him and he called him out of Babylon he called Abraham from Idols amen hallelujah he looked beyond Abraham's fault and saw his need amen hallelujah and he took him out of that situation and now he started removing things out of his life and people out of his life that was holding him back amen and so he removes lot out of his life and once his dad was not even meant to bring his dad you know and when his dad's gone and then lot's gone and then the inheritance starts becoming more a apparent hallelujah what was just an apparition became apparent amen then it became materialized Hallelujah but that wasn't until later on Amen but Abraham was called out Hallelujah and now you see now God is actually calling out under election and he's giving him the title and he gives him the Covenant and he makes the sacrifice and divides it into two and passes between it amen like a type of Calvary right calls him out and then Abraham has Isaac and then the age continues on and Isaac now carries uh justification and then Jacob Now a type of Grace comes on the scene and God through all these people he reveals a bit more of himself and reveals a bit more of themselves and these men were in the promised land they were in the promised land they were Anointed with the same anointing as Abraham they had the faith that was written in Hebrews 11 amen where they could pass on an inheritance were carrying the word of God they were carrying the light of his presence amen they were carrying amen that light that torch that baton of the word and they were passing it on to each other amen they were Messengers to their age amen they were prophets to their age they were Apostolic amen they were in the promised landall amen hallelujah and God would reveal himself to them and and he would beet meet Jacob one night Hallelujah and show what he's going to do with the latter amen how he's going to connect Heaven and Earth again amen and he's going to provide a great connection but brother brandham said that Jacob was a Shyer he could not hold he that lad could not anchor in Jacob so it was just an experience for him that God was showing things in time Hallelujah but now Joseph comes on the scene and Joseph a man a type of perfection he comes on the scene and now God's plan is starting to change because you see the seed that he that he SED into Abraham and the seed that passed on into Isaac and the seed that passed on into Jacob Hallelujah that seed God and His Divine Redemption plan had to go into the ground amen and so that seed now that got placed into Jo Joseph of the Cod of Many Colors amen and that inheritance that was going to go to him amen God was now ordering Joseph to take that seed into the ground and Joseph was put into this into that Cliff amen and the Israelites took him into Egypt Hallelujah and God was now taking what he started of this cool church and he's taking it into the Dark Ages taking it into darkness and slavery because he said he would because the seed the corn of wheat must come into go into the ground and die and run away because God wants to express restoration he wants to express himself as restorer as a the executor of a will amen hallelujah so now God's taking and so Joseph goes into the dark into Egypt and starts prospering in Egypt and the favor comes on the Pharaoh and draws the church Into the Dark Ages and then what's happening here in the dark ages of Israel now all they're losing their identity they're losing their vision of the apostolic age they're losing their identity and knowing who they are and the slave mentality starts to Dawn upon them they start thinking denominational thoughts my the chewed down like the caterpillar and Canker wom chewed down to a stump until they thought like slaves and it was ingrained in their mind and their thinking denominational slave mentality was coming upon them they became slaves to the power of Babylon because Egypt is the influence of Babylon the Tower of Babel that's where it all went that all that wisdom and P whatever that stuff is evil that's that that was coming upon them and they were thinking that idolatrous way and even though they had circumcision and where the some did and some didn't it was dwindling it was becoming weak they were starting to lose their identity it was slowly lost and the slave mentality took residence Satan was breaking the people's connection to the almighty he was trying to stop them from believing that inheritance because you see with a slave mentality how can you receive kingship how can you if you're thinking like a slave you get fearful and the Devil comes to you and tells you this and you get fearful and scared about why slave mentality too much denominational teaching too much tree of knowledge school these Public Schools it's tree of knowledge and it's designed and engineered to unbelief absolutely there's no faith in the schools no faith it kills and that is exactly what was happening to Israel under the Egyptian Taskmaster but you see God now would not leave them that way God's not going to leave you that way he's not going to leave anybody that way he will never leave Israel that way amen God was going to raise up a prophet Hallelujah and start ministering amen true identity again and restoring truth those ordinances and practical things to further circumcision to further yes we we believe that Christ died on Calvary for us we believe the baptism of the Holy Spirit we believe these things but there's more there's more ordinance there's more statutes there's more things to come forth from a Prophet The Prophet's going to bring these things going to bring from the heaven the Lord it says that Abraham did these things as he saw up there so what Abraham brought what the prophet brought was to change and to start the restoration process from thinking slave thoughts to thinking king and queen thoughts amen amen to think Royal thoughts Hallelujah to think thoughts that a coair with Christ amen hallelujah amen God cannot leave his church Abraham's Church in slavery he will not leave them there amen but they went through a refining process amen and then when the time of the promise drawn here he raises up a prophet amen and he starts speaking the word to them and they start as they start listening to that word as they start becoming subject to that word there's very things in there that's going to stop the Angel of Death from a affecting themall there very things and equipment and actions that God has given them through his Prophet to save them Glory from the angel of death Hallelujah they came out of Egypt that was the easy part the hard part started when they crossed over the Jordan uh sorry the Red Sea CU God now got to take Egypt out of them that's the easy part Saints coming out of Egypt and all of the super natural that goes on in the first part of your life or whatever however God deals with you that's the easy part remember that's just even not even the beginning it the beginning is when you cross over Jordan that's when you really start but you see now God's going to test to see what sign Faith you've got going to test these things so now in that transition point you know there raises up this prophet and now from from the dark ages of Joseph Joseph bringing them into the Dark Ages not that he did it but it was just the way the Lord ordered it now God's going to justify he's going to bring he's going to open up justification he's going to cleanse them by baptism he's going to restore baptism to them and so he takes them out of Egypt on Eagle wings and takes baptism and they baptize in the Red Sea un Moses it says amen they come through the Red Sea unto Moses baptized cleansed Justified and now the challenge comes Hallelujah and now the the sacrificial system comes and now the hardship comes and all the trials that come because now they're in the wilderness now God was in the wilderness don't ever think that when you're in the wilderness God isn't there he's with you he's with you if you're feeling Wilderness he's there he's putting you through it for a purpose amen and so you see now that in this and now the sacrificial system is restored and the blood is spilled again and they become Sanctified priesthood to God but God's not finished Hallelujah you see under the sanctification in the wilderness it was become an open book an Open Door sorry they come from the confinements of these homes and and and having their their their their time in Egypt and now they come out through the bapst justification and now they come into sanctification and now it's a big open air preaching time it's an age of an Open Door they can now go forth and they're right in the open arid deserts of Si amen and the sacrificial system is restored but there's also an uprising against these things and and there's all these fights and things that's going on because God's testing his people and now finally after a few days they come to Kadesh and here Mo now why they coming to kades is because this is now the time where they're going to receive the first fruits this is the time of the first fruits of the Resurrection amen this is the time where they're going to taste of the fruit of the land they got it's the the Judgment seat of the whole world brother brandham called it was that kades barer and they're all standing around and they send their spon and while they're sending their spon the devils are on all of them and the devils are just p pushing thoughts into their mind you're a slave God has brought you out here to destroy you and they were making them doubt the sincerity and integrity of God and the devil knew how to do it he would play on their slave mentality he would play on this thinking of slavery and after they had had their golden Cal and all those things and done all that showed that they still had a gypt in them it showed that they were still slaves to those things even though they had been brought out unto a mixed multitud was brought out and the slavery was manifesting itself and because it's so ingrained in them yeah but God one day is going to clear all that Hallelujah God's going to make sure that that's cleared Hallelujah and he's going to show us in type going to show us in these stories just how much he's going to do it for you because all these things that happened to Israel amen they only just happened naturally and en typ and it's a natural land and all those things and they lived out a Bible but it's really showing you something Hallelujah he's really showing you what he's going to do oh my they let the fear of the enemy their faith so you see they sent the 12 Spies into the land so men of God rose up went into the land and they came back and they tasted of that land they tasted of these gifts they tasted they heard prophets they heard the stories the great healing Revival starting to take place again they were tasting of it all but right at the same time that denominational slave mentality Hallelujah that denominational slave mentality the devil's playing on them and they can't believe it it's too much for them they despise the land and the fear crippled their faith see you have faith and the devil knows that he knows you've got faith cuz God gave it to you amen but he also knows that there's things that's happened in your past that may you fearful make you scared and so he just starts winding you those ways and make try and make you try to raise up that old slave mentality but I'm here to tell you today you can be delivered from that Hallelujah you can have none of that anymore and we're going to speak on that very soon Hallelujah so they let the fear of the enemy their faith and they despised the land through fear they lost their identity as the Church of God cuz they were called out of Egypt they were called into sanctification now they've being called to the restoration of the gifts at kades Baria and the gifts of the land come to them and fear comes upon them and denominational thinking comes upon them why because they bought Egypt with them they bought that denominational thinking with them it came through all those different ages from Egypt to Kadesh came through justification it came through the the sanctification still do the same practices still did the same things it wasn't there wasn't a complete clearing of the title The Devil had come the title that Abraham had I'll give you this land and you do this and this and this when they went into the Dark Ages Satan just added a whole lot more things and took a whole lot of things away so when they came out their their title deed their understanding of their inheritance was so full of junk so full of rubbish so full of Egyptian Babylonian Tower of Nimrod stuff all of those things was filling them so Satan just had a field day it was very easy for him to just send this thought and send that thought and send that thought holding them back from eating amen hallelujah holding them back from the land holding them back from eating parch corn amen as mature Sons and Daughters by slave mentality was all brought out Hallelujah old repressed memories rose up and they desired their old C their own captain you know that happened they got scared here's Joshua and Caleb who by mixing Moses word with faith this is the key what mooses see God gave Moses the message right to prepare them to go on the land not just when they're in the land but to how to get there this is what God has done here I'm going to clear your title understanding I'm going to clear your title so he starts preaching the word only Joshua and Caleb and maybe maybe the young ones I don't know maybe they weren't so full of Egypt by that stage but the older ones they were full of Egypt so Joshua and Caleb they had the they were the only ones that believed and all those other ones fear Came Upon them and they they lost their identity because Faith connects you to your identification Faith connects you to your inheritance and when Satan can wind you up and SC make you scared and fearful and down and all those things he's trying to disconnect you but what's that song called in your darkest hour keep your eyes on Jesus amen hallelujah when there's fear all around you keep your eyes on Jesus amen and you tell that devil you tell that devil Joy is mine victory is mine the title deed is mine it doesn't matter how you feel amen amen he will anoint your feelings that's right he knows EX L what software your subconscious wrote back in that time when you were traumatized by something or you were embarrassed by something and he just stimulates that very same thing and all of those chemicals start to come up ignore it be unconscious of it amen Enoch was unconscious of those things hallelujah amen he walked unconscious of fear unconscious of what people thought amen he walked with God Amen Hallelujah Caleb and Joshua walked with God Amen they walked they listened to what Moses said they became prepared Hallelujah they were prepared to stand amen they were prepared against fear because the word came forth to prepare them and the word has come forth to prepare you listen to that message Sint listen to the message that Jesus gave you listen to it it's to prepare you it's to help you you might not understand it all but it's there for help you're the word is in you amen and as you're receiving that word it's breaking strongholds it's loosening all the grave clothes amen hallelujah because it's he is the resurrection and the resurrection has descended on the scene with an open book Hallelujah and he said come and eat it hallelujah amen but see he's the true Captain God had prepared a true Captain for them just waiting you know he prepared a true captain and that Captain was going to lead the campaign once they crossed over but Satan thought I'm going to get them and so he laid them over with demon power and fear and tormenting them in their minds and they succumbed and they disconnected from their identity disconnected from their true identity of faith and what did they do what were they saying what was their ambition let us make our captain let us make our own captain let us make our own denomination to lead us back into Egypt where it was all good what are they doing today what What did the what did Pentecost do I'll just go forward a little bit what did Pentecost do they made their own Captain where did they return to where are they now they're in Egypt they're back eating the garlic of Egypt again reflecting Hollywood feeding on the tree of knowledge again where the tree of life was presented but even though in Israel these guys had had more freedom to do that Israel they wanted to go back to Egypt but they didn't go back they died in the wilderness this is the age of people's choices so God just gives them their choice yes that's right they want to go back to Egypt good on them well bad on them we don't want to go back to Egypt amen hallelujah we've heard a word amen [Music] hallelujah hallelujah complexes of slavery became too much for them they lost hold of their title because Faith connects you to your title and your entitlement now you're not entitled to now it's h this sounds bad God doesn't owe you nothing he owes you not a thing he he wants you to believe if you believe your faith will access every promise amen you recognize you're a coair with Christ Hallelujah the word came forth from Moses to clear their title but they failed to mix it with faith they were too worried about what others thought and popular opinions the entertainments of Egypt strangled their hold on God's very presence and the reality of what was happening even though they had seen the powerful fruit of Joshua's Ministry that he brought back from the land now we're going somewhere now because you see brother Bram had a jewel Ministry Jewel a jewel um purpose Moses and Joshua Ministry was combined in brother Brandon's Ministry we'll go into that soon but remember now see Joshua went into the land and he brought back fruit he brought back a supernatural fruit from the land and they couldn't connect with it they failed The Grapes of Revelation and the testimony of victory was too much for a slave mentality it was too much for someone that thinks they're a slave think on the word what does God say about you Hallelujah if you allow negative thoughts about yourself to rest in your mind for one second it's going to affect you it's going to hurt you you can cast it down straight away the feeling might take an hour to leave but the because there's a spirit that's attached to every thought thought is you know it's not just information when Satan gives you Authority the spirit of that the demon power in that thought starts to oppress you but how much more now if you let the thoughts of God when they come yes they can rest in my mind the The Plan of Redemption I said this last time the Plan of Redemption sat in the physical mind of Mary Hallelujah for whatever time it was amen the angel descended down with a message Hallelujah and he descended down and he preached the message to Mary the bride hallelujah amen and that thought that Plan of Redemption the very hinging of salvation for Humanity Hallelujah the answer to the very Genesis situation rested in her mind it sat there and she had to say yes she had to say be it unto me according to Thy word amen she had to agree with exactly what the angel ministered to her and that's exactly what is taking place today hallelujah amen the angel ministered to Mary the Tree of Life Hallelujah because what was born in her the Tree of Life Hallelujah just started off as two cells but the coming of the Lord had begun Hallelujah the coming of the Lord was already happening by two cells amen was already formed inside her womb so what did Joshua possess what did Joshua possess that was any different from Abraham amen Joshua 1: 1-8 Moses my servant is dead now therefore arise go over this Jordan thou and all this people unto the land which I do give unto them even to the children of Israel every place that the soul of your foot shall tread upon that have I given unto you as I said unto Moses from the Wilderness and this Lebanon even unto the Great River the river Euphrates all the land of the Hittites and unto the great sea towards the going down of the sun shall be your Coast there shall not any man be able to stand before you all the days of your life as I was with Moses so shall I be with thee I will not fail thee nor forsake thee be strong and of a good courage For unto this people shalt thou divide for an inheritance the land which I swear unto their fathers to give them I don't see no easement here that's right I see nothing saying you got to wait for this amen it's yours now it's time Joshua had an open license Hallelujah to give them the land amen Joshua had the the very Victory amen where did it come from from the mouth of God hallelujah the word came forth that's the title is the word the preaching of the open book amen and so God now starts preaching an open book to Joshua in type amen starts preaching from this open book now there is nothing to stop you you are going to inherit this land little by little it's going to be done you just need to now hold the hand of the captain who are you going to meet Joshua when you cross over the Jordan amen hallelujah because you see Joshua had the whole land to give and what did he do let's just read it I just want to we're just going to go back a little bit because I want to show you now the very Mission briefing God now he doesn't just tell the people tell you to go and do something without giving you some detail house amen so he says here behold that's Moses behold an angel shall go before you to keep you in the way amen hallelujah and to bring you into the place which I have prepared beware of him and obey his voice provoke him not for he will not pardon your transgressions for my name is in him I am Jesus Hallelujah but if you shall indeed obey his voice and do all that I speak then I will be an enemy unto your enemies and then an adversary unto your adversaries for my angel shall go before you and bring you in unto the amorites and the Hittites perizzites Canaanites hites and giib isites and I will cut them off amen you shall not bow down to their gods nor serve them nor do after their works but you shall utterly overthrow them and Qui break down their images amen don't settle for Hollywood in your home don't settle for it break down those images amen utterly overthrow them don't allow Satan into your home Hallelujah don't allow those things because you see they will kill you they will destroy you they will keep you on the ground you will never be raptured if you continue to walk in Hollywood's light Hallelujah you cannot because someone that's going to be raptured will catch the word and utterly overthrow those things they will not succumb to Hollywood they will not get their Joy from the Tree of knowledge they will get their Joy from the giver and creator of Joy amen the one one and only Jesus Christ Hallelujah he is the creator of Joy he is the one amen hallelujah that's a Rapture people amen people that aren't connected to the Fashions of this world they walk unconscious of fashion amen hallelujah oh my Hallelujah so the difference between Abraham and Joshua was Abraham was in the land and given the land and Joshua now is here to restore the land but see there was no EAS on the title anymore Joshua was commissioned to take the people give them the land and lead the campaign under the headship of the captain and take them into the land and defeat everything and take them right through to defeat every single thing and God held nothing back everything that he promised he gave Hallelujah the Bible says that everything that Joshua God promised Moses and Abraham and everything it was right there everything all the ingredients all the to all the equipment all the spiritual power and everything was all there everything he had promised was manifested and All of You Shall Serve the Lord your God and he shall bless your bread and your water amen and I will take sickness away from the midst of you there shall nothing cast their young nor be Barren in your land amen the number of your days I will fulfill I will send my fear before you Hallelujah and will destroy all the people to whom you shall come and I will make all your enemies turn their backs unto you and I will send Hornets before you which shall drive out the Hite and Canaanite and the hittite from before you I will not now this is here you see now you don't want to rush ahead of the pillar of fire don't rush ahead of the program of God just surrender to the captain mixed his word that he gave through the message of the hour with faith surrender to the captain because this is how he's going to do it so don't get discouraged when you find things just keep coming at you and you there's just something why am I that's happening he's got a plan and a purpose he's predestined your fight I will not drive them out from you before you in one year L the land become desolate and the beasts of the field multiply against you little by little I will drive them out from before you until you be increased and inherit the land amen what does that mean what does that mean because I questioned and asked the Lord how do what does that mean a long time ago if he just gave you the land right now you wouldn't have the maturity to handle speaking things into existence you get angry and say something and all of a sudden 40 children would be killed by a beer so he's got to put he's got to leave some enemies in there some little complexes and things until you mature amen amen there a this is this is what he's got to do cuz you can imagine God just he's not one of those parents that just spoils their children and just gives them everything they never have to work or do anything salvation's like that but your Victory character is a victory not a gift amen hallelujah you got to go through some things amen you got to come to maturity to handle the freedom that comes from having perfect Faith Hallelujah having a clear identity no and you can say to this mountain be moved and it would happen oh God amen hallelujah amen you're like you know the the wife of the second Adam amen what did he do when he walked the Earth he had dominion over these things hallelujah amen and so you see now all of these little things inside your life and all of those things is going to just little by little and same with Israel here we'll just stay in Israel for a while we'll go back so it says you know that it's not going to happen straight away because you see God wanted to test them to see how much they love the Lord thy God Amen and so these enemies was around them a little bit you know they procrastinated but you see if they had just stayed with the captain and they just held his hand and did what he said and prayed and connected with the very campaign manager they would have just continued to inherit more and more and more and more and they would have had all of it in all of Jerusalem in about probably 40 years or whatever it may have been I don't know we're just conjecturing but how long did it take them 400 years or 500 years it took them to get the land the tribe of Dan He procrastinated for a long time and didn't hear anything he was in no man's land to I don't know procrastinating wasting time not really getting you know like Hannah she just got really sincere one day amen and she thought no I'm not going to stay Barren that's it I'm going down to the temple and I'm going to go and pray and I'm going to stay there until God does something for me because cuz I'm sick of being unfruitful I'm sick of being down I'm sick of being teased I'm sick of being troubled by demons sick of it so she really got down and she really meant business and she had a visitation from the high priest of her profession amen the high priest came and spoke a word to her and she brought forth a prophet that changed the nation amen hallelujah sometimes we have to do that amen you know there is nothing you can do to alter God's program and you cannot produce anything more than the grace of God is giv to your age amen hallelujah and so every age had their own characteristic and their own agenda from the Lord the elect and their own Revelation partial revelation of Christ until finally at the end time where God would just pour everything out and give everything but then he would Place something on like this and he would say you know I've given you everything and you can take it just hold my hand and walk with me because I'm the campaign manager and I'm going to give you it little by little amen turn not to the left or to the right and all those Idols that you wor worship before the flood he says through Joshua you know when Joshua called them all together before he died and he he gave a had a big meeting and he said you know because they still had idols and some of us still have Idols that's right in our homes some of us still have le in our houses Joshua calls a meeting before he's passing off the sea and he says all those Idols that your parents worship before the flood get rid of them and choose you this day whom you're going to serve whose side are you on where is your joy coming from where is your entertainment coming from oh my are you content Hallelujah with the lily of the valley amen are you content with the rose of Sharon fragrance in your home amen are you connected with the Tree of Life are you feasting on the tree my my Glory Glory Glory Hallelujah so now we're just going to show you something here you might have already know I was insinuating the seven Church ages in the Old Testament and see what we have here and I want to introduce you to this um this thought and this is where we're going we have Abraham and Ephesus we have Isaac and smyrner we have Jacob pergamos then we have the Dark Ages sitting in under Joseph and thyra now if we had six months we could go into all of the similarities and all of these people's lives and show you it's all there but we're not going to do that because that's not the scope so here here we have these Church ages and these guys were in the promised land these guys were in the in the apostolic age they had been connect connected with people that had a true identity a true identification they were connected they they the very Life of Christ was on display they had no troubles with with with with really being knowing their title deed knowing their inheritance but what happened in the Dark Ages is that identity started to be lost and it started to form denominational thoughts and the elect church that was crumbled down was only very little and actually God didn't use those underground churches really to to to bring the restoration he took the restoration right out of Rome he took the restoration out of a priest of Rome Luther because he wanted to do it little by little wanted to do it through Luther because he knew Luther would bring a whole lot of Egypt with him and so here we have the Red Sea we have red here I put red here because that was the blood on the ltil that stopped the Angel of Death from destroying them so that they could leave Egypt and they came across the blue here the Red Sea Under justification Sardis and then they came into the Wilderness which is Philadelphia which is where sanctification was restored where the sacrificial system was restored where the rock in the wilderness was given and God's provision was there and now we come right up to Kadesh barer in the age of Leo DEA and here we have the River Jordan and here is where the buck stops here is where you cross this you have passed the point of no return you're dead to yourself you've you've surrendered your Ambitions the ones that you're conscious of because remember even when you cross over Jordan and you enter into the land god starts to bring other things up that you didn't even know were there that's right brother you thought you died to everything and you did consciously you didn't want to do all those things andmore you were enough you were at rock bottom you're sick of it sick of sin and sick of being dealt to by enemies so you died to yourself and you got down on your knees and you prayed until God came hallelujah amen then you crossed Jordan now what do you do when you cross Jordan Hallelujah now what do you do now when you cross into the bright age amen when you come back because you see in all these ages whenever they got their experience with God they stayed where the program was but when you get your experience with God you come out you go right out of Egypt and come into the Promise Land because this is where the program is this is where it is and you will get the new birth from this message you will get the new birth from the preaching of this word amen cuz this is the word that's come to Quicken the bride this is the word that's come to Quicken the predestined seed in your life hallelujah amen so when you get born again you not going to stay at kades barer and have the gifts only Hallelujah but you're going to come into fellowship with The Giver of the gift Hallelujah you're going to come into fellowship with the descended Mighty angel with an open book hallelujah amen that Captain's going to destroy your pasten amen that's what's going to happen Hallelujah and so when you get born again you're going to Cross Jordan and all your sins are going to be taken down into the Dead Sea the lowest part on the earth amen and they're going to be swallowed up in Victory amen glory to Jesus amen and so see here you come into the bright age now you see now Joshua and all them people will go back to Israel a little bit and you see now they're sitting around they're wondering what's going on Hallelujah and they see their first Frontier is this is this big stronghold because you know what happened back in the time of Abraham am Hallelujah when God was telling him what was going to happen Abraham the devil was listening and he was building he says right then I've got 400 and something years and I'm going to make it so hard for them my he was prepared when Israel crossed the Red Sea that day Satan was prepared he was waiting for them and he had 400 years of demon power and all these things to make it so scary and he and he had it all planned out ready waiting and he knew exactly the slave mentality that was going to be into their minds and all the things and how and they would have those task masks he' anoint them and he would say things to them and beat them down just like you sometimes do with your own thinking down in your heart and you beat yourself down you call yourself stupid and you get angry at yourself and all those things my don't do that my my no you see so Satan spent 400 years and he built up these strongholds and he built up all these things just like he buil builds up things in your grandparents and parents and great great grandparents he builds up all these complexes and he makes it so hard for a Believer to receive the truth and he creates these Western civilizations full of fashion and Hollywood and schools that are going to program the children's Minds to stop them from being able to really believe Hallelujah I mean now some of our children go to school you just need to spend a lot more time to undo all of the satanic thoughts that they get every day and if you don't just remember there will be a hard one day and it will be a negative Harvest so you have to spend the time on your children spend the time when they get back from school and undo satanic thoughts undo all that thinking it will come out of their mouths if they're a loud person if they're a quiet person you've got to fish it out if they don't talk you fish it out amen start talking to them you have to because it's going in the devil's got them for 8 hours or 6 hours a day and it's going in so you need to spend the time so it's you just have to so here we are Satan prepared the enemy and he had these walls so thick that they could run chariot races around them my but God had a bride Hallelujah God had a female in there that was stuck in sin stuck in prostitution stuck in slavery and a whole life was dictating to her and everyone she was down in society no one thought anything much of her only for the wrong reason she was stuck God had a bride there and he had something had stopped the master amen he had a plan amen hallelujah so there's these big strongholds and you know they're wondering because these people were faithful people they had seen God move but they didn't know what was going to happen you see and sometimes we don't know what's going to happen right we don't know how it's going to happen but you can rest assured it's going to happen you can rest assured that God is going to rescue you out of whatever trouble you're in amen you can rest assured that maybe you can't identify completely as being the Bride of Jesus Christ yet maybe you're stuck around a 20 foot concrete wall of unbelief something that's holding you back but you can rest assured that there's going to be a word released in your life amen you can rest assur that the captain is concerned about you amen you can rest assured that he wants to marry you amen he wants to you to know that you're his bride he wants you to know that how much he loves you amen how much he wants to redeem you out of your situation Hallelujah and so they're having their meeting Joshua and his generals and all of his men and they're sitting down whatever they're doing having their parch corn amen hallelujah feeding on the word amen probably reading the law and all of a sudden the atmosphere changes and Joshua says excuse me Brothers I'm going outside and he walks outside and silhouetted if I had a bigger picture silhouetted on the horizon amen is this man standing there with a sword drawn in his hand Hallelujah and this man had a certain Poise about him of of of battles about to start amen hallelujah there's Victory about to be won and Joshua wondered if he was for him or for the enemy amen CU if he was for the enemy I think Joshua is going to have some second thoughts amen cuz this they must have commanded a bless a a real a commanding nature amen and so you see now Joshua approaches this man and he receives the very opening of the word amen he receives the message he receives the victory day he receives the very ingredient that's going to search back and undo all sin in rahab's life yeah he's going to release the very secret the mystery that was hidden in the back part of God's mind amen hallelujah on how to conquer this unconquerable Fortress amen hallelujah he's going to release the word and he took his Prophet up onto Mount Sunset glory to God and he released the word to him amen hallelujah hallelujah gave him the word and he took it back and said you must preach this seven part message you go around that City seven times amen and on the seventh time in the seventh Church age amen at the evening time amen you go around that place seven times you take the revelation of all Seven Ages and the light that Shone in every age and the revelation of Jesus Christ and you can accumulate it into one message Hallelujah and you preach that and you take your people and bequeath it to the people hallelujah and so the people the arm of the Lord amen God's Army hello they take that word amen and they start submitting to that word they surrender to that word they believe that word amen they know that this man had been Vindicated amen Joshua was Vindicated in the eyes of the people whatever Joshua said they believed amen even if they didn't understand what he was saying hallelujah they believed it Hallelujah because because God was speaking through this man Hallelujah and what this man was going to say was going to release the bride it was going to give her an identity but you see surrounding the bride's identity was prostitution spiritual prostitution you could say denominational thinking unbelief science evolution whatever it may be surrounding her thinking her whole life surrounded by the the the old Stu reality of of of sin and yet she had heard amen that there was a living God Amen she had heard that Bible days were here again Hallelujah she had heard that things were different things were changing it wasn't just going to be some religiosity anymore we're not going to worship some Stone we're not going to kiss some image Hallelujah but they're going to have a real true Living God on the scene and something r up in rahab's heart amen and she believed it and God reckoned that righteous Hallelujah God appreciated that and if you want to please God believe his word amen hallelujah if you want to give God glory get in position amen hallelujah if you want to give him glory let your life anoint him King let your life say Amen my goodness Hallelujah and so you see they obeyed what the captain said Joshua comes back to his meeting he says I've got it I've got the revelation of the Seven Seals amen I'm going to preach it hallelujah we're going to live the sermon Saints Hallelujah the sermon that we live is the very Revelation that this Captain brought Hallelujah with a sword drawer ready to destroy all the enemies amen and so you see they the next day they start obeying then on the seventh day Hallelujah they've got the trumpets ready and they're ready to shout amen Hallelujah because the Lord has descended with a shout hallelujah and they're going to shout in the evening time at the end of the seventh day we're right at the end of the seventh day it is midnight now hallelujah it's time to shout hallelujah it's time to shout the presence of God time to shout the glory of God Worthy is the Lamb oh Father Hallelujah and so they come and they go around and they do seven times one day and they shout and now Rahab is inside and all of us son nothing that she did nothing that she did all she did was believe all of her past all of those demon thoughts all of the destruction was crumbling around her but she could feel the peace Allelujah she had peace why her enemy why her whole life the past and all the pronating sin was being crumbled around her while the accusers of her foul life were being destroyed Hallelujah she was witnessing the very effect of the seven seal revelation of the captain Hallelujah to see her life crumbling all around her she was being freed she wasn't doing anything she just believed she acted upon the message Hallelujah that those spies came in with some tapes Hallelujah they came into her house and gave it some tapes amen and she started listening and she wondered oh this is different I haven't seen or heard this before amen that's right amen she just did it she didn't question it she just did it amen what happened Hallelujah her life started crumbling around her Hallelujah because there's power in the revelation of this message Hallelujah there's a reality as been talked about the reality of this message is not statutes and laws the reality is you stand in your home and watch your whole life crumble away and you come and now your old identity is destroyed amen amen hallelujah completely gone that's right no one to testify against you anymore hallelujah amen hallelujah what did you do nothing just believe the message I just I just put on Jesus Christ I put off the old manner of Life put off the old conversation because you know the new conversation putting on Jesus Christ is that very thing that will undo all the complexes it will undo all the works of darkness it'll defeat the enemy and you might not even understand why but God Knows Why and and in hindsight you look back and I go oh that's why that's what happened didn't even recognize but it happened see God interprets his word by bringing it to pass amen not just on the age level but in your life level in your home in this church it makes he makes it happen Glory Hallelujah you see now Hallelujah this just gets rich too you know so Ephesus Paul irenius Martin and Columba these men were Apostolic they had an identity linked back to Calvary they were the fathers of our faith that our hearts have been turned back to amen catch that they were connected to the message and the message of Christ he is the message ties them back to everything that was lost in Eden they were an Apostolic people amen but true to form the seed that was sewing in Abraham I mean Paul was slowly going down down down into the dark age because this false Vine was in there and so in the Dark Age under Catholic rule the church lost its identity it started thinking slave mentality for 800 years 900 years of Dark Age and you see Satan was biting that brid tree down to a stump but Hallelujah you see now God now raises up Luther and Luther comes out justification but he carries the big suitcases of Rome and then out of the English church comes John Wesley in Philadelphia and he brings sprinkling baptisms and all these things he brings bags with them the title hadn't been cleared yet there were still easements and there still claims that the devil the accuser could accuse them to stop them from manifesting as sons of God because there's hybrid seed in their teaching they were planting that hybrid seed in their congregation still and so they could only climb so far they were only becoming so much of an image of Christ they were still stuff that needed to be cleared off there was still an abstract search that needed to be made [Music] Hallelujah and so and Leo DEA the Pentecostal Church yeah yes they had the gifts and all right they thought it was it but and it looked very similar you see but they still had father son Holy Ghost baptism and and believe there's three people in the godhead and and they were they were sewing the seed into the hearts of their and they were bride they were elect in their time cuz God was still restoring he was blinking his eye at the ignorance because he hadn't restored it he was working he was going to at some stage he was going to at this stage here right at this point he's going to clear the title amen and then he's going to execute the inheritance here amen and so they carried it all with them Luther brought Rome Wesley brought Rome Pentecost brought Rome but now the Joshua commission came to bring the church out of the Wilderness and into the fullness of godu Hallelujah to take the people and so right here at Kadesh the message from 19487 whenever it started and take all the way through to about 56 to 60 you know these he was preaching all here preaching preaching preaching until about 1960 God says to the prophet you can pass this mountain long enough these people are full of unbelief it's time to turn northward William brandom it's time to take the people into the land amen the signpost has been declared and it's never failed now it's time for the commission to take place it's time to take my people into the land William brandham you are receiving the Joshua commission your ministry is changing you're going to take these people out of the Wilderness these elected seed and take them and introduce them to the mighty Angel introduce to a captain Hallelujah with a tital deed in his head to restore the way of the tree of life cuz if you eat that tree you will never die amen if you eat that tree you will be raptured off this Earth amen hallelujah that's exactly what's going to happen Saints amen because you're eating the tree of life again you will never die Hallelujah hey God may take some off the Earth but there's a people amen that will feed on the tree I believe we're feeding on the tree this morning amen we're feeding on the tree of life we're eating the Tree of Life Hallelujah we've come into connection with a captain Hallelujah that's taken now and he took justification and he he took it and he searched it back Hallelujah and instead of just having faith so that you don't get in trouble for sin this justification says you never sinned in the first place he searched an abstract search he took the title deed and he said where there's justification written on the title deed and he searched it back and he said you didn't even sin in the first place and I'm going to lay it all on the devil amen that's justification with the abstract title search the abstract search back to its beginning amen hallelujah my he took sanctification and he and he and he and he magnified it right up until Hallelujah you don't have to try and do anything it's not your own works you know this is what sanctification really became in the in these days because it was a partial understanding so he did an abstract title search right back through sanctification and gave us access to the very Grace that will change us and make us holy and give us the desires to please God Amen real sanctification true Holiness is not legalism true Holiness is search back so that we can connect to the blood we can connect to the very power the very will of God that is revealed in the blood of Jesus Christ to change you to really transform your life Hallelujah and he looked back at Pentecost amen performed an abstract search and said it didn't start in 1906 Hallelujah it started in two Zer 33 ad whenever amen hallelujah searched it right back and said this is where you come from this is the beginning of the church not 1906 with tongues amen and your hearts by the abstract that was performed by the captain with his word and his title deed searched it right back took everything that you think of yourself took everything that you believe amen and searched it back said this is not an undo everything that's right I'm going to clear it all and I'm going to show you who you are amen reveal who you are Hallelujah and help you to identify with the real you your theophan and it was dancing with God hallelujah amen amen hallelujah amen you were shouting for Joy up there you should start shouting for Joy now amen hallelujah amen the sons of God shouted for Joy the morning Stars sang together hallelujah it's time to shout Saints amen because it's that shout there's victory in shouting amen hallelujah shouting is a sure sign of Victory amen hallelujah don't hold it back amen forget your culture amen lay it down my God hallelujah amen hallelujah but shouting doesn't mean you have it but it's still a good son amen hallelujah hallelujah sometimes you know our emotions get filtered through our stupid brains and they filter it through and we just think I've got to compose myself I've got to be nice and straight you know but no no you don't have to be you can be whoever you want to be whatever God made you to be you can be that and that's one of the Mysteries that's revealed in this message is to reveal the true you so what does he do instead of you being this denominational thinking I've got to be all this and Pi he actually reveals who you are he abstract Sears you right back to the original you the you that was in his mind before the foundation of the world he clears it all and you can identify with the very real you hallelujah amen glory to his name Hallelujah amen hallelujah you've been introduced to the lawyer that can execute amen the abstract search amen the executor of the will through this title search all the claims of justification were cleared sanctification cleared Pentecost cleared Hallelujah they needed to be surrendered to the true captain and now the captain would completely remove Egypt out of Israel over the next 400 years hallelujah amen hallelujah that's taking us right through to the time of David for them you know they took them that long to inherit their land but that Captain never left them he stayed there the whole time he was with them the whole time you pul back when they went into their sodomite conditions and all of those things in the time of Judges but he was there and he was waiting and he wanted to deliver them he kept his side of the word he kept his bargain his side of the bargain or whatever you call it deal contract it's Israel that didn't keep theirs amen but there was always a testimony there was always a witness you see so Rahab when she got set free amen you know see her whole life was a certain way it was prostitution and some most of our Lives was spiritual prostitution amen all of our Lives spiritual prostitution you could say different varying factors when we were not born again and whatever you see but when the captain came the executor of the world the lawyer Amen to execute the will to execute and to perform the abstract title search to do some property law upon Israel upon Rahab Hallelujah you see Israel in their positions when they were in their positions they became the army of the Lord so that Rahab could be free so now we as the army of the Lord and our position got to set Rahab free there's many rabs out there amen I'll read this ver wait on the Lord and keep his way and he shall exalt thee to inherit the land when the wicked are cut off all the Hittites hites and jebusites you shall see it Hallelujah you will see it thank you Jesus but the wicked have to be cut off that shows that you can defeat Satan on the word of God no matter the word of God will defeat Satan any place anywhere under any condition amen if it's in the belly of a whale or if it's in the Lion's then it's if it's on the bed with a cancer or if it's laying Yonder bleeding to death in an automobile accident the word of God will defeat Satan anywhere and the weakest Christian can use it it's your god-given privilege to do it hallelujah amen this is the last quote God can never get away from his commission I've failed him I've had here about 14 years with nothing but straight discernment around and around the world till tens of thousands of times a million cases I guess I ask you one thing did it ever fail no sir and if the signpost won't fail how much more will the commission never fail if the sign that's the minor part if the sign pointing to the city if doesn't fail to tell you the cities there you know going from cadis back over and giving the signs and he's got to take the people in all right so this is what he's talking about he's right at kades B this is this this sermon called as I was with Moses so this the very God actually pointed to brother brandom the and open a hand came from heaven and opened the Bible and pointed to Joshua one and said this is you he this is this is you you're going to take the church out of this denominational age you're going to take them out right into meet the angel amen meet the Angel that's going to impregnate the bride with the word of God so the seed of God's Redemption he says here that's the Min part of the sign pointing to the city if that doesn't fail to tell you the city's there how much more will the city be there when you come amen there's the commission now my Ministry is changing it's already changed amen that was 1960 obviously so there will still be the discernment they will still carry on just as I feel that God wants me to sa them but until then I'll pray and lay hands on the sick as he told me to do and carry out my commission I've waited a long time for this but I believe now that we're ready to take the promised land and just as sure as there will be there will be some rahab's waiting amen hallelujah you were all rahab's waiting amen you were waiting for God
