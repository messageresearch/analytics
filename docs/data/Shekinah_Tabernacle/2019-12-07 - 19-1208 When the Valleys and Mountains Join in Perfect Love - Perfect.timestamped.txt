[0:00] [Music]
[3:03] Amen good morning everybody
[3:06] [Music]
[3:07] welcome to church this morning you made
[3:11] it
[3:16] so when I was a young fellow where to
[3:20] walk two to ten miles and the snow
[3:23] barefoot uphill both ways
[3:28] [Music]
[3:35] look the most powerful or the the the
[3:40] strongest toughest attitude that the
[3:43] human can have is a positive attitude
[3:45] you know if you have a negative attitude
[3:47] it's hard to get through things but if
[3:49] you have a positive attitude you get
[3:51] through things and faith gives you a
[3:54] positive attitude because you always
[3:57] believe it's all going to be a right
[3:58] it's going to get better
[3:59] God's in control all of these pods that
[4:01] the positivity that faith brings you can
[4:04] make it through any situation you hear
[4:06] of people Christians ending up and
[4:07] concentration camps and the way that
[4:12] they go through the testimonies of how
[4:14] they went through it as opposed to
[4:15] someone with no faith a no but no no God
[4:18] went through it we're totally different
[4:19] and it was their attitude it was that
[4:22] that their faith pushed through
[4:25] everything
[4:27] you know we can be in in in any
[4:28] situation in faith a positive attitude
[4:31] of faith will just get you through no
[4:33] problem
[4:34] that's this is a bit of a lesson in life
[4:36] you know because we all go through hard
[4:38] things but it's our attitude that's our
[4:40] attitude that that changes how we go
[4:43] through it you know and and the what the
[4:48] trials that we go through in life we
[4:53] kind of have to be quite tough to get
[4:57] through them is that that that's just
[5:01] how this whole thing works you know and
[5:02] I think Christians like the Lord he was
[5:06] tough
[5:07] he knew he had to go to Calvary but he
[5:10] just set his eyes on that and he went
[5:12] for it you know and I know it's a hard
[5:14] thing to say but you know God
[5:16] God can give us such a positive attitude
[5:18] that no matter what circumstance we're
[5:20] going through we can't just press on
[5:21] through it
[5:22] regardless and you know the more we the
[5:26] more we walk with the Lord the more our
[5:27] attitude changes so fast raining and
[5:29] pouring with rain we go to church
[5:30] because you know what I met you're not
[5:32] I'm saying like if everything's going
[5:34] wrong we don't can we carry on we we
[5:36] rejoice we carry on that's that's
[5:38] ultimately how a Christian operates you
[5:40] know no matter what the circumstance we
[5:42] press on in faith and we press on with
[5:43] joy that's how we do it you know Satan
[5:47] hates it
[5:47] but that's how that's how that Christian
[5:50] does it let some stand this morning in
[5:52] the first I mean I'm actually going to
[5:53] sing as I've got the joy joy joy joy
[5:55] down in my heart but we'll just some
[5:59] pray this morning Heavenly Father we're
[6:02] so grateful Lord that we can be gathered
[6:04] here this morning Lord to come and

[6:25] see that you've given us far abundantly
[6:28] above those basic necessities of life

[43:55] Lord Jesus father we humble ourselves
[43:58] under your mighty hand in this solar
[44:03] moment father Lord as we have gathered
[44:06] Lord around your throne this morning
[44:09] Lord Jesus because of the blood that was
[44:12] shed for us on Calvary and Lord Jesus
[44:15] how we read of that great historical
[44:18] fact they that God became a man and
[44:22] blood to a second Adam Lord
[44:27] Jesus to pay that penalty that the first
[44:30] Adam Oh God picked up on a bill so as we
[44:34] speak Lord in this time and terminology
[44:36] but father Lord the devil tried to
[44:39] destroy it all and he corrupted your
[44:42] church he corrupted the whole program
[44:45] and caused the Dark Age but Lord you
[44:48] said I'd restore and father you Lord you
[44:50] kept your word Lord Jesus and you've
[44:53] restored back and you've brought back
[44:55] Lord you no matter how far how dark it
[44:58] got Lord how bad it became you brought
[45:00] it back Lord there's nothing impossible
[45:02] to you Lord and far the Lord we read of
[45:05] a church that was in the first love and
[45:08] Lord by the deceitfulness of Cernan and
[45:11] Lord the busyness of life and the cares
[45:14] of this world and the lust of the flesh
[45:15] and agreed in this body oh god they left
[45:19] their first love and the church slipped

[52:13] is the treasure we have treasure
[52:15] amen pearls of great price and you know
[52:18] as we enter earn and as we worship
[52:20] Herman and just surrender all and allow
[52:24] you know when you get operated on and
[52:26] the surgeon puts you under anesthesia
[52:27] you don't there's no resistance you just
[52:31] you've surrendered everything to the
[52:33] surgeon right and it's just a man who's
[52:36] had training under the tree of knowledge
[52:37] right and we thank the Lord through
[52:40] medicine but you know that you're still
[52:42] surrendering your whole life for him to
[52:44] work through open-heart surgery so this
[52:46] morning if you're if you have a heart
[52:49] problem or whatever problem there may be
[52:51] and you know that the medical field can
[52:53] help you you and you're willing you're
[52:56] willing to surrender your whole life now
[52:59] you could die on that operating table
[53:01] you do realize that you know this is
[53:02] like Huayra stuff but you're willing now
[53:05] for the opportunity to get healed from
[53:08] that thing you're willing to lay it all
[53:10] down right you're willing to just lay
[53:12] your life down completely on that table
[53:14] and even take some funny stuff into you
[53:16] and you'd come you're gone now you're
[53:18] gone and
[53:19] keep you alive by machines now and then
[53:21] let him take these knives and cut and do
[53:24] all those things and put other stuff in
[53:25] there you're willing now if you're
[53:28] willing to do that I just encourage you
[53:30] this morning just to invite Jesus the
[53:34] divine physician the great physician
[53:36] invite him to your pew right now just
[53:39] invite them to your pew and say Lord I
[53:41] can trust a medical doctor to do that I
[53:44] can trust you to do something on my
[53:47] heart today because we are in a season
[53:50] now and I'm jumping right to the very I
[53:53] guess that's all right because it's nice
[53:55] to know where we're getting to so we are
[53:57] in a season now I really believe this
[54:00] and I'll share a lot about it but we're
[54:02] in a season now where the Lord is laying
[54:06] a plain battlefield where the devil
[54:09] cannot hide you understand do you know
[54:12] one of the greatest battlefields this
[54:14] really tickled me a lot I really enjoyed
[54:18] thinking about this but one of the
[54:20] greatest battlefields of all time as the
[54:22] valley of megiddo and it's a valley
[54:25] where you cannot hide you're in a fight
[54:28] and you're fighting until the winner is
[54:29] won amen
[54:31] so what the Lord wants to do and what I
[54:33] believe he's doing because we're at the
[54:36] end of all ends and the end of the end
[54:38] of the end right we know that we're
[54:41] right here so now he's saying that devil
[54:43] ain't gonna hide from nothing anymore
[54:45] I'm going to bring such a climate into
[54:47] this church don't worry about anyone
[54:50] else let's just think about here I'm
[54:52] gonna bring such a climate into here
[54:54] where the devil cannot hide anymore amen
[54:57] and all the little nuances that was just
[55:00] little shadows that was against you the
[55:03] little pieces of enemy maybe you've
[55:06] already got the enemy you've conquered
[55:09] that piece of lamb but he's under
[55:10] tribute you understand what I mean you
[55:14] know Israel when they conquered land
[55:16] they conquered some and the enemy got
[55:19] abolished which is what God wanted he
[55:20] didn't want them to cut the enemy under
[55:22] tribute because he knew that the enemy
[55:25] would still cause a form in this side so
[55:28] he wanted the enemy to be eradicated
[55:31] amen now many now for us who's walked
[55:34] now in this message and had the
[55:36] sanctifying power of God and the change
[55:38] of the heart and all these things and
[55:39] you and and we've gone like Israel
[55:42] through the land holding the captain's
[55:44] hand turning not that way or that way
[55:46] but he's leading us and we're holding
[55:48] his head and he's he's given us he's led
[55:51] the campaign and many times we've
[55:53] conquered things and got this and laid
[55:55] hold of that inheritance laid hold of
[55:57] this character laid hold of this trait
[55:59] laid hold of there but many as well as
[56:03] Israel the same thing repeats some of
[56:05] those enemies have just gone under
[56:07] tribute and just as my new minority has
[56:11] remained in there and hasn't been fully
[56:13] abolished yet all right and every now
[56:17] and again a situation in your life comes
[56:19] up and that little enemy under tribute
[56:22] Rises its little head and causes you
[56:24] strife or causes trouble and you're like
[56:28] Lord but I've been delivered but this
[56:31] little thing now I believe that but but
[56:37] you see now I read to you how I read
[56:40] that what I read there is the prophecy
[56:42] of John the Baptist right so so the this
[56:46] is the Ministry of Elijah now the
[56:49] Ministry of Elijah is sent to level all
[56:52] these things out and make all these
[56:54] things straight so the devil has nowhere
[56:56] to hide so the Lord can come and reveal
[56:59] himself true and faithful and rebuke the
[57:03] enemy and get rid of all the enemy not
[57:06] just some not just most not put them
[57:08] under tribute and just deal with it and
[57:10] live with it but abolish hallelujah to
[57:14] abolish the enemy therefore there needs
[57:18] to be in your life a battle an array on
[57:21] a playing field amen here we go
[57:27] can I have the musicians please don't
[57:30] there is the thought in a nutshell so I
[57:34] just want to read from Isaiah 51 you
[57:36] don't need a turn there verse 3 says for
[57:38] the Lord shall comfort Zion
[57:41] hello Zion hello precious bride of Jesus
[57:44] Christ
[57:45] the Lord shall comfort Zion he wants to
[57:48] comfort you amen so now I'm gonna take
[57:50] what John the Baptist did to a
[57:53] dispensation to a group to a nation to
[57:56] prepare a people from a religious can
[57:59] confusion or under Herod and under these
[58:01] great church and States merge together
[58:04] under Babylonian rule and all mixed and
[58:07] he leveled it out to get the people back
[58:09] to a point to Christ now I want to take
[58:12] what happened on an age level and I want
[58:15] to show you how it's going to happen
[58:16] inside you amen and so it says here for
[58:20] the Lord shall comfort Zion he will
[58:22] comfort all who waste places amen and he
[58:27] will make her wilderness like Eden who's
[58:30] thankful for that who's thankful that
[58:33] you know you started this walk and
[58:34] inside you was a wilderness a
[58:37] troublesome place but he promised and
[58:40] you can say every time you go for a
[58:42] trial in you're in a battle and it's
[58:43] hard or something happens you can say
[58:45] Lord you promised in it conditions and a
[58:48] need in it conditions the lion shall lay
[58:51] down with the lamb amen
[58:53] the wolf shall lead the child and all of
[58:55] those things right because this is a
[58:57] need in ur condition
[58:58] it's a harmonious condition and that is
[59:01] what has meant to happen in your spirit
[59:04] realm
[59:04] there's meant to be an e dinner
[59:06] condition in there now that is your
[59:08] inheritance and if I could encourage you
[59:12] to do something put that on your list
[59:14] just put that on your list now you can
[59:16] put whatever you feel lid on your list
[59:18] remember we've got a list is he rung on
[59:19] a list the dinner I make a list I made a
[59:21] list I made a list and I enjoyed making
[59:25] that list and then I held the list up
[59:26] and I said Lord here's my list and I
[59:29] know this is my inheritance and I'm
[59:31] gonna I'm gonna have this and I say Lord
[59:33] whatever it takes
[59:34] oh I need this many things I think there
[59:37] was 15 things or 18 things on my list
[59:39] you know and they weren't just one word
[59:41] things this was like a detailed
[59:44] Commission put that on your list my
[59:49] spirit realm to be a dinner
[59:52] amen spirit round to be eat dinner
[59:56] hallelujah oh my how easy am not easy
[1:00:01] but let's just cuz they'll still be war
[1:00:02] fear but how much greater could it be if
[1:00:04] your spirit realm your emotional realm
[1:00:06] could be a dinner with the lamb lays
[1:00:09] down with the lion amen
[1:00:11] where the child is led by the wolf and
[1:00:14] it's all in perfect unity and harmony in
[1:00:16] love love love is the key make her a
[1:00:21] wilderness like Eden and her desert like
[1:00:24] the Garden of God amen
[1:00:27] now that's now turning what was no man's
[1:00:31] land amen and we heard that in the in
[1:00:33] the and at the camp we heard that you
[1:00:37] know because it's so it seems to be
[1:00:40] something that we kind of think of us
[1:00:42] out our mind to be like this barren
[1:00:45] no-man's land right and and we just and
[1:00:49] it's like just this war ground right and
[1:00:51] and and it's no man's land but actually
[1:00:53] it's meant to be God's land God wants
[1:00:56] that land he wants to plant his plants
[1:00:59] in there he wants his flowers to be in
[1:01:01] there he wants his milk and honey to be
[1:01:03] in there milk and honey the land shall
[1:01:06] be flowing with milk and honey
[1:01:08] your land shall be flowing with milk and
[1:01:10] honey amen claim it right now just claim
[1:01:14] it to save my land my land shall be
[1:01:18] flowing with milk and honey my spirit
[1:01:21] realm shall be a need in it condition my
[1:01:23] wilderness shall be a Garden of God
[1:01:26] that's what I claim and I know that
[1:01:29] there's many times that things come up
[1:01:31] in my life where you know I thought that
[1:01:33] was already conquered but found out that
[1:01:35] the enemy was just under tribute and he
[1:01:37] had been subdued but you know when that
[1:01:39] came down so far and something pushed so
[1:01:42] much then it came up again I'm like oh I
[1:01:45] realize now that has not gone completely
[1:01:47] and it is and the reason is now because
[1:01:51] at the end time there needs to be the
[1:01:55] full effect of Elijah's ministry
[1:01:58] the full effect you know because you
[1:02:00] know I'm gonna tie what the prophecy of
[1:02:03] John the Baptist's I will make a way for
[1:02:06] the Lord so the Lord can be revealed
[1:02:08] I'll make the crooked paths straight I'm
[1:02:10] going to take the mountains I'm gonna
[1:02:11] bring them down the valleys I'm gonna
[1:02:13] bring them up and we're gonna have a
[1:02:14] battlefield where the devil cannot hide
[1:02:17] now I tell you what in the church
[1:02:19] environment here in this church
[1:02:21] environment the devil cannot hide in
[1:02:24] perfect love okay so now the devil can
[1:02:29] hide very easily if the church is caught
[1:02:31] up and in criticism its caught up with
[1:02:34] stickers even we can hide very easily in
[1:02:36] there because what happens is when the
[1:02:38] stickers come out nobody wants to share
[1:02:41] what's really going on inside they don't
[1:02:44] really want to share they feel afraid
[1:02:45] because they're going to get criticized
[1:02:47] about it or they go there's it's not an
[1:02:49] environment for healing but when the
[1:02:53] perfect love of God is manifested now
[1:02:56] people feel like they can share they can
[1:02:58] talk that love can bring healing and
[1:03:01] restoration because now we're speaking
[1:03:03] and now it's open now the devil can't
[1:03:05] work anymore because of love I'm an oh
[1:03:13] my love this is one of probably one of
[1:03:16] my favorite scriptures in the Bible I
[1:03:17] love it so much II there's so many types
[1:03:19] and so many key there's like one of the
[1:03:21] key stones for me in the scriptures is
[1:03:24] this Isaiah 51 verse 3 I see the whole
[1:03:26] chapter of Isaiah 51 is glorious as you
[1:03:31] know I've preached on it for those of
[1:03:33] you that have been around since the
[1:03:35] beginning I've preached on it many times
[1:03:37] actually so yeah I might be sounding to
[1:03:40] some of you like a broken record but but
[1:03:43] it does get more and more every time I
[1:03:44] preach it because the word opens amen so
[1:03:47] this is here and who deserts like the
[1:03:49] garden of the Lord amen joy and gladness
[1:03:53] shall be found there and so let's put
[1:03:56] let's let's form a search party into
[1:03:59] your spirit realm right now and let's do
[1:04:01] a search party and what do we find in
[1:04:04] your spirit realm that just be honest
[1:04:07] with yourself now we're not going to go
[1:04:09] searching inside your spirit of course
[1:04:10] right and
[1:04:11] you know you come for counseling to the
[1:04:13] pastor and you go through stuff and you
[1:04:15] you know sometimes the pastors and and
[1:04:17] the counselors they the things that they
[1:04:19] listen to what they're discovering
[1:04:22] that's inside a human spirit can be very
[1:04:25] very dark can be very horrible can be
[1:04:27] very bad can be very evil and yet
[1:04:30] because it's being shared because it's
[1:04:32] being brought out because it's being
[1:04:34] confessed because it's being shared and
[1:04:36] prayed about it gets defeated and that
[1:04:39] spirit realm gets cleansed but let's do
[1:04:42] a search down into your spirit round now
[1:04:44] and say you know what is in there what's
[1:04:47] in my mind what's in my spirit what's
[1:04:50] laying in there is it joy and gladness
[1:04:52] and if you find that there is a lot of
[1:04:55] other things in there that is hindering
[1:04:57] then you say Lord you said that my
[1:05:00] spirit realm shall be joy and gladness
[1:05:02] and I'm gonna claim that I'm gonna lay
[1:05:04] hold of it this is my inheritance and
[1:05:07] I'm gonna have that Amen hallelujah and
[1:05:10] you serve the devil as notice the devil
[1:05:13] has the leaf because God promised
[1:05:16] restoration and so you are on an
[1:05:19] inevitable path to glory you are on an
[1:05:22] inevitable part an evitable path to
[1:05:25] perfection you are on an inevitable path
[1:05:28] to no wrinkles physically and
[1:05:30] spiritually hahaha who likes that who's
[1:05:33] happy about that we are all in an
[1:05:35] eternal youth camp right let's have
[1:05:37] youth camp you ever youth camp you
[1:05:39] really you're a Tina let's not be this
[1:05:41] old wise fellow you know let's just be
[1:05:43] 18 again amen
[1:05:45] come on amen are you with me let's be 19
[1:05:48] again I think it's that song isn't it
[1:05:50] I'm here I'm 19 again amen well you
[1:05:53] really are because you know that's kind
[1:05:55] of the image that God saw when you're at
[1:05:57] your prime of you know that very
[1:06:00] threshold where you grew right up to
[1:06:02] that image and then you know from that
[1:06:04] point then now because of death this
[1:06:07] sits them but really at that very point
[1:06:10] is where a theophany
[1:06:12] is baba so anything that's cocked true
[1:06:18] anything that you can look at and search
[1:06:21] your heart because you should search and
[1:06:23] the meditation of my heart be acceptable
[1:06:25] in the Lord's sight right so anything
[1:06:28] else any shadow any hundreds anything
[1:06:31] never stand for it stand against that
[1:06:36] resist that resist the devil just keep
[1:06:39] resisting don't give up just keep
[1:06:41] pushing just keep saying Lord you
[1:06:43] promised lawyer you promised what can I
[1:06:46] do Lord Lord Lord led me to something
[1:06:48] that's going to open up this issue and
[1:06:51] deal with it he is the captain he's the
[1:06:54] five-star general because you can come
[1:06:56] up against an enemy like Israel and look
[1:06:59] at it and they're surrounding you and
[1:07:00] you don't know what to do and this is
[1:07:02] going to happen in this happening and
[1:07:04] all of our lives right now right now
[1:07:07] it's all happening we're in a battle
[1:07:10] right now this was an ordained battle
[1:07:12] this is a battle that's completely
[1:07:15] ordained it's a race that is set it's a
[1:07:22] race that is set it's set before you and
[1:07:27] he makes a table of a feast for you in
[1:07:32] the presence of your enemies to certain
[1:07:34] feast and eat those nutrients and those
[1:07:37] vitamins that are going to remove those
[1:07:39] things he said you are sanctified by the
[1:07:42] word that I preached you are cleansed by
[1:07:45] the word so there is a power in the word
[1:07:50] now as an been always preachers this and
[1:07:53] it's such a powerful foot but it's hard
[1:07:55] in a humanistic way to convey it but if
[1:07:59] you can realize how powerful the word is
[1:08:02] if it can when you see it in its spirit
[1:08:06] and what it really is and and and its
[1:08:09] greatness can be realized in your own
[1:08:11] mind and huh it'll have a greater effect
[1:08:14] in your life amen
[1:08:17] and I'm not because of me or being or
[1:08:20] anyone but and the sermon respects the
[1:08:23] Prophet deals with how to respect an
[1:08:27] office in a ministry an office and each
[1:08:31] other and all the different levels of
[1:08:33] respect you know to a point now and this
[1:08:37] when I
[1:08:37] first became a believer way way but not
[1:08:41] that far back but way back for me it's a
[1:08:43] long time when I first I when I read the
[1:08:47] book of Acts and I saw them getting
[1:08:49] healed by Peters shadow I thought my
[1:08:51] goodness I thought why can't that happen
[1:08:53] to us and then I started hearing this
[1:08:56] one talking about that one this one
[1:08:58] thing that one's wrong this one's got
[1:09:00] funny doctrines there and I realize
[1:09:02] there's no respect and the people you
[1:09:06] know like for me a young guy and you'll
[1:09:08] get may I'm not talking to you know for
[1:09:11] us as the people but and there are
[1:09:14] people that would go off don't worry
[1:09:16] about listening to brother and he's just
[1:09:17] a young fellow you know still learning
[1:09:19] don't bother
[1:09:20] they've missed it it's not me it's not
[1:09:23] me your faith draws on a gift that God
[1:09:27] placed in me you can deal directly with
[1:09:29] God right now don't deal with me just
[1:09:34] just delete me out of your eyesight
[1:09:36] close your eyes pretend that there's a
[1:09:39] minister that's been ministering for
[1:09:41] 10,000 years
[1:09:42] hallelujah an eternal being to minister
[1:09:47] then my shadow walking past there's no
[1:09:50] shadow in here will have you healed now
[1:09:53] I'm not meaning me okay I just mean like
[1:09:55] there is this if we could really see and
[1:09:58] be impacted by the enormity the glory
[1:10:02] that is being manifested right now and
[1:10:05] in each service and when God moves and
[1:10:07] when he speaks to you and you are
[1:10:09] connected to the very person of Jesus
[1:10:12] Christ this service as you are dealing
[1:10:17] with the Lord deal with the Lord right
[1:10:19] now amen
[1:10:21] I really want to get to the store day so
[1:10:25] I want to read from 1 John 4:19 don't
[1:10:28] worry about turning this very short by
[1:10:29] the time you get there we'll be finished
[1:10:31] we love him because he first loved us
[1:10:35] you know there is no there's no out for
[1:10:39] the devil and that there's no in for the
[1:10:40] devil in that we love him because he
[1:10:44] first loved us and he elected loved us
[1:10:48] he just said I love them
[1:10:51] that's it end of story I love them and
[1:10:55] then they'll love me is it in that day
[1:10:58] you shall know that I am in my father so
[1:11:04] there was the revelation of the Godhead
[1:11:06] but he takes it a bit further now and he
[1:11:08] says actually you're part of the God you
[1:11:10] are part of the Godhead did you realize
[1:11:13] that you are part of the Godhead
[1:11:17] now you don't rule like God or anything
[1:11:20] but you're part of them you're in them
[1:11:21] right it's just and you and me in that
[1:11:26] day you shall know who knows that do you
[1:11:29] know that has it impacted your life so
[1:11:32] much you think war Lord Jesus thank you
[1:11:34] thank you that I don't just see you as a
[1:11:37] triune personalities of three people oh
[1:11:40] my and then I'm just this little piece
[1:11:44] of dust and yes flesh speaking bare dust
[1:11:47] but inside the soul inside you you're
[1:11:53] part of him amen and that's why that
[1:11:58] love says we love him because he first
[1:12:03] loved us so you see let me just I'm just
[1:12:11] gonna go down but John the Baptist
[1:12:15] ministry was to level the playing field
[1:12:20] right level the battleground bring it
[1:12:22] all plain so that there would could be a
[1:12:24] direct contact with the very message of
[1:12:28] the hour which is the and he was
[1:12:31] embodied and flesh the word for their
[1:12:33] hour became flesh and he ministered in
[1:12:39] his own flesh body the Lamb that would
[1:12:41] pay for the sins of the world okay
[1:12:45] and John introduced that body introduced
[1:12:49] that lamb introduced the message of the
[1:12:53] hour and took the the elect of the
[1:12:56] patriarchs in the elect that was under
[1:12:59] all those priests that were pointing
[1:13:00] back to Moses back back in a river
[1:13:03] shimmer and
[1:13:04] them to look to the message his message
[1:13:08] was a person whose message stood
[1:13:12] hallelujah with brazen feet of judgment
[1:13:15] on the Babylonian religion of the
[1:13:18] Pharisees his message spoke hallelujah
[1:13:22] and thundered hey men against the enemy
[1:13:26] that life he looked destroyed the works
[1:13:29] of darkness but look at the very
[1:13:32] transaction how it all transpired look
[1:13:35] at how it all worked didn't look like
[1:13:39] much did it didn't look like you know if
[1:13:42] you look at it objectively now we see it
[1:13:44] by revelation we see it with eyes that
[1:13:46] can see but you look at that on a
[1:13:49] worldly level on an intellectual level
[1:13:51] and you think that was just a failure
[1:13:54] all it was as he just came up against
[1:13:57] religious people he had faith healing
[1:14:00] but then they all refused them and he
[1:14:03] just got rebuked then the table's liked
[1:14:04] him more than the leaders of religion
[1:14:07] the dibbles worshiped but all those
[1:14:10] leaders of religion rejected so people
[1:14:12] called him Beelzebub they called him all
[1:14:14] these names they called him a cult they
[1:14:17] said that you're following a man are
[1:14:20] they following a man were they following
[1:14:22] a man they were following the God of
[1:14:24] heaven manifested in a man that was
[1:14:28] introduced by John the Baptist John the
[1:14:30] Baptist message was there the greatest
[1:14:35] times in history the greatest
[1:14:38] manifestation of any life the greatest
[1:14:41] display of power that had ever struck
[1:14:44] the earth and we see it so powerful
[1:14:48] right because we're seeing with faith
[1:14:52] but to all and even the disciples
[1:14:56] Leibman they must many times they must
[1:14:59] it they couldn't see it and he got you
[1:15:02] know he said how long must I suffer you
[1:15:04] Philip how long you know and he got
[1:15:07] tired he got worn in the spirit because
[1:15:10] of their unbelief and all those things
[1:15:13] to really see the glory of the message
[1:15:19] of John to really comprehend and be
[1:15:23] impacted and to understand this message
[1:15:28] that John had brought him this being
[1:15:31] this person of the word that was walking
[1:15:34] me therefore the way that they saw him
[1:15:39] that was the level of his impact upon
[1:15:42] them the what they saw what they
[1:15:46] conceived what came in their well he was
[1:15:50] manifested in front of them would be the
[1:15:53] level of impact that he would have upon
[1:15:55] them right so the great things that it
[1:15:59] was prophesied he would make the
[1:16:01] mountains flared and the valleys up and
[1:16:03] the crooked path straight they thought
[1:16:05] the Messiah was gonna come in and the
[1:16:07] red carpet roll down from heaven and
[1:16:10] crowns and beauty majesty the earth
[1:16:13] would tremble and shake and yes so
[1:16:17] humble so simple now history has
[1:16:26] repeated the very same thing is
[1:16:29] happening right now the very same
[1:16:35] transaction is taking place right now
[1:16:40] let me tie Isaiah 40 now I can't I can
[1:16:49] use the scriptures I can use many
[1:16:50] scriptures but I'm going to just use
[1:16:52] what the Ohio River and 1930s era Elijah
[1:17:00] Amen who's thankful for Elijah alright
[1:17:04] who's thankful that God sent Elijah oh
[1:17:08] my what a glorious thing that is what a
[1:17:13] powerful loving God that he would
[1:17:15] restore it back he would there would be
[1:17:17] a repeat Ministry of John the Baptist
[1:17:21] but this repeat ministry would come and
[1:17:25] do the same the spirit and power of
[1:17:27] Elijah to come and do the same thing but
[1:17:31] on a higher level because it's on a
[1:17:33] spiritual level to cover the whole earth
[1:17:36] not just a natural level to introduce a
[1:17:40] natural man a natural message with a
[1:17:43] supernatural life but an a living
[1:17:46] natural Lamb he introduced to a natural
[1:17:50] nation in one geographical area but this
[1:17:55] Elijah would come to introduce a
[1:17:58] spiritual fulfillment to cover the earth
[1:18:02] to cover all Kindred's tongues and
[1:18:05] Nations and he would introduce the same
[1:18:08] person the same message to take the
[1:18:13] Hutt's of all of the children who's
[1:18:18] looking at modernism and hollywood and
[1:18:20] all these other things and in looking up
[1:18:23] into this and dad and ideas and tree of
[1:18:25] knowledge and all it take the hearts and
[1:18:28] turn it back to the same message as john
[1:18:32] the same person was introduced
[1:18:36] hallelujah and right now the message of
[1:18:40] John and the message of William Brennan
[1:18:43] is in this room and he is the same
[1:18:46] person manifesting but now because the
[1:18:50] lamb paid the penalty the lamb came the
[1:18:54] lamp a penalty so now that person that
[1:18:57] was introduced by Elijah as a new as in
[1:19:01] me now that's been 50 years since this
[1:19:08] transaction manifested in its full
[1:19:10] measure where the divine one would come
[1:19:14] down and a prophet would introduce this
[1:19:17] message this person this being would
[1:19:20] come down and unite with his people 50
[1:19:24] years it's been and there's been some
[1:19:26] tumultuous seas there's been some
[1:19:28] enemies coming in there's been fights on
[1:19:32] every hand there's been a timer judges
[1:19:34] this
[1:19:35] downs ups everything but there has to
[1:19:38] come a time where the purpose the intent
[1:19:41] of this ministry would come and level
[1:19:46] the playing field and level the
[1:19:49] battleground so that all those little
[1:19:51] enemies all those little foxes that are
[1:19:53] spoiling the fruit on your vine my all
[1:19:58] of them shall be done oh and we are
[1:20:03] right here right now we are right here
[1:20:06] right now just sharing these things to
[1:20:10] declare to you this the moment that of
[1:20:13] time around now we can rest assured ed
[1:20:17] if you struggle to love many of us
[1:20:21] struggle to love I struggle to love I
[1:20:23] really do because my family was an open
[1:20:25] loving family so therefore my
[1:20:27] subconscious as it takes ages to open up
[1:20:32] and really love you know and some
[1:20:35] families it's easy it's just family
[1:20:38] cultures family natures whatever but the
[1:20:43] Lord all that stuff right now
[1:20:46] if you're struggling to love to love
[1:20:50] your brothers to express it to say it
[1:20:51] can you comfortably go up to anyone in
[1:20:54] this church and tell them what looking
[1:20:57] in their eyes I love you can you do it
[1:20:59] or is there something in your spirit
[1:21:02] that feels like it's hard even though
[1:21:05] you do but it's hard and when they say
[1:21:08] it to you do you do you find it hard do
[1:21:10] you find it as they like things that
[1:21:12] resist there is it like all it's a bit
[1:21:13] too much should I it should we be
[1:21:15] talking about this is this comfortable
[1:21:17] to you alright you see now all of it
[1:21:26] those little niggly things that that
[1:21:29] make you uncomfortable and these types
[1:21:31] of transactions all of those things
[1:21:33] shall be healed
[1:21:36] you will love freely
[1:21:41] you will love openly now I'm talking
[1:21:46] about pure love now I'm not talking
[1:21:47] about figlio love or any type of and
[1:21:50] corrupt corruptible love I'm talking
[1:21:52] about now divine love love that will
[1:21:55] work no ill to its neighbor love that
[1:21:58] will just you know I'm gonna read some
[1:22:01] things man if we ever get through this
[1:22:03] it'll be a miracle but man alive this
[1:22:08] never ends men it never ends
[1:22:10] because we're speaking of eternal things
[1:22:13] we're tapping into these eternal things
[1:22:16] to identify what's happening right now
[1:22:18] and if you can just catch that that
[1:22:22] right now the valleys and the mountains
[1:22:25] are coming because of love only happens
[1:22:31] in love when love is restored what is
[1:22:34] love
[1:22:34] it's the Holy Ghost now there's been 50
[1:22:37] years of message transpiring but the
[1:22:40] Holy Ghost has been sitting on a perch I
[1:22:41] know that sounds bad but the hope that
[1:22:43] the churches have been full of legal
[1:22:45] environments where the Holy Ghost cannot
[1:22:48] really move properly and if it does move
[1:22:50] has generally been on the far end of
[1:22:52] fanaticism has to mean too much it's all
[1:22:55] majored on the emotions or it's gone way
[1:22:57] over the side and it's been too starchy
[1:22:59] and to legal and once you get on a
[1:23:02] pendulum it's very hard to get back as
[1:23:03] it be people because you're moving all
[1:23:05] these minds and all these convictions
[1:23:07] and all the ministry has even been
[1:23:08] preached then a pastor not mean been but
[1:23:12] you know and then a pastor may catch it
[1:23:14] and we've seen this happen in New
[1:23:16] Zealand a pastors caught it or a new
[1:23:19] pastors coming and you got to bring the
[1:23:21] church back to where the dynamics and
[1:23:23] mechanic can operate properly and it's
[1:23:26] very hard because it's years where the
[1:23:30] Holy Ghost is set on the perch people
[1:23:32] are sealed
[1:23:33] they're saved they've been sealed away
[1:23:35] but he's been sitting there grieved
[1:23:37] because they've been thinking this doing
[1:23:40] that what have they done and what do we
[1:23:42] all do and we're all guilty of it
[1:23:44] sharing our conscience and God help us
[1:23:49] - you know when you first got saved and
[1:23:52] you first really got saved you know you
[1:23:55] really got safe and and your conscience
[1:23:58] was wrong and you didn't do anything
[1:24:00] wrong
[1:24:00] that you thought anyway you didn't speed
[1:24:03] you didn't ticks while driving you
[1:24:04] didn't talk about anybody you just loved
[1:24:08] everybody
[1:24:09] right and you you wouldn't even think of
[1:24:13] swearing or think of saying something on
[1:24:16] the borderline of swearing because she's
[1:24:19] not say and you're but you would not
[1:24:21] want to hurt the law you had it not in
[1:24:25] you but then over time something got you
[1:24:28] so mad that you said that and then all
[1:24:29] of a sudden you found yourself saying
[1:24:31] that more and it was easy
[1:24:33] not so hard even though you know it's
[1:24:35] wrong it becomes easier to do it because
[1:24:37] why the conscience is seared now that's
[1:24:40] on an individual level and I believe
[1:24:43] that the God the Great Physician and if
[1:24:46] you just surrender yourself like you
[1:24:48] would to a doctor on an operating table
[1:24:50] under anesthetic if you'll just let the
[1:24:53] Lord come to you tonight this morning
[1:24:55] let him come and operate if anything you
[1:25:00] know I'm not trying to preach Daniel
[1:25:02] home or preach down in your mind or
[1:25:05] anything I'm just preaching about the
[1:25:06] little puts on my heart but if something
[1:25:09] strikes and you say yes I'm actually
[1:25:11] there that's what I need I want to I
[1:25:14] want God to renew my conscience yeah
[1:25:19] because you see and this is why I'm
[1:25:22] saying this this is the only reason why
[1:25:24] I'm saying this when the Prophet was
[1:25:27] over there in glory land hallelujah the
[1:25:31] voice of God see damn this is perfect
[1:25:34] love no cause he prophesies I don't
[1:25:36] understand this so good and the voice
[1:25:40] said this is the Holy Ghost that you
[1:25:42] preach perfect love and this is what
[1:25:46] this is really kind of this is this is
[1:25:48] why I'm saying all this because if the
[1:25:51] Holy Ghost is perfect love and I want to
[1:25:53] put a differentiation here or let's just
[1:25:56] discuss this
[1:25:58] the subject of being sealed with the
[1:26:01] Holy Ghost right you're sealed with the
[1:26:03] Holy Ghost it means you're sealed and
[1:26:06] nothing can take you out but you can be
[1:26:09] sealed and he can be grieved so this is
[1:26:12] a category that many of us find
[1:26:14] ourselves in and and and on an
[1:26:17] individual level and you know a church
[1:26:18] level many times churches can be in that
[1:26:22] condition with the Holy Ghost is grieved
[1:26:24] so much with most of the congregation
[1:26:27] all the time because why the conscience
[1:26:30] has have been seared but I believe this
[1:26:32] morning healing can take place I believe
[1:26:35] this morning if you just ask the Lord to
[1:26:37] renew and you a godly conscience to
[1:26:40] bring you back to refresh you so that
[1:26:42] your life hallelujah that your life can
[1:26:48] refrain from grieving the spirit that
[1:26:52] sealed you so the perfect love that the
[1:26:56] prophet went into becomes more and more
[1:26:58] every day more and more now I'm
[1:27:02] preaching to myself more than you I
[1:27:03] believe because you know now I'm not
[1:27:06] saying but I am saying I have a very
[1:27:08] high-pressure job in it and it does make
[1:27:10] me angry and so I do and this is a
[1:27:13] confession time I do grieve the Holy
[1:27:15] Spirit I do I do I say things and I get
[1:27:19] mad and I'm and I'm definitely praying
[1:27:22] about all the time lord help me Lord I
[1:27:25] want to be in I want to be like Daniel I
[1:27:29] want to be like Daniel in the middle of
[1:27:30] Mystery Babylon that even the enemy has
[1:27:33] to say he's got a spirit and the Spirit
[1:27:39] of God is in him who and that's in the
[1:27:42] Old Testament how this man however God
[1:27:45] made him he painted those chromosomes in
[1:27:48] such a way that he could live excellent
[1:27:52] now Beck's in the Old Testament now what
[1:27:54] about now right now here 120 something
[1:27:57] manuka street sorry folks Valley Road
[1:28:01] look Georgia Street so right here right
[1:28:03] here don't even know but right here we
[1:28:07] can walk
[1:28:09] with a conscience that's so it's like
[1:28:13] I'm seared to say lord please just get a
[1:28:17] nice hand of the divine supposition and
[1:28:19] scrape off the crust scrape off the
[1:28:22] crust Lord reveal its rawness again
[1:28:26] where I couldn't even hurt you because I
[1:28:29] believe I believe he can do it now I
[1:28:33] know personally right I know personally
[1:28:37] how hard you know I always thought if I
[1:28:41] see my conscience then I'll just pray
[1:28:43] and it'll come straight back no it does
[1:28:46] not come straight back oh the Lord can
[1:28:48] do it but sometimes he wants you to reap
[1:28:50] what you sow so if you start sowing
[1:28:53] something that's you know you start
[1:28:54] telling little Porky's start telling you
[1:28:57] no and it's very hard in business not to
[1:28:59] tell Porky's I tell you when people want
[1:29:01] to hear something and you really keep
[1:29:03] you you you you're in the sticky
[1:29:05] situation where if you tell them this
[1:29:06] and that's the truth you're gonna lose
[1:29:08] the contract you're gonna have a very
[1:29:10] angry client and then all these other
[1:29:11] things are going to happen or you can
[1:29:13] say something that's just a little twist
[1:29:15] just a little twist you do that all of a
[1:29:19] sudden it becomes easier the next time
[1:29:22] all of a sudden it's easy to just tell
[1:29:25] lies where's the Holy Ghost where's
[1:29:29] where's that divine love he's waiting
[1:29:32] he's up on the perch where's your
[1:29:34] experience your experiences in if you're
[1:29:38] sealed
[1:29:38] is in the sealed category yet without
[1:29:41] the experience others perfect love just
[1:29:47] one this is how the Lord's blood so
[1:29:50] powerful if you really just lay
[1:29:52] everything down just get down on your
[1:29:55] knees and say Lord and I don't want to
[1:29:57] do that anymore
[1:29:58] I really don't Lord Jesus do whatever it
[1:30:02] takes and stay there until he comes
[1:30:05] you know we too often get down and ask
[1:30:08] God for something and then get up and
[1:30:10] carry on and nothing's happened you know
[1:30:12] because we're just so busy and so
[1:30:14] pressured just if you're gonna ask the
[1:30:16] Lord for something you know like that I
[1:30:18] think that's an important thing to ask
[1:30:19] for you know there's different levels of
[1:30:22] in praise right this is a very special
[1:30:25] one I believe this is a very powerful
[1:30:26] one you kneel down and and whatever you
[1:30:30] need to do and you just open with the
[1:30:33] Lord
[1:30:34] you know and and and you wait and ask
[1:30:37] the Lord to come and heal you and then
[1:30:41] he'll come and heal you and renew that
[1:30:44] conscience back because you see it so
[1:30:46] I'm you know I'm just kind of preaching
[1:30:48] my own testimony here you know these
[1:30:50] things is all the stuff that I've kind
[1:30:51] of gone through and going through but I
[1:30:54] believe that if we can be sealed with
[1:30:58] the Holy Ghost and the Holy Ghost is not
[1:31:00] up on the perch all the time waiting
[1:31:03] just say come on come on you know these
[1:31:06] things you know the things that I do
[1:31:08] they're very easy not to do it's very
[1:31:11] easy not to lie it's very easy not to
[1:31:13] take them drive it's very easy not to
[1:31:15] talk on your phone and drive I got
[1:31:16] hands-free now it's very easy to stop
[1:31:20] swearing right it's very easy these are
[1:31:23] not things that you're addicted to or
[1:31:26] anything like that but it's also very
[1:31:29] easy to do them so you're in this kind
[1:31:32] of death and life scenario or should I
[1:31:36] say experiencing love and not
[1:31:41] experiencing as love scenario because
[1:31:44] the more you grieve him and you walk
[1:31:45] your walk in your life and and is
[1:31:48] grieved how are we going to taste of
[1:31:51] that heavenly place because I truly
[1:31:54] believe that that place that the Prophet
[1:31:57] got taken which you know is the Holy
[1:32:00] Ghost you can have more of him you can
[1:32:03] have more of the Holy Ghost this is your
[1:32:05] joy this is your inheritance
[1:32:07] you can have it more of him and all of
[1:32:10] the stickers in your life you know they
[1:32:13] they the prophets it's that when there's
[1:32:15] more water coming in you know they
[1:32:17] unfold and two leaves and then in the
[1:32:19] service you go like this you know you
[1:32:22] know people that's doing listen the
[1:32:23] service genuinely doing this in the
[1:32:25] service I see it as like the leaves are
[1:32:27] just out in this Aang Lord shine on me
[1:32:29] Lord shine on me Lord let me
[1:32:33] photosynthesize your life your life
[1:32:35] amen now I don't have to explain that
[1:32:37] remember I preached it already so you
[1:32:39] understand
[1:32:40] let me photosynthesize your light I'm
[1:32:42] worshiping but if you like this don't
[1:32:47] crunched up in me you know how can you
[1:32:50] photosynthesize my you know now to tie
[1:32:57] this because you see here is the
[1:33:00] scripture isaiah 43:2 5 it says that
[1:33:03] what John the Baptist will do but the
[1:33:05] Lord tired our prophets message straight
[1:33:07] into it on the rahowa River he said as
[1:33:09] john the baptist was sent to forerun the
[1:33:11] first coming so send I you with a
[1:33:14] message to forerunner second coming
[1:33:17] amen I seen you so he's tying the same
[1:33:21] power the same the same accomplishment
[1:33:24] but on a spiritual level on a global
[1:33:27] level and now we cannot look at that now
[1:33:31] listen as global but now you are an
[1:33:34] earth in your own right you so don't
[1:33:37] just think of this big broad thing and
[1:33:39] all the body and everything doing that
[1:33:41] but now it's on an individual level as
[1:33:43] well you are made out of the same earth
[1:33:46] that the earth was made out of amen yes
[1:33:49] amen and you are redeemed just like the
[1:33:52] earth has redeemed water blood spirit
[1:33:55] and the in glorification amen perfect
[1:34:02] love was introduced under Elijah's
[1:34:05] ministry you do realize that the purpose
[1:34:10] that the path gets made straight and the
[1:34:13] the hell's of the mess become level as
[1:34:16] to so that you can see perfect love so
[1:34:20] the perfect love can be revealed to you
[1:34:23] now if this is the purpose of Elijah's
[1:34:25] ministry is to introduce perfect love
[1:34:29] what is perfect love do
[1:34:34] amen now I don't need to preach this
[1:34:37] because being just preached it and this
[1:34:38] is how the Lord works and I'm you know
[1:34:40] and it was all in there but I don't have
[1:34:42] to preach it now but that mighty angel
[1:34:46] that came down with the open book on
[1:34:47] Mount Sunset the angel that came to
[1:34:50] Gideon when Gideon was in his lack of
[1:34:53] identity that angel came you know and
[1:34:56] Gideon he's yesterday angel he's all the
[1:35:00] miracles and if I could just open up
[1:35:03] that conversation you know let's just
[1:35:05] hypothesize it the angels is Gideon I've
[1:35:10] come this is where all the miracles are
[1:35:11] I'll tell you where the miracles are
[1:35:13] I've come to take away your fear
[1:35:16] so that faith can operate again so that
[1:35:19] miracles can happen again theaters the
[1:35:22] angel comes and says what fear not
[1:35:26] angelic visitations come to remove the
[1:35:29] fear because the enemy puts fear all
[1:35:32] over the church when the Prophet came
[1:35:34] the Pentecostal church was covered in
[1:35:36] fear human fear scared when we came out
[1:35:40] of the nomination our world was full of
[1:35:42] fear scared of things scared of being
[1:35:45] rejected scared of being thus scared of
[1:35:47] being made fun of scared of being
[1:35:50] rejected scared of being refused scared
[1:35:53] of venturing out scared of change i
[1:35:55] rebuked that because the Angels never
[1:35:59] Amen what did he come for if you can
[1:36:02] recognize this if you're scared of
[1:36:04] anything the angel needs to come to you
[1:36:09] let him come the Prophet says let him
[1:36:12] come let that lamb come and take the
[1:36:15] book hallelujah
[1:36:17] let that mighty angel to sit down into
[1:36:19] lives lead him to sit down unto you let
[1:36:22] him come down say Lord you know all of
[1:36:27] these anxieties and fears and unshare
[1:36:29] --'tis Oh Lord let your brazen feet to
[1:36:32] sin down let that angel compass at me to
[1:36:36] take away the fear
[1:36:38] fear not fear not little flock don't be
[1:36:41] scared
[1:36:42] the Lord has ordered everything he's got
[1:36:46] a race set before you all of its planned
[1:36:49] out just what with him when things come
[1:36:53] up in the church what with God amen
[1:36:55] when your neighbors start to do
[1:36:57] something wrong what was God when they
[1:36:59] try and take your land what was God when
[1:37:02] when your friends reject you what was
[1:37:04] God when you fail and fall on your face
[1:37:07] what was God when all the enemies come
[1:37:11] at you in every direction just walk with
[1:37:13] God because he is here Elijah's ministry
[1:37:18] introduced this angel integers perfectly
[1:37:20] to cast out fit and if you fear you're
[1:37:24] not made perfect and loved I'm sorry to
[1:37:27] say that but I'm not sorry because you
[1:37:29] need a hearing if you're fearful you're
[1:37:32] not made perfect in love
[1:37:34] now I don't mean you're not sealed I
[1:37:36] mean there is something that's coming to
[1:37:38] interfere with there because when you're
[1:37:41] perfect of love there is no fear what's
[1:37:45] on the pitch the Holy Ghost what does
[1:37:49] the Holy Ghost
[1:37:50] revelation Teen one revelation Teen one
[1:37:53] is the Holy Spirit right that's him
[1:37:55] that's the person you can't separate the
[1:37:57] Holy Spirit from Jesus from the mighty
[1:37:59] angel he is the same person and you are
[1:38:02] the earth you had a randon the sea that
[1:38:05] he comes down to it came to Gideon and
[1:38:09] stood in front of him he comes to you
[1:38:10] inside you to stand in you hello you
[1:38:14] came to Daniel and said Daniel I've been
[1:38:17] sent from the presence of a mighty God
[1:38:19] to tell you you loved greatly beloved
[1:38:22] you know the angel he sees you you or
[1:38:25] your greatly beloved I've come to give
[1:38:28] you skill and understanding
[1:38:30] and then they heard a man's voice that
[1:38:32] says make him understand the vision and
[1:38:34] today I pray that the Lord makes you
[1:38:37] understand this vision make you
[1:38:39] understand make you understand the
[1:38:44] season that we're living in make you
[1:38:46] understand why you're going through what
[1:38:48] you're going through and how you're now
[1:38:51] able to share how you feel safe to share
[1:38:57] your family secrets with your pastor to
[1:39:00] share your family secrets that have held
[1:39:03] your family down in a curse all those
[1:39:05] things to share them because of love
[1:39:08] because love because of a season you
[1:39:11] cannot be raptured with those things
[1:39:13] that's why this is happening that's why
[1:39:16] you're failing that's why you're falling
[1:39:18] down that's why these things are coming
[1:39:20] up that's why the enemy's under tributed
[1:39:22] now manifesting the HIDs in your life
[1:39:24] because the environments right love is
[1:39:28] here Elijah's ministry finally after 50
[1:39:33] years is finally coming into its place
[1:39:36] finally starting to all all the
[1:39:39] mechanics are coming out now the
[1:39:40] dynamics can really fly
[1:39:42] we tried before us try to make things
[1:39:47] happen try to enforce an image try and
[1:39:51] make the people message believers like
[1:39:54] an army like a military enforce all the
[1:39:58] children to be something make them into
[1:40:00] a certain image and even make the adults
[1:40:04] in the performing and the stickers come
[1:40:11] out and the Holy Ghost is on the perch
[1:40:14] watching a sealed people live under
[1:40:17] their privilege not experiencing perfect
[1:40:21] wondering why there's no miracles
[1:40:24] wondering why there's no supernatural
[1:40:27] happening and just every now and again
[1:40:29] someone breaks through turning it into a
[1:40:32] big formal military parade
[1:40:39] but then finally after many years and
[1:40:42] this is exactly how it has to happen it
[1:40:45] has to happen this way because it
[1:40:47] happened that way to Israel it happened
[1:40:49] that way and every type and shadow
[1:40:50] there's always a death burial and
[1:40:52] resurrection of a move of a revival the
[1:40:54] seed must be given buried raised again
[1:40:59] on a dispensation and then in your life
[1:41:03] the seed must be given received by faith
[1:41:07] bury die and then come back up in a
[1:41:11] resurrection there's a seven church age
[1:41:13] and every generation there's seven
[1:41:16] church ages and every individuals life
[1:41:18] you go through and that's the time where
[1:41:22] we you know in perfect love all those
[1:41:25] things it's - it's a purging it's to
[1:41:28] remove the enemies to clear the
[1:41:31] battlefield to lead a largest ministry
[1:41:36] hallelujah you know we read how much
[1:41:41] time we got
[1:41:42] we read and Zechariah chapter four and
[1:41:47] this is big for me this is really big
[1:41:49] we're sitting here right and
[1:41:52] particularly me all the time we're
[1:41:55] sitting here and we're watching the
[1:41:57] ministry and we're a joy sing but are we
[1:42:02] impressed to the level that God you know
[1:42:06] because God's expressing something he is
[1:42:09] expressing divine love he's expressing
[1:42:11] redeeming power he's worse expressing
[1:42:13] grace he's expressing the love secrets
[1:42:16] to his bride he's expressing identity
[1:42:19] he's expressing everything that's in
[1:42:22] heaven like he did with Moses and all
[1:42:24] the stuff and they made it on the earth
[1:42:26] he's expressing it all to a people now
[1:42:30] we're looking for something so great
[1:42:32] we're looking for the entire move and
[1:42:34] the great move and the third pole and
[1:42:36] the squeeze to be this big great thing
[1:42:39] don't be a Pharisee don't be a said you
[1:42:42] see cuz otherwise you'll be sad you see
[1:42:45] sorry I had to do
[1:42:47] don't do that don't do it God hides and
[1:42:53] simplicity if we headed simplicity down
[1:42:57] in the seals but my sublime acted
[1:43:00] Scripture
[1:43:01] any hidden simplicity then after the
[1:43:05] message and after the church after the
[1:43:06] redeemed that came out under the message
[1:43:08] have gone under and come back up again
[1:43:10] and revival it will still be in
[1:43:13] simplicity so don't miss it this is your
[1:43:17] opportunity here some of the greatest of
[1:43:21] its ever to transpire some of the
[1:43:23] greatest grace did he ever come to the
[1:43:26] church is here right now for you to go
[1:43:29] on an adventure who's ready for an
[1:43:32] adventure you are going to be translated
[1:43:35] soon I can't think of a better adventure
[1:43:38] than translation oh my what's better
[1:43:42] than translation amen the greatest
[1:43:56] things to prepare us the greatest
[1:44:04] nutrition environments to come over
[1:44:06] there to come to you here and your Bible
[1:44:10] studies when you're listening to
[1:44:11] messages if you're engaged and the Holy
[1:44:14] Ghost is not on the perch but you you're
[1:44:16] walking with them because this don't
[1:44:19] leave this service will the seared
[1:44:21] conscience I challenge you all of you
[1:44:25] everyone in this room don't leave this
[1:44:28] service with a seared conscience now I
[1:44:32] know I'm not saying all come up here and
[1:44:33] cry you can do whatever you like it
[1:44:35] doesn't need a heaven like there it just
[1:44:38] needs to be faith and say Lord I have
[1:44:41] I've been hurt I've been let down and
[1:44:44] it's and then I've gone and as a defense
[1:44:47] mechanism I've gone and done that well
[1:44:50] this person's done this to me therefore
[1:44:52] to to try and get revenge I've gone and
[1:44:55] said that and what would it happen you
[1:44:56] see it your conscience a little bit and
[1:44:59] then because it would see a little bit
[1:45:00] worse and worse and worse than and now
[1:45:02] its proportion now it's like a steak
[1:45:04] that's been seared on the bride for two
[1:45:06] hours you know that can happen and then
[1:45:10] it's easy and you can be sealed and you
[1:45:13] know the Prophet said that you can be
[1:45:14] sealed and even go insane
[1:45:16] you can go insane why because of little
[1:45:20] things little foxes spoil the vine I'm
[1:45:23] doing a part two of this and we'll go
[1:45:26] more into that on I think it's Wednesday
[1:45:28] week little you are he is the vine and
[1:45:32] you other branches right so you connect
[1:45:35] it on your ceiling now there's meat to
[1:45:38] be fruit beer but then these little
[1:45:40] foxes come in and they eat the buds and
[1:45:43] they and they cause things to stop
[1:45:46] fruiting so there needs to be and I
[1:45:50] believe there needs to be an environment
[1:45:52] where all of us have been impacted by
[1:45:57] what's happening in simplicity cuz it's
[1:46:00] so simple
[1:46:01] and so humble and it's so powerful is
[1:46:04] what's happening right now
[1:46:05] I can't you just have to ask the Lord to
[1:46:07] reveal this to you and I pray the Lord
[1:46:09] does what is really going on here like I
[1:46:13] said he's bringing them valleys up and
[1:46:15] the mountains down he the mountaintops
[1:46:19] right the mountaintops is those great
[1:46:22] times where it's so wonderful in you're
[1:46:25] on cloud nine right perfect love first
[1:46:28] love right first love the valleys is
[1:46:33] where you're tried and the fruit is born
[1:46:34] and you're going through it all what
[1:46:37] would happen if you had at all the
[1:46:41] former latter rain forming together an
[1:46:45] environment where you can be in such a
[1:46:47] good place in your spirit and yet you're
[1:46:50] going through a trial and you can handle
[1:46:53] that trial you can conduct yourself with
[1:46:54] joy and you can share and you're not
[1:46:57] ashamed to share the deepest horriblest
[1:47:00] evil of secrets of your life the things
[1:47:03] that happen to you maybe you were
[1:47:04] molested or something like that as a
[1:47:05] child and you too scared to tell anybody
[1:47:07] you don't want to share what the pastor
[1:47:09] you don't want to get counseling for all
[1:47:12] those things now that's an extreme
[1:47:14] example
[1:47:15] I'm trying to say there's all like there
[1:47:18] is every scale of it things that could
[1:47:20] happen and you know the Lord reminds you
[1:47:22] and you say Lord why am i struggling and
[1:47:24] then that comes back and then that comes
[1:47:26] back and then that miracles about you
[1:47:27] you say I can't you that's too
[1:47:29] embarrassing
[1:47:29] but what if love was so strong and so
[1:47:33] powerful that you've of Liberty to share
[1:47:36] their and I don't mean stand up here and
[1:47:38] share it because some things are
[1:47:39] sensitive but I'm talking about maybe
[1:47:42] with a sister a brother with the pastor
[1:47:44] you know for pre have to talk to to to
[1:47:48] work to get close once your chase a
[1:47:51] thousand into ten thousand right so in
[1:47:54] that connection and when the lovers so
[1:47:58] there and you're the valley that you're
[1:48:01] going through and that first love is and
[1:48:03] you're all there in one experience I
[1:48:07] believe that as a need in it condition I
[1:48:10] believe that's a need inner condition
[1:48:12] these things was really unfolding and
[1:48:15] opening and I'll share testimony so I
[1:48:24] was praying with Brahman one night and I
[1:48:28] always pray quite long sometimes at
[1:48:30] night and brahmam ended up sleeping
[1:48:32] because I prayed too long so I think it
[1:48:36] was quite late it was midnight or so so
[1:48:39] I'm praying Brahm and prayed first and
[1:48:42] then I'm praying and as I'm praying and
[1:48:46] we're praying for people and you'll be
[1:48:48] surprised you know like I think right
[1:48:50] this is what I think you might be
[1:48:52] different but I think how people don't
[1:48:53] know the things I'm struggling with but
[1:48:57] you know they actually do people can see
[1:49:00] people can see your faults more than you
[1:49:02] can and it's the same for me to you you
[1:49:05] know and I see things and I'm not gonna
[1:49:07] go up and go oh you're this you're this
[1:49:10] you've got this you've done this you
[1:49:12] need to do this injustice this is unless
[1:49:14] and give them a big prescription and yet
[1:49:16] the Lord wasn't even wanting you to he
[1:49:18] was actually going to do something else
[1:49:19] to remove it so you interfering with the
[1:49:21] program of God but I know I can see
[1:49:24] things right and I see what people
[1:49:25] struggling with and they say things
[1:49:27] little things and they give hints or
[1:49:28] and you see it you can't not see it you
[1:49:30] know I'm not gonna ignore it because I
[1:49:32] care I care so and I'm only you get
[1:49:36] burden for the people and your burden
[1:49:38] for something that someone's going
[1:49:40] through and you want them to get in it
[1:49:42] and I was praying in Brahman I we were
[1:49:43] praying real seriously for some
[1:49:46] situations for people now you this is
[1:49:49] the thing and I preached this years ago
[1:49:51] you can see something in someone and
[1:49:53] never tell them about it and pray them
[1:49:55] through it and they never even knew they
[1:49:57] had it and they and it's gone why do
[1:49:59] they need to know sometimes they don't
[1:50:00] the Lord works in any way he wants to
[1:50:02] sometimes he wants them to know and and
[1:50:05] and deal with it that way sometimes you
[1:50:07] can see a trait and then you pray and
[1:50:08] then the Lord shows them sometimes you
[1:50:10] see something and you pray through for
[1:50:12] somebody and it's gone and they never
[1:50:14] even knew it praise our Lord for the
[1:50:16] body of Christ white blood cells coming
[1:50:19] in destroying the little scabs and
[1:50:21] enemies right okay so so we're praying
[1:50:25] and burden for situations and then you
[1:50:28] know like something happens for me when
[1:50:30] the Lord comes close it's like you see
[1:50:33] more your discernment goes up another
[1:50:36] notch or 20 notches or whatever you see
[1:50:38] things right and then it's like wow it's
[1:50:41] kind of like the Lord's burden right
[1:50:42] here's my little burden for a couple of
[1:50:45] situations and how it's affecting things
[1:50:48] and I'm praying and asking the Lord to
[1:50:50] do and then he comes down and it's like
[1:50:52] whoa and he kind of gives you a taste of
[1:50:54] the bigger picture and you go wow man
[1:50:57] this is and next witness the valleys and
[1:50:59] the mountains thing came I was like
[1:51:02] because I was like you're dealing and
[1:51:06] it's a piece of powerful season that
[1:51:08] we're in right now where where he will
[1:51:11] do though he will bring those things
[1:51:13] together and the former letter rain
[1:51:15] falling at the same time we coming back
[1:51:17] to our first love right now coming back
[1:51:21] and going through trials of the hardest
[1:51:24] type now I don't mean the big blocks
[1:51:26] being chipped away I'm talking about the
[1:51:28] finer egg on your image and he's
[1:51:31] polishing and it's those little
[1:51:32] polishing things that can be the most
[1:51:34] embarrassing little niggly foxes that
[1:51:37] are spoiling your vine
[1:51:39] that a holding of subconscious back from
[1:51:42] rapturing faith being to be expressed
[1:51:44] because rationing faith has been you if
[1:51:46] you're sealed rapturing faith is in you
[1:51:49] and the seed of your predestined seed
[1:51:51] it's in there but it just gets limited
[1:51:54] it gets held back by the little foxes
[1:51:57] and so I'm and I didn't know Brahman was
[1:52:05] asleep I thought you see we're just
[1:52:07] praying you know we're kneeled over
[1:52:08] we're praying I might kneel down on the
[1:52:11] floor and she's like crouched over on
[1:52:13] the bed but she's now gone sleeping and
[1:52:16] I'm now like telling her all about it
[1:52:18] and I'm like wow this is what's gonna
[1:52:22] happen like this is what we're coming
[1:52:24] into becoming the Lord's going to level
[1:52:26] it out he's gonna make the crooked path
[1:52:28] straight he's good the that what he
[1:52:30] promised to do through Elijah's ministry
[1:52:32] is fully gonna manifest in that church
[1:52:34] and we're gonna have that and I said and
[1:52:36] in all of this the trials that we go
[1:52:39] through gonna be so hard and yet we're
[1:52:41] on the mountain at the same time and
[1:52:43] we're gonna have perfect love in the
[1:52:45] trial divine love for each other
[1:52:48] because it says that every joint supply
[1:52:50] of them effectually works together in
[1:52:53] love so here comes the next the pinnacle
[1:52:57] of the objective of the gospel that's to
[1:53:01] bring that body into perfection together
[1:53:03] where there's nothing to handle no
[1:53:05] sticker in the church no critical
[1:53:08] nothing no jealousy because perfect love
[1:53:12] casts out all fear and it's fear that
[1:53:14] makes the stickers because it's a
[1:53:16] defense mechanism to push back because
[1:53:19] there's stuff going on inside just keep
[1:53:21] them on so you you know that's all they
[1:53:24] all gets eradicated because of the first
[1:53:27] love because their conscience no only
[1:53:30] got this this morning about the
[1:53:30] conscience that I'm saying Lord I'm just
[1:53:33] waiting before a man in that came speak
[1:53:37] about the conscience because it's the
[1:53:39] conscience there once that gets
[1:53:41] completely renewed into a godly
[1:53:43] condition then the Holy Ghost comes down
[1:53:46] and you as an individual start to what
[1:53:49] happened to the rod when he got into the
[1:53:50] Shekinah
[1:53:51] what happened man he turned back into
[1:53:56] his original condition that rod had been
[1:53:59] beaten scraped turned completely tree of
[1:54:03] knowledge a sized that had been man
[1:54:07] knowledged and used by men to hit man
[1:54:10] and judge and whatever right and all of
[1:54:13] a sudden he goes into the Lord's
[1:54:15] presence and he's now back to his
[1:54:18] original condition and the reason why
[1:54:22] the rod turned back into the original
[1:54:23] condition it's because it was a tree to
[1:54:25] begin with now when you get put into
[1:54:28] that same present and I mean sealed and
[1:54:31] and fellowship claimed it resist the
[1:54:35] devil he will come to you and he's
[1:54:38] coming at you right now many people
[1:54:39] right now he's already trying to attack
[1:54:42] you right now especially the young
[1:54:43] people they haven't got the whole
[1:54:44] negotiate man he's going at you hard
[1:54:46] to try and keep you from the Holy Ghost
[1:54:47] but all you young people can hit the
[1:54:49] Holy Ghost today just surrender all and
[1:54:52] say Lord I'm ready don't forgive me
[1:54:55] how I lay it all down and I want the
[1:54:57] Holy Ghost and then resist the devil
[1:55:00] again keep resisting her resist them
[1:55:02] don't lick him when he got pissed at you
[1:55:06] push push push push
[1:55:08] it's a power of suggestion he's a clever
[1:55:10] marketer and sell a market stuff they
[1:55:12] put it on billboards everywhere
[1:55:13] suggesting to you and after at first you
[1:55:16] think all this junk then after a while
[1:55:18] hey why don't I just try that you know
[1:55:19] why not try that McDonald's cheeseburger
[1:55:22] such clever marketing you know you look
[1:55:24] at that thing with all the sauce and the
[1:55:26] onions and the mustard and the cheese
[1:55:27] and you're like I remember you I
[1:55:30] remember that flavor and it dates back
[1:55:33] to when I was a child and I had all
[1:55:35] these memories associated with happy
[1:55:37] hamburger with cages and all its clever
[1:55:40] devil style that's what the devil does
[1:55:43] with his peace during his lives he's
[1:55:47] lying to you he always lies and he's
[1:55:51] just he just pissed it and pushes and
[1:55:53] pushes until you either just keep
[1:55:56] resisting and rebuke him and whatever
[1:55:57] you need kick him
[1:55:59] remember how God went down there and he
[1:56:01] gave him a kick so you need to get down
[1:56:03] and give him a kick too
[1:56:05] give him a kick kick him down kick him
[1:56:09] down have the devil on the run a son of
[1:56:13] God must not be trodden down so kick
[1:56:16] that mamba down kick him down kick him
[1:56:20] down have the devil on the run a son of
[1:56:24] God must not be trodden down so kick
[1:56:27] that Mamba down kick him down you know
[1:56:33] the Lord said to the property said if
[1:56:35] you just be more sincere you can you can
[1:56:39] rebuke the member and he's the head
[1:56:41] demon and all that Sundaram is under

[1:57:12] there's waft lies just don't just resist
[1:57:17] that just
[1:57:28] think of the love that you felt when you
[1:57:31] first became aware of your soulmate
[1:57:35] think of the butterflies think of not
[1:57:39] even hungry anymore you're not hungry
[1:57:42] for food because you have food that the
[1:57:45] world knows not over it's a love so
[1:57:49] strong that your effort type disappears
[1:57:52] a connection to the divine where energy
[1:57:56] doesn't deplete think of that you think
[1:58:01] of that love that you felt when you
[1:58:03] first had eyes
[1:58:05] well that one that you knew this is Maya
[1:58:08] this is this is my this is my that's my
[1:58:10] wife that's my husband you know that
[1:58:13] feeling when when the first you know

[1:58:31] were just so infected that is your first
[1:58:35] love how you began to have feelings
[1:58:40] beyond friends how it was when you shook
[1:58:43] their hand how they consumed your faults
[1:58:47] how you couldn't wait to see them the
[1:58:51] intense butterflies with them when you
[1:58:53] held their hand for the first time just
[1:58:56] remember those time so remember it think
[1:58:58] about it think about that feeling you
[1:59:00] know that that really that that is a
[1:59:04] taste because marriage is a the Lord is
[1:59:08] expressing something there he this union
[1:59:10] between husband and wife that feeling
[1:59:13] that you got and I trust that you still
[1:59:16] get you know obviously this seasons but

[1:59:51] anything anymore if they are they just
[1:59:53] absent-minded to care their their mind
[1:59:56] is just full cuz it prisons but their
[1:59:59] mind got their heart got their body the
[2:00:03] Lord wants your body he wants your
[2:00:06] chemicals he wants the chemicals in your
[2:00:09] body to love him is it too much is that
[2:00:15] too much he wants the glands that
[2:00:18] produce the chemicals that make you feel
[2:00:20] happy he wants those glands he wants you
[2:00:24] to be so in love with him that your
[2:00:26] subconscious when you think about him
[2:00:29] produces dopamine produces serotonin
[2:00:33] hopefully there's not this is not too
[2:00:35] much for some people the children let's
[2:00:38] just call them happy chemicals and even
[2:00:41] you get so excited when you when you
[2:00:44] hear the service when you hear the
[2:00:45] preacher that is adrenaline running when
[2:00:48] you hear about rebuking the devil when
[2:00:50] you hear about your victory this
[2:00:52] adrenaline hallelujah because you're
[2:00:54] experiencing it not just in your
[2:00:57] intellect because if you just how did
[2:01:05] you feel how did you feel
[2:01:07] brothers when you worked up the courage
[2:01:10] to ask for her hand in marriage my
[2:01:14] sisters when your husband Nelson
[2:01:17] proposed how did you feel what was it
[2:01:21] feeling um just think about that your
[2:01:26] life was consumed with love sick as the
[2:01:30] Song of Solomon says you love so much
[2:01:33] that you would feel nauseous with love
[2:01:36] you were incapacitated just so thrilled
[2:01:46] the epitome of human emotion the epitome
[2:01:50] of human emotion think about it how
[2:01:55] about when they walked up the aisle at
[2:01:58] the wedding ceremony and that union was
[2:02:00] about to take place
[2:02:02] and it was all gonna cut you know just
[2:02:08] come together climb climatized
[2:02:10] the the the climax of that union the
[2:02:13] climax of all of the courtship and all
[2:02:17] of those butterflies and all of those
[2:02:19] feelings would be consummated and be
[2:02:23] joined spiritually and soul join and
[2:02:27] that feeling and that experience I
[2:02:31] believe with all my heart
[2:02:34] believing now that that is just a
[2:02:36] natural type of what we are going into
[2:02:41] just relive those memories relive those
[2:02:43] feelings if you can if you can remember
[2:02:46] what it was like if you can remember
[2:02:47] that the intense love we now that is for
[2:02:57] us in the Lord that love don't rest now
[2:03:02] rest but don't rest last night
[2:03:04] everything everything until you have
[2:03:09] that for the Lord because that that
[2:03:14] there is perfect love as it comes your
[2:03:20] soul spirit body mind and strength all
[2:03:26] consumed and as love don't leave the
[2:03:30] service with a seared conscience but
[2:03:36] little or deal with you and your seat
[2:03:38] let the Lord deal with you where you're
[2:03:41] at and say Lord there's anything that
[2:03:43] you know that you've done or that you do
[2:03:47] because of a seared conscience
[2:03:49] and that's keeping him keeping him up on
[2:03:53] that perch call him down say Lord I
[2:03:58] don't want to look at you through a
[2:04:01] lettuce anymore
[2:04:02] I don't just want to see you afar off I
[2:04:05] don't want to only just have tastes of
[2:04:07] you when is a collective energy a
[2:04:10] collective experience the Lord I want
[2:04:13] you in my home I want you in my in my
[2:04:17] office I want you in my car I want you
[2:04:22] when I walk out that door and all the
[2:04:24] pressures of the world

[2:04:28] in the mall and these Andrus females
[2:04:30] everywhere I want you when my partner
[2:04:33] sees that McNasty to me and it hurts so
[2:04:36] much
[2:04:37] I want you then I want to walk with you
[2:04:40] because perfect love is what turn sticks
[2:04:43] into trees that perfect love is what
[2:04:47] restores everything that perfect love
[2:04:50] the prophecy lay aside everything until
[2:04:53] you have it it's time for this love that
[2:05:00] you had to become a normal with the
[2:05:03] bridegroom it's time this is the hour

[2:05:10] this environment now if you don't have
[2:05:13] that this is your moment this is your
[2:05:17] time to lay hold of it and say Lord I

[2:05:27] there's anything that I'm doing if my
[2:05:29] conscience has been seared Lord renew it
[2:05:33] now Lord I lay it all down I'm sick of
[2:05:35] being like this I'm sick of making those
[2:05:37] same mistakes over and over again
[2:05:39] I'm sick of going around Mount Seir over
[2:05:42] and over again it's time to turn
[2:05:44] northward it's time to cross over it's
[2:05:46] time to be delivered it's time it's time

[2:06:32] laws in you let him put an image let him
[2:06:36] pitch it let him pitch his law with the
[2:06:41] finger of God on the table of your heart
[2:06:44] that's where that's how it gets not
[2:06:48] enforcing it from a legal perspective
[2:06:51] but here I Lord let your love come down
[2:06:57] and mercy take your finger that you

[2:07:02] it in here they be written in the
[2:07:04] revelation of my heart that's when you

[2:07:25] love to do them you love to be like him
[2:07:28] hallelujah
[2:07:30] just let conscience be renewed this
[2:07:33] morning they don't be renewed this
[2:07:35] morning all of us we all have the same
[2:07:40] or similar battles the Bible says that
[2:07:43] think not that you're the only one going
[2:07:45] through these things you know the devil
[2:07:47] likes to isolate us to our own thing and
[2:07:50] feel like we're the only one but really
[2:07:52] we're all going through it we're all
[2:07:54] having a hard time but just remember you
[2:07:59] watch what happens now and what's going
[2:08:01] on right now as you you know you lower
[2:08:05] increase your expectation
[2:08:08] but lower the expectation how you think
[2:08:11] it's going to be because great things
[2:08:14] are happening right now but it may not
[2:08:16] be the way that we think and our
[2:08:17] humanistic you know we've learned logic
[2:08:20] from school and where and how what the
[2:08:22] devil calls great in the world calls
[2:08:24] great
[2:08:24] we cannot mix that into what we think
[2:08:27] when the great things the Lord promises
[2:08:28] because the laws promised great things
[2:08:30] for us and happening they're happening
[2:08:34] uh they're happening in our midst some
[2:08:36] of the greatest things but men of you
[2:08:38] know the brother Brown said when the
[2:08:40] lamb stepped forward to take the book
[2:08:41] right he said that's the most sublime
[2:08:42] act in scripture that happened envision
[2:08:46] an eternity right look that looks like
[2:08:49] one event taking place but it's actually
[2:08:52] it's a dispensation it's a being coming
[2:08:56] to redeem as people and it's been
[2:08:58] happening for fifty years one by one
[2:09:00] little by little I'm taking them and
[2:09:03] then little by little I'm giving it to
[2:09:04] them you know he takes individual it
[2:09:09] takes them takes their book I mean
[2:09:12] little by little he says to you I'm
[2:09:13] gonna give you a little bit of time and
[2:09:15] as you get maturity as you can till the
[2:09:17] soil as you can take control as I can
[2:09:19] trust you to speak bridled um I'm not
[2:09:24] even gonna go down that route now that
[2:09:26] the bridal tongue this time can cause a
[2:09:29] lot of trouble it gets me in a lot of
[2:09:31] trouble I tell you that for free a lot
[2:09:34] of trouble but the Lord helped me the
[2:09:38] Lord helped all of us were then I
[2:09:39] believe that you know it's one of the
[2:09:41] final frontiers as this time because if
[2:09:45] you think about it the Lord wants to use
[2:09:47] that to create worlds he wants to use
[2:09:50] that town to speak all these things
[2:09:57] now how can he trust that if it's little
[2:10:01] efforts loose huh how can he trust that
[2:10:04] if it was not completely in perfect love
[2:10:08] therefore he holds that power back you
[2:10:11] watch when all the squeeze come along
[2:10:12] all that it's all timed because you will
[2:10:15] be walking in perfect love you would
[2:10:17] have laid aside everything until perfect
[2:10:20] love love worketh no ill to his neighbor
[2:10:23] he can trust it he can trust that mouth
[2:10:27] to speak maybe we'll hit that next time
[2:10:32] I want to read something prophecies we
[2:10:39] must approach God through that channel
[2:10:42] of love and faith faith listen to us now
[2:10:46] really get this this is amazing this is
[2:10:49] the first time I've seen this and
[2:10:51] comprehended it to the level that Lord
[2:10:54] showed me but we must approach God
[2:10:57] through that channel of love and faith
[2:10:59] faith takes us to the channel right love
[2:11:03] is the one that takes us in faith takes
[2:11:06] us to the channel to the sauce and love
[2:11:09] takes us oh man just chew on that a
[2:11:15] little bit
[2:11:15] chew on that faith takes us to the
[2:11:19] channel and then love takes us in man
[2:11:23] works powerfully and love worketh faith
[2:11:25] so it's all a cycle right see it here
[2:11:34] I'm gonna read this to you
[2:11:50] where's sorry
[2:11:54] any more clothes
[2:12:00] prophesies here now think of these
[2:12:04] mountains and valleys being leveled
[2:12:06] together in perfect love so this is an
[2:12:09] environment now where you can be free
[2:12:12] now the devil will you'll still have a
[2:12:14] resistance he does not want you to share
[2:12:17] your heart with someone else so they can
[2:12:18] pray for you he does not want you to
[2:12:20] confess your faults to one another and
[2:12:22] pray for each other because he knows the
[2:12:24] fervent prayer of the righteous availeth
[2:12:26] much he knows that and he will do
[2:12:29] everything in his lying power to stop
[2:12:32] the communication but let the
[2:12:35] communication of your faith work let it
[2:12:40] express and just feel free if you feel
[2:12:45] like you need to share something with
[2:12:47] someone go to them and talk with them
[2:12:49] they're not going to make fun of you
[2:12:51] they're not going to mock you they're
[2:12:52] not going to hurt you they gonna love
[2:12:54] you and care for you and pray for you
[2:12:57] the Lord will lead you but this isn't a
[2:13:00] season that these things need to happen
[2:13:02] if we're to if we if we are to to come
[2:13:06] into that position where there's the
[2:13:09] devil cannot be hidden you think why the
[2:13:12] valley of megiddo why this plain where
[2:13:14] there's no hills and valleys err there's
[2:13:16] one little mound they call it tel
[2:13:18] megiddo and it's a little hill but that
[2:13:20] hill is a man-made it's not God made did
[2:13:23] you know that she's a little hill on and
[2:13:25] Megiddo Valley it's made by men because
[2:13:27] it was a it was a very powerful military
[2:13:30] route between Egypt and Assyria and so
[2:13:36] many many people and civilizations
[2:13:39] conquered and then conquered it and as
[2:13:40] they conquered it where they built their
[2:13:42] fortresses were just turned into a mound
[2:13:45] and they've cut into it and they've seen
[2:13:47] it's actually like 27 different
[2:13:49] civilizations on top of each other ruins
[2:13:51] you know because they burn it down every
[2:13:53] time and then they rebuild and burn it
[2:13:54] down and rebuilding that's turned into a
[2:13:55] little hill it's a man-made hill don't
[2:13:58] have a tel megiddo in your battlefield
[2:14:01] the Lord wants to level it down so the
[2:14:04] devil has nowhere to hide hallelujah
[2:14:07] don't give him any when I don't be his
[2:14:10] defense
[2:14:11] because you're fearful or scared to
[2:14:13] share things now I'm not saying make a
[2:14:19] an absolute like I must gonna share you
[2:14:22] know don't do that let's just doing it
[2:14:25] again in your own ability but actually
[2:14:27] just to be realize that you are free now
[2:14:31] that this I am in this too I struggle
[2:14:34] sometimes to share things and open up to
[2:14:36] people really because of a private
[2:14:38] upbringing your head you wouldn't
[2:14:39] believe it but but anyway so you are
[2:14:45] free to do it we love each other we care
[2:14:49] for each other we can talk to each other
[2:14:51] we can share with each other we can pray
[2:14:53] for each other and we do and and I've
[2:14:56] seen over the years those that are able
[2:14:59] to do it get free a lot quicker than
[2:15:01] those that closed off and their skid in
[2:15:03] they scared of rejection or and it's not
[2:15:06] even up here because we know and we're
[2:15:08] taught that we could love each other and
[2:15:10] and we can share we can to confess our
[2:15:13] faults to each other and pray for each
[2:15:14] other but that's down here there's the
[2:15:16] problem it's down here that's been
[2:15:18] rejected by school friends and the young
[2:15:20] age because you see it's something silly
[2:15:22] or you opened up too much you know you
[2:15:24] know how you get those children and
[2:15:25] they're so innocent and they just tell
[2:15:27] you everything and they share everything
[2:15:29] and all that they're going through and
[2:15:31] everything and there's no filter right
[2:15:34] and you think all what are they gonna
[2:15:35] say you know they start talking and your
[2:15:39] friends around and it's like well here
[2:15:40] comes here come here comes all the
[2:15:42] family secrets
[2:15:43] well there's children right innocency
[2:15:46] and in their child one day they say that
[2:15:49] and they're at school or in a group
[2:15:51] environment at work and they say
[2:15:53] something in it they get shot down or
[2:15:55] laughed at then what happens as they
[2:15:57] clam up no never
[2:15:59] without the Lord's help well some sort
[2:16:01] of counseling to boss it open or
[2:16:04] Semitism or something like that it will
[2:16:06] it will stay there and they'll never be
[2:16:08] able to communicate on the same level
[2:16:09] again of innocency but in the Garden of
[2:16:13] Eden
[2:16:13] we have innocency and the Garden of Eden
[2:16:16] we as just as little children this is
[2:16:18] this happy it and malice right be as
[2:16:21] little children these little children be
[2:16:24] innocent in those things
[2:16:25] realize that we are coming back we're
[2:16:29] not a stagnant church that just gets to
[2:16:31] a certain level and when we know
[2:16:32] everything and we've got faith and we're
[2:16:34] going to get raptured but actually we're
[2:16:36] coming into an innocency but yet with
[2:16:38] revelation and with the knowledge of
[2:16:40] good and evil yet innocency yet we love
[2:16:42] each other yet there's no speakers yet
[2:16:44] there's no hatred yet there's no malice
[2:16:46] yet there's a freedom there's a liberty
[2:16:49] to share to open up and I encourage you
[2:16:53] there are some things that you need to
[2:16:55] talk about with people and if someone
[2:16:59] comes to you and says something never
[2:17:02] give them the devil any rope to make
[2:17:07] that person climb up again just listen
[2:17:09] understand understand love pray it's the
[2:17:15] only thing we can do in some conditions
[2:17:16] you might be told something that makes
[2:17:18] you feel hurt pray together this is what
[2:17:22] it's all about
[2:17:22] there's a Liberty that we have and we're
[2:17:25] coming further into that Liberty you
[2:17:28] know and right now if the devil's
[2:17:30] telling you I can't never do that it
[2:17:32] just means that he's really trying
[2:17:34] because he knows that the fervent and
[2:17:36] effectual prayer of a righteous availeth
[2:17:38] much I'm gonna read an interpretation of
[2:17:45] tongues from the smyrnaeans age but
[2:17:52] first I just want to read this quote and
[2:17:55] then we'll close this is here I am more
[2:18:01] convinced than ever in my life that it
[2:18:03] will take perfect love to enter that
[2:18:05] place there was no jealousy he's talking
[2:18:08] about when he got translated into heaven
[2:18:10] he goes there was no jealousy no
[2:18:13] tiredness no sickness no old age no
[2:18:17] death only supreme beauty and joy
[2:18:22] whatever you do lay aside everything
[2:18:26] else until you get perfect love get to
[2:18:31] where you can love everybody even every
[2:18:33] enemy no matter if the plane is rocking
[2:18:36] the Lightning is flashing or the
[2:18:39] guns of the enemy are upon you these
[2:18:41] things do not matter get perfect love
[2:18:46] now remember this is the profit now and
[2:18:50] he would have known his ministry was
[2:18:52] introducing perfect love and you Ness
[2:18:54] was just before the seals was preached
[2:18:56] so the enormity of that was probably not
[2:18:58] even revealed to him at that stage but
[2:18:59] you know who here is the one that the
[2:19:02] Lord used to to introduce perfect love
[2:19:05] and now here we are with the greatness
[2:19:08] revelation that's ever struck the earth
[2:19:10] the full book is open and an inheritance
[2:19:13] has bequeathed it's been given and we
[2:19:16] are in a position now where we not of
[2:19:19] what we say but what we do and what we
[2:19:21] live to anoint that that being that
[2:19:25] person that perfect love himself you see
[2:19:28] because God the people that walk with
[2:19:31] God right they annoyed God their life
[2:19:36] anoints him your anointing with worship
[2:19:39] you anoint him with praise you anoint
[2:19:41] him with holiness you anoint him now God
[2:19:45] reveals himself differently to every
[2:19:47] generation yet similarly right he does
[2:19:50] this Annette 1 and he'll reveal abut
[2:19:51] he'll reveal the war part of himself to
[2:19:53] that generation back in Israel he will
[2:19:55] reveal the love part he revealed us but
[2:19:57] now I shouldn't I said loved before
[2:20:00] because now as the capstone he reveals
[2:20:03] the capstone which is the very love of
[2:20:06] God and it's full measure that is what
[2:20:10] your life our life is anointing if we
[2:20:13] try and anoint the knowledge of God
[2:20:16] remember that the prophets said how the
[2:20:18] body is being developed from the feet
[2:20:20] the apostolic stride up through the
[2:20:22] chest through the arms to the mouth when
[2:20:24] all the tongues and interpretations and
[2:20:25] prophesy and then the Prophet came with
[2:20:27] the Eagle Age up until the eyes to see
[2:20:29] further and then he sealer to come up
[2:20:31] into the divine intelligence right now
[2:20:35] as those ages the people that was caught
[2:20:38] up in the vision that listen to their
[2:20:40] star of their agent listen to their
[2:20:42] messenger they anointed not by this only
[2:20:45] not by these only not by their feet only
[2:20:48] but their whole life was lived out to
[2:20:52] anoint
[2:20:52] get revelation to anoint that divine
[2:20:56] expression of God now whether they knew
[2:21:00] what exactly but we do we know what that
[2:21:05] what characteristic we are anointing the
[2:21:07] fullness of God kept therefore if we
[2:21:14] just try and anoint an epistolary age or
[2:21:16] anoint the supernatural or anoint just
[2:21:20] portions of his revelation will be still
[2:21:23] well we will be deficient and out what
[2:21:26] we're anointing but if we realize that
[2:21:28] the capstone has come and the perfect
[2:21:31] love is here anything in your life
[2:21:42] anything that's resisting Homer don't
[2:21:48] leave this church don't leave the
[2:21:50] service with that
[2:21:52] don't leave the service with a seared
[2:21:54] conscience because you need that Holy
[2:21:57] Ghost either to seal you if you're not
[2:22:00] all you need the Holy Ghost if you're
[2:22:03] sealed to come fellowship with you
[2:22:07] because that perfect love so that your
[2:22:10] life can anoint them it's a it's like a
[2:22:13] snowball of glory I like them once it
[2:22:18] starts rolling it gets better and better
[2:22:20] and better
[2:22:20] alright but until it does it's like man
[2:22:23] you're just sitting there and it's how
[2:22:26] you can't living under Assiut conscious
[2:22:29] living under some sort of fear like
[2:22:30] gideon within that angel comes and i
[2:22:33] pray that he comes like he came to Peter
[2:22:34] in the prison maybe you're in a little
[2:22:37] prison right now and your conscience has
[2:22:38] been seared and it's been hard for you
[2:22:40] and you've struggled with this one
[2:22:41] little thing your conscience be see it
[2:22:43] may that angel come to your pew now and
[2:22:47] sit there and strike you on the side and
[2:22:50] you and say stand up Peter stand up out
[2:22:53] of your conscience seared present stand
[2:22:55] up home ah
[2:22:59] stand up and watch the chains fall off
[2:23:02] stand up and watch the prison doors open
[2:23:06] Peter stand up and watch your liberty as
[2:23:09] you walk into it walk into your Liberty
[2:23:12] hallelujah
[2:23:14] walkin and walk out amen walk out of it
[2:23:19] just keep walking walking with God if I
[2:23:27] had a thousand tongues if the Prophet
[2:23:29] said to express this
[2:23:32] may the Lord reveal it I'm just
[2:23:36] expressing this by the Lord's grace if
[2:23:40] you are not saved accept Jesus Christ as
[2:23:43] your Savior now if you have not been
[2:23:47] baptized in water be baptized now be
[2:23:51] baptized now don't wait don't wait there
[2:23:57] is nothing to wait for but give it now
[2:24:00] because there's everything to give for
[2:24:06] he wants to trade your broken down
[2:24:10] messed up emotional in turmoil life
[2:24:13] that's ruined and can only go to hell he
[2:24:16] wants to trade that for a life full of
[2:24:18] love peace faith joy eternal life
[2:24:22] rapture unity fun glories he wants to
[2:24:27] trade you who's who loves that trade I
[2:24:30] think that's a very unfair trade but I
[2:24:34] thank the Lord for His grace her by
[2:24:36] while we were in soon as he came that
[2:24:39] life for us and then he said even when
[2:24:41] you still sanae's it head mine have my
[2:24:44] book of life have my record he wants to
[2:24:48] give you his record he doesn't want it
[2:24:50] to eat it you cannot appear before him
[2:24:52] with your record or your works you
[2:24:55] cannot but he wants to give you this
[2:24:59] alleluiah be baptized now if you have
[2:25:06] not received the baptism in the Holy
[2:25:08] Spirit receive it now anyone on that
[2:25:12] camera receive it now why not me
[2:25:21] why not now why not why not anyone
[2:25:26] sitting in these seats why not now take
[2:25:31] the Lord he wants to trade you your life
[2:25:35] for his
[2:25:37] your ruins like that hill on Megiddo he
[2:25:42] wants to give you his life that was
[2:25:45] given on the hill of Mount Calvary he
[2:25:49] wanna trade
[2:25:51] somebody's gonna trade it's not me by
[2:26:02] the way it's just inspiration I had no
[2:26:05] plans to say any of that but the Lord is
[2:26:08] gracious the Lord is merciful the Lord
[2:26:10] is working hallelujah you know how much
[2:26:13] resistance has been to get this across
[2:26:17] man and not and you know it makes a
[2:26:20] minister really pray Lord are you trying
[2:26:23] to do this or resist the devil you got
[2:26:26] to know this you got to know where you
[2:26:28] stand
[2:26:28] you've got to know and say Lord and you
[2:26:33] get in and then the thought comes if the
[2:26:39] Lord gives something that devil does not
[2:26:41] like he'll resist everything you always
[2:26:44] have been saying all Wednesdays in
[2:26:46] Sunday's always crazy the night before
[2:26:49] day before whatever because this is this
[2:26:51] male to be delivered and the devil does
[2:26:53] not want their mail and the devil does
[2:26:56] not want to be exposed and today as an
[2:26:58] exposure this is an expose but welcome
[2:27:03] to the it's bow of Satan
[2:27:07] he is exposed as a defeated broken back
[2:27:12] being a tool in the hands of God on a
[2:27:15] leash and he's about to go to the lake
[2:27:17] of fire now he wants to take as many
[2:27:20] people with him don't let him resistant
[2:27:26] he's screaming out don't listen to the
[2:27:37] lives it's all lies of the devil roll
[2:27:43] away the stone
[2:27:44] and let the resurrection and the life
[2:27:47] speaks and call you out of your tomb
[2:27:50] call you out roll away the stone roll it
[2:27:56] away let nothing interfere with that
[2:28:01] direct amen roll it away if you have not
[2:28:13] received the baptism of the Holy Spirit
[2:28:14] receive it now press on to that perfect
[2:28:18] love which will take you to that
[2:28:20] beautiful and joyful place beyond the
[2:28:23] curtain of time the Holy Ghost is the
[2:28:27] earnest of our inheritance therefore the
[2:28:31] Holy Ghost that he got to me brother
[2:28:33] bear have got taken and he got plunged
[2:28:35] and you could say immersed and the
[2:28:38] fullness of what we're preaching right
[2:28:40] now the Spirit of God and you get tasted
[2:28:43] we go to Kemp and we get caught up into
[2:28:46] heaven because the minister says let's
[2:28:47] go to heaven and then the presence
[2:28:48] proceeds the glory precedes the person
[2:28:51] and we feel that presence right why
[2:28:55] can't you have in your life don't leave
[2:29:00] the service with a seared conscience
[2:29:01] don't leave with a said conscience but
[2:29:06] let God God scrape off the crust let God
[2:29:10] restore you let God fill you with the
[2:29:14] Holy Ghost let God heal your heart let
[2:29:17] god take you and hold you and mess out
[2:29:21] your heart right now
[2:29:22] let God pull you to himself but look at
[2:29:26] him through a letter anymore don't look
