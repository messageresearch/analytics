Bibles to oh I I know the scripture but I don't know where it is I'll just have to find it amen I'm just privileged to be here this evening amen and just by the Lord's Grace you know we're here hallelujah he places us where we're meant to be and amen and I believe that tonight has been predestined and pre-ordained of God and that everyone that's here has been predestined and pre-planned and we are going to have a jubilee amen amen are you are you excited this evening Hallelujah I'm excited Hallelujah you know every time I come up to minister you know I never know exactly what the Lord is going to do or how he's going to tie things together you have a skeleton and then you allow the Lord to operate and I'm going to behave this evening amen hallelujah because you can get excited because the word is exciting the Lord is exciting amen amen I get excited about the word and even studying and it all starts coming together and you just like the pressure starts to come off a little bit you know because you you can see the vision unfold so you know now where the Lord's got to go but now you still got a you're still a bit tense because you're preaching the word of God you know and it's a Eternal thing we're dealing with here we're not just dealing with thoughts of man but we're dealing with the word of God and lives can be changed and you know we've got some young people in this room their hearts can be changed tonight you know the things can happen amen hallelujah Jubilee can happen Hallelujah under the preaching of the word and the atmosphere of the Holy Ghost amen let's just turn to James 1:25 and we'll also turn to Leviticus 16 this scripture just makes me blessed you know and the sermon is called discovering your Jubilee Hallelujah discover your Jubilee amen amen and I believe that we are discovering our Jubilee and this year we're going to discover things that we've never seen before amen amen hallelujah hallelujah so it says but whoo lookth into the perfect law of Liberty and continueth therein he being not a forgetful hearer hearer but a doer of the work this man shall be blessed in his deed and then we'll just turn to Leviticus 16:29 to give us a context and a bit of the history of this Jubilee and this shall be a statute forever unto you that in the seventh month on the 10th day of the month all of you shall afflict your souls and do no more work at all amen amen hallelujah you should have found rest whether it be one out of one of your own country whether it be one of your own country or a stranger that sojs among you for on that day shall the priest make an atonement for you to cleanse you that all of you may be clean from all your sins before the Lord it shall be a Sabbath of rest unto you all of you shall afflict your souls by a statute forever and then we're just going to turn you can have your seats and I'll just keep reading now I'm going to turn to Leviticus 25 but you don't have to turn there unless you want to and and thou shalt number the seven sabbaths of years unto thee seven times seven years and the space of the seven sabbaths of years shall be unto thee 4 and9 years then shalt thou cause the trumpet of the Jubilee to sound on the 10th day of the seventh month has anyone been have you notice that it says 107 there's a there similarities in the the NuMe numerology of the Bible amen there that that that's talking about something special there amen why he puts that on the 10th day of the seventh month amen hallelujah Revelation 10 chapter 7 AM amen now Revelation 10 chap 7 just so that we can catch the context here Revelation 10:7 10 verse 7 Revelation 10:7 sorry um so so the context we have here brother brandom's Ministry the the voice that was sounding to declare the mysteries of God was to restore the original Jubilee to bring it back into effect he didn't bring another Jubilee because the original Jubilee happened when Jesus Christ stepped on the scene and and began to fulfill the scripture and began to be the answer to the many scriptures of the Old Testament to fulfill that he would come to set the captives free and he came to heal the brokenhearted and he came to loose the chains and to loose everything that BS met Hallelujah he came to do that and then Satan managed with the slimy hands to come and cl out it all over again until finally the church endered up in a dark age and the truth got crushed down under the ground and then finally it got the Lord said I'll restore and then and then then the a jubilee trumpet could sound again when the Lord called a prophet and he raised him up and he gave him the pure word of God again so that the Jubilee could sound again and man could become completely free from sin completely free with no other things against him with nothing against his character nothing against his name nothing against anything completely free because a gospel trumpet could sound with it's a certain sound again brother Brandon preached uncertain sound a few times and it's quite a great deep meaning that really if the trumpet gives an uncertain sound who can prepare himself to battle but now he's saying in these sermons now cuz he you know brother brandom and and and and it's normal that he doesn't want to outright declare exactly what's happening without sounding proud or putting people off but he's declaring that there's a certain sound a certain trumpet that's sounding that's going to set the people free amen hallelujah so we'll just keep reading and thou shalt number seven sabbaths of years unto thee 7times s years and the space of the seven sabbaths of years shall be unto thee 40 and9 years then Thou shalt cause the trumpet of the Jubilee to sound on the 10th day of the seventh month in the day of atonement shall ye make the trumpet sound throughout all your land hallelujah amen amen so here is the uh on the 10th day of the seventh month I'm probably going to mix words up because there's a lot of that sort of wording but on the 10th day of the seventh month here comes a priest the high priest and he goes in behind the veil and he does and he puts the blood on the mercy seat and he sprinkles it on the mercy seat and he sprinkles it on the altar of incense and he sprinkles it back on the mercy seat seven times for seven Church ages there was blood upon The Mercy Seat but then after he sprinkled it seven times for seven Church ages he the high priest himself now comes back out cuz God's accepted the blood now he comes back out from behind the veil and now the Jubilee trumpet can sound now that's a great thing and I'm trust you're catching that that here an aent generation now as an antitype of what happened in the Old Testament is for seven Church ages the high priest was behind that Veil that man had covered up with Traditions again cuz the Old Testament the high priest or the the the sh was behind a veil the presence of God behind a veil that no man could approach and then Here Comes The Mercy Seat Jesus Christ in plain view to bind up the Brokenhearted to heal the people's hearts to to heal the breach in humanity and to bring people into connection with God so that they could be free here he is hanging and then when finally it was accepted and the veil rent and they realized that there was nothing in that Old Testament sacrificial system anymore because that Ark wasn't even in there but it opened and here he was and hanging in plain view to say here I am I'm the great high priest I'm I'm going to set the people free I'm going to cause a jubilee and he shouted Hallelujah he shouted while he was on the cross and and and and and great things happened when he shouted that second time Hallelujah do you know what happened when he shouted there was a shaking happening hallelujah amen and and death started to give way amen the the grave started opening Hallelujah he shouted man a jubilee trumpet started sounding already while before he had even gone down Hallelujah and they started opening up the grave started opening up and then when he went down and he took the keys of hell and death and then he came back up and because those graves are open the Saints came out and they had their Jubilee amen hallelujah what a jubilee they had but yet as we talked about just earlier Satan started to bind over the power of that shout the power of that Jubilee the power of that gospel trumpet Satan started to use and get into the church and starts to fiddle around and and cause all this stuff to come over the church and bring them down make them lose their first love and Fall Away into into all sorts of slavery again and then finally in the end Hallelujah after the blood had been to to atone seven times on that Altar and the high priest had been behind that Veil because Satan closed them off again then finally because of the result of Revelation 10:7 an atonement meaning cuz the word atonement we always as we always think the atonement is the is Jesus on Calvary the atonement is the result of Jesus on Calvary because the word atonement means to be at Oneness and Calvary brought people to become one with God Amen but when Satan clouds it all over this the the approach has been tainted the approach to God has been broken and so now he's sort of pushed back again from the church that's why in Luther's time there he blinked at much ignorance in Wesley's time he blinked at much ignorance CU they had Babylonian ISM and Catholicism and and darkness all over them still they couldn't really connect properly they couldn't have a real true Jubilee especially as the generations after went on because they were clouded over with all sorts of different things but finally right now as a Revelation chapter 10: 7 a prophet comes on the scene and starts sounding that certain trumpet again and he starts sounding that Jubilee why because a high priest Revelation 101 the great descended Mighty Angel the high priest himself Jesus Christ stepped out and he tore the veil of man's Traditions tore up that man had covered over when he tore it and he stepped out the the priest would we can say brother brandham saw him and he started speaking with an open book and he sounded the Jubilee trumpet and then he took it around the world let it be heard throughout all your land amen you know in Revelation chapter 5 John when he saw the seals was open he said everything in Earth and Heaven and under the Earth heard me shout Rejoice heard me shouting rejoicing Hallelujah CU it was an exciting thing that now after years of man's religion and all sorts of falsities and and and a powerless Godless thing finally God could step forth and sound a true trumpet of Jubilee now we're under that sounding amen we are under the sounding of that trumpet that's giving you a certain sound that's telling you this is what the bridegroom this is what the the the king likes this is how the king wants you to dress you know spiritually I'm not just meaning physical I'm talking about a spiritual dress hallelujah amen we could take that back to the Book of Esther I'll just touch on it I won't go into it too much but just to see it and I think it's so good to be able to go back into the Old Testament stories to see you see now here is the same picture that I'm just portraying here was shown in the book of Esther here is the king and he's this King the great king of the all the land a hezus and now he types our bridegroom and here he is and now there's three pools in this king's Ministry this king's going to make three pools upon his kingdom cuz he's trying to find a bride Hallelujah but first he's got one that's already existing and so he makes a pool and there's this great big Gathering everybody's there F's there but she's in another little thing of her own you know she's decided she she's not really the relationship's been broken a little bit she's doing her own thing with the with their other churches the other ladies amen and and and the King now goes to pull for her and she refuses she doesn't want to come to the king she doesn't want to hear the king's message she doesn't want to hear the call of the king Hallelujah so now the King has a p and he pulls the virgins in and he pulls them in from all the land and he gives them his word his Bible he gives them everything that the Babylonian Kingdom could offer and now they get assigned to their chamberling Chambers and they get assigned to their place that they all dwell and now they've given a year to prepare themselves but one Hallelujah just one somehow she catches a revelation that that that she needs to listen to this human instrument somehow she knows there's something deeps down inside her and she understands or she knows that what that man that human messenger has to say is going to give make me a reflection of the king somehow she knew deep down the faith of the Son of God inside her stting to s and she knew now if whatever this man says I'm going to clothe myself in that I'm going to wear that I'm going to walk like that I'm going to practice my step and I'm going to practice my smile just how he is so she submits herself to the human leader the human instrument that that the King was using to to find himself to look after those that are meant to be the bride the coming bride now here's these other virgins these other churches you could say that now they have access to the very same King's Bible his word has Treasures his perfumes his his his doctrines his religions his everything that's right they have access all of them but one finds the channel where the king's heart can be expressed where the certain Jubilee trumpet sounding forth out of the man's mouth he the king's Chamberlain it's a beautiful picture so finally now comes the time where they present themselves and they start going past the king and there's always just a slight little easement against that person and there's a something against them there's something different then finally this one Esther walks past and he sees the reflection of himself he sees the one that that that's part of him she's walking like the way that's inside of him she is the feminine reflection of the king and he can't but help but take it to himself Hallelujah because she heard now she received a jubilee from being a orphan slave girl Hallelujah and she came into the presence of the king to become a nation changing Nation saving person because she heard the Jubilee trumpet sound out of the mouth of a human instrument now this is that's the there's a key into that amen that it's important it says that if you believe your Prophets You shall prosper there's a scripture it's in Chronicles I think somewhere in Kings of Chronicles believe your Prophet believe the prophet and you shall prosper amen you shall hear a certain sound it might be different from every other sound around but it's a certain sound it's a trumpet sound Hallelujah that God's going to set a people free and raise them up into a jubilee and bring them into the king's Palace to become one amen hallelujah Leviticus 25 29-31 I might just keep this tame as a Bible study I mean it won't go too long you know you can just keep it here and if a man sell a dwelling house in a walled City that he then he may redeem it within a year after it is sold within a full year may he redeem it and if it be not redeemed within the space of a full year then the house that is in the walled City shall be established forever to him that bought it throughout his Generations it shall not go out in the Jubilee but the houses of The Villages which have no wall around about them shall be counted as the fields of the country they may be redeemed and they shall go out in the Jubilee be careful that you don't put walls up around you because if you don't want to miss out amen you want to just lay your life down lay it down let nothing hold you back you just just lay everything down at the king's feet you've heard the Chamberlain you've heard the Jubilee you believe the certain sound you are hearing the trumpet sound hallelujah amen you're hearing it you're in it you're walking in it but be careful that you don't put walls up and if there's any walls in your life amen God's got a good wrecking ball amen he can break those walls down hallelujah amen and tear them all down and then you start feeling funny about a certain situation and you can feel it that it's causing a break or a breach and your relationship with God or with the people of God or somebody just lay it down to the Lord lay it down don't don't don't risk being caught up don't leave it too long be sure to walk out when the Jubilee is sounding don't fall around don't wait don't waste your time do it now and you men here this is a quote from the choosing of a bride and you men here of your denominational churches just believe this that the hour is right on you where you're going to make a choice you're either going to go into the World Council or you're going to be a denomination you're not going to be a denomination anymore you're going to have to do that and that choice is coming soon and it is a dangerous thing to wait till that last hour too because you might take on something that you could never shake out of it you know there is a time when you can be warned then if you step across that line of warning then you're already marked on the other side branded remember when the Jubilee year come and the priest rode it with his trumpet sounding that every slave could go free but if they refused to accept their freedom then he had to be taken to the temple to a post and an O bore him through the air and then he served his master always it was put on his ear as a type of hearing Faith cometh by hearing he heard the trumpet but he didn't want to listen to it and many time men and wom hear God's truth and see it Vindicated and proven truth but yet they don't want to hear there's some other reason there's some other choosing that they have then than to face up to truth and facts therefore their ears can be closed to the gospel they'll never hear it again my advice to you when God speaks to your heart you act right then don't hold anything back the moment he speaks lay it down be a sincere believer be transparent don't hold anything in or be hiding stuff you just find the right biblical channel to release it do it the right way be sound amen amen hallelujah lay it all down again amen so I'm going to go through some personal stuff not my personal but our personal you know like practical I like practical likes practical amen stuff that's applicable for our own walk two Corinthians 10 3-6 says these are practical messages measures of the Jubilee life for though we walk in the flesh we do not war after the flesh for the weapons of our Warfare are not carnal But Mighty through God to the pulling down of strongholds casting down imaginations and every High thing that exalts itself against the knowledge of God and bringing into captivity every thought to The Obedience of Christ and having in a Readiness to Revenge all Disobedience when your obedience is fulfilled amen that sounds like a really big task but actually it becomes an autonomous action as a Christian as someone that actually cares about what they're thinking someone that really realizes that there's two things going on up here a battle and then as you hear the word and you start to eat the word and you start to hear that certain sound that's your Jubilee because now you have a discernment what do that doing that jubilees trumpet sounding for you is actually sing into your life to calibrate your thinking to help you to understand what is true and what is false now it's not intellectual Affair though it is something that's in your mind as well but really it's coming into your soul now and it's actually feeding your soul and it's bringing your soul into Dominion to give you dominion over this flesh because this flesh will always love sin this flesh will always enjoy seeing fleshly things and and and and things that Satan has put in the world to distract men and women this flesh will always like that if you let it go off rampant it'll get worse and worse and worse until finally the flesh will raise up and will cause a Revolt in your life and cast your soul down under your feet again and you'll be trampled over by your own flesh but the word the certain trumpet that You' have heard has got the very spirit of God in every thought every concept that this message has come to preach to you every thought has been has got the restored very spirit of God behind it to back it up to give the devil a good smack Amen to raise your soul into its position to feed you to give you strength amen from day to day the blood shall never lose its power why because the blood is the life in the blood now the physical chemistry spilled on the earth and washed away 2,000 years ago but the life that was in that blood SP speaks better things than that of Abel it speaks a voice of Resurrection that will come right in to your very life and it will place a finger of judgment now right on the very sin right on the very cause of the sin in your life right on the very thing that's troubling you and it will put his finger right on it we're going to read about it and I just love that because Isaiah 61 we're going to read about that this day the scripture is fulfilled when Jesus came and he sat down and the anointing was so great brother Bram said and you know sometimes when we just get that anointing we just blow off the Steam and we just get stimulated you know amen hallelujah but you know as you I think as as as it becomes more and more in your life you know you you can control it sometimes you need to just sit down and and wait on the Lord to say something and it can be and and Channel all that great energy of God into a word for somebody or whatever it may be but there's a he just says this day the scriptures fulfilled you know and apparently it was just brother Brandon said that it was just like silent he said but under that great anointing because of great scriptures being fulfilled and here he is declaring it on the earth the fullness of the word declaring the Fulfillment of scripture and he says I've come I'll read that I think it's wonderful says the spirit of the Lord God is upon me because the Lord has anointed me to preach Good Tidings unto the meek and he has sent me to bind up the Brokenhearted to Proclaim Liberty to the captives Hallelujah and the opening of the prison to them that abound Hallelujah not I'll open the prison somewhere down the track he's going to open it forever there is no prison door there is no shackle or fet that hasn't been loosed or opened or broken Every Chain has been broken AMJ amen amen it's all been broken amen we have to walk out of that hallelujah amen now now now here I'll just keep reading to them that are bound to proclaim the acceptable year of the Lord then he closed the book and then there's a 2,000 year breach between the next part as it just reads but the Jubilee was a was established then cuz here comes Jesus in his ministry and here he comes to fulfill the Jubilee scripture and to pay for it all and to bring man back into Oneness with God and then Satan clouds it all over as we spoke about before and he causes the church to go down into a Dark Age clouding it all over making it all just so far away and pushing God as a carrot on the end of a stick that you can hardly find what is he trying to do he's trying to what has he done he's broken down the altar he's broken down the altar which has been preached yesterday last week is our approach to God it's our approach our our way to worship God The Altar and there's an altar that that that that that has been that needs to be restored Hallelujah and and and the altar gets restored under the spirit of Elijah the spirit of Elijah was sent in the end time to build that altar up again so that man could approach God again amen hallelujah so I'll just throw this in here and you can just research it yourselves because it's quite it's quite an interesting thought Revelation 8 when the seventh seal opened and there was silence in heaven and then straight after the seventh seals open right here comes these angels and seraphim and they fill up the fire from the altar you know and and and and and the prayers of saints and they pour incense and the prayers of saints go up and becomes an incense before the Lord something's been restored something's been built back up again so that the prayers and the and all of these things can actually approach God again and then he goes Voom and sends fire down to the Earth and Thunders and Lightnings and earthquakes and starts to shake the Earth again and a great Revival Hallelujah I'll leave you with that it's a deep thought but just read it and just ponder over it and meditate on it what's been restored He restored the approach to God the altar was restored man's approach to God was restored again Hallelujah now when that reproach gets restored now he can now because of that oness because you see there is a benefit of being one with God there's a benefit of a restored there's a benefit of hearing the trumpet am and that benefit is your Jubilee am that benefit is a a complete freedom and a complete revelation of who you are and a discernment to discern every Antichrist spirit in your midst so that you and me can Reign above all of it and become an invincible Army a church that the devil doesn't know what to do with amen hallelujah a church that can discern turn every thought can cast down every imagination that's of the devil amen amen that's right and not dwell on anything that's going to cause a breach in the body because now you've been raised to a special anointing a special calling to walk in love now to walk in love the devil's going to fight Us in every area and he's going to try and crush us down and he's going to parade woman in front of the men and he's going to put all sorts of opportunities for sin his objective is to fill your flesh and your spirit that unconverted part of you to fill it with all those things of the Earth again and Youthful lusts and and pride of life and and busyness and all these things he wants to crowd it all over cuz he wants that Soul which is meant to be up and Dominion in your life he wants to push it down and get that flesh back rolling you but you've heard a trumpet sound Hallelujah a jubilee trumpet that's actually placing your back in its position Hallelujah so that you can have dominion in your own life and you're not on your own I'll drop this in here right now it was coming later but we'll drop it now Hallelujah the Lord himself shall descend with a shout make it personal don't just think he's off on some beach over in Rome and somewhere in America on the land over there he's come to you amen because you were born with a Babylonian Spirit that's right you were born with that sinful nature and that spirit that loves Hollywood you were born with it but what does he do hallelujah what does he do Hallelujah he comes down amen and what does he do he wants to bind Satan by circumstance amen amen hallelujah that's right he wants to bind them by circumstance in your life for you Hallelujah so see now through the spirit you shall mortify the Deeds of this body not because you've worked yourself up into some religious thing and praying all night and gone so hardcore but because this is the age where he himself would come down and set his feet upon the Water of your spirit and upon the Earth of your flesh and declare with an open book come and eat come and feast with me Hallelujah a personal Jesus Christ in your life amen to sub you the flow of your old nature and your flesh that wants to rule and he sets it down like Stone Hallelujah his feet as brass placing judgment upon the sin in your life amen placing judgment and this is this is what it reads now because you see now at the end because here brother brandom comes on the scene here sorry in Isaiah 61 he's come to preach the acceptable year of the Lord and to heal and bind up up and set free and then Satan covers it over again and then he sends Revelation 10:7 on the day of atonement and he declares a certain sound and it it releases that Jubilee again it releases that freedom upon us again but now here comes the second part of this very chapter he's going to now the day of Vengeance of our God I'll read it to comfort all that mourn to appoint unto them that mourn in Zion hello Zion amen hallelujah amen what is he going to do Hallelujah the day of Vengeance about God is going to take Vengeance on you first not on you but on your old nature on the sin in your life on the on the devils and on all those complexes and on all the things that have held you back all your life he's come with vengeance Amen to take Vengeance on all those things to take Vengeance on every HTE and shite and iite and ivit and everything in your land and he's come to to take vengeance on them to place his finger in judgment and and and annihilate them get rid of them take them all away so that you can have freedom in your own land freedom in your own inheritance little by little he'll drive them all out little by little as you mature as you can handle the Liberty that comes with having Dominion because you have to have a maturity you can he's not just going to wipe everything out of your life and you're absolutely free ready for the Rapture straight away not that you're and experience you are ready for the Rapture as soon as you get filled with the Holy Ghost right but now God in his own desire is actually working on us day by day so that in our experience we'll be walking in the fullness of a Son of God except this body change and so we're growing in the stature of the perfect man Hallelujah every day but he won't we don't just get straight to that and our our own experience we have to go through things go through trials get character you know so that we can handle what the Jubilee has really come to give us hallelujah now I want to explain something here just to give us another understanding a good understanding of our condition our condition right now because we have be we're in the Jubilee right so we are in the Jubilee our soul has been placed in Dominion we have freedom from all these things and discernment and the thought life is becoming controlled because the Lord Has Come and descended into our life and he's taken and and the spirit has mortified the Deeds of this body you know and and because of that and because of this the anointing that we've received and we can walk into that freedom we can have that Jubilee the Lord yet that we're covered in this there there's still sin there's still this flesh there's still this old mind and the battle going on and sometimes you fail and sometimes you get angry and you speak the wrong thing you know there's still those factors and so to describe it how Satan is bound by circumstance because the Lord himself has come down and he set his feet upon your life amen and I want to talk about to to understand this concept we need to just go off into the future a little bit into the time of the Millennium you see now in the time of the Millennium Satan has not been Anil neither is he in the Lake of Fire we're in our glorified state right we're ruling and reigning over normal people that fail that die that commit naughty do do bad behaviors but they're governed and sin is not rampant like it is now it's controlled why because at the end put your spiritual thinking caps on at the end right at the very end of the tribulation the son of David himself comes down upon the Earth boom and he sets his feet upon the Mount of Olives and and and that's a big graveyard and and this great earthquake happens in Jerusalem and it divides into four and he stands there and by the word hallelujah he takes control of the earth amen and bind Satan by circumstance Hallelujah Satan becomes powerless because the son of David is sitting on his throne and ruling with a rod of iron taking governance and taking his bride to govern with him so now why are you going through all this he's teaching you how to govern because you are in the the same condition now your body has you're you're you're not in you haven't got your new Earth yet you still got a your Earth has still got corruption in it but Satan is bound by circumstance because the Lord has done with you what he's going to do with the Earth in the Millennium he's doing with you now he's coming down himself setting feet upon the the Mount of Olives of your life Hallelujah am man breaking the old graveyard you know causing an earthquake in your life to shake off all those things that are that are that have troubled you Hallelujah CU a voice that spoke from Heaven said I'll will shake everything that can be shaken Hallelujah a voice that speaks better things than that of Abel read read Hebrews 12 go through it to shake off all those things and to place you in dominion and Satan Bound by circumstance now you yet you're in a jubilee and Satan's Bound by circumstance because the Lord has descended into your life that that's a description that's to understand that you are in a it's a jubilee but it's not the complete Jubilee yet it's not the complete fulfillment of the Jubilee just like the Earth for a thousand years in the Millennium Jesus the son of David has descended upon the Earth bound Satan by C and rules with a rod of iron and he has an a bride that travels by thought and governs the Earth sin can be controlled sin can be reckoned itself dead indeed and yet it's still lying dormant there still lying there waiting till the end of the thousand years it's going to come flying back up again and then finally Hallelujah right at the end then there's the big great battle of Gog and meog and and the Satan deceives the whole earth again you know all these unconverted people they turn on us and the Lord and our great mountain and they start to fire there whatever I don't know what they do but they throw their stones at us or something they're coming for us hallelujah and God just rains fire out of heaven and he completely annihilates it all and casts the devil into the Lake of Fire and then we come to the great white Throne judgment so the same thing is going to happen to us where we're going to put on immortality so right after the great white Throne judgment John says I see a new Heaven and a new Earth come down like a brighter Dawn for a groom Hallelujah the same for us here's our word body up in heaven hallelujah amen and and it's waiting Hallelujah waiting for us Eternal in the heaven and no beginning nor end part of God's word amen hallelujah right in this thinking from it's going to come down hallelujah it's going to come down one of these days hallelujah descend a new A New Earth for us and this old Earth is going to be taken away and our soul will raise up and become one with our glorified body Hallelujah and we'll receive our complete Jubilee from off this Earth hallelujah amen I'm just so thankful for that so you see now you are in a jubilee and yet you fail and yet you've got the sinful nature and a sinful body but you're being given a a special anointing and a special food to feed you out of an open book that the Lord Jesus himself holds in his hand says come and eat this and feast on me walk before me nurse from almighty God hallelujah be strengthened so that you can have can can stand fast in the Liberty Stand Fast in your Jubilee amen which Christ has made you free and be not entangled again in the Y of bondage but Stand Fast right there looking into the perfect law of Liberty understanding that it's a law that set you free and it's a law of God that was going to keep you it's the law of the spirit the law of the spirit Hallelujah that's going to mortify the Deeds of this body the law of the spirit your faith comes in connection with that law and you can see brother Brandon preached in the Restoration in the brid tree to enforce that restoration to enforce those things and you claim it back from the devil and the Holy Ghost will come behind you and and enforce that restoration Hallelujah when it's identified when you hear the Jubilee trumpet don't wait around that's right don't wait around act act upon it amen amen hallelujah amen hallelujah Purge out there for the old liven that you may be a new lump as you are unle for even Christ Our Passover a sacrifice for us therefore let us keep the feast not with old leaven neither with the leaven of malice and wickedness but the unle bread of sincerity and Truth A little leaven leth the whole lump I have confidence in you through the Lord that you will be none otherwise minded but he that troubleth you shall bear his judgment whoever he be amen that's the enemy he's got he's he's he he traps you sometimes but then the god the Lord has put his finger straight on it and he will and he he's got a Vengeance he's going to take a vengeance upon that in your own life and cause those things to come away so that you can stay free amen amen but Feast on the bread of sincerity and truth hallelujah this I say then walk in the spirit and ye shall not fulfill the lust of the flesh for the flesh lusteth against the spirit and the spirit against the Flesh and these are contrary one to the other so that you cannot do the things that you would but if you be led of the spirit you are not under the law for if you live after the flesh you shall die but if you through the spirit do mortify the Deeds of the body you shall live for as many as are led by the spirit of God they are the sons of God for ye have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear but you have received the spirit of adoption whereby we cry Abba Father Hallelujah Stand Fast therefore in the Liberty wherewith Christ has made us free and be not entangled again in the Yoke of bondage judgment begins at the house of God not just this house but this house this is where the judgment is beginning this is where the the the battle is being won between God and Satan see you were born in Satan's Eden you were born with the seed of the Serpent's Seed all over you and around you and and and affecting you and pushing all their agender into you through TV and everything we're born in it but judgment begins at the house of God God's coming with avengence Hallelujah he's coming with with fire for those things in your life Hallelujah he's got a Zeal and insatiable desire to see you free to see you walk in the fullness of the freedom that's been preached to you Hallelujah to Feast on these things to strengthen you to place your soul in its position so you can discern every Antichrist Spirit around you to walk into the fullness of what you had because now by default in the great program of God now as we look at it in the age that we're in and we look around us and we see what's happening and we we see this great subject of Jubilee being preached all over the country being preached all around the world being songs being written about it this is the Year of Jubilee there is great Jubilee happening this year Hallelujah this is the year where the bride is walking into a greater measure of what been promised to her amen that's right I believe it amen hallelujah and we're seeing it now and we've seen it over the past few years how things are changing in fellowships and and walls are coming down and fellowship's being restored and those old prickles that were all over people amen the water's coming down upon them and those prickles are opening up and Le of Fellowship Hallelujah and now you can have Fellowship in the call of the evening Hallelujah the shout it's sheltered from that blistering hot sun and you can just have Fellowship hallelujah amen in an atmosphere where the Holy Ghost is welcome hallelujah amen you can sit down with someone and you know know that it's a sincere Feast you're feasting on sincerity you're seeing what they are you're not seeing a front or a mask or a wall because a gospel Jubilee trumpet sounded and they've heard it and it stripped them and the Lord has descended into their life Hallelujah to mortify the Deeds of this flesh so that they can raise up and be sincere and be true to who they really are in front of everyone then the Holy Ghost is pleased there's no dissimulation or hypocrisy in the church church is free of hypocrisy it's free of a pressure to perform a pressure to be something that you're not because because of the atmosphere you are really the one you are really the person because of a jubilee amen you are really the person that you that people see you you don't have to hide anything because you got nothing to hide because what you are is what people see amen the L the spirit of God is pleased with them I believe amen um you can Isaac come or just start singing hallelujah amen I want to read a quote here power without character is satanic I want to balance this Freedom this Liberty that we have says therefore Brethren ye have been called un to Liberty only use not Liberty for an occasion to the flesh but by love serve one another for all the law is fulfilled in one word even in this Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself then brother brandom says this in Hebrews chapter 6 he says now you say well brother Brandon then if I become a Christian I can just do anything I want to absolutely if you're a Christian do anything you want to and I'll guarantee you won't have any desire to do wrong you do anything I've always did just what I wanted to do and if I serve the Lord cuz I'm afraid of him going to hell I'm not serving him right if I live true to my wife because I'm afraid she'll divorce me I'm a very I'm not a very good husband but I wouldn't hurt her for nothing I for I love her that's how it is with Christ when a man is born of the spirit of God not because he shouted spok in tongues or some emotion but in his heart love come in and taken the place of the world I'll tell you he loves him he walks by him every day you don't have to tell him it's wrong to do this or that or the other he knows it's wrong and he walks he's an ordained product of God's Sovereign Grace exactly you know so true so why we walk in this Jubilee free don't feel condemned at yourself if you see something and your flesh starts to react and you think oh man am I still in this is there still a trouble in me it's just the flesh you your soul now knows exactly how to deal with it because you've been hearing a trile trumpet that's right you've been proclaimed Freedom everything that Christ came to restore every heart binding The Binding up the Brokenhearted all the effects of Calvary everything that God has given right from Eden right through is yours amen just raise up and take it and when you fail that's flesh you just rise up one more time amen and continue on Amen walk with God and nurse from the almighty God that very one that has appeared to you on your plans of Mumy Hallelujah that very one that you just nurse from him and one day you'll be young like Abraham and Sarah Hallelujah and that promised son Hallelujah was going to come forth and sit on the thr amen that promised son is already dwelling inside you amen hallelujah just waiting and ready and growing Christ being formed in you Hallelujah ready for your final Jubilee where one day the new Heaven and new earth will come down upon us our new Earth and our new heaven hallelujah amen and we'll put on immortality and then we'll look into another dimension and we'll be there and we'll think and we'll be there Hallelujah and we'll be seeing all the saints of every age hallelujah amen hallelujah we'll be seeing all these ones that have passed on Amen and we'll be having Fellowship beyond anything we've ever dreamed of Hallelujah that is the true Jubilee right now Satan is bound by circumstance amen have you heard your Jubilee hallelujah amen let's stand let's sing that song I have heard my Jubilee amen I walk free Hallelujah you heard a certain trumpet sound amen and that's taking effect in your life that's it's not something that you have done it's something that he is doing amen amen it's not your own effort it's that word that you're hearing with the spirit in it that's touching your soul and and is bringing you into your place you just be affected by that great anointing be affected by the great holy spirit that is setting you free day by day as you mature and can handle that Liberty because you'll have a character to handle that Liberty and you'll have a character to rule and reign with Christ A Thousand Years believe amen let's sing that song hallelujah amen years and years I
