just so just a couple of announcements just as you want to take your Bibles so on the 11th of the weekend of the 11th of March we'll have our AGM so if you have anything you want to raise can you please send it to me or put it in the offering box if you want it to be anonymous just so I can put it into the agenda so that's on the 11th of March and also I've booked the forest lakes camp for the 13th of April to the 15th of April so I'll resend through all the prices and everything so we're going to have a wonderful time together as a as a church family so I mean that's the first week into the school holidays too I mean so if you got your Bibles handy let's just go to Luke chapter 4 I think I've got something here here we go oh okay Luke chapter 4 verses 16 and we're gonna read down to verse 21 and then we're gonna go to Hebrews chapter 11 now I want to continue with my thought of recognizing the day an hour in which you live and I pray that that a faith will be built this morning Luke 4:16 to 21 it says and he came to Nazareth where he had been bought up and as his custom was he went into the synagogue on the Sabbath day and stood up for to read and there was delivered unto him the book of the prophet Isaiah and when he had when he had opened the book he found the place where it was written the Spirit Lord is upon me because he has anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor he has sent me to heal the brokenhearted to preach deliverance to the captives and they were covering of the sites of the blind and sit at liberty them that are bruised to preach the acceptable year of the Lord and he closed the book and he gave it again to the minister and sat down and the eyes of all them that were in the synagogue were fastened on him and he began to say unto them this day this scripture is fulfilled in your ears Allu you and let's go to hebrews hebrews chapter 11 hebrews 11:8 in verses eight to 11 now by faith Abraham when he was called to go out her into a place which he should after receive an inheritance obeyed and he went out not knowing whether he went by faith he sojourned in a strange in the land of promise as in a strange country dwelling and the Tabernacles of Isaac and Jacob the heirs with him of the same promise for he looked for a city which hath foundations whose builder and maker is God now this is the scripture I want to you through faith also Sara herself received strength to conceive seed and was delivered of a child when she was past age because she judged him faithful who had promised I mean my Lord blesses word you may have your seats I'd like to welcome sister know me as well god bless you just he feel at home good to have you here amen and so one who I want to take a I want to take a thought from especially Genesis chapter 18 but we have we read here in Luke chapter 4 where the Lord Himself stood and he took the scripture and he read he read the scripture pertaining to his day an hour in his ministry and he said this day the scripture is fulfilled now don't no doubt there were many many rabbis probably may have would have read the scripture and they would have everyone else who could have read the read the Bible they would have been reading it but when it comes when someone would stand and would take that scripture and find it in the he says he found it in the scroll and he read it and he was declaring this day this scripture is fulfilled in your ears it was a different kind of service and they weren't rejoicing they got angry they got you you continue to read the story and they wanted to take him out the city and throw him down a hill they wanted to destroy him and he was a very messiah the very word became flesh and he began to say this day this scripture is fulfilled in your ears now we read there in Hebrews chapter 11 because we from from the journey with Abraham now he would abraham would journey for 25 years with god he believes the promise of God but Sarah herself had to be had to believe it as well and so near the end of the journey she had to have a visitation of God herself to turn her heart from unbelief to faith that even though she was part of the promise she had to recognize herself by the promise it was no good just Abraham telling her we're going to have the promised son he's going to be called Isaac he's going to be out here God told us we're going to have the son it was no good just for Abraham to tell her goddess God Himself had to come and turn her heart from doubt unbelief to faith hallelujah and the church has been journeying for 2,000 years amen and finally there's come a visitation of God where her heart has turned from from doubt can it really happen can we really go on a rapture is these all things must be and God has turned the heart amen of the bride from doubting the promise to judging him faithful who has promised hallelujah and that's just not the bright around the world that has to come to you where God would visit you in a supernatural way where it turns your heart from unbelief in the word and doubt is that really that important doesn't really matter is it really going to be so and he turns your heart from that to faith in his word that you judge him faithful the God who gave the word they gave the scripture they gave the message will perform what he says he will do oh uh this is from the state of scriptures fulfilled now you want to go listen to a service you want to go listen to this one because you must understand we know when a prophet comes upon the scene and he preaches a sermon or you know he's not just thinking of something to tickle the people's is he's not just giving you're paying heed to itching ears I pray it's exactly the same thing here but he's declaring something he's because God wants us to see the day now in which we live now he sees here notice the Messiah so this day the scripture is fulfilled the Prophet opens worth the scripture we just read in the Book of Luke and he says notice the Messiah standing in the platform to identify himself with the word of promise for that age how strange the Messiah standing up before the church and look at those and look at these precious words when you hear him say here to preach the acceptable year even goes because it's talking about the year of Jubilee he talks about the Messiah standing in the platform to identify himself with the word of promise for that age now I really want this to anchor in real deep because we understand that he is he is the anointing he is the he is the Spirit of God the must that that word that spirit that led Israel out of Egypt into the Promised Land that burning you know that pillar of fire became flesh and so that same one that spoke to Moses and spoke to Abraham and spoke to David and Solomon all the prophets he became flesh and he was there to identify himself with the promise word of that age and so he is the same yesterday today and forever so if he is standing here if he was standing 2,000 years ago in flesh declaring himself I'm going to identify myself with this scripture and I'm going to make it come to pass he's the same God he was back then as present now so I could just say he's standing in the platform amen to identify himself with the promise word of the age hallelujah that's what he's doing because you can't just put that back because brother BAM he preaches this day the scripture is fulfilled and he goes down from from from Moses and he goes down all the way through then he comes into his own ministry and he begins to speak about God coming down on the Ohio River when he's baptizing the 17th person pillar of fire comes down a voice speaks out as john the baptist was sent to forerun the first coming your message will forerun the second coming and he says this day this scripture is fulfilled in your ears hallelujah and and brother Danny Stephens grandma was in that service and she said they're such a powerful anointing in that place that he could have said all in one role down the old everyone would have there's such a powerful atmosphere and you can hear it you could that was his words that was her was this what she said about there's such a powerful atmosphere because God was standing there saying this day this scripture this visitation has been fulfilled and let's not be dull of hearing about it let's not just put it off 60 years ago because God is calling a people and we have to be changed to fit the pattern of the word I mean if God is called a word bride a manifestation of the scripture every part of it if he is called her to become us where does a lord change me to fit that pattern we must be you say God changed my heart that I've met your word because he's not going to change we can't we can't actually hold him to ransom and say God you got to check you got to change your ways people trying to hold God to ransom he's not a hostage we become the hostage we become the love prisoner hallelujah has not out of a resentment it's a yes Lord I'm so privileged friends Billy Graham passed away I'm sure you all know her brother Brahim says a lot about Billy Graham and he speaks about let's just go to Genesis 18 because I want to you know when when a when a prophet stands and he and he says and he goes back into the scripture and he says this is happening he's not clutching at straws to find some nice story that somehow fits he's God is showing you see what's happening here this is repeating again here and the conditions that were there here and he does that that you'll understand where you are because Abraham was called and he journeyed from a strange land to a land of promise and the last visitation that they had and it turned Sarah's heart from doubt on the promise to faith in the promise was God coming down to angels came down with them in flesh and and God himself discerned knew what Sarah was thinking in her heart and he were going to say why did she laughs because I've told you according to time of life you're going to have the promised son and if you read the chapter before that God comes down and speaks to Abraham said it he said well that's just fine then I was really Easter so striking you know let's not be I believe with all my heart God makes the promise what is going to happen very real to his children and we must never just let that become common where God would take a word and it would more than just be excitement maybe of a meeting or someone else's enthusiasm but he comes and speaks to you personally and he tells you this is what's going to happen you are going to go in a rapture I'm going to change your body amen I trustees actually said that the it's not just excitement it's not just well I see the world falling apart so I have to go somewhere but something's anchored in your soul there's a body there's an eternal word body reserved for me in the heavens and I'm going to change from this this boy's gonna be changed to meet that body hallelujah so now so we read I don't have this on here sorry but we go to Genesis 17 and we'll read verse 20 and 21 it was just before the visitation and as for Ishmael I have heard thee behold I have blessed him and will make him a fruitful and will multiply him exceedingly twelve Prince's shall he beget and I'll make him a great nation but my covenant will I establish with Isaac which Sarah shall bear unto thee at the set time in the next year you see why Abraham was under expectation because God had just told them you're gonna she's going to have the son and though the promise is tarried now it's going to happen don't be weary in well-doing there's going to be a meeting in the air and God you say God mold and changed my life my heart that I met that I fit the criteria to meet you in the air amen we have to God has to get a hold of us amen I don't want to I don't want to just have a church and we find ourselves in a tribulation you know because some people will end up in the tribulation I don't want to be in that category and I don't want to stand there before God and him ask why did you not tell them I don't want blood on my hands so now Isaac is here I mean Abraham so he's been told this is what's going to happen and in the Lord Himself now Genesis 18 were on the on the screen now and the Lord appeared unto him in the plains of memory and he sat in the tent door on the heat of the day and he lifted up his eyes and looked and behold three of them three men stood by him and when he saw them he ran to meet them from the tent door and bowed himself towards the ground said my lord if now I have found favor in thy sight pass not away I pray thee from thy servant and they said unto Him where is Sarah thy wife so I were just dropping down a few verses and and they said on them where is Sarah thy wife I said behold in the tent and he said I will certainly return unto the according to the time of life and lo Sarah thy wife shall bear thee a son and Sarah heard it in the tent which was behind him and this is verse 11 of Abraham and Sarah were old and well stricken an age and it ceased to be with Sarah after the manner of woman because there were nearly a hundred wherefore Sarah laugh to earn herself saying after I a waxed old shall I have pleasure with my lord being old also and the Lord said unto Abraham wherefore did Sarah laugh saying shall I surely bear a child which I'm old is anything too hard for the Lord underline that if you underline Scripture in your Bible there's anything too hard in the Lord at the time appointed armed at the time pointed I'll return unto the according to the time of life and Sarah shall have a son in Sarah denied saying I laughed not for she was afraid and he said nay thou did us laugh that's how he's gonna read a bit more and the main rose up from thence and look towards and Abraham went with them to bring them on the way and the Lord said shall I hide from Abraham the thing which I shall do seeing that Abraham shall be surely become a great and mighty nation and all the nations of the earth shall be blessed in him now you say well this is this day these scriptures are being fulfilled the story we just read is more than a story its prophecy its prophecy of an endtime people where God has to come because remember here we are here we're at the end time Abraham journeyed with lot they came a time where they had to separate cuz lot was nominal he wasn't even called Abraham was called but because he went with Abraham he received father blessing the neighbor that became upon Abraham he became very rich as well but then he but then there had to come a separation and he pitched his teeth towards Sodom and he found himself stuck in Sodom you know you're after a while and he was trapped in that place and the Bible says that the life that the sodomites loved grieved and Victor's righteous soul and so here we are now in this world where we can all agree we are living in Sodom and Gomorrah again he said well it's been like this way for years don't need to become common to you these things must need to be whether we like it or not and you see the spirit there and in in Genesis there how there were men and they were trying to because the two angels we'd down to Lots house and and not receive them into the house and the men of the city tried to force their way in into his house to grab those angels and have their way with them it was aggressive aggressive spirit it's still aggressive today it's still aggressive today so we are living in Sodom and Gomorrha conditions again the world has become that way whether we like it or not this is just how it is because the prophecy is being lived out again so now there's lot and his family down in Sodom Abraham's on the plains of Mamre Abraham's waiting for a visitation that they will receive the promised son and there's and there's two and and lot is down in Sodom he changed Sodom he's fixed by it but he can't change the world he's living in and there's two classes of Christians today there's a group that's down and stuck in the world nominal they want to fix the world they want to make it Christian again they would have a big Christian sweep across the world and and convert the world but they can't but they're ineffective and what they're doing amen they are you go look at the church world unfortunately it's just more people gathering there's no real birth there's no change they they come in the door they may give a profession but then they walk out the same way nothing against them they're sincere people but that's the condition they're in and the world vixx's them because they want to fix it what's the big had a Trump get into the White House let's make America great again the MBA evangelicals they tell the churches you got to vote for him and it swung the election his way the evangelical vote because they were looking they're looking for a champion to try and make the nation Christian again and they found it in Donald Trump some of you look at me like really yes really because they're looking for a champion we have a champion he is the Lord Jesus Christ but because they are nominal thinking they're looking how can we get a natural man to help us make a Christian again because they're nominally thinking they're not spiritually minded unfortunately and so they're trying to make the nation Christian again let's go back to our founding fathers water once was but they can't take it back there and they won't be able to take it back there because they are fulfilling what light is doing and it's the same thing in you see on all the Western world we want to make it Christian together and they're in there vexed by how the world is but they can't do anything about it so there's a group and then there's another group and we'll come back to their group later that's waiting for the change in the body because because we're waiting for the promised son are we not we're waiting to meet him in the air so there's a group that's not and not in Sodom and we may live in this world but we're not of this world jesus prayed that he that we wouldn't be taken out of the world but would be kept in this present world hello yeah did he not he pray thee said father I don't ask that you take them from the world but I pray you'd keep them in this world amen so some of us I pray you can all say I'm one of them I am living out Jesus's prayer for me hallelujah he prayed and I'm the answer to his prayer hallelujah Amen I true I say no one cares about me Jesus prayed for you in the days of his flesh he thought of you and he was praying amen he say Lord answer that prayer and continue to answer that prayer so now here we have lot as stuck in Sodom Abraham is out on the plains of Mamre waiting for the promised son but Sarah's heart is going to be turned to faith because she's been doubting the promise and then God Himself comes comes down and flesh discerns her heart and turns her heart from from doubting the promise to faith amen but the same time now there's two angels with God and flesh and they go down into Sodom and their job is to call out lot because lot because because they God knows that's why we read there there was last part of our reading shall we withhold from Abraham what we're going to do and God and he says when the Spirit of Truth has come he will lead you and guide you into all truth he will show you things as must shortly come to pass amen so the areas he's saying sure we withhold from what what I'm going to do is he know so of it and then the next chapter he begins to tell about how God God tells Abraham after the two angels have already begun to walk down and to Sodom they've already left he says we're gonna burn this place this Gentile world is gonna burn with fire and then Abraham begins to under seed surely this should be more what if you find 15 he goes down to about 10 and I believe he went down a bit more he would have spared the place but so here is a group they're waiting for the promised son then two angels go down into into Sodom now I read this in the beginning let's go back here this quote here Masaya standing to identify himself with the promised word of the age it's because we understand that's an anointing they meant that's an anointing so Abraham now so brother Branham identifies himself and he identifies the anointing on the two angels are we all familiar with this he takes this story and he brings it down into now and he says do it he sees the two angels that went down and to Sodom and he doesn't just speak he doesn't just speak now of Billy Graham and all Roberts just as the two people but there's anointing upon them they were the two that spearheaded that move to go down get the church nominal but you'll see what they did as you see here what was the message there were three angels went down two of them a Billy Graham and a Jack Schuler went down into Sodom and preached just the message of gospel deliverance to the people but what angel stayed behind with the elected Abraham and his group and the angel had us back to into the tent and Sarah laughed inside the tent angel said why did Sarah laugh how did he know she laughed in the team behind him that was the last message that Sodom had before the destruction and here's the last signs that God would show before the annihilation receive it believe it be saved let's bow our heads just a moment are you aware of his presence I think it's a very important question you say but the asides of miracles still done yes but there's a major sign where God would come down and flesh and discern what is going on in the hearts of the people and he's saying he's saying now this ministry this ministry has repeated and and that was his ministry that he had they meant that was his ministry he had but then when he spoke about Billy Graham and he speaks of all Roberts he sees about Jack Shula and and a group of them he sees it I remember two preachers of modern Billy Graham and and Oh somebody else you'd say that any great evangelist or Robertson or some of them went down to Sodom and preached they were great preachers but did they do siting down there a miracle but not a sign what went down into Sodom and they preached a warning message that they'd better get out for God's coming to destroy it and who's doing any better job on it today than Billy Graham and that bunch I respect Billy Graham a great man of God he's got a great ministry I can see some of them say well don't well he don't believe in divine healing IBC's he says that's fine he's doing his job but but what brother Bram is saying is it's an anointing just like brother Bram wasn't wasn't God became flesh speaking to Abraham the anointing that was on God came upon him hey you're following me he wasn't the Lord that came on the plains of Mamre brother Branham wasn't him that was God made a body stepped in it and he went down visited as his children it's the same thing today brother baron wasn't God amen that he wasn't God in a flesh body like Jesus was he was a sinner saved by grace or thing to be a word prophet to the aged and God used him to reveal himself right so it's anointing it's an anointing amen it's the same thing like the anointing of Billy Graham and all Roberts and he says Jack Schuler and a bunch of them they were sent down to the earth but you read the Ministry of those two angels when they go down to lot all they did was blind the people and the people couldn't find the door you go read it in Genesis do we all know our Bible stories should we have Sunday school for a little bit they went down all they did was blind the people that they couldn't find the door and they were stacked there in the destruction that was their ministry now I know there's not a great big hallelujah praise the Lord but that's what but their mission was to get the church nominal out before the destruction that was their job and so now the anointing that was on Billy Graham and Oral Roberts and different ones that anointing is still here just like the anointing that was on the Prophet that didn't leave when the Prophet went home but I read that quote the Messiah is standing in the platform to identify himself with the promise word because they're not historians I'm not just but display bomb talk about where any churches with his believers you understand what I'm saying because they're still in anointing is an anointing here to turn our hearts from doubt in the promise to faith in the promise hallelujah the Ministry of Malachi for was to turn our hearts from the children back to the faith of the fathers I mean that our our hearts would return that we would believe the same thing the Epis taluk fathers believed there was his ministry and that anointing of Malachi 4 is still here in his word I mean that's why that's why we listen to the missus why we study that's why we pray you know because there's an anointing in that word they're still here and that and that anointing must be in a living vessel it's not enough just to be in in the forerunner but that same anointing that was on the prophet has to be coming to the bride I mean just like Elijah and Elijah hallelujah Elijah continue - Elijah's ministry amen as in there right the same anointing that was on Elijah came upon Elijah I meant and He fulfilled what many things what Elijah said that he would do because it was the same God but working through a different vessel and it's the same thing it's the same thing with the Bride of Christ brother Brahim says that she under her her messenger she under her messenger well how do you get under the messenger you receive his word and you believe his word therefore you place yourself he says she under her messenger becomes the final voice to the final age amen that's not just playing tapes they become a living voice to the aged and you got to say that's talking about me I become you're going to become a living witness of this word hallelujah where it's the same God comes and lives in you amen that's what we're called to me and living witness I mean it's not you doing it it's God doing it hallelujah he said well I'm not called to preach you may not be called to preach you may not be able to sing or play anything but your life should be a living witness I mean that my god reigns my redeemer lives hallelujah everyday we're preaching your life is speaking I mean that's the thunder that shakes the devil is a life consecrated to God brother says we need in Jeffersonville I'll say we need in Wellington wherever we're from thousands of lives voices this is the thunder that shakes the devil I lived voice hallelujah so that's what we need to be I mean so now they go on to Sodom they gone to Sodom they fulfill their ministry and then right after that it says then God goes down into Sodom and you don't hear anything about it he just he just scenes the fire now their ministry is done their ministry is done they meant sure they're still salvation but the truth at spier he did that revival of calling lot out is done do you know where we are that's done God Himself is here but I've seen many times the main thing God is interested in is his bride you are you are what he is interested in he's not worried about everything else he's been waiting for you to come to the earth he thought of you in his mind before the foundation of the world and he didn't see you as a poor decrepit sinner lost and undone and unbelief he didn't think of you in that way he was thinking of standing mane and his image I mean everything he is she is a man that's what he thought of you as victorious the serpent under her feet I meant her own personality and humanity under subject to the Word of God you're the greatest miracle Jesus did he goes to the garden you know what the greatest miracle he was he went to the garden he had to go to Calvary as a man and the Spirit of God left him you know what the greatest miracle he was he subjected his flesh to the word that was allotted to him that was a miracle you say well what about casting out Legion and doing all those things no the greatest miracles he subjected this he subjected this not my will but thy will be done and that's how he got the victory it's got to be the same thing with us it's wind it's not Oh God comes down and we shout and we rejoice no it's going to be a point we don't feel anything we say not my will your would be done and everything we do say and think they would be done God is looking for a people that are his word he's not looking for anything else we don't want to be left behind they'll come a time there will come a time when it's done and then let them that a filthy be filthy still let them be righteous be righteous still let them be holy be holy still they will come that time amen depends where you want to be God is a absolute gentleman you won't force nothing on you we don't want to take for granted it's got to be a life expressed doesn't matter how much we shout sing and dance it's a life it's a life of the word in you that's what had to happen with Sarah her heart had to be turned from doubt to faith hallelujah she had to believe the promise that was allotted to her the word do you understand do you understand God has seen her word to you and you say Lord caused me to believe it amen you gotta say Lord caused me to understand it you've spoken to me in my language you've called me your your Spirit has drawn me do you believe it respond to it and say yes Lord you don't have to become perfect and then you live his word he takes you there he makes you thus you are the sculpture and he is the artist amen he takes you like a big piece of marble and he has something in his mind I want to make a big sculpture and he takes his hammer and chisel takes you and he begins to work on you work on you you understand it's like painting a picture your blank canvas you may be covered all in darkness he wipes it off then he gets his paintbrush he begins to paint you early because he has it in his mind this is why you're going to be and this is what he wants you to be amen the Messiah standing present to identify himself with the promised word of the day so now here we are now their main the main Ministry of that is now done Lots being basically called out there's still people there but now there's a promise to a woman who's been part of the promise for 2,000 years and she has doubted the promise but there comes a time when the hardest turned from doubt to faith in his word Amen now I trust you can say I'm a Sarah Amen I wanted to really I don't want I want us to walk out different and I talked about me myself as well I don't want to just come to church and be the same old person and do the same old thing and live the same old kind of life and not get any more victory and no gain any more ground I want to conquer every place it's mine every promise in the Bible is mine I want to see it I don't just want to talk about it there's how I feel I mean this word has been God has taken an open book he's unsealed the promise and he's delivered it to you amen he doesn't want you just to say that's nice and dandy and put it on the Shelf he's given it to you that you had manifested I mean just like Joshua Joshua and Caleb the word the law they received was given to them that they would possess the promised land that was what was given and they said let's go take it hallelujah they didn't just got the promise they said this is my promise I mean they had a visitation hallelujah they saw God come down on Sinai they saw him up in the Red Sea they knew that's the reason we're being called out wasn't just to die in the wilderness imagine them standing there all of other all of us rolls there did you bring us out here to die how many times they complain to Moses did you bring us out here to die we had a better life back in the world I was happier in the world I enjoyed the food better in the world can you that'd be Stanley saying what why are you people complaining why are you complaining God hasn't seen us out here to die of course he hasn't seen us brought us out here to die you understand mentioned may just indeed say Joshua did you hear that they're crazy God's done so much for us he's called us out he's revealed himself he's delivered us we're not under the slave slave yoke anymore of the world we're free we're are free people and they're complaining they want to go back to bondage that's madness that's insanity this world brother Brahim says he says this world is not too far from going totally insane and he says I want to tell you it before it happens this world is insane I don't care who he's this this world has gone mad because this world they say we can fix the world insanity is China is basically fighting you heater against a brick wall and expecting a different result that is basically insanity oh it's going to be it's going to it's going to be a bit different this time now it's really going to work let's go I'll do it this way this is what the world is done and it's the same brick wall and it's the same head and it doesn't do any good or we can eradicate disease but it's greed so it doesn't work we can take away the famine but is greed doesn't work we can have world peace for this national Spurs controlling different nations doesn't work we'll ever UN doesn't work we'll have an other group doesn't work that's insanity we have the best technology amen to date here you know have you seen has anyone seen the video of of their big massive rocket that the guy who does the electric cars biggest biggest cargo spaceship billions of dollars goes up in the booster rockets come down and they and they and they actually come back to earth and they just land like this malt and and to just just to get a lot of biggest cargo rocket ever to go up into space it's impressive but look how broken the world is a man can land a rocket like this and reuse it but the world is more broken than it's ever been it's heading for a nuclear nuclear war that's insanity of all man can do and nothing against those things this world is broken because they try to do the same old thing and people are so blind they will you know we come to church Wednesday Sunday in a total about maybe five or six hours a week and people will sit in front of a screen for six hours a day and they're being preached to they are actually those those movies they watch you know the songs and they and it's not just here not just video audio that's every moment of every day and they're listening to music and they're watching and they're actually being preached to a message is being told to them and they begin to become what they hear they're far more devout than a lot of us because we don't have church 24/7 like they do and they're becoming and it's the same thing and as blindness coming in it's a blindness and it's the same thing in the religious world it's a blindness why is that because the anointing that was on those two angels they're still here and it just blinds the people they can't find the door doesn't matter what they do but in this age we're called to go receive ICF that we would see without manual price here's the isafe hallelujah this word give I pray this word has opened eyes this message is become a living reality we see everything the proper was talking about has become manifested in the cell he's actually telling you this is where you are before the burning of Sodom there was a visitation of God to a people waiting a promise yes this is your last song the Messiah is standing on the platform now you say well this is all rather elitism and so on no it's not this is God's promise for the Aged just be happy if you're and be happy and then have a burden for those who are out amen now she's got varicose veins this is whereas where is he born King of the Jews have you ever thought about was he asked these questions because he's actually saying here he is now that God the one you listen to on tape he hasn't left he's present are we aware of his presence or do we just sit there and just let the devil take our thought pattern off someplace you know is everyone here today you say well I'm here but I embody I'm here but in spirit I'm I'm somewhere else don't let the devil do that to you take you down something garden path and then I'm about to close and now you're here amen glory I'm so happy that's over where are you friends don't let this world pass us by don't leave this pass you by the woman who had the blood issue she had one chance but God is Grace he was the fullness of grace and truth and he was walking he was on his way to Calvary blind bartimaeus the same way that was there on the opportunity there recorded in the scripture because they called out well they see if I can just touch the hem of His garment I'll be made whole they pressed it and got what they needed amen and it's got to be the same this world is lukewarm did he say well of course it is but don't let that lukewarmness affect your spiritual walk amen don't let it bother you in that way we have to live in this world but don't let it overtake you and syrahs she's got verrico so we'll go back and see her inside not out loud but the Bible said within herself said me being an old woman have a hundred years old and and having pleasure with my Lord Abraham she loved him now you women ought to love your husband's like that because the Bible said so that's right so much he called him Lord but then he lived a life to actually merit that that little word Lord now and when they she did that see if you love your husband's like that and you'll honor and love your wife the divorce courts will go out of business that's the way it should be for what God has joined together let no man put asunder she's got varicose veins now now he's calling out someone she's a mother of a big bunch of children doesn't she that's exactly right your name is mrs. Ellis Thompson that's exactly right returned receive what you've asked for so shall she be healed because you have believed on the Lord Jesus now if we're strangers to me to me another wave your hand back and forth like this I don't know you know nothing about you I challenge your faith I believe it he a challenge any person in here in the name of Jesus Christ to believe in as presence is here I don't care what's wrong with you if you'll believe it remember this is the last thing that he'll do before his coming you remember what he said as it was in the days of Sodom and Gomorrah so shall have been the coming of the Son of man and then many places he sees now I'll turn my back Sarah was in the tent was in the tent behind him he says now I'll turn my back to the person and he begins to say exactly what's wrong what's wrong with the person and what's their name and their address and everything why did he do that he wasn't doing it as a show he said I've heard these things for years I pray means a little bit more to you today and then he says now I'll turn my back he's not doing as a show but he's doing it that he's saying what you read about in Genesis 18 is being lived out here and the reason that their ministry was now being repeated again as there's a people upon the earth that are being called out they're not stuck in a religious Sodom and Gomorrah blinded they can't find the door but they've been called out amen and God is visiting us that our hearts will be turned from doubt to faith hallelujah you may be sitting here doubting the promise of God can it really happen can it really be me I pray God turn your heart to faith you are fully persuaded that he is able to perform that which he has promised you olya doesn't matter about someone else what about you amen you got to see it as that hallelujah Sarah's heart was turned Sarah's heart was stirred from doubt to faith and then she believed then now she believed it and then they received the promised son and this is where the churches today we have come to believe the promise of God have we not I mean we know I pray I no longer doubt the promise hallelujah I fully are persuaded this is his word that he is send in the same time amen and we are not here we are not here friends stuck in a religious Sodom he said well that's judgmental to them no these two groups lot still receive salvation hey with me Lord still receive salvation they'll have their place but what about your place what about you this message is a bride call the and what does that mean it's a call to gather a people to unite them with Jesus Christ the bridegroom hallelujah and he can't lose his wife amen he can't lose a part of himself I will just read this in him that will close this day the scripture Matthew 24 is fulfilled the world is in a corruption the whole thing nation against nation earthquakes in diverse places we are diverse places great world ones coming down and shaking the nations and so forth great disasters everywhere this day the Scriptures fulfilled just I just pause for a second has anyone seen the video on the Alaskan earthquake the Good Friday Alaskan earthquake have you seen go see the video on it you know do you know why that happened a prophet God has to do something upon the earth he is a prophet to start things just like Moses you know throw dust on the air or raise up your staff and let frogs or flies or worry will come so brother brems there and and God says pick up a he picks it up and a whirlwind comes down and it blasts out the canyon wall everything Sabino Canyon and it cuts out all these triangle-shaped rocks have you has anyone seen any of those they are actually pyramid shaped and there's and it's and it's - two kinds of rockets like a brown and they're like a dark grey rock on the inside pyramidal shape and then and then that will one goes off and then the people are going who are hunting with him saying what's going on he sees his judgment striking the west coast and shortly after that there was the Good Friday earthquake in Alaska and he said that'll start that started and it will continue on the great until they know the world has ended we've gone into a judgement cycle do you understand this world is already in a judgement cycle a pre-tribulation judgment just doesn't it's like the days of Noah God tells Noah build the ark I'm going to flood the earth what's happening the world is going into a judgement cycle one hundred twenty years but there's mercy there's a way of escape for a hundred and twenty years before the judgment finally falls hallelujah but it the world had gone into a judgement cycle and so here we are this world is in a judgement cycle I mean the tribulation is coming and that is according to the Word of God it is coming but before it sits in just like Sodom was going to burn but before it burned God was dealing with Abraham God sent angels to pull that out before the destruction and it's the same thing today this world is going to burn no one can stop it someone will push a button and it doesn't matter who boasts I've got a bigger nuclear button than you it doesn't matter it's gonna it's going to go and it's not just going to be a will push and we'll fire one and see what happens no nuclear war is different you've got to annihilate your enemy before it annihilate you that's why you can't just have a skirmish here and a skirmish here and a battlefront here it's nothing to do with tanks jets and bombers it's missiles and they have to completely wipe out their enemy you think of America and Russia and China they have a big dust-up with their nuclear weapons it's not just gonna be our fire one and see what happens if they'll surrender they take out all their cities all their silos all their nuclear subs anything that can hit them back they've got to wipe it out and one go that's different we've never had that kind of thing going on it's going to happen but before the first bomb drops the bride is gone amen that's what that's what the prophecies and I happen to believe it now but you see the world has gone to a judgement cycle you know how there's the cloud that appeared on sunset mountain supreme judge Jesus Christ was there now that's just not now he's come to judge the earth he's also come to judge is bright and there's not in a negative way but a judge just doesn't condemn me pardons amen he doesn't just condemn he pardons so there's some there's some where there's some in the courtroom where the judge becomes the attorney and the case is settled hallelujah I mean there's some on the corner of endless is the courtroom so depends has your judge become you're returning as the Word of God become your attorney or is it just your judge it depends your attitude your brother oversees a statement I wish I had it up here your attitude towards the word determines your eternal destination your attitude towards the word determines your eternal destination your attitude do you love him do you love his word and say Lord whatever your wood says I'll do it because I love you or is it no I don't care about it it doesn't matter to me anymore I'll do what I want what's your attitude there's only two places your attitude you say yes Lord or null do it some other time there are people around the ark I may see it I'll do it some other time and God close the door no it didn't close the door do you think anyone wants mercy to be over we want to say come quickly a little bit at the same time like well there's a lot of people out here and they're just like us so no yeah so uh no wouldn't have closed the door himself I don't believe if he could have that God closed the door it's done but your judge your attitude towards the Word of God will determine your eternal destination and so now he has come the supreme judge to judge the world but also to pardon his bride that she never did it in the first place so we're at a judgment cycle but there's mercy even in judgment they meant like we have some musicians I think we're just in there this day the Scriptures fulfilled maybe a bit heavy when you think about it serous heart was stirred from death to faith by visitation of God and I pray that's why God would visit us here is that our hearts will be turned to faith not in doubt but to faith in the promise amen they sing that song in its manifesting time because the fruits are on the vine I see it about being in a judgement cycle we could understand we live in a time who of us are about 80 years old no one no 80 literally literally 80 years old yeah so they would know what it's like from when the world was actually in relatively one piece to what it is now they would know because they live in that era now they live in this era none of us live back in that era amen none of us did we are living at a time when the world has already fallen apart so we would look at and say what do you mean we've got society we've got culture we've got technology and you're saying the world was falling apart look at what we have but we never look back there when it was easy to get health care and I mean different it was a lot easy to get things there things were more affordable back then you know well as your granddad what a post a postman and his first job ash burden and they bought a house this is a postman but now there's inflation and different things and you know you could a postman nowadays just just a guy with a bike he can even just go buy a house newly married oh you're a postman I'll go yeah Oh walking afford to buy a house
