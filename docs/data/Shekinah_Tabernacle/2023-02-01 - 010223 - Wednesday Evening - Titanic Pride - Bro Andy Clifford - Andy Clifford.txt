his blood amen hallelujah and it's but it's not an easy thing Alleluia it's very nervous nerve-wracking actually so you just pray and you you pull and have faith and God will speak to you amen hallelujah thank you musicians they knew Hallelujah who's ready to hear from God tonight amen okay can you turn that on please is it going oh good so tonight we're going to speak on a subject called Titanic Pride and oh my goodness I'll tell you what it's been a journey a real journey actually I'm so moved by this that it's changed my life just just just looking at this whole story and I'll tell you what it's this is a biblical story it's just not written in the Bible but yeah oh my goodness if there was another Bible being written this will be in it this is like a story of of God's judgment on Pride and human beings got too proud and this is what happens but don't just put it off in the history because we can be that Titanic too yeah and it can happen in our lives even as Believers message Believers that's when no one's exempt from this hallelujah amen so Titanic Pride shall near prevail Hallelujah let's turn in our Bibles to Genesis 11 1-5 amen and yeah I'm just moved who's moved by the guard amen I just want you to be movable tonight you know movable in in an encouragement way movable to co-hire not movable to get Go off into the world or into something else but movable by God to take you higher who's ready to go higher amen and the whole earth was of one language and of one speech and it came to pass as they journeyed from the East that they found a plane in the land of China and they dwelt there and they said one to another go to let us make brick and burn them thoroughly and they had breakfast Stone and slam their head for Mortar now this is here it says here in verse 4 and they said go to let us build us see there's a very selfish thing going on here Amen Let Us build us a city and a tower whose top May reach unto heaven let us make us a name that's a very this is a very significant thing now this when this happens this God puts a stop to it but there is a time in which we're in now where God's not going to put a stop to it's going to go worse and worse and worse until Satan's in the flesh but we won't go there but that's what that's what was about to happen here and God stopped it and he stopped it many times over the ages so it says here lest we be scattered aboard upon the face of the earth and the Lord came down to see the city and the tower which the Lord which the children of men build it amen you may be seated God can add the blessing to the reading of his word amen hallelujah I'll just read here now I just mentioned that and it was just something that struck me so deeply but it's not it's just a thought that's going to complement the main thought which is the fact that at the Tower of Babel Lucifer begin to rise inside the human race he began to manifest in their thoughts in their imaginations again you know God cut it down at the flood he when when the flood happened because Lucifer began to build himself up in the human race he began to manifest himself in Babylonian religions and and imaginations of evil and all these things and so it got cut down because it wasn't time for the fullness of iniquity does anyone know what the fullness of iniquity is the fullness of iniquity is When sin can't get any worse it has its cap on it and it cannot get worse so every time the fullness of iniquity comes what that comes through is pride that's the pride of humanity and it's Lucifer's pride and when Lucifer's pride gets into the people the people begin to trust in themselves that's why it's so dangerous when you trust in yourself amen it's so dangerous and every time it happens on a we're talking now we're reading things that happening on an age level or on a dispensational level but here and in this one I'm about to read is happening on a national level and he's speaking to a King but he's actually speaking to Lucifer and he's telling Lucifer that this is what's going to happen but actually you'll see this there's a there's a very interesting parallel here with the Titanic story as well and actually let me just say it now that the Titanic the time of the Titanic after in the in the peak of the Industrial Revolution mankind got to the same point they were at at the Tower of Babel that Lucifer begin to manifest himself in human beings and and God was not ready to let the cut of iniquity fill up until the point of no return but at the day we're living in now that cat is going to fill to the top and it's going to go Lucifer will become flesh and he will manifest himself on the earth it's already in motion it's already near it's it's right there right there that's so bad and yet let's not get acclimatized to it Yeah the more you watch of it the more you partake of it the more you will get acclimatized to it and it will become not so abrasive to you it'll become not so hard for you to look at and then you become it becomes easy for you to to bear with it but let that not become your portion amen so I just wanted to bring that thought there because it was going to very much tie into the thought later on so Ezekiel 28 verse 2 it says son of man say unto the prince of Tyrus thus saith the Lord God because thine heart is lifted up and thou has said I am a god I sit in the seat of God in the midst of the Seas and sees in the Bible as kindreds Nations and tongues so here you have now the spirit that's coming to manifest itself in Kindred tongues and Nations and peoples and masses of people it's the spirit of Lucifer and it comes through pride and it's Pride that the devil uses to take people from God because they rely on themselves and what's in men a luciferian nature without the Holy Ghost without the new birth you have a luciferian nature and all that can happen is Lucifer will manifest himself in you or you'll be a legalistic Pharisee it's the only two options so you need the Holy Ghost and the only thing that's going to stop you getting the Holy Ghost is pride because you're not willing to let God heal that gash in your ship all right we're going to get to that soon hallelujah amen son of man oh we were in the midst of the sea so get thou art a man and not God though thou set thine heart as the heart of God now we're moving down to verse four it says therefore thus saith the Lord God because thou has set thine heart as the heart of God behold therefore I will bring strangers upon thee the terrible of the Nations and they shall draw their swords against the beauty of thy wisdom and they shall defile thy brightness they shall bring thee down to the pit and thou shalt die the deaths of them that are slain in the midst of the Seas amen I won't um comment on that any further but here I'd just like to know that you are I'd like to tell you right now and this is that I believe that scripture speaking of our age and I believe it speaking of today Hallelujah and it's a promise over you I like this sort of Promise who likes these promises over them it's just over you it's in you it's through you it's for you all you need to do is humble yourself and it will affect you God's compassionate against you for you compassion is when you're acting upon empathy it's not just sympathy that sympathizes in the mind about how bad it is that you got it or empathy that really it actually enters into the burden but compassion is the action upon the burden that's when you really act and God is compassionate towards you but he can't act if you're proud and I'm talking to all of us we're all in it none of us are exempt none of us if we are then we're on the wrong we're we're right where we shouldn't be we should be actually going Lord help me right now amen hallelujah pride is the only thing that can really stop you you know and stop you from growing stop me from taking your position stop God from healing you because he wants to bind up the breach of his people and heal the stroke of their wound and I want to carry this thought right through this whole sermon right now though we're going to go for a little bit of a history lesson because I was so moved by this I'll just say a couple of read a couple of quotes here just to build a foundation on what brother Branham has actually said about these things he says and if you'll get behind it it's the same motive that was at the Tower of Babel to build a man-made Earthly Dominion but God don't want that this is about the Tower of Babel button watch this now the Tara Babel is still here the unbelieving world walks along and grows Darkness around some Tower of Babel now we know the Tower of Babel not only stands for the pride of man and the Lucifer raising up to basically try and override judgment but it also stands for all the religions of the world and all denominationalism all Catholicism is rooted in the Tower of Babel all Eastern mythology all taoism or Buddhism all of that new age rubbish is all rooted in this Tower of Babel and that's why when it came to a certain point God had to to confuse their languages to stifle the connection right there because it wasn't time for the iniquity cup to be full it wasn't time for Lucifer to be made flesh amen Hallelujah are you with me amen brother Branham says here so they was crossing the ocean in the ship on its voyage this is the similarities now between the Tower of Babel and the Titanic and feeling so secure that there was nothing could harm them why did they build the Tower so high it was to avoid the another flood why do you think these people these these false religions build their religion so high to try and avoid judgment but they die in their sins and they go to hell there's no hope for them no hope do you believe that absolutely no hope all they'll have is a philosophy and they'll get into some Nirvana State on the earth because of all their their the canceling of the flesh by their own Works in their own mind but they'll go to hell because they're too proud to accept the Simplicity of Christ oh God help us Lord and help them you see it's not it's not a bad people it's just the fact that man is proud and he's trusting in himself but we should not trust in ourselves we should never trust in our own flesh and our own ability in our own intellect and our search like don't get me wrong don't trust in your ability to search the scriptures and compare them all together to try and get Deliverance it has to be a meeting with Christ Hallelujah and finding the source of strength is in him and and God uses people too so when you humble yourself you're able to become a beneficiary of the gifts in the body to be a benefactor but when we get proud we close off or we don't receive that's very much something that we need to look at and and consider our ways Hallelujah um so here look at this on the Titanic it says here they throwed a big drunken party and all the women and the men abroad or maybe many many of them I might say became drunk even they say even the pilot and the captain and all of them and the bands began to whoop up the jazz music which was the great fad of that day as we have rock and roll today and obviously it's further on now because they were safe they were safe right they were in a ship that man had given the world a sign of their intelligence so now we're now venturing into another kind of a revelation within this is the tree of knowledge the tree of knowledge of Good and Evil this intelligence of man knowing everything and and being self-sufficient in science and the Industrial Revolution and it was it was coming to a peak in that day and they were trusting and they were starting to really move away from God and as a society as a as the whole world was moving far that this ship could take any wave or any sea Prophet says this we said that ship cannot be sunk it was called the Titanic we thought we had some we had did something we had achieved something in the marine life that no one could put their hand on that we had did something but on her voyage across the sea god with this powerful hand showed that what man tries to do will sink and fail he sunk it it was a Biblical Judgment of God and I just finished watching uh documentary by James Cameron which was called ghost of the abyss and he goes down and even they testify that it was a Biblical thing and they're not Christian at all but they're all saying this this is just a a story of biblical proportion and there actually I'll show you soon so can we play this video this is going to give us a five minute video I don't do we normally do this can we show a little video it's just it's basically very but it's just a quick overview is this sound oh good the industrial marvels of their age the largest machines on Earth when the owners of White Star Line commissioned the Titanic their Ambitions were every bit as large as their plans for the ship herself she was to be the biggest fastest most luxurious passenger liner ever built construction began at Harland and woof shipyards in the spring of 1909. the city of Belfast watched her groom and took pride in the Feats of engineering required to construct and fed out this giant vessel from her triple propellers to her elegant backswept funnels the Titanic was a sign of her times culture and commerce alike were hurtling forward into the Modern Age after just three years hard work she was finished floating city ready to welcome a whole community on board the passengers on her maiden voyage were drawn from all walks of life among the Gilded State rooms of first class silent film stars rubbed shoulders with millionaires further down in second class the quarters were compact but still comfortable housing School teachers small businessmen and the like and buried out of sight near the bottom of the ship the third class passengers included immigrants from all over Europe in search of a better life in the New World by the 11th of April the Titanic was on her way across the Atlantic hearing reports of ice from other liners playing this busy route Captain Smith plotted a new more southerly course and called for Full Speed Ahead on Sunday the 14th of April Titanic's radio operators received six further reports about icebergs in her path they were busy sending telegraphs on behalf of passengers and the final two warnings never reached the bridge that night the sea was flood calm the sky clear but moonless with temperatures dropping towards freezing in these conditions sea Ice is very hard to spot but at 11 40 PM the lookout sounded the alarm and a telephone call to the bridge [Music] despite efforts to bring the ship around she struck the iceberg less than 40 seconds later opening a long tear and the starboard Hull and sending the sea rushing in first the impact didn't strike the crew as anything too serious but by midnight the forward third class sections of the ship were beginning to flood and Captain Smith realized that the Titanic was in grave danger he ordered the lifeboats uncovered there were 20 lifeboats on board more than the law required but far too few to carry all the ship's passengers no one could imagine that a gigantic liner like the Titanic might sink before another ship came to the rescue and indeed the Titanic's crew could see the lights of another ship that night lying at anchor less than 20 miles away despite increasingly frantic efforts to make contact they got no response to their radio calls or distressed Flash the nearest ship that answered Titanic's SOS was the Carpathia her crew immediately set off to the rescue but she was four hours away even at frantic full speed cause of the shortage of lifeboats Captain Smith ordered women and children to board first the crew managed the evacuation as best they could in the confusion but many boots were launched half full third class passengers had to find their way through a maze of corridors and staircases to reach the boat deck just after 2 am the final Lifeboat was lowered the passengers still on board could see that the game was up Captain Smith relieved his man of their duties with the words every man for himself then returned to the bridge at around 2 20 am he went down with his ship by the time the Carpathia arrived to pick up the survivors more than 1500 people had perished in the freezing water and the ship herself lay on the seabed almost four kilometers below less than a third of the third class passengers made it onto the list of survivors although the women and children first policy proved effective across all classes the Titanic was not the only disaster of its kind or even the deadliest but there is something about the story that still captures our imagination a century litter the way the tragedy slowly unfolds towards an inevitable ending the warnings it seems to offer about the limits of technology and the arrogance of man it's no wonder we have turned this unlucky ship into a legend we have to find ourselves identified with a similar situation in our own lives amen 1500 people went down with that ship because they were so proud and so self-sufficient that they were unable to heed the warning or prepare and not only that as we go further on in the does this work yep as we go further on here's I'm just going to show you a few things because that was all animated you don't really get a connection to the um to the people remember these are people with families and lives and and very influential people in the world it was like the the Donald Trump of that day died on the ship and all these people and it was just a a Epic Proportion tragedy but you can see all these people here all leaving that was when they were leaving port there's the captain and his second first mate I think they're called um and some of the diner was one of the richest most luxurious liners to ever be on the sea that's the crew there there's the lifeboats those people walking along the lifeboats right there it's just the day that was taken the day they sunk there's a boy playing on the on the deck there down on the that was actually on the third class deck so here we are this is the ship sinking and you can see now I might just turn this way I feel like I'm in the way but like that's hard to see but like this these people in all these lifeboats were sitting around watching this massive ship break in front of them and people screaming can you imagine it just a horrific horrific like it's just you cannot you cannot put your imagination there too but if you put yourself in their shoes you'll realize the same if it can give you a little feeling of what it's like for a soul to be lost and for Pride to come into our lives to hinder us from healing from change from Deliverance from from our from an opportunity with God we must humble ourselves the more humble we can be collectively and individually the more God can use us in this in this Fellowship in this region powerful oh my it's not just so that you can have a healing it's so that God can use you hey man oh my God hallelujah so here you have now the ship it got so on it went up and the the weight of it broke it and there was thousands of people on this part 1500 people because you can imagine they were running up the ship to hold on to all this and that went right up and you can see here see where the ship now is actually half under the water there and thousands and thousands of people just sitting there watching this water come up that's what it's like for our lives and when we're watching people that are living in a in a way that yeah I'll get to a point there because it gets worse as soon as the water hits gets higher the higher it gets the faster it sinks you have some more pictures just to give you an idea of the the magnitude of the catastrophe that they faced here's the ship and all these thousands of people just swimming around in one degree water here it is now just about to go down 1500 people on board the ship these guys were the ones 730 of them were rescued and these are the lifeboats them at dawn the next day and the capathia ship they're on the capacia ship here this is the crowds of people there was thousands and thousands of people all the families you know that were waiting for their they didn't even know they didn't know who was dead or not the newspapers were in a frantic they were reporting oh the the Titanic that's okay it's getting towed in and some of them there was just so such a mix but all these people were waiting to know if their family was coming back and these people here they're all waiting outside the office waiting for news these people here are waiting for they had the news now they're waiting for the ship to come and can you imagine now this is the ship today this is down the bottom 3.8 kilometers down that's where the steering wheel was that was the bridge this is the stern or the bow sorry the bowel of the ship right where you know um people would have stood and watched the ship you know a ship as a type of a life that or as someone walking and you're dividing time with your life you know you're walking ahead you're if you're walking with God you're walking in his prophecy you're walking in his word you're dividing time you know it's one part's going that way one's going that way you're walking through it the ship is is like that it's going through its cutting and it's Majestic in its way but when there's Pride there's destruction because remember the Bible says Pride goes before destruction and a haughty spirit before the fall this was the captain's bathtub in his room this is the back of the ship it's hard to see but that they found everything that's all down there sitting down there now this lady here I just felt like we should just talk on her a little bit Helen candy a feminist she was a very early feminist a very independent woman and she set out in the world very influential millionaire from a very rich family and all that sort of stuff but she was uh set out to show that woman can you know basically live without men and be self-sufficient and do everything and so she actually is a very talented writer and some of the stuff that she wrote um she you know artists catch inspiration and so an artist can catch inspiration and be inspired by something and they can actually catch prophetic inspiration from situations and from things and so some of the stuff she said was very interesting she even when the ship went over the iceberg she even had a a vision of the Ark of Noah hitting Mount Ararat and you know this is like that's what she saw she's because you can imagine being on a ship and it's driving in the middle of the ocean and all you feel is that would make you think some pretty intense thoughts you know and she her mind went straight to biblical things and the it's interesting because just that morning she was on the bow of the ship basically Vin inspired by the pride of the Titanic and their in their ability of man and she even has there's a there's accounts of her saying that this ship might even be stronger than God and the moment she thought it she said a fear came over her and darkness and she got she was scared she felt something had changed and so this is this is her um this is her she says one morning I left my cabin early that gave me a chance to go to the bow alone Walnut which was a guy that was courting her or after her had developed a habit of going with me this time I tricked him and thus could have to ship the big ship to myself she impressed on me her personality as I stood at the bow alone that's the front of the ship alone way up there right on that you know I'll show you what it is it's there well that that that's kind of a rendition of her where she would have been standing and these guys James Cameron and his buddies were speaking the narration of what she was saying that's where I was like man it's crazy like she was embodying she was speaking for the ship she was speaking under inspiration the very Spirit of man and and self-sufficiency and pride that was that the ship was like this ship was like the personification of the pride of the Industrial Revolution the very head of it and she was standing there thinking this one morning oh I'll go down she impressed on me the ship now Titanic pressed on me her personality as I stood at the bow alone and absorbed her spirit she was a monarch of the Seas as her bowel cut into the waves throwing tons of water to the right and to the left though in light-hearted playful intent her indifference to mankind was significant in its utter self absorption it was only at the bow that I could appreciate her pride in her size how Grand she was how superb how Titanic oh my oh I was sure she liked her name it suited her Titanic which comes from Greek mythology the biggest ship afloat yet as I analyzed her I shivered with a sense of fear being myself overpowered and turned back into the regions where she kept Comforts for the land lovers not lovers but that's how they used to call them people that were not see men so she was saying I'm going back inside now because she got fearful and and actually like on the documentary they've got manuscripts and other things that that I think she goes further into it this one was published in a newspaper so I don't think she went right into the god stuff but um what they've read and I actually was with him yesterday and I was going to ask him but I forgot about it but I want to know where they read it you know I wanted to see if he got a copy of that manuscript but but he they mentioned that yeah she said that this ship is more powerful than God and the moment she thought it sorry thought it this fear came on her and that was the morning of the sinking pride and self-sufficiency Godless navigation this never you can imagine now this ship in all its pride is navigating a very dangerous sea all the variables all the storms all the icebergs and these icebergs you might see just the tip but underneath is where all the problems are under the water line under where you can see things that are in the Unseen realm as where all the the the problems can exist we all see with our eyes problems on the surface we see the iceberg sticking out and it might be something we're struggling with but it's actually what's underneath the effect of it and what can cause the real damage because if she was scratched on the top it's not going to make us sink this is going to be a sore it's going to be a pain it's going to be a bit of a trial but it's not going to be that bad but it's the it's what's happening in the Unseen realm when you go into those things and you're navigating the sea and you're navigating the Sea of life without God or in your own Pride you could be baptized with the Holy Ghost even and and get proud you know that you can start getting proud about things and God will begin to work and what happens is you're navigating a sea in your own strength in your own pride and you're going to hit it if you and there's icebergs everywhere and there's Devils ten thousand of them will swear to drown you who wants to navigate the sea without God who wants to navigate the sea proud and in their own sufficiency not me not me oh my give me God or give me uh take me away take me to Heaven Lord I don't want to go in Pride and I believe tonight is a night we can just say Lord I'm humbling myself Lord I'm just letting all my self-sufficiency go I'm not I'm not going to hold on to anything that I am in my own self because I don't want a Godless navigation and they were on a Godless navigation and as she thought that it was like she was and you know people in the world have prophetic gifts they can they can see things and catch stuff and do and and feel inspiration and I believe that she was at the bow of that ship and she was inspired by the devil to think those thoughts and she culminated in almost in a negative way prophesied the very heart of the people where they were going and here we have a Biblical judgment strike in such a way and it wasn't just anything it was this was the the elite was on there the elite of the world at that time was on that ship carousing and drunken and you know it reminds me of belshazzar and his feast in Babylon getting all drunk and getting out of hand and beginning to get so proud so proud that he began to take the vessels of Jehovah and drink wine and mockery and judgment came because it was the cup of iniquity who God had enough and there's a time where God has enough but where how far do you need to be brought for you to surrender Pride and I'm speaking on that camera too you're hiding behind that screen Somewhere Out There Pride it's time to humble yourself Hallelujah amen time because we don't want to navigate ourself we have a captain a man he's more than an admiral he's a he's just whoever said it I think it was about a seven star general not just a five-star we got a seven star general that's the one I want navigating my life and if I'm proud how can he navigate I find himself sufficient how can he do it he's not going to override me I'm gonna have to humble myself with all my heart so that he can navigate me through for cease because there's icebergs on this ocean we're in Satan's Eden now all things have been loosed out hell's come up on the earth does everyone know that how come on the Earth it's all the icebergs are out everywhere and they're very small on the top lust after this having a good career doing all these things that looks so innocent but they can be a thing underneath it can take you from God take you away can distract you Pride and all the things that you want to navigate through all this whole sea well don't let me do it without Jesus Christ Hallelujah so here we have now now remember we are receiving warnings it's warning time Hallelujah now I'm talking collectively but you know in your own life where your ship is right now our ships are all in space all in different spaces we're all going through things there's times where our ship is just sailing good and there's times where we've hit an iceberg there's times when we've hit things and I'll show you something soon but unheeded warnings when you hear something when God begins to speak to you it's time to act don't don't just just heed the warnings these telegraphs came through as you read who remembers what it said it said that there was they were too busy they were sending social telegrams for all the Rich and Famous to and they were all they were like these things were coming through there and they were just saying just wait oh my just wait they they two of them I think got through us three or whatever got through to the captain and they kind of just altered course a little bit but then more came and it was like they're everywhere these are icebergs everywhere and I'm telling you now warning icebergs everywhere and they and they're getting smaller and smaller because the sun shines so bright now but there's a big thing under the ocean and the ocean's dark the Steve the seas are dark and there's big spikes underneath the sand you can't see them but we have a seven star general that can and he wants to guide you and he's giving warnings after warnings after warnings and he's saying just humble yourself so that God can heal you so that God can change you so that God can take you higher who wants to go higher I want to go higher I want to be further I want to be deeper with Christ Hallelujah Hallelujah I want my ship to stay afloat and to be will stabilizers on it amen the prophet said the stabilizers are on the ship who wants stabilizers on their ship so that you can stay steady and you've got a seven star captain in the Helm of the ship and he's driving you not some proud arrogant man-made idea that's too proud and it's not necessarily the idea in history it's you that's holding it we got to be very careful it's all in love right unheated warnings they had unheated warnings this apparently the next day they found this this is the iceberg that did it and you can see I'm going to just go from here that's I mean these are these photos are pretty you know these cameras weren't like the cameras they're not add cannons so this here it's hard to see it but they this is all the paint of the ship on here and underneath now is like it would be like massive you know massive only a certain 10 is above the ground the rest of it's bubbling inside the ice cold water with big spikes ready to to hit ships and make them sink so one of the first things they had was their binoculars were inaccessible because of a whole confusion and a guy got laid off and he took the key in so they had no vision they couldn't get into the cabinet they had the binoculars and because they were so proud they didn't think they were going to have any trouble so they didn't there was no they had no fear now this isn't a natural thing natural fear but no we need to have a fear of God don't fear them that can kill your body but fear Him who can kill your body and your soul I know that sounds like you know the opposite of of Grace but it's not because God has got a provision for us right now to come out of the water to come out of a sinking ship and come into the Super Zion amen so look they had no vision they couldn't see clearly because they were they were floating past and pride and and their own man-made ability and they they were they didn't even have a fear enough to be extra precautionary even the captain that didn't even run a they never had done a a you know like a rehearsal of the boats the the safety boats they never even did it they were meant to and it never happened and they're all like I wonder why this didn't happen Pride yeah so proud in the Industrial Revolution and the achievement of man here they were about to hop in a Tower of Babel they were climbing the Tower of Babel they were sailing in the epitome of man's ability and Satan was inside the whole thing enjoying every moment and you know what's interesting very interesting and you can look it up and I didn't put it in here but a book was written 11 years earlier that describes the very event to the ship to the name of the ship everything so there was something that's crazy but someone called an inspiration they actually accused this guy of being a clairvoyant they thought he was like I mean if it was 400 years ago he probably would have got killed as being a witch you know but they accused him of being a clairvoyant for somehow knowing the future it was that the same now this is a very interesting part that observation they found that the rivets were low grade they weren't the proper steel ones in a lot of the very essential parts of the hull so the hull of the ship the very protection of the ship the sheet metal was thick enough that was of good standard but the rivets that held the sheets together was of substandard and you can see now all this red in the rivets these rivets were actually analyzed and they come out of the ship that was at the bottom and all this red stuff is impurities in the rivet and so what happened was when it struck the iceberg as these people said here the hull was not punctured by the iceberg but rather dented such that the whole seams buckled and separated allowing water to rush in so see the devil doesn't just come with sharp stuff he just comes with something blunt and if your rivets aren't if you're if if the protection around you isn't of sufficiency then the thing is it's just going to Buckle in but if you've got Christ in the vessel if you've got the the the the the the the very Seven Star General navigating and he's building the bark of your tree the doctrine revealing to you the word you're in the word you you you know you've got a good foundation in your reading children do you hear me children are you reading every morning are you reading it it doesn't have to be big long chapters and you know but just read it that's a supernatural book you just say Lord I want you to speak to me let me hear it Lord I want to hear you it might be a verse but if he speaks in it's worth everything and that's building your rivets so that when the Devil comes and nudges up against you and he will he will and God and even if even now let me say this is kind of inspiring to me that even with the Seven Star General he's going to allow a few icebergs for you he's going to allow a couple of dents but if your rivets aren't good and if you're just relying on your own without reading without feeding on the word without trusting in the Lord and you're getting into your own sufficiency because it was Pride that they just thought well we just can cut corners and that's what man does and that's what you will end up doing when you're in your own sufficiency when you're proud you'll have to cut Corners because you don't know none of us really really know right we don't know we don't have all knowledge like that we can't just go and look into the future we need him comment we need him and every step every moment we cannot let Pride hold us back this part here is one of the biggest things that really moves me is the Unseen damage you see when they hit that Iceberg they didn't realize how bad it was and actually the interesting thing is it wasn't that big there was one square meter of Hull when if they added all the gases together it was it equated to one square meter in a very very big ship one square meter of gas left unhealed can cause a whole life to sink and if you are willing to be proud and stay proud and not let God heal that thing in your life that's happened like they through Pride left it and and didn't realize how bad it was they just kept going they just keep going they didn't they they just thought it was okay until things started really happening and they realized no no this is not okay this is really not okay and this is the same thing in our own life with our human Spirit we can go through life and things can happen in an unconscious realm things can happen and you might have things that are in your life that you're dealing with that no one can see and you're hiding them and you're harboring them and they're and I'm trying not to look at people because I don't want people to think that I'm talking about them I'm not if I look at you I'm just your friend okay well I'm not meaning you so yeah I feel unconnected if I don't look at people um but you know sometimes when you're saying things and it's like it can be quite challenging you think oh man they're looking at me and sometimes Ben looks at me and he's saying these things and I'm like oh he's looking at me and I'm always owning everything anyway so you know I'm having a I go through a roller coaster sometimes oh my I think we all do right we should right we should be listening to everything and analyzing our life and I want to analyze my life and not right now the very Pride of the Titanic and the people that believed in that Spirit of that age they trusted that it was nothing yeah they should have gone straight to it and they should have sent out the stress straight away they and they wasted hours and in our life we can sit and come to church and go to conventions and go to camps and go to fellowship and you look all good on the top where everyone can see but underneath your waterline is gashes and water's coming in and your ship's getting lower and lower and people are watching a slow sinking sometimes huh it can happen Lord help us and that gesh in our life that no one can see but you know it's there as bolstered and guarded with pride and sometimes we just have to come clean yeah it's Pride that actually holds us in a vice of grudges of of and unforgiveness you know most unforgiveness is caused by your pride being challenged someone's challenge stepped on your pride and now you're holding something because that if you just just let go of that you will be out of there in many cases and forgive people truly forgive because you realize oh it's just they just they just stepped on my toes or they just offended me but the more humble you become the more buoyant and you to become to offenses you know when you're a proud person you get offended all the time I just get offended and offended and you just have this big pride and you're sailing through and everyone thinks you're okay but you've got gashes and you're sinking slowly I watch the two hour There's an actual uh oh my goodness it was just so moving I I watched a two hour real time or four hour whatever it is from 11 40 all the way through to it going down I watched a proper full real-time sinking of the Titanic all done and um uh graphics and things but very good and I was just blown away you just see this big thing just slowly and I thought my goodness Lord never let me have pride in my life that I'm going to keep hiding my real true self and what I'm really struggling with what I'm going through we're here this is what we're here for and it's the pride that's slowly sinking us but yet the Lord is saying I'm here where is your ship where are you how high is your ship how high is the water line where are you I'm just saying that that's a Christian now this was a very interesting thing because I read I mean I'm skipping so many things that I could have put in here because you know we are midweek oh my as the ship sunk more the more cavities they were around it that weren't meant to be there you see now all the stuff starts to crowd around and the more lower you go the faster you're thinking and so where is your ship where are you at where is your life the Titanic is representing your life it's representing you but sometimes some of us have to come to a point you know some of us hear the warnings and we change and we humble ourselves some of us we feel the gash and we get scraped by an iceberg and we humble ourselves some of us are just so proud that we don't even we don't need that we just keep going and we keep holding ourselves up and looking real good but really Insight is is pain insiders is these troubles that are that are that are so deep in fact we can hide them we're hiding them and the law and the Lord is trying to to call us off that thing but he's saying how far does your ship need to sink before you're going to humble yourself and and get and get get help from him because as it goes down the sinking rate increases flowing into windows and vents and so it becomes worse and faster and faster but how far will you go some of us get to this stage before we call for help because it gets to a point now you can't hide it gets to a point now and some of us the ship's gone right down I don't know if I've got any pictures no some of us it gets right down and further and further until it's half under the water and the things sink sticking up in the air like I showed you before those pictures and the whole thing breaks and your life is broken and everything's gone and your family's scattered and it's all just broken for what reason Pride you weren't willing to get help or let go of that thing or truly open up you know sometimes it's just because we our father was horrible to us or or neglected us and so you have this thing that God and you don't realize it but God you in your subconscious thinks God's like that but he's not like that and you have to just scream and cry out to God with all your heart it doesn't have to be loud but just really mean it like Hannah in the temple when she finally came to a point where she said Lord huh I need life some of us our life has been completely obliterated before we've really truly repented and given God everything and surrendered and got help and the ship's gone down you know what happened when the ship went down and you can imagine these people are floating in the sea and this and the ship goes down some of them got sucked in by the current that pulled him down but the people that you can imagine maybe a thousand people just floating around in the sea and they this this giant ship goes down and then all of a sudden a couple of minutes later you hear this and that ship smashed on the floor of the sea 3.8 kilometers down and at that some people's lives have to get to that stage where you're floating in the Atlantic freezing cold but let me tell you there's still hope because our God walks on water and he comes walking on the water even in the stormy seas of your life to say come up hither and if you are willing to surrender your pride and humble yourself totally and say Lord save me like Peter did and Jesus came walking up and he pulled him back so he could walk on the water and give him a new life did he give Peter a new life see Jesus wants to give you a new life he wants to bind up the bridge of your Hull can we have the musicians please as the musicians come I'm just going to work through these things here serenading our sinking ship you see the musicians came on the ship to make it an easier sinking but you see in our life I don't believe that we should just serenade our problems with convention worship and having a great time I mean we should have a great time but if you're just going to go to convince have a great time and not get healed and not get delivered because you're too proud too arrogant to admit that you're wrong and you've got these things in your life that need healing what's the point of serenading yourself David had to serenade Saul Saul serenade he didn't change him how many years was Saul preserved in his mental condition his inferiority complexes because of music that was serenading him and making him feel good but don't be guilty of letting God do that letting the church do that to you no I'm not I'm all for music I love it as you know I love worship I love it I think we should but that shouldn't be the thing that stops you from getting healed because you come into a meeting and you come when you know you've got this trouble you know you need healing and then all of a sudden you feel good again because the music's there though the atmosphere is there and then you don't do that thing that you're meant to do you just had to go and and get serenaded and these guys were serenading the singing of the ship now I give it my hand up to them in that natural condition but your ship doesn't have to go down bear went down because they refused to go to God they refused to come and humble themselves and cry out actually there was a preacher there and he was saving Souls right to the end swimming through the ocean saving Souls I thought Hallelujah I'm gonna meet him one day a real man of God he was saving Souls all the way through to the end and then he froze in the ocean and went down a hero and I'd say that he was the greatest hero of that ship Hallelujah those other people saved Sinners out of the water and they stayed in sin but this man made people go to heaven gave them eternal life was handed through to them and I believe that when you are willing to truly humble yourself and let God heal you no matter what's going on in your life when you're under the squeeze what's going to come out and I would I would think that about this story too if you were on that ship what would have you done would you have been a coward or would you have been a hero I was going to share a testimony but I think I won't but well there was one time I want to share just one testimony can you guys just play I had a song there um the when the road you walk leads you tired and warm oh uh The Battle Belongs to the Lord or the battle is the Lord's yeah the battle is the Lord I it was about well a few years ago now I I started getting real proud I didn't really realize it and sometimes you don't realize that you're proud but if you're stagnant and you're not growing it's probably Pride or if you're able to not if you're not able to forgive someone that's Pride it's proud that there's a pride going and you don't realize it but if you've got In God's Presence not just to serenade you to make you feel better but to actually really get in God's presence in your prayer Closet in your own time with the Lord you get serious with God you've got to come into a place with the Lord where his light shines in your life and discerns your heart so that you can know what's going on with you you know I'm sure we've all prayed this Lord show me where I'm at where am I at Lord what's going on in my life and you take inventory who takes stock do you want to take stock here you've got to take stock children take stock don't just float around you'll end up like that because all the icebergs around cut you up thank God when you take stock and he begins to come down he came down in my life and I was I remember praying I thought Lord I'm just feeling a bit stagnant I don't know why just feeling a bit stale and so I got down and prayed and you know from time to time when I pray the Lord really comes down you know and so I felt like the spirit of God was coming down and then he stopped and he was just above me and I thought man why is he not coming right down you know what's happening and then as he was hovering above all the he revealed the pride and arrogance that was in my life and it just dawned on me the memories and all it just went it just was like in a Split Second and I said oh God forgive me I'm sorry and that was all it took forgive me for being proud and all of a sudden that presence that stopped went just came right down and I was back in Fellowship and maybe you're feeling stagnant or you haven't had an experience like that just ask the Lord what's going on in my life Lord amen Hallelujah I've already touched on this but I want to read this oh this great and sinful Nation that's the very violin that was played as they were sinking down that was serenading them but the music changed watch this oh this great sinful Nations sometimes your rock and rolls are going to stop if you won't listen to the voice of a Preacher you'll listen to the hand of or you'll listen to the hand of God and judgment someday did you get that if you're not going to listen to a preacher you'll listen to the hand of God and judgment someday but the rock and roll will stop that thing those spirits that are taking you into Armageddon those spirits that are influencing you and you're getting into it behind your parents back and things that you're doing without them knowing it's going to take you to judgment which says here the rock and roll they were playing jazz on that thing and they were playing all this nice music and just kind of and all of a sudden it got real serious and they played started playing Nearer My God to thee because the Music's Got to change but how many how long is it going to take what is it gonna take for your music to change now I'm not speaking about music here because I like that well the music is your life the song what are you singing what's coming out what's the the melody is it harmonious with the Holy Ghost what will it take to change the music of your life will it take the ship to the water to come up to you will you be floating in the sea you need a rescue out by the ward Lord that walks on water or will you take the head before the iceberg comes will you take and heed the warnings someday you are going to change that tune the prophet says the music stopped here they they they rejected the message of Daniel and they got proud and they were they were drunk little vessels irreverently out of Jehovah's Temple the vein talks stopped here at the Tower of Babel because this cup of iniquity was getting full you've got to know when you looked you've got to know when you're licked and you need help and it's time to humble yourself where will what will it take for your pride to break where's your ship head how far does your ship need to go before you will make that change because I can guarantee you your ship is going to do that without God that's where every ship is heading every life and I'm not talking about physical life now I'm talking about the life around you your influence your life your school your future everything that you are as a person in your name and your reputation that the life that you live without Christ when you're self-sufficient or you're relying on some other Spirit which is either God or Satan there's only two it's going to go like that if you're not relying on the Lord it's going to go that way but where is it now where's your ship where is it where is your ship you should know where your ship is have you let that gas go on too long have you let that thing go on too long it's never too long it's never too late there's a God here right now to heal you if you're willing [Music] no matter how cold how hopeless how confused how dark how proud you've been until now I'm ready to humble myself laying down every reason every mess every past hurt before my ship lays in the bottom of the Atlantic there's a bit there's someone here that's walking on the water tonight he wants to bring you out but otherwise you'd be like that man now Peter he looked around and he started sinking but you see now he cried out before I end up in the Frozen grave of Pride and separation maybe you're there we've all been in these situations doesn't I don't know how far but some of us have been pretty far we've been pretty low but though I make my bed and Hell behold Thou Art there no matter where you're at tonight there's a man here that can turn on the light there's a man here he's our hero he's our real he's the true man his name is Jesus Christ and he's here to turn on the light he's here to heal you he's here if you're willing to Just Surrender that Pride to surrender self-sufficiency now to lay it all down no matter how far no matter how whatever Ladle down you know one of the biggest things that held me back when I was first giving my life to the Lord I didn't want to surrender my identity I thought I was this uh someone I think rather been preacher on Sunday he said what you thought you were not what you were we weren't that ever that's what we thought we were because the devil influenced us but then God gave you another thought a higher thought he revealed to you who you really are that's who you are and who you always will be and who and and now just catch this now who you always were and are because you're an eternal being you come from God and you're going back before I end up in the Frozen grave of Pride and separation Lord save me out of this mess where are you at that's my last question to you will your pride win or will you lay it down let's stand will your pride win because if your pride wins you stay where you are and you sink if you humble yourself and let God come in and be your sufficiency be your all in all your ship will be healed the bricks will be wherever you're at he will bring your ship out of the Atlantic if it's sinking down if it's all broken apart screaming and all your family's gone he will bring it back do you believe it children do you believe it no matter where you go God will bring it back help never lose hope amen let's sing that song and then we'll pray [Music] so when the road you are leaves you tight and worn oh your strength is gone and your heart feels torn remember those greater than the
