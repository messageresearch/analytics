[43:33] brother Ben just to have been able to
[43:36] extend the invitation amen so we
[43:38] certainly wanted to salute him as well I
[43:41] think he's preaching somewhere else this
[43:42] morning
[43:43] amen so we wanted to salute him
[43:46] thank him for his sacrifice that he's
[43:48] making amen
[43:50] um
[43:52] it's a great calling I was just thinking
[43:54] in the week when um
[43:56] I was listening to the testimony of
[43:58] brother Ed Briscoe and he heard a lot
[44:01] about brother brother Brandon heard a
[44:02] lot about brother Ed Briscoe and then um
[44:06] so you know sometimes God don't show The
[44:08] Profit everything
[44:09] so he didn't sew the profiter brother
[44:13] obviously brother brother Ed biscal
[44:15] before the time so when brother Ed
[44:16] biscal came to the uh
[44:19] came to the hotel
[44:21] and brother Branham came and they said
[44:23] he was sitting there and brother bully
[44:24] Paul and I think brother Donny whoever
[44:27] was helping brother Billy said oh
[44:29] brother brother Eddie's here to see you
[44:30] so when brother Ed came in and um
[44:33] brother
[44:35] Brandon looked at him he said wow you're
[44:38] just a child you know because he was 27
[44:41] years old and and and brother but he
[44:43] said brother Branham was obviously
[44:44] shocked to see how young he was being a
[44:47] pastor ministering and so we're just
[44:49] really happy that God has laid a call on
[44:51] our precious brother's heart
[44:53] amen it's it's amazing it's just so
[44:55] wonderful I believe it's it's also the
[44:57] praise
[44:58] um you know of brother Branham that's
[44:59] being answered I might read I I pray
[45:03] um later on and you can see that none of
[45:05] the praise that you ever make none of
[45:08] the praise that you ever make brother
[45:09] and he just tell me I can switch over to
[45:10] the normal Michael so you know so I'm
[45:12] all in your hands so yeah
[45:14] so we want to salute the the pastor in
[45:17] any you know you pray it may seem
[45:20] insignificant but God answered those
[45:21] prayers amen
[45:23] so yeah we want to salute also the
[45:25] ministers in the church brother Isaac
[45:27] Brother Andy whoever is still preaching
[45:30] a little testimony up incoming ministers
[45:33] um you know we want to salute the
[45:34] ministers we praise his brother cubain
[45:37] just want to say thank you for the
[45:38] service that you render to the church
[45:39] amen it's a great calling
[45:42] um you know you you sometimes there's
[45:45] some people that's in the Forefront and
[45:47] then there's some people that must be in
[45:49] the background never see you know so so
[45:51] we just want to say then that's that's
[45:53] what keeps that's what keeps the the the
[45:55] the the the the the thirds going there's
[45:58] some some parts of your body that's
[46:00] external and there's some parts of the
[46:02] body that's internal and it's hidden
[46:04] away somewhere and you don't see it you
[46:06] see the face you see the eyes you see
[46:09] the hands and then there's other organs
[46:11] that God is placed in the body and they
[46:13] are there but you don't see them but
[46:15] they are just as important it's the
[46:17] posit you see you know so so so
[46:19] um you know whatever you do you may feel
[46:21] insignificant you may feel well I'm just
[46:24] insignificant I come to church I'm just
[46:26] insignificant but you are maybe that
[46:28] small organ somewhere that is that is
[46:31] needed to keep the whole body going you
[46:33] know your little pray your presence here
[46:35] this morning you say ah no I'm not going
[46:38] to bother with going to church you know
[46:39] the church is full but God needs you in
[46:42] needs that small little organ in there
[46:44] you know so so that's what's keeps us
[46:45] going also just the the musicians our
[46:48] precious brother John did you appreciate
[46:50] the singing this morning let's give
[46:51] brother John a hand of a praise
[46:53] amen and also the rest of the musicians
[46:55] amen our precious brother Isaac just
[46:57] also playing this morning or brother Ed
[46:59] we just want to say we appreciate you
[47:01] all the sacrifices the practicing and
[47:03] whatever rather Armand on Wednesday
[47:05] night seems like he's he's going into a
[47:08] different dimension he's going into a
[47:10] different calling
[47:12] so while while the brothers they weren't
[47:15] here and they were out traveling and um
[47:18] so brother armande to stand in and lead
[47:20] the choruses and it was a blessing
[47:22] brother he was he said it was his first
[47:23] time so um yeah no that's just how
[47:27] things get going you know it's just
[47:28] that's how God works you know he will
[47:31] cause the others not to be there so the
[47:33] gift can get exposed you know
[47:36] um brother Branham when he
[47:38] when he gave his heart to the Lord and
[47:41] um
[47:41] and he was in the Baptist Church
[47:45] and
[47:46] was young and just testifying and then
[47:49] um brother Davies Dr Davies the past of
[47:52] the church saw the gift saw the saw the
[47:55] the the the the the eagerness that
[47:56] brother Branham had saw the willingness
[47:58] that he had to to share with with people
[48:00] about what Jesus can do and he opened up
[48:03] the pulpit for brother Branham to preach
[48:06] the Sunday morning and it was his first
[48:08] time preaching and brother Branham
[48:09] couldn't even read properly so sister
[48:11] hoped it to come and sit behind him
[48:14] and he couldn't read properly so she had
[48:17] to read the scripture he said it would
[48:19] be too embarrassing for him to try and
[48:20] read you know and she would be reading
[48:22] the scripture and he would be doing the
[48:23] preaching you know so each of us have
[48:26] thought to play
[48:27] you know it may be small whatever but
[48:29] you have a part to play you know part of
[48:31] the ministry
[48:33] um you were we are working in the
[48:34] ministry so yeah no never ever think
[48:37] that you are insignificant
[48:39] um we'll see a little bit maybe this
[48:41] morning how to load leads
[48:44] um and what the Lord does in your life
[48:47] it's all been pre-planed by God Amen so
[48:49] yeah no we we really see the hour the
[48:53] latest of the day it's um
[48:56] it's a it's a late hour wait it's a late
[48:58] time and we want to do everything that
[49:02] we can just to press on in the battle
[49:05] we've seen many things in the world
[49:07] we've seen many things in the message
[49:09] over the years
[49:10] and I'm honest with you I'm honest with
[49:13] you my wife we were fellowshiping just
[49:16] carrying on and
[49:19] yeah God is is really done great in
[49:22] marvelous things in my life
[49:24] you know I see it a little testimony
[49:27] with some of the brothers Brother Andy
[49:28] and his wife and it probably it's also I
[49:31] think it was this Monday Monday evening
[49:32] to see a a little bit with brother Ben
[49:34] and his wife
[49:36] of my life how God is you know just done
[49:39] things in my life as well
[49:40] growing up you know Pentecostal home
[49:44] and um small boy where's the small boys
[49:48] something there might be a bit smaller
[49:50] than them because I used to hold on to
[49:52] my mom's skirt so I think maybe three
[49:54] years old or something and they would be
[49:55] doing Outreach work missionary work my
[49:58] dad and they would be preaching and you
[50:02] know and then and we call it the cape
[50:03] Flats down in South Africa and I would
[50:06] be preaching in the Kingston infested
[50:08] areas and um they that was um that I was
[50:13] born in 73 so that was year 75 heavy
[50:16] Pentecostal anointing
[50:18] and um yeah so so that's that's how God
[50:21] you know my life was just how God has
[50:23] brought you up in a in a in a Christian
[50:26] home and I was just listening to the
[50:28] testimony of brother Pauly Paul you know
[50:30] and um myself I'm remembering the times
[50:33] you know as I was growing up
[50:35] and uh
[50:37] just laying on the carpet playing with
[50:39] toys I can remember and I'm playing with
[50:42] some toys or stuff like that and there
[50:45] would be country gospel music playing
[50:47] you know so um
[50:48] my mom didn't like the my mom like the
[50:51] old country gospel music
[50:53] and um very very uh quiet persons he
[50:57] didn't say much but very quiet and
[50:59] um like to play The Old Country Costco
[51:01] country gospel music and it was just
[51:04] playing in the background playing in the
[51:05] background and you know when I was in
[51:07] high school
[51:09] um when I came to high school but uh
[51:11] going off the road and trying to be the
[51:14] great person that you you know teenager
[51:16] you doing all sorts of sports and doing
[51:19] this and winning Awards and stuff like
[51:21] that so you know you lose your weight
[51:24] and many times I would be sitting in the
[51:26] in the school and the night before we
[51:29] would have been gone going out we would
[51:31] have been doing whatever we were doing
[51:32] the next day because they knew I was
[51:35] also involved in the in the in the in
[51:37] the youth functions of the school in the
[51:39] Bible studies so last night I was out in
[51:42] the discourse and drinking with my
[51:43] friends and the next day I would be in
[51:45] school and we were sitting in class and
[51:48] that and then many times I would be
[51:50] sitting there and doing the Bible study
[51:51] and then one day I heard some friends
[51:53] walking past me said wasn't it the guy
[51:55] that They carried out of the Disco last
[51:57] night and they was
[51:59] um uh now sitting in the Bible study you
[52:02] know and um It's amazing And when they
[52:04] and and I can remember as they were
[52:06] walking past the window I was just
[52:07] sitting there and you're thinking yeah
[52:09] and they walked and everybody left the
[52:12] Bible study and I was just sitting back
[52:14] in the in the clothes though and the
[52:16] songs this country gospel music just
[52:18] kept on keeping me you know I was just
[52:21] singing to myself I had a little small
[52:22] little blue Gideon's Bible that they
[52:24] used to give and I pulled out my little
[52:26] Gideon Bible and I was just reading and
[52:29] when I listened to the testimony of
[52:30] brother bully Paul
[52:32] um
[52:33] when brother when he he came to brother
[52:36] Branham you know and he said Daddy I'm
[52:37] you know um I bet I'm sitting in Bali
[52:40] you're going on a very dangerous road
[52:42] you know going on a very dangerous role
[52:44] play
[52:45] and he said yes Daddy I know and and
[52:48] then everybody Paul is crying when he
[52:50] gave his testimony and he says look um
[52:52] Satan had me he gripped he had a whole
[52:55] grip on me so you know and he said um
[52:57] brother Branham was explaining to him
[52:59] there telling him well brother Branham
[53:01] was washing his car
[53:03] one morning and he said Billy you know
[53:07] the house that we live in uh it's not
[53:09] our house we don't have a house brenhams
[53:12] never have houses they don't own
[53:13] anything this was given to me by the
[53:15] people of God you know to live in while
[53:17] I'm here
[53:18] and he said um you know what the life
[53:21] you love you can't live with us
[53:23] you can't stay with us because I'm a
[53:26] servant of God and I'm he said yes daddy
[53:29] and then he said brother Branham asked
[53:31] him to to turn around and give his sow
[53:33] his hands left up his hands and he said
[53:34] he he lift up his hands like this
[53:37] and brother Branham said to him no bully
[53:40] not like that stretch it out and he
[53:42] stretched his hands out and while he
[53:44] stretched his hands out he turned around
[53:46] and he could see the the sun and the
[53:49] saddle against the building on the back
[53:51] and it was making a perfect cross
[53:53] as the sun was signing and brother
[53:55] Branham they insult him but he uh
[53:58] he was standing on this point
[54:01] he said this side is the road of the
[54:03] devil the side is the road of Jesus you
[54:06] know and he said like this side is
[54:07] redemption that side you are lost that's
[54:10] the road of hell but decent and he says
[54:13] buddy you are going down this road
[54:15] he says it's going to take you know
[54:17] you're going to go down but at some
[54:19] point along he says you couldn't you
[54:22] cannot hope you are standing here you
[54:24] cannot hold both of these roads at the
[54:26] same time you know and you cannot hold
[54:30] both of these roads at the same time so
[54:32] you're standing here and your choice is
[54:34] to go this way
[54:36] and he says but I have claimed you under
[54:38] the blood and somewhere on this road you
[54:41] will turn around and come back
[54:44] you know and he said he was just
[54:46] listening to his dad
[54:48] and you know and and it was that he's
[54:51] just giving his testimony and he said he
[54:52] left
[54:54] and he's relating that while
[54:57] down the road
[54:59] he was standing at a
[55:01] at a you said you like to play cards and
[55:03] he was standing in a poker game and it
[55:05] was coming into this place wherever they
[55:07] were playing the game
[55:09] and he walked in
[55:11] and
[55:14] he was standing there and told the guy
[55:16] that he wants to play and they said to
[55:18] him no it's a close game
[55:20] it's been pre-selected who can play this
[55:22] game card game or whatever it was it's
[55:24] been pre-selected who can play
[55:26] and he said no but I I would like to
[55:28] play um you know and
[55:31] one of the other guys that was in there
[55:34] walked over and he said let him play
[55:37] this is Reverend William Brennan's son
[55:41] so he used brother branham's name
[55:44] and who brother Branham was so that they
[55:46] can allow Bali to play
[55:48] and uh brother Paul looked at him he
[55:52] says no I'm not his son
[55:55] he says he said he looked at him he said
[55:57] I'm not his son
[55:59] I'm not I'm not I'm not his son he said
[56:02] there was something in him that realized
[56:03] knowing what type of person brother
[56:06] Brandon was there was something in him
[56:07] that just could not identifying playing
[56:10] cards with brother Branham
[56:12] and he said
[56:14] in that defense of brother brain I'm
[56:17] trying to defend him not being but I
[56:18] said but you are he says no I I'm not
[56:20] not in this condition and then he never
[56:23] ended up playing he never ended up
[56:25] playing the game so there's there's
[56:27] while you lost somewhere in the world
[56:29] it's a little piece of God somewhere
[56:31] there's something somewhere I can
[56:33] remember when I uh you know would go out
[56:36] with a friends and
[56:39] you know one one evening I don't know
[56:41] what happened and they must have done
[56:42] some stuff with my Coke
[56:44] and um
[56:46] they they say they carried me home and
[56:50] my mom opened the door up till today
[56:52] um that's what my friends told me my mom
[56:54] never ever spoke to me she's never ever
[56:57] spoken to me about that day being um at
[56:59] that time being um you know leaders by
[57:01] then
[57:02] by then I think they had started a few
[57:05] churches already different churches
[57:06] which they then handed over so they
[57:09] never spoke to me about that evening and
[57:11] when my friends I think a few days later
[57:13] when I said hey Don we carried you into
[57:15] your room into your house you know your
[57:16] mom opened the door and I was like Wow
[57:19] and I believe it's the praise of my
[57:21] mother that carried me through
[57:23] that one day when I came in contact with
[57:25] the word of the hour amen I one day when
[57:28] I came in contact with the message of
[57:30] the hour that I could be a testimony of
[57:32] God's grace and mercy
[57:34] Hallelujah so no matter where somebody
[57:36] might be no matter what a child may be
[57:39] doing no matter what they be doing
[57:41] um
[57:42] uh you know latest neighbor as we also
[57:45] listened last night my wife came across
[57:47] something very nice of brother bully
[57:49] Paul let us never embarrassed
[57:50] embarrassed them
[57:52] try to to portray that we are Holier if
[57:55] somebody is in the world or somebody is
[57:57] a sinner
[57:58] and they don't know let us never come
[58:01] across that we are more holy or better
[58:03] than them tomorrow that person might
[58:06] become converted may give their heart to
[58:09] the Lord may serve the Lord and you
[58:11] you've embarrassed that person somewhere
[58:13] along the road you know so so always
[58:15] have that that good spirit
[58:17] and yes as time went on I might have
[58:20] seen a little bit
[58:22] you know I think it was it was somehow
[58:24] just taking another two to five minutes
[58:27] and um we were living in another area
[58:30] very very rough area
[58:32] and then
[58:33] we moved out of this area to another
[58:35] Another Part of of the city
[58:38] which was a bit more stable
[58:41] um
[58:42] and when we move there
[58:43] I I decided no I'm not I'm not joining
[58:47] the new school and my sister name went
[58:49] my sister she went there I said no I'm

[1:03:57] about Los Angeles that will sing about
[1:04:00] stuff and and we were arguing I was
[1:04:02] arguing with him because I know the
[1:04:04] scripture my dad is uh my dad is a
[1:04:06] bishop you know I know everything I know
[1:04:07] everything man and he was telling me and
[1:04:09] then sometimes he would invite us when
[1:04:11] they used to have youth meeting I would
[1:04:13] be going there as well and they come
[1:04:14] there and I'll come there in my whatever
[1:04:16] dress the way I am and and I'll tell you
[1:04:18] that you know just the youth here now
[1:04:19] they say something about the hair is the
[1:04:21] covering of the human you know my mom
[1:04:23] name the Pentecostal day that time they
[1:04:25] were very very much you know you have to
[1:04:27] just follow what whatever they believe
[1:04:29] was and she would always have a head
[1:04:31] covered you know many people after the
[1:04:33] day that she passed on they never they
[1:04:36] never knew they knew her hair and they
[1:04:37] always knew she had very long hair but
[1:04:39] see you know they were Pentecostal
[1:04:40] people and I would come they said no no
[1:04:42] no no they must be covered and I was
[1:04:46] fighting years later
[1:04:49] God calls that we left the area we were
[1:04:52] building a house my dad lost his job
[1:04:55] the house got auctioned off and we moved
[1:04:56] out of the area when I moved out of the
[1:04:58] area now my friend the best friend we
[1:05:01] both started working at like what you
[1:05:03] would call your Pax pack and save so
[1:05:05] when we went high school we started to
[1:05:07] work working school holidays weekends we
[1:05:08] started working there
[1:05:10] and when we moved out of the area I
[1:05:12] didn't see much of him
[1:05:14] and one day I came to work because we
[1:05:16] only made it to work you know we only
[1:05:17] made it to work after school on Fridays
[1:05:19] and Saturdays and I came I haven't seen
[1:05:21] Mata beam it was matricid during the
[1:05:23] time that we had to write matric exams
[1:05:25] and I was just isolating and it was a
[1:05:27] final year and didn't see much of him
[1:05:30] and one day I came to work and I was
[1:05:33] wearing my swords and I was carrying on
[1:05:34] like I normally did and I saw my friend
[1:05:37] the space friend sitting with the Bible
[1:05:39] and sitting with a small book
[1:05:42] any sitting there and as I'm walking in
[1:05:46] he said to me Donnie now you know
[1:05:48] friends are friends you know you don't
[1:05:51] tell you can't you can't go say the same
[1:05:52] thing to somebody that doesn't know the
[1:05:54] message of the hour but a friend that's
[1:05:55] why God knows how to use people and he
[1:05:58] just said to me
[1:05:59] he didn't see me for months now he just
[1:06:02] said to me why are you wearing this the
[1:06:04] sauce that you're wearing you know God
[1:06:06] has no desire in the legs of a man and
[1:06:08] I'm looking at my friend like what's
[1:06:10] wrong with him you know and slowly he
[1:06:13] started as he was sitting there he
[1:06:15] started gave me a scripture for it he
[1:06:17] said to me go read one Psalm 147 verse
[1:06:19] 10. he said go read that script so I
[1:06:21] always remember that scripture my friend
[1:06:23] just gave it to me Psalm 147 verse 10 go
[1:06:26] read it and wow I mean the evening I
[1:06:29] read it's actually right and slowly God
[1:06:32] used him and the word came to me and a
[1:06:34] few months later I
[1:06:37] um you know God just threw me in threw
[1:06:39] me in I gave a little bit of an extended
[1:06:41] testimony to some of the people and yeah
[1:06:44] and I came to the message of the hour
[1:06:46] and then the next battle was in her in
[1:06:48] the home because my mom then there were
[1:06:49] Pentecostal people and I had to come and
[1:06:52] I had to stand for the message of the
[1:06:54] hour and had to start telling them and I
[1:06:56] had my my Bruce Lee pictures up and all
[1:06:58] the karate pictures up and I started
[1:07:00] peeling all these things off and I had
[1:07:02] brother branham's pizza and I had a
[1:07:04] eagle picture and they thinking what's
[1:07:06] wrong with this boy
[1:07:07] and I grew up in the church
[1:07:10] I grew up in a church at our house if
[1:07:12] they had Services sometimes on a Sunday
[1:07:14] sometimes they didn't travel to the
[1:07:16] church because they had they headed in a
[1:07:18] school then some some of the people when
[1:07:19] they were done they would come to our
[1:07:21] house and then they would have services
[1:07:23] and then when they when they would be
[1:07:25] singing they would be so under the
[1:07:26] anointing and singing and singing and
[1:07:28] just happy and then they would be
[1:07:29] dancing outside around our house and
[1:07:31] nobody they didn't care the neighbor saw
[1:07:33] them so so I knew what is the height of
[1:07:36] what you would call the the Pentecostal
[1:07:39] experience I've seen speaking in tongues
[1:07:41] I've seen all these things yet
[1:07:43] when I came to something else I pulled
[1:07:46] pictures of my wall
[1:07:47] so what was this this is you know when
[1:07:50] when I came to something else I I told
[1:07:52] them that God requires a higher you know
[1:07:56] dedication and yet Pentecost is the
[1:07:58] highest
[1:08:00] and that's just God's grace and mercy
[1:08:03] and one day they decided that's enough
[1:08:05] they're going to drive out this this
[1:08:06] demon or whatever I'm following out of
[1:08:09] me and my dad by then they had started a
[1:08:11] lot of churches so they called a lot of
[1:08:13] people to come and drive the demon out
[1:08:15] and um I was laying in my room and a few
[1:08:18] days before that
[1:08:20] I was reading Cod questioning answers my
[1:08:23] brother Branham says Let Me Take You
[1:08:24] Before Time
[1:08:25] let me transport you a million billion
[1:08:28] years before there was ever an atom or a
[1:08:30] molecule and then he speaks of how you
[1:08:33] were there way way way way way back in
[1:08:35] the mind of God and I was reading this
[1:08:37] now this is the first time I mean I
[1:08:41] I was in the height of the Pentecostal
[1:08:43] realm I know everything and and I've
[1:08:46] never heard somebody preach like this so
[1:08:48] this was something different and I mean
[1:08:50] I could not put that book down
[1:08:52] and in that week while I was in my room
[1:08:55] I still don't know whether it was just a
[1:08:57] dream or trance or whatever and there
[1:08:59] was just this
[1:09:00] um tremendous prison in the room you
[1:09:03] know just in a tremendous praise and as
[1:09:04] I opened my eyes the whole room just was
[1:09:06] like like like you know
[1:09:09] um just Sprite and um I just got a
[1:09:12] conviction to to actually request that
[1:09:14] I'd be baptized and I asked the brother
[1:09:16] can I be baptized and he said yeah you
[1:09:18] will arrange for the pastor and I was
[1:09:20] baptized and a few days later I didn't
[1:09:22] know what was what was coming you know
[1:09:24] and a few days later I'm laying in my
[1:09:26] room you know come from University
[1:09:28] laying there and um
[1:09:32] my dad had arranged with all the
[1:09:34] churches everybody to come
[1:09:36] they they really need all the support of
[1:09:38] the Believers to drive this demon out so
[1:09:41] a lot of people the cars were packed
[1:09:43] around they're going to drive out this
[1:09:44] demon out of me and I didn't know you
[1:09:47] know I'm laying in my room and I knew
[1:09:48] that was my time that I would be resting
[1:09:50] and then they would be coming in and
[1:09:52] when I woke up I'm laying in next thing
[1:09:54] I see my door open they knock can they
[1:09:56] come in here walked in and the whole
[1:09:58] room was specked with pastors they are
[1:10:01] right around my bed everybody was there
[1:10:03] my room was spec my aunts all the people
[1:10:05] that were in the church they just the
[1:10:07] whole house was full of people and
[1:10:08] they're gonna drive out whatever I'm
[1:10:10] believing this thing that I'm believing
[1:10:11] here and then you started praying and
[1:10:14] started carrying on and they're gonna
[1:10:16] they're gonna now drive out this demon
[1:10:17] whatever I'm following
[1:10:20] you know because I'm I'm abnormal you
[1:10:24] know and I don't know I just got up and
[1:10:26] I just said in the name of the Lord
[1:10:27] Jesus Christ this is the true word
[1:10:30] next thing I don't know
[1:10:32] I everybody left my room I don't know
[1:10:34] how it happened I I don't know what
[1:10:36] happened but I know it was must have
[1:10:38] been a tremendous power in the room
[1:10:40] because I felt the same prisons that I
[1:10:42] had when I was when God convicted me to
[1:10:44] be baptized in the room and everybody
[1:10:46] was out of the house out of the room
[1:10:48] people were just out of the house
[1:10:49] everybody was out you know I just say
[1:10:51] this is the true word of the Lord Jesus
[1:10:53] Christ you know everybody was out I
[1:10:55] don't know some of my aunt Sons there
[1:10:56] they up till today I made him at
[1:10:58] funerals in readings sons that they up
[1:11:00] till today I think I was about 17 18.
[1:11:04] some of my aunts never ever spoke to me
[1:11:06] since that day
[1:11:08] so I don't know what happened you know
[1:11:10] um it's just God's grace and and true
[1:11:12] that by that God's mercy he has just
[1:11:14] taken me further and further and we've
[1:11:16] seen many things this morning and we've
[1:11:18] seen many things you know by God's grace
[1:11:20] this morning we can just say it's it's
[1:11:22] it's his loving kindness that is better
[1:11:24] than life I can I can say like brother
[1:11:27] buddy Paul when he was standing at a
[1:11:28] poker game when he left there and then
[1:11:31] obviously when he went and
[1:11:32] when they were going to operate on him
[1:11:34] cavey's testimony
[1:11:36] when he left home
[1:11:38] found lost lost along the way
[1:11:41] and then he stopped in his Testament he
[1:11:42] said never leave home
[1:11:44] you know never leave home and I cannot
[1:11:46] test I mean I never left home but I can
[1:11:48] really say he said when he was laying on
[1:11:50] that bed
[1:11:52] he told him call Daddy and for days they
[1:11:54] couldn't get a hold of brother Branham
[1:11:56] and they said Billy we'll cut out
[1:11:58] whatever they to cut out he'll carry a
[1:12:00] little bag for the rest of your life
[1:12:02] for the rest of your life you'll carry
[1:12:03] this little bag and he said it was
[1:12:06] where's Daddy and he said if daddy wants
[1:12:08] to stay here you know and he said the
[1:12:11] lord gave him the privilege to see the
[1:12:13] angel and I won't go into that now and
[1:12:15] he said then wow brother Brennan was on
[1:12:17] a camp with a family
[1:12:18] Revenant said the angel appeared to
[1:12:20] brother Branham and said you better make
[1:12:22] your way down to bully anybody was
[1:12:25] finished they were just about to go and
[1:12:26] operate and then the next thing he said
[1:12:28] he just felt a hand on him and he looked
[1:12:30] and he said there was his daddy
[1:12:32] and brother Branham said to him bully
[1:12:35] the angel the one that God allowed for
[1:12:38] you to see he's come to call me out of
[1:12:40] the hoods to come here
[1:12:42] and then brother Brennan was speaking he
[1:12:44] says daddy pray for me and then brother
[1:12:45] Branham he said that he said to him
[1:12:48] nobody
[1:12:49] you are the one that went off the road
[1:12:52] you have to repent and I will pray for
[1:12:54] you so you know and and that that's just
[1:12:57] God's grace and his Mercy we may think
[1:13:00] that our children away what we just have
[1:13:02] to stay calm we may think that our
[1:13:04] family members we may think of your mom
[1:13:07] your brother your sister just relax
[1:13:08] don't worry
[1:13:10] don't worry
[1:13:12] don't worry about your brother and your
[1:13:14] sister and your mom and your dad
[1:13:16] all we have to do is testify to them
[1:13:19] don't convince them
[1:13:21] brother Ed biscal said one thing that is
[1:13:24] learned when you swim brother Brennan
[1:13:25] was speaking to him it was a it was a
[1:13:27] difficult time for him because on the
[1:13:30] one hand people were telling him about
[1:13:31] things and they said that Brennan was a
[1:13:34] false prophet and the other hand
[1:13:36] God allowed him to meet with brother
[1:13:37] Branham and more and more he started
[1:13:40] realizing but this is the real thing
[1:13:42] this is it what brother Brennan was
[1:13:45] saying what brother he saw the real
[1:13:47] things and he had troubles in his own
[1:13:49] heart and when they were on a little
[1:13:50] Camp he felt his heart and packed his
[1:13:53] bags he had to leave
[1:13:54] and then brother Bradham told him came
[1:13:56] into the tent sit down and said to
[1:13:59] brother Ed brother Ed don't worry
[1:14:02] they won't take the church from you he
[1:14:05] had three problems that he had in
[1:14:06] brother random named all three and it
[1:14:07] was only in his heart he said you see it
[1:14:09] earlier this morning when I took the
[1:14:11] horses across the river the Lord
[1:14:13] appeared unto me and he said to me
[1:14:15] what's burdening in your heart and
[1:14:17] brother Ed said brother never tried to
[1:14:19] convince anybody
[1:14:21] he just tried to tell him about of the
[1:14:24] goodness of Jesus and you know the
[1:14:26] wonderful thing is
[1:14:27] that um
[1:14:29] years a few years later my mom and two
[1:14:32] sisters passed away in a motor car
[1:14:33] accident I was driving in the one car
[1:14:35] they were driving in another car they
[1:14:37] never came to the message of the album
[1:14:39] they never came to the message of the
[1:14:41] hour
[1:14:42] right but I believe that they will be
[1:14:45] there
[1:14:47] I believe there will be they
[1:14:49] right
[1:14:51] um so rebellum says all that love you
[1:14:56] and all that you love will be there now
[1:15:00] I don't know how it's going to be
[1:15:04] I can't explain it
[1:15:07] all that you love
[1:15:10] and all that love you they will be thee
[1:15:13] so if you have a little cat or a dog
[1:15:17] they're going to be there now if God is
[1:15:20] gonna have your little bird over there
[1:15:23] because you love that bird
[1:15:26] I if he's going to have brother
[1:15:28] branham's dark fruits over there you
[1:15:30] know the fruits was poisoned
[1:15:32] the policeman poisoned brother branham's
[1:15:34] dog Fritz brother Brandon was very very
[1:15:36] sad about that and he left home because
[1:15:38] of that because he was going to go kill
[1:15:39] the policeman it was not converted in
[1:15:42] and he said when he was taken across the
[1:15:45] curtain of time in fact it was the
[1:15:46] millennium
[1:15:48] because in occurred enough time when he
[1:15:50] was taken over he actually saw his dog
[1:15:53] over there
[1:15:54] so if God is going to have your dog over
[1:15:56] there don't worry
[1:15:58] the old mom that gave you that food
[1:16:02] your dad had looked after you so nicely
[1:16:04] that honed you from all the wrong things
[1:16:05] he may not be in the message of the hour
[1:16:08] all that you love
[1:16:11] and all that love you they will be thee
[1:16:14] and that just takes all the praise of
[1:16:16] you
[1:16:17] to just live a normal normal humble
[1:16:21] Christian Life
[1:16:22] you don't have to exert yourself you
[1:16:24] don't have to fight you don't have to
[1:16:26] try and convince them you don't have to
[1:16:28] try and write emails and put things on
[1:16:30] Facebook to convince your mom and dad
[1:16:32] and your aunts and uncles
[1:16:33] that's lovely we do that what is the
[1:16:35] Lord leads but it just takes all the
[1:16:37] praise of you it's all in the hands of
[1:16:40] the Lord amen so brothers and sisters

[1:20:22] mine was stolen so
[1:20:25] it's just um
[1:20:27] wonderful I just want to read
[1:20:30] something for you out of the title this
[1:20:33] morning just taken out of Genesis 45 is
[1:20:36] verse 3 I am Joseph
[1:20:41] I am Joseph amen
[1:20:45] Amen brother Branham says here
[1:20:49] he says this is out of the Revelation
[1:20:52] series brother brilliant preacher Series
[1:20:53] in in the in um I think it's in 60 60
[1:20:56] between the 60 the last in the month of
[1:20:59] December 1960 he preached the whole
[1:21:01] Revelation series after they preach I
[1:21:03] think the third sages upon my heart the
[1:21:05] Holy Spirit had laid this warning of
[1:21:07] conviction
[1:21:08] that the church in this day should have
[1:21:12] this message because I believe that it
[1:21:15] is the most outstanding message he says
[1:21:17] here of the Bible because it reveals
[1:21:19] Christ in his church at this time and
[1:21:22] then no one can have faith or know what
[1:21:25] they are doing or whether they are or
[1:21:27] where they are going unless they have
[1:21:29] some something to base their thoughts
[1:21:31] and faith upon therefore if the
[1:21:34] scripture is revealed Christ to us in
[1:21:36] these last days and the condition of
[1:21:39] times it will do us good to search the
[1:21:42] scripture he says here find out where we
[1:21:44] are at so you want to know where you are
[1:21:46] going you want to know what's the
[1:21:47] direction you should take in life you
[1:21:49] want to know what decisions you should
[1:21:50] make tomorrow you want to know whether I
[1:21:52] should do this and that he says no one
[1:21:55] can have faith he says unless they have
[1:21:59] something to base their faith upon so
[1:22:02] you must have something to base your
[1:22:05] faith upon you must have an absolute so
[1:22:08] if you're not going to be sure is this
[1:22:09] right is that right sit down do this
[1:22:11] should I do that you don't know what are
[1:22:12] you doing is right amen and he says it
[1:22:16] never dawned upon my heart so much until
[1:22:19] the last election so it's 1960 brother
[1:22:22] Branham 57 something happened 56 he
[1:22:24] starts he starts feeling the presence
[1:22:26] and he's now after the election and then
[1:22:29] he realizes and he's reading this and
[1:22:31] this is when JF Kennedy was was elected
[1:22:33] and I said and then I seen where we are
[1:22:36] at and the Holy Spirit begin to reveal
[1:22:39] to me to hone the people and to place
[1:22:41] this he says and I cannot decease the
[1:22:44] church like this sufficiently and then
[1:22:47] if I sit down and wrote a book I feel
[1:22:49] that if I got to the pulpit then the
[1:22:51] inspiration of the Holy Spirit amongst
[1:22:53] the Christians Came Upon me to help me
[1:22:55] then I would be more sufficient to write
[1:22:57] the Books of brother Branham wanted even
[1:22:58] to to Europe and he wanted to write some
[1:23:00] stuff because you know he felt it
[1:23:02] anointing he sees the hour now he wants
[1:23:04] to bring it over and and he says I even
[1:23:06] want to write a book so that you can see
[1:23:07] where we are at
[1:23:09] no he goes in he's speaking of
[1:23:13] Revelations The Book of Revelation now
[1:23:15] we will do everything we can he says
[1:23:18] here this morning I'm starting here
[1:23:20] first chapter of Revelation The Book of
[1:23:22] Revelation and a revelation is set in
[1:23:26] three parts
[1:23:27] The Book of Revelation is set in three
[1:23:29] parts first three chapters he says is
[1:23:33] what we'll be dealing with in these
[1:23:35] eight days when one Church AIDS could
[1:23:38] take us a month but we'll just have to
[1:23:41] hit the high places and we call it then
[1:23:44] we get to the book this he says yeah it
[1:23:46] will be written out in more detail now
[1:23:49] Revelations the first three chapters
[1:23:51] deals with the church
[1:23:53] he says the deals here you see all the
[1:23:56] way from Ephesus to lodicia the first
[1:23:58] three chapters then then the church
[1:24:01] disappears
[1:24:02] we see it no more until the end time
[1:24:06] from Revelations one two three the third
[1:24:09] then he says from Revelations 4 to 19 is
[1:24:14] Israel a nation
[1:24:16] so Revelations one two three deals with
[1:24:18] the church 4 to 19 Israel a nation right
[1:24:21] then he says now the third part in 19-22
[1:24:25] is now the third part so Revelations one
[1:24:27] two three the thirds and 4 9 to 19
[1:24:30] Israel 19 to 22 is both of them together
[1:24:33] and the plagues and the warnings and so
[1:24:36] forth at the end sit in three parts see
[1:24:39] now you can't also just take it in
[1:24:41] another place but Abraham says you can't
[1:24:42] run it chronological like that because
[1:24:44] you'll get confused because between 4
[1:24:46] and 19 there's a lot of things happening
[1:24:48] between Revelations 4 and Revelation
[1:24:51] chapter 19 a lot of things happening and
[1:24:54] if you take it chronologically like this
[1:24:56] because in other places you can't take
[1:24:58] it chronologically you now have to have
[1:25:00] Revelation right so he says because
[1:25:02] there's things happening in between
[1:25:03] there in between there that he deals
[1:25:06] with the Gentiles right
[1:25:08] because
[1:25:09] when he's done with the church ages the
[1:25:13] book is a tremendous wonderful book it
[1:25:16] runs up and if you can open your Bibles
[1:25:18] fast in Revelations chapter 4 it runs up
[1:25:21] to a certain point
[1:25:23] and from that point onwards he's done
[1:25:25] with the Gentile Church
[1:25:28] he's done with the 10th outside
[1:25:29] Revelations is finished one two three is
[1:25:31] done now he's telling you this over here
[1:25:35] that now he deals with Israel from
[1:25:37] Revelations 4 to Revelations 19 he's
[1:25:40] right
[1:25:41] he's right but remember he is now from
[1:25:46] Revelations 4 onwards he's not dealing
[1:25:49] with the church but he's dealing with
[1:25:51] the bride
[1:25:52] so so brother Brandon doesn't say that
[1:25:54] in that quote he says to you he deals
[1:25:56] with the church he says he deals with
[1:25:58] Israel and he says he deals with both of
[1:26:00] them together but Revelations 4 there is
[1:26:04] a different thing happening there is the
[1:26:06] Gentiles it has come Hallelujah to him
[1:26:09] the bride and they have been called out
[1:26:11] so let's go to Revelations 4.
[1:26:14] Hallelujah so so this this this oh this
[1:26:18] Bible is just alive it's just a
[1:26:19] wonderful book and brother Branham says
[1:26:21] this book is called the he says
[1:26:23] Revelations it means the unfolding the
[1:26:25] unveiling he says it's a great
[1:26:27] Revelation is an apocalypse and opening
[1:26:30] up Hallelujah so so so it's God
[1:26:33] unfolding the word all the time it's a
[1:26:36] great unfolding so now Revelations 1 to
[1:26:39] 4 you see that you might even see it in
[1:26:41] your Bible if you look at the Revelation
[1:26:42] 3 to 14 which is the you might have it
[1:26:45] on your Bible so I'm just stopping there
[1:26:46] first verse 14 says 3 14 and unto the
[1:26:49] angel of the Church of laodicea laodicea
[1:26:52] is the last search age if you go back
[1:26:54] and you read back back you'll find now
[1:26:55] there's seven thirds ages so he's taken
[1:26:57] you all the way from Revelations one I'm
[1:26:59] the one in the midst of the candlesticks
[1:27:01] I am this great one we'll touch a little
[1:27:02] bit just on the quote but then he goes
[1:27:04] and he goes in the third ages
[1:27:05] Revelations 3 he speaks of lodicia the
[1:27:09] world that we are in I am rich I have
[1:27:11] need of nothing and that's the spirit of
[1:27:13] the day see people have no need of
[1:27:16] anything anymore they were not like the
[1:27:18] forefathers they they struggled to get
[1:27:20] something so they had to believe on God
[1:27:22] they had to trust God they had to do to
[1:27:25] know we can do it ourselves that's load
[1:27:27] easier we can do everything ourselves
[1:27:29] Hallelujah and that is the spirit of
[1:27:31] laodicea so now I'm not talking about
[1:27:34] 2021 behold I stand at the door knock
[1:27:36] I'm now past so now Revelations he's 21
[1:27:40] he's now even 321 he's even being put
[1:27:43] outside the church and then it's a
[1:27:46] Dimensions change happens
[1:27:49] right a dimension Saints verse 4 tip to
[1:27:52] four one after this so now
[1:27:56] you've seen what happened
[1:27:57] John on the Isle of Patmos
[1:28:00] after this I looked
[1:28:03] after this I looked
[1:28:06] and behold a door was opened in heaven
[1:28:11] different dimension
[1:28:13] Paul said I was caught up in the heavens
[1:28:15] of the heavens I was scored up in the
[1:28:17] dimension of the dimensions Hallelujah
[1:28:20] so what we're dealing with here wow I
[1:28:22] should have actually put a picture on I
[1:28:24] don't know if you've seen the picture of
[1:28:25] brother Brandon preaching they pull it
[1:28:27] on fire over there you might have seen
[1:28:29] it when the little Lily just became
[1:28:31] bigger amen and brother Brandon was
[1:28:33] preaching and they were behind him was
[1:28:35] in the polar fire was a face it was like
[1:28:38] an Indian behind him
[1:28:40] you know and brother relates about that
[1:28:41] he said it was his old mates are always
[1:28:43] haunting him always chasing him that you
[1:28:45] know that nature and and but in that
[1:28:49] and what with brother brother was
[1:28:51] standing there when that picture was
[1:28:52] taken I think it is Zechariah or Isaiah
[1:28:55] one of the prophets they actually saw
[1:28:57] that and they prophesied about and they
[1:28:59] saw it they said and around
[1:29:02] his lawyers he says curded with stripes
[1:29:05] of pillars of fire and you see how it
[1:29:07] makes types of color on fire
[1:29:09] so what we are dealing with in the
[1:29:11] message of the hour we are not dealing
[1:29:13] with Building a Church
[1:29:16] after this I looked and behold a door
[1:29:20] was open in heaven so that's why in
[1:29:23] brother brenham's Ministry brother
[1:29:25] Branham things that happen in his life
[1:29:27] things that happen in his ministry that
[1:29:29] serves his head to else brother Branham
[1:29:33] right they had to think and they said he
[1:29:35] spreads present states of my Ministry he
[1:29:37] preached my new ministry it was a stage
[1:29:40] where the pool the first spool was was
[1:29:43] throwing the people all over you could
[1:29:45] see yeah I mean I listened this week to
[1:29:47] brother Sydney Jackson I listened to his
[1:29:49] testimony this week he said people in
[1:29:51] Durban South Africans Johannesburg when
[1:29:53] people were coming still they were still
[1:29:55] coming to the racetrack
[1:29:57] right they were still coming there to
[1:29:59] the the one was in the racetrack in
[1:30:00] Durban I think the other one was in the
[1:30:01] what a big building of the Railway
[1:30:04] Station that they're using Johannesburg
[1:30:06] but he said the roads were blocked off
[1:30:08] and he says people be coming what their
[1:30:11] wheelchairs people were crutches in the
[1:30:13] lakes with pieces of Steel and as they
[1:30:16] got out of the ambulance they pulled it
[1:30:18] off and they walked into the services
[1:30:20] Hallelujah so you talk off you talk of a
[1:30:24] a different pool that was pulling them
[1:30:27] and it was right around the world bully
[1:30:30] poor relationships we would want to go
[1:30:31] home and we're playing outside we come
[1:30:34] in I want to grab a donut on the kitchen
[1:30:36] table I couldn't the whole table is
[1:30:38] fully I was laying full with tickets
[1:30:40] from all air tickets flight tickets from
[1:30:42] all over the world for Daddy and we
[1:30:44] couldn't get to our little Donuts to eat
[1:30:46] so you took off that pool and as time
[1:30:49] went on no more tickets on the table
[1:30:51] this man is stopping off serpent seed
[1:30:54] this man is talking this and that and
[1:30:56] God was changing the pool first he was
[1:30:58] throwing out that net pulling in pulling
[1:31:00] in and people were coming coming and
[1:31:02] then later on Jesus was walking with him
[1:31:05] and then Jesus started saying that you
[1:31:09] must eat my flesh and drink my blood and
[1:31:12] the people saying what's wrong with this
[1:31:13] guy
[1:31:15] what's wrong then he didn't come now and
[1:31:17] say bring bread I'm going to feed all of
[1:31:18] you it was a Saints in Jesus ministry
[1:31:21] what Jesus was saying is uh you must
[1:31:25] come now to a different realm and then
[1:31:27] it so happened that people you know the
[1:31:29] crowds were there when he took that boys
[1:31:31] three fishes and and two loaves of bread
[1:31:34] he fed five thousand only the men and
[1:31:37] the boys what about the females the
[1:31:38] Bible said so maybe it was ten thousand
[1:31:40] people from that he Faith so there was a
[1:31:42] big following when he came to this point
[1:31:45] so many things started happening in his
[1:31:47] ministry because he gave The Sermon on
[1:31:49] the Mount he started giving different
[1:31:50] things he says you know your mother and
[1:31:53] father you must forsake mom and dad you
[1:31:54] must forsake your father you must leave
[1:31:56] your mother and you just say who in the
[1:31:58] people started leaving him
[1:32:00] what was he saying leave your Traditions
[1:32:02] leave your old way of doing and Jesus
[1:32:04] was wanting them to come to a different
[1:32:06] realm and then the crowd was starting to
[1:32:09] move out maybe there was only 85 or 100.
[1:32:12] and then the Bible says and that 70 also
[1:32:14] left him when he's my when he said this
[1:32:17] saying that you must eat my flesh and
[1:32:18] drink my blood they also lived and then
[1:32:21] he turned to Peter them and he said to
[1:32:22] them do you also want to leave leave
[1:32:25] you see that so you can see this message
[1:32:28] that we're dealing with it is completely
[1:32:31] different it's not such ages
[1:32:34] is after this I looked it's something in
[1:32:38] a different realm and then Peter said to
[1:32:40] him Lord where can we go
[1:32:42] we can't go anywhere you alone have the
[1:32:45] words of eternal life so so so so the
[1:32:48] the and brother Branham says nothing in
[1:32:51] Peter men kindly speaking could say that
[1:32:54] but it was granted to him from the
[1:32:56] father above to say that Lord I don't
[1:32:58] know where to go I can only stick with
[1:33:00] you you have the words of eternal life
[1:33:02] Hallelujah and that's what you do you
[1:33:04] know brother Branham says it one place
[1:33:06] he says that
[1:33:12] related to you in the Revelation series
[1:33:14] brother Branham says that this
[1:33:17] Revelation is for a special class of
[1:33:20] people
[1:33:21] it is for the it's for a special class
[1:33:23] of people not everybody can see this
[1:33:27] word not everybody can see this message
[1:33:30] of the day it's for a special group of
[1:33:33] people
[1:33:34] Hallelujah let me see if I can find it
[1:33:37] for you
[1:33:39] yep there he is
[1:33:40] let me see
[1:33:44] and the Book of Revelation has more
[1:33:48] symbols
[1:33:49] he says in it then all the rest of the
[1:33:52] books in the Bible it is more symbols
[1:33:55] because it is a book of Prophecy now
[1:33:57] this is the Book of Revelation it's the
[1:33:59] last book but it's a book of Prophecy it
[1:34:02] was not prophesying he says it's a
[1:34:04] prophetic book therefore it has to be
[1:34:07] understood by a prophetic class
[1:34:12] brothers and sisters
[1:34:14] you you don't know you are like that
[1:34:19] woman that came to the well
[1:34:21] there was something in you
[1:34:25] this book is not meant for everybody
[1:34:30] he says there's nobody can hardly
[1:34:33] understand it this book is made for a
[1:34:37] certain class of people
[1:34:39] he says here over in Deuteronomy it says
[1:34:42] the hidden things Belongs to the Lord so
[1:34:46] you are like that woman in the world a
[1:34:49] special class of people
[1:34:50] that can live in your son that you are
[1:34:53] busy with right that is a party to play
[1:34:56] out
[1:34:57] if you follow the life of Joseph if you
[1:35:00] follow in between Joseph after he was
[1:35:03] rejected by his Brethren right in
[1:35:06] between there they speak of Judah
[1:35:08] and how Judah went into a harlot
[1:35:11] and one of the sisters Tamar played the
[1:35:14] part of our hearts he was supposed to be
[1:35:16] married to Jesus Son and said him and
[1:35:20] Judah never gave her the son he forgot
[1:35:21] about the promise and what she did she
[1:35:24] dressed herself as a harlot she said by
[1:35:26] the gate and he went in unto her and she
[1:35:29] said well if you come in unto me to
[1:35:31] raise up seed what are you going to give
[1:35:33] me
[1:35:35] and he gave his ring he gave his
[1:35:37] bracelet do you want to read it let's
[1:35:38] read it quickly
[1:35:39] Hallelujah this is this is we we we're
[1:35:43] dealing with a tremendous thing in the
[1:35:46] hour that we are busy with Hallelujah
[1:35:49] let's just read it in Genesis
[1:35:51] amen so you you'll see what our lives is
[1:35:55] all about God doesn't do things has it
[1:35:58] God doesn't do things for fun no brother
[1:36:01] Branham says this whole Bible is it's
[1:36:03] inspired this whole Bible is it's a book
[1:36:06] of redemption it's a book of how God
[1:36:09] hallelujah is trying to make that whole
[1:36:11] plan known amen so here it is let's just
[1:36:14] see here
[1:36:16] amen I read it in the week
[1:36:19] okay
[1:36:21] okay sorry I just want to go back here
[1:36:24] amen I think it is
[1:36:30] hey man just trying to get this one here
[1:36:32] 37.
[1:36:35] yep there we go great
[1:36:38] Genesis chapter 38.
[1:36:42] so we'll go back to Joseph but we just
[1:36:45] want to throw this in quickly
[1:36:46] right and it came to pause at that time
[1:36:50] that Judah went down from his Brethren
[1:36:52] and turned into a certain adulamite
[1:36:55] whose name was Hira and Judah saw there
[1:36:57] a daughter of a certain Canaanite whose
[1:37:01] name was sure and he took her and went
[1:37:04] in unto her and see conceived and bear a
[1:37:08] son and he called his name air and C
[1:37:11] conceived again and bear a son and she
[1:37:14] called his name Onan and see yet again
[1:37:17] conceive and bear a son and called his
[1:37:19] name Cellar and he was he says here at
[1:37:23] Jason and see bear him and Judah took a
[1:37:27] wife for air his firstborn whose name
[1:37:30] was Tamar and air Judas firstborn was
[1:37:33] wicked in the in the sight of the Lord
[1:37:35] he says here the Lord slew him
[1:37:38] he says in Judah said unto Onan go in
[1:37:41] unto thy brother's wife is obviously the
[1:37:43] tradition was he says you're going on to
[1:37:46] the end or marrying her and raise up
[1:37:48] seed to thy brother and owner knew that
[1:37:51] the seed should not be his and it came
[1:37:53] to pass when he went in unto his
[1:37:56] brother's wife that he spilled It On The
[1:37:58] Ground lest he should give seed to his
[1:38:00] brother and the thing that he did
[1:38:03] displeased the Lord wherefore he slew
[1:38:05] him also
[1:38:09] his daughter-in-law remain a widow at
[1:38:13] thy Father's House told Selah my son be
[1:38:17] grown for he said Lester Adventure he
[1:38:21] die also as his Brethren did and
[1:38:24] tomorrow went and dwelt in a father's
[1:38:26] house and in process of time so you see
[1:38:30] this boy must have been about five or
[1:38:31] seven when he say this wait till he's
[1:38:33] grown up then you can have him and
[1:38:35] that's I've lived in the East and I've
[1:38:36] worked there that's exactly what they do
[1:38:38] when they say this uh the Boyer side or
[1:38:41] they say even the scripture when the
[1:38:42] scripture would say sometimes and um
[1:38:45] Soul reigned and saw rain in the state
[1:38:48] of David and then they say who how could
[1:38:51] he have reigned he was only seven years
[1:38:53] old but they they the rain is given to
[1:38:55] him till he's reads maturity that's how
[1:38:57] they do it so you they say I'm your
[1:38:59] husband but they wait till you are reach
[1:39:01] a stage of maturity so they were set
[1:39:02] aside for each other so that's what he
[1:39:04] did right
[1:39:06] and and in process of time the daughter
[1:39:10] of Seward judah's wife died and Judah
[1:39:13] was comforted and went up to see Furious
[1:39:17] all of them not to terminal sorry he and
[1:39:21] his friend Hira did a dilemma
[1:39:25] and it was still tamas saying we hold
[1:39:28] thy father-in-law go out up to terminal
[1:39:31] to seriously and she put her Widow
[1:39:34] garments off from her soul
[1:39:36] Mary died second one died now she's
[1:39:39] still mourning she's putting over Widow
[1:39:41] the garments right and covered with and
[1:39:44] covered her would a veil and ripped
[1:39:46] herself and sit in an open place which
[1:39:50] is by the way of temnot
[1:39:52] and she saw that Sheila was grown and
[1:39:57] she was not given unto him to wife
[1:39:59] according to the promise of Judah was
[1:40:01] supposed to keep the promise and he did
[1:40:03] not and Judah saw her now she's playing
[1:40:07] she's sitting there let me read this
[1:40:08] slowly sorry I'm going a bit faster and
[1:40:11] she put her with his garments off from
[1:40:13] her and covered her with a veil
[1:40:16] right I'm a bit conscious of time
[1:40:19] because I was thinking maybe there's
[1:40:20] this evening service you know you're
[1:40:22] pressing because you're looking at the
[1:40:23] time so you know but we don't have
[1:40:25] evening service do we so praise God I
[1:40:27] won't be too long just want to throw
[1:40:28] this one in he says here and sit in an
[1:40:31] open place which is by the way of timna
[1:40:34] for she saw that seller was grown and
[1:40:37] she was not given in and given unto him
[1:40:40] to wife and Judah saw he taught her to
[1:40:44] be in Harlot so what she did heard where
[1:40:47] he was going
[1:40:48] take off a widow clothes trust yourself
[1:40:50] as a harlot and sit in this place
[1:40:53] because she had covered her face
[1:40:56] and he turned unto her by the way and
[1:40:59] said go to I pray thee let me come in
[1:41:02] unto thee for he knew not that c was his
[1:41:06] daughter-in-law
[1:41:08] now I'm just stopping this here I've
[1:41:10] read a scripture for you out of out of
[1:41:13] Genesis 37.
[1:41:16] something happened
[1:41:18] with Joseph
[1:41:20] came unto his brethren and when he came
[1:41:22] unto his Brethren his Brethren said
[1:41:25] behold the dreamer cometh and you can go
[1:41:28] read what happens further in Genesis 37
[1:41:31] where his Brethren took him took off his
[1:41:33] coat of many colors threw him in the pet
[1:41:35] will relate on on that now they sold him
[1:41:39] for 20 pieces of silver
[1:41:41] well brother Branham says Joseph is a
[1:41:43] perfect type of Jesus Christ
[1:41:45] he's a perfect type of Christ in his
[1:41:48] first coming
[1:41:49] he's also a perfect type of Christ in
[1:41:52] his second coming
[1:41:53] was thrown into the pit came out of the
[1:41:56] brother Branham says the blood on him he
[1:41:59] says Jesus Christ the first coming
[1:42:01] thrown into a Putin overcame raised then
[1:42:04] in the second coming which will touch on
[1:42:07] a little bit later he also is portraying
[1:42:10] the second coming which will touch on
[1:42:12] further from Genesis from Genesis 42 on
[1:42:15] which we'll touch on it but now here is
[1:42:18] Joseph
[1:42:20] then the story in Genesis chapter 37 all
[1:42:23] of a sudden it stops
[1:42:25] and then God brings in the story of
[1:42:28] Judah in Tamar
[1:42:30] God interrupts
[1:42:33] he interrupts the the story of Joseph
[1:42:37] here is Genesis 37 Joseph
[1:42:39] he talks of Joseph
[1:42:41] then he interrupts it with one scepter
[1:42:44] and then Genesis 39 he carries on with
[1:42:46] the life of Joseph he's sowing something
[1:42:49] significant in between that
[1:42:51] it is a Redemption to a gentile people
[1:42:54] that is sowing in between there that's
[1:42:56] happening
[1:42:57] because Joseph is a he plays a part in
[1:43:00] brother Branham says that he's the
[1:43:02] perfect type of Christ
[1:43:05] Hallelujah a perfect type so he
[1:43:07] interrupts his program and he throws
[1:43:09] something in the Bible and if you read
[1:43:11] the Bible you will say but I think they
[1:43:13] should have taken Genesis 38 and just
[1:43:15] put it somewhere else because it's
[1:43:16] interrupting it's talking about Joseph
[1:43:18] and it brings about Judah and what he
[1:43:19] did and all these bad things and then
[1:43:21] all of a sudden it carries on with those
[1:43:22] of God it's perfect
[1:43:24] Hallelujah so so let's carry on and he
[1:43:27] turned in unto her
[1:43:29] a right verse 16.
[1:43:31] I pray they let me come in unto thee for
[1:43:34] he knew not that she was his
[1:43:35] daughter-in-law and she said what will
[1:43:38] thou give me
[1:43:40] what will you give me if you're gonna
[1:43:42] come in unto me
[1:43:43] I'm playing the spot of a holiday but
[1:43:46] what are you going to give me
[1:43:49] and he said I will send thee
[1:43:52] a kid from The Flock and sees it will
[1:43:55] thou give me a plate till thou send it
[1:43:59] and he said what place shall I give the
[1:44:02] NC seed thy Signet right so first he
[1:44:06] asked for a Signet die bracelets and I
[1:44:10] starve so she asked for those three
[1:44:12] items
[1:44:13] Judah being a ruler Judah being rich you
[1:44:16] know having all because they were and
[1:44:18] she's saying to him I want these three
[1:44:20] pieces from you I want your Signet I
[1:44:24] want your bracelet and I want your staff
[1:44:26] that that it is in thine hand that is in
[1:44:29] thine hand and he said it and and he
[1:44:32] gave it unto her and came in unto her
[1:44:35] and she conceived by him
[1:44:38] and see a rose and went away and laid by
[1:44:41] a veil from her he says yeah and he and
[1:44:44] put on the Garment of a widowhood so he
[1:44:46] changed the game went back put who we
[1:44:49] don't on again playing a drama playing a
[1:44:52] part playing a part of a harlot
[1:44:56] she was not a harlot she played a part
[1:44:59] of a harlot to make the promise come to
[1:45:02] pass and brother Branham says through
[1:45:04] her King David into David came Jesus
[1:45:07] that same limits
[1:45:09] so she played a part of a harlot and
[1:45:12] that very lineage goes through and
[1:45:14] through her comes David and through
[1:45:15] David comes Jesus now this hectare
[1:45:19] God is God is great why would Jesus
[1:45:22] eventually
[1:45:23] want a son arise the one which is the
[1:45:28] savior the Conqueror why would he arise
[1:45:30] through the limits of an harlot
[1:45:34] brother Branham says it's the Redemption
[1:45:36] he says you were he says here you see he
[1:45:40] said you had no desire to serve God
[1:45:43] you lived in this world the way you are
[1:45:44] living
[1:45:45] you came to the world speaking lies
[1:45:48] Hallelujah let me just read this further
[1:45:50] you came to the world speaking lies but
[1:45:53] he said but you had no power to play in
[1:45:55] it you only put on the garments of
[1:45:59] ahalat
[1:46:00] is you arrange with God before the
[1:46:03] foundation of the world God asked you do
[1:46:06] you want to go and represent me on Earth
[1:46:09] you said yes he asked you what trials do
[1:46:13] you want to have
[1:46:14] brother Branham says every trial that
[1:46:17] you have you pre-arranged it with God
[1:46:22] he says he's a gentleman
[1:46:25] God is a gentleman he asked you but he
[1:46:28] says you see you can't remember now
[1:46:30] because you have amnesia
[1:46:33] way back before there was an atom of the
[1:46:35] molecule he said you and God you were
[1:46:38] sitting and having conversations
[1:46:40] and he says there's a scripture that you
[1:46:42] can pick up when job was sitting on the
[1:46:44] Airship and he was despondent God called
[1:46:48] job one side rejected by his friends and
[1:46:51] his family God God said job come here a
[1:46:54] minute
[1:46:55] he says let me take you before there was
[1:46:58] a world
[1:46:59] he says let me take you before there was
[1:47:02] a world let's go before there was time
[1:47:05] and job was sitting there having been
[1:47:07] feeling sorry feeding all my friends
[1:47:09] looking at the situation I've lost my
[1:47:10] kids I've lost this he said job where
[1:47:14] were you
[1:47:16] so God
[1:47:17] has brought you into a space of time and
[1:47:20] you forgot that you were up there so God
[1:47:23] allows grace and mercy by the message of
[1:47:26] the hour to come our way
[1:47:28] so by the message of the day God asks
[1:47:32] you the question when you read something
[1:47:34] in the message of the hour all of a
[1:47:36] sudden you say you you feel wow it's
[1:47:38] like an angel was it I never saw this I
[1:47:40] never saw this wow wow is this what
[1:47:43] heaven is about you all of a sudden you
[1:47:45] realize wow I said oh you are always a
[1:47:48] Son of God you are always a daughter of
[1:47:50] God and God wow is this and now he says
[1:47:53] you see what he's doing you're sitting
[1:47:54] on the Airship he's telling you where
[1:47:56] will you drop in job said he said job
[1:47:59] where were you when the star sung and
[1:48:02] the sons of God shouted for Joy all of a
[1:48:05] sudden job realized but I was one of
[1:48:06] them that shouted God stuck his Amnesia
[1:48:09] away and it was all done for job brother
[1:48:11] Branham says one day
[1:48:13] one day you will realize
[1:48:17] that the god that you serve is not out
[1:48:19] there it's not in heaven he's not in
[1:48:22] clouds somewhere you will realize one
[1:48:26] day now he said it it was the same one
[1:48:29] that said to that little girl he was the
[1:48:31] same one that made a prophecy he's the
[1:48:33] same one it prophesied us and it came to
[1:48:34] to pass now he said the same thing he
[1:48:36] said one day you will realize
[1:48:39] that God is in you now he's the same one
[1:48:42] that said in 1933 by Vision there will
[1:48:45] be a car come people will play a little
[1:48:47] game it will be a round saved call we
[1:48:50] all people are now on Facebook they're
[1:48:51] all getting excited about that I said to
[1:48:53] my wife get off Facebook
[1:48:55] now you now you read more the spoken
[1:48:58] word now because they're going to be
[1:49:00] going there and saying yes yes yes we
[1:49:02] have to now go and hide ourselves more
[1:49:04] in the message of tower that is just
[1:49:06] showing you this one of the things but
[1:49:08] that same one that said
[1:49:10] they're that and it comes to pass it's
[1:49:12] the same one that said one day you will
[1:49:15] realize the god that you serve is not a
[1:49:17] god out there
[1:49:19] he's a god inside and he says when you
[1:49:22] realize God is in you he says it will be
[1:49:25] all over for you
[1:49:27] you know there was a man in the Bible
[1:49:28] called Enoch
[1:49:30] now I'll just translate it in Afrikaans
[1:49:32] I preach sometimes you know in South
[1:49:34] Africa I preach the different groups and
[1:49:35] people so there's a man I said I must
[1:49:37] you know in Afrikaans you know so his
[1:49:40] name is Enoch
[1:49:42] so this man
[1:49:45] one day
[1:49:47] because he was the seventh from Adam if
[1:49:49] you go and count
[1:49:51] if you count the different sons and we
[1:49:53] did it with a with the children in the
[1:49:55] in the in the Sunday school lessons
[1:49:58] he was the seventh one from Adam so he
[1:50:01] typed the Bride of the end time he was a
[1:50:04] type of the bride and he was doing his
[1:50:07] farming and he was doing his things and
[1:50:09] one day
[1:50:10] he realized by Revelation that he is a
[1:50:13] type of the Bride
[1:50:15] and he called his wife and he called his
[1:50:18] children
[1:50:19] and he said to them I'm going to take a
[1:50:22] little hope this afternoon
[1:50:23] daddy where are you going he called the
[1:50:25] eldest
[1:50:26] he told him he helped mommy with this
[1:50:28] put that in place put this in place he
[1:50:31] told the daughter you know don't do just
[1:50:33] carry on stay modest dress yourself you
[1:50:36] tell this one do that then he told the
[1:50:38] wife look nice to have like where are
[1:50:40] you going I'm taking a walk this
[1:50:41] afternoon
[1:50:43] and brother Branham says and Enoch hoped
[1:50:46] and as he hoped wherever it was he just
[1:50:49] walked out of his body he just walked
[1:50:51] the one minute he was there in the next
[1:50:53] minute he took a step and he was gone
[1:50:54] but Brandon says that's how simple the
[1:50:56] Reps is going to be
[1:50:58] that's how simple the Rapture is going
[1:51:01] to be we are a people that is called to
[1:51:05] that type of calling when job was
[1:51:07] sitting there he said to himself where
[1:51:10] were you and so realized but I signed a
[1:51:12] contract with God
[1:51:13] I said to him I would want to go down
[1:51:16] and I would want to represent you on
[1:51:18] Earth and that's what each and every one
[1:51:20] of us are doing each and every one and
[1:51:22] you know come and tell you something
[1:51:24] brothers and sisters
[1:51:26] that
[1:51:29] the the trial that you have the test
[1:51:31] that you get on your life things that
[1:51:33] you that come across your life a test
[1:51:34] your husband your wife your at work or
[1:51:36] whatever
[1:51:37] and you you see brother Donny here in
[1:51:40] front
[1:51:41] I'm preaching I have a trial I have a
[1:51:44] taste you have one do you know that I
[1:51:46] will not be able to to stay in the
[1:51:48] artist
[1:51:50] I will not if if whatever comes your way
[1:51:52] no matter who you are it's insignificant
[1:51:54] or small I might never be able to stay
[1:51:56] in your test because your test was given
[1:51:59] for you and God knew before the
[1:52:01] foundation of the world you're the only
[1:52:02] one that can stay in the test
[1:52:04] and he's gave it to you and he knew
[1:52:06] you're going to overcome it and he
[1:52:08] signed a contract up there saying that
[1:52:09] that's your taste and he gave me my
[1:52:11] taste and he says while you're there you
[1:52:13] live a life of a harlot
[1:52:15] you live a life of a sinner you come to
[1:52:18] the world take on a garment you see this
[1:52:20] brother Branham says when you came in by
[1:52:22] birth
[1:52:24] right we were never supposed to be born
[1:52:26] this way that's why do you know when the
[1:52:29] persecution started for brother Brenham
[1:52:32] when brother Branham got the revelation
[1:52:33] of the serpent seed
[1:52:35] when he was when he got the revelation
[1:52:38] of the serpent seed that's when
[1:52:39] everybody started pulling away when he
[1:52:41] started telling people about the serpent
[1:52:43] seed he started telling them that and if
[1:52:46] you listen to brother brother Bo in all
[1:52:48] of them listen they say that's and then
[1:52:50] he told them that that serpent is the
[1:52:52] son
[1:52:54] sorry Kane is the son of the serpent ah
[1:52:58] how can it be it can't be and my brother
[1:53:00] Branham started and then people what is
[1:53:02] this man but you know why that's the key
[1:53:04] that's the link just is Satan brother
[1:53:07] Branham says he cannot create God can
[1:53:10] create so he created us he brought us
[1:53:13] forth from the dust of the earth
[1:53:14] Hallelujah and he says Satan could not
[1:53:17] create so he has to take something that
[1:53:19] is already created so he was waiting for
[1:53:22] for that body to come because he was
[1:53:25] also there were certain things we must
[1:53:27] remember he was way way way back there
[1:53:30] he was the angel that led he was the
[1:53:33] chorus leader he led the Angels In
[1:53:35] Worship
[1:53:36] right he laid the Angels In Worship so
[1:53:38] he was that was before the before the
[1:53:40] creation of the earth and all that they
[1:53:42] were worshiping up there they were
[1:53:43] angels and xerophones and cerebrums and
[1:53:45] Satan was one of them he was one of the
[1:53:46] main Angels leading the Angels into
[1:53:49] worship
[1:53:50] but then the same thing that happened
[1:53:52] with Joseph his brothers became jealous
[1:53:56] of him right his brothers became jealous
[1:53:59] and brother Branham says why did Joseph
[1:54:01] end up in Egypt because of jealousy
[1:54:04] spiritual jealousy because he could
[1:54:07] actually see dreams and they could not
[1:54:09] now this comes from way back there if
[1:54:11] you trace it when he was there he said I
[1:54:15] will exalt myself above God he wanted to
[1:54:19] exalt himself Lucifer he wanted to be
[1:54:22] greater than God he wanted to be higher
[1:54:24] than God so the serpent and that's why
[1:54:26] brother Branham he picked up that's
[1:54:29] where he come but he could not create he
[1:54:31] could not create but he had part of the
[1:54:33] plane of God was already made known part
[1:54:36] of the plan God did not tell him all the
[1:54:39] plan he was sitting there he was
[1:54:41] listening when God showed him this and
[1:54:43] God said so he knew oh you're going to
[1:54:45] go to that planet you see the stars the
[1:54:47] galaxies there's many planets the Bible
[1:54:49] says that Satan he was walking on the
[1:54:52] coals of the earth while it was so hot
[1:54:54] in new this planet not go to Mars not go
[1:54:57] to Jupiter he knew this planet he knew
[1:54:59] the plan but they were certain the Bible
[1:55:01] says the hidden things of God belonged
[1:55:04] to God he hided away the mystery part
[1:55:08] the Revelation stands seven the things
[1:55:11] that brother Branham came to bring God
[1:55:13] hid it away he never knew God only said
[1:55:15] certain things and he went and that's
[1:55:18] why he knew he was going to come here he
[1:55:20] knew he said he was going to manifest
[1:55:22] himself in place he was waiting there
[1:55:23] Adam came he could not go to Adam he
[1:55:27] could not go to the animals who created
[1:55:28] in the image of God and he could not
[1:55:30] deceive the man he was waiting for the
[1:55:32] female and if you follow the pattern of
[1:55:35] God
[1:55:36] everything in the Bible is perfect
[1:55:40] God created everything the Bible says
[1:55:43] and God rested on the seventh day and
[1:55:46] then Genesis 2 7 that was after God
[1:55:49] rests so after the seventh day God is
[1:55:52] particularly in everything that he does
[1:55:54] he rested now everything is done and now
[1:55:58] we form the man from the dust of the
[1:56:01] earth and Genesis 2 7 when God formed
[1:56:05] the man from the dust of the Earth
[1:56:07] then man was walking about and Genesis 1
[1:56:12] 26 27 28. that was built in male and
[1:56:16] female created them so inside of Adam
[1:56:19] was both a feminine and a masculine part
[1:56:23] locked up inside of Adam was his
[1:56:26] feminine spirit and his masculine Spirit
[1:56:28] was locked up inside of him
[1:56:31] you're getting the picture of Satan's
[1:56:33] Eden
[1:56:34] you see why in this hour in this day you
[1:56:37] saw you see so many males wanting to be
[1:56:39] female so many females wanting to be
[1:56:42] males because Satan's Eden is trying to
[1:56:45] copy what God did back there
[1:56:47] but Adam did not behave like a female he
[1:56:50] just heard the spirit of the feminine
[1:56:52] part locked up in him but just that
[1:56:55] you're seeing today it's a perversion
[1:56:57] Satan is telling God you think you're
[1:57:00] the only one that can bring both Spirits
[1:57:03] into one body answer you I'll do it and
[1:57:05] he crosses a man and the man starts
[1:57:07] saving him he's got muscles but he's
[1:57:09] saved in his long hand or his legs look
[1:57:10] so stupid
[1:57:12] right but you see you know what that is
[1:57:15] it is a reproach back to God to say you
[1:57:17] think you're the only one that can
[1:57:18] create an Eden you see when Satan comes
[1:57:21] and he does things he cannot create the
[1:57:24] perverts so he takes that boy he takes
[1:57:27] that girl he takes whatever and he needs
[1:57:29] a body he grabs a hold of him
[1:57:32] Hallelujah because he can't create
[1:57:34] and he's only sowing God you think he's
[1:57:37] the only one and that's why in this day
[1:57:39] brother brilliant preaches a sermon
[1:57:40] called Satan's Eden he says finally
[1:57:44] finally he also had his six thousand
[1:57:48] years he's six days finally he's also
[1:57:52] got his own Eden
[1:57:54] so now you must remember how dark the
[1:57:56] world is
[1:57:57] if he took six thousand years you know
[1:58:00] he was bad in the first AIDS you know he
[1:58:03] was bad but now he's telling God you see
[1:58:05] I have my own Eden that's why brother
[1:58:08] Branham says in the last third age when
[1:58:10] he looked there was no more light it was
[1:58:12] complete darkness Satan was a reigning
[1:58:15] Supreme
[1:58:16] right you see how the people are dressed
[1:58:19] you see how the females are dressing you
[1:58:21] see there's no more morality you see how
[1:58:24] men you see what's happening Satan's
[1:58:26] Eden he's sowing back to God
[1:58:29] but you see there is a little group
[1:58:31] brother Branham says they are tucked
[1:58:33] away they are hidden away they are the
[1:58:36] Bride of the Lord Jesus Christ out of
[1:58:38] this whole Wellington of 500 000 people
[1:58:42] I don't know how many people as
[1:58:43] believers
[1:58:44] hey of the whole world people are and
[1:58:46] you can see the world is going insane
[1:58:48] but God has got a particular type of
[1:58:51] people that has got prophetic insight
[1:58:56] a special class of people when a prophet
[1:58:59] walks down or sits somewhere see comes
[1:59:02] and she comes to draw water at the well
[1:59:05] wow a harlot
[1:59:07] you came your life was dirty you ate a
[1:59:11] what type of life you only left the
[1:59:15] portals of glory and you put on the robe
[1:59:17] like Tamar brilliant Pizza
[1:59:19] hey we must all get together
[1:59:22] wow I'm never gonna go to Joseph so you
[1:59:25] see she only took on that part
[1:59:28] that's why God interrupted the story of
[1:59:31] Joseph
[1:59:32] he interrupted the story of Joseph
[1:59:34] brother Brennan picks it up he said it's
[1:59:37] a Redemption right there the god sows
[1:59:39] you you see you can't remember it you
[1:59:42] concentrate on on this
[1:59:44] right you you you're looking at the
[1:59:46] flesh you're looking at the body of time
[1:59:49] Hallelujah but you are not uh you are
[1:59:52] not uh a fleshly body
[1:59:55] that's one thing to become Eternal it's
[1:59:57] the other way around
[1:59:59] you are an eternal being that took on a
[2:00:03] body of Flesh it's the other way around
[2:00:04] you are not striving every day God
[2:00:07] please let me not die I want to love
[2:00:09] Eternal no you don't have to pray like
[2:00:10] that
[2:00:11] you don't have to you already that
[2:00:14] Circle that we had on the last time you
[2:00:16] are already brother Brandon preach on it
[2:00:18] in things that are to be and nobody had
[2:00:20] not and different things it's a place as
[2:00:22] he preached on it he says you are
[2:00:23] already Eternal Eternal he's got no into
[2:00:25] it it's a circle there's no starting
[2:00:26] into it
[2:00:28] but all you did you by God's grace and
[2:00:32] God's mercy you gave God permission to
[2:00:35] say take me out of this eternal realm
[2:00:38] and drop me in a body of time I want to
[2:00:41] go and represent you in a body of time
[2:00:44] and one day when the portals of Glory
[2:00:47] open up and you hook up the steps
[2:00:49] brother Branham says he says the angels
[2:00:52] that know no sin
[2:00:54] the angels of this never sinned it has
[2:00:57] never gone to do maybe what we think bad
[2:00:59] things or whatever that angel will have
[2:01:02] to hang his head like this
[2:01:04] you will have to hang in and he has to
[2:01:06] give obedience to you he has to give
[2:01:08] obedience unto you as you hope the
[2:01:11] portals of Glory
[2:01:12] he says you took on the body you became
[2:01:16] lost and you were found again that angel
[2:01:19] never be was lost and was never found he
[2:01:22] says that angel while you sing there you
[2:01:24] come up I Am Redeemed by love divine
[2:01:28] Glory Glory Christ is mine yes you hope
[2:01:31] they as you sing the different songs of
[2:01:33] the redeemed whatever song of the redeem
[2:01:36] you are singing Hallelujah I am redeemed
[2:01:38] I'm redeemed different songs that you
[2:01:40] sing as you walk up he says the Angels
[2:01:42] cannot join in your song let Angel will
[2:01:45] have to take some of them have wings
[2:01:47] some of them don't have wings
[2:01:49] some of them standing as you walk back
[2:01:51] to portals they will have to walk back
[2:01:54] here comes the Son of God here comes the
[2:01:58] daughter of God blood was by the lamb
[2:02:01] himself Redeemed by him himself it is it
[2:02:04] is beyond what we can ever think of we
[2:02:07] spend a lot of time with things that's
[2:02:09] that's that's that's carnal as we said
[2:02:12] the circle the last time brother Branham
[2:02:14] through a very big circle and in they
[2:02:16] interjected and he made a little hickey
[2:02:18] and he says that hickey connects back
[2:02:20] with the Eternal Circle so we spend so
[2:02:23] much time with this little hickey that
[2:02:25] is 40 years or 40 years
[2:02:27] that's why I was listening to the
[2:02:30] testimony brother I'm listening to the
[2:02:32] testimony of of brother Billy Paul he
[2:02:34] said you know what
[2:02:36] that he was a poor man
[2:02:39] that he was a poor man
[2:02:43] he says did he spend all his time in
[2:02:45] prayer
[2:02:47] he spent all his time in prayer what you
[2:02:51] spend all his time trying to serve the
[2:02:53] people of God he spent all his time
[2:02:55] trying to do things for the people of
[2:02:57] God
[2:02:59] Hallelujah he says here
[2:03:02] let me read this for you Revelation
[2:03:03] series
[2:03:07] you have to have spiritual understanding
[2:03:11] this is in the Revelation series chapter
[2:03:13] four three
[2:03:15] remember God never did and never will on
[2:03:20] this Earth dwell in glamor
[2:03:23] so so
[2:03:25] can we read the quote further yes he's
[2:03:28] against it that's what a prophet says
[2:03:31] glamorous things
[2:03:33] golden signs around the neck looking
[2:03:36] like the black American rapper
[2:03:40] you you don't put that profile you are a
[2:03:43] son and a daughter of God you conduct
[2:03:45] yourself like one and if they ask you
[2:03:47] why do you do that you say but I'm not
[2:03:50] an American
[2:03:51] relates that we've read it many times he
[2:03:54] told his wife we are not American
[2:03:56] but the daddy Rebecca says that he
[2:03:58] doesn't that but I believe says no we
[2:04:00] are not Americans
[2:04:02] we are Christians
[2:04:04] we come from Beyond the curtain of time
[2:04:08] Hallelujah so so so you we we we're not
[2:04:11] we're not new zealanders or South Africa
[2:04:12] we come beyond the certain of time our
[2:04:15] life trying to do yes buy your potatoes
[2:04:18] buy do your job that's not it that's not
[2:04:20] you know we are from Beyond he said we
[2:04:23] are not American
[2:04:24] we drive a car like he does a car we do
[2:04:28] it to the honor and glory of God not to
[2:04:30] spin wheels
[2:04:31] not to buy it to break and so you just
[2:04:34] do it because it's the means is there
[2:04:35] otherwise you'll have to walk and it
[2:04:36] will take you a few days to get to the
[2:04:38] church so God has made the technology
[2:04:40] available so we use it but as soon as it
[2:04:42] becomes a stumbling block walk away from
[2:04:44] it if anything becomes a stumbling block
[2:04:47] the Bible says if your arm Jesus said to
[2:04:49] them if your arm is a stumbling block to
[2:04:51] you cut it off he says if your eye is a
[2:04:53] stumbling block cut it out and people
[2:04:56] think oh must I not cut my arm off it
[2:04:59] means the things that happens in your
[2:05:02] life it symbols things that you see
[2:05:04] that's upsetting you things that's
[2:05:06] causing you not to love the life that
[2:05:08] you suit things that's causing you not
[2:05:10] to be able to read your Bible things
[2:05:11] that's causing you not to be able to go
[2:05:13] in the message if anything becomes a
[2:05:15] stumbling block leave it alone if the
[2:05:17] magazine that you buy although it's
[2:05:19] cookbooks or whatever leave it alone if
[2:05:20] you don't have time anymore for the word
[2:05:22] if this is a problem that's a problem
[2:05:24] you know nowadays people are on Facebook
[2:05:25] all of that they they take so much time
[2:05:28] for that that's fine I don't have
[2:05:30] anything but if your arm starts becoming
[2:05:32] a problem Chop It Off
[2:05:34] take it get rid of it close your
[2:05:37] Facebook account say let me rather
[2:05:39] listen to a sermon you'll see what will
[2:05:41] happen in your life
[2:05:42] you will see how spiritually you will
[2:05:46] just be able to have Victory and just
[2:05:48] grow in a different dimension
[2:05:51] he is against it the great messages will
[2:05:55] never be says here I don't do that way
[2:05:57] his servants don't work in that manner
[2:05:59] his glamor and glory is of above
[2:06:03] yesterday
[2:06:04] two days ago
[2:06:06] yeah to Kentucky up in Kentucky with my
[2:06:09] good friend brother bankswoods there was
[2:06:12] a woman a policeman woman
[2:06:15] it's fine standing all this he said and
[2:06:19] he said boy we better slow down say
[2:06:21] she's rough that's brother banquet's
[2:06:22] telling brother
[2:06:23] and I said yeah that's right I said
[2:06:26] random Mason gets to a
[2:06:29] million
[2:06:30] employed and they have to have to make
[2:06:33] women make policemen and make them out
[2:06:35] there and put them out there stay in
[2:06:37] them Aldi and cab drivers and things
[2:06:40] like that it's one of the great stains
[2:06:43] of our nation it's a stain on our nation
[2:06:46] a sting like a beautiful white dress and
[2:06:49] there's a stain on it this is the stain
[2:06:52] of our nation
[2:06:53] because brother Branham said you see
[2:06:56] brother Branham when he speaks when a
[2:06:57] prophet says something
[2:06:58] he doesn't he never makes a mistake
[2:07:01] a prophet never makes a mistake
[2:07:04] never
[2:07:06] a prophet never makes a mistake when he
[2:07:09] preached the sermon those of meeting his
[2:07:10] brethren
[2:07:12] brother Brennan preach the sermons those
[2:07:13] of meeting his Brethren which one I
[2:07:15] don't know if I was meeting his brother
[2:07:18] when he preach the sermons those are
[2:07:19] meeting his brethren
[2:07:22] I read it a few times how many times
[2:07:27] ammonia sitting and reading
[2:07:29] and a week without because I've been
[2:07:30] busy with it for a while
[2:07:34] random C
[2:07:35] why did Brother Branham say
[2:07:41] ing
[2:07:43] then it gives them the scripture
[2:07:46] then he says
[2:07:50] did I tell you what chapter it was
[2:07:54] it's Genesis I believe
[2:07:57] I've seen I've seen Genesis 37.
[2:08:00] and beginning with the 15th verse
[2:08:05] and you mark it now I believe
[2:08:08] I said now when he spoke when brother
[2:08:12] Branham spoke
[2:08:14] right when he spoke here I'm just trying
[2:08:16] to get it for you quickly when he said
[2:08:18] to them yep
[2:08:19] paragraph 47.
[2:08:23] brother Branham comes in episode things
[2:08:26] Saturday morning early
[2:08:28] a prophet never makes a mistake
[2:08:33] never does he make a mistake when I went
[2:08:35] back and read it
[2:08:37] I almost allowed almost
[2:08:40] I said Lord now you take me immediately
[2:08:43] prophets do not he's introducing the
[2:08:46] scripture
[2:08:47] now he says here we want to turn over in
[2:08:51] the book The Old book
[2:08:54] the first book
[2:08:56] Genesis 35
[2:08:58] and we wish to read just a little
[2:09:00] portion of the scriptures here out of
[2:09:02] the Book of Genesis and we pray that God
[2:09:05] will richly Aid his Blessing as a
[2:09:07] background of something and how many
[2:09:09] like Sunday school now he gave the
[2:09:11] scripture now he starts talking it's
[2:09:13] just giving the people time
[2:09:16] giving the people time to find the
[2:09:18] scripture
[2:09:19] so he's talking from here he's talking
[2:09:22] he's even going over
[2:09:25] and he's even singing a song
[2:09:29] they come from the East and West they
[2:09:32] come from the lands of our brother Brad
[2:09:35] I'm singing a song and he's scaring on
[2:09:38] and he's doing and then he starts and he
[2:09:40] says oh yes let's get into the 15th
[2:09:43] verse
[2:09:44] and when he reads
[2:09:46] he reads Genesis 37 verse 15.
[2:09:51] so some people in the audience were
[2:09:53] sitting with 35.
[2:09:55] and he reads
[2:09:57] verse now you can open your Bibles in
[2:10:00] Genesis 35 because we've read Genesis
[2:10:02] 37.
[2:10:04] he's just a prophet just said 35 and he
[2:10:07] turns his Bible into 37 and he reads 37.
[2:10:11] and it's it's under the anointings
[2:10:17] never makes a mistake he was called by
[2:10:18] an Angel
[2:10:20] I said to my wife the Abomination that
[2:10:22] make a desolation brother Branham
[2:10:24] preaches in the Seal's book brother
[2:10:27] preaches there now the Abomination that
[2:10:29] make a desolation we know about it Jesus
[2:10:32] spoke about it he's taking picking up
[2:10:34] Matthew 24 speaking of the end time
[2:10:36] where we are in now the power of the
[2:10:38] Abomination that make a desolation when
[2:10:40] they will turn against the Jews and all
[2:10:42] that and we know about that brother
[2:10:44] Branham stops and he says oh I see the
[2:10:47] Muslims of Umar I see the Muslim of Umar
[2:10:50] oh look at their filthiness they are so
[2:10:52] filthy thinking we told my wife the
[2:10:55] other day yesterday look at brother
[2:10:58] Branham he says the Muslims it's he
[2:11:01] refers to the mosque of Umar because the
[2:11:03] mosque is standing where the Temple of
[2:11:05] Solomon is I know I grew up amongst
[2:11:07] Muslims so I know about it
[2:11:10] this is the Muslim of Umar and the next
[2:11:13] thing brother Branham goes over and he
[2:11:15] says look how faulty they are the
[2:11:16] faultiness the Abomination that make a
[2:11:19] desolation the fourthiness
[2:11:47] you see now only when they crossed over
[2:11:51] and they're going to live in other
[2:11:52] countries now the people say they're
[2:11:54] raping their daughters they're having a
[2:11:55] homosexual action but they are Muslims
[2:11:58] brother Brethren they under the
[2:11:59] anointing says the faultiness prophets
[2:12:02] never make mistakes
[2:12:03] never make mistakes so let's go let's
[2:12:06] see this look at how beautiful this is
[2:12:09] brother Branham said that scripture he
[2:12:11] reads the one that we read then it comes
[2:12:14] in this quote and he says oh Genesis I
[2:12:18] believe I believe I see I've seen
[2:12:20] Genesis 37 the beginning the 15th verse
[2:12:24] and you mark did I say 35
[2:12:27] is asking
[2:12:30] he read the scripture he said 35
[2:12:32] he read 37 and then afterwards he says
[2:12:35] did I say 35
[2:12:37] a while ago I had two pages that stuck
[2:12:41] together
[2:12:43] there was another time that two pages
[2:12:44] were stuck together brother Venom
[2:12:46] preacher choosing of a bride
[2:12:48] and a priest came and handed him a book
[2:12:50] brother Bradham says in this sermon here
[2:12:53] in this sermon brother says this portion
[2:12:56] of scripture that I will read to you
[2:13:00] this portion of scripture I'll get a
[2:13:02] quote for you now
[2:13:04] so
[2:13:07] he does not make a mistake never
[2:13:09] brother Branham wanted to go over to
[2:13:12] Israel with a gift to show them the
[2:13:14] prophetic gift of being able to discern
[2:13:17] the heart
[2:13:18] and brother Brenham says oh if Israel
[2:13:20] sees that they will repent in one day
[2:13:21] because they believe a prophet they know
[2:13:23] brother Branham is standing at Cairo
[2:13:25] Airport he's got a ticket in his hand
[2:13:27] he's ready to board the plane to go fly
[2:13:29] over right into Israel he was going
[2:13:31] there and that everything is arranged
[2:13:33] for him to go to the stadiums and to go
[2:13:35] and do the discernment
[2:13:38] Israel will repainting one day the Bible
[2:13:40] says that wow brother Branham is
[2:13:43] standing at the airport
[2:13:44] the angel came to him and he said You
[2:13:47] Heard a Voice said he's standing at the
[2:13:49] airport he said this is not yet the hour
[2:13:52] brother he's looking around he says is
[2:13:54] somebody talking to me now
[2:13:56] then you heard the voice saying again
[2:13:58] this is not yet the hour
[2:14:02] so you you must remember when God moves
[2:14:05] over into Israel Gentile days is done
[2:14:08] so so so look at the anointing on the
[2:14:11] prophet which is Eliza so that same
[2:14:14] Prophet is going to raise there he's
[2:14:16] he's under the anointing and Elijah says
[2:14:18] I must go over and I just stopped him
[2:14:20] there's still some that must come in
[2:14:23] otherwise it's gone it's finished it's I
[2:14:25] think about for the Gentiles
[2:14:27] brothers and sister you you you realize
[2:14:29] God God actually kept a little window
[2:14:32] open for us
[2:14:35] he kept the window open because if he
[2:14:38] goes over to the Jews he never deals
[2:14:40] whether it says God never deals with the
[2:14:42] Jews and the Gentiles at the same time
[2:14:45] Hallelujah he never deals with them at
[2:14:48] the same time when you know the story of
[2:14:52] Joseph
[2:14:53] whoa this is remarkable that's the
[2:14:55] another place where the pages was stuck
[2:14:58] when I saw this Saturday morning
[2:15:00] whoa
[2:15:02] brother Brahm look at what brother
[2:15:04] Branham says about the scripture that
[2:15:06] we've read
[2:15:07] he says here
[2:15:11] I just need to find it so you pray for
[2:15:13] me
[2:15:14] I trusted you you're really blessed by
[2:15:16] the word this morning
[2:15:17] amen
[2:15:19] Hallelujah I trusted you are blessed
[2:15:22] everything according to God's plan and
[2:15:25] God's purpose
[2:15:26] everything
[2:15:28] Hallelujah
[2:15:30] amen God maybe just want to have the the
[2:15:33] just to tone it down a little bit is to
[2:15:36] be winding up
[2:15:37] as you're winding up yep here we got it
[2:15:43] now therefore
[2:15:46] so it's now a few pages later on now
[2:15:48] therefore
[2:15:49] on the word it's beautiful now we are
[2:15:53] faced this morning we got before us he
[2:15:56] says here under consideration
[2:16:00] to my opinion
[2:16:03] we've got before us under consideration
[2:16:06] to my opinion
[2:16:09] one of the most vital texts of the Old
[2:16:12] Testament Joseph
[2:16:15] we're going to speak on meeting his
[2:16:17] brethren
[2:16:19] there could be a hundred different ways
[2:16:22] that the Holy Spirit get into this and
[2:16:25] unfold it to our hearts and our minds
[2:16:29] Hallelujah he says here how did God in
[2:16:33] his omnipotence in his great infinite
[2:16:37] mind seeing something fixing to happen
[2:16:41] he can forewarn
[2:16:44] he can make everything work together
[2:16:47] even the wrath of man to praise him even
[2:16:53] someone who treats you evil
[2:16:56] so he combines those two because his
[2:16:59] brothers treated him evil
[2:17:01] right and he says with God before us one
[2:17:05] of the greatest texts in the Old
[2:17:07] Testament
[2:17:09] brother Branham you see
[2:17:15] we'll go back to Judah and tomatoes now
[2:17:21] Joseph
[2:17:24] he perfectly types Christ
[2:17:27] Abraham was Faith this one was that
[2:17:30] partake of types Christ his first coming
[2:17:34] his second coming rejected by his
[2:17:37] Brethren and sacrificed brought before
[2:17:40] the Father the coat of many colors
[2:17:43] Jesus Christ thinking now I have you now
[2:17:48] you are nailed to the cross now I have
[2:17:51] you when he did it who did it where did
[2:17:55] you get the scars in your hands brother
[2:17:56] Bradham says brother Brenham says when
[2:17:59] Jesus is going to go the Messiah when he
[2:18:02] goes to the Jews
[2:18:04] when he goes to the Jews now there's a
[2:18:06] script in the book of Zechariah
[2:18:08] Zechariah Chapter 12.
[2:18:10] right I'm jumping all over this morning
[2:18:12] if you read Zechariah Chapter 12.

[2:18:16] just open your books in Zechariah I'll
[2:18:18] show you there
[2:18:20] that really stands in front of them
[2:18:23] he's making himself known to the Jews
[2:18:27] he's making himself known now to the
[2:18:29] Jews
[2:18:31] Joseph we all know Joseph appeared to
[2:18:33] his brothers we'll close with that part
[2:18:36] so it's it's it's it's it's it's just
[2:18:39] tremendous it's just wonderful the
[2:18:42] blessings of the Lord that maketh rich
[2:18:43] and that adds no sorrow
[2:18:47] this this characters they play the
[2:18:49] character you think that that Joseph was
[2:18:51] he no it was Redemption brother Branham
[2:18:53] says it was Redemption being played out
[2:18:57] Hallelujah Zechariah Chapter 12 and some
[2:19:00] of you might be getting excited already

[2:23:05] upon the inhabitants of Jerusalem the
[2:23:06] spirit of Grace and of Supplication

[2:23:23] they ask where did you get the scars and
[2:23:26] brother Branham tells them brother
[2:23:28] Brennan says Jesus tells them I got
[2:23:30] these scars in the house of my friends
[2:23:35] Bible says
[2:23:37] when they realize that it was them they
[2:23:41] discuss the scars of the Messiah
[2:23:45] they will all go in mourning and the
[2:23:49] whole land of the of
[2:23:51] now
[2:23:52] those are Benjamin that's little
[2:23:54] Benjamin
[2:23:56] right

[2:23:59] mourning for what they have done
[2:24:01] and the whole of Israel will be saved in
[2:24:05] one day
[2:24:06] he says he can take thousands of years
[2:24:09] with the Gentiles with the Jews they
[2:24:11] will that's why if you read the Bible
[2:24:12] says in that day indeed brother says in
[2:24:15] one day Israel will come to repentance
[2:24:17] in one day just like that and they where
[2:24:20] did you get those Stars I got these
[2:24:22] scars in the house of my friends
[2:24:25] your house of your friend is a place
[2:24:27] where you go when you are distressed a
[2:24:30] house of your friend is a place where
[2:24:31] you go where you said a house of your
[2:24:34] friend is a place where you go with this
[2:24:37] with this where there's a little Solace

[2:24:46] that's what you do when you go to the
[2:24:47] house of your friend yeah he's standing
[2:24:49] in front of them he says I got these
[2:24:51] scars

[2:24:58] home I lost my business I lost my house
[2:25:01] my friend I can knock on his door That's
[2:25:03] What Friends Are and when he says but he
[2:25:06] says but what did what did he do he says
[2:25:09] they were blinded
[2:25:11] the brothers of Joseph in their Fierce
[2:25:15] jealousy were blinded so that Joseph
[2:25:17] could go
[2:25:18] and let's go and we close now Genesis 35
[2:25:22] 37 and we'll flip over to 45.
[2:25:26] so I got these scars in the house of my
[2:25:30] friends
[2:25:31] wow
[2:25:33] they will repent in one day
[2:25:35] they are the 144
[2:25:39] 000.
[2:25:39] now while you turn to Denison Dynasty
[2:25:42] seven and we're just busy rounding up
[2:25:45] you all know the history those of you
[2:25:47] that maybe don't know or maybe don't
[2:25:49] know what we're following the message of
[2:25:50] the hour some people somehow means a
[2:25:53] Vietnamese
[2:25:57] World War
[2:26:01] and
[2:26:03] we all know that how Germany Mussolini
[2:26:06] first and then Hitler how he rose up and
[2:26:09] how the sermons rose up
[2:26:11] and how
[2:26:13] there was this hatred towards the Jews
[2:26:17] right and they persecuted the Jews and
[2:26:19] all that
[2:26:21] brother Branham said
[2:26:23] that what happened there
[2:26:26] what happened there
[2:26:28] it was the tender hand of Jehovah
[2:26:32] the the tender hand of Jehovah that was
[2:26:37] gathering little Benjamin from all over
[2:26:41] the corners of the world
[2:26:43] and bringing
[2:26:45] Benjamin Beck
[2:26:47] into the Homeland
[2:26:50] when you have persecution
[2:26:53] when you have things going wrong
[2:26:55] when you have troubles when you have
[2:26:57] trout I was telling my wife yesterday
[2:26:59] it is it is when you have things and you
[2:27:02] don't have money and you don't have this
[2:27:03] and you it's the tender hand of Jehovah
[2:27:11] we we think blessing
[2:27:14] I must have
[2:27:18] blessing I must have
[2:27:21] the then the hand of Jehovah to to make
[2:27:24] sure you don't have
[2:27:26] so that you can go on your knees
[2:27:28] and then a character attribute of faith
[2:27:33] can come out which is the attribute of
[2:27:35] God
[2:27:37] only operates by faith
[2:27:40] God does not operate by my bank account
[2:27:43] or my medical cover or my insurance
[2:27:47] cover God does not operate the moment I
[2:27:51] have something to do with protecting and
[2:27:54] it's not God God is is one that operates
[2:27:58] in the Supernatural Realm
[2:28:00] so so when that persecution came
[2:28:03] Mussolini Adolf Hitler when those Jews
[2:28:06] were burned and taken to the slaughter
[2:28:08] brother Branham says it was the tender
[2:28:11] hand of Jehovah you I I can't explain it
[2:28:15] it's a prophet it said it that was
[2:28:17] taking Jews bringing little Benjamin
[2:28:20] back into the Homeland
[2:28:23] are we closing with little Benjamin 35.
[2:28:27] remember he said 35
[2:28:29] little sermon
[2:28:31] Little Summer this is not big man this
[2:28:33] is not seals a little sermon called
[2:28:36] zones of meeting his brethren
[2:28:38] and in their Pages were stuck together
[2:28:41] on his Bible
[2:28:46] so let's read three five so we pray 37
[2:28:49] which is the one that he intended but he
[2:28:50] said 35 because his Pages were stuck
[2:28:52] together
[2:28:53] and his brothers came did what he did
[2:28:56] now let's go over
[2:28:58] to 37.
[2:29:00] now you see
[2:29:02] there was a special bond
[2:29:04] between Joseph and Benjamin
[2:29:09] right
[2:29:10] Josephine Benjamin had a special bond
[2:29:14] it was a special bond between them
[2:29:16] because they were in the in the flesh
[2:29:18] they had the same mother
[2:29:21] they came from Rachel
[2:29:23] both of them were from the same mother
[2:29:25] but Joseph was born so you had Judah and
[2:29:29] you had different ones and you had
[2:29:30] Reuben and you had all the brothers
[2:29:31] being born and in between Joseph gets
[2:29:34] born and I think they were more born
[2:29:36] after Joseph but little Benjamin was
[2:29:38] born last but Benjamin and Joseph comes
[2:29:42] from the same mother
[2:29:44] right so Benjamin is lost
[2:29:47] right and Joseph and you read it was the
[2:29:50] last born of the twelve right now the
[2:29:53] Bible does not even make a mistake when
[2:29:55] the Bible places the two of them
[2:29:57] together
[2:29:59] when the brother Branham says 35
[2:30:03] I went to go read it I I said whoa
[2:30:07] Lord our time is up when brother Brandon
[2:30:09] preacher the anointing said he wants to
[2:30:10] go oh he said this is not the hour it's
[2:30:13] 50 years later
[2:30:17] let's read and we're busy closing
[2:30:20] the Bible is a marvelous book the
[2:30:23] message of the hour it's it's wonderful
[2:30:26] verse 1 and Jacob dwelled in the land
[2:30:29] wherein his father was a strange in the
[2:30:33] land of Canaan
[2:30:35] these are the generations of Jacob
[2:30:37] those of being 17 years old so when that
[2:30:40] when that happening happened with him
[2:30:42] when they which is just a few chapters
[2:30:44] later on he was 17 years old so also in
[2:30:48] the message circles
[2:30:49] in the message circles the number 17
[2:30:52] the number 17.
[2:30:54] relates to a system chains
[2:30:57] it relates that at 17 when something
[2:31:00] struck 17 God does something
[2:31:02] when samething strikes in your life God
[2:31:04] does something
[2:31:06] when brother Branham baptized
[2:31:08] the
[2:31:09] 17 person on the Ohio River
[2:31:13] now you can you do the maths
[2:31:16] you can do the math
[2:31:18] Revelations 10.
[2:31:21] 17 is always significant to God things
[2:31:25] can happen in your life
[2:31:26] things can happen in your life you can
[2:31:28] struggle
[2:31:29] but somehow the music you know when they
[2:31:32] have the orchestra and they play music
[2:31:34] in the orchestra and then they will boom
[2:31:36] boom it's relating a wall and then and
[2:31:39] when they hit a certain notebook and
[2:31:42] then and you know and the players on the
[2:31:44] stage could do something and all of a
[2:31:45] sudden when it hit a note it changes and
[2:31:48] then you just see there the swan comes
[2:31:49] up and the Swan Lake in the swan is
[2:31:52] changed back to a swan and whatever so
[2:31:54] that happens on a certain note and it
[2:31:56] denotes a change in the system so God
[2:31:59] does things the same way 17 is always
[2:32:02] significant to God
[2:32:04] 17 Joseph is ready
[2:32:07] he's ready to be given up by his
[2:32:09] brothers
[2:32:10] 17 is significant so look at this
[2:32:13] the Bible says and and the Bible does
[2:32:16] not tell you how old is Judah that
[2:32:18] doesn't tell you all these Reuben it
[2:32:20] tells you are all these Joseph
[2:32:22] it says he's 17 years old
[2:32:25] so the Bible itself is an inspired Bible
[2:32:28] Hallelujah
[2:32:30] was feeding the flock with his Brethren
[2:32:32] and the lady was with the sons of
[2:32:35] and with the sons of so far so sorry I'm
[2:32:38] saying it the way the Jews would say it
[2:32:40] because they don't have an eight uh
[2:32:43] yeah so far but so far is the way they
[2:32:46] would say it his father's wives and
[2:32:49] Joseph brought unto his father the evil
[2:32:52] report
[2:32:53] right and now Israel loved those of more
[2:32:56] than all his Brethren because he was the
[2:32:58] son of his old age
[2:33:00] sorry I'm reading 37 myself
[2:33:02] apologies I'm selling 37 I wanted I
[2:33:04] meant to read 35. sorry Genesis 35
[2:33:07] that's what I meant to read
[2:33:10] wow
[2:33:11] I'm into read Genesis 35 sorry verse 15.
[2:33:18] wow that must have been God because I
[2:33:21] didn't mean to speak about how old
[2:33:22] Joseph was I wanted to go straight into
[2:33:24] Joseph into into the spot well
[2:33:27] sure so look at this
[2:33:29] Genesis 35 15. so we read 37 verse 15.
[2:33:33] we back here 35 15. and Jacob called the
[2:33:38] name of the place where God spoke with
[2:33:40] him Beth L
[2:33:43] right
[2:33:44] this is the now my Bible Bible has got
[2:33:47] something in here pet L is the house
[2:33:49] it's in the it's in the god of the house
[2:33:52] of God or it's the house of God Bethel
[2:33:54] that's the meaning of it 16 and they
[2:33:56] Journey from Beth L and they was but a
[2:34:00] little way to come to Israel and Rachel
[2:34:03] travailed so she was in travail and we
[2:34:06] was closing and she had hard labor
[2:34:11] and it came to pass when she was in hard
[2:34:15] labor
[2:34:16] that the Midwife said unto her
[2:34:19] fear not
[2:34:21] Thou shalt have
[2:34:23] this son also
[2:34:26] and it came to pause
[2:34:29] as her soul was departed departing Force
[2:34:34] he died
[2:34:35] that's he called his name Ben Oni
[2:34:41] but his father called him Benjamin
[2:34:46] she's giving birth to Benjamin hard
[2:34:49] labor she's supposedly dying she sets
[2:34:52] out the name of the boy before she dies
[2:34:55] and while she sells out the name of the
[2:34:57] boy
[2:34:58] the father Jacob calls the other name at
[2:35:00] the same time
[2:35:01] he calls Benjamins he calls benoni
[2:35:06] Rachel died
[2:35:08] and was buried in the way of Ephron
[2:35:10] which is Bethlehem
[2:35:13] I'll just stop there because I want to
[2:35:15] just go down to verse 22 in and we'll
[2:35:18] close with Genesis 45.
[2:35:21] C calls the name benoni
[2:35:26] the same time Jacob is under the
[2:35:28] anointing and he calls the name Benjamin
[2:35:35] the name given
[2:35:38] by Rachel
[2:35:40] benoni means a son of Sorrow
[2:35:46] a son of Sorrow
[2:35:49] we see
[2:35:50] we see Israel
[2:35:52] always in the news
[2:35:55] a son of Sorrow
[2:35:57] always they are persecuted
[2:36:00] always they always need this one always
[2:36:03] wants to kill him that one always wants
[2:36:06] to kill them this one always wants to
[2:36:08] kill Israel that one always wanted the
[2:36:10] stroll it's my land
[2:36:11] it's my land you know what brother
[2:36:13] Branham says it's us we Are Spiritual
[2:36:15] Israelites
[2:36:17] sons of Sorrow
[2:36:19] Satan is always after you always after
[2:36:22] your Bloodhound trying to get you
[2:36:24] brother Branham says it's like a
[2:36:25] bloodhound the son of Sorrow always
[2:36:27] trying to destroy you then he's throwing
[2:36:29] this muscle over then he's doing this
[2:36:31] then he Rams a car into a few people
[2:36:33] he's always trying to destroy Israel
[2:36:36] we are the spiritual Israelites always
[2:36:39] something happening with you you got
[2:36:41] Victory Today Tomorrow there's something
[2:36:42] else you're happy in the church today
[2:36:44] tomorrow you have problems son of Sorrow
[2:36:47] see something that out Under The
[2:36:49] Inspirations he dies at the same time
[2:36:51] the inspiration is on Jacob he calls out
[2:36:54] the son of my right hand
[2:36:57] so Benjamin means the son of my right
[2:37:00] hand someone I can depend on sees out
[2:37:02] Ben only one of Sorrow
[2:37:06] that's what we are
[2:37:08] sons of sorrow but also the right hand
[2:37:10] of God once a God can depend on that
[2:37:13] whatever happens no matter if the
[2:37:15] muscles fall that son is going to stand
[2:37:18] then you know the Bible says
[2:37:21] I don't have time I'm closing up
[2:37:24] there was when he was born
[2:37:28] you go read the account
[2:37:30] I'll just read this one and I'll close
[2:37:32] when they wanted to have Benjamin to
[2:37:35] come
[2:37:36] through does it no to this leader he
[2:37:39] said you can't let that sun come
[2:37:43] he said but you said you have another
[2:37:45] brother
[2:37:46] because they they only the 10 of them
[2:37:48] went they said to him and they came in
[2:37:50] front of for in front of Joseph you know
[2:37:53] his dream came true you go read the
[2:37:55] accounting when they had to bow in front
[2:37:57] of him and he said okay and they said
[2:37:59] this dreamer says we're going to bow in
[2:38:00] front of him then he had a second dream
[2:38:02] the moon in the stars the Sun the moon
[2:38:05] and the stars were bowing in front of
[2:38:07] him then his father said to him it
[2:38:08] cannot be you mean mother and father and
[2:38:10] your brothers are going to bow in front
[2:38:12] of you
[2:38:12] 13 years later
[2:38:15] in the process of time
[2:38:17] the vision comes into fulfillment
[2:38:20] reasons cannot fail
[2:38:23] the little boy he saw them falling off
[2:38:25] the bridge 16 years later it happened in
[2:38:28] our lives what does it show us
[2:38:32] God cannot fight if God has got a plan
[2:38:34] for your life it cannot fail brother if
[2:38:37] God sees you going in the Rapture no
[2:38:39] matter what I try and do no matter what
[2:38:42] who tries into you will get into that
[2:38:43] Rapture Hallelujah it will happen and
[2:38:47] they
[2:38:48] just in closing as Jacob was there
[2:38:51] shouting out that name
[2:38:53] giving out that name Benjamin the
[2:38:55] prophet says are named the noun
[2:38:57] character it speaks of the character
[2:38:59] that the person has got when you get a
[2:39:02] particular name it's your character and
[2:39:04] there was a special bond
[2:39:07] between Jacob and Benjamin
[2:39:09] and when they came in front they said
[2:39:12] yes
[2:39:14] yes we told you but surely you cannot
[2:39:18] let the youngest one come
[2:39:22] and he spoke through an interpreter if
[2:39:24] you read the account
[2:39:25] when they came in front of Joseph he
[2:39:28] spoke through an interpreter they never
[2:39:30] knew that that was their brother
[2:39:32] I don't want to go into 42 43 44 you go
[2:39:35] read it
[2:39:36] and he spoke to them through an
[2:39:38] interpreter
[2:39:40] and he said to them go back
[2:39:43] and bring that boy
[2:39:46] and he said okay
[2:39:47] let me keep one of the brothers here
[2:39:49] and then you bring that boy back the
[2:39:51] next time
[2:39:53] brother Branham says what was happening
[2:39:56] those have wanted to sow them who he was
[2:40:00] he wanted to show them that he was his
[2:40:02] brother but he could not reveal it to
[2:40:04] them unless they were all together
[2:40:08] 144 Benjamin Benjamin if you read the
[2:40:11] Bible if you read the way we follow the
[2:40:13] message of the hour for the Brenham in
[2:40:15] different places Benjamin little
[2:40:16] Benjamin refers to the Jews the 144
[2:40:21] 000 a specific number of them A specific
[2:40:24] group of Jews the the Orthodox ones the
[2:40:27] ones that believe the word though those
[2:40:29] ones that return to be back in the
[2:40:31] Homeland that's little Benjamin
[2:40:34] 1948 different between that stages 1946
[2:40:38] 47 48 they were boarding planes they
[2:40:42] were boarding planes they were trying to
[2:40:43] flying over in brother random says what
[2:40:46] was that anointing on them that called
[2:40:48] them from all over the world where they
[2:40:50] were living for hundreds of years
[2:40:52] scattered after that the mosque of of
[2:40:54] after the temple was taken over the Jews
[2:40:57] cattle over the world
[2:40:58] and after 2 000 years after two days I
[2:41:02] will bring you back
[2:41:04] after two days I will bring you back and
[2:41:06] he says and he pulled all of them and
[2:41:08] they started going back
[2:41:10] let me just read this account
[2:41:13] close up with this and then we read the
[2:41:15] last verse and we close verse 22 Genesis
[2:41:18] 35 and it came to pass when Israel dwelt
[2:41:22] in that land this is Jacob name is
[2:41:24] changed to Israel that Reuben went and
[2:41:27] lay with bilar is
[2:41:29] his father's concubine and Israel heard
[2:41:32] now heard it now
[2:41:35] Jacob were 12.
[2:41:38] the sons of Jacob were 12. now look at
[2:41:42] how the Bible records the twelve Sons
[2:41:46] are there certain numbers but the
[2:41:49] Branham speaks of how God works in
[2:41:50] numerology gods and numbers God's
[2:41:53] numbers must tie up God is the perfect
[2:41:55] mathematician he knows how to tie the
[2:41:59] numbers because when the numbers hit
[2:42:00] right that he says the anointing comes
[2:42:03] down
[2:42:04] when the numbers hit right sister Hetty
[2:42:07] right say the right thing
[2:42:09] and said brother Branham that is nothing
[2:42:11] but the truth
[2:42:13] when she said it the anointing came in
[2:42:15] the room
[2:42:16] whatever you want
[2:42:19] twelve Sons
[2:42:20] the sons of Leah now he gives the sons
[2:42:23] now
[2:42:24] we're closing up
[2:42:26] we're closing up brothers and sisters
[2:42:27] now he starts giving the sons the sons
[2:42:30] of Leah Reuben
[2:42:33] Jacob's firstborn
[2:42:35] Simeon
[2:42:37] and Levi
[2:42:39] right Simeon Levi sorry let me go Reuben
[2:42:43] Simeon Levi and Judah and izakah and
[2:42:49] Zebulon
[2:42:51] so we're on six
[2:42:52] so six Sons through Leah
[2:42:55] Bible records him
[2:42:58] now the Bible records the sons coming
[2:43:00] through
[2:43:01] Rachel
[2:43:03] the sons of Rachel Joseph
[2:43:07] take the numbers
[2:43:11] right now when was Benjamin born
[2:43:16] last
[2:43:18] but what does brother Branham say in the
[2:43:20] message of the hour what does eight mean
[2:43:21] eight means eternal
[2:43:24] the Bible records them but now look at
[2:43:27] how the Bible records their birth always
[2:43:28] when the Bible records
[2:43:31] records the different learnings it
[2:43:33] always says the first of the last when
[2:43:35] it recorded this I've come across this
[2:43:37] and I looked in the Bible I can't recall
[2:43:40] anybody else in the Bible when it
[2:43:41] records it like this
[2:43:43] it does not recorded from the first to
[2:43:45] the last it changes the pattern how the
[2:43:48] Bible records the chronology
[2:43:50] the chronological bird it says it tells
[2:43:53] it now according to mother
[2:43:54] and now it says the sons of Rachel
[2:43:58] to those of which were seven now he
[2:44:00] doesn't give you the next one it was
[2:44:02] born because you break the order
[2:44:03] according to the Orthodox system you go
[2:44:06] from the first to the last because the
[2:44:08] blessing is passed on from the first it
[2:44:11] breaks the order according to the Old
[2:44:13] Testament way of writing chronological
[2:44:16] way of writing it but it's perfect
[2:44:18] because
[2:44:19] it says the sons of Rachel Joseph
[2:44:22] seventh
[2:44:24] and Benjamin
[2:44:28] it speaks of when Benjamin comes on the
[2:44:32] scene we strike the number eight
[2:44:36] which is eternal that's why brother
[2:44:38] Branham was suppressed so pressed when
[2:44:41] he's when that anointing came
[2:44:43] Hallelujah because the Jews are back in
[2:44:46] their Homeland
[2:44:47] brother Branham says God is ready to
[2:44:50] move and to work with Israel he cannot
[2:44:53] work with the Gentiles and with Israel
[2:44:55] at the same time
[2:44:57] I'm closing Genesis 45 and this is my
[2:45:00] last verse and we're closing and I trust
[2:45:03] I read a quote what brother Brian says
[2:45:04] in the Revelation series I trusted by
[2:45:07] the word this morning it has just given
[2:45:10] us a a little bit of a of an
[2:45:12] appreciation
[2:45:14] and saying Lord now I want to read my
[2:45:16] Bible I want to read I want to know more
[2:45:17] I want to know more about the message of
[2:45:19] the hour brother Branham says it in the
[2:45:21] Revelation series as well he says I
[2:45:23] trust this morning I've studied and I've
[2:45:25] seen history I trust by what I will
[2:45:27] preach this morning I trust it will
[2:45:29] bring certain answer in your heart that
[2:45:31] you will go and just read your Bible and
[2:45:33] read so so that's what preaching is also
[2:45:35] about you know it helps us but it also
[2:45:37] sort of gets us to drive us back to read
[2:45:40] our Bible so I'm closing with this
[2:45:43] beautiful scene beautiful beautiful
[2:45:45] scene beautiful
[2:45:48] most one of the most beautiful scenes in
[2:45:50] the whole Bible
[2:45:52] one of the most beautiful scenes
[2:45:55] in the whole Bible
[2:45:58] the fathers did not want to let Benjamin
[2:46:01] go
[2:46:03] the father said he will bro bring my
[2:46:05] gray hair down
[2:46:07] you will take me to their grave if you
[2:46:09] take the sun away from me they said
[2:46:11] father
[2:46:12] but if we don't take Benjamin with us
[2:46:15] the master of the house won't give us
[2:46:17] bread
[2:46:18] we will die we have to take him with us
[2:46:21] he says he will bring down my gray
[2:46:24] you will bring down my gray
[2:46:27] and while they were standing in front of
[2:46:29] Joseph
[2:46:30] started making all sorts of funny
[2:46:33] demands telling them go leave the boy
[2:46:36] with me
[2:46:37] you go all of you go he stays here
[2:46:43] let us kill him
[2:46:45] repentance and Judah comes and said oh
[2:46:48] he said to him oh let's read it oh this
[2:46:51] is beautiful brothers and sisters
[2:46:54] oh
[2:46:55] verse 27 44 27.
[2:46:59] and I servant my father said unto us you
[2:47:03] know that my wife bear me two sons
[2:47:06] so he's telling Joseph you can't take
[2:47:08] this boy
[2:47:10] this is coming in and he was the brave
[2:47:12] one that said kill him let's kill him
[2:47:14] let's kill this Dreamer
[2:47:15] he doesn't know who he's speaking to
[2:47:18] he's standing there he doesn't know
[2:47:20] there's a special bond
[2:47:22] there's a special bond between Benjamin
[2:47:25] Netanyahu and Vladimir Putin
[2:47:28] there's a special bond between them I
[2:47:30] didn't know what it was
[2:47:32] a Russian don't cry Russians don't cry
[2:47:36] they are tough they are the toughest
[2:47:37] people you can get
[2:47:39] we saw a picture of of of of Putin
[2:47:42] crying because of what is happening to
[2:47:44] the Jews tears they took a picture of
[2:47:46] him his tears were running
[2:47:48] brother Branham said while that reason
[2:47:50] came
[2:47:51] while the reason came 1933
[2:47:53] some anointing dropped on him something
[2:47:56] special because the vision broken the
[2:47:58] vision said to him what's Russia the
[2:48:02] King of the North what's Russell he ate
[2:48:05] his thirds when he related stand up he
[2:48:07] says what's Russell Watson Ross the King
[2:48:10] of the North he heard it repeat because
[2:48:12] Russia has got a special place in God's
[2:48:14] hand what's the King of the North the
[2:48:17] bay
[2:48:17] special place God uses Russell if you
[2:48:21] mess with Israel she will step in
[2:48:22] there's a special bonding
[2:48:25] you messed with Israel Russia is
[2:48:28] prepared on the other side because they
[2:48:30] cannot say blood
[2:48:32] David
[2:48:33] God said you've said too much blood you
[2:48:36] cannot build me a tabernacle you cannot
[2:48:39] build me a tabernacle you've saved blood
[2:48:41] Solomon will raise up in your Stead
[2:48:44] the pattern of the world cannot be
[2:48:46] broken
[2:48:47] but God will bring judgment with
[2:48:49] judgment is due
[2:48:51] so this is now today is pleading to
[2:48:53] Joseph he says here
[2:48:58] oh it's it's so wonderful I just can't
[2:49:01] seem to close the day but we'll close in
[2:49:03] the next minute or two
[2:49:04] hallelujah it's just so wonderful this
[2:49:06] is a this is one of the most beautiful
[2:49:08] Parts because it is it is the first
[2:49:10] coming of the Lord
[2:49:12] India and the second coming he was
[2:49:15] already in the pit
[2:49:16] that was the first coming
[2:49:18] this is the second coming playing out
[2:49:20] this is the second coming because it's
[2:49:22] the ministry this is the time that we
[2:49:24] are in
[2:49:25] he meets his brothers three times
[2:49:28] cow out
[2:49:29] what Seekers you I'm just looking for my
[2:49:32] brethren brother Branham says you never
[2:49:35] look for God God always look for you his
[2:49:38] brothers after they did what they did to
[2:49:40] him they were never looking for him the
[2:49:42] second time they came that came in front
[2:49:44] of him they came in front of him they
[2:49:46] did not recognize him but they were
[2:49:48] looking for food
[2:49:49] this is the third time they came back in
[2:49:51] front of him
[2:49:52] right and he's telling them now
[2:49:55] thy servant my father said unto us
[2:49:58] ye know
[2:50:00] that my wife pay me two sons
[2:50:03] and the one went out from me and I said
[2:50:05] surely he is torn in pieces and I saw
[2:50:09] him nonsense
[2:50:11] I told Judah is not pleading to Joseph
[2:50:14] he's telling now Joseph you can't do
[2:50:16] this what you want to do
[2:50:18] in the he says here and ye and if you
[2:50:21] take this also from me
[2:50:24] and must have befall him
[2:50:27] he shall bring down my gray hairs would
[2:50:30] sorrow to the Grave this is what Jacob
[2:50:33] said when they sit let Benjamin go now
[2:50:35] and he said Benjamin stays here you can
[2:50:37] go back this this man is making funny
[2:50:39] demands now
[2:50:41] right this is playing a part out
[2:50:45] there's a special bond because all the
[2:50:47] time when the brothers came if you read
[2:50:48] you always ask them always ask them
[2:50:51] bring that boy bring that Benjamin bring
[2:50:53] that one

[2:51:04] life is bound up in the LEDs of life if
[2:51:08] I go back to my father and he's not with
[2:51:10] us benzem he's not with us
[2:51:12] his life the father's life is bound up
[2:51:15] in his life God and the Jews are linked
[2:51:18] together who I bless no man can curse
[2:51:21] and bound to Israel who can pluck out of
[2:51:24] my hand
[2:51:25] this is look at this yeah you see it's
[2:51:27] the same thing he says the Lord's life
[2:51:30] is bound in the father's life Jacob and
[2:51:32] Benjamin is bound together brothers and
[2:51:35] sisters
[2:51:36] this world has got the best arms and
[2:51:39] bombs
[2:51:41] they are being funded by Rome America
[2:51:44] has got all even America is going to
[2:51:46] turn against Israel all of them will
[2:51:48] turn against Israel you see even America
[2:51:51] is going to turn against Israel wanting
[2:51:53] to blast them from the face of the Earth
[2:51:55] and God said who can plug them out of my
[2:51:58] hand
[2:51:59] Hallelujah my life is bound up in the
[2:52:02] last life
[2:52:03] there's something about the people the
[2:52:06] syrians and that they wanted that if you
[2:52:08] read the articles if you read the
[2:52:09] account brother and he puts a lot of it
[2:52:11] on they want to blast Israel of the
[2:52:13] earth they sit in such a small country
[2:52:15] let's just blast them off
[2:52:18] brother they cannot do that our life our
[2:52:21] life is bound in the father's life no
[2:52:24] matter what Satan tries to do this
[2:52:26] morning you can have a cancer you can
[2:52:28] cry what your life is bound in the
[2:52:31] father's life
[2:52:32] Hallelujah
[2:52:34] it shall come to pass when he's here
[2:52:37] that the Lord is not with us that he
[2:52:39] will die and thy servants shall bring
[2:52:42] down the grace of thyself of the gray
[2:52:45] hairs of thy servant our father would
[2:52:47] sorrow to the Grave
[2:52:49] for thy servant became Surety for the
[2:52:52] land unto my father saying if I bring
[2:52:54] him not now this is Judah speaking he's
[2:52:56] saying I'm not standing in for him and
[2:52:58] here's those of knowing it was you that
[2:53:01] threw me in the put
[2:53:02] yeah he says I say to the father he's
[2:53:06] seeing now the heart of Judah was sins
[2:53:09] oh
[2:53:10] don't worry
[2:53:12] brother Bradham says they will sweep out
[2:53:14] very nice spirit upon the bride at the
[2:53:16] end time
[2:53:17] they will sweep a beautiful spirit on us
[2:53:19] brothers and sisters but he says there
[2:53:21] will be a love that will come amongst
[2:53:23] the bride God will sow Miracles brother
[2:53:28] Branham says yo yo yo your brother your
[2:53:30] sister that's one will come to you and
[2:53:32] says I'm a farmer he says I don't have
[2:53:34] rain he said you will speak in the rain
[2:53:36] will fall it happened in the days of
[2:53:38] Eliza he says there were people will
[2:53:40] come to you and you will speak and lumps
[2:53:42] will grow back somebody that doesn't
[2:53:44] have a lake you will speak and that limb
[2:53:46] will grow back somebody that doesn't
[2:53:48] have eyes what brother Branham did I
[2:53:50] believe and I believe it's not far it's
[2:53:52] right now if you ever need this morning
[2:53:54] when we finish here we will pray and we
[2:53:57] will believe God will answer every need
[2:54:01] don't put God off over there that was
[2:54:03] the difference with brother Branham
[2:54:04] that's I believe when we go into prayer
[2:54:07] and supplication it takes something
[2:54:09] that's far and it makes up the right
[2:54:11] here Hallelujah it puts it right here
[2:54:14] today brother Branham police said he was
[2:54:16] laying there but he said I know I have
[2:54:19] seen Daddy I have seen they could bring
[2:54:22] any case in front of Mary when he was
[2:54:24] laying there let Daddy come
[2:54:27] where did he come
[2:54:29] he was dying but he Paul says he was
[2:54:31] dying they said we have to operate you
[2:54:32] dying boy he said let Daddy come there
[2:54:36] was a woman that died in that service
[2:54:37] brother Benham was preaching brother
[2:54:40] Branham told bully bully we standing he
[2:54:42] says Billy go pray for the woman
[2:54:44] brother police making a joke on on the
[2:54:47] tape he says Oh Daddy did that he says
[2:54:49] oh no I'm not touching a dead person
[2:54:50] he's telling the Believers and they love
[2:54:51] him he's looking at that he says no I
[2:54:54] can't go pray for that person
[2:54:56] so when you it's natural you won't go
[2:54:58] pray for a dead person but they will
[2:55:00] sweep a spirit upon you your mom will
[2:55:02] die you will go there you say mom rise
[2:55:04] up there will be a spirit and I believe
[2:55:06] the hour is now Brothers you see he
[2:55:08] wants to go to the Jews he wants to go
[2:55:10] Joseph wants to go but you know what
[2:55:12] happened in the interim
[2:55:13] you know what happened in between there
[2:55:15] when when Joseph revealed the dream
[2:55:18] then he said to him there's a wife that
[2:55:22] you can marry it was a gentile wife
[2:55:25] and during that time brother Branham
[2:55:27] says what happened
[2:55:28] he says Joseph married a gentile wife
[2:55:32] which is us
[2:55:33] she was tucked away
[2:55:36] she was stuck the way it's revealing us
[2:55:38] sent out Christ in the interim while the
[2:55:41] brothers rejected him he moved and he
[2:55:44] turned to the Gentiles and he married a
[2:55:47] gentile Church through seven Church ages
[2:55:49] she was stuck away in the castle
[2:55:52] Hallelujah he is about ready to switch
[2:55:55] over he's about ready for this scene to
[2:55:57] happen
[2:55:58] he's about ready for Zechariah 12
[2:56:00] brother Armand to come into fulfillment
[2:56:03] he's about ready in one day whoever
[2:56:05] stands against Jerusalem they must deal
[2:56:07] with me he's ready to go there but we
[2:56:10] are not ready
[2:56:11] Hallelujah
[2:56:13] he says for thy servant became Surety
[2:56:16] for the land
[2:56:17] I told the father let him go
[2:56:20] unto my father saying if I bring him not
[2:56:23] unto thee
[2:56:25] then I shall bear the blame to my father
[2:56:28] forever now therefore I pray thee let
[2:56:32] thy servant abide instead of the lead
[2:56:35] abandonment to my Lord
[2:56:37] and let the lead go up with his brethren
[2:56:40] for how shall I go up to my father and
[2:56:44] the Lord be not with me Lester Adventure
[2:56:47] I see the evil that shall come to my
[2:56:50] father the very one that cared about
[2:56:52] nobody a few years ago is now saying let
[2:56:56] me stay abundant under you a slave for
[2:56:59] you for the rest of my life let my
[2:57:00] brother go he was the big one that said
[2:57:02] kill Joseph
[2:57:04] in due course God sends the heart
[2:57:07] and there was Joseph
[2:57:09] and I'm closing and Joseph could not
[2:57:12] refrain
[2:57:14] those of could not refrain himself
[2:57:19] before all them that stood by him
[2:57:24] right
[2:57:26] and cried
[2:57:28] and he cried
[2:57:30] cause every man to go out from me
[2:57:34] understood no man with him while Joseph
[2:57:37] made himself known unto his Brethren
[2:57:41] this is 45 verse 1.
[2:57:44] and you whipped aloud
[2:57:47] Joseph wept aloud
[2:57:51] and Egyptians and a house of pharaoh
[2:57:55] heard
[2:57:57] he screamed aloud he heard
[2:58:00] I get whipped aloud and those have sit
[2:58:03] unto his Brethren I am Joseph
[2:58:09] I am Joseph
[2:58:14] dot my father yet live
[2:58:18] and his Brethren could not answer him
[2:58:21] for they were troubled at his presence
[2:58:25] this one that was taken from the pit was
[2:58:29] put in the highest place
[2:58:31] when those of walk in the streets every
[2:58:34] knee bow down and the Bible says not
[2:58:37] anything happen in the whole of the
[2:58:39] Kingdom except it came from the mouth of
[2:58:41] Joseph that's how high he was exalted
[2:58:43] and here he's standing in front of his
[2:58:45] brothers
[2:58:47] and those who sit unto his Brethren come
[2:58:50] near unto me Zechariah come near unto me
[2:58:54] I pray you and I came near and he said I
[2:58:58] am Joseph your brother
[2:59:01] whom you sold into Egypt
[2:59:04] now therefore be not grieved
[2:59:11] no angry with yourselves
[2:59:15] he says here
[2:59:16] that you sold me
[2:59:19] hither
[2:59:21] for God did send me before you
[2:59:24] to preserve life
[2:59:29] you see many times when we go through
[2:59:30] troubles
[2:59:33] it's it's not because
[2:59:37] of us losing something
[2:59:42] Genesis 45 verse 5 to not to lose
[2:59:46] something I thought my book was falling
[2:59:49] here it's not to lose something
[2:59:51] it's to preserve life
[2:59:54] God sending
[2:59:56] came in a position
[2:59:58] and they heave through the wisdom of the
[3:00:01] dreams he told them store up the food
[3:00:05] feminists coming across the world
[3:00:09] and when there was a famine in the land
[3:00:12] where did they turn to forbred
[3:00:15] they came to Joseph
[3:00:19] you see brother Branham if you listen to
[3:00:21] the testimony of Bali Paul
[3:00:24] wondering why why why Derek for soup
[3:00:27] Mommy why did he foresee all of us he
[3:00:30] says I came in I want to play with Daddy
[3:00:32] and the cars are parked he says the
[3:00:35] house is full the ambulance are standing
[3:00:39] the people are standing I want my daddy
[3:00:41] I want my daddy
[3:00:43] if you listen to his testimony he
[3:00:45] couldn't have his daddy instead he was
[3:00:47] busy
[3:00:49] Hallelujah
[3:00:52] I was looking at through all the sermons
[3:00:54] yesterday and I was copying some of the
[3:00:56] sermons over to my laptop and and I
[3:00:58] thought yeah brother
[3:01:03] he was praying for the sick he was pre
[3:01:05] when did the man ever have time for his
[3:01:07] family
[3:01:11] to preserve life
[3:01:14] don't feel sad
[3:01:16] I did this to preserve life God did this
[3:01:19] to preserve life
[3:01:21] God you know brothers and sisters we
[3:01:23] don't realize it
[3:01:24] there's our family members they are not
[3:01:27] saved
[3:01:27] our family members is not safe God is
[3:01:30] letting new year suffer
[3:01:32] many things going through you're in the
[3:01:34] pit you're going into the prison by a
[3:01:37] lie you're in the prison and all that
[3:01:39] Potiphar's wife all that
[3:01:41] he comes before them and he also over
[3:01:43] time realized the grace of God because
[3:01:45] even in person in prison the Bible said
[3:01:48] he prospered so you go read the account
[3:01:50] when he stood in front of his brother I
[3:01:53] am chosen
[3:01:56] this was done to preserve life
[3:01:59] God is pleased I believe God did not
[3:02:01] place this message
[3:02:03] in front of us he did not make us part
[3:02:06] of this message just for jokes
[3:02:08] I don't believe that brother Branham
[3:02:10] says
[3:02:11] he says God will sow
[3:02:14] he says this church he will see if God
[3:02:17] says he does is his Masterpiece he says
[3:02:20] brother Branham says they will sweep a
[3:02:22] working of the Lord upon the bride I
[3:02:25] believe I was listening to brother
[3:02:26] Sydney Jackson in the week
[3:02:28] I believe what happened there when
[3:02:32] when those scars were parked in the
[3:02:35] streets were full and those things were
[3:02:38] happening and and and and they brought
[3:02:40] people in courts they brought the men in
[3:02:42] of us he had some sort of a sickness or
[3:02:44] whatever it was and they brought that
[3:02:46] man and the gambling said to carry him
[3:02:48] he was he was completely couldn't lift
[3:02:50] up his neck or anything he was there to
[3:02:52] carry me in this thing and they put him
[3:02:54] there and when they brought him yes They
[3:02:56] Carried him in when they put him down
[3:02:57] and when they put when they turned away
[3:02:59] to all he got up already brother Branham
[3:03:01] told him when brother said to him if I
[3:03:03] was you you have a choice
[3:03:05] you can continue laying there
[3:03:08] but if I was you I would just get up now
[3:03:11] and hook
[3:03:13] so the man just got up and he walked
[3:03:16] brothers and sisters I believe when you
[3:03:19] read that accounts and you listen to
[3:03:20] brother Branham
[3:03:22] I believe it wasn't done
[3:03:24] for us to to admire and and say oh it
[3:03:27] was nice like you know you could say oh
[3:03:28] that was a nice cowboy movie you know
[3:03:32] it was done to sow what we will do
[3:03:36] and not wall what we are doing today
[3:03:40] and I believe as we go into prayer this
[3:03:42] morning
[3:03:43] I Believe by the opening of the word
[3:03:46] I believe we are Joseph this morning
[3:03:49] done to preserve life
[3:03:51] God has given us this there's somebody
[3:03:53] this morning you've got a family member
[3:03:56] whatever the need is this morning in the
[3:03:59] audience it doesn't matter while the
[3:04:01] musicians come to play a song for us
[3:04:03] doesn't matter what your need is this
[3:04:05] morning
[3:04:06] doesn't matter what what the situation
[3:04:08] may be this morning
[3:04:10] doesn't matter if it's if it's I think
[3:04:13] the Sister Sister Hera told us me the
[3:04:15] last time the sister is suffering with
[3:04:16] Emmys how was this
[3:04:19] praying for her
[3:04:20] the lord it's just undertake for her I
[3:04:23] believe this morning she's already
[3:04:24] healed by the grace of God
[3:04:28] Hallelujah
[3:04:29] whatever your situation this morning
[3:04:31] you have a sickness you have a
[3:04:33] conditioned TV whatever
[3:04:35] God has given us the greatest
[3:04:40] Joseph is in the camp
[3:04:43] I am Joseph
[3:04:46] I am here to preserve life he has sent
[3:04:49] me to preserve life
[3:04:51] if there is a situation we told Brother
[3:04:53] they told Brother Billy Paul
[3:04:55] if you're going to die boy
[3:04:58] he said get Daddy
[3:05:01] get Daddy
[3:05:02] he said people came from let me just get
[3:05:05] to brother Branham I'm not taking
[3:05:07] anything away from Brother Branham
[3:05:10] I'm not taking anything away they people
[3:05:13] came in the presence there I up till
[3:05:15] today they go to his gravesite when they
[3:05:17] walk away from there they get healed
[3:05:19] it's not unscriptural
[3:05:21] I think it's the grave of Isaiah when
[3:05:23] they threw a dead man up and a man came
[3:05:25] back to life
[3:05:26] it's not what brother Branham is not
[3:05:28] here today
[3:05:30] on the wings of a snow white dove
[3:05:33] God gave his love on the wings of Snow
[3:05:36] White down
[3:05:38] in that sermon
[3:05:39] brother Bradham says
[3:05:42] he says I will ride this trial once more
[3:05:46] all right let's travel once more
[3:05:49] it will be in you and me brothers and
[3:05:51] sisters

[3:06:01] saying oh Get Ready Get Ready oh I will
[3:06:05] come back again brother Branham was
[3:06:07] taken up like he was when he wanted to
[3:06:09] go to Israel he was transported under
[3:06:11] the anointing of the Bride
[3:06:14] and brother Branham says oh let us get a
[3:06:16] tint and they thought they that's why
[3:06:19] they call it a 10 division
[3:06:20] was speaking of the word that God is
[3:06:23] going to do that's why God just took him
[3:06:24] off the scene and they were surprised
[3:06:25] but he said he was going to ride this
[3:06:27] Trail once more he was going to do this
[3:06:29] what was he saying he ate the book John
[3:06:32] in the book
[3:06:34] and prophesy Revelations 10 verse 11.
