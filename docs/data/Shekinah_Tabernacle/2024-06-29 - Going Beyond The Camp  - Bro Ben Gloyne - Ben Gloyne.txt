SS so my testimony uh today this is a thing that started in 2021 so I had been having Gynecology problems uh which they call postmenopausal bleeding so this had been happening for many years but each time when they checked everything was was okay so this year in March it was like a followup appointment so I went to see the gynecologist and he said things have changed all the symptoms that I had the differential diagnosis was endometrial cancer was one of them and they needed to rule it out so they did um an ultrasound and they they they also did blood tests and the gynecologist noticed that there was a polyp and a polyp was not there before so a poly is an abnormal tissue growth in the uterus so he said because of that we need to do a surgery to remove it a hysteroscopy and also the lining of of the uterus was abnormally thick so all those symptoms were pointing out that this should be in the motal cancer so while we were doing that I I spoke to to my pastor I told brother Ben and Sister Christine and I came here uh and I was prayed for and I was anointed with oil and in the meantime we just waiting for the dead because they said it's going to be like in four weeks time and all my family they were praying about it so my daughter who is in Australia called me and she said uh something mysterious happened here in in Melbourne there is a preacher that came uh from Zimbabwe and he was invited to their church so the anointing was so great and he was like testifying and saying lots of things and then all of a sudden he said your mother in New Zealand is healed and then my daughter was was like wondering what what is he saying and he said again your mother in New Zealand is healed then my daughter my daughter stood up and she said I went to shake his hand and he said again that your mother in New Zealand is healed but the preacher we don't know him my daughter uh didn't know him as well so I said okay can I get his number and I got his number and then we spoke and then I didn't tell him that my daughter had told me about what he said about me I just said um can you just pray for me this is what the doctors are saying and he said sister uh they're not going to find the the pop and they're not going to find any cancer at all let's pray and he prayed for me then uh uh when the day of the surgery was on the uh 17th of April then we went there and they kept asking me if I need um any tissue if I need to take when they remove it if I wanted uh to take it with me then I said no I don't want to take any tissue with me I just want you to take a photo and um anyway I went with my family to to Christ hospital and then then they did the the surgery and after I was in the recovery room for a very long time because uh the blood pressure kept going up all the people were coming and going but I was still there and then all of a sudden it just went back to normal and then I was I went back to the to my room and then uh when the nurse was now coming back then I asked for the for the photo of the of the polyp and then she said you know what they didn't find the pop then I just saw a God who answers prayers a God who knows me a man who doesn't even know me just saw it in the spirit that there's a sister in New Zealand who needs prayer and said I am healed so um we went home and then the gynecologist prayed that he had told me that but after 6 days he was going to um because he was going to they took a biopsy because they they needed to to really check that there wasn't any endometrial cancer so after 6 days he said he was going to call me and then I had to tell my patients in the clinic that I I'm waiting for a very important call if someone calls I need to go out and get this call so he called me while I was at work and he was like very happy and um and asking about my family and everything and I was just thinking ah it can't be cancer otherwise he's happy and then he said you know what um everything is normal but all the symptoms that I had they all like were abnormal and the only thing that they suspected was endometrial cancer so I just want to encourage enourage everyone that God is there and he's alive and he knows you thank you so much for [Applause] listening amen praise the Lord I'm the god that Health thee amen by stpes we are healed amen let's just stand this morning and just um sing some worship songs to the Lord before

to be a Christian today I'm pretty happy amen hallelujah amen Hebrews oh yes I can yes I can drive this amen so Hebrews 13: 10 down to 14 then we're going to go to numbers uh chapter 32 so it says here the Apostle Paul speaking here we have an altar whereof we have no right to eat which serve the Tabernacle for the bodies of those beasts whose blood is brought into the sanctuary by the high priest for sin are burned without the camp wherefore Jesus also that he might sanctify the people with his own blood suffered without the gate let us go forth therefore unto him without the camp bearing his reproach for here we have no continuing City but we seek one to come amen so want we need to go beyond the camp there's a lot of camps to go beyond we're going to go beyond them all amen and and the biggest one to go beyond is s amen and so we're just going to and then also for a bit of a context we're going to read here from numbers 321 to to 12 to me this is astounding we're going to go into it but to me this is very astounding numbers 321 to2 it says surely none of the men that came out of out of Egypt from 20 years old and upward shall see the land which I swear unto Abra unto Isaac unto Jacob because they have not wholly followed me save Caleb the son of Jeffy the K kenite and Joshua the son of nun for they have wholly followed the Lord I trust this all make sense as we go along amen but let's bow our heads in a word of prayer amen we want to remember brother Phil of course this morning and also want to remember brother brother Colin sister as her husband's gone to be the passed on Amen so we want to remember remember her and the family and um so amen amen let's let's bow our heads in a word of prayer amen this morning if you want to be remembered in prayer say Lord remember me amen Don't Pass Me By today Lord come meet me today Lord Jesus Lord I want a personal meeting with you this morning who wants that today amen let's pray gracious heavenly father that's the desire of our heart Lord that you would come down Among Us and you would touch Our Lives oh God that you would touch our hearts Lord you would reach down to the innermost part of our being and change us Lord transform us do a great work dear God that father when we leave these leave these four walls Lord we've been changed Lord we can say we've truly met the master Lord we've been touched by his hands we've been T he he's spoken to our lives that Lord we're no longer the person we are were when we came in but we've been changed by him Lord may you grant that father may you as we've read your word Lord we know anyone that can read can read it Lord in any language but father it takes you the great author to step in now and make it live so may you may you anoint your word to not just speaker but hearer as well from the oldest to the youngest oh God those who may be watching by the way of the internet may you may you touch every Life For Your Glory dear God and Father we especially want to remember brother Phil today Lord as he's in hospital recovering from this surgery he's had father and the fall that he had dear God I pray you'll go and touch his body Lord Jesus father I pray that every part of him would start functioning again Lord God may just decrease his pain may you be the doctor and nurse as at his bedside Lord father may you grant it Lord in the name of Jesus Christ and also we especially want to remember brother Colin sister Lord whose husband has has uh passed on Lord I pray you'd be the family come for them dear God and Father as he has asked that Lord I mean as as brother colins asked that she would know the salvation and peace of our Lord Jesus Christ we say Amen to that Lord God not just her but the whole family father may this be a time when they really meet you Lord grant it Lord we commit the service into your hands have your way in Jesus Christ's name amen amen amen God bless you friends you can you can all have your seats this morning so I want to I want to speak about going beyond the camp or going going Beyond where we are right now now to me this well there's a lot of camps to go beyond but but I just want to just focus here on this scripture here numbers 32 to me this is amazing where where many people just see a negative of this while the ones who are 20 years and older because they murmured and didn't believe the promise of God that God would take them uh into the promised land that they would not see that land you know and sure there's that side of it but to me it's astounding that the generation under that we're going to go beyond their parents unbelief they're going to go beyond am mean the culture they raised up and they're going to go beyond amen the the the unbelief that was permeating the camp and they were going to have faith in the promise of God they weren't going to live according to their parents and according to what they did they were going to live according to the word and to me that's astounding that a that that a generation of young people a generation could actually be raised up in a house of unbelief but not become that unbelief ien but they could take God at his word and say no Mom and dad you've gone as far as you've gone that's up to you but I'm going further than you I mean I'm not staying in the desert with you and you're complaining I'm going to believe God like Caleb and Joshua I'm going to go beyond what what what you're doing mom and dad and I'm going to walk with my God that I'm going to receive every promise that he's given me amen and to me this is really going beyond the camp amen because because we must go beyond the camp of ourselves that's really where I want to get down to today and our and our natural upbringing we have to go beyond the camp of our temperament and our you know our lineage and all these things we must go beyond those things we cannot let our first birth Define us amen if your if your family line has a line that you just can't forgive you got to go beyond that amen if there's an adulterous spirit in your family line you got to go beyond that I mean if there's a lying spirit in your family line you got to go beyond that amen whatever disappointment whatever thing has happened to your family and your forbears that don't Define you amen the blood of Jesus Christ is meant to Define you amen who you are and the word of God is called to Define you amen our cultures are not we must go beyond the camp of our culture amen I say the Kiwi culture is not a Christian culture it's an antichrist culture she'll be right no worries mate all that kind of stuff no that doesn't take the kingdom of God I mean that is not a no no we don't have a shield be right kind of culture i I must go beyond that Ian I got to live beyond that and it's easy I can hey I can call out any culture in this room but I'm going to call out mine it's safer cuz people don't get offended if you get offended if you say your culture is wrong you need to be B born again you need to go beyond that culture we're not any nationality under under the heaven no we are the culture of heaven so I'm not defined I got to go beyond the shiby right kind of mentality amen I got to go beyond the you know the number eight fencing wire independent you know irreverent kind of culture casual and relaxed and no I got to go beyond that Hallelujah that's not me it was me but it's not me now it was who I am but it's not who I am anymore cuz that guy died and there's a big sticker on him do not resuscitate do not Harvest his organs don't take any part of them none of them's good amen none of them's usable amen leave them dead amen hallelujah so we have to go beyond our culture we have to go beyond our upbringing we must go beyond the camp of of of of our early years of our life and we can't let that Define anymore we must go beyond the camp of that amen we must go beyond the camp amen of our of our human weaknesses we must go beyond the camp of those things we have no excuse not to serve God in this day we don't have any excuse you know Legion Legion had more excuses than a lot of us here it didn't stop him going beyond the camp he went to the Lord Jesus beyond the camp of the tombs and what he was used to he went beyond that camp amen we need to go beyond the camp of the spirit of of entertainment amen see people want the gospel to entertain them the gospel is not entertainment church is not here to entertain us amen if you want that kind of a church you're in the wrong building amen we're here to serve the true and living God Amen that his Spirit would come down and change our lives give us a new birth amen but this world conditions us to be entertained we sit down and get bored what we start people start scrolling through videos they're feeding a spirit of entertainment is feeding them I'm not here to be entertained amen this life is not an entertainment kind of the devil's made it thus but we're not here to be entertained I mean to don't be conditioned by this world oh this is boring and we need something exciting and flashy no we just need the presence of God I mean that's what we really need amen see we must go beyond the camp of of this I I say this generation's very weak and I include myself in this generation could we you know I you know when I was uh in the Solomon Islands with brother Jim Carmen I I got a newfound respect for the men that fought in that kind of conditions in World War II here's me walking through the jungle for a few moments and it's baking hot and it's uncomfortable I'm being eaten by mosquitoes and all these things and I'm complaining Within Myself this is hard and there were men that were in there there in those same conditions they're getting shot at blown to Pieces didn't know if they'd ever get home again did they have a mental health day oh sge I can't fight today I'm having a mental health problem oh sure go to the cuddle room and you'll be fine no they had a grit about them they had a determination about them am mean they didn't just quit they kept fighting amen one of my one of my um great uncles he fought the the whole time New Zealand was in World War II he was there fighting he one of the first ones to sign up he was there in nor he was in cre he was in North Africa went through Italy saw terrible things did he quit no because he knew a job had to be done he was there on creep where they had to be evacuated where they um where they had no air support and all those things many of them got taken taken prisoner he was there in that defeat did he quit no he kept going he had a mental grit he that generation had a mental toughness what about you and I you say well we live in a different kind of an age back then the pit of Hell was open just like it is today amen the Demons of hell were released then just like they are today but they didn't quit amen they had a grit about them we can do this thing what about you and I they're just fighting for a natural war and a natural thing but what about a supernatural people fighting for the consummation of the ages amen fighting that the Lord Jesus would return amen we'll be caught up and to meet him in the air Hallelujah that the that the end of this Gentile dispensation would be manifested what about those kind of a people amen you say I'm having a hard day Jesus had the worst day and he didn't quit I mean he has beaten he was M he has rejected died in a broken heart despised rejected acquainted with sorrows and grief every day of his life did he quit now he says for this purpose I've come into the world I mean I'm going to drink this cup of suffering because I got a joy set before me and it's not this present moment I'm looking Beyond he saw you redeemed around the throne and it kept him going amen with joy that was sit before him he did it now and then we and then we want to quit oh but no one understands what I'm going through he had 10 billion times worse than you had the sin of the whole world upon him he was done on All Points yet without sin he knows what temptation's like I say let's let's get a bit of moral fiber about us amen let's have a bit of a backbone right give us a backbone like a s log s log you know just let's not be jellyfish this world is a jellyfish age but we're going to go beyond that amen you know there's a sadly there's a person in my work she's not coming to work anymore she quit because she had a mental health problem just just vanished I've felt sorry for her but I thought you know how could we survive World War II with this kind of thing how could we survive Ukraine those people got thrust into that conflict whether they liked it or not we're in a conflict whether we like it or not he say well what's this conflict well we live you know this this this world we live in this this first world is actually a curse of soft living the prophet called it a curse you say well it's a blessing yeah there's a blessing but there's a curse the curse is there's no ruggedness anymore we got to go beyond and you know we can't just withdraw into our little bunker of our poor me syndrome we to go beyond the camp of that amen we you may be a Lon of a family that just feels sorry fors negative go beyond that camp don't let it don't let it Define you anymore well you know my family's got a temper that don't have to be you you say but I was raising the message you've got to have a birth I mean you can't just conform outwardly to the word and be a good person that don't that ain't going to get you in Rapture friends it's when you meet him Amen in reality when you have an experience with him and he changes your nature because remember this gospel doesn't just live on a Sunday it lives on a Monday it lives on a Tuesday it should I me it should live on a Wednesday it should live on a Thursday and a Friday and a Saturday and we're back in Sunday again I mean why because this is Everlasting gospel I actually got this I was listening to brother um Armand on Wednesday you know he talked about Moses in the burning bush and there was a bush that went beyond the camp of Natural Things it kept burning and it kept burning it wasn't consumed and Moses said this is a strange sight I've seen a lot of bushes burn but normally they get burnt up this bush was still burning and I was thinking you know Moses became that burning bush amen he got set a flame on fire and he walked down to Egypt and he was a burning bush down in Egypt there's a burning bush by the Red Sea there's a burning bush in the wilderness burning with what the glory of God he is burning up but it didn't consume him it was just burning up amen and that's to me this is what we should become and are I trust if you know him I mean you you you've gone beyond the camp of human ability you've gone beyond the camp of natural just just joining church and having a religion why you're still burning Hallelujah Lord amen you see the the spirit of entertainment is is actually a a a Christ rejecting Spirit Herod wanted to be entertained he needed to go beyond the camp of that cuz her brought oh Jesus is here do a miracle I want to see something neat entertain me Lord he needed to go beyond the camp of that now I'm excited well I'm excited you know I'm sure you all know Me Now by enough you know Hallelujah we have a living God he wants us to go beyond the camp of our upbringing I'm going to probably repeat these things a lot because a lot of people it's like this but you've got to go beyond it am you say but this is how I am no a new birth is not a patch up job it's not a Reformation it's not a seven steps to overcoming and and a little little little crisis thing and a little Band-Aid no you become a new creation you become a new creation and it's the only way that will break generational curses is you become a new creation amen that your family may be this way your great grandparents what it could be great Granddad grumpy pants and now you got that same kind of Gene going on but a new birth breaks that I mean we've got to we've got to realize the Holy Ghost is more than enough I mean the blood of Jesus Christ is more than enough it's not just a little bit and yes it's okay it's not just some dosage and no it's an overcoming power amen it's an overcoming consuming fire amen that God comes down and burns out that sin nature changes your nature that you're a different personall and you can't help it because you've been changed amen hallelujah but you see we need to go beyond the camp amen hallelujah Gideon was stuck in a camp it wasn't a camp of Victory he's a he's a circumcised believer living in the promised land but it wasn't a camp of Victory and then so when the angel of the Lord came and spoke to him he just asked the question if God before us then where are the Miracles where's the life that we read about in the Torah where's that life that we read that spoke to Abraham and the one that spoke to Moses and the one that spoke to Joshua and you know sure I can go to where where where where Jericho was I can see where God was but where is he today good question but he was trapped in a camp amen and he so what he what he had to do is we know the angel of the Lord came down and he said he said to he said to Gideon you're a mighty man of Valor I'm going to break you out of this Camp I'm going to break you out of what you think you are and I'm going to show you what you really are I'm going to break you out of this Camp of your family and your lineage and because we know the word you know the he was of the tribe Manasseh and Manassa means to forget so he was living in the camp of forgetfulness all right cuz there he is threshing weed and secret living in his inheritance stress that the enemy is going to come and take away his Harvest he's just trying to survive and well you don't know the economic conditions and you don't know what my family suffered and you don't know what happened to me and poor me and I'm all this and that the angel said no you are not what you think you are you're a mighty man of Valor and you're going to Manifest this I'm going to break you out of the cycle I'm going to break you out of this camp that you think you're so living and I'm going to show you what you really are but you see straight after this he was instructed to destroy the altar of destroy the idol of and altar of Baal in his father's house yeah he saying Giddy and the reason this problem is here is because your father's erected this thing and this has been holding you back now I'm not saying fathers here have got alts of bail in their lives but I want he had to break something that was an established thing in his family routine he had to go beyond what was accepted in his family see there's always a voice that tries to pull you back there's always a voice you know actually the title for this it probably doesn't make much sense but I was driving to church yesterday and you know and and and and and it we're going to silence the voice in the room behind you that probably doesn't make much sense but it's going to I trust it will as we go to the Tabernacle and so on but there's always a voice behind you you've got to silence and listen to God's still Small Voice that's strong drawing you into his presence amen so Gideon had to Gideon had to throw down this altar that his father had and cut down the Grove and had to destroy that thing so if if his if his father was Moody High Strung High tempered aent I mean revent to religion all those things that became a thing that was worshiped and that controlled the family maybe he wasn't loving maybe he wasn't kind maybe there's just something in him that you know it became something that he actually gave service too that had to be destroyed amen that was holding Gideon back it was holding Israel back it was holding the family back they had to go ahead so the angel took him and said destroy this thing because I'm taking you beyond the camp and then we know the next morning you know the people of the city got up and said hey Gideon's destroyed this altar we should put him to death and and Gideon's own father said let Baal fight for himself if he's really God if this thing is so important he'll fight for itself of course baale can't fight he just a dead Idol you see but the thing is the angel had to tell Gideon you've got to destroy this thing that defines your family you got to go beyond amen and we need to go beyond ourselves we need to go beyond our upbringing we need to go beyond a message culture we're going to go beyond well I dress right I talk right I listen to the message all those things are good I pray read the Bible but we're going to go beyond just a just a function of that culture culture amen because we need to go beyond that to the Living God that lives that takes the quotes and makes it live takes the word and makes it live am mean that that we don't just talk about what God did in brother brandom's day or maybe years ago in this church but no He's Alive here am mean that the fires of Revival are burning on every heart amen that the reality because we're got to realize if God if God has purchased our Salvation which he has if God has redeemed Us by his blood which he has if God has opened every to us when he took the book which he has am mean if he said look all of this is yours which it is then we should we need to go beyond the camp of what we're used to and lay hold of that thing you see the way we go beyond the camp As we judge God Faithful he's able to do it amen Caleb went beyond the camp of the unbelief let's just go back to that he went beyond him and him and Joshua went beyond the camp of the unbelief of the other 10 spies by judging God God Faithful is able to do it amen see the other 10 spies in their unbelief they were in a camp of human ability we can't take the land they're too strong their walls are too big all those things they're in a camp of human ability and this is the worst Camp to be in it's the most deceptive Camp to be in and we'll come to it with the with the inner court and the Tabernacle but it's the most deceptive thing where people rely on their own ability to do the job but Caleb and Joshua weren't in that camp because they judged God faithful in spite of what was in the land God gave them the land then that caused them to go beyond the camp of what everyone else was living in that's how they got in so it's not complicated it's actually a very simple thing when Faith really drops in the heart and you really judge God faithful and you really believe his promises that he's more than able to do it for you you'll go beyond the camp amen amen you won't stand your condition amen but you will go beyond to where God wants you to be praise the Lord amen amen praise the Lord you see we have to go beyond the camp of tradition I say it's easy oh you say well we're in the message we can't this will never turn into a family tradition it will it will I know the quotes I know where it happened I know the timeline I know this I know this I know that it can become a tradition well we go to church CU what my family does and we pray cuz my family does I read the Bible cuz my family does no it's got to you got to go beyond the camp of that tradition amen you got to go beyond the camp that it's real to you I read it because it's the word of God and it feeds my soul I come to church to worship Him in spirit and in truth and hear the word and let God come down and you know I pray to God to have communion with him because he's living on the inside of me and I want to be one with him and and I hear the word because it's got quickening power and and I want to be closer to God that's how it should be be amen and it's not about if it's boring or not you know who no it's not about that it's not to entertain you amen amen who cares about being entertained I'm not here to be entertained I'm not entertaining I hope I'm not right so but the devil's conditioned us to say well does it excite you enough and if it excites you enough then therefore it must be good that's how the world works is it not you don't see people like I mean you take the beetles for example there was a 60th year anniversary they here in Wellington you look at how they played that those concerts and that was less flashy than just some some high school band that is today if we went back to that concert you if we were transported back there well one would say it's horrible cuz there's nothing in us that loves it but just say we're of the world okay we went back to the Beatles Concert we'd say this is dumb where's the lights where's the where's the choreograph dancing these guys are on these nerdy suits in their D yo this is lame compared to today but it was entertaining in that day and entertainment's just got greater right and we can't let the gospel become the same way we're not here to be entertained but we can't let this thing become a family tradition it's got to be a real sincere thank you Lord you saved me amen I come in sincerity Lord because I know it wasn't me that found you you found me I know you called me you called my parents and you're calling me and Here I Am Lord I just want to give my life to you and I'm so appreciate the fact you found me I so appreciate the fact you died on Calvary for me I so appreciate the fact you opened the book of redemption to me amen this it's got to be a a a great sincerity amen now I'm not saying we're not sincere but never let this become a family tradition well it's Sunday morning while I go to church well it's Wednesday while I go to church it's this I do this youth service while I do this it's got to go beyond that Amen to Lord I can come in contact with you I want to come and worship you I want to gather as a people and worship you that your spirit can come down and you can do amen incredible things in our midst and you can change my life Lord because Lord I want to be a Christian every moment of every day amen where where I can see the character in my life when I read the Bible I can see that character already living out of me amen someone hits me I turn the other cheek amen someone demand something of me I give them greater amen I don't hold ought I'm I'm I'm quick to forgive slow to anger it's it's not my human temperament I'm born with living anymore who wants that I think I I think it's a great deal amen that's what we need right amen so so it should be an utmost sincerity Lord You Have Changed Me amen but that's only we can only get that when we go beyond the camp of a family tradition amen well my grandfather was this you as I said I think last Sunday my my children are fourth generation believer they're going to go beyond the camp of that that's not going to get them to Heaven sorry folks it's not going to help you we we all must know the Lord ourselves we must go beyond the camp of our upbringing to so we meet a true and living God Amen Hallelujah you see it's a family tradition we don't identify ourselves with our sacrifice that we are dead with our sacrifice oh we're Christians because I went and join the church joining a church is fine but until you're identified till you lay your hands upon him and you and become one until the spirit of Christ becomes in you and you in Christ then you'll become a son and daughter of God it don't seem to be sincerity that we ought to have it becomes a ritual just the same it as is now it's a ritual for people to become a Christian amen but when you really lay your hands upon them in faith amen the life that's in our lamb our lord Jesus comes into you and changes you that it's no longer you living but he that he that lives in you amen amen hallelujah hallelujah see we've got to go beyond the camp of what's accepted David when David became king he in uh instituted the worship and the singing the things he put in place for the for the temple to be built he never worshiped in high places he never did it but then when Solomon came into into into uh kingship you can read through first and second Kings there becomes a cycle of of the people sacrificing in the high places so there came something that it was once not accepted now it's accepted now became accepted practice now this became a camp of in instead of worshiping the place where God placed his name amen but they would Worship in the high places and this would continue on for 300 odd years until Hezekiah came I just want to read this here you can go through first and second Kings I don't I don't have all the kings here but you know we know there's many there's many good Kings and there's many evil Kings and nine times out of 10 it would say that you know there'd be there' be the Kings and they would they would list their name and they would list their mother and all these things um whether she was good or bad but but you see here's Asha I mean ASA sorry did that which was right in the eyes of the Lord as did David his father and he took away the sodomites out of the land and removed all the idols that his father had made and also uh Mah how however you say her name is Mother even her he removed from being Queen because she had made an idol and a drove and ASA destroyed her Idol and burnt it by the Brook Kidron so he's gone beyond the camp of what his mother was doing amen but the high places were not removed nevertheless asa's heart was not perfect with the Lord all um was perfect so with the Lord all his days and we just keep going down and Jehoshaphat the son of Assa began to Reign Over Judah in the fourth year of Ahab king of Israel Jehoshaphat was 3 and5 years old when he began to Reign and he reigned 20 5 years in Jerusalem his mother's name was uh azubah the daughter of um Shi and um he walked in all the ways of asa's father he turned not aside from it doing that which was right in the eyes of the Lord nevertheless the high places was not were were not taken away for the people offered and burnt incense yet in the high places now this keeps going on okay so once was accepted I mean once was not accepted now becomes accepted someone's got to go beyond the camp yeah am of these things see it can become accepted that people live with their unbelief and their carnality it become it can become an accepted thing where people are just well I'm just dealing with my humanity and well I'm stuck with it we're going to go beyond the camp of that you got to go beyond the camp of living by emotion amen we're we're called to go beyond that camp amen amen hallelujah now and we got in the seventh year of J uh jeho jehoash began to Reign and 40 years reigned he in Jerusalem and his mother's name was Zaba of BBA and jehoash did that which was right in the sight of the Lord all those days when uh jodia the priest instructed him but the high places were not taken away the people still sacrificed and burned incense in the high places now we're going to come to an end to all these things cuz there's going to be someone that will go beyond the camp there's someone that will go beyond the camp back back to the original worship amen there'll be someone because God always breaks a cycle he'll anoint someone to break the cycle amen and I trust you say in your heart Lord let that be me amen there's a lot of scriptures in the Bible I don't want to put my hand up for amen I don't want to be H high-minded lovers of pleasure more than lovers of God truth Breakers false accusers despise of those that are good having a form of godliness but despising you know the power thereof and all those things I don't want to fill that right I don't want to be a fool like the Bible says I'm not putting my hand up to fulfill that right you know I I think I read it last Sunday where where um you know Absalon was was raised up in David's house amen because because you know we know David took bash shebra and then Nathan the prophet went in and said the sword will never leave your house David because of this sin if I heard that I'll say I'm not going to cause any trouble anymore in this place he amen that's what I would have done I ain't causing no trouble in David's house someone else can fulfill that scripture I ain't fulfilling that scripture right wouldn't you do that wouldn't you be oh oh who I wonder who's going to be and it ends up to be you no I'm not going to be that guy amen so there's some scriptures I'm I ain't fulfilling amen amen I said Lord I don't want anything to do with that Lord I just want to be what you want to believe it to be Lord I want to go beyond the camp I want to fulfill what you would have me to fulfill amen someone's going to break the cycle now it came to pass in the third year of Hosea king of I mean son of elah king of Israel that Hezekiah the son of aaz King of Judah began to Reign Hallelujah 25 years old was he when he began to Reign and he reigned 29 years in Jerusalem his mother's name also was ABI the son I mean sorry the daughter of Zachariah and he did that which was right in the sight of the Lord according to all that his father did amen all that his father did this is one who's gone beyond the camp gone back to the original worship amen he removed the high places and break the images and cut down the Groves and break in pieces the Brazen serpent that Moses had made for unto those days for unto those days the children of Israel did burn incense to it and he called it Neu uh that name they called a they made a gift of God into an idol that thing had to be cut down that thing had to be destroyed because the people were worshiping Divine Healing instead of the one who gave the Divine Healing amen so and he trusted in the Lord God of Israel so that after he was none like him among all the kings of Judah this man went beyond the camp of his lineage and went beyond the camp of his four Bears hallelujah amen nor was there any before him for he clav to the Lord and departed not from following him but he kept his Commandments which the Lord command commanded Moses what a guy he went beyond the camp I know I'm repeating myself but I just want to emphasize this where are you today amen where are you today are you are you serving God because of your natural temperament by emotion your father may be a certain way and you're a spitting image we shouldn't be like that amen sure there's good every every natural lineage has good characteristics right but all the bad's got to be burnt out all the bad's got to be burnt out something's been haunting your family for centuries that thing's got to come to an end someone's going to let God break the cycle someone's got to let God take them beyond the camp of that thing and I say Lord it might as well be me amen sure the rest of my family can come too but I'm not I'm not staying behind Lord Lord I want I want you to come and break the cycle of those things out of my life you see family strains are very powerful I'm just going to read this this is from the message paradox bit of a lengthy reading but so this is brother bryand having an interview with a father and a mother about their son who who did something to his girlfriend wouldn't apologize all these things but yet he's a Believer yet he's been baptized yet he's among the saints and they don't understand why did he react this way well it's because he hasn't gone beyond the camp of his first birth yet this this young fellow's parents his mother's German no reflection on the German but there is a strain in that family that is they'll just sit and you can talk to them and they'll just stare you right in the face this girl's sister the mother of the boy her sister you can come down the street many morning and this young lady would be sitting out in the yard I'd say good morning to you she'd just look at me and I'd stop and I'd say sure fine morning she'd just stand look right at you an intelligent woman I'd say come up and see us sometimes she'd just stand there and look while brother her brothers are that way father and mother is that way now the father of the boy is strictly an Irishman Moody high-tempered High Strung that's his whole family like that except one out one other out of the family converted see this this the thing has father and mother both are Christians filled with the Holy Ghost and they have brought this young man up in the way of the Lord now the young man is about 171 18 years old something along there very fine kid and he's been a real model boy at home nice kid he's got a brother that's just vice versa but the girls the mother's family lives close to a fine church do you think they'd ever come over there and no they know it's right but it's just not in them to ask forgiveness or ask pardoning they need to go beyond the camp of that I mean if it's not in you to ask forgiveness or ask pardoning but you're not right go beyond the campu of that your tempered mury High go beyond the camp of that am mean they just won't do it it's just not in them now the genes in the father and the mother of this boy no matter how much they are converted still remain in the flesh that's been interbred out to this boy therefore the boy has got a complex in him just like from this Mother's family and they're not forgiving they will not apologize that's where the boy stands you say it's not feir you say but it's not fair this boy is born with a complex you say no that's not fair but the Lord has provided a remedy for that complex before he was ever born am me before he ever came into the mind of his father or mother before his mother even knew that he was in uh that that he was in her womb the Lord had made a way that that complex will be dealt with so it's no longer not fair it's actually he is unfair on himself by not going beyond the camp of that complex and getting Liberty from it because the blood of Jesus Christ delivers every complex amen every every family strain can come subject to the blood of Jesus Christ if you're willing to go beyond the camp of it I said no matter how much you've raised him up now look at you out of your family all of them drunks and fighting shooting cutting so forth now look at your family to the mother there are a bunch of people that just sit W speak very independent so forth irreverent to religion but I said it's not you you're the only one out of all your brothers and sisters you are sweet kind and forgiving see God makes you vice versa people are unforgiving some people can be very stoic some people can be very you know not emotional they'll just sit there like a like a lump on a post you know that's their first birth but then when God gets a hold of them they're loving they're warm they're open they're kind they're emotional amen they praise God hallelujah amen amen why sweet and kind what does that you're a tree part of the family tree yet you have received the Holy Ghost that's the thing made you tender and sweet it's not your people anymore it's your Christ that lives in you amen I said to the boy look at your family practically all them are drunks and so forth I said and how Moody High tempered High Strung but you're not you're kind forgiving what is it the Holy Spirit you're no more what you are it's Christ in you I said now the same thing has to happen to your son am so he has to go beyond the C his upbringing was good his parents are filled with the Holy Ghost what a perfect home to be raised in be had to go beyond the camp of his upbringing to meet the Lord himself amen amen amen hallelujah so God is here to break the iniquity that is visited down from the you know on the third and fourth generation the blood of Jesus Christ is more than able to break generational problems there's nothing too hard for the Lord amen see because as I said before if any man be in Christ he is a new creature or a new creation old things have passed away behold All Things become new Hallelujah we become a brand new creation that were no longer identified by where we came from naturally but we identify by where we came from amen our true origin our Lord Jesus amen amen hallelujah but you see now as I said we got to go beyond the camp of the of of many things and the thing is it's because there are two phases to Christianity brother Bram teaches and and it's represented here this is the Tabernacle in the wilderness as Moses was uh uh he saw a pattern in heaven and he built it upon the Earth and we know that this Tabernacle represents presents the human body right so not in this picture but there's the outer Court where there's the Brazen altar there's a place of sacrifice that's like the body and then you come into the inner Court where the where there's the manora here there's a shoe bread there's the altar of incense that's like your spirit and then here where there's the um where there's the Covenant Arc of the Covenant and different things that's like the soul but this also represents the Christian Journey now as Believers we're not called just to come in and stand by the altar of sacrifice remember Calvary is not our destination Calvary is the beginning that is the beginning of the Christian walk many many churches today they preach just get to the cross and you've made it and one way yes and one way no because your journey starts at Calvary amen right it ends at a new body amen so it starts at the cross it doesn't end at the cross so so it's a great thing to come to the Cross that's a glorious thing but you can't just stay there just to be justified by by faith it's a glorious it's it's a glorious experience when you're justified by faith who said that when you realize the Lord Jesus has died for you on Calvary his blood has been shed for you his blood atones for you amen and you and he's given you Faith to believe it's more than a story it's a reality that's a glorious thing amen but you can't just stay there I mean cuz someone can stand there and they've still got this unconverted nature amen they can still stand there and just have this unbelieving heart still they're not fully converted even Jesus would say to Peter when thou art converted strengthen the Brethren and there he was he had been sent out to preach the gospel heal the sick raise the Dead cast out Devils but yet he wasn't even converted yet wow amen so it's so it's a good thing to do that but then you got to go from there from outside into into the inner court now now this is this is this room as I said um quite a bit earlier where where it's human human ability is what rules because if you look at this now here is the here is the here is the light the light in this room is is from the manora here that manora had to be fed oil by a priest it was not the light of God lighting that room it was human made light amen and that light had to be it was the human ability of the priest that kept the kept those seven golden candlesticks of flame it wasn't God that did it amen it was it was was the priest that had to light it and and there was the shoe bread here which is the bread of God's presence here priest had to bake that bread it wasn't manner in a pot that never got old never went empty it it was humanly made amen the altar of incense that was a priest had to come and offer that incense upon the Altar and we know that that is a that is an altar of prayer amen so all these things are are human ability so someone who's always always always magnifying their own Christian walk is still in that room am mean someone who is comparing their Christian walk with others is still in that room but yet in that room you see the seven Church ages you can see everything God has done from Calvary to now you can see the whole Plan of Redemption but it's still up in here it's human ability to absorb it now should we study yes absorb the message listen to it meditate on it read the word do all those things but it's not our human but if it's only our human ability then what happens is the light can get SMY the light can get Smokey in there it can even go out cuz it's human ability now brother Ram scissors says the next man comes into the first Court there are the seven golden candlesticks that was good light but many times the candlesticks went out the lamp smoked up he lived by an artificial light some days he was up other days he was down now the person who lives in the holy of holies has good days and bad days but there's a life of God within them amen that they can't quit they're not living by the flesh they're not living by how they feel they're not song letting because everyone sees them they're not just worshiping God you know doing a special and they're on the peer like a lump on a log no they're worshiping God wherever they are amen they're not doing it for a show they're doing it out of sincere worship but they can have the worst week they've ever had but yet they're praising God anyway and they're not drawing attention to themselves they're worshiping God so you see we're not immune I just want to get this out of your mind you can have bad days and living the holy of holies but you're living by a different life and a light amen let's just go back to that now some days he was up other days he was down that's the way with the Christian experience you're only living in a Justified State going to church and saying well I did the best I can no you got to come to a place where Jesus did the best he could and I've been saved by the blood I've been Sanctified filled with his holy spirit amen on the King's Highway to day amen where where you're going to have rainy days you're going to have days you wonder whether you're you're a Christian or not you're going to have days when you're going to wonder whether the Miracles are right or not there's going to be days whether you wonder where you're in the right church or not all of those kinds of Scruples and things are going to pass through your mind if you walk into a little fellowship with the church again with that again there seven golden candlesticks where the offering was only made and the sacrifice burned you'll still have Smoky days and rainy days cloudy days days when the lights was out days when the smoke when the lamp smoked up the experience you've seen Miss Jones over there who was supposed to be a Christian do something that wasn't right you say oh I wonder if there's anything to it see you've still got your eyes on Miss Jones see you're still walking with artificial light that's how you know where you're living that if someone else's walk pushes you out of your own walk you're still in the you're still in the wrong place right because the lamp gets Smoky well this person did this this family did this this brother did this oh I'm out you haven't come far enough yet right you're still you're still living by an artificial light amen and we don't want to stay there see we going to go beyond the camp amen we to go beyond the camp see it's very I'd say it's easy to live in in in here right but it takes a real death to go to here it takes a real death to see there's voices that say stay in here it's acceptable to stay in here stay as a church member stay as a good Christian stay as something that's just acceptable but no voice of the world or no religious voice will encourage you go to the presence of God go there into the holy of holies right so you've got to you got to hear God's see God's still small voice says come into me come into my presence let me come and live in you amen there's no longer you keeping the light going you see in here was man's ability in here is eternal life life is in here amen the light there was no human lamp that Lit the place up I know ifone knows us very well I just want to go over it again there's no there's no human light in here the light of the glory of God lit the room amen amen he was the central focus of the whole place Amen in here you could see the blood was on The Mercy Seat Amen in here there's no mercy seat amen so someone who's in here is judgmental someone in here is understanding someone here looks down on other people some people here are judgmentally oh that person deserved that that person is not doing what I'm doing you see the person in here became the central Focus remember remember in the temple Zachariah went into this room but in the temple right everyone was on the outside and they're saying I wonder why Zachariah hasn't come out yet he was the focus of what was going on in the room and people who are just a message religious person they can be in this room and they become the focus there's no mercy in this room but the mercy seat is in here amen and when you go through the veil with a true death to you'll see the blood on the mercy seat and then you've received true mercy and then you want to give Mercy am mean you're not condescending you're not down on other people you're not
