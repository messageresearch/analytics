[26:28] he's still my Savior my Lord and Savior
[26:32] amen so I just say I'm not seeing as you
[26:37] all know but this song was laid on my
[26:40] heart this week and when we were having
[26:43] a prayer at home and then I said to my
[26:45] to my wife hey I want to sing this song
[26:47] alone because sometimes things are more
[26:56] meaningful when you do them alone
[26:58] sometimes the impact in your heart comes
[27:01] so strong when you do it alone
[27:03] that is why Jesus Christ he died alone
[27:06] for you and me
[27:08] amen so as I'm going to sing this song I
[27:12] just want to encourage you but the camp
[27:14] was also wonderful for me really I had a
[27:17] wonderful time I don't know how you're
[27:20] feeling but I'm still feeling camp
[27:21] inside me and then but but you know the
[27:25] Lord brings us to the service to be
[27:27] uplifted to be encouraged you know to be
[27:30] motivated to be corrected

[27:42] in you know maybe that president have
[27:44] got have got something in their hearts
[27:46] that that just needs you to bear them
[27:49] before God you know and and if you do
[27:52] that you know God will hear just imagine
[27:55] if that person is answered or helped
[27:58] because of your prayer how would you
[28:00] like
[28:01] to happen just imagine there's somebody
[28:03] sitting next to you if you just mention
[28:05] the name of that person before God and
[28:07] then God just give them happiness won't
[28:10] that be wonderful but I wanna sing a
[28:13] song that talks about my life amen

[34:28] been mown down by the devil and cut down
[34:31] two stumps lives that were almost ready
[34:33] to commit suicide all of that the devil
[34:36] got defeated that they've all got wasted
[34:38] and you know seeing that I was just so
[34:42] grateful that I just got beyond anything
[34:45] and I was just walking I don't know if
[34:48] anyone saw but I was going like this and
[34:50] it was like these burdens that had been
[34:52] built up for so long for people praying
[34:54] for people and you're just watching him
[34:56] cry out to the Lord it was just so
[34:57] rewarding and I was just so amazingly

[36:09] be encouraged by the church and to be
[36:14] the Lord knows their needs and he's our
[36:17] provider and we're here for a purpose
[36:24] and to do his will and he and two
[36:30] receivers to receive His blessings today

[36:43] so love ezel it's such a blessing to
[36:53] have there down there live streaming and
[36:55] we were so blessed by a tow and then we
[36:58] moved here so I think my audience
[37:09] god bless the Saints okay I'm just gonna
[37:16] testify just what happens when you're at
[37:19] the camp
[37:20] I had this barren for one of my sons who
[37:26] we've been talking about accepting the
[37:31] Lord as your Lord and personal Savior
[37:33] for quite a few months and then he would
[37:37] be saying no he wants to make sure that
[37:40] his life is right with God before he
[37:42] goes ahead
[37:44] he wants to have an experience with God
[37:46] before he goes ahead then Saturday
[37:49] morning as I was preparing myself to go
[37:51] for the kitchen duties and the Lord
[37:54] speaking to me saying speak to him
[37:57] explain to him that you don't have to be
[38:00] right before you come to me that's why I
[38:03] take a drunkard I cleanse them I take a
[38:07] man who's busy smoking cigarettes I
[38:10] cleanse them so go talk to him but that
[38:13] morning I didn't have the time I quickly
[38:14] went and then afterwards I called them
[38:19] and say let's go and rest there was
[38:21] after the festival has a lot go and rest
[38:22] but just before we arrested and then I
[38:24] told him the message that I had for him
[38:26] and then we spoke about it for about
[38:28] maybe five ten minutes or so and then he
[38:32] understood what we were talking about
[38:33] then we went and rested the evenin
[38:36] service when you went they one of the
[38:37] codes that brother Qaeda put up was
[38:40] exactly that and then I even looked at
[38:42] him and then he said yes mam I saw it
[38:45] and then I just accepted that as as more
[38:50] of a confirmation and as something that
[38:52] I can only wait for just the
[38:54] manifestation to happen and then on
[38:56] Wednesday night when brother Abe was
[38:58] busy preaching as well he put up the
[39:02] same quotation about where you need to
[39:08] wait for the Lord to be the one
[39:09] cleansing you you just come as you are
[39:11] I just cannot progress exactly what
[39:13] you've said but when you got home I said
[39:15] did you see that he said I saw it and it
[39:18] exactly what you told me about the kind
[39:20] you say I said okay we just wait on the
[39:23] lot and just pray about it and then we
[39:24] we move on and then the second one was
[39:28] when you know you always have a burden
[39:30] for each one of your kids for their own
[39:32] needs then I had a need for the other
[39:37] one for the Holy Ghost and then as we
[39:40] were going for the morning prayers I
[39:41] remember after we finished praying the
[39:43] other morning and then my husband was
[39:45] praying for the exact same thing and
[39:48] then we just kept on praying and praying
[39:50] and praying while brother Qaeda was busy
[39:51] giving the testimonies of the sisters
[39:54] who the other ones they may he touch me
[39:56] on that right
[39:57] me attacked me on the left I was just in
[39:59] the spirit praying for him but I said
[40:01] Lord it's not me I'm praying for so I'm
[40:04] not gonna say for the left shoulder over
[40:07] the right shoulder I'm just playing that
[40:09] before we live the service that you may
[40:12] touch him only to find that he was busy
[40:14] praying in that moment saying lord I
[40:17] need the Holy Spirit and as a proof that
[40:20] I have the Holy Spirit may brother Kyle
[40:23] pray for me and while he's praying for
[40:26] me I can't believe he's dead the right
[40:28] of the left but he was praying that his
[40:30] dead would be holding him on one of the
[40:32] shoulders and when a Qaeda would be
[40:34] holding him on one of the shoulders and
[40:36] then I was closing my eyes I was
[40:39] worshiping I don't know how it happened
[40:41] but as I looked I saw him being plateful
[40:44] I had no idea what is happening and then
[40:47] all of a sudden when I opened my eyes
[40:50] again he is busy
[40:51] it's him as brother Kyrie gets his dead
[40:53] they're busy praying for him when we
[40:55] went to the room the following money is
[40:57] that you know what do you know what
[40:59] happened yesterday I said no only I only
[41:02] know that I prayed for you and then that
[41:05] got me taught you that Boracay to me
[41:07] pray for you even without you going up
[41:08] and then that's when he related the
[41:11] story to me that actually you know the
[41:13] confirmation for him that he had
[41:15] received the Holy Spirit I was sitting
[41:17] there thinking the Lord saying you know
[41:19] what it doesn't have to be in very big
[41:22] things that you see the lot you need to
[41:24] be able to see the Lord even in the very
[41:26] small things for for you to be able to
[41:29] then be able to come and see bigger
[41:31] things how do you expect to have faith
[41:33] to heal cancer how do you expect have
[41:36] faith to be able to heal
[41:39] depression or in other bigger things
[41:41] when you don't see him even the smaller
[41:43] things I just want to thank the Lord for
[41:45] being with me for just answering my
[41:48] prayers for blessing me honestly
[41:50] speaking Kemp was a real blessing but as
[41:53] brother James saying then the following
[41:55] week it was hectic but who is there
[41:57] thing they're not aiming
[42:00] [Applause]
[42:16] god bless you I can't give a testimony
[42:19] and not sing the song is in the system
[42:22] is called just to be more like you Lord
[42:25] and I wrote a few years ago and it has
[42:29] to do with being able to judge right and
[42:32] there was a sermon that was been
[42:35] ministered up North End like Jesus keeps
[42:39] all of his appointments and he was just
[42:42] saying it's just imagine if someone like
[42:45] the woman that came to watch Jesus
[42:47] someone would walk side into the church
[42:49] right now and go and wash one and she
[42:53] wouldn't look dressed properly she would
[42:55] look after the world and just start
[42:58] taking off the shoes and start crying
[43:00] over the feet and just washing it and
[43:02] all that well how would we judge it you
[43:05] know and and then like was this camp I
[43:08] mean there's so much happening but I
[43:10] just stick with this and for me I've
[43:13] gone through sure depression myself just
[43:15] in the last year or so and it's been
[43:19] amazing because I never thought I would
[43:21] ever go anywhere near it
[43:24] amazing because particular okay and I
[43:30] would have probably walked past her
[43:31] years ago I saw her years ago up north
[43:34] I will I didn't even consider here
[43:36] because the state that she was in but I
[43:39] had to go through what I had to go
[43:40] through to reach out to her this time
[43:43] and I know it was the Lord you know so
[43:47] we have sometimes I don't know it can be
[43:50] maybe opinion or judgment fulness or
[43:52] something like that or not standing but
[43:55] the Lord will lead us through places
[43:57] where we then can understand and think
[43:59] like he does to act like he would to
[44:02] make the right decision and that was my
[44:05] testimony and I'll just sing the song to
[44:08] you

[47:41] then I go brother James I got a small
[47:49] testimony which is uh so this is the
[47:53] first camp that we we tried to sound
[47:55] everything was new and everything went
[47:57] wrong might so you're standing in front
[48:02] of a lot of people and the whole purpose
[48:04] that we they is we are in the Lord's
[48:08] army we are serving the Lord everything
[48:11] we do is for the Lord but see the more
[48:14] you try the more you fail now I want
[48:18] this to sink in the more you try the
[48:20] more you fail now in in by default by
[48:24] nature I'm very OCD when it comes to
[48:26] things working and it needs to work and
[48:28] it always needs to work and it has to be
[48:29] right and enough batteries and enough
[48:30] mics and everything has to be right and
[48:33] this camp everything was wrong I had
[48:37] people singing in the mic dies and then
[48:39] I had people giving them a mic and I
[48:41] didn't unmuted and everything went wrong
[48:43] and then you sit there at the back in
[48:46] you and you you have a one-on-one talk
[48:48] with the Lord and say Lord why did
[48:50] everything go wrong I was serving I'm in
[48:53] my line of duty you know I'm standing
[48:55] here just wanting the base for your
[48:56] kingdom why is it going wrong and it and
[48:59] it cuts because you want the Lord's work
[49:02] to be perfect you want it to be so
[49:04] perfect like yes perfect and sorry I'm
[49:09] feeling really sorry for myself and I'm
[49:11] sitting behind that that shot and now
[49:13] I'm also by myself because I have to
[49:15] listen to what the full-backs is doing
[49:17] cause we brother Qaeda is hoarse so
[49:18] there's a lot of things going on and I'm
[49:20] sitting Lee and I'm saying Lord I'm
[49:21] missing something again I'm missing
[49:24] something cause everything can't go this
[49:26] wrong all the time
[49:27] and it's just like he says and it
[49:30] doesn't speak to me but the thought just
[49:32] came I've got everything in control
[49:36] nothing's out of cater and I'll never
[49:39] forget brother by the cadre was
[49:41] preaching that Sunday night Anna and I
[49:42] walked around the corner to see what's
[49:44] going on because he was at the stage
[49:46] where people were praying and they were
[49:47] laying hands upon him and the ministers
[49:49] was in the
[49:49] anton chains were being broken and I
[49:51] looked and I saw a young man I never
[49:54] forget it on his knees at the altar and
[49:59] it was two ministers praying for him and
[50:01] he got what he wanted and that whole
[50:04] weekend doesn't matter what you think
[50:06] went wrong for him it went right okay so
[50:09] that's why we there so don't look at
[50:13] what's going wrong you'll miss your
[50:15] blessing look at what's going right okay
[50:19] so all praise be to God he once again
[50:22] delivered and you'll always deliver and
[50:24] we'll always judge them faithful okay
[50:27] amen don't know what is here but I'm
[50:39] just really thankful to the Lord that
[50:41] he's so mindful and as you know I broke
[50:45] my ankle a few weeks ago and do this
[50:47] whole thing I was asking what listen
[50:51] have I got to learn because just before
[50:53] Kent this is not convenient I still have
[50:55] to do everything but now I'm just slower
[50:57] and it's painful and what is the lesson
[50:59] and I read in the scriptures and just
[51:01] spoke to me and said that you're the
[51:03] teachers will no longer be in a corner
[51:05] but I'll be playing this is the way and
[51:08] I was confident the Lord was showing me
[51:10] then we had in the family all show is
[51:11] his he had to break that little lambs
[51:14] League just hold it close because it
[51:16] wasn't listening and I really thought
[51:18] that was that was me and I said Lord
[51:23] I feel like I'm in your arms but I'm
[51:24] still kicking around I just want to just
[51:27] listen to what you've got to say and
[51:29] then again I realized that so often I
[51:33] look at myself what am i doing it might
[51:36] been a good enough Christian in my sins
[51:38] because I love the Lord with all my
[51:40] heart there's nothing I love more than
[51:41] him and I want to please him with all my
[51:43] heart and I just so long does he is
[51:46] raisin to be there and so often I look
[51:49] at myself in the code but you're failing
[51:50] you're not good enough you knows not
[51:52] sincere enough for if eternal you know
[51:55] things are so important to you then why
[51:57] are you focusing on something natural or
[51:59] just constantly these mind bezels and it
[52:02] Kemp
[52:03] like so many times the Lord has just
[52:05] spoken to me no you are mine I've chosen
[52:06] you I've done it and you're you know and
[52:08] I'm so thankful and it Kemp there was
[52:10] that night on I think at Sunday and
[52:12] Saturday night whose singing no longer a
[52:14] slave to fear and he says I have chosen
[52:17] you from my mother's womb and it just
[52:19] spoke to my heart so much and I said
[52:20] Lord brother KJ was saying you know that
[52:22] the woman was bone lead him come and
[52:25] pray and put his hand on my shoulder and
[52:26] these things I said lord if this is you
[52:28] just confirming it confirm it to me one
[52:30] more time let my husband who's busy up
[52:33] the front let him just stand out now
[52:35] come to me and pray with me that we can
[52:37] stand together and hope believes us and
[52:39] he just stood up right there at the
[52:41] front and looked around looking for me
[52:42] and walk straight to the back and put
[52:43] his hand on me and the whole he goes
[52:44] just came down on us both and I said
[52:47] Lord oh never doubt you

[58:36] Jesus Christ as we all stand and testify
[58:41] how great our God is and how wonderful
[58:43] he is to us we sometimes we we take it
[58:49] for granted so we could see the hand of
[58:53] the Lord move over the weekend the Labor
[58:56] weekend from day one from Friday evening
[58:58] we could see the Lord's hand in
[59:00] everything that we had to do from from
[59:02] the organization to the setup of the
[59:04] auditorium the preparations in the
[59:06] kitchen and the dining hall the
[59:07] preparations for all the rooms for
[59:09] visitors
[59:11] everything was ordained by the Lord
[59:13] there was nothing out of place
[59:15] maybe we in our humanity like my brother
[59:18] said you know we thought this wasn't
[59:20] working right or that wasn't making
[59:22] making sense so this wasn't gelling but
[59:25] I'd like all our parents all our adults
[59:28] in the church first to stand up please
[59:39] now look look around look around look at
[59:44] look at the number we have now this
[59:48] number is around 20 or maybe 20 20 plus
[59:52] 4 what the Lord has done and the way
[59:56] that he has used each one of you to put
[1:00:01] your hearts and put yourselves one side
[1:00:03] but put your hearts to the Lord's hand
[1:00:06] and let him work and provide and make
[1:00:09] this camp possible so I'd like you to
[1:00:11] put your hands together for yourselves
[1:00:13] and for your brothers and sisters
[1:00:15] because without you without you seniors

[1:00:57] Hungary that came through with their
[1:00:59] children when they see y'all y'all were
[1:01:02] the true lights because y'all played
[1:01:05] with every child you'll enjoyed yourself
[1:01:07] you're stood in your position of duty
[1:01:10] when you're recalled David you stand up

[1:01:26] portion I saw you working hard in the
[1:01:27] kitchen well done well done those things
[1:01:30] stand out when we at the back and we'll
[1:01:35] look at our our our children and we see
[1:01:37] that the Lord is using them and working
[1:01:39] with them and making them do things out
[1:01:42] of their comfort zone we like to shy
[1:01:44] away we'd like to be like brother full
[1:01:46] and and be in the back but he had to get
[1:01:48] the front seat alright
[1:01:55] [Applause]
[1:01:59] everything is in the Lord's hands
[1:02:02] there's nothing that will will be missed
[1:02:06] I would also talk black take this
[1:02:10] opportunity now to ask for forgiveness
[1:02:12] from my brothers and sisters I know it
[1:02:15] was your camp it was your place to shine
[1:02:19] it was your place to be comfortable we
[1:02:23] had sisters and brothers doing their
[1:02:25] kitchen work and toilet duties and
[1:02:26] sitting up and all the background work
[1:02:29] while everyone came to the auditorium
[1:02:31] and you came late to church and I moved
[1:02:33] your places and I took your Bibles and I
[1:02:36] shuffle things around
[1:02:39] we were the host party our duty was
[1:02:43] first to make sure our gifts are
[1:02:47] comfortable our gifts are seen to and
[1:02:50] taken care of in whichever way possible
[1:02:53] so if I moved your Bibles if I moved
[1:02:55] your spaces if you didn't get the same
[1:02:57] seat again forgive me but the Lord knows
[1:03:02] why the Lord knows why you know we we
[1:03:06] have to make all our our gifts feel
[1:03:08] comfortable first because without
[1:03:11] everyone coming together to the camp the
[1:03:13] camp wouldn't have taken the next level
[1:03:16] we we as a church and the camp together
[1:03:18] wouldn't have gone to the next level
[1:03:19] it's only by the hand of Lord you know
[1:03:21] we had small camps before we use a small
[1:03:23] chapel we used the dining hall only and
[1:03:27] at this time he's provided our needs and
[1:03:29] he's exceeded it abundantly for
[1:03:31] everything that we had to do from start
[1:03:34] to finish you know which ever brother or
[1:03:36] sister played a part in this whichever

[1:04:16] much every single one of you if I
[1:04:17] actually named all of you who helped I'm
[1:04:20] gonna be naming everyone cuz all of you
[1:04:22] gave so much and we really really
[1:04:24] appreciated it and you know I am we
[1:04:25] wondered because the last camp we did
[1:04:27] all together you know we'd had slow
[1:04:28] cookers and braai so it was like what 50
[1:04:32] 80 people and slow cookers and rice
[1:04:35] cookers is completely different then why
[1:04:37] do we decide 300 at some of them 300
[1:04:39] people fed everybody happy perfect
[1:04:42] amount of salad perfect amount of meat
[1:04:44] perfect amount of leftover curry for
[1:04:45] everybody just young I mean so thank you
[1:04:51] all for your help that meant that we
[1:04:53] could be in the services Oh your extra
[1:04:55] help your all went over and above you
[1:04:56] all really did you came you don't have
[1:04:58] to but you all came and really helped us
[1:05:01] and we want to thank the Lord so much
[1:05:03] because even the lady from the camp rang
[1:05:05] me the next day and she said do you want
[1:05:07] to know how the Lord looked after
[1:05:08] usually said that oven because we had
[1:05:10] one oven that was our a good oven and it
[1:05:13] had fitted about seven bain-marie trays
[1:05:16] in it so that was our main cooking oven
[1:05:17] she said I blew up the day after we left
[1:05:20] so we would have been stuck so yeah just
[1:05:23] thanking the Lord for providing I just
[1:05:40] fell I just say something so I know I
[1:05:41] had to stand up but there's so much the
[1:05:45] Lord was just kind of speaking but
[1:05:48] specifically he touched so much on this
[1:05:52] one spirits and depression and things
[1:05:54] and and as if he said it just for me
[1:05:59] which I know he said it for many people
[1:06:02] it was well worth it to be there and I'm
[1:06:06] you know no one ever wants to talk about
[1:06:09] things that are uncomfortable or you
[1:06:11] know things that are hard because
[1:06:15] everyone feels like no one's going to
[1:06:17] understand
[1:06:18] there you know maybe they don't they
[1:06:19] don't want to talk about it or whatever
[1:06:21] but but he specifically and to be honest
[1:06:30] I think I think I've ever even read the
[1:06:32] quote before that I remember I think it
[1:06:36] was 52 and I tend to listen to a lot of
[1:06:40] more of the messages that are later on
[1:06:41] because they are much clearer than the
[1:06:43] older messages but he brought up that
[1:06:46] one
[1:06:52] little boy oh I had a spirit attached to
[1:06:58] money was 12 years old and that's why
[1:07:00] you felt you couldn't give his heart to
[1:07:02] the Lord and you know God does deal so
[1:07:10] much with children and you know we think
[1:07:15] all they're just they're just little
[1:07:16] kids they're just preteens or just teens
[1:07:19] no they're they're a soul that God is
[1:07:22] trying to get a hold of and uh if i
[1:07:26] brother branham talks so strongly about
[1:07:28] 12 13 you know being the age of
[1:07:31] accountability you know the devil is so
[1:07:34] strongly before then trying to get a
[1:07:37] hold of them as well it's not just the
[1:07:39] lord who wants to touch their lives you
[1:07:41] know so just sort of encourage you that
[1:07:43] no matter what age your small children
[1:07:46] are oh they're 5 or 6 or 10 or 16 or 18
[1:07:54] you just pray them through because you
[1:07:59] know the Lord said that these kind don't
[1:08:01] come out just by haphazard Ness it takes
[1:08:06] fasting in prayer and I I know this by
[1:08:10] experience that it's true don't ever
[1:08:17] give up because saying God's timing
[1:08:21] sorry so I really thank the Lord for
[1:08:24] what he brought there by the cadre
[1:08:26] through the weekend because it really
[1:08:28] brought peace in my heart as well
[1:08:30] so I say thank you God bless you and I'm
[1:08:47] just gonna stand over here if you don't
[1:08:49] mind it is a very big thing for me to
[1:08:53] stand up so I'm just gonna stand here
[1:08:57] no I've got my Jersey okay
[1:09:01] um so it was an incredible incredible
[1:09:05] camp as you all know I think I've shared
[1:09:11] a bit with sister Shannon
[1:09:12] it was a huge man battle for me and the
[1:09:16] Friday and the Saturday I think just
[1:09:21] from we have come from listening to
[1:09:25] tapes Tang and her never being part of a
[1:09:27] church every time there is a new
[1:09:31] minister or someone that stands up in
[1:09:33] the front it takes me time to feel
[1:09:36] comfortable so I struggled on Friday I
[1:09:39] felt the spirit of the law but I
[1:09:41] struggled on Saturday I thought Lord
[1:09:42] just help me how I see my brothers and
[1:09:45] sisters standing and rejoicing and I
[1:09:47] want to do that too
[1:09:48] and something happened I don't know win
[1:09:51] I don't know how but I started screaming
[1:09:55] and even like lost nod I was thinking
[1:09:58] wow it's so embarrassing why did I do
[1:10:00] that what was the screaming good me you
[1:10:03] know did you make yourself do that I
[1:10:06] didn't I'm not that is not me and that
[1:10:11] was on the Saturday morning and from
[1:10:14] then I was like completely different I
[1:10:17] couldn't you know I like to sit it's
[1:10:20] comfortable for me my legs and which the
[1:10:24] Lord is He healed me from to you
[1:10:28] I couldn't keep from standing I was so
[1:10:33] excited and then the Saturday evening
[1:10:37] service every every service there was
[1:10:39] just some little victory I was sitting
[1:10:42] in us just thinking oh Lord the morning
[1:10:43] was so good I just need you to be a God
[1:10:46] and I need you to come and just clean up
[1:10:48] the stuff you know I've got all these
[1:10:49] things that are attached to you from
[1:10:51] years of pain and struggle and and
[1:10:55] within five minutes per grade I was said
[1:10:58] we gonna mow down all this weeds Wow
[1:11:02] like it's such little things but that's
[1:11:04] huge you know that's being connected on
[1:11:07] one spirit and then obviously the Sunday
[1:11:10] morning service was incredible and
[1:11:13] Sunday evening was a breakthrough I was
[1:11:17] praying a lot for a certain young man
[1:11:21] because I wanted him to have the freedom
[1:11:24] I wanted him to just have a breakthrough
[1:11:25] and joy and I think we all know
[1:11:28] something happened at some point when
[1:11:31] brother Ben went up and he once started
[1:11:32] praying there was this huge breakthrough
[1:11:35] and all of a sudden it felt like time
[1:11:37] Stood Still you know I love to write
[1:11:40] songs and I have so many other
[1:11:43] testimonies I'd love to share with you
[1:11:45] guys this is the start maybe but it is
[1:11:49] I've always put convicted and profess it
[1:11:52] as well that I'm too scared to go to the
[1:11:53] front I don't have the strength to go to
[1:11:55] the front I can't I can't I can't and I
[1:11:59] also feel like the devil gives us things
[1:12:01] sometimes to realize when we delivered
[1:12:04] from them to realize what a great power
[1:12:06] he is so that suddenly evening when that
[1:12:12] when everyone was just touched by the
[1:12:14] Lord and luck whether any said I felt
[1:12:16] like the heavens just opened and we were
[1:12:18] no longer on earth I remember opening my
[1:12:21] eyes I found myself all over the hall
[1:12:24] for some reason usually I stay in one
[1:12:26] place I was there with me I was there I
[1:12:28] don't know what happened but I was
[1:12:30] moving around
[1:12:31] I think eyes by Shannon are thoughts by
[1:12:33] I don't know what happened but as every
[1:12:36] way and and you I remember opening my
[1:12:42] at some point and I looked around and I
[1:12:46] saw you beautiful people and I thought
[1:12:49] wow Lord this is this most incredible
[1:12:54] lover cannot even explain it I try
[1:12:55] trying to explain it to my dad and I
[1:12:57] couldn't you can't explain it and I
[1:13:00] thought right now I could walk up there
[1:13:02] right now and sing to everyone I have no
[1:13:04] fear whatsoever no fear and when I
[1:13:09] realized that something said that's it
[1:13:11] you see he takes away all of that like
[1:13:14] and I also realized that's why you had
[1:13:17] it before to realize how how God can
[1:13:20] change and it's not me it's completely
[1:13:22] the Lord the fact that I felt such
[1:13:24] freedom and peace can only be God
[1:13:27] because I know what a stronghold that
[1:13:29] had on me that feeling of not being able
[1:13:31] like even now like your body my body
[1:13:33] shakes it takes over you takes on a
[1:13:35] spirit but at that moment I had none of
[1:13:37] that I felt like I could go do any one
[1:13:40] which is probably why I was all over the
[1:13:41] show and just be with the it just
[1:13:45] testify and sing and praise and yeah it
[1:13:48] was incredible um there's also another
[1:13:52] thing that happened a few weeks ago with
[1:13:54] Caleb and I in the car and talk about it
[1:13:58] yep yeah I'm gonna talk about it okay so
[1:14:02] um alcohol wouldn't start and it was on
[1:14:07] a day when we were just before we were
[1:14:09] moving I had found lice in my hair which
[1:14:11] it was a very traumatic event for me and
[1:14:14] really traumatic um because there was
[1:14:17] one at what you know people have fears
[1:14:19] of heights and things that actually make
[1:14:21] your body shake like I had a fear of
[1:14:22] lice like that which the Lord is not
[1:14:25] there with me from - but it was a really
[1:14:29] Truman and Matt you know it was big for
[1:14:31] me that and there was lots of little
[1:14:32] things that were happening on that day
[1:14:34] we quickly got in the car now we needed
[1:14:36] to go to the next place and the battery
[1:14:38] wouldn't start
[1:14:39] I've had many flat batteries before guys
[1:14:41] and I realized oh and any of you been to
[1:14:45] our heart or our old house you know you
[1:14:47] can't just get in and out of the
[1:14:49] driveway it's very difficult in the way
[1:14:51] I had parked you wouldn't be able to
[1:14:52] pull a car up next to us so I thought
[1:14:54] how we how we're going to do this
[1:14:56] come and try and get the car out because
[1:14:58] of the angle of the COTS too difficult
[1:15:00] and Caleb said let's pray
[1:15:05] I really don't feel like praying but no
[1:15:06] I'm a bit upset and I closed my eyes and
[1:15:10] I and he put his arm around me and he
[1:15:12] started praying and he said in Jesus
[1:15:14] name this call was stopped and I
[1:15:16] remember usually he kept his arm on me
[1:15:20] and I open my eyes and I just said still
[1:15:22] but it felt like time froze again that
[1:15:25] same I don't know and then all of a
[1:15:29] sudden it felt like there was this
[1:15:31] pressure in the car and Caleb said stop
[1:15:35] the car now I put in the keys perfect
[1:15:38] started perfectly listen we started
[1:15:42] shouting and screaming and crying and
[1:15:45] and he said it was such a testimony for
[1:15:48] Caleb because he had never experienced
[1:15:50] God acting immediately on a situation
[1:15:53] instantly and it was the most incredible
[1:15:55] incredible experience and the testimony
[1:15:58] of that is that yes the Lord started the
[1:16:00] car but the big thing that I feel like I
[1:16:03] want to leave with you guys too is
[1:16:05] sometimes God puts you through difficult
[1:16:08] situations so that when he does deliver
[1:16:11] you you realize what a miracle it is
[1:16:12] because I right at that moment again I
[1:16:15] thought I have had so many flat
[1:16:17] batteries thank you Lord because if I
[1:16:20] hadn't had them I know that there's
[1:16:23] absolutely no ways I would have known
[1:16:25] what a miracle it was for that car to
[1:16:26] start and y'all just wanna leave you
[1:16:29] with that
[1:16:31] [Applause]
[1:16:43] anybody asked got a testimony
[1:17:00] well the week before we went to camp we
[1:17:05] had a little I had a little altercation
[1:17:08] with what other parents at my preschool
[1:17:10] and they knew it was out of sorts for me
[1:17:13] so work told me to stand down for a week
[1:17:16] so because I was under too much pressure
[1:17:19] because we have got a lot of sick kids
[1:17:22] in our room and changing staff and all
[1:17:26] this sort of got on top of me
[1:17:28] so things weren't going to good and so I
[1:17:34] had to go for two meetings with the boss
[1:17:37] in the bigger boss and sister Robin came
[1:17:40] with me just to be my support person so
[1:17:44] when I got to camp it was like God open
[1:17:48] the gift lead gates and just let
[1:17:49] everything go and when I got back when I
[1:17:55] got back on Monday I did a meeting with
[1:17:57] that Tuesday I didn't meet have a
[1:17:59] meeting with the parents and they were
[1:18:02] going we weren't concerned about our
[1:18:03] child that was yeah we're concerned
[1:18:05] about now it's gone
[1:18:06] oh my goodness all this blew up just
[1:18:09] because they were concerned about me and
[1:18:12] I was going they didn't cure lord
[1:18:16] [Applause]
[1:18:22] leading up to the camp two or three
[1:18:24] weeks it was just so stressful but go
[1:18:29] through that so many things in can't
[1:18:31] just so many things but one thing that
[1:18:33] stood out to me was us to do ease and so
[1:18:38] many years gone but they has to be in
[1:18:48] this time assist ahead to you Jemima you
[1:18:51] know and I was just so DJing I just
[1:18:53] thank the Lord for that I don't ever
[1:19:01] want you to say this about you know
[1:19:04] maryam when she took the tambourine and
[1:19:07] ahmadiyya man said a demon said sing yet
[1:19:10] to the lord for he had triumphed
[1:19:12] gloriously the horse and his rider had
[1:19:16] he thrown into the sea and also there
[1:19:23] was one thing that i also wanted to say
[1:19:26] was i usually go to the khemsa myself i
[1:19:29] always have something that I went from
[1:19:30] the Lord when I go to the camps but I
[1:19:32] said no Lord I just want to go for
[1:19:34] others I want to shoulder in trail with
[1:19:37] others so when I went to the camp and
[1:19:39] I've lived that at his feet but when I
[1:19:41] went to the camp all these people
[1:19:42] started to come to me and I said thank
[1:19:44] you Lord because then I could pray for
[1:19:45] them and enter in and I was so thankful
[1:19:47] he's done so many amazing things go
[1:19:58] bless your Saints it's good to be here
[1:20:02] about a year ago I made a trip to buy a
[1:20:04] new vehicle and my aunt it was like do
[1:20:07] you want to come to church Charlie come
[1:20:08] to church no no no it's only get home
[1:20:10] some of you know I just want to thank
[1:20:12] the Lord for some of my vehicle and
[1:20:14] bringing me here little did I know I'd
[1:20:16] be fellowshiping in this church a year
[1:20:18] later
[1:20:19] did it move down here to stay here but
[1:20:22] um God's just blessing you richly and
[1:20:25] another thing I really like to thank the
[1:20:27] Lord for was um probably card rates
[1:20:29] being about my metals we all have mind
[1:20:32] battles every single one of us everyday
[1:20:34] we've got a voice in our head in us the
[1:20:36] white dog and the black dog and it's not
[1:20:38] until I just want to thank God for the
[1:20:41] scripture that he gave us saying that
[1:20:43] their mind is for God but until we just
[1:20:45] surrender everything doesn't matter how
[1:20:47] big how small but as soon as we
[1:20:49] surrender that to him and give him
[1:20:51] praise no matter how bad or how good the
[1:20:54] situation my brother being spent
[1:20:55] speaking praise Lord we're going through
[1:20:57] the wringer as soon as you give that to
[1:20:59] him the whole situation will change no
[1:21:01] matter what every time will change but
[1:21:03] you've just got to realize what it is
[1:21:05] and praise the Lord for it yeah sort of
[1:21:08] Lord for everything he's doing for me um
[1:21:19] I just actually there's just a little
[1:21:21] testimony just happened right then well
[1:21:23] brother Ben was speaking I prayed to the
[1:21:26] Lord well if I'm supposed to give a
[1:21:27] testimony I just pray that brother James
[1:21:28] will turn around and look at me so he
[1:21:31] did I some - for my kids I went to Kemp
[1:21:39] for my children I had a very strong
[1:21:47] burden for my oldest - I prayed that
[1:21:50] that they would have an experience with
[1:21:53] God while they were there I don't know
[1:21:56] to what extent God touched them but I
[1:22:00] think brother kuben for moving them up
[1:22:03] the front I think that sometimes it's
[1:22:06] good to get away from them um so they
[1:22:09] can be freer
[1:22:10] amongst other Christians amongst their
[1:22:13] peers I know that I was praying one
[1:22:18] evening I saw people going up for prayer
[1:22:20] and I could see Dimitri from where I was
[1:22:23] sitting and I just prayed that he would
[1:22:26] go out for prayer just that the Lord
[1:22:27] would touch him he did so praise God and
[1:22:32] I also prayed for a wonderful experience
[1:22:34] for Thema just that she could have fun
[1:22:38] with friends and end Christians just to
[1:22:42] have a real blistered time in the Lord
[1:22:44] and she was one of that group that
[1:22:47] stayed up till 3 a.m.
[1:22:49] singing so crazy
[1:22:56] I just want to I just want to quickly
[1:22:59] add to that testimony their payment
[1:23:02] might not like me for this but and we've
[1:23:04] got this on video footage so after the
[1:23:06] Sunday night we were watching the video
[1:23:08] footage that Nadine was taking and we
[1:23:10] were singing that song my god deliver
[1:23:12] Daniel and we were singing this song
[1:23:15] quite probably at least half an hour it
[1:23:17] was probably more than half an hour and
[1:23:19] we had been round the circle and now
[1:23:21] some people were like I've got one I've
[1:23:23] got one my god delivered whoever it was
[1:23:25] and Jamie I was sitting outside of the
[1:23:28] group off to the side with some of the
[1:23:30] other young ones and I had kept seeing
[1:23:32] as she was looking over like I want to
[1:23:33] be a part of this because Hannah was
[1:23:36] over here and that was just so much
[1:23:37] going on and so Andy's facing towards me
[1:23:41] and taking those behind them and Andy I
[1:23:43] go and I got one and just as he's going
[1:23:45] like this time that gets up and starts
[1:23:47] walking over to the table my god
[1:23:49] delivered Taemin and time oh it's just
[1:23:51] something where you watch somebody else
[1:23:54] like praise the Lord we've got the proof
[1:24:06] [Music]
[1:24:08] yeah I've got one as well I usually go
[1:24:11] to camps and I think man this is awesome
[1:24:13] and this time I kind of went for myself
[1:24:18] so before camp I was struggling with
[1:24:22] with some things but when their mind
[1:24:24] battles you don't know if it's you or
[1:24:27] whether it's real there's always that
[1:24:29] doubt all this could actually be real
[1:24:31] and um I'm quite an emotional person and
[1:24:36] I wear my heart on my sleeve
[1:24:38] and I'm also the my love language is
[1:24:40] encouraging words so when things quite
[1:24:44] affect me by words then they shouldn't
[1:24:46] but um they do and so I'm when I started
[1:24:50] seeing but I loved most
[1:24:52] um not going as you plan that you think
[1:24:58] it should go the way I don't know I
[1:25:00] won't go into detail anyways um you just
[1:25:04] question you question lots of things and
[1:25:08] and so before camp there was a lot of
[1:25:12] those questions those doubts those
[1:25:14] feelings they they bring other things
[1:25:18] with them and that kind of like what
[1:25:19] brother Claude did you let those weeds
[1:25:21] grow and they'll turn into trees and it
[1:25:25] was awesome because I went through it
[1:25:27] I'm so thankful for the Lord for trials
[1:25:29] because I heard him speaking one time
[1:25:31] about the butterfly that there's a
[1:25:33] cocoon there's a trial you're in and if
[1:25:35] you try to scratch your way out or
[1:25:36] someone tries to do it for you then you
[1:25:39] won't be that butterfly at the end
[1:25:40] you'll know you'll die in the cocoon but
[1:25:42] those trials are for us to get out and
[1:25:44] spread our wings and so it's so
[1:25:46] important in the Lord's timing it will
[1:25:48] happen and so I'm so thankful for the
[1:25:52] trial and going in I thought man Lord I
[1:25:54] can't get past this as is taking over my
[1:25:56] whole life I'm not even the same person
[1:25:58] because I know I had experience with the
[1:26:00] Lord and you know I wasn't I haven't
[1:26:02] been this like who I originally was in
[1:26:05] the Lord for Doctor Who nap years but um
[1:26:10] and um I um
[1:26:14] going into it I said I said Lord all I
[1:26:17] need is perfect love because I was
[1:26:19] reading the testimony of God be how
[1:26:21] brother branham went beyond the curtain
[1:26:23] of time and he said man there won't be
[1:26:25] anything like this there won't be all he
[1:26:27] named all the things that aren't of God
[1:26:29] he said they won't be there and and I
[1:26:32] said that's all I need Lord I just need
[1:26:33] perfect love and so I went to the camp
[1:26:36] and and then but I didn't know what I
[1:26:38] was actually struggling with anyway so I
[1:26:41] went to the camp and I'm and then the
[1:26:43] fruit and then I thought I got the the
[1:26:45] victory and I thought you know I've got
[1:26:47] the tools so I can be able to combat
[1:26:49] this thing you know in my mind cuz I'll
[1:26:50] wake up with thoughts in my head just
[1:26:53] and you know brother Brennan talks about
[1:26:55] that he sees that vision of the guy
[1:26:57] pounding the woman that's how I felt
[1:27:00] like like I'd wake up and here's this
[1:27:01] guy going you're no good you're not a
[1:27:04] good mom you're not a good wife you know
[1:27:06] you just come to me over and over after
[1:27:09] a while you start to believe it and I'm
[1:27:12] in and you think it's real and you get
[1:27:18] to a place like you know you like
[1:27:22] off you know not even being around quite
[1:27:27] interesting because I'm thankful I went
[1:27:30] through it because I realized like a
[1:27:33] teenager's life they go through such a
[1:27:35] change in their body that Satan will try
[1:27:37] to pound them right at that time anyway
[1:27:40] so I went through and then I thought and
[1:27:43] then after that if the thoughts kept the
[1:27:45] next morning on Sunday morning and I
[1:27:48] said Lord I can't I can't do this I
[1:27:52] can't do it in my own strength and I
[1:27:54] remember I listened to brother Brigham
[1:27:55] sermon that said he the brother had a
[1:27:57] dream and the God God give him work to
[1:28:00] do and he pound the tree you know and he
[1:28:02] was supposed to chop a tree and take the
[1:28:05] logs do you remember that story
[1:28:06] somewhere but the guy said I can't do it
[1:28:09] I don't have the strength to do it so he
[1:28:12] says if God told him put the tree in the
[1:28:14] put the log in the river and just ride
[1:28:16] the river and so I was like oh Lord I
[1:28:19] could I don't have the strength I've let
[1:28:22] it grown up it's my own fault but lord I
[1:28:24] can't I can't battle this anyway so he
[1:28:27] um that night at service oh my goodness
[1:28:32] I realized what it was because I've
[1:28:33] we've experienced it before at camp say
[1:28:35] when that that that's a real feeling of
[1:28:38] heaven I realized that's perfect love
[1:28:41] perfect love came down and nothing can
[1:28:45] get like Satan cannot what fear cannot
[1:28:49] dwell in perfect love that's what we
[1:28:51] experienced perfect love just fell over
[1:28:53] everyone in the whole camp at that time
[1:28:56] it was amazing it's like we don't have
[1:28:58] to fear Satan has no print when that
[1:29:01] perfect love comes it flees everything
[1:29:04] else please and so I was like oh you
[1:29:06] know you're in that atmosphere and then
[1:29:08] I said oh lord if I just need something
[1:29:10] else if I need prayer for this if I need
[1:29:12] deliverance more something more than me
[1:29:13] can you please have this is at the end
[1:29:15] of service have prided riggs come back
[1:29:18] where he was kind of standing because he
[1:29:19] was all over that you you know he was
[1:29:21] all over the place
[1:29:22] and then I said and I'll go up for
[1:29:24] prayer cuz I'll know it's you having me
[1:29:26] wanting to go for prayer so he did he
[1:29:28] went back to the spot and I went back
[1:29:29] and Melissa was there and she said oh I
[1:29:32] really like to go to for prayer I'm like
[1:29:34] praise the Lord me too
[1:29:35] let's go together so we went for prayer
[1:29:37] and this is at the closing of the
[1:29:38] meeting and so they've just got someone
[1:29:41] else to pray for the closing of the
[1:29:42] meeting and then we're stuck kind of
[1:29:45] like oh we're already asking brother
[1:29:47] contradicts to pray for us and so um
[1:29:50] Melissa told her what she wanted she
[1:29:52] hurt but he she wanted him to pray for
[1:29:55] as well before and then and then so he
[1:29:59] starts praying but I couldn't tell him
[1:30:00] what I wanted prayer for either because
[1:30:02] we had already started praying anyway so
[1:30:04] he then starts praying for me and he
[1:30:07] prayed for mine battles I didn't mean
[1:30:10] but it was just so amazing was right to
[1:30:12] the just directly this man that had no
[1:30:15] idea who I was what I was doing there
[1:30:18] just directly was God through and
[1:30:19] praying for me I'm sorry but it was so
[1:30:22] important that he didn't know what I
[1:30:23] needed prayer for because then I could
[1:30:25] say oh yeah that's the mind battle that
[1:30:28] wasn't me that wasn't anything else and
[1:30:31] so then he pretend then the next morning
[1:30:33] I did not have any thought that I was
[1:30:35] going right oh oh oh and well we are
[1:30:37] sitting there after I got prayed for the
[1:30:40] brother that was closing the prayer set
[1:30:41] and we can take it into our our hall our
[1:30:44] dormitories with us it doesn't have to
[1:30:46] stop so anyways my heart's cry was like
[1:30:48] do it again Lord do it again do it again
[1:30:50] for us so then I found myself in the the
[1:30:53] dining hall with these all these
[1:30:54] musicians and people like to sing young
[1:30:56] people and I'm like um for hours we're
[1:30:59] just sitting around looking at each
[1:31:00] other and scene and I'm like in reality
[1:31:03] I would get quite uncomfortable with
[1:31:04] that I'm like man this is awesome and
[1:31:07] then they sung this song which means so
[1:31:10] much to me and and I just could not sit
[1:31:14] down and if you know this song and you
[1:31:16] know the battles that I've been going
[1:31:18] through and what the Lord showed me I
[1:31:20] know who I am what he says I am where he
[1:31:25] says I'm a cuz I know
[1:31:28] anyways I couldn't hold still and my
[1:31:31] skirt but by this time for a while it's
[1:31:33] been losing its elastic I know I can
[1:31:35] just couldn't stop like I was dancing in
[1:31:38] front of everybody I'm like and then I
[1:31:40] that night when I went back into my room
[1:31:42] I'm like okay that was a bit
[1:31:43] embarrassing that's like I was the only
[1:31:45] one but his presence was so strong and
[1:31:48] before that we're like I wonder what
[1:31:49] it's like to dance in the spirit but
[1:31:51] then I realize that night I was like
[1:31:53] when the twin the spirit wouldn't when
[1:31:56] you I felt like David Mann when the art
[1:31:58] comes in and you're like
[1:31:59] know who I am I know Wyatt with me at
[1:32:04] the battle Oh in anyways yes so the
[1:32:06] victory and I know I got the victory
[1:32:08] because this week of course Satan tried
[1:32:11] to come to me and someone said to me a
[1:32:13] very hurtful thing and if you know what
[1:32:16] I was battling with it didn't help so it
[1:32:21] was like something really hurtful to me
[1:32:24] but it was like water off a duck's back
[1:32:29] [Applause]
[1:32:30] know who I am and then and then I got
[1:32:34] mad at the devil I'm like shut up devil
[1:32:37] shut up get back to where you go you're
[1:32:40] onto my feet and then we had that love
[1:32:42] I'm like that's not that person that's
[1:32:45] the devil joining come on attack me but
[1:32:48] so it's like the Lord gave me that bat
[1:32:50] that Satan was hitting me with man now
[1:32:53] I've got it
[1:32:58] and yes oh it's such a blessing when you
[1:33:01] feel powered when you know who you are
[1:33:02] and then oh just testimony of then then
[1:33:05] we took that to the sports day and Joe
[1:33:08] and I were just rejoicing and speaking
[1:33:10] about what the Lord was doing and then
[1:33:11] we prayed a prayer and said Lord speak
[1:33:13] to all these young people here so a seed
[1:33:16] in their heart and then the coach starts
[1:33:18] talking about the Bible and God and then
[1:33:20] I just felt like that bat God and he
[1:33:24] knows like we've got the victory and it
[1:33:26] man that song has just been ministering
[1:33:28] to me so I was it was awesome it was an
[1:33:32] awesome camp and it was just all God is
[1:33:35] so so good and I'm so glad to be his
[1:33:41] [Applause]

[1:33:49] share was you know like when you see

[1:42:15] the testimonies you know God did
[1:42:17] incredible things
[1:42:18] I'm so glad though we don't have to live
[1:42:21] off a memory amen
[1:42:24] we don't need to live off a memory we
[1:42:25] are walking on amen so this is the
[1:42:29] Apostle Peter he's speaking after the
[1:42:31] Holy Ghost has fell there an axe chapter
[1:42:34] 2 and verse 15 he so he's responding to
[1:42:37] the people here they say that you know
[1:42:38] they're all drunken but then he says for
[1:42:40] these are not drunken as you suppose
[1:42:42] seeing it is but the third hour of the
[1:42:44] day but this is that which was spoken by
[1:42:46] the Prophet Joel and it shall come to
[1:42:48] pass in the last day say if God I'll
[1:42:50] pour out my spirit upon all flesh and
[1:42:52] your sons and your daughters shall
[1:42:54] prophesy your young men shall see
[1:42:56] visions and your old men shall dream
[1:42:58] dreams and on my servants are my
[1:43:00] handmaidens I'll pour out in those days
[1:43:03] of my spirit and they shall prophesy and
[1:43:05] I'll show wonders and heaven above and
[1:43:08] signs in the earth beneath blood and
[1:43:10] fire and vapor of smoke
[1:43:12] Sun shall be turned into darkness and
[1:43:14] the moon into blood before the Great and
[1:43:16] notable day of the Lord and it shall
[1:43:18] come to pass that whosoever shall call
[1:43:20] on the name of the Lord shall be saved
[1:43:23] a minute let's go to the book of Romans
[1:43:25] I'm gonna read from Romans 8 so Romans
[1:43:33] chapter 8 and we're gonna read yeah if I
[1:43:37] can we have it here and then we're gonna
[1:43:42] read read from verse 18 this is for I
[1:43:46] reckon that the suffering of this
[1:43:48] present time are not worthy to be
[1:43:50] compared with the glory that shall be
[1:43:52] revealed in us I mean for the earnest
[1:43:55] expectation of the creature that's
[1:43:57] creation waiteth for the manifestation
[1:43:59] of the sons of God for the creature was
[1:44:02] made subject to vanity not willingly but
[1:44:05] by reason of him who has subjected the
[1:44:07] same in hope but the because the
[1:44:10] creature itself also shall be delivered
[1:44:12] from the bondage of corruption into the
[1:44:14] glorious liberty of the children of God
[1:44:16] for we know that the whole creation
[1:44:18] groaneth and travaileth and pain and
[1:44:20] together until now and not only they but
[1:44:23] ourselves also which have the
[1:44:25] firstfruits of the Spirit even ourselves
[1:44:27] groan within ourselves waiting for the
[1:44:30] adoption to wit the redemption of the
[1:44:33] body for we are saved by hope now in our
[1:44:36] hope and the bibles and expectation with
[1:44:38] pleasure
[1:44:39] right so it's an expectation for we are
[1:44:41] saved by hope but hope that is seen is
[1:44:43] not hope for what a man see is that why
[1:44:46] does he yet hope for but if we hope for
[1:44:49] that we see not then do we with patience
[1:44:52] wait for it amen let's bow our heads and
[1:44:56] a yo just for prayer gracious Heavenly
[1:44:59] Father Lord we're so thankful Lord the
[1:45:02] song we just saying we will walk out of
[1:45:05] this world victorious because you have
[1:45:07] won the war father we've seen our names
[1:45:10] in the end of the book dear God we we
[1:45:12] see our end destination is dancing on
[1:45:14] streets of gold Lord when the devil is
[1:45:16] no more not even a memory we still will
[1:45:19] be shining as the Sun rejoicing in your
[1:45:21] presence for eternity and dear God we
[1:45:24] want to thank you for what you've done
[1:45:26] just pray father as we now look into
[1:45:27] your word Lord anchored into our souls
[1:45:30] rather what you have done and our myths
[1:45:32] that camp my god father look we want to
[1:45:35] press the battle want to press on father
[1:45:37] may we see continue to see with greater
[1:45:39] clarity who we are on you what you've
[1:45:41] done for us father we just want to bless
[1:45:44] your name Lord may you anoint speaker
[1:45:46] and hearer father may you receive all
[1:45:49] honor glory and praise in the service
[1:45:50] Lord and Jesus Christ they may break the
[1:45:53] bread of life to us for your glory in
[1:45:55] Jesus name we ask
[1:45:56] amen amen god bless your friends you may
[1:45:59] you may have your seats I want to if I
[1:46:01] can take a subject I want to speak about
[1:46:03] you know after the fire fell you know we
[1:46:07] we've had incredible time at camp the
[1:46:10] fire fowl perfect love was you know I
[1:46:13] I'm still trying to get my voice back to
[1:46:15] you know but you know perfect love was
[1:46:18] there God was there who was perfect love
[1:46:20] and he did tremendous things but you
[1:46:22] know we want to I want to look into
[1:46:24] today you know what happened after the
[1:46:27] fire fell but why the fire fell you know
[1:46:30] many of us there wasn't the first time
[1:46:32] we met the law but here we met him maybe
[1:46:33] many years ago but he always pours
[1:46:36] himself into his people because you know
[1:46:38] we're living in a season where we just
[1:46:40] read in Romans 8 where you know the
[1:46:43] creation is groaning and travailing
[1:46:44] until the manifestation the revelation
[1:46:48] of the sons of God now we understand
[1:46:51] that we are already our sons you know we
[1:46:53] do not become sons by the new birth it
[1:46:55] says in Galatians because he our sons he
[1:46:58] says for the spirit where you cry Abba
[1:47:00] Father so you do not become a son or
[1:47:02] daughter by the new birth you already
[1:47:04] were and the reason you were hallelujah
[1:47:07] and the reason that you receive the Holy
[1:47:09] Ghost is because you are a son or
[1:47:10] daughter of God Alleluia but now we are
[1:47:13] living in a season where we're the full
[1:47:15] manifestation amen of the bride is here
[1:47:19] hallelujah you see you know everything
[1:47:22] Jesus died for us now you know to redeem
[1:47:25] to purchase amen would be made manifest
[1:47:27] in a people so brother Branham says in
[1:47:32] the seed of discrepancy he he makes a
[1:47:37] statement any
[1:47:39] he says this is now the seed of God the
[1:47:42] Word of God Jesus said in a certain
[1:47:44] places is the word as a seed and every
[1:47:46] seed will bring forth of its kind and
[1:47:48] now if the Christian the children of God
[1:47:51] the children of the kingdom has become
[1:47:53] the seed of God then they must be the
[1:47:55] word of God for the word of God
[1:47:57] manifested in the age that they're
[1:48:00] living in for the promised seed of that
[1:48:02] age God gave his word at the beginning
[1:48:04] and each age has its seed it's times its
[1:48:08] promises so he's saying that the
[1:48:10] believers in the age will manifest the
[1:48:12] promise of the age I mean they'll not
[1:48:14] manifest something in the past or even
[1:48:16] in the future they'll manifest the
[1:48:18] promise for the season hallelujah and
[1:48:21] now we know we're living in the season
[1:48:22] of a Jubilee hallelujah and it's not a
[1:48:25] Jubilee where people can go back into
[1:48:27] bondage is there's a breaking of the
[1:48:28] cycle I mean where it's not from being
[1:48:31] being having a revival and going into
[1:48:33] death and then revival again but now
[1:48:35] it's time of just constant revival I
[1:48:37] mean where that cycle would be broken
[1:48:39] oh yeah and now we now I just want you
[1:48:42] know if you don't get anything out of
[1:48:43] the surface apart from this you're
[1:48:45] living in the best time I mean you're
[1:48:47] living in the greatest time I mean we're
[1:48:49] not living in the dark ages all they
[1:48:50] could do was give their lives as a
[1:48:52] sacrifice they are anointed that way
[1:48:53] we're not living in that day we're
[1:48:55] living in the best day I mean because
[1:48:57] everything that is written pertaining to
[1:48:59] the believer in the word I mean and the
[1:49:01] message is being manifested in their
[1:49:03] lives and it's not them doing it it's
[1:49:05] God in them doing it how Lewis when God
[1:49:08] said it's a time of Jubilee he's
[1:49:09] announcing I'm gonna give you a Jubilee
[1:49:11] I mean when he said the devil's under
[1:49:13] your feet he says I'm gonna put the
[1:49:14] devil under your feet I'm it's not you
[1:49:16] doing it it is God and a season
[1:49:18] according to his word manifesting it and
[1:49:21] you hallelujah so that's why it's the
[1:49:23] greatest time to be alive it doesn't
[1:49:25] matter how you feel about it you may be
[1:49:27] shouting you may not be shouting but
[1:49:29] that doesn't change the fact if God has
[1:49:31] called you you're part of the promise of
[1:49:33] this day hallelujah I mean so the
[1:49:37] children of the kingdom manifest the
[1:49:40] word for the age that they're alive and
[1:49:42] hallelujah so you know so it's wonderful
[1:49:47] so now brother Bernie speaks in peace
[1:49:52] than the absolute message yeah I want to
[1:49:57] go through why the first you know saying
[1:49:59] after the fire fell but when I say why
[1:50:01] the fire fell because you know you got
[1:50:04] to see like we we didn't you know we
[1:50:08] read it an x2 penis is this is that
[1:50:11] spoken by the Prophet Joel so he
[1:50:12] identified this vertigo identified that
[1:50:15] was what was prophecy was now manifested
[1:50:17] so it wasn't it wasn't something
[1:50:19] speaking of a future event
[1:50:21] they were manifesting what was spoken so
[1:50:23] they could identify what had happened by
[1:50:26] the scripture so by identifying what
[1:50:28] happened in the scripture they could see
[1:50:30] where they were in time hallelujah
[1:50:32] because we're not just wandering around
[1:50:34] you know camp camp wasn't because of us
[1:50:38] camp was because God has a season now my
[1:50:42] my Brides going to come to her position
[1:50:43] the club the three of clubs being taken
[1:50:46] out of the hand of the devil
[1:50:47] and now the Devils being beaten down by
[1:50:49] his own lives hallelujah his own Compton
[1:50:52] nations be put back upon him and now
[1:50:54] she's a free woman hallelujah so so
[1:50:57] we've got to see now because we're not
[1:50:59] in the beginning of the church
[1:51:00] I meant we're at the end I mean we're
[1:51:02] not the Alpha bride with the Omega bride
[1:51:04] hallelujah so now if that be the case
[1:51:06] then we're going to manifest the
[1:51:09] prophecy for this day and God's gonna do
[1:51:11] it remember that's why when emphasized
[1:51:13] it's God's doing and that's why we can
[1:51:15] rejoice and worship remember gonna say
[1:51:16] Lord this is your doing
[1:51:17] this wasn't orchestrated this wasn't
[1:51:19] cause of something it was you see I'm
[1:51:22] gonna come and I'm gonna do this and it
[1:51:24] doesn't stop at camp it continues on
[1:51:26] hallelujah because we've got to
[1:51:28] understand like they like the Apostles I
[1:51:30] mean they didn't just have God as a
[1:51:32] memory in the Upper Room after they left
[1:51:34] I mean the same God that was fell upon
[1:51:36] them went in them and they did the work
[1:51:38] hallelujah and then when the devil came
[1:51:40] against them like the scribes and
[1:51:42] Pharisees they tried to intimidate them
[1:51:44] don't preach in his name anymore you
[1:51:46] know don't speak about him no more and
[1:51:48] they just asked the question should we
[1:51:50] please man or God you tell us they made
[1:51:53] the supernatural God holy are they when
[1:51:55] you're they made the eternal one and the
[1:51:58] eternal one wasn't just with them he was
[1:51:59] now in them and now they're looking at
[1:52:01] them saying what should we do now should
[1:52:02] we please your God you tell
[1:52:05] and then they went away and they had a
[1:52:07] prayer meeting and the same one that
[1:52:08] came down in the upper room came down
[1:52:10] again and refilled them hallelujah what
[1:52:13] was God doing God was confirming the
[1:52:15] work I started I'm continuing Holly
[1:52:17] you're not walking by excitement you're
[1:52:19] not walking because you want to your
[1:52:21] ambition this is me doing it hallelujah
[1:52:24] and it's the same thing with you and I
[1:52:25] you know God comes he fills us
[1:52:27] transforms us the devil tries to push us
[1:52:29] off the road but God says you're staying
[1:52:31] on the road hallelujah and then he comes
[1:52:33] and it fills you again and it confirms
[1:52:35] his promise with you again
[1:52:37] supernaturally and all you just say as
[1:52:38] well Who am I going to please man or God
[1:52:41] I'm just gonna please God hallelujah
[1:52:44] that's why in the trial hold on just
[1:52:47] keep walking
[1:52:48] just keep walking God and the season
[1:52:50] will come as we as you heard this
[1:52:51] morning you'll be thankful you went
[1:52:53] through it hallelujah Amen so we're
[1:52:57] gonna be the same way they saw the
[1:53:00] Apostles saw they were part of that
[1:53:02] prophecy they were it wasn't just some
[1:53:05] abstract thing that that that that I
[1:53:07] Joel spoke they saw they were the
[1:53:09] fulfillment of that word amen and you've
[1:53:12] got to see you other fulfillment when
[1:53:14] the book of Revelation says the bride
[1:53:15] has made herself ready and to her it was
[1:53:18] granted that she be arrayed in linen
[1:53:20] clean and white the Rice's of saints you
[1:53:21] were to say that's me speaking about
[1:53:23] when John saw that in symbol for must no
[1:53:26] longer assemble it to a reality
[1:53:28] hallelujah so to you it was granted
[1:53:31] God's in here have my righteousness put
[1:53:33] it on it's made for you Holly had fits
[1:53:36] just right hallelujah so she made
[1:53:38] herself ready but because it's been
[1:53:40] given to her to be made ready hallelujah
[1:53:43] maybe you gotta say you're the
[1:53:45] fulfillment that says let us be glad and
[1:53:47] rejoice hallelujah we should be rejoiced
[1:53:52] continue just just read that in the
[1:53:54] scripture you say feeling down you say
[1:53:56] I'm actually the fulfillment when God
[1:53:59] because whenever God prophesized
[1:54:01] something he knows the person who's
[1:54:03] going to fulfill the prophecy he knows
[1:54:05] exactly who it is he knows when they're
[1:54:06] going to be born Holly doesn't just
[1:54:08] throw it out there and say well this
[1:54:09] person matches the most so then they'll
[1:54:11] do it no he knows exactly he knows
[1:54:14] exactly who's going to fulfill it I mean
[1:54:16] when when Joel gave that prophecy God
[1:54:19] Peter will be standing there and you're
[1:54:20] the woman at the well would be there you
[1:54:21] Mary Magdalene would be there can you
[1:54:23] that Matthew all the 120 he knew would
[1:54:26] be there hallelujah
[1:54:28] so when he said the bride has made
[1:54:29] herself ready he thought of you you can
[1:54:32] put your name in that scripture that's
[1:54:34] why the messages gripped you why it's
[1:54:35] God giving you the wedding garment
[1:54:38] hallelujah hallelujah so you know we we
[1:54:43] have to look because you understand if
[1:54:46] God God has determined he's going to
[1:54:48] have a bride rising in power taking her
[1:54:51] position having her god-given rights
[1:54:54] he's determined that she will be there
[1:54:56] and you've just got to rejoice saying
[1:54:58] Lord I'm so thankful I'm living I just
[1:54:59] happen to be in this season where you
[1:55:02] want two people to be joint heirs with
[1:55:03] you you know it's brother cadre said you
[1:55:06] know everything that Paul prophesied
[1:55:07] hallelujah we are here to manifest I
[1:55:10] mean the Webby joint heirs with Christ
[1:55:12] will be seated in heavenly places in
[1:55:14] Christ Jesus
[1:55:14] all condemnation taken away every stain
[1:55:17] taken away hallelujah
[1:55:19] it was prophesied in but it's reality
[1:55:21] now hallelujah and we just happen to
[1:55:23] fall in this age you say thank you lord
[1:55:25] thank you snow longer prophesy thank you
[1:55:27] I'm not looking for a future event
[1:55:29] sometime I'm here to fulfill it
[1:55:31] hallelujah
[1:55:33] incredible moment what a great time to
[1:55:36] be alive hallelujah now I'm sure you can
[1:55:42] all relate that before you meet the Lord
[1:55:45] before you heard this message you're
[1:55:47] trying to tie your soul to something
[1:55:49] looking for something to satisfy brother
[1:55:53] BAM says in the absolute message brother
[1:55:54] a be quoted it on Thursday he says now
[1:55:58] every great achievement is tied to an
[1:56:01] absolute you cannot run life without
[1:56:03] having an absolute you can't make an
[1:56:06] achievement without at being an absolute
[1:56:08] for it's the final tie post it's the
[1:56:12] hitch rack at the end of the journey
[1:56:14] it's a place where you're tied to
[1:56:16] something's at the end of the
[1:56:17] destination your hitch to it is your tie
[1:56:18] post it makes you do things when you get
[1:56:22] a christ-centered life like paul
[1:56:24] ordinarily you wouldn't do it
[1:56:27] oh look ordinarily that man trained in
[1:56:29] all the scriptures and things ordinarily
[1:56:31] he would have fired
[1:56:32] line here's trained in but when he when
[1:56:36] he made Christ as absolute his ultimate
[1:56:39] then there was a different life he did
[1:56:42] different he done things crazy to what
[1:56:44] he once was trained to do and and it'll
[1:56:47] do the same thing if the church would
[1:56:50] get away from that council of churches
[1:56:51] and come back and make God's Word their
[1:56:53] ultimate make God's Word their ty Post
[1:56:56] that would do it but they're trying to
[1:56:59] do a man-made achievement and it's bound
[1:57:02] to fall well the Bible said they do but
[1:57:05] there's going to be a bride that's been
[1:57:07] elected since the foundation of the
[1:57:08] world that's going to be tied to that ty
[1:57:12] post and you should say he's talking
[1:57:14] about me okay I can see eternity break
[1:57:18] come down down into time since Eden and
[1:57:21] when it did there was a line of blood
[1:57:23] all the way up under Calvary and from
[1:57:26] Calvary tied with this line and it goes
[1:57:30] on to the typos Jesus and someday when
[1:57:33] he'll come to claim his own everyone
[1:57:36] that's tied to that ultimate will be
[1:57:37] raised up into eternity why they have
[1:57:40] seen they have been an eternity all the
[1:57:43] time they are predestinated in eternity
[1:57:45] they were part of God they're in a
[1:57:47] sinking at the beginning and when their
[1:57:49] big rope is pulled of the line of blood
[1:57:51] that token I was speaking of when it
[1:57:53] comes up from the earth everyone that is
[1:57:55] included in that blood will be dropped
[1:57:57] right back into eternity again but the
[1:57:59] only way it'll be it'll be tied to that
[1:58:02] absolute Jesus Christ that's absolutely
[1:58:04] not an achievement of man but God raised
[1:58:06] him from the dead and he is an absolute
[1:58:08] and we know he's alive because here he
[1:58:11] is with us in the power of his
[1:58:12] resurrection doing the same thing he did
[1:58:15] when he is here on earth I'm tied to
[1:58:17] that ultimate as the end of all strife
[1:58:19] I'm tied to it that's my life I was a
[1:58:21] sinner when Christ saved me I met
[1:58:23] something and since that came and to me
[1:58:25] it's been different and I'm tied to it
[1:58:27] everything that I am everything that I
[1:58:30] am is tied right there and when God is
[1:58:33] separating his life and let me live in
[1:58:35] him and he and me now I wonder had me
[1:58:39] now I want you to understand you know
[1:58:42] the Lord made a way before there was
[1:58:44] anything so before there was a
[1:58:46] foundation
[1:58:46] well the lamb was slain so God already
[1:58:49] made a way for his elected ones to come
[1:58:51] back to him I mean so before there was
[1:58:53] any molecule any creation the lamb was
[1:58:55] slain so I'll say before the devil was
[1:58:57] even made
[1:58:58] I mean God made an overcoming power to
[1:59:01] defeat his enemy holy and he tired every
[1:59:04] one of us predestinate once into that
[1:59:06] victory hallelujah
[1:59:08] so now so before the devil was we were
[1:59:10] victorious in God's mind I mean now now
[1:59:13] The Devil's here we're victorious holy
[1:59:15] and then through eternity there will be
[1:59:17] no more devil but we still will be
[1:59:18] victorious hallelujah so you remember
[1:59:21] where the devil comes against you you
[1:59:22] say I was before you I'll be here with
[1:59:25] you and I'll be here after you and you
[1:59:26] won't be here hallelujah amen Pete's got
[1:59:30] an expiry date and he's going a bit
[1:59:33] moldy we're going to throw them out
[1:59:35] hallelujah but we don't the butter but
[1:59:37] the people of God have no expiry date
[1:59:39] sure in these bodies but here just to
[1:59:41] develop character here for God to reveal
[1:59:43] himself to you amen but there's a part
[1:59:46] of us that was with God before the
[1:59:47] foundation of the world hallelujah and
[1:59:49] and we had represent we have
[1:59:51] representation in heaven amen so you
[1:59:54] know we've got to understand we have an
[1:59:56] absolute we have an ultimate hallelujah
[2:00:00] amen I remember that ultimate finds you
[2:00:05] hallelujah Amen so we should just
[2:00:08] rejoice hallelujah now the fire that
[2:00:13] fell on Pentecost was a person it wasn't
[2:00:16] fire wasn't a literal fire that was God
[2:00:19] the Angel of the covenant that that that
[2:00:21] led Israel out of Egypt that same one
[2:00:23] came down divided himself into his
[2:00:24] church that same one so the same one
[2:00:27] that led Moses and Joshua was now in his
[2:00:30] church leading them into a spiritual
[2:00:32] inheritance
[2:00:33] hallelujah where once they were they
[2:00:35] were under the bondage of the devil they
[2:00:38] were chased by him they were scared
[2:00:39] whatever more they were enslaved by him
[2:00:41] now this pillar of fire separate himself
[2:00:44] unto them and now the devil had to flee
[2:00:46] from them I mean so now the tables are
[2:00:49] turned and they had come to their
[2:00:50] position
[2:00:51] I meant demonstrating now God was in
[2:00:53] people once again hallelujah so you
[2:00:56] remember now the fire fell but what
[2:00:58] happens after the fire fell
[2:01:00] hallelujah and maybe I'm gonna jump back
[2:01:02] and forward but you know that same one
[2:01:06] that same one that led Israel is now
[2:01:08] leading the church not a different one
[2:01:10] you say who was the Associated perfect
[2:01:13] love was in the room that was the Lord
[2:01:14] heaven came down you know I was I just
[2:01:19] couldn't take it how brother cadres
[2:01:20] preacher says let's go to heaven in such
[2:01:23] an atmosphere and then he said the door
[2:01:24] came open up in heaven I think God's
[2:01:27] presence comes in the room and at his
[2:01:29] presence for runs and step again it was
[2:01:31] like too much or so real why is that
[2:01:34] because it wasn't a man just just being
[2:01:37] charismatic God anointed that gift he's
[2:01:39] saying now heavens in the room Polly my
[2:01:41] presence is half hallelujah whole here
[2:01:45] now I just love that amen
[2:01:47] I mean but but we got to understand now
[2:01:50] the angel of the Lord is here to lead us
[2:01:53] individually into a body change I mean
[2:01:56] to the same one that leaders are all
[2:01:58] there is the same one leading us
[2:01:59] individually into a rapture hallelujah
[2:02:03] what I'm so glad you look at the angel
[2:02:05] of Lord you know we know we know that
[2:02:06] was God in angelic form so in in him was
[2:02:11] to be a deliverer I want to see the
[2:02:13] attributes of God were manifested the
[2:02:15] attributes and the pillar of fire was
[2:02:17] manifested at Moses so and God was to be
[2:02:19] a deliverer he has to be a guide he has
[2:02:22] to be a shepherd hallelujah all those
[2:02:24] things were the pillar of fire and then
[2:02:26] when Moses met the pillar of fire that
[2:02:28] same one stepped unto Moses and then it
[2:02:30] when he went to Pharaoh he said now now
[2:02:33] Pharaoh didn't see the pillar of fire he
[2:02:35] saw Moses but the pillar files that are
[2:02:37] speaking out of Moses he said let my
[2:02:40] people go
[2:02:41] they weren't Moses people without God's
[2:02:43] people God was speaking first person
[2:02:45] through a man and then now God began to
[2:02:47] manifest this attributes of deliverer I
[2:02:49] mean through the prophet Moses so he
[2:02:51] says now and then Pharaoh says no I'm
[2:02:54] not letting them go he's right fine I'm
[2:02:55] going to plague your kingdom until you
[2:02:57] have to let them go
[2:02:58] and he said plague after plague and he
[2:03:01] kept us rolling Goshen safe he gave him
[2:03:03] the shed blood because he's a deliverer
[2:03:04] I mean so so so he brought judgment on
[2:03:07] the enemy he brought deliverance to
[2:03:09] God's children I mean that's all and God
[2:03:11] was not manifested in a person
[2:03:14] hallelujah and in the same God and then
[2:03:16] and then he told you no he told Moses
[2:03:18] when they go into the Red Sea go this
[2:03:20] way come this way you know it wasn't
[2:03:22] them just running as fast as they could
[2:03:23] out of Egypt God guided them brought
[2:03:26] them to the Red Sea because God wanted
[2:03:28] them to see this is really what happens
[2:03:30] when your enemy is gone hallelujah you
[2:03:33] know God wants to show us his victory in
[2:03:35] our lives
[2:03:35] amen and God wants us to remember what
[2:03:38] we delivered from that we're still
[2:03:40] thankful we're still rejoicing
[2:03:42] hallelujah say well it's been years
[2:03:44] since I've been set free but you're set
[2:03:45] free hallelujah so they came to the Red
[2:03:49] Sea amen God led them down there the
[2:03:51] children of Israel begin to panic even
[2:03:53] Moses said and God uses way crying unto
[2:03:56] me I'm gonna show my deliverance here
[2:03:59] speak and move forward don't crying to
[2:04:02] me speaking move forward hallelujah so
[2:04:04] so the Red Sea was open Azrael came
[2:04:07] through fear I couldn't you know you
[2:04:09] know Egypt couldn't follow well they
[2:04:11] tried to and they all end up being
[2:04:13] drowned hallelujah so now God's
[2:04:16] deliverance was being manifested and you
[2:04:19] taking I always think about Miriam
[2:04:21] she is 80 odd years old she picked up a
[2:04:24] tambourine it wasn't a young sister
[2:04:26] there was joy sing this is an old one
[2:04:28] and she began to dance wholly and she
[2:04:30] began to sing and God came down and
[2:04:33] known to them and because God wanted
[2:04:35] them to realize the enemy was dead I
[2:04:37] mean that the enemy couldn't follow them
[2:04:40] and they walk to the promised land
[2:04:41] the enemy was dead hallelujah as the
[2:04:44] same thing with you and I the enemy
[2:04:45] tried to follow you to camp he couldn't
[2:04:47] follow you after camp because he died
[2:04:49] right there
[2:04:50] Polly he was defeated right there the
[2:04:52] mind battles were gone hallelujah the
[2:04:54] enemy was gone that that's for God why
[2:04:56] we had a Red Sea experience hallelujah I
[2:04:59] mean that's why God is not a phrase his
[2:05:02] devil come devil come to church come to
[2:05:05] camp devil
[2:05:06] have a seat devil make yourself welcome
[2:05:07] but you could end up dead hallelujah
[2:05:11] hallelujah why is that God manifesting
[2:05:15] his attributes of deliverer through
[2:05:16] Moses he was manifesting the life of the
[2:05:19] pillar of fire
[2:05:20] hallelujah and then Moses goes off the
[2:05:23] scene now here's Joshua and Joshua met
[2:05:26] the same one Moses me
[2:05:27] but he's got a different part of the
[2:05:29] ministry he's not there to call them out
[2:05:31] he's here to take them in hallelujah so
[2:05:34] now the same one comes down and meets
[2:05:35] Joshua he says he for us or against us
[2:05:38] Joshua awesome he says no I'm not for
[2:05:40] you against you but I come as the kept
[2:05:42] of the host of Lord so he saying no no
[2:05:44] I'm not for you against you I've come to
[2:05:45] take over your battle I mean you are not
[2:05:48] on I am NOT on your side you're on my
[2:05:51] side I mean some winner
[2:05:53] Jesus is not on Eire outside we're on
[2:05:55] Jesus side he says now I've come to take
[2:05:58] that over your battle hallelujah and I'm
[2:06:01] going to place you in your inheritance
[2:06:02] that was prophesied where you dwell
[2:06:05] hallelujah I mean you take the 12 tribes
[2:06:07] of Israel you take the blessings they
[2:06:09] you're the pay tracts were given those
[2:06:11] blessings place them in the land
[2:06:13] so it was prophecy but it wasn't the
[2:06:16] prophecy doesn't stay prophecy it
[2:06:18] becomes manifested holiest for now that
[2:06:21] prophecy was laying there but in the
[2:06:23] right season hallelujah in the right
[2:06:26] season now God said no you're not going
[2:06:28] to stay as slaves anymore because my
[2:06:29] word must be fulfilled and those and
[2:06:32] that generation that came out they just
[2:06:34] know just the right generation
[2:06:35] hallelujah so now that prophecy became
[2:06:38] fulfilled under the ministry of Joshua
[2:06:40] so now God was manifest the attributes
[2:06:43] of the pillar of fire were being
[2:06:44] manifested in Joshua's ministry what is

[2:10:01] now and when I meet you the judgment bar
[2:10:03] and this night is called in to order see
[2:10:06] if I haven't told you the truth he is
[2:10:08] right in here
[2:10:09] now hallelujah that same God is present
[2:10:12] he says in persevering he says and now
[2:10:15] if that be the angel lord leading these
[2:10:18] people it will produce the same thing
[2:10:19] that it did when he was manifested in
[2:10:22] the true son of God it'll do the same
[2:10:24] thing in the adopted sons of God you
[2:10:27] take now coming to the new teaser I said
[2:10:29] about Moses and Joshua he taking the
[2:10:31] Lord Jesus the fullness of God here body
[2:10:32] was in him hey hallelujah
[2:10:35] everything that could be named had to
[2:10:36] bow every demon had to be cast down
[2:10:39] everything had to be defeated and they
[2:10:41] know that same God so that was God as as
[2:10:44] a higher form of deliverer just from
[2:10:46] physical slavery now that heals the
[2:10:48] deliverer from from from sin from death
[2:10:51] from unbelief holier because now we're
[2:10:54] was dead traced by the sins but we've
[2:10:56] been quickened to life hallelujah so
[2:10:58] we're not just freed from a physical
[2:10:59] slave master I mean we've been we've
[2:11:02] been freed from the slave master the
[2:11:04] true one which is the devil which is and
[2:11:05] hallelujah see he says and it'll produce
[2:11:11] the same thing it did when it was
[2:11:13] manifested in the true son of God we'll
[2:11:15] do the same thing in the adopted sons of
[2:11:17] God I mean it's why you read through the
[2:11:19] book of Acts Devils will cast out the
[2:11:20] demons were defeated religious spirits
[2:11:22] were defeated why because what was
[2:11:24] manifested and the Sun is now manifested
[2:11:26] in the bride amen it'll do the same
[2:11:29] thing in the adopted sons of God for
[2:11:32] jesus said the works that I do shall you
[2:11:34] do also if his life is in US it'll
[2:11:36] produce the same hallelujah it will
[2:11:39] produce the same amen and if it does
[2:11:42] something contrary to Scripture then
[2:11:43] it's not the same angel but if it
[2:11:45] produced the same life that it was when
[2:11:48] it was here on earth manifested in flesh
[2:11:50] and promised to be manifested again in
[2:11:52] the same way then is the same spirit
[2:11:54] same God by the same word see what I
[2:11:57] mean now then you can base your faith
[2:12:00] that it's the truth and of the tens of
[2:12:02] thousands of visions around the world
[2:12:04] I'll ask anyone at anytime to show me
[2:12:06] already ever failed it doesn't fail it
[2:12:08] cannot
[2:12:09] well hallelujah was the same God now
[2:12:14] brother Brad would speak now now I want
[2:12:16] to go so I'm kind of jumping back and
[2:12:18] forth I want to go to why the fire fell
[2:12:20] again now we understand a few you know
[2:12:25] the first coming of Christ is a
[2:12:27] forerunner John the Baptist who
[2:12:29] introduced the people to the Messiah the
[2:12:31] word manifested and that produced a true
[2:12:33] Pentecost that's the pattern amen
[2:12:37] so now we're living in a day we'll have
[2:12:40] had a four-runner come he introduced us
[2:12:42] to the word the Messiah Jesus Christ and
[2:12:45] that has produced a true Pentecost to
[2:12:47] the bride
[2:12:48] it means that's why we can see because
[2:12:49] we've been restored back to the original
[2:12:52] faith of the fathers that's why when you
[2:12:53] read the book of actually so actually
[2:12:55] I've seen that happen I've seen that
[2:12:57] life manifested and when you read when
[2:12:59] when the Apostle Paul's describing like
[2:13:01] charity how its long-suffering is kind
[2:13:03] you know it doesn't rejoice in iniquity
[2:13:05] you know that's divine love you actually
[2:13:06] see actually that nature's in me
[2:13:08] hallelujah because he's describing the
[2:13:10] life is now in you amen so so what and
[2:13:14] and so that is from what a true
[2:13:15] Pentecost how this or the bride and and
[2:13:18] and I'm sure you could just say well
[2:13:20] you're just describing my experience we
[2:13:22] have had a true Pentecost
[2:13:23] I mean we're enjoying a true Liberty
[2:13:26] hallelujah so so he says in the Pergamon
[2:13:29] church age he says now and he says I
[2:13:33] want you to be very careful here and see
[2:13:35] this God has promised it at the end time
[2:13:37] Malachi 4 is going to be fulfilled it
[2:13:40] has to be four it's the the spirit
[2:13:42] quickened Word of God spoken by the
[2:13:45] Prophet Malachi Jesus referred to it it
[2:13:47] was just before Christ comes the second
[2:13:49] time by the time Jesus comes all
[2:13:52] scripture must be fulfilled the Gentile
[2:13:54] dispensation will be in its last church
[2:13:56] age when that messenger of Malachi comes
[2:13:59] he will be right with the word he will
[2:14:02] take the whole Bible from Genesis to
[2:14:04] Revelation he will start at the serpent
[2:14:06] seed and carry on to the messenger in
[2:14:10] the latter rain so I'm gonna pick up on
[2:14:15] that later but but notice he says and
[2:14:16] he'll carry co-star from the serpent
[2:14:18] seed and they will continue on to the
[2:14:19] messenger in the latter rain now who's
[2:14:22] the me
[2:14:22] during the letter rain that's Jesus
[2:14:24] Christ himself right so you start at
[2:14:26] 7:00 seeker all the way to the message
[2:14:28] so so what do you'll do you start at
[2:14:29] 7:00 see the original sin you go all the
[2:14:31] way until finally he introduces Christ
[2:14:33] to the people in the latter rain I'm
[2:14:35] gonna go into that soon he says but
[2:14:37] he'll be rejected by the denominations
[2:14:39] he has to be for that as history
[2:14:41] repeating itself from the time of a hab
[2:14:43] Israel's history under a hab is
[2:14:45] happening right here in America whether
[2:14:48] we're the prophet of Malachi appears as
[2:14:50] Israel left Egypt to worship and freedom
[2:14:53] pushes out the natives rises up a nation
[2:14:55] with great leaders like David etc and
[2:14:58] then putting a have on the throne with
[2:14:59] the Jezebel behind them to direct so
[2:15:02] have we done the very same in America
[2:15:04] our forefathers left this land to
[2:15:06] worship and live and freedom they push
[2:15:08] back the natives took over the land
[2:15:09] mighty men like Washington and Lincoln
[2:15:11] were raised up but after a while other
[2:15:13] men of such poor caliber succeed these
[2:15:16] worthy men that Sooners and a hab that
[2:15:18] was sit in the presidential chair with
[2:15:20] the Jezebel behind him to direct them as
[2:15:22] in such a time as this that the
[2:15:25] messenger of Malachi must come then in
[2:15:27] the latter rain will come a Mount Carmel
[2:15:29] showdown watch this carefully now to see
[2:15:32] it and the word John was a forerunner of
[2:15:34] Malachi 3 he planted the full former
[2:15:37] rain and was rejected by the
[2:15:39] organizations of his day Jesus came and
[2:15:42] had a Mount Transfiguration showdown the
[2:15:44] second forerunner of Christ will sow for
[2:15:47] the latter rain Jesus will be the
[2:15:49] showdown between the Dunn denominations
[2:15:51] and Creed's
[2:15:52] for he will come to back up his word and
[2:15:54] take his bride in the rapture the first
[2:15:57] showdown was Mount Carmel the second was
[2:15:59] about Transfiguration and the third will
[2:16:01] be Mount Zion and that's the bride
[2:16:03] that's a showed us of God so Jesus will
[2:16:05] come and he will he will back up amen he
[2:16:09] will back up his word and take his bride
[2:16:11] in a rapture now so I spoke there about
[2:16:15] you know how he'll he'll carry on to the
[2:16:18] messenger in the latter rain now let's
[2:16:20] go to the book of Joel because we're
[2:16:22] going to just we're going to continue up
[2:16:24] from where where Peter was referring to
[2:16:29] we're just going to read from verse so
[2:16:32] Sauron we're in Joel 2 and we're going
[2:16:35] to read from verse twin

[2:16:43] man we're in a good time hallelujah
[2:16:46] remember this is the Lord's doing this
[2:16:48] is the Lord's doing it's not any man's
[2:16:51] doing this is God says no this is the
[2:16:53] season I'm gonna gather my seed which is
[2:16:56] part of my word and they will manifest
[2:16:57] the promise of the day and that's why
[2:16:59] you feel the pull you do I mean that's
[2:17:02] why you feel the pull you do because
[2:17:03] God's wanting you to see you're part of
[2:17:05] my word you are the prophecy of Spago as
[2:17:07] manifested in you hallelujah so he sits
[2:17:12] in Joel 2 and 21 he says fear not o land

[2:17:46] be full of wheat and the fat shall
[2:17:48] overflow with wine and oil let's just
[2:17:51] let's just stop there for a bit
[2:17:52] so saying that he will give us the
[2:17:54] former rain moderately and he'll cause
[2:17:56] to come down for you the rain the former
[2:17:58] rain and the latter rain and the first
[2:18:00] month now this this former rain if you
[2:18:03] look into the Hebrew it means a teaching
[2:18:05] rain or the early rain I mean so so
[2:18:08] brother bear as he said in this but
[2:18:09] spoken words the original seed he said
[2:18:12] now that Billy Graham and all robots
[2:18:13] have sowed for the World Council of
[2:18:16] Churches and they have but then he said
[2:18:18] that the evening messenger will show for
[2:18:20] the bride and he has holy that's why
[2:18:23] that's why the word that you hear
[2:18:25] gathers you to one or two places either
[2:18:27] it will bind you with the tears which
[2:18:30] has happened or it will gather you into
[2:18:32] the garner but it all depends on what
[2:18:34] seed you are I'm in the condition of we
[2:18:36] you're gathered to us based on the seed
[2:18:38] you are but remember you know all that
[2:18:40] country or no wise cast out because what
[2:18:42] does the devil attack who you are oh you
[2:18:45] think you're a Christian you think
[2:18:47] you're part of the Bride you really
[2:18:48] think you know what is he attacking
[2:18:50] attacking who you are the devil will
[2:18:53] never tell you you got to make it I
[2:18:54] believe you'll take a rapture oh I just
[2:18:57] I just can't do nothing to you he will
[2:18:59] never tell you those things he always
[2:19:01] say do ya yeah it's like if thou be the
[2:19:03] Son of God if they'll be and the thing
[2:19:05] is you don't need to prove anything to
[2:19:07] the devil I mean because remember when
[2:19:09] when Jesus were he received the Holy
[2:19:12] Ghost he goes into the wilderness right
[2:19:14] and then the devil tries to get him to
[2:19:17] use his anointing I mean for his bidding
[2:19:19] for the devil's bidding if thou be the
[2:19:21] Son of God turn these stones into bread
[2:19:22] he's trying to get the Son of God to
[2:19:25] follow the devil's leadership I mean but
[2:19:27] that is never that was never the purpose
[2:19:30] of God abiding in him he says now I've
[2:19:32] come to do the Father's will I mean so
[2:19:34] the Father's will wasn't the clown for
[2:19:36] the devil hallelujah and so the devil
[2:19:39] comes ucsf they'll be the Bride of
[2:19:41] Christ if they'll be will this wouldn't
[2:19:43] be this way and change this and fix this
[2:19:44] no no you don't need to clown for the
[2:19:47] devil you don't need to answer his
[2:19:49] accusations amen our husband is the one
[2:19:52] who answers the accusations the Word of
[2:19:55] God silences the devil honey you don't
[2:19:57] need to climb from you don't need to try
[2:19:59] and back up anything God does the
[2:20:01] backing up hallelujah he's the one who
[2:20:04] does the backing up a mess is like Moses
[2:20:06] when when Koren dayson came against them
[2:20:08] you know you say you're the only holy
[2:20:10] one God says if I just separate yourself
[2:20:12] you don't need to debate you don't need
[2:20:14] to argue amen and then Moses system if
[2:20:17] God does a new thing and opens up the
[2:20:19] earth swallows you up he'll show you
[2:20:21] who's on whose side Moses didn't do
[2:20:24] anything God did it and the world the
[2:20:27] earth swallowed them up hallelujah God
[2:20:31] does the backing up sometimes we think
[2:20:34] why aren't you why aren't you backing me
[2:20:35] up God he's backing you up but he has to
[2:20:39] faith has to be tested right and faith
[2:20:43] worketh patience say Lord you called me
[2:20:45] in the beginning you called me for a
[2:20:47] purpose member this message is a
[2:20:49] bridegroom call and the bridegroom
[2:20:51] callers to it to a marriage parlor it's
[2:20:54] not just a general blanket call though
[2:20:55] it's two individuals why'd he go to the
[2:20:58] woman the well he didn't say well I want
[2:21:00] to go to Samaria you know he said he
[2:21:02] says I have reason to
[2:21:04] and those for her else for the one of
[2:21:06] the well it wasn't just for everyone
[2:21:08] he didn't just work our maybe that's an
[2:21:10] open place maybe I'll preach here maybe
[2:21:12] I'll said no he went to that well for
[2:21:14] her hallelujah and that's why the wood
[2:21:18] came your way for you not for just
[2:21:20] everyone
[2:21:21] there's elected group upon the earth I
[2:21:23] mean and the reason that this message is
[2:21:25] spoken to you is because he's saying
[2:21:27] you're mine you're part of me you're not
[2:21:30] part of the devil you're not part of
[2:21:31] this world you're part of me and I want
[2:21:33] you to recognize your identity is in me
[2:21:36] the living word it's not in anything
[2:21:37] else that's why you don't fit nowhere
[2:21:39] else holy that's why he said I don't fit
[2:21:42] anything else that says God is trying to
[2:21:43] get you you belong to me I died for you
[2:21:46] on Calvary I took care of your son I
[2:21:48] took care of your shame I took care of
[2:21:50] your guilt I mean just rejoice and just
[2:21:52] accept it hallelujah he took care of it
[2:21:55] remember even before there was a devil
[2:21:57] the the lamb was slain before the
[2:21:59] foundation of the world
[2:22:01] hallelujah so that's why I came because
[2:22:03] it's a bridegroom call there's a reason
[2:22:06] he doesn't just want you to be excited
[2:22:07] he just doesn't want you to just get
[2:22:09] religious noises I'm here to meet you
[2:22:12] and not just me you and leave you I'm
[2:22:14] here to walk with you every step of the
[2:22:16] journey though you may not feel me I'm
[2:22:18] there
[2:22:19] hallelujah because remember this walk of
[2:22:22] faith isn't just a waste cloud dine
[2:22:24] rejoicing some people say I wish we
[2:22:26] could just camp you know your have camp
[2:22:28] all the time that would be glorious but
[2:22:30] there's no overcoming and character
[2:22:32] development at camp right God pours
[2:22:35] himself out the fire falls he consumes
[2:22:37] the sacrifice we have a Jubilee
[2:22:38] witnesses now just walk now walk and
[2:22:41] I'll prove myself in your everyday life
[2:22:44] I mean when you don't have the answers
[2:22:46] you know another way to go I'll show you
[2:22:48] hallelujah I mean that's why we've just
[2:22:52] got a we just got to walk with God when
[2:22:55] you're rejoicing when you're not
[2:22:57] rejoicing don't go by how you feel the
[2:22:59] devil you know this world is a
[2:23:01] supercharged on emotion everything
[2:23:03] pander to the flesh but God says no
[2:23:05] that's not faith doesn't work by emotion
[2:23:07] sure you be you can compute become
[2:23:09] emotional but don't be condemned because
[2:23:12] you don't feel anything but don't be you
[2:23:14] know just just walk with God your faith
[2:23:16] is not by
[2:23:17] turn your emotion your faith is because
[2:23:19] God gave you faith God reveal themselves
[2:23:21] you God called you out faith is a
[2:23:23] revelation hey it's not trying to work
[2:23:25] something out you know it's there I mean
[2:23:28] it's just like we went to Eastbourne you
[2:23:29] say had Peter and the South Island you
[2:23:32] couldn't see it but we've seen it amen
[2:23:36] if you were taught the South Island Z
[2:23:38] you'd maybe doubt because you couldn't
[2:23:39] see anything but if you've seen it it's
[2:23:41] been revealed you know it's there holy
[2:23:44] but if you've been taught you say well
[2:23:45] are you Toby it was there I don't see it
[2:23:47] there yeah that's not faith faith as you
[2:23:49] know it's there irrespective if you see
[2:23:51] it or not
[2:23:52] hallelujah amen so now he says that the
[2:23:57] former and latter rain will run together
[2:23:59] this what we read okay so it's just like
[2:24:02] brother had seen spoken where the
[2:24:03] original seed he says Billy Graham or
[2:24:04] Robert sowed for the World Council of
[2:24:06] Churches it's happened the evening
[2:24:09] messenger Malachi for will so for the
[2:24:11] bride and it's happened hallelujah so
[2:24:15] now that that form of rain has fallen B
[2:24:18] says that the former and the latter rain
[2:24:20] will run together and this latter rain
[2:24:22] is the harvest rain it's the quickening
[2:24:24] rain hallelujah so now we are living so
[2:24:27] now we are living in a time where the
[2:24:30] formulator rain are running together I
[2:24:33] mean that's why you know I was sitting
[2:24:35] at camp and I don't know if the I don't
[2:24:36] know what service was are sitting in the
[2:24:38] back and I don't know if there's the
[2:24:39] right word by saying this message is
[2:24:41] evolving not in changing to something
[2:24:44] different it's the same word but even if
[2:24:47] you go back like brother Han do you
[2:24:49] think of the first convention we went to
[2:24:50] it was wonderful but it wasn't compared
[2:24:52] to that one because it's a different
[2:24:54] season it's not because the speaker is
[2:24:56] better or the world no it's a different
[2:24:57] season with God as God is pouring
[2:25:00] himself out in a greater way because
[2:25:02] he's getting his people ready
[2:25:04] I mean hallelujah for a body change and
[2:25:06] you just happen to be living in the
[2:25:08] season and God and why was Kemper
[2:25:11] why was camp such a blessing because you
[2:25:13] were there you individually were there
[2:25:16] that's what that's why God poured
[2:25:18] himself it wasn't easy for someone else
[2:25:20] it was for you individually hallelujah
[2:25:23] so the former rain and the latter rain
[2:25:26] are running here is the quickening rain
[2:25:28] so he says now
[2:25:31] because that's why I said so he'll start
[2:25:34] with he will start with the serpent seed
[2:25:38] and Genesis go from Revelation and then
[2:25:40] he will carry on them to the messenger
[2:25:42] in the latter rain so that message on
[2:25:44] the letter eNOS Christ Himself coming to
[2:25:46] the bride to give her a rapture in faith
[2:25:48] so he says but he'll be rejected by
[2:25:50] desire by so now he says then and the
[2:25:55] latter rain will come a Mount Carmel
[2:25:56] showdown I'm sorry I've read that and we
[2:25:59] keep going down the same crisis but what
[2:26:00] about the true seed it will happen just
[2:26:03] as we have said the people of God are
[2:26:05] being made ready by the word of truth
[2:26:08] from the messenger to this age
[2:26:10] I mean why cause we've been restored
[2:26:12] back to original Pentecost this message
[2:26:14] is Jesus Christ the Messiah when the
[2:26:16] word has manifested that is Messiah to
[2:26:18] the aged just like Noah Noah's message
[2:26:21] was the Messiah their age it was the
[2:26:22] Word made manifest he was told build a
[2:26:24] boat everyone gets in the boat though
[2:26:26] they'll receive salvation
[2:26:28] I mean why cause that word was the
[2:26:30] Messiah to the age where Moses came down
[2:26:32] into Egypt the people that followed that
[2:26:34] message what it was the Messiah the
[2:26:35] deliverer the savior to them of that age
[2:26:37] hallelujah Jesus is the Messiah I mean
[2:26:40] all the way down through the church age
[2:26:42] but it says the word as he is the word
[2:26:43] and when the word is manifested that is
[2:26:45] the Messiah to the age and so I want to
[2:26:47] receive Jesus receive the word I mean
[2:26:50] cuz we Greeks remember he's not a man of
[2:26:52] Galilee no more he is the Living Word
[2:26:54] amen and this message is the Word of God
[2:26:57] hallelujah that's why there's all the
[2:26:59] supernatural you hear the prayer lines
[2:27:01] God is saying this is me speaking this
[2:27:03] is me speaking this is me speaking
[2:27:05] hallelujah so we have confidence
[2:27:07] it's him speaking Amen so so the people
[2:27:12] of God are being made ready by the word
[2:27:14] of truth from the messenger of this age
[2:27:16] and her will be the fullness of
[2:27:17] Pentecost for the Spirit will bring the
[2:27:20] people right back to where they were at
[2:27:21] the beginning that is thus saith the
[2:27:23] Lord
[2:27:23] it is thus saith the Lord for what we
[2:27:26] read in Joel 2 23 to 26 be glad then you
[2:27:30] children of Zion and rejoice in the Lord
[2:27:32] your God for he has given you the former
[2:27:34] rain moderately and he will cause to
[2:27:36] come down to you come down to you the
[2:27:39] rain the former rain and the latter rain
[2:27:41] in the first month and the floor shall
[2:27:43] be full of wheat and the
[2:27:44] that shall overflow with oil with wine
[2:27:47] and oil why do you think they you know
[2:27:49] the word gets her rich way the fats
[2:27:51] overflowing the floors are full of wheat
[2:27:53] Polly we we're not just having a little
[2:27:56] lettuce leaf trying to get by now we've
[2:27:57] got a buffet I mean boy it's the Lord's
[2:28:01] doing the wood comes open where it's not
[2:28:03] some abstract egg no more it's tangible
[2:28:05] it's real it's applicable it's living
[2:28:08] hallelujah see we're just living in this
[2:28:11] day oh yeah I'm glad amen and I'll
[2:28:16] restore to you the years of the locust
[2:28:18] has eaten the cankerworm the the
[2:28:19] caterpillar and the Palmer worm my great
[2:28:22] army which I send among you and you
[2:28:23] shall eat and plenty and be satisfied
[2:28:25] thank you Lord and and praise the name
[2:28:29] of the Lord your God who has dealt
[2:28:31] wondrously with you and my people shall
[2:28:33] never be ashamed now it says God is
[2:28:36] going to restore the Lutheran age did
[2:28:38] not restore the church at started a
[2:28:39] Reformation the reason an age did not
[2:28:41] restore the Pentecostal age did not
[2:28:43] restore but God has to restore for he
[2:28:46] cannot deny his word this is not the
[2:28:48] reason Rick's of the church it is the
[2:28:49] restoration God will take the church
[2:28:51] right back to Pentecost at the beginning
[2:28:53] now notice in verse 25 it tells why we
[2:28:56] need a restoration the the locust
[2:28:58] cankerworm caterpillar and palm worm
[2:29:00] have eaten all but the root and but a
[2:29:02] small bit of the stem now we are told
[2:29:05] that all these insects are all one and
[2:29:08] the same in different stages that is
[2:29:10] right they are the Antichrist spirit
[2:29:12] manifests in an organization
[2:29:14] denomination and false doctrines through
[2:29:16] the through the ages and that poor
[2:29:18] little root and stalk is going to be
[2:29:20] restored God isn't going to plan a new
[2:29:23] church that's going to bring his
[2:29:25] original planting back to original seed
[2:29:27] he's he's doing it as it started in
[2:29:30] verse 23 for by the teaching of former
[2:29:33] rain next will come the harvest or
[2:29:35] rapturing faith he says and those things
[2:29:39] are running together hallelujah
[2:29:42] this just happens to be where you are I
[2:29:44] mean were wise God pouring out his
[2:29:46] spirit way he's giving us rapturing
[2:29:48] faith I mean the things that we hear
[2:29:50] they're teaching we hear a min is now
[2:29:52] that later rain is coming on top of us
[2:29:54] is not its quickened and it's brought
[2:29:56] the harvest as we
[2:29:57] here it that's why God does such a quick
[2:29:59] work in people's life in these days why
[2:30:01] cuz he's bringing the whole harvest up
[2:30:03] to maturity hallelujah I mean some
[2:30:07] people they've been in the message forty
[2:30:08] years has taken them forty years for
[2:30:09] someone who's been in a year to come to
[2:30:11] the same stage
[2:30:12] why cause it's God's doing it's not our
[2:30:15] doing it's not because people are
[2:30:16] smarter now no dumber back then no it's
[2:30:18] God's doing hallelujah he's bringing
[2:30:21] heat because he is bringing a
[2:30:23] restoration because he wants his bride
[2:30:25] to be mature once we made in his image
[2:30:29] hallelujah now we he sees in Christ and
[2:30:36] miss you God revealed he says there has
[2:30:38] to be a message at the end time where
[2:30:40] there is nothing else can follow what
[2:30:42] the fruit is in the top of the tree and
[2:30:44] the light is shining on that
[2:30:45] predestinated fruit and she is ripening
[2:30:47] into christ-like fruit so saying now
[2:30:50] we're living in a harvest season
[2:30:52] hallelujah Edna and the fruit ripens on
[2:30:55] the top of the tree because the light
[2:30:57] shining on it it's not the tree deciding
[2:30:59] I'm sick of winter I'm going to I'm
[2:31:01] going to bring forth fruit no it's the
[2:31:02] conditions of the season come right and
[2:31:05] in the life that's in the tree comes
[2:31:07] forth as fruit and we turn now we're
[2:31:09] living in a harvest season right we're
[2:31:11] living in a time where now fruit is
[2:31:13] coming out why because the sun's come to
[2:31:15] a certain height in the sky the soil
[2:31:17] temperatures no longer I see is now the
[2:31:19] right and now the life is coming back it
[2:31:21] was hidden in the trunk during the
[2:31:22] winter now comes forth how it doesn't
[2:31:25] just doesn't just grow leaves a
[2:31:27] fellowship but now a fruit is coming
[2:31:28] under those leaves of fellowship
[2:31:30] hallelujah and that is the season that
[2:31:32] we're living in you just happen to be
[2:31:35] alive during this time hallelujah
[2:31:38] hallelujah so this is God's doing you'll
[2:31:43] see because you understand if we're
[2:31:45] living in a time full restoration

[2:31:57] not oh you should keep pressing in until
[2:32:00] God gives you all hallelujah
[2:32:03] that's that's what we need to do amen
[2:32:06] because because we don't want to live
[2:32:08] below our privileges we have god-given
[2:32:10] proof
[2:32:11] and we should live according to those
[2:32:12] privileges hallelujah

[2:33:19] tells you you should read the Bible when
[2:33:21] was the last time you read it where was
[2:33:23] the last time you prayed you should pray
[2:33:24] I thank you mr. devil yes I'll take that
[2:33:26] boy no here is this yeah your promise he
[2:33:29] says there's no point did you get
[2:33:30] anything it's not what you remember
[2:33:32] did you catch what he is saying in their
[2:33:35] message it's not what you remember
[2:33:36] you're feeding the inner man you're
[2:33:39] feeding this guy you're not feeding this
[2:33:40] guy right so just feed on the word read
[2:33:43] listen pray sing the right car yesyes
[2:33:46] sing spiritual Psalms
[2:33:48] sing a melody in your heart was that
[2:33:50] creating a right atmosphere the devil
[2:33:52] the devil always gives us trouble and
[2:33:54] worry and stress he never gives us peace
[2:33:57] but he wants us to be all caught up in
[2:34:00] things and worrying about things
[2:34:01] remember worry never helped anyone faith
[2:34:05] can deliver worry never delivers so
[2:34:08] don't worry about it turn your worries
[2:34:10] into prayer turn your burdens into
[2:34:13] prayer father turn your frustrations
[2:34:15] into prayer because remember we're God's
[2:34:17] workmanship member before there was a
[2:34:19] worry
[2:34:19] there was a lamb
[2:34:21] before there was strife and stress there
[2:34:23] was a lamb and before there was trouble
[2:34:25] there was a blood highly and their blood
[2:34:27] was shed in the mind of God before you
[2:34:29] ever had a worry hallelujah
[2:34:32] so you know God's not going to kick us
[2:34:34] out because we got worried or mind
[2:34:36] battles he knew we would have these
[2:34:37] things but he already provided a lamb
[2:34:39] before the battle he already provided a
[2:34:43] victory before the fight hallelujah so
[2:34:47] just keep walking with God don't be
[2:34:49] intimidated by nothing I meant just like
[2:34:52] brother cadre city you know someone's
[2:34:54] got a problem with you and you avoid
[2:34:56] them you're actually giving them charge
[2:34:58] over you and it's like anything in this
[2:35:01] world comes in a timid age he tries to
[2:35:03] attack you don't let it rule you I mean
[2:35:05] let the word of God rule you don't be
[2:35:07] intimidated by nothing although the
[2:35:08] devil does all kinds of things don't
[2:35:10] worry about it just keep walking with
[2:35:12] God hallelujah feed on the Word of God
[2:35:16] amen
[2:35:17] and just keep walking you say well I
[2:35:19] didn't get anything out of it you'll
[2:35:20] find you'll find you say well I didn't
[2:35:23] get anything out of that and then you're
[2:35:24] walking with God and then that would
[2:35:26] just comes forth when you have need of
[2:35:28] it you know it's like brother Baron
[2:35:30] speaks about people and your own army
[2:35:32] training you'll put a big pack on carry
[2:35:34] all these things and many of the
[2:35:35] recruits they don't know the purpose of
[2:35:37] it and they're trying to crawl under a
[2:35:39] machine gun and the machine guns trained
[2:35:40] a certain height it doesn't shoot any
[2:35:42] lower they're doing all this training he
[2:35:44] says no but but they will think they're
[2:35:46] drill sergeants when they're on the
[2:35:47] battlefield and they actually have to
[2:35:49] put those tools into practice that
[2:35:51] training into progress they would have
[2:35:52] hated the drill sergeant when they're in
[2:35:53] training but they would have thanked
[2:35:55] them when they're fighting in the
[2:35:56] battlefield I mean so many times we say
[2:35:58] what's the point of remembering this
[2:35:59] what's the point of listening a break
[2:36:01] you'll need that equipment one day I
[2:36:03] mean we're in urina battle hallelujah
[2:36:05] then comes that scripture then comes
[2:36:07] that quote then comes that song and you
[2:36:09] can use it hallelujah amen to fight
[2:36:11] whatever you're going through and you'll
[2:36:13] say it was worth it listening to that
[2:36:15] message it was worth it singing our
[2:36:17] songs
[2:36:18] it was worth reading the word hallelujah
[2:36:21] just keep pressing on friends keep
[2:36:24] pressing on I remember the God that made
[2:36:26] us at camp is the same God here he'll be

[2:36:30] leave thee nor forsake thee Hollis you
[2:36:33] didn't leave we didn't leave
[2:36:34] our lakes the reason he is here is
[2:36:36] because we went there
