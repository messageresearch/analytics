and that's what I'm going to do this morning so I salute you I love you I love you too God bless you so if we could stand to our feet this morning um and we could just turn to the book of Ephesians uh chapter 2 um and uh I don't know how do I I I heard that you guys got some new technology here so oh yeah do I just um cuz I'm justed to using the clicker so I see there some iPad thing okay okay so if I want to go next I just click next from the end okay wow okay so um Ephesians um chapter 2 I'll just read I've got a few verses here so I'll read from verse four Hallelujah um so it says here um but God who is rich in Mercy for his great love wherewith he loved us even when we were dead in sins hath quickened us together with Christ by grace you are saved and ha raised us up together and made us sit together in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus then verse 10 is really the one that I want to get to it says for we are his workmanship created in Christ Jesus unto good works which God hath before ordained that we should walk in them yeah let's just pray once more Lord uh We've read your word and uh we just my God just hand everything over into your hands and we ask that you just lead even thinking of brother Ben oh God I'm not sure exactly the time differences or time zones but Lord when he's going to minister if he ministers Lord you just take full control there as well in Jesus name amen God bless you you may be seated this morning in the presence of God um so um I I I got inspired by a young a young man um uh um a couple of days ago um he had put up a status update on whats and uh it really it inspired me so it it sort of that that thought came to me uh we are in the hands of the master designer yeah am but my title that I've got here this morning is press the battle yes sir just keep pressing Hallelujah we are in the hands of the master design Hallelujah Lord so I I seen this is that right yeah I seen that um uh on on a WhatsApp status and uh if you can see it it's got some master Master designer on the left there and he's designing something as you can see he's designing something and on the right it really sort of just shows what he's designing and I'm not really sure what you call it Josh um but it's some kind of cabinet right that uh that he was putting together and uh I was I was looking at it um and I thought wow how powerful you know what I love is that we we we we can see God in the little things we can see God in the natural things and when I was just seeing this WhatsApp status come up I looked at it and I seen God and I seen myself and I seen God as this this designer this master designer um and and and it made me gave me such a confidence that to know that that that that I am in the palm of his hand yeah and that what whatever I'm going through in life as long as I believe I'm surrendered to him Lord he's taking me and whatever he's he's designed for my life uh I believe you know as I'm surrendered to him he's um he's he's doing something right and so so so uh when you look at this right on the left is the design and and and on the right it's part of the the the output of whatever is being designed on the left now if you look at it on the right hand side it doesn't really look exactly like what's on the left which is the design but if you look at it on the right there is work in progress there's there's there's things that still needs to be done yeah to that uh that that pieces of wood that needs to come together to make a beautiful cabinet but on the left hand side the designer has designed it and he's got this picture in his head and right now when we look at that thing we'll think no man it's not that's not what the designer designed but that thing is a work in progress and I looked at that and I see yes I seen a piece of wood they right but I seen Tas and I seen this year is Tas and his work in progress my God the great designer has got great plans for T but there are things that still needs to happen in the life of Taz maybe there's going to be some uh you know grinding or heavy sandpaper that's going to have to come across there and really send things down and it's going to if that piece of wood was um you know if it was alive and you take that sandpaper it might hurt it but there is a there's there there's an end product Hallelujah that this designer had in mind Lord and I want to see I think he said it will take about a week to get this thing completed now once it's completed I want you to send me a photo of it okay I want to see the outcome but you know when I looked at that I thought wow I am so grateful that I am in the hand of this master designer and I am you know for those of you that was at the camp you know for for a while this word called surrender it's just been so has been my my my theme of wanting to con stantly Just Surrender to almighty God I was I was um telling I was telling the young people I think it was last week or two weeks ago I was telling them that you know that word surrender to the world out there it's a it's a word of weakness it's it's a word that says you know what I'm giving up in I'm Giving Up on things but to a Christian that is surrendered to almighty God there is so so much power that comes with that it's a song that says the more that I Surrender the lighter my load the more that I just release of myself the more he takes control and that is what I want and the desire of my heart so I just thought I want to drop this in that we are in the hands of the master designer amen now brother Brandon would come sorry I can't read from there I lost my glasses I'll just read from here brother Brandon says that he is the designer so as you sitting here this morning he is our designer he knows what it takes oh yes sometimes we get we get faced with situations we get faced with life we sometimes question things but he is in control he knows what it takes for you and me to get to the next next level with him Hallelujah because you know that is what we do right as Christians as message Believers of this open book yeah amen we grow and and and we surrender so it says our design is well dressed in the power of his resurrection he is walking amongst us today in the um in the power of his resurrection he knows what it takes to put a church in Rapture order he knows it so what he wants from you and me just surrender to him and allow him to take us and to mold us and he takes us through schools of you know experiences but he's getting us ready this this this this this revealed word which we call the message of the hour is come and it's getting us into a condition to get out of the place so he says he he designed it he put the parts together here in the Bible so if you want to know what's happening in your life and and then you get confused it's all yeah right but I think I might have said it last time we need Revelation divine revelation from God that's right as we read his word and he reveals it to us we can then identify ourselves in the word and identify that he is putting the parts together here in the Bible and he says yeah just let the current flow through it which I believe is the spirit of Christ and he says and watch it operate let faith in his promised word of today flow through and you will see how it operates and I know I am preaching to the quiet here because the choir knows what we're talking about you see when we read these kind of quotes it's not just quotes that we read and we you know we can't we can identify with what we read amen and if there someone here yeah online wherever and you can't identify with what you're reading because I was there one day right many years ago I would read the quotes for the andd and I couldn't place myself there but God by his divine grace he came the way of tar and he opened up my understanding and he revealed himself to me and that's when I read his word I read these quotes I see myself and I identify with these with with these words he designed the thing he designed his church by the word yeah that's right that's what he puts together not by Methodist or Baptist or Presbyterian or Pentecostal organization but by his word and you know it's so important that we've got to recognize that it's by his word amen and the more we recognize that and and and we realize that it's the word that's coming and and just bringing about changes in our lives and just molding us and transforming us we want to subject ourselves to the word we want to just surrender to him okay so I thought I wanted to just drop this in this morning um I I heard a a brother fact I heard two ministers um refer to this and I thought I wanted to just um touch on this sister hope Brenham you know brother brother Brenham would tell us in his life story of how you know the the life that he lived and uh the situations that he went through and the decisions that he had to make and uh you tell us about his his wife sister hope and you tell us how um you know things happened and she got terribly sick and uh he got the news that she's dying and how he would come to the hospital and if you go and read it in this in the life story you you you would talk about um you know he'd come there and and they'll actually tell him no you know don't don't don't don't don't go in there Ball but but he says you know I want to I need to go and see her so he says he would go he would go into the into the into the room where she's laying and he says that she's laying on the bed and she's got this sheet over her head because she had died and uh he says he's he's he's standing there and he's saying Lord I he puts his hand he puts his hand over over a fored he says and um he says Lord you know I so much desire to say goodbye to my wife and he says he says I put my hand on the head and I said oh God please now this is a man that's standing there and he's he's he's broken he he's man he's gone through hell and he's he's got he's got a he's got a a daughter I'm not sure if the daughter had died yet but it's just his his his whole life is just like collapsed around him and he's standing here in front of his wife and and and he says oh God you know I I let me tell her goodbye and uh she's there and you know brother I I believe brother brandom I believe the things that he says and and and and so she's laying there and she's dead but he's he's talking to the Lord he says Lord let me tell her goodbye I don't want her to go without telling her good will you help me dear God he says if there's any forgiveness in your heart will you just let me say goodbye to her yeah and and this is the desire that brother brand a man and and and God is so gracious if if we for those of us that that knows the the the events uh God allowed brother brandham to call his wife back now what I want what I want to just highlight here is sister hope brandom she stepped over so she went into Glory yeah and she came back from Glory right when brother brandom called her and then when she came back she then said said these few words and then she went back into glory amen so now if you read through what brother Brandon would say you you'll pray and he he'll call he'll say hope hope and then she'd come she he said she'll she turned over and she looked at him and he says you'll never forget that um as long as he lives he said and and he said the the words that she used was B why did you call me back mean then then and and and that in itself is just so astounding and and and and and even when she said those words he said what do you what do you mean hope and then she says bull you've spoken about it you've you you've preached about it heaven and and and then and then they start to talk about then she goes on and and in the next in the next slide can I can I get the clicker I struggle with this thing so I didn't um I like I like to walk with the clicker so she says she says thank you thank you for com is done I don't think it's working you fix it for me um so yeah so yeah he he calls her back and and and she says she says um you know B why did you call me back and then she she they they start having this conversation and then she says B I was being taken home she says um uh some angels like was going down and thank you let me just see this yeah she says B I was being taken home and she she so she talks about her experience on the other side you know and she she says you know it's it's just so peaceful and this is where we're going right and and I'm I'm purposefully it's it's just so peaceful she says a great Tropic and said the big birds was flying from tree to tree she says and then then brother B BBY looked at her in the way and she says now don't think I'm beside myself so she

that that's that's what my title is Right press the battle just keep pressing we are in the hands of the master designer now I'm going to go to the next one right just want to talk a little bit about on the other side and why why are we here what we contending for hallelujah we're not just here to be in church and to have a good time and to sing good songs but we are here because there's there's the man I'm going on the other side Hallelujah I'm I'm I'm going to make it brother Andy and I'm grateful to almighty God that he's provided away through this precious message Hallelujah of the hour that's taken that's turning my heart back to the word amen so brother Brandon would say I was going to read this here he says in the rejected King he would talk about he says um he says I I I I heard something keep saying you're just starting press the battle just keep pressing he says I shook my head a minute and I thought well you know maybe I never really heard it you know a person can get sometimes imaginations and I said I just probably imagined that but he says it said again press the battle keep going I I said maybe I said that he says and I put my my lips between my teeth and put my hand over my mouth he says and hear it come again and it says just keep pressing amen amen if you only knew what was at the end of the road and I want to leave that and encourage you with that this morning keep pressing situations will come trials will come the things of Mind battles will come yeah but just keep pressing amen allow the master designer to take you and just to move you in the direction allow him to take that coarse sandpaper and maybe sand you down cuz maybe we need that yes it's worth it yes sir Hallelujah Hall it is worth it that's right it's worth it ah and then he says he says I don't want you to miss this and when brother bandam says and this is in the rejected King remember the brandom says I don't want you to miss it I take note I don't want to miss this he says it has changed me that experience I can't be the same brother brandham that I was he says I heard that voice says keep you just starting press the ble keep pressing and and and then it goes on he says the voice says who you like to see beyond the curtain of time and obviously for the Bram says yes I'd love to and then sorry that that that picture is from um it's a YouTube video where somebody had Illustrated that and he says um uh he says it wasn't like any Vision that I had and he says and I looked and yeah he he's given this experience of of stepping beyond the curtain of time and the Lord I believe allowed this to happen so that he could come back to tell you and me that this is real that it's not just good words not just a figment of our imagination but this is a a living reality Hallelujah there's a land beyond the river that we call the sweet forever my Lord Jesus and he goes on and he say talks about you know um how how he sees these people coming and they just he says just loveing my precious brother he says young men in the Brilliance of Young Manhood the eyes glistening looking like stars on a darker night he says the teeth is white as Pearl and grabbing me and screaming my precious brother this is the reality that we brother Phil are contending for man I you know i' I've just said you know what I don't care what's happening around me yes I've got to pla my potatoes and yes I've got to do this and yes I've got to do that but this word is of vital importance in my life Hallelujah I am totally totally sold out amen I'm sold out to this message of Grace I I I I I love I love my Lord Jesus amen I love him so much and he he knows it and I'm not just saying this to make you think you know but the Taz loves the Lord man the Lord knows it he sees my heart man yeah he says he talks about even sees hope there how she hugs him and then he says he says oh and and and if you read through it right in rejected King and these other parts where he speaks about it he sees himself laying there on the bed yeah and he says oh would I ever want to go back to that caucus again and it made me think of Hope when she said BR why did you call me back and bull I love you I love your children but I'm going back bull I'm going back and she and he says would I ever want to go back to that old caucus again he says and then I heard the voice that spoke to me and says this is what you preached was the Holy Ghost and man brothers and sisters Believers and friends this is what we are receiving and I am grateful for that man he says this is perfect love and nothing can enter here without it and you know what I looked at that and I thought sometimes we look at ourselves and we think man only perfect love can enter there and we look at ourselves and we think sometimes how we get upset with this one and how we know our sometimes our attitudes and our emotions and things but I am so thankful that you and me we are in the hands of the master designer and he's working on me and he's changing me so that when I step over onto the other side p will be perfect loveall he says I am more determined than ever in my life that it takes perfect love to enter there he says there was no hallelu jealousy there he says there was no jealousy there no tiess no sickness just just one Joy he says he says there's no word to speak it friends he says it's perfect perfect he says in fact he says perfect wouldn't touch it Sublime he says there's no English vocabulary that I know no word at all that could ever express what it is it's beyond anything that I know there he was he say there was no sickness no joy it was just perfect just perfect and then he says friends you mustn't you mustn't miss it and I want to just drop that here with you and me don't miss it let's allow the word we sang that song about healing at the table of the Lord and I believe that through his word he comes and he reveals to us amen areas is cu remember he's working on you and me there's changes that needs to happen in our lives and he said brother brandom says friends you mustn't miss it so I I want to encourage you as we're going to go on he says and I I thought I wanted to drop this in with sister hope and brother brandom going beyond the curtain of time and uh and and and and just to let you know that we're not just coming to church amen just to come to church that's right just to get it's good to come to church it's good to gather together like this and to meet each other and to fellowship and to encourage each other but there's more to it than just coming to church there's a life that we there's life that's being released to you and me as we sit amen in the meetings as the word of God because we don't just have any words the the people out there the churches out there they've got the same Bible that we read come on but the grace of God James has come your way and has taken this Bible and has opened it up to you and me and it's it's it's taken us so deep into this word hallelujah and as it takes us deep into the word it affects the depth of our lives and our growth with the Lord Jesus thank you Lord so keep Hallelujah pressing the battle amen you are in the hands of the master designer amen allow him just to take you and to mold you and don't allow the enemy to preach to you and to tell you about the thing that you've done or the disappointment that you've done before the Lord or the failure or the mistake because when we make we we make mistakes we do things sometimes that's wrong we slip and we fall but he has made a way of Escape he has made a way for us to get up from wherever we think we are and to get up and to say father forgive me brother forgive me sister forgive me and then we can grow in Grace hallelujah thank you Lord Jesus because only perfect Perfection can enter that place amen and our perfect Master designer is working on me and is working on you that's my slides and I thought I wanted to drop that in this morning just allow the designer to take you and to mold you amen because you see our God is a god of promises yeah am yes he's a God that sticks to his promises if he's promised you something Lord he will do everything that he can and he will to honor the promise that he made to you yes Lord and to me amen and I'm grateful for that because there's many many promises in this Bible that belongs to me and I want those promises for me and my God my God has promised these precious great and precious promises for T and he's a God that sticks to his promises God in the message God keeps his word brother Bram preached the sermon God keeps his word yeah and that is the god that you serve he keeps his word god was determined to bring Israel out because he promised that he'd do it God has to keep his word now if you want to know where God promised it I'm not going to go into the detail of it but you can write this down Genesis 15:13 God tells Abraham that certain things are going to happen and he also says um that you're going to be you know in bondage for a couple of years but afterwards you will come out with great substance so God promise them that yeah things are going to happen but I am going to deliver you amen so God is a God that sticks to his promises Hallelujah and then brother bham goes on and says and there's going to be a church appear before him without spot or without wrinkle and I'm looking at that church a portion of that church this morning he says regardless of what we do and how much chaos we get into God is able of these stones to rise up children unto Abraham and I I wrote a promise here Ephesians 5 brother the scripture says that he might present to himself a glorious church and I'm looking at that glorious church this morning not having a spot or wrinkle or any such thing but that it should be holy and without blemish and we look at ourselves sometimes and we think man I don't measure up to that but I believe that you see when God looks at you and me he looks at us through the blood and he sees perfect Perfection he sees you perfect and uh that says you know not having a spot that that word spot is not having any fault or any moral blemish amen and that is what God has promised you and he's promised me a glor church with no faults no blemish he says now this God right so he's promised us these great promises he's promised us Perfection he's promised us adoption he's promised us a body change he's promised us a Rapture a catching way he says now I want you to notice when he finally got the Church on the Move talking about Israel children of Israel and they determined then to follow he says great signs and wonders took place and if you go and read the scripture Genesis Exodus you know you um you'll find about things that that that that took place he says on the road out there they were taking God at his word and that's what you and I are doing right as we walk walking this walk you know to towards our who wrote that someone wrote that song I'm walking towards my body change we walking right in a certain direction and uh he says on the road they were taking God at his word they left everything behind and they went on their Journey he says now it's a very strange thing that God would put his children to such a test as soon as they made the first move so we know they they they left Egypt but then he says they came to this uh uh blockage called the Red Sea now brother bam drops this in he says I say this for the benefit of those he says many lost night who accepted Christ he says don't expect the road to be a flowery bed of ease now to those seasoned Christians here today you know what I'm talking about I mean I I I I look at my life and I say Lord man the things that I win I was talking to brother um some some ministers uh uh a couple of days ago and I was saying and I say this to the to the young I'm still a young Minister but I say this to the younger younger ministers um it's not a Glory Road to minister it's not easy I mean it's easy to come into just takes take words and quotes and just throw it off and make you go crazy right but there's a life that goes with usely am and I believe and I I I say this wherever I go I believe that God has placed gifts in the body and you can sit here right remember it's not just about t standing with a minister standing here and preaching the word you can sit here and you can discern yeah so you can see by the test and I tell people I say Lord help me to be sincere help me to be to be honest to to to be open as much as I can and just to allow you to use the gift on my life Hallelujah but what I want to tell you is that especially the young ministers that it's not easy because the Lord takes you through experiences that man you don't want to go through that's right I mean as as I stand here and I I was now the other day I was sitting and I was just looking back on my life and I said man the things that I had to go through where times when you would feel sorry so broken and times when and I've never ever really reached a point where I want to give up but there are times when you just you feel so man it's like man it's so hard to move forward but it's through those times where he comes and he he he he heals you or he he helps your hearts of your heart is broken emotionally you are just you just finished but he comes and then he he picks you up and then he he takes you and he just you know puts that ointment over you just to soothe you and to help you to heal so I just want to drop this into the and I know there's some beautiful wonderful young Brothers here that's that that's in the ministry just allow yourself to be surrendered Hallelujah and the Lord is going to take you also through schools of experience but when he does that just walk under the atmosphere of surrender to him because you know as I I I've discovered this right where you're going through something it's so hard and it seems so impossible to break through but the more that I Just Surrender and that in itself is hard but it's possible the more that I just surrender to him I find him he just takes me and he helps me Hallelujah through that and then when I look back and I say man T how did you manage to come through that and then you realize that is nothing but the grace of almighty God and then I look back and I say Lord as much as I did not enjoy it I am thankful because you have taught me so much so that's why I can come here and I can stand and I can speak of an experience where I've seen what he's done in my life so brother Bram says you know for those new Christians who accepted Christ he says don't expect a flowery bed of ease it's going to be a rough and a rugged road but remember this he promised that he will be with you there was a time when brother brandham needed to hear those words where you know the the the devil was coming and telling him a whole lot of nonsense and then he says then I heard the most sweetest voice that says the never failing presence of Jesus Christ is with you and I want to just drop that over you this morning don't forget that doesn't matter where we find ourselves he's there somebody actually used this words and I hope it's okay for me to say this you know how it is sometimes we find ourselves caught up in addictions now there's there's drug addictions and there's all sorts of addictions and and one of the big things I've discovered actually in in in in the message sort of community or is is where the devil is really hitting a lot of people is pornography addiction and um and and you know and you look at that and you say Lord you know and and people that you know people that are addicted to things they they don't want to do it they they they they they want to get out of it but you know then they just get sucked back in but somebody actually use the words and says even in your addictions he's there yeah so it doesn't mean that you know so you failed God and you miserably failed him now the devil uses that and says now you cannot talk to him because he's an Angry God who did wrong so even if you go to him he's not going to listen to you don't listen to that lie from the devil come on now because he's lying to you when we make a mistake come on get up amen and if you can't get up in that state you say Lord help me amen help me Father Hallelujah I'm I'm weak but I need your strength name Jesus say if there's anybody even on the live stream here this morning and you you maybe find yourself in an addiction and you you you you you you think that because of that now God doesn't want to hear you he's a god of love am he doesn't condone the addiction he doesn't condone and and say you know oh it's okay for you to do that no but he loves you amen he wants to get us out of that he wants us to grow amen so I don't know where that came from maybe somebody needed to hear that don't let the devil tell you that God will not listen to you he's a father that loves you Lord I mean just think of it think just think of it bring it to the Natural I've got my children and I mean i' I've got I've got teenagers in my home and it's uh kind of toughy for those of you that's got teenagers it's not easy it's not easy and I know I know of stuff that my kids are doing and they think that you know we don't know but God has given us discernment Hallelujah right we we we we know things but the Lord has also given us wisdom yeah that we don't just fly off the handle and just go and fight and just go crazy so we know what's happening there but the Lord gives us Grace because as a father you love your children amen and you want the best for them amen so you want to you can you see there's a problem and it's just it's you you because God is matur us we can look at that and say you know what I was there I know what it's like you still at a at a level where you haven't matured yet but as a father and as a mother we are there to help you so sometimes even my kids and they probably will listen to this as well when when when we see things and we we discern things the Lord gives us Grace to help them without them knowing that we're helping them with that situation so I say Lord give us as parents that Grace and just just that ability to use wisdom when dealing uh with our children and dealing with things so I want to repeat myself if we find ourselves down there the devil will tell us God doesn't want to hear you I want to cancel that in the name of Jesus Amen I want you to know God loves you amen they are if you go through the quotes of brother Bradon the sermons he would meet people that think that they have just reached the end of everything there's no Grace for them but I want you to know that the grace of God is available amen just call out that's all we do Hallelujah call out brother Brandon says if you notice as soon as they got started and left Egypt on their Road they were following the word of God by the letter following the prophet following the angel of the Lord following the pillar of fire trouble set in right away and they were brought to a place where there was no place to run but it's in those situations and you know this we go we see God steps on the scene and we see how he just moves things he either you would open up the Red Sea to allow you to go through through or he'll do certain things and when we look back man he's been there he's helped me it seemed impossible but you know God is God and you know what what I found out and and and if we just look at our lives and we've decided to follow Jesus we've we've we've made it our our you know uh our our our ultimate goal we are totally sold out to this message I am and I know you are I know I speak to many of you and I know you are totally totally totally sold out but we know that the enemy obviously wants to attack us he wants to fight us and what he does and I I just drop this in I won't dwell too much on it but what what I've noticed um is that you know he he he the enemy is making it so hard for us as Christians to be real Christians for us as Christians to just to to serve God freely yeah come on there's so many things that's that's happening around us yeah and we know that it's the God of this evil age that it's it's making it harder for Christians to uphold the principles of the Bible making it hard for Christians even to go and witness out there on you know and and uh the when we look at it and we look at there there's lots of laws and and I'm not going to draw draw too much on this but there there's lots of laws that that that that's coming in um and and if you look at it and and if you you sort of see the spirit behind it you realize that these laws that's coming in it's aimed at you and it's aimed at me you are being targeted because we have decided to follow Jesus um in this open book am that's right so so so so you and I we are very important and we are very dangerous yes in the sight of the enemy that's right you see he hates you and he makes no bones about that that's right because he knows that when you get a true revelation of who you are then he's got to go and he realizes if you know who you are that you then will realize and know that you have an authority over him amen but he doesn't want you to know that so he tries to put you under a pressure that's right you now I I'm going to drop this in and I'll move on spirits don't die now I said what's happening in the world is that there are laws and it's Global you know what what they call it this woke woke culture kind of thing right so there are laws there's these things happening right and laws are being put into place to get to you and to me and you realize that it's obviously evil spirits at play and if you go into the book of Daniel now I won't I won't go into the detail of it but Daniel chapter 6 you will find that same Spirit there is at work today because if you go to Daniel chapter 6 and you just go and read through it you will find that there were people they wanted to get to Daniel because they hated Daniel because of the stand that he took for the word of his day Hallelujah and what they did they went to the king and said oh King live forever d d all these things and said King maybe you should make a decree that anyone that you know uh that that that comes up against uh you know whatever this law is will be casted into the Den of Lions so I encourage you for homework whatever when you go home go and read Daniel chapter 6 and then you will find out that that what happened there it's happening today am so I just thought I'll drop that in but the enemy wants to crush you he wants to prevent you from coming to that realization of who you are and I'm going to repeat myself but this revealed word as I'm reading it it's telling me who I am brother Brandon would come and you use that word it says that you and I we are becoming a Powerhouse right and then if we go into the scriptures and we and we read and we discover that even nature nature creation is waiting for you and me to step forward amen that's right so if you go to Romans I'll read this Romans 8:19 it says for the earnest expectation of the creature wait for the manifestation of the sons of God for we know that the whole creation granth and to and travaileth in pain together until now yes so creation Brother Andy is waiting for you and me as Sons and Daughters of God to step forward amen and to serve our purpose Hallelujah to step into our position amen nature is groaning come on creation is groaning for you and for me in fact that word expectation it refers to an anxious impatient and eager and persistent expectation that is what nature is under nature is anxious oh boy because n you see nature remembers oh yes where it was come on now so I wrot here said nature knows what it had in the beginning before the fall and he's groaning to go back to that yes nature is groaning for the manifestation of the sons of God because nature knows that you and I brother the AR we hold the key yeah that's right to they return back to that Perfection because that was a perfect world where Adam had Dominion you and nature knows what it was like Hallelujah come on and nature is groaning and under and anxious and a persistant expectation for you and I to step forward amen and the key so I said we hold the key and and I believe one of that Keys is and this word is coming to show us who you are who I am and that's why it's so important that we sit like this that we receive the word that we pull and we say Lord speak to me father I want to know who I am so nature knows and I'm was going to read something nature knows that there will come a time where you will no longer need to just quote the quotes right and say brother brandham said this and brother brandham said that even you might not even have to pray but you will be able to speak like Adam remember the Brandon would dramatize with how Adam would speak to the tree and say you know what can you just move that way or you know speak to this and nature knows that you hold that key and you you you will just speak go forward and heaven will back up what you say now that brother arand is what's happening within us but we need need to walk under that atmosphere of appreciation number one obviously and just of surrender to him because this word is training you and it's training me and it's preparing us and it's it's molding our characters and the more we die of ourselves the more he loves and the more he takes control see the problem with man is man has forgotten who he is but this word is taking us back this message is turning our hearts and is coming and reminding us who we are that's right stir up so this is a glorious time hallelujah amen yes there's so many crazy stuff happening out there but this is a glorious time for the Bride of Jesus Christ and I am looking at her this morning that's right amen and you might not maybe maybe you might not see it now and you might not understand it but the more you feed the more you feed on him oh yes the more he reveals and the more he shows you the Glorious time that we are in amen that's right you see our focus is not on what's Happening out there amen yes we are aware of what's happening out there and yes the world is getting more and more evil and yes things are going crazy and yes the laws of the country is happening but our focus is what is happening within us our focus is on this revealed and precious word which I call we call the message of the hour this message is it's it's it's doing doing something with in I wrote to you I said it is this revealed word that is showing us who we are and it's guiding us through this crazy world and showing us how to overcome amen that's right because we can overcome yeah amen you are Overcomers that's right don't let anybody tell you anything different don't let the friends tell you the devil you can overcome this revealed word this message is showing us how to GA us in our homes how to you know Simple Stuff how to rear and how to teach our children how to fight against the powers of Darkness it's teaching us how to grow it's showing us how to mature am Jesus says be ye therefore perfect this message is showing us how to attain Perfection amen but this message wants us to subject ourselves to God to this revealed word and as we do that um he's leading us amen into that direction Hallelujah you see we heard about Joshua right and the halls of Jericho that fell we read it in the Bible we read about Joshua that spoke to the Sun and said Son stand still in fact he also spoke to the moon and said Moon you do this we heard of Moses right who commanded the Red Sea to open Moses who called for flies he he called for frogs he he spoke the word yeah and nature obeyed him impossible but true amen amen we read about an Elijah this is all in the Bible right who stopped the rain and then he called for rain yeah that's right we read about and this was Elijah a man the Bible says of light passions like you and me yeah who got angry who gets upset but this man was so surrendered to God that he was able to do what we thought was impossible Hallelujah Elisha who parted the Waters of Jordan and and he he he made an iron ax head that dropped to the bottom he got that thing to swim go read in your Bible he performed which we think as man that's impossible but he proved that what's impossible to man it's possible with God Amen you know and for if you bring it down close we he we read about a William brandham that per formed exploits of Faith a William brandom that would speak to a fish that has been dead for a few hours and Speak Life into a dead fish and that fish would swim away a a a William brandom that God gave the the the grace to speak squirrels into existence amen a a a a a a humble man that would go into the home of of sister hatti right and because hatti right said the right thing yeah could say hatti whatever you need right now you tell me you'll speak it a man that could speak to the storm so all these things are things that we think is so impossible to men but these things which I mentioned they are all witnesses to show the possibilities of God in you amen because we know that William brandham was the first wave sheave to show that there are more coming yes amen that's right but these were men and women like us like you and me yeah that's right people that had their ups and downs yeah they had their disappointments like we do they had their victories was it Elisha it got so angry one time he called for she Bez to come and kill children little kids and all they did was they were making fun of the man of God and he got upset so this word and all these things that we read about Joshua and Moses and Peter and Elijah and brother brandham and there are so many other testimonies of today that God allows us to experience to let us know that there is something within you and me that that that can at some point just step forward and I I'll close it shortly you know I wrote you I said and this is this for me is one of the big things right now that that the Lord is dealing on me with me on I wrote here it's it's about surrender and I I spoke this at the camp as well and I bring it you again it's about surrender it's about just giving myself over to him and the more I give myself to him the more he shows me who I am and I I wrote you actually I said The more you surrender to this revealed word it can lead to what and I wrote it here I said it can lead to that super anointing yes now brother Brandon will talk about the super anointing and I I'll read that and we'll begin a musicians can come as well and we we'll finish off here shortly but brother Brandon would would talk and I'll just go through this he will he'll speak in my new ministry now remember my tit is press the battle just keep pressing we are in the hands of the master designer so brother brandom would talk about in my new ministry and if you haven't listened to it I would encourage you go and listen to it he speak he speaks a few things and he says now um and here he's talking about you know the the the Squirtles that God allowed him to speak into existence he says you know you know how people can doubt he says but you want to be sure you don't want to do anything unless you are positive and then you know what you're doing he says I rubbed my face a little and I looked perfectly eyeshot and he says so I went down on the side of the hill and I said Lord it is written in your word that the mouth of two or three Witnesses let every word be established I said if that was you forgive me of my stupidness but I pray that you give me another squirrel like that and I said then I'll believe you that it's you and the devil won't have any room to say that it just happened that way so he had spoken a squirrel and he shot it and he was a bit confused he says just in a moment he says here comes that I call it brother brandham says super anointing he says it it swept over again and I was almost off my feet and brother bam heard these words say what you will and it will be given to you now this is brother Brandon and the Lord is showing him what is possible but also showing you and me what is possible he says and I said there shall be another young fox squirrel sitting right there and I took my finger down and looked around through the woods and looked back and there sit the fox squirrel looking right at me again brother brandham says I shot that one and picked him up and brother brandham says how was trembling so God allowed brother brandham to experience this and then he goes on and he says now he goes to the home of of sister hatti right and and and and he's giving he's giving the testimony and now I know that you know these things right but some I just felt in my heart just to bring this back to your remembrance and just to remind you about these beautiful realities of God he says he's sitting in the home of sister hatti and he says I'm he's giving this testimony and his sister Hatty is sitting there crying and she didn't say a word and he said and she said as brother Brandon was talking she says that's nothing but the truth so she's heing brother brandom giving testimony and her attitude said Lord Brother brand that's nothing but the truth and God appreciated that attitude Hallelujah and I say Lord help us to have an attitude that you will be pleased with amen especially as the word Goes Forth as the word is being preached Lord let me have the right receiving attitude and she said the brother brandom says she said the right thing and then he makes reference he says just like Banks said down there and I want to go look at what banks said and Banks and and his brother and brother Brandon was on that boat and that fish was laying dead on that water and Banks and his brother was testifying and they said that they want to go and testify to somebody about the grace of God and God was pleased with that so I say Lord help us to say the right thing Hallelujah but I believe that we need to what will help us is walking under that atmosphere of surrender Amen to our Lord Jesus Christ and brother bam says she said the right thing just like bang said down there I Heard a Voice as it swept from my ears like up into the hoods Mrs Wright sitting back there with a little girl was trying to interpret what e said I couldn't hear Mrs wght brother bam says and when haty right said that that's nothing nothing but the truth brother bam says and that super anointing swept over me and said tell hatti that she's found Grace in the sight of God now I believe it was more than just what sister Hatty wght said yes that was important but it was what was going on inside of them because it's easy for us to to say stuff but hat right sat there under an atmosphere and an attitude of surrender to God and she's hearing these awesome things and she's saying brother the plum that's nothing but the truth and God sees her heart God hears what she says and says tell hatti that she's found Grace in the sight of God tell her to ask whatever she wants and for those of us that know what happened there brother Brandon told you you could have you can ask for a million doar and it will be there but you see hatti had the heart of a mother she had the heart of a parent and her desire like all of us as parents her desire was the salvation of her children Oh Glory and because was hatti right had the right even a surname so the right attitude Hallelujah God was so pleased with the right attitude that he swept in and he said hatti yes's a blank check whatever you want Hatty it's yours and my Prophet will speak it and it will happen she said the right thing amen she surrendered to the word that she heard and she benefited amen from that yes I say Lord help us as we pressing the battle as we knowing that we are in the hands of the master designer help us help us to walk under that atmosphere of surrender and to receive the word to agree with the word and to say that is nothing but the truth the musicians you you can come you know I'll I'll just finish I'll just say this one few things here I want to just encourage you this morning keep pressing on we thought we thought that 2023 was hard and it was hot it was crazy if if I should ask each one of you how was your 2023 I know that a lot of lot of you will say it was it was hot and 2024 it will not get any easier but I believe that as we just allow him to take us in to just move us in the right directions and as we just continue to surrender he's going to help us navigate um this is word I used this this maze that we call life but he's helping us to navigate through this maze that we call life and there will come times when we're just going to feel man it's so hard when you feel like that just remember the never failing PR presence of Jesus Christ is with you amen he's there and I hope it's okay for me to say this but he's there even in people's addictions he's there you see we are in an awesome season we are in an awesome time we are in a season of the rapture we are in a season season of adoption and these are awesome words but but but but there's so much power Behind these things we we are in a season of perfection and and and and you know especially to the young people if you if you sitting here right and and and and you hear these things and and and and and you don't understand you know just you just say Lord I need revelation because it's him that comes and he will reveal to you as an individual where we are and he will reveal more of himself to you and to me and the more he reveals the more Taz wants to surrender so in closing press the battle stop press the battle The Voice told brother Brandon just keep pressing I'll just read that and I'll close it with this he says just keep pressing if you only knew what was at the end of the road and right now this word is showing us what's at the end of the road what we can look forward to so I trust in the broken up way that the Lord just allowed me to speak to you this morning Hallelujah that you will just keep pressing keep supporting each other keep on encouraging each other we need each other I read a quote one time where the brandham said um he was at a church and uh he said I heard the pastor say that people need encouragement and I thought and I read that I thought yes that's so true we need each other we need to encourage each other we need we need to show each other that we are there and regardless of I was listening to a testimony of a brother that was really struggling a brother from Zimbabwe he said he used to get together with some brothers they used to go pray up in the mountains but he says what they agreed was before they would start praying they would have a little conversation amongst themselves and they would in that on that mountain with the four or five of them that would be a safe space for them so they would speak to each other and they would be honest and totally honest and tell each other about the problems and the struggles that they face but what they agreed was we're not going to go and take your story and blast it out there but we're going to take it and we're going to pray pray together for each other and that brother would say how that helped him to get deliverance from a few things that he was struggling with so I encourage you you are a very encouraging Church you are a very encouraging group of Believers but let the Lord just continue to take you wherever you are let him take you higher amen and God bless you Hallelujah love you very much you can see my heart if I could take it out you'll see you'll see how much we love you let's just [Music] pray Lord Jesus we just so thankful this morning to have had this opportunity Lord just to speak your word and Lord just the burden that's with in me and uh I'm grateful that you came to show me Lord God that I must just be me and I must just be surrendered to you and just allow you to use me in the way you know how to use me so I'm grateful for that this morning I just want to pray Heavenly Father for this local assembly Lord you know the needs that's in this place you know the struggles you know God lord every individual that's here and I I just pray
