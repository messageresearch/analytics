[52:04] having predestinated us unto the

[52:22] through his blood the forgiveness of
[52:23] sins according to the riches of his
[52:25] grace
[52:26] wherein he hath abounded toward us in
[52:28] all wisdom and prudence
[52:29] having made known unto us the mystery of
[52:32] his will
[52:32] according to the good pleasure which he
[52:34] hath purposed in himself
[52:36] that in the dispensation of the fullness
[52:38] of times he might gather together
[52:40] in one all things in christ both which
[52:42] are in heaven
[52:43] and which are on earth even in him in
[52:46] whom also we have obtained an
[52:48] inheritance being predestinated
[52:50] according to the purpose of him
[52:51] who worketh all things after the council
[52:54] of his own will
[52:55] that we should be to the praise of his
[52:57] glory
[52:58] amen who first trusted in christ
[53:02] let's bow heads in a word of prayer this
[53:04] morning lord jesus
[53:06] how great you are lord lord we marvel it
[53:09] lord the things you do
[53:10] lord we marvel at you and your greatness
[53:12] oh god your great mercy that you've
[53:14] extended towards us lord we're so
[53:16] thankful that you
[53:17] have allowed us to receive it dear god
[53:19] and we just want to pray father this
[53:21] morning may just come anoint the service
[53:23] lord may anoint every heart oh god take
[53:25] all doubts of
[53:26] whisper whispering doubts and troubles
[53:29] away oh god i pray that there will be no
[53:31] room here for the devil to work
[53:33] but lord may you work oh god may you
[53:35] have all liberty all
[53:36] all room to do what you want to do in
[53:38] this service lord we want to thank you
[53:40] lord that lord we're still
[53:42] feasting in our hearts of what you did
[53:44] at camp but lord we want to thank you
[53:46] you're not
[53:46] lord limited to that geographical
[53:48] location but lord
[53:50] you would never leave us nor forsake us
[53:52] dear god i just pray you just meet us
[53:54] the same way you meet us at camp oh god
[53:56] a very real way lord we just want to
[53:59] submit ourselves under your
[54:00] hand oh god take the service now lord
[54:03] may you speak and may you
[54:04] also be the hearer in us oh god grant it
[54:07] father we love you with all of our
[54:09] hearts and we thank you lord
[54:10] in jesus christ's name amen amen god
[54:14] bless you friends you may have your
[54:15] seats i just want to
[54:16] take a um take a small thought from
[54:19] from verse 4 if you want to put it up
[54:22] there but it says that
[54:24] that we should be according as he has
[54:27] chosen
[54:27] us and him before the foundation of the
[54:29] world that we should be
[54:32] holy and without blame before him in
[54:35] love so this is god's purpose before the
[54:37] foundation of the world
[54:38] that he was going to have a people that
[54:40] would be holy
[54:41] and without blame before him in love now
[54:44] i'm so glad god knows all things
[54:46] amen he knows all things you know
[54:48] there's not there's nothing he doesn't
[54:49] know
[54:50] see he knows how good he knows how bad
[54:52] he knows our weaknesses he knows
[54:54] our strength you know he knows
[54:55] everything about us but yet he would
[54:57] make us in such a way
[54:58] that we would stand before him without
[55:01] blame
[55:02] there's no blame hallelujah amen so yeah
[55:05] i just
[55:06] i just pray by the time we walk out
[55:08] these doors we just say glory
[55:09] you know we rejoice and we just
[55:11] appreciate more what he has done for us
[55:13] amen so
[55:14] but we must understand that we're living
[55:15] in a day that there that there would be
[55:18] the manifestation of the sons and
[55:19] daughters of god there'll be a revealing
[55:21] of the sons and daughters of god
[55:23] and we know if we go through the book of
[55:25] revelation that book of you know
[55:27] revelation it means an unveiling
[55:29] so something that's hidden something
[55:31] that's already there but it needs to be
[55:32] unveiled
[55:33] just like a artist would would would
[55:35] paint a picture and i've been to
[55:37] one of brother nathaniel proviso's
[55:38] unveilings of his paintings and they're
[55:40] a real masterpiece
[55:42] you know and you know there's so you
[55:43] know there's a big canvas you can see
[55:44] the size of it he paints paintings like
[55:46] this kind of size there's a curtain in
[55:47] front of it
[55:48] but it comes to be the unveiling and you
[55:50] can kind of guess what's behind it but
[55:52] when it's finally unveiled you can see
[55:53] his
[55:54] you can see the heart of the artist
[55:56] manifested in his handiwork and it's the
[55:58] same with a statue
[55:59] you know they'll put a sheet over a
[56:00] statue maybe give a speech pull the
[56:02] pull the um sheet off and before the
[56:04] sheet comes down you can kind of guess
[56:06] what it is
[56:07] but then finally when it's unveiled you
[56:09] can see it and all of its
[56:11] glory all of its you know how great it
[56:13] is whatever you know and it's the same
[56:14] thing with us you know
[56:15] we came into this world veiled right
[56:18] there was a potential under
[56:20] under the veil there's a potential i
[56:22] mean that that wasn't manifested upon
[56:24] the earth but it was there
[56:25] i'm so thankful that when we meet the
[56:28] lord we don't become a son then we
[56:30] already were sons and daughters
[56:31] i mean but by you receiving the holy
[56:33] ghost god is acknowledging to you you
[56:36] are my child
[56:37] you are my son you are my daughter and
[56:39] i'm proving that you are my child
[56:41] by giving you my spirit amen it says in
[56:44] galatians because we were sons
[56:46] not because we became but because we
[56:48] were sons we received the holy ghost
[56:50] hallelujah so so there is a people upon
[56:52] the earth down through even down through
[56:54] time you can go
[56:55] you know from from genesis to revelation
[56:58] and we know we're living in
[56:59] you know bible days but there's been a
[57:01] people in every age that have been
[57:03] veiled
[57:03] but then god takes the veil off of them
[57:05] and manifests what god has purposed them
[57:08] on the earth to manifest
[57:09] hallelu you can take david as a shepherd
[57:11] boy he's just a little shepherd boy but
[57:13] enemies to be a king
[57:14] i mean in him is to actually unify the
[57:17] tribes you have to take full possession
[57:19] of the promised land that's veiled in
[57:20] him
[57:21] and god pours the anointing upon him as
[57:23] a shepherd boy he begins to
[57:24] unveil what's in david remember david
[57:27] did not become
[57:28] king because he was anointed that
[57:30] anointing just
[57:31] manifested the kingship that was in him
[57:33] so it's the same thing with the bride of
[57:35] christ the anointing of the word comes
[57:36] upon you
[57:37] to bring out what's already in you
[57:40] hallelujah so it's like a seed you know
[57:42] you can a lot of people planting crops
[57:44] and so on in
[57:45] in a seed say a pumpkin seed that has
[57:47] the potential
[57:48] to grow pumpkins right but it's just
[57:51] sitting here on the desk it won't do
[57:52] nothing but we know within it
[57:54] it has potentials right to manifest
[57:57] what's within it but it needs it needs
[57:58] the right atmosphere needs right soil
[58:00] needs some moisture upon it
[58:02] and when the conditions are right it
[58:03] comes to life
[58:05] hallelujah i say the conditions are
[58:07] right in this age
[58:08] for a people who come to a full adoption
[58:11] i'm into the change of the body
[58:12] hallelujah
[58:13] i mean so i believe i'm looking at
[58:15] people and you know we have to really
[58:17] look at ourselves and say god i'm your
[58:19] workmanship
[58:21] i'm not my own workmanship one day i
[58:23] tried to be mine workmanship i just
[58:25] failed miserably but when i gave my life
[58:26] into your hands
[58:28] then you begin to mold me and shape me
[58:30] as as as you saw fit
[58:32] hallelujah and we are his workmanship
[58:35] amen so
[58:36] to be without without blame before him
[58:38] in love now
[58:40] from from the beginning when sin came
[58:43] into the world
[58:45] there's been a blame game the devil's
[58:48] been playing a blame game
[58:50] because you know let's just read in in
[58:52] revelations chapter 12
[58:55] uh very one of my well
[58:59] i have favorite scripture because i love
[59:01] to read where we triumph and the devil
[59:03] gets defeated
[59:04] i love to read those kind of things so
[59:06] devil this is your end
[59:08] this is my end this is your end you get
[59:10] off here
[59:11] and i go up here and you have to go
[59:13] there because your predecessor had to go
[59:14] there but i'm pretty decent to go up
[59:16] there
[59:16] oh look and that's just how it is do you
[59:18] like to read those things
[59:20] makes me feel good devil i know your end
[59:23] i'm just going to remind you one more
[59:24] time devil you're on to the lake of fire
[59:26] you're going to burn we're going to see
[59:28] thee it says and isaac narrowly look
[59:30] upon me and say is this the man
[59:32] is this the man that did weaken the
[59:33] nations is this really him this guy
[59:35] this guy is it really him that's what it
[59:38] says in scripture
[59:39] it's going to be manifested we're going
[59:41] to hallelujah
[59:43] but yeah when he's no more we'll be
[59:46] still going on
[59:47] we have no expiry date hallelujah
[59:52] hallelujah revelations 12 verse 7
[59:56] and there was war in heaven michael and
[59:59] his angels fought against the dragon and
[1:00:00] the dragon fought and his angels
[1:00:02] and prevailed not neither was their
[1:00:04] place found any more in heaven
[1:00:07] and the great dragon was cast out that
[1:00:09] old serpent called the devil
[1:00:11] and satan which deceiveth the whole
[1:00:13] world he was cast out into the earth and
[1:00:15] his angels were cast out with him
[1:00:17] and i heard a loud voice saying in
[1:00:19] heaven now has come salvation
[1:00:21] and strength and the kingdom of our god
[1:00:24] and the power of his christ
[1:00:25] for the accuser of our brethren is cast
[1:00:27] down which accuses them before
[1:00:30] our god day and night so there's a blame
[1:00:33] game
[1:00:34] that's been going on the accuser of the
[1:00:36] brethren they did this
[1:00:38] they did this here they thought this
[1:00:39] here they went into this there's a lot
[1:00:41] of blame game going on
[1:00:43] but there comes a time when the blame
[1:00:45] game comes to an end
[1:00:47] remember because we are predestinated
[1:00:49] that we should appear before him
[1:00:51] without blame and in love right we read
[1:00:53] that at ephesians
[1:00:55] so but notice this and they overcame him
[1:00:59] by the blood
[1:00:59] of the lamb and by the word of their
[1:01:02] testimony
[1:01:03] and they love not their lives unto the
[1:01:05] death therefore rejoice he heavens and
[1:01:07] ye that dwell in them woe to the
[1:01:08] inhabitants of the earth and the sea for
[1:01:10] the devil has come down unto you
[1:01:12] having great wrath because he knoweth he
[1:01:14] hath but a
[1:01:15] short time and you know what's good
[1:01:18] about time it comes to an end
[1:01:20] hallelujah so sure i'm just running out
[1:01:23] of time the devil's running out of time
[1:01:25] hallelujah glory what about you no i've
[1:01:29] got all day
[1:01:30] i've got all eternity i've got time you
[1:01:33] know
[1:01:34] oh boy i won't go into those kind of
[1:01:35] subjects you know with little children
[1:01:38] trying to get them ready you know they
[1:01:39] think they've got all day we've got all
[1:01:40] day
[1:01:41] the devil is running he's out of time
[1:01:43] but you see he's the accuser of the
[1:01:46] brethren
[1:01:47] right and if he if he has leverage on
[1:01:50] the children of god then he has a right
[1:01:53] to actually keep them under his dominion
[1:01:55] before sin came into the world adam and
[1:01:58] eve as
[1:01:59] one the man and the woman they had
[1:02:02] dominion over the earth
[1:02:03] this was their realm they were gods over
[1:02:05] this earth
[1:02:06] but then when sin came in the whole who
[1:02:09] was in charge the hierarchy were yo they
[1:02:11] were dethroned and the devil became the
[1:02:13] god of this world
[1:02:15] and since that time god has been
[1:02:18] rebuilding his people
[1:02:20] until finally there's a full restoration
[1:02:22] that adam's fallen race are no longer
[1:02:24] adam's fallen race
[1:02:25] but they are the redeemed ones of the
[1:02:27] lord and now they
[1:02:29] are back in full control over the earth
[1:02:31] now we know that that
[1:02:32] that control starts in us right it
[1:02:35] doesn't it doesn't start with the world
[1:02:36] first
[1:02:37] it starts with the people hallelujah so
[1:02:39] now when the devil was cast out of your
[1:02:41] life
[1:02:42] hallelujah that was just foreshadowing
[1:02:44] what god is going to do to this entire
[1:02:46] world
[1:02:47] right but it was just shown in you the
[1:02:48] devil remember when we were born
[1:02:50] the devil was in control of us right
[1:02:53] ephesians chapter 2 tells us
[1:02:55] that we walked we once walked according
[1:02:57] to the prince of the power of the air
[1:02:59] and and paul does not exclude anyone
[1:03:01] from that he's saying that's how we were
[1:03:03] but then god rich in mercy harley
[1:03:06] manifested himself to us showed us to
[1:03:07] where are his children
[1:03:09] and what happened he the devil was
[1:03:11] dethroned
[1:03:12] right and then god came down and he took
[1:03:14] up the throne
[1:03:15] in our hearts hallelujah so once we're
[1:03:18] under the anointing of the devil
[1:03:20] and we had no trouble really because
[1:03:21] there's no battle
[1:03:23] amen we led her yo we were led by him we
[1:03:27] followed him we did what he wanted us to
[1:03:28] do
[1:03:29] but then there became a rebellion you
[1:03:31] know some people say rebellion's a bad
[1:03:33] thing
[1:03:34] not always because the because the bride
[1:03:37] of christ is rebelling this is
[1:03:38] revolution
[1:03:39] this is revolution holy we are actually
[1:03:42] having a revolution against the devil in
[1:03:44] his control
[1:03:45] where are free people amen we have a
[1:03:47] constitution
[1:03:49] this is our bill of rights as our this
[1:03:50] is our declaration of independence
[1:03:52] amen and our god is here to enforce
[1:03:55] what's in the bill to us
[1:03:57] hallelujah so now no more do we have to
[1:03:59] be led by his spirit
[1:04:01] now more no more is there every strife
[1:04:04] hatred malice you know
[1:04:06] separation between brethren gossip yo
[1:04:09] the asset of gossiping
[1:04:10] and hurt and strife and trying to be
[1:04:12] better than other people and you know
[1:04:14] war and fighting and division that's not
[1:04:17] in my
[1:04:18] declaration of independence harley my
[1:04:20] dick declaration of independence tells
[1:04:22] me there are people come together one
[1:04:23] body
[1:04:24] amen many members but one body one
[1:04:27] spirit governs them
[1:04:28] doesn't matter how old how young where
[1:04:30] they're from hallelujah but one spirit
[1:04:33] amen by once we were baptized into one
[1:04:35] body
[1:04:36] hallelujah so now there's been a
[1:04:39] revolution
[1:04:41] glory hallelujah and that revolution has
[1:04:44] been going on
[1:04:45] until finally there's not a people that
[1:04:49] will
[1:04:50] you know moses could only take the
[1:04:51] people out of egypt
[1:04:53] but that fallen nature that was within
[1:04:55] them
[1:04:56] couldn't be taken out of them satan
[1:04:59] could still accuse israel
[1:05:02] but they've done this they've done this
[1:05:03] they've done this even though god
[1:05:05] instituted
[1:05:06] the blood of the lamb and bulls and
[1:05:08] goats had just covered sin
[1:05:10] and now those people who died in faith
[1:05:12] under that blood had to go
[1:05:14] into paradise and wait for someone to
[1:05:16] come and clear
[1:05:17] actually all of their sins away
[1:05:21] imagine you imagine what it'd be like in
[1:05:22] paradise
[1:05:24] you know you're waiting malachi comes in
[1:05:27] he prophesied of the forerunner then
[1:05:30] there's a 400-year
[1:05:31] gap of silence you know no doubt
[1:05:33] believers were coming in as well but
[1:05:34] then
[1:05:35] but then there's a big you know simon
[1:05:37] was in the temple as an old man
[1:05:39] i'm not going to die the lord showed me
[1:05:41] until i see the lord's christ
[1:05:43] then he sees him he says lord he picks
[1:05:45] them up says lord let thy servant depart
[1:05:47] in peace for i have seen thy salvation
[1:05:49] i don't know how much longer he lived
[1:05:50] after that but from the time that you
[1:05:52] know he saw jesus as a baby and
[1:05:54] when jesus came into his ministry he
[1:05:56] would have passed on
[1:05:58] so then he would have stepped into
[1:05:59] paradise hallelujah
[1:06:01] hallelujah yeah because they would have
[1:06:03] been talking here comes the seed of the
[1:06:04] woman and you know they would have been
[1:06:05] looking for that serpent bruiser to come
[1:06:07] and then here comes one in and says
[1:06:09] brothers sisters i've held him
[1:06:11] i've held him hallelujah came into the
[1:06:14] temple to be circumcised and the lord
[1:06:16] led me he told me that i'd see him and
[1:06:18] now i've seen him i picked him up
[1:06:20] hallelujah
[1:06:20] he's just in his infant form but he's
[1:06:22] going to become a man
[1:06:24] he's on his way harlow the expectation
[1:06:27] begins to build why because the blame
[1:06:29] game is going to be
[1:06:30] silenced harley the blame is going to be
[1:06:33] silenced and actually the one who calls
[1:06:34] it all is all going to end up on his
[1:06:36] head
[1:06:37] hallelujah amen yeah yeah and then and
[1:06:40] then no doubt john the baptist would
[1:06:41] come in
[1:06:43] because remember simon and then anna
[1:06:44] would have come in as well
[1:06:46] i was blind physically but spiritually i
[1:06:48] could see 20 20.
[1:06:50] harley and the lord led me right to his
[1:06:52] messiah
[1:06:54] hallelujah and and and i saw him just
[1:06:56] like simon did
[1:06:58] hallelujah and then and then john comes
[1:07:00] in they say who are you
[1:07:02] i was the voice crying in the wilderness
[1:07:04] to prepare the way of the lord
[1:07:06] and isaiah would have said hallelujah i
[1:07:09] saw you in vision
[1:07:11] hallelujah then you're manifested glory
[1:07:13] what happened i baptized him
[1:07:16] the spirit of god descended bottom like
[1:07:17] a dove the lord showed me that what
[1:07:18] happened i saw it no one else saw it but
[1:07:20] i saw it
[1:07:21] hallelujah oh my what kind of
[1:07:24] expectation we'll be building
[1:07:25] then finally the thief on the cross
[1:07:27] enters
[1:07:29] hallelujah where'd you see him he was
[1:07:31] hanging right there
[1:07:33] i saw the lamb how he is being offered
[1:07:35] he was right next to me and he said
[1:07:37] today you'll
[1:07:38] be with me in paradise and say well here
[1:07:40] i am here's paradise where is he
[1:07:42] oh boy and then the door comes open then
[1:07:45] the lord's presence walks in
[1:07:46] hallelu then he himself walks into the
[1:07:48] room hallelujah
[1:07:49] and they say this is the one we've been
[1:07:51] looking for he says children
[1:07:54] there was a lot of seen sin attributed
[1:07:58] to you
[1:07:59] the blood of bulls and ghosts covered
[1:08:01] but my blood's fresh on the cross
[1:08:03] hallelujah i've wiped it clean so now
[1:08:06] the accuser cannot blame you you're
[1:08:08] going to be presented to me without
[1:08:09] blame
[1:08:11] because it's taken care of hallelujah
[1:08:13] there rose up and they just had a
[1:08:15] rejoicing time
[1:08:16] if we could just recognize the condition
[1:08:18] we are in now
[1:08:20] irrespective of troubles and and and
[1:08:22] this guy that fights and
[1:08:24] and complexes whatever it may be
[1:08:27] i'm not talking about those things today
[1:08:29] i'm talking about the condition of your
[1:08:30] soul
[1:08:31] i'm talking about the condition of the
[1:08:32] real you hallelujah because remember if
[1:08:35] god thought of us before the foundation
[1:08:37] of the world
[1:08:38] he didn't think of us down on this earth
[1:08:41] with our hurts and our pains and our
[1:08:43] troubles no
[1:08:43] he thought of you as redeemed he thought
[1:08:46] of you and your new body
[1:08:47] olivia gathered around his throne that's
[1:08:50] how he thought of you
[1:08:52] glory hallelujah so if you think about
[1:08:55] it now
[1:08:56] if you've been if the lord has made you
[1:08:58] a new creature
[1:09:00] you receive the holy ghost you can say
[1:09:02] you say brother ben i
[1:09:03] have received the holy ghost his word is
[1:09:06] more than life to me
[1:09:07] doesn't matter yo yo it doesn't matter
[1:09:09] what his word says i believe it
[1:09:11] something in me says amen to this bible
[1:09:13] and something in me says i want to live
[1:09:15] this word by his spirit
[1:09:17] i'm a new creature hallelujah then
[1:09:20] what's happened
[1:09:20] you're on heaven's highway hallelujah
[1:09:24] and it don't matter what happens to this
[1:09:25] guy i mean because your soul is sealed
[1:09:28] in
[1:09:29] hallelujah you are already just like
[1:09:31] those in paradise saying hallelujah
[1:09:33] glory to the lamb you're in that same
[1:09:35] condition you've just got to catch up to
[1:09:37] where they are
[1:09:38] and these bodies will be changed
[1:09:41] hallelujah
[1:09:42] so i think we can walk out of here happy
[1:09:45] dan you think so
[1:09:47] amen so now now when the you know
[1:09:50] brother brahm says when the holy ghost
[1:09:52] came down on pentecost
[1:09:54] he says it was the abstract of the deed
[1:09:57] so an abstract deed means like if you
[1:09:59] want to buy a piece of property
[1:10:01] you ought to make sure no one else has
[1:10:02] claims on that land
[1:10:04] if they do you've got to sort out the
[1:10:06] dispute that's what the blood of jesus
[1:10:07] christ did because the devil said no
[1:10:09] these people are mine
[1:10:10] because they're born in sin i made them
[1:10:12] fall they're born with a fallen nature
[1:10:14] but the lord says no no my blood has
[1:10:15] purchased them they do not belong to you
[1:10:18] hallelujah you know we never did belong
[1:10:20] to the devil we were never
[1:10:22] ever his his we may be under were under
[1:10:25] his influence but we never ever belonged
[1:10:27] to him
[1:10:28] we've always been gods harlow you may
[1:10:32] have been up to hearing drugs out in the
[1:10:33] world you were gods
[1:10:35] you may have been up to hearing religion
[1:10:36] you were gods but then one day he found
[1:10:38] you
[1:10:40] hallelujah glory
[1:10:43] hallelujah you know
[1:10:47] we have something worth shouting about
[1:10:50] hallelujah
[1:10:51] so there they were he said the abstract
[1:10:54] so
[1:10:54] so so when the holy ghost came down on
[1:10:57] the day of pentecost
[1:10:58] god was saying now every every claim
[1:11:02] against these people has been struck off
[1:11:04] by my blood
[1:11:05] so now these people were spirit-born
[1:11:09] free people and the blame game
[1:11:13] could not be played so the devil's now
[1:11:16] how can i get in because remember if he
[1:11:18] has a claim
[1:11:19] on a people on the earth then then the
[1:11:22] program of god is kind of in a way stuck
[1:11:26] hallelujah so now here's the people who
[1:11:28] are upon the earth
[1:11:29] and and and the devil can't accuse him
[1:11:31] of nothing
[1:11:32] so he brings in people and and and you
[1:11:35] can read it in the book of acts it's not
[1:11:36] very far through
[1:11:38] there were those who have the pharisees
[1:11:39] that became believers
[1:11:41] but why are they called pharisees if
[1:11:43] they're believers you know if they're
[1:11:44] really believers they would have got rid
[1:11:46] of that pharisee spirit
[1:11:48] but they were carrying that with them
[1:11:49] maybe they quoted the quotes and they
[1:11:51] and
[1:11:51] they played the part but in them was not
[1:11:53] a converted soul
[1:11:55] and so they begin to bring in well the
[1:11:57] people have to become jews before they
[1:11:58] become christians there's a lot of
[1:11:59] trouble
[1:12:00] who all bible readers know about those
[1:12:03] things so it was the light of a former
[1:12:05] rage trying to come in and affect what
[1:12:07] god was doing in that day
[1:12:09] and so there was a battle with that and
[1:12:12] then now the devil comes in and says now
[1:12:13] i'm going to pervert
[1:12:15] their baptism i'm going to pervert the
[1:12:18] godhead
[1:12:19] i'm going to take the take it that
[1:12:21] instead of being an anointed people
[1:12:23] it's just an anointed ministry
[1:12:26] amen and then there became a separation
[1:12:28] between us the holy priesthood
[1:12:30] and just the laity and now only the
[1:12:33] choir can sing now the people can't sing
[1:12:35] and we don't sing anything happy we just
[1:12:38] have george and chant
[1:12:40] and if you ever need if you ever have
[1:12:41] insomnia that will cure it real quick
[1:12:45] who said george and chant oh but we've
[1:12:47] got to be reverent and holy
[1:12:49] yo david with the symbols i don't
[1:12:50] believe that little things saying
[1:12:52] you know bang the symbols there would
[1:12:53] have been a lot of noise going on
[1:12:55] oh there would have been a lot of
[1:12:56] rejoicing hallelujah
[1:12:59] oh but we're not built that way i tell
[1:13:01] you what i've seen people who are stiff
[1:13:03] as a board you give them if this is in
[1:13:04] the world now
[1:13:05] you give them a few drinks and they're
[1:13:07] and they're rejoicing they're dancing
[1:13:08] they're laughing they're noisy like the
[1:13:10] noisy fellas
[1:13:11] why because they're partaking of the
[1:13:12] same spirit that's being passed around
[1:13:15] now how much more now be yourself of
[1:13:17] course but you know
[1:13:18] how much more when the spirit of god is
[1:13:20] passed around hallelujah you can be
[1:13:22] have all these complexes and trouble and
[1:13:24] all this thing but then suddenly
[1:13:25] i mean you begin to drink and you begin
[1:13:28] to drink and then you loosen up and
[1:13:29] bring into worship and praise god and
[1:13:31] be happy about it and why what's
[1:13:33] happened why you actually realize
[1:13:35] i'm part of this part of this word this
[1:13:38] is the real me
[1:13:40] amen so the devil began to get blamed he
[1:13:44] could lay upon
[1:13:45] god's children down through the ages now
[1:13:47] we understand that the blood of jesus
[1:13:49] christ
[1:13:50] atoned for the ignorance of the people
[1:13:53] and in the in the old testament there's
[1:13:55] a sin offering for ignorance
[1:13:57] right so even though you know people
[1:13:59] like martin luther they would
[1:14:00] they were you know yesterday was
[1:14:02] actually a wonderful day of celebration
[1:14:05] do you know why because it's reformation
[1:14:07] day
[1:14:09] it was the day that martin luther took
[1:14:10] his 91 thesis
[1:14:12] and nailed it to the church door in
[1:14:13] wittenberg and the reformation was on
[1:14:16] so it was a great day hallelujah
[1:14:20] while the world is celebrating death we
[1:14:22] can celebrate
[1:14:23] life we can celebrate the beginning of
[1:14:26] liberty for the children of god
[1:14:28] hardly you say well he didn't go all the
[1:14:30] way out no no he didn't he was
[1:14:32] prophesied not to go all the way out
[1:14:34] right but but the process of i will
[1:14:36] restore said the lord began to happen
[1:14:38] life began to come back into the church
[1:14:40] that was that was not there in the dark
[1:14:42] ages
[1:14:43] so happy reformation day for yesterday
[1:14:46] hallelujah
[1:14:47] hallelujah we should we should celebrate
[1:14:49] those things i mean because we are a
[1:14:51] product
[1:14:52] of what began there this is not a
[1:14:55] reformation this is a restoration
[1:14:57] but it had to start somewhere hallelujah
[1:15:00] it's just like when the lord start began
[1:15:02] to hold get a hold of your life
[1:15:04] maybe you were still a smoking drinking
[1:15:06] monk
[1:15:07] like luther was but you're not that
[1:15:10] today i trust
[1:15:11] hallelujah but you started somewhere so
[1:15:14] don't despise where you
[1:15:15] started from at least you started
[1:15:17] somewhere unless you've gone this far
[1:15:19] just keep walking on hallelujah
[1:15:22] hallelujah so i rejoice
[1:15:27] halloween nothing it's reformation day
[1:15:30] that was reformation day before it was
[1:15:31] halloween
[1:15:33] just like christmas is not about santa
[1:15:34] claus some
[1:15:36] geriatric scandinavian honor on a sleigh
[1:15:39] you know
[1:15:39] it's not about that it's about the birth
[1:15:42] of the lord we say he wasn't born then
[1:15:43] but we can still celebrate it
[1:15:45] the birth of jesus anywho um so there
[1:15:49] was
[1:15:49] there was there was a blame game that
[1:15:51] could be passed down now
[1:15:53] if the devil has ground to accuse
[1:15:56] then they then the sons of god cannot
[1:16:00] fully manifest who they are
[1:16:02] who's ever had that little feeling oh
[1:16:05] but you're guilty
[1:16:07] you know you feel you know you feel
[1:16:08] guilt or you did this it might not even
[1:16:10] be sinful but there's something that's
[1:16:11] just weighing on you
[1:16:12] who's had that you've got to pray for
[1:16:14] something and there's this little voice
[1:16:15] said
[1:16:16] oh but you didn't do this you did this
[1:16:17] or you know it's just what is it it's
[1:16:19] the devil
[1:16:20] trying to pull you down from your
[1:16:21] god-given position
[1:16:23] because he's trying to pull you down to
[1:16:25] his level
[1:16:26] right but you've got to realize now the
[1:16:28] blame game has come to an end
[1:16:31] there is a people upon the earth that
[1:16:33] there is actually nothing the devil can
[1:16:35] accuse them of
[1:16:36] hallelujah because remember it is not
[1:16:38] it's not us trying to wash ourselves
[1:16:41] right it's not us trying to purify
[1:16:43] ourselves you know wesley
[1:16:45] came with the second work of grace
[1:16:46] sanctification and they had a method of
[1:16:48] living a holy life that's why they're
[1:16:50] called methodists
[1:16:51] but that was under the man age once they
[1:16:53] had a self
[1:16:54] ability of being sanctified
[1:16:58] right but yet got on it but now that was
[1:17:00] under the man age
[1:17:01] we're not in a man age we're in the
[1:17:03] eagle age right where the lord can lift
[1:17:05] us up give us faith
[1:17:06] to lift us up above the habits of the
[1:17:09] flesh
[1:17:10] above sin harley those things that they
[1:17:13] had to do in their own ability
[1:17:15] i mean god just changes our nature
[1:17:18] thank you sir god just changes our
[1:17:20] nature
[1:17:21] that the things he once did we don't do
[1:17:23] them anymore
[1:17:25] oh is it is it by human will no
[1:17:28] that's just god changes your nature
[1:17:30] there's nothing in you for it
[1:17:32] you can't help that glory amen you don't
[1:17:35] have to you know
[1:17:36] we don't have to live in a monastery we
[1:17:38] don't have to go live up in the bush
[1:17:40] somewhere and never see the light of day
[1:17:42] to be rapture ready we can walk in this
[1:17:45] world
[1:17:45] isn't it amazing god can actually so
[1:17:47] condition us and i believe he has
[1:17:49] and if you haven't been conditioned say
[1:17:51] lord condition me with your holy spirit
[1:17:53] you can walk in satan's eden
[1:17:55] hallelujah remember adam and eve fell in
[1:17:57] god's eden but the bride is going to
[1:17:59] walk through satan's eden and overcome
[1:18:04] hallelujah you know where the prophet
[1:18:05] said the prophet said that eve was
[1:18:07] actually predestined to fall
[1:18:09] god knew she would fall but there's a
[1:18:10] woman in the end time that's
[1:18:12] predestinated not to fall
[1:18:14] holy so that's our destiny we are
[1:18:16] actually destined not to fall to the
[1:18:18] devil's lies
[1:18:19] i mean sure he may beat us down a few
[1:18:21] times but there'll come a time
[1:18:25] the thing that we wore against maybe
[1:18:27] we've been warring a very long time but
[1:18:28] there comes actually a time when the
[1:18:29] battle ends
[1:18:31] just like two two two boxes in a ring
[1:18:34] you know they can be
[1:18:35] fighting for many rounds but eventually
[1:18:37] one gets a knockout punch
[1:18:40] and the devil can be fighting you know i
[1:18:42] heard i think it was um
[1:18:43] i think his brother josh bennett i can't
[1:18:45] remember which one he brought it out but
[1:18:46] you know
[1:18:47] muhammad ali was fighting george foreman
[1:18:50] and and he studied him i think was
[1:18:52] george foreman and he just realized he
[1:18:53] has to last more than seven rounds
[1:18:56] and if he can outlast him he'll be worn
[1:18:59] out then
[1:19:00] then he can give the knockout punch so
[1:19:02] he took it for seven rounds
[1:19:04] i think it was or six rounds and in the
[1:19:06] seventh round george foreman was worn
[1:19:08] out and then that's when he went in for
[1:19:10] the kill and won the one the bout
[1:19:12] now we've been down through seven church
[1:19:14] ages
[1:19:15] and the devil's been fighting us and
[1:19:17] beating us and punching us but remember
[1:19:18] we just got to outlast him
[1:19:21] but now is the time for the clock has
[1:19:23] changed
[1:19:24] this is a different season this is a
[1:19:26] different time this is not a time of
[1:19:28] winter and darkness and hardness and no
[1:19:30] life
[1:19:31] this is a time of life this is a time of
[1:19:33] victory
[1:19:34] hallelujah hallelujah so now
[1:19:38] here we come down to the end time god
[1:19:40] pours his spirit out in his
[1:19:41] um in azusa street restoring the gifts
[1:19:44] of the spirit but then of course it all
[1:19:46] denominated and did what it would do
[1:19:48] but then god had to bring a restoration
[1:19:50] prophet to restore a word
[1:19:53] you know some people think that god
[1:19:54] moves in our church or at camp wherever
[1:19:56] just because of enthusiasm
[1:19:58] this has got nothing to do with
[1:19:59] enthusiasm this god do with god's word
[1:20:01] i mean why did why did israel have a
[1:20:03] revival
[1:20:05] amen when when they left egypt to win to
[1:20:07] the promised land
[1:20:08] because of a word they received why did
[1:20:11] caleb take his mountain because of a
[1:20:12] word he received
[1:20:14] hallelujah why did david become king
[1:20:16] like he did because he received a word
[1:20:18] the mighty men gathered around him
[1:20:19] because they knew he was coming into
[1:20:21] power
[1:20:22] it was a word they received hallelujah
[1:20:24] why did
[1:20:25] why did they why were they staring like
[1:20:27] drunk people from the upper room
[1:20:29] it was a word they received tarry in
[1:20:32] jerusalem
[1:20:33] until you're endued within power from on
[1:20:34] high they received that word
[1:20:36] and they went up there expecting and
[1:20:38] they received what they expected
[1:20:40] and then peter could say no this is that
[1:20:42] spoken by the prophet joel
[1:20:44] what you are seeing is the fulfillment
[1:20:46] of scripture in your day
[1:20:48] hallelujah and it's the same thing with
[1:20:51] you and i
[1:20:52] this is not enthusiasm oh but you're
[1:20:55] enthusiastic oh yeah of course i am
[1:20:57] of course i am i'm laughing all the way
[1:20:59] to the bank
[1:21:01] i'm on my way to heaven shouting victory
[1:21:03] because jesus set me free
[1:21:05] hardly when i could not free myself he
[1:21:08] freed me he broke the shackles
[1:21:09] i say father break these shackles he
[1:21:11] said yes i'd have been waiting for you
[1:21:12] to ask me
[1:21:13] hallelujah hallelujah
[1:21:16] that just dispels all the gloom
[1:21:18] hallelujah
[1:21:20] i think we should celebrate shouldn't
[1:21:22] shouldn't church be a celebration
[1:21:24] shouldn't we be celebrating eternal life
[1:21:27] lord you've imparted eternal life into
[1:21:29] me
[1:21:30] i'm not waiting for it to come it's
[1:21:31] already here hallelujah
[1:21:34] hallelujah i don't you know eternity's
[1:21:36] going to be full of happy people
[1:21:39] real happy people hallelujah
[1:21:42] amen so the blame game was being played
[1:21:44] the accuser of the brethren
[1:21:46] amen worked down through seven church
[1:21:48] ages even though the believers down
[1:21:50] through those ages
[1:21:51] those that received the word for their
[1:21:53] day was sealed away hallelujah
[1:21:57] so we're going to see luther there we're
[1:21:59] going to see those who sprung up out of
[1:22:00] that whatever movement it was
[1:22:02] you know we'll see them there we'll see
[1:22:04] those under under
[1:22:05] under wesley and you know we'll see them
[1:22:07] we'll see the real pentecostals there
[1:22:09] hallelujah
[1:22:10] you know this is just a con you know we
[1:22:12] have restored to a true pentecost
[1:22:14] we're actually a pentecostal people not
[1:22:16] an azusa street pentecost but a real
[1:22:18] pentecost
[1:22:19] hallelujah but now we have the book open
[1:22:22] so what they were longing for where it's
[1:22:24] actually in our possession
[1:22:25] hallelujah now so so there
[1:22:28] so god had to bring a restoration
[1:22:31] prophet
[1:22:32] to restore us back that what we believed
[1:22:37] the devil could not lay claim on us
[1:22:40] we don't have his baptism you know you
[1:22:44] know the catholic church has openly said
[1:22:46] that baptism in the name of the father
[1:22:48] son holy ghost is an umbilical cord that
[1:22:50] ties people back to rome
[1:22:52] they have openly said it that's been
[1:22:55] cut amen we have been baptized in the
[1:23:00] name of the father and of the son of the
[1:23:02] holy ghost
[1:23:02] that name is the lord jesus christ so
[1:23:05] we've actually done what jesus told
[1:23:07] peter to do
[1:23:08] and peter preached what jesus said
[1:23:10] hallelujah
[1:23:11] you know the godhead we know he's one
[1:23:13] god manifested you know brother braham
[1:23:14] says that god is not one like your
[1:23:16] finger
[1:23:16] and why is that because your finger only
[1:23:18] has one manifestation
[1:23:21] are you following me he's not two he's
[1:23:23] one
[1:23:24] god was a pillar of fire he's a cloud he
[1:23:27] came as melchizedek theophany form
[1:23:30] hallelujah appeared like an old man to
[1:23:32] gideon with a staff
[1:23:34] all the way down through a different
[1:23:35] manifest same god
[1:23:38] hallelujah so now here here god has
[1:23:41] restored his word
[1:23:42] so now that there's actually a people
[1:23:45] upon the earth
[1:23:46] that are blameless you say what about my
[1:23:50] sin oh that's been taken care of
[1:23:52] that's been taken care of you know i
[1:23:54] love it where it says in first john 2
[1:23:58] the devil got no claim on you or me
[1:24:01] he got no claim what about my mistakes
[1:24:03] there's blood
[1:24:05] what about my guilt there's blood what
[1:24:08] about you know what about my humanity
[1:24:10] this blood
[1:24:11] what about i just say the wrong thing
[1:24:13] sometimes there's blood
[1:24:15] harley what about those mistakes i make
[1:24:16] there's blood what about those ill
[1:24:18] feelings against people there's blood
[1:24:21] glory there's a blood now let's go to
[1:24:24] let's go to first john there's blood
[1:24:27] it ain't gonna run out this is not
[1:24:29] something oh i wonder if this is going
[1:24:31] to last it's going to last
[1:24:33] by one offering he has perfected forever
[1:24:35] then that are sanctified
[1:24:36] by one offering not year after year
[1:24:38] after year after year it doesn't run out
[1:24:41] amen first john 2
[1:24:45] and 1 my little children
[1:24:49] these things i write unto you that you
[1:24:51] sin not
[1:24:52] if any man sin we have an advocate
[1:24:56] with the father jesus christ the
[1:25:00] righteous
[1:25:01] and he is a propitiation for our sins
[1:25:04] and not for our sins only but also for
[1:25:06] the sins
[1:25:07] of the whole world now if we go back to
[1:25:09] that first verse
[1:25:11] you know sin we know really is unbelief
[1:25:13] brother bam tells us sin is unbelief
[1:25:15] and what you see this world this world
[1:25:17] is a manifestation of unbelief
[1:25:19] so sometimes we struggle with the
[1:25:21] promise
[1:25:23] yep okay i'll just say yes just on my
[1:25:26] behalf
[1:25:27] sometimes you think how's this going to
[1:25:28] happen you know because you
[1:25:31] sometimes we get so fixed on what these
[1:25:33] five senses declare
[1:25:35] but as i think brother tazo said look
[1:25:37] beyond the circumstance to the province
[1:25:40] right so don't look at what you see with
[1:25:41] your five senses but sometimes
[1:25:43] you know you really feel that sick or
[1:25:45] you really see
[1:25:46] all you see is how's this ever going to
[1:25:48] work right
[1:25:50] yeah so it's just my eyes that's oh boy
[1:25:54] anyway pray for me
[1:25:57] you know but so so if any
[1:26:00] so he says sin not so
[1:26:03] that he said not so don't disbelieve but
[1:26:06] if any man i say sin disbelieve now
[1:26:08] we'll go back to the first
[1:26:10] part of the chapter say this is for
[1:26:11] believers we have an advocate with the
[1:26:13] father jesus christ the righteous
[1:26:16] now we must understand advocate
[1:26:19] as a person who publicly supports or
[1:26:22] recommends someone
[1:26:23] that's that's the definition from the
[1:26:25] from from the dictionary so an advocate
[1:26:27] is a person who publicly supports or
[1:26:30] recommends someone that's an advocate
[1:26:32] so now when the holy ghost comes into
[1:26:33] your life
[1:26:35] god is making a public declaration i am
[1:26:38] that person's advocate
[1:26:40] because he is showing you and the world
[1:26:42] this one's mine
[1:26:44] alison advocate works on your behalf
[1:26:48] we've got the best legal team in the
[1:26:49] world huh
[1:26:51] we've got the best legal team because
[1:26:52] brother ham says that our judge became
[1:26:54] our eternity
[1:26:55] and the case is settled hollis we have
[1:26:58] the best advocate there can ever be
[1:27:01] hallelujah it doesn't matter what the
[1:27:03] best law firm in the world can't touch
[1:27:04] this
[1:27:05] we have the best advocate so you've got
[1:27:08] a trust that's anchored in your soul
[1:27:10] i have one working for me where what i
[1:27:13] cannot do he's the one that can do it
[1:27:16] hallelujah he knows all the technicality
[1:27:18] of the law
[1:27:20] he knows all the bylaws because he wrote
[1:27:22] it right he knows how the war
[1:27:24] he knows the correct interpretation of
[1:27:26] the law
[1:27:27] no one can twist it from him because he
[1:27:30] knows exactly what the law says
[1:27:32] at least the devil can't come along and
[1:27:34] twist it to him and say well these
[1:27:36] people have done this is
[1:27:37] ah that's not what this means this is
[1:27:40] not what this law
[1:27:41] says you are misinterpreting my word
[1:27:45] to try and hold it against these people
[1:27:47] but you should have seen devil the day
[1:27:49] you got cast out and i got enthroned
[1:27:52] i was there i became their advocate and
[1:27:54] they realized it
[1:27:56] they'll say in reality he always was our
[1:27:58] advocate but you've got to realize
[1:28:00] god's are fighting my battles hallelujah
[1:28:03] i don't just think it i know he's
[1:28:05] fighting my battles he's working on
[1:28:07] on my behalf he's not angry at me he's
[1:28:10] not against me he's for me
[1:28:11] as the apostle paul because they have
[1:28:13] god is for us
[1:28:14] who can be against us that's a big
[1:28:18] statement but it's true
[1:28:19] if the creator of heavens and earth is
[1:28:20] for me he's not against us
[1:28:23] he's not angry at us he's not waiting
[1:28:25] for us to trip up and then he's going to
[1:28:26] deal with us that's not how he works
[1:28:29] hallelujah we may trip others like a
[1:28:31] child you know
[1:28:32] learns to walk falls over
[1:28:37] who no parent in their right mind gets
[1:28:40] angry at their child because they're
[1:28:42] trying to walk
[1:28:44] no parent in a sound mind would get
[1:28:45] angry oh you did that before yeah but no
[1:28:47] no
[1:28:48] you know you dust them off pick them up
[1:28:50] you know calm them down
[1:28:52] you can do it honey you can do it
[1:28:55] hallelujah it's the same thing with you
[1:28:57] and i yeah
[1:28:58] because remember a little child they
[1:29:00] have a there's something in them they
[1:29:01] can't describe it
[1:29:02] but they want to walk they want to talk
[1:29:06] they want to have fellowship hallelujah
[1:29:09] so it's like us there's something in us
[1:29:11] when god turns our heart there's
[1:29:13] something in us lord i want to walk with
[1:29:14] you
[1:29:15] and we may trip and fall and say the
[1:29:17] wrong thing and do this and then
[1:29:19] yeah but god just picks us up correct us
[1:29:22] no do it this way
[1:29:23] you can do it hallelujah and then and he
[1:29:26] just lets us continue on
[1:29:28] but he's not looking for oh i knew
[1:29:30] they'd do that
[1:29:32] you know he's not he's not against us he
[1:29:35] is for
[1:29:36] you everyone say jesus is for me
[1:29:40] he's fought he's not against me he's for
[1:29:42] me hallelujah so i've got the best
[1:29:44] advocate
[1:29:45] ever and he took up my case
[1:29:49] hallelujah i didn't have to fall i gotta
[1:29:51] find this great legal team no
[1:29:52] i'll take up your case because before
[1:29:54] the foundation world i saw you winning
[1:29:56] this case
[1:29:57] and actually the whole trial was turned
[1:29:59] on the accuser
[1:30:01] hallelujah imagine being imagine being
[1:30:03] the defendant
[1:30:04] and actually somehow the trial just
[1:30:06] turns and then now the accuser or
[1:30:08] whatever is called a legal jargon
[1:30:10] actually becomes a defendant
[1:30:11] and now they're under the microscope
[1:30:14] it's amazing people will critics
[1:30:16] criticize brother brown all day long but
[1:30:18] that microscope will never go in their
[1:30:20] lives
[1:30:21] someone who lived a very public life the
[1:30:24] community knew who he was knew his
[1:30:25] character knew who he was
[1:30:26] and they'll criticize it till the cows
[1:30:29] come home
[1:30:30] but they will never let that magnifying
[1:30:33] glass come upon them
[1:30:36] but so the devil will will try and play
[1:30:38] a blame game with you
[1:30:39] but you did this and you were really
[1:30:42] there
[1:30:43] right and he'll blame you for this and
[1:30:46] for this
[1:30:47] and for this but you know you know
[1:30:51] sometimes we're too polite you let him
[1:30:55] rattle off and rattle off and rattle off
[1:30:56] you gotta say
[1:30:57] hold on i have the talking stick you
[1:31:00] don't have any talking stick
[1:31:02] right no actually devil that was a
[1:31:05] result of what you did
[1:31:08] hallelujah it's not attributed to me no
[1:31:10] more because the blood of jesus christ
[1:31:13] has cleansed me
[1:31:15] you know god has the power to forget
[1:31:19] god actually doesn't know see see see
[1:31:21] for us
[1:31:23] something hap someone does something to
[1:31:25] us we still
[1:31:26] have it lodged in the back of our mind
[1:31:28] they did that
[1:31:29] right and then maybe you know we can
[1:31:32] pull it out and
[1:31:33] you know you know i trust we don't if
[1:31:36] we're christian we know we
[1:31:37] we actually if we're christians we let
[1:31:39] things go
[1:31:41] we actually surrender and so how do you
[1:31:43] let something go you surrender the right
[1:31:45] to use it against someone
[1:31:47] that's actually real forgiveness when
[1:31:48] you surrender the right to hold a pain
[1:31:50] against someone well they did this and
[1:31:52] they probably did do that
[1:31:53] but you surrender the right don't carry
[1:31:55] that kind of stuff
[1:31:57] hallelujah and so but god doesn't have
[1:32:00] it in the back of his mind
[1:32:03] what you did even this morning on the
[1:32:06] way to churchill you know whatever
[1:32:08] he doesn't have that in the back of his
[1:32:09] mind when when sin is confessed
[1:32:12] he says he is faithful and just to
[1:32:14] forgive us
[1:32:16] and it actually is wiped from his memory
[1:32:19] that's how great god is hallelujah so
[1:32:22] now
[1:32:23] so now what happens is all right let's
[1:32:25] just go back to first john let's just
[1:32:26] read a little bit and then i'll just
[1:32:28] continue on
[1:32:37] first john 1 7.
[1:32:44] let's go verse 5 rather first john
[1:32:48] this then is the message which we heard
[1:32:50] of him and declare unto you that god is
[1:32:52] light
[1:32:53] and in him is no darkness at all but me
[1:32:56] but if we say we
[1:32:57] have fellowship with him and walk in
[1:32:59] darkness we lie
[1:33:00] and do not the truth but if we walk in
[1:33:03] the light
[1:33:04] as he is in the light we have fellowship
[1:33:06] one with another so it's us and god
[1:33:08] and the blood of jesus christ cleanses
[1:33:10] us from what's that word
[1:33:12] all sin what is the light is the
[1:33:16] manifested word for your day
[1:33:18] so if we walk in it how do you walk and
[1:33:20] accept it and say yes lord beat unto me
[1:33:21] according to your word
[1:33:22] and you walk in it see sometimes it's
[1:33:25] only one thing at a time
[1:33:26] you've got to give your life you give
[1:33:27] your life now you're going to get
[1:33:28] baptized now you walk in that
[1:33:30] then now you know you just keep walking
[1:33:32] and walking walking
[1:33:33] but if we walk in that light as he is in
[1:33:35] the light
[1:33:37] then we have fellowship one with another
[1:33:39] that's why when people leave the world
[1:33:40] they leave god
[1:33:43] we have fellowship one with another and
[1:33:45] the blood of jesus christ his son
[1:33:46] cleanses us from all sin
[1:33:49] hallelujah so so now but but but then
[1:33:53] here comes mr blame game
[1:33:55] and says you've done this and you've
[1:33:56] done this and you've done this and
[1:33:57] you've done this and you've done this
[1:33:58] and he can keep going on and on and on
[1:33:59] and on and on
[1:34:01] you say hold on i confess that i made it
[1:34:04] right
[1:34:05] i'm walking in in the light now this is
[1:34:08] not this is not
[1:34:09] mental gymnastics this is reality i'm
[1:34:11] walking in the word of the lord
[1:34:14] i've confessed it right the blood of
[1:34:17] jesus christ
[1:34:18] cleanses me from all sin so what you're
[1:34:20] blaming me of you can't accuse me of
[1:34:22] because it's done
[1:34:23] it's taken care of hallelujah you say
[1:34:26] this is very elementary no no
[1:34:29] we got to get the guilt away
[1:34:34] you know our past use your past
[1:34:38] for god's glory
[1:34:42] your past you know we take the you know
[1:34:45] there are six cities of refuge
[1:34:46] that that joshua put in the promised
[1:34:48] land right
[1:34:50] now one of some of those are actually
[1:34:52] garrison cities of the enemy
[1:34:55] so beforehand the devil had his people
[1:34:57] in there and it was actually an enemy
[1:34:59] stronghold
[1:35:00] but then once joshua came in and drove
[1:35:02] them out it became a city of refuge for
[1:35:04] the believer
[1:35:06] so once upon a time we take the woman at
[1:35:08] the well for example
[1:35:09] she had a man problem but then the
[1:35:12] seventh man she met was her real husband
[1:35:14] right so now here she is she had this
[1:35:17] trying to find love in all the wrong
[1:35:18] places and just gets hurts and hurts and
[1:35:20] hurts and hurts
[1:35:21] and the more hurts we get where that
[1:35:23] gives place for the devil to
[1:35:24] manifest himself are you following me
[1:35:27] right
[1:35:28] but then when the seventh husband came
[1:35:30] he cleared that out
[1:35:32] and then now so so imagine now that
[1:35:35] pentecost has come
[1:35:36] believers begin to come i believe she is
[1:35:38] in the upper room
[1:35:40] so now you're a young sister
[1:35:44] and you've just walked in the steps of
[1:35:45] the woman at the world you've actually
[1:35:47] lived her kind of life
[1:35:48] and then you come in among these people
[1:35:50] and say no one will understand me here
[1:35:52] but you feel a draw to the lord the
[1:35:54] lord's dealing drawing with you
[1:35:56] but then but then the devil always your
[1:35:58] whispers say cease
[1:36:00] no no one will understand you you don't
[1:36:02] fit in here
[1:36:03] but then but then you're the woman at
[1:36:05] the well you can actually put your
[1:36:06] shoulder over that sister
[1:36:08] and you can begin to testify i've walked
[1:36:11] where you've walked
[1:36:12] i understand your struggles i understand
[1:36:14] you're hurt i understand we
[1:36:25] what's happened it used to be a
[1:36:35] so you could either let the devil use
[1:36:37] your past against you
[1:37:04] because sharon rose's little eyes were
[1:37:06] crossing in pain before she passed away
[1:37:09] and so she he could actually enter into
[1:37:11] that burden
[1:37:32] foreign
[1:38:00] foreign
[1:38:15] they know what they're being signed up
[1:38:17] for because they oh i want to be a
[1:38:18] sniper or maybe they're good shots they
[1:38:20] get drafted into that
[1:38:21] you know training but with us we don't
[1:38:24] know what we're signing up for
[1:38:26] right but god can use the training that
[1:38:29] we received
[1:38:31] to win the battle so god doesn't waste
[1:38:34] nothing
[1:38:36] god don't waste nothing everything we go
[1:38:38] through in life is for a purpose
[1:38:40] it's for his purpose hallelujah
[1:38:43] but the devil comes along and says you
[1:38:44] did this
[1:39:52] um
[1:40:06] so
[1:40:34] um
[1:40:45] this is
[1:41:16] um
[1:41:26] oh who's the laborers him hey i've
[1:41:29] ceased from my own works i've entered
[1:41:31] into rest
[1:41:32] hallelujah amen fear not for i have
[1:41:36] redeemed thee
[1:41:37] i have called thee by thy name thou art
[1:41:40] mine
[1:41:41] when thou passes through the waters i'll
[1:41:42] be with thee and through the rivers they
[1:41:45] shall not overflow thee when they'll
[1:41:47] walk us through the fire thou shall not

[1:44:30] in our lives we see that he
[1:44:32] is god hallelujah
[1:44:36] hallelujah and then we go to
[1:44:39] isaiah 54 and then we're just going to
[1:44:41] wind this up a little bit we're going to
[1:44:42] go to revelations 10.
[1:44:44] but it says isaiah 54 and we're going to
[1:44:46] read from verse
[1:44:47] 14 and righteousness
[1:44:50] shall thou be established he's talking
[1:44:53] about you
[1:44:55] isn't it amazing when you can read hey
[1:44:57] he's talking about me
[1:45:00] when he's talking about the devil he's
[1:45:01] talking about the devil's not talking
[1:45:02] about me but this is talking about me
[1:45:04] hallelujah remember this is a love
[1:45:06] letter i was telling someone it
[1:45:08] um i'm at work this week the bible is a
[1:45:10] love letter
[1:45:12] you got to fall in love with him
[1:45:15] hallelujah amen now
[1:45:18] in righteousness thou shalt be
[1:45:19] established thou
[1:45:21] shalt be far from oppression thou shall
[1:45:24] not fear
[1:45:25] and from terror for it shall not come
[1:45:27] near thee
[1:45:28] behold they shall surely gather together
[1:45:31] but not by me
[1:45:32] whosoever shall gather together against
[1:45:34] thee shall fall for thy sake
[1:45:36] behold i have created the smith that
[1:45:38] blot the coals in the fire
[1:45:40] and that bringeth forth an instrument
[1:45:42] for his work and i have
[1:45:44] created the waster to destroy
[1:45:47] hallelujah oh why is that exciting
[1:45:50] devil we know who made you and you're
[1:45:53] coming to an end
[1:45:54] he's just an instrument in god's hand
[1:45:58] no weapon that is formed against he
[1:46:00] shall prosper and every tongue that
[1:46:02] shall rise against him judgment
[1:46:04] thou shalt condemn why shall you condemn
[1:46:07] that
[1:46:08] tongue that rises against the judgment
[1:46:10] because the blood there's blood for me
[1:46:14] amen there's blood for me that we
[1:46:16] because remember we would appear before
[1:46:18] him blameless
[1:46:19] without blame and love hallelujah so
[1:46:22] you've got to condemn the tongue of the
[1:46:24] devil this is the heritage of the
[1:46:26] servants of the lord and their
[1:46:27] righteousness
[1:46:28] is of me saith the lord not my own
[1:46:32] righteousness
[1:46:33] but the lord's righteousness hallelujah
[1:46:37] now
[1:46:39] if this is so which it is
[1:46:42] then god has taken a people out from the
[1:46:46] from the filthy hands of the devil and
[1:46:48] has redeemed them back
[1:46:50] as sons and daughters of god that now
[1:46:52] what they were ordained to be they are
[1:46:55] today now we are the sons of god the
[1:46:58] bible says now we are
[1:46:59] not where we right now right now and if
[1:47:02] it wasn't right now
[1:47:03] it's right now hallelujah that now is
[1:47:05] the time for the full manifestation of
[1:47:07] the sons and daughters of god
[1:47:09] now if we are sons and daughters of god
[1:47:11] we have a dominion
[1:47:13] amen we have a dominion that we have
[1:47:15] domain over
[1:47:16] now the devil will come along and try
[1:47:18] and get us to think you have no
[1:47:19] authority
[1:47:21] but we do have authority we may not have
[1:47:23] power but we have authority
[1:47:25] amen as a son and daughter of god you
[1:47:27] have authority
[1:47:28] over those who are not sons and
[1:47:30] daughters of god now i'm talking about
[1:47:31] the devil now
[1:47:32] okay because the devil he tries to think
[1:47:35] no no
[1:47:36] no i will get rid of the family of god
[1:47:38] and i will reign upon this earth
[1:47:41] but god has other plans
[1:47:44] god has other plans he said satan you
[1:47:46] are a fired servant
[1:47:48] now we've been through this a servant
[1:47:50] can never become a son
[1:47:52] because the life that's in the father is
[1:47:53] not in the servant it's in the children
[1:47:56] hallelujah and his royal blood now flows
[1:47:58] through my veins
[1:48:00] amen so now a servant can never become a
[1:48:02] son and god never wanted his sons and
[1:48:05] daughters to be servants
[1:48:06] right so the devil had a job description
[1:48:09] to do as the song leader in heaven
[1:48:11] but he went beyond the job description
[1:48:13] tried to become a god
[1:48:14] right gathered angels to himself and he
[1:48:17] got fired
[1:48:19] hallelujah he got fired amen he got
[1:48:22] fired from his job
[1:48:23] so now he we are fighting
[1:48:26] a fired servant now if you think about
[1:48:30] someone who has a job here
[1:48:33] okay if you have a job you have
[1:48:35] authority within your job to do certain
[1:48:37] tasks
[1:48:38] right i have authority in my job to
[1:48:40] release results to customers
[1:48:42] and do testing and and develop methods
[1:48:44] and different things in my job
[1:48:46] right so i have authority but as soon as
[1:48:49] i leave my job
[1:48:50] i have no authority to do those things
[1:48:52] i'm not even allowed on the grounds
[1:48:54] like through the security because i've
[1:48:56] got to go through about five swipe doors
[1:48:58] to get into the lab
[1:49:01] it's not just a wandering out kind of
[1:49:03] thing i can go to the reception if i
[1:49:05] have no swipe card
[1:49:06] but then i've got to actually meet with
[1:49:09] someone who's in the you know
[1:49:10] in the interior of the building we ever
[1:49:11] got to come out i've got to sign in they
[1:49:13] escort me and they're going to sign
[1:49:14] into another place go through some doors
[1:49:17] and finally i'm in
[1:49:18] but if i'm an employee i have the access
[1:49:22] i have the swipe card right to get into
[1:49:25] where i need to go and i have authority
[1:49:27] to to
[1:49:28] dwell in that position now the devil
[1:49:30] seems to think
[1:49:32] that someone who is fired can still
[1:49:34] dwell in a position
[1:49:37] he got fired he has no authority
[1:49:40] to take our position he got fired from
[1:49:43] the job
[1:49:44] as being the song leader in heaven as as
[1:49:47] leading the worship
[1:49:49] hallelujah but he got fired so now if
[1:49:52] i left my job or if i got fired god
[1:49:54] forbid and i try and go into the lab
[1:49:56] they have the right to to either get
[1:49:59] security
[1:50:00] or call the police and i'll be forcibly
[1:50:03] removed
[1:50:05] from that place hallelujah and if i
[1:50:07] cause trouble no doubt they'll get a
[1:50:09] trespass order
[1:50:10] on me hallelujah why on earth
[1:50:14] do we let the devil he's been kicked out
[1:50:17] why do we let him come in where he has
[1:50:20] no authority to dwell he has no
[1:50:22] authority
[1:50:23] to dwell in me he has no right to be in
[1:50:26] control of me
[1:50:27] he has no right to govern my thought
[1:50:29] life govern my prayer life govern my
[1:50:31] worship govern my walk govern how i
[1:50:33] treat my family
[1:50:34] govern how i treat my brothers and
[1:50:36] sisters govern how i treat
[1:50:38] the world he has no right
[1:50:41] but yeah for some reason he just swans
[1:50:43] in
[1:50:45] and he swans out and then he blames us
[1:50:47] for doing it
[1:50:48] we've gotta we've gotta get the police
[1:50:51] i'm talking about the holy ghost agent
[1:50:54] he's the best security hallelujah you
[1:50:57] know we've gotta we've actually got to
[1:50:58] get him
[1:50:59] lord jesus kick this guy out he got
[1:51:02] fired he has no right
[1:51:04] you have all the right lord come and
[1:51:06] dwell here forever lord
[1:51:07] hallelujah but but we have the right to
[1:51:09] actually sign a trespass order against
[1:51:11] the devil
[1:51:12] and kick him out hallelujah we have the
[1:51:16] authority to kick him out of our homes
[1:51:18] dave elaine welcome at 138 joel street
[1:51:20] stokes valley
[1:51:23] heaven is but hell is not hallelujah
[1:51:27] hallelujah and if he tries to come in
[1:51:31] so hold on satan you're a fired servant
[1:51:35] i'm a son of god this worth is actually
[1:51:39] my dominion we'll inherit it one day
[1:51:43] but as i'm walking on this earth and
[1:51:44] when you come across my path i have
[1:51:46] right to kick you out
[1:51:48] hallelujah
[1:51:52] amen you know
[1:51:56] and the accuser comes along and he
[1:51:59] blames us for
[1:52:01] things you got to say hold on your
[1:52:04] eviction notice
[1:52:05] i can't remember who said it this is the
[1:52:07] devil's eviction notice
[1:52:08] yes right hallelujah
[1:52:12] we're going to read him the eviction
[1:52:15] notice
[1:52:17] in my name says the lord i shall cast
[1:52:19] you out satan
[1:52:21] these signs shall follow them that
[1:52:22] believe thy hands upon the sick they
[1:52:24] shall recover my name i'll cast out
[1:52:26] devils
[1:52:26] speak with new tongues if you drink any
[1:52:28] deadly thing it shall not harm you you
[1:52:29] know mark 16.
[1:52:31] amen so we need to re we we need to
[1:52:34] stand on our god given rights
[1:52:38] hallelujah and god doesn't say you
[1:52:40] better not stand on your rights today
[1:52:42] god wants us to stand on our rights he
[1:52:45] loves it you know he loves when people
[1:52:46] take him at his word
[1:52:49] hallelujah amen
[1:52:53] so let's just go to revelations 10 real
[1:52:54] quick and then we'll um and then we'll
[1:52:56] call the musicians to come
[1:52:57] now in revelations 10 we have the mighty
[1:53:00] angel come down with an open book an
[1:53:02] anointing comes down from heaven with
[1:53:03] the open book the seals have been loosed
[1:53:06] the thunders have added and we know that
[1:53:08] the seven thunders
[1:53:10] uh were interpreted with the opening of
[1:53:11] the seven seals
[1:53:13] right but then there comes a time now
[1:53:16] where
[1:53:17] where john who in previous chapters was
[1:53:20] wasn't even allowed to look at the book
[1:53:23] he's now commanded
[1:53:24] to go and take the book and eat the book
[1:53:26] and become one with that book
[1:53:29] hallelujah so the title deed that adam
[1:53:31] and eve lost in the beginning
[1:53:33] has to be restored back now i'm kind of
[1:53:36] being a bit of a historian right now
[1:53:38] because this has already happened
[1:53:40] right we're not looking for it to come
[1:53:42] it's already happened but we're going to
[1:53:43] realize who we are
[1:53:45] we're going to realize lord everything
[1:53:47] that
[1:53:48] brother brown says all that adam and eve
[1:53:50] lost has now been restored
[1:53:52] as in a position of sonship over the
[1:53:54] earth over the devil
[1:53:57] hallelujah and the voice this is this is
[1:54:01] 10 and 10 and 8 and the voice which i
[1:54:03] heard from heaven spake unto me again
[1:54:05] said go
[1:54:06] take the little book which is open in
[1:54:07] the hand of the angel
[1:54:09] which standeth upon the scene upon the
[1:54:11] earth and i went unto the angel
[1:54:12] and said unto him give me the little
[1:54:14] book and he said unto me take it up and
[1:54:15] eat it up
[1:54:16] and it shall be in my belly bitter and
[1:54:18] it shall be in thy mouth
[1:54:20] sweet as honey and i took the little
[1:54:22] book out of the angel's hand and ate it
[1:54:24] up and it was in my mouth sweet as honey
[1:54:26] and as soon as i'd eaten it and my belly
[1:54:28] was bitter whatever it's sweet to talk
[1:54:30] about but it's got to purge a lot of
[1:54:31] stuff out
[1:54:33] right but but now that's the thing
[1:54:35] though
[1:54:36] since the prophet went off the scene
[1:54:38] people have just been eating the book
[1:54:41] right talking about the quotes and
[1:54:43] talking about the scriptures singing out
[1:54:44] ties together and discussing and
[1:54:46] debating things
[1:54:47] but there's got to come a time where the
[1:54:49] eating goes down to speaking
[1:54:51] right where the contents of the book
[1:54:53] this is the book
[1:54:55] where the contents of this becomes a
[1:54:57] lived voice
[1:54:58] amen it says and he said unto me thou
[1:55:01] shalt thou must prophesy again before
[1:55:03] many
[1:55:04] peoples and nations and tongues and
[1:55:06] kings
[1:55:07] so now john we know is a symbol in the
[1:55:09] book
[1:55:10] right just like john was taken up after
[1:55:13] the end of revelations 3
[1:55:14] one man in a vision being taken up
[1:55:16] represents a whole body of people
[1:55:18] in a rapture right so and then john in
[1:55:21] history we know
[1:55:22] after after he was on the isle of patmos
[1:55:24] he went back to ephesus and he passed to
[1:55:26] the church there till he passed away
[1:55:28] he didn't he didn't go before many
[1:55:29] people's nations tongues
[1:55:31] and prophesy well this is speaking about
[1:55:34] an end time people
[1:55:36] that have a book that's come open to
[1:55:37] them and has been placed
[1:55:39] placed in their in their hearts
[1:55:42] hallelujah
[1:55:42] so now we're living in a season who's
[1:55:45] eaten the book
[1:55:46] what does that mean i've become one with
[1:55:48] the lord jesus christ he is that book
[1:55:51] hallelujah so now that now there has to
[1:55:53] come a season where it's not just eating
[1:55:54] the book and it's perched things out and
[1:55:56] it's sweet in the mouth
[1:55:57] but now it's coming time to speak they
[1:56:00] must prophesy again
[1:56:01] it's not a different prophecy that the
[1:56:03] you know from the word it's just
[1:56:04] speaking what has been spoken
[1:56:06] again so the same life that was lived in
[1:56:09] the book of acts has now manifested
[1:56:11] again
[1:56:12] hallelujah but it's actually now god is
[1:56:14] going to take our lips
[1:56:16] hallelujah which once spoke cursings and
[1:56:19] and all kind of division and gossip and
[1:56:21] and hatred of malice and strife he's
[1:56:23] going to use those same lips
[1:56:24] to tear satan's kingdom down and i'm not
[1:56:28] talking about destroying natural nations
[1:56:30] here
[1:56:30] i'm about tearing satan's kingdoms down
[1:56:32] out of people's lives
[1:56:34] highly once the devil had a whole bunch
[1:56:35] of a fortress in someone's life
[1:56:37] god will anoint you and you'll speak to
[1:56:39] that person it'll be god speaking
[1:56:40] through you
[1:56:41] won't be you in your mind thinking what
[1:56:42] to say god will speak through
[1:56:45] and that person will come into liberty
[1:56:48] hallelujah
[1:56:48] so now we're living in the season it's
[1:56:50] not now is the time to speak
[1:56:52] silence has ended why is science ended
[1:56:54] because now we're not fighting a battle
[1:56:56] of well i have the skills i have the
[1:56:58] shame i have the sinner no
[1:56:59] that's been taken care of we've got to
[1:57:02] settle the mind battle and say no no
[1:57:04] the blood is enough
[1:57:07] in the church age book i think it's the
[1:57:09] philadelphian age
[1:57:10] you know brother abraham said that that
[1:57:12] that under that age that says they did
[1:57:14] not believe
[1:57:15] in the blood salvation is of the lord in
[1:57:18] reality
[1:57:19] they believed salvation was of the lord
[1:57:21] and their own good conduct
[1:57:25] that's come to an end it's not what it's
[1:57:28] not calvary plus you
[1:57:31] it's calvary only it's the power of the
[1:57:34] blood of the lamb
[1:57:34] only holy it's only him it's not me
