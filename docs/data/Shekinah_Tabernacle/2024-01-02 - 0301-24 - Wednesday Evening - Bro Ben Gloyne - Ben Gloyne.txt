========================================

[Music] h [Music] oh [Music] yeah [Music] w [Music] praise the Lord welcome to the house of God this evening amen it's good to be here amen amen it's good to be in an atmosphere of the spirit of God it's um is this the first service for 2024 it is too yeah it's going to be a great year this [Music] year not saying that we've compassed the mountain but you know there was there's a scripture that um the Lord said to Moses you know you've you've compassed this mountain long enough it's time to turn northward you know and and I I just like the feeling behind that because you know it's it's it's time to turn and attain all the prom of God you know to to walk that way and I believe that's we're going to continue on that path this year we're going to we're going to we're going to go northward to the promises of God this time next year we're going to have claimed more of the promises of God for our life we're going to search them out search what riches there are in Christ for each one of us and we're going to attain them amen we're in for a great year it's going to be a very turbulent year I think there going to be a lot of things happen um in in the world it's going to be very very turbulent like almost like put your seat belts on turbulent you know the when the when you're flying on an airplane and they say that the seat belt light comes on it's going to be a very turbulent year you know I just there's just things happening but you know we can have peace when we keep our minds fixed on Christ you know he says he will keep him in perfect peace whose mind has stayed on thee and that's the victory that we have as a believer you know regardless of all the nonsense that goes on around us we can be in perfect peace when we when we just fix our eyes on Christ and not be anxious or anything like that you know when Jesus was being tossed around on the boat he was just asleep the disciples were anxious concerned very worried about the situation and Jesus was asleep you know and and that that that can be our experience if we just keep our eyes on Christ we can just be relaxed in every storm and every situation we just relax we don't need to be anxious we need he got up he said you have little faith cuz you know when we get anxious some it's sometimes because we haven't F put our mind on Christ and we're looking at the situation and we're just anxious but let's look to Christ this evening let's um stand and um just commit the service to the Lord Heavenly Father we're so grateful that we can look to you Lord and not be anxious not be worried about anything Lord but we we know that Lord you are the the the God of Peace Lord you give us a peace that passes all understanding Lord and you give us rest Lord within the veil Lord in the holiest of holies and we want to dwell in that rest Lord where Aaron's Rod budded where the China glor is Lord where we can be feasting at the Springs of Living Water Lord whether there be a drought around us or turbulence in in the world around us and yet Lord we can have complete peace and confidence in you Lord so I pray that that would continue to be each person's experience here this year Lord may we be victorious

together amen think it's a good way to start the new year amen we can can commit Our Lives to the Lord once again and amen so let's go to Daniel um chapter 1 and um we're going to read just just two verses here and then um yeah read this here this is um Daniel's quite a quite a guy quite a quite an amazing man when you think about it you know he went into uh he went into Babylon as a captive as about a 14 12 to 14 year old pretty amazing you know he wasn't some old guy setting his ways when he purposed in his heart he's not going to defile himself with the king's meat you know he was a young guy as a young man so yeah so let's just read this here Daniel 1 and7 unto whom the prince of the Unix gave names for he gave unto Daniel the name of Bazar and to hanani of Shadrach and of Michel um Michelle of of Meek and of um Isiah of abedo but Daniel purposed in his heart that he would not defile himself with the portion of the king's meat nor with the wine which he drank therefore he requested of the prince of the Unix that he might not defile himself amen let's just bow our heads in a word of prayer this evening you have a need you want to raise your hand to the Lord amen let's pray gracious Lord Jesus what a powerful name you have lord it's a name above every name and we know everything must bow to your all powerful all sufficient name we are so thankful dear God you have no rival you have no equal Lord because you conquered H death in the grave Lord You Are The Mighty conqueror we're so thankful you stand in 2024 as a mighty conqueror we just want to commit Our Lives into your hands we thank you for this time of prayer we're going to have we just want to ask that you'll take control dear God may you Lord may it not be us praying but may be you praying oh God may you anoint speaker and hearer may you just have your way in this service may it just be all you from the beginning to the end and may you be with those who are traveling those who are away may you give them a blessed time and may watch uh Lord may be with those who are streaming as well Lord we commit everyone into your hands and we thank you in Jesus Christ's name amen amen God bless you friends you may have your seats tonight so I want to I want to talk about Daniel here and you know how really we should have an attitude wherever we are sent we're going to serve God wherever we are yes sir you know and Daniel Daniel had a real um I believe you know as as we'll read later you know he you know he read the book of Jeremiah and he realized that it wasn't very long until the prophecy of Jeremiah of the uh Israelites being in Babylon for 70 years was going to be fulfilled and but you know so so he was a he was a uh reader of the scriptures oh yeah and you know there would have been a time no doubt when he would have he would have been reading I just want to read Psalms 139 here he would have read this Psalm and there's something about the word when it's mixed with faith it becomes yours and you know cuz a lot of people say well this is just a Psalm of David this is David just you know singing this this is song but when the word quickens to your heart it's no longer just David's Psalm it's your Psalm it's no longer his Revelation it's your Revelation so I believe Daniel Daniel would have read this and it would have really Quicken to his heart is a Psalm of David oh Lord thou H has searched me and known me thou knowest my downsitting and my Uprising thou understandest my thought a far off thou Compass compasses my path and my lying down and are acquainted with all my ways for there is not a word in my tongue but lo oh Lord thou knowest it all together thou Hast beset me behind and before and laid uh thine hand upon me such knowledge is too wonderful for me it is high I cannot attain unto it wherefore shall I go from thy Spirit or whether shall I flee from thy presence I wonder if this is going through his mind as he's walking out of out of Jerusalem the last time and he was taking the reverse Journey that Abraham took CU actually took where Abraham came from Babylon the Earth of chales came up down down to the promised and they took that reverse path I wonder if this was kind of in his mind when he was being led captivity Lord where can I go from your spirit I'm about to leave the promised land of our you my Promised Land the land of Abraham Isaac and Jacob I'm going to go into a Strange Land but Lord You're got to come with me I'm not leaving you behind as I'm being lead into this place and I think we need this to be very much wherever the Lord leads us in 2024 our hearts should be Lord how can I serve you here amen how can I worship you how can I be a living testimony in this current place and I find myself am me if I Ascend up into heaven Thou Art there if I make my bed and H behold Thou Art there if I take the wings of the morning and dwell in the uttermost parts of the sea even there shall thy hand lead me and thy right hand shall hold me if I say surely Darkness shall cover me even the night shall be light about me ye the darkness hideth not not from thee but the night shineth as the day the darkness and the light are both alike to thee for thou Hast possessed my Reigns thou Hast covered me in my mother's womb I will praise thee for I am fearfully and wonderfully made marvelous are thy works and that my soul knoweth right well my substance was not hid from thee when I was made in secret and curly wrought in the lowest parts of the earth Thine Eyes did see my substance yet being unperfect and in thy book all my members were written which in continence were fashioned when as yet there was none of them how precious also are thy thoughts unto me oh God how great is the sum of them if I should count them they are more in number than the sand when I awake I am still with thee yeah now we could keep reading but I just want to leave it there you know so so I believe D Daniel would have read this and he would have realized no matter where I go the Lord's with me and I'm going to be a believer wherever I go that's basically what he made up in his mind I'm going to be a I'm going to be a worshipper of God as a slave in the unix's house in the palace in Babylon wherever I'm going to go I'm going to be a believer I'm not going to let it weigh me down I'm not going to let it change who I am I'm not going to let it mold me that I forget who I am I'm going to be a Christian wherever I'm sent and I think this is how we should be cuz we're at we're in a Babylon we're not in modern day Iraq but this world is a Babylon right it's a place of confusion and and trouble and demon powers and the works of darkness and all these things but yet if Daniel could walk into Babylon and be successful under the blood of bulls and goats he had no church he had no favorite preacher to listen to he he didn't have a camp every year to go to he couldn't go visit some other Church some other place he had no other encouragement but he decided see when you take responsibility we talked about the other night when you take responsibility for yourself it's not an it doesn't have to be an external thing saying do this and stop this and start this and go here and do this no when you take responsibility it's in here and it's and it's motivating you So Daniel I believe he he took responsibility I'm going to praise God wherever I am I'm going to praise God Amen I don't know what's going to what's going to happen when we get there Shadrach mesach Ando I don't know but we're going to praise God there you know so I think I think we can we can walk in the same kind of way right cuz Daniel's a shadow there's got to be a reality in the end time amen that everything that Daniel saw we are seeing manifested in this time right I mean a lot of it a lot of it's been fulfilled but you understand what I mean so so if he can walk walk in the blood of bulls and goats and be successful how about you and I see the first thing the first thing not out here remembered is God has a covenant with me God made a covenant with my four bears with Abraham Isaac and Jacob and I'm under that same Covenant it wasn't me making a covenant with Jehovah that counts it's god Jehovah made a covenant with me and we got to realize God has made a covenant with you and I amen and I trust that you react to that Covenant saying yes Lord Lord here I am I'm your child amen let's get everything out of the way and just just I trust God can just establish that in our hearts I'm his son or I'm his daughter I'm maen I've been bought with the price of the blood of Jesus Christ it doesn't matter what I got what I have to go through I'm going through Lord I'm still going to be a Christian see the three three Hebrew children they basically said to the king we're going to be worshiping in the furnace then that was basically what they said to him because we're not going to Bow either God will deliver us or not that's actually not the question in our minds about what God's going to do for us we're going to worship Him Anyway amen I trust that's how you feel tonight you know remember what God has blessed is blessed and he cannot reverse his Blessing and that blessing has nothing to do with the bank balance of size of a house all the material things that we think is a blessing that's not the real blessing the real blessing is the revelation of Jesus Christ to you in your day in your heart that is the you are the most blessed person for God to reveal himself to you and to walk with you you're blessed more than Bill Gates the the guy who owns Amazon Elon Musk all those people you're way more blessed than them you're not even in the same category that's right than them that's right you're blessed totally and what God has blessed has blessed that's what actually God spoke through balam's lips about Israel what God and remember balam was there to try and curse Israel but God spoke through that false prophet saying what God has blessed his blessed and I cannot reverse the blessing I cannot change what God has decreed so I think we've got to take that on board and say Lord if you could look at Israel under the blood of bulls and goats and you say I've blessed those people there was trouble with those people there's all kind of things going on but God blessed them and he could not reverse the blessing how much you and I under the blood of Jesus Christ if you're blessed you're blessed amen you cannot become cursed you're blessed amen and we're worried about falling under some you know the wrath of God is really only reserved for the devil and his angels we're scared about you know we're going to put a foot wrong if we do God will correct us and we'll walk along the path praise the Lord for ction but you know we should not be fear we we we're not ordained to live in fear that he's going to throw us away and brother Bram even said and I remember having actually the same experience before I heard him say it he says if he casts me into hell I'll praise him there and I remember in my early Christian walk you know the devil twisted uh the scripture in my head that basically it's like if you do something wrong and you know it's wrong and you do it then there's no more blood for you and and Lally like a lead balloon like dropped in my heart I thought well I'm I'm toast but I thought well at least but the Bible says that at least one day I'll get to stand before him and I'll be a to tell him I love you anyway and you can cast me to hell if you want I'll worship you there I couldn't go back to the world there's no world to go back to Hallelujah you know that B that bridge was burnt you know and brother Ram said if he had the same Spirit as he had now and God cast him to hell he'd worship him there so let's just get that out of our mind about God's going to cast us away that's right he's called us to keep us right Daniel Daniel had that Revelation I believe I've been called by God I'm going to walk with God I don't know how I'm going to do it but I'm going to do it and God you know because it wasn't just his human grit that kept him on the path because human ability fails there comes a point where H force of will comes to an end so I believe it was more than just his own human ability saying well I'm can I'm going to do this you know that was God God did something in his heart praise the Lord that's exactly Amen brother Bram says here now notice when these Kings before they started out they should have before jehos had ever made an alliance with Ahab uh he thought to have said this first let us pray and see what the will of the Lord is now give me a preacher give me a Christian give me a housewife that's a Christian give me a farmer or a factory worker that will put God first in everything I'll show you a man will be successful in spite of all the devil can put on him he seeks God first he says we must have first we must seek him first so give me a Christian here give me a housewife give me a brother a son a sister a daughter whoever who'll put God first you'll be successful Amen in spite of all the devil can put on you see the devil tried to put a lot of things on Daniel but it wasn't successful over him he overcame it and we got to remember the you know the whole the whole trial of the Lion's Den it wasn't just Daniel got thrown in the den and got out all of his enemies got thrown in the den and they didn't get out am see everything that was causing the trial got eaten up and it was gone thank you Lord amen so a trial isn't just for yeah oh we're going through a trial God wants to deal with some enemies in that trial maybe a bit of humanity and a bit of wrong thinking and things God you know some family spirits and strains God wants to burn away he wants his lies to chew them up and split them out amen that's what he wants to do so trials aren't just for oh we're going through a test here will stand no God wants to get rid of some things yes that's right he doesn't want them bothering you anymore he wants you to walk free of them praise the Lord I'm real happy about that I trust you are too amen thank you Lord hallelujah so and also I believe that Daniel would have would have read here in Joshua especially this be strong and of good courage For unto this people shall thou divide uh for an inheritance the land which I swear unto their fathers to give them only be thou strong and very courageous that thou May observe to do according to all the law which Moses my servant commanded thee turn not from it to the right hand or to the left hand that thou May Prosper wheresoever thou goest maybe he had this in his mind too when he was walking out I just try and make the Bible more real to me you know what was what was he thinking when he was being carried away captive be strong and courageous Shadrach Meshach and abedo let's be strong and courageous the Lord will go with us wherever we go he's not leaving us in Babylon by ourselves we we're not here in this Darkness you know just trying to fend through and just trying to make things through no the Lord's with us he's prepared us for this day you know the Lord's prepared you for 2024 we don't know what we're going to face but the Lord's prepared us for it amen he's already seen what we're going to go through am mean this book of the law shall not depart out of thy mouth but Thou shalt meditate during day and night that thou mayest observe to do according to all that is written therein for then Thou shalt make thy way prosperous and thou shalt have good success have have not I commanded thee be strong and of a good courage Be not Afraid neither be thou dismayed for the Lord thy God is with thee wherever thou goest he's the Difference Maker it's not our Humanity it's not no no it's God that makes the difference so when we go into Babylon when we go out of these doors we go back into Babylon what are we serving Daniel served God Shadrick M go they served God they didn't serve their current state they didn't worship their problem s and what they had to navigate through they worship God as they're walking through Babylon amen and I believe that we can do the same thing we have called to be strong and be of good courage don't be dismayed by what's going on Amen just keep walking on with God amen amen praise the Lord now brother Ram says don't never never try to get to God anything other than to fellowship with God but under the blood that's the only way God knows that the only way God will recognize you must first be Washed by the Water of the word then cleanse through the blood and enter into the shik of Glory go into there into the fellowship then you know where you're standing at it's interesting I was reading before I didn't put it in here maybe I should have but you know how the Jews tried to tried to approach God by their religion by works and not by faith and then the word became a stumbling block to them because they didn't approach the Lord by faith and I fear many message Believers stumble the same way they try and approach God by their good works and what they think they have done instead of by faith right and then when the promises and everything come their way they stumble at the word because they're looking at themselves instead of what God has done for them so we don't want to come that way try and have fellowship with God by what we have done we have nothing to give him nothing to to say look Lord I've done this therefore you got to do this no God's done all things and we're going to receive it by faith yes amen Daniel another one who had purposed in his heart he wouldn't defile himself with the king's meat when he was taken down to Babylon he maintained his fellowship and the presence of lions that was ready to kill him yet Daniel held his fellowship and God sent an angel and stood by him that night and blinded the eyes and shut the mouth of the LI because Daniel had fellowship with the supernatural Daniel had fellowship with the god of Heaven because he was under the blood and that's how he maintained his stand see when you realize you're under the blood that's you're not under a banner of a church or a prophet you're under the blood of Jesus Christ I mean that's how you realize you can maintain your stand because when you realize God has made a covenant with me and if God be me who can be against me amen the Lord is my strength he's my buckler he's my strong tower he's the place I go to and letd off the pressure he's where I go to and a safe he's my defense he's my refuge He's My All In All amen and he made this Covenant with me amen that's how see that's how Daniel maintained his stand the Hebrew children right in the middle of the fiery furnace no matter what you do to them you can't Scorch that Fellowship away from them you can't throw them under enough trials to make them deny it amen a man that's ever been under the blood of Jesus Christ and become filled with the Holy Ghost all the devils in Hell couldn't root it out of him amen he knows where he stands you think I'm crazy swinging my hands but if you felt like I did you'd jump in your seat and do the same thing Hallelujah when really realize we are safe and secure under the blood of Jesus Christ this Satan's Eden can't root it out of us no devil in hell can root it out of us amen why because we're sealed to the day of our Redemption see Daniel when he left Israel he realized I'm a circumcised son of Abraham nothing can change that Glory Hallelujah when you're sealed him by the Holy Ghost nothing can change that the devil can't make you unsealed amen he can't break that seal he can't break that he can't break that Fellowship amen it's he will'll try everything he can but he can't break it amen that's why we can Rejoice cuz nothing can root it out of us that's right what can separate us from the love of God in Christ Jesus our lord as as Paul would say he listed everything under the sun he says nothing Hallelujah so we can that's why we can stand and just rejoice in the trial we can rejoice in Satan's Ed and rejoice in this Babylon because God has ordained that we're going to live victorious in this time amen and then when he would and then Daniel would read in Jeremiah where it said there' be 70 years accomplished and you know and then and then and then the children of Israel were coming back amen and they begin to pray and seek God about when these things were going to happen because he knew the time was soon how long have we been here for that's 2024 folks that's a long time praise the Lord there's a countdown's gone on and God has made us ready to leave amen amen we're trained astronauts Hallelujah I don't know if you realized you're wearing an astronaut suit if you got the baptism of the Holy Ghost you're wearing an astronaut suit I you're you're in the space shuttle greater than the Falcon X or whatever whoever's flying trying to get to Mars no this this this machine we're in if I can call it a machine is a is a interdimensional gateway amen I it's going to take us from this world to the next world not to another planet but to a new a totally new atmosphere a totally new world totally new dimension amen so we can Rejoice we can walk in confidence you see Daniel when he read there in you as in as in Daniel 9 he began to seek God about when the um 70 years was up and things see what cuz he knew his position he knew as a circumcised son of Abraham he could seek the Lord and the Lord could open to him when these things were going to happen and we can we can have confidence that the Lord hears our prayers right that we can stand and intercede for our loved ones we have authority remember a Christian that just gave their life to the Lord a second ago has more Authority in heaven than Gabriel or one of the archangels that never fell why because they're just servants but we are the sons and daughters of the king praise the Lord amen so so when you start praying they've got to be quiet why because because our father says sh Gabriel sh Michael sh my child's talking to me and we think we're low down and we're wretched and we're never going to get anywhere but through the blood of Jesus Christ we are Perfection amen and God is waiting for us to call him on the scene amen amen and we feel like we don't maybe we just feel like our prayer just gets to the ceiling that's it and God hears every part of it we have a position and God wants us to use that position but we can't live in fear that's right see brother B says in God of this evil age I'm going to wind this up soon and when the entire word of God incomplete was headed up in the human body called Jesus Christ and there God made me pay for my sins and him there then he rose me raised me up with him in the resurrection and now we are seated with him with power and authority over every devil yeah amen now we're seated now amen over every devil oh if you could only believe what God has given but if you're not seated there you don't have it and if you're seated there and don't believe it and afraid to move you'll never use it but if you are seated there you will use it for you're ordained to do what you do amen Daniel was ordained to do what he did when they had the prayer meeting and he and and God showed the dream of Nebuchadnezzar's image and everything God showed him why because he was seated in a position and he and he was ordained to do what he did he he he used that position to get in touch with God right how about you and I amen no I'm not telling you anything new right we'll understand these things but we're going to look at the magnitude of what God has done for us amen amen praise the Lord look at the magnitude of it it's a great thing what he has done now let's just I'm just going to finish with this scripture because I'm going to go into a totally different thought I think that'll be Sunday so we'll leave that alone um but you see here it doesn't matter what happened the the the book of Acts church just kept preaching the word and Saul was consenting unto his death and um and at that time there was a great persecution against the church which was at Jerusalem and they were all scattered abroad throughout the regions of Judea Samaria except the apostles and devout men carried Steven to his burial and made a great lamentation over him as for Saul he made Havoc of the church entering into every house and and haing men and women committed them to prison therefore they that were scattered abroad went everywhere preaching the word so they continued doing what they were doing they were a witness in Jerusalem God allowed this pressure to come on they didn't crumble that's right they just kept being who they were somewhere else just like Shadrach mes and a bing on Daniel who they were in Jerusalem they were in Babylon that's right who they were in Babylon they were before the king under pressure no pressure whatever it was they were the same person when the Lord came in that that Daniel couldn't pray for 30 days he knew that law was against him but he kept doing he kept being him whereever whatever was going on did not change him right just like the apostles just like the early church whatever was going on did not changed them did not make them shut up sit down be quiet try no they were believers they knew the Lord amen God was alive that seen Mighty Miracles and wonders the word fulfilled in their day just like we have so whatever pressure came on did not change them they said Lord we're going to go serve you somewhere else where are we going I don't know but Lord you lead us you lead us by your spirit yeah amen I believe we're the same way CU God has restored us back to this whatever is going on in life just go be a Christian wherever the Lord lead you amen we should be who we are everywhere Jesus was the same in front of pilate as he was in front of Herod as he was in front of everyone he was the same Jesus with the publicans and sinners he was Jesus Jesus with Legion he was Jesus with Lazarus you know in his grave he was Jesus he was the same person everywhere he didn't change how he talked didn't change how he did his personality didn't didn't become like the people he was with he was the same I think Daniel would have been the same kind of guy we can be the same kind of person we shouldn't be a different person at home than at church than at work than at school than on the street than on online we should be the same person right we don't we shouldn't have many faces we should have one face we should be one person right that's because we can Daniel Daniel overcame everywhere he went being Daniel how about you as the Bride of Jesus Christ as as a Blood Washed redeemed filled with the Holy Ghost Christian amen so be very strong and courageous amen but I trust I trust that this year not just turning over a new leaf and making some kind of resolution but I pray as we have this prayer meeting tonight let's purpose in our heart say Lord I don't want to keep doing what I've always done I don't want to sit here in fear and doubt and trembling and double-mindedness and wondering if the promise is mine and wondering how these things are going to be I don't want to be that person anymore brother makes a statement you got to come out of unbelief to come into Faith so you got to leave behind all the negative thinking and all the trouble leave it behind that was the past I don't know anyone who clicks all calendars I think they get thrown in the bin maybe some people will do if they do that's fine but you know what I'm saying is you don't you shouldn't hold on to the Past like that normally with every month you flip it you rip off the you have there one picture on the calendar you take the old month you rip it off so it's like the Apostle Paul said forgetting the things which are in the past don't let the past Define you let his word Define who you are and walk in that amen that is our identity not not our mistakes not our family not where we came from all those things that's not who we are in heaven I won't be known for my past we won't be known for our past we won't be known we will not be identified by our troubles when we're dancing around the throne I won't say Brother Andy remember where we came out of remember how you know you know all the problem whatever you know we won't be talking about those things we will still remember testimonies of God's Deliverance but our failures and troubles and complexes Gone Gone totally and it's not in the recyle bit on your computer you can resurrect it it's deleted absolutely by the blood of Jesus Christ so why can't why don't we start living like that now amen praise the Lord let's have the musicians tonight shall we let's let's just leave it there amen it's prayer meeting night so let's walk on say Lord oh yeah I want to finish with this it was actually my first slide but we end with it and we submit ourselves to thee this morning I can say this night beginning of this new year and we ask that you will fill us all with the Holy Spirit Lord draw Us close to thee and may thy Everlasting Arms be around us and Hold Us Lord for the days are shaking and dark but the Morning Star is leading the way I'm glad some I'm glad the Morning Star is leading us amen we shall follow Lord where he leads me I will follow if it be some through the waters some through the floods some through deep trials but all through the blood oh God lead us by thy Everlasting hand until the victory is finally won and Jesus returns to the Earth sin sickness and sorrow will be ended and we'll live in this glorious Millennium with thee we are longing for that great day amen so I trust that's your heart's desire too amen wherever you leave me Lord I'll be a Christian there in sickness I'll be a Christian in sorrow I'll be a Christian
