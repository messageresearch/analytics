invite the pastor and we would like to invite the noes family and we will then towards the end of the baby dedication we want to also have the Oliver Brothers to be here ready we just got a tight schedule this morning amen praise the Lord thank you amen so yeah so brother M and sister n and come up please it's always the thing with kids you know your schedule really does change around them sometimes amen praise the Lord you just like to come up here Wonder yeah please come up here so oh okay sure please come here amen so it's a wonderful it's a wonderful thing where when we can dedicate our children into the service of God you know I was well this is when I when Gabriela was born I thought well she just got born just to leave you know cuz the Rapture is real soon amen but um yeah praise the Lord this is a wonderful day and um so so uh Momi have decided to to call their son Elijah Del note amen I thought I thought what a what a powerful name you know what a powerful name we know Elijah I just want to read one scripture from First Kings chapter 18 um if you if you have your Bibles handy if you want to read with me that's fine um you know it's a it's a um yeah First Kings chapter 18 and this is this is Elijah on Mount carel in verse 37 and this is his prayer he says Hear Me Oh Lord hear me that this people may know that thou art the Lord God and that thou Hast turned their heart back again and we know that that God always uses the spirit of Elijah to turn the people's hearts back to God and I believe that's not only the desire of of Elijah that you know his life this is my prayer for him that that that as he grows the life in him would cause people to turn back towards God the life that he's living if he should T If he if God has ordained him to preach the preach this message that not only his words but his life would cause people to turn back to the Living God and I was thinking it also is very fitting of your family and where you've come from that his his name I mean you know Elijah the spirit of Elijah has turned you amen amen it's turned you you know to serve the Living God that's right amen so such a wonderful thing and and Elijah means my God uh my God is Yahweh my God is Jehovah that's such a declaration he's my Goda amen and then um and then D is is is named after your dad uh so your dad was Derek Charles and he said it's so in England it's it's it's short for D booy It's Made short to D boy so it's to honor you know our parents they do love us amen they do the best they can you know and what they do and I think it's I thought that was quite an honor to you know to give the middle name you know your dad's name to him amen then also the you the name no it's you know it's always interesting you know last names and the name noes is someone it's it's English and it's someone who who lived by some oak trees you may think well what does that got to do with a lot of things well brother baram he he he he's talking to to to brother Osborne and this is really where where where you both come in because we understand that a baby dedication is not just a dedication of the child but it's a dedication of the parents to raise the child in the way that he should go and so this is in 52 and early spiritual experiences brother Braham says now I said now look brother Osborne get started on the right foot now now you can make a lot of noise or anything and people will follow but remember your ministry you'll answer before God for it someday I said there sets an old oak tree on my porch referring to brother Bosworth and he was a he was a old brother in the faith at that time I said who knows about Divine Healing crawl up under the tree and talk to him a little while so brother bam instructed brother Bosworth to go and follow I mean sorry he instructed brother Osborne to follow brother Bosworth and learned the ministry from him and so an oak tree is a mature tree and my prayer when I read this was that you know Elijah is is is living with two Oaks two mature ones in the faith and what you look at and behold is what you become I mean so my prayer for for your family is that he would behold he would be truly he would live out his last name amen because it's not just Ministry that are Oaks I mean it's family it's it's moms and dads that the children can look at their parents and they and they can see a life and something says I want to be like Mom and Dad amen so I pray that uh you'd always have a wonderful relationship with your son and and and with all your kids that they would see oak trees Amen in the faith hallelujah amen so let's just pray let's pray for a little while Elijah can I take you amen they're so little AR they amen let's just bow our heads in a word of prayer gracious love loving father we thank you for this love gift that you've given to Mar Naomi little Elijah dear God we just pray your Abundant Blessings upon Him Father that truly he would live out his name he would say that my God is Jesus my God is the god of the Bible the god of the message Father that you would become a living God to him even at an early age and father when he looks up at his parents Lord he would see Jesus in flesh once again thank you Father that he would be raised Lord under two big oak trees thank you father When Storms Come he can find Refuge under their branches amen than God that he can find a refuge Lord under under their Mighty branches oh God Amen and father you'd anoint the family Lord may they continue to walk in your ways thank you Lord dear God and may your love truly project to little Elijah and father May Lord may he just be drawn to you at a very young age may he be very sensitive to your spirit Lord thank you Lord we thank you Father that you allowed him to be born before the camp Oh God that even even a very early age he's been in your presence and father may he always hunger and thirst for more of you bless them Lord bless the O's family abundantly we pray we love you for them and we thank you for them Lord we thank you for a dedicated life Lord to you bless them I pray in Jesus Christ's name we ask amen amen amen amen God bless you amen God bless

you and glad to have each and every one of you here this morning it's been a wonderful atmosphere this weekend and I just feel it building from service to service and uh we're certainly looking to the Lord to uh do whatever he would have to do this morning before I turn to the word I just thought to share a couple of things with you uh many of you know that I once p pastored a church excuse me up in uh Grand Prairie Alberta which is Northern Canada and uh pastoring that church for 27 years uh then the Lord supernaturally changed events of my life to uh to cause me to move down to Cloverdale and begin to work with brother bcll in the missions work there in Cloverdale excuse me and uh he uh invited me to come after uh the events of my life had changed and we've been working with brother bis school since 2012 in missions now since we've been there or even before I got there there was a couple things that were done and I I thought just to bring to you uh a couple of things this morning just to uh give you something to pray about in the days ahead and and the work of the Lord one of the things that has been a great move of God is the uh the work of the Lord in China and uh some of you may be aware of it maybe followed the reports on the internet and that sort of thing but I wanted to bring to you something that that was a first uh as far as I know that is a Bible that has been translated by Believers that have received this message all right this is not done by a missions organization so to speak I mean we certainly have sponsored it but uh about 10 years ago the Believers in China begin to notice as they as they listen to the message and they compared it to their Bible that there were discrepancies between the Bible that brother brandham was read reading and the Bible that they had in China they only have one government approved Bible and that is what they call the union Bible and the union Bible is a translation that's missing a lot of uh key scriptures Miss and has a lot of Errors compared to the King James Bible and so the Believers begin to make notations of all of the errors that they found and they soon begin to number into the thousands of errors for example the the scripture in 1 John 5:7 that says you know there are three that bear record in heaven the Father the word and the spirit and these three are one the the the Chinese Bible doesn't even have that in their Bible and there's other scriptures that are missing some that are half missing and many grammatical and translation errors so about five years ago the Believers in China embarked on an ambitious translation project and the transl s begin to number almost uh the number of translators Rose to almost 30 translators that come comprised of of ministers and teachers and those that understood English amongst the Believers and finally this year we have published this Bible which is a first ever Bible translation in Chinese by Believers amen we thank God for that see there the brother brandom said the King James is my Bible and we love the King James Bible and and I won't go into all the uh the differences between the King James and other translations and all of that but suffice to say that that China never even had a doesn't even have a concordance they don't have dictionaries so they're unable to look at any meanings behind the words all they had was the government approved Bible and what we did is we put the King James Chinese translation in in a two column Bible right beside the existing Chinese translation so not only do they have the better translation they also can compare it to their old translation that they're used to and see the differences right there in front of them and so we thank God for that opportunity and it's being well received in China and uh and I brought one here with me and I uh I I heard from a brother that uh that his wife is Chinese and she's here uh this morning now I want that sister to have this Bible why don't you just come up here sister and come and get this Bible God bless you on behalf of the Believers in China God bless you amen praise the Lord if you want to have a look at that Bible just go and see that sister I'm sure she'd be happy to show it to you it's a very high quality Bible almost passed it around but I thought you know everybody' be looking at the Bible instead of looking at me so which might not be a bad thing I guess we every year we put out a missions uh report which is strictly Miss there's no Doctrine in here um and we we just uh uh bring a uh report to uh many of the things that are happening around the world that that not only that Bible Believers is sponsoring but some of of the works that other people are doing and and of course you can never have enough room to describe everything that God's doing but I bought a bunch here because they describe the work of the Chinese Bible and so we have this magazine I put it on the table by the entrance way where the message books are and the track are so if you want to pick one up I think I've got between 40 around 40 of them so you can Avail yourself and obviously we got more than 40 people here so we'll say one per family I think that will be sufficient and uh if you want one you probably better hurry and get one because they're probably not enough for every family that's even in this place but I trust that it'll be a blessing to you you can read about the story behind it I thought that way I wouldn't have to describe it all to you and uh everything else that is happening one more thing I want I just want to share with you uh just because it's my first time to New Zealand who knows if I'll ever get here again but I want to just bring your attention to something that we've done again for the languages that are not English uh how many of you are familiar with the message Hub mobile website how many of you know about that well just a few of you we have a message site on the internet called messag hub. info I nfo and and on there we have the the message in 67 languages in printable form and so it's for people in missions work around the world that they can download it and print it right on their computer uh and we have uh do you have the other picture uh that that had showed the website maybe we could look at that one first no that that yeah messag hub. info if you would look at that just yeah that's it right there the very top very top did it perfect there we go all right this is the website that you'll see on the internet just click over to the English names on the second tab there top top up up up right there there we go I don't have the mouse here so I can't control it there we go so so there these are all of the languages that we have on the internet there and uh and we've we have maintained that for years but we just a couple years ago we began to work on a on an application for Android phones uh many people ask me brother Tim is it available on iPhone and I say no I'm sorry it's not two reasons I said um one of them is that that uh 90% of the world are on Android phones and iPhone is is probably I got one amen the rest of you are on iPhones I assume which is a good thing for my next comment because iPhones are largely a first world phenomena and uh those that have iPhones have a lot of money you got my point and uh we'd love to get it over to iPhone but it's going to take some money and and so uh but we got it on Android and we've used our resources to do that and you can go to the other picture if you would and it's available for free on the uh Google Play Store and it's an application that uh and I'm going to actually pull it up on my phone and uh those of you that are at the front will be able to see it a little bit we have on this application 12 languages already ready and more being loaded as we speak so we're taking the languages off the message Hub and putting it into a into a uh application for Android phones you can go and download it on on Google Play If there if there's more than one brother that has an Android phone and uh uh there you'll find you can choose any or all of the translate uh the languages that are there such as uh we have of course the English language but we have the Chinese the Dutch Polish Russian Vietnamese French Indonesian Croatian Slovenian Slovakian Serbian and the same thing is available in all the languages in one application all right now what what it is it's a bible-based application so and I'll just show it the people at the front will be able to see it I just pull up the Bible here which is what you see here on the screen and I'll I'll maybe show it to the young people they can they can kind of see that and so you see the Bible comes up there but you see the little blue numbers beside the verses all right there's some little blue numbers there that are beside the verses those are links to the message those are the momas links that brother momas developed and uh sister momas uh graciously allowed us to have them so that if a person just presses on that link you just press on that number there it takes you right into the places where brother brandham mentions that scripture and so it lists the quotes where brother brandham talks about that particular scripture and so then if you actually click on that uh on that quote any one of the quotes on the list it then takes you right into the full message all right it's very simple and the reason we made it simple is to be attractive especially to new Believers all right it's it is searchable so that anyone that has it in their language can search the message in their language so it gives all of these languages a searchable application that they never had before all right and that's great for many reasons as we know because doctrinal errors are solved by giving people the message it's just that simple and so uh it's not a matter of us of teaching we have to teach we we need to preach and we need to bring out the things of the message but even as preaching the preaching should make the people hungry for the message more hungry not less hungry for the message because it's the message is the love letter of God to his bride to get us ready for the Rapture amen so so in reality form what we have here is all of these Bibles in these different languages it's a Bible app and the inspiration came from the Chinese people because the Chinese people are Avid readers on their smartphones what we call these smartphones or tablets or whatever it might be and so they like to read and so it it it's in China uh Chinese was the first language that we added and then linking to the message it makes brother brandham the commentary on the Bible and so that's a powerful thing for the last day's message amen so so somebody might not be a believer might download the app down get a free Bible app and it links them right into the message of the hour and if there's any predestinated seed there there's enough power to Quicken that seed and so those are some of the things that we're doing again I'm not going to go into everything I just wanted to share those two things that I think are impactful to everybody around the world and uh would you just remember us in prayer uh we don't send the the faith challenge reports around the world anymore the the postage from Canada has gotten extremely expensive but I brought a few with me and I trust that they'll be a blessing to you you know the Lord has has opened a lot of his word already this weekend you know it's been the meetings have been full I I've been amazed at at how much you've pulled uh not not surprised amazed and you know I believe God's bride is in love with the word because the word in spirit form is her bridegroom and so the bride loves the bridegroom and that's what we're here to minister and any minister is not to get in between the bride and the bridegroom but it's to connect the bride directly to the bridegroom and so we we appreciate that in every Ministry that God uh brings into the body of Jesus Christ you know I I always tell the brothers at home I said we all have unique gifts and it and it ranges in the Spectrum it's there's apostles prophets evangelist pastors teachers everybody has their unique gift and it ranges all the way from teachers on one end of the spectrum to evangelists on the other end of the spectrum and the reason I say it that way is because when evangelists over here look at teachers they say they're too intellectual and when teachers way over here look at evangelists they're too emotional and so you know everybody looks at each other through their own eyes and there's nobody if they're called of God we don't want to be too intellectual or too emotional but there is a mind of Christ that we all want to enter into and be what God has made us to be so I trust that as every member of the body yields themsel whether it be a minister or whether it be another member of the body that God will use you for the full purpose that he has designed to accomplish in your life amen how many want to be useful in the kingdom of God you know there's enough power in this message to transform a life transformed yours transform mine praise be to God it'll transform somebody else's somebody just told me one day about serpent seed it was somebody it's a long story I won't go into it but uh that was the what caught me when when somebody who had only been in the message for six months told me what serpent seed was it totally changed the course of my life and and so I saw the original sin saw many other things in the Bible and God has a way of doing it that he knows how to catch somebody don't ever be ashamed of the message of the hour I'm not ashamed of the Gospel of Jesus Christ for it is the power of God un salvation to them that believe amen are you ready this morning for the word amen let's take our Bibles and turn to Hebrews chapter 12 you can stand with me if you like in honor of the word as we read our opening scripture you know we find in the places of the Bible like in Ezra and Nehemiah the people stood the whole service but we probably wouldn't be able to preach as long if we if we did that but we have the Comfort we enjoy you know back we have uh in our a lot of our churches we have air conditioning you know when we come into a warm place like this we need fans here there everywhere blowing on us and we appreciate that because we've come to a very hybrid age and these bodies don't have the stamina and the and the strength that they used to have and there's a lot of different reasons for that but I believe the word is more powerful in this age than it has ever been and and though men have grown weaker and wiser I believe that God has sent a message to draw us closer to the Lord Jesus Christ than any age has ever been I appreciate brother Andy's comments about energy and and strength and I'm going to take that home with me I'm going to use that and uh you know we ought to give him the Bible says what is the greatest commandment the greatest commandment if you love the Lord thy God with all thy heart with all thy mind with all thy soul and with all thy strength that's the greatest commandment of all let's just bow our heads together in a word of prayer wonderful Redeemer king of kings and Lord of lords you are the Prince of Peace you're the almighty one you're the creator of heavens and earth Lord we call you the rose of Sharon the lily of the valley the bride and Morning Star we rejoice in your presence oh God because of how great you are and it's been so well described in song it's been described in exhortations but Lord we want father not to describe it by your word but we want you to come and reveal yourself to us personally through your word father oh Lord only you are the discerner of the thoughts of our hearts there is no secret hidden from you oh God so come by our way this morning oh Lord and make yourself known unto us as only you can father the preacher can speak what word you have put into him Lord as you would anoint it and Inspire it but it still takes the Holy Spirit to take that word and signify it in the hearts and minds of the people Lord we're relying on you this morning to just bring about the fullness of the measure of what you would accomplish today Lord we have this little bit of time this morning we're surrendering it to you Lord focus our minds focus our thoughts because Lord we love you you've blessed us so much hallu you've given us so many things oh God we feel like as we said in the first service though you cast us into hell we still love you Lord Lord we pray that you'll just anoint the reading and the speaking of your word for your glory in Jesus Christ's name amen Hebrews chapter 12 and verse 5 and you have forgotten the exhortation that speaketh unto you as unto children or we could say Sons my son despise not thou the chastening of the Lord nor faint when thou art rebuked of him for whom the Lord loveth he chasteneth and scourges every son that he receiveth that word receiveth means to acknowledge as his own if you endure chastening God deals with you as with sons for what son is he whom the father Chase not but if you be without chastisement whereof all are partakers then are you bastards and not Sons furthermore we have had fathers of our flesh which corrected us and we gave them reverence shall we not much rather be in subjection unto the father of spirits and live for they verily for a few days chastened us after their own pleasure but he for our profit that we might be partakers of his holiness and that word Holiness is not necessarily just holy living but it's his nature that we might be partakers of his holy nature and now it says now no chastening for the present seems to be joyous but Grievous nevertheless afterward it yields the Peaceable fruit of righteousness unto them which are exercised thereby amen the Lord add his Blessing to the word you may be seated amen you can put up the the PowerPoint if you would for me right away I want to speak about the name of the sons of God and God dealing with you as with sons is my subject and and we're we're wanting to we're living in the time as I think uh brother Ben said the other day we're we're in the ripening of the crop the crop the wheat uh we know Matthew Chapter 13 describes the two seeds that were swn and how that there was tear swn and wheat swn and in the last days the the or in the beginning the reaper said should we pull the tears out and he said no let them grow together until the last days and then gather first the tears and they'll be bundled and burned and that's what's happened in these last days first the tears are being bound even right out of the message see they it's got to happen that that the Reapers would come and separate the false seed from amongst the ranks of the wheat and so we see that even happening within the message because they must be bound to denominationalism that's why they can as we say go back to denomination because they're actually not of the wheat they look like wheat but as the wheat matures it shows the difference between the tears and the wheat and so now as the tears are separated out then the wheat lays in the presence of the sun to ripen all the greenness out of her we've been laying in the presence of the revealed word the es n of God to take all of the greenness out of our lives and bring us to a maturity because God is not marrying a little girl he's marrying a mature woman one that has become the word on display in her day and so when we speak of maturity we are speak speaking of God bringing us to a place that he can fully reflect himself through us because the woman is the glory of the husband amen amen are we here this morning amen the woman is the glory of the husband amen the church is the glory of Christ he's separating out everything that's false because this church will truly reflect his glory as the scripture says from glory to glory we are changed as into his glorious image and so we're coming now into that time where the fullness of the word is not just revealed but it must be on display all right so it's not just character but its usefulness in this world God displaying himself and manifesting himself in this world now on the other side there are no babies no babes in Christ all right it's this side that there are babes in Christ but the word comes to mature us into the very image of Christ now let's just deal with this a little bit from the the approach of Hebrews chapter 12 it says now no chastening for the present Seth to be joyous but Grievious nevertheless afterward after your chastised anybody here ever been spanked before praise the Lord there I don't think there's any child welfare people in here so you can don't need to be ashamed to raise your hand and uh you know I I think most of us that are at least come to the age of accountability have been spanked before and uh why it's chastening that for a few days we were chastened by our Earthly parents and it's but a few days certainly when you reach my age you realize my youth was too short and as one person said the thing about you is that it's wasted on the youth let that one sink in for a little bit all right and so we realize excuse me for saying that young people all right and so we realize that God has a purpose and he Likens it to our Earthly existence but God chastens with nail scarred hands all right his chastening is different than our Earthly parents because our Earthly parents do it for their own purpose but God does it that he might reflect himself within us praise be to God and so we realize now that that there's a chastening now I want you to catch this afterwards it yieldeth the Peaceable fruit of righteousness unto them that are exercised thereby I want to take this term exercised thereby so there's there's something that happens there's a process that takes place that begins to exercise as Paul says here let's let's just take the the scripture now and jump to chapter 5 and verse 12 I have it up here on the screen for you as Paul speaks to the Hebrew church he says for when the time you ought to be teachers you have need that one teach you again what which be the first principles of the Oracles of God and are become such as have need of milk and not of strong meat so as he's speaking to the Hebrew Church he's saying you ought to be a whole lot more mature than you are now you ought to have come up a lot further than you've come now but you know uh there are those that are capable of taking strong meat he says for everyone that uses milk and this is a babe in Christ is unskillful in the word of righteousness all right it's not that he's not a Believer it's not that he's born again when you're born again you're a babe in Christ but he's unskillful in the word of righteousness for he is a babe but strong meat belongeth to them that are of full age and the word full age there means mature all right even those who by reason of use have their senses exercised there's that terminology again to discern both good and evil so when you're born again you have a certain level of discernment but as you grow in Christ God works on you to bring you to a maturity to recognize what is good and what is evil as the Apostle Paul says all things are lawful but not all things are expedient not everything edifies our lives or edifies the body of Jesus Christ many times as we're just babes in Christ and and certainly our young people growing up within the church they say well what's really wrong with this or what's really want wrong with that well the those that are a little more mature in the word they realize those things won't edify you those things won't Build You Up they might not necessarily be evil within themselves there's a lot of things that are not evil within themselves but if they get away in the way of our growth in Christ then they are evil anything that gets between us and God is an idol he's to be our first love and he's very jealous over the Bride of Jesus Christ in the Amplified version we'll pick up these two verses in in chapter 5 it says but solid food is for full grown men for those whose senses and mental faculties are trained by practice to discriminate and distinguish between what is morally good and Noble and what is evil and contrary to either Divine or human law all right so notice what's contrary to not just those things which are spiritual but but also to those things which are natural the things that are good for you spiritually and naturally amen you reach a certain age brother ELR you're probably not there yet but you reach a certain age where where you realize it's time for me to take care of my body you know when you're young you eat all the sweets you want to you you eat all the fast food that you want to am I the only one that ever did that anybody here like McDonald's sure how many out there like McDonald's that's a less percentage isn't it why anybody over here like McDonald's all right I'm not promoting McDonald's here this morning but we realize that at this age we all love I used to love McDonald's too that's all right their milkshakes are awesome and and so you know we used to go to McDonald's I used to eat all the McDonald's have a Big Mac have a quarter pounder with cheese have french fries have milkshakes now if I ate that my body would tell me you have done the wrong thing all right I just can't handle it the way I used to handle it why because there's been a maturity in a growth and realizing that the things that I did in my youth I'm now paying the price for All right so so we do a lot of things without moderation and everything and you know as brother brandham says even we have to learn that you can do anything too much except pray all right and so we realize that prayer is the most important thing that we can spend our time on all right and so that means then that we could even study too much and brother brandom says in one place he says I realize that people do study too much you know they put there try and figure things out they try and place things he says you don't need to do that he says you just need to love the Lord and walk on loving the Lord he said that's what it's all about you see this is a supernatural walk not an intellectual walk it's a personal relationship with the Lord Jesus Christ and as I begin to teach these things today I want you to realize that it's not about you understanding how to do things but it's so you can understand how to have a better relationship with the Lord Jesus Christ amen how many of you have been married here more than seven years all right praise the Lord she's your fault Brothers all right now we realize in marriage that it's a process when we're first married you know we're just so in love that we Overlook each other's faults and we Overlook our own inability to communicate and so the wife allows the husband to do certain things the husband allows the wife to do certain things that maybe in themselves are a little bit hurtful but they don't notice it so much because there's just this great overwhelming atmosphere of Love But as time goes on and these things accumulate pretty soon we understand in the relationship you know what if you keep doing that you're going to give me a complex if you keep treating me that way you know that that's not going to suit me very well and so then we begin to communicate and we begin to discuss we begin to our love begins to grow because we begin to understand each other better is that right and as we begin understand each other better then the marriage relationship grows and it grows and it grows amen I don't see brother Tony and his wife they're probably sitting at the back this morning oh they're right at the front here I look right past them oh you're brave you're very brave and uh you know they as they said last night they love each other more now than they did when they first got married amen we're all the same way and so we realize there's a growth in it that we are trained say Hebrews chapter 12 says for the time being no discipline brings Joy nobody's happy when Dad says get to your room I'll be there in a minute I I could just tell by the reaction who's heard those words amen I'll meet you there as he takes his belt off and whatever else he uses for discipline or whatever I don't know if I'm contravening the laws of New Zealand actually when I say that but you know it's not very pleasant when you hear those words there's no joy there's nobody that says yes Dad I've been waiting for this all day amen why not there's no joy in discipline there's no joy in getting spanked there's no joy in getting grounded there's no joy in having your cell phone taken away I'm just giving you an idea praise the Lord there's no joy in those things but seems Grievious and painful I remember when I was there but afterwards it yields a Peaceable fruit of righteousness to those who have been trained by it all right now let's go to the spiritual because we realize that in the spiritual as the Bride of Jesus Christ we are born as babies in Christ you know God said concerning his bride in in Ezekiel chapter 16 I believe it is he says I found you in the field in your own blood what's he talking about a newborn baby he says I washed you I suckled you I I clothed you I I did all this for you and you grew up and you matured and so on and so forth what was that you started out as a babe but I took care of you in your baby condition that wasn't the time of Love maturity was the time of love but there was a time that I watched over you and watched over your every footstep and all of those kind of things because we realize in the spiritual realm there must come a maturity that God is looking for now he has to in order to bring us maturity he has to train us what's good and what's not good what's good for us what's not good good for us what will lead us to where he wants us to be which is the greatest place of pleasure on what will take us away from God and is the greatest place of grief and suffering and so as God leads us to the right place he trains Us in that because we must have the right character to receive the blessings of God we realize that character is not a gift it's a victory statements that we're familiar with and so at being a victory we have to go through some things because power without character is demonic but Power with character is fit to rule to him that overcometh will I grant to sit with me where in my Throne so this is the hour of the greatest power that's been loosed in the church but it's also required that the church have greater character than any other age that's why the Saints in the in the in the church ages God could wink at their ignorance because God wasn't pouring into them the full revelation of the word their lives were would fall short as a I think brother Ben said you know if Luther was here we'd say this guy needs to get to the altar you know he needs a further work of God in his life you know Wesley the same way and different ones and the attitudes that they have but now God is perfecting our character because he's brought the fullness of the word the title deed and the power which the title deed operates there's so much more potential within the church than ever before now how many believe that there's more Revelation in the church in this age than any other age all right now that means it's at your fingertips now what did the Apostle Paul said he said lest I be exalted by the abundance abundance of Revelation there was given to me a thorn in the flesh a messenger of Satan to Buffet me why was he saying that he says because of all that God was revealing to me God also had to make me suffer to keep me humble because all that God is revealing to you he has to take you through trials and testing to keep you humble see we want the power and the Revelation without the character or the suffering that makes the character because simply said as brother brandham said in the church ages character is not made without suffering that's sure not pleasant is it I was reading an article here not long ago and and uh it was an interesting perspective because it's especially for a worldly person and they said you know often we ask the question what do you want out of life what do you want out of life we often ask the young people that what do you what do you want to get out of life I want to let them sink that sink in a little bit where where do you want to end up at you know maybe the sisters would say well you know I I want to be a housewife and I want to have children I want to have a nice home a nice car all those sorts of things the brothers might say you know I want to a nice career I want to have a a good paying job that that maybe would make me uh some money or maybe I want to go into business or I want to drive a fancy car uh I don't know what a fancy car is down here in New Zealand and you know I want to drive a a Lamborghini or a Maserati or or a Corvette or yeah Smiles are coming on their faces now and uh you know I I want to you know have these kind of things and he says but really that's not the right question the guy in the article said so the real question is what are you willing to suffer cuz a lot of times we go it's not where we're going it's what price we're willing to pay to get there all right I likened it to to some brothers in our some young Brothers in our church who are known to be very athletic and and love to work out anybody work out on weights so so can't tell um I'm just I'm just teasing you can't tell that I work out either can you but there's some brothers in our church I'm so sorry for that I'm sorry I said that that just kind of slipped out you H me one I'll buy you lunch all right now as we as we look at these kind of things these young Brothers I got a couple young Brothers in the church they get up at 5:00 in the morning and they go to the gym and they work out they run they do their exercises they push weights all those kind of things and I got there's one young brother in the church and I'll just say this for his benefit if he knows I told you he'd kill me but you know he came to my house one time when I still lived in the north and tried to work out on my weights and just about killed himself and you know it's just an exercise physical exercise profiteth little but but he since then it it motivated him to work harder and push weights and he's he's very strong and very athletic why aren't you very strong and very athletic brother ALR I'll tell you why all right I'll give you the secret because you're not willing to pay the price it's the same reason I'm not I'm not willing to give up the chocolate cake I'm not willing to give up the sweets I'm not willing to give up the food I'm not willing to get up at 5:00 a.m. just to go to the gym and sweat see there's a the point is there's a price to pay there's something what are you willing to suffer to get what you want you know there I I was over in in uh Europe uh a couple years ago preaching at a convention and I stopped I actually took my children to visit the Canadian Army Cemetery from the second world war actually first and second world war and uh and there was a lot of names on a lot of tombstones I forget how many thousand were there and I was looking at the names you know like John Smith or Fred Adams or something and the AG is 21 years old 19 years old 22 years old a father a husband all right left behind wives some of them single their whole life ahead of them but they gave their life for a cause there were willing to pay the price in their thoughts it was worth their life to give give for freedom in Europe all right we don't know those kind of things right now but I I'll say to all of you and especially to the young people what's worth your life you're you've got your whole life ahead of you but what's worth it what's worth spending everything that you are I want to tell you this gospel is worth it this message is worth every ounce of energy that you can pour into it this is the only transforming power of God in this generation and giving your life to it I see Sister Christine raising her hand back there and she was telling me how that God revealed to her what her hus who her husband was to be and how that all worked in their marriage relationship and and I said to brother Ben afterwards I says the reason that she uh I or at least I believe the reason that God had to reveal to her even more supernaturally than he revealed it to you was because the wife of a pastor has a heavy load amen amen and there's a great I know what that is it's there's a great price to be paid by a pastor's wife constantly in Hospitality constantly raising children constantly entertaining guests constantly doing all those kind of things it's a calling but it's willing you but it's worth spending your life for whatever God has called you to do or called you to be it's you have to ask yourself the question is this the cause I'm willing to spend my life for I'm not willing to spend my life I'll just say a few things for video games I'm not willing to spend my life for internet I'm not even willing to spend my life for a career I had a career I was on a fast rising Fast Track in the banking industry I was in management moving qu very quickly up the ladder every year getting a promotion but when this message came by my way I counted that as more value than what that career was offering me and I left that behind for this Moses esteemed the reproach of Christ greater treasure than the riches of Egypt think about it that'd be like being the king of United States that's the greatest nation in the world having everything your Beck can call Money women anything possession that you wanted lands and and travel and everything else anything that Moses could have wanted he says I take all that on put it on one end of scale and I put the reproach of Christ on the other into the scale and the reproach of Christ outweighs everything else Hall amen that's the reality of the power and the value of the revealed word of God would you put that back up for me so it says if you endure chastening God deals with you as with sons for what son is he whom the father chasteneth not Paul's actually taking it from Proverbs chapter 3 he says says my son despise not thou the chastening of the Lord neither be weary of his correction who are the Proverbs written by largely by Solomon and so the wisest man that was known on the face of the Earth he writes these things for whom the Lord loveth he correct I want you to catch that now because we'll come back to this Solomon is writing this whom the Lord loveth he correct even as a father the son in whom he delighted amen so I want to just drop this in will a bab in Christ go up in the Rapture absolutely if he's a babe he's born again no matter how young he is he'll go up anyway so just drop that in just to balance it as we're talking about maturity maturity does not produce a Rapture maturity produces usefulness the new birth produces the Rapture all right so God dealth with you as with son I want to look at the word here Sun just for a moment and the word sun in the in the scripture uh is actually the in the Hebrew word Ben uh so that's the like you've maybe heard of David benan was one of the founding fathers of the Modern Nation of Israel and Ben meaning son is saying David's son of gurian he's identifying himself even though that wasn't his real name that was a name that he took on but he was identifying himself in connection with gurian so he he was actually saying something about himself that he was a furtherance of gurian by making that statement now we realize that we rais Sons as we raise sons that we can only take our sons so far we we try to uh train them we try to get them the best education whatever might help them in their future life but there comes a time that Sons need to be on their own they need to be uh taking control of their lives and especially allowing the Lord to take control of their lives because their Earthly parents can only take them so far it takes God to take them all the way to who they are all right and we realize that the Bible says that the word is a discerner of the thought and intents of the heart dividing a Sunder between Soul and Spirit it's a sharp two-edged sword dividing us under between Soul and Spirit what does that mean what is your soul and what is your spirit your soul is where the predestinated seed is it is who you are your spirit is what you think you are memories reasonings conscience affections your spirit is molded by your culture it's molded by your home it's molded by your education it's molded by your environment your memories your reasonings all that kind of stuff is is is a process in your life that you become what you think you're a certain something many times we have to be careful as parents what we say to our children because that will Lodge within their minds all right so as we speak something to them uh you know there's been many people that have been told for example Albert Einstein was told at a young age he'll never amount to anything he you know he he learned to to talk late in life he learned you know he was didn't do extremely well at school and it was lodged in his mind you'll never be nothing well he became one of the greatest Minds that the world ever had you see so we got to be careful what we say because that's what we the young people begin to think about themselves I'll just leave you to do that so what happens now back up for me sorry I didn't mean to Point At You what what happens is uh is that a a child grows up a certain way we all grow up a certain way even we can even go into our later years with a certain idea of who we are but the word comes comes to divide between what you think you are and what God says you are all right so the word comes and with a sharp two-edged sword and separates out all the wrong things of what we thought see brother Brandon makes it was asked a question and I have it here and he and he said um let that's a question if the case may be that the devil is placing thought thoughts in your mind about a certain thing how may it be overcome or got rid of brother Bram says take the very vice versa says if the devil makes you think that he says if you know you're a Christian and he tries to make you think you're not a Christian he says take the very vice versa I am a Christian as long as your experience matches in God's word all right that's I'm sorry I thought I had a different quote there I'll go back to the other quote and there there's another question in questions and answers brother Bram has asked how can I tell the difference between my thoughts and the devil's thoughts you ever wondered that well a few honest people brother Bron makes a statement he says if it's the devil's thoughts or rather if it's contrary to the word it's the devil's thoughts if it agrees with the word it's God's thoughts period and of discussion or brother Tim where is my thoughts brother Brown said the devil's thoughts and God's thoughts that's all you have in your mind you have either the devil's thoughts or God's thought oh brother Tim don't I think yeah as a man thinketh in his heart so is he not in his mind well then what is the mind for he will tell you that the mind is is a generator of original thoughts but actually the Mind does not generate a single thought the Mind receives thoughts receives re thoughts thoughts either from the devil or from God and what you are you are a free moral agent in your soul you have to decide what thoughts you accept and what thoughts you reject you see that's why the greatest battle ever fought is in the mind and so you've got to get the holy spirit in your soul the word in your soul that will on the battleground of your mind see that's why many times we don't understand how can I leave the service and not remember everything that was said I enjoyed so much of the service and then I leave and I forget half of it why do I do that that's because in your soul there's no memory that's in your mind see you're not to receive the word in your mind you're to receive it in your soul by faith and then when God has need of it he brings it back to your remembrance brings it out on the Battleground to combat the enemy and so we realize now brother Tim why are you going into all those things because once you're born again it's having your senses exercised to discern both good and evil see it's a training ground of how to deal with the devil and and how to receive God in your mind if you can operate in that real in your spirit real because you're sealed already to the day of your Redemption but it's in your spirit that we operate because we're a human being we have a human spirit and we have to operate the word of God because the soul controls the spirit the spirit controls the body but if the same spirit that Jesus that raised Jesus from the dead dwell in you in your heart it shall Quicken your mortal body amen what bring it subject to the word of God Amen now what is a son go ahead it's a builder of the family name so now you as a son if God calls you his son you're not building your own name you're building the family name what is the family name Jehovah what is the family name Jesus the name the Jehovah of the Old Testament is Jesus of the new Jesus said I came in my father's name amen he said he prayed he said Lord I have or father I have declared unto them thy name he didn't say my name he said thy name amen uh sanctify them through the truth Thy word is truth many things like that give me the the next one what is the name what exactly does a name mean you've got a name I've got a name and we're all we're sons and we we have this process that God is taking us through and and uh and we've got we're called Sons because of a certain aspect and I I'm just going to stop there just for a moment and go back to the thought of sons I say I just left something out here it's good to have notes sometimes because you might leave a key out here for understanding but the term son is L like the term the children of Israel literally means the son of Israel all right belshazzar in the Bible is called the son of Nebuchadnezzar even though he's actually his grandson all right so I want you to catch in the Hebrew son means something more than just an offspring all right it doesn't just mean this man impregnated a woman she had a child it was a boy that's his son no it means much much more than that all right they are those that take on and build the family name they are Sons that's why God does not have grandsons that's right amen he only has sons all right those In Those whom he receiveth or those he claims as his own son so it's it's literally meaning that the the life the sons of God means that the life came from God and the image of God is passed onto that son Genesis 1 says God created man in his own image at Genesis 5 says Adam lived in 130 years and begat a son in his own likeness in his own image Genesis 9 says when a who so sheds a man's blood by man shall his blood be shed for in the image of God made he man all right so men and women lost the original life you still with me I know you're listening closely we came out from the Garden of Eden we were born in sin shaped in iniquity we come into the world speaking lies but we always were the sons of God all right we did not become the sons I'll get to that in a moment but we always were but then the Bible says in John 1 as many as received him to them gave he power to become the sons of God it doesn't make you Sons it give empowers you to be what you were always meant to be all right to them that believe on his name which are born not of blood nor of the will of the flesh nor of the will of man but of God all right so it's a builder of the family name the name is a Mark or Memorial of individuality this is an important foundation because it a name represents a specific something that is identified with that name it represents honor it represents Authority it represents character of the individual give me the next line all right it's the it's only the thought expressed that declares the character of the individual it's not the thought that declares the character it's the thought expressed that declares the character all right what I'm saying here is going back to the Garden of Eden people often people that are not willing to acknowledge the original sin they try and place it somewhere well it was Disobedience that caused Adam and Eve to be cast out of the Garden of Eden that's true but what was the Disobedience how did that Disobedience become expressed see there had to be an action so is it in character character is based on your action and in particular I Zer in on your decisions because it's the nature on the inside that causes the decisions in the mind if the nature is unbelief then the Mind makes the wrong decisions but if the nature is Faith then that can come on the Battleground exercise your life to discern between what is right and what is wrong train you to make the right decisions because like Adam you're were free IMM moral agent praise be to God all right now your name means something but God's name is eternal in genes or in Exodus chapter 3 Moses says to God he says when I am come unto the children of Israel and shall say to them the god of your fathers has sent me unto you and they shall say to me what is his name he says what shall I say unto them now he didn't know him as Jehovah all right so God had not yet revealed himself in that way but so God says to Moses I am that I am and he said thus Thou shalt say unto the children of Israel I am has sent me the present God I want you to go tell them the god that is on the scene the god that is present with you not a god of yesterday I don't want you to look at me as the god of Abraham Isaac and Jacob anymore amen I want you to look at me as your God I don't want you to look at me as the god of William brandham anymore I want you to look at me as your God he's the I am he's the present one that is present to fulfill his word neither is he the I will be looking forward to something as though the Rapture is something a far off the Rapture isn't something a far off the Rapture is his bride the bride is the rapture in in flesh and the process she is going through is called a Rapture shout voice and trumpet firstly a message to gather the people together is that right and so we see that there's a process that God has put us in he's the I am and then in Exodus chapter 20 he says says to Israel I am the Lord thy God that Lord is Jehovah JV huu or uh some people say YH wh and that's where they get the word Yahweh from and they they have all kinds of different iterations that they want to give to the name that's not relevant he's making himself known by the name Jehovah and he says which have brought thee out of the land of Egypt out of the house of bondage he says Thou shalt have no other gods before me and then he then we jump down he says Thou shalt not take the name of the Lord thy God in vain now we always know that as swearing but it's much more than that it's actually don't call yourself by my name if you're not of me amen don't take my name in vain for I will not hold him Guiltless who takes my name in vain he or she who calls themselves a Christian you can only call yourself a Christian by surrendering yourself to the Lord Jesus Christ and saying I am God's it's 100% Christianity there's no such thing as 99% Christianity amen it's a complete surrender and a complete separation from all unbelief amen what is it it's your decision and those that are able to make that decision God says those are my sons I give them my name so a son is the genes through whom God is EST abl lishing his name or identity in Genesis chapter 2 brother Bram says he he said I am uh yah yahu Jehovah what did it mean I am the all- existent one who created something off of myself to be a son of mine or a temporary or a little amateur one of mine oh I got to read that again he says I I am the Alle existent one who created something off of myself to be a son of mine or a temporary or an amateur little one of mine amen so who are we we are created off of God for a purpose Amen to be an amateur little God to be an amateur Jehovah and then he says Jehovah means that he gave man to be an amateur God because he is Father God and he made man an amateur God so he isn't self-existent anymore he exists with his family this is a key key thought in the scripture that we have to understand who we are in this life because you know Elijah called Israel up to Mount Carmel and he makes this makes the statement and he says if ba if Jehovah be God then serve him if Baal be God then serve him what is he saying there he's he's pronouncing something there to Israel you need to make a decision what name are you identified in because in the Hebrew he's actually saying if Jehovah be Elohim serve him but if Baal be Elohim serve him so the question is not is there an Elohim which is the self-existing god but the question is what is the name of that God Amen and that name has must be what you are identified in in his name cuz brother bradam said give me the next qu slide please next one Jehovah means the one who exists with his family now catch that statement he was Elohim back before there was anything he was Elohim the self-existing God but in his thoughts he was Jehovah but to be Jehovah meant he had a family in other words he can't be Jehovah without you it's not just we're adding oursel he is only Jehovah because he has manifested you before that he's only Elohim but he had a desire to express the thoughts that was in his mind because by doing that that makes him Jehovah Hallelujah so we are the very expression of his name that's why a son means a builder of the family name Hallelujah so because we are here we are expressing his name we are the expression of Jehovah you are the expression of Jehovah that's why we say it's the word made flesh today what is it it's Jehovah expressing himself in his family Jesus making himself known in his bride it's the same expression it's the name declared that's why you know people that aren't willing to take on that name in baptism I don't understand it I am that name expressed I am not a title expressed I am not a father I am not a son I'm not a holy spirit but I am a Jesus expressed Jesus attribute manifested in flesh all right let me go to the church age book here you still with me can I go a little further all right I was a little quieter all right so he goes says down through the centuries we could go we find a Moses a Jeremiah John the Baptist and each one of these were God's Eternal thought expressed in its season then we come to Jesus the logos he was perfect the perfect and complete thought expressed and he became known as the word that is what he is and forever will be see Jesus is not something that is separate or or not is something that is just another attribute he's the fullness of the attributes he's all of God dwelling in flesh before I go on there I want to just read a a statement here brother Bram makes in total Deliverance he says Jesus was completely totally man he could cry like a man he could eat like a man he could become like a man he was completely totally man in his physical being and in his Spirit he was completely totally God so he made his flesh submissive to the spirit that was in him you see he was tempted in all manner like as we are he was a man not an angel he was a man he had desires and temptations like we do doesn't the bible say that he was tempted in all manner like as we are except without sin we're tempted and we fall but he was tempted and he never fell and so brother brandom goes on he said the Holy Ghost was in him without measure but the holy spirit is in us with measure or by measure we have a portion of the Holy Ghost he had the fullness of the Holy Ghost that's why he had to go to Calvary that the life that was in him the Life In The Blood could be loosed upon the church the feminist part could come into manifestation the church could be taken out of Christ like Eve was taken out of Adam so that she Adam could say she's Flesh of My Flesh bone of my bone but Christ could say he we're flesh of his flesh bone of his bone life of his life amen we're his very expression all right so in him was the Holy Ghost without measure and he was completely God he proved it when he raised the Dead when he stopped nature the Roaring Seas the mighty winds when he spoke to the trees so forth they obeyed him he was God on the inside he could have been man for he was man but he totally and completely delivered himself as a man into the hands of God for the service of God and he is our example we are men and women we're also Christians if he's our example let us completely deliver ourselves into the hands of the Holy Ghost that we might be subjects of the kingdom of God Amen all right so he's the full expression of the thought but Moses Jeremiah John the Baptist they were also expressions of God's thoughts God's thoughts are Eternal he never thought a new thought but he expresses those thoughts in their season in very plain language he says the true bride of Christ was in the mind of God eternally though not expressed until each came forth in the designated decreed season and each member that's you and me that's came forth as each member came forth it became expressed and took its place in the body so why did you come forth to take your place in the body thus this bride is the literal spoken word seed bride what is it we are his word that was spoken for this age that's why we couldn't receive another message when this message was spoken the Deep was responding to the Deep call that's in you and only you could receive this message amen it's not for everybody give it to a million people you might find one why because it was only sent for that one and that's why God doesn't do a mass mail out program of the message God knows who that one is he doesn't need to introduce the message to the other 999,999 he's looking for that one in a million amen amen right now then here we are coming to a conclusion pay close attention here as the Eternal logos was manifested in the Sun and in Jesus dwelt all the fullness of the godhead bodily and that Eternal one was the father manifested in flesh is that right and thereby or by being the father manifested in flesh he G gain the title of son so how was Jesus a son because he was the father manifested in flesh amen even so we let me stop on that statement even so we that means the same as Jesus so are we we're not the fullness but we're a portion we are Sons and Daughters of God even so we Eternal in his thoughts in our turn became the many membered spoken word seed manifested in flesh Hallelujah as Jesus was was the word manifested in flesh gaining the title of son we are the word manifested in flesh and those Eternal thoughts now manifested in flesh are the sons of God even as we are so called the only way you could be a Son of God it applies to brothers and sisters only way you can be a Son of God is to be his thoughts in flesh and his thoughts are substance his thoughts are him his thoughts are Jehovah the name is an expression of the thoughts and the character of the one whose thoughts they are and though those thoughts or that name manifested in flesh that makes us the sons of God there's no other way for you to be a Son of God you can't be a Son of God just say well it's just a nice expression in the scripture No we literally are Jehovah manifested in flesh we literally were in his mind before the foundation of the world but we had to wait for our season but this is our season this is our time I'm Not Looking Back to Pentecost or Wesley or Luther or back in the Dark Ages or even back to Paul's age that was their time they were the expression of God's thoughts but now I and you are the expression of God's thoughts in this day Hallelujah those Eternal thoughts which was Jehovah thoughts which was love thoughts now manifested in flesh we are the sons of God even as we are socalled we did not become seed by the rebirth we were seed and therefore we're reborn for only the elect can be reborn because we were seed is the reason we could be quickened in non seed there is nothing to Quicken that's why when you find even as a young person or someone struggling with their faith even as you find you pick up the word and you find the word dealing with you why is that there's something in you to deal with there's something on the inside of the inside that's wanting you as a free moral agent to surrender to that word you have to make a thought you have to make a choice as you receive this thought in your mind and it begins to burn down in your heart that's why they walked on the road to EMAs and said did not our hearts burn within us as he spoke to us along the way why because their attitude towards the word was all mixed mixed up they were in the total wrong thinking of what was happening all around them see the word was being declared and manifested the scripture was being fulfilled they were looking at it with their eyes but because they were looking at it in the wrong mental capacity by a false teaching they couldn't see what was taking place but now the word come by their way and he begin to share with them beginning at Moses and all the prophets the scriptures pertaining to them himself begin to make those events clear by what had already been spoken in the word now their attitude begin to be adjusted and their eyes become open they begin to see oh this is him sitting right in front of us he disappears out of their midst why their attitude by revelation of the word had to be changed Glory that's why we're still here Saints God is still changing our attitude he's washing us of our spiritual Amnesia he's separating us from all unbelief he's washing Us in the water of the word why that he might present himself a bride not having spot or wrinkle or blemish or any such thing Hallelujah that's his people that's his attributes he saw us before the foundation of the world rejoicing in this Revelation shouting for Joy Brother Andy said we ought to shout for Joy they want to declare oh God I'm your attribute oh Lord I'm Yours your word is Quicken me it has made me alive it has brought me to the revelation of who I am praise be to God it brought me the Revelation that God could heal me that God could supernaturally direct my path brother Tony was sharing with me his testimony how God had to supernaturally bring a series of events so he could understand you're sick and you need help and then God comes on the scene but if he's just you know a lot of us men are stubborn not you brother Tony but us men and you Brave sitting on the front there you know we're we're just starting I'll tough it out I'll be all right in a little while we get weaker we get weaker brother BR says in one place and I don't mean to send everybody to the doctor he says in one place if you're sick go to the doctor and find out what it is he didn't say rely on the doctor you know it's amazing to me sometimes people get sick we get so relying on medical attention don't we come on we do it's so easy that's why and there's nothing wrong with medical attention I just went to the doctor myself not too long ago and and and that's perfectly all right the doctors are trained in how these bodies operate but you know brother Bram also said God heals by music but we never make an appointment with a musician all right all you musicians are going to be busy now brother I need a half an hour of music please I want you to you know God heals by love praise the Lord when you go home husband wife you're not feeling well you know you your brothers are not feeling well you go home and say wife I need some loving well that got quiet that praise the Lord God heals by his word God heals by Revelation it's all his power that heals it's only God that heals I am the god that heals all thy sicknesses and diseases and if it takes a doctor to give you something to kill what's in you so be it it takes a doctor to sew it up cut it up cut it out put it in put it out whatever they do you know so be it that's perfectly all right but God's the only one that can heal you he is our healer amen he is our provider what is that that's his expression he couldn't show himself to you that Jehovah Is A Healer unless you got sick but he allowed you to get sick so he can show you I'm your healer he put it in his word I'm your healer forget not all his benefits the Lord Jehovah who forgives all your sins who heals all your sicknesses and diseases amen thank you I think that's the end of that so now there's a there's a attribute response to the word oh my let me go just a little bit further will you you're not too hot are you all right it's actually cooler in the morning than it is in the evening so brother Al's preaching tonight so you're you're not going to do very well brother Al I'm going to take up all the cool air in this place you'll do fine the Lord will be with you amen looking forward to tonight's service too now Jesus was God's only begotten son but he wasn't God's only attribute he was the total sum of all of God's attribute or God's name was in him as Jesus said I come in my father's name I've manifested thy name I've declared thy name but he wasn't the only one I want you to take your Bibles we'll just look at it at one scripture here Mark chapter 10 I don't know today's Sunday right I I have to ask you because it's actually the day before at home it's actually Saturday and uh it's 3 hours later but it's the previous day and so I'm always back and forth between the two places it's Saturday there but it's Sunday here there's a camp going on there as there's a camp going on here so they're having a Saturday service while we're having a Sunday service it's a little confusing for me in Mark chapter 10 we find the the story of the Rich Young Ruler verse 17 and it says and when he had gone forth in the way there came one running and KN to him saying good Master what shall I do that I may inherit eternal life and Jesus said to him why call callest thou me good there is none good but one and that is God thou knowest the Commandments do not commit adultery do not kill do not steal do not bear false witness defraud not honor thy father and mother let's stop there for a moment it really struck me one day as Jesus is dealing with this young man that he never said you know the greatest commandment he never told him the greatest commandment is to love the Lord thy God with all thy heart all thy Soul all thy mind and all thy strength why didn't he why didn't he name that because he's not dealing with a predestinated seed here he's dealing with somebody that's not predestinated to love God but he named things that he could say I've done these things all right and he answered and said master all of these things I've observe from my youth now notice verse 21 Jesus beholding him loved him and said unto him one thing thou lackest go sell thy go thy way sell whatsoever thou Hast give to the poor and thou shalt have treasure in heaven come and take up thy cross and follow me and he was sad at that saying that saying and went away grieved for he had great possessions all right now I have to actually take you to another scripture and that is John chapter 15 I'm sorry I said one scripture but we'll actually take two because we don't understand what love is and Jesus beholding him loved him but actually in the Bible there's two forms of love and there's felo and agapo love or agape love uh and so now here Jesus is looking at this young man but he's actually expressing agapo love but fio love is just a human love that is expressed and I used to think well this man is when Jesus loved it must have been fial love because he's not an attribute of God and so how could God Express a goppel love to somebody that's not his attribute well he does do that sometimes in order to check the response because it's the expression of love that God loves you we love him because he first loved us and so when God expresses his love to us it's our love back to him that shows that we are the attributes of God all right now let me just let me just explain this a little bit for you as we go into it because Divine love is a very very rich subject listen we have come to the Capstone hour the Capstone is what divine love that's right that's been revealed in this hour with cryingsad the result all right that's already been recorded but the full expression of love only comes in in this hour as God says to his bride in Ezekiel 16 he says the time of love amen so when we come to bride time maturity time it is the time of love what they knew of Love down Through the Ages is not the fullness of what God has expressed in this hour all right so let's look at it here in John chapter 15 because there's actually three forms or three aspects of divine love the Divine love we know in the Bible is actually the word God's love is the word agape and there's three forms agape agapo and agapetos all right there's your Greek lesson for the day and Agape is the noun it's love as it exists God is love God is agape but agapo is a verb which means an action so agapo is love when it is projected when Divine love is projected not when Divine love exists all right so let's go back to the thoughts of God God is love so when he was Elohim he was love but God projected the logos When Love is projected then Sovereign Grace comes on the scene and produces the result so When Love Was projected a universe come into existence Angels come come into existence Dimensions come into existence an earth comes into existence a creation comes into existence human beings come into existence the sons of God begin to manifest on the face of the Earth what is that God's love projected as long as he was just love nothing was happening all right you'll see this a little bit more as we read this the last one is agapetos which is the adjective and if we have time we'll get to that so here Jesus uses this expression verse 8 of chapter 15 of John herein is my father glorified that you bear much fruit so shall you be my disciples as the father hath loved agapo me not Agape agapo as the father projected love to me so have I agop you or projected love to you continue ye in my Agape or love that it exists dwell in the love father projected love to me I projected love to you now you dwell in that love all right but he doesn't stop there he says if you keep my Commandments you shall abide in my Agape even as I have kept my father's commandment and abide in his Agape so I abide in love the father abides in love you're to to abide in love each one of us are to have love as a substance that is the Holy Ghost all right so but he says you're not just a haveit these things have I spoken unto you that your joy that my joy might remain in you and that your joy might be full this is my commandment now that you agle one another ah now that takes on a different perspective for us as Believers it's not just to say I have love for my brother and sisters no he's saying you need to project love to your brothers and sisters you need to create an atmosphere you need to be the one that changes the situation by projecting love when God projected love a universe or creative power love is the creative power of God see and you were meant to be amateur creators and God has called you to create an atmosphere I don't have time to go into that that's a whole sermon within itself and I got the notes right here but if we would learn of what it means to create an atmosphere the greatest power that we have is not argument yes it's it's not debate it's not theology it's not knowing the quotes it's creating an atmosphere see that's why the devil as I said earlier I think yesterday that the devil battles us in our mind because we got Divine love here the greatest power that there is but he wants to clog up this because this can only be projected through that and so when you project that by bringing your thoughts in subjection to the word of God then love can create an atmosphere round about you I guess here I am because atmosphere is actually created by the things that you think on not what's in your heart by the things that you think of and so as you bring your thoughts subject to the word of God by the power of God that's in you that loses the chck chel for which Divine love to be projected this is my commandment that you project love one to another as I have projected Love to You Greater Love Agape has no man than this that he laid down his life for his friends amen I got to go to this and I'll close with I'll close on the thought of atmosphere I just got to go to atmosphere I'll leave the other thought that I was headed to because atmosphere is the projection of divine love not any atmosphere but the right atmosphere all right as as brother Bosworth said brother Bram says you could put a hen egg under a puppy and tie it down it would hatch an egg he says the puppy would hatch out a chicken because of the environment he says and when you're a Christian you associate with Christians go with Christians be a Christian you have to have the right kind of an environment around you see as I said already when brother Bram discerned people it didn't change anything of the physical reality they were already healed but he had to change their thoughts he had to change their attitude or he had to change their thinking process brother Tim why are you dealing so much on the mind because I want to get you beyond just the new birth I want to get you in the maturity that God's looking for in a bride a people know what it is to handle the word of God and leave this place this weekend with the maturity about them knowing that they're amateur creators willing to project Divine love wherever they go on the workplace in the supermarket wherever they are knowing that that power lays right within them they are redeemed Son of God with the abstract to the title deed all the promises are yours you can project an atmosphere and watch God come into that atmosphere that's why I brought you a testimony of the wave sheath as he stepped into the pulpit and a wave of the Holy Spirit went out over the congregation and created an atmosphere of divine love that delivered the people from their sickness right there didn't even need to say a word it was the atmosphere that he had gotten himself into and brother Brandon makes an expression he says you're a little Creator yourself you've seen people that you just love to be around you don't know why just that loving type of person he says haven't you seen that you like to be around them they create an atmosphere by the life they live the way they talk their conversation then you seen those every time you shun them all the time they want to talk about something evil amen all you Brothers they got to go in the workplace you know lots of people like that they they want to talk about something evil talk about somebody there's nobody in the message like that but I mean outside of the message so oh my here they come they're going to criticize somebody ain't never been a preacher criticized right and uh he's in here now he's going to talk about this man all they're going to do is tell dirty jokes or something about women or something like that you just hate to get around them they create seemingly pretty nice people but they create an atmosphere the thing that you the things that you think on the things that you do the actions the things you talk about creates an atmosphere talk about the Lord he draws near talk about the devil he draws near the things that you talk about create an atmosphere so atmosphere is created by the Mind once your soul is sealed there's where the battle is you must know how to approach the battle by creating the right atmosphere see the devil hates the atmosphere brother Bram says God's dependent on you to project his love to The Sinner you're an amateur Creator all right now when the lunatic in Portland Oregon many of you know the story how that that lunatic came to the meeting in Portland Oregon and uh TL Osborne describes it and how that there was a giant of a man that had Broke Free from the police and the night before he had he had uh I think broken a preacher's jaw or something like that and now he come into brother Brown's meetings he comes striding right up the aisle great big giant of a man 6'8 300 lb all muscle and he comes on the platform and he begins to say vile things to God's Prophet now here's a man of God in an atmosphere all right now this man is projecting hate why from the devil and the end of the story is brother brandham said he worshiped that devil he loved what it did for him and so here he was projecting that uh to brother brandham but brother brandham now notice what brother brandham does because he taught us you see I'll take a step back and talk about the the Raging Bull that he walked across the field and as he walked across this field and he was going to to pray for somebody and he didn't realize he got into the field of a bull that had already killed a man and so he's as he's walking across the field and then all of a sudden the bull snorts and he looks over and he says oh I'm in the wrong field and he reach what is his his initial reaction is I reach for my gun and he says I left it in my truck so now he's totally helpless totally V vulnerable totally someone that's he's at the mercy of God and he thought he looks at the fence line I can't make it is a is a thoughts kill the bll or run doesn't sound like Divine love to me but Divine love is the Holy Ghost that's what was in brother bram's soul that needed to come on the Forefront and he and he said the bull started to stomp his foot and started to make a move towards him and started to charge him and he said I guess this is my time I'll just face it like a man Lord help me to do that I'd probably turn and run but you know he just turns to face the bowling thought I'm going to go this is it my game's over I'm ready to die anyway and and he the bull comes towards him he says all of a sudden an atmosphere come over him what was it that was already in his soul the atmosphere the the word of divine love but now something begin to project itself and he begin to speak and he says to the bull bull I'm here on the commission of God and I'm a servant of God and I'm sorry I'm in your field but I'm going to pray for one of God's children and an atmosphere comes and the bull as he comes to that atmosphere brother Brown says he screeches to a hul and he looks this way and he looks that way it's like and he turns around totally defeated and goes and lays down under the tree what happened a the greatest power that there ever is was projected from a son of God all right let's go back to Portland here's now a demon-possessed man that willingly gave his life to the devil like the kind of power that he had brother Brown's 5 foot S I think he was or 5 foot 6 he's 140 pounds or less than that and he's and he's he couldn't physically put up any resistance and so he begins to look at the man and the man says you're just a lie are like the rest of them you're just vile you're a snake in the grass and he begins to call them all kinds of Nam what is happening here now catch What's Happening Here the devil is inspiring that man to say things to try and break brother brandom's thoughts because if he can change his thoughts he can get rid of the atmosphere but a prophet of God is trained in the word and he just stays there he says and what is begin to think about the man he says you know what he's just a man like I am he's probably got a wife he's probably got children he's thinking thoughts that are positive towards the man all right it's not the power of positive thinking but he's keeping himself in the right kind of an atmosphere now the devil knows over here in the giant of the man he knows he's not winning the battle and so he inspires him to do something else he's brother bramon he's racks his throat takes up some ugly gum from his throat and spits in his face brother Bram said the man spit in his face now if it's you or me that's game over all right you might be bigger than me but let's get this on right now but not brother Brandon he had a greater power than physical power he was trained in the word of God and the devil couldn't break the atmosphere that was there and the man spit in his face and said I'm going to knock you out into the audience and I'm going to break your jaw and brother Brandon was about to say I wouldn't do that sir he's not just as a Son of God but now as he begins to speak it's no longer him but now Divine love now this is the key of divine love begins to speak through him but it's not sir I love you sir you're so nice you're so wonderful no Divine love is being projected here the greatest power that there is and says because you have defied the servant of the Living God you will fall over my feet this day that man didn't know who he was speaking to he had stepped on the inheritance of a Son of God he was like Goliath that had come over to Israel he was a champion on the devil 's ground but when he stepped on Israel's inheritance David Rose up and says who is he to defy the armies of the Living God he's a defeated enemy because he's on our rightful inheritance and so there was a servant of God standing there God began to speak through him but the man wasn't done he said I'll show you whose feet I'll fall over and he made a fatal mistake he took another step forward into that atmosphere and as he began to raise up his fist brother Brown says that atmosphere begin to take over just like it did on the bull in the field and he begin to take that man and he fought with all of his strength 6'8 total muscle all of that he fought against it with everything that he could inspired by demon power and where did he end up on the ground did Brother Bram lay a finger on him no he never touched him what happened Divine love was projected but because there was nothing in the man to respond to Divine love he fell under the power of a living God oh you say brother Tim was that Divine love projected that's exactly what happened to the Rich Young Ruler I'll close with this thought the Rich Young Ruler comes to Jesus what must I do to have eternal life it's a good question repent be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost all right but in that day Jesus said you know the law you know the Commandments he says I've done these things from my youth Jesus looking on him projected love to him catch it now he's now going to receive something from God he's going to receive the message of his day projected right to him as Jesus said take my yoke upon you for my yoke is easy and my burden is light no man can come unto me except he except he take up his cross and follow me and all of these statements now is going to be projected Divine love through the message of the hour is going to be projected to this man I'll tell you what your problem is here's Jesus in his prophetic office Discerning the problem I'll tell you what your problem is but you're going to have to make a decision all right your problem is you love money your problem is you have too many possession he didn't use those words but I'm I'm telling you what the thought process is your problem is that you're so loving the world and the things of the world you got to get rid of it and you got to take drastic measures in your life and you got to sell it out go sell all that you have and give it to the poor and come and take up your cross and follow me that was the love of God projected see when this message goes to somebody it's the love of God projected to them it's not correction it's it's not it's not chastisement God only chastises those that he loves those who are his children those he receives as his own son but before that it's love projected to them in whatever form that person needs it that's why you the Bible says don't be scared to give an answer when you come before unbelievers when you come before a judge or something because God will bring to your remembrance God will bring out of your soul of divine love to your remembrance the things that need to be projected in that kind of a situation and so it was projected to this man and he said the Bible says he heard the message that's my words he heard the message and the message grieved him he me heard the message and the message saddened him before the foundation of the world God saw in his thoughts when I send my message to my Sons they will shout for joyl Hallelujah when I send my message they won't be sad when I send my message they won't be grieved when I send my love projected in word form it won't cause them to decrease they will only increase they can't reject the word because they are my word for that hour and I send my quickening power to to them that they might manifest my attributes in the day that they're living in I'll be done before 1:00 I'm about to close now you know brother brother that was one of the times brother Ben stepped all over my notes when he began to talk about brother brandom coming home as a Son of God an attribute of God dominion over his children his wife all of that kind of stuff he comes into the house the wife is at the sink washing the dishes crying the children are fighting in the corner the whole house is in disarray and he didn't put one foot on the carpet and one foot on the lolium and raise his hands and swear by him that liveth forever and ever I am a prophet of God I want you all to come subject to my words right now no that wasn't projecting Divine love he took out the greatest power that there was amen Brothers he took out the greatest power there was an [Applause] apron and he got up beside his wife started drying the dishes how you doing dear I'm doing miserable I haven't eat dish think the kids are fighting and everything's going wrong today and I think I'm dying and the world is falling apart and everything it's all right dear it's all right everything's all right don't everything's not all right thought Lord he prayed for her like brother Ben said he prayed he prayed Lord he put his hand on his wife's shoulder it's all right dear but inside he's praying Lord give me the wisdom of how to project love in this situation what is going to turn her around what is going to change her thoughts he gets the secret phrase of Supernatural words from God I saw a dress oh my and you all are laughing like it's but it's serious he got an inspiration from God remember that dress you saw tell her about it right now that's going to break the atmosphere that she's in and grab her attention towards the atmosphere that you're trying to create oh my what projecting Love by talking about a dress and then he talks about something even more Supernatural sisters listen to this now she says but he says we should go down and look at that dress she says we haven't haven't even eaten yet he says well I'll cook supper that was even more Supernatural praise the Lord he's projecting an atmosphere here and she says you can't cook supper you don't know how to cook what he says you've never eaten brandom fried potatoes praise the Lord what is he doing he's creating an atmosphere he's realizing the devil at demon Spirits have been around people have been through the house all these kind of things and he thought first of all I need to bring my wife under subjection he doesn't do it reverse and say well if I spank the children and get them in order then maybe the wife will come around and I'll be able to deal with her and you know he doesn't move into the Physical Realm he moves into his Dominion as a Son of God I have a right to create an atmosphere here and those that are in the atmosphere will be uh affected by it that's the same as what brother Bram said in the token under the token you create an atmosphere that others come into that atmosphere and are affected by the things that you say all right so he's projecting this atmosphere and before you know it he's frying up the potatoes or whatever he's doing and and all of a sudden the children stopped fighting all on their own didn't need to spank them didn't need to send them to the room or anything else what was he doing he was operating as a mature Son of God praise the Lord Brothers brother brandom dealt with a woman one time I'm I'm trying to close you're just pulling so good and he talked to a woman one time she came to him and and saying you know she says to him someone told her that she had seven devils and another person told her she only had five and she wanted to know where the four went that's literally what it says here 7 - 4 is 5 all right this woman was really mixed up all right he says poor poor woman he says Plum gone nearly uh Plum gone nearly set in the room taking off her stockings pulling her feet up in the chair said I haven't eaten for several days and I'm not going to eat till I find out what become of those Devils she says where are they he says I don't know I never know anything about it she said well one Minister told me I had seven another lady Minister said I had five now there's two of them gone somewhere all right now she's starting to get her mind in order and she says and and she said he says she was there two hours in the house until God begin to speak now watch this now what's taking place here it's not delivering her of devils it's the atmosphere coming on the scene it's God doing the supernatural work all right he said he said listen lady you come from St Louis she said yes how'd you know it see now he's got her her attention your husband's on the police force that's right I said you used to be a lovely housekeeper she said that's right noce he said used to be I said recently your house looks like a Hog Pen she said that's right I said your daughter's over there now taking care of your husband she said that's right who told you that I just kept talking because it was a vision I said they went down to a little place uh you went down to a little place first you went to a doctor yes he gave you a shot yes those shots are called hormones yes says you went down to a place and they told you you had Devils yes because you had a real funny feeling yes they sent you to California yeah and some men told you you had Seven Devils yes and you went to a woman she said you had five Devils yes and they told you to come to me yes that's right how'd you know that I said the holy spirit said so I said you haven't got any Devils to begin with she said I haven't I said no said lady surely you know your mother went through menopause it's menopause something natural I said what do you think hormone shots are for see brother brandom says if I want to know what's wrong with you I contact your spirit you can be sealed in your soul but what's wrong with you is identified in the spirit realm that's where the problems the battles are he says she said he says what do you think hormones are for she says I don't know he says for change of life no Devils of all it's just absolutely your condition of life now he said that that much and then he says she began to relax says my wife was cooking bacon and eggs out there and she began to look around the house I said you're kind of hungry and she refused to eat at first he said yes she went out there and ate three eggs a bunch of toast two cups of coffee a lot of jelly just as happy as she could be and she said brother brandom are you going to pray for me and cast it away I said cast what away she said the thing he said I said there's nothing to Cast Away she said 'w I never felt so good in my life what did that it was just an atmosphere change she said what must I do listen now he says go home straighten up your house now he's going to tell her she's received Divine love now I want you to go home and project it catch this now go home straight up your house C your husband a nice big apple pie then he says about that thick it's not on video so I don't know what that thick means could be this thick that thick I don't know but when he comes in tonight throw both arms around him kiss him sit down get up on his lap and tell him you love him and Live Like a Lady ought to now here she comes into the house of a prophet sits down with a prophet and his wife the atmosphere comes the the right atmosphere is is in place and you know we could talk about Elisha and the minstrel and all that but we'll just bypass it and and now she comes and she receives under that atmosphere under that Divine commission now she receives the answer for her life but God doesn't stop there he says now I've given it to you you go give it to somebody else you are God's wife you've been brought in from an atmosphere that was wrong you come under the Divine preaching of the word and God by the revelation of the word has changed your atmosphere I'll tell you this much when I when I got married I was 20 years old for the next two years I I wasn't a very nice husband I wasn't a real positive man because I wasn't in the message I wasn't I didn't know I was in a denomination and my wife and I had fusses and arguments just like any couple but then the word of God came by our way and when this word of this message quickened us from that time to the till the time my wife passed away we had not one single argument that's the space of 28 years what does that the word does that but as you've been brought into that atmosphere now he tells the woman you go give that atmosphere to your husband now he didn't say go home take your Bible read it pray get down fast and do all those kind of things he says no sister go home home cook your husband a nice apple pie must have known that he loved that and he comes in tonight throw both your arms around him spread the atmosphere kiss your husband set him down get up on his lap what is he saying behave like a lady ought to be in love with your husband don't let anything come between the love that you and your husband have and if something has happened there get a change of atmosphere and go back and start it again it's getting awful quiet here either you stop pulling or Stop Believing what I'm telling you one of the two I'll just give one to the brothers is that all right and then we'll close brother Brown says I got to go fast cuz I said to myself I'll be out of here by one that gives me four minutes brother Bram says to a fellow he says not long ago we were going together across the country and he sat down with me and said brother brandham you know my wife don't believe this and said every night when I go to church and come home said oh she starts balling me out when I hit the door he says I get her by the hand my wife's not here to give an example he says I take her by the hand and she's little and I hold her and I try to cast that devil out as hard as I can oh God take this devil from my wife oh Lord cast this devil away from her she do believe what I believe she doesn't believe this message Lord deliver her I pray in the name of Jesus Christ Satan you have no rights here I cast you out in the name of Jesus on and on he went he says I try and cast out the devil devil you come out of my life devil you come out of my wife honey you're possessed with the devil come out of their devil brother Bram says oh I said that's fine but brother fander you go about it the wrong way he says well how do you do it I said when you come home buy her a box of candy I'm going to show you he says how to cast out Devils by candy he says give it to her when you come in at the door put your arms around her that's the way you cast out a devil love casts out fear friends the whole world is dying for love that's one of the great things as the musicians come that we leave out of our Pentecostal blessing too much of it love that mixes it together the mortar that makes gifts and all the things of God operate perfectly is love one for another by this will all men know that your my disciples that you have love or that you project love one to another as a father projected love to me
