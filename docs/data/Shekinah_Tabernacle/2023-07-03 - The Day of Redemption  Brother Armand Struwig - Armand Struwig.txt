========================================

Nations are breaking. Israel's awaken. The signs that the prophet foretold the gentile days number with horrors encumbered eternity soon will unfold. The day of redemption is near. Men's hearts are failing for fear. Be filled with his spirit. Your lamb's trimmed and clear. [Music] Look up. Your redemption is near. [Music] False prophets are lying God's truth. They're denying that Jesus the Christ is my Lord. Through this generation spoon scotch we walk where the apostles have drawn. The day of redemption is near. Men's hearts are failing for fear. But be filled with the spirit and your lambs trimmed and clear. And look up, your redemption is near. Cuz the day of redemption is near. Men's hearts are failing for fear and be filled with his spirit. Your lamps trimmed and clear. I look up, your redemption is near. [Music] and look up. Your redemption is near. [Music]
