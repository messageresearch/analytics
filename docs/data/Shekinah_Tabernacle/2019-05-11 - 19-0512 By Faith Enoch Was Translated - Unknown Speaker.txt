that your anointing will go to where they are Father in Jesus Christ's name cooking them as well for your glory Lord in Jesus Christ's name Amen amen thank you brother ed thank you musicians I mean he is here lujah I mean just one announcement before we go I've got your Bibles you want to grab them but um so we're going to have our first youth service on the well before I get the date wrong or chicken I believe it's the 20:26 of May so we're gonna have lunch and we have our first youth service so I'm going to so all the youth eventually gonna well all the brothers are gonna preach your song lead or you know so we're gonna make sure everyone gets covered eventually so but we'll talk about it more but yo oh I'll come speak to all those I like to speak in song lead first and I believe it's gonna be a wonderful time I mean the youth is the Church of today I trust you've realized you're not the Church of tomorrow you're the Church of right now I mean so um let's go to John chapter 14 so I'm just trying to get this remote going now that's not me technology it was working it was happy to be a believer he's happy to be alive oh yeah I'm glad to be alive thank you for your prayers and although how are you what's EPS and praying for you and I I appreciate it so thank you okay yep I'm driving hold on amen John 14 verses one two three let not your heart be troubled ye believe in God believe also on me and my father's house are many mansions therefore not so I would have told you I'd go to prepare a place for you and if I go and prepare a place for you I will come again and receive you unto myself that where I am NOT where you are but where he is an eternity there ye may be also Olu yeah let's go to Hebrews 11 and we're gonna read verses 1 & 2 and I'm going to drop down to verse 5 this is this here our faith just wait for the paper to see some rustling I've been in the store all week I pray the Lord really grips our hearts we're not here just to go through church and go through life and you know we're here there's a people the Bible says that people that will that are on the earth it will not taste death they will be taken they will walk with God and will be not because God took them and I believe according to the scripture we are we are those people every conditions here everything's here for it to happen I believe that I'm looking at people that are going to fulfill the promise that in a moment of twinkling of an eye I mean this mortality will put on immortality it'll happen before you realize it it means this is now faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of things not seen for by it the elders obtained a good report now let's drop down to verse 5 by faith Enoch was translated that he should not see death and was not found because God had translated him for before his translation he had this testimony that he pleased God I mean may the Lord bless us would you may have your seats today now I want to just you know these well these many moments where you feel very insufficient and this is very much one of those moments but I want to take just from from now faith and I'm gonna go on to this but the rapture has to be a revelation to you as I think brother ed said this walk is individual it's not a group walk a ment we know there is the Bride of Christ as a group but it's all made up of individuals and God deals with individuals God calls individuals amen so the rapture has to be a revelation it has to be revealed to you that you're going in the rapture and you're part of the rapture amen brother Bram said pray for revelation more than anything right so now faith and okay I'm just gonna make a bit of a just what do you call it introduction or whatever so you know where I'm going faith is the substance of things hoped for so it's it's actually a substance of something you're hoping for it's not it's not a stab in the dark well I believe it's happen you actually know it's going to happen you actually have the certainty in your soul you know it's going to happen so it's the substance of something hopeful in that word hope there's an expectation usually with pleasure so faith is the substance of something that you're expecting right it's the evidence of things not seen so it's the evidence is the proof of something you don't see yet you know you have it that's what faith is faith is not I hope that's going to work that's you know I mean we have to have that kind of faith with the rapture I mean with the translation of this body it has to be revealed to you and I pray by the end of the service I mean God just anchors it in your soul I mean I'm going I'm one of them that will not taste this I mean I'm one of those that these atoms are going to be changed you know when brother Brown was caught beyond the curtain of time he was there before he realised he was there he was in his new body before he realized he was in his new body he was there with the Saints before even recognize this is what's happened hallelujah so the rapture the change in the body is going to happen and then we'll realize what's happened glory to God I mean but if that life is in you I mean the Holy Ghost is in you the word is in you quickened I mean you have to go but it has to become because you know you look at the Apostle Paul I'm just going to wander for a bit you look at the Apostle Paul he made the Lord on the roads of Damascus nothing moved them he was gripped by that one encounter with the Lord Jesus Christ and his whole life was now governed by that one time Abraham will talk about Abraham later he met God I don't know you know you read the accounts of when God spoke to Abraham it doesn't take very long to read it through 25 years hallelujah 25 years waiting for Isaac and in that time great distress and things happen but he was signaling us of mind of heart amen nothing moved him right and here we are we have more than just a moment but it only takes a moment if you really meet God your whole life as I'm on this course come what may I'm gonna walk with him amen so now Pam speaks you know what is the Christian life the Christian life is more than just well coming to church you know what are we living for it's not just to come to church and have a nice time and wonderful friends wonderful fellowship now we're getting ready to go into eternity that's why I trust that's why you come to church this way you hear the word faith cometh by hearing and hearing the Word of God so if you want more faith hear the word hallelujah because it's transforming you know there is translation faith in this message there is rapturing faith contained in the word but it's going to be released it's got to put on flesh I believe it myself so now brother Brown speaks a lot about the unseen world okay our mind you're gonna have to help me cuz I can't drive amen yeah give me that thing now he speaks about the unseen world a lot and to many of us it's a mystery amen it's a mystery you know I don't have a picture but you go look at the spectrum of light we only see a very small part of it the visible spectrum of light is very small compared to the whole spectrum and that just shows what our sense is actually contacted this natural world is very limited there's a lot more to this world than what you're seeing there's a lot more to this world than what you can imagine I mean but God sent Malachi for in this day to show us heavens real it's not someone's figment of someone's imagination God put a vessel upon the earth to reveal to you what's in the scriptures not just man's idea that's a reality I mean heavens more real than you this body you're in heavens more real than the body you're in it's more real than the clothes on your back it's more real than the food you eat that's amore yeah it's more real than you can imagine and we are being prepared to leave this world to go into glory hallelujah but it's got to be quickened you know I trust you don't come to church just because you like the people amen I trust you don't just come and follow the message because it agrees with maybe your standards but I trust that you follow this message because you've heard a voice from heaven and has spoken to your soul and something and you said yes Lord I follow you I mean I'm walking with this word I trust that's why you believe why do you got to really ask yourself sometimes why do I believe this isn't because I was raised this way I trust that's not the reason though that's a good start but you can come from anywhere doesn't matter we start it's where you finish I mean so it doesn't matter you could have the best parents in the world you've got to meet God you want to have that one time experience where you know he spoke to me I spoke to him I laid my life down I'm no longer the same my sins have been washed away I know they've been washed away Paulo you've got to meet him if Abraham could meet him Noah could meet him Isaac could meet him Moses met at my light you met him the apostles met him he's still the same God today he hasn't changed I mean Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever that means if they meet him in the New Testament we can meet him today hallelujah we're still living in Bible days he's the same God now he speaks about this and who's this Melchizedek he says he was the word a theophany is something you could not see that's the eternal body it couldn't it could be right here it could be right here now but you could not see it it's just like well like television that's in another dimension television people are moving right through this room now singing this colors also but the eye is only subject to the five senses your whole being is only subject the five senses rather so you know we know that these signals going through this room these signals going through this room these people moving through this room is voices Amen but we aren't built to pick up those voices we are built to pick up that video but it's going through the room Amen but if we were built to pick it up we could we could push a button basically and speak forth whatever the voices are saying Amen but I'm glad that we have a sense of faith we have a receiving tower I mean there's a there's a sending station in glory amen on the believer receiving station in their sole aim it's a word that's transmitted from heaven comes down and you receive it you can speak your forth hallelujah I mean but it's here amen but it's in another dimension that can that can be seen by transformation by television now television does not manufacture a picture a television only channels it into a circuit and in the television screen picks it up but the pictures there to begin with he says television was here when Adam was here television was here when Elijah said on Mount Carmel television was here when Jesus of Nazareth walked on the shores of Galilee but now they're only just discovering it right because the light travels you know you understand you know so it's there but now we've got the device to pick up what the camera is looking at now we're only just discovering it they wouldn't have believed it back there you would have been crazy to have said something like that but now it's become a reality and so it is that Christ is here hallelujah now I wanna I was I was kind of wrestling I find slideshows hard because I don't know where to start and end but just being with me but this is where I want to go heaven is more you know we you know we were you know we sang the song just reach out and touch him you'll never be the same but sometimes we've got to turn around say what what touched me what touched me when I heard that song and something quickened my soul what touched me when I heard that word what touched me when I heard the message what touched me when I read the scripture what what impacted me it's more than just words or more than just ink on paper or more than nice singing it goes beyond that the eternal he uses that as a channel Amen to get a hold of you and you're going to really just think what touched me maybe where my friends went another way and I went this way well what touch me to go this way I remember it being a university I was walking with my friends one day but then God something touched me and something said no I'm going to follow the Lord a Christian now it's not up to me who goes which way but something touched me something impacted me and you gotta ask the question well was it just peer pressure no in my case there was no Pierce to pressure me that pressured me the other way but something touched me saying no I'm going to follow this word I'm gonna follow the Lord Jesus Christ what touched me Jesus touched me and he has a purpose in doing it this just can we blank that oh no we just leave it up but here to prove it we're not here just to haphazardly be here we have a purpose well oldest to the youngest we have a purpose in this place now you've got five senses taste feel smell and hear but what if you didn't have sight you just had taste feel smelling here not see and somebody received this side and see it there's another world the Sun then feelings you bump into things and what and what it is and what it is can tell you what it is why you think the person was crazy because you didn't have that sense of sight nobody had ever seen it you know two of you would have heard of people had said such things as that but you doubted it but you know by the sense that it's real it's a real place see it's a place where you can see your sense declares that now the only thing you do when you die you just change those five senses glory should you just receive another sense and you're alive with the highest since thousands of times higher than this in another life a life where there's no death is no sorrow and the things that you don't know nothing about now you see it plainly when you cross there you don't understand it now because you're bumping into it you've got you haven't got that sense you say well I feel a strange feeling here tonight looks to me like this I just want to cry or shout or something it's the angels of the Lord so you're saying there's something that you just keep bumping into how lujah something's bumping into you you say well what is that what makes me feel this way what's what's causing these people you know I was singing of the convention and and also the youth camp before that and you see God just come down and people who are quietly no longer quiet and people who are reserved they know like yeah they're unreserved and people are screaming and shouting and I didn't believe it was because you know I you know I sit there the first service are sitting in the back right and our young people god bless you dominating the front and second row I said there's my there's my boys and my girls hallelujah tearing the place up and I saw the look on their face when they got to their bare feet that was saying amen because it was personal to them they weren't doing it because of other people they didn't care there is a determination yes this is this is for me this word is mine and they may know they lay claim on it hallelujah they weren't doing it because the others were doing and they're doing it for themselves what bumped into you hallelujah that was heaven that was Jesus Christ bumping into you make you do those things hallelujah we're going to realize it's more than excitement it's more than emotion but eternity is bumping into you it's bumping into you trying to get your attention hallelujah because I just said right now there come a time where it's no longer bumping but it grabs you how long it takes you out of the zone hallelujah cuz they get bump speeds up because we're speeding up it's slowing down eternity and time is merging together hallelujah comes faster bumps you and then a bumps here and there bumps you there eventually it grips you Paulo yeah and then these atoms of change and you're gone hallelujah that's the time we're living in why do you think the services were so intense the gods and teens God wants to awaken our seat says he wants to us to come to a perfect faith I mean to realize were not in this walk alone I mean God is present I mean God is here I mean God wants to change your atoms I mean was it change your spirit I mean I was it Thank You officers you think we're excited you know I've been a Christian for 11 years I meet him September 2007 oh if that's 11 years well maybe my maths good whatever that's just a that's like a picosecond and God's timing God's been waiting seven however many thousand years and I don't know how many I don't know well he was eternally didn't have time but I don't know how long he just him in a store and his attributes and he's thinking of you and thinking how you're going to be and thinking of the age you're going to be I mean when he meets you in the and the and the time you're going to be upon the earth and your parents and your grandparents or your grandpa your holidays been thinking about your color here and how he's going to make you and you know and then finally hallelujah just like any great artist you think an artist would be excited that exactly what was in their mind just like a great painter exactly what's in their mind is now on the canvas hallelujah then they can rejoice because what was their inspiration I mean is now made material Paulo is the same thing with the Bride of Christ the inspiration was that God's mind it's now put on flesh hallelujah I think he's very excited I've been waiting 11 years he's been waiting I don't know how long you think you'll be excited around the throne he's gonna rejoice he's gonna be happy here's my bride here's my love here's my apple of my eye here's the one I delighted here's the one I see no sin and I see her faultless I see her perfect Holly I see her made in my image hallelujah you know God thinks very very very very very very highly of you remember God doesn't if God thought of you a certain way that's how you're gonna be you can't help it so if God thought of you made in the image of his word that's it I just quit and give up saying Lord mold me and shake me amen so that's this thing bumping into you it's the angels of the Lord see they'll go to a next one could you imagine a person that never had the sense of sight never did see and you bump against objects you would have to drive your food from your food from energy or from some other source but would bump into something you had a sense of feeling but not sight and then all that once somebody opened their eyes up and see in a completely different world they'd never seen anything and if then you would say well now what should feel warm on you that is the Sun what's the Sun it's a light what is light see he never lived in that sense he doesn't know what it is that you bump against it's a certain certain thing well what's that see he never lived in that dimension at all it would be very strange to him to know it well now if God lets us love and we are bodily here in five senses but there is another sense and then when we wake up into that sense and that is the sense of vision and we see that that thing but me and what it is and it makes us feel these things that we do and try to tell someone about it just like telling a man that never did see in his life he wouldn't understand it because he'd never acquainted with that sense and that's the way it is in the gospel they didn't understand it it's hard to get them to see it because they never lived in there they know nothing about it they feel it and they can have a reaction to it but to actually know what it is we don't so when you can see beyond that curtain of time and here's a prophet that went beyond the curtain a time when you can see beyond that curtain of time where that comes from and then trying to come back and tell the people that's only felt it with the sense of feeling like they never have to be able to see it it's hard to tell a man but you just have to do the best you can till we all see face to face so here he is he says we are feeling you understand what he's saying he said so when you can see beyond the curtain of time where that comes from this thing that's bumping into you hallelujah the Eternity is bumping into you that's that same that's beyond the curtain of time that paradise no sickness no death no pain no sorrow no devil no bad thoughts holy and none of those frailty of our human bodies just perfection beyond perfection beyond perfection brother Bram says sublime will never touch it I mean that's what's bumping into you hallelujah that is what's bumping into you hallelujah amen I'm glad and he said certainly he lives what's this you're bumping into all the time what's that condemn you when you're wrong that's what what's that that makes you belief hallelujah that eternal land makes you believe hallelujah heaven makes you believe I was rejoicing when I read this amen what's this thing that grips you that land hallelujah we're citizens of another land Amen see that's him you might not be able to open your eyes and see him because he's in spirit form the invisible God but he dwells among a visible people making himself visible by his promised word in that people holy what does the promised word of the our body change I mean the translation of the dead and the living hallelujah a bride coming to her position I mean see you see an invisible God becomes visible because he manifests as promised Word and that people Alleluia do you understand it now it says here before we call the prayer line I trust God will do this I mean so he talks about see us I was trying to I don't know I was saying Lord how can I put this into words because here god that's great eternal one where we come from we come from a where as attributes who come down upon the earth and we're born here in a spiritual amnesia we don't know we're from him but then in God's timing he finds you he calls you eternity bumps into you hallelujah and then you begin to wonder what's bumping into me what's what's what's affecting my life what's gripping my heart hallelujah and then you began to realize that's your father that's you Lord that's you getting my attention that's your gripping me hallelujah hallelujah and what is it now so because often we think Lord if we could just look beyond the curtain of time but they same atmosphere that was there comes down upon the earth hallelujah and that's how we have thee it's the evidence of things unseen hallelujah it's the evidence of a new body how Lewis the evidence of the rapture Amen now faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of things not seen so the word of not hopeful it means to anticipate usually with pleasure it's an expectation abstract or concrete or confidence it's faith or hope so it's a it's something that you're under expectation usually with pleasure this message gives us rapturing faith I mean it gives us faith to change the body hallelujah many times we said well how can we have rapturing faith the word when the word comes open it releases the power okay in the days of Moses in the days of Moses they were slaves God came down on Mount Sinai he opened his word remember the law was always part of him he was always the lawgiver and he is the word right so he came down he revealed that part of himself to Israel those that received that word and faith took their mountain Caleb and Joshua received it in faith they said let's go take our mountain Caleb got his mountain he says I'm as I'm as strong then as I am now I'm 84 years old now buddy says give me my mountain and he went and got his mountain why because the word when the word came open and he received it in faith that released a power to manifest the promise of the word what was the promise of the law that they would dwell in the promised land they would drive out their inhabitants if I wouldn't be under there his vineyard or fig tree whatever you know they would dwell in their land a POW was released I mean sham guy recognized that he was a circumcised son of Abraham and he got his ox God jumped out the window and or whatever killed six hundred Philistines why because the wood came open to him he recognized who he is amen and you can go all the way down through the scripture Jesus comes amen here he was the lawgiver Mount Sinai now it's time for grace your furtherance of the word he reveals himself Amen releases the Holy Ghost upon the people now people have passed and live above sin I mean in the Old Testament there's a blood of bulls and goats but they couldn't live above sin but under the blood of Jesus Christ now we can live above sin why because the word came open it released a power amen to the people could manifest the word hallelujah and now here we are in the day when the seven thunders have been added I mean they no longer thunders their voices that spoken I mean the word has come but it has released a power and what is the purpose that power rapturing faith hallelujah that's the purpose of it let's not just have doctrine and then to discuss and argue no God would release the power upon the earth to take you to heaven that we don't have to taste death hallelujah amen so now it's the evidence evidence is a proof of conviction it's an evidence or a reproof so faith is the substance of something that you're under expectation for and it's the proof of that what you don't see amen that's why we need rapturing faith that's why we need a revelation and I'm going to go on to it faith as a revelation so it has to be revealed to you I'm going Allu you I'm going now we're living at a time faith brother Brahim season and he cares do you care faith is not a hope so or could be right it's got to be absolutely amen it's your ultimate it's your absolute that's the thing that you're tied to you have come to your ultimate that it is the truth and there is nothing and it's nothing but the truth and it must be dust and then when you realize that in your mind then you've got to approach it with your whole life soul body all that's in you just completely sellout everything to it as Jesus so graciously taught us and the man buying pearls and he found the one of great price he sold all the others to get it all the truths and everything that he had though they were good pearls this one mean all to him and when you find God's ultimate his word I promise upon a certain thing you must know first that it is God's Word that the thing that you're seeing being done is God there's no maybe so it could be or it looks like it might be it is God then when you get to that spot then that's the pearl of great price you must get away from anything or that anybody else tells you contrary to it you must not look to what man has achieved you must look to what God has said and what he's promised and see him to do it and that's your ultimate right there hallelujah you know I was I was reading we just go see quite a little bit I'm reading a book by a historian and he so and it's called all things are possible and he looked covers the healing and charismatic revival and he's not a charismatic or Pentecostal but he just did a he stood a historical account of the whole thing and he attributes brother Branham as the initiator and all Roberts they're the two giants for brother brands minister ministry in this shaded the healing revival and he mentions in this book is there's about two hundred at least healing ministries were going around the United States at that time from 48 to 58 so it was a massive big yo the whole country was gripped by healing revival God was pouring out a spirit now and everyone was under expectation the Lord's coming the Lord is coming they were uh next week the Lord is coming but the scripture says in an hour or a day that you do not look for him he'll come right but then that but then I was also thinking so so now the whole whole world you know the Christian world was gripped because it wasn't just America it was South America Europe God was is pouring out his spirit and so now people were under such an expectation the Lord's going to return right now but then I went into the healing lines of brother Branham and I did a bit of a search and not one person that stood before him not one person standing there and the Lord discerns what's wrong or what they need is not one the Lord said you want to see the resurrection you want to see the change in the body you want to see the rapture I couldn't find one I couldn't find one they get the whole world was gripped by this the Lord is coming now I trust that really you to think about it we have all have burdens we all have needs right we'll have questions we'll have things but when it comes down to the core of it if you would stand before the prophet and the Lord was there and he discerned what you really want I trust it would be I what you want to see a body change you want to be taken you want to see the rapture not just for you but for your family I mean I trust I trust that would be on your you know the depths of your soul this is the main thing I want to see I want to see this I wanna before I realize this change I want to I want it to be changed I want to see the dead in Christ rise we're here as a people that are called that we won't see death that the cycle of death life and death will be broken that there will be a people that will not taste it but they'll be gone and I trust that there's something in your soul saying that's me hallelujah I wish I had were I wish I had educational words to put it to you I mean but I trusted something and you saying that's me that's why he called me that's why I'm a believer I mean not because of doctrine or something else not even because of discernment or a supernatural ministry but his word he called me and he's made itself known to me you're gonna walk like Enoch what he knock had a testimony that he pleased God and we'll come into that but he walked individual walk it wasn't him and his family you know in John 6 the whole multitude left there's no individual walk there but he not walked with God and he walked and he walked and he walked and then one day his faith I saw drop it to you right now we read there by faith Enoch was translated now you just take it to another way I said his faith took him in a rapture his revelation took him in a rapture I meant us like by your car you got here your car brought you here I mean his faith took him from this world to the next world hallelujah you understand his faith carried him his faith transformed this body I mean his faith made him walk with God and he was not his faith may God take him hallelujah his faith made him do it how did you get here Enoch my faith my revelation my revelation took me into heaven hello Enoch is a type of you that's why I wish you pray for Revelation it should be Lord old and young listen hearken to my words you should say Lord reveal to me yourself in the scripture reveal to me yourself in the message memorizing scripture is good god bless everyone to memorize the scripture but it's got to go beyond memorizing you got to meet the author in that scripture you've got to meet him say Lord reveal to me yourself in this book amen the scribes and Pharisees learnt the scripture they knew it real good but they win when the word became flesh they missed the whole thing I mean because they're learning blinded them but friends we're not here I'm not speaking if you could quote Genesis to Revelation I'd be very impressed and I'd give you more than a sticker on the wall okay but you need more than that I'm not saying don't memorize memorize learn listen but say but your whole heart should be Lord reveal yourself he's hidden God has hidden in this book you'll know that he's hidden in this book this is a love leader right I would write thanks to my wife in a way that she'll know what I'm saying and you won't know you will not know what I'm saying yeah and you could debate and write theses and whatever and set up schools of thought but you wouldn't know what I'm saying she would know because we're in a love relationship we are united one heart one mind one soul hallelujah and it's the same thing with this Bible I mean God has written it in a certain way I mean that his wife will understand hallelujah Jesus said you know he rejoiced these things are hidden from the eyes of the wise and prudent reveal to babes amen so it should be Lord reveal yourself to me don't hide yourself away I'm not just satisfied with just being saved hallelujah Lord I want the depths of you you know the Bible says yo since what eyes not seen here has not heard the Oh nor is the incident of the heart of man those things that God has prepared but the Spirit searches out the deeper things of God hallelujah so there should be a cry there should be a yearning this world is against that kind of thing but there should be a hunger or thirst Lord reveal yourself to me don't hide yourself away hallelujah we should pray for revelation amen don't ever ever let it become a common thing amen I want all that he is I want all that he is hallelujah that's how we should be romans 4 for the promise that he should be heir of the world was not to abraham or to his seed through the law but through the righteousness of faith for a favor of the law he is faith is made void and the promise of none effect now remember we read that Enoch had this testimony that he pleased God okay so this is where I'm going okay because we'll see this now and the promise made of none effect because the law worketh wrath for where no law is there is no transgression therefore it is of faith that it might be by grace to the end the promise might be sure to all the seed not to that only which is of the law but do that which is of faith of Abraham who is the father of us all as is written I have made thee a father of many nations but before he before him whom he believed even God who quickened the dead and called those things which be not as though they were who against hope believed in hope that he might become the father of many nations according as that it was spoken so shall thy seed be and being not weak in faith he considered not his own body now did when he was upon me about a hundred years old neither yet the deadness of Sarah's womb he staggered not at the promise of God through unbelief but was strong in faith giving glory to God and being fully persuaded that what he had promised he was able also to perform and therefore it was imputed to him for righteousness now it was not written for his sake alone that it was imputed to him but for us also to whom it shall be imputed if we believe on Him that raised up Jesus our Lord from the dead who was delivered for our offenses and was raised up again for our justification so his faith was imputed to him for righteousness because he believed the promise of his day it was imputed to him that he is righteous I mean not that he did anything but because he believed God's Word for his hour it was imputed you are righteous Abraham hallelujah and so now God is saying it wasn't just imputed to him but it's computed to all those that belief hallelujah so now how can we have a testimony that we please God we believe him I mean Jesus was asked by the scribes and Pharisees how can we do the works of God and Jesus said believe on Him whom he has sent leave on the word that has come hallelujah so now your faith imputes righteousness to you hallelujah why is it wasn't quite my faith hallelujah has mp/h righteousness to me I mean so therefore if I believe his word I have a testimony that I please God how do you please God you have no sin I mean you have no nothing held against you that's how you have a testimony that you please God hallelujah so if righteousness is imputed to you I mean your sin doesn't come and do any consideration God said you know David said that blessed is the man that God does not impute sin I mean how can he impute righteousness and send to the same person he cannot do it he cannot impute sin and righteous to the same person it's either one or the hallelujah so therefore a man if you believe the word a man you really believe it not just in here it's anchored down into your soul I mean what's happened you believe that word then God imputes righteousness to you hallelujah amen I think all condemnation self condemnation should just fly away hallelujah just just tell the devil to shut up and quit and go I mean tell him to stop talking say sorry God has revealed his word to me I mean God is quick in his word to my soul I believe it therefore I'm righteous amen we know faith goes into action but I just wonder you think the core of it that's fight sin is not imputed to the bride because she believes her husband hallelujah she believes the word now Abraham knew that Isaac was coming hallelujah Abraham knew Isaac was coming 25 years he knew he was coming however long he kept the promise before him it wasn't a hope so physically it was impossible they couldn't do it how lujah but it was anchored in a soul I'm gonna have a son I'm gonna have a son with Sarah amen and he kept the promise in front of him it didn't get common how you feeling this months here same month number two how you feeling the same glory to God we're gonna have the son I'm the father of many nations hallelujah it was revealed to him see when things reveal to you anything country just flutters away because God has revealed it to you all the wrestling goes away because you know if God has said thus hallelujah hallelujah amen if God has said thus amen then we can just rest in that and so however many years later how you feelin Sarah she may have got a bit annoyed but Abraham wasn't getting annoyed how low he's on his way and many people think that that old man has lost his marbles Nora he found his marbles because God told him it's going to happen hallelujah and it should be the same with us keep the promise keep the promise before you widen Abraham and Sarah go down to Sodom why do they stay up where they were in the harder land because they're expecting a visitation their whole life was governed was actually governed by that amen and it should be the same thing with you and I why do you live the life you're gonna why are you this way God gave me a promise I'm what's that promise you won't find me one day if you want to find me repent and be born again and be baptized name of Lord Jesus Christ and you receive the Holy Ghost then you'll come with right amen people think you're made well this world is made aliyah but the promise did not get old to him it was a reality now we have the story here of simon simeon or simon have you say well there you go he was in the temple he's an old man and behold there was a man in Jerusalem whose name was Simeon Simon and the same man was just and devout waiting for the consolation of Israel and the Holy Ghost was upon him and it was revealed unto him by the Holy Ghost that he should not see death before he had seen the Lord's Christ now in that day everyone was looking for a messiah they're under expectation the Romans they're under Roman control they were and and they're expecting some great leader to come and deliver them from the Romans reestablish the kingdom so it wasn't only this man that was looking the whole the whole country was under some kind of expectation but the difference with this man and the rest of everyone as it was revealed to him it was revealed to him that he would not taste death until he sees the Lord's Messiah the Lord's Christ how do you think he would have been how do you think he's old already can't be very long hallelujah what's happened to you God spoke to me are you sure no no God spoke to me What did he say I'm not gonna die - I see the Lord's Christ oh yes sure we've been waiting 400 odd years or you know that's from Malachi till then and then Isaiah was what 800 years I know you know the timeframe there's some homework go look it up you know they've been looking for this to come for centuries and you you gonna see it him yeah why cuz God told me prove it I can't I can't I have no evidence but I believe it hallelujah Here I am waiting but you're gonna die that means that's very soon yeah hallelujah glory and the thing is he did the thing is he did he saw the Lord's Christ and in what was revealed to him happened he was led right to the baby and the temple hallelujah glory now Daniels sitting in in Babylon and he begins to read the Book of Jeremiah and he realizes that it's just 2 years during my prophesied that Israel would be 70 years in Babylon then they'll come back that's now year 68 two years till their promises fulfilled and here Daniel's reading The Book of Jeremiah now notice him when he read this he began to sit his face unto the Lord God and seek my parents supplications with fasting and sackcloth and ashes he began to seek the Lord when he read this now I don't believe Jeremiah was the only one with the copy of Jeremiah's writings it would have been others others would have read it amen but what happened to Daniel was different I mean he was reading the prophecy and something gripped him saying it soon something gripped us all this is going to happen and it's going to happen while I'm still alive and then he began to seek the Lord earnestly Lord when is it going to happen Lord you have opened your word see when the Lord opens is word to you when he quickens that said Lord wins it's going to be Amen Lord when's this going to happen there's a reason why he reveals himself to you it's not just a tickle some religious such I mean but he wants you to realize that what he's doing in your hour ain't meant so now so so here is biggest a praise seek the Lord hallelujah what did it do is through Daniel into a state of desperation Lord when's this going to happen Lord when is my people going to return hallelujah well you say well what is this got to do with the revelation of the rapture amen because that you know the Bible says Jesus said that no man knows the day or the hour that is true amen but it you throw throw us into such a state we say Lord I want to be ready Lord I want my family to be ready I want my children to be ready hallelujah I want my church to be ready I want my friends to be ready I mean lord give me the revelation of the rapture I want all that you have and should grip us how they should consume us Amen Lord it could be now hallelujah what are we living for sure we have to have jobs and careers and houses and you know children all those things but what is the main thrust of our life the main thrust of our life should be we're getting ready to leave amen this is this is because Jesus died on Calvary not just our sins will be forgiven but he died with with the rapture in mind how lujah I've purchased their Redemption now I'm going to claim what I've purchased there's going to come a season where he claims and carries away hallelujah so I said Lord I want to see them the fullness of redemption manifested in me hallelujah the full extent why'd he die that sin would be defeated that death would come to an end that a people would not taste death amen hallelujah so he's been Lord when's it going to happen I want to be ready I trust a quick Excel something should grip you not just oh that's a nice thought or a nice idea but Lord gripped me bump into me holy you bump into me with this revelation I mean bump into me I said Lord that my whole life would be changed hallelujah Daniel was gripped and he prayed and fasted has to be revealed to us Matthew 16 Jesus asked asked his disciples who you who do men say that I am and they say you're Elias of Jeremiah Jeremiah John or one of the prophets but then he asks a question who do you say that I am and Simon Peter said thou art the Christ the Son of the Living God now he's asked the question what's been revealed to them and then they give the answer while it's being revealed to them that you're one of the prophets but what's been revealed to you what's been revealed to you and it's the same thing with this message who do you say this is amen right even right in 2019 when I was at the when I was at the convention in Auckland I was rejoicing saying Lord you've changed the season you've changed the season we are not just it's not regular time anymore you've changed the season you're doing something different you're bringing a greater quickening coming down how many clarity's bumping bumping into people trying to get them ready trying to awaken them trying to open their eyes of understanding cuz it's going home time hallelujah that's going home time and that's why I was rejoicing there's a few moments I said Lord this could be it would have been good hallelujah but seriously it could be it yes you don't know one will be there'll be people will be universal rapture we may be asleep we'll be taken we both may be awake depends day night wherever you know we're gonna be taken and you'll be taken before you realize it amen he says that what the crisis started living God as he blessed art thou simon barjona for flesh and blood has not revealed this unto thee but my father which is in heaven you didn't get this by just observation you didn't get this just by asking people what they thought I mean you got this because God my father in heaven quicken it to your soul that's why you got this a me you an get this because you come to this church you didn't get this cuz you just around the message I mean you didn't give this just because someone told your testimony I mean you got this because God your Father in Heaven revealed it to you and then your father had him and open your eyes of understanding I mean that you would recognize you're part of the rapture I mean you'd recognize you're part of the living Saints are we translated I mean your Father in Heaven revealed to you it wasn't your observation it wasn't your mental your understanding wasn't something you put together but God revealed it hallelujah my father which isn't here revealed it to me hallelujah amen and I say unto thee thou art Peter upon this rock I'll build my church that rock is the rock of Revelation and the gates of Hell shall not prevail against it I mean a gate as a defensive thing right it shuts an access point hallelujah those gates will not prevail bus bust through them in the name of Jesus Christ hallelujah see my prayer is see my heart's desire if it's daytime or nighttime I want to see my three girls become between eighteen and twenty one before my eyes see them become hallelujah into their glorified form I believe I'm going to see it you may think I'm crazy but I'm I'm under expectation I said Lord anchor into their souls hallelujah that they're not here just to be little girls they're here to take a rapture and then they're here to walk from this world to the next world hallelujah amen that's how it should be you say you've gone off the deep end I like swimming in deep water hallelujah I mean scuba diving is a lot more fun than just being in a paddling pool if you've ever been now behold I show you a mystery we shall not all sleep now this is like okay so Daniel read Daniel read a prophecy and it and it gripped them here's another one behold I show you a mystery we shall not all sleep but we shall all be changed in a moment in the twinkling of an eye at the last Trump for the trumpet shall sound and the dead shall be raised incorruptible and we shall be changed for this corruptible must put on incorruption and this mortal must put on immortality so when this corruptible shall put on incorruption and this mortal shall put on immortality then shall be brought to pass the saying that is written death is swallowed up in victory hallelujah that's that's been sitting there for nearly two thousand years and we see the signs of the times around us we see that the world is just a you know some crazy man's going to push a red button it's all there amen if people you know you know if people even say well the rapture maybe hundred whatever you years ago I mean I mean I mean I mean away it's gonna be a nuclear war I don't believe it's gonna be a hundred years away barbar am said at this age you'll be one of the shortest ages right as nearly the same length as the Ephesian age which i think is the shortest one we're going home we're going home oh yeah I'm glad brother bran was said yo he said you shouldn't tell people about the coming of Lord it's terrifying them this is terrifying no it's the greatest thing there is hallelujah it's the most wonderful thing you think Lord the one who died for me it's gonna carry me away olya we're gonna literally see him Amen from he's going to take a step this way we're gonna take a step towards him and we're gonna be gone I want to see my Jesus don't you I want to see him face to face don't you hallelujah he sees in the rapture message but to the church the bride the rapture is a revelation to her it's revealed to her that the revelation the true Bride of Christ will be waiting for that revelation of the rapture now it is a revelation for the revelation is faith you cannot have a revelation without it being faith I mean faith is a revelation because it's something that's revealed to you faith is a revelation faith is something that has been revealed to you like it was to Abraham that could call anything contrary to what had been revealed to him as though it wasn't so Alleluia now faith that's what faith is is the revelation of God the church is built upon a revelation the whole body of Christ they say but we know that the raptures yes you know the threefold coming of the Lord of the of the shout the voice in the Trump 1st Thessalonians 4 but it hasn't been revealed to you amen has it been revealed to you that the shout is the message right has it been revealed to you that the voice of the Archangel Amen is the manifestation of the word and the bride which will bring forth the dead Saints the life of God in us will bring them out of the grave have been revealed to you amen it's got to be revealed because otherwise it's just information that a prophet preached however many years ago but it has been quickened to your soul then it's very different Alleluia it's a revelation because it's a personal walk it's not a group walk so it's got to be a revelation personally to you amen now well go but more you say well it's a responsible to say that you know the promises now but faith brings the promise into present tense amen it doesn't put it far away it sees us now abraham believed he'd received the son now hallelujah and the next day now the next day now he believed because faith brings the promise into the present unbelief pushes it far away somewhere Amen just like people who you know they say well one day I'll receive the Holy Ghost that's actually unbelief speaking I mean you have to believe that he is and he's a rewarder of them that diligently seek Him I mean that is that is what how you got to be you do you believe that God is and then he's our a water of them that diligently seek Him so if you're diligently seeking Him was that your faith has been put into action I mean but if you say well one day if I'm in I'm in I'm out I'm out that's unbelief speaking Amen so faith brings the promise into the present now he see it's for moses describeth the righteousness which is of the law that the man which doeth those things shall live by them but the righteousness which is of faith speaketh on this wise say not a night heart who shall ascend into heaven that is to bring Christ down from above or who shall descend from the deep that is to bring up Christ again from the dead but what saith it the word is nigh thee even in thy mouth and in thy heart that is the Word of Faith which we preach that if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus and shalt believe in my heart that God raised him from the dead thou shalt be saved forth the heart man believeth unto righteousness and with the confession is made unto salvation so saying that the righteous so faith speaks like this the word is nigh thee even in my mouth in my heart so the promise is here is not it's not see she says unbelief says who's gonna bring Christ either from the grave or from heaven to make it come to pass how's that gonna happen he's distant somewhere but faith doesn't speak that way faces the word is nigh thee even in thy mouth in my heart since the promises present Allu yeah and faith cometh by hearing and hearing the Word of God amen and how can we believe if the book is sealed I mean how can we believe for the rapture if the book is sealed the book is not sealed the word has come open I main faith cometh by hearing and hearing the Word of God so there's a principle if you want unbelief don't listen to the word right if you want faith listen to it if you want faith read it if you want faith amen absorb the Word of God what do you put in your you you'll get out I mean there's what I say and and was the devil fight us he tries to get you to look good look at anything else I mean but the message about the scripture why fight you because he doesn't want you to have overcoming faith he doesn't want you to have rapturing faith I mean he doesn't want you to leave this earth he wants you to be stuck here in a Great Tribulation but we've got a way out hallelujah that's why we're going to feed our souls on the word amen it does you good it'll do your family good I mean because if you're spiritually strong then that life will now flow into your family hallelujah but if you're just kindly minded and physically weak what happens the flesh raises up and then that has dominion and no one likes that I mean that's why you got to feed on the word of God hallelujah because faith cometh by hearing amen now we just finish with this for perfect faith now it's this charge of faith that's going right back to begin and come in see the kind of raised faith in a bracket where you've never noticed it in that way before not a faith but a perfect faith build it up here and watch a perfect God with a perfect heart keep a perfect promise by His perfect word which is sharper than a two-edged sword and a discerner of the thoughts of the heart what we're coming now to the perfection because the people has to come to this in order for the rapture that's what's holding it away right now is waiting for the for that church to come into that perfect raptured faith looking forward it means a whole lot of shaving down for me it means a lot for you but together we'll make it by the grace of God amen by His grace and we know what grace means as a divine influence upon the heart and its reflection in the life hallelujah so here we are you know eternity is bumping into you hallelujah I know it's maybe a crude way of saying it but eternity is bumping into you and you've really got to come and you to think about what is affecting me it should give you perfect faith God doesn't just anoint his bride just for fun He pours the spirit out upon us quickens is word to our souls gives us revelation cuz he's wanting us to see you're going all that the father has given me shall come to me so if I've been given I'm going amen and all that come to me I'll no wise cast out so if I come to him he's not going to cast me out he has to accept me hallelujah if I come on faith he has to accept me he can't reject me hallelujah so we have to I just leave it with that afraid are we looking we say Lord working that rapture to me quicken it to me Lord I don't want to be left behind I don't just want to be part of the group I mean I want to have such a walk with you Lord where I know I'm going amen Enoch walked with God and was not because God took him hallelujah his faith by faith it's just go to their very beginning one oh we're going on two songs I've got a few there can you just go back to my very first slide oh we can just read it in the scripture Oh second one let's go seek him there we go see by faith Enoch was translated his faith took him in a rapture I know I'm repeating myself but if that is your shadow if that's the shadow of you pointing to a reality what's the reality gonna be be by faith the bride was translated she was taken from this world to the next world so it should be Lord fill me with revelation fill me with your word fill me with the knowledge of you not in here revelation anchors down into this but into our hearts Lord reveal yourself hallelujah give me rapturing faith Lord because I wanna I want that because that faith will take you from this world to the next world and I and
