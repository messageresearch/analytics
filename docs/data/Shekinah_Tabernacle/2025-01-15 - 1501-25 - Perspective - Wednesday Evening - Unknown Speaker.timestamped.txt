[27:37] you ready to
[27:38] go you never quite have the courage to
[27:40] say
[27:42] yes you know because really if it was
[27:45] just a man doing something if that was
[27:47] all that was going to be done then that
[27:50] would be a bit of a disappointment so so
[27:52] on that basis we say look yeah I'm kind
[27:55] of ready but you know like I I'm I'm
[27:57] expecting the Lord to do something
[27:59] although on on the flip side the Lord
[28:00] did say to uh Paul said to Timothy study
[28:04] to show yourself approved a Workman that
[28:06] doesn't need to be ashamed are you ready
[28:08] yeah man I've been studying I'm ready

[28:12] coming up here like I haven't put any
[28:14] effort in and just passively try and
[28:15] throw this all together cuz that's not
[28:17] how we do the work of the Lord Hey
[28:19] brother impo are we diligent you know if
[28:21] you get a job you don't you study it you
[28:23] go home at night sometimes and you
[28:24] figure out what you're supposed to do
[28:25] and you think about hey you can do it
[28:26] better and you go there the next day and
[28:27] you do it a we bit better you know
[28:29] that's how you do things if you're a
[28:30] diligent person and I think if you if
[28:33] you work for the Lord you think Lord I
[28:34] want to be the best I can for you amen
[28:37] let's um just while you're standing
[28:38] could you please turn to Ephesians 3 I'm

[28:42] your seats thank you
[28:46] musicians oh we can put that one up
[28:48] there okay Ephesians 3:17-19 says that
[28:52] Christ May dwell in your hearts by faith
[28:54] that ye being rooted and grounded in
[28:55] love might be able to comprehend with
[28:57] all Saints what is the breadth and
[28:59] length and depth and height and to know
[29:01] the love of Christ which passeth
[29:04] knowledge that you might be filled with
[29:05] all the fullness of God God bless you
[29:08] all you can take your
[29:10] seats this
[29:14] evening so on a
[29:18] Wednesday I'm not really a um I just
[29:22] kind of made it sort of a
[29:24] guy on a
[29:26] Wednesday I'm a bit more
[29:31] is that all you got bring it on you know
[29:34] Satan always tries to get at us but I
[29:37] refuse to give him The High
[29:39] Ground you know we I
[29:42] just I I think I think a Christian is a
[29:44] gallant person you believe that like I
[29:48] think we've got courage I think we've
[29:50] got we're Gallant we're we're we're
[29:54] Fearless the Bible says here that that
[29:57] we have not been given the spirit of
[29:59] fear out of a sound mind and I believe
[30:03] Christians are actually Fearless we are
[30:05] we've got
[30:06] Courage the only person that tells us
[30:08] that we're not is the enemy that doesn't
[30:09] want us to have
[30:12] it I'm just going to do say a few things
[30:15] before I get into it because I need to
[30:16] just settle the get into the atmosphere
[30:18] but you know I've often
[30:20] thought who are you Brothers want do you
[30:22] got brothers ever wanted to be a soldier
[30:24] when you were
[30:25] small no oh man come on brother Ed you
[30:28] and me
[30:31] bro I've often thought you know what
[30:33] would I do say say I was in a situation
[30:35] where we were maybe a three or four of
[30:38] us ended up in some situation where
[30:41] there's like four of us and a 100 of
[30:43] them and our demise is imminent you know
[30:48] we maybe fought to try and hold this
[30:50] position all day and all night and and
[30:53] in the morning we're just all worn out
[30:54] and we we got not much ammo left and and
[30:57] May maybe it's our last stand you know
[30:59] this is we we we perceive the situation
[31:04] that look
[31:06] Lads this ain't going to end well for us
[31:09] you know there are sometimes when you're
[31:11] in a situation you just have to kind of
[31:12] call it and go look we ain't going to do
[31:14] this not going to happen you know and I
[31:17] thought what would I do when I end up in
[31:19] that
[31:20] situation what would I
[31:24] do and I I'll tell you one thing I
[31:28] wouldn't do is
[31:29] surrender no we ain't going
[31:32] there you know and I thought if I was in
[31:35] that
[31:36] situation I think I'll go out on my own
[31:39] terms you know I'm not going to I'm not
[31:42] just going to sit there and let you come
[31:43] over my whatever I've got trying to
[31:46] maybe a little bunker or something let
[31:47] you come over there and my Last Stand is
[31:49] you coming over and shooting me and I
[31:50] fall on my back and I'm laying down like
[31:52] that I'm not going out like that you
[31:54] know those little anyone seen those
[31:56] little dogs you know that you go and try
[31:58] and touch the thing and it rolls
[32:01] over isn't that the most pathetic thing
[32:03] you've ever seen and they want you to
[32:06] scratch its stomach you know and it just
[32:08] sits there with his legs up doesn't look
[32:10] like much of a dog my brother used
[32:13] to in in Gisborne we we had a house here
[32:16] and he he lived in it and it was on the
[32:18] main one of these main roads in
[32:20] Gisborne and um he used to rent
[32:24] it but it was right near the street and
[32:26] he used to leave all of his shoes and
[32:27] everything on
[32:28] the by the front door there and um it
[32:32] wasn't long before the whole bunch of
[32:33] shoes all got pinched you know so he
[32:35] goes there the next morning and all his
[32:37] shoes are gone from his front door and
[32:38] he's thinking man I've got to stop this
[32:40] I'm going to get a guard dog that's it
[32:42] we're not having any more of this you
[32:44] know these shoes getting
[32:46] pinched so my brother's quite sort of
[32:49] makes a pretty quick decision and goes
[32:51] on to the local trade like buy sell
[32:54] trade and gets a dog in that same day
[32:57] you know but usually when you do that
[32:58] you don't get you generally don't get
[33:00] the pick of the litter or you know if
[33:01] it's just I've got to do it today you
[33:03] know so so he tells me his plan on going
[33:06] to get this dog man and my trouble's
[33:07] going to be over yeah a squeak and
[33:12] um so I go around and see him that that
[33:15] night and I
[33:17] what oh so I go around and see him that
[33:20] night and he's he's got this little um
[33:22] he's got this dog and I go to touch this
[33:24] thing and this thing rolls over and
[33:26] curls like this and it's tail between
[33:28] its legs just absolutely
[33:31] pathetic and I say man that's some sort
[33:33] of guard dog you got there bro that
[33:35] ain't going to be doing much to protect
[33:36] your
[33:37] shoes but um are we going
[33:42] now that's all
[33:47] right so the um
[33:58] this
[34:02] one
[34:05] right now the topic that I've I the the
[34:07] the subject that I want to speak about
[34:09] tonight is a subject called perspective
[34:11] who knows what perspective is
[34:14] perspective and it's kind of like it's
[34:19] been an interesting little journey to
[34:20] sort of look into this word perspective
[34:22] and to understand you know we we there's
[34:23] there's perspectives on things and I I
[34:26] it's more of like uh I'm just just going
[34:27] to talk to you like a more of a a sort
[34:30] of speaking talking one okay it's maybe
[34:31] not going to be too like it's not really
[34:34] preaching I'm just going to do a little
[34:35] bit of speaking is that all
[34:36] right
[34:39] okay okay so some of this you won't read
[34:42] because it's a bit small but I'm just
[34:43] it's only the first page okay now if we
[34:45] talk about perspective the one of the
[34:47] definitions of it is the art of
[34:49] representing three-dimensional objects
[34:51] on a two dimensional surface like you
[34:53] can draw something and it looks like
[34:55] it's got 3D depth that's what you know
[34:57] you call that that's that's one thing
[34:58] called perspective um another thing is a
[35:01] particular attitude towards or a way of
[35:03] regarding something or a point of view
[35:05] for example most guide book history is
[35:07] written from the editor perspective well
[35:11] there's another there's another thing
[35:12] that says you know history is written by
[35:14] the from the conqueror's
[35:16] perspective you know like a a bunch of
[35:19] people will turn up into a land and
[35:21] they'll say well we discovered this land
[35:23] you know we're we're we're the great
[35:25] discoverers from their perspective but
[35:28] there were already people there so from
[35:31] the people there their perspective was
[35:33] ah Hang on we're already here we might
[35:35] call you Invaders instead you know it's
[35:39] perspectives and and so whichever
[35:42] perspective we read from is the one that
[35:43] we we take in uh number three would be a
[35:47] way of regarding situations and facts
[35:50] and then judging their relative
[35:51] importance like you when you have
[35:53] perspective you would look into
[35:54] situations and you would try and get
[35:56] different perspectives to see how that
[35:58] might all play out like like at the at
[36:02] the cafe we do the for the staff we do
[36:04] like a staff discount meaning they get
[36:07] like half price for their pizzas that
[36:09] they buy and then we we sort of extended
[36:11] that uh Liberty to the Brethren here you
[36:13] know you if you go there you'll get
[36:14] staff what we call staff discount and
[36:18] some people sometimes say to me oh is
[36:19] that like is it sort of pretty hard on
[36:21] the business doing the staff discount
[36:22] you know to the to the
[36:24] Brethren should I should we stop it
[36:30] but then so so that's a that's a
[36:32] question that needs a a judgment on it
[36:34] it needs a perspective you say well okay
[36:36] so let's say we do
[36:38] 1,000 pizzas a week how many are we
[36:40] doing to the on the staff discount maybe
[36:43] maybe on an average week because it goes
[36:44] up and down maybe 20 so we got that's
[36:47] that's like Z like
[36:49] .2% so in that respect that's not much
[36:51] and then and how much are you losing on
[36:52] it we say uh not really anything cuz
[36:54] we're just covering costs on it okay
[36:57] well that's not really a major if 0.02%
[37:00] of just breaking even is going to ruin
[37:02] your business then you got I don't think
[37:03] that is your problem you got a serious
[37:05] problem and then the flip side would be
[37:07] okay then what do you gain from it you
[37:09] gain maybe the Brethren one day they
[37:11] were going to drive pass but they think
[37:12] you know what we'll stop in you know so
[37:15] so when you when you when you stand back
[37:16] and get the P get a perspective on the
[37:18] whole thing you you come out with this
[37:19] judgment rather than if you just said ah
[37:21] no we can't be giving away things for
[37:23] not much stop that you know it's
[37:25] perspective that's how that's how these
[37:27] things work
[37:28] um another one is the proper and
[37:30] accurate point of view or the ability to
[37:33] see it object something objectively like
[37:38] for example try and get some perspective
[37:40] on your
[37:41] troubles you know like you might end up
[37:43] in a situation and you can't see the
[37:44] forest for the trees and someone comes
[37:46] and says to you look it's all right just
[37:48] relax you'll you know and they and they
[37:50] point out to you a perspective of the
[37:51] whole thing
[37:54] um number five is a way of looking at or
[37:56] thinking about something whether she was
[37:59] being rude or candid is all a matter of
[38:02] perspective the way someone acted
[38:04] towards you you'd you'd perceive it a
[38:06] different way based on your perspective
[38:08] of them like like if you were if you
[38:10] were in the Army and you were being
[38:13] trained to maybe shoot a gun and you
[38:16] were absolutely hopeless at it and
[38:17] someone that the person that's trying to
[38:18] train you at it was mad at you because
[38:21] you're hopeless and his objective is to
[38:23] make you good and he yells at you and he
[38:25] says look man you're you reload you know
[38:28] slide in
[38:29] a a sloth in a coma you know and and you
[38:33] you you your aim is worse than a blind
[38:36] man you know and he's telling you all
[38:37] the stuff and you and he says look I
[38:40] mean you're so pathetic if you don't
[38:42] improve maybe I just shoot you myself to
[38:43] save the enemy doing it you know
[38:47] now and maybe Johnny would think oh man
[38:50] I better like this pretty harsh I be
[38:53] maybe I maybe he's serious I be to clean
[38:54] up my act and start learning this thing
[38:56] before you know maybe I'll learn and
[38:57] take my chances With the Enemy rather
[38:59] than this guy just shooting me here you
[39:00] know so his but the but the perspective
[39:04] that you look at it you say well let's
[39:06] say this man got into battle and he he
[39:08] learned to do well from that experience
[39:11] and then he he was in a situation where
[39:12] he's like man I'm glad I could reload
[39:14] this gun fast I'm glad I can shoot well
[39:16] because that saved me in the situation
[39:18] so from that perspective you'd say well
[39:19] then him dealing with that the Man how
[39:21] he dealt with them was good even though
[39:23] it would appear like even though you
[39:24] could you could you could perceive it
[39:26] different ways like but you could look
[39:27] at it the other way and think well that
[39:28] was so rude how he talked to that poor
[39:31] Soldier you know he should have said oh
[39:33] look Little Johnny you know everyone's a
[39:35] winner you know the lord loves a tri you
[39:37] know look you getting award for showing
[39:39] up you you fired the gun that direction
[39:41] you're good you know you eventually got
[39:43] it reloaded we're good you know cuz we
[39:45] try not to hurt their
[39:46] feelings and then you get him out to the
[39:51] battle and little Johnny is just Cannon
[39:53] fod he gone you know so so from that
[39:56] perspective you say well how
[39:59] like which was the better perspective so
[40:02] it's all it's all based on how how you
[40:03] perceived the situation
[40:07] okay um it's a Viewpoint or an Outlook
[40:11] or an opinion or a standpoint or if we
[40:13] say if we say something has perspective
[40:14] that means we have a like you have a
[40:16] decent perspective on life because you
[40:17] see it from a different a lot of
[40:18] different standpoints okay so so what we
[40:21] want is perspective because otherwise we
[40:24] just look at things from a small
[40:26] standpoint I wanted talk about um just
[40:29] bring it through this here because I
[40:31] want to open up perspective but we have
[40:33] to kind of go through this first who
[40:35] likes gardening do anyone anyone do
[40:37] gardening or done a little bit of
[40:39] gardening I would recommend if you
[40:41] haven't done it like even if you're not
[40:42] into it if you go and spend maybe just
[40:44] grow a garden one time over a summer
[40:46] period or something you'll learn a lot
[40:47] in the garden every time I've done
[40:49] gardening and I've done a lot over the
[40:50] years I always think man this is such an
[40:53] amazing place to be and such an amazing
[40:55] thing to do because if you're aware of
[40:57] it you've got wisdom just flying at you
[40:59] from all sorts of directions because see
[41:02] God made everything that exists
[41:04] here and he's put nuggets of wisdom
[41:06] amongst everything that he's made like
[41:08] there's nothing that he made that he
[41:09] hasn't put something in it to speak to
[41:11] us he didn't just make something and
[41:14] thought I had I've got a few spare
[41:15] materials left over I'll just quickly
[41:16] whoop this together and Chuck it out
[41:17] there it was all for a purpose all of
[41:19] the everything he's made is is can can
[41:22] teach us things so you go out in the
[41:23] garden and you soon realize that the
[41:26] garden like it sort of deal
[41:28] in when you perceive what it is it deals
[41:30] in what the human mind is and the human
[41:32] heart and and things going into it and
[41:35] growing and coming forth it it's you you
[41:37] start to see that all around you when
[41:39] you work in a garden that's if you if
[41:41] you open your eyes to it that's what you
[41:42] see and and and I believe that's what
[41:44] the Lord wanted us to see because even
[41:46] he said himself uh the the word of God
[41:48] is like a seed and we sew it you know
[41:50] and your heart is the ground and he he's
[41:51] saying I designed that to show you that
[41:54] to explain to you these these things so
[41:57] then you when when you look at it you
[41:59] have you get these seeds and you think
[42:00] okay I'll put these seeds in the ground
[42:02] and you start to think you know this
[42:03] seed is a very small thing and it may
[42:06] not look like it's very significant but
[42:07] if I put that in the ground whatever's
[42:09] in there is going to come forth and it's
[42:11] going to get bigger and bigger and do
[42:12] whatever it's going to do and and and
[42:14] you start to realize well the the
[42:15] principles of a seed like of sewing
[42:17] because you're sewing a seed uh you
[42:19] start to think well okay it is you reap
[42:21] what you sew so whatever's in that seed
[42:22] is what you reap uh you reap where you
[42:24] SE if you put it there you reap it there
[42:27] um you reap after you se you don't just
[42:29] put it in the ground next day it's there
[42:31] and you reap more than what you
[42:32] seow so when you understand that that
[42:35] that applies to other things in life
[42:36] like that's why the scripture says be
[42:38] not weary and
[42:39] wello for in due season you shall reap
[42:42] if you faint not like just because you
[42:44] you think well I'm putting this in the
[42:45] ground and nothing seems to be happening
[42:46] he's saying don't be weary because it's
[42:47] a seed your actions are seeds and they
[42:50] will they will bring forth fruit after a
[42:51] while don't be weary just keep going but
[42:54] but by the same token negative things
[42:56] are also seeds you start to se negative
[42:58] things in your life they will come forth
[42:59] and and it will always be more than what
[43:01] you seow like if you start hating it'll
[43:03] just if you let a seed of hate come in
[43:04] you it won't just be that that will
[43:07] start to grow more and more because it
[43:09] it it has to because it has to multiply
[43:11] whatever you put in whatever seed you
[43:12] put in your heart has to multiply and
[43:14] all of our life our whole being is just
[43:16] a whole bunch of is just all these seeds
[43:18] that have been planted there hopefully
[43:19] as we get on we we get the bad ones out
[43:22] and we keep the good ones that's that's
[43:24] the objective of being alive and living
[43:25] and serving the lord we say Lord weed my
[43:27] garden you know if these wrong seeds
[43:29] take them out and some of them are big
[43:30] some of them take a lot of work to get
[43:31] out there some of them are you know you
[43:33] might have gone through a life of a
[43:34] certain thing and there's some big bad
[43:35] weeds in there that that are just the
[43:37] roots go down deep some of them takes a
[43:39] lot of work to get out like if you're
[43:40] try and get a some sort of big bad shrub
[43:43] out of a garden that shouldn't be there
[43:44] and this thing's got to be really thick
[43:46] and The Roots have gone down it's a lot
[43:47] of work to get it out you really have to
[43:48] hack away at it and get right
[43:50] down sometimes we have to have that done
[43:52] in our life because that's that's there
[43:55] are just things like that there but you
[43:57] learn about seeds you you realize okay
[43:59] once I get this thing cleaned up the the
[44:00] easiest time to get rid of a little weed
[44:02] is when it's tiny you just go pick it
[44:04] out and and and when you pull weeds out
[44:06] when you do that in the garden you're
[44:07] like there's a weed and you go and you
[44:09] think to yourself that was so easy and
[44:12] then you turn around you got this big
[44:13] one over there you think this is so hard
[44:14] and you start to think okay when I see
[44:16] something I'm going to pluck it out
[44:17] straight away I'm going to deal with it
[44:18] when it's small and and that starts to
[44:20] go in different areas of your life when
[44:22] you're raising children you want to try
[44:23] and nail things early cuz you think if I
[44:24] let that thing grow it's just going to
[44:26] I'm going to have to deal with something
[44:26] else later on okay and then you start to
[44:30] look at the ground and you realize what
[44:32] this goes in is important like the seeds
[44:33] can't just I can't just throw it over
[44:35] there and hope for the best you know
[44:36] where it goes is important and often in
[44:38] our own lives even like if the Lord's
[44:41] starting a work in us we won't know he's
[44:43] actually working like we'll know nothing
[44:45] about the seed of the word of God but he
[44:46] may be working for years just preparing
[44:48] the ground of our heart because he knows
[44:50] I can't just throw a seed in your life
[44:52] and the ground is just all this dry
[44:53] Barren ground I've got to work in your
[44:55] heart okay so he's so then I know
[44:58] Shannon's experience was that she
[44:59] traveled from America and went around
[45:01] New Zealand for like a month or two or
[45:03] three and and it seems like oh she's
[45:06] just traveling around doing an OE but it
[45:07] wasn't it was the
[45:09] Lord breaking up the ground in her heart
[45:12] because that at a later point the seed
[45:14] of the word of God was going to come in
[45:15] and be planted there but but if if if it
[45:18] was just planted when her heart was rock
[45:20] hard then it wouldn't have had any
[45:22] effect now when she was going through
[45:24] that process she didn't know that that's
[45:25] what was happening she didn't didn't
[45:28] think about God or nothing and
[45:29] understand that but she just thought
[45:31] things are changing something's
[45:32] happening and then it got to a point
[45:33] where when that word of God came it
[45:35] could just find
[45:36] root so God he he he plans out the
[45:39] ground in our heart and if it's if it's
[45:43] hard then he then some people just have
[45:45] a hard heart that's what they call that
[45:46] man's that man or that woman have a hard
[45:48] heart and nothing seems to grow in there
[45:50] they just the Barron it looks like this
[45:53] and we've talked about weeds but you you
[45:55] get this concept of weeds like you let
[45:57] wrong things come in and they grow you
[45:59] know they're just all seeds and they
[46:00] they can they can cause Havoc but weeds
[46:03] can also cause like if you're trying to
[46:06] do things for the Lord and you've got
[46:07] all sorts of other things in your life
[46:09] that are just taking up your time and
[46:10] like you're like more than what they
[46:12] should be like the Bible says you know
[46:14] the seed went in but then the cares of
[46:15] this life the deceitfulness the riches
[46:17] all these other things are growing
[46:18] around that plant that's trying to come
[46:20] through and these weeds are choking it
[46:21] and it and this the word of God can't
[46:23] grow because it's when we check our
[46:25] lives we think okay put effort here but
[46:27] then I've also got all this other stuff
[46:28] that seems to Cloud everything and I I
[46:30] can't actually I'm not bearing any fruit
[46:32] for the Lord because I'm there's there's
[46:33] all these other things you know um water
[46:37] you know when when you used to go away
[46:39] maybe 3 or 4 days when we lived in
[46:41] gisborn and we'd come back and I didn't
[46:43] have anyone water the garden and I get
[46:45] back after 3 or 4 days and I'm like man
[46:47] this thing's almost dead because it was
[46:48] a middle of summer hot and it's just
[46:50] parched and the the little the leaves
[46:52] are all hunched down like this it's
[46:54] pretty amazing to see though you'd water
[46:55] these things especially in the call of
[46:56] the even and you you'd water these these
[46:58] plants that were all hunched down and
[47:00] like that and it it wouldn't take very
[47:02] long and these little leaves would per
[47:04] perk back up again you know and they
[47:06] would you think this thing's alive this
[47:09] thing's
[47:10] responding you know and often times in
[47:12] our life you might find you know if you
[47:14] if you don't get enough of the spirit of
[47:16] God in your life that that water to just
[47:18] perk you up you can actually get quite
[47:20] droopy and down and you know you notice
[47:22] your your attitude towards things is not
[47:24] what it used to be you're you're more
[47:26] Snappy you're
[47:27] more argumentative you know you you're
[47:29] more you don't have as much Faith as
[47:31] what you would usually have you you get
[47:33] despondent you all these things because
[47:34] you're you're drooping you don't have
[47:35] enough of the water of the word of God
[47:37] in you but you know you come and sit in
[47:38] church for a while or something and you
[47:40] just sing the songs and hear the word
[47:41] and you know even over a short amount of
[47:43] time it can just by the end of it you're
[47:45] just you perked up again you know cuz
[47:47] this this this has
[47:49] come and actually the other thing you
[47:51] need is Sun you know you think well the
[47:52] sun just bakes things and they all die
[47:53] it's actually the opposite you know you
[47:55] put a plant under the under another
[47:57] plant and you think this one plant is
[47:59] taken off and this plant that didn't get
[48:00] the sun's just struggling away you know
[48:03] that's why it's often good you know
[48:04] the sometimes you get too many if you
[48:06] get too many tall trees around you it
[48:08] can actually stunt the growth of some
[48:10] people that are underneath some people
[48:11] sometimes need to get away from tall
[48:13] trees you know just get a chance to be
[48:14] out in the open and let the sun hit
[48:16] them it does it happens in families you
[48:18] know that some of the younger people are
[48:20] just surrounded by tall trees and they
[48:22] can't actually get out so you notice
[48:24] some of them I'm not advocating for this
[48:26] but some of them leave home and it
[48:27] doesn't take long 2 or 3 years and they
[48:28] just they're completely different cuz
[48:30] they you know under a different
[48:32] environment under a different experience
[48:33] they got to the sun sha on them and they
[48:35] could they could grow here's another one
[48:38] like when you look at big Open Spaces
[48:41] when you when you when you look at this
[48:43] you you have to look at everything and
[48:44] think and think okay I think God made
[48:46] these to relate to
[48:47] experiences like we like of how we would
[48:50] go through life like you you would have
[48:52] often had times in your life where you
[48:54] said I'm on a mountain top who ever said
[48:56] that
[48:57] you're not on a mountain top because
[48:59] you're maybe standing here but
[49:00] metaphorically you say it's like I'm up
[49:02] the top of something I'm everything's
[49:03] going well I'm happy it's just it's
[49:05] worked out so good I'm feeling so good
[49:06] I've achieved this and that I'm going we
[49:08] just got married bought a house we're
[49:09] going to church and I'm doing this in
[49:10] the church and it's like things are
[49:11] quite good for you so you say look I'm
[49:13] on a mountain top and you'd perceive
[49:14] that and it's nice to look around like
[49:16] every time you be see a big view it's
[49:18] enjoyable to look out at the view I
[49:19] don't think I me anyone that sees an
[49:21] awesome View and says that's a pathetic
[49:23] view you know they're always nice views
[49:26] but then the flip side as you could
[49:27] perceive in your life you think man I
[49:29] just I was on the mountain top and then
[49:30] this happened that happened I've just
[49:31] been winding down to this now it seems
[49:33] like I'm just It's just tough I I look
[49:35] this way I just see Side of the Mountain
[49:37] I look that way I see side I clouds over
[49:39] me hanging down in the valley your life
[49:41] seems like it's you're in a valley and
[49:44] you are in a valley like you do walk in
[49:46] valleys you know we whatever you see in
[49:49] nature you will walk those particular
[49:51] paths and and like like in your
[49:53] direction in life sometimes you look
[49:55] forward and you think oh I can sort of
[49:57] see a long way off I I can perceive that
[50:00] what I'm what I'm what's happening in my
[50:01] life I've I've got a lot of vision of
[50:02] where it's all going and I'm there's
[50:04] nothing really out there that's going to
[50:05] surprise me you've had those times in
[50:07] your life where it's like oh yeah this
[50:09] it's open spaces you you get other times
[50:11] in your life like where you end up you
[50:12] seems like you end up on this little
[50:13] narrow windy path where you where every
[50:16] week to the next is changing you think
[50:18] man what's around the corner next week
[50:20] what's happening now you know you sort
[50:22] of you almost you almost get scared to
[50:24] face another week you think okay there's
[50:26] another Cor what's going to be there and
[50:27] there's some sort of Hiccup and you got
[50:29] to you know try and trudge through that
[50:32] you think well I got out of that now you
[50:33] got to turn another corner there you
[50:34] think what's going to be there something
[50:36] else there it's just a it's a you get
[50:38] those paths you you now and then you
[50:39] walk on those paths all right um I want
[50:42] to I talked to brother Ben about this
[50:43] the other day you know this is so funny
[50:45] when you you've heard of songs that are
[50:46] like so many oldfashioned songs all talk
[50:49] about the ocean about sailing you know
[50:51] and I was like I wonder why that is it's
[50:52] because like in the 1800s when when
[50:55] global trade and everything started to
[50:57] happen a lot people started men and
[50:59] women started sailing a lot more you
[51:01] know so they would they would they would
[51:03] end up always on ships and as as men and
[51:05] women would go on ships they would start
[51:06] to perceive oh I'm on this ship where
[51:09] there's water around and when it when
[51:10] when the storm comes I get blind this
[51:12] way and that way but when it's calm it's
[51:13] nice and you know we've got this thing
[51:15] called an anchor that we can send down
[51:16] and it holds Us in place when there's a
[51:17] storm and they they begin to see all
[51:19] these examples so so men and women begin
[51:21] to write songs about it because they
[51:22] could see this is a bit like our walk
[51:24] with the Lord you know this sailing on
[51:25] water I just want to read you some of
[51:30] these
[51:38] um sorry that's
[51:40] not can you read
[51:43] it here we go look well to your cables
[51:45] my brother for severed the faith strand
[51:48] may be take heed lest you slip from your
[51:50] moing and storm toss lie Out On Life's
[51:53] sea drifting away drifting away far from
[51:55] the home of the bless then anchor
[51:57] yourself on the Christ Rock for under
[51:58] his shadow is rest so he this man would
[52:01] look at a ship tied up to a maybe in a
[52:03] harbor somewhere and he'd see the winds
[52:05] and the storm blow and he'd think okay
[52:08] that whatever's holding that ship to
[52:09] that moing better be good because if
[52:11] that gives way the ship's going to get
[52:13] blown and end up on the Rock somewhere
[52:14] and it's all going to be in trouble so
[52:15] that's why he says look well to your
[52:17] cables then he would say okay what's the
[52:19] cable that holds Us in the storm what
[52:20] the cable of Faith okay then I want to
[52:22] look well to that make sure that's going
[52:23] to hold when there's a storm come it
[52:24] holds so he would perceive these
[52:26] situations here's another one it says my
[52:29] soul and sad Exile was out on life's sea
[52:31] so burden was s in distress till I heard
[52:33] a sweet voice saying make me your choice
[52:35] and I entered that Haven of Rest and he
[52:37] says I've anchored my soul in the Haven
[52:38] of Rest I'll sail the wide Seas no more
[52:41] The Tempest May sweep over the wild
[52:43] stormy deep in Jesus I'm safe Evermore
[52:46] so he would experience he would he'd be
[52:47] going somewhere and then it was a whole
[52:49] lot of storm and rain and there and then
[52:50] at a certain point they maybe came into
[52:52] a little Harbor somewhere it was Shelter
[52:53] From The Storm and they would put their
[52:55] anchor down and he would say well this
[52:56] is is such a nice place compared to what
[52:57] was out there see liking it to think
[52:59] maybe the Lord is like this that could
[53:01] be storm out there but when you come out
[53:02] to this Haven of Rest You anchor here
[53:04] then this is what it's like serving the
[53:05] lord so they would he would perceive
[53:07] these things I've just got one more my
[53:09] ship is coming in at last my ship that
[53:11] sailed AAR with spreading sail and
[53:13] favoring Gale she's sailing over the bar
[53:17] she's coming in coming in over the
[53:18] Harbor Bar she's coming in she's coming
[53:20] in my ship that sailed
[53:22] AAR with icebound Hull and storm rent
[53:25] sail all batter by the sea with wind
[53:26] swep Deck almost a she's coming back to
[53:28] me now I think he's he's describing this
[53:31] as though maybe he was out in the world
[53:32] and he was all getting battered around
[53:33] but he's coming back and and the Lord
[53:35] brought him back and when he came back
[53:36] in you can imagine this he's coming back
[53:38] in over the bar and there's this ship
[53:39] that's been on this Epic Journey
[53:40] somewhere and it's all the sailes are
[53:42] tatted and everything and it's coming
[53:43] over the bar and it's going to come into
[53:45] this place of rest and he maybe looked
[53:46] at his own life and thought that was me
[53:47] I was sailing around it was beaten I
[53:50] came in Ted but Lord I'm back here
[53:53] now now what I want to to I wanted to
[53:58] get you in the mindset because this
[54:00] concept of perspective you have to put
[54:02] on like a you have to think of it like
[54:04] these things like it's a type okay and
[54:07] and you have to understand that the word
[54:08] of God that we that we know has has
[54:11] perspective okay you'll understand what
[54:13] I mean shortly I'll just read this
[54:15] here Jesus said in that hour uh he said
[54:18] in the hour Jesus rejoiced in spirit and
[54:19] said I thank thee Oh Lord of Heaven and
[54:22] Earth that thou Hast hid these things
[54:24] from the wise and prudent and has
[54:26] revealed them unto babes even so father
[54:28] for it seem good in thy
[54:31] sight so what the Lord is speaking of
[54:34] here is he's talking about revealing
[54:35] something like like showing something so
[54:39] when you talk about perspective it's to
[54:40] do with he's he's showing you something
[54:43] okay so that means it's something that
[54:45] you see it's not something that you feel
[54:47] it's not something that you you you
[54:49] touch as such it's something that you
[54:50] that you see right so if you like and
[54:53] that and and it's something that you see
[54:55] with your eyes so I've got this person
[54:57] here with their eyes
[54:59] closed so can you all close your eyes
[55:01] for a second okay so you you probably
[55:03] don't see anything right you know like
[55:06] okay that's pretty obvious but now when
[55:07] you open them up you see something like
[55:10] you
[55:11] see the the word of God and seeing it
[55:15] has to be just like what you experienced
[55:16] I couldn't see much then open my eyes
[55:17] and I could see it and then and but
[55:20] because God has made nature it has to be
[55:22] it has to be as we see it here I'll
[55:24] explain to you what I mean you you'll
[55:25] see what I mean that Christ may this one
[55:28] here says that Christ May dwell in your
[55:29] hearts by faith and that ye being rooted
[55:31] and grounded in love may be able to
[55:33] comprehend with All Saints what is the
[55:35] breadth and length and depth and height
[55:37] and to know the love of Christ which
[55:39] passes passeth knowledge that you might
[55:41] be filled with the fullness of God so
[55:43] the Lord the so Paul is saying that the
[55:45] love of God love of Christ has it goes
[55:48] this way it goes that way it goes that
[55:51] way like it's it's not just a nothing
[55:54] it's a something it exists as a
[55:57] substance and and if you cannot if if
[56:00] you you and he's saying I want you to
[56:02] see what exactly it is I want you to see
[56:04] the
[56:06] substance I want you to understand and
[56:08] and the word of God is as we see things
[56:10] here like it's substance it's not just a
[56:13] flat thing that doesn't exist if you if
[56:15] whatever you see around you the word of
[56:17] God has to be the same way if he says I
[56:18] will reveal it to you then his type has
[56:20] to be
[56:21] that you'll see what I mean in a second
[56:27] here's one here and he began to speak
[56:29] boldly in the synagogue whom when
[56:31] Priscilla and Aquilla heard it they took
[56:33] him unto them and expanded un to him the
[56:36] way of God more perfectly meaning they
[56:38] gave him a better perspective and they
[56:40] they painted a better picture um what
[56:43] I'm trying to get to is that the the
[56:44] word of God is actually shape this
[56:47] sounds like a random thought but it's
[56:48] not it's got substance it's got sides to
[56:50] it it's got perspective it doesn't just
[56:52] it's not just like that like a flat
[56:54] thing because we don't exist in a flat
[56:55] thing do you exist flat you exist in
[56:59] shape so the word of God Concepts in the
[57:01] word of God have to have they've got
[57:02] shape like like Paul said the love of
[57:05] God has got a shape it's this way that
[57:06] way that way that way and and it's your
[57:08] job to understand what that shape is
[57:10] it's not just oh the lord loves me yeah
[57:12] but what's on what does that side look
[57:13] like what does that side look like what
[57:16] does this side look like what does that
[57:17] look like what does that look like there
[57:20] do you understand it's it's it's
[57:22] substance I'll show you a uh I'll give
[57:24] an example of this this because when you
[57:27] understand that then you can better
[57:29] better comprehend the word of God and
[57:31] apply it to your own life and to other
[57:32] people's lives because if you think it's
[57:33] just one thing you're often going to
[57:35] mess up situations especially if you're
[57:37] trying to counsel people because you're
[57:38] just going to think it's that when it's
[57:41] when it's not that it's there's shape to
[57:43] it there's there's more to it it's not
[57:44] just oh you need to do this and that's
[57:45] the end of it no what's the shape of
[57:47] this that we're dealing with what shape
[57:49] is this word cuz cuz if God says he's
[57:51] going to reveal he reveals substance
[57:53] shapes and depth and angles you know
[57:56] that what he reveals to so we can better
[57:58] know what we're looking at it's not just
[57:59] a flat thing okay so so this if I said
[58:04] this pil pit you can all you all look at
[58:06] this pil pit but from where you're
[58:07] sitting you see that side there right
[58:10] like like from your perspective and if I
[58:12] stood here I can see that side like I
[58:14] see two perspectives and if I if I stood
[58:16] on this side then I would see three but
[58:20] right now I'm the only one that sees
[58:21] this side okay you like you can't see it
[58:24] it doesn't mean it doesn't exist
[58:26] just means you can't see
[58:28] it you see and often times that's like
[58:30] the word of God there are things that
[58:32] you think that doesn't make any sense
[58:34] well maybe you've just never seen it but
[58:35] if you went around there and had a look
[58:36] you'd you'd see it because it
[58:39] exists I'll show you some um where's
[58:41] brother ID come up here bro I just want
[58:43] you to because I've got what I've done
[58:45] here is I've got something behind here
[58:46] like a little
[58:51] present and um only brother ID's going
[58:53] to see it maybe one or two more okay
[58:56] should I no don't say don't say anything
[58:58] don't say
[59:02] anything you can go
[59:07] now I need adults cuz the children will
[59:09] like say
[59:11] things ad
[59:16] demand so you're thinking what's what
[59:18] are they seeing like what is there you
[59:22] you you are thinking that
[59:32] why is he smiling now what's there he's
[59:35] seen something he's perceived something
[59:36] and it's made an impact in his to him
[59:39] you know and and people being people
[59:41] were so inquisitive we're like what
[59:43] what's there you know what is
[59:46] it who doesn't who who let's go
[59:50] uh
[59:52] Josh one more we'll just do one more
[59:56] I should have chose a girl
[1:00:02] sorry now some of you are so inquisitive
[1:00:05] if I don't say anything about what it is
[1:00:07] you'll track down these brothers and us
[1:00:08] and what what was there you know because
[1:00:12] we're inquisitive when someone's
[1:00:13] perceived something what have they seen
[1:00:15] you know when someone becomes a
[1:00:17] Christian and other people are looking
[1:00:18] at them they're
[1:00:19] saying something different about that
[1:00:21] guy what's changed or that girl what
[1:00:23] have they seen like there's something
[1:00:26] they they they're acting different
[1:00:27] they're doing something different
[1:00:27] they've seen something that I don't know
[1:00:28] what it is but they've seen something
[1:00:30] they've seen something from a different
[1:00:32] perspective that you know and there was
[1:00:35] a there's a song it is no secret what
[1:00:36] God can do I know if you know that song
[1:00:38] it was that was it was an actor that
[1:00:41] wrote that and he was among circles with
[1:00:42] John Wayne and that and I think he
[1:00:44] received the Lord and he was he was
[1:00:45] always happy all the time and I think
[1:00:46] John Wayne said to him H what's going on
[1:00:48] with you man tell us your secret what
[1:00:50] what's happened that's when he said look
[1:00:51] it is no secret what God can do you know
[1:00:54] I've just looked I've looked I've seen
[1:00:56] the Lord from it I've seen him that's
[1:00:58] why I'm different
[1:00:59] now you unless you go and see what these
[1:01:03] brothers saw You' never really
[1:01:06] understand what was there but the minute
[1:01:07] you saw it you'll be like yeah I see you
[1:01:09] know and often times it's like they're
[1:01:11] with the Lord you know like like if I've
[1:01:13] seen it I've seen it if you haven't you
[1:01:17] haven't that's just the way that it is I
[1:01:19] can't force you to see and you can't
[1:01:20] make me unsee it if the Lord's revealed
[1:01:23] it to me it just is I'm like I've seen
[1:01:25] it you know I'm happy I've seen it from
[1:01:28] a different perspective what you might
[1:01:29] think it's silly whatever I've seen it
[1:01:32] you might think the word of God makes no
[1:01:33] sense you might think might think this
[1:01:34] whole Jesus stuff is not true you might
[1:01:36] think there was no such thing as a
[1:01:37] prophet say what you want I've seen it
[1:01:40] it doesn't bother me what you think I
[1:01:42] can't unsee it I've seen it from that
[1:01:44] perspective and and if and if someone
[1:01:46] else hasn't then then just never going
[1:01:47] to experience what you
[1:01:49] experience you really really want to see
[1:01:51] what's
[1:01:52] D you do it yeah you know that cuz
[1:01:55] that's what that's what humans are like
[1:01:57] like you've ever been in a padic and you
[1:01:58] see sheep walking around you know and
[1:02:00] one sheep will just start walking in a
[1:02:02] certain direction and all the other
[1:02:04] sheep sort of go hey John where's time
[1:02:08] going you
[1:02:11] know and and and they think that John
[1:02:14] seen something we always joke around in
[1:02:15] our house we always when we're saying
[1:02:17] something silly we're always joking an
[1:02:18] American and Jenna's like why do you
[1:02:20] always joking
[1:02:23] American and she always becomes John
[1:02:26] if there's a problem we say to here
[1:02:27] there's a problem right there
[1:02:29] [Laughter]
[1:02:31] John so where's John going what's he
[1:02:34] seen
[1:02:35] Tom John hasn't seen nothing but because
[1:02:38] he's walking somewhere the other sheep
[1:02:39] just think he must have seen something
[1:02:40] you know we're quite inquisitive we like
[1:02:42] what's he seen but that can work to our
[1:02:43] advantage you know because they they say
[1:02:45] what's that person seen what's changed
[1:02:47] about you tell me more about this there
[1:02:51] there you know if you something changes
[1:02:53] in your life for the Lord you can
[1:02:54] actually you get maybe one or two
[1:02:56] opportunities to people will ask you
[1:02:57] after that they're like oh I've seen
[1:02:58] yeah not interested but they will our
[1:03:00] inquisitive nature okay I'll show you
[1:03:01] what's there it's just real something
[1:03:04] real basic it just says when you see the
[1:03:07] smile and then walk and then smile all
[1:03:09] the way back to your
[1:03:11] seat sorry that
[1:03:14] was so they didn't really see much it
[1:03:16] was like
[1:03:18] that's that's a
[1:03:22] dud I want to just take you through
[1:03:25] these what I'm trying to say with this
[1:03:27] now to get to the the example of
[1:03:30] perception like if if you just looked at
[1:03:32] this like it's just flat this this
[1:03:33] scripture here go ye therefore and teach
[1:03:35] All Nations baptizing them in the name
[1:03:37] of the father son Holy Ghost just that's
[1:03:38] it okay go here's the instructions way
[1:03:40] you go
[1:03:41] go that's just that's not quite how this
[1:03:44] thing works you know like it
[1:03:47] actually it actually works like this
[1:03:50] like like that that concept is has
[1:03:52] substance it's got different angles to
[1:03:54] it it's not just that it you understand
[1:03:57] it's got substance and when you start to
[1:03:58] think what's the shape of this whole
[1:04:00] thing what does it look like oh there's
[1:04:02] another side to it which one that oh
[1:04:03] there's a scripture that says unto us a
[1:04:05] child is born okay so that child is
[1:04:07] Jesus okay and then they're going to
[1:04:09] call him the Everlasting father H are
[1:04:11] they oh it it gives it more shape you
[1:04:14] think so then this person that's walking
[1:04:16] here is the Everlasting father H and
[1:04:19] then you'd read another scripture where
[1:04:21] he was here on Earth and he would say uh
[1:04:24] he the he says at that say you will know
[1:04:26] that I in my father and you in me and I
[1:04:29] in you so you think hang on there's a
[1:04:32] person talking but he he's saying I will
[1:04:34] be in you and a physical human being
[1:04:37] can't be in another human being so
[1:04:38] what's he referring to is he referring
[1:04:41] to the spirit that's going to be in me
[1:04:42] and and that man there is saying I as an
[1:04:45] I am that Spirit you think then and it
[1:04:47] begins to make it take a shape where you
[1:04:49] understand okay then who is this what is
[1:04:51] the name of this whole thing and you get
[1:04:53] the correct shape of what it isz this is
[1:04:55] how the word of God works it's never
[1:04:57] just
[1:04:58] that cuz life isn't like that like this
[1:05:01] Pulpit has shape everything you see has
[1:05:03] shape it has depth it has height it has
[1:05:05] width everything has shape but and if
[1:05:07] you go and try and just if people try
[1:05:10] and just look the apply
[1:05:12] this shapeless revelationist concept to
[1:05:17] Christianity that's where it all comes
[1:05:18] apart because there's no Revelation
[1:05:19] there's no they don't see the shape of
[1:05:21] it and they just go around messing
[1:05:23] everything up because they don't
[1:05:24] understand there's shape there's depth
[1:05:25] all these other things like uh this is
[1:05:28] maybe one an interesting one like if you
[1:05:31] just put this shape you know you're
[1:05:32] having trouble in the marriage okay well
[1:05:33] wife just submit yourself to your
[1:05:34] husband and
[1:05:37] next all done sorted out be on your way
[1:05:40] and and be happy but there's more shape
[1:05:43] to it than that because we're talking
[1:05:44] about a marriage we're talking about
[1:05:45] people going together we're talking
[1:05:46] about Dynamics we're talking about
[1:05:48] something that that either is or isn't
[1:05:49] formed in the heavenlies and there
[1:05:51] there's shape to this thing what does
[1:05:53] what does the whole thing look like like
[1:05:54] it you you have to have know the shape
[1:05:57] of it like okay there's another side to
[1:06:00] this also the husband he's got to love
[1:06:01] his wife as he as he like his own body
[1:06:04] and he's got to give himself for it and
[1:06:06] and so there's that side of it and you
[1:06:10] and you realize that oh and there's also
[1:06:11] this concept of love that never gives up
[1:06:13] it never it never fails and and then you
[1:06:16] based on that you begin to look at the
[1:06:17] first one the wives submit yourselves
[1:06:18] and you think well then submit to who oh
[1:06:20] so he's the leader oh so what it comes
[1:06:22] with leadership oh responsibility oh so
[1:06:25] then who's responsible to create the
[1:06:27] atmosphere here who's responsible to
[1:06:29] actually lead this if if there's no love
[1:06:31] whose fault is that you know like
[1:06:34] because you want to you want the
[1:06:36] submission but you don't want the
[1:06:37] leadership you don't you don't want the
[1:06:38] responsibility of leadership you know
[1:06:40] there's more shape to it so when you
[1:06:41] start to explain the shape of it then
[1:06:43] you can you can better counsel people
[1:06:45] and get to a better understanding of
[1:06:46] what this looks like you understand uh
[1:06:49] here's one more like uh ask and it shall
[1:06:51] be given you okay so I just ask anything
[1:06:53] from the Lord Lord give me this and it
[1:06:54] get it comes to me
[1:06:56] you know that was easy what about you
[1:06:59] know what else have I got on my list you
[1:07:00] know ask ask ask ask and see see all
[1:07:03] these things in themselves are true but
[1:07:04] if you just take it as if you don't
[1:07:06] understand what does this whole thing
[1:07:07] look like CU then you might you might
[1:07:09] read another scripture and you say uh
[1:07:12] another scripture says you ask but you
[1:07:13] have not because you ask a miss that you
[1:07:16] might Heap it on your own lust
[1:07:18] now someone could just ask whatever they
[1:07:21] want and get it all the time but they're
[1:07:22] usually not a son of God because when
[1:07:24] you become a a son or daughter of God
[1:07:26] and you go that way then you get dealt
[1:07:29] with like a son or daughter so then you
[1:07:31] don't always get everything that you ask
[1:07:32] for because the Lord judges your
[1:07:34] objective and he's going okay I know you
[1:07:36] asked for it but I've got a
[1:07:38] responsibility as a father to you to say
[1:07:41] yes or no like when our children come we
[1:07:43] don't give them everything so you get
[1:07:44] dealt with differently so you you
[1:07:46] realize okay well why did I not get that
[1:07:48] oh oh that's right because I just wanted
[1:07:50] that to show off to all my friends you
[1:07:52] know cuz you you you understand this
[1:07:54] thing got more sh or you or even
[1:07:57] sometimes you just everything gets taken
[1:07:58] away from you when you want stuff you
[1:08:01] know but like you end up like job and
[1:08:02] you think oh well sometimes you think
[1:08:04] hang on I came here with nothing I I'm
[1:08:07] going to leave with nothing so if I even
[1:08:09] get one thing in my whole life it's from
[1:08:10] the Lord praise the Lord if I get
[1:08:11] nothing well I'm no I'm no worse off
[1:08:13] than when I arrived am
[1:08:15] I I came with nothing and that with
[1:08:17] nothing Lord you've been so good to me
[1:08:19] you know nothing went
[1:08:21] wrong if you get one thing you're happy
[1:08:23] praise the Lord got one thing but he
[1:08:25] gave me 10 things and he took about 10
[1:08:27] away you'll never take 11 away because
[1:08:29] you didn't have it to start with you
[1:08:30] know so you you'll never be worse off
[1:08:32] see you understand these things have
[1:08:34] they have shape they have concept so and
[1:08:36] it helps you to understand more the ways
[1:08:37] of God and his dealings when you when
[1:08:39] you go like that and that's why it says
[1:08:42] for by wise counsel Thou shalt make war
[1:08:44] and in the multitude of counselors Zer
[1:08:47] safety because because if you just have
[1:08:50] your own opinion you'll sometimes just
[1:08:51] get one one thought and then but you see
[1:08:55] when you you get counseled they'll give
[1:08:56] you all sorts of different perspectives
[1:08:57] and you can better understand what it is
[1:08:59] that you're looking at oh that's what
[1:09:01] that's who we're facing is it oh okay
[1:09:02] I'm glad I ask you and you and you
[1:09:04] because now I see what we're looking at
[1:09:05] I would have just headed in there with
[1:09:07] just my own thinking my my one
[1:09:10] opinion you
[1:09:16] understand this one here is then if we
[1:09:19] if we apply that to our spiritual life
[1:09:21] today this is why Revelation is so
[1:09:24] important to us because
[1:09:26] it's actually showing us and making us
[1:09:28] understand this whole picture of God and
[1:09:31] how he works and so we're not confused
[1:09:33] we don't just see a single thing we like
[1:09:35] the the revelation of the word of God
[1:09:37] brings it all to life like you think
[1:09:38] well I never saw that before I didn't
[1:09:40] realize that that was like that I
[1:09:40] thought it was just this now I see that
[1:09:43] I see this I see that it's like it it
[1:09:45] when you receive it as such it will open
[1:09:47] up you'll start to see you'll see a
[1:09:48] whole new world you'll see this world in
[1:09:50] spiritual form it just will all open up
[1:09:53] and and like this is to get the right
[1:09:55] perspective CU before that you could
[1:09:57] have the just got the wrong perspective
[1:09:58] but the right perspective is actually
[1:09:59] receiving the revelation of the word of
[1:10:01] God and then study it read your Bible
[1:10:02] like look into it figure out what it is
[1:10:04] you got like look around what is this
[1:10:06] what's the shape of this what's the
[1:10:07] shape of that how does this work how
[1:10:08] does that work don't just not look
[1:10:10] around there's substance to all of this
[1:10:12] stuff and that's why
[1:10:14] David David was a man that had that the
[1:10:17] Bible said of her it says that he was a
[1:10:19] man after God's Own Heart and we think
[1:10:21] to ourselves well I could never ever be
[1:10:23] a man after God's Own heart how could I
[1:10:24] ever achieve that
[1:10:25] but you actually can because all David
[1:10:28] did was he thought
[1:10:29] Lord what is your heart what do you
[1:10:32] think what's your perspective on things
[1:10:34] I'll read your word like the next one
[1:10:35] says Thy word have i hidden my heart
[1:10:37] that I might not sin against you I'll
[1:10:38] read your word to get your perspective
[1:10:39] on things and then you and I will think
[1:10:42] Alik you my thinking will align with
[1:10:44] your thinking and then when we come into
[1:10:45] situations we will our thinking will be
[1:10:47] similar and then we'll get on well you
[1:10:49] know whereas if I've got my if I just
[1:10:52] have this opinion here and differs with
[1:10:53] yours We're No Doubt probably going to
[1:10:56] and I'm not going to be a man after
[1:10:57] God's Own Heart but it's very easy for
[1:10:59] you to be especially with the Revelation
[1:11:00] that we've been given we can actually
[1:11:02] become like David and be man and woman
[1:11:04] after God's Own Heart that's why when
[1:11:07] when
[1:11:08] David his his perception he had the
[1:11:11] right perception so when he turned up to
[1:11:14] say Goliath was there when David turned
[1:11:15] up to this fight the perception of the
[1:11:19] people there was a man would look at
[1:11:21] himself and think okay this me here I'm
[1:11:23] this big I've got this sword I've got
[1:11:24] this spear
[1:11:25] I look over there there's Goliath he's
[1:11:27] that big he's that wide he's got that
[1:11:29] big sword and he's got that big spear he
[1:11:32] will probably beat me and their
[1:11:34] perception was correct like okay if I go
[1:11:37] head-to-head with him he's more than
[1:11:38] twice as big twice as long I wouldn't
[1:11:40] even get close to him his spear would
[1:11:42] spear me that was their perception and
[1:11:45] they acted on that perception that's why
[1:11:47] they were all standing there scared
[1:11:48] because that's all they were seeing but
[1:11:50] but see David walked in with a different
[1:11:52] perspective with the right perspective
[1:11:54] he he cuz he understood this a bit more
[1:11:57] cuz he now he he saw that perspective
[1:12:00] cuz that is a perspective that's the
[1:12:02] front flat side yeah he saw the same
[1:12:04] thing yep I'm David I'm smaller than all
[1:12:06] you guys I'm about 14 I'm a lot smaller
[1:12:09] yep that guy's a lot bigger than me yep
[1:12:11] I've only got a sling yep he's got a big
[1:12:12] Spear and all that sort of stuff yep I
[1:12:14] can see that I understand that
[1:12:17] perspective yes but then he started to
[1:12:19] think hang on and all of this always has
[1:12:21] to start with there's a God hang on hang
[1:12:24] on let's let's just pull back a little
[1:12:26] bit there's a God like all perspective
[1:12:29] has to start with that as a foundational
[1:12:31] Viewpoint because the fear of God is the
[1:12:33] beginning of wisdom you you can't have
[1:12:35] perspective unless you realize there is
[1:12:36] a God because everything stems from that
[1:12:38] he says okay all right let's get it
[1:12:40] let's let's let's get this all into
[1:12:42] perspective here there is a God right
[1:12:45] and oh he's he happens to have chosen
[1:12:49] some people as his own who are they H oh
[1:12:53] that's us
[1:12:55] okay okay so that makes us God's people
[1:12:58] and uh we're soldiers oh so that makes
[1:13:00] us God's Army hm
[1:13:02] okay uh so then and he's given us
[1:13:06] land what land is that oh it's this oh
[1:13:12] okay uh and so now based on that then
[1:13:15] who was this other
[1:13:17] guy
[1:13:19] uh he's actually way out of his
[1:13:22] depth like because technically he's now
[1:13:25] fighting against this living God in his
[1:13:28] army and he has got absolutely no show
[1:13:31] of ever winning in this battle and he's
[1:13:32] actually on God's
[1:13:34] Turf that was his perspective so it's
[1:13:37] like so from based on that perspective
[1:13:39] he said hang on hang on you guys are all
[1:13:40] looking at that that's all wrong who is
[1:13:42] this guy that's defying the armies of
[1:13:44] the Living
[1:13:46] God what are you guys doing sitting here
[1:13:48] and being scared of that you've got the
[1:13:49] wrong perspective and based on that
[1:13:51] perspective he went and annihilated
[1:13:53] Goliath because he had the right perspec
[1:13:55] effective right not only that but but
[1:13:58] how he would conduct himself like when
[1:13:59] when he could go and kill Saul the men
[1:14:02] next to him said David this is your
[1:14:04] chance this guy has hampered you your
[1:14:05] whole life you're when he's gone you're
[1:14:08] going to be the king um now's your
[1:14:10] opportunity the Lord's given them to
[1:14:11] your hands kill him that is their
[1:14:15] perspective but you see David had a a
[1:14:17] more Godly perspective he said no no
[1:14:19] hang on there's a God and he anoints
[1:14:22] people and he happened to anoint this
[1:14:24] person and and he's still anointed I'm
[1:14:26] not touching this guy not only that I
[1:14:28] don't have to mle in God's Affairs if he
[1:14:30] wants to make me King he'll make me King
[1:14:31] when he wants to make me King he will do
[1:14:33] it I don't have to go and help him out
[1:14:34] and kill this guy see it was a different
[1:14:36] perspective that that that caused him to
[1:14:38] have a better outcome I've just got a
[1:14:41] few
[1:14:42] more this one here CH little children
[1:14:45] I'm going to teach you something called
[1:14:46] wisdom do you want to know what wisdom
[1:14:48] is after this you're going to have a
[1:14:50] perfect concept of wisdom
[1:14:53] okay and if you apply it to your life it
[1:14:55] will change your life so what do you see
[1:14:58] there like if you if you look at the
[1:15:00] picture you say oh you see a
[1:15:03] guy and a chair and a little like a
[1:15:06] dwarf type person sitting on the chair
[1:15:08] right like like you all see that
[1:15:10] currently that is what you see cuz You'
[1:15:12] maybe you've seen this before but if you
[1:15:13] haven't seen this before you see that
[1:15:14] picture so to your reality that's that's
[1:15:17] it cuz you're you're none the wiser you
[1:15:20] know you're not you're just that's
[1:15:22] that's all you've got to go on is that
[1:15:24] that is that there
[1:15:25] right and often times when we you know
[1:15:27] when we're young and we're growing up we
[1:15:28] think well this would be a cool thing to
[1:15:30] do CU we don't we don't know anything
[1:15:32] else we just think well that guy that
[1:15:34] movie star was cool I'll be just like
[1:15:35] them you
[1:15:36] know and that's all we got to go on now
[1:15:40] but this is from a
[1:15:43] perspective but if if we just turn a
[1:15:45] little bit and look at this from a
[1:15:46] different perspective you'll see a
[1:15:48] different picture right so that's so if
[1:15:50] we this here is just you just turn
[1:15:53] around a little bit this is exactly the
[1:15:54] same situation exactly the same thing
[1:15:55] just from a different perspective you
[1:15:57] begin to see actually what I was saying
[1:15:58] before wasn't
[1:16:00] correct like that person is not right
[1:16:02] there next to that guy that it's all
[1:16:04] it's all wared it's not as it's not what
[1:16:05] I
[1:16:06] thought
[1:16:09] and now if I bring back to that one I'll
[1:16:13] never ever convince you that that's like
[1:16:15] that anymore you'll say no no no no no
[1:16:17] that's not like that that's all around
[1:16:20] the other way I'll never convince you
[1:16:21] otherwise why is that because you're
[1:16:24] wiser
[1:16:26] I I'll never convince you but like if
[1:16:28] someone walked in the door here and they
[1:16:29] hadn't seen it they're going to be
[1:16:30] utterly convinced that's that you're
[1:16:32] going to say no man honestly it's not
[1:16:34] it's not
[1:16:36] that it's not that it's it's I'm just
[1:16:39] trust me often you hear parents say just
[1:16:41] trust me it's not that trust me
[1:16:44] see and a lot of the times when your
[1:16:46] parents tell you stuff you just got to
[1:16:48] trust them it's not that you know I've
[1:16:50] been their son I've been their daughter
[1:16:52] I've been through it trust me it's not
[1:16:53] that don't follow that guy it's not that
[1:16:57] it's uh it's
[1:16:59] this and because because you see it from
[1:17:02] a different perspective you and it can
[1:17:03] never be CH undone your your law now
[1:17:05] when you're when you're wiser you're
[1:17:06] like I can see it now and we often spend
[1:17:09] half of our time trying to convince
[1:17:10] people this trust me man don't go don't
[1:17:14] go down that
[1:17:16] road this is the last thought that I
[1:17:18] want to I want to speak
[1:17:19] on and it's um it's a perspective that
[1:17:22] we should have in our Christian walk
[1:17:24] that that
[1:17:26] that if we ever start to get despondent
[1:17:28] or anything like that this is a
[1:17:29] perspective that we should always have
[1:17:31] in our Christian walk okay then I'm
[1:17:32] going to close with this this is a if
[1:17:34] you keep this one in perspective you'll
[1:17:36] always be all right in your life no
[1:17:37] matter where you go no matter what
[1:17:38] happens if you learn to just every now
[1:17:41] and then if it all goes a certain way if
[1:17:42] you pull back to this perspective that
[1:17:43] I'm about to show you it'll it'll it
[1:17:45] will you'll always be
[1:17:47] okay Romans 8:28 says and we know that
[1:17:49] all things work together for good to
[1:17:51] them that love God and to them who are
[1:17:53] the called according to his purpose
[1:17:55] okay so if we're called according to his
[1:17:57] purpose then it says for whom he did
[1:17:59] Forno he also did predestinate to be
[1:18:01] conformed to the image of his
[1:18:04] son so if he fornew you then he's going
[1:18:06] to work on you and you're going to be
[1:18:07] conformed to the image of his son that
[1:18:09] he might be the firstborn among many
[1:18:10] Brethren moreover whom he did
[1:18:12] predestinate them he also called and
[1:18:14] whom he called them he also Justified
[1:18:16] and whom he justified them he also
[1:18:18] glorified okay so there's this process
[1:18:19] he's saying if we often use that first
[1:18:22] verse that all things work together for
[1:18:23] the good to them that love God so I'm
[1:18:24] going to get that new job cuz I love God
[1:18:27] that's not what that verse is even
[1:18:28] though we might apply sometimes it
[1:18:29] actually isn't it's it's not really
[1:18:31] applicable in that
[1:18:33] situation I don't we can you know apply
[1:18:36] it that way you know try and but the
[1:18:39] reality is it's it's based on you are
[1:18:42] called according to his purpose like
[1:18:43] your soul is called according to his
[1:18:45] purpose and he is going to work a work
[1:18:47] in you and he's going to eventually
[1:18:48] bring you out to be a what does it say
[1:18:50] at the end a glorified son or daughter
[1:18:52] of God because at the beginning you were
[1:18:54] that
[1:18:56] you're called according to his purpose
[1:18:57] and his purpose was to bring you there
[1:18:59] so you are going to be taken all the way
[1:19:00] to the end right so that that's going to
[1:19:02] be that's going to be where you end
[1:19:05] up now based on that perspective you'd
[1:19:07] say okay what shall we say to these
[1:19:11] things if God be for us who can be
[1:19:13] against us now we've often used that
[1:19:15] scripture I have too like oh if God's
[1:19:16] for me who can be against me in the
[1:19:17] situation I'm facing but even that's not
[1:19:19] applicable to that cuz you understand
[1:19:23] like now if I know God's form me I can
[1:19:24] apply it to there but ultimately this
[1:19:26] verse doesn't mean that right this ver
[1:19:29] this verse
[1:19:30] means uh if God before us in terms of if
[1:19:34] God has determined that we will be there
[1:19:36] how could anything else ever hinder him
[1:19:38] from getting us there it's based on that
[1:19:41] it's not based on he's going to help me
[1:19:42] out in my troubles over here because he
[1:19:44] didn't promise that but he said I'll get
[1:19:46] you there right that's why he
[1:19:50] says um he that spared not his own son
[1:19:53] but delivered him up for us all if he's
[1:19:55] willing to pay that big a price how
[1:19:57] shall he not with him also freely give
[1:19:59] us all things that means all things that
[1:20:01] pertain to Salvation like all things
[1:20:03] that will get you saved it doesn't mean
[1:20:05] I going to give you everything you want
[1:20:06] in life it's to do with getting you
[1:20:08] there if you need anything to get there
[1:20:10] he's paid it all and he'll get you there
[1:20:13] okay that's what it that's what it
[1:20:14] relates to then he says who shall lay
[1:20:17] anything to the charge of God's elect
[1:20:19] how then could
[1:20:21] you who is possibly going to hinder that
[1:20:23] whole purpose then because if it's been
[1:20:25] fully paid he's going to give you
[1:20:25] everything you need to get there then
[1:20:27] anything that gets tries to hind you
[1:20:29] along the way no he not good enough
[1:20:30] she's not good enough all these things
[1:20:31] he says how's that even going to affect
[1:20:33] anything it's all been paid for it's all
[1:20:34] done you're going to get there who shall
[1:20:36] L anything to the charge of God's elect
[1:20:38] it is God that justifieth God's already
[1:20:39] purpose you you're Justified and and no
[1:20:42] one's going to come in and change his
[1:20:44] mind who is he that
[1:20:46] condemneth because he's saying it's
[1:20:48] Christ that died yeah rather that has
[1:20:49] risen again and it was even at the right
[1:20:51] hand of God who also maketh intercession
[1:20:53] for us so saying even if even if someone
[1:20:55] condemns you you've got this you've got
[1:20:57] Christ that's
[1:20:58] always standing up for you
[1:21:02] right now then you bring it down to this
[1:21:06] that's why Paul brings it down now to
[1:21:07] the realm we live in and he says based
[1:21:09] on that then what shall separate us from
[1:21:11] this love that's there uh he's saying
[1:21:14] shall tribulation if you have a bit of
[1:21:16] trouble is it going to separate you if
[1:21:18] you have distress uh if you have
[1:21:20] persecution if you have famine nakedness
[1:21:23] if you have if there's a or if there's a
[1:21:25] sword uh and then he goes on and says uh
[1:21:28] basically as it is written you will get
[1:21:30] all those things for thy sake we are
[1:21:33] killed all the day long we are accounted
[1:21:34] as sheep for the
[1:21:36] slaughter now we often try and think
[1:21:38] well well if I don't have those things
[1:21:40] in my life then my life's going to be
[1:21:41] good that's the wrong
[1:21:44] perspective because because basically
[1:21:46] he's saying look you're pretty much
[1:21:47] going to have all these things but none
[1:21:49] of those things are going to affect you
[1:21:52] getting there and being that that's the
[1:21:55] perspective right so he's pretty much
[1:21:57] guaranteeing yeah you like he's saying
[1:22:00] it's like like we often think when we
[1:22:01] serve the Lord we have a we have a easy
[1:22:03] path and everything goes well that's not
[1:22:05] how it works and there was never
[1:22:06] promised to be that way it's actually
[1:22:08] the opposite he says you're going to get
[1:22:09] all those things like tribulation tick
[1:22:12] you know distress tick persecution tick
[1:22:16] famine tick nakedness tick Peril tick a
[1:22:19] sword killed all the day long and cuted
[1:22:21] a sheep for sort of tick tick tick
[1:22:23] you're think oh man what a ter terrible
[1:22:25] walk but his perspective is I've
[1:22:27] guaranteed if you start here you're
[1:22:28] going to finish up here no matter which
[1:22:30] one of these things you go through right
[1:22:32] but we often in our perspective look at
[1:22:34] these things and oh life is so hard and
[1:22:36] oh man oh you know we get down because
[1:22:37] we look at this we we go through things
[1:22:40] and we look at that that's in it because
[1:22:41] our perspective is wrong we're just
[1:22:42] we're seeing this whole thing on a page
[1:22:44] like that now these things exist and
[1:22:46] they make us they make life hard and all
[1:22:47] that sort of stuff yeah they they do but
[1:22:49] but the moment you start to zoom in on
[1:22:51] them and just focus on them your whole
[1:22:53] perspective is going to be wrong and
[1:22:54] your life is going to be miserable cuz
[1:22:55] you're looking at the wrong thing so
[1:22:56] then what you got to do is do this you
[1:22:58] just got to zoom out a little bit like
[1:22:59] you just got that see that it's actually
[1:23:02] what you do you got to get the right
[1:23:04] perspective you say okay no no no no
[1:23:06] we'll just we'll zoom out we'll see what
[1:23:09] actually there is
[1:23:10] here and that's why Paul says based on
[1:23:14] all this the P the P the proper
[1:23:15] perspective is nay and all these things
[1:23:18] what's he talking about those little
[1:23:19] things over there they're basically ruin
[1:23:21] your whole life and your whole existence
[1:23:23] here can do and all those things we are
[1:23:28] more than conquerors through him that
[1:23:30] loved us he's not saying you're
[1:23:32] conquerers because you won't have them
[1:23:33] he's saying your conquerors because he's
[1:23:35] going to bring you right to the
[1:23:37] end for I am persuaded that neither
[1:23:39] death nor life nor angels nor
[1:23:41] principalities nor powers nor things
[1:23:43] present nor things to come nor height
[1:23:46] nor depth nor any other creature shall
[1:23:49] be able to separate us from the love of
[1:23:51] God which is in Christ Jesus our
[1:23:53] lord and that's the perspective that the
[1:23:55] Lord wants us to have is look no matter
[1:23:57] what you're going through remember who
[1:24:00] cares zoom out who cares what does it
[1:24:03] matter if you if you live your life like
[1:24:06] that from that perspective your life is
[1:24:07] just going to be miserable because
[1:24:08] you're never going to get away from
[1:24:09] these things you'll finish one another
[1:24:11] one will start mark my words you'll
[1:24:14] never get away from that there'll be
[1:24:15] there'll be some some sort one way one
[1:24:17] way this way but that's not the victory
[1:24:19] the victory is an understanding in all
[1:24:20] of those things I'm more than a
[1:24:22] conqueror that that he's got a plan and
[1:24:25] a purpose for me I start here I end up
[1:24:27] there that's my that's the perspective
[1:24:28] that I that I look
[1:24:31] to and that was I know it's been a bit
[1:24:34] sort of throwing information at you but
[1:24:36] I want you to think about this this week
[1:24:38] okay and like you know you you'll sort
[1:24:40] of dissect it and let it sort of sink in
[1:24:43] that the word of God's this amazing it's
[1:24:46] this world of it's it's just it's got
[1:24:48] perspective it's got depth and anytime
[1:24:50] you come into a situation just think
[1:24:51] there's got to be more to this Lord show
[1:24:52] me about the situation show me Lord what
