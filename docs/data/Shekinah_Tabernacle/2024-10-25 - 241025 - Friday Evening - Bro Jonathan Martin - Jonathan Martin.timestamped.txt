[8:27] Heat.
[9:25] There you go.
[9:48] back here again.
[9:50] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[9:51] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[9:53] &gt;&gt; Amen. I believe we're going to have a
[9:54] tremendous weekend.
[9:57] But before we begin, we have Liz here,
[9:59] the camp manager, camp owner, who's
[10:02] going to go through a few health and
[10:04] safety [music] things. But as she comes,
[10:07] let's give her a round of applause
[10:08] because we appreciate.
[10:11] [applause]
[10:22] Hi guys, welcome back to Forest Lakes.
[10:24] Many of you will have heard already what
[10:26] I'm going to say, but we do need to
[10:28] cover over what to do in an emergency.
[10:32] And so, if you haven't been before or
[10:33] you've forgotten, out on the playing
[10:35] field on the field side of the fence,
[10:38] there are some numbers 1 to 22. So,
[10:42] those are where you're going to line up
[10:43] if you're in those cabins. And then
[10:45] there's a Lake Lodge section and a Wawa
[10:47] section. And there isn't a villa
[10:49] section, but you can go next to W tower.
[10:52] Um, so if there's a fire, that's where
[10:54] you're going to congregate in an
[10:56] emergency. However, with an earthquake,
[10:58] you're only going to go there if it's
[11:01] safe after the shaking has stopped. In
[11:05] the meantime, if an earthquake happens,
[11:06] it's the normal drop cover, hold, try
[11:09] and stay away from windows. And um once
[11:12] the shaking stopped, then um move there.
[11:15] If you're a child, then the adults will
[11:17] tell you what to do because it's one of
[11:19] those things you've got to make it up.
[11:21] As it kind of happens, you don't know
[11:23] what is actually going to happen. Um, in
[11:25] here, we're going to stick a piece of
[11:27] paper over that sign that says exit out
[11:29] there cuz that's not an exit, but you've
[11:31] got exits out here. And you can kind of
[11:35] get out here and there's an exit over
[11:37] here. Um, the same in the dining room.
[11:42] There are a few exits over there. just
[11:43] please make sure you don't block those
[11:45] during the weekend so that they can stay
[11:47] as an exit. Um so that's the general
[11:51] evacuation stuff. Um as far as things
[11:54] like the playground goes, um one person
[11:56] at a time on the trampoline and a
[11:58] maximum of four on the tire swing. Um
[12:02] the camp activities are out of bounds
[12:04] unless it's an organized recreation
[12:06] time. And then there'll be instructions
[12:09] from Ben. Yep. instructions from Ben on
[12:12] what's being used, how it's being used,
[12:14] and I'll chat with people that are
[12:16] running activities Saturday afternoon.
[12:18] Yep. Saturday afternoon. So, some of you
[12:20] will be asked to lead an activity
[12:23] Saturday afternoon. You can come and see
[12:24] me and I'll be pretty much around the
[12:26] office most of the weekend. Um, and
[12:29] there just some pieces of paper to sign
[12:31] for your supervisor agreement once I've
[12:33] run over the instructions for safely
[12:36] running the activity. Um,
[12:39] if you are staying in the villas and you
[12:41] want your towels changed out, just feel
[12:43] free to bring them to the office and
[12:45] then I can give you some replacements to
[12:47] take back. Um,
[12:50] if you well for everybody, most of the
[12:55] cabins have their own bathroom and in
[12:57] there you'll find two toilet paper
[12:59] dispensers. Um, some of them a bit
[13:02] tricky because they feed from the inside
[13:03] of the roll and still it still looks
[13:05] like looks like there's stuff at the
[13:07] outside. Um, but if they are not working
[13:10] properly, there are some keys that will
[13:12] unlock them in some cupboards that are
[13:14] just outside. If you look at the office
[13:16] door to the left of there, there's the
[13:18] cleaning supplies cupboard. There will
[13:20] be toilet paper in there and keys to
[13:22] unlock those. So, if one runs out,
[13:24] please replace it. You'll still have a
[13:26] second one to use, but if they both run
[13:28] out, then you've got a problem. So great
[13:30] if you can replace it after the first
[13:32] one runs out. And then at the end of the
[13:34] weekend when it comes to tidy up, um
[13:37] you'll also find cleaning stuff there.
[13:39] If you need a vacuum cleaner throughout
[13:40] the weekend, underneath the staircase in
[13:43] the octagonal building will be vacuum
[13:45] cleaners. Um,
[13:48] and when it comes to doing your dishes,
[13:51] we have got, well, you've employed some
[13:53] people to do the dishes for you, which
[13:55] means you don't have to do them, but it
[13:57] would be really helpful when you bring
[13:58] them up if you can stack them in the
[14:02] trays. If the trays are full, please try
[14:05] and stack your plates in an orderly
[14:07] fashion. Your cutlery will go into
[14:09] containers that are blue labeled knife,
[14:12] fork, spoon. So you can pop them in
[14:14] there and that's going to make the job a
[14:16] lot easier for the people that are
[14:18] cleaning. If you are using cups, please
[14:21] don't take them wandering around camp
[14:22] and leave them there because we'll end
[14:24] up or and same with the plates and the
[14:26] crockery, not enough for meals. So
[14:28] please make sure you return them back
[14:30] there and they get washed. Um
[14:34] yeah, I think that's most of it. Yeah,
[14:38] have a great weekend and I hope you've
[14:40] brought your umbrella.
[14:43] Thank you very much. Appreciate it.
[14:44] Thank you. [applause]
[14:49] Amen. We're in for a tremendous time.

[17:53] to a good home. And um Yeah. So that's
[17:57] all the notices.
[17:59] Now I'd like to give you the most
[18:01] important notice though. Okay. It says
[18:03] in it says in you know I've been
[18:05] thinking about this camp and every year
[18:08] God has done something special. Every
[18:10] year the first camp we had some young
[18:13] people came young sisters came and they
[18:15] basically before the camp they gave God
[18:17] an ultimatum. God if this message is you
[18:21] you've got to show yourself at this camp
[18:24] otherwise I'm walking away. And God in
[18:26] his infinite mercy showed himself to
[18:29] them. And how many people have been
[18:32] touched, healed just spontaneously.
[18:35] Spirits have been cast out. Lives have
[18:38] been changed. The Holy Ghost has poured
[18:40] himself out. Service after service. This
[18:43] camp has been a supernatural camp.
[18:46] &gt;&gt; I believe this camp is not not our camp.
[18:48] I believe it's God's camp. Right? You've
[18:51] come to a a meeting that the Lord Jesus
[18:53] has wanted and we're here again. So I
[18:57] just want to read a scripture. I've been
[18:59] thinking about this scripture about this
[19:00] camp. Says in Luke 19
[19:04] and verse one, "And Jesus entered and
[19:06] passed through Jericho. And behold,
[19:08] there was a man named Zakius, which was
[19:10] the chief among the publicans, and he
[19:12] was rich. And he sought to see Jesus who
[19:15] he was, and could not for the press,
[19:18] because he was little of stature. and he
[19:20] ran before and climbed up into a
[19:22] sycamore tree to see him, for he was to
[19:25] pass that way. I believe the Lord Jesus
[19:28] Christ is going to pass this way over
[19:32] this weekend. He's going to walk here.
[19:34] He's going to touch lives. He's passing
[19:37] by. So, I would, if I was you, it
[19:39] doesn't matter if you've known him for
[19:40] decades. Maybe you don't haven't met him
[19:42] yet. Just just say, "Lord," with your
[19:44] faith, say, "Lord, come and come and
[19:46] touch my life. Lord, may your word
[19:48] become a living reality because we all
[19:50] need more of him.
[19:52] &gt;&gt; Amen. We're not here just to go through
[19:53] emotion. We're here that the Lord would
[19:55] touch us, would change us. You know,
[19:57] just before this that we read about in
[19:59] uh 19, the end of that was where blind
[20:01] Barameus was there and he was he was
[20:04] hearing, you know, his his his mother,
[20:06] sorry for taking the time, but his
[20:07] mother would teach him when he was young
[20:09] about what God did in Jericho with
[20:11] Joshua and Elijah and Elisha and all
[20:13] these things. And you know, he heard a
[20:15] bunch of noise when he was a blind man
[20:17] there by the wall and someone said,
[20:18] "This is Jesus passing by." So if you
[20:21] hear a bunch of noise, it's more than
[20:23] emotion. It's Jesus passing by. And he
[20:26] began to realize the God he heard about
[20:28] of history was now the God in the
[20:29] present. And and and he be to call out
[20:32] to God. And and the prophet taught us it
[20:34] wasn't the how loud he was calling. It
[20:37] was his faith stopped the master. And it
[20:39] says the scripture says, "And Jesus
[20:41] stood still
[20:42] &gt;&gt; and called um Baras to come to him."
[20:46] &gt;&gt; So let your faith touch him
[20:49] &gt;&gt; and he will he will have give you a
[20:51] private
[20:52] &gt;&gt; one- on-one
[20:53] &gt;&gt; and he's going to change your life
[20:55] because you got to think about it. It's
[20:56] not a doctrine passing this way. It's
[20:59] not a bunch of quotes passing this way.
[21:02] It's not a church movement passing this
[21:04] way. It's the Lord of glory is going to
[21:06] be passing this way.
[21:09] Amen.
[21:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[21:10] &gt;&gt; So I believe, you know, as we as we open
[21:13] these services in a word of prayer,
[21:15] let's just dedicate our lives and say,
[21:17] "Lord,
[21:18] &gt;&gt; I need you
[21:20] &gt;&gt; more than ever."
[21:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. So let's how about let's bow our
[21:24] heads and let's dedicate our lives to
[21:27] the Lord. You know, we could stand here
[21:29] for hours and talk about angel choir
[21:32] singing be, you know, you know, with us
[21:34] when we're singing at our first camp and
[21:36] God touching people and he's not a God
[21:38] of history. He's the God of the present.
[21:41] &gt;&gt; So, let's invite him. Do you know
[21:43] personally do that cuz the because we
[21:45] are told Jesus always comes where he's
[21:47] invited.
[21:49] &gt;&gt; So, how about how about you invite him
[21:50] to where you're at this uh tonight?
[21:52] Okay. So, let's bow our heads and and
[21:54] pray. Gracious Father, just to think,
[21:58] Lord, that you would pass this way.
[22:01] We're so thankful. It's more than a nice
[22:02] idea. It's more than even a nice
[22:04] scripture. It's a reality, Lord, because
[22:06] you are the same yesterday, today,
[22:09] tonight, and forever. So, dear God, as
[22:12] we've assembled, dear God, we know many
[22:14] are still traveling to these meetings,
[22:16] but Father, as we've gathered here, and
[22:18] there's others who are watching, Lord,
[22:20] by the way of the internet, Lord, we
[22:22] just want to invite you to where we are.
[22:24] come to come by our house, oh God. Touch
[22:27] our lives, Lord Jesus. Lord, we don't
[22:29] want to leave this campground. The same
[22:31] people we came here. We want to be
[22:33] changed and renewed, Lord God. And not
[22:36] just for a moment of time and go back
[22:38] into some cycle, but we want to go
[22:39] higher with you, Lord, that we could say
[22:42] that at 2025 at a campground here at the
[22:45] Forest Lakes, you came by our way and
[22:48] you touched us, dear God. You changed
[22:50] us, Lord. Grant it, Father. We commit
[22:52] our lives. We commit the service. We
[22:54] commit this campground into your hands.
[22:56] Lord, I pray you just cover it in your
[22:57] blood, dear God. May your angels take up
[22:59] their positions, Father. And dear God,
[23:02] may you just come inhabit the praises of
[23:03] your people, Lord. You know what
[23:05] everything is going on in our lives,
[23:07] Lord Jesus. And may you come by our way
[23:09] this weekend, Lord. We invite you here.
[23:12] Take the highest place in our lives,
[23:14] Lord. Be the most welcome one. Grant it,
[23:17] Father. Father, we commit the service
[23:18] into your hands. We pray you'd bless
[23:20] Brother Jonathan, Father, mightily as he
[23:22] stands behind the pulpit, Lord. Fill his
[23:24] mouth with your words, oh God, and speak
[23:26] personally to each and every one of us,
[23:28] Lord. Doesn't matter how old or young we
[23:30] are. We all need you. Grant it, dear
[23:32] God, in Jesus Christ's name we pray.
[23:35] Amen.
[23:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[23:37] &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you, friends. We have
[23:38] brother Jonathan Martin ministering
[23:40] [music] uh tonight. Brother John Andy's
[23:42] is ministering in the morning. But I
[23:43] believe this will be the greatest camp.
[23:46] Amen.
[23:47] &gt;&gt; We have ever had.
[23:49] &gt;&gt; Amen. Because our Lord Jesus is present.
[23:51] Amen. So, God bless you. I'll turn it.
[23:54] Thank you.
[23:57] &gt;&gt; God bless you.
[23:57] &gt;&gt; God bless you.
[24:00] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. God bless you everyone.
[24:03] &gt;&gt; How are you all?
[24:05] &gt;&gt; You good?
[24:07] &gt;&gt; It's very, very good to see you all.
[24:10] &gt;&gt; And I know that I love you all and you
[24:13] love me. Amen.
[24:16] &gt;&gt; And I know this for a fact that [music]
[24:20] the the God that we're coming to
[24:24] right now loves us.
[24:29] &gt;&gt; And it's such an amazing thing to to
[24:32] realize the heart of God for us. Can I
[24:35] just tell you a little little one minute
[24:38] story?
[24:41] &gt;&gt; So, you know, you you get the enemy
[24:44] comes at you for sometimes. years and
[24:45] he's just knocking at you and and
[24:46] [music] he tries to convince us in our
[24:48] mind that that maybe God doesn't think
[24:50] so much of us as what we think he does
[24:52] and you know maybe he he he sws negative
[24:54] thoughts in our minds. You ever had
[24:55] that? Yeah.
[24:57] &gt;&gt; You know, like he just
[25:00] he tries to undermine God's feelings
[25:02] towards us and tries to get our mind
[25:04] twisted in a different way and you know
[25:06] he if he has a long time to do this and
[25:08] a lot of energy he can sometimes work on
[25:10] us quite a lot you know [laughter]
[25:13] and and I remember
[25:16] he had been at me for years and years
[25:17] and you you can sometimes get a wrong
[25:18] thought in your brain in your mind about
[25:20] how you know maybe the Lord does think
[25:22] this little thing about me is not quite
[25:23] that or
[25:26] I had such a powerful experience
[25:29] recently when I we were there was a
[25:30] communion service and I just when I
[25:32] walked up to just before I went to take
[25:34] communion, there was such a powerful
[25:35] anointing of the presence of God there.
[25:37] It it just you can't help but weep, you
[25:40] know. It's just it's it's very powerful.
[25:43] And we we took communion there and
[25:45] prayed and I I managed to somehow get
[25:47] through the prayer without falling to
[25:48] pieces because you just you just know
[25:50] there's something here.
[25:54] Sorry brethren was cyborg.
[26:00] Um
[26:02] then I walked in front of this pulpit
[26:04] here at the church and as I got to
[26:06] before the the wine there just it's like
[26:08] I walked into the heart of God.
[26:11] Like there was such a strong anointing.

[1:05:49] Your great name. Your great name.
[1:06:00] What a marvelous [music] name.
[1:06:03] The Lord Jesus Christ
[1:06:06] is the mighty [music] conqueror among
[1:06:07] us.
[1:06:09] He's our captain. He's never lost a
[1:06:11] battle.
[1:06:12] &gt;&gt; He's the same yesterday, today, and
[1:06:14] forever.
[1:06:16] [music] And I believe that the prophet
[1:06:18] of God taught us that he is the
[1:06:20] unchanging God. He's just uh changing
[1:06:23] [music] his mass. He's God in Morphe. I
[1:06:27] believe that he's God in morphe in a
[1:06:30] group of people that is that knows him
[1:06:32] and the power of his resurrection.
[1:06:35] And uh I I believe that I'm looking at
[1:06:38] Jesus Christ. Mrs. [music] Jesus Christ.
[1:06:41] It's God in flesh. And I I tell you, we
[1:06:44] are we are recognized and identified as
[1:06:48] an invincible army. And it's uh so good
[1:06:51] to be uh gathered uh with [music] you
[1:06:54] this evening. and uh count it just a
[1:06:57] great privilege to be here and [music]
[1:06:59] uh we appreciate the invitation.
[1:07:02] We uh we bring greetings from [music] uh
[1:07:06] our pastor, brother Wayne Lawson, and uh
[1:07:08] the church there in Bluffton, Ohio, uh
[1:07:12] uh True Word Tabernacle. [music] And
[1:07:14] they all send their greetings and and uh
[1:07:17] salute you and say, "God richly bless
[1:07:19] you." And uh it's so uh so good to
[1:07:22] [music] just see everyone. And uh are
[1:07:25] you looking have you come with a great
[1:07:27] expectation?
[1:07:28] Amen. I I have come with a great
[1:07:31] expectation myself and it's good to have
[1:07:34] my wife here. I see her there. and uh
[1:07:36] Sister Laura. Uh it's a just [music] a
[1:07:39] real privilege to have her uh able to
[1:07:42] come and uh real real uh honor for me to
[1:07:46] be able to minister with brother [music]
[1:07:48] John uh brother John Andes and sure love
[1:07:51] brother John and uh just appreciate him
[1:07:54] and his ministry and uh the gift that
[1:07:56] God has placed in his life and a great
[1:07:59] blessing to the bride [music] of Jesus
[1:08:00] Christ and and uh so we're just looking
[1:08:03] for uh just a wonderful time in the Lord
[1:08:06] [music] and I know that if you've come
[1:08:09] uh just with a with your cup lifted up,
[1:08:12] I know God's going to fill it. [music]
[1:08:14] And uh I know that if you've come with
[1:08:17] maybe a burden on your heart or maybe
[1:08:20] you've got a need, I believe that God
[1:08:22] will meet that need. And uh you get what
[1:08:26] you expect. [music]
[1:08:27] And uh I you know I believe that God is
[1:08:31] just going to do the supernatural
[1:08:32] [music] and and he's going to manifest
[1:08:34] himself in a supernatural way. And uh
[1:08:38] you know I believe that this is not a
[1:08:40] man's message. Uh but the message is
[1:08:43] Christ. And uh I believe that uh he
[1:08:47] [music] said if if you lift me up I'll
[1:08:50] draw all men unto myself. And and uh
[1:08:53] that's our burden. That's our our vision
[1:08:56] is just to exalt Christ so high that
[1:08:59] he's above every trial. He's above every
[1:09:02] family situation. [music] He's above
[1:09:05] everything that you may go through,
[1:09:06] everything the devil can throw at you in
[1:09:08] this life. [music] Uh we're just here to
[1:09:11] exalt Christ and the power of his
[1:09:13] resurrection. And uh I I'm zealous about
[1:09:17] this message. [music]
[1:09:18] I think that we should be passionate
[1:09:20] about the message of the hour. uh not a
[1:09:23] not ashamed of it. Uh Paul said that I'm
[1:09:26] not ashamed of the gospel for it's the
[1:09:29] power of God unto salvation to everyone
[1:09:31] that believeth. And I believe that we
[1:09:34] can exalt this this message so high and
[1:09:37] and exalt the name of Jesus Christ. And
[1:09:40] and uh I I don't think that you can make
[1:09:43] our God too big, make him too mighty. I
[1:09:47] think that we should just make him
[1:09:49] bigger than any demonic power of hell.
[1:09:52] and and he's above cancer. He's above
[1:09:55] discouragement. He's above fear. He's
[1:09:58] above oppression. And I I believe that
[1:10:01] uh you may have come in a great battle
[1:10:04] and even a battle for your life. But I
[1:10:06] believe that you're going to leave here
[1:10:08] delivered. You're going to be here
[1:10:10] changed. You're going to be here better
[1:10:12] off. I believe that's that's the Lord
[1:10:15] that we serve. That's the God that we've
[1:10:17] been introduced to. [snorts] And uh so
[1:10:20] the message is not dead. The message is
[1:10:22] very much alive and well. And I just
[1:10:25] want to say this, I'll just say it like
[1:10:27] this. This message [music] is greater
[1:10:30] now than ever before. And I believe that
[1:10:33] we are preaching and believing the
[1:10:36] greatest message that has ever come upon
[1:10:39] this earth. I I'm not just saying that
[1:10:42] half-hearted. I believe that with
[1:10:44] everything within me. I believe that
[1:10:46] this is going to change our bodies. And
[1:10:49] uh I believe it so much that this could
[1:10:51] be our last service. I know we've been
[1:10:54] hearing that for years and years, but
[1:10:56] I'm just going to tell you, you're going
[1:10:58] to hear it for the last time one of
[1:11:00] these days. And uh it's the very thing
[1:11:03] that we're believing. It's it's it's
[1:11:06] going to change our bodies one of these
[1:11:07] days. So, amen. We we just uh appreciate
[1:11:11] uh Brother Ben for giving us the uh
[1:11:14] opportunity to be here. God [music]
[1:11:16] richly bless you and and uh he and his
[1:11:19] family and his church and the vision
[1:11:22] here and just everyone that is gathered
[1:11:24] and all the churches represented. We say
[1:11:26] God richly bless you. And uh so if you
[1:11:30] have your Bibles, we're going to uh turn
[1:11:34] to Luke the 18th chapter and we're going
[1:11:38] to read the first eight verses. And then
[1:11:42] we're going to read also Hebrews 6 and
[1:11:44] verse 12.
[1:12:06] &gt;&gt; [snorts]
[1:12:10] &gt;&gt; Luke 18 and beginning at verse one.
[1:12:18] And he spake a parable unto them to this
[1:12:21] end, that men ought always to pray and
[1:12:25] not to faint,
[1:12:28] saying, There was in a city a judge
[1:12:31] which feared not God, neither regarded
[1:12:34] man, and there was a widow in that city,
[1:12:38] and she came unto him, saying, "Avenge
[1:12:40] me of mine adversary."
[1:12:43] And he would not for a while. But
[1:12:45] afterward he said within himself,
[1:12:49] "Though I fear not God, nor regard men,
[1:12:52] yet because this widow troubleth me, I
[1:12:56] will avenge her, lest by her continual
[1:13:00] coming she weary me." And the Lord said,
[1:13:04] "Hear what the unjust judge saith, and
[1:13:08] shall not God avenge his own elect,
[1:13:12] which cry day and night unto him, though
[1:13:15] he bear long with them? I tell you that
[1:13:18] he will avenge them speedily.
[1:13:21] Nevertheless, when the Son of man
[1:13:23] cometh, shall he find faith on the
[1:13:27] earth." Now Hebrews 6 and verse 12, that
[1:13:31] ye be not slothful, but followers of
[1:13:35] them who through faith and patience
[1:13:39] inherit the promises. Now, let's just
[1:13:42] bow our hearts in a word of prayer. Why
[1:13:46] don't you just invite him and make him
[1:13:48] feel welcome as we begin this camp and
[1:13:53] just invite him to come right where you
[1:13:55] sit and just uh just make him feel so at
[1:13:59] home. Father, we love you. [snorts]
[1:14:03] &gt;&gt; And Lord, the songs have been sung, the
[1:14:06] atmosphere has been set. Lord uh
[1:14:10] everything has been done to uh just
[1:14:14] invite your presence and to make you
[1:14:16] feel welcome among us. Lord Jesus, we
[1:14:20] come with a great expectation.
[1:14:23] No doubt there's been many battles and
[1:14:26] Satan has tried to bring discouragement,
[1:14:29] distractions,
[1:14:30] but Lord Jesus, we have come nonetheless
[1:14:33] with a great expectation that you're
[1:14:36] going to meet our needs. And Lord, you
[1:14:39] come where you're invited.
[1:14:41] &gt;&gt; And oh God, all the preparations have
[1:14:44] been made and now our hearts are wide
[1:14:47] open saying, "Come, Lord Jesus. Have
[1:14:51] your way. Father, we ask that you would
[1:14:54] heal the sick and just encourage the
[1:14:57] discouraged." Lord, may every spirit
[1:15:01] that is not of your Holy Spirit flee
[1:15:03] this place, Lord. Oh God, let your
[1:15:07] people just enter into the joys of the
[1:15:10] Lord and the liberties of the Holy Ghost
[1:15:12] and just feed upon the good things of
[1:15:15] God. And oh Lord, may may we be
[1:15:19] completely changed from this time
[1:15:22] forward, oh God, better Christians,
[1:15:24] better fit to serve you, Father. Lord,
[1:15:27] we give ourselves over to you now in the
[1:15:30] name of Jesus Christ. Amen and amen. God
[1:15:35] richly bless you. You may be seated.
[1:15:38] Jesus said, "Nevertheless,
[1:15:42] when the son of man cometh, shall he
[1:15:44] find faith on the earth." And I would
[1:15:47] like to just take for a text, "Will I
[1:15:49] find faith?" And it's a simple subject
[1:15:54] on faith. I'm not uh I'm not a deep
[1:15:57] preacher. I'm not bringing anything new.
[1:16:00] Uh but I do love the message and uh I
[1:16:04] believe that the prophet of God said
[1:16:05] that if we will recognize his presence
[1:16:09] that he will release our desires that we
[1:16:12] have in him to us. And so we have uh
[1:16:17] some examples in the scripture such as
[1:16:21] like the woman with the issue of blood
[1:16:25] and how that she had this uh issue for
[1:16:28] 12 years and she had went to many
[1:16:31] doctors and spent all of her money and
[1:16:34] no one could help her. Uh but then she
[1:16:37] heard about Jesus Christ and how that uh
[1:16:42] the supernatural was being made manifest
[1:16:45] and how that uh different needs were
[1:16:48] being met. And then she heard that Jesus
[1:16:51] was to pass her way. And uh the the
[1:16:55] Bible says that something struck her
[1:16:58] heart that if I can only touch his
[1:17:01] garment. And the prophet says in the
[1:17:04] sermon, "The presence of God
[1:17:06] unrecognized
[1:17:07] when that genuine faith in God became a
[1:17:11] positive thing to her." What did it
[1:17:13] release? It released his power to heal
[1:17:17] her. It touched him in such a way he
[1:17:20] turned around and told her what was
[1:17:23] wrong with her and said, "Your faith has
[1:17:26] saved you." What did faith? Others
[1:17:29] standing there might have been sicker
[1:17:31] than she, but you see, she recognized
[1:17:35] his presence. She knowed that was her
[1:17:38] opportunity. If we could only do that
[1:17:41] tonight, people, if we could only
[1:17:43] realize that he is appearing to us in
[1:17:45] these meetings for one purpose, that's
[1:17:48] to release our desires we have in him to
[1:17:52] us. But we've got to recognize his
[1:17:55] presence. And now, how you recognize his
[1:17:58] presence is when the promised word for
[1:18:01] this age is made manifest. Not the
[1:18:05] promised word of Moses age or any of the
[1:18:07] other ages. the promise of the word for
[1:18:11] this age. Amen. The prophet of God would
[1:18:15] say that Jesus always goes where he is
[1:18:19] invited. He would give us another
[1:18:21] example of how that a Pharisee by the
[1:18:24] name of Simon invited Jesus to come to
[1:18:28] his feast. And it was really an
[1:18:30] invitation
[1:18:32] uh just to make fun of Jesus. They
[1:18:34] really didn't believe in Jesus. They
[1:18:36] didn't believe that he was a prophet.
[1:18:38] Didn't believe that he was Messiah. And
[1:18:41] uh they they they invited him just to
[1:18:44] prove that uh he was just an ordinary
[1:18:48] man. And what they were claiming he was.
[1:18:52] And uh they we know the story of how
[1:18:55] that uh they brought Jesus in the
[1:18:58] footwash flunky uh didn't wash his feet.
[1:19:02] They put him over in a corner with dirty
[1:19:05] feet and no one kissed him welcome and
[1:19:09] and uh he sat there kind of embarrassed.
[1:19:13] The the smell and the stench of the road
[1:19:16] and the sweat of the day uh was upon him
[1:19:20] and everyone else was having a good
[1:19:22] time. But then we find that there was uh
[1:19:25] a woman of ill fame, a prostitute that
[1:19:30] she she seen Jesus sitting in a corner
[1:19:34] with dirty feet and she must have got
[1:19:37] her her uh her her the money that she
[1:19:41] earned from her prostitution. and she
[1:19:43] went and got the best oils in this
[1:19:46] alabaster box and and then she snuck
[1:19:50] through the gate and somehow she come
[1:19:53] into the presence of Jesus and then in
[1:19:57] his presence my the floodgates opened up
[1:20:01] and the tears begin to come and she
[1:20:04] recognized that that this was the very
[1:20:08] person that could meet her need and And
[1:20:13] as the tears begin to come and and she
[1:20:16] begin to uh wash his feet with her tears
[1:20:20] and take her hair, which the hair of a
[1:20:24] woman is her glory. And she be to take
[1:20:28] her glory and begin to wash his feet
[1:20:31] with her tears and dry his feet with her
[1:20:34] hair. And my there was a hush all over
[1:20:37] the room as they begin to think and in
[1:20:40] their hearts I see look if this man
[1:20:44] really was a prophet she he would
[1:20:48] recognize who this woman really was and
[1:20:52] this is all this is just a prostitute.
[1:20:54] This is a sinner. But you see uh uh
[1:20:58] there was something supernatural that
[1:21:01] was taking everyone else was scorning.
[1:21:04] Everyone else was mocking and
[1:21:06] criticizing, but there was something
[1:21:08] supernatural that was taking place.
[1:21:12] Amen. And Jesus said, "I say unto her,
[1:21:17] her sins which are many are all
[1:21:20] forgiven. Go in peace." Amen. The
[1:21:24] prophet said, "What was it?" She
[1:21:26] recognized her opportunity.
[1:21:29] She did it. She did him a service. The
[1:21:33] Pharisees didn't do it. She saw it and
[1:21:36] she recognized his presence. And what
[1:21:39] did it do? It washed. Isn't that a
[1:21:43] beautiful thing? Amen. She recognized
[1:21:46] his presence. And what did it do? It
[1:21:49] washed. What did it release to her?
[1:21:52] Forgiveness. Released to her forgiveness
[1:21:55] of her sins. What did it also do? It
[1:21:59] also released the power of God to show
[1:22:02] to them unbelievers that he was a
[1:22:04] prophet. He knew who she was. It also
[1:22:08] released joy and power and eternal life.
[1:22:12] It released that. Amen. You see, the
[1:22:16] promised word of this age has released
[1:22:20] the power of God to bring healing and
[1:22:24] bring deliverance and to bring eternal
[1:22:26] life and to bring the joy and peace of
[1:22:30] God into human hearts. Amen. to
[1:22:33] recognize his presence, the vindicated
[1:22:37] word of the hour that Jesus Christ is
[1:22:41] not dead, but he is the same yesterday,
[1:22:45] today, and forever. Well, what could God
[1:22:49] do for for us in this meeting? Amen.
[1:22:52] What God? What could God do for young
[1:22:56] people that are needing a new birth? And
[1:22:58] Amen. adults needing a birth and needing
[1:23:02] refillings of the Holy Ghost and the
[1:23:04] sick can leave here completely delivered
[1:23:07] and set free. Amen. Delivered from all
[1:23:11] spirits of oppression. I tell you, you
[1:23:14] see the prophet would tell us, amen,
[1:23:17] that as Enoch built the pyramid and and
[1:23:21] and that pyramid stands for a symbol and
[1:23:25] he says shows us that there was seven
[1:23:28] steps in that pyramid that go that lead
[1:23:32] up to the king's chamber. And then he
[1:23:35] says that at the seventh step there is a
[1:23:38] there there is a little there is a
[1:23:41] little place there. Amen. That the
[1:23:44] messenger introduces the comer into the
[1:23:47] presence of the king. And he would say
[1:23:51] he would say where did the guard meet
[1:23:53] the challenge to bring the comer into
[1:23:56] the presence of the king? It was at the
[1:23:58] top of the steps was in the seventh
[1:24:02] step. There shows that we've got to come
[1:24:05] again with that same spirit that was on
[1:24:07] John. He introduced the Messiah. Amen.
[1:24:12] You see Malachi 45 and six, behold, I
[1:24:16] will send you Elijah before the great
[1:24:20] and terrible dreadful day of the Lord.
[1:24:23] And what is that spirit of Elijah to do?
[1:24:27] to introduce us to the coming or into
[1:24:31] the presence of almighty God, introduce
[1:24:35] us to the Messiah. The prophet of God
[1:24:38] would say that my mission I believe to
[1:24:42] the earth is to forrun the coming word.
[1:24:45] the coming word which is Christ and
[1:24:48] Christ in him has the millennium and has
[1:24:52] everything right there because he is the
[1:24:56] word again the prophet would say and
[1:24:59] we've got the Messiah this is him the
[1:25:04] word again the prophet would say amen in
[1:25:08] Jehovah Gyra part one and 64 he would
[1:25:11] say the last thing is his divine
[1:25:14] presence the word itself. He is the
[1:25:18] word, the head, the word. It's coming to
[1:25:23] the body. And then he would take us to
[1:25:25] Hebrews the 4th chapter and show us that
[1:25:28] the word of God is sharper and more
[1:25:32] powerful than a two-edged sword and a
[1:25:35] discerner of the thoughts and intents of
[1:25:37] the heart. And he's identifying that
[1:25:40] it's his own ministry that is
[1:25:43] introducing us to the presence of
[1:25:46] almighty God which is the word and is
[1:25:50] the Holy Ghost.
[1:25:52] Now the prophet of God again he would
[1:25:55] say you see it's known as the Messiah.
[1:26:00] Now it's not some man here is the
[1:26:02] Messiah. It's the Holy Spirit is the
[1:26:06] Messiah. Christ and the Holy Spirit is
[1:26:10] the same thing. So here it is here now
[1:26:13] just working in the flesh getting the
[1:26:16] body ready for the rapturing grace and
[1:26:19] then the prophet of God says believe it
[1:26:21] friends. Amen. You see we are living in
[1:26:26] the identified presence of God and we've
[1:26:29] got to believe it. Amen. to to to
[1:26:33] recognize that there is a special grace
[1:26:36] upon this age and that God has sent us a
[1:26:41] prophet to introduce us to the presence
[1:26:44] of almighty God. Amen. That this word
[1:26:48] that is vindicated among us in this age,
[1:26:51] it's more than just scriptures. It's
[1:26:54] more than just quotes. It's it's more
[1:26:56] than just memorizing Malachi 45 and 6.
[1:27:00] It's more than just remembering
[1:27:03] Revelations 10:7 and and Revelations,
[1:27:06] you know, uh, Revelations 3rd chapter
[1:27:09] and the Leodysian church age and all of
[1:27:12] these scriptures. Amen. It's more than
[1:27:14] just good scriptures, but this is the
[1:27:17] promise of the word for this age that
[1:27:20] has been made manifest that you can
[1:27:22] recognize the presence of God is here
[1:27:25] among us. Amen. And now you see it's a
[1:27:29] special grace that God has given the
[1:27:32] age. Amen. The Bible says that when the
[1:27:35] enemy comes in like a flood, the spirit
[1:27:39] of the Lord would raise a standard
[1:27:42] against him. You see, there's always a
[1:27:44] special anointing for the time for the
[1:27:48] season to combat the Antichrist. Ain't
[1:27:51] that right? Amen. We see that there's
[1:27:54] there's four horse riders. It's the
[1:27:57] Antichrist spirit that is riding
[1:28:00] throughout the seven church ages. But
[1:28:03] then we find that there is a power of
[1:28:06] the Holy Ghost or an anointing that goes
[1:28:10] out to meet that antichrist spirit. And
[1:28:14] the prophet of God will show, amen, that
[1:28:17] the overcomers of the age is the ones
[1:28:20] that come under the anointing that
[1:28:23] defeats the spirit of antichrist in
[1:28:26] every age. So we find that there was
[1:28:28] there was a there was an anointing which
[1:28:31] was a lion anointing. Amen. And that
[1:28:35] combed the antichrist spirit. And then
[1:28:38] we find that there was an ox anointing
[1:28:40] and then a a man anointing. But the last
[1:28:44] anointing in the last age is a flying
[1:28:48] eagle. Hallelujah. The other anointings
[1:28:51] were earthbound creatures. But in the
[1:28:54] last days, it's a flying eagle. It's not
[1:28:58] even just a setting eagle. It's an eagle
[1:29:01] that is in those heavenly places that
[1:29:04] has the strength to fly above every
[1:29:07] spirit that would try to defeat this
[1:29:10] bride. every spirit of gross darkness.
[1:29:13] Every spirit of delusion, uh, every
[1:29:15] spirit that would try to take you young
[1:29:18] people and destroy your life, uh, this
[1:29:21] message has brought an anointing upon
[1:29:24] our life. Uh, and we've got to recognize
[1:29:27] that it's Christ himself uh that has
[1:29:30] come among us. It's not a man's message.
[1:29:33] Uh, it was not William Brandham that was
[1:29:35] vindicated. It was God sending a prophet
[1:29:39] that he could use that vessel to
[1:29:42] identify that it's Jesus Christ the same
[1:29:46] yesterday, today, and forever that is
[1:29:49] here among us.
[1:29:51] &gt;&gt; Oh, praise the name of the Lord. Amen.
[1:29:54] You see, we're under that eagle
[1:29:56] anointing.
[1:29:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now the prophet of God was saying
[1:30:01] the fifth seal. He says he brings down
[1:30:04] the eagle to restore the children back
[1:30:07] to the original faith again of their
[1:30:10] fathers the eagle age. You see
[1:30:14] Revelations 10 1:7 in the fifth seal
[1:30:17] again all of the mysteries of God would
[1:30:21] be revealed the eagle. Hallelujah. Again
[1:30:26] the fifth seal. Don't forget this
[1:30:28] church. And you brethren on tape, I want
[1:30:31] you to examine this. How could men do
[1:30:35] anything else besides the power of God
[1:30:38] that had been released to them? Well,
[1:30:41] praise the name of the Lord. Amen. In
[1:30:44] the days of of that lion anointing, they
[1:30:47] were under Paul's message and they stood
[1:30:50] there under that that that boldness of
[1:30:54] that anointing and withtood that
[1:30:56] Antichrist spirit. Amen. Then the then
[1:31:00] that ox anointing, how could they give
[1:31:02] their lives? How could they run to the
[1:31:05] to the chopping block? How could they be
[1:31:08] burnt at the stake? It was because there
[1:31:10] was an anointing upon their lives. Well,
[1:31:13] we see what they did with the man
[1:31:15] anointing. It brought forth a
[1:31:17] reformation. Amen. It defied that that
[1:31:20] Roman Catholic spirit. Amen. But you
[1:31:23] see, we're under a different anointing.
[1:31:26] This is not an anointing to keep us upon
[1:31:29] the earth. Uh this is an anointing uh
[1:31:32] full of quickening power, full of
[1:31:34] dynamic Holy Ghost uh messianic power to
[1:31:39] get to not take us through the
[1:31:41] tribulation but to but to bring a
[1:31:43] revelation that we're covered by the
[1:31:47] blood of Jesus Christ. We're an
[1:31:49] invincible army and God is taking us in
[1:31:53] a rapture.
[1:31:57] &gt;&gt; Oh, don't forget this church.
[1:32:01] We're under a different anointing.
[1:32:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. You see, all of the scriptures
[1:32:07] that has been proved the vindication of
[1:32:10] his word and the presence and the hour
[1:32:13] that we're living is to anoint our
[1:32:16] faith.
[1:32:18] &gt;&gt; And Jesus never asked, "Will I find a
[1:32:21] good person?"
[1:32:23] &gt;&gt; Listen to me, young people.
[1:32:25] &gt;&gt; He never asked, "Will I find a righteous
[1:32:27] person? He never asked, "Will I find a
[1:32:30] good Christian?"
[1:32:32] &gt;&gt; He never asked, "Will I find a saint?"
[1:32:35] &gt;&gt; I'm actually quoting the prophet. He
[1:32:38] never asked, "Will I find respects?"
[1:32:41] He never asked, "Will I find a good
[1:32:42] tithe pair?"
[1:32:45] &gt;&gt; What he asked, "Will I find faith?"
[1:32:50] And the prophet of God interprets what
[1:32:53] Jesus was actually asking is, "Will I
[1:32:55] find someone that'll take me at my
[1:32:58] word?"
[1:33:00] &gt;&gt; Will I find someone that will stand
[1:33:03] there and say, "The word is right."
[1:33:06] &gt;&gt; When you're sick, you can stand there in
[1:33:08] divine presence and say, "I am the God
[1:33:11] that health all thy diseases." You can
[1:33:14] stand there when demons are trying to
[1:33:17] say you're going to lose your children
[1:33:19] and lift up that token and say, "I will
[1:33:22] not lose my children. I claim them for
[1:33:25] the glory of God." When I find a faith,
[1:33:29] when I find a revelation that is burning
[1:33:32] in the evening time, they're under that
[1:33:34] son of man anointing that says Jesus
[1:33:37] Christ in the power of his resurrection
[1:33:40] is moving among us.
[1:33:43] &gt;&gt; [screaming]
[1:33:44] &gt;&gt; Oh yes, sir.
[1:33:46] &gt;&gt; Now we know what Satan's after.
[1:33:49] &gt;&gt; He's after our faith.
[1:33:52] &gt;&gt; Satan has every trick in his bag to
[1:33:55] discourage this bride. Every scarecrow,
[1:33:59] every enticing spirit, every spirit of
[1:34:02] delusion to distract from the reality of
[1:34:06] this message. Amen. And he's trying to
[1:34:09] get this bride all locked up in fear.
[1:34:13] Trying to get this bride in unbelief.
[1:34:16] Get her get her all in spooks. Amen.
[1:34:19] Tied up with this and tied up with that
[1:34:22] and and spooks of to claim the promises
[1:34:25] of God for your life. Amen. Afraid to
[1:34:28] quote certain things and to to believe
[1:34:31] certain things. Amen. Because the devil
[1:34:34] points you to to some negative
[1:34:36] somewhere. Well, I just want to say,
[1:34:39] amen. From Genesis to Revelations, this
[1:34:41] Bible is an absolute. And I just want to
[1:34:45] say this message from 47 to 65, uh, it
[1:34:49] is the absolute of this Bible. It is the
[1:34:52] word made manifest. It is for your life.
[1:34:56] It's for your victory. It's for your
[1:34:59] deliverance. It's for your home.
[1:35:04] &gt;&gt; You can believe it.
[1:35:06] You can stand for it. You don't have to
[1:35:09] be ashamed of Christ. You don't have to
[1:35:12] be ashamed of his presence. For he's
[1:35:14] here and he's vindicated his presence
[1:35:17] among us.
[1:35:19] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:35:21] Satan's doing his best to paralyze our
[1:35:24] faith.
[1:35:26] &gt;&gt; Just like he got Lot to get his eyes on
[1:35:30] Sodom.
[1:35:32] &gt;&gt; Mrs. Lot
[1:35:34] wanted to dress like all the others, you
[1:35:36] know, and
[1:35:39] Lot
[1:35:40] become a a a judge, a leader, sitting at
[1:35:45] the gate, but the whole time it vexed
[1:35:48] his righteous soul.
[1:35:51] &gt;&gt; The whole time he was miserable
[1:35:54] and yet he couldn't do anything about it
[1:35:56] because his faith had become paralyzed.
[1:36:00] And the devil did that. Amen. But you
[1:36:03] see, the prophet of God showed us that
[1:36:06] there was another one and it was Moses.
[1:36:09] And Moses caught a vision of Christ and
[1:36:12] forsook the world, forsook Egypt,
[1:36:16] forsook the popularity.
[1:36:19] He forsook the throne. All because he
[1:36:22] looked to the promise.
[1:36:26] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And his faith paralyzed the
[1:36:30] world. And the prophet of God shows us
[1:36:32] either your faith will paralyze glamour
[1:36:35] or either the glamour will paralyze your
[1:36:38] faith. Oh, praise the name of the Lord.
[1:36:42] But the prophet of God showed us that
[1:36:44] when a man once catches that vision of
[1:36:47] the invisible God and know that he's
[1:36:50] always present, there is something that
[1:36:54] stabilizes that man's thinking. It
[1:36:57] stabilizes his actions. And in the time
[1:37:00] of distress and trouble, it'll still
[1:37:03] make him look upward and above the
[1:37:05] things that are happening around him
[1:37:07] because he's looking at the unseen yet
[1:37:11] by promise. Well, what did he promise
[1:37:14] us? He would be here.
[1:37:17] &gt;&gt; He said, "I will never leave you and I
[1:37:21] will never forsake you, but I'll be with
[1:37:24] you low until the end of the world."
[1:37:27] Then when you catch by the vindicated
[1:37:31] message of the hour, his presence is
[1:37:34] here. It'll bring stability to your
[1:37:37] life. It'll stabilize your home,
[1:37:41] stabilize your families. You see, it's
[1:37:44] all because Hebrews 11 and verse 1 and
[1:37:47] two, faith is the substance
[1:37:51] of things hoped for, the evidence of
[1:37:54] things not seen. For by it the elders
[1:37:59] obtained a good report. And we know that
[1:38:03] there in Isaiah it says, "Whoath
[1:38:05] believed a report? And to whom is the
[1:38:07] arm of the Lord revealed?" Now the
[1:38:10] prophet of God, he picked that up in the
[1:38:12] seals and says, "Believe the report and
[1:38:16] the power of God will be revealed to
[1:38:18] you." showing you that what was taking
[1:38:21] place at the opening of the word was the
[1:38:24] power of God being revealed.
[1:38:27] &gt;&gt; So believe the report and the power of
[1:38:30] God will be revealed in your [screaming]
[1:38:31] life.
[1:38:34] &gt;&gt; Everyone's trying to figure it out and
[1:38:36] they're missing the whole thing. Believe
[1:38:39] it and the power will come.
[1:38:42] &gt;&gt; Believe you're healed and the power to
[1:38:44] heal you is here.
[1:38:47] Believe you're going in a rapture. And
[1:38:49] the power to rapture [screaming] you is
[1:38:51] here.
[1:38:54] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You don't have to work it
[1:38:56] up. You don't have to sing it down. You
[1:39:00] don't have to. It It's here.
[1:39:05] &gt;&gt; I told you I'm a simple preacher, but I
[1:39:07] believe this.
[1:39:09] &gt;&gt; I believe the dynamics have come to the
[1:39:11] mechanics. And I believe everything this
[1:39:14] bride has been needing for a victorious
[1:39:16] overcoming life is here.
[1:39:20] &gt;&gt; All things are possible.
[1:39:23] &gt;&gt; To them that believe.
[1:39:26] &gt;&gt; Without faith it is impossible to please
[1:39:29] God. But with faith it unlocks heaven.
[1:39:35] &gt;&gt; It unlocks every promise of God. Now the
[1:39:39] prophet of God would actually let us
[1:39:41] know that God has to have believers.
[1:39:45] It it he can't work through anything but
[1:39:48] faith.
[1:39:50] So he predestinated believers to meet
[1:39:53] that word in every age to meet the
[1:39:57] challenge of the age. Now, brother
[1:39:59] Brandham would say now he he said that
[1:40:03] and then he says now he's got to
[1:40:05] predestinate this thing to be there to
[1:40:07] meet the challenge of the age. Did it
[1:40:08] get you? Did you feel it? Did you see
[1:40:12] it? Do do you understand it? That's
[1:40:14] what's happening today. He predestinated
[1:40:17] it to this by his fornowledge when he
[1:40:20] predestinated in Malachi 4. It's got to
[1:40:24] happen. So what did he predestinate in
[1:40:26] Malachi 4? that the hearts of the
[1:40:29] children would be turned back to the
[1:40:32] original faith.
[1:40:35] &gt;&gt; So when Jesus was asking the question,
[1:40:38] will I find faith? He knew that Malachi
[1:40:41] 4 had already been written and that in
[1:40:45] the season of the last days when the son
[1:40:48] of man would be revealed, Malachi 4
[1:40:52] would come into effect to turn our faith
[1:40:54] back to the original.
[1:40:58] So Jesus wasn't saying there, I sure
[1:41:01] hope we got some faith. I sure hope when
[1:41:03] the son of man is revealed that we're
[1:41:05] going to have this kind of persistent
[1:41:07] faith. Jesus knew exactly what he was
[1:41:10] saying, but he was identifying the kind
[1:41:13] of faith that he was going to be turning
[1:41:15] back to the original fathers. It's going
[1:41:17] to be a faith that knows God and the
[1:41:19] power of his resurrection. It's going to
[1:41:21] be a faith that can hold on to the
[1:41:24] promise and call those things that be
[1:41:26] not. as though they already are. It's
[1:41:28] going to be a royal seed faith that when
[1:41:31] you're down, but there's a power to get
[1:41:34] you back up.
[1:41:37] The devil looks like he's destroyed you
[1:41:40] and destroy your home, but there is a
[1:41:43] resurrection power that is within you
[1:41:46] that says, "You can try to destroy me.
[1:41:49] You can try to destroy my home,
[1:41:51] [screaming] but I'll raise it up."
[1:41:54] Nothing can defeat this bride.
[1:42:01] &gt;&gt; Oh my. When he predestinated in Malachi
[1:42:04] 4, it's got to happen. When he come over
[1:42:06] and predestinates anything to happen in
[1:42:08] his word, he had to prove his word to be
[1:42:10] so. Are you ready for it? When he
[1:42:13] predestinates anything to happen and
[1:42:16] says that it'll happen, he knows that
[1:42:19] seed will be there just at that time. He
[1:42:22] predestinated a bride. She's going to be
[1:42:25] there. Going to be a rapture. She's
[1:42:29] going to be there.
[1:42:31] &gt;&gt; He predestinates it by his fornowledge.
[1:42:35] There's nothing going to stop it.
[1:42:39] &gt;&gt; No wonder the prophet could look at you
[1:42:41] and say, "You're an invisible army."
[1:42:44] When you discern the two spirits within
[1:42:46] the framework of the church that Satan
[1:42:48] is trying to make this bride lukewarm
[1:42:51] and powerless, but yet you discern that
[1:42:54] spirit and you see what Satan's trying
[1:42:56] to do and you refuse to knock down for
[1:42:58] the devil because you recognize the
[1:43:01] presence of almighty God is among us.
[1:43:04] Then you are an invincible army.
[1:43:06] [screaming]
[1:43:09] &gt;&gt; Nothing can withstand you.
[1:43:14] Praise the name of the Lord
[1:43:16] &gt;&gt; because you're predestinated.
[1:43:22] &gt;&gt; You see the woman at the well,
[1:43:27] the prophet of God says that when Jesus
[1:43:32] said, "I have needs to go by Samaria."
[1:43:36] Can I can I can I just say it a little
[1:43:38] bit the way that I see it? You can take
[1:43:42] it. Take it or leave it. But let let me
[1:43:45] just put it like this. Jesus had been
[1:43:48] called Beelzeub.
[1:43:51] &gt;&gt; He had been called
[1:43:54] uh you know the son of a drunken
[1:43:57] soldier.
[1:44:00] He'd been called all kinds of names by
[1:44:02] those religious spirits.
[1:44:06] &gt;&gt; And I let me just say like this. Jesus
[1:44:09] must have just got fed up with it.
[1:44:13] &gt;&gt; I'm going to their church and they're
[1:44:14] kicking me out.
[1:44:16] &gt;&gt; I go tell them this day this scriptur is
[1:44:18] fulfilled and they try to throw me over
[1:44:19] the hill.
[1:44:22] &gt;&gt; They're always against the vindicated
[1:44:24] word made manifest.
[1:44:27] And then the day come he says, "I just
[1:44:29] need to go by Samaria."
[1:44:32] &gt;&gt; You know what he's going to do? He's
[1:44:34] going to go find some faith.
[1:44:37] He's going to go by He's going to go by
[1:44:40] Samaria and there's going to be a
[1:44:42] prostitute who's been married five times
[1:44:45] and the one she's with is not even her
[1:44:47] husband and she's an outcast from all
[1:44:50] the other systems.
[1:44:52] &gt;&gt; No one else wants to be identified with
[1:44:54] her. Amen. But yet Jesus says, "I need
[1:44:58] to go by Samaria because I need to find
[1:45:01] some faith."
[1:45:03] And when he begins to discern her heart,
[1:45:06] she says, "You're the Messiah. You're
[1:45:08] the one that we've been hearing about."
[1:45:11] And she identified his presence. You
[1:45:14] know what did for her? The old
[1:45:16] scripture. Now, this is what the prophet
[1:45:18] of God says. The old scripture with the
[1:45:21] experience that Jesus was giving her
[1:45:24] made the real Messiah.
[1:45:27] And she recognized him. and she dropped
[1:45:30] her old water pot. She dropped her old
[1:45:34] her old religious thinking and she ran
[1:45:38] back into that very city and said, "Come
[1:45:39] and see a man who told me everything
[1:45:41] I've done. Is not this the Messiah?"
[1:45:45] Well, I I just want to say, Amen. People
[1:45:47] are trying to say that, you know,
[1:45:49] Brother Brandham is gone and the message
[1:45:51] is dead and and and and God's not a
[1:45:53] discerner anymore. Well, let me just
[1:45:54] tell you this. Amen. The prophet went to
[1:45:58] his reward. But that same Holy Ghost,
[1:46:02] that same Messiah, that same logos, the
[1:46:06] word is still riding this trail. He's
[1:46:09] still discerning your heart. He knows
[1:46:12] what you're going through. He knows your
[1:46:14] symptoms. He knows your situations. And
[1:46:17] he's here letting you know that I'm here
[1:46:20] to do the exceedingly abundantly above.
[1:46:23] all that you could even ask
[1:46:27] &gt;&gt; or even imagine.
[1:46:29] You see, it's the same word. It's the
[1:46:31] same Christ that the prophet introduced
[1:46:34] us to. And what is it? It's all of those
[1:46:38] prophecies,
[1:46:41] all of those scriptures that have been
[1:46:43] laying there,
[1:46:45] all of those things saying what he would
[1:46:47] be in this last days with the new
[1:46:50] experience that God has given you, even
[1:46:53] in this camp,
[1:46:55] &gt;&gt; letting you know that he's passing by
[1:46:58] your way.
[1:47:00] &gt;&gt; And all he's looking for is not your
[1:47:03] credentials.
[1:47:04] He's not looking for how much you know.
[1:47:08] He's not looking for you to be able to
[1:47:10] quote and quote after quote after quote
[1:47:12] or scripture after scripture after
[1:47:14] scripture. What he's looking for is
[1:47:17] someone to identify his presence and
[1:47:19] reach out and touch him.
[1:47:22] &gt;&gt; Will I find that kind of persistence?
[1:47:25] They hear my voice. They recognize it's
[1:47:28] me. And they reach out and get a hold of
[1:47:31] my promise. Amen.
[1:47:33] &gt;&gt; That's what God's looking for.
[1:47:36] &gt;&gt; That's what we've been turned back to.
[1:47:38] Amen. You see, we've got the Messiah.
[1:47:41] [sighs]
[1:47:42] It's just waiting for somebody with
[1:47:44] faith to anoint it and make it live
[1:47:47] again.
[1:47:49] &gt;&gt; Why? You mean to tell me that every
[1:47:53] promise is laying here just as good as
[1:47:57] they always have been, but they're
[1:47:59] laying here in seed form. But if that
[1:48:02] seed can fall into your heart and you
[1:48:05] would begin to anoint that promise with
[1:48:07] faith, with praise and worship, and say,
[1:48:10] "I believe it, Lord. I believe you're
[1:48:13] the same yesterday, today, and forever
[1:48:16] is the Messiah." And he becomes alive in
[1:48:19] your life.
[1:48:23] &gt;&gt; You see, faith comes by the word.
[1:48:27] Now, now how many how many remembers the
[1:48:30] prophet of God says this is the word
[1:48:32] age.
[1:48:34] &gt;&gt; Actually, the prophet would say this is
[1:48:35] his age, God's age, the word age. So,
[1:48:41] we've got to lay out a sea age, which is
[1:48:44] lukewarm.
[1:48:46] &gt;&gt; They've kicked Christ out of the church.
[1:48:49] They don't want any anything to do with
[1:48:51] the power of God in demonstration. They
[1:48:54] don't believe for those things. And
[1:48:56] that's what has kept the people of God
[1:48:59] living a million miles below their
[1:49:01] God-given privileges.
[1:49:03] &gt;&gt; Preachers under that denominational
[1:49:06] influence telling the people that God
[1:49:09] can't and God can't and God can't and
[1:49:11] God can't.
[1:49:15] But then God says, "Well, I'm going to
[1:49:17] just separate myself from that that age,
[1:49:20] and I'm going to go ahead and make my
[1:49:22] own age. It's going to be the word age."
[1:49:26] &gt;&gt; And that's why the prophet of God says
[1:49:28] it's actually an eagle age.
[1:49:31] &gt;&gt; And then I'm going to identify this
[1:49:33] bride and say it's her age. It's going
[1:49:35] to be the bride age. And he's letting
[1:49:37] you know that this is where the Messiah
[1:49:40] is. Because Leoa kicked him out. They
[1:49:45] kicked his presence out of their camps.
[1:49:47] They kicked him out of their
[1:49:48] denominations. But there's a bride that
[1:49:51] has suffered with him outside the gates.
[1:49:56] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:49:58] &gt;&gt; And they've come into a personal
[1:50:00] relationship with God
[1:50:03] &gt;&gt; in his age. Amen.
[1:50:06] &gt;&gt; Now in this word age, faith comes by
[1:50:09] hearing, hearing the word.
[1:50:12] &gt;&gt; And this is what makes you do things so
[1:50:14] foolish the to the world.
[1:50:18] &gt;&gt; You know what kind of foolishness?
[1:50:19] What's what's foolish to the world? It's
[1:50:21] believing that God can fill you with the
[1:50:23] Holy Ghost.
[1:50:25] &gt;&gt; To actually turn in your Bible and
[1:50:28] believe that everything he did in this
[1:50:30] Bible, he's manifesting in your life.
[1:50:33] And to the rest of the world, you become
[1:50:35] a nut. You become an oddball. You just
[1:50:38] be, you've lost your mind. Well, let me
[1:50:41] just go ahead and help the world out. I
[1:50:43] have lost my mind.
[1:50:46] And it's good riddance. I didn't like my
[1:50:48] mind anyways.
[1:50:51] It was my mind that was always reasoning
[1:50:54] against the promise. But we have entered
[1:50:56] into his mind
[1:50:58] in his age where the word is bringing
[1:51:02] faith and faith is touching a hold of
[1:51:05] the word and it's bringing the promises
[1:51:07] of God into manifestation.
[1:51:11] &gt;&gt; Now, now you're going to be called a lot
[1:51:15] of crazy names, but let's just let's
[1:51:17] just look at what the Bible calls you.
[1:51:21] Saints.
[1:51:23] You see, the Bible actually calls you
[1:51:27] the called out ones.
[1:51:30] &gt;&gt; You see, called out, separated from all
[1:51:33] unbelief.
[1:51:35] &gt;&gt; Now, the word himself, which was Jesus
[1:51:39] Christ in the beginning, John 1 and one,
[1:51:41] in the beginning was the word, the word
[1:51:42] was with God, the word was God, and the
[1:51:44] word was made flesh and dwelt among us.
[1:51:47] It's the word himself that begin the
[1:51:51] faith.
[1:51:53] Pet Paul didn't start the faith. Peter
[1:51:56] didn't start the faith. It was the son
[1:51:59] of man. The word made flesh that started
[1:52:03] the faith. So we're not just restored
[1:52:06] back to just a certain faith, but we're
[1:52:10] resto restored back to the original the
[1:52:14] faith which is the son of man.
[1:52:17] So in the last days, Jesus said right
[1:52:21] before we read uh there there in Luke
[1:52:23] the 18th chapter, he said, "Hey, as it
[1:52:26] was in the days of Noah, so shall it be
[1:52:28] in the revealing of the son of man."
[1:52:30] What was Jesus doing? He was prophesying
[1:52:33] him a place in the last days that the
[1:52:37] word would be made flesh again and the
[1:52:40] word would restore us back to the
[1:52:43] original the faith.
[1:52:47] And there would be a group of people
[1:52:50] that would recognize that this is the
[1:52:51] same Jesus Christ.
[1:52:54] And you're called out and separated from
[1:52:57] all unbelief to tie yourself to the word
[1:53:02] to believe in all things.
[1:53:06] Now
[1:53:08] &gt;&gt; this and we again this is not just a
[1:53:12] certain man-made faith but this is a
[1:53:15] super faith.
[1:53:17] Th this far supersedes anything that any
[1:53:22] system can create. This is actually the
[1:53:25] faith of God that if you say unto this
[1:53:29] mountain be thou removed and cast into
[1:53:31] the sea. If you have the faith of God,
[1:53:36] you speak the word and it'll take place.
[1:53:41] &gt;&gt; Now, so this is a mountain moving faith.
[1:53:45] This is a creative faith. This is the
[1:53:48] faith of God that can operate the power
[1:53:50] of God.
[1:53:52] &gt;&gt; You see, there's thousands of voices
[1:53:54] vying for the influence of your life.
[1:53:58] But then there's a vindicated voice.
[1:54:01] a vindicated voice
[1:54:04] that my sheep hear my voice out of all
[1:54:07] the other thousands of influences. And
[1:54:10] the prophet says those voices deadens
[1:54:12] the voice of the supernatural,
[1:54:15] but my sheep hear my voice and another
[1:54:20] they will not follow. That's why Jesus
[1:54:22] said, "I will come to you and I'm going
[1:54:24] to be your guide because I'm going to be
[1:54:26] the voice over my church."
[1:54:30] You see, the prophet of God would say
[1:54:31] the end time message should meet end
[1:54:33] time conditions. Where they've got off,
[1:54:36] the message ought to bring it back. It's
[1:54:39] a call back to the original word. And
[1:54:44] the prophet of God would show us that
[1:54:45] there is actually uninspired leadership
[1:54:48] that are actually taking the word of God
[1:54:51] and explaining it away and saying that
[1:54:53] God can't do that. But you see, the
[1:54:56] prophet of God says this message is
[1:54:59] going to meet the challenge of that
[1:55:01] uninspired leadership
[1:55:03] &gt;&gt; where they got off where they where
[1:55:06] where they put a crutch on our faith.
[1:55:09] But the vindicated message of the hour
[1:55:12] will fix the thing and will bring us
[1:55:15] from uninspired to inspired leadership
[1:55:19] that we are following the leadership of
[1:55:21] the Holy Ghost. Where does the Holy
[1:55:24] Ghost take us? To the word.
[1:55:28] &gt;&gt; It anoints our hearts to believe the
[1:55:31] word.
[1:55:33] So where they kept us a million miles
[1:55:35] below our God-given privileges, but the
[1:55:38] message of the hour has told us believe
[1:55:41] for all things. Take the limits off of
[1:55:44] your faith. As much faith you can
[1:55:47] release is how much power you can have.
[1:55:52] So, you know what it is? You just keep
[1:55:54] believing.
[1:55:56] &gt;&gt; Keep believing.
[1:55:58] &gt;&gt; Keep believing. That's why the prophet
[1:56:00] of God says, "I am God's voice to you."
[1:56:03] He said, "Now, I I was going to
[1:56:04] apologize for it, but then he come back
[1:56:06] again and said, I am God's voice to
[1:56:08] you." What was he doing? He was letting
[1:56:10] you know that you can believe this
[1:56:11] message.
[1:56:13] Well, praise the name of the Lord. Amen.
[1:56:15] The same could be said of Moses in that
[1:56:16] Exodus. The same could be said of Paul
[1:56:19] when when he says, "Though though we or
[1:56:21] an angel from heaven say anything than
[1:56:24] what has already been spoke, let him be
[1:56:25] accursed." Amen. What is he doing? It
[1:56:28] was the same pillar of fire that
[1:56:30] vindicated Moses message, vindicated
[1:56:33] Paul's message, and it's come in the
[1:56:35] last days to vindicate that we've got
[1:56:38] the correct interpretation of scripture.
[1:56:43] &gt;&gt; So, you don't have to add to it. You
[1:56:44] don't have to take away from it. You
[1:56:46] just simply take the message of the hour
[1:56:50] as sheep food.
[1:56:53] And at that day, you shall know that I'm
[1:56:56] not in a group, but I'm in an individual
[1:56:57] individual and I'll be in the believer.
[1:57:01] And I don't care if you're a
[1:57:02] six-year-old or a 10year-old or a
[1:57:04] 20-year-old or a hundred year old. I'm
[1:57:06] looking for faith.
[1:57:09] And at that day you will know, the
[1:57:11] individual is going to know that the
[1:57:13] father is in me and I in you and you and
[1:57:16] me and there is a oneness together. You
[1:57:20] know what this is going to be? It's
[1:57:21] going to be a prevailing revelation.
[1:57:24] The message of the hour that is
[1:57:26] anointing your faith and faith is a
[1:57:29] revelation and it's anointing you for
[1:57:32] victory. Amen.
[1:57:35] &gt;&gt; For faith is the victory that overcomes
[1:57:39] the world.
[1:57:42] &gt;&gt; You know, I and I'm just I'm I'm going
[1:57:44] to wind it down,
[1:57:47] but let me just say it like this. The
[1:57:49] prophet of God in the sermon, he that is
[1:57:52] in you,
[1:57:53] he actually is going to for the first
[1:57:56] time, he's going to tell us how that
[1:57:57] there was a a storm that was spoken out
[1:58:01] of existence.
[1:58:02] Y'all remember that in the sermon, he
[1:58:04] that is in you. And then he actually be
[1:58:07] to walk with God
[1:58:08] &gt;&gt; because God says, why don't you walk
[1:58:10] with me?
[1:58:12] &gt;&gt; And then we find him how that he stepped
[1:58:14] in another dimension and in and every
[1:58:17] principle he become a young man and seen
[1:58:19] his wife and she was a young young
[1:58:22] woman. Y'all y'all remember that?
[1:58:24] &gt;&gt; Now the prophet of God begins to let us
[1:58:27] know it's he that is in you.
[1:58:32] He that is in you is greater than he
[1:58:36] that is in the world.
[1:58:39] &gt;&gt; And he begins to show you that this
[1:58:41] world belongs to the devil.
[1:58:45] &gt;&gt; But yet it's Christ who has redeemed
[1:58:48] your dirt.
[1:58:50] &gt;&gt; And Christ has stepped into a boy, into
[1:58:54] a girl, into a housewife, into a farmer,
[1:58:57] into a mechanic. Amen.
[1:59:01] &gt;&gt; He that has redeemed you and he that
[1:59:05] abides in you is greater than the
[1:59:08] spirits that is trying to conquer you.
[1:59:12] &gt;&gt; Will I find that kind of a faith to put
[1:59:16] their shoulders back and say greater is
[1:59:18] he that is in me than he that is in the
[1:59:21] world. This is the victory. This is the
[1:59:23] prevailing revelation that overcomes the
[1:59:27] world.
[1:59:28] Remember gross darkness, but in the
[1:59:31] evening time there shall be light. Light
[1:59:35] is the word made manifest. And the
[1:59:38] prophet of God says, "Ye are the light
[1:59:39] of the world." You are the word made
[1:59:42] manifest. Will I find faith that can
[1:59:46] realize who you are and set and stand up
[1:59:49] toe-to-toe with the devil and say,
[1:59:51] "Greater is he that is in me than he
[1:59:54] that is in this world."
[1:59:57] He now he take us to Daniel the lions.
[1:59:59] Then he says now those lions would be
[2:00:01] tame.
[2:00:03] They would be calm. But it's the devil
[2:00:05] that God influenced those lines.
[2:00:08] &gt;&gt; But we find out that greater is he that
[2:00:10] was in Daniel than he the devil that was
[2:00:13] in those lines.
[2:00:16] &gt;&gt; He says in the millennium the lion will
[2:00:19] will will will eat grass like the ox.
[2:00:22] You see there won't be any devil to
[2:00:24] hinder it. Then he shows us that it was
[2:00:27] the devil that got into that fiery
[2:00:28] furnace. It was the devil that put put a
[2:00:31] sting there that to conquer the to
[2:00:33] destroy God's children. But you see,
[2:00:35] greater is he that was in the Hebrew
[2:00:37] boys than he that was in that fiery
[2:00:39] furnace,
[2:00:42] church, what are you going through?
[2:00:45] What faith has been restored to us in
[2:00:47] this hour that we can we can tow the
[2:00:49] line with the devil and say, "Satan,
[2:00:51] you're not taking my children. You're
[2:00:54] not taking my health. You're not taking
[2:00:56] my mind. I refuse this weary spirit that
[2:00:59] is trying to make me a weak Christian
[2:01:01] and trying to tell me that I don't got
[2:01:03] what it takes.
[2:01:06] &gt;&gt; I tell you, we're in the greatest battle
[2:01:08] ever fought.
[2:01:09] &gt;&gt; And it's all because God has given us a
[2:01:12] revelation of who we are. And we're
[2:01:14] stepping into our position as sons and
[2:01:17] daughters of God. Just as those stars in
[2:01:19] the heavens are in their place, these
[2:01:22] stars, sons and daughters of God, are
[2:01:25] stepping into their place by the message
[2:01:27] of the hour and saying, "Satan, get out
[2:01:30] of here."
[2:01:33] &gt;&gt; You see, the prophet of God would say,
[2:01:35] "Now, will I find that kind of a faith
[2:01:38] &gt;&gt; like that woman who was a widow?" And we
[2:01:42] could we could we could take parallels
[2:01:44] here. How you know widow her husband's
[2:01:48] dead. Let's just put it like you and I.
[2:01:50] That old denominational system, that old
[2:01:53] thing that ruled you, it's dead.
[2:01:57] And she realized [gasps]
[2:01:59] that the one who could give her her need
[2:02:04] was that unjust judge.
[2:02:06] Now, the Bible clearly says he's unjust,
[2:02:10] but yet she he's the one that can help
[2:02:12] her in her situation.
[2:02:15] &gt;&gt; So, she comes boldly
[2:02:17] before his door
[2:02:21] and begins to knock. Now, he's already
[2:02:24] in bed and he don't want to deal with
[2:02:27] this woman.
[2:02:29] So, he's just trying to ignore her,
[2:02:32] but she doesn't just knock three times
[2:02:35] and then say, "Well, I guess I'm just
[2:02:37] not going to get my answer." And then
[2:02:39] just goes back home disappointed.
[2:02:42] She realizes
[2:02:45] he's the one that can that can that can
[2:02:50] redeem the situation.
[2:02:56] &gt;&gt; Now, let's imagine you're trying to
[2:02:58] sleep.
[2:03:00] and you've got someone outside your
[2:03:03] door. And I don't care if you don't want
[2:03:05] to deal with that person.
[2:03:11] Now, that person who's got the need
[2:03:13] doesn't m they don't care how annoying
[2:03:15] they sound.
[2:03:19] &gt;&gt; They don't care how odd they look.
[2:03:22] &gt;&gt; The passer by is saying, "Well, look at
[2:03:24] her. What a strange sight. She's the one
[2:03:26] with the need.
[2:03:28] She's the one that's desperate.
[2:03:30] &gt;&gt; So, she's the one that's going to be
[2:03:32] persistent.
[2:03:35] &gt;&gt; And finally, that unjust judge comes
[2:03:37] out, says because she's going to weary
[2:03:40] me.
[2:03:42] &gt;&gt; I can't get her off of my hands.
[2:03:44] &gt;&gt; So, she he goes and gives her her
[2:03:47] heart's desire all because she's
[2:03:50] persistent.
[2:03:52] But notice that faith,
[2:03:55] &gt;&gt; the faith that is in her, though he's
[2:03:57] unjust,
[2:03:59] but she recognizes that he's the one
[2:04:02] that can give the answer.
[2:04:06] &gt;&gt; That's where Jesus said, will I kind
[2:04:09] find find that kind of faith that can
[2:04:11] recognize there's my answer and then
[2:04:15] stick with it.
[2:04:17] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. Will I kind will I find
[2:04:20] that kind of faith that says I am on
[2:04:23] your hands. Now I'm quoting the prophet
[2:04:27] says you've got to get tired. You you
[2:04:29] get tired of listening. Now now he's
[2:04:32] actually saying this how how a believer
[2:04:34] has got to talk to God.
[2:04:37] &gt;&gt; He says you get tired of listening.
[2:04:40] I'm having a great time knocking
[2:04:45] &gt;&gt; cuz I know you're coming.
[2:04:49] That's when something happens. He has to
[2:04:52] get you off his hands. So, he comes uh
[2:04:56] he comes to answer you. How faith finds
[2:05:00] this.
[2:05:03] &gt;&gt; The prophet of God says that's how you
[2:05:04] got to be. God, I'm on your hands.
[2:05:08] &gt;&gt; Throughout this whole meeting,
[2:05:09] &gt;&gt; when brother John is preaching in the
[2:05:11] morning, you got to come with the
[2:05:12] mentality, Lord, I'm on your hands.
[2:05:16] the evening service. I'm on your hands,
[2:05:19] God. I'm persistent, God. I'm a
[2:05:21] believer, God. I I have been taught by a
[2:05:25] vindicated word that your presence is
[2:05:27] here. I recognize you're real. I
[2:05:29] recognize you're here. And I have come
[2:05:31] with an expectation. There's something
[2:05:33] that's burning in my heart. And I take
[2:05:35] no for an answer, God. I'm on your
[2:05:38] hands.
[2:05:40] And he'll show up. [screaming]
[2:05:43] He promised to meet your needs according
[2:05:46] to his riches and glory.
[2:05:50] &gt;&gt; There's no need to have habits hanging
[2:05:53] on your life.
[2:05:54] &gt;&gt; There's no need to have some
[2:05:57] generational curse binding you. And the
[2:06:00] devil's saying, "Well, that's just the
[2:06:01] way it was in it's in your family line."
[2:06:03] That's a that's nonsense. The blood of
[2:06:06] Jesus Christ has dealt with every
[2:06:09] generational curse.
[2:06:12] I say come with an expectation to see
[2:06:15] the supernatural make manifest in your
[2:06:17] life. Uh just like we heard about the
[2:06:19] young people that said we want to see a
[2:06:21] supernatural God. Amen. And you put that
[2:06:24] you just put a line in the sand and said
[2:06:26] we're going to see God this this camp or
[2:06:28] else. And God showed up. You got to get
[2:06:31] desperate with God. If you're sick, get
[2:06:34] desperate with God. Mamas, if you need a
[2:06:37] need for your home, get desperate with
[2:06:39] God. But don't don't you got to come
[2:06:41] with faith now and you got to come
[2:06:43] [screaming] to do war.
[2:06:47] &gt;&gt; Say I believe the promise of God.
[2:06:50] &gt;&gt; It's my dominion.
[2:06:52] &gt;&gt; This is my dominion and the strength.
[2:06:56] This message is the strength to rise you
[2:06:58] above every situation.
[2:07:00] &gt;&gt; Every trial, every spirit of oppression.
[2:07:04] When your heart says yes to the promise
[2:07:06] and yes to the yes to every word, then
[2:07:09] you step into your inheritance and say,
[2:07:12] "I believe the promise of God."
[2:07:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let the musicians come.
[2:07:18] &gt;&gt; Oh, praise the name of the Lord. We know
[2:07:20] this by heart. For the prophet of God
[2:07:23] says, "The son of man is Christ.
[2:07:25] &gt;&gt; He is the one you're feeding on." You're
[2:07:28] not feeding on a man. A man his words
[2:07:31] will fail, but you're feeding on the
[2:07:34] unfailing body word of the son of man.
[2:07:37] &gt;&gt; When the son of man comes, will he find
[2:07:40] faith? And I say yes.
[2:07:43] I say yes.
[2:07:45] &gt;&gt; Amen. Who will agree with me?
[2:07:48] &gt;&gt; Yes, he'll find faith because I'm here.
[2:07:51] I'm predestinated to believe. I'm
[2:07:54] predestinated to get answers. I'm
[2:07:56] predestinated to see this word made
[2:07:58] manifest in my life. Hallelujah. If
[2:08:02] there's only one going to get anything
[2:08:03] out of this camp, it's me.
[2:08:07] &gt;&gt; I I I'm just being honest with you. I
[2:08:09] didn't come all the way from Ohio,
[2:08:11] United States, just to come here. I come
[2:08:13] here to get a blessing from God. I come
[2:08:16] here to pre to preach a a gospel to a
[2:08:19] predestinated group of people that can
[2:08:21] grab a hold of the promise of God and
[2:08:24] see God made manifest.
[2:08:27] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I believe we're going to see
[2:08:30] testimony upon testimony, miracle,
[2:08:32] healing, deliverance. It's because it's
[2:08:35] what he promised.
[2:08:37] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:08:38] &gt;&gt; And he said, "If I be lifted up, I'll
[2:08:40] draw all men unto me." And this message
[2:08:43] is what we're waving over your life.
[2:08:48] &gt;&gt; Oh, you hear the prophet of God say,
[2:08:50] "When you recognize this message is
[2:08:53] eagle food, you've heard from your
[2:08:55] theophony." [music]
[2:08:58] &gt;&gt; Well, praise the name of the Lord.
[2:09:00] &gt;&gt; Your theophony
[2:09:02] telling you just go ahead and keep
[2:09:04] eating.
[2:09:06] &gt;&gt; Just go ahead. That's what I'm needing.
[2:09:08] Just go ahead. Keep eating. Keep eating
[2:09:10] that eagle food. Hallelujah. It's got
[2:09:13] the nourishment. It's got the vitamins.
[2:09:15] It's got the power.
[2:09:17] Not under the influence of of a man.
[2:09:19] We're not in under the influence of a
[2:09:21] certain certain group. We're under the
[2:09:24] influence of the Holy Ghost, under the
[2:09:27] influence of the power of the word. I
[2:09:30] tell you, amen. It's calling. Come up
[2:09:33] higher.
[2:09:36] Believe me, for every promise.
[2:09:38] Praise the name of the Lord. Hallelujah.
[2:09:41] Go ahead, Russ.
[2:09:48] You are here. You are here.
[2:09:58] I worship you.
[2:10:01] I worship you.
[2:10:05] You are here in
[2:10:08] reveal.
[2:10:11] You don't have to put it off for the
[2:10:12] second service.
[2:10:15] The Lord Jesus is [music] here right
[2:10:17] now.
[2:10:20] Maybe you've come with a situation and
[2:10:22] there's something [music] burning in
[2:10:23] your heart that you want to be free for
[2:10:25] the rest of this this meeting. Why?
[2:10:27] [music]
[2:10:28] Why don't you just be free?
[2:10:31] Why don't you just reach out [music] and
[2:10:33] touch God?
[2:10:35] Cuz he's walking by.
[2:10:38] He's walking by your [music] seat.

[2:17:07] something
[2:17:09] you won't prefer [music]
[2:17:25] [music]
[2:17:26] [singing]
[2:17:33] [music]
[2:17:36] I know who I am.
[2:17:40] I know [music] where I [singing]
[2:17:42] stand.

[2:20:58] Oh Jesus, you [music] save
[2:21:03] through you. I'm forgiven.
[2:21:07] You conquered the grave.
[2:21:10] And I'm here for my blessing. [music]
[2:21:15] I'm here for my joy.
[2:21:19] No more depression.
[2:21:23] It's time to rejoice.
[2:21:28] I have authority
[2:21:31] and I'm coming for what's [music] my
[2:21:36] I know what I give.
[2:21:40] [music]
[2:21:41] I'm here for [singing]
[2:21:47] [music] some of
[2:21:53] you [music]
[2:21:57] on the rock of revelation.
[2:22:00] my faithful

[2:22:05] and all that stands before me will all
[2:22:10] end up [music] behind me. I'm claiming

[2:23:30] [music]
[2:23:32] [applause]
[2:23:33] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Amen. That's
[2:23:36] just fact. I know who I am. God told me
[2:23:40] who I am. I didn't invent who I am. He
[2:23:42] told me by a vindicated word. Amen. He
[2:23:44] says, "You looking for faith?" Here I
[2:23:46] am.
[2:23:47] &gt;&gt; Amen. God put something in me to believe
[2:23:49] his word. Amen. Not just to memorize it,
[2:23:51] but it'll be manifested in our lives.
[2:23:53] Hallelujah. So, we're here. Like, when I
[2:23:56] sing that song, I'm not begging the
[2:23:57] devil to get out of my way. Says, "Get
[2:23:59] out of my way." You know what David told
[2:24:01] Goliath? David told Goliath, "Your
[2:24:04] future, your head's going to be
[2:24:05] separated from your shoulders." I mean,
[2:24:07] that was God speaking through David and
[2:24:09] he told him his future. I mean, stop
[2:24:11] telling the devil. Stop letting the
[2:24:13] devil tell you your future. You start
[2:24:14] telling the enemy his future. Amen.
[2:24:16] Satan, every promise of God is mine. I'm
[2:24:19] a son or daughter of God. It's mine
[2:24:21] today. Amen. Why? Cuz God is among us
[2:24:24] here to release that desire into our
[2:24:25] lives.

[2:31:15] rise in every heart, dear God. Just to
[2:31:17] take you at your word, Lord. To take you
[2:31:20] at your word, my God. That's all we need

[2:31:47] and different things. Dear God, may you
[2:31:49] go with us, Lord. We love you, dear God.
[2:31:51] And Father, may just continue to build
[2:31:53] an expectation. May we realize, Lord,
[2:31:56] you can touch us at any moment, Lord. We
[2:31:57] don't need to wait till the last service

[2:32:02] in our dorm. Lord, you can touch us
[2:32:04] anywhere, my God. So, Lord, we love you.
