[0:20] [Music]
[0:55] God bless you saints. Welcome to the
[0:57] house of the Lord. Let's just stand this
[0:59] evening as we open in a word of prayer.
[1:02] [Music]
[1:05] Thank you, Lord, for this wonderful day
[1:07] you've given us, Lord, half the week,
[1:10] Lord Jesus. Lord, knowing that you were
[1:11] with us, Lord Jesus. And Lord, I just
[1:13] pray and say thank you that we were all
[1:15] able to make it tonight, Lord Jesus, and
[1:17] to hear from you once again, Lord. And
[1:19] Lord, I pray that as we've come, Lord,
[1:22] expected, Lord Jesus, I pray that you
[1:24] speak to our hearts, Lord Jesus. You
[1:25] know every one of our needs, Lord Jesus.
[1:28] Prayer requests that are spoken or
[1:30] unspoken, Lord Jesus. And you have the
[1:32] answers for them, Lord Jesus. And Lord,
[1:34] I just pray that as the musicians play
[1:37] this evening as well, Lord Jesus, may
[1:38] you play through them, Lord. May your
[1:40] atmosphere just come down mightily this
[1:42] evening, Lord Jesus. May you move
[1:44] amongst your people this evening, Lord.
[1:46] And Lord, I pray that you be with those
[1:47] that couldn't make it or that are sick
[1:49] and body, Lord. Pray you be their
[1:51] portion and be with them. I pray in
[1:52] Jesus name. Amen.
[2:00] Let's start with the verse.
[2:03] Oh, there's a light in the window, a
[2:07] table spread as splendor, and someone
[2:11] standing by the open door.
[2:16] And I can't see a crystal river. So I
[2:20] must be near forever.
[2:23] But I've never been this homesick
[2:27] before.
[2:29] I see the bright light shine. It's just
[2:34] about home.
[2:37] And I can't see my father standing at
[2:41] the door.
[2:43] And this world has been worthless.

[3:03] faces all familiar.

[3:24] before.

[3:39] the door.
[3:41] And this world has been wild.
[3:45] And I'm ready for deliverance.

[4:17] given me his promise. And I've never
[4:21] been this home sick before.

[4:45] And I'm ready for deliverance.

[16:45] There's no greater love than this.
[16:53] You have overcome the grave. Your glory
[16:58] fills the highest place. What could
[17:02] separate me now? At the cross,
[17:09] at the cross I bow my
[17:13] way where your blood was shed for me.
[17:17] There's no greater love than this.
[17:22] [Music]
[17:25] You have overcome the grave. Your glory
[17:31] fills the highest place. What could

[19:46] glory fills the highest place. What can
[19:51] separate me now?
[19:57] Amen. What can separate us now from the
[20:01] love of God?
[20:04] Tore himself apart just for us. Amen.
[20:08] By doing that, he gave the devil one
[20:12] really good punch.
[20:14] And we're just evidence of that. We
[20:16] stand here day to day fighting every day
[20:20] because we believe.
[20:22] We're not doubters. We're believers.
[20:25] Welcome to the house of the Lord. May
[20:27] tonight you be blessed. May he live.
[20:30] See, I I like to see the I am. I like to
[20:34] see the living God coming and stepping
[20:36] forth and taking the book and opening
[20:38] up. That's why we come here. We want to
[20:41] see God in action. I don't want to hear
[20:43] about his coming. I know he's coming. I
[20:45] don't want to hear about what he done in
[20:46] the past. I know he's done it all. I
[20:48] want to see him work today. I want to
[20:51] see the I am that pillar of fire. I want
[20:53] to see what brother Brandham
[20:54] experienced. I want to I want to feel
[20:56] every little bit of this gospel every
[20:58] time I come here. That's my expectation.
[21:01] Amen. I believe that the Lord is here.
[21:05] Amen. It says in Psalm 19 and 13, it
[21:09] says, "Let the words of my mouth and the
[21:11] meditation of my heart be acceptable in
[21:14] the sight, oh Lord, my strength and my
[21:16] redeemer."
[21:18] May what comes out of these lips tonight
[21:20] give glory to God. And may it encourage
[21:22] us to step just a little bit closer to
[21:24] the Lord and him with us. I pray you'll
[21:27] get blessed tonight. It's not me
[21:29] preaching. It's not just brother Alante.
[21:31] I'm always excited talking about the
[21:32] Lord, but it's him and he wants to
[21:36] minister unto us tonight. So let's just
[21:37] bow our heads. Lord Jesus,
[21:41] we can open up our Bible and we can read
[21:44] every scripture in there, Lord, but if
[21:46] you don't make it real, Father, what do
[21:49] we have? Lord, if we have love for one
[21:52] another, Lord, and deep respect for one
[21:55] another, Lord, you would come in behind
[21:57] that and you can have preeminence in
[21:59] this service tonight, Lord, the sick
[22:02] will be healed, Lord. Lord, the ones
[22:04] that has afflicted and and been
[22:06] tormented so long, Lord, with
[22:08] strongholds that the devil might have
[22:09] put up in their lives, Lord, that could
[22:11] be released tonight. Miracles can
[22:13] happen, my father. I believe it, Lord.
[22:16] We've got Sister Christina at home
[22:17] recovering, Lord. all of us in one
[22:20] accord. No. And is feeling her pain,
[22:23] Lord. Even if we were not even in the
[22:25] car with her, Lord. Lord, we've got
[22:27] people that's sick at home, not feeling
[22:29] good tonight. Brothers and sisters that
[22:31] we love so much, Lord. People that can
[22:33] maybe not make it here because of a
[22:35] financial strain that would really want
[22:37] to be here, but it's just not fitting
[22:40] for them or they have to work maybe,
[22:41] Lord. We understand those things,
[22:43] Father. And our heart burns for those
[22:45] people, Lord, because I know that they
[22:47] would love this atmosphere. They would
[22:49] love you being in in and being in your
[22:52] presence, Father. So, Lord, I pray you
[22:54] bless those people, Lord. Everyone that
[22:57] is streaming, Lord, may you go out and
[22:59] just sit next to them on the couch and
[23:01] minister unto them, Lord. Knock on their
[23:03] door. Say, "Hey, I'm here to come and
[23:05] suck with you tonight. I come to your
[23:07] house tonight to have dinner or to to to
[23:11] take the feted cough and and have some
[23:13] food and and we the carcasses the eagles
[23:16] gather. We know Lord we ask that you'll
[23:18] be with our pastor brother Ben. You know
[23:20] he's still there overseas and he's
[23:22] preparing to come back home. We miss him
[23:24] dearly. We know that it's been a well a
[23:27] pretty much tumultuous could you say
[23:30] exercise here in Wellington and him
[23:32] being so far away from his wife. Lord, I
[23:34] know his heart would be really wanting
[23:36] to be here, but he's at his post of
[23:38] duty. Father, you bless that man, Lord.
[23:40] You bless Brother Ben. Keep him safe,
[23:43] Lord. And when he comes back, Lord, may
[23:45] you just find everything in order. We
[23:47] pray thee, Lord. Take this service, have
[23:49] preeminence, Lord. Thank you for the
[23:51] gifts, the musicians, the deacons, Lord,
[23:53] the office bearers, the the sound techs,
[23:56] Lord. Everybody here makes this possible
[23:58] for you to come down, Lord. May you just
[24:00] bless them richly. We pray in the name
[24:03] of our Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. And
[24:06] amen.
[24:07] Amen. It's Wednesday. God bless you.
[24:10] Thank you musicians. I will not say
[24:12] anything else cuz I might get you to sit
[24:14] down. Then our opening scripture we're
[24:16] going to find in Exodus 34. And they who
[24:20] have Bibles, you can grab your sword out
[24:22] now and just have it. I just want to
[24:25] talk a little bit. I'm It's more a
[24:27] preing tonight, so it's not a full
[24:28] service. Kids say, "Yay!"
[24:32] Because sometimes it's just late at
[24:34] night and we all know they I didn't have
[24:36] pictures up. Brother Isaac's got all the
[24:38] pictures. He took pretty much all the
[24:40] pictures you could find on the internet
[24:41] for Sunday service. So, man, that guy.
[24:44] Hey.
[24:47] Okay. And no, I'm not nervous. I'm
[24:49] actually very excited because the Lord
[24:51] has been dealing in my life really good.
[24:53] And then when he teaches you something,
[24:55] you need to share. So tonight it's for
[24:57] it's what I experienced and I'm just
[24:59] going to tell you about it. How's that
[25:01] sound? So don't think it's me telling
[25:03] you anything or telling you how to do
[25:05] anything. This is the law dealing with
[25:07] me. I've seen it and I just want to
[25:08] share it with you guys. Okay? So shields
[25:11] down. Okay? Only when we fight the
[25:13] enemy, we put the shields up. When
[25:15] brothers stand next to you, put your
[25:16] shield down. You go, "God bless you,
[25:17] brother. God bless you, sister." Okay?
[25:19] You don't knock him with a shield first.
[25:20] Okay? So verse 5 says, "And the Lord
[25:23] descend in the cloud." so glad that the
[25:25] Lord descended in the cloud in our day.
[25:28] And he stood with him there and
[25:31] proclaimed the name of the Lord. And the
[25:33] Lord passed before him and proclaimed
[25:36] the Lord, the Lord God, merciful and
[25:39] gracious, long-suffering and abundant in
[25:43] goodness and truth. May the Lord bless
[25:46] the reading of his word. You may be
[25:48] seated.
[25:51] I want to talk a little bit about
[25:53] wrestling with God. Is it okay to
[25:56] wrestle with God? You know, we know
[25:58] always read about Jacob wrestling with
[26:00] God and and you know, certain believers
[26:02] having prayer requests before God, but
[26:04] but what does it really mean to wrestle
[26:06] with God? And and what would happen if
[26:08] we do wrestle with God? you know, um
[26:11] there's many of things we think that God
[26:14] is is I'm not going to jump ahead, but
[26:16] God is just such a big God that
[26:19] sometimes we can't approach him because
[26:21] of various reasons.
[26:23] You know, maybe unconfessed sin or or
[26:25] things that's between us and the Lord.
[26:27] There's that song that says nothing
[26:28] between my Lord and my Savior. And you
[26:30] kind of think that because there's a a
[26:32] something there that you can't approach
[26:34] God. But that's not true. That's a lie
[26:36] of the devil. We're going to we're going
[26:38] to take that devil. We're going to break
[26:40] his back and stomp on him three times,
[26:42] four times, five times because remember,
[26:44] we're not just going to do three arrows,
[26:46] we're going to do the whole lot. We want
[26:47] to obliterate our enemy.
[26:50] So depending on our understanding of
[26:52] God, we think that that the answer to
[26:55] this question, can you wrestle with God?
[26:57] That God is lofty, he's powerful, he's
[26:59] almighty, he's unreachable.
[27:03] We think that we think that because God
[27:04] is such a big big God, we can't approach
[27:07] him. We also think that if we do come
[27:09] before God and we start talking to God
[27:11] and maybe we want to wrestle with him
[27:13] because remember there's a difference
[27:14] between and I always say this fighting
[27:17] trying to hurt someone and inflict pain
[27:19] and actually grabbing someone and
[27:21] wrestling it's a strength test. It's
[27:23] it's to find out the weakness of your
[27:25] opponent. So if you see wrestlers
[27:27] wrestlers don't try to break the guy. He
[27:29] will grab and lock onto another opponent
[27:31] and they will start feeling each other
[27:33] and and what is going on cuz I'm looking
[27:35] for a weak spot. And when I find a weak
[27:38] spot, then I know that I can move in and
[27:39] I can pin that person, you know. So it's
[27:42] not to hurt him, but is to get him down
[27:44] on the ground. So when we fighting,
[27:46] fight is what we do against the enemy.
[27:48] We don't do it against brothers and
[27:50] sisters. We actually do that against the
[27:51] enemy. You know, the the prince of
[27:53] darkness and all his demons. We fight
[27:55] against them. We wrestle not against
[27:57] them. We fight against them. But we
[27:59] wrestle one another. Iron sharpens iron.
[28:01] And so it is with us and God as well.
[28:04] When you have something that comes up,
[28:06] you can lock arms with God and you can
[28:08] start wrestling for your blessing like
[28:10] Jacob did. You can actually get in
[28:12] contact so intimate, so close with God
[28:15] that when he touch you, you'll walk
[28:16] different. He wants that. He wants that.
[28:20] He wants you to get so close to him that
[28:22] when you two are starting to wrestle and
[28:24] he's saying, "But I know you've got more
[28:26] in you." And he's trying to testify
[28:28] that's what's lying within you. He's
[28:30] testing your strength and you're
[28:32] pulling. But sometimes you push back and
[28:34] say, "Lord, but how far more?" And he
[28:36] goes, "But I want you to go a little bit
[28:37] further." So it's always a a battle
[28:40] between us and God. But it's for your
[28:42] benefit. It is actually for your
[28:44] strengthening because everything when
[28:46] you wrestle God that happens gives you
[28:48] strength to overcome the enemy. Because
[28:51] remember when we're wrestling, we're
[28:53] training. But we're training for what?
[28:55] To go out and fight. So, he's going to
[28:58] give you certain circumstances, circum
[29:00] temptations, certain um frustrations.
[29:04] Everybody's got them. You know,
[29:05] sometimes the guy right next to you is a
[29:07] frustration and that's your your husband
[29:09] or your wife. But that can happen that
[29:12] there's something in them that just
[29:13] grinds you and you can't know why
[29:15] because there's something placed within
[29:17] you that God wants to deal with, but
[29:19] he's going to start wrestling with you.
[29:21] He's going to he's going to bring it out
[29:23] because he wants to find your weakness
[29:25] because he wants to strengthen you. Now,
[29:27] I'm jumping a little bit ahead, but so
[29:30] God describes himself as compassionate,
[29:33] gracious, and slow to anger. So, when we
[29:36] lock arms with God, he doesn't get angry
[29:38] and just push you down and and oblivate
[29:41] you. That's not his purpose. He's
[29:44] gracious. So when he comes in and he
[29:45] locks arms with you, this fight might
[29:48] for you seem really hard and you want
[29:49] against this almighty God. But what he
[29:51] wants you to do is he wants you to get
[29:53] in contact. He wants you to get close
[29:55] and personal. But the only way he can do
[29:58] it is he going to send you some trials.
[30:00] Hey, brother Isaac.
[30:03] Oh, wait. Let me get this off. I think
[30:05] we're going to wrestle tonight. I feel
[30:07] restricted.
[30:09] So
[30:10] the word wrestle it implies it's a
[30:13] struggle to be physical or to match one
[30:17] another and an opponent in battle. He
[30:19] says but it's also a struggle mentally.
[30:22] Have you ever thought about it? Cuz
[30:25] you're constantly thinking what is the
[30:26] other guy doing? Feeling wondering
[30:29] thinking. So so here's our struggle. Why
[30:32] has God put me in this this scenario
[30:35] this trial? Why has he put brother
[30:38] Armont in our church that always pushes
[30:40] that button? You know, why why is there
[30:43] And it is you might get a character.
[30:46] Hello, Fish. Good to see you, brother
[30:47] Fish. God bless you. The that he'll put
[30:51] a a character in there and you can't
[30:52] understand why. There's something that's
[30:56] just grinding you. That's God. He's
[30:59] placed that person there for a reason.
[31:01] Because the fact that it's in here and
[31:03] is grinding you means there's something
[31:04] that needs work.
[31:07] You don't know it yet. You just have the
[31:09] manifestation of of the subconscious
[31:11] like brother Andy preached that's inside
[31:13] you going on. You can feel it. You can
[31:15] It's bubbling sometimes. It's bubbling
[31:17] really hard, but it is in there. And
[31:20] God, I don't want that in there. I want
[31:23] that out. So, he's going to wrestle with
[31:26] you. He says, "Emotional struggles touch
[31:29] us really deep. Things that happened in
[31:31] our past that really cut us deep and we
[31:34] just took a lot of sand." And sister
[31:35] London and I, we have spoken about it
[31:37] this week, but we just cover it with the
[31:39] sand. And it might have happened way
[31:41] back in our life, but it's still there.
[31:43] It's still buried. God wants that. We
[31:46] can't move on with things in our life
[31:48] that has not been dealt with. Because
[31:50] what happens is what brother Andy said,
[31:52] and I love that subconscious series. He
[31:54] says, "Your mind brings that so quickly
[31:56] back that your your your conscious can't
[32:00] catch up with it, and it just runs. And
[32:02] you might say or do something out of
[32:04] order because of the past hurts in your
[32:07] life. And it's real. We all do it. I
[32:10] mean, if if if you all just think about
[32:12] it, you know, if you burned your hand on
[32:15] the plate, I promise you when there's a
[32:17] hot plate and you feel before you even
[32:19] put your hand on the plate, you feel the
[32:20] heat resonating from that plate.
[32:22] Automatically your hand goes, "That's
[32:24] hot." But if you never touch that plate,
[32:28] you'll go, "Oh, that's hot."
[32:31] But you ever touched a hot plate? Ask
[32:34] Malachi. He touched the fireplace. Would
[32:36] that boy ever go back to a fireplace?
[32:38] It's no ways. Cuz he knows that that
[32:41] burns. But it's it's trauma. It's event
[32:43] that was anchored within him. So his
[32:45] subconscious just goes, "Hot, don't
[32:47] touch." I remember Chantel, I was doing
[32:50] ironing. Believe it or not, I can do
[32:52] that. And I was doing ironing and she
[32:54] had her hand on the ironing board. And
[32:57] as I came with the iron, I wasn't even
[32:59] 30 cm away from her. She just went I
[33:02] said to her, "You got burned by iron one
[33:04] day." She says, "No, I can't remember
[33:06] that." I said, "I'm telling you, the
[33:08] fact that your subconscious did that so
[33:10] quickly, someone burned you with an
[33:12] iron." She asked him on, she goes,
[33:14] "Yeah, when you were little, you got
[33:16] burned with an iron." But she reacted so
[33:19] quickly. Now, here here's the thing.
[33:21] Deep inside of you, there's a hurt. deep
[33:25] inside of you, there's something that's
[33:26] not been dealt with and God and you
[33:29] react either towards a brother or sister
[33:31] or towards God or towards a situation in
[33:34] such a way that God will place you in
[33:37] that situation to start realizing this
[33:39] is why you're acting the same way. How
[33:42] many have been around the mountain? You
[33:43] go, I've been around this mountain. I've
[33:45] been around this mountain. I've been
[33:46] around this mountain. Why can't I get my
[33:48] mountain? I want to be like Caleb. I
[33:50] want my mountain. And God goes, "I'm
[33:51] going to bring you up cuz you're not
[33:52] learning." Because within this mountain
[33:55] where you're coming again, the reason
[33:56] I'm bringing you again is somewhere
[33:58] you're not learning. I got something for
[34:02] you. And this is where the believer has
[34:04] to stop. So far off my notes, but I just
[34:06] want to say this. This is where a
[34:07] believer stops and goes, "Lord, you got
[34:10] my attention.
[34:12] You got my attention." And then the only
[34:15] way to start dealing with this thing is
[34:17] get back in fellowship with God. I'm not
[34:19] saying that you're out of fellowship,
[34:21] but that means seeking him deeper. Going
[34:23] into that prayer closet, actually
[34:25] starting to go into your word and say,
[34:26] "Show me in here. What is my trial?"
[34:30] I remember when I started working for
[34:31] brother Andy and them, they their
[34:33] businesses, it's amazing how these
[34:35] brothers run their businesses. It's on
[34:37] the word of God. They wait for a word of
[34:40] God to be manifested and be shown to
[34:43] them in the scriptures and then they
[34:45] move. Am I wrong?
[34:48] They will only move when they see that
[34:50] confirmation. And it could look like
[34:52] they're going to completely go the wrong
[34:53] way. They're waiting for that scripture
[34:56] to be revealed before they move on.
[34:57] Exodus 14:14. I was I was a witness to
[35:00] it.
[35:03] So remember,
[35:05] God is omniscient. So he knows
[35:07] everything. He's omnipotent. He's
[35:09] powerful. He is He is a God Almighty. He
[35:13] can deal with everything. He can deal
[35:15] with it. But you're going to wrestle
[35:17] with him.
[35:19] He's so strong, yet he won't break you.
[35:23] I I'll go on with it.
[35:28] So, especially in special and and
[35:30] stressful times and conversations and
[35:33] our prayers with him, it gets intense.
[35:35] You know, sometimes we've got demands.
[35:38] Sometimes we need an answer on a
[35:40] question. Sometimes we need a resolution
[35:43] to something. There's always a need for
[35:45] us. We're a needy people. And the reason
[35:48] God does this is because God wants, like
[35:51] brother Isaac said and like brother Mos
[35:53] said and brother Ed said, he wants to
[35:55] show his attributes.
[35:57] He want to show you that he can do it.
[36:02] But now let's say
[36:05] I've prayed and I said to the Lord to so
[36:09] you know at the moment there's a lots
[36:11] going on and I said to the Lord give me
[36:13] an answer on a specific thing and I'll
[36:16] give you example should I work where
[36:18] should I work what should I do it's a
[36:20] real thing
[36:23] and for two months I don't get any
[36:24] answers
[36:27] and then for three months I don't get
[36:28] any answers
[36:30] And I start thinking, what's wrong,
[36:33] Lord?
[36:35] No, because this is human. What have I
[36:36] done? No, he's busy with me. He says, I
[36:41] want you to get quiet. Then my son comes
[36:43] up and he preaches still small voice.
[36:46] And I'm thinking, oh, he goes, yeah,
[36:48] you're not getting still enough. So, you
[36:50] want to hear me speak, but you're not
[36:53] getting still enough. And for me to get
[36:56] still is a big thing. So, I love
[36:58] talking. And he goes, "But Arant, I'm
[37:01] going to bring you to a a place where I
[37:03] want to get you so quiet
[37:05] that I can start working with you and
[37:07] dealing with you, but I want you out of
[37:10] the way."
[37:12] But see, I didn't know what God was
[37:14] going to bring onto my way. But praise
[37:17] the Lord. So what he did in the book of
[37:19] Isaiah in 57-15 says, "For thus saith
[37:22] the one who was high and lifted up, who
[37:25] inhabits eternity with his holy name, I
[37:29] dwell in the high and holy place and
[37:31] also with him who was of a contrite and
[37:34] lowly spirit to revive the spirit of the
[37:39] lowly and to revive the heart of the
[37:41] contrary." So the contrite means to be
[37:44] broken into powder
[37:47] to be assayed like brother Ben said. So
[37:50] he says remember I'm the God that
[37:52] inhabits the whole of heaven
[37:55] and under the earth and the earth and
[37:57] everything I I that's me. All of this is
[38:00] me. He says but I dwell with people
[38:03] that's of a contrite spirit
[38:06] that is broken. And my purpose for this
[38:09] and this is the scripture that I got. My
[38:11] purpose is to deliver them that are
[38:13] humble, to deliver them that is is is
[38:17] contrite, to deliver them that is
[38:19] broken. That's my purpose. I'm the God
[38:22] that cares.
[38:24] I see when you're going to the point I
[38:26] see where you get to a point where you
[38:28] can't anymore. I know that. I'm waiting
[38:30] for you there.
[38:33] And we start fighting with God and we
[38:35] start arguing with God. Don't worry, he
[38:37] won't throw you away. He's patient.
[38:40] So talk to God. You know, I'm I'm
[38:43] walking around and in my best English, I
[38:46] can't unbelieve it. I used to speak to
[38:48] God in Africans. Now I was speaking to
[38:49] God speak to God in English. You know,
[38:51] it's just But I would walk and I would
[38:53] just say, "Lord, what are you doing?
[38:55] Like what are you doing? I I just can't
[38:57] see it. Look, I'm a babe. You said you
[39:00] come to me, but I just can't see it."
[39:02] And he goes, "We're going to wrestle
[39:04] some more. We we're going to wrestle
[39:06] some more. There's something there that
[39:08] you're not seeing. And the reason that
[39:09] you're here again is because I need to
[39:11] fix that. I, not me. I.
[39:16] So, you start yielding. You start
[39:18] surrendering. You start praying. You
[39:20] start communing with God. You read your
[39:22] word. You get more into it. You say,
[39:23] "Lord, it must be in here."
[39:27] Cuz if I don't see it in here, I have no
[39:29] idea where I'm going. Amen.
[39:32] God dwells in those that are humble.
[39:35] And if we're all his children, that
[39:37] means many other places we are reminded
[39:40] that God is willing to meet us in our
[39:42] weakness.
[39:44] He wants to meet you there.
[39:46] He says God,
[39:51] okay?
[39:53] God came and he died for you. Why? Just
[39:57] to take your sins away.
[40:00] Don't you think he was hungry? Don't you
[40:02] think he was rejected? Don't you think
[40:05] that the very people like Thomas that
[40:07] looked at him and say, "If I don't even
[40:08] touch, if I don't put my hands in that
[40:11] side, I wouldn't believe." Do you not
[40:12] think that would have hurt him? Do you
[40:14] not think that that when he was walking
[40:16] through Jerusalem and he looked at all
[40:18] the people rejecting him that he doesn't
[40:20] know rejection or hunger or pain?
[40:24] So, he knows that and he knows us. But
[40:28] he wants to come to your level and say,
[40:29] "When you get to that point, I must be
[40:32] your first point of contact. seek me.
[40:35] Young men, young sisters, but we don't
[40:38] have young sisters, many here, but young
[40:39] men, I want to talk to you.
[40:42] When you're looking for God, don't look
[40:45] when it's too late. Start seeking him
[40:48] earlier. Because remember, I'm going to
[40:50] tell you something. Your trials are many
[40:52] and they're right in front of you. All
[40:54] our old folks has has fought a couple of
[40:56] battles. But when all seems a little bit
[40:59] hard,
[41:01] your default setting as a young man
[41:03] should get back on your knees and say,
[41:06] "Lord, what have I done? How can I get
[41:08] out of here?" Cuz he's standing right
[41:10] next to you waiting for you cuz the
[41:12] reason you got that trial, the reason
[41:13] you got into that mess is somewhere you
[41:16] stepped off.
[41:18] Okay, now I'm going to I'm going to
[41:19] bring my point across.
[41:22] One John and one Ed, we always had this
[41:24] one in South Africa.
[41:29] But I went to it and I said 1 John 1
[41:31] vers9. Okay. But I wanted to start a
[41:34] little bit back by verse four. And you
[41:36] can put that up. Um Tally, I'll wait for
[41:38] you to put it up. 1 John 1. And we're
[41:42] going to go to verse four. He says, "And
[41:44] these things I write unto you that your
[41:45] joy might be full. And this is the
[41:48] message which I have heard of him and
[41:51] declare unto you that God is light and
[41:54] in him is no darkness.
[41:56] So now remember God's saying and we were
[41:58] talking recently with God. I'm not
[42:00] losing the plot. Just give me a sec. He
[42:02] says God is light and in him is no
[42:05] darkness.
[42:08] So when we dwelling in sin,
[42:12] can we really wrestle with God?
[42:15] When we when we rolling in it and we
[42:18] just don't want to repent and we happy
[42:20] with the state we're in, do you think
[42:22] God will listen to you wrestling?
[42:24] because there's a there's an approach to
[42:26] God. He says, "I come to a humble and a
[42:28] contrite spirit."
[42:30] So, when we're in a place where we're
[42:32] walking in darkness, I'm telling you
[42:34] now, God knows you're there, but he
[42:36] ain't going to listen to you.
[42:38] Because remember, God is sovereign.
[42:41] Listen to what I say. God is sovereign.
[42:44] He might listen to your mom and dad
[42:45] that's praying for you or the brother or
[42:47] the sister or whoever's in, but when
[42:49] you're rolling in darkness and you're
[42:51] enjoying it, he will not wrestle with
[42:53] you.
[42:55] because he he dw darkness does not dwell
[42:59] with him.
[43:01] So you can't be in a state of complete
[43:03] sin and then start demanding from God to
[43:07] help you to understand stuff. That's not
[43:09] your place. That's not being humble.
[43:11] That's just being arrogant. So let's get
[43:14] it right. If you know you're sinning and
[43:16] you know you're doing something wrong,
[43:18] you need to strike that off first
[43:20] because that's what's between you and
[43:22] your savior.
[43:24] cuz God ain't going to going to come let
[43:26] a filthy devil come into his chamber
[43:28] between you and him and try to have a
[43:29] discussion with both of you. We need to
[43:31] get that thing sorted. And that was what
[43:34] happened with me. There was something
[43:35] that was holding me back from entering
[43:38] into the holiest of holies. I was saved.
[43:42] You guys think this is serious. I was
[43:44] saved. But there was something why God
[43:47] wasn't speaking to me. And I went down
[43:50] and I started looking for that cuz I'll
[43:53] rather have that devil's head off and
[43:54] walk on with my Lord than have anything
[43:56] between me and God. This is very
[43:59] serious. We can go to the next verse. He
[44:02] says, "If we say we have fellowship with
[44:04] him and we walk in darkness, we lie."
[44:08] So if you are busy with sin and you're
[44:11] doing things wrong, this is from
[44:12] backbiting to backsliding to to arguing
[44:16] to fornication to anything that is not
[44:19] in the presence of God, right? And you
[44:21] think you're having fellowship with him.
[44:23] You're lying to yourself. You believe
[44:26] that devil.
[44:27] Because remember, God is pure and holy.
[44:32] So we need to cut these things out.
[44:36] I'm not fighting with you. This is me.
[44:37] Remember this is my testimony. So I'm
[44:40] just giving you the scriptures that was
[44:41] given to me while we went through this.
[44:42] I thought hey if I going to testify let
[44:45] me testify for his glory because at the
[44:47] end of this I got released
[44:51] from a lot of stuff and I and I got to
[44:54] enter into the holiest of holies the
[44:56] shikina where where God really speaks to
[44:58] you and say just hang on I got this and
[45:00] the same trial just turns around and
[45:02] it's just now a blessing. Hold on it
[45:04] gets better.
[45:06] He says, "And do not the truth. But if
[45:09] we walk in the light as he is in the
[45:11] light, we have fellowship one with
[45:12] another. And the blood of Jesus Christ,
[45:14] his son, cleanses us from all sin." So
[45:17] if we say we have no sin, we deceive
[45:20] ourselves and the truth of him is not in
[45:22] us. Just hold it there.
[45:26] Now here comes brother Arman. And I hit
[45:28] this brick wall and it's like a old sian
[45:32] wall. It's thick,
[45:34] man. and I hit this wall and I'm like,
[45:36] "Lord, why am I here again?" So, cuz
[45:38] remember the the the thing about a
[45:40] believer, we don't wallow in self-pity.
[45:44] I've hit the wall. It hurts. My big nose
[45:47] is flat. Everything is not fine. I'm now
[45:49] in this situation, but what do I do? So,
[45:52] do I so sit down and feel sorry for
[45:54] myself?
[45:56] Or do I hit the wall and step back and
[45:58] go, man, I've been here before
[46:02] and I'm looking around me and I'm going,
[46:03] what am I doing here?
[46:06] I'm starting to come to myself
[46:09] and I'm like, Lord, but why did I hit
[46:10] this wall again? Why am I in this trial
[46:13] again? What what am I doing here? I'm
[46:17] like, okay, let's go find the answer.
[46:19] Yeah, you feel sorry for yourself for
[46:21] the first two days, but then you man up
[46:23] and we move on. We have to. We're
[46:25] Christians. We're believers. Don't let
[46:27] the devil crown your life a unbeliever
[46:30] before the day you die. Rather die a
[46:32] believer than an unbeliever. Like if
[46:34] you're going to do something, be a
[46:35] believer with everything in you. You
[46:37] know, like seriously, if he says, "Oh,
[46:39] okay. You got cancer and you're going to
[46:42] die of cancer." You go, "I believe he
[46:44] can heal me. If I die of cancer, then I
[46:46] still believe he could heal me." Amen.
[46:48] He won't take me as an unbeliever. I
[46:50] will leave this realm as a believer cuz
[46:52] that's what he made me. We get a
[46:54] backbone, man. Christ has done so much
[46:57] for us. So he saved me, brought me in
[46:59] when I was 32 years old to bring me all
[47:01] the way here at 43
[47:04] to say, "Oh no, I lost you. Sorry." No,
[47:07] he can't start there and he can't finish
[47:08] here. So if he if he saved me there, he
[47:11] can heal me there. He can take me
[47:13] further into a rapture there. What is it
[47:16] to God? You know, if you understood the
[47:19] the the the might of God, if you really
[47:21] understood what God can do for you and
[47:24] how how awesome is he in battle, why
[47:26] would this little wall that I hit shake
[47:28] me? Then brother Isaac comes in. He
[47:30] goes, "Bring it on." And I'm sitting
[47:32] here going, "What are you talking about?
[47:33] I don't want more. Enough." He's like,
[47:36] "I bring it on." I'm like, "No, wait.
[47:38] Hold on, Isaac."
[47:40] You know, and and they preach these
[47:42] sermons and you're sitting there and you
[47:43] go, "No, can't bring more on. can't
[47:46] don't don't bring more on. I can't.
[47:50] I was there and Isaac's bold. Bring it
[47:52] on. I'm like,
[47:55] I can't. You know, I said to Isaac, I
[47:58] said that day he preached that sermon. I
[48:01] said, I was at a place where and and he
[48:04] knows about it. We we spoke. I said,
[48:06] I've been there and I know I have to go
[48:09] on, but there's nothing.
[48:13] It's like Hezekiah said, "The the child
[48:15] must come forth, but I have no strength
[48:17] to bring it. I can't do it." So, I get
[48:20] to a point where even the little bit of
[48:22] strength I thought I had was just
[48:26] and you're like, "I can't."
[48:29] And it's not God forsaking you. Listen
[48:32] to this. He was standing right next to
[48:34] me saying, "I know you can't."
[48:37] But I wasn't listening to the voice. I
[48:39] was feeling sorry for myself.
[48:42] We we don't feel sorry for ourselves cuz
[48:44] that's sympathy for the devil because
[48:47] all the devil does is he drives a wedge
[48:49] right there between you and God. You
[48:50] see, he doesn't care. See, you ain't
[48:53] overcome this one. See, you're going to
[48:54] fail.
[48:56] But inside me, I had unconfessed sin.
[49:01] I want you to listen. All of us live in
[49:04] sin.
[49:06] If I would ask any of you who doesn't
[49:08] sin, raise your hand now. None of you
[49:11] would because that is what happens.
[49:15] We're human stuck in this thing called
[49:18] flesh. Man, he's going to love it when
[49:21] we change this thing. Now, he says verse
[49:24] 9, if you can put that up, Dalia, if we
[49:27] confess our sins, he is faithful and
[49:30] just to forgive us our sins and cleanse
[49:32] us from all unrighteousness.
[49:35] So now I get to a point where I know
[49:38] God, you ain't talking to me.
[49:40] Something's got to change
[49:43] somewhere. Something's going to change
[49:45] because I want to hear your voice,
[49:48] man. Enough to say, I am wrong.
[49:53] But I didn't know what I was wrong about
[49:55] yet. I didn't. But I knew I wasn't in
[49:58] the right place cuz why would God bring
[50:00] it upon me? He wasn't being angry with
[50:02] me. He just was going, "Arman, Arman,
[50:06] Arman, Arand."
[50:10] That's what he did cuz he's patient and
[50:12] he's longsuffering.
[50:14] But I wasn't. I was just being me. And I
[50:18] was thinking everything I do was just
[50:19] let's go, let's go, let's go, Sergeant,
[50:22] soldier, march, march, march, wall,
[50:24] wall, wall, wall. And he's going stop,
[50:26] Arman. I just didn't listen.
[50:29] I didn't
[50:31] got to a point where where I sat for a
[50:34] week at home and felt so sorry for
[50:35] myself.
[50:37] That didn't help me nothing. I lost a
[50:39] week.
[50:41] Just to let you know,
[50:44] spirit of disobedience.
[50:47] So, there's a sister. Brother Kyra
[50:49] preached it this week, but he stole my
[50:51] notes. I just want to say, brother Kyra,
[50:53] I'm sorry, but I had it written down
[50:55] before you preached that.
[50:58] He says, I said, well, it's up to them.
[51:01] I don't know. So, this is the woman
[51:03] that's that that's cheating on a
[51:04] husband. Now, I want to ask you if you
[51:08] wronged someone.
[51:10] So, let's say, and I I'm not say anybody
[51:13] is, so just follow me.
[51:15] So, she cheated on her husband and then
[51:18] she said she's not going to tell her
[51:20] husband about this because she doesn't
[51:24] want to hurt him. She'll take this to
[51:26] the grave.
[51:29] Who's got a piece of paper? Who can rip
[51:31] a piece of paper off me? Debbie, can you
[51:33] rip me a piece of paper off there?
[51:35] Beautiful. Thank you. So, I want to show
[51:38] you something.
[51:40] So, here's sin,
[51:43] adultery.
[51:45] So, Satan goes and she cheats on her
[51:49] husband.
[51:51] And Satan goes, I'm just going to use
[51:53] you as example, Dave, you're the
[51:54] closest. Cuz he's not a girl. So none of
[51:57] the women think I'm bre. So he gives a
[51:59] adultery and he holds the other ticket.
[52:02] He's the accuser of the brethren.
[52:06] That's his job. And he does it really
[52:09] well. He's that complaining one that
[52:11] always says, "See, my brother did this
[52:13] and my brother did that and my brother
[52:14] did this and my sister did this and my
[52:16] sister." That's what he does. That's his
[52:17] job. Hey God,
[52:20] lust. Hey God, adultery. Hey God.
[52:24] Depression. Hey God. Envy, jealousy. Hey
[52:28] God, backbiting.
[52:32] Disobedience. See, he's got it. Cuz he's
[52:34] got it. And wave your ticket. He's got
[52:36] it. Cuz the other half of this ticket
[52:40] I'm holding.
[52:42] Hold that. So now, David, I'm using you
[52:46] as example. You are not committing
[52:47] adultery. Thank you, Lord. Because
[52:48] you're not married even. So,
[52:52] and sisters, if anybody's watching,
[52:57] that was for you, okay? Forgive me
[52:58] later. So, now David sits with adultery.
[53:01] This woman is caught in adultery. Now,
[53:03] David says, "When I die,
[53:07] when I die,
[53:09] I will not tell no one about this. Not
[53:12] my wife, until the day I die."
[53:16] What happens the day when you die with
[53:18] unconfessed sin? Have you ever thought
[53:20] about it?
[53:23] Who has the other ticket? Come by there
[53:26] by the Oh, I've been saved. Yeah, you've
[53:28] been saved, but there's a day of
[53:29] judgment.
[53:31] You still have this.
[53:34] The devil sits with the other part of
[53:36] the ticket that he made a deal with you
[53:37] with.
[53:42] Now, because you done it and you didn't
[53:45] strike it off and you didn't apply the
[53:47] blood, he's got all right to go before
[53:49] God and says, "Yep, day of judgment,
[53:52] David, adultery."
[53:54] And because God is a judge, then he
[53:56] cannot intercede on your behalf. Because
[53:59] now God's a judge.
[54:02] But hey, wait, hold on. David made it
[54:04] right with God.
[54:06] No, he must make it right with his wife
[54:10] first
[54:11] because the act was not committed
[54:13] against God. Yes, it's against his word,
[54:15] but it was committed against his wife.
[54:19] Do you see what I mean? Now, I'm playing
[54:22] open cards. I hope you all understand
[54:24] this is grown-up stuff, but I want to
[54:25] bring it into your park because it's
[54:27] unconfessed sin.
[54:30] It's going to drag you to hell because
[54:32] it gives the devil a legal right.
[54:36] Legal right. Here's what brother
[54:37] Brandham says. He says, so the sister
[54:41] said, I will not do it. And then the his
[54:46] wife said to him, so what is going to
[54:47] happen? He says, well, it's up to them.
[54:49] I don't know. But I said, you know, no
[54:52] matter how much you scream and how loud
[54:54] you scream and how much you pray, the
[54:56] devil has a legal right to stay right
[54:58] there and it will stay there, too.
[55:03] Because remember, you haven't placed
[55:05] this under the blood. The only way to do
[55:07] it is to bring it up from what's in
[55:09] here. All these strongholds, all these
[55:11] things that the Satan is holding against
[55:12] us, we need to get it stricken off.
[55:15] That's our job, bro. Clean up. Open the
[55:17] heart. Say, "Lord, every chamber, even
[55:19] if it hurts, come in everywhere,
[55:23] every crevice, get in there. I need you
[55:26] to be in there. I need to clean this. I
[55:28] want nothing
[55:30] in the enemy's hand."
[55:33] Nothing. That's our purpose. He says
[55:36] he's got a right to stay there. And not
[55:37] only that, but if he if you supposed to
[55:41] have done something and didn't do it, he
[55:44] has a legal right of disobedience.
[55:49] So if God tells you to do something and
[55:51] you don't do it, he's got a legal right
[55:54] of disobedience.
[55:56] So I'm asking, has God ever told you to
[55:58] do something and you didn't
[56:01] give your heart? Has he ever told you to
[56:03] repent or not do that? Like cuz this is
[56:07] serious stuff. The gospel is not all God
[56:09] is grace and mercy. He is. But between
[56:12] me and him, I have a accuser of the
[56:15] brethren. And all he wants to do is push
[56:17] a wedge between me and God. And that's
[56:20] all. And he studies you, David. And he
[56:22] studies you boys. And he knows all about
[56:24] you. And he knows about your dad and
[56:26] your dad's dad and your mom's dad and
[56:28] everybody's. And he knows where every
[56:30] one of them fell.
[56:33] And that thing is coming through your
[56:34] lineage. And it's now fallen into your
[56:36] lap. But see, we're going to get rid of
[56:39] this tonight because the blood of Jesus
[56:41] Christ, that's why he died for us. But
[56:44] you have to bring it out.
[56:46] You have to. It's life or death. This
[56:48] remember we are fighting. We are
[56:50] wrestling with God. But this is life and
[56:51] death. This is no shenanigans. This is
[56:54] no no playing games. This is life and
[56:56] death. We need to get it out.
[57:00] He says, "So there you will. So there is
[57:03] what it is combating the a person to
[57:07] find out just what is the cause. Then
[57:10] when you know where that where it is,
[57:12] you can start with a cure.
[57:15] He says, "So, and I'll read this. There
[57:17] is what it is.
[57:20] If uncon, it's unconfessed sin many
[57:22] times. So, you watch what you say,
[57:26] stomping this one out and stomping that
[57:28] one out." See, that's right. Faith will
[57:31] move, but not when it has a legal right
[57:35] against it. Satan knows what his rights
[57:38] is and what he is um what he hasn't got
[57:41] a right to. That's right.
[57:44] So clean yourself up before God and come
[57:47] pure and holy and ask then.
[57:51] So we're going to wrestle with God. Come
[57:54] pure and holy. Strike all these things
[57:56] off. Say, "Lord, whatever." It doesn't
[57:58] matter how much it stings.
[58:01] But now what happens is this woman has
[58:04] to go back to her husband and tell her
[58:06] husband what she's done. And brother
[58:09] Brandham says later on in a in a
[58:10] questions and answers, there's a sister
[58:12] that does the same thing and and she
[58:14] cheated on her husband with another man.
[58:16] And what he said is, "You didn't sin
[58:18] against God. You can go find it's in the
[58:20] message." He said, "You sinned against
[58:22] your husband." He says, "So go fix it
[58:24] with your husband. Then you and your
[58:26] husband go to that man and go fix it up
[58:29] with that man." He says, "And then both
[58:32] of you come and you pray and you fix it
[58:34] up with God." Beautiful. Get this sort.
[58:37] He says, "And if your husband wants to
[58:39] stay with you, that's all up to him. If
[58:40] he wants to leave you, he's got a right
[58:42] to all those things. But I'm telling
[58:43] you, let's first fix it up with your
[58:45] husband because you did sin against your
[58:47] husband." So, here's the thing, and we
[58:49] can talk it on a natural level. If I've
[58:51] offended someone here and I don't know
[58:54] about it, it's your duty to come and
[58:57] talk to me cuz why? I don't want a
[59:01] ticket against me.
[59:03] So you come and knock on my door and
[59:04] say, "Brother Mud, when you said this
[59:07] and this and this and this, I actually
[59:08] you you cut me a bit." I'm like, "I'm
[59:13] sorry. Let's pray. Would you forgive me,
[59:15] brother?" We take that thing and we go,
[59:20] we clean it. And you go now because we
[59:22] prayed together and you forgive me. I
[59:24] say, "Lord Jesus, will you forgive me?"
[59:25] And he goes, "Blood applied. Never did
[59:28] it in the first place." But we have to
[59:30] get to that moment. So God brings me to
[59:32] this moment and I start realizing that
[59:34] things that I did in the past and was
[59:36] doing was hindering my walk with the
[59:39] Lord and he was busy suffocating and
[59:42] killing me inside. Cuz remember this
[59:44] Sunday school teacher that was cheating
[59:46] on her husband, she went forward for
[59:47] prayer because she was dying.
[59:50] And brother Bradam says, "You're dying
[59:52] because you're carrying a secret.
[59:55] You can't forgive people and you're sick
[59:57] because you can't forgive people.
[1:00:00] forgive them. Make it right with them.
[1:00:02] Move on. If it's if it's so big that you
[1:00:05] can't forgive someone, that
[1:00:06] unforgiveness will drag your soul to
[1:00:08] hell. I'm telling you, because you won't
[1:00:12] be healed. You'll be bitter. And though
[1:00:14] you have salvation, you will never be in
[1:00:16] fellowship with God because you always
[1:00:17] let this unforgiveness be between you
[1:00:19] and God. Get rid of it. Strike it off.
[1:00:22] There's bigger things than that. There's
[1:00:25] bigger things than that. Amen. Shouldn't
[1:00:28] be so serious. Hold on.
[1:00:31] Because remember, God is a Lord that is
[1:00:33] merciful and gracious and
[1:00:35] long-suffering. So here David comes and
[1:00:38] he goes to his wife, which is now the
[1:00:40] imaginary wife, and he says, "Love,
[1:00:44] I I cheated on you."
[1:00:47] and it was with such and such and such
[1:00:49] and such a time
[1:00:51] and I'm really sorry you know and I know
[1:00:54] I didn't want to hurt your feelings and
[1:00:56] I know we're going to have to there's
[1:00:58] repercussions you reap what you sow I
[1:01:01] know the next couple of stops we're
[1:01:02] going to have a a little bit of we're
[1:01:05] going to have have a bit of a
[1:01:06] reconciliation
[1:01:08] but you know what I can't give the devil
[1:01:11] this ticket
[1:01:13] and he takes the ticket and he says
[1:01:15] after she says forgive him he says
[1:01:18] Lord Jesus, would you apply the blood?
[1:01:22] And the Lord says, "Yes, Davey. What?
[1:01:25] What did you do?"
[1:01:27] You go, "Nothing." Awesome. You did
[1:01:30] nothing. Never never did it in the first
[1:01:33] place. Cuz my blood is stronger than
[1:01:35] your biggest weakness, your greatest
[1:01:38] sin, my blood, my suffering can heal
[1:01:41] you. I just want your sin. Just give it
[1:01:45] to me. Cuz what am I going to do with a
[1:01:46] sin? I go back to your accuser at the
[1:01:48] day of judgment and I go, "What sin? You
[1:01:52] made them do it. You were the one that
[1:01:54] was dishonest."
[1:01:56] So, see, we as brothers and sisters,
[1:01:58] listen, we want to clear everything.
[1:02:03] We don't want anything holding us back
[1:02:05] because God wants to walk with you and
[1:02:07] he wants to walk with you daily. But
[1:02:09] when he brings you into a situation and
[1:02:11] you see this this this thing that's
[1:02:13] happening with you, just remember God's
[1:02:15] trying to show you something deeper than
[1:02:18] just the wall that you hit.
[1:02:20] Go quiet. Start talking to the Lord.
[1:02:24] I'll go on. Book of James says, "If
[1:02:27] there's any sick among you, let him call
[1:02:29] for the elders of the church and let
[1:02:30] them pray over them, anointing them with
[1:02:32] oil." We all know this. We believe this.
[1:02:34] Who believes this? We do it. I see it
[1:02:36] happen every Sunday.
[1:02:38] Okay, we'll go on.
[1:02:40] He says, "And the prayer of the faith
[1:02:42] shall save the sick, and the Lord shall
[1:02:44] raise them up. And if they have
[1:02:46] committed sins, they shall be forgiven."
[1:02:52] Done. Full stop. Not maybe, but uh if
[1:02:56] they committed sins, it's done. I strike
[1:02:59] it off. But remember who you sinned
[1:03:02] against, cuz that's the whole thing I
[1:03:04] want to say. If you haven't sinned
[1:03:05] against God, God has no beef with you.
[1:03:09] Listen to what I say. He's not going to
[1:03:10] drag you over the coals. He wants you to
[1:03:12] first go to that person and make it
[1:03:14] right. And then come before him. He's
[1:03:16] not. Because it has to be you wronged
[1:03:18] that person. You didn't wrong God. He
[1:03:20] just broke maybe one of his things. But
[1:03:22] that's what the blood is for. Go fix it
[1:03:24] up with that person. Even if they don't
[1:03:26] know, fix it up. Get rid of the ticket.
[1:03:29] Okay. He says, "Confess your faults one
[1:03:32] to another and pray one another that you
[1:03:35] might be healed and the effectual
[1:03:37] fervent prayer of a righteous man
[1:03:39] availth much." So here's the antidote.
[1:03:42] Pray for one another. Confess your sins.
[1:03:45] Brother Ben, sorry I didn't answer your
[1:03:47] phone call today. I really just
[1:03:49] couldn't, you know, but forgive me
[1:03:50] anyways. He goes, "Ah, it's just a phone
[1:03:52] call. Don't worry." But stuff like that
[1:03:54] shouldn't even be between believers. We
[1:03:56] should just get any little thing. Get it
[1:03:58] out, man. Kick that devil out. Don't
[1:04:00] give him any wiggle room. Don't hand out
[1:04:02] tickets. Don't make deals. This is all
[1:04:04] deals that he wants to hold. And at the
[1:04:06] day of judgment, he wants to come with
[1:04:07] his little snickering cell going to go
[1:04:10] see God, he did this. Get rid of it.
[1:04:14] If you're looking at something that you
[1:04:15] shouldn't be looking online, get rid of
[1:04:17] it. It's adultery anyways.
[1:04:20] If you if you if you're backbiting or or
[1:04:23] or gossiping and all those things, you
[1:04:26] know what? Stop it. Say, "Lord, I don't
[1:04:27] want to do it. Get rid of it. Get rid of
[1:04:29] it. Go to that brother and say, "Hey,
[1:04:31] brother Isaac, I use you always example
[1:04:33] because I know you can take it." Or,
[1:04:34] "Brother Ed, this one, I told you you
[1:04:36] can't pass left-handed, but it was
[1:04:38] behind your back. Sorry, bro. You know,
[1:04:40] I didn't mean it." And that I'm faster
[1:04:41] than you. We all know that's a lie.
[1:04:44] Okay? But stuff like that shouldn't hold
[1:04:47] you away from God. Get rid of it. It's
[1:04:50] tickets. We don't want tickets. We don't
[1:04:52] want tickets. We got sick among us. We
[1:04:56] believe the scripture. We've got people
[1:04:57] coming here for healing. Anything that
[1:04:59] could hinder it, let's get rid of it
[1:05:01] tonight. Get rid of it. I'm not calling
[1:05:02] for a a big fall at the altar, try and
[1:05:05] cry out, and that's not me. Just, you
[1:05:07] know, when God's speaking to you, I knew
[1:05:10] when God was getting my attention, I had
[1:05:12] to get rid of it. I promise you when you
[1:05:14] get rid of it,
[1:05:17] when that goes, oh,
[1:05:21] you don't know what it does. It make it
[1:05:23] it brings you up to a place where you
[1:05:25] go, Lord, I should have done this a long
[1:05:27] time ago. But all the devil wanted you
[1:05:30] to know is it's too hard.
[1:05:33] It's too hard. You shouldn't do this.
[1:05:35] Cuz that's all he has is is that little
[1:05:38] lies that he tells you, don't tell her.
[1:05:39] You're going to hurt her. You're going
[1:05:41] to hurt her,
[1:05:43] man. But when I said those words, just
[1:05:46] this weight just went and now I know
[1:05:49] there's nothing between me and my wife.
[1:05:52] There's nothing between me and my Lord.
[1:05:54] There's nothing between me and my
[1:05:55] brothers. Whatever was there is just
[1:05:58] gone.
[1:06:00] I can walk.
[1:06:02] I can breathe. I can take my word and I
[1:06:05] say, "Lord, you said there's no
[1:06:07] condemnation. I ask whatever I want. You
[1:06:10] will give it to me cuz I'm in fellowship
[1:06:11] with you. It's a nice place to be. Has
[1:06:14] the trial stopped? Nope. That the
[1:06:17] changing year? 100%.
[1:06:20] 100%.
[1:06:22] I can testify to it.
[1:06:25] He says, "Wherefore I desire ye not.
[1:06:28] Faint not at the tribulations for you,
[1:06:31] which is your glory.
[1:06:34] So when I send you a trial, I'm going to
[1:06:36] glorify you through that. I'm going to
[1:06:39] show you that is for your best. Strike
[1:06:42] it off, man. For this cause I bow my
[1:06:45] knees unto the Father and our Lord Jesus
[1:06:47] Christ, whom the whole family in heaven
[1:06:49] and earth is named. What is your name?
[1:06:53] Jesus Christ.
[1:06:55] Have you ever thought about it? He was
[1:06:57] righteous as God is righteous. He's
[1:06:59] saying it in the book of Ephesians. God
[1:07:02] don't lie.
[1:07:05] He says that he would grant you
[1:07:07] according to his riches of his glory to
[1:07:09] be strengthened with might by his spirit
[1:07:12] in the inner man.
[1:07:15] So he's not interested in anything else
[1:07:17] but that very very personal relationship
[1:07:22] in there.
[1:07:24] And whatever is holding Jesus Christ out
[1:07:26] of that heart, strike it off.
[1:07:30] Strike it off. If there is anything that
[1:07:33] comes to mind,
[1:07:35] anything that the Lord is showing you,
[1:07:37] strike it off. Don't let it linger.
[1:07:39] Strike it off. Because you'll find
[1:07:41] yourself coming to the same mountain at
[1:07:43] the same time until God strikes that
[1:07:45] thing off. Because his very intention
[1:07:49] is to get rid of that
[1:07:52] so that you can walk in purity before
[1:07:54] God.
[1:07:56] I'll close with this. Can you put up
[1:07:58] Psalm 103, please, Talio? I'll give you
[1:08:02] a heads up.
[1:08:04] No, this is not a look, this is not a
[1:08:06] heavy sermon. This is a light sermon. If
[1:08:10] there is nothing
[1:08:12] nothing that somebody can bring before
[1:08:14] you, what place are you at?
[1:08:19] What place are you at?
[1:08:22] When there's nothing that you hide from
[1:08:24] your husband or your wife or your
[1:08:25] brother or your pastor or the deacons,
[1:08:28] the deacons, there's nothing. And the
[1:08:32] devil comes before God and he goes,
[1:08:34] we'll say God is there because he's high
[1:08:36] and lifted up and devil is here. And
[1:08:40] here you stand before God and here comes
[1:08:42] Satan and he goes, "But God,
[1:08:45] he he
[1:08:50] did
[1:08:52] He did nothing.
[1:08:55] God says, "Yep."
[1:08:57] He said, "Well, Satan, what's that in
[1:08:59] your pocket?"
[1:09:00] Satan turns around and he goes, "Oh."
[1:09:05] God says, "You did everything cuz he
[1:09:08] applied my blood."
[1:09:11] How would that day be when you stand in
[1:09:14] the very presence of a pure God and
[1:09:17] where the littlest of sin is the biggest
[1:09:20] darkest blot in his presence and you
[1:09:23] have nothing because you applied the
[1:09:24] sacrifice?
[1:09:26] How great is that?
[1:09:29] Let's get rid of it. I say let's get rid
[1:09:31] of it. Let's not keep any. If there's
[1:09:34] anything, just clear it. Get rid of it.
[1:09:36] Don't have to Don't have to repent for
[1:09:38] 10 years. Just get rid of it. say, "God,
[1:09:40] you know what? I've wronged brother
[1:09:42] Arman. I said he's got a big nose." I'll
[1:09:44] go straight to him. Don't worry. I've
[1:09:45] forgiven you. All of you say it's a big
[1:09:46] nose. It's true. And he'll go to him and
[1:09:48] say, "Forgive me, brother, cuz I love
[1:09:50] you." I go, "Never did it in the first
[1:09:52] place. Let's walk on. There's bigger
[1:09:55] stuff than this." Psalm 103. You can
[1:09:57] open your word, open your Bibles, read
[1:09:59] the psalm with me, and we'll close with
[1:10:01] that. Mos, you can come forward. It's a
[1:10:03] prayer meeting tonight.
[1:10:06] See, what happens is when when I hit the
[1:10:08] wall and God started showing me what was
[1:10:11] going on in my life, it set not just me
[1:10:15] free, it made me free.
[1:10:19] And now I can stand and I can look at my
[1:10:21] wife and I can look at brother Ed, which
[1:10:23] is one of my best buddies, and brother
[1:10:25] Ben, and I would say with honest of
[1:10:28] heart, look at these two men and say,
[1:10:29] "There's nothing between me and you.
[1:10:32] I love you both with an unconditional
[1:10:34] love. Brother Matt and Brother Isaac and
[1:10:37] all of you, Brother Davey and Jonno and
[1:10:40] Ruben and them, I can look at you and I
[1:10:43] can say, "Brother MO, it's nothing
[1:10:46] between us. We just I just love you."
[1:10:49] Even if you say sorry and you don't mean
[1:10:51] it.
[1:10:54] Hey, you started it. It's a cool
[1:10:56] feeling, man. You You can't I can't
[1:10:58] explain it to you. it. I Let me just be
[1:11:01] our mad ones. Okay, come on. You all
[1:11:02] know I'm quirky. It's such a cool
[1:11:04] feeling if somebody stands in front of
[1:11:06] you and you look at them and you look at
[1:11:08] them and you go, I see nothing but love.
[1:11:11] I see nothing but love. There's nothing
[1:11:14] against you. There's nothing against
[1:11:15] you, sister. There's nothing against
[1:11:17] you, Sister Landy. Nobody, Sister um
[1:11:20] Tabitha and and uh Sister Ping. I look
[1:11:23] at you and there's nothing against you.
[1:11:25] Not one bad word. I don't care. I just
[1:11:27] have nothing. I just put love for all of
[1:11:29] you. Brother Phiney,
[1:11:32] huh? Sister Chippy. I used to not greet
[1:11:35] her and then she gave me a pox. Now I
[1:11:37] greet her all the time because she's
[1:11:40] worthy to be greeted at least. So
[1:11:42] there's nothing.
[1:11:44] So when Satan comes to you and says
[1:11:46] there's something, you say, "Shut up. I
[1:11:48] applied the blood. It's done."
[1:11:51] And then when he comes before God as the
[1:11:53] accuser of the brethren, I would just
[1:11:54] like to see his face on that day where
[1:11:56] he runs up and he gets before God and he
[1:11:58] goes, "Oh dear." Okay, let's go back
[1:12:01] there. I just failed. Isn't that what we
[1:12:03] want to do? Well, let's do it. Clear it
[1:12:06] out. Psalm 101. Bless the Lord, oh my
[1:12:09] soul, and all that is within me, bless
[1:12:12] his holy name. Bless the Lord, oh my
[1:12:15] soul. Forget not all his benefits.
[1:12:18] Hello. Listen to his benefits. Who
[1:12:20] forgiveth all thine iniquities, who
[1:12:23] healeth all thy diseases, who redeemth
[1:12:25] thy life from destruction, who crowneth
[1:12:27] thee with loving kindness and tender
[1:12:29] mercies. What is his purpose for you?
[1:12:33] To restore,
[1:12:36] fully restore.
[1:12:39] He says to satisfy thy mouth with good
[1:12:41] things. How many of us needs a bit of
[1:12:44] satisfying our mouths with good things?
[1:12:46] Hey,
[1:12:48] so that their youth is renewed like
[1:12:51] eagles. So you can run down the road
[1:12:53] like sister Shannon for and brother
[1:12:55] Isaac for kilometers.
[1:12:58] Re get your youth back. Don't come into
[1:13:00] church and feel old and you drag
[1:13:02] yourself in. But be young and good
[1:13:04] again, man. Strong.
[1:13:07] It's how Caleb was before he took his
[1:13:09] mountain. The Lord executed
[1:13:12] righteousness and judgment for all that
[1:13:15] are oppressed.
[1:13:17] He does it. He made known his ways unto
[1:13:20] Moses, his acts to all the children of
[1:13:23] Israel. The Lord is merciful and
[1:13:25] gracious, slow to anger and plenteous in
[1:13:28] mercy.
[1:13:30] Reach out.
[1:13:32] He will not always chide. Neither will
[1:13:35] he keep his anger forever.
[1:13:41] He hath not dealt with us after our own
[1:13:43] sins, nor rewarded us according to our
[1:13:46] iniquities.
[1:13:48] For as heaven is high above the earth,
[1:13:50] so great is the mercy toward them that
[1:13:53] fear him. It's a godly fear. As far as
[1:13:56] the east is from the west,
[1:14:00] so far he has removed the transgressions
[1:14:02] from us.
[1:14:04] Like as a father pity for children, so
[1:14:08] the Lord pity them that fear him. For we
[1:14:11] know our frame, and you remember that we
[1:14:15] are dust. What a great God.
[1:14:21] For a man in his days are the grass and
[1:14:24] the flower of the field, and he
[1:14:26] flourishes, but the wind passes over,
[1:14:29] and it is gone, and the place thereof
[1:14:31] shall know it no more.
[1:14:34] But the mercy of the Lord is for the
[1:14:36] everlasting to everlasting upon them
[1:14:38] that fear him, and his righteousness
[1:14:40] unto his children's children,
[1:14:43] to such as keep his covenant, and for
[1:14:46] those that remember his commandments to
[1:14:48] do them. The Lord hath prepared his
[1:14:51] throne in the heavens, and his kingdom
[1:14:54] ruleth over all.
[1:14:56] Bless the Lord, yes, his angels, and
[1:15:00] excel in strength.
[1:15:03] that do his commandments and hearken
[1:15:05] unto the voice of his word. Bless ye the
[1:15:10] Lord, all ye host, ye ministers of his,
[1:15:13] and do his pleasure. Bless the Lord all
[1:15:17] his works and all his places of the
[1:15:20] dominion. Bless the Lord, oh my soul.
[1:15:23] David knew how to repent,
[1:15:26] and that's why he was a mighty man of
[1:15:29] God's own heart. Amen. We got some
[1:15:32] prayer requests tonight. I'm going to
[1:15:34] pray for us all. If you just bow your
[1:15:36] heads and we'll go into a a a prayer
[1:15:39] after this, but I just want to close the
[1:15:40] service here and say if you all would
[1:15:43] just bow your heads and mus if you can
[1:15:46] play while bowing your heads. If you
[1:15:47] can't just stop playing, but I want you
[1:15:48] to bow your heads and just close your
[1:15:51] eyes. I'm not looking either. This is a
[1:15:54] moment between you and God. If there's
[1:15:55] anything, and I know we all have
[1:15:57] something, I raise both my hands that
[1:16:00] you think that the Lord would deal with
[1:16:02] you with or busy dealing with, I
[1:16:05] encourage you, brother. I encourage you,
[1:16:07] sister. Go to the fountain of life.
[1:16:12] Go and say, "Lord, I come.
[1:16:15] I'm not going to entertain anything
[1:16:17] anymore. I will put even everything to
[1:16:20] side, Lord, until I find, Lord, that you
[1:16:23] have forgiven me and I've stricken off
[1:16:25] the sin that the devil has put against
[1:16:27] me. If it's a ought against a brother or
[1:16:30] a sister or even against a a family
[1:16:33] member or somebody you know, Lord, you
[1:16:36] guys know, just let it go. Brothers and
[1:16:38] sisters, put it down. If you if you if
[1:16:42] it is something really serious, I
[1:16:43] encourage that you would ask the Lord
[1:16:45] now. How he worked with me is he he kind
[1:16:48] of I said Lord if this is you speaking I
[1:16:52] asked that you would confirm it for me
[1:16:54] and show me in your scripture Lord that
[1:16:56] it is you speaking and I went back and I
[1:16:59] asked for the sign of Gideon and Gideon
[1:17:02] sign was given but recently all I said
[1:17:05] is Lord put your finger on that sin and
[1:17:08] make your light holy light shine upon
[1:17:10] that so it's so dark that it will blot
[1:17:13] out everything around me so I know that
[1:17:15] is what you want to deal with. If you
[1:17:16] have any unconfessed sin before God, I
[1:17:20] pray that you would raise your hand and
[1:17:23] he would say, "Lord, help me by raising
[1:17:27] my hand to go and fix this in the name
[1:17:29] of our Lord Jesus Christ and make this
[1:17:32] right to strike it off anything that the
[1:17:34] devil has against me. Cuz the day of
[1:17:36] judgment, I do not want to stand there,
[1:17:39] Father. I want everything clean between
[1:17:41] my Lord and my Savior. And I want to be
[1:17:44] able to approach your throne room at any
[1:17:46] time to come into your holy presence,
[1:17:48] Father, under the shed blood of the
[1:17:50] lamb. And I ask that you would place it
[1:17:52] there. In the name of our Lord Jesus
[1:17:55] Christ, we'll pray now. Say, Lord,
[1:17:58] we all have our hands lifted up, Lord.
[1:18:01] I'm sure of it, Lord. I'm not watching.
[1:18:04] But I want to ask Lord that if there's
[1:18:06] any sin between our Lord and our Savior,
[1:18:09] Lord, anything that's there between us
[1:18:10] and you, Father, tonight we just raise
[1:18:13] our hands in acknowledgement to say,
[1:18:15] Lord, we ain't perfect. We're all just
[1:18:17] sinners, Lord, and unworthy. But Lord,
[1:18:20] your blood, oh Father, your blood is so
[1:18:22] great and your kindness and mercy is so
[1:18:25] great that you would be so mindful of us
[1:18:29] that you would come our way tonight,
[1:18:30] Lord, and say, "You've never did it in
[1:18:33] the first place, my son and my daughter.
[1:18:36] You are forgiven. Go and sin no more."
[1:18:40] Oh Lord, because we don't want to be
[1:18:42] like that woman that carried that sin
[1:18:44] all the way to the grave. We want to get
[1:18:45] rid of everything right now. So we ask
[1:18:47] in the name of Jesus Christ, would you
[1:18:49] just show us, Lord, what is that thing
[1:18:51] that would either hinder our walk with
[1:18:53] you, Father? Oh Lord, would you just
[1:18:56] release from it now, Lord, and and make
[1:18:58] us clean through the shed blood of your
[1:19:00] your son, Lord, that died and was
[1:19:03] crucified for us, Lord, where this bride
[1:19:06] that you've given us was burned from his
[1:19:07] side, from his side, unleashed, Lord,
[1:19:10] when they they took that spear and they
[1:19:12] pierced his side. Lord, that blood and
[1:19:15] that water, that tears, that broken
[1:19:17] heart was flowing for me, Father, and
[1:19:19] for my sins. I ask Lord that it would
[1:19:22] just clean us now white as snow and Lord
[1:19:25] that there be no condemnation between us
[1:19:27] and you Lord. Father and whatever we
[1:19:29] need to do Lord let us do it speedingly
[1:19:32] Lord because we know the day of your
[1:19:34] visitation is at hand and Lord we are
[1:19:37] waiting for that day to take that
[1:19:38] rapture. So we pray for your forgiveness
[1:19:41] Lord in the name of our Lord Jesus
[1:19:42] Christ. Amen and amen.
[1:19:46] Amen. I don't know if there was any
[1:19:48] prayer request. Did anybody put prayer
[1:19:50] requests on the brothers and sisters?
[1:19:52] Brother Ed, did you see anything?
[1:20:10] [Music]
[1:20:13] No matter what I see,
[1:20:17] no matter what I feel,
[1:20:20] no matter what I hear,
[1:20:25] I believe.
[1:20:28] No matter what I'm told,
[1:20:32] no matter how it seems,
[1:20:35] no matter what it costs,
[1:20:40] I believe.
[1:20:44] And if I look and it seems like it's
[1:20:48] broken,
[1:20:51] I'll lay a hallelu
[1:20:54] on the altar.
[1:20:58] And if I look and it seems like it's
[1:21:02] over,
[1:21:04] [Music]
[1:21:06] I'll lay a hallelujah
