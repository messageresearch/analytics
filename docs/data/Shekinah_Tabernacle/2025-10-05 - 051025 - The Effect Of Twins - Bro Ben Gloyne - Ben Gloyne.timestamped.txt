[5:32] [Music]
[5:58] Good morning.
[6:00] How are you all today? You good?
[6:04] Who likes humor?
[6:10] It's probably one of my most enjoyable
[6:12] things in life is humor. Probably
[6:14] doesn't help my name means laughter.
[6:17] I I'm I'm just thinking this because
[6:19] Okay, I'm going to let you in on a
[6:21] little
[6:22] joke I walked into which I thought was
[6:27] really funny because Christians have a
[6:28] very good sense of humor. if if you're
[6:29] wholesome, you know, you haven't good.
[6:31] So, I walk in the bathroom just before
[6:35] and Jimmy and Ka are in the the in there
[6:40] in the before you go into the cubicles.
[6:42] cuz there's a little room there
[6:45] and um see little young fellas sort of
[6:47] go in there and goof around and you know
[6:49] so when I walked in Jimmy's sort of joke
[6:52] reaction was he put his hand on KDA and
[6:55] did this like
[6:58] do you get the joke
[7:01] like I know I'm not any goofing around
[7:02] we're really spiritual I'm just praying
[7:04] for this brother quiet time in the the
[7:06] bathroom you know just but it's very
[7:08] quick very good humor you know you sort
[7:10] of see the joke you think that's it's
[7:11] actually quite Honey, that's very, you
[7:14] know, um I had a childhood friend
[7:19] and um he was a Christian of sorts that
[7:24] he and then he called me up like um
[7:26] years and years later like four or five
[7:27] years ago and he said he was coming into
[7:29] Wellington to do a he was a comedian now
[7:31] he's doing a comedy show in Wellington
[7:32] and can I come along to his show and I
[7:36] guess being a childhood friend I said
[7:37] yeah come along
[7:40] but when we were talking at home before
[7:41] we went I said, you know, the problem
[7:42] with humor these days is that especially
[7:45] Kiwi humor in and comedians, they're
[7:47] very it's smut. And it's every punch
[7:50] line is either a swear word or smut, you
[7:53] know, and and as a result, it's not
[7:54] actually that funny because it's not
[7:55] well thought out. Like if they would
[7:57] take away if they wouldn't swear and
[7:58] wouldn't be smutty, they could actually
[8:00] think of intelligent humor, you know,
[8:03] like a like an like a funny comedians
[8:06] will talk about if make a play on
[8:07] American words, you know how they call
[8:08] it uh the Americans got glasses, you
[8:11] know, but they they put them on their
[8:13] legs and on here and there cuz they they
[8:15] didn't know where to put them and
[8:16] someone said, "No, they're for your
[8:17] eyes." Oh, so we call them eyeglasses,
[8:19] you know. Like anyway, I'm not trying to
[8:22] make a comedy show, but I I said to this
[8:24] guy, "That's the problem with humor.
[8:26] And he was dead silent, my friend. He
[8:28] didn't say anything, you know. He's
[8:29] like, and I went to his comedy show and
[8:32] and every punchline and was either smut
[8:34] or a swear word. And it wasn't very
[8:37] funny. And I I noticed he since changed
[8:39] to the way he does things now. He
[8:40] doesn't actually do that anymore.
[8:43] But I'm glad that, you know, we as
[8:45] Christians, we can actually have
[8:46] wholesome humor. You know, we can laugh
[8:49] and have a good time with each other and
[8:50] just enjoy. You know, humor is is quite
[8:51] a warm thing. Um, just a few notices
[8:54] before we start. Straight after church
[8:56] is I think this is all right. Can we can
[8:58] we stay here and practice a song like
[8:59] for like 15 minutes before we go out to
[9:01] lunch? Just while everyone's here like
[9:03] we'll do like one song and then we'll do
[9:05] it and then then
[9:07] could we come back in at 1:45 just for
[9:09] another quick session if you're here. If
[9:10] you're not here, all good. But just like
[9:13] another 15 minutes. There'll be like two
[9:14] short ones cuz I think if you do one
[9:16] then another one it will kind of cement
[9:18] in our mind a bit more. like two of like
[9:20] 20 minutes and then at 3:00 there's also
[9:23] a youth meeting at the Gloins house. Are
[9:26] you running that or it's like a Yep.
[9:28] Yep. So yeah, 3:00 at the Gloss. So
[9:31] yeah, if we could stand this morning,
[9:32] sorry, I've been talking for a bit. If
[9:33] we could stand, we'll just open up in
[9:34] prayer
[9:36] this morning.
[9:38] Lord, we thank you that we can enter
[9:39] into your presence, Lord, into
[9:42] Lord, just a warm atmosphere where we
[9:44] feel your your presence. Lord, we feel
[9:46] we feel at a liberty to to express
[9:49] ourselves. And we thank you, Lord, that
[9:50] you've purified each one of our hearts,
[9:52] Lord, that the there's a scripture that
[9:54] says out of the from the abund the
[9:56] abundance of the heart, the mouth
[9:58] speaketh. And I thank you, Lord, that in
[10:00] in our hearts are only good things,
[10:01] Lord. And only wholesome things and only
[10:03] only nice things, Lord. Only nice words
[10:05] and caring words, Lord. And and
[10:10] Lord, and even the humor, our humor is
[10:12] not smutty. It's just it's it's it's the
[10:14] humor that you would have, Lord. It's it
[10:16] comes from a nice place. And we just we
[10:17] just thank you for making each one of us
[10:19] whole, Lord. And and where we slip up
[10:20] and where we say things we shouldn't say
[10:22] or Yeah. just respond in ways that we
[10:25] shouldn't respond. We pray you forgive
[10:26] us, Lord, and help us to Lord, to guard
[10:28] our tongue, as James said, the Lord,
[10:30] it's a small member in our body. It's
[10:32] just only this tiny little thing. And
[10:33] yet, Lord, it can cause so much
[10:34] destruction. If we look in the world, mo
[10:36] most of the destruction is caused starts
[10:38] from the tongue. So we just pray help us
[10:40] to control our tongue and just use it
[10:42] wisely each and every day Lord and just
[10:44] bless us this morning as we come and
[10:46] worship you Lord and we want to enter
[10:47] into your course with praise Lord. We go
[10:49] forward in the battle praising you this
[10:50] morning. So we just commit ourselves to
[10:52] your to you this morning in Jesus name.

[42:47] after service and so on. And then also
[42:49] there's yeah there's a youth youth
[42:51] meeting at our house at 3 3 p.m. So it'
[42:53] be real good if you could all make it
[42:55] who are youth. Amen. So we're just going
[42:57] to turn to the scripture um this
[42:59] morning. Going to turn to Genesis 25 and
[43:02] uh yeah 25 and read from verses 21 to
[43:04] 25. Um,
[43:16] amen. Everyone happy today?
[43:19] Amen. Good. Amen. And it says, "And
[43:22] Isaac entreated the Lord for his wife
[43:24] because she was barren. And the Lord was
[43:27] intreat uh intreated of him. And Rebecca
[43:30] his wife conceived. And the children
[43:32] struggled together within her." And she
[43:33] said, "If it be so, why am I thus?" And
[43:36] she went to inquire of the Lord. And the
[43:39] Lord said unto her, "Two nations are in
[43:40] thy womb, and two manner of people shall
[43:42] be se separated from thy boughels, and
[43:44] the one people shall be stronger than
[43:46] the other people, and the elder shall
[43:49] serve the younger. And when her days uh
[43:52] days to be delivered were fulfilled,
[43:54] behold, there came twins in her womb. Um
[43:57] there were twins in her womb, sorry. And
[43:59] the first came out red all over like a
[44:01] hairy garment. And they called his name
[44:03] Esau. And after that came his brother
[44:05] out, and his hand took hold on Esau's
[44:08] heel, and his name was called Jacob. And
[44:10] Isaac was three score years old when she
[44:13] bare them. Amen. Let's bow heads in a
[44:16] word of prayer this morning. Amen.
[44:18] Gracious Father, truly you do miracles
[44:20] so great. We're so thankful, Lord.
[44:22] You're not a God of history, but you're
[44:23] the same today. Lord, as your word says,
[44:26] Jesus Christ the same yesterday, today,
[44:27] and forever. Father, as we bow our heads
[44:29] and our hearts in your presence, we ask,
[44:31] dear God, that you do a supernatural
[44:32] work in our lives, Lord. May he touch
[44:34] all of us. Speak to our hearts, dear
[44:36] God. We've not come to hear a lecture,
[44:38] Lord, but we come, Lord, we want to come
[44:39] to the presence of almighty God. That
[44:41] you come and take us from glory to
[44:43] glory. Lord, I pray you'd bless each one
[44:45] here, dear God. bless your great a a
[44:48] eternal word as we've read it. Father,
[44:50] bless it to our hearts and Lord be those
[44:52] who couldn't be here today. Dear God, we
[44:54] just commit this whole day into your
[44:55] hands. May it be a may it be a wonderful
[44:58] time in your presence, Lord, for your
[44:59] glory. We ask these things in Jesus
[45:01] Christ's name. Amen. Amen. God bless
[45:04] you. You can have your seats this
[45:05] morning. So, I want to speak today about
[45:07] the effect of twins. Now, as we go
[45:11] through this today, I'm not putting any
[45:13] names on anyone or identifying people.
[45:15] Well, this is not the purpose, but I
[45:17] just want to show you through the
[45:18] scripture how every every revival brings
[45:20] forth twins. Uh, and you know, so, so
[45:23] there's always these two classes of
[45:24] people within every every revival down
[45:26] through history. There's a spiritual,
[45:28] there's the natural. As I said, I'm not
[45:29] here to identify the natural or the
[45:31] spiritual. But what I want to point out
[45:33] is that the effect of that twin can be
[45:35] upon our walk with God. Because we've
[45:37] got to remember that our walk with God
[45:39] is a personal walk. Amen. It's not a
[45:41] it's not via someone else. It's not you
[45:43] and me and God. It's me and God or it's
[45:45] you and God. Amen. That's how God wants
[45:47] it to be. And he wants our walk to be
[45:49] according to his word, not according to
[45:51] what other people do or what other
[45:53] people have done with the word. That's
[45:55] not our that's not our business really.
[45:57] What they do is between them and God,
[45:59] but what you do is between you and God.
[46:01] Amen. So, the whole purpose of this
[46:03] service this morning is really to look
[46:05] at how how people how twins can can
[46:08] affect one another. Now, this is
[46:09] spiritual twins I'm talking about. I'm
[46:11] going to take some natural examples, but
[46:14] I just want you to look into this as a
[46:16] spiritual thing. I'm going to bring it
[46:17] into today. And so that's really where
[46:19] we're going today. Okay? So really where
[46:21] it boils down to is like Peter would ask
[46:23] the Lord when you after the
[46:24] resurrection. What's going to happen to
[46:26] the you know to the man who said you
[46:28] will not see death you'll not taste
[46:30] death till you know you know Lord you
[46:32] come again. And Jesus said what is it to
[46:34] thee? Follow thou me. And really when it
[46:37] boils down everything in life, people do
[46:40] things happen. There's things happen
[46:41] within the movement of Christianity or
[46:43] within the message. What is it to thee?
[46:46] &gt;&gt; Follow him. Follow his word. Amen.
[46:48] Because we got to realize that the
[46:49] fulfillment of scripture is always going
[46:51] to be within the believers. Amen. It's
[46:53] always going to be, you know, sure we
[46:55] can talk about the beast, we can talk
[46:56] about the world, all those things, but
[46:58] the true fulfillment is really going to
[46:59] be within the framework of the message
[47:02] of the hour.
[47:04] But, you know, so there's going to be
[47:05] everything's going to be there to test
[47:07] you, to try you, to try and get you in
[47:08] some ditch, try and keep you in some
[47:10] bunker. But really, we got to we got to
[47:12] draw a line under those things and not
[47:14] let those things define us at all. But
[47:16] let the word of God be our defining
[47:18] thing. I mean, in this background of
[47:20] this picture here, we have well, the
[47:22] even even um Google says that they
[47:24] weren't strictly twins, but there's Cain
[47:26] and Abel. We know they're the first two
[47:28] that came out of that revival in that
[47:29] day of the blood of the lamb. And one
[47:31] would offer the blood of uh blood of the
[47:34] lamb by revelation that was Abel. And
[47:36] Cain he offered the fruits of the
[47:37] ground. And as it says in Hebrews
[47:39] chapter 11 that you know Abel offered a
[47:41] more excellent sacrifice than that of
[47:43] Cain. So Cain's sacrifice was good. It
[47:46] was excellent. Abel's was more excellent
[47:48] because it was by revelation. But what
[47:49] happens is Cain so so both were
[47:52] believers. You know Cain was not an
[47:53] atheist. He wasn't he wasn't someone who
[47:56] did not believe in Jehovah God. He
[47:58] wasn't worshiping someone different than
[47:59] Abel. They were worshiping the same God.
[48:02] Amen. They worshiping the same God. So
[48:04] here was Cain with his his sincerity.
[48:06] Abel was as sincere as Cain. But they
[48:09] brought the wrong they brought the wrong
[48:11] worship to God. Now one's one's worship
[48:14] was very dignified. It was very, you
[48:16] know, there there was no blood. There
[48:18] was nothing gruesome about it. It was
[48:19] fruit and flowers and beautiful things
[48:21] on the altar. and you know is way more
[48:23] Instagrammable than than than than
[48:25] Abel's offering because back in those
[48:28] days they didn't have metal tools. They
[48:29] didn't have sharp knives even. So Abel
[48:32] would have found the sharpest rock that
[48:33] he could have found and he took that
[48:34] lamb and tied a tied a vine around its
[48:37] neck took it to the altar and he started
[48:38] hacking on the neck of that lamb. Blood
[48:40] started going everywhere. The cry of the
[48:42] lamb. Who's ever seen a sheep or a lamb
[48:44] slaughtered? It's not a pretty thing,
[48:47] right? It's not a it's not a nice thing.
[48:49] It's it's you know there's there's a
[48:51] cries of pain and there's a struggle and
[48:53] you know the nerves of the thing are
[48:54] still kicking after it's dead and if I'm
[48:56] talking too fast I'm sorry okay I'll try
[48:58] and slow down but you know but you see
[49:00] that you know but so so one was one was
[49:02] very you could say emotional there was a
[49:05] lot of blood there was blood there was a
[49:07] lot of noise there was a lot of you know
[49:09] disturbance and one was very silent and
[49:11] dignified and looked so good now one was
[49:15] accepted and one was rejected now Abel
[49:18] because God came and spoke to Cain
[49:19] because Cain was wroth. He was angry
[49:21] because his sacrifice was not accepted.
[49:24] And then so Cain would actually, you
[49:25] know, God would come and speak to Cain
[49:27] and and and God would say to Cain, just
[49:29] worship like your brother did. You may
[49:31] not understand what he's doing exactly,
[49:33] but I gave him the revelation. There was
[49:35] blood in the garden. It was a blood sin
[49:36] and blood is required. And that's why
[49:38] he's brought the lamb. He knows what
[49:40] he's doing by revelation. And then so
[49:42] what happens is is that is that Cain did
[49:44] not accept what God told him to do. And
[49:46] what did he do? He tried to kick Abel
[49:49] off the road. Amen. Because there's
[49:51] always remember we are walking the way
[49:53] of the highway of holiness. There's a
[49:55] way within it. It says in Isaiah and
[49:57] there's and you know a road is always
[49:58] built that there's the highest point is
[49:59] in the middle of the road. Okay? And
[50:01] it's built that way because if a road is
[50:03] flat and it rains then there'll be big
[50:05] puddles of water. You'll be driving
[50:06] along. You'll start hydroplaning. That
[50:08] means you'll have no grip on the road
[50:10] and you'll slide off into the ditch. But
[50:12] if a road is built correctly when the
[50:13] rain comes down it washes everything off
[50:16] into the gutters. All right. So, what
[50:17] happens is the effect of twins is
[50:19] basically is there things will come upon
[50:21] the road. We'll try and knock you off
[50:23] one side or another. And the and the
[50:26] ditches have many names and many things,
[50:28] but there's always a challenge. Can we
[50:30] stay in the middle of the road? And Abel
[50:33] would not back down because remember
[50:34] Canaan confronted his brother about his
[50:36] worship. He confronted him about his
[50:39] walk with God. And because Abel was
[50:41] walking by revelation, he wasn't willing
[50:43] or even did not allow Cain to back down.
[50:46] yo yo to to let him intimidate him to
[50:48] say look Kane actually you're right I
[50:50] should have done like you yeah this was
[50:51] too messy and it was out of hand and it
[50:53] was out of order and it just became yeah
[50:56] yeah I know you know I was you was noisy
[50:58] and all these things he did not back
[50:59] down for a second he said God gave me
[51:01] the revelation that it's blood and and
[51:04] that's it was a lamb and I and I
[51:06] worshiped God according to how he wanted
[51:09] to be worshiped and what happened is God
[51:11] and look look Cain just do like I did
[51:13] look at the proof of it in my life look
[51:15] at the vindication God living,
[51:16] fulfilling his word in my life. Is this
[51:18] so bad? Is this really such a bad thing?
[51:20] But the problem is when it comes to the
[51:22] effect of twins of a of a religious
[51:24] spirit and the spirit of God is that
[51:26] religious spirit always try and destroy
[51:29] the effects of God moving. Always try
[51:31] and bring it down to a formal worship
[51:33] where God doesn't live. There's no
[51:35] freedom. Amen. To praise God. And and as
[51:38] we go through this, it's not all about
[51:39] the noise.
[51:41] &gt;&gt; You be yourself. See, we must have
[51:43] liberty to be ourselves. Amen. If we're
[51:45] naturally noisy, be noisy. If we're
[51:48] naturally be quiet, be quiet. But don't
[51:50] don't be quiet because because you feel
[51:52] that's more reverent. Or don't be noisy
[51:54] because you feel that's more spiritual.
[51:56] There's always that pressure of emotion
[51:58] or no emotion and all these things. Just
[52:00] be you.
[52:01] &gt;&gt; Just let God work through you. If he
[52:03] wants you to run the aisles, that's
[52:05] fine. As long as it's God doing it. You
[52:06] want to start crying, cry. Let it out.
[52:08] Let God impact you. Amen. We must never
[52:11] let God, you know, the enemy try and
[52:13] push us into a mold that we have to be a
[52:15] certain way. Well, I'm just reserved and
[52:18] my family's all reserved. Well, that
[52:19] doesn't mean you have to be reserved or
[52:21] my family's all loud and shouty and I
[52:23] should be that way. You don't have to be
[52:25] that way. You be you in c in Christ,
[52:28] right?
[52:29] &gt;&gt; As God moves, move with him. Amen. Abel,
[52:32] the spirit of God moved upon Abel. He
[52:34] moved with their spirit. He gave the
[52:35] lamb.
[52:37] Amen. So there's always every revival
[52:39] brings forth twins. And we know the end
[52:41] of the um end of the story there with
[52:42] Cain and Abel. Cain kills Abel to
[52:44] destroy the effect of his of his
[52:46] worship.
[52:48] And those two spirits have come down
[52:50] through into 2025. As Jesus would say, I
[52:53] don't think I have it here in my notes,
[52:54] but he says, "I am the true vine and ye
[52:57] are the branches." He didn't say, "I am
[52:59] the vine." He said, "I am the true
[53:01] vine." So if there's a true vine,
[53:03] there's got to be a false vine also. And
[53:06] so the reason he's saying he's the true
[53:07] vine is saying look these two vines are
[53:09] going to grow and they grew out of Eden.
[53:11] They came all the way down through the
[53:12] Old Testament into the new and here it
[53:15] is today. Now as I say this morning,
[53:17] this is not about pointing out people
[53:19] and saying this person's false. This
[53:21] person that's really got nothing to do
[53:22] with it. The whole thing is we got to
[53:24] walk with the revelation of the word.
[53:26] We're to let God be God in our lives. We
[53:28] cannot never let the any side push us
[53:30] one way or another. We're going to stay
[53:32] in the middle of the road by the grace
[53:34] of God with our hearts full of love,
[53:35] rejoicing, loving the Lord and loving
[53:37] everybody. Amen. Cuz we got to realize
[53:39] that there will be times in our life
[53:41] where we are pushed into a ditch. Amen.
[53:44] By a spirit, by an influence, by these
[53:46] things. It doesn't mean we're trash. It
[53:48] just means we're being pushed into the
[53:50] ditch. But God doesn't want us to stay
[53:51] in that ditch. You know, there's always
[53:53] a season in our Christian walk where
[53:55] people are legalistic. Brother Bram says
[53:57] it's the first phase of Christianity
[53:58] actually is an intellectual legalistic
[54:00] walk. And that can be that. But that
[54:02] doesn't mean those people are Pharisees.
[54:03] It just means that they're in their
[54:04] legalistic phase. Amen. But then once
[54:06] God really gets a hold of them, they see
[54:08] it's purely the grace of God. They come
[54:10] out of it. But then there's always the
[54:12] danger of going an extreme the other way
[54:13] because well, I was legalistic. Now I'm
[54:15] coming this way and you and you go
[54:17] extremely liberal. No. But if the spirit
[54:19] of God is within your heart, he will
[54:20] keep you down the middle of the road and
[54:22] you stay surrendered to him. Amen. So,
[54:24] it's very important, friends, that we
[54:25] don't allow what's going on around us
[54:29] influence us into one ditch or the
[54:31] other. We're going to walk down the
[54:32] road. And it doesn't matter how close it
[54:34] comes into your family. Could be could
[54:36] be anyone very, you know, very close to
[54:38] you. But you see, we must keep walking
[54:40] with the Lord. Amen. In the middle of
[54:42] the road, believing that the spirit of
[54:44] God within us will correct the error if
[54:47] it's around us.
[54:49] Amen. Are we all together so far? I
[54:51] mean, I love these kind of studies, you
[54:53] know, it's it's really neat. Amen.
[54:56] Brother Bram says this here. He says,
[54:57] "Now look, as I'm born of the Holy
[54:59] Ghost, what difference does it make as
[55:01] long as I'm on my road to heaven?" What
[55:03] difference does it make when people say,
[55:04] "As long as we're walking in the
[55:06] spirit," and all that's born of the
[55:07] spirit of God, led by the spirit of God.
[55:10] Sons and daughters of God are led by the
[55:11] spirit of God. Always walking in the
[55:13] beautiful light of holiness,
[55:14] cleanliness. But Esau, that birthright
[55:16] was, he was carnal like the world. So,
[55:19] it didn't make any difference to him. He
[55:20] thought he was religious and his papa
[55:22] and mama was religious and that was good
[55:24] enough for him. But we find out that in
[55:25] every revival that's ever been born in
[55:27] the world, it produces twins. That's
[55:29] right. Every revival has twins. They had
[55:32] a bunch in there that's carnal believers
[55:34] and a bunch of spiritual believers.
[55:35] Every revival produces that. An Esau and
[55:39] a Jacob's. Every revival, the message
[55:41] has produced twins. We might as well
[55:44] bring it into today.
[55:45] &gt;&gt; Amen. You say, "Well, who you pointing
[55:47] out?" No one. But the effects of it, we
[55:49] must be very aware of these things.
[55:51] Amen. Because Esau was a natural man.
[55:53] His father actually liked him more than
[55:55] Jacob. But there was one thing about one
[55:57] thing about Jacob that God liked. He
[56:00] wanted that birthight. He wanted that
[56:03] birthight. Amen. He didn't care what he
[56:05] had to do, who he had to cheat, whatever
[56:07] had to happen, whatever the fallout was.
[56:08] Cuz remember, Esau got so mad, he wanted
[56:10] to kill him. He was willing to live with
[56:12] the consequences of receiving that
[56:14] birthright. And friends, when you have
[56:16] that longing in your heart, I must have
[56:18] the baptism of the Holy Ghost, which is
[56:20] our birthright today. I must have the
[56:22] seal of God. I don't care what people
[56:24] say. I don't care what the fallout's
[56:25] going to be. If my friends will leave
[56:27] me, so be it. If my family leaves me, so
[56:29] be it. Amen. If ever makes fun of me, so
[56:31] be it. Amen. I want that birthright. I
[56:34] want to walk with God. I want every
[56:36] divine blessing that he has. Amen. If
[56:38] you have that in your heart, Amen. Don't
[56:40] worry about the fallout. Amen. Who wants
[56:42] to see a real God?
[56:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. who is hungry for the real God.
[56:46] Amen. Not just an idea, not just a form,
[56:48] not just a religion or a nice idea or
[56:50] something to put on the fridge as a
[56:52] quote, but the living reality of God.
[56:54] Amen. I tell you what, friends, if that
[56:55] is burning in your heart, amen, you're a
[56:57] Jacob. Amen. You're not willing. You You
[56:59] don't want to sit down as an Esau and
[57:01] just go through the motions. No, you
[57:03] want the fire of God to burn. Amen. To
[57:05] live in our lives. Thank you very much.
[57:06] I'm going to need that soon. Amen.
[57:08] Appreciate that. Amen. But you see, you
[57:10] see, there must be something in us that
[57:11] we want the reality. Amen. and we're not
[57:14] willing even just to talk about someone
[57:15] else's testimonies. I'm going to tell
[57:17] you what the I love talking about the
[57:20] prophet's testimonies.
[57:23] But if that's all we have, it's just a
[57:24] painted fire. Amen. If that's all you
[57:27] have is a reality of God that's just a
[57:29] painted fire. But God never wanted us
[57:31] just to talk about his testimonies. He
[57:33] wanted you to have your own testimony.
[57:34] Amen. He wanted you to know that same
[57:36] God. Amen. That should be the thrust of
[57:38] our life. Amen. Is that God would be
[57:40] known. God would be declared. God would
[57:42] be experienced. Amen. That it wouldn't
[57:44] just be an intellectual understanding,
[57:45] but it be a reality of God.
[57:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's a Jacob. He lives, man.
[57:52] &gt;&gt; He's not dead. God's not dead. He lives.
[57:54] He's alive and well. He's the same
[57:55] yesterday, today, and forever. But we
[57:58] shouldn't let we shouldn't let that Esau
[58:00] natural mentality of, well, just just
[58:02] just conform to a message mold. That's
[58:05] not that ain't going to take you in a
[58:07] rapture. Well, I just conformed to
[58:09] Shikina Tabernacle and this is how my
[58:11] parents are, so I'm like this. Or this
[58:13] is how the brothers are, so I'd be like
[58:14] this. Or the sisters. We're not called
[58:16] to conform to a mold. We're moldless.
[58:19] Amen. We don't have any mold. We're not
[58:21] moldy either. Amen. We're not stale.
[58:23] We're living. But you see, we don't have
[58:24] some form to conform to. The only thing
[58:26] is you say, "God, let me conform to the
[58:28] image of your word." That's the only
[58:30] form we should be conformed to. And
[58:32] that's not by intellectual gymnastics.
[58:34] It's by God living in our lives.
[58:36] &gt;&gt; Amen. So every revival brings forth
[58:39] twins
[58:41] &gt;&gt; and you can and and and this is not just
[58:43] twins as in born from the same mother or
[58:45] father, but it's two risen up within a
[58:47] movement of a revival.
[58:50] Amen. The revival in Jesus's day brought
[58:52] forth twins.
[58:54] Judas was from the same tribe Jesus was
[58:57] from. He was from Judah. This is this is
[59:00] uh meant to be a scene of Judas
[59:02] betraying Jesus in the garden.
[59:04] So it brought forth twins.
[59:07] One was the Messiah. One was Jesus said
[59:09] the son of predition. And here they
[59:12] were. It produced this this move of God.
[59:16] That's the greatest move. You could say
[59:18] Messiah being born. Messiah coming to
[59:20] take away the sins of the world. Messiah
[59:22] resurrecting. Messiah pouring himself
[59:24] into his church. Amen. The greatest, you
[59:27] could say the greatest week of history,
[59:29] Brother Am said, was the death, burial,
[59:30] resurrection of our Lord Jesus Christ.
[59:32] But you see it also produced a a Judas
[59:35] and then that revival brought forth a
[59:37] harvest because there was Jesus. Brother
[59:40] Ram says that many times you know many
[59:42] times we just think of three crosses
[59:44] there on Goltha but there was four.
[59:47] This is the harvest that brought there
[59:49] was there was Jesus and there was the
[59:51] there was Jesus and the two thieves but
[59:54] you know he was between those two
[59:56] thieves. One was the repentant thief.
[59:59] Jesus took him. That was the harvest.
[1:00:02] But then Judas died because he hung
[1:00:05] himself when Jesus was crucified. And he
[1:00:07] took that son of predition took the
[1:00:09] unrepentant thief to hell. That was the
[1:00:12] harvest of that revival. Now Judas Judas
[1:00:14] was such a man that when Jesus would
[1:00:16] stand at the you know sit rather at the
[1:00:19] last Passover at the Passover feast and
[1:00:21] he just declares one of you is going to
[1:00:23] betray me tonight. They didn't all
[1:00:24] naturally point their fingers and say ah
[1:00:26] it's Judas. They were wondering among
[1:00:29] themselves Lord is it me? Is it me? Is
[1:00:30] it me? They had no idea that it was
[1:00:33] Judas. But you see, it was Judas. But
[1:00:37] that's how much of a believer he looked
[1:00:39] like. But and that's how close it was to
[1:00:42] deceive the very elect even if it was
[1:00:44] possible. And you see what happened is
[1:00:46] Judas now because really what caused the
[1:00:49] crucifixion.
[1:00:50] The scribes and Pharisees in the
[1:00:52] background of this picture, they had
[1:00:53] meetings. They planned. They wanted to
[1:00:55] destroy the Messiah. It's amazing. The
[1:00:58] more supernatural he did, the more
[1:00:59] scripture he vindicated, the more he
[1:01:01] proved, Amen, that he was the Messiah,
[1:01:03] the more they wanted to kill him. And
[1:01:05] they wanted to kill Lazarus as well
[1:01:07] after he was resurrected. That's
[1:01:09] insanity, isn't it? They But you see,
[1:01:11] the spirit wants to kill the effects of
[1:01:13] a testimony. That's why we should never
[1:01:15] back down and just say, you know, forget
[1:01:16] our testimonies. We should keep our
[1:01:18] testimonies fresh and alive. Amen. And
[1:01:21] rehearse them and tell our children
[1:01:23] God's alive and he's the same yesterday,
[1:01:25] today, and forever. You say, "Well, that
[1:01:27] becomes redundant." That doesn't become
[1:01:29] redundant. No, because it keeps God
[1:01:31] alive in our midst. Amen. Because it
[1:01:32] keep the memory. If God could do it for
[1:01:34] me back then, and remember, God's
[1:01:36] eternal. So, what is a few years to him?
[1:01:38] Nothing. Amen. It's like he just did it
[1:01:41] a second ago in his timing.
[1:01:44] Amen. So, we should never let these
[1:01:46] things become just nothing. We should
[1:01:47] share the testimonies of the prophet of
[1:01:49] God. Absolutely. We should share the
[1:01:51] testimonies of ourselves. You know a
[1:01:54] good thing to do? You want to start a a
[1:01:55] stir among the church? Young people, you
[1:01:58] want to start a stir among the church?
[1:01:59] I'm looking for a Yep. A something, a
[1:02:01] nod, a blink, a breath or something.
[1:02:03] Good. Ask the older ones how the how God
[1:02:05] found them.
[1:02:07] &gt;&gt; Ask the older ones, where did God find
[1:02:08] you? What's your story? And that will
[1:02:11] begin to create a stir because maybe a
[1:02:13] testimony they've nearly nearly
[1:02:15] forgotten, they'll bring out of the
[1:02:16] attic and dust the cobwebs off and read
[1:02:18] it to you of their own life. And it'll
[1:02:20] become alive and fresh to them. Amen.
[1:02:23] It'll become a living reality again to
[1:02:24] them. So create a stir. I dare you. I
[1:02:27] double dare you. It's not cringe.
[1:02:31] Okay? It ain't whatever the I won't go
[1:02:34] there cuz then you'll start cringing at
[1:02:35] me. But you see, it's not it's not a bad
[1:02:37] thing. No, you want to stir the church
[1:02:39] up. Ask the older ones, "Where did God
[1:02:40] find you? What happened to you? Why are
[1:02:43] you here?"
[1:02:45] &gt;&gt; Amen. I tell you what, you'll God will
[1:02:47] step into that kind of a fellowship.
[1:02:50] &gt;&gt; Amen. I challenge you to do that. That's
[1:02:53] your homework. Praise the Lord. Bail
[1:02:55] them up in the in the foyer there after
[1:02:57] service. Amen. But you see what happened
[1:02:59] is those those scribes and Pharisees,
[1:03:01] they wanted to destroy Jesus, but they
[1:03:04] couldn't do it. And isn't it amazing?
[1:03:06] They had all the machinery to do it.
[1:03:07] They had the soldiers. They had all
[1:03:08] these things. But it took someone within
[1:03:11] the revival to bring the betrayal. He
[1:03:14] was the door. Judas was the door to
[1:03:16] actually bring them in to bring this
[1:03:18] betrayal. Why? Because Judas knew, I
[1:03:21] knew, he knew where the Messiah went. He
[1:03:24] knew actually how to take the Messiah
[1:03:26] out of the revival. He knew how to try
[1:03:28] and kill its effects, kill his effects
[1:03:31] among the people. Of course, it
[1:03:32] backfired gloriously upon him. Amen. And
[1:03:35] it, you know, upon the enemy, but you
[1:03:37] see that, see, it's it's always someone
[1:03:38] within the inside. Now, once again, I'm
[1:03:40] not trying to I'm not pointing fingers
[1:03:42] and I look you in the eye. I'm not
[1:03:43] looking you in the eye for for purpose,
[1:03:45] right? Okay. I just like to look at
[1:03:46] people in the eye because I I want to
[1:03:48] see you still awake. you know, you
[1:03:49] haven't changed the channel on me or
[1:03:51] flipped to the next video, you're here.
[1:03:52] Okay? So, this is why I like to do it.
[1:03:54] But you see, now what happens is that
[1:03:55] that it was Judas that knew how to bring
[1:03:57] the bring the betrayal about
[1:04:00] and it why and because it's always
[1:04:02] within the framework of the church of
[1:04:04] the of the revival where where these
[1:04:07] things happened. So, it was four crosses
[1:04:09] that day. Four crosses that day on um on
[1:04:13] Calvary if I you know, if I could put it
[1:04:15] that way. And it's the same thing today.
[1:04:20] That spirit hasn't died. Brother Ram
[1:04:22] says that God will take his man but he
[1:04:24] leaves his spirit upon the earth. Satan
[1:04:26] takes his man but he leaves his spirit
[1:04:28] upon the earth. And so this the same
[1:04:31] thing has come down and there's always a
[1:04:33] battle between the formal and the
[1:04:35] spiritual. The Esau and Jacob spirit.
[1:04:38] And he would say in the Ephesian church
[1:04:39] age now remember each church has its
[1:04:41] formals and each church has its
[1:04:42] spirituals. That's the twins that's born
[1:04:45] in every revival and and lives in every
[1:04:47] church.
[1:04:49] They started right in this age and ends
[1:04:51] up in this age and finally the formals
[1:04:52] took took it over in the Thitara age and
[1:04:55] Luther pulled it back again and now it's
[1:04:57] swinging back uh right back in again.
[1:05:00] Can you see that formal religion?
[1:05:01] There's no difference uh between that
[1:05:03] and uh and Catholicism. It's all the
[1:05:06] same thing. Every organization is
[1:05:07] butchered right into it. God never did
[1:05:09] organize this church. Is exactly what
[1:05:11] they was trying to do here. and you
[1:05:13] watch and see how if it isn't right just
[1:05:15] show you how cursive or organization is
[1:05:18] it was foreign to the new church the New
[1:05:20] Testament church see there's always this
[1:05:22] formal church formal spirit comes in
[1:05:24] among the revival to try and kill the
[1:05:27] revival that's why we got to stay in the
[1:05:29] middle of the road we cannot let this
[1:05:32] thing you say well we're in the message
[1:05:33] we're in the last move of God before the
[1:05:35] rapture we're immune to these things we
[1:05:36] ain't immune to nothing we ain't immune
[1:05:39] to the you know the devil wants to make
[1:05:40] this church formal lukewarm and
[1:05:42] powerless. That's what he wants to make
[1:05:44] your life formal, lukewarm, and
[1:05:46] powerless. That's what he wants to do.
[1:05:48] Cuz he's afraid if you really take a
[1:05:50] stand on the word, if you really take
[1:05:51] God at his word, Amen. he will fall at
[1:05:53] your feet every time. Amen. You'll o
[1:05:56] overcome him in every circumstance.
[1:05:57] Amen. Why? Because the overcomer lives
[1:05:59] within you. Amen. But if you become
[1:06:01] lukewarm, formal, and powerless, then he
[1:06:03] can ride over you all he wants. I think
[1:06:05] I believe I'm looking at a people that
[1:06:07] aren't formal. They're not lukewarm.
[1:06:09] They're not powerless. Amen. But they're
[1:06:11] on fire. They have a heartfelt religion.
[1:06:13] They love the Lord. And they're
[1:06:14] powerful. Amen. Because why are they
[1:06:16] powerful? Because whenever the enemy
[1:06:17] comes in like a flood, amen, they go to
[1:06:19] their source of strength, the word of
[1:06:21] God, and they look to God for their
[1:06:23] direction. Amen. And they stand still in
[1:06:25] the trial knowing that God is going to
[1:06:26] undertake, God's going to overcome.
[1:06:29] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. That's who you are this
[1:06:30] morning. Amen. We ain't some formal
[1:06:32] bunch going through some message ritual.
[1:06:34] No, sir. No. We live to see the power of
[1:06:36] God manifested. Amen. We believe this
[1:06:38] word because it's God manifested in this
[1:06:40] age.
[1:06:42] Hallelujah. I think if there's a people
[1:06:43] that should be enthused, it should be
[1:06:45] us. Amen. We should not be
[1:06:47] disinterested. The devil wants to make
[1:06:48] you disinterested in this word. I tell
[1:06:51] you what, I'd rather have something that
[1:06:52] can raise the dead, heal the sick, cast
[1:06:55] out the devil, bring a joy, and
[1:06:56] speakable, full of glory. Amen. Can
[1:06:58] bring peace to my soul. I'd rather have
[1:07:00] that than anything of the world that
[1:07:02] tries to just cover up these things and
[1:07:04] makes us just lukewarm, formal, and
[1:07:06] powerless. But these spirits are always
[1:07:08] within the framework of the church. Now
[1:07:10] this would even begin uh in the book of
[1:07:12] acts. Now you look at think of the book
[1:07:14] of acts there was the day of pentecost.
[1:07:16] Amen. Where the fulfillment of the ages
[1:07:18] was God living in man once again was
[1:07:20] living among them. Hallelujah. And not
[1:07:22] just the Jews and spread to the Gentiles
[1:07:24] as well. God was calling out his bride
[1:07:26] for his name's sake. A people for his
[1:07:28] name's sake. And then isn't it amazing?
[1:07:30] Here comes Peter, uh, Paul and Barnabas,
[1:07:32] you know, and, you know, they were they
[1:07:34] were having such a glorious time seeing
[1:07:36] God had opened the door to to us
[1:07:38] Gentiles who weren't even in the program
[1:07:40] of God. But yet, there's these people
[1:07:42] who stand up and say, "Except they be
[1:07:44] circumcised after the manner of Moses,
[1:07:46] ye cannot be saved." That's a twin.
[1:07:50] Unless you conform to this churchity,
[1:07:54] unless you conform to this tradition,
[1:07:56] which was a dead tradition, I think away
[1:07:59] with dead things. I don't like dead
[1:08:00] things unless it's a steak on my bri.
[1:08:03] I'm not interested about dead things.
[1:08:05] Amen. I don't want some dead religion.
[1:08:07] I'm not interested in those things. I
[1:08:09] want a living God. But he says here was
[1:08:11] the living God spreading upon the earth
[1:08:13] going beyond just Israel into the
[1:08:15] Gentiles. Amen. To you the church ages
[1:08:18] was on and here these people were trying
[1:08:21] to stop it. But yet they were believers.
[1:08:30] when therefore Paul and Barnabas had no
[1:08:32] small dissension, if that's how you say
[1:08:34] that, and disputation with them. So
[1:08:36] basically, they had a big fight. They
[1:08:37] had a long discussion about this. They
[1:08:40] had intense fellowship. They determined
[1:08:41] that Paul and Barnabas and certain
[1:08:43] others of them should go up to Jerusalem
[1:08:45] unto the apostles and elders about this
[1:08:47] question. And being brought on their way
[1:08:49] by the church, they passed through fence
[1:08:51] and Samaria, declaring the uh conversion
[1:08:55] of the Gentiles, and they cause great
[1:08:57] joy unto all the brethren. Imagine that.
[1:09:00] Here comes a he here comes a couple of
[1:09:02] missionaries that God has called. You
[1:09:04] know their testimony. You know, God met
[1:09:06] him and changed his life. And they come
[1:09:08] into church. Imagine if we had here
[1:09:10] comes brother Paul and brother Barnabas.
[1:09:12] They've been on a mission trip and they
[1:09:14] stand up here and they start sharing
[1:09:16] photos and videos. We went into this
[1:09:19] place. It's a Buddhist nation or
[1:09:21] whatever nation. We went there. God led
[1:09:24] us there. We found this person and they
[1:09:26] became a believer and God healed them.
[1:09:28] There was a demon-possessed man. The
[1:09:29] spirit got cast out. This person was
[1:09:31] sick and they became healed. And you
[1:09:32] know, while we're preaching, the Holy
[1:09:34] Ghost fell upon them like it fell upon
[1:09:35] us. And here's the baptism. This is
[1:09:37] what's happening there. And pray for the
[1:09:39] work. And God, it's just exploded.
[1:09:41] Hallelujah. It's just a sovereign It's a
[1:09:43] sovereign move of God. I tell you what,
[1:09:45] friends, I was thinking about this this
[1:09:46] week. This church is a sovereign move of
[1:09:48] God. Hallelujah. We're going to keep the
[1:09:51] let the move keep moving.
[1:09:53] &gt;&gt; Amen. But then what happens? And being
[1:09:56] brought on their way by the church, they
[1:09:58] part. Yes. Okay. Verse four. And when
[1:10:00] they come to Jerusalem, they were
[1:10:02] received of the church and of the
[1:10:04] apostles and the elders, and they
[1:10:05] declared all the things that God had
[1:10:06] done with them. Okay. They just had a
[1:10:09] testimony meeting and everyone's just in
[1:10:10] awe. This has never happened before.
[1:10:13] This is new territory. This is
[1:10:15] incredible.
[1:10:17] But there rose up certain sector of the
[1:10:19] Pharisees which believe saying that is
[1:10:20] needful to circumcise them and to
[1:10:22] command them to keep the law of Moses.
[1:10:24] So imagine that we're just having a
[1:10:26] Jubilee time. Praise the Lord. The
[1:10:29] message has gone to this country. Never
[1:10:30] been there before. It's risen up
[1:10:32] believers. It's incredible what God's
[1:10:34] done. And then someone stands up say,
[1:10:35] "Uh, excuse me, brother Paul. Did you
[1:10:38] circumcise them? Did you get them to
[1:10:41] follow the conduct order of doctrine to
[1:10:43] the letter? Are they following the law
[1:10:45] of Moses? Oh, brother Paul,
[1:10:49] what does it do? It puts a dampener.
[1:10:53] &gt;&gt; It's a it's actually it's actually
[1:10:55] something that's come down to put a
[1:10:57] dampener on what God is doing and tries
[1:10:59] to actually take away from what God has
[1:11:02] done. God's just done eternal things.
[1:11:04] Put yourself there. Imagine you being
[1:11:05] one of those Gentiles, which you are.
[1:11:07] God found me. This word came my way. I
[1:11:10] was in religion up to my eyeballs and
[1:11:12] above. And then God found me, called me
[1:11:14] up, changed my life. He became a
[1:11:16] reality. And God's done such a great big
[1:11:18] work.
[1:11:19] &gt;&gt; And then someone comes along and says,
[1:11:21] "No, your experience isn't good enough.
[1:11:24] You've got to do this." See how See how
[1:11:27] the spirit worms in that that Antichrist
[1:11:30] spirit.
[1:11:31] And what does it do? It tries to push
[1:11:33] the people into a ditch. But Paul and
[1:11:35] Barnabas and them and the apostles, they
[1:11:37] said, "No, we're going to iron this
[1:11:38] thing out. We're not just going to let
[1:11:40] this thing doesn't matter where it comes
[1:11:41] from." Remember, they came to Jerusalem.
[1:11:43] Oh, this is the center. This has been
[1:11:45] this is Jeffersonville. This is where
[1:11:47] this has come from. This is all very
[1:11:48] important. We're going to give weight to
[1:11:50] this thing. If it's contrary to the
[1:11:51] word, forget it.
[1:11:53] &gt;&gt; Amen. If people say the days of miracles
[1:11:56] has passed, I say those people need to
[1:11:57] pass away and become born again.
[1:12:00] &gt;&gt; Amen. Why? because it's it's we can't
[1:12:02] just let these things push us. We've got
[1:12:05] to actually say, "No, no, God lives. I'm
[1:12:07] going to stay down the middle of the
[1:12:08] road. I'm not going to let the effect of
[1:12:10] a twin push me the other way."
[1:12:14] Okay.
[1:12:17] Amen. So, they had to they had to they
[1:12:20] had to actually spend their time and
[1:12:22] energy to sort this thing out, which to
[1:12:24] me, it just blows my mind. These
[1:12:27] Pharisees weren't believers yet, but
[1:12:29] they became within the framework of the
[1:12:31] church because if they really believed,
[1:12:34] they wouldn't be Pharisees. Do you hear
[1:12:36] Paul going around spreading Pharisee
[1:12:38] doctrine? He says, "I was a Pharisee of
[1:12:41] the Pharisees, but thanks be to God, I'm
[1:12:43] a new creation."
[1:12:45] &gt;&gt; Right? Amen. God is our joy. God is our
[1:12:49] pleasure. God is our satisfaction.
[1:12:50] That's where it belongs in here. Let God
[1:12:52] in. And then the other things are so
[1:12:54] dead they don't even you don't even care
[1:12:55] about them no more. Oh, people are very
[1:12:57] religious. Always been. As I preached
[1:12:59] the other day over here, revival always
[1:13:01] produces twins. Like Esau and Jacob, man
[1:13:03] of the world, and the revival that that
[1:13:05] desires the birthright. See, it's always
[1:13:07] there is every revival produces that.
[1:13:08] This latter day revival has done the
[1:13:10] same thing. It's true. So, let's get on
[1:13:12] the Jacob's side. The one that's going
[1:13:14] to inherit the one that's going into the
[1:13:16] promised land. And we cannot be
[1:13:17] satisfied with just going to church and
[1:13:19] putting our name on the book. Not that
[1:13:21] we have one. If we do, there's something
[1:13:23] wrong. Let's keep climbing higher and
[1:13:24] higher till we reach that promised land.
[1:13:27] I say, don't just keep until you reach
[1:13:28] the promised land, the baptism of the
[1:13:30] Holy Ghost. Inherit every divine
[1:13:32] promise. I mean, don't just cross Jordan
[1:13:35] and camp there. No, let God move you
[1:13:37] into your inheritance. Amen. Every
[1:13:38] divine promise is yours. That's why he
[1:13:41] died. Amen. That your sin would be taken
[1:13:43] away, that he come and dwell in you, and
[1:13:45] then every word that he's given would be
[1:13:46] quickened to your soul and it would be
[1:13:48] manifested in your life.
[1:13:51] So we're not here just to cabbage down
[1:13:52] on just uh keeping a bunch of rules. No,
[1:13:55] we're here to walk with Almighty God. So
[1:13:58] what had already happened there in the
[1:14:00] book of Acts is that now these twins
[1:14:02] were here and they and the formal always
[1:14:04] tries to dominate the spiritual always
[1:14:07] tries to push it off the road. And
[1:14:10] unfortunately in that age there was you
[1:14:12] know became the age of the you know the
[1:14:13] Ephesian age. And that word Ephesians
[1:14:16] means to aim at but to relax. So they
[1:14:18] aimed at the high calling in Christ. But
[1:14:20] then they relaxed and they drifted down
[1:14:22] into into formalism into Catholicism and
[1:14:25] then eventually of course the dark ages
[1:14:27] and and brother Ram would say that we've
[1:14:29] come to a time where we've come to
[1:14:30] another Ephesians again. We've come
[1:14:33] round the cycle again where now we stand
[1:14:35] and and and and and we're aiming at the
[1:14:38] high calling in Christ. But now the now
[1:14:40] the thing is are we going to just now
[1:14:43] personally now are we going to amen and
[1:14:45] just relax and coast or or are we going
[1:14:48] to take every divine promise? Amen.
[1:14:51] Every promise in the book is mine.
[1:14:54] &gt;&gt; Amen. It's healing it's mine. The
[1:14:57] baptism of the Holy Ghost is mine. Joy
[1:14:59] is mine. Peace is mine. All the
[1:15:02] inheritance that you know everything
[1:15:03] that Adam lost is mine. Amen. My
[1:15:06] position as a son of God is mine. Amen.
[1:15:09] Deliverance is mine. Whatever it is,
[1:15:11] it's mine. And it's for my family. It's
[1:15:13] for my church. It's for my neighbor.
[1:15:15] It's for my friend. Amen. It's for
[1:15:17] whosoever will. It's for them. Amen. So,
[1:15:19] we don't just want to have some
[1:15:21] catchphrases and talk about things. We
[1:15:23] want it to become a living reality. And
[1:15:25] I think a lot of things I'm just
[1:15:26] thinking, imagine all the sermons that
[1:15:28] we've heard through the years. Some of
[1:15:30] us have heard a lot of sermons. And I
[1:15:32] pray that that word that's sitting in
[1:15:34] our spirit there, it would become
[1:15:36] quickened and it become alive. Amen. It
[1:15:38] be more than just an enthused preacher,
[1:15:40] but it become a living reality in our
[1:15:42] lives. Amen. There be a God would just
[1:15:44] reach into our memory and bring those
[1:15:46] words into our hearts and then God would
[1:15:48] quicken it by the baptism of the Holy
[1:15:50] Ghost and set a new flame in our lives.
[1:15:53] &gt;&gt; Amen. Can God do that? Absolutely.
[1:15:56] &gt;&gt; Amen. Then what happened was then the
[1:15:58] church went down eventually into the
[1:15:59] dark ages but God said I will restore.
[1:16:02] Now during this restoration this the
[1:16:04] these twins came back into
[1:16:05] manifestation. Now well I guess they
[1:16:07] always there but the but the spiritual
[1:16:09] begin to revive. Now I just want to go
[1:16:11] through this cycle. There's always a
[1:16:14] cycle of revival and death right. It
[1:16:17] never fails. Brother Ram says that
[1:16:19] history keeps repeating itself. It says
[1:16:21] the generations, you know, of Israel,
[1:16:24] they see revival in one generation only
[1:16:25] see the fires fading in the next. Now, I
[1:16:28] don't want to be negative in this, but
[1:16:29] then but then there's always a cycle of
[1:16:31] revival and death. And this doesn't just
[1:16:34] happen on an age level, but it happens
[1:16:36] in a church. It happens generationally.
[1:16:38] There's a cycle, but God has given us a
[1:16:41] word to break that cycle. Amen. There's
[1:16:44] no more church ages after this. There's
[1:16:46] no more messengers after this. The Lord
[1:16:48] himself is here in word form to bring us
[1:16:51] into perfection. Amen. To full maturity.
[1:16:53] So we are living in a day where this
[1:16:55] cycle of you come in on you. God saves
[1:16:58] your soul. You're on fire for God. Then
[1:17:00] you begin to cool off and then God
[1:17:02] lights it again. God wants to break that
[1:17:05] cycle. He doesn't. Our position is not
[1:17:08] to be on fire then cool off and on fire.
[1:17:10] He wants us to be on fire and then the
[1:17:12] fire spreads. You say, "Well, how do I
[1:17:14] fan the flames?" put fuel on that fire.
[1:17:17] I mean, I've never seen someone who's
[1:17:18] lit a fire in a house and it begins to
[1:17:21] dwindle and they say, "Well, that's such
[1:17:22] a shame. What can I do to fuel it?" They
[1:17:25] just put fuel in. I mean, it's just real
[1:17:27] obvious. They just they just throw some
[1:17:28] logs in or they, you know, but the thing
[1:17:30] is a damp log will never light very
[1:17:34] well. I remember being with Gabriela,
[1:17:36] where is she? On her on her church camp.
[1:17:38] She's somewhere in here. Wherever she
[1:17:40] is. Amen. And it had been raining for
[1:17:43] weeks and you we're trying to light
[1:17:44] fires there in the bush, you know,
[1:17:46] getting getting wood from there. Nothing
[1:17:48] lit cuz it would was in its long wrong
[1:17:52] condition. Amen. But if you take that
[1:17:54] same same wood, that same moss, those
[1:17:57] same th those same things, and you dry
[1:17:59] them out, you get them in the right
[1:18:01] condition. Amen. Then those things can
[1:18:03] begin to fuel the flame. So what does
[1:18:05] that mean? If it's just in your mind,
[1:18:06] it's wet and damp. But if you let the
[1:18:08] word of God go into your heart, I say
[1:18:10] it's in the right condition for God to
[1:18:12] set it a flame. Amen. So if you want if
[1:18:15] you want more fire in your life, Amen.
[1:18:17] feed on the word of God with love and
[1:18:19] thanksgiving in your heart. Amen. And
[1:18:21] then you begin to see that flame begin
[1:18:22] to light again and get stronger and
[1:18:24] stronger. Amen. So God does not want us
[1:18:27] to be Amen. He He doesn't want us to go
[1:18:30] through the cycle of revival and death,
[1:18:32] but he wants that cycle to be just
[1:18:34] revival. Amen. that that the fire of
[1:18:36] God, the reality of God will just keep
[1:18:38] burning day by day in a greater
[1:18:40] manifestation. Amen. Where the joy of
[1:18:42] the Lord becomes greater. It becomes
[1:18:44] uncontainable. Amen. That the peace of
[1:18:46] God that pass all understanding, it just
[1:18:48] becomes so so massive, so great to you.
[1:18:50] Like, man, Lord, I can't even contain
[1:18:52] this blessing. Amen. Your reality is too
[1:18:54] great for me. Lord, Lord, I don't want
[1:18:55] you to take it from me, but such a
[1:18:57] massive. Who's ever just kind of
[1:18:58] staggered under the impact of the joy of
[1:19:01] God, the peace of God, the love of God?
[1:19:03] Man, I can't contain this. I remember
[1:19:05] when the Lord first filled my heart with
[1:19:07] his love. I was washing dishes at a
[1:19:08] part-time job and the love of God filled
[1:19:10] my heart. It changed my life, but I
[1:19:12] thought, man, I can't even contain this.
[1:19:14] It's so great. Hallelujah.
[1:19:16] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:19:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:20] We aren't called to settle down.
[1:19:22] &gt;&gt; We will settle down at the marriage
[1:19:23] supper of the lamb. Amen. Then we'll sit
[1:19:26] there. It'll come out and wipe all our
[1:19:27] tears from our eyes. But until then,
[1:19:29] let's not settle down for nothing. Amen.
[1:19:32] Let's not let any kind of thing push us.
[1:19:34] I I see time's running away, but I just
[1:19:36] want to use this example here of the
[1:19:38] Methodist movement. You know, the
[1:19:40] Methodist movement did not start how it
[1:19:42] is now.
[1:19:44] Let's just have this. This is a bit of
[1:19:46] chat GPT and a few other things that I
[1:19:48] just kind of merged together. This is
[1:19:49] the Methodist movement in a nutshell.
[1:19:51] So, in its beginnings, it was highly
[1:19:53] emotional. It was revivalist outdoor
[1:19:56] testimony driven. It wasn't cold and
[1:19:59] formal. There was a there was emotion
[1:20:01] around it. Amen. There was a fervor.
[1:20:03] There's a ferveny. There was a passion
[1:20:05] to know his word. A passion to see the
[1:20:08] lost be found. Amen. But then as this
[1:20:11] progressed, CC see it started off as
[1:20:12] this revival. But then as the centuries
[1:20:14] went along and begin to cool off. So
[1:20:17] from the 1800s and 1900s, it's still
[1:20:19] revivalist but increasingly structured
[1:20:22] circuit and camp meeting strong pushed
[1:20:24] to formalize worship. See, there was a
[1:20:27] there was a lot of a lot of a lot of
[1:20:29] circuit riders and they still had that
[1:20:31] old fire revival going on. But the
[1:20:33] churches that were within the cities,
[1:20:36] those pastors that went to a Bible
[1:20:38] college and they had a structure of
[1:20:40] worship, they begin to try and push down
[1:20:42] the revival meetings because they didn't
[1:20:45] want to appear strange to society. They
[1:20:48] wanted to conform. They wanted to be
[1:20:50] like everyone else that they became more
[1:20:52] accepted. Friends, the gospel will never
[1:20:54] be accepted by the unbeliever if they
[1:20:56] stay an unbeliever. I mean, the spirit
[1:20:57] of God is contrary to the spirit of the
[1:20:59] world. I mean, we cannot polish this
[1:21:02] thing up to make it palatable. It's only
[1:21:04] palatable to the elected. I mean, it's
[1:21:06] palatable to those who are hungry and
[1:21:08] thirsty who want it. Amen. We don't have
[1:21:10] to change the menu. Don't have to change
[1:21:12] the diet to match the world to make it
[1:21:14] seeker friendly. I tell you what Jesus
[1:21:16] said, if I be lifted up, I'll draw all
[1:21:18] men to myself. And that's how it becomes
[1:21:20] seeker friendly cuz those who are
[1:21:21] seeking him will find him.
[1:21:23] &gt;&gt; Amen. And then what happened? It became
[1:21:26] more structural. Hymn and sermon
[1:21:28] centered, quieter, more like Anglican
[1:21:31] tradition. This is this is how it
[1:21:32] became. And then today it's mostly
[1:21:34] formal, sometimes contemporary, small
[1:21:36] groups remain and revivals are largely
[1:21:39] gone. Amen. They'd have camp meetings
[1:21:41] where where where the preacher would
[1:21:43] stand up and preach about the gates of
[1:21:45] hell and sinners got, you know, going to
[1:21:47] perish and God's able to save and the
[1:21:49] whole campground would come under the
[1:21:51] anointing of God and sinners would weep
[1:21:53] their way to the mourner's bench.
[1:21:54] There'd be a general sorrowful cry for
[1:21:56] their lost lost state that but but then
[1:21:59] the preacher would change about how
[1:22:00] Jesus saves and he's the way and his
[1:22:02] blood is more than enough. And there'd
[1:22:04] be a jubilee erupt over the crowd.
[1:22:05] People would rejoice and dance in the
[1:22:07] spirit. That's how their revivals were.
[1:22:10] What a what what a far cry to what it is
[1:22:12] today. And now I'm not bashing the
[1:22:14] Methodist church. I'm just saying this
[1:22:16] is what happens when the formal twin
[1:22:18] pushes the spiritual twin out. Amen. And
[1:22:21] then what happened is it just see the
[1:22:23] fire that left main mainline Methodism
[1:22:26] is not because it died but because it
[1:22:28] migrated. Amen. Into holiness and
[1:22:30] Pentecostal churches while mainstream
[1:22:32] Methodism chose respectability and
[1:22:34] lurggical tradition. Let's just make the
[1:22:37] sermons more palatable. Let's make it
[1:22:40] more self-help and good words and nice
[1:22:44] ideas and philosophical things. Let's
[1:22:46] make it more intellectual because all
[1:22:48] the shouting, crying, and screaming and
[1:22:50] all this kind of thing, it kind of gives
[1:22:52] people the heebie-jebies,
[1:22:58] friends. You say, "Well, that's the
[1:23:00] Methodist." That same thing can happen
[1:23:01] here
[1:23:03] &gt;&gt; where the move of God is just a memory.
[1:23:05] where people crying and shouting is just
[1:23:07] a thing that's oh we've matured
[1:23:10] maturity doesn't make you dead
[1:23:13] &gt;&gt; David King David was a adopted king of
[1:23:16] Israel son of God he was well he was I
[1:23:20] don't know what age he was he wasn't a
[1:23:21] he wasn't a teenager when the ark came
[1:23:23] into his city and he was dancing amen no
[1:23:26] no he was he was he was older he was m
[1:23:28] he was matured he because he was an
[1:23:31] adopted son but he did not let but it so
[1:23:34] moved him you see when the Word moves
[1:23:35] you, let it respond.
[1:23:37] &gt;&gt; Respond. Amen. Sometimes he he wasn't
[1:23:39] all that always that way. But when the
[1:23:41] ark was coming into a city, he was so
[1:23:43] moved. We're having a revival. The word
[1:23:45] is coming home. Hallelujah. It's not far
[1:23:49] off somewhere in a Philistine land, some
[1:23:51] some cold formal place. It's come back
[1:23:53] to the heart of Israel. Hallelujah. I
[1:23:56] tell you what, friends, when you realize
[1:23:57] that same mark is coming to you, Amen.
[1:23:59] It'll give you a shout, give you a
[1:24:01] dance, give you a rejoice, and it's not
[1:24:03] an empty thing of emotion. You know the
[1:24:05] emotion is because of revelation. I mean
[1:24:07] the emotion in the dance is because God
[1:24:09] has returned to his rightful position.
[1:24:12] Hallelujah. But then there's the cold
[1:24:14] formal one. Saul's daughter, his wife,
[1:24:17] looking down from her window. Well,
[1:24:20] that's out of order. That's not what the
[1:24:22] message teaches.
[1:24:24] We didn't do that when the prophet was
[1:24:27] here. Samuel was here. But did that push
[1:24:30] David off the road? No. He said, "Look,
[1:24:33] look, honey. If you didn't like it
[1:24:35] today, watch me tomorrow."
[1:24:38] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I'm going to dance this way
[1:24:40] because I'm not doing this because of
[1:24:41] the people. I'm not doing this because
[1:24:43] of just emotion. I'm doing this because
[1:24:45] of revelation.
[1:24:46] &gt;&gt; He did not let He did not let her her
[1:24:50] push her push him, sorry, off the road.
[1:24:54] Amen. So, this can happen to us. I hate
[1:24:57] to say it, but it can happen to us. We
[1:24:59] must never let the revival fire die.
[1:25:03] Amen. Brother man said we must never
[1:25:05] lose our enthusiasm
[1:25:07] for the gospel of Jesus Christ. We must
[1:25:10] never let the spirit of revival leave,
[1:25:12] but we must keep it a flame. You say,
[1:25:16] "Well, how? Well, that's human effort."
[1:25:18] I tell you what, God has put something
[1:25:20] in your hand, your testimony, the word
[1:25:23] in your hand. He doesn't make you listen
[1:25:26] to the word. He doesn't make you live in
[1:25:28] victory. He gives you the tools to do
[1:25:30] it.
[1:25:31] &gt;&gt; He gives you a spirit to give you
[1:25:32] overcoming power. He gives you the word
[1:25:35] to feed the Holy Ghost within you. Amen.
[1:25:37] He gives you a testimony to share to
[1:25:39] make that word even more alive.
[1:25:41] Amen.
[1:25:43] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Now, where am I?
[1:25:48] &gt;&gt; Just trying to find this here. Now, so
[1:25:51] there's roads, as I said. I'm going to
[1:25:53] put some pictures here. So there's
[1:25:55] always two sides of the ditch. This and
[1:25:57] this is what's happened within the
[1:25:58] message. Some people will say if a if a
[1:26:02] church service is not emotional and
[1:26:04] people aren't on their feet, God didn't
[1:26:05] move.
[1:26:07] And then some people say it's just
[1:26:08] noise, there's nothing to it.
[1:26:11] That is not we can't we can't factor a
[1:26:15] church service if it's God or not by the
[1:26:17] expression alone.
[1:26:20] Right? Because there was a pressure once
[1:26:22] upon a time. You better be on your feet
[1:26:23] shouting and screaming otherwise you're
[1:26:25] not spiritual. And then what happens is
[1:26:28] so so that's that's just pure emotion.
[1:26:30] There's a for it's a forced way of
[1:26:32] worship. As I said in the beginning we
[1:26:34] should let God move on us how he wants
[1:26:37] to move. As long as there's an impact
[1:26:39] brother was standing there and you can
[1:26:41] watch in the deep calls the deep.
[1:26:42] Brother Bram standing behind the
[1:26:44] pullpit. The angel of the Lord is there
[1:26:45] to discern the people's hearts as they
[1:26:47] come in the prayer line. There's a man
[1:26:49] standing standing in front of the
[1:26:50] prophet. He's standing just like this.
[1:26:53] And brother says, "I can see you're
[1:26:55] excited." It goes to show you can't
[1:26:58] always tell by the outward.
[1:27:01] &gt;&gt; As long as God's working in your heart,
[1:27:04] that's the main thing, right? And then
[1:27:06] the intellectual side will say emotion,
[1:27:08] there's nothing emotion there's nothing
[1:27:10] to it. Forget it. We've gone deeper.
[1:27:12] We're in the bride age. We don't need
[1:27:13] those things. That's just Pentecostal or
[1:27:15] that's just, you know, but everything of
[1:27:17] the former ages grows into the new.
[1:27:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:22] And then the emotional see the
[1:27:24] intellectual and they say, "Well,
[1:27:26] they've got nothing to it. It's just all
[1:27:28] in the mind." If we stay in the middle,
[1:27:31] not that you that that's a heartfelt,
[1:27:34] genuine walk with God. But we shouldn't
[1:27:36] let those things sway us either way. Oh,
[1:27:39] it's not deep enough. He doesn't use
[1:27:41] enough quotes. He doesn't speak about
[1:27:43] thunders enough or seals enough or he
[1:27:45] doesn't use the catchphrases enough.
[1:27:47] Friends, this word should be so simple
[1:27:50] that a 12-year-old should be able to
[1:27:51] know what the seven seals are.
[1:27:53] &gt;&gt; Amen. What is the seven seals? It's
[1:27:55] Christ finishing his plan of redemption,
[1:27:57] which involves the rapture. Amen. New
[1:28:00] heaven and new earth. It's just a
[1:28:01] complete plan of redemption. Okay? Amen.
[1:28:04] And then what happens is there's people
[1:28:06] who have seen gifts being misused.
[1:28:09] Some people have pushed on gifts and
[1:28:11] they've seen gifts being misused. It's
[1:28:13] amazing how the devil always point out
[1:28:15] someone who's not genuine. or they'll
[1:28:17] point out flaws or something wrong in
[1:28:19] people's lives. And what does that do?
[1:28:20] It makes people push to the other side.
[1:28:23] See, it's twins, right? There's genuine
[1:28:26] gifts, right?
[1:28:28] &gt;&gt; Do you believe the Bible?
[1:28:29] &gt;&gt; You should have no twink in your Bible.
[1:28:31] Okay? Because if you don't believe in
[1:28:33] gifts, you might as well twink it and
[1:28:34] throw out that scripture. We believe the
[1:28:36] whole word here. Amen. All the gifts are
[1:28:38] present
[1:28:39] &gt;&gt; to be used as God wants them to be used.
[1:28:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. We believe in a supernatural God.
[1:28:44] But then when people lift up and they
[1:28:46] emphasize gifts and those gifts are
[1:28:48] misused or the vessel's not quite right,
[1:28:50] it'll cause the people to be pushed the
[1:28:52] other side. Oh, we're the word only. We
[1:28:53] don't need the supernatural. It's a re
[1:28:56] it's a knee-jerk reaction. Or those who
[1:28:59] just are the word only, we don't need
[1:29:00] the supernatural. Push the other way. We
[1:29:02] need gifts. Now, how that manifestation
[1:29:05] is is up to God. So you can have someone
[1:29:07] who can stand here and just talk to you
[1:29:10] very quietly and God can liberate a
[1:29:12] soul,
[1:29:13] &gt;&gt; right? Or you can have someone who's
[1:29:15] incredibly dynamic and God will use that
[1:29:18] to liberate a soul. Which one's greater?
[1:29:21] &gt;&gt; Oh, the one where it's dynamic. No, the
[1:29:24] outcome is the same. Therefore, they are
[1:29:26] equally right.
[1:29:28] &gt;&gt; But because God's not a cookie cutter,
[1:29:31] &gt;&gt; God makes us in a variety of ways. As
[1:29:33] long as God does what he wants to do,
[1:29:35] that's a genuine gift of God being used.
[1:29:37] So, we can't judge a service of power
[1:29:39] and demonstration by charisma or dynamic
[1:29:43] moves.
[1:29:44] Okay? That's why we can't, and I don't
[1:29:47] believe you do, okay? Because I've seen
[1:29:48] people who are more they stand here and
[1:29:50] talk. The spirit of God's here. There's
[1:29:52] a liberty. People are blessed, right? We
[1:29:54] have other people who run around and
[1:29:56] praise the Lord and we're blessed. Amen.
[1:29:59] So, I thank God that we're people like
[1:30:01] that. We don't just have God in a one
[1:30:03] box. Amen. But there's people, oh, we
[1:30:05] don't need the supernatural. See, but
[1:30:06] but that's a ditch, right? Because it's
[1:30:08] a knee-jerk reaction from the other. And
[1:30:10] then and then there's another one here
[1:30:12] where they see people that that that go
[1:30:14] into error with doctrines that are not
[1:30:17] fully brought out. You take the Puera
[1:30:20] doctrine where it it it brought the
[1:30:22] people into a formalism of just an
[1:30:24] intellectual understanding of no move of
[1:30:26] the spirit. Or you take the thunders
[1:30:28] movement where it was all jumping and up
[1:30:30] and down. There's a pressure if you're
[1:30:32] not on your feet clapping and shouting,
[1:30:34] you weren't spiritual. And they take
[1:30:36] certain parts of the message and they
[1:30:38] make a doctrine and they run with it.
[1:30:40] And then so people see that and then
[1:30:43] they pull the other side which is we
[1:30:44] just need the simple gospel. But Paul
[1:30:47] would say in Ephesians if you if you
[1:30:49] believe that book that you know the
[1:30:51] height, the depth, the breadth and the
[1:30:53] length and the love of God. So basically
[1:30:54] he said you know the full magnitude of
[1:30:56] the word you see but what happens is
[1:30:59] there's a knee-jerk reaction. Oh these
[1:31:01] people went to error they went to funny
[1:31:02] things so we're just going to keep the
[1:31:03] gospel simple.
[1:31:06] Both of those are ditches
[1:31:08] because what happens is that if we
[1:31:11] preach according to stay away from funny
[1:31:13] doctrines that therefore we can't preach
[1:31:15] about the thunders. There is not one
[1:31:17] thing in the message any of us should be
[1:31:19] afraid of preaching because oh but they
[1:31:21] use that quote. Who cares? The Catholics
[1:31:24] use the virgin birth.
[1:31:25] &gt;&gt; Does that mean we don't talk about that?
[1:31:27] &gt;&gt; Oh, they talk about Calvary. Does that
[1:31:29] mean we don't talk about that?
[1:31:30] &gt;&gt; We talk about it. We believe it.
[1:31:32] &gt;&gt; So why should we why should our walk be
[1:31:35] dictated to by what others have done?
[1:31:37] &gt;&gt; Who cares about them? Oh, people are
[1:31:39] just simple and the simple gospel. Let's
[1:31:41] pull away from them. No, let's just
[1:31:42] preach the full counsel of God. Let's
[1:31:45] believe the full counsel of God. I
[1:31:47] shouldn't there shouldn't be a single
[1:31:48] time that I should look in maybe the
[1:31:50] thunders and say, "I can't talk about
[1:31:51] that." Because people think I'm in the
[1:31:53] thunders group. No, I'm in the whole
[1:31:54] word group.
[1:31:57] &gt;&gt; Right. The thunders are glorious because
[1:31:58] it because it's the revelation of the
[1:32:00] seven seals, brother says, and it
[1:32:02] releases the power of God into the
[1:32:04] church to give us an overcoming life to
[1:32:06] break the cycle of revival and death. Or
[1:32:09] the perus. Well, I believe the personal
[1:32:11] presence of God is here. It's called the
[1:32:13] Holy Ghost.
[1:32:15] &gt;&gt; That's really not complicated.
[1:32:17] &gt;&gt; Oh, don't talk about that. Well, I just
[1:32:18] did.
[1:32:19] &gt;&gt; Okay. It's not scary.
[1:32:22] Oh, he's off the mercy seat. He is the
[1:32:24] mercy seat.
[1:32:26] &gt;&gt; Brother Am also says that the lamb takes
[1:32:28] the book. Amen. When all the names of
[1:32:30] that book are dipped in the blood of
[1:32:32] Jesus Christ, the revelation is come
[1:32:34] down and manifested in our midst. But
[1:32:36] the finality of it is when that last
[1:32:38] name in the lamb's book of life is
[1:32:40] dipped in blood. And he is the mercy
[1:32:42] seat. There's no Yeah, it ain't scary.
[1:32:45] But people will will hide away from
[1:32:46] these things
[1:32:48] because they're allowing a twin to push
[1:32:51] them off the road.
[1:32:56] But friends,
[1:32:58] we're called I'm just going to I'm going
[1:33:00] to wind up with this. We're called to
[1:33:02] earnestly contend for the faith that was
[1:33:05] once delivered to the saints. We're not
[1:33:07] called to earnestly contend against
[1:33:09] someone else. We're here to contend for
[1:33:12] the faith, the revelation once delivered
[1:33:14] to the saints. What was that? What What
[1:33:16] was that faith? Christ in you, the hope
[1:33:18] of glory. Amen. God living in a people
[1:33:20] once again. Amen. The full power of
[1:33:23] redemption manifested in a people. Amen.
[1:33:25] That God would live in you and I. That's
[1:33:27] the faith we need to contend for. Amen.
[1:33:29] We need to contend for the moving of the
[1:33:31] spirit. Amen. Where it's a heartfelt
[1:33:33] religion. Brother Ram said that the that
[1:33:36] the word bursts a people that are
[1:33:38] screaming ying. Acts 2:38 youngans,
[1:33:41] that's the only kind the word produces.
[1:33:43] Amen. So, we should never be ashamed of
[1:33:44] someone if they start crying, if they
[1:33:46] start shouting, if they start screaming.
[1:33:49] We should never get to a way where we
[1:33:51] look at that person say, "What's going
[1:33:52] on there?" Amen. You should hear that.
[1:33:54] If God's moving, you say, "Lord, I want
[1:33:56] what what they're having. I want, Lord
[1:33:57] Jesus.
[1:33:58] &gt;&gt; Lord, pass the cup to me. I want to I
[1:34:01] want a swing of that one." Amen. But we
[1:34:03] should never we should we should always
[1:34:05] contend. That word can earnestly contend
[1:34:07] for it's one word. what it means to
[1:34:09] struggle.
[1:34:10] Amen. As as to compete for a prize.
[1:34:14] Amen. This is not just given to us on a
[1:34:16] silver platter. We are to contend for
[1:34:18] the faith. That this message is alive.
[1:34:20] That is Jesus Christ revealed. Amen.
[1:34:22] That God lives in his people. Don't look
[1:34:24] at me blankly this morning. Amen. Our
[1:34:26] God is not a historical God. He didn't
[1:34:28] disappear in 1965. That same angel of
[1:34:31] the Lord is here among us today. Lives
[1:34:33] in you and I. He wants to prove his
[1:34:35] word. He wants to quicken that word into
[1:34:37] your life to make it live. Amen. He
[1:34:40] doesn't want it just to be something. He
[1:34:41] never dangles something far away and
[1:34:43] says you'll never obtain it. That's the
[1:34:45] devil talking to you. The word says the
[1:34:48] word of faith is neither even in thy
[1:34:49] mouth and in thy heart. Amen. And you
[1:34:51] got to realize, friends, that God has
[1:34:53] made you in a way to believe the word.
[1:34:55] Amen. To walk, Amen. Just like Abel did,
[1:34:58] up the middle of this road. Amen. with a
[1:35:00] heart full of love and joy and
[1:35:02] consideration for the lost and a piece
[1:35:04] that pass all understanding. And doesn't
[1:35:06] matter have the twins driving a semitr
[1:35:09] and tries to push you off the road.
[1:35:10] You'll say, "No, I'm walking up the
[1:35:12] king's highway because my God led me up
[1:35:15] this highway. My God purchased my
[1:35:17] salvation. My God has revealed himself
[1:35:19] to me and I am not a Christian because
[1:35:21] of what other people have done." That's
[1:35:23] why if someone offends you, just forget
[1:35:24] it. Amen. You've been hurt before, put
[1:35:27] it under the blood. Walk on with God.
[1:35:29] put a line under it and walk on. Do not
[1:35:31] live according to how people have
[1:35:33] treated you. Live according to how he
[1:35:35] treated you. Amen. He treated you with
[1:35:37] love and joy and peace. Amen. He's never
[1:35:40] Jesus has never mishandled anyone ever.
[1:35:43] Amen. He even called Judas friend.
[1:35:46] &gt;&gt; And we ain't a Judas this morning. Amen.
[1:35:48] But you see, we should live according to
[1:35:50] what God has done and who he is, not
[1:35:52] based on what anyone else does around
[1:35:54] us. What is it to thee? Follow thou him.
[1:35:58] Amen. Why should we care? Well, that
[1:36:00] person hurt me 50 million years ago.
[1:36:03] &gt;&gt; Forget it, man. Forget it. Move on with
[1:36:06] God.
[1:36:07] &gt;&gt; I've been hurt in a church before. God
[1:36:09] can heal that.
[1:36:11] &gt;&gt; Amen. We live in a different era. Praise
[1:36:13] God. God can bring healing. Well, I
[1:36:15] don't know if I can trust people. Let
[1:36:16] put your trust in God.
[1:36:19] &gt;&gt; Amen. God is trustworthy. I've been
[1:36:21] disappointed before. He will never
[1:36:23] disappoint. Trust me. I've only been
[1:36:25] walking with him since 2007, but I can
[1:36:27] say, I mean, God has never disappointed.
[1:36:30] He's always come in his time. He's
[1:36:32] always proved his word. Has it been
[1:36:33] hard? Has it been difficult at times?
[1:36:35] Absolutely. But God is more than able. I
[1:36:38] mean, you can put your full confidence
[1:36:39] in him. Doesn't matter what has
[1:36:41] happened. Don't walk by what has
[1:36:42] happened in the past. Just like when
[1:36:45] Joshua brought the children of Israel
[1:36:47] across Jordan, there was a commandment,
[1:36:49] circumcise again. I'm going to roll the
[1:36:51] reproach of Egypt off the people. What's
[1:36:53] that? That's a reproach of slavery. What
[1:36:55] they came out of, I'm going to take it
[1:36:57] from them this day that they don't have
[1:36:58] to look back and say, "We're once
[1:37:00] slaves." We say, "No, we are the sons
[1:37:02] and daughters of the most high God and
[1:37:04] this land belongs to us." Amen. It's the
[1:37:06] same thing with you and I, friends. Just
[1:37:08] leave the past in the past.
[1:37:10] &gt;&gt; Put it under the blood.
[1:37:12] &gt;&gt; Amen. You say, "Well, that was hurtful.
[1:37:15] It was painful. It nearly destroyed me."
[1:37:17] Just put it under the blood. You're
[1:37:19] still here. You're still a believer.
[1:37:20] There's something in you says, "Lord, I
[1:37:21] want you." Amen. Just focus on that
[1:37:23] pulsation and see what God will do.
[1:37:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:37:29] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:37:31] &gt;&gt; We should be like the Welsh policeman.
[1:37:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:37:36] &gt;&gt; The bride's revival's on. The awakening
[1:37:39] of the bride is here. Amen. The movement
[1:37:42] is here. Amen. Those ones from from
[1:37:45] America came over. Good sir. They're
[1:37:46] seeing this guy just about his job.
[1:37:48] Maybe swinging his bat and, you know,
[1:37:50] whistling. I'm so glad I can say I'm one
[1:37:52] of them. Whatever they're singing, you
[1:37:53] know the Welsh revival, they had a lot
[1:37:55] of singing. They had a lot of testimony.
[1:37:57] They had a lot of praise. It wasn't a
[1:37:59] formal thing. And you see where revival
[1:38:01] moves, it's not formal. If it ends up
[1:38:04] formal, it means that God has left that
[1:38:06] revival. But if there's a there's
[1:38:08] praise, there's heartfelt worship,
[1:38:10] there's singing, there's testimony. I
[1:38:12] mean, what is that? That's God moving.
[1:38:14] When God opens his word, it brings forth
[1:38:16] revival.
[1:38:17] Amen. Hallelujah. You can be like the
[1:38:20] Welsh policeman. Good sir, could you
[1:38:22] tell us where the revival is? He says,
[1:38:24] "My good brethren, you have just
[1:38:27] welcome. You've arrived at the revival."
[1:38:30] Maybe they're looking for a building,
[1:38:31] looking for some noise, looking for it.
[1:38:33] He says, "I am the Welsh revival. The
[1:38:36] Welsh revival is in me." Amen. I've been
[1:38:38] awakened. Amen. That Jesus Christ saves,
[1:38:40] he redeems, he's washed me. He's proven
[1:38:42] himself alive. I'm not the old policeman
[1:38:44] I was. I'm a new creature in Christ. The
[1:38:46] word has become personal to me. Jesus
[1:38:49] Christ stepped out of history to me.
[1:38:51] Amen. And now I am the revival.
[1:38:54] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. What about this day? Amen.
[1:38:56] When this message is so opened up Christ
[1:38:58] in its fullness. Amen. That God has
[1:39:00] revealed to you. You're not a church
[1:39:02] member. You're not even just a nominal
[1:39:04] Christian. You're not an Esau. Amen. No,
[1:39:06] you're a spiritual Jacob. Amen. You're
[1:39:08] the bride of Jesus Christ. That's why
[1:39:10] I've called you. That's why there's
[1:39:11] something in you that says, "Lord, I
[1:39:12] want more of you." It's because God has
[1:39:14] placed something in you. Lord, I'm
[1:39:17] yours.
[1:39:18] You say, "Why are you so excited? I got
[1:39:22] revived. I was dead. Now I'm alive. I'm
[1:39:25] still alive. I don't plan on becoming
[1:39:27] dead again."
[1:39:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. No. We should be able to declare
[1:39:31] there is a revival going on. Well, where
[1:39:33] is it? It's in me. I've been awakened.
[1:39:35] This is no longer just ink on paper.
[1:39:37] It's become living.
[1:39:38] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Where men would study this
[1:39:40] for decades and get nothing. You just
[1:39:42] open it here. The message becomes alive.
[1:39:44] The Bible becomes the new books. The
[1:39:46] scriptures become alive. And you see,
[1:39:48] you're not living outside the Bible in
[1:39:49] some other days. You're living in Bible
[1:39:51] days. And Jesus Christ is alive and
[1:39:53] well.
[1:39:55] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:39:57] Hallelujah. Say, "Well, I've been
[1:39:59] through a lot. Just let it go and follow
[1:40:01] him. Whatever you've been through, I'm
[1:40:04] not diminishing anything anyone has been
[1:40:06] through."
[1:40:07] Just put it under the blood.
[1:40:09] &gt;&gt; Walk on with God.
[1:40:11] &gt;&gt; Caleb and Joshua came out of slavery. It
[1:40:13] didn't define them. The word defined
[1:40:15] them. Their inheritance defined them.
[1:40:18] Jacob, I mean, Caleb never said to
[1:40:20] Moses, Moses, I mean I mean I mean I
[1:40:21] mean to Joshua. I'm a slave. Joshua,
[1:40:25] give me my mountain. He never said that.
[1:40:27] He said, I'm just as strong now as I was
[1:40:29] when God called us out of Egypt. Give me
[1:40:31] my mountain. Amen. They they realized
[1:40:34] that their slavery was not their
[1:40:35] defining identity. The word was their
[1:40:38] defining identity. Amen. And I say, let
[1:40:40] the word be our defining identity. Who I
[1:40:44] am is who Christ is.
[1:40:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. I tell you what, that'll put a
[1:40:48] praise in your step.
[1:40:50] &gt;&gt; I've been washed in the blood.
[1:40:52] &gt;&gt; I've been redeemed. I'm in his hand. I
[1:40:55] mean, I'm never out of his care. Doesn't
[1:40:57] matter what happens in life, I am secure
[1:40:59] in the rock of all ages. And now I can
[1:41:01] walk on with God in confidence. God,
[1:41:03] you're my shield. You're my strength.
[1:41:04] You're my shepherd. Amen. I don't have
[1:41:06] to settle for some lukewarm formal life
[1:41:09] of some, oh, you just got to calm down a
[1:41:11] bit. I pray we'd never calm down. I pray
[1:41:14] it gets worse. If I can use that word.
[1:41:17] &gt;&gt; Oh, I'm just not Tell you what,
[1:41:20] I used to drink. You all know this.
[1:41:22] I've, you know, I've shared this before.
[1:41:24] You take someone who's super quiet. You
[1:41:26] fill them full of beer. That mouth
[1:41:29] starts yapping. They start doing crazy
[1:41:32] stuff that they would never do when
[1:41:34] they're sober. Why? Because because they
[1:41:36] become intoxicated by something else.
[1:41:38] And now that begins to move their lives.
[1:41:41] Hallelujah. You take that into the
[1:41:43] spiritual. You say, "Well, I'm just a
[1:41:44] very reserved little church mouse. Let
[1:41:46] just take a drink. Take a drink of the
[1:41:49] goodness of God." Your mouth will start
[1:41:51] yapping on the goodness. You'll start
[1:41:53] doing things you never imagine you'll
[1:41:54] do. Why? Because you become controlled
[1:41:56] by a different spirit, controlled by a
[1:41:59] substance. This substance does not give
[1:42:00] you a hangover. Doesn't give you regret.
[1:42:03] It gives you joy, unspeakable, full of
[1:42:04] glory.
[1:42:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, I think let's let God be God
[1:42:09] in our lives. Oh, but I might have to
[1:42:11] shout or dance. Don't be afraid. You
[1:42:14] might not have to, but you just got to
[1:42:15] be willing to let him do what he wants
[1:42:16] to do.
[1:42:17] &gt;&gt; That's the thing. Oh, but what if I run
[1:42:19] the aisles? No. Just surrender to God
[1:42:22] and say, "God, do whatever you He may
[1:42:23] never call you to do those things. He
[1:42:25] may never call you to do some big
[1:42:27] shouting jumping time." That's not what
[1:42:28] it's about. It's about a full surrender.
[1:42:31] Lord, may your spirit rule in me
[1:42:34] &gt;&gt; that whatever you want to do in my life,
[1:42:37] it is done. Amen. And let's have the
[1:42:39] musicians, please this morning.
[1:42:44] Praise the Lord.
[1:42:46] Amen. So, how's it feel to be a Bobby,
[1:42:49] if that's what they're called,
[1:42:49] policeman, whatever they're called.
[1:42:51] How's it feel to be a Welsh policeman
[1:42:53] today? Praise the Lord. Just keep
[1:42:56] walking down the road. Keep walking down
[1:42:58] the middle of the road. Don't let
[1:42:59] nothing push you off on either side. I
[1:43:01] could have had a lot more examples of
[1:43:03] these things, right? Legalism,
[1:43:04] liberalism, whatever more. Just walk
[1:43:06] down the road with a heart. I I don't
[1:43:08] know if I put it up here. Yeah. Here's
[1:43:10] this. A good road is built. I'm going to
[1:43:11] finish with this. A good road is built.
[1:43:13] The highest part is in the center
[1:43:15] because it lets all the trash wash off
[1:43:17] to both sides. That's it. When a man
[1:43:18] really comes to Christ, he's got his
[1:43:20] eyes centered on Christ. If he's a
[1:43:22] little bit emotional, he'll be a
[1:43:23] fanatic. If he's a little bit cold, then
[1:43:25] he'll get on this other side and be a
[1:43:27] and just be a cucumber over on that
[1:43:29] side. See his intellectual. But the main
[1:43:32] thing is right in the middle of the road
[1:43:34] with enough spirit in you, keep you warm
[1:43:36] and moving. Amen. And knowing enough to
[1:43:39] keep yourself under obedience of the to
[1:43:41] the spirit to move just as the spirit
[1:43:43] moves, not till or or not after, just as
[1:43:46] the spirit moves. So, we should have a
[1:43:49] heartfelt genuine love of God.
[1:43:52] Amen. Let's um let's stand.
[1:43:59] Amen. I want to sing that song, Fill my
[1:44:01] way every day with love. That'll keep us
[1:44:04] on the middle, don't you think? as I
[1:44:06] walk with the heavenly dove.
[1:44:13] Amen. Oh, let me walk, blessed Lord, in
[1:44:18] the way thou has gone, leading straight
[1:44:22] to the land above.
[1:44:27] Giving cheer everywhere to the sand and
[1:44:31] the Lord. Build my way every day.
[1:44:36] [Applause]
[1:44:38] Feel my way every day.

[1:45:25] Feel my way every day with love
[1:45:31] and I

[1:47:20] every day with love.
[1:47:25] Amen. Praise the Lord. Is that your
[1:47:27] heart's desire? Fill my way. Not with
[1:47:30] grumpiness and anger and frustration
[1:47:32] against someone. No, just a love of God.
[1:47:34] Ruling, having dominion. My thought, my
[1:47:36] heart, my motive, objective, everything
[1:47:38] is just him. Amen. Praise the Lord. I um
[1:47:42] do we can we sing that song? Did you do
[1:47:44] it? Um it feels like fire sharp in my
[1:47:47] bones. Can we do that again? I like that
[1:47:49] song.
[1:47:51] Amen.
[1:47:53] Well, Jerusalem was shaken.
[1:47:57] Pentecost had arrived
[1:47:59] and up
[1:48:02] they were drunk on the new wine. Oh
[1:48:05] Jesus stood among them and there was no
[1:48:09] doubt this holy gold

[1:55:34] Amen. Praise the Lord. Amen. Let's bow
[1:55:37] heads in a word of prayer, shall we?
[1:55:39] Amen. Maybe you want to slip your hand
[1:55:40] up. Say, "Lord, keep me in the middle of
[1:55:42] your road full of love, not in a ditch
[1:55:45] somewhere pushed aside." Gracious
[1:55:48] Father, we've all been influenced or
[1:55:51] Lord, we see there's twins down through
[1:55:54] the ages. Dear God, those same spirits
[1:55:56] are here today. I just pray, Father,
[1:55:58] Lord, I didn't say this. If I I didn't
[1:56:00] want to name names or anything, Lord, if
[1:56:02] I did, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to do
[1:56:03] that. But I just want the people to
[1:56:04] know, Lord, that Father, may we never be
[1:56:07] pushed off the road or influenced by
[1:56:10] what others have done or what others are
[1:56:12] doing or what they say. But Lord, may we
[1:56:15] just walk down the middle of this way of
[1:56:17] holiness, Lord, this highway that goes
[1:56:19] up into glory, Lord, down the middle of
[1:56:21] the road, loving you, Lord, praising
[1:56:23] you, Lord, that we're Christians and how
[1:56:25] we act and what we do because of you,
[1:56:27] not because of what others have done.
[1:56:29] Father, please may you grant it, dear
[1:56:31] God. God, I prayed give us a heart full
[1:56:33] of love, Lord Jesus. May you burn a re a
[1:56:36] revival fire in our hearts, dear God.
[1:56:38] Father, I pray we just be completely
[1:56:40] surrendered into your hands that however
[1:56:42] you want to manifest yourself, Lord, may
[1:56:44] it be done for your glory. We thank you,
[1:56:46] Lord. We love you. We just want to
[1:56:48] commit ourselves into your hands in
[1:56:50] Jesus Christ's name. Amen. Amen. God
[1:56:54] bless you, friends. Just want to have
[1:56:56] your seats or how do you want to do it?
[1:56:58] &gt;&gt; To the song.
