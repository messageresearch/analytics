me now Lord bying thingss in your precious name amen amen thank you musicians and brother Josh you may have your seats [Music] put a title to it that my title is the fire of God we just turn don't read too much of my notes please give it away Luke the longer I'm a Christian the more I Marvel at God's love for us in our fallen States you know we always make mistakes daily and the Lord said to surrender and we surrender daily but we still make mistakes and the longer we walk with God the more we realize his love for us hallelu I want to start off and we're talking about um the Rich Young Ruler and the bigger um we start from from I think 19 there was a certain rich man that was clothed in purple and fine Lin and fair sumptuously every day there a certain bigger named Lazarus and he laid at his gate full of swords and desired to be fed with the crumbs which fell from the rich man's table moreover the dogs came and looked to his saws and it came to pass that the bigger died and was carried away by Angels into Abraham's bosom and the rich man died and was buried I'd like to point out here the perspective the bigger seemed poor but when he was carried away by the Angels he actually wasn't poor um yeah he was in God's hands and the rich man and and how he lifted up his eyes being in torments and seeth Abraham a far off and Lazareth in his bosom so he realized that the bigger had gone to heaven he had gone to hell and he cried and said Father Abraham have mercy on me and send Lazarus that he may dip the tip of his finger in water and kill my tongue for I'm tormented in this Flame so he was being tormented the Bible says in flame so it was it was hot not the one to paint that picture but he was in a very ugly position now this Rich Young Ruler he didn't open his life up to God he didn't surrender his order to God and let God have his Li have his gifts to use them and I would ask and encourage each and every one of you if you have a gift no matter how big or how small small give it to God cuz he can use it and he can make an impact in someone else's life and we all Impact people and I'd like to turn to Matthew 22 I want to context these two scriptures may the Lord help me you most of your Bible scholars will know this Matthew 22 Matthew 2235 to4 here we go here we go and then then one of them which was a lawyer asked him a question tempting the Lord Jesus saying Master what is the greatest commandment in the law and Jesus said unto him Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart with all thy soul and all with all thy mind this is the first and great commandment and the second is like unto it Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself so we can see here the rich man went to hell he obviously walked past the bigger and wasn't very considerate or have didn't have compassion on him and when Jesus was on Earth he said to us just to love God with all your mind your heart your soul and then to love your neighbor so there's a there's a loving spirit and my my tile is the fire of God but I want to type it with love because when the fire of God Falls in someone's life you can see a change and you can see a loving nature come through and you can see the person change and I've been down here five or six years and everyone most people say to me I've changed but I've seen pretty much everybody here changed like the Lord has worked on us and changed us and the longer we look at somebody's life the more we can see Christ in that person and the Lord Jesus working and when we see protocols come home and we see miracles it's amazing we um we love it when the Lord moves in people's lives and we are happy for the person CU most of the time you know if we had a Stony heart once or if we were a certain way with certain problems the Lord changes us and we are we're happy for our brothers and sisters when we see people go free sorry as Christians we must love the Lord with our heart soul and mind when we keep these Commandments the Lord keeps hurts the way he keeps complexes away things the world when we just if we really love the Lord and keep him one real close to us it's very hard for any complex or hurts or pain to come in because if we just love him and stay close to him when things of the world come when friends disappoint or hurt us if we're just loving the Lord he will give us a spirit of compassion understanding and forgiveness for them but in the same context if we don't you know if we fall away and get a bit carnal or we don't surrender all of our our elv that's where pain and hurt can get in and that's when we can start going down a path which it leads to Destruction for us until we really surrender back to God so I want to I'm going to tie try tie these two things back together during the service um we we want to be a living sacrifice for Jesus we want him to use us we want to be his hand we want to be his hands and feet want to be good stewards we want to fight the faith for the faith we want to lay down our lives and surrender and when and when we do that the easiest way is just to love the Lord because when we create a loving atmosphere Jesus can come in Jesus can work but if we're all hard and Stony it's not inviting the atmosphere the Holy Ghost isn't welcome because we have moved away from the greatest commandment or the great commandment sorry not the greatest and that love is something we really need can we just pull up that next slide please slide number two Jesus in Luke 620 he looking at his disciples he said blessed are you who are poor for yours is the kingdom of heaven and that was that bigger his he didn't may not have realized it he was he probably had nothing probably didn't even have a Bible hardly any clothes but the Lord seen his day and he said blessed are the poor for there is the kingdom of heaven so if you're poor Just Praise the Lord don't worry about money money doesn't matter um because if it matters God will take it away like the rich man and then you then you'll have some real problems brother brandom in the discernment of the spirit I was going to read this quote you said now there is now there is so many in the day now there is so much in the day that we live in pertaining to gifts so many people judge people by the gifts that they have well I believe that these things are gifts I believe that what we see take place is gifts and they are G god-given gifts but we if we do not use them in the right way that God intended them to be used then we can do more harm with the gifts then we could if we did not have the gifts the other night I made a statement this is why I'm reading this quote at the P saying that I would rather see Brotherly Love existing among the church if we didn't have if we didn't have one case of healing or anything else see we must know what these things are for the discernment of the spirit and he goes on to say how gifts can cause a lot of hurt if they're not used in the right place but what brother brandham is saying here is he'd rather see Brotherly Love he'd rather see the love of Christ comeing through then all the gifts of Christ we understand when there when the gifts when when that love and the gifts are in place that all operates in harmony but when the love isn't there the gifts don't act in harmony so we have to make sure that we cling to Jesus and have that love in our hearts it it does impact um when you young kids are at school you know that love people can see it on the way they you can fool a lot of people when you're a Christian sometimes but when you have that true love for people everybody knows they know you have that love and when God comes close they they they feel that change too in the Old Testament God accepted as sacrifices with fire that the Jewish people used to have a a perfect sacrifice a lamb or oxen or a bull um and and he used to look it up by fire to accept the sacrifice and and when we surrender in our lives Jesus can can he can take us well through the blood he accepts us and when he see that's what we can see when we can see someone's surrendered life in Christ through that God's fire has come down that person's life and we can see the gifts and Harmony and things change I just want to give you guys um if we can go to First Kings 18 this is an account of a a sacrifice that Elijah did um First Kings 18 verse 33 this is Elijah I I think it's Mount cell but I'm not sure I think it is yes and he had challenged the gods of Baal for a standoff for a sacrifice and they had been cutting themselves and crying and no fire came down from heaven and Elijah here in 33 he put wood and he put the wood in order and cut the bollocks and pieces and laid him on the wood and said fill four barrels with wood and poured on the burnt sacrifice and on the wood and he said do it the second time he really knew what he was talking about he do it the second time and they came back and he said do it this third time I did it the third time and the water ran around about the Altar and he filled the trench also with water and it came to pass at the time and it came to pass at the time of the offering of the evening sacrifice that Elijah the prophet came near and said Lord God of Abraham Isaac and of Israel let it be known this day that thou art God in Israel and that I am thy servant and that I have done all these things at Thy word hear me oh Lord that this people may know that thou art God and that thou H has turned their heart back again you know we love it when God turns our heart back or or soften our hearts gives a new heart fills with the spirit it's the it's exact L what we want in life without it you know we're very miserable and I'm so glad the life the Lord changed my life then the fire of the Lord fell and consumed the burnt sacrifice and the wood and the stones and the dust and licked up the water that was in the trench see he called down fire he KN he knew his position he knew where he stood on the word he knew God was with him and he called it down he challenged the gods of Baal and then here after if you read the rest of the scripture he they overtook them and and killed them and God's fire still pours out through his word in our lives if we let him if we surrender our all God's fire comes down and we can be vessels people around us when we get a opportunity to witness or the Lord when the Lord uses us people see and can experience that same fight if we are willing to surrender and give our lives fully over to Jesus here's a fire if you guys can put yourself in the moment you know Elijah he was it was a prophet he was surrounded by other people there and fire literally rained down from heaven it would have been a magnificent sight but then after when the men went and killed all the other false baale prophets and Idol worshippers you know it was a real scene it was it was intense it's the same in our day it's intense you know in the spiritual warfare we in when we're fighting unbelief and Spirits when our kids are bombarded with spirits and we're fighting them it's the same thing and we have to let that fire of God fall for the sake of all of our families our loved ones because we want them there we love them and we must surrender and let the Lord use us we check in on the Promises of God we believe his scriptures I want to turn to Isaiah 43 but now thus sayith the Lord that created thee oh Jacob and he that formed thee oh Israel fear not for I have redeemed thee and I'm so glad Jesus redeemed me and redeem you his love cared for us we all deserve to go to hell sorry if that's abrupt but it's his blood that's worthy and we're so thankful that the God died on Calvary for us we're so glad that when times of trouble come that we can rely on the Lord we call him on the seene and whether he answers us or doesn't answer us in the trials God comes down and he takes care of it no matter what the situation is whether it's a life threatening situation or whether it's just a spirit of Torment God comes on the scene we can stand on his word and we can chop through Satan and his spirits that are and his principalities that are challenging us I have called thee by thy name and thou art mine when thou passest through the waters I will be with thee this is God's promise to us and through the rivers Thou shalt not overflow thee when thou walkest through the fire thou should not be burnt at the start of my Serv there there was a fire that Lazarus was tormented by this is a different fire Satan all satan also has a fire and he torments people by it demonic spirits torment people with and and when it comes around you can feel it and when people are demon when they're possessed you know they are sometimes with how their actions are and it's not nice even the spirit of smoking you know it's a it's a demonic spirit and you can feel the torment that person's in and if you're that person you can feel the torment you know the pain but the Lord Jesus says Thou shallal not be burned with the neither shall the Flames Kindle upon thee for I am the Lord thy God the Holy One of Israel thy savior I gave Egypt for thy Ransom Ethiopia and SE before thee during this times when we go through trials whether it's be sickness whether it be Sons and Daughters going astray this is a great promise the Lord say be with us amen he said the the water shall not be flow thee during the fire of the trial shall not burn thee and the Lord also says many times in the scriptures here restore he restores what the cankerworm has taken from our lives we just believe on the Promises don't give up hope I want to flick back to John sorry not sorry but sorry I've got a couple of scriptures here just to encourage you all hopefully in your times whether you're um got jobs or whether you're at school you know the lord loves us and he wants to be able to use us he cares for us John 15 is the scripture I'm reading as the father have loved me so have I loved you continue in my continue ye in my love that I read this and I was honest and awe with how the Lord tied these scriptures together for me and hopefully they they all come together this one of the great Commandments was love the Lord thy God and when you when you love him it just it removes trouble away and if it doesn't just love him more and and and bring him into your bring him into your household your atmosphere and he'll change your circumstance see continue in my love if there's trouble just love me just worship me if you keep my Commandments you shall abide in my love even as I've kept my father's Commandments and abide in his love these things have I spoken unto you unto you that my joy might remain in you his joy and that your joy might be filled we all want to be Joy no one likes to be negative or depressed the father's Joy if we believe and concentrate on his promises that he's created a new world for us a new body that doesn't get sick or bombarded with um Spirits fighting us all the time a body that doesn't die this is this is real Joy when we get that body we're going to be really jumping for joy may we have more of the Father's Love may it consume Our Lives we uh the Bible is we're under grace the Old Testament was law The Ten Commandments as a young fellow I used to think um you know these Ten Commandments they sort of they make life a bit dull that was me but the longer I walk with Christ you realize that the this this commandment of love that God gave us and the Ten Commandments if you actually obey them God all he's doing he's trying to just to protect you you know with all the Folly the world has to offer if you disobey all the Commandments your life just ends up in turmoil it generally Falls to um abuse of other substances or um Spirits battling you down and and not having true Joy or happiness and that's why God is he set his Commandments out there to protect us he's like the mama eagle or the mama hen however you want to say and he he Broods over us and when I remember when the spirits fell here and there's been tongues interpretations and just in the song when the anointings there you know we love it when the Lord's Spirit falls on us and we and he and he he he puts his Wings Over Us and just covers us and puts love into our lives and we we love it when Jesus comes around as 1 Peter 1:7 that the trial of your faith being much more precious than gold that perishes that perisheth though it be TR with fire might be found unto praise and glory and honor at the appearing of CH Jesus Christ whom having not seen ye love in whom though now ye see him not yet believing ye Rejoice with joy unsp unspeakable full of Glory receiving the end of your faith even the salvation of your souls I love that scripture we haven't seen him yet but we will one day soon and we just want to we want to keep that love about us we want to rejoice and we want to keep a we want to keep an atmosphere of love and we want to be vessels that the Lord Jesus can speak to whomever he wants whether it be the bride whether it be the foest version whether it just be the highways and the hedges so I just want to encourage you all Brethren just to stay loving the Lord and let the Lord use you we say brother Josh the musicians [Applause] you know you guys all you impact someone's life whether you realize you do you you make an impact on someone's life and may the Lord may the Lord use you to impact someone's life that they may receive salvation on that day you know if a Souls with 10,000 worlds and God's called you to be bride one day you will stand in front of people and if you you can go oh that person did good to me or that person received of what I gave unto him you know that's a life and Jesus cares very much about life as

um 1 Peter 4 verse2 I want you to turn there so that um I've got also a few few little verses and then um uh realize realize one thing this is for you okay yes I learn a lot of through this and I'll tell you now this was probably the hardest sermon I had to prepare for uh the Lord I think the Lord challenged me um I had so many thoughts running through my head I was so excited when brother Ben said I can I can take one of these Youth Services CU I thought man I'm going to make it fun for you guys and it's going to be practical and all that but man I was struggling just to get this together like how do I what do I can I take this should I leave that I I was just all over the show so it's for you it's for you let's read verse 12 please beloved think it not strange concerning the fiery trial which is to try you as though some strange thing happened to you but rejoice in as much as ye are partakers of Christ's sufferings that when his glory shall be revealed ye be glad also with exceeding Joy amen you may have your your seats I will try and get some get comfortable as well um I won't call you boys and girls I'll just say youth I'll just say what what you want what what should I call you what do you boys and girls brothers and sisters um okay so um can I can I just speak can I just I've got thoughts and I brought all this together and I just want to speak from the heart just from experience okay and I'll I'll get to it I'll get to it now now it's it's it's not a opinion I want to give you to as where life's journey took me and I'm trying to put this all together okay so this is some life lessons and you can see version 44. seven so I've had some lessons in life and and and as you can see with the iteration or the versioning it's still going on it didn't stop at version 0.1 uh I've learned many years um there might be a hint in the four and the four but I won't dwell too much on it um that that was quite a nice I actually just wanted to have a little picture up there and then I found that I said oh that's very nice sometimes you must hurt in order to to know fall in order to grow lose in order to gain because most of life's greatest lessons are learned through pain unfortunately true okay so ohia never mind okay so we'll start off you probably May yeah you can read that a little bit about me okay where does this life lessons came from and all that kind of thing I'll give you a highlights uh uh a highlights real a highlight of my of my life because when I I didn't grow up in the message okay so I grew up as a denominational Christian you know Mom Dad Christian they they they learned gave me all taught me the the the the life's principles and and and and and Christian moral principles all right I came here and then I the first thing me and sister ly went was my whole life a lie you know and and brother Ben he he he can read someone very quickly he said no no no no no no don't throw away your whole life now you need to the Lord's taken you through this whole process and to to get you to a point to get you to a certain maturity um uh you're a different flower to this one you you've got a different culture different path that you had to grow uh everything changed the Dynamics was different he wanted you to get to this point um and and when I and I and I and I and I when the Revelation struck I go okay so what what do I make then of my past if I look back what is the what is the good what is the Nuggets or the Mana that I can look back that that got me through that really desolate place and and and desert if I can say spiritually um highlights of my life so then so I had some counsel here so I didn't receive counsel but I gave counsel so I was 18 19 years old and I had this you know good life and then you can go and counsil for a year in different schools high schools primary schools so fun fact um sister Lundy was in the primary school service here counseling so she usually dressed up as a clown and uh I was the cool guy I was in the high school team you know I was a drama queen um I I I I had to do some Cabaret and sing and do all these little weird dances which um yeah didn't not that cool um and that's where we met right so we used these little um avenues like dance and drama and and primary school activities and we did app sailing and paintball and all that just to pull people in just to sit down just to see who's hurt who's not you know so big learning school for for myself um but one of the things that I loved about that is because I guess this is the nature uh that's half a nature of every man I would say but it's it's big than my life I love the nothing box I love silence I love spending time just by myself no no sound no nothing around I can I can you know listen to my thoughts you now I can I can engage so one of the things now looking back that I actually enjoyed quite a bit was Solitude they used the word solitude now sometimes they'll come to us and say okay Solitude time and everyone just go I go when when now can we'll skip breakfast let's go you know it was a time that I could just go no no no device obviously that was back in 99 so it was hardly a device it was a brick um 99 um um no device no music no nothing you can take your Bible you can take a pen and you can take a little booklet notebook Journal something like that enjoyed it immensely now some they they had to uh sort of um wean Us in so the first time they said okay Solitude time it was an hour or maybe two hours cannot talk to anyone you are on your own okay you the Lord the word and your and your thoughts right I I loved it loved it to bits second time third time for and went on and at one stage they said I think it was something like 6 or 8 hours I go whoa now the benefit is I didn't sit in a city at that point when they asked that there was in a little place called Claymont uh Southern Cape uh Southwestern Cape so beautiful scenery you can really find a spot either next to the beach or in the bush or wherever and just be I enjoyed as so 6 hours of no other sounds but nature and you know if the Lord wanted to speak to me and he did he did speak to me quite a bit so a lot of reading time lot of journaling time lot of um I guess tools pre preparation for what we did in the schools you know you walk into schools sometimes it's it's a bit rough um you know there were people schools that was um uh I can't remember somewhere in Cape Town where they had 250 pregnan pregnancies just within the matric year you know so they they they had barbed wire around the the school to keep the kids in you know it was it was tough it was you know so we had to sort of build character cuz what do we take to them back then it was still uh the AIDS epidemic and all that so we had to sort of get some sort of lesson together and make it practical for people to understand for for kids to understand what is the significant what impact this will have have in your life so we learned about spiritual warfare we saw all this and we go man there's so many things I'm just going on this um I'm still a baby in my spiritual walk you know where's where's life taking me you know so this was the decision I made cuz I didn't want to go study I I didn't know what to do what am I going to be when I grow up I haven't grown up yet it seems so I I just carried on from there so then the next is did I make it did I make it can you see what that is that's a little a little seam a little th those that can sew um there's a what's it the thread and then uh I thought well sometimes I sit here and I go I think I've just made it on the skin of my teeth you know you you just made it in the door you were that last monkey into the ark's door before itos right when God so this and this is the thought I've had when God cut that cloth right so we're all part of this big cloth it's big and he's making us all together you know we one piece brother you said rip off that that piece of the jacket it's still piece of that jacket you know it's part of it I it felt like I was that so when when when you have this uh they they take the seam they pull it over the Hem and they sew it together there to just make it nice and you in the inside no one knows about it I think that was me you know that part of that cloth where I just made it where the Lord was cutting and that little thread you know sticking out that was me that was me and they they just fol you know the Lord folded it over and that and I thought well did I make it so you can see look at both ways I barely made it negatively or I go by the Lord's Grace I'm in I made it I'm still part of that okay so can you can you start seeing now I'm just giving you little snit bits and little life lessons Okay so any of these might just prick something in your heart might just stick with you okay and that's what I want I I'll try and cover a few things and then you say well this is now from my experience to you you do with it what you want okay let the Lord lead and work in your life right did I make it yes I was piece of that garment or not I was piece of that garment and I took that and I said I'm part of this and and and the Lord revealed to me that hey you have you have you have much work to do you know even if you just that one cut around that in that garment and that little tosel key is coming loose you still part of that garment right am Hallelujah okay did I make it now off the beach okay off the beach a lot of rugby being played um and then you have performance again remember it's part of my life lessons now so I had to learn this now my for me for Edan right off the beach I can perform I've got good performance and then when I'm at home what do I do when I am at work what do I do not from a performance point of view let me color the picture in they went to the Navy SE in America okay and they said the Seal Team Six you know the Seal Team Six okay this is the best of the best okay this is this is they take the Navy Seals the Army everyone and they go handpick these guys for SEAL Team Six they can swim they can they can shoot guns they can disassemble and they can make bombs everything this is the cream of the crop they went to the commanders and Chief and said how do you pick your Seal Team six all right most of you probably think performance performance you need to perform on the battlefield you need to carry on and and and if the stakes are down chips are you need to you need to perform you need to shoot accurate you cannot waste your bullets you need to you know that guy is not necessarily trustworthy okay so then they started looking at okay so you've got a guy that's okay performer but he he's not trustworthy there in the camp all right so the differentiation now that they're making his performances on the field trust is off the field so they go okay high performance guy or a low performance guy but no trust so when he's off the battlefield what time of person what time of character is coming out so they started picking the guys that's more trustworthy and they'll even take a guy that's Trust worthy and less performing so all on this right side because what they said is they want to the performance side I can trust you with my life but the trust side can I trust you with my money and my wife right so off the pitch who are you okay so performance here we are we at church we and you can see brother armant FY you we go into Solutions mode if something goes wrong you know it's performance it is performance we we we want to create the atmosphere and all that kind of thing and when it's done we pack up and go what type of person are we then on our way home or getting home or when the day or the week gets a little bit long you know who are we so I want to teach you that trust is vital I want to be able to trust you and vice versa brother need who comes to you and say you know and and it's it's humbling and they say I can trust you with me my with my car I can trust you with my wife I can trust you know that is that is Lord and that's the Lord that will take over if you let him right next one God has a plan for you right so we were talking about a lot of fire there brother Ben and the scripts are also aligned with our fiery trials and then um who likes brother ban Bailey well B Glo ban Bailey what a guy okay wow I'm standing there and my cheeks were starting to hurt cuz I was just smiling he's s such a wonderful guy and I can tell you you can ask him behind my back off the pitch that guy is next level Next Level we having fun together when we work he goes these guys are pleps but I go man this is fun I can break stuff you know you need to always go and Fe but to see this guy's Journey what's it now five years that you've been here is it yeah yeah so well it's been going like that you know so let's say a good good stint of four years but the Ben that walked in here and who knows Ben and the Ben that you see today that stood behind this Pulpit wow what a difference hey Lord can mold in shape okay so and that's that fits in here with God's God has a plan for you so whenever let me give you this advice kids whenever someone comes to you I'm thinking brother Adrian maybe brother kben maybe and they go and they see you've got a tough tough day at the office if I can say that and he puts the hands around his shoulder and he says God's got a plan for you if you're not a Christian run but I mean run very fast if you are a Christian try and stay ahead of that guy that's not the Christian and be faster than him because it's not a motivational speech God has a plan for you God has a plan for you there's hardship in that road his plan it is his plan let's let's get that out of the way it's not your plan so if someone comes to you and say God has a plan for you your life is going to Veer your life is going to change your life is going to be the boat's going to be shaken right be ready for that but his plan is to give him glory that's right so however he needs to mold and shape and purify and put you through the fire to purify that gold to get it shiny he wants to see himself reflected that's God's plan that plan sometimes is is hard I won't say it's not fun it's never a dull moment I'll put it that way okay so it is it is for only the brave um we run towards it rather than than Shan so I was just joking don't run away from it God will get you he's fast okay all right off the pit I think I've got something wrong there ah yes okay so I'll do I'll do this Oddball Oddball so there's a reason you get saved you decide God's chosen me and I accepted the offer to love the Lord with all your heart all your mind all your strength you know this you love him everywhere so remember what I said the performance and Trust off the pit wherever you love him everywhere so now you start praising him you start singing you people are down and and and and there's not a lot of vitamin C or vitamin D going around uh you still up and up you still you've got a joyful heart you still singing and shouting you you become to look a little bit crazy okay you are the Oddball so what I can tell you and my mom can probably then also go and you can ask her behind my back I've never been the the the celebrity or the the cool guy in school or anything like that so I can't I can't understand when you say um uh uh uh it's not it's not in it's not it's not cool it's not what I I was was a odd ball I I I had my friends and I stuck to them uh I think it was five friends and that was it you know I was friendly with everyone but I was also sometimes the bully bully I I I didn't stand up for any of those you know the cool kids so you know I would wear the Jesus Freak t-shirt you know I was I was that guy so um I grew up with that and I I I was happy being that odd ball you know I accepted it maybe my Statum made it a bit easier if I was in know I don't know but it you you're going to be odd ball you're going to be OD ball somewhere accept it take it okay I won't spend too much time on that but brother brandom talks about Oddball okay you just you're going to face that b battle So when you say Here I Am Lord and you're going to start and praise him praise him everywhere praise him off the pit and on you are going to become an oddball I'm I'm telling you okay so there we've got Oddball and now make up your mind make up your mind so you're going to have to turn with me to a few scriptures make up your mind not your opinion okay so let's see the first one Joshua 24:15 let's turn there Joshua 24:15 he got a Bible you've got all the Bibles say amen amen okay 24:15 and if it seem evil to you to serve the Lord choose you this day whom you will serve whether the gods which your fathers served that were on the other side of the flood or the gods of the amorites in whose land Ye Ye dwell but as for me and my house we will serve the Lord very famous scripture I just want to bring it to you kids this is Joshua 24 the Battle of Jericho is Joshua 5 this has been going quite some time so after Jericho after the works that signs and wonders and miracles and whatever that happened God came down after that he's he's still he's still giving them this he's still giving them this sort of a make a choice okay and that's where I want to say make a choice make up your mind today don't take your your your opinion you still growing you're still changing I'm still changing all right opinions out of the way okay so if we we read Joshua 24 so if I put this up can you turn to your Bibles please 1 Ed one 16 is it in the Bible no leave it alone leave it alone throw it out okay what about this one tw NOA 39 it's got the accent and everything this is fancy this must be in the Bible hey is it in the Bible let's leave it alone does this ring a bell does this look familiar 1 Corinthians 15 do we have that in the Bible can we turn there maybe okay so what I'm trying to show you there is if any man's opinion there go if it comes back to the word take it read it okay if brother Arman throws up here on the board on Wednesday night you go home and you go go check if is right or not examine the word okay so 1 Corinthians 15 uh behold I show you a mystery we shall not all sleep but we will all be changed in a moment in a twinkling of the last of an eye at the last Trump for the trumpet shall sound and the dead shall be raised Incorruptible and we shall be changed okay what I want to tie in there is you've seen now let's go back that's legit not legit not even faintly this is legit so let's get that all together scripture okay the truth is will never make you popular the truth will make you free 100% okay that's why I'm saying if you make up your mind now and you you are going away be ready right you won't be popular I was never missed popular I can't I can't I'm can't compute okay I was the odd ball but what I do know is if you choose the root of absolute truth you will you will not be popular it's not a popular opinion around here okay also rather have a splinter in your back and I'm playing here paraphrasing on scripture rather have a splinter on your back than keeping the Splinter in your eye what I'm saying there is when you're not popular when the truth comes out and you turn your back you might get a few things in the back okay maybe Wooden Spoons I don't know but they you you will you will you will be backstabbed because you believe the truth you stand and honor the truth you on your position okay okay and this is now for you okay and he said go your way Daniel for the words are closed up and sealed Until the End uh until the time of the end don't you forget that until the time of the end this is Daniel this is Old Testament this is very very far ago he's talking about now this is for you okay until the end of until the time of the end many shall be purified and and oops and made white and tried but the wicked shall do wickedly and none of the wicked shall understand but the wise shall understand just look in the world what's going on getting more wickedly more less and less and less understanding we're getting here and we are on a different plane we are going up and up the word the the what's coming over this Pulpit is just on another level at this point take that the end time message shall reveal it the last Church age right here Glory there you are oh my it shakes me to think of it the mystery the things that the uh that the church World bats their eyes and says it's nonsense the mystery of who Jesus Christ is not a third person or second person but the person of God all these other mysteries of God will be revealed because it's wrote in this book and be revealed to the end time generation I'm almost past this now this is you end time generation you've got you've got lingo this is this is you they can no more see it in seminary schools de denominations the Jews could see Jesus being the Messiah then jwes sorry no matter they try they think you're crazy OD ball no no wonder they think you're foolish no wonder they they can't understand why you don't cluck up with them getting to that little popular thing you're just sitting always on the other side yeah where's that little inclusive oh is it now you know you see these little this three here and this little bubble says now we are inclusive now we've got you know all all everything but these they're walking a different life right so just just think about this here we are a word of God that's being revealed to the church in order for the Rapture and go to the the going home yes many shall uh run to and fro and knowledge shall increase certainly okay so this is you end time generation I'm looking at you Oddball making up your mind where we now almost the last one seek light okay uh very famous guy he's a neurologist he used the study of the brain to tie that into nutrition into fitness into so have any anyone heard of Andrew huberman Andrew huberman so here verba I've quote him I don't know if he's a Christian but he is science back he's looking at science he's looking at what the brain needs okay every mental health condition we are aware of is made better through the simple zero cost adjustments to our our interactions with light it sits at the foundation of our wiring of our nervous system okay what I'm trying to say there what is the condition of the world today is the world chasing light or is it chasing Darkness if you start looking at where let's go from a physical point of view and and and it's actually quite funny when I used to take the trip um to to Wellington on the train in and out if I if I couldn't feel temperature if I couldn't see outside the windows I could look at people's faces and I can tell you is it summer or is it winter cuz the deficiency of vitamin D on those faces they are morbid they are down and I'm telling you if it wasn't for the Lord I would would it be one of them right you if it rains a little bit too much you go when's the sun's out you know like yesterday we were just having a jubilee because we could see some sun on our face you know so now in the spiritual is the Lord uh sorry is the world chasing light right we will be in a different state if we are chasing and we after light if we seeking light all right with the light comes joy joy in the morning we just just restore the joy of my salvation just remind me Lord what have you done for me I'm looking back at my life and go yep he's done quite a bit I'm so happy I am full of joy boy peace that passes all understanding where I am right now because of that because of the light because of the joy and of course then rest rest rest what do I do what do I mean with with rest what is rest do we just sleep what's rest relax relax okay Lord's got this if if we've been through all this now and we get to this point and we go I've got the light I'm faing the light I've got the joy got the joy in my heart rest what's rest seventh day the seventh day God rested said he okay how do we rest in this day end time generation got the Holy Ghost we can rest Lord I want to jump onto your economy not this up and down fluctuation of the world show me what do I need to do for you to to please you to glorify you today rest don't worry about yourself I made a little note just here of um the importance of Your Life Choices between 13 and 23 most of you are there okay girls and boys sorry I said girls and boys um brothers and sisters this uh decide on this day who's who's who's in your team who you rooting for okay because G because God cannot change okay Hebrews yet because of this you will always always change take my life now I am now 44 I can drive a 4x4 I'm 44 okay my life's been changing ever since okay never never um had a I can probably say I've never had a dull moment I'm thinking of the of the lady specifically here I'm saying don't hoard in your heart don't keep baggage in your heart don't don't hold on to it this journey is very long and a lot of change comes leave it leave it there leave it at the altar because canot and I said this be because God cannot change you will always change I want to bring this now here the most dangerous thing in Africa and we can maybe get a few hands here what do we think is the most dangerous thing in Africa this is now my opinion this is my thought okay what do we think is the most dangerous thing in a in in Africa yes people people okay yep black m black mamba okay animals we would think so yeah kingra king cobra so if we go animal wise is probably the Buffalo and the hippo just for your reference it's stale water in Africa and and because I come from there this is my reference point I see true thirsty people I see people that will walk for KS and KS for a fresh bucket of water at one tap for a village Village of thousands thousands of people they want that fresh water the thing the life lessons you will be drilled into is do not drink from any water not any water source if that stale if it's been sitting there it's years old it's TI to the scripture if it's been stale it's years old nothing there's no movement there's not stay away from it there's dangerous there's parasites it lives in you it it kills you from the inside keep away from stale water if there's fresh water flowing here wherever you are and wherever in your walk keep drinking that okay stay away from stale water dirty water if it's pouring out and it's taking back in there's there's a flow and we can use that drink from that and then I probably want to close with this um why David was a man after God's Own Heart tying this now back to my life lesson why David was a a man after God's Own Heart why did he say that so from my thoughts I'm thinking repentance and he lived and he loved the law how he really danced around the ark when it come back you know he was just he he loved the Lord he loved the law he lived the law you know he could kill Saul he didn't because he knew the order of the law so can we go to acts 13 and this is me in closing act 13 say Amen if you're there and when he removed him he raised up unto David to be their King is now he's talking about Saul removed him he raised him up unto David to be their King to whom also now this is the important bit I think sometimes we might just scheme over this to whom also he gave testimony and said I found David the son of Jesse a man after my own heart which shall fulfill all my will so this is a guy that's been and this is in Acts New Testament David's in the old talking about here what's David's been through with biva with the all the fights all the war the hand of war that was on his life he had a testimony so he had a life lesson so he learned from it so because he learned from it God could use him to fulfill his word to fulfill his will so of this man's seed ha God according to his promise raised unto Israel a a savior Jesus when John had first pre uh preached before his coming the baptism of repentance to all the people of Israel okay and in closing I just want to say some life lessons version 45 okay so it never stops it always always sticks on so take the good leave the bad anyone's opinion what do we do with it Chuck it away come and come to the Fountain come to the spring come drink of the The Living Water leave the St water Alone um you will have a lot of life lessons been thrown at you if you make that choice if you stand for the one okay musicians as you come forward um I'll try and get a key here stand up and shout it stand up and shout it if you love my Jesus stand up and shout it if you love my Lord I want to know yes I want to know do you love my Lord sit down sit down and Whisper if you love my Jesus sit down
