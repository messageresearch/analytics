[39:30] to have Norma and Damona here god bless
[39:32] you it's wonderful to have you here so
[39:35] this is a wonderful day
[39:36] I mean faith victorious true amen praise
[39:43] the Lord what a name you know the I like
[39:48] to look into name definitions meanings
[39:50] we know faith faith as it denotes an
[39:55] unquestioning belief and complete trust
[39:58] in God I thought was interesting the the
[40:02] name faith became very popular among the
[40:06] 17th century Puritans now we know the
[40:08] Puritans they left the old world Europe
[40:11] to go to America to found a new nation
[40:13] to leave the oppression of the church
[40:15] systems to worship God and in spirit and
[40:18] truth I was thinking that's you guys you
[40:26] didn't know what you're looking for but
[40:29] God knew God knew why you're here it's
[40:33] not men that made you a believer God did
[40:36] he found a new life here his life an
[40:42] economic life for you life in him that
[40:48] means I thought that's very fitting and
[40:50] we know Victoria it means victory
[40:53] hallelujah this is in first John five
[40:56] and four you want to if you got your
[40:59] Bibles handy if not if you want to put
[41:00] that up on the screen first John five
[41:04] and in verse 4 it says for whosoever is
[41:10] born of God overcometh the world and
[41:14] this is the victory that overcometh the
[41:17] world even our faith so our faith gives
[41:21] us the victory over the world
[41:23] so I thought what a name for this little
[41:25] one I mean she's got a real faith a
[41:28] revelation in Jesus Christ and this is
[41:30] going to give her the victory and give
[41:31] her a body change hallelujah so you know
[41:34] we know the scripture has there's
[41:36] nothing in Scripture to baptize or
[41:38] sprinkle babies but as you know you know
[41:41] the little ones were given to Jesus and
[41:43] he would take them up in his hands and
[41:45] he would bless them and so since that's
[41:47] the scriptural way this is how we
[41:48] dedicate children to the Lord so and
[41:50] Melissa have little faith victorious
[41:53] terrific
[41:54] Amen what a little one praise the Lord
[41:56] for this new life let's bow our head

[47:09] let's turn to judges chapter 8 and we're
[47:12] gonna also go to Luke chapter 18 but so
[47:15] I don't have a slideshow but if we if we
[47:17] just go to judges 8 and verse 10 that
[47:21] would be I want to I want to continue on
[47:26] the thought about standing on the knee
[47:27] nikka the enemy having complete dominion
[47:30] but I want to call this one if I can
[47:32] call it you get what you expect if you
[47:37] if you have come expecting something to
[47:39] criticize well I've already probably
[47:40] given you more than enough to criticize
[47:42] but God chosen his great wisdom to use
[47:45] the foolishness of preaching and he
[47:47] would give us all quirks in our humanity
[47:49] and now so you know for you just look
[47:50] beyond that today you know and let's
[47:53] just let's just really enter in and
[47:55] who has a need who has a real need this
[47:59] service could change your life forever
[48:01] I believe we don't just gather just to
[48:03] go through a religious motion but this
[48:04] this one moment you know we're gonna go
[48:07] through a lot of moments in the
[48:08] scripture where people's lives will
[48:09] change forever others weren't changed
[48:11] but others were so we want to be on that
[48:14] side of the margin of the ones that were
[48:16] changed forever so we got to let's go to
[48:19] judges and chapter 8 we're gonna read
[48:20] from verse 10 he says now this notice
[48:23] this is just after Gideon has won as
[48:25] great victory over the hosts of the east
[48:27] and your mighty things have been done
[48:29] but now notice us now zebah and zalmunna
[48:33] were were Krakow and there if you I
[48:37] don't know how to pronounce these names
[48:38] to just forgive me there's nothing you
[48:40] can criticize you can't read I know and
[48:42] their hosts with them about 15,000 men
[48:45] all that were left of all the hosts of
[48:47] the children of the east and there fell
[48:49] a hundred and twenty thousand men that
[48:51] drew sword and Gideon went out by the
[48:53] way of them that dwell in tents on the
[48:55] east of Nova and a job better and smoked
[49:00] the host for the hosts was secure and
[49:02] when zebah and zalmunna fled he pursued
[49:06] after them and took the two kings of
[49:08] myth Midian zebah and zalmunna and
[49:11] discomforted all the hosts and Gideon
[49:13] the son of joash returned from the
[49:16] battle before the Sun was up and caught
[49:18] a young man of the men of Zhukov and
[49:21] inquired of him and and he described
[49:23] under them the princes of Zhukov and the
[49:25] eldest heir of even threescore and
[49:26] seventeen men and he came unto the men
[49:29] of Zhukov and said Behold zebah and
[49:30] zalmunna with whom you did upbraid me
[49:33] saying other hands of zebah and zalmunna
[49:35] now on thine hand that we should give
[49:37] bread unto thy men that are weary and he
[49:39] took the elders of the city and the
[49:41] thorns of the wilderness and briars and
[49:42] with them he taught them in of Zhukov
[49:44] and he beat down the tower of pinyon and
[49:47] slew them into the city then said he
[49:49] unto zebah and zalmunna what manner of
[49:52] men were they whom you slew at table and
[49:55] they answered as thou art and so were
[49:58] they each one resembled the child of a
[50:01] king and he said they were my brethren
[50:04] even the sons of my mother as the Lord
[50:06] loveth
[50:07] if ye had saved them alive
[50:09] would not slay you and he said aren't
[50:12] you Jo his firstborn up and slayed him
[50:15] but the youth drew not his sword for he
[50:17] feared because he was yet a youth let's
[50:22] go to Luke 18 in verse 35 and this is
[50:25] probably a more of a familiar scripture
[50:29] to you speaking of of blind bartimaeus
[50:33] it's a Luke 18 and verse 35 and these
[50:43] things will by the grace of God they'll
[50:45] tied together maybe I just got too much
[50:47] I want to give but I don't know we'll
[50:48] see how we go and that came to pass that
[50:51] as he was working I on to Jericho a
[50:53] certain blind man set by the wayside
[50:55] begging and he heard the multitude
[50:58] passed by and asked what it meant and
[50:59] they told him that Jesus of Nazareth
[51:01] passes by and he cried saying Jesus our
[51:04] son of David have mercy on me and they
[51:07] which went before rebuked him that he
[51:09] should hold his peace but he cried so
[51:11] much the more thou son of David have
[51:13] mercy on me and Jesus stood and
[51:15] commanded him to be brought unto Him and
[51:17] when he was come near he asked him
[51:19] saying what will they'll that I should
[51:21] do unto thee and he said Lord that I may
[51:23] receive my sight and jesus said unto him
[51:25] receive thy sight I faith a save thee
[51:27] and immediately he received his sight
[51:29] and followed him glorifying God and all
[51:32] the people when they saw it gave praise
[51:34] unto God I mean you may bless I mean
[51:37] made a little Bliss's word you may have
[51:38] your seats this morning so I want to
[51:41] speak about you get what you expect
[51:42] now we must never never never have a
[51:45] preconceived idea of how church service
[51:47] will go
[51:48] we must never have a preconceived idea
[51:50] well this is we're gonna sing this long
[51:52] the song leader it's the song leaders
[51:54] he's gonna sing this certain way and
[51:56] he's gonna pray a certain way and
[51:57] they're gonna play a certain way then
[51:59] the preacher will get up he's gonna
[52:00] preach a certain way and he moves his
[52:01] hands a certain way and you know you
[52:03] know you know we should never have a
[52:05] preconceived idea how the church
[52:06] services goes I mean we have not you
[52:08] know we are not here just to go through
[52:10] the motion of having a service I trust
[52:13] you didn't just come here just to have
[52:14] Church I meant some of us probably
[52:18] though are already thinking about what's
[52:20] gonna be for lunch and what they must do
[52:22] tomorrow this coming
[52:23] weak no doubt some of us are already
[52:25] thinking about its stomachs and I say
[52:27] you don't ever go down that line of
[52:30] thought because lunch will come there
[52:33] will be something to eat tomorrow is
[52:36] going to happen unless the Lord takes us
[52:38] away tomorrow will happen right so don't
[52:40] worry about those things they will
[52:43] happen but there is a we must understand
[52:47] there is a big difference in coming to
[52:49] church and coming to church right there
[52:51] is a big difference between just coming
[52:53] here sitting going through the motion
[52:55] you know some of us come you know
[52:57] there's a certain way of doing things
[53:00] and you can still live below your
[53:03] privilege we're sons and daughters of
[53:05] God
[53:06] we're redeemed we're being washed in the
[53:08] blood all things are under our feet I
[53:10] mean we have the victory
[53:11] I mean but we so we don't want to live
[53:13] under our privilege just go through the
[53:16] motion you know some of us were thinking
[53:18] oh I just want to hear a good thought
[53:19] it's more than that I want to hear
[53:22] something new it's more than that I want
[53:24] to hear a lot of quotes more than that I
[53:26] want to sing my favorite songs it's more
[53:28] than that I mean but if you come with
[53:30] that expectation that is all you'll
[53:32] receive some of us just come expecting
[53:34] to hear what we've been fellowshipping
[53:35] about during the week is going to come
[53:37] over the pulpit it's more than that I
[53:39] mean it's more than just going through
[53:40] the motion I think we need our faith to
[53:43] be challenged I mean we should really
[53:46] step out you say well you know people
[53:48] have an expectation how things will go
[53:50] like camp people had an expectation some
[53:53] people really got what they needed
[53:55] others expectation was met but it wasn't
[53:58] what they really needed you know some
[54:00] people just expect well we're gonna have
[54:01] a big emotional time God's going to move
[54:03] in a powerful way it's got to be more
[54:05] than just God moving to you right blind
[54:08] bartimaeus would be sitting there you
[54:10] know against the wall there and he's
[54:11] trying to brother bran would dramatize
[54:13] it to make it more alive and you know
[54:15] you know he would say the brother bro
[54:16] yeah you're the blind Bartimaeus he
[54:18] would lean up against the stonework of
[54:20] Jericho there to warm himself because
[54:22] the Sun you know heat was absorbed into
[54:24] the wall and he'll be warming himself
[54:26] against the wall and he was blind but
[54:29] but before he went blind his mother
[54:31] would tell him of the great heroes of
[54:32] faith that walk through Jericho States
[54:35] she would tell him about Joshua and the
[54:37] mighty thinks Joshua did and how he
[54:39] stopped the Sun and the moon and how
[54:41] they walked around the walls of Jericho
[54:43] and they took the city and you know she
[54:45] would tell them about Rahab and the
[54:46] mighty thing she did by faith applying
[54:48] the token and gathering everyone under
[54:50] the message of the hour that they would
[54:51] receive eternal life and you know you
[54:53] know she would tell them about Elijah
[54:55] walking here and Elijah and all the
[54:57] mighty things God did but he only knew
[55:00] up to that point of God of history and
[55:02] many of us just know a god of history
[55:04] where we would go or brother Brown did
[55:06] this and you can maybe read in the
[55:08] scripture yes Jesus did that 2,000 years
[55:10] ago or maybe 50 years ago but what about
[55:12] today I mean he's not a historical god I
[55:15] mean the gospel does not make us good
[55:17] historians and then we know what good
[55:20] does a historical God do to us it does
[55:22] us no good whatsoever I'm in his but the
[55:25] Bible says he is the same yesterday
[55:27] today and forever that he does not
[55:29] change that he's the very much the same
[55:31] God back then as he is today and so he
[55:34] would be there and then you know we know
[55:36] where Jesus is there's always a whole
[55:38] bunch of noise and there were a lot of
[55:41] people that were gathered around here
[55:43] here was Jesus Christ the Son of man he
[55:45] was on his way to Calvary he had already
[55:48] walked he had died most most of his
[55:50] earthly journey here and he was on his
[55:53] way to Calvary and here was a man with a
[55:55] neat he said how does that apply to us
[55:57] we're at the last we're at the end of
[55:59] the seventh church age I mean Jesus
[56:01] Christ has been walking through his
[56:02] church as he's shown in the book of
[56:03] Revelation River at the end and now he's
[56:06] going to turn his attention fully to the
[56:08] Jews but before he does that the bride's
[56:09] going in a rapture I mean so here he is
[56:12] he's finishing his ministry through the
[56:14] Gentiles he's about to turn to the Jews
[56:16] just like Jesus had basically finished
[56:18] his earthly ministry and he's about to
[56:20] go to Calvary and here was a man who
[56:23] needed more than a nice church service
[56:25] here was the man that this was the last
[56:28] time God would walk through his City in
[56:30] this way he was never going to return in
[56:32] that form to Jericho he needed more than
[56:35] a nice idea he needed more than just his
[56:37] mama's stories of the Bible though those
[56:38] were good
[56:39] I mean but so he was there and when he
[56:42] heard this great noise he had began to
[56:45] ask the question what's going on
[56:47] what's going on and and then he was told
[56:50] as Jesus of Nazareth and he began to
[56:52] realize the stories that his mother told
[56:54] him about of God living in those
[56:56] people's days he began to realize thank
[56:58] God was now walking right in front of
[57:00] him and he began to realize I mean he
[57:03] was now about to step into a Bible story
[57:05] but now he was one of the main
[57:06] characters hallelujah is more than just
[57:08] him talking about someone he was now
[57:10] part of it and he began to cry out Amen
[57:13] Jesus thou son of David have mercy on me
[57:16] he was not gonna let this pass him by
[57:19] he was determined I mean he was
[57:21] something in him said that God that I
[57:23] worship can heal my eyes color and he
[57:25] began to cry out he didn't care what the
[57:27] others said they even told him to shut
[57:29] up but he would not shut up because he
[57:31] realized this is my opportunity I'm not
[57:34] going to let someone rob me I mean of
[57:36] what God can do for me now and that same
[57:39] son of man is walking in our midst
[57:41] even now I mean we have to recognize his
[57:44] presence and not just be anointed and
[57:47] enjoy it but get what we need many
[57:51] people you imagine going there where
[57:54] Jesus was who had been such a presence
[57:55] here was the fullness of God here baldly
[57:58] was now in flesh the Creator was walking
[58:01] around upon the earth more than a
[58:03] prophet more than a religious man he was
[58:05] God you imagine the atmosphere that he
[58:08] carries part of the atmospheric air
[58:10] imagine stepping into that presence many
[58:12] people stepped into his presence they
[58:14] didn't get what they needed you think
[58:16] about people like Pilate Pilate didn't
[58:19] find Jesus Jesus found Pilate but there
[58:22] it was as the governor of the area you
[58:24] know and because of he wanted to keep us
[58:25] standing in the political pressure he
[58:29] tried to wash his hands of Jesus he had
[58:32] two opportunities to fall at Jesus feet
[58:34] he had two opportunities his life could
[58:36] have been changed forever he heard about
[58:38] what Jesus had done it was noise through
[58:40] the city it wasn't down in the corner I
[58:42] say this message wasn't done in a corner
[58:44] either
[58:45] I mean God's alive how Louie's done
[58:48] incredible things in our day and we need
[58:49] to recognize he's done incredible things
[58:51] so so Jesus came to Pilate but he wasn't
[58:54] willing to he didn't get what he needed
[58:55] a lot of he say but he was a Roman
[59:01] scribes and Pharisees huh ground Jesus
[59:03] they knew the scripture really well then
[59:05] you're better than your own I write
[59:07] edits in the original language they knew
[59:10] how it was all meant to happen but they
[59:13] just criticized them they see it away
[59:15] with this fellow will keep our religion
[59:18] now brother Brahim sees an incredible
[59:20] statement this isn't this isn't my my if
[59:23] I can find it here Amen I'm already
[59:27] let's go back here no wait there we go
[59:34] he says this he says this and I will
[59:38] restore say at the Lord he says so if
[59:40] you want to get close to God just real
[59:43] close just get close to love just love
[59:46] God with all your heart and with all
[59:48] your soul and with all your mind with
[59:50] all your strength just wrap yourself in
[59:51] a bundle of love who wants to be like
[59:53] that watch the man that you that you
[59:57] that didn't like you did you ever get
[1:00:00] around somebody you've seen nice people
[1:00:02] that you can't hardly stand to be around
[1:00:04] them now you know that's right I've seen
[1:00:06] people that maybe that you just love to
[1:00:08] be in their presence
[1:00:09] haven't you seen people like that he
[1:00:11] says do you realize that your sons of
[1:00:14] God the atmosphere and the air that you
[1:00:16] live in you create a situation around
[1:00:19] you that either draws or pushes away so
[1:00:23] the kind of atmosphere that you make at
[1:00:26] either draws or pushes away it's your
[1:00:31] attitude well what what do you mean by
[1:00:34] an atmosphere or kind of situation you
[1:00:36] create it's your attitude it's your
[1:00:39] attitude creates the atmosphere around
[1:00:41] you who's ever worked or gone to school
[1:00:43] or someone who's got a stink attitude
[1:00:45] always fussing and complaining and this
[1:00:47] is wrong get all everything's negative
[1:00:49] or they create an atmosphere around them
[1:00:52] they create an atmosphere cuz it's their
[1:00:54] attitude towards what's going on but
[1:00:56] who's also ever been to work with
[1:00:58] someone who been to school or someone
[1:01:00] who's just here but positive friendly
[1:01:02] helpful outgoing thoughtful they create
[1:01:04] an atmosphere and those two people can
[1:01:07] can be facing the same situation but
[1:01:10] it's their attitude towards what's going
[1:01:12] on will actually produce an atmosphere
[1:01:14] around them
[1:01:15] so their attitude a man will either draw
[1:01:18] or push away now I just ask the question
[1:01:23] now what about your attitude
[1:01:24] what about the atmosphere you create
[1:01:27] around you does it draw God on the scene
[1:01:29] I'm not talking about pushing away or
[1:01:31] drawing the world I'm saying does your
[1:01:33] atmosphere does it draw God down even in
[1:01:36] the service this morning I mean the
[1:01:38] attitude that you're looking at me worth
[1:01:39] amen either draw God on the scene
[1:01:41] you know church is an incredible thing I
[1:01:43] mean it's more than just going through
[1:01:45] emotion more than just hearing preaching
[1:01:47] but God can come down at a far greater
[1:01:48] way in services I mean there's been
[1:01:50] testimony after testimony people being
[1:01:52] healed people coming out of wheelchairs
[1:01:54] cancers going people receiving eternal
[1:01:56] life demons being cast out because they
[1:01:58] come to church hallelujah the Bible says
[1:02:01] forsake not the assembling of ourselves
[1:02:02] together so much more as we see that Day
[1:02:05] approaching why cuz when God's children
[1:02:07] come together and they begin to worship
[1:02:09] we begin to cry atmosphere god you're so
[1:02:11] good god is good all the time
[1:02:13] he put a song of praise in this heart of
[1:02:15] mine how good you are Lord you wash me
[1:02:17] of my sins you've set me free I mean
[1:02:19] I've been redeemed I'll be redeemed by
[1:02:21] the blood of the Lamb I'm going in a
[1:02:23] rapture hallelujah
[1:02:25] I'm it creates an atmosphere and God
[1:02:27] says I'm enduring that atmosphere high
[1:02:29] it's more than just angels gathering to
[1:02:30] worship God's free God steps down in the
[1:02:33] middle of their worship hallelujah how
[1:02:35] they because Jesus says where two or
[1:02:37] three gathered in my name there I am in
[1:02:39] the midst of them so he's between you
[1:02:41] and me he's between you and me he's
[1:02:43] between you and the person next year
[1:02:44] God's present and if we could just
[1:02:46] recognize his presence among us holy I
[1:02:49] believe what could change your whole
[1:02:50] life amen
[1:02:52] we should never ever diminish coming to
[1:02:55] church and the potential of what could
[1:02:58] happen because we know we're living in a
[1:03:00] day and age where all things are
[1:03:01] possible to them that belief and there
[1:03:03] is no cap on what we can believe all
[1:03:05] things are possible to them move to to
[1:03:08] them that belief amen so the atmosphere
[1:03:11] you create that I love draws God or
[1:03:14] pushes them away remember the scribes
[1:03:18] and Pharisees were religious people they
[1:03:19] weren't atheists they believed in
[1:03:22] Jehovah God but now that Jehovah God
[1:03:24] became flesh in Jesus Christ and their
[1:03:26] atmosphere was actually pushing him
[1:03:28] I mean but there were other blind people
[1:03:30] no doubt in Jericho and blind Bartimaeus
[1:03:32] was there he wouldn't have been the only
[1:03:34] case there would have been other beggars
[1:03:35] other blind but the atmosphere he
[1:03:38] created when he recognized he was
[1:03:40] stepping into the pages of the scripture
[1:03:42] and and his God was there at drew him
[1:03:44] and drew the Lord to him O God may we
[1:03:47] draw you may we draw you to where we are
[1:03:50] where you come and meet our needs may
[1:03:52] this be more than Church more than going
[1:03:54] through a motion or more than just
[1:03:55] having a may be a happy time look we
[1:03:57] want to draw you down I mean to where we
[1:03:59] are I tell you don't let the devil stop
[1:04:02] you don't let the devil stop you the
[1:04:04] devil tried to stop blind bartimaeus he
[1:04:07] anointed people to say be quiet don't
[1:04:08] call out to him just want you go by but
[1:04:11] he said no devil if you're getting
[1:04:14] opposition that's because there's a
[1:04:16] blessing for you to receive maybe if
[1:04:18] you're receiving opposition hears
[1:04:20] because the devil is trying to ward you
[1:04:21] off from what you need
[1:04:23] hallelujah Amen well how do I create an
[1:04:28] atmosphere that pushes them away we
[1:04:30] begin to think wins this man going to
[1:04:32] finish this is boring why do these
[1:04:36] people get excited it's all the motion
[1:04:39] really is this really just a motion why
[1:04:43] do mom and dad have to drag us to this
[1:04:44] place
[1:04:45] this is creating atmosphere in your mind
[1:04:46] that pushes them away man when I get
[1:04:49] older I'm out of here
[1:04:50] that pushes God away there's nothing
[1:04:54] satisfying in this world I mean we've
[1:04:57] all hallelujah I know the questions
[1:04:59] asked many times but you know for all of
[1:05:01] us that came out you know here's a
[1:05:03] question who was actually raised as a
[1:05:05] message believer here I mean as no
[1:05:08] parents now appearance not many not many
[1:05:12] then why is the majority of us who were
[1:05:15] in the world here if the world is so
[1:05:17] glorious
[1:05:18] because nothing out there can satisfy
[1:05:20] you say if I just get the right job on
[1:05:23] the right car in the right house and the
[1:05:24] right girlfriend on the right hobby I'll
[1:05:26] be satisfied Oh No
[1:05:28] you know maybe for a season but then the
[1:05:30] emptiness of it just just just you just
[1:05:32] realize the emptiness of it you can have
[1:05:34] all the money in the world but it'll
[1:05:36] come to an end
[1:05:37] haloo you see the guy who who who runs
[1:05:40] amazon east you know left his wife ran
[1:05:42] off with some other woman bought this
[1:05:44] big hundred and sixty three million
[1:05:45] dollar mansion wherever and you're done
[1:05:47] all the stuff
[1:05:48] there's nothing satisfied there's
[1:05:50] nothing satisfying in his life
[1:05:52] unfortunately he's trying to buy it with
[1:05:54] money and experiences and things and you
[1:05:57] know there's nothing satisfying there
[1:05:59] cuz you just go from one thing to
[1:06:00] another thing to another thing but those
[1:06:03] who meet Jesus it's more than a story
[1:06:07] those that really meet him it doesn't
[1:06:09] matter mimic godliness with contentment
[1:06:12] is if you have godliness and you'll
[1:06:16] content with the position you have
[1:06:17] member the world wants to make you a lot
[1:06:19] of things it wants to push you into a
[1:06:21] certain mold you know maybe it's a
[1:06:23] sports tower or rock star a movie star
[1:06:26] whatever it may be maybe just a very
[1:06:28] successful businessman or Kremen what's
[1:06:30] the push into a certain mold and this is
[1:06:31] how you have to be I say this is how we
[1:06:33] should be hallelujah I've met people
[1:06:37] Amen that have virtually nothing and
[1:06:40] they're the happiest people have ever
[1:06:41] met
[1:06:42] hallelujah because they're not looking
[1:06:44] for the big house and the big job and
[1:06:46] the big car and the big big big
[1:06:47] ears about that stuff I mean if you know
[1:06:49] him you have everything but if you don't
[1:06:52] know him you have nothing it's really
[1:06:55] that simple you say well I've got a bit
[1:06:58] of religion that'll just make you
[1:06:59] miserable I mean you've got to trade
[1:07:01] your religion for him and once you meet
[1:07:04] him I'm talking about more than just
[1:07:05] even more than just giving a confession
[1:07:07] of faith more than just repenting even
[1:07:09] more than getting baptized right but
[1:07:10] when you meet him amen it will satisfy
[1:07:13] like nothing else can satisfy hallelujah
[1:07:17] well how do you know that I've been
[1:07:19] there you all know my story I was out in
[1:07:22] the world I was lost as lost as lost
[1:07:24] could be I was written off probably by
[1:07:25] everyone in this room would would have
[1:07:27] written me off but he came this message
[1:07:31] came my way and the god I heard about
[1:07:33] came into out of history hallelujah so I
[1:07:39] don't want a kind of attitude that
[1:07:42] pushes God away I want one that brings
[1:07:44] him on the scene
[1:07:46] hallelujah because it's your response
[1:07:49] your response and what you talk about
[1:07:52] will either push him away or broke him
[1:07:54] close brother brand would tell the story
[1:07:57] of when he was he was out fishing with
[1:07:59] with a couple of a couple of brothers
[1:08:02] the woods boys they all they were they
[1:08:04] were formerly Jehovah Witness and they
[1:08:07] meet the Lord and and and they're out
[1:08:09] fishing and and they were talking about
[1:08:11] how how one was speaking to another
[1:08:14] about how they should go meet an older
[1:08:17] sister you know you know that you know
[1:08:19] that was belong to the Church of God and
[1:08:20] and and they said we ought to go and
[1:08:22] tell her that we got saved they're just
[1:08:24] fishing heavier conversation we should
[1:08:26] go tell her how we got saved and then
[1:08:28] and their brother had says you know
[1:08:30] there's just certain things that you can
[1:08:32] say we can say that just takes a hold
[1:08:35] with the Holy Spirit just certain things
[1:08:37] that pleases him right just right and
[1:08:40] when we say that thing I want you to
[1:08:42] notice well you say if we can just find
[1:08:45] what to say your word judges you your
[1:08:47] word condemns you or your word will
[1:08:50] bless you and unconsciously banks must
[1:08:53] have said the right thing that's banks
[1:08:55] would and and no more after he said that
[1:08:59] I was sitting in the back of the boat
[1:09:00] fishing with a fly line for a little
[1:09:03] bluegill fish to put one on the line for
[1:09:05] bait we'd run out of bait and I was just
[1:09:06] catching these little fish and putting
[1:09:07] them in the bucket for the truck line
[1:09:09] and when bank said that all of a sudden
[1:09:11] something struck me he said the right
[1:09:13] thing and the Holy Ghost spoke out and
[1:09:16] said thus saith the Lord you'll find in
[1:09:17] the next few hours will be a
[1:09:18] resurrection of a little animal and we
[1:09:21] know that little fishy came back to life
[1:09:22] when God came down so he said the right
[1:09:25] thing I'll say this if that's just
[1:09:28] fishing how much more in church I mean
[1:09:30] when God comes down and begins to anoint
[1:09:33] the ministry and anoint your life and
[1:09:34] you begin to respond to the word amen
[1:09:37] and something you can say how you
[1:09:38] respond can cause God to come upon the
[1:09:40] scene for you I mean we know the story
[1:09:42] of brother Branham when he was speaking
[1:09:44] when he would share the share the
[1:09:46] experiences about how he helped how the
[1:09:49] Lord challenged him that day on the
[1:09:51] scripture of whatsoever things ye say if
[1:09:53] he said to this mountain be thou removed
[1:09:54] cosna see it's yeah it'll happen if you
[1:09:57] believe and God challenged them he said
[1:10:00] what do you have Nieto he says well I'm
[1:10:01] squirrel hunting well how many do you
[1:10:03] want and then and then brother man took
[1:10:06] God at the challenge and by the creative
[1:10:09] power of God those squirrels were
[1:10:10] created and then now when he's relaying
[1:10:14] this story on a little farm there where
[1:10:19] where he was to actually to try and
[1:10:20] return an offering to the family because
[1:10:22] they are so poor and he felt so bad
[1:10:23] about them and their offering they gave
[1:10:25] and and brother bands relating the story
[1:10:27] and then the mother there at the farm
[1:10:30] sister Hedy right said that's nothing
[1:10:32] but the truth and God came down and said
[1:10:35] sister Hattie whatever you ask right now
[1:10:38] whatever you asked for you'll receive it
[1:10:39] and if you don't receive it call me a
[1:10:42] false prophet and so she sitting there
[1:10:44] under that anointing saying no what
[1:10:45] you're asked for you know because there
[1:10:47] were her old appearance her sister was
[1:10:49] in a wheelchair now poor people you know
[1:10:51] but maybe you could ask for a million
[1:10:52] dollars it'll fall in your lap but
[1:10:54] because she in her heart was the
[1:10:57] salvation of her two boys and those two
[1:10:59] boys were not even interested in what
[1:11:01] was going on and she said I want the
[1:11:03] salvation of my two sons and brother
[1:11:05] says I give it to you in the name of
[1:11:07] Lord Jesus Christ and those boys who are
[1:11:09] laughing and snickering amen
[1:11:11] Kame fell on their lap of their mother
[1:11:12] gave their lives to Jesus Christ and
[1:11:14] became Christians why because she said
[1:11:17] the right thing it's more than a story
[1:11:21] our faith needs to be challenged we
[1:11:25] can't limit God we can't limit God you
[1:11:27] say well that happened to her and I'm
[1:11:29] not back there but the same Jesus is
[1:11:31] here that same resurrected one is
[1:11:34] walking among us we need to recognize
[1:11:36] his presence and not just recognize her
[1:11:39] but act on it
[1:11:41] hallelujah what is this got to do with
[1:11:44] the son of Gideon not killing those
[1:11:46] kings we'll get there we're just taking
[1:11:48] a journey amen so we've we got to
[1:11:54] respond the right way your atmosphere
[1:11:56] either push of away or draw Oh Lord may
[1:12:00] we draw you there was a little boy
[1:12:06] walking along there and Jesus was having
[1:12:10] a big meeting in their head no food and
[1:12:12] he he had a few loaves and a few fishes
[1:12:16] and maybe he was on his way to school or
[1:12:18] know where he was going but he he had
[1:12:21] this food and he's walking along and he
[1:12:24] begins to see a crowd and you know a
[1:12:25] crowd always draws a crowd so he begin
[1:12:27] there because people are nosy he begin
[1:12:29] to go see what's going on and he came
[1:12:32] unto the under the voice of the master
[1:12:34] he heard the Lord Jesus and in the Lord
[1:12:37] began to speak about yeah let's go send
[1:12:39] the people away that they can eat and
[1:12:41] the disciples begin to say but you know
[1:12:43] there's nowhere around where you're in
[1:12:45] the wilderness
[1:12:45] they'll faint on the way then something
[1:12:48] in that little boy said here's my lunch
[1:12:52] here's my lunch this is all he had and
[1:12:56] then the Lord took it cause he's the
[1:12:57] crater began to bless it and multiplied
[1:12:59] in it and it became just a more than
[1:13:01] just one little lunch but it fed 5,000
[1:13:04] men and woman and children you know five
[1:13:06] thousand men and besides woman and
[1:13:07] children now he gave his lunch to the
[1:13:10] Lord and it feared a multitude I say
[1:13:13] this
[1:13:13] how much more if we give us whole your
[1:13:15] whole life to him I mean he's here more
[1:13:18] just to feed people I mean he's here
[1:13:20] more than just to you know feed people
[1:13:21] and nourish them physically how much
[1:13:23] more if you give you a whole life then
[1:13:24] what he could do in your lives I mean
[1:13:26] you could shake the world in your
[1:13:28] generation I mean we just heard the song
[1:13:30] this morning we are the generation the
[1:13:33] final voice of the final age it's got to
[1:13:36] become more than a song I want to
[1:13:39] challenge you this morning
[1:13:40] let God challenge you let him challenge
[1:13:42] your faith it's gonna be more than a
[1:13:45] song it's gotta be no more than just
[1:13:47] some not nice item it's gonna live it's
[1:13:49] got to become a living reality I mean
[1:13:51] where your life you don't have to go
[1:13:52] and sing that song but your life is
[1:13:54] where I'm power that chosen generation
[1:13:56] he chose me before the foundation of the
[1:13:58] world it's not my goodness I'm a
[1:14:00] Christian it is goodness
[1:14:01] and start my own let's not him that
[1:14:03] willful runs but God that's just mercy
[1:14:05] it's not even my will I would never want
[1:14:08] to be here a few years ago you would you
[1:14:11] wouldn't catch me in this place but God
[1:14:13] found me God found me hallelujah that's
[1:14:18] got to be more than a song so how much
[1:14:21] more if we could just give her whole
[1:14:22] lives not just a part of our lives the
[1:14:24] whole bit the whole bit to him what
[1:14:27] could he do see that's the thing and the
[1:14:33] disciples was a predestinated seed and
[1:14:37] the history of the world was changed
[1:14:40] because of those men history of the
[1:14:43] world history of the world was changed
[1:14:45] because the Apostle Paul he's one of the
[1:14:48] most famous people in history because he
[1:14:50] changed the world one man what about you
[1:14:54] you say well you're talking about a
[1:14:56] rapture being soon but it may not be I
[1:14:59] mean we should live like it's now but
[1:15:01] also we should live like this in a
[1:15:02] hundred years time we should plan for
[1:15:04] our future there's nothing wrong with
[1:15:05] that but don't get so caught up in
[1:15:07] earthly things but what about you what
[1:15:12] about you he say I'm just a little
[1:15:13] insignificant Peter was a fisherman he
[1:15:17] wasn't the celebrity of the earth he
[1:15:20] wasn't in the temple he wasn't part of
[1:15:21] the height yo Kev's is the high priests
[1:15:24] entourage you're the celebrity you would
[1:15:26] never have seen his name in the in the
[1:15:28] in the newspaper or some web site you
[1:15:30] know Peter goes and does this and he
[1:15:32] fishes here it catches this much it was
[1:15:34] not there but God saw him God saw him
[1:15:38] God used him God took the world with a
[1:15:42] little fisherman what about you he said
[1:15:45] but I'm a man I can't preach your life
[1:15:46] can soak the world there's one of the
[1:15:48] evangelists and I think it was George
[1:15:50] Whitfield I might be wrong but there was
[1:15:52] a there was a I think you know there's a
[1:15:55] sister there that couldn't walk and she
[1:15:57] would sit in a chair and apparently her
[1:16:00] testimony of how she conducted herself
[1:16:02] even under great difficulty not being
[1:16:04] able to walk saved many many people
[1:16:06] and they actually don't know if the
[1:16:09] pulpit or her chair was the greater
[1:16:11] witness to the world what about you what
[1:16:16] about what God could do in your life he
[1:16:19] say I'm waiting for something don't let
[1:16:21] the devil hold you back the son of
[1:16:23] Gideon was afraid to actually put his
[1:16:26] hand to the sword it was easy to watch
[1:16:28] his dad have the victory it was easy to
[1:16:30] watch the older generation have the
[1:16:32] victories but when he had to come to his
[1:16:34] place he was afraid it's how are you
[1:16:39] putting a lot of pressure
[1:16:40] let God press you sometimes pressure is
[1:16:44] good sometimes to be challenged as good
[1:16:46] you're the biggest problem in this
[1:16:47] country as we just she'll be right
[1:16:50] she'll be right mentality God has it all
[1:16:55] in control so yes she'll be right but
[1:16:57] not in the way New Zeeland says she'll
[1:16:59] be right our lives from the palm our
[1:17:01] names are in the palm of his hands
[1:17:03] engraved
[1:17:03] I mean we're part of him so it can't
[1:17:05] lose us so she'll be right hallelujah he
[1:17:09] can't lose part of himself but the thing
[1:17:12] is we can't just sit back and say well
[1:17:16] whoever if I'm predestinated I'll be
[1:17:18] there I'm not producing I won't be there
[1:17:20] never ever think that way if I am
[1:17:23] pre-decide to receive the full
[1:17:25] inheritance of God I want it now
[1:17:29] amen he said well and then the devil
[1:17:32] says now you not producer but the but
[1:17:33] jesus said all that come to me I'll no
[1:17:35] wise cast out if it's there without
[1:17:37] money or price wouldn't you want it
[1:17:40] hallelujah you know people who play
[1:17:43] lotto and I trust no one does here you
[1:17:45] know but but there's always you know it
[1:17:47] says comes the news that the jackpots
[1:17:49] been unclaimed do you not think people
[1:17:52] take the tickets and go see if the other
[1:17:53] winner do you think people don't do that
[1:17:56] because they think all this might be me
[1:17:59] now this is more than lotto yes I mean
[1:18:02] but but but when it's put before you

[1:23:44] that's more than a story we've had no a
[1:23:48] wall that was in the 50s we've had
[1:23:50] people come to our camps and they've had
[1:23:53] a decision they had to make as this
[1:23:56] message really true or am I just going
[1:23:58] to go to a Pentecostal church they come
[1:24:00] with this you know Bethenny read our
[1:24:02] first camp remember that she came with
[1:24:05] that burden on her heart and and this
[1:24:07] was she she brought God down to a
[1:24:08] showdown
[1:24:09] if you don't prove yourself to me in
[1:24:11] this camp I'm leaving God's grace God's
[1:24:16] grace to zeal X because when you
[1:24:17] actually I'll put it that this may be
[1:24:19] the wrong way to say it but if you
[1:24:20] challenge God at His Word he loves a
[1:24:23] challenge God are you really real he'll
[1:24:26] say I'll show you I'll show you you on
[1:24:28] my life I'm show you my word is true and
[1:24:30] she came to that camp and and and she
[1:24:32] had that burden on her heart I'll just
[1:24:34] say this she left knowing that this
[1:24:35] message is right
[1:24:37] Shiekh she left knowing that Jesus
[1:24:38] Christ is alive and this message is more
[1:24:40] than doctrine more than rights Jesus
[1:24:42] Christ alive today Halle and she's still
[1:24:45] I believe it today we're made more than
[1:24:47] just her do that we've had more but
[1:24:50] others came to the camp just thinking
[1:24:51] we're gonna have camp but she came with
[1:24:53] a need saying I must meet him in this
[1:24:55] time now say what about you this morning
[1:24:59] yeah I'm preaching to myself you just
[1:25:05] happen to be here I want more than just
[1:25:07] Church I want more than just nice
[1:25:09] sermons more than you saw that's a nice
[1:25:11] thought more than a nice thought I want
[1:25:13] more than that I want God to live I want
[1:25:16] the third pool to be full and in full
[1:25:19] manifestation he sell but the squeeze
[1:25:21] has got to come on whipping squeezes
[1:25:23] we're being squeezed I mentioned in the
[1:25:26] illness in the youth group this morning
[1:25:28] you know the Jews weren't one morning
[1:25:30] free in Europe the next morning and
[1:25:31] Auschwitz being exterminated as squeeze
[1:25:33] came on them a squeeze came on them and
[1:25:36] what was done in the physical to them
[1:25:38] spiritually we've done against the Bride
[1:25:40] of Christ and we are being squeezed what
[1:25:47] that sounds like a bad thing no no no it
[1:25:51] just brings out what's in you if the
[1:25:54] overcomers in you you'll overcome he
[1:25:58] says just watch the third Paul when that
[1:26:00] squeeze comes in what's done being done
[1:26:02] and temporarily well we come to the
[1:26:04] fullness of its power God wants to take
[1:26:07] you yeah this is not for preachers this
[1:26:10] is not just for preachers deacons
[1:26:12] musicians this is for everyone amen
[1:26:17] that God would live hallelujah now let's
[1:26:27] go
[1:26:29] he sees this here he says now every one
[1:26:34] of you not only ministers but all of you
[1:26:36] ought to pray for these people so people
[1:26:38] who are sick of need you don't know what
[1:26:41] God might do for you while you pray for
[1:26:44] somebody else what if you say the right
[1:26:48] thing here's a woman standing here she's
[1:26:50] so sick they have to hold her up what if
[1:26:52] your prayer would be the right thing
[1:26:54] just like bank said the right thing had
[1:26:56] he said the right thing what if you
[1:26:57] would say the right thing your prayer to
[1:26:59] cause God to come down and do something
[1:27:01] see it's not just one person this is the
[1:27:04] Church of the Living God amen now we
[1:27:10] come to Gideon son here get in I believe
[1:27:15] wanted the younger generation to have
[1:27:17] part of the victory then it wasn't just
[1:27:20] the adults no more it wasn't that now
[1:27:22] when I was thinking about young people
[1:27:24] and being a young person I'm not talking
[1:27:26] about just physically being young right
[1:27:29] so I'm not just talking about our youth
[1:27:31] I'm talk about everyone here you got to
[1:27:33] put you you got to draw your sword right
[1:27:35] this is not by association you'll get
[1:27:37] the victory you've got to address your
[1:27:39] enemy you've got to deal with them
[1:27:41] you've got to put him to death I've
[1:27:42] talked about spurts now remember yep so
[1:27:46] Gideon so he wanted the younger
[1:27:48] generation to have his hand in this
[1:27:50] victory but fear stopped them from
[1:27:52] killing a defeated foe remember the
[1:27:55] kings those two kings see it arise and
[1:27:59] slay us amen they they were already
[1:28:03] reconciled they had already come to the
[1:28:06] fact that they're going to die they had
[1:28:08] been conquered there was no way of
[1:28:10] escape for them they knew they had lost
[1:28:12] and they knew that they were going to
[1:28:14] die so they even instructed them saying
[1:28:18] arise and slay us that we read that now
[1:28:24] let's go no we didn't get that far
[1:28:26] let's go down back-to-back the judges
[1:28:28] ate again
[1:28:37] and we go to verse 21 we didn't get the
[1:28:39] verse 21 now remember the enemy has
[1:28:45] already said to Gideon that the people
[1:28:47] they slew that were relatives of Gideon
[1:28:49] they all look like children of a king
[1:28:51] and this is this is now the devil this
[1:28:54] is now the devil's testimony of the
[1:28:56] believers they all look like Kings
[1:28:58] children Kings have Dominion right
[1:29:01] they're the top not the bottom so he's
[1:29:03] saying oh this is the kind of people
[1:29:05] they were they were royalty and we are a
[1:29:08] rural nation a holy nation right a royal
[1:29:12] priesthood the Lord's made us thus so
[1:29:15] this is the kind of people they were but
[1:29:18] then he says that that he was afraid to
[1:29:20] slam because because he feared because
[1:29:23] he was yet a youth and then now listen
[1:29:25] verse 21 then zebah and zalmunna said
[1:29:28] rise thou and fall upon us for as the
[1:29:32] manners so as his strength and Gideon
[1:29:35] arose in slough zebah and zalmunna and
[1:29:37] took away the ornaments that were on
[1:29:38] their camels neck so so they were
[1:29:41] actually calling kill us they knew that
[1:29:43] they were done you know the devil knows
[1:29:45] he's done you know the devil actually
[1:29:48] knows his time is coming to an end
[1:29:50] how many times when the devil is about
[1:29:53] to be cast out when Jesus was they said
[1:29:54] have you come to torment us before the
[1:29:56] time
[1:29:56] have you actually come before we know
[1:29:59] our times coming but have you come to
[1:30:00] torment us before that time that he
[1:30:03] knows his expiry date has come to an end
[1:30:06] he knows that he's gonna burn he fights
[1:30:09] it he fights it with everything that's
[1:30:11] worth in him but he knows it's going to
[1:30:13] happen now brother Ben would say I'm
[1:30:22] positioning the gate to the enemy after
[1:30:23] trial now we are more than conquerors
[1:30:26] churches amen we just walked right into
[1:30:30] it as an inheritance more than
[1:30:32] conquerors now we are dealing with a
[1:30:34] defeated enemy sickness is defeated
[1:30:37] death is defeated hell is defeated
[1:30:39] everything is defeated oh my I wish I
[1:30:41] was twice my size now maybe I feel twice
[1:30:44] as good we
[1:30:45] disputing worth a conquered enemy so the
[1:30:48] enemy that fights you has already been
[1:30:50] conquered he's already been defeated but
[1:30:52] you have to put him on his place I mean
[1:30:55] no wonder Paul could say when our
[1:30:57] building a block two choppers head
[1:30:58] office is o death where is your sting
[1:31:00] now show me where you can make me squirm
[1:31:02] and scream grave where is your victory
[1:31:03] and and you think you'll mold me out
[1:31:06] there I'll point you to an empty one
[1:31:08] over there and and I am in him and he
[1:31:11] he'll raise me up at the last day a
[1:31:14] defeated enemy
[1:31:15] we're disputing with a defeated enemy
[1:31:17] remember the devil still doesn't have
[1:31:19] the keys to his own house he'd still the
[1:31:22] yes has lost its sting the grave has no
[1:31:25] victory no more it still doesn't have a
[1:31:26] victory today amen we are just as
[1:31:29] victorious the bride is just as
[1:31:32] victorious now as she was then because
[1:31:34] the Lord is still the victorious one I
[1:31:37] mean so we're we are disputing with a
[1:31:41] defeated enemy now we read last week in
[1:31:43] Joshua chapter 10 where he called us
[1:31:46] captains when he took the five kings of
[1:31:48] the country there brought them out of
[1:31:50] the cave that they'll hold up and and
[1:31:52] they too and he told his captains to
[1:31:54] stand upon the neck of the enemy and
[1:31:56] then they hung them that killed them and
[1:31:59] he said thus shall it be he says fear
[1:32:01] not nor be dismayed be strong and of
[1:32:03] good courage for thus shall the Lord do
[1:32:06] to all your enemies whom you fight so
[1:32:09] you will have total victory over all the
[1:32:11] enemies that you fight against that
[1:32:13] spirit that plagues you hallelujah
[1:32:16] you'll have victory I mean that unbelief
[1:32:19] that bothers you you'll have victory I
[1:32:21] mean those things that you know take
[1:32:24] your imagination off into really dark
[1:32:26] places you'll have victory over it if
[1:32:28] you're willing to kill it
[1:32:31] brother Bram said you're gonna kill your
[1:32:33] enemy or your enemy will kill you
[1:32:36] amen I'll say this with great absolutely
[1:32:39] with sadness how many people have we
[1:32:41] seen coming to among the believers and
[1:32:46] instead of killing the spirit that's
[1:32:49] beaten them down and getting rid of the
[1:32:51] thing they just hold it captive hostages
[1:32:55] are expensive to maintain right
[1:32:58] huh prisoners of war are actually
[1:33:00] expensive thing to look after and the
[1:33:02] propers if you hold something prisoner
[1:33:04] up again could be can begin to influence
[1:33:06] you again it can begin to whisper in
[1:33:09] your ear oh I've got the minion of this
[1:33:11] but it whispers in your ear it's not
[1:33:12] dead right it's not dead it still speaks
[1:33:16] to you and eventually if you can come
[1:33:18] under its influence again and it can
[1:33:19] drag you out back out into slavery how
[1:33:22] many people have we seen that happen to
[1:33:23] they know they've got to die to a
[1:33:25] certain thing but the problem is they
[1:33:28] still have an affectionate memory of
[1:33:30] what it you should do with them you
[1:33:32] gotta hate sin you gotta hate spirits if
[1:33:35] you if you slap all but I used to be
[1:33:37] something when I was under that
[1:33:38] anointing you'll never be free of it it
[1:33:44] will hold you captive even if you say
[1:33:46] you have a captive you have to hate the
[1:33:49] thing that dragged you got to hate your
[1:33:50] unbelief I mean you've got to hate the
[1:33:53] sin that drags you down you've got to
[1:33:54] hate your enemy brother Ram said the
[1:33:57] devil hates me I hate him too
[1:33:58] there are things we're allowed to hate
[1:34:01] and the devil's the thing we're allowed
[1:34:02] to hate right you ought to kill your
[1:34:08] enemy or your enemy will kill you and
[1:34:13] this is where the son of Gideon he had
[1:34:17] the opportunity kill them they've course
[1:34:22] does great damage remember these were
[1:34:24] the kings of Midian
[1:34:25] they were like grasshoppers you know
[1:34:27] they they ate the substance of Israel up
[1:34:29] they had dominion over them and now
[1:34:32] finally they're the the kings of that
[1:34:34] place that had plagued him for so long
[1:34:35] now their life was coming to an end and
[1:34:37] Gideon wanted to give the victory to his
[1:34:40] son son you can do it rise up and slay
[1:34:43] them remember their captive you know
[1:34:45] they can
[1:34:45] died but it's it's he was afraid because
[1:34:49] he had to put his hand to it more than
[1:34:52] the favorite preacher more than just
[1:34:54] reading the scripture more than
[1:34:57] listening to the message that's when you
[1:34:59] actually take that word and say Lord
[1:35:00] make it live in my life more than
[1:35:03] someone else's testimony but the problem
[1:35:05] is we always are afraid of the unknown
[1:35:08] even if that unknown can be deliverance
[1:35:11] it can be freedom it can be overcoming
[1:35:13] power it can be victory people can be
[1:35:17] afraid because we get comfortable and
[1:35:19] where we have been and we can explain
[1:35:21] away all but this and this and this and
[1:35:23] this is happening and this is why I'm
[1:35:24] this way and and we and we begin to look
[1:35:26] at other people and criticize them
[1:35:28] because of the state we're in and we try
[1:35:30] and validate our backslidden state
[1:35:32] because of how other people are remember
[1:35:34] it's you and God who cares of the whole
[1:35:37] world who cares if everyone else goes
[1:35:39] and goes back out of the world I said
[1:35:41] now I'm gonna walk with God the rapture
[1:35:43] is an individual affair it's not you and
[1:35:46] all of us sure the bride's gonna go in
[1:35:47] to click the body but it's you and God
[1:35:49] walking alone you've got to walk with
[1:35:51] Him doesn't matter what mama says daddy
[1:35:54] does whoever does what are you yes what
[1:35:57] about you oh but these people are going
[1:36:00] getting all worldly and excellent but
[1:36:02] what about you
[1:36:03] you know probably the scribes and
[1:36:05] Pharisees they always tried to outdo
[1:36:07] each other they would say the biggest
[1:36:09] praise and they would plan what they had
[1:36:11] pray write it down and all isn't that
[1:36:13] incredible and they would begin to go
[1:36:14] out don't pray out in public like the
[1:36:17] hypocrites or scribes and Pharisees do
[1:36:19] and they wore the biggest pious robes
[1:36:21] they give the biggest pious offerings
[1:36:23] and they're saying look at me and now
[1:36:25] comparing themselves with everyone
[1:36:29] around them but then when the real
[1:36:31] Murrah came when the word became flesh
[1:36:33] and walk among them they weren't willing
[1:36:35] to look in the mirror and see where they
[1:36:39] were oh that was them what about you why
[1:36:44] are you preaching this way we can't just
[1:36:47] continue going on amen
[1:36:50] we've got to have a meeting I'm

[1:36:59] war we're here to take no prisoners give

[1:37:10] second I mean when the jublee trumpet

[1:37:24] got me here and all this and this no no

[1:38:02] the dwelling place of the Living God I
[1:38:04] mean where God fulfills his word that's
[1:38:07] what we built to be you say well why
[1:38:11] would you say that because to be a
[1:38:12] Christian is to be christ-like and you
[1:38:14] can't be a Christian unless the Lord
[1:38:16] Himself is in you he is the Christian
[1:38:19] and you a man isn't that right that's
[1:38:22] how you actually be a Christian he
[1:38:24] that's why he died on Calvary that here
[1:38:26] come and dwell in you and livers word
[1:38:27] out it's not us trying to do it it's him
[1:38:31] amen I feel the pain religious right now
[1:38:35] brother Aaron with some free food
[1:38:36] feeling pretty good but he had to rise
[1:38:41] up he had to take the sword himself but
[1:38:44] he is afraid if there is fear holding
[1:38:48] you back you've got to speak to that
[1:38:51] fear not someone else you are but this
[1:38:56] is how always been it comes a day with
[1:38:58] blind bartimaeus didn't stay blind he
[1:39:02] had a meeting the one what the blood
[1:39:04] issue didn't stay the woman with the
[1:39:05] blood issue the woman at the well didn't
[1:39:08] stay the woman at the well
[1:39:09] she had a meeting hallelujah what about
[1:39:13] you he said well I've been a Christian
[1:39:15] for many many many many many years for
[1:39:17] right now what about the joy and the
[1:39:19] fire and the passion to know him what
[1:39:21] about that all the joy of your salvation
[1:39:23] how good he is and how wonderful he is
[1:39:25] and you can be in church you can be by
[1:39:27] yourself and God just comes down and you
[1:39:30] have a glorious time and you just said
[1:39:32] so much in love hallelujah that's how it
[1:39:35] should be you say no that's just a nice
[1:39:36] idea really it's not just a nice idea I
[1:39:40] mean this is a marriage between us in
[1:39:41] Christ and it doesn't just stay with a
[1:39:44] honeymoon and become a working
[1:39:45] relationship it stays a honeymoon sure
[1:39:48] there's a lot of battle sure there are
[1:39:50] things you got to go through but he's
[1:39:51] holding you by the hand I would never
[1:39:53] let anything bog you down hallelujah you
[1:39:57] say oh you can't stay in that cloud
[1:39:59] night experience you just be challenged
[1:40:03] for a second oh no it's not really in
[1:40:06] that way he's sure have you experienced
[1:40:10] it do you know why the devil tells you
[1:40:12] those things because it's not him and
[1:40:15] God in a relationship he's the enemy
[1:40:17] it's young God in a relationship the
[1:40:20] devil doesn't even come into the
[1:40:21] equation but we give him so much room
[1:40:23] and we keep him prisoner
[1:40:25] what are we just come why don't we just
[1:40:28] come and say Lord I'm sick of us and you
[1:40:30] have to you have to kill them you got to
[1:40:32] rise up and slay it this thing that
[1:40:34] haunts you and bugs you for so long
[1:40:36] you've got to kill it you have to they
[1:40:42] say if I just get pray for done you've
[1:40:44] got to do the pray you have to rise up
[1:40:47] you have the faith now Gideon would it's
[1:40:54] amazing you know the Bible doesn't just
[1:40:56] show us the word doesn't just discern
[1:40:59] our hearts and reveal us the word
[1:41:02] reveals the devil and his heart there's
[1:41:05] many times where the devil as I said
[1:41:07] about yo Jesus would be there and the
[1:41:09] devil would speak out of someone say
[1:41:10] have you come to torment us before the
[1:41:12] time he knows he's got it coming it
[1:41:15] would say in revelations chapter 12 that
[1:41:17] when he's cast down to the earth he
[1:41:19] knows he has got great wrath because he
[1:41:21] knows he just has a short time
[1:41:23] if he knew if he actually didn't um if
[1:41:27] he didn't think he would burn in the
[1:41:30] lake of fire
[1:41:30] why would he just think he's got a short
[1:41:32] time he knows he's going to end up in
[1:41:34] that place he's fought the word all the
[1:41:37] way down through he hasn't stopped it he
[1:41:41] could not stop this word now amen
[1:41:46] brother Brown would say when I'm glad I
[1:41:50] got page numbers here we are see you see
[1:41:59] we have too many people do not die out
[1:42:02] to the diet discern and kill that
[1:42:06] spirits influence in their lives because
[1:42:08] they actually love or at least are
[1:42:10] affectionate towards that spirit you
[1:42:13] actually have to hate that spirit don't
[1:42:15] defend it see you come out of the world
[1:42:19] you cannot defend what you once were I
[1:42:21] was a ranked sinner I'm ashamed of what
[1:42:25] I did I wasn't proud of it but people
[1:42:29] are still proud of what they were
[1:42:30] what's because they still love the thing
[1:42:34] you actually have to hate that thing
[1:42:37] that once ruled you see Sampson had to
[1:42:40] be willing to die to destroy his enemies
[1:42:43] he had to be willing to die with those
[1:42:46] Philistines and the scripture says in
[1:42:48] Romans 6 and 7 for he that is dead is
[1:42:50] free from sin so if you're really dead
[1:42:53] and Christ lives in you you're free from
[1:42:54] sin it's more than just a nice word it's
[1:42:58] reality amen let me say this my friend I
[1:43:03] know I've said it but he says listen
[1:43:05] just once more Lord let me say this my
[1:43:07] friend you better destroy your enemy
[1:43:08] before your enemy destroys you he says
[1:43:10] bring back the old fashioned prayer
[1:43:12] meetings old-fashioned repentance with a
[1:43:14] state where they stay to the altar till
[1:43:15] they were dead and finish with sin now
[1:43:21] how many times here is so Gideon as I
[1:43:26] said the scripture tells us it reveals
[1:43:28] the heart of the devil and Gideon would
[1:43:31] go down before his great victory with us
[1:43:33] 300 and Hermon and someone else would
[1:43:35] actually sneak into the camp of the
[1:43:37] nights to see what was going on and as
[1:43:40] they snuck there that night they heard
[1:43:42] two of the Midianites speaking and once
[1:43:44] it I had a dream and that dream was a
[1:43:46] cake of barley bread was rolled down
[1:43:49] into the camp it would strike a tent and
[1:43:50] the tent will fall down flat and then
[1:43:53] now Gideon did not have to work out what
[1:43:55] that meant because the other one would
[1:43:56] say well that's actually the sword that
[1:43:59] and and his fellow answered and said
[1:44:02] that is nothing else saved the sword of
[1:44:04] Gideon
[1:44:04] and thus the son of joash a man of
[1:44:07] Israel fall into his hand hath God
[1:44:10] delivered Midian and all the hosts this
[1:44:12] is judges 7:14 so this is he's to
[1:44:16] Midianites
[1:44:17] what has the dream the other one gives
[1:44:19] the interpretation saying actually our
[1:44:21] goose is cooked because God has already
[1:44:25] given our lives and all the hosts into
[1:44:28] this man's Gideon's hand so what happens
[1:44:32] the devil actually show the devil
[1:44:34] actually knew this is what's going to
[1:44:36] happen to me and it says it and as it
[1:44:39] was so when Gideon heard the telling of
[1:44:41] the dream and the interpretation thereof
[1:44:42] that he worshiped because he no doubt
[1:44:45] he's wondering well there's only 300 of
[1:44:47] us they're like grasshoppers upon the
[1:44:49] earth how're we ever going to defeat
[1:44:50] them but when he goes down any any and
[1:44:53] he realizes actually no they know their
[1:44:56] end the devil knows his end Joshua 2 and
[1:45:02] 9 when when the two spies go into rehabs
[1:45:04] house and Rahab begins to tell them now
[1:45:07] you just think about it you're the two
[1:45:10] spies you're look at Jericho their walls
[1:45:13] are so thick you can race chariots
[1:45:14] around them the big walls you would have
[1:45:17] seen their armies and their spears their
[1:45:19] shields in there and their soldiers you
[1:45:21] know on guard all these things no doubt
[1:45:23] you think how're we ever going to win
[1:45:24] this there's incredible feat if we ever
[1:45:26] do it but then that the Lord is going to
[1:45:28] show gonna show Israel the heart of the
[1:45:32] people in the city this is the heart of
[1:45:35] the devil he can look like a big boast
[1:45:37] and a big bluff and he can look so big
[1:45:39] and strong and powerful but in him his
[1:45:42] morale is shot he knows he's got it
[1:45:44] coming hallelujah member we are
[1:45:47] disputing with a defeated foe
[1:45:50] and it's a Rahab would begin to tell
[1:45:52] them of the morale of thee of the people
[1:45:57] in the city and she said unto the man
[1:45:59] this is Joshua turn nine I know that the
[1:46:01] Lord hath given you the land and that
[1:46:04] your terror has fallen upon us and that
[1:46:07] all the inhabitants of the land faint
[1:46:09] because of you here they were with their
[1:46:12] big big city and their shields and
[1:46:14] swords and their army but their hearts
[1:46:16] fainted the terror of the Lord fell upon
[1:46:19] them and Rahab said because it's you
[1:46:21] that caused that to happen you know the
[1:46:24] devil believes in trembles do you know
[1:46:27] that you believe in one God you do well
[1:46:30] the Bible says but the devil also
[1:46:31] believes any trembles so he's trembling
[1:46:33] in his boots because he knows God is
[1:46:36] gonna fulfill his word and he's gonna
[1:46:39] burn he's actually trembling but he
[1:46:41] tries to put that upon you because he
[1:46:44] knows if you just take the word for
[1:46:45] yourself and you believe the word for
[1:46:47] yourself and you take it and you kill
[1:46:49] that thing out of your life he's
[1:46:50] powerless he's powerless so he tries to
[1:46:54] bluff us and say no you know just got to
[1:46:57] live with us and this is how it is near
[1:46:58] your mum was like this your dad was like
[1:47:00] this you know that you know because of
[1:47:02] your past you have to be like this soon
[1:47:03] he said and I've said that a lot but who
[1:47:06] said you've got to take the sword you
[1:47:11] got to kill it so all the inhabitants of
[1:47:21] the land faint because of you do you
[1:47:23] think they look like they was shaking in
[1:47:25] their boots when Israel was walking
[1:47:26] around the city with the ark and the
[1:47:27] trumpets and everything they would have
[1:47:29] been there trying to look like
[1:47:31] intimidating on the wall but their
[1:47:34] hearts had fainted they were actually in
[1:47:36] terror watching those rights carry the
[1:47:38] ark around the wall the devil is afraid
[1:47:42] of you doesn't matter how old you are
[1:47:45] how young you are how long you've known
[1:47:47] the Lord for the devil is afraid of you
[1:47:51] amen and as soon as we heard these
[1:47:56] things now I'm just dropping down to
[1:47:57] verse 11 when they heard about how the
[1:47:59] king of the emirates were killed the Red
[1:48:01] Sea was you know opened up and all those
[1:48:03] things
[1:48:04] as soon as we heard these things thou
[1:48:05] hast had melt neither did they remain
[1:48:07] any more courage and any man because of
[1:48:10] you for the Lord your God He is God and
[1:48:12] heaven above and an earth beneath but
[1:48:14] earth beneath you know when you begin to
[1:48:17] have a testimony service and you were
[1:48:19] going to testify what God did for you
[1:48:21] the devil hears it he was there he was
[1:48:23] cast out he knew he was there it
[1:48:25] happened I mean he doesn't say that
[1:48:27] didn't happen he knew it happened cuz he
[1:48:29] was there and their hearts actually
[1:48:31] melting saying we can not get control of
[1:48:34] these people no more Howell ooh yeah you
[1:48:37] think about his heart is actually melted
[1:48:40] because of you he said but he's he's a
[1:48:45] bluff no he's nothing but a big shadow I
[1:48:47] mean you know he said but he's powerful
[1:48:50] he's strong he's down a list of people
[1:48:51] no he's nothing but a bluff but you have
[1:48:55] to call his hand brother were seasoned
[1:48:59] witnesses he says the he says the reason
[1:49:03] you let him do it that's all he's just a
[1:49:04] bluff he has no legal right that's right
[1:49:08] if you've got an experience of God of
[1:49:10] the resurrection of Jesus Christ he
[1:49:12] strips Satan of every privilege he had
[1:49:14] and robbed him of everything he had took
[1:49:17] it away from you so he robbed him and
[1:49:18] stripped him and give the power to the
[1:49:21] church now go do the same things that I
[1:49:24] did that's right he took the sword out
[1:49:25] of Satan's hand and put it in your hand
[1:49:27] amen
[1:49:30] so he had to but the son of Gideon was
[1:49:39] afraid he wouldn't rise up and kill you
[1:49:42] no you keep reading the book of Judges
[1:49:44] someone else rises up and kills all the
[1:49:46] sons of Gideon and becomes the ruler
[1:49:48] what happened if this one stood up and
[1:49:51] said I'll do what the words telling me
[1:49:53] to do
[1:49:53] I'll kill these defeated foes we need
[1:49:57] courage we need courage you know brother
[1:50:02] Aaron makes a statement now and I'm just
[1:50:04] going to kind of come down to this he
[1:50:09] makes a statement you just put one or
[1:50:10] two good church members in a church
[1:50:12] that's really on fire for God it'll do
[1:50:15] something for that church more than
[1:50:17] forty revivals you could have let God
[1:50:21] challenge you this morning more than 40
[1:50:23] revivals one or two good members in a
[1:50:26] church right a good cleanse member set
[1:50:29] in an example with a face shining with
[1:50:31] the glory of God with sweetness and
[1:50:33] humility to stand there in the power of
[1:50:35] God and watch when somebody gets sick
[1:50:38] and they'll call that person to come
[1:50:39] pray or you might make fun of them and
[1:50:41] their tyre is deflated and so forth you
[1:50:44] might all this nonsense say but let
[1:50:47] death strike you one time you'll find
[1:50:49] out what them struggles begin to come
[1:50:51] who that real sincere person is in the
[1:50:53] church they've been I believe if there's
[1:50:57] a genuine desire for a revival God will
[1:50:59] send that genuine God will send that
[1:51:01] revival I mean it's it's but it's what
[1:51:03] you want you get what you expect you say
[1:51:08] you're just reaching way out there no I
[1:51:10] don't believe I am the scripture would
[1:51:13] say the scripture would say in in in
[1:51:17] Psalms 84 and 11 for the Lord God as a
[1:51:23] son and a shield the Lord will give
[1:51:25] grace and glory no good thing will he
[1:51:28] withhold from them that walk uprightly
[1:51:31] no good thing we say it together no good
[1:51:36] thing will he withhold from them that
[1:51:38] walk uprightly no good thing now we have
[1:51:43] to recognize he makes us walk uprightly
[1:51:45] it's not you that's all I'm gonna be a
[1:51:48] Christian going to does no no his Spirit
[1:51:50] comes unto you and he's the Christian in
[1:51:52] your life he makes you just right he
[1:51:53] makes you speak right he makes you act
[1:51:55] right that's him in you so he's the one
[1:51:58] that causes us to walk uprightly this is
[1:52:00] no good thing will he withhold from them
[1:52:05] why do we put up with the devil why do
[1:52:09] we put up with circumstances amen
[1:52:14] why do we why do we just say well this
[1:52:16] is just how it has to be no good thing
[1:52:19] he said well they've gone off into the
[1:52:22] world they don't is shouldn't God no
[1:52:24] good thing just letting it just you know
[1:52:27] these words have been you know I was
[1:52:29] having fellowship with brother Emerson
[1:52:30] driving to brother
[1:52:31] Thompson's funeral and he brought up the
[1:52:33] scripture and I was just thinking God
[1:52:36] doesn't put anything he doesn't just
[1:52:38] this is not just filler
[1:52:39] he didn't just put the scripture in
[1:52:41] there just to say isn't it nice and put
[1:52:43] it on Instagram or on our fridge he's
[1:52:45] challenging you he put that in he put
[1:52:48] that in his word that someone someone's
[1:52:50] gonna believe it
[1:52:51] someone's gonna take God at His Word and
[1:52:53] say Lord this is my portion he follow me
[1:52:56] someone is gonna believe the scripture
[1:52:59] and someone is gonna anchor to someone's
[1:53:01] soul Lord you could not withhold the
[1:53:03] salvation of my family you could not
[1:53:05] withhold their Redemption you could not
[1:53:07] withhold nothing you said you withhold
[1:53:09] nothing no good things
[1:53:10] I mean salvation is a good thing
[1:53:12] redemption is a good thing hallelujah
[1:53:14] someone's gonna say yes Lord yes I'm
[1:53:17] gonna take you at your word see God
[1:53:20] loves us to take him at his word
[1:53:23] God loves it he put that in there you
[1:53:28] say well that's just you just reaching
[1:53:30] way out no no Mary would be sitting in a
[1:53:32] synagogue and the priest was inspired to
[1:53:35] go to Isaiah 9 and 6 and begin to read
[1:53:37] about the son being born and the Messiah
[1:53:39] and and and and and she heard that word
[1:53:42] in church and something gripped in her
[1:53:44] soul many heard that when Isaiah
[1:53:47] prophesied and I believe everyone who
[1:53:49] had a little girl maybe that age could
[1:53:50] have a child say our daughter is going
[1:53:53] to fulfill the prophets prophesy but God
[1:53:55] knew who would fulfill it and then there
[1:53:58] she was she heard that and anchored in
[1:53:59] her heart and she began to ponder on
[1:54:01] that Scripture and they would read about
[1:54:03] it her and him and I mean her and Joseph
[1:54:05] and and then she met the angel Gabriel
[1:54:08] that scripture was sitting here for
[1:54:10] about 800 years waiting for someone they
[1:54:15] men
[1:54:15] he said well but I'm not married but
[1:54:17] you're the Bride of Christ hallelujah
[1:54:20] says no good thing will he withhold from
[1:54:22] them that walk uprightly don't take that
[1:54:29] lightly
[1:54:30] remember I'm preaching to myself if he
[1:54:32] said that he will not withhold a good
[1:54:34] thing well then you got to take or what
[1:54:38] all those good things are and say Lord
[1:54:40] you will not withhold this from me
[1:54:42] you'll not withhold it hallelujah but
[1:54:49] the thing is we we explain away things
[1:54:51] well this is just how it has to be and
[1:54:53] maybe they're not predestinated and
[1:54:55] maybe this who would say such a thing
[1:54:58] who would say such a thing I wouldn't
[1:55:01] put up with that kind of reasoning Oh
[1:55:02] they've gone so far they've said too
[1:55:04] much they've done it uh who cares about
[1:55:06] that I mean we should have it in our
[1:55:09] hearts if our family come along they're
[1:55:10] not safe something should be in a say
[1:55:12] Lord may there be such an atmosphere in
[1:55:14] my life I mean may make the atmosphere
[1:55:16] crying around me draw you him I mean for
[1:55:20] them hallelujah that they they step into
[1:55:22] an atmosphere of the Holy Ghost they
[1:55:24] begin to realize that God is alive and
[1:55:26] they give their lives you know many of
[1:55:28] us can sit in church for too long than
[1:55:29] just sit in church
[1:55:30] I mean without having a real experience
[1:55:32] and without putting the word into action
[1:55:34] member God loves us to challenge him at
[1:55:38] his word
[1:55:39] take it challenge God with his word God
[1:55:42] Lord Lord you said this you know brother
[1:55:49] on Spencer she had a testimony where he
[1:55:51] was he had a stroke he was in hospital
[1:55:55] and because of all you know he couldn't
[1:55:57] be in much lights as and darkness and
[1:55:58] the ward here ozone or the room and
[1:56:00] they'd go chicken with flashlights and
[1:56:02] so on and he said one why not there when
[1:56:04] he's when he's in this state the Lord
[1:56:08] came down he's praying the Lord came
[1:56:09] down to the room and a nurse came in and
[1:56:13] and and she she said to him mr. Spencer
[1:56:18] you are you awake yes ma'am you've been
[1:56:21] praying not a Christian
[1:56:23] yes ma'am said and and she said you know
[1:56:28] when I walked into this room I felt
[1:56:29] something different I've seen the people
[1:56:32] who have come in and visited you and so
[1:56:33] on and I've never been a Christian but I
[1:56:35] need Jesus and she knelt down next thing
[1:56:40] you know and and and and she asked him
[1:56:42] can you pray I'll pray here he is
[1:56:44] suffering from the effects of a stroke
[1:56:46] God comes down we have no excuse
[1:56:50] we have no excuse yes I am sick I've got
[1:56:53] this problem now if he can lie there
[1:56:55] after a stroke in a hospital and God can
[1:56:57] come down on the same color and someone
[1:57:00] and she and she gave her life to the
[1:57:02] Lord never been a church for never being
[1:57:04] a Christian because God lives how about
[1:57:07] you and I hallelujah and then when she
[1:57:12] gave her house the Lord walked out he
[1:57:14] said the symptoms of the stroke lift
[1:57:16] them we have and I look at that and that
[1:57:21] challenges me because I sit there in my
[1:57:24] pity party and all this is wrong and
[1:57:25] work as busy and this is going under
[1:57:27] editor and we can miss God coming and
[1:57:30] actually living in our day because of
[1:57:34] what we think we're going through Lord
[1:57:37] Jesus help me you say well that's that's
[1:57:41] that's him what about you the same Lord
[1:57:44] Jesus Christ that lives in his life I
[1:57:46] trust lives in your life lives in my
[1:57:48] life the same God he knows you should
[1:57:50] know as well that's the atmosphere we
[1:57:53] create around us well how do we make a
[1:57:56] nice atmosphere say nice things I was
[1:57:58] saying to the girls if you can't you
[1:58:00] know there's a saying if you have
[1:58:01] nothing good to say say nothing at all
[1:58:04] amen brother Rome would say this and and
[1:58:09] maybe I'll just close on this note he
[1:58:12] says there's some perfect faith he says
[1:58:17] he says let's just stand still for a
[1:58:20] minute let's just worship God in our
[1:58:21] heart
[1:58:22] think of it God he's here he's here who
[1:58:24] who identified himself as being the word
[1:58:26] in the beginning was the word the Word
[1:58:29] was with God and the Word was God and
[1:58:31] the Word was made flesh and dwelt among
[1:58:33] us the same yesterday today and forever
[1:58:35] the word is sharper than a two-edged
[1:58:38] sword even a discerner of the thoughts
[1:58:40] and intents now we've come here what
[1:58:43] you've come here for and what your
[1:58:45] purpose of being here and who you are
[1:58:46] identify Jesus Christ to be Messiah and
[1:58:49] today it identifies some being the same
[1:58:51] Messiah
[1:58:52] yesterday today and forever the great
[1:58:54] physician who was here who said these
[1:58:56] signs shall follow them that believe if
[1:58:59] they lay their hands on the sick they
[1:59:01] shall recover and if you say to this
[1:59:03] mountain
[1:59:03] be moved and don't doubt in your heart
[1:59:05] but can believe that he can create
[1:59:07] squirrels who has no way at all or
[1:59:10] nothing there to believe it's my own
[1:59:12] faith that goes and does that my faith
[1:59:14] and what he challenged me to ask he
[1:59:17] challenged me to ask it and I received
[1:59:20] his challenge in the obedience to his
[1:59:22] word I asked it and it appeared he was
[1:59:25] challenged to say it and he says I
[1:59:28] accept God at his challenge I spoke it
[1:59:31] and it was there what about you what
[1:59:34] about you to take guard it is worse or
[1:59:37] are you afraid to draw your sword and
[1:59:38] kill your enemy I think we've lived with
[1:59:42] the devil too long we've lived in a
[1:59:44] backslidden state too long
[1:59:46] we've lived in a state of just just
[1:59:47] going through the motion of church and
[1:59:49] I'm in the message it means nothing
[1:59:52] unless that message lives in you it
[1:59:55] means nothing
[1:59:55] a man could just be a tag or a phrase or
[1:59:58] just another church this is not just
[2:00:00] another church they'll talk about the
[2:00:01] bride around the world where the Bride
[2:00:02] of Christ where the church and living
[2:00:04] God he says in my name now shall cast
[2:00:07] out Devils in the name of Jesus Christ
[2:00:08] he's talking to you not just talking to
[2:00:11] the preacher talking to you hallelujah
[2:00:15] he challenged he says he challenged me
[2:00:18] to ask it and I accepted his challenge
[2:00:20] no good thing will he withhold from them
[2:00:24] that walk uprightly you have a problem
[2:00:30] he can relieve you of that problem the
[2:00:33] thing the arrests are worth you don't
[2:00:34] have to put up with it no more
[2:00:37] it's purely up to you what do you want
[2:00:40] out of this service I want God to sweep
[2:00:43] down that when we walk out of this the
[2:00:45] things that we carried in here we don't
[2:00:47] carry no more that's that's what I am
[2:00:50] expecting that's what I'm looking for
[2:00:53] but what do you want you say that's just
[2:00:57] sick and pull no that's third pull so
[2:01:00] it's got to be made flesh made
[2:01:01] manifested but what do you want let's
