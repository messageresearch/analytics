to have you amen praise the Lord amen welcome and also we have a youth service this afternoon about quarter 2 amen so Jimmy and myself is speaking and Mo's going to be song leading so we're going to have a blessed time amen so God bless you let's take uh let's take our Bibles this morning we're going to go to uh Ephesians chapter 6 uh once again and um it's going to continue on in this in this thought here so I just trying to get used to being up here with these things and trying to run through things oh okay this will be interesting because I can't see what I'm seeing up there what you're seeing so anyway we'll see how we go but I guess if I can see it here I you can see it there okay we're all good amen so Ephesians uh chapter 6 and verse 10 here says finally my brethren be strong in the Lord and the power of His might put on the whole armor of God that ye may be able to stand against the Ws of the devil for we wrestle not against flesh and blood but against principalities against Powers against rulers of the darkness of this world against spiritual wickedness in high places wherefore take unto you the whole armor of God that you may be able to withstand in the evil day now this is the evil day right and having done all to stand stand therefore having your loins GT about with truth and having on the breastplate of righteousness and and your feet shod with the preparation of the gospel of peace above all taking the shield of Faith wherewith ye shall be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked and take the helmet of salvation and the sword of the spirit which is the word of God praying always with all prayer and supplication in the spirit watching there unto with all perseverance and supplication for All Saints so I'm going to continue speaking about taking the shield of faith above all taking the shield of Faith amen let's bow our heads in a word of prayer this morning amen let's dedicate Our Lives to uh to the one we love almighty God truly Lord thank you that you have reserved for us a place in your great land we look forward to walking in that land lord seeing you as you are being with you father and we want to thank you also dear God that while we are here Lord your spirit is Among Us dear God that we're not here alone in this Walk we're not uh just following some nice idea but Lord we're following the revelation of your word and we thank you for that and we want to pray this morning Lord that you'd just come and take complete control father we come to worship you in spirit and in truth father so I pray you just come and Lord we surrender Our Lives into your hands may you cleanse Us by your blood forgive us all of our sins and our wrongs Lord all evil negative thinking as well father take it from us Lord be glorified father may we have a mount Transfiguration experienced when we see you glorified father in the name of Jesus Christ granted be with those who couldn't be here today as well in Jesus Christ's name amen amen God bless you friends you can have your seats this morning so I want to continue this thought about taking above all taking the shield of faith now if you turn with me we're just going to go into a different kind of a a a section a bit but the Apostle Paul would would speak about about how we have this Earthly you know though this Earthly Tabernacle of this house were dissolved this is 2 Corinthians 5 he says we have a building of God a house not made with hands Eternal in the heavens for in this we groan earnestly Desiring to be clothed upon with our house which is from Heaven if so that being clothed we shall not be found naked for we that are in the Tabernacle do Gran being burdened not that we would be unclothed but clothed upon that mortality might be swallowed up of life now he that wrought us for the selfsame as God who also hath given unto us the earnest of the spirit therefore we are always confident knowing that whilst we're we are at home in the body we are absent from the Lord for we walk by faith and not by sight now we we speak about the shield of faith we know we've been going over how you can you know quench the fiery darts the by by by agreeing with the revelation of the word of God above your feelings or above the the the vibe the feeling you know that's being projected upon you and but then if you get hit by a doubt is because you agree with that doubt or that thought above what the revelation of God says now I was thinking about shields where Shields we think of just a defensive thing but I want to say today that the shield a shield is is actually a weapon to use in your hand I it's more than just something to quench fiery darts to protect yourself but you can use a shield to attack someone with amen where you can knock someone down you can knock the weapon out of their hand with that shield and so I want to say that this The Shield of faith we are walking by The Shield of faith I mean we're walking by this Revelation this morning that's why the Apostle Paul would say we walk by faith and not by sight see we don't walk as other men walk amen as as Paul would say in 1 Corinthians 3 he says for ye are yet carnal for with there is for whereas is there among you envyings and strife and divisions are you not carnal and walk as men so if there's strife and envying and divisions you're walking as a man but you're just just carnal men but we're not built to walk as a carnal people anymore once upon a time we did when we when we were without God we walked carnally right but then God rich in Mercy when he reached down his hand for you transformed your life revealed himself to you you're not called to walk by your five senses anymore but you're called to walk by the revelation of the word amen so we got to understand that we the five senses that we so enjoy are not made to contact Heaven that's right they're not made your eyes weren't made to contact God your touch your smell your taste your hearing all those five senses are not made to contact God but yet we rely on them so much for this Earthly Journey but I think if we rely on the shield of Faith a lot more than our five senses we'll have a different kind of a journey amen because our five senses will declare a lot of things to us and not and most of them are actually wrong this is the era of fake news false news manipulated images AI made things you you know it's even down now to people create uh you know false videos of people doing acts and things you know there's you know there's um what do you call it revenge porn and deep fakes and all these kind of evil things Revenge you know videos that people make of people they take images of people they put on other people's bodies and say that was the person it can look very real it can look like it's that person but it's not that person at all what is it but if you look at that thing I pray none of us you ever do but if you look at those things you'll think that's that person but it's not it's a False Image right and your your eyes are lyed to you by that thing so it's listen we we live in an age of manipulation and the devil wants to manipulate your spirit manipulate control you bring you down but God doesn't want us to walk by the five senses he wants us to walk by faith by Revelation amen and and we are living in an age where there's a people upon the Earth that can walk by Revelation now don't shut down on me this morning this is very important because the devil is not dumb he's very very meticulous he's very methodical and he and he's planned he's planned his attack he knows how to get you amen but the revelation of the word defeats him any place anytime anywhere amen so you can either be a slave to sin or you can be victorious over sin it's your choice amen so we want to we want to realize that that faith is made to contact God not our five senses amen so this faith that we walk by is made to contact God now who wants to contact God I believe that's why we're here this morning we want to contact God that's why we open the Bible we want to contact God that's why we listen to the message we want to contact God that's why we pray cuz we want to contact God Amen so we got to walk we but we must walk by Revelation amen because if you walk by Revelation you won't be caught up in the five senses Joseph had an incredible journey that's very easy to gloss over the hardships of his life you know we read he was put into prison he sold as a slave you know how his brothers hated him they actually wanted to kill him we it's very easy to kind of gloss over the the the feelings that that would have you know projected and felt imagine imagine walking into a house sitting at the dinner table your brothers hate you that's not a nice house to be in you don't really there's a feeling you don't feel welcome your father loves you but your your siblings that really your own flesh and blood hate you see they were firing a lot of fiery DTS and sure Joseph you know we all got to mature we're all got to grow but Joseph was living by a prophecy because he had two dreams where one day his family will bow down before him isn't that right I know I'm just kind of you know going through these things quickly but you see so his life turned into a faith walk his life turned into a faith walk he was walking by that Shield of Faith now you see you see many things he did not understand in this walk I'm just trying to catch up to where I am to make sure I'm oh if I miss it I miss it hey God will give it right but you see now his his his Earthly Journey many things he did not understand he did not understand why he was um you know he's down in Egypt fully he sure didn't understand why you know um you know that lie was told on him by poter his wife then he's in prison all these things are very hard things that he had to go through but he was walking by faith because those two dreams I know I've said it before but I pray it grips us just two dreams gripped his life and his whole life was now governed by those two dreams he didn't know how it was going to be fulfilled didn't know when it was going to be fulfilled but he was so gripped this is going to happen one day how's it going to happen I don't know but God's declared it's going to happen and if it's going to happen it's going to happen that Revelation came from God and he walked by that faith of those two dreams his whole life and then finally he came to this position yeah amen now you think about these Israelites eye for an eye tooth for tooth revenge is very much in their blood but you see because he walked by faith and not by the five senses he said don't be grieved nor be angry with yourselves you sold me hether for God did send me before you to preserve life you see he realized that his walk was because of Revelation his you know he he was everything he happened happened to him that this would happen this moment this moment would happen in his life you see I've been through the ringer Joseph went through the ringer right he went through the ringer but he didn't he didn't let the five senses dominate him did he feel sad he would have felt very sad did he feel alone he would have felt very alone did he feel like Lord Where What Where are you in this he would have felt like that but yet the Revelation held hallelujah amen see we've got to as as um see he said of you know don't be angry you know no doubt some of his brothers were like man we're going to get it now remember when their father died they're all afraid of Joseph now so surely he's going to get his revenge and it's like they just didn't get it you see those who have the revelation of the word they get it Joseph got it the brothers receiv received the benefit of it but they didn't get it you see that's why but we can't walk how how other people respond we can't walk by how other people react we got to walk according to the word and the word alone see God wants you to walk with him alone he doesn't want you to walk with your family and God or the church even and God he wants you and himself alone in this walk that when Mom and Dad aren't there your siblings aren't there church ain't there nothing's there you're walking with the word amen amen praise the Lord because we must know we must know how to fight a good Warfare right and Joseph fought a good Warfare I mean the campaign he was in he walked a good you know he fought a good battle why because he did not walk by his five senses he didn't walk by his reasoning his understanding his conscious any of those things he walked by faith amen David did the same thing now isn't it amazing this is uh this Psalm here A Psalm of David when he fled from Absalon on his son see but then so so it's during this time David would say oh but thou oh Lord a shield for me and a glory and a lifter of my head so so he's saying Lord You're a shield of Revelation you're a shield of faith for me I mean during a very confusing time during the time when Absalon his son had thrown him off the throne he had to run for his life very confusing time you know David no doubt would be wondering is his men for him or against him as counsels they for me or against me it's very murky time when there's a rebellion going on especially within a family but David would ascribe God as a shield from during these times amen and then when he came down that when he was he was he was on the Run uh you know y he was on the run you know finally yo it's amazing it's amazing who comes to talk to you and kick you when you're down when you're up no one wants to touch you but when you're down oh boy everyone's opinion comes out oh it's my time now I can really give a piece of my mind how I feel about these things yeah but you see it's incredible isn't it really you know we've all been there it's like thank you for telling me that I did not need to know but they feel like somehow this thing that's been Liv you know it's been buzzing around in them for years I've got to tell this person this thing but they're not down yet basically that's what they're saying anyway you see but you see now David was on the Run he was going with his mighty men then this then this um do we have his name there shimi he's a he he's a benjamite he's of the he's of the House of Saul finally you know because we know David took the kingship over after Saul died in the Battle and so so David was not of the House of Saul he wasn't a benjamite he was from the tribe of Judah but then finally this man from from Benjamin says now's my time this man's On The Run finally I can give him a piece of my mind and then so he starts throwing rocks and starts cursing him and starts doing all these things and then even David's mighty man said am I going to let the head of this dog you know leave his head on his shoulders you know he's cursing my King but then David because he wasn't walking by the five senses you think about this he's been reject he he's on the run from his family see we have a choice David has a choice in these moments is he going to walk by faith what is that Faith David you're King I've anointed you King you're the king over my household your son Solomon's going to rule on the throne you know all these things David already knows so now is he going to walk by that Revelation or is he going to walk by his five senses that when his enemies come and start cursing him when he's down is he going to say to his man take his head off it's easy to say take his head off see the devil wants to pull us down into a carnal realm right but victories are not done when we get carnal victories are done when we walk by Revelation Amen brother Brown will be standing in Oregon and we know Tommy Osborne was in the meeting and it inspired actually his ministry where where a maniac came up demon possessed big man came up before brother brandham and said I'm going to tear you Lim from Lim standing right there before him on the platform and you begin to spit his face and curse him now we know brother Brandon was a boxer before he got converted so naturally he could naturally box and maybe he could have socked him when he would have been on the ground but the devil was was inspiring that man to try and drag the prophet from a spiritual realm into a caral realm because when the devil has us in a caral realm he's got us amen but when we walk by faith amen we've got him amen so now so so the devil is trying to get the the prophet to come down into a carnal realm but then the prophet did not let himself go that way but he said actually I felt sorry for the man he began to feel sorry for the man actually had love and compassion for the man and then when that man said I'm going to te limb from limb you know it wasn't brother Ram that said it but God spoke out and said because you've challenged the spirit of living God you'll fall at my feet that wasn't brother Braham saying that that was God through him I mean speaking that and we know what happened the man tried to punch him fell on his feet the police came said as he did no he's just passed out as he delivered now he worships the spirit but you see as the thing is the devil tried to drag the prophet down into a carnal realm he tries to do that to us all the time but we don't have to stay that way but God enrich in Mercy amen because God doesn't want you to walk in your Humanity he wants you to walk by faith CU God wants to contact you it's not just us wanting to contact God God wants to contact us hallelujah amen so so even even David would say here no the Lord told him to do this and there's nowhere in the story where God said hold up everyone shimy I got a question for you did God tell you this no it's not in the he didn't ask him but because he was walking by faith he realized actually God has bidden him God has allowed this whole thing to transpire so that because he could see the big picture like Joseph could see the big picture Brethren the reason you hated me cuz God didn't want me in my father's tent he wanted me here the reason you wanted to kill me was because God didn't want me in my father and he wanted me here amen hallelujah you see he could see the big picture see Lord help us see the big picture you say in everyday life absolutely amen because Joseph he conducted his everyday life because he was walking by faith he saw value in every he saw value being in prison he saw value in part of his house he saw value being hated by his Brethren CU he could look back and see God your hand was in it all God help us be that way amen and every day boring mondayitis life praise God that's how we should be amen so David said know God's told him to do it amen what a victory that was now let's see where I am that we just go here amen so now now we are we are to walk by faith brother Bram would say that faith is the super sense it's superior to the five senses a amen it see see the six Sense come for this reason why did it come the six sense is Faith the super sense the six sense came for this reason to make the five senses in you deny anything that's contrary to God's word amen so no matter what your five senses declare that super sense of faith is to overcome all the or to take dominion over those things that though what that that your faith will declare things contrary to what you see feel taste smell and here amen that's what the six senses for the scriptures speaks of casting down reasonings the five senses well you can reason well why should this why should he do that but the six sense see takes dominion over the five senses I mean aren't you glad you got a stronger sense than what you see we see a lot of bad but Faith tells me otherwise I mean I hear a lot of evil but Faith tells me otherwise amen hallelujah now we know that the church is built upon Revelation built upon Faith right the shield that you carry is very powerful you can actually see through this Shield you can walk by it hold it up and walk and you can push your enemy down and cut his head off with the sword of the spirit amen but you see the whole church is built upon Revelation Revelation is Faith amen and you cannot have a revelation without being faith faith is a revelation because it's something that's revealed to you faith is a revelation faith is something that's been revealed to you like it was to Abraham that he could call anything contrary to what had been revealed to him as though it wasn't so now Faith that's what faith is and the is the re revelation of God the church is built upon a revelation the entire the whole entire body amen this is very important amen now in the church ages we know that every blessing that comes down is actually comes down into every age right this is from the Philadelphian age but it applies to us he says he that overcometh will I make a pillar in the temple of my God and he shall not go out no more and I'll write upon him the name of my God and the name of the city of my God which is the New Jerusalem which cometh out of the heaven from my God and I will write upon him my new name now the pillar is actually part of the foundation right it's not a separate piece of the building it's actually the foundation goes up into the pillar that holds up the house amen so in other words brother I'm saying here is that everything that was in the foundation is in you amen so in other words part of the foundation what will I give him I'll put in him the doctrine of the Apostles and prophets from the beginning and give him the Revelation what the prophets say about him well he's a counselor he's a Prince of Peace he's the Mighty God he's the Everlasting father that's what they said the prophets the apostles and he that uh can overcome all the synagogue of Satan keep himself free and look straight to the gate I'll make him a pillar I'll put him back in the foundation of my word in the house of my God oh my I'll put him right there in that pillar in the foundation where you stay right in the word amen I like that brother it's good so everything so if you so if your life is built upon Revelation I'm just wanting to talk about what you can draw strength from right what you can draw strength from right because the the foundation is the true word of God hallelujah right now brother R made a statement he says that whenever man gets back to the word of God they have Revival right so so God doesn't want us to we say well but we have the present truth and we do but we've got to walk with the word and have Revival or we can walk with our five senses and not have Revival you see so it's very you say well I'm a message believer that's just a nice tag but are you walking with the word or are you walking with your father senses you see if you want to have Revival walk with the word and not your five senses am mean if you want to see God live if you want to see an Awakening in your life walk with the word I mean you see the devil's so shrewd he will he will put our desires upon his things and then people get numb they get IND and they wonder what's wrong with them it's because they're feeding on the wrong thing I mean they're drawing strength from the wrong thing it's like if you live on McDonald's every day of your life you're not going to get the nutrition you get from something else I mean I like McDonald's it tastes good but I feel empty afterwards it doesn't sustain me and it's like the things of the world it may taste good to the flesh but it doesn't sustain you you know it doesn't give you spiritual vitamins to walk in this world you see but the thing is people will will will wonder why are they numb why do they feel indifferent well I'll go into that later this afternoon but you see it's because their their their desires have G on the wrong thing and that's how the devil traps people but you see now we are built on this Foundation of the revelation of the word so everything that's in the word now is in US praise God now I'm just going to lay a foundation because I'm going somewhere with this okay I am and I'll actually go somewhere with this not just lay foundation and quit okay so now you see the six sense The Sixth Sense doesn't see that at all any of the carnal things it's so far beyond that it's so much higher than this until you don't even have any reasonings at all with it so it's so far above these natural sensus so far above your reasoning your mental faculties the six sense is far greater than those things that it doesn't have any reasonings about it at all so when the six sense goes to work I mean a revelation strikes your soul that becomes your reality and it's not an alternative reality it is the reality because by faith these worlds were made by faith amen we are here by faith Abraham by faith Moses they did many things by faith and it was their reality amen like when Moses went into Egypt his reality was God is going to bring these people out amen and it wasn't just you know these days people say oh this is my truth or this is your truth there's only one truth Jesus said I'm the way the truth and the life amen so there's not just different versions of truth there's one truth and then then the rest is all wrong right so when Moses received the Revelation from the burning bush he picked up a shield of faith that he did not have in the beginning because he failed miserably when he tried to deliver the people the first time but at the burning bush he received that Shield of Faith he rose it up and he went down into Egypt he said let my people go because he was walking he was looking at the world through faith he wasn't beforehand he was looking through a carnal understanding well I'm the promised son my mama told me so the prophecy and what she said matches I must be him look I'm now a prince in Egypt am I talking too fast are you am I okay okay good you see so so he was looking through a caral he was looking through his five senses his reasoning he was looking through his reasoning before he had to run from Egypt saying look I can I can do this I'm a military man I'm a prince I've got influence I can I can deliver Israel I know how to fight battles I can train them I know where the weapons are I know the weaknesses of the army of Egypt I can do this but you see he was looking through it the wrong way and when you look at things through you know the wrong way it ain't going to work and we get frustrated we get annoyed why is this not working you're looking at it the wrong way but if you hold up a shield of Faith now like when Moses received that Shield of Faith he was looking through the promise and it was revealed to him it wasn't a nice idea anymore it was a reality amen that's why when he went into Egypt and Pharaoh said no he says well God's going to make you God's going to make you because I'm not compromising he said we're not leaving one hoof behind we're not leaving our old our young our young people whatever old people everyone's coming cuz he was looking through the Revelation he was holding that Shield of faith and looking at it and saying that was his reality and what happened faith made it material you know that same faith in Moses in you you know the same faith that bring the prophecy concerning you to pass is in you that same faith not a different faith not a lesser Faith the same Faith Amen brother brah said that if Moses under the blood of blls and goats can bring creation how much more are people under the blood of Jesus Christ and mean the spoken words being restored to where it's not our human humanly trying to speak something no it's God speaking through you Hallelujah I it's going to come to this I want to show where's William there's Goliath's head reading David and Goliath and you I said about David cutting off his head he's like where's the picture they don't show it so I found a picture now before this happened before this happened do you think it was David humanly saying to Goliath I'm going to cut your head off do you think it was David humanly saying who is this uncircumcised Philistine do you think it was David humanly saying I'm going to kill this guy no it was God in him speaking I mean when David said to Goliath I'm going to kill you this day cut your head off and I'm going to feed all the host of the Philistines to the birds of the air that wasn't him that was God speaking through him I mean he was looking through a shield of faith of Revelation I've been anointed king I've been given dominion over every enemy that comes on my land so you must die I mean you cannot stand and it's the same thing with you and I friends we've been anointed by a Vindicated Prophet this word has got full of anoint anting amen God has poured it out in his fullness in this day amen upon you and you've got to realize I'm not a slave I'm not a victim I'm an overcomer hallelujah amen hallelujah you got to cut off the devil's head and raise it up raise it up so the others can rally and say Yes hallelujah hallelujah hallu hallelujah sir amen he raised up gli's head it wasn't him just being a boy saying I can do it it was God saying I can do it and David just surrendered himself to that leading to that anointing Hallelujah glory to God praise the Lord amen see David's Faith looked far above reasoning it looked far above the fear that was permeating the camp and the intimidation of the enemy you see faith faith knows no defeat faith is perfect what are you looking through today what glass are you looking through your reasoning your history your past what you've done what you've come what are you looking at through through Revelation Faith brings things where there uh where there is no things to be bought Faith creates Faith takes doubt away takes NE negative makes positive how beautiful the old man had a basis of Faith that's uh Simeon in the temple faith is not mythical something mentally worked up it's absolutely fundamentally result that happens in a person's heart amen so we don't work ourselves up into Faith it's not an emotional thing that we somehow go emotional and jump into it no it comes into the heart emotion comes with it sure amen but it's something that anchors in the heart that God said so it is amen praise the Lord I don't know where I am but hey that's fine you see Faith creates Faith changes things I remember when we were living in fricken Grove there was a growth growing on Chris side of her head this white thing was growing was it shooting pains down it was it was a yeah right we had just heard a testimony of a brother uh I don't know where it was from but he had a growth on his nose or something so every morning when he went to shave he' put his finger on and say I curse you in the name of Jesus Christ and so she started doing that and then one day a revelation anchored into her heart this thing isn't part of me and she cursed in the name of Jesus Christ and it fell off into her hand roots and all why because Faith creates Faith brings a change amen it's not just a nice idea when it anchors in your heart you realize no that's when faith has gone into action amen and that's what then Faith changes things amen praise the Lord and the super sense is the Holy Spirit the faith of God that dwells in you and if you'll let the five senses be yielded to the six sense it'll guide you and bring all the other five senses under control of that super sense for it's so far above the natural sense as the spiritual man is above the natural it's as far as high as the heavens is above the natural man in his five senses it makes you believe things that you cannot cannot see it makes you act where you do not think the five senses would ever think about the devil can't can get into those five senses and lie to you but he cannot touch that super sense I mean he cannot touch your faith amen he can lie to you through your reasoning your affections conscience imagination all those things memory he can light you through your eyes and the things you hear and see and all those things but he cannot touch that super sense it's far beyond his reach that came from God it's called faith and faith is that great thing amen if you read the you know Hebrews 11 and you know we we call it the Heroes of Faith or the the faith chapter by faith Noah built the ark by faith Moses by faith Abraham all these ones it was what did they do they yielded themselves to that Faith they let that Faith govern their lives they didn't let their five senses govern their lives they let that Faith take control Aben it may have taken a bit of time Abraham had 25 years but he got to a spot cuz at one point he was laughing at you know rolling in the Dust In God's feet laughing saying how can this ever be right but God was determined I've made you the father of many nations am mean you'll be the father of Faith amen so God brought him through a process until finally what he could feel he denied what he what he heard what he felt in his body what he saw in SE his body now this is not mind over matter but he took faith above as his reality that he's going to have the promised son above what he saw what he heard what he felt right so he took faith and let Faith take control of the five senses and when he did that amen what happened here came Isaac in his time now I've got to find this one because I don't want to miss these things now the five senses does not control The Sixth Sense this is from if you want to hear a good sermon listen to a super sense 1959 but the Sixth Sense controls the five senses the super sense controls the natural senses and the five senses is SE taste feel smell and here and the super sense is something that'll make you believe God's word for that's the only thing it'll speak about who God is our counselor you've got to really sit you know sometimes you got to sit back and think what is this voice talking to me who is this voice talking to me right because faith will only talk about faith in God's word that's what the super sense talks to you about I mean it does not talk to you about anything negative right because remember Satan is a perverter God is our counselor and Satan will pervert counsel because God if he's a counselor which he is he brings you to a conclusion he brings you to a clear this is the conclusion of the matter he may take you through and take you through the scripture and take you through what what you're going through but he always comes to a conclusion and it's clear and it gives you a peace who understands that right but the Devil is a perverter he will counsel you but he will never bring you to a conclusion it's like he just puts you on a hamster wheel of ideas and it rolls and it rolls and there's no conclusion he just maybe changes throws some more things in there and there's no conclusion to his Council that's how you know the devil's talking to you instead of God there's no conclusion and it doesn't give you a peace amen he will never bring you to a conclusion he just wants you to run through those ideas over and over and the what could be and the what all these variables and stuff but God just brings a simple answer that brings a conclusion now remember Satan is the Angel of the bottomless pit Revelations chapter 9 he at Revelations chapter n he falls right the angel fell amen he's a fallen angel that means his counsel will cause you to fall this is how you know the devil's talking to you if you he will cause you to fall cause you to fall into anger jealousy and resentment he causes you to fall out with everyone that's what his counsel does it brings separation it doesn't bring it doesn't bring families together doesn't bring parents and children together doesn't bring churches together doesn't bring families together no it causes a separation ation and causes you to fall amen it doesn't give you a stability doesn't give you a peace like God does Amen no it causes you to fall amen yo no one understands me I'm just misunderstood this is not fair if God's God why does he allow those things that's the devil's counsel amen if you because he wants to put a doubt on God's word he he doesn't want Faith to control you he wants his unbelief to control you amen see he will always use reasoning against God's word and he'll always appeal to the five senses amen he'll show you all everything that's wrong with your parents he will show you everything wrong with your situation amen he will that's what he does just like you know with Moab you know King BAC would take balum because because he hiired balum remember to curse Israel and then so but then because God said to balum you'll only say what I say what I tell you to say and then so what balum started blessing Israel and then so BAC took is um took took balum to the hinder parts of Israel I'll show you the nasty things I'll show you their humanity and all the sin and all the trouble that's going on in Israel because he thought because this is the devil's counsel he wants to show you the negative right but then when God inspires balam to prophesy he says I see no iniquity in Jacob amen the shout of the king is among them amen it's a God's C and but was there sin in the camp yes was there Humanity yes were they caral Believers yes all those things were there but you see the true perspective of Israel was I see no iniquity in Jacob why because the blood of the bulls and goats was covering them I mean they walking in the king's presence God himself was among them amen so the devil but the devil will never will never cause you to look at those things he will never cause you to recognize the holy ghost in your parents or your siblings or the church cuz this Cil remember he's a fallen angel you're the devil is not a Believer he does not understand Faith he does not understand you amen he may understand Humanity but he he does not understand you because you've got a sick sense he knows nothing about amen but you see now he wants you to be who's ever felt frustrated let's be honest now we're human yeah good good some people are Angel no people are honest good thought man I'm going to sit down and you're going to give me some pointers anyway we've all felt frustrated why do we feel frustrated just the devil counseling us but he never gives you a way out see the lord always gives a way of Escape he gives you a conclusion right where the devil gets you on his hamster wheel and makes you feel frustrated right that's how you know I'm just telling you basically this is how you know the devil's talking to you right frustration begins to rule your life because he doesn't show you a way out frustration is when you do not have a clear Way Forward and the devil doesn't want you to see a clear Way Forward he wants you to see the obstacles the problems the obvious things that are there but there's no answer and that's why people get so frustrated because why they're listening to the wrong counselor amen see frustration is the feeling of being upset or annoyed as a result of being unable to change or achieve something Faith does not make you frustrated Faith gives you a peace gives you a determination gives you a boldness gives you a Zeal gives you a calmness because you know the way out cuz God's shown you the way out but the devil just makes you frustrated looks at the obstacles the problems you see the children of Israel two of the spies were walking with the shield of Faith they saw the promise they were looking at the promise through the Revelation the others just got frustrated there's Giants there's walls there's this problem this is here we can't get over this it's too big blah blah blah we're a grasshoppers these problems that wasn't Faith they weren't walking by The Sixth Sense they walking by the five senses you see and then you you know they complained against Moses and all these things the the sand and the problems in the desert all these things of course there was sand of course there was the desert there over years all those things were there but Caleb and Joshua and the younger generation weren't looking they weren't listening to the devil counseling them they were looking at looking through God's looking glass of Revelation and they said we're more than able to take the land amen yes sir amen so Satan will never give you a conclusion this is how you know you say well I've been listening to him a long time you got to get up out of his uh psychiatric chair psychiatrist chair you got to get up out of that thing it may be comfortable to to just say paor me and everything's wrong get up out of that thing am mean God's given you power over that thing God's given you dominion over every trouble I mean God's given you a way out but you got to listen to his voice amen and let Faith rule your life the Lord amen you say my problem's too big no sorry my problem's too complex now sorry you just don't understand me God does there was a sin question one day that was a big problem very complex problem very difficult problem God Sol it I'm not I'm not diminishing anything but I just want you to realize God solved it if he can take care of your mess of your sin he can take care of the mess you find yourself walking in I mean he can guide you through it he can show you a path I mean he can show you the way out oh but not me stop listening to that voice this is not fair life ain't Fair that's right but faith says there's a way out remember God wants us to be Overcomers an overcomer brother BR says doesn't just push through a pipe and made to overcome they have a part in the matter themselves what do that part of the matter to overcome their five senses to surrender to Faith and let Faith live above their five senses you've got a choice every day you got a choice you can either walk in your flesh or walk with God I'd rather walk with God than walk yep amen you see God after you've been tried a while what does he want to do make you perfect establish strengthen and settle you that's what his counsel does it makes you perfect it establishes you doesn't destabilize you doesn't throw you with a million questions like the serpent Eve y haath God said and when people try and throw questions on the word of God what are they doing that's a serpent speaking it doesn't stabilize anything well if God is God why does this happen it's a question it's not building your faith it's trying to diminish your faith I mean strengthen you and settle you says what God does but it depends it depends what you're how you're looking as I said before Moses Moses and Pharaoh saw the same saw the same um same people they saw the Israelites they both saw outwardly slaves but Moses Through The Eyes of Faith saw Israel a prince with God I mean because remember the word says out of Egypt I've called my son not just talking about Jesus but as the Lesser one was Israel himself the people of Israel coming out of Egypt so by that by that Shield of Revelation Moses saw them I see a prince with God I I see Israel I don't see a nameless bunch of slaves no I see God's children coming out now I ask you the question what do you see when you look at your family what do you see when you look at your church what do you see when you look at your spouse or your children what do you see frustration if you're frustrated with your family or yourself you're looking through the wrong thing I mean you're looking through the devil's eyes I'll put it real BL you're looking through the devil's eyes of unbelief but see we should not be see the natural eye will cause you to see all the problem s and this is why many men will run away into a cave there's a lot of cave dwelling men in the Bible right Steve bristen brought it out in that gender confusion series very well he say well I'm here I'm not in the wilderness I haven't found a physical Cave the Cave can be right here you know a nothing box is just I'll just be here we are a nothing box is really just a cave it is I'm a man too so I'm talking to myself what do you do I'm just in my nothing box make sure you're not just hiding in a cave where where where you shut down emotionally shut down and just go through the motions of life we're not called just to go through the motions of life we're here to possess every promise of God am mean if we look at our family like I mean when my children were young some of you William still I think what's in them you're just holding a baby Lord what gift have you put in this put in this child Lord what are you going to use this child for Hall what is that that's looking through eyes of Faith you say well they naughty they do all these things I'm not looking at that I'm not looking at them just being adolesence and not mature I'm looking beyond that amen but I'm looking at a gift of God that's put in flesh amen so you're going to look beyond what they do sure we've got to raise them if we love them we'll correct them we'll guide them we'll protect them if we love them amen sure we'll do those things but are you just looking at that or are you looking beyond that say God this is an attribute of you and flesh what do you see when you look at your spouse are you do you see the same thing or oh she doesn't understand or he doesn't understand or he's this or she's that's the devil's language we're going to start thinking God's thoughts am me you may feel you know I heard someone say I can't remember who it was but you know you can think something but when you speak something that thought stops because you begin to because your mind is engaged with what you're saying so if the Devil Comes you're saying you're loser you're no good you'll never overcome you never this start speaking positive and that thought will actually become silent as you're speaking amen start confessing positive see because we've got to create an atmosphere you're an atmosphere generator right and you can create a negative atmosphere or a positive atmosphere and you create that Atmosphere by why what you speak the actions you use amen so if you look at your F see Moses what did he do I see Israel is slaves they're not meant to be slaves what does you do Lord I give myself to the court Lord I put them above my own need see he forsook Egypt because of Faith he would rather suffer the approach of being a slave with Israel than be a prince in Egypt so what he do he put his own life to one side he had a comfortable life backside the desert sure high-tempered wife all those things but that's you know whatever you know but you know he basically had entered into retirement he'd shut down in his cave and he is in retirement but God said I'm going to pull you out I'm going to pull you out of this cave women can be in caves too you know I'm going to pull you out of this thing because I've got a job for you to do and what he do he says Lord I lay aside the Comforts of my life that I have built the small little world that I have built in Midian and I'm going to give myself to your word that you can live through me amen do we do the same thing with our children with our family you say I'm busy we're all busy we got a lot of pressure we all got pressure but what are we what are we looking what are we seeing when we look oh he'll never amount to nothing you're looking through the wrong eyes oh she'll never grow up you're looking through the wrong eyes oh she'll never get it he'll never get it you're looking through the wrong eyes you say lord they're your child I mean lord they're your children lord they're your seed Hallelujah he say God can't do it who says that I'm serious but the but what happens people start agreeing they've gone too far they've been there too long they just said no I know David is not here but he said he'll never serve God didn't he say that what is he doing now he's serving God you he so it doesn't matter what the five senses declare doesn't matter how much emotions in it and how much determination appears to be there that ain't faith faith governs all things am hallelujah amen praise the Lord I'm excited because I'm passionate about these things we have a Divine faith that can Master any circumstance amen hallelujah but what Treasures in your heart is how your mouth will speak what Treasures in there I I pray it's good things not negative things I don't want to be filled with a $2 shop kind of a Treasures I want to be filled with Priceless things from God amen Amen brother Braham says this I'm going to I'm going to wind up soon he says when the new birth comes and it cannot come in until there's a death first and people don't want to die they they don't want the simple leadings of the Holy Spirit they want to make their own thinking out of it you can't think your thoughts you've got to think his thoughts let the mind that was in Christ be in you amen he thinks God's thoughts brings God's blessings God's power to you that's so it's so important to think God's thoughts and confess God's thoughts what that that's his word right fill your mouth fill your heart fill your mind with his promises you're going through a hard time find promises in the Bible find promises in the message write them down listen to them think about them let that become your daily diet amen it's going to give you strength it's going to give you Faith it's going to get you out of the Gloom of the fog of what you're trying to go through and give you a clear power forward amen I've never seen someone who has fit on the word of God in faith come out as a failure they've been established they've come to a place of full surrender they've got Victory amen that God is God has helped them in those circumstan so don't feed on the negative this is a very negative world we live in but it's also very very positive it depends what side you're on there's been such a positive age as this age in terms of the Gospel of Jesus Christ because there could be this morning the dead in Christ walk through that door that's a great age it's a great age hallelujah amen but you see we got to get into a condition where our hearts not our minds our hearts agree with the word of God brother R makes a statement he says a man fully surrendered to God is omnip potent that means all powerful did not he say in Mark 11:22 what whatever things you say and don't doubt in your heart it will come to pass you can have what you've said what happens when two omnipotents meet when God and man come together to omnipotent something's got to shake I mean whatever you'd say with that creative power of omnipotence of God knowing that he promised it and he said it in his word it creates a power that goes out yonder and brings things to pass things that is not it makes them as though they are because two omnipotents have met there he stands oh my isn't he wonderful I mean but notice now he says a man fully surrendered to God not just a man but a man fully surrendered to God Amen a man fully surrendered to God is ultimately he surrender to the fact that God is ultimately interested in forming him into his image of his word amen because we are ordained to be conformed to the image of his son right which is his word a man fully surrended to God realizes God's looking for his character in the people that's what he's looking for so whatever go through in life there's a purpose behind it that God would mold us and Forge us into His Image I mean that everything that happens no matter how dark how terrible it would make us better not bitter amen it would form the word in our lives amen because character is made through suffering we can't get away from it amen you say well I thought this was the good news it is the good news it's the best news cuz why cuz when you've come through the valley you're up on the mountain you can see what you were and see what you are and what you are Was Made In His Image amen what you were maybe you weren't like Joseph he wasn't made to rule as a as a spoiled favorite son he he could never go to Egypt and you know have the wisdom and things he did no no way he would have made his brothers pay big time but you see that character was formed in him through everyday life that he went through because he because he began to realize Lord you've got to get me fit to rule amen so a man that's fully or a man or woman that's fully surrender to God realizes that God is looking for character he's looking for his character his nature in US amen a man fully surrender to God is fully surrender to the fact that God is in control amen they're fully surrender to the fact that God's word is is him he's not separated from his word and it fully surrendered to the fact that he is a child of God remember a birth gives you Dominion not what you know in the Garden of Eden God birthed Adam and Eve right made them gave them Dominion because of what they were what God made them but then the serpent came along and said look you'll be like God if you know this so the devil wants to give you knowledge and think if you know enough then you'll have dominion but God says no by birth I give you Dominion I mean by birth by by by being born again you have dominion amen that could be a whole another thing amen a man fully surrender to God is fully surrender to the fact that though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death I'll fear no evil amen that's fully stren to the fact that though he slay me I'll trust him that's someone who's fully surrendered to God Amen they're fully surrendered to the fact that all things work together for good amen praise God now so someone who's fully surrender to God is omnipotent so it's when it's when the word goes it's not in their head anymore it comes into their heart and when it anchors in the heart it's a revelation and it's so amen praise the Lord Lord that's why we have that's why we try and build faith we create an atmosphere to build Faith that's why we sing Victorious songs you never see brother Isaac stand up there and sing I can't make it we won't win enjoy the tribulation that's where we'll swim no he doesn't he doesn't he doesn't do those kind of we don't sing those songs no cuz why no I'm thinking of the Rapture in my blessed home on you see why you know I'm I'm a mighty warrior feel in battle right because it builds faith it creates an atmosphere of faith and the idea of that is that your heart will agree with what the atmosphere that's been created amen and then what happens then then two omnipotence can meet and the supernatural can take place hallelujah it's like Christine before Camp even during Camp she had this look in her eyes said I want to see someone really changed and I realized that wasn't her she gets this look I realize that's not her talking and then and then of course Ezekiel comes and he's a different kind of a man now praise God and then the Lord and then Chris is talking to the Lord about this after camp and the Lord said to her it wasn't you praying that it wasn't even your desire it was God's desire see but God's desire dropped into one of his surrendered vessels and he spoke it and it happened the six sense took control CED an atmosphere of camp for Faith to rise sure many things happened there but that was one thing God said I want that it's it's his season I want him to come hallelujah it's what happened someone fully surrender to God is omnip potent something's got to shake Hallelujah we got to realize that same faith is in you and I amen but you got to hold up that Shield of Faith walk
