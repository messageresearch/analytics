[26:21] feel I was brother James come up on well
[26:35] singing I'm amazed I am I'm truly truly
[26:39] amazed that he loves me not that he
[26:43] loved me not that he's going through
[26:46] love me that he actually loves me in my
[26:48] position why am now sometimes through
[26:52] the day you just go Lord how can you how
[26:56] can you love this vessel and that makes
[27:01] me amazed that's a true definition of
[27:04] amazed I think it's it's so too much
[27:09] used that word that definition or struck
[27:12] awesome fail of words that I am amazed
[27:20] [Music]
[27:22] amazed that you love me
[27:28] [Music]
[27:33] how
[27:37] to your precious blood
[27:42] I can pardon and my scene
[27:49] Oh washed away all my sins are washed
[27:58] away I'm amazed
[28:06] thank you love me how you
[28:17] I am pardon my sin my sin away
[28:30] [Music]
[28:40] I'm amazed
[28:42] ah
[28:47] [Music]
[29:00] crashes flood I found
[29:05] and Massey
[29:10] [Music]
[29:18] [Music]
[29:20] hallelujah hallelu aren't you amazed
[29:24] that he loves you that's the most
[29:29] amazing thing because I was not lovable
[29:31] and he loved
[29:34] I think if God so loved us he so loved
[29:39] you that much that we ought to love him
[29:42] back the way that he loved us I mean and
[29:46] I just believe that the Lord's going to
[29:50] move tonight I just feel it in my heart
[29:52] and I want to preach a message that's
[29:56] called divine love
[29:57] produces divine faith which will produce
[30:00] divine healing because it all has to be
[30:04] rooted somewhere and it all starts with
[30:06] his love and these two see what the Lord
[30:10] does let's be Reverend - Herrmann just
[30:13] lit a spirit move what really spawned my
[30:17] thought on this message was I've often
[30:20] heard brother Branham say at least you
[30:24] have love you can't even have faith
[30:27] and I really started to say what's so
[30:31] strong between this connection between
[30:33] love and faith so that's what I want to
[30:35] find out so let's go and turn to mark
[30:40] I'll leave them the verse 23 musicians
[30:45] thank you
[30:59] maybe I don't have them I I do my
[31:04] brother Isaac preach the other week he
[31:07] took the scripture and I thought man is
[31:09] he can I preach what I'm preparing for
[31:11] but I know look at just a little bit
[31:13] different for verily I say unto you that
[31:19] if James O'Day shall say unto this
[31:21] mountain Amen let's read that again and
[31:25] you put your name there because I want
[31:27] you to believe it but verily I say unto
[31:30] you that James shall say unto this
[31:33] mountain be thou removed and cast into
[31:36] the sea now here's the punch line to
[31:39] this and shall not doubt in his heart
[31:43] because there's a connection between
[31:46] your faith in your heart but shall
[31:50] believe that those things which he saith
[31:52] shall come to pass he shall have
[31:54] whatsoever he saith do you believe that
[31:58] a mountain could be moved but this is a
[32:01] this is not a small thing this is you
[32:03] know something that weighs millions of
[32:06] tons just moved just for your faith I
[32:08] would call that something that would
[32:11] have to be a miracle yeah but I believe
[32:14] that it's possible so we need to turn to
[32:17] acts 1 verse 8 our heart has to be in a
[32:22] condition where it can operate that sort
[32:24] of faith
[32:35] x1a but you shall receive power you
[32:42] shall receive power and this power is
[32:46] the word is Dunamis it means virtue and
[32:49] strength but there's another thing under
[32:52] there and it says miracle-working power
[32:54] you'll receive you shall receive this
[32:57] power between after that the Holy Ghost
[33:00] has come upon you and you shall be
[33:02] witnesses unto me both in Jerusalem and
[33:06] all Judea and Samaria and unto the
[33:08] uttermost parts of the earth there's a
[33:10] purpose for this power it's not just
[33:12] I'll give you power there's a purpose a
[33:14] motive and an objective let's just pray
[33:17] Heavenly Father Lord with just open the
[33:20] service this evening Lord with some
[33:22] mighty statements that you have made
[33:24] Lord and maybe to the world Lord these
[33:26] things would just seem impossible Lord
[33:28] Jesus but yet to your bride Lord we just
[33:31] reach out and we grab these things Lord
[33:33] Jesus and we say that promise is mine
[33:34] and I'm going to take it and father I
[33:37] pray you'd raise the faith in this
[33:38] building tonight Lord that we could lay
[33:41] hold of any promise that we have Lord
[33:43] any healing we need for this body in
[33:45] this building Lord and anybody that
[33:47] would be listening Lord Jesus father may
[33:50] you grant it Lord and may your spirit be
[33:52] with us and bless our services evening I
[33:54] pray and ask for your strength Lord in
[33:56] Jesus Christ's name Amen you may be
[34:02] seated
[34:03] I think the last time I stood up Piero's
[34:06] a little bit nervous and I got home and
[34:09] I received this text message from him
[34:11] good friend of mine and I said bro you
[34:15] were more you were more nervous than a
[34:17] Salesman selling meat spices to a bunch
[34:20] of cannibals so I'd just pray that the
[34:24] Lord yeah just let the Lord work
[34:26] I want this power to come into my life
[34:32] that power is of the Holy Ghost and it
[34:35] has to have a resting place it has to
[34:39] rest in your heart and you cannot do
[34:41] anything in the power of God until you
[34:43] have the Holy Spirit I just want to read
[34:47] you a couple of quotes I'm going to read
[34:49] you know just lay a foundation for this
[34:52] God perfecting his church all
[34:54] Christianity has wrapped up and one big
[34:57] love affair don't you believe that see
[35:00] love is the most perfect thing in the
[35:03] Bible God is love and they that love are
[35:07] of God said johnsy luck most perfect
[35:10] thing in the Bible so if you're going to
[35:12] have anything that's perfect perfect
[35:13] faith perfect killing anything has got
[35:16] to start with perfect love it's the most
[35:17] perfect thing there is when you think of
[35:20] all that God's done and the most perfect
[35:22] thing in the word is love and perfect
[35:26] faith you see and faith and love is
[35:29] relation because you can't have faith
[35:31] unless you've got love because your
[35:34] faith is in a God that was the very
[35:36] essence of love faith and love works
[35:39] together if we're going to do anything
[35:42] in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ if
[35:44] we're going to achieve anything for his
[35:46] kingdom we have to have love it has to
[35:50] be rooted in your heart you can have
[35:51] love on a superficial level right figlio
[35:54] love love because someone did something
[35:56] good for you but that's not the kind of
[35:58] love we're talking about I'm talking
[36:00] about the love of God when someone stabs
[36:02] you in the back and you say Lord forgive
[36:05] them save them Lord speak to on but
[36:08] figlio love just has a different emotion
[36:11] that's attached with it what I really
[36:20] want to get to you is the difference
[36:21] between hope and faith because you can
[36:24] have hope but hope doesn't have a
[36:26] resting place when you hope for
[36:28] something you just well I really want
[36:31] this to happen but it doesn't have a
[36:32] foundation it's not grounded in anything
[36:36] you have to have faith as soon as we let
[36:43] fear come into your heart rather Isaac
[36:45] talked about this fear if we do you
[36:47] think fear wrists fear wrists in your
[36:51] heart fears not on the outside fears and
[36:54] the heart because you believe it you now
[36:56] put your faith you now believe in this
[36:58] thing that's coming up scared you're
[37:00] scared to do it
[37:01] it's that race here
[37:02] I was thinking about Peter walking on
[37:06] the water and the Lord just started
[37:08] speaking about this and I want to read
[37:10] through the story we're going to have a
[37:12] bit of a Bible study so if you go to
[37:13] Matthew 14 I just started reading this
[37:17] and I really started enjoying it so if
[37:20] you can all read it if not I'll read it
[37:24] out anyway so blessed by the hearing of
[37:27] the word anyway Matthew 14 23 and Jesus
[37:39] has just been talking to the people and
[37:41] when he had sent the multitudes away he
[37:43] went up into a mountain apart to pray
[37:46] and when the evening was come he was
[37:49] there alone now when I read the
[37:51] scripture and I read about a mountain
[37:53] and I read about their evening time
[37:56] something just begins to crack little
[37:58] ears up and I say Lord this maybe
[38:01] there's just something here that's a a
[38:02] little bit more walking what are you
[38:04] trying to show me but the ship now was
[38:09] in the midst of the sea tossed with
[38:11] waves but the wind was contrary and I
[38:14] began to think you know there was a
[38:17] bride in this ship yeah it was a bride
[38:19] in this ship and it was in the middle of
[38:22] the sea you know the world as a sea the
[38:24] sea is of people and there's a bride and
[38:27] a ship in the middle of the sea and
[38:29] she's been tossed cos at Satan's Eden
[38:31] and there's a battle raging and in the
[38:37] fourth watch of the night Jesus went
[38:39] unto them walking on the sea right at
[38:42] the last moment not the first box on the
[38:43] second wash and the third watch at the
[38:46] fourth watch and I believe that we are
[38:49] now in the fourth watch we right at the
[38:51] end time very few things have to happen
[38:53] we're right in the fourth watch right at
[38:55] the end and when the disciples saw him
[38:59] walking on the sea they were troubled
[39:01] this is amazing they were troubled
[39:04] saying it's a spirit and they cried out
[39:06] the fear fear and what's happened today
[39:11] there's been all these things happened
[39:13] that we've seen since 63 a cloud
[39:15] appeared
[39:16] we've seen the word coming open and all
[39:18] these sounds and what it people saw
[39:21] something coming upon the sea they saw
[39:24] Jesus coming down but they didn't know
[39:25] what it was so they cried out with fear
[39:27] oh is this how it says who is this and
[39:31] they cried out for fear because they
[39:33] didn't understand well they didn't have
[39:35] faith to believe that's why there's been
[39:42] so much fighting in the message you know
[39:43] that's why there's been so much division
[39:45] even right now I'm not talking about 30
[39:48] years ago because it still happens it's
[39:50] a spirit and an innocent of the church
[39:52] and that can still happen today and it's
[39:54] because of fear because somebody sees
[39:56] something and I don't agree with what
[39:57] they say and now fear what are they
[40:00] wrong
[40:00] what if we're wrong if he comes in but
[40:07] straightaway Jesus spake unto them
[40:09] saying be of good cheer it is I be not
[40:12] afraid and Peter answered him and said
[40:15] Lord
[40:16] now What did he say if Lord if ever it
[40:21] be there but me to come to the on the
[40:23] water so there was a question and as
[40:25] hard it was a question it's a little
[40:27] doubt effort be there and Jesus and he
[40:33] said come and when Peter came down out
[40:35] of the ship he walked on water to go on
[40:39] Jesus if Peter actually walked on the
[40:41] water when he heard Jesus say come
[40:44] there's so many people today hear Jesus
[40:47] say come come come this requires an
[40:55] action if he saying come then you need
[40:58] to step out of the boat like all this
[41:01] boats a safe place you know nobody looks
[41:03] at me funny and it's just comfy in this
[41:06] little spot but you've got to get out
[41:08] off the boat because you're about to
[41:10] operate your faith and walk on the water
[41:13] but it requires your action to the Lord
[41:17] speaking to you no shame don't turn him
[41:21] down yeah but when he saw the wind
[41:25] boisterous he was afraid and began to
[41:28] sink
[41:30] he cried out saying lord save me and
[41:32] immediately Jesus stretched forth his
[41:35] hand and caught him and said unto Him o
[41:36] thou of little faith
[41:38] where did us doubt doubt he doubted in
[41:41] here if if thou be the Son of God you
[41:46] need to know that this message is the
[41:48] truth that thus message as Jesus Christ
[41:52] and then when he took his eyes off Jesus
[41:57] Amen he stepped out of the boat if it's
[42:00] been our Lord yet kiss me come come oh
[42:02] but look at these wife and David coming
[42:05] out fishing with me the other day and we
[42:08] were bouncing through those waves are
[42:10] big waves and the next thing was big
[42:12] wave straight over the boats slap me in
[42:14] the face another one went down my back
[42:16] but I had to keep looking to where we
[42:19] were going because if I started to look
[42:21] around the next one you know knocked me
[42:23] out of the boat you have to keep your
[42:25] eyes on Jesus or you'll begin to sing
[42:28] when fear comes and replaces the love
[42:31] that should be in your heart yeah he had
[42:36] walked on water you know the same thing
[42:41] can happen to us in a trial and we pray
[42:43] for you know and you walk out you're
[42:45] stronger I'm claiming this as mine it's
[42:48] my victory I've got this and then things
[42:51] get a little bit worse and you know
[42:54] another pain comes up and you know all I
[42:56] remember that that pain is in this part
[42:58] of the body and now something starts
[43:01] turning in the mind and then you go well
[43:03] if I just google it you know like there
[43:06] might be an herbal remedy for it that
[43:09] replaces faith in the heart and we trade
[43:14] our faith for understanding brother
[43:17] Branham here in fellowship now we have
[43:19] great things that we can do in the realm
[43:22] of faith faith works great things for us
[43:25] and you can't have faith till you have
[43:29] love that's just all there is to it
[43:30] perfect love casts out all fear as long
[43:34] as you've got fear you you can't have
[43:36] faith so you've got to have love first
[43:39] it drives all fear out and then faith
[43:42] comes in
[43:43] takes the place of fear so when you have
[43:46] that you're coming right along
[43:48] amen I bet there's somebody in here
[43:53] that's walked on water who's walked on
[43:56] water
[43:57] amen amen
[43:59] who's been to ice skating ring who's
[44:02] been ice-skating that's water what let
[44:05] you skate on that water your your
[44:10] intellectual believing understood that
[44:12] if that water was hard that you would be
[44:14] able to skate on it so now through your
[44:17] five senses you've walked on water
[44:19] because you had faith and what you know
[44:21] that that water's hard now what have you
[44:24] apply that same faith to that raging sea
[44:27] what stops you I will it's a raging sea
[44:30] and as water and so now reasoning this
[44:33] the stupid nanus this carnal flesh that
[44:37] stops us but when the five senses fail
[44:40] us is another sense that God has given
[44:42] us and that sense of you operator will
[44:44] let you walk on the water because all of
[44:46] this is what you believe in your heart
[44:48] will I believe that water will not
[44:50] support my way but when you know when
[44:53] you have faith when you believe and it's
[44:55] rooted and grounded you can walk on that
[44:56] water nothing is going to stop you like
[45:01] brother Isaac was saying the human has a
[45:03] creative power but without God that
[45:08] power is limited you know this wisdom
[45:13] has started right back in the Garden of
[45:15] Eden why did why did Eve need anything
[45:18] more than what God had given her they
[45:20] already had what they need they could
[45:22] speak something into existence but Satan
[45:25] used reasoning and the mind to overcome
[45:27] what God had already told her in her
[45:29] heart I'll just read this in proverbs 23
[45:36] verse 7 it says for as he thinketh in
[45:39] his heart so is he
[45:41] well I think I've in my mind no you
[45:44] think in your heart that's why when you
[45:48] talk to somebody what's coming out of
[45:50] their mouth is actually a reflection of
[45:52] what's in their heart so if you're
[45:55] talking to
[45:57] a pastor and all he talks about us of
[45:59] word cuz he's feeding and there's a love
[46:01] in his heart and that's what comes forth
[46:04] but then you might meet somebody else
[46:05] and all they want to talk about is what
[46:07] what they did in the garden on on you
[46:10] know built a fence and and did this and
[46:13] did this and because something's
[46:14] producing from the heart and it's coming
[46:17] out yeah so what you've what's in your
[46:19] heart will reflect in your life and you
[46:23] know it makes people uncomfortable it
[46:24] makes people insecure when they don't
[46:28] have they know it cuz you know when
[46:30] you're not right with God and I can say
[46:32] I'm not right with God I want to be so
[46:34] much closer to God I believe there's
[46:36] still space that I can cram a bit more
[46:39] regard into this heart and when you come
[46:42] and you meet somebody that's just got a
[46:44] bit more than what you've got a good man
[46:46] man do I know God you know I want to
[46:48] have what they have
[46:49] there's a place and a human heart that
[46:52] is designed for God to dwell and if you
[46:55] resist that something else will take
[46:57] that place in your heart what it takes
[47:02] to overcome all bill all unbelief now
[47:06] many times I know all Christians know
[47:08] this that people will think well it just
[47:11] can't happen but yet in my heart there's
[47:13] something that tells me it's going to
[47:15] happen that you ever have that
[47:18] experience you Christians sure you have
[47:21] that's the inside man thinking it cast
[47:25] downs reasons it doesn't have anything
[47:26] to do with reasoning because with God
[47:29] God's Word should not be reason we can
[47:32] not reason out God God has never known
[47:34] by science never is God known by mental
[47:38] powers God is only known by faith
[47:40] knowledge we'll never get a man to God
[47:43] knowledge takes them away from God you
[47:48] cannot come into this rapture through
[47:51] understanding what the scriptures say
[47:53] about the rapture whenever we reason
[47:59] over a situation this situations come up
[48:02] what you floods have been going through
[48:05] I'm gonna say what it is but been going
[48:07] through a situation now what's in the
[48:09] heart
[48:10] will produce an outcome you're going to
[48:12] say I have faith for this and this is
[48:15] what's going to happen and then what's
[48:18] and the heart will produce the outcome
[48:21] and not not reasoning not well you know
[48:24] this is this and this is this that's not
[48:26] what I'm holding on to I'm holding on to
[48:29] a promise that God has given me
[48:31] I mean if their hearts so full with the
[48:35] divine love of God your faith will be
[48:38] unstoppable
[48:38] there'd be no power in hell that can
[48:40] stop it that will push itself out onto
[48:43] the battle front and stand and fight
[48:48] we've just got to make sure we keep in
[48:50] their atmosphere and keep that divine
[48:52] love there because when something else
[48:54] comes in and takes that place you'll be
[48:56] defeated I was thinking about it like
[48:58] Sampson what a sorry sight this mighty
[49:01] warrior you know he had it in his heart
[49:04] that he was going to fight for the Lord
[49:06] yeah he was going to defeat the
[49:08] Philistines it was the will of God it
[49:09] was their land and he was going to
[49:11] defeat them and he picked up that
[49:13] jawbone you know I would have rather
[49:16] packed up a stick than a jawbone but he
[49:19] picks up a jawbone and just starts
[49:20] smacking these Philistines with beer you
[49:23] know and just like brass helmets and
[49:26] smashing them and you would have thought
[49:28] man this guy has got to be the most
[49:30] powerful man in Israel but then
[49:33] something happened in his heart because
[49:35] he gave his heart to a girl that he was
[49:38] not supposed to be with and when he gave
[49:42] his heart away he still had the faith he
[49:46] tried to break the courts he tried to
[49:48] use his power but something had changed
[49:50] in the place of his heart and when he
[49:52] went to call upon that power the Holy
[49:55] Ghost was not there and he had no power
[49:57] to draw he had given place to something
[50:00] else
[50:08] desperations we must have loved before
[50:11] we can have faith and faith when we have
[50:14] genuine love what does it what does it
[50:17] do it pushes our faith out onto the
[50:19] battlefront for God's see genuine godly
[50:23] love for God and His Word and for his
[50:25] people will push faith out there love
[50:28] just takes hold of faith and justice
[50:30] come on let's go let's go and out it
[50:33] goes because that's what loved us
[50:35] what was it in the young King David that
[50:38] could fight that giant all the rest of
[50:42] Israel was running scared they were
[50:44] scared
[50:45] fear fear in their hearts I was thinking
[50:50] you know David wasn't looking at that
[50:52] giant going he's pretty big a and he's
[50:56] thinking well I wonder if I should weigh
[50:59] these stones you know cuz that heads
[51:01] pretty big and you know I wonder if the
[51:06] slings just getting a little bit worn
[51:08] out maybe I'll just go down to the
[51:10] armory and buy the latest pipe out
[51:15] night-vision heat-seeking sling you know
[51:18] he had faith and what he had he couldn't
[51:23] put his faith in some fancy long-range
[51:25] sling I've seen this in the nature I've
[51:29] seen guys hunt and they go out and spend
[51:32] $20,000 on gear and they look ridiculous
[51:36] and they go out there of a painted face
[51:39] all this gear and they come back with
[51:41] nothing and they're sad wouldn't get
[51:43] anything and I've seen it and you see
[51:46] this guy walk into the bush he's got a
[51:47] ripped up old spawn dry he's got a rusty
[51:50] old 303 on his back with no sights on it
[51:53] and he walks out there and you go who
[51:54] you think man that guy's not gonna do
[51:56] very good and he comes out with a deer
[51:57] on us back and let's go see now you
[52:01] apply this and the spiritual you've got
[52:05] to have your faith tested you've got to
[52:07] know that what you're using is going to
[52:10] work you have got to know when you apply
[52:12] the Word of God that it is going to work
[52:14] David's weapon wasn't the slingshot they
[52:18] were could have slung a tea bag of that
[52:20] valour and he what
[52:22] it wasn't the stone that killed Goliath
[52:25] our weapons are not carnal but they're
[52:28] mighty we fight not against flesh and
[52:31] blood he was fighting demons he was
[52:34] finding wicked powers and it was his
[52:36] faith that killed Goliath your faith
[52:41] needs to have a strong hold in your
[52:43] heart sinking why could David defeat
[52:48] that giant why am it was so many men in
[52:50] that land that were more able than he
[52:53] was to fight that giant but David was a
[52:56] man after God's own heart that's why he
[52:59] could defeat that giant because he had
[53:01] the love of God and as high and if he
[53:03] was going to do something for God he was
[53:05] going to stand up and have faith in it I
[53:06] bet he thought if he kills me I die
[53:09] what's the words what's the worst that
[53:10] can happen you know but he knew that he
[53:13] could fight that giant he knew he could
[53:15] take him down he had a revelation and
[53:17] faith is a revelation David wanted to be
[53:24] the dwelling place of God he wanted to
[53:26] be the dwelling place of God I read this
[53:31] to second Corinthians 6:16 and what
[53:37] agreement hath the temple of God with
[53:38] idols the ye are the Temple of the
[53:42] Living God ye are the Temple of the
[53:44] Living God as God hath said I will dwell
[53:47] in them and walk in them
[53:49] and I will be their God and they shall
[53:51] be my people if we aren't getting the
[53:55] victories that we should be getting in
[53:56] our life we need to say where is the
[53:59] Lord in my life Lord this is your
[54:02] dwelling place come and and take control
[54:08] David knew it wasn't his own strength
[54:10] that would defeat Goliath but it was God
[54:13] walking her and him and that revelation
[54:17] was in his heart no power of Hell could
[54:19] take it from Ephesians 3 verse 16 I want
[54:23] you to read this I like the scripture or
[54:28] if you could bring it up maybe that
[54:30] would be easier visions 3:16
[54:42] that he would grant you according to the
[54:45] riches of his glory I like that the
[54:48] riches of his glory the Lord has a
[54:50] treasure treasure chest the riches of
[54:52] his glory so many things come out of
[54:55] this treasure chest but this promise to
[54:59] be strengthened with his might with it
[55:02] with might by his spirit and the inner
[55:05] man so your strength comes from the
[55:08] inner man not this man not the mind not
[55:11] your thinking that's not strength that's
[55:13] false it's fake that will deceive you
[55:15] strength comes from the inner man all
[55:20] humans are led by their heart
[55:22] unbelievers are led by their heart if
[55:24] they have a sexual spirit they lead into
[55:26] that type of thing of you doesn't matter
[55:29] what you are if you have Christ in your
[55:31] heart now he leads you and guides you as
[55:34] you walk by the inner man amen
[55:40] you know your church affiliation will
[55:42] not save you
[55:44] you say well I got a kind of tabernacle
[55:47] one thorn pretty good doesn't mean
[55:49] nothing doesn't mean nothing well I go
[55:53] to such and such big names which in
[55:54] America doesn't mean nothing you belong
[56:00] to Jesus Christ when you you know how
[56:03] are you saved when Christ comes to you
[56:07] and says Nadine come you're my child and
[56:12] you go a man that's nothing but the
[56:14] truth I believe it and you'd line up
[56:17] with Christ because now you enter into a
[56:19] relationship and when he has come see
[56:22] it's not just when he's come but when he
[56:24] comes to you when he comes to you it
[56:27] says a spirit of truth will lead you and
[56:29] guide you into all truth I don't want to
[56:36] trust in my flesh this flesh is so
[56:38] deceiving you have to let him come into
[56:43] this soul room
[56:46] and you have to let them come into every
[56:48] little door on every little room you are
[56:52] a three-room house your brother
[56:54] branham's is at your a three-room house
[56:56] body soul and spirit three rooms and he
[57:00] says it's the kitchen the living room
[57:03] and the bedroom but some people who only
[57:05] want to let Christ come into the kitchen
[57:07] yeah and and what are they give
[57:09] mechanics okay in the kitchen you you
[57:12] know cooking you learn to prepare Nadine
[57:13] we got married she learns how to cook
[57:15] for me and it's a mechanic's now
[57:17] operating but Christ wants more than
[57:20] that he just doesn't want to provide for
[57:21] your needs
[57:22] Oh Lord I need this oh here you go
[57:24] Charlie here you go my wife is that
[57:27] there's more to your Christian walk than
[57:30] there then you have to let them come in
[57:32] a little bit deeper and you and you
[57:33] invite them into the living room because
[57:35] now you're married and you want to get
[57:37] to know each other better so you start
[57:39] having fellowship in the living room and
[57:42] you get to know one another but still
[57:44] there's something that just you need to
[57:46] come a bit more because there's a little
[57:48] spot that's reserved in the heart and
[57:50] then you let them come right into the
[57:52] bedroom and that's now where the you the
[57:56] two come together and they unite because
[57:58] it has to be a uniting between you and
[58:00] you and your bridegroom and when that
[58:03] takes place in the dynamics come so when
[58:06] you've got the mechanics and you've got
[58:08] all these things lined up together and
[58:10] then you meet Christ personally he's
[58:12] come to you now he comes right in and he
[58:16] rests and here in this little place in
[58:18] your heart the divine love of God and
[58:21] now that just comes through and it
[58:24] produces and a faith but until that
[58:26] takes place you can't have genuine faith
[58:29] for genuine divine healing there is
[58:33] every one of you can reach out and take
[58:36] any promise of God and operate it and I
[58:39] hope we can get there your heart is the
[58:42] soul room and you know that's surrounded
[58:45] by the twenty-four elders your ropes
[58:47] 24 reps this is the sole room and the
[58:50] resting place of God makes me think of
[58:55] Revelation chapter five you know
[58:57] is there something taking place in here
[59:00] inside of you is a mighty warrior and
[59:03] when I read Revelation chapter flight I
[59:05] are I place that as myself now I think
[59:09] that's me that's what I'm doing right
[59:11] now and I love it because it's the third
[59:18] pole coming up right now and that's what
[59:20] all this is about is what about all this
[59:22] message is about it's about you coming
[59:24] into that place where you line up with
[59:26] your theophany you line up with what's
[59:28] taking place from before the foundation
[59:30] of the world
[59:31] you recognize you know what I've already
[59:34] won I've already won this fight I've
[59:36] already been healed I already have a
[59:39] healed body that I'm going back to a men
[59:45] you've let him come right into the
[59:47] holiest place of your heart and he's
[59:50] leading you so I you know it just makes
[59:54] me think of when the Lord said to job
[59:56] when job is said where where you joke
[1:00:00] where we when all the sons of God
[1:00:02] shouted for joy not when some of the
[1:00:05] good sons you know not when they're
[1:00:07] really on fire sons of God shouted for
[1:00:09] joy when all the sons of God shouted for
[1:00:12] joy well you know I'm just just not that
[1:00:17] kind of believe you know like I'm just
[1:00:19] the quiet father you know I just it's
[1:00:22] not me but all the sons of God shouted
[1:00:24] for joy that's your theophany you know
[1:00:28] brother Branham said these three kinds
[1:00:30] of believers in the church every Church
[1:00:37] start hiding but the believer that I see
[1:00:44] here in this job is shouting for joy
[1:00:47] that's the real believer you know so if
[1:00:51] you're not that kind of believer there's
[1:00:52] only two other believers it's the Nate
[1:00:54] believer and unbeliever right but I'd
[1:00:58] want to say brother Branham said these
[1:01:00] three types of believer in every person
[1:01:02] because you might have a seed of God
[1:01:04] that's lying there yeah and there's
[1:01:06] something pulling pulling it out of you
[1:01:08] and you're resisting it
[1:01:10] Lord but he's pulling it out of you and
[1:01:13] you have that experience oh man you know
[1:01:18] that unbelievers the guy that won't get
[1:01:20] out of bed in time on a Sunday morning
[1:01:22] he said he's in you you know that that's
[1:01:25] real man that's so tired this morning
[1:01:29] then you fight the blankets and this is
[1:01:33] bad all the white dog and then black dog
[1:01:35] was fight going on but the one you feed
[1:01:38] the most will win
[1:01:39] that's the unbeliever and the make
[1:01:42] believer he's the guy that comes to
[1:01:43] comes to church you know he's dress real
[1:01:46] smart new suit looks pretty good dress
[1:01:49] for the occasion but for some reason he
[1:01:51] can't seem to connect with that guy
[1:01:53] there that's shouting for joy you can't
[1:01:55] connect with us the often it is just a
[1:01:58] tear maybe that sprung up there's a
[1:02:00] something that's greater for the love of
[1:02:02] God and his heart than the word but yet
[1:02:07] the seeds in there it's predestinated
[1:02:09] what's stopping you you know all that
[1:02:13] you're missing out on is victory yeah
[1:02:17] well you know you have it it's there but
[1:02:21] through fear well if I stand up and
[1:02:24] shout and clap they're gonna think I'm
[1:02:27] nuts the world may think you're nuts I
[1:02:30] won't think you're nuts all go praise
[1:02:33] God hallelujah and shout with you
[1:02:35] amen that's right
[1:02:41] hallelujah you cannot come into this
[1:02:44] message through into intellectual
[1:02:47] understanding of the foundation of the
[1:02:49] church
[1:02:49] our fathers tried ER and they fought
[1:02:52] tooth and nail and it didn't produce a
[1:02:55] rapture in faith bride there still it
[1:02:58] just didn't because only love will
[1:03:01] produce this you come in by faith and
[1:03:06] faith as a revelation of God's Word and
[1:03:09] then and it's quickened to you when you
[1:03:11] hear it and that's seed and it just says
[1:03:13] Amen I want it and it burst forth and it
[1:03:16] comes out and this is what I believe is
[1:03:21] the new birth you know as so it tomb so
[1:03:24] mostly used and within Christianity a
[1:03:26] new birth what sort of question here
[1:03:28] well I'm a born-again Christian well
[1:03:32] what were you born again for him because
[1:03:34] to me your new birth as when you say
[1:03:38] that person and Joe that shouted for joy
[1:03:41] that that was your theophany and you go
[1:03:44] that's me
[1:03:45] that's me and Christ is yes you're mine
[1:03:48] and you say hallelujah I see it I've got
[1:03:51] it
[1:03:51] then you've new birth and it's a mess
[1:03:53] brother branham see what cuz you cry and
[1:03:55] you shout and you sing hallelujah
[1:03:57] because if now something has been
[1:03:59] birthed in you and that's why people
[1:04:01] fear because a booth is always messy and
[1:04:04] I don't want the mess I don't want to
[1:04:06] miss this ashamed well that's just a
[1:04:07] shameful thing I don't want to look like
[1:04:10] that and you hold back and the only
[1:04:13] thing you really hold back is the
[1:04:14] victory you have to receive the promise
[1:04:17] of God faith has to have an action when
[1:04:24] the word has revealed to you ministers
[1:04:26] will know this when the virtus revealed
[1:04:28] to you you were responsible to give an
[1:04:30] action to what is revealed to you so if
[1:04:32] something is revealed to you and then
[1:04:34] you do nothing with it why would God God
[1:04:37] why would he give you more or you didn't
[1:04:39] do anything with what I gave you
[1:04:41] you're responsible to do something
[1:04:43] whether it's the same thing for you for
[1:04:46] any of you if God reveals something to
[1:04:49] you he reveals you know what I want you
[1:04:52] to go and I want you to go and bless
[1:04:53] this brother and do such and such a
[1:04:55] thing and then you don't do it well what
[1:04:58] if he can't trust you to do something
[1:05:00] with what he's given you he's not going
[1:05:02] to give you more
[1:05:05] I was thinking of that you remember the
[1:05:10] story and brother Brandon was preaching
[1:05:13] at a minister's church and his daughter
[1:05:15] was grieved at what he was preaching he
[1:05:17] was talking about their clothes and hair
[1:05:20] and makeup and this woman was grieved in
[1:05:23] her heart as he was preaching and she
[1:05:26] come up to brother Brennan after the
[1:05:28] service and she said how dare you preach
[1:05:30] that and my father's Church and she was
[1:05:35] grieved but God was calling upon her
[1:05:38] heart
[1:05:38] yeah he was trying to work he was trying
[1:05:41] to she was saying this is right this is
[1:05:44] truth I know that this is the truth but
[1:05:47] I hate it and I'm resisting it and he
[1:05:50] said she grieved the Holy Spirit for the
[1:05:52] last time because there comes a time
[1:05:54] when you can turn the Holy Spirit down
[1:05:56] for the last time that's a powerful
[1:06:00] thing and I remember he said he met that
[1:06:03] girl later on down maybe a few years
[1:06:05] later and he wanted to cross the road
[1:06:07] cuz he's seen her coming and she was a
[1:06:09] mess and he stopped then he talked to
[1:06:11] her and she had become so hardened in
[1:06:14] her heart that she said I don't have
[1:06:18] anything to do with it
[1:06:19] I could watch my parents soul burn and
[1:06:21] Helen it wouldn't touch me yeah what is
[1:06:23] what a condition the devil was so so
[1:06:27] evil yeah he promises you everything and
[1:06:30] robs you of you he has got nothing he
[1:06:34] can give to you nothing at all she
[1:06:39] turned down the Spirit of God for the
[1:06:41] last time if God is moving you I just
[1:06:43] pray that you would give an appropriate
[1:06:46] reaction to what God is calling in your
[1:06:48] heart don't turn them down
[1:06:57] I'll skip a little bit because I don't
[1:06:59] want to keep you here all night how I
[1:07:02] love this word so much I love this study
[1:07:05] the rapture but to the church the bride
[1:07:09] the rapture is a revelation - it is
[1:07:13] revealed to her that the revelation the
[1:07:16] true Bride of Christ will be waiting for
[1:07:19] that revelation of the rapture I'm not
[1:07:22] waiting for a revelation you might be
[1:07:24] waiting for the revelation but I'm not
[1:07:26] waiting for the revelation of the
[1:07:28] rapture because it's taking place in me
[1:07:30] right now where I am being called up and
[1:07:33] I hear God I feel and pulling me up and
[1:07:36] it's changing me it's changing the way I
[1:07:39] act it's changing the way I think as
[1:07:41] changing the decisions that I make every
[1:07:44] day in my life because I have a
[1:07:46] revelation of this rapture now as a
[1:07:50] revelation for the revelation as faith
[1:07:53] you cannot have a revelation without it
[1:07:55] being faith faith as a revelation
[1:07:58] because it's something that's been
[1:07:59] revealed to you faith is a revelation
[1:08:02] faith is something that has been
[1:08:05] revealed to you like it was to Abraham
[1:08:07] that could call anything contrary to
[1:08:09] what had been revealed to them as though
[1:08:12] it wasn't so so if God says to you that
[1:08:15] you're healed and then the devil comes
[1:08:17] in incisional not healed you say devil I
[1:08:19] don't believe you flee from me God said
[1:08:21] I'm here that's faith that's a
[1:08:23] revelation of his word that can call
[1:08:27] anything else country nothing false
[1:08:30] wrong don't believe you see them go home
[1:08:33] I've got no time for you and then the
[1:08:40] whole church is built upon revelation
[1:08:42] the whole entire body amen when God
[1:08:47] gives you a promise it's a revelation
[1:08:49] you just need to reach out and claim it
[1:08:51] that's yours you know if you don't
[1:08:56] you're holding on to the promise the
[1:08:59] promise has been made you're holding on
[1:09:00] to it but you're not claiming it you're
[1:09:02] not acting on it
[1:09:03] I don't believe what happened to that
[1:09:07] promise I had you done act on it and it
[1:09:08] left you
[1:09:10] a requires action yeah it requires a
[1:09:17] resting place in your heart that will
[1:09:19] hold that promise there Ephesians 3:17
[1:09:23] that Christ may dwell in your hearts by
[1:09:26] faith that ye being rooted and grounded
[1:09:28] and love may be able to comprehend with
[1:09:31] All Saints what is the breadth and
[1:09:33] length and depth and height and to know
[1:09:35] the love of Christ which passeth all
[1:09:37] knowledge and be filled with the
[1:09:39] fullness of God we should be able to
[1:09:42] come to with you together and agree
[1:09:44] because of something that is rooted and
[1:09:47] grounded in our heart you know
[1:09:50] when the Holy Ghost fell the disciples
[1:09:55] were in one Accord they were they were
[1:09:57] they were together believing that the
[1:09:59] promise was coming they went and they're
[1:10:02] going well such and such the derson that
[1:10:05] one's going will such and such with us
[1:10:06] and I'll take my show off and hurt that
[1:10:08] one you know like they were in one
[1:10:10] Accord and the power of God shook that
[1:10:13] building the Holy Ghost filled it we say
[1:10:16] well Lord where are you I said well I'm
[1:10:20] trying to come in I'm knocking at your
[1:10:21] heart what are you doing about it you
[1:10:24] want to see me you want to be healed but
[1:10:26] you won't even let me come into your
[1:10:27] heart oh lord have mercy your faith must
[1:10:33] be rooted deeper than your heart so it
[1:10:36] cannot come out because you can have
[1:10:38] faith in the wrong things I've had faith
[1:10:40] in the wrong things and I've seen power
[1:10:43] work when I was young before I was a
[1:10:45] Christian I had dabbled in spiritualism
[1:10:48] things and I had seen miraculous things
[1:10:51] before I even believed in a god I had
[1:10:53] seen spirits do supernatural things what
[1:10:57] through my faith and then but that faith
[1:11:00] was limited was limited because the
[1:11:03] devil has no power
[1:11:04] he only perverts what God has but he
[1:11:06] doesn't have any of his own power
[1:11:12] Ephesians 3:20 now unto him that is able
[1:11:16] to do exceedingly abundantly above all
[1:11:20] that we ask or think according to the
[1:11:23] power
[1:11:24] that worker than us amen according to
[1:11:28] the power that worketh and us even the
[1:11:31] fact that it says above all that we ask
[1:11:33] or think because we can't even think
[1:11:35] with this you cannot use this it comes
[1:11:38] from the heart
[1:11:39] God can produce what you can not even
[1:11:41] imagine when it seems impossible I can't
[1:11:44] buy a house I don't have the money
[1:11:46] God can he can provide hell I don't know
[1:11:50] I can't this thing here cannot produce
[1:11:53] the thought to do it but God can through
[1:11:56] my faith that worketh than me even more
[1:12:00] than what I think the Satan does not
[1:12:05] have that kind of power that's a limited
[1:12:08] and without without the love of God
[1:12:11] anything that you have any power that
[1:12:14] you have will be just won't operate
[1:12:16] because you're asking this well Lord I
[1:12:18] want this you ask him as he says well I
[1:12:20] don't want you to have that so you're
[1:12:22] not going to have it because you're
[1:12:23] asking this because power without
[1:12:27] character satanic how then God likes to
[1:12:31] mold character because he's trying to
[1:12:34] you know you cannot get to heaven on a
[1:12:35] flowery bitties well if I just be a
[1:12:38] Christian this will all just be easy
[1:12:40] that's not going to happen that's going
[1:12:43] to be hard it's a hard road but he's
[1:12:48] calling you closer to him you know they
[1:12:54] came to a point in Billy Paul's life
[1:12:56] where he'd come at a crossroads and
[1:12:59] brother branham said look Billy Paul
[1:13:00] right now you're standing at a
[1:13:02] crossroads and there's two paths that
[1:13:05] you can take you can take the path
[1:13:09] that's right and what we have will not
[1:13:12] much just joy and salvation and what
[1:13:15] you'll follow me around and you'll watch
[1:13:17] the power of God heal people and the
[1:13:21] Holy Ghost fall or or you can take this
[1:13:26] other road and what will you see a
[1:13:29] failed marriage drunk diseases right to
[1:13:36] the point where God brought him to his
[1:13:38] deathbed yeah and he was dying and the
[1:13:40] doctor said I cannot save him I can't
[1:13:42] he's gone I can't do anything and he
[1:13:44] said dad saved me and brother Brennan
[1:13:47] said until you make things right with
[1:13:50] God there's no use of me even praying
[1:13:52] because God's not going to hear you need
[1:13:55] to get yourself right with God and I
[1:13:56] will pray he chose the wrong road but
[1:13:59] every road there was available to take
[1:14:01] that Satan just likes to pull you away
[1:14:04] it's just he's good at it he's practiced
[1:14:06] he's been doing it for a while
[1:14:14] perfect faith and when you've got pure
[1:14:17] unadulterated faith like your lovers to
[1:14:20] get your companion then you prove it by
[1:14:22] the way you act you aren't complaining
[1:14:24] no more you know it's done just walk
[1:14:27] along no matter what the thing looked
[1:14:29] like what anybody else say is you know
[1:14:31] what's happened you know that it's
[1:14:33] finished just as well as you know that
[1:14:34] you love your husband as well as you
[1:14:36] know you love see love and faith goes
[1:14:39] together that can folks love produces
[1:14:42] faith when Satan tempts us we are too
[1:14:47] resistant and a perfect faith and a
[1:14:50] perfect word like Jesus did the Word of
[1:14:53] God is perfect we're to have a perfect
[1:14:56] faith and this perfect word and resist
[1:14:59] Satan I mean what is what could be more
[1:15:02] perfect have you been going through your
[1:15:06] fair share of trials and hard times
[1:15:08] don't complain just think of the power
[1:15:10] that God is wanting to manifest through
[1:15:12] your life through the character he's
[1:15:14] developing and someone is going to have
[1:15:17] to do the greater works you know when
[1:15:20] Jesus walked upon this earth and his
[1:15:22] flesh what did he do talk of fish and he
[1:15:26] created more fish he took the bread and
[1:15:29] he break more bread but we've seen
[1:15:33] something greater in this day because
[1:15:35] we've had a prophet come upon the land
[1:15:37] and he's created and spoken squirrel's
[1:15:41] into existence where there was no
[1:15:42] squirrels and he brother branham turns
[1:15:45] around near the end of his ministry and
[1:15:47] says we're going to do the greater works
[1:15:49] because
[1:15:49] where there was nothing we Skinner speak
[1:15:51] it into existence somebody is going to
[1:15:54] speak something into existence when
[1:15:57] those squeeze come on and we can't buy
[1:15:59] anything we have no petrol we have no
[1:16:02] food we're going to have a little prayer
[1:16:04] meeting in here I don't think it'll be a
[1:16:06] lot it was gonna be is these will
[1:16:08] be that believers shouting for joy and
[1:16:10] somebody is going to speak something
[1:16:13] into existence just going to appear
[1:16:16] hallelujah we have to stop thinking
[1:16:20] human thoughts and start letting God
[1:16:22] think through our heart and produce
[1:16:26] perfect faith and now we become anointed
[1:16:30] with that same spirit anointed messiahs
[1:16:33] messiahs of the last day to shine forth
[1:16:37] the resurrection of Jesus Christ to show
[1:16:39] that he is not dead but in the form of
[1:16:42] the Holy Ghost he's in his people moving
[1:16:45] among his bride with a lover fear to
[1:16:48] hear pouring out unto her himself
[1:16:50] they are becoming one hallelujah they
[1:16:54] are becoming one for the wedding supper
[1:16:56] and the same signs promised by the same
[1:16:59] God and the same word as making the same
[1:17:02] manifestations Amen the same things he
[1:17:06] did I'm doing you want to see what God
[1:17:09] did just follow me for a little bit
[1:17:11] because what he did I'm gonna do sooner
[1:17:14] or later that's just going to happen
[1:17:15] it's just going to operate it's just the
[1:17:17] way it is it's going to be somebody that
[1:17:21] needs a new leak and they're going to
[1:17:23] come through this prayer line and
[1:17:24] they're going to come down here on one
[1:17:26] leg and they're going to walk out with
[1:17:27] two legs it's just going to happen
[1:17:30] I believe it amen
[1:17:41] that's gonna skip some more things don't
[1:17:45] keep you too hard
[1:17:47] now this thought came for me last night
[1:17:51] and I just really wanted to go through
[1:17:54] brought what brother branham said about
[1:17:56] it when you can apply this when you can
[1:18:00] really dig down and find the divine love
[1:18:03] in your heart and let it produce faith
[1:18:06] when you can have this all lined up
[1:18:08] that's going to produce something
[1:18:10] amazing and so brother Brennan here he's
[1:18:14] now been telling the story about when he
[1:18:16] spoke these squirrels into existence
[1:18:18] sitting in a little farm cottage out in
[1:18:21] the middle of nowhere and group of
[1:18:22] people around him listening to him and
[1:18:25] something's gonna take place a story of
[1:18:28] sister Hattie my new ministry and why we
[1:18:32] were talking I said I want to ask you
[1:18:34] something what put those squirrels there
[1:18:38] I believe those squirrels with you I
[1:18:41] don't believe this as a story something
[1:18:43] put those squirrels there it was a
[1:18:46] condition that the Prophet had that
[1:18:49] curry could create these squirrels
[1:18:51] because I've been hunting before and my
[1:18:53] faith was in an amazing place but there
[1:18:55] was something missing and I got to that
[1:18:57] clearing and I said Lord there's going
[1:18:58] to be a 12 points tag on that clearing
[1:19:00] and I so believed it and I got there and
[1:19:03] there was no development statement
[1:19:04] something was not quite ready for that
[1:19:07] to produce but it has been done because
[1:19:10] there's already been a first fruits of
[1:19:12] this resurrection and it will be done
[1:19:14] again there is no squirrels in the woods
[1:19:19] I had hunted and hunted and I'm not the
[1:19:22] best hunter yeah but I've hunted since I
[1:19:25] was a little boy and I had hunted close
[1:19:27] and they were in and they were in the
[1:19:30] most ridiculous place and in the most
[1:19:33] ridiculous way I could call them I see
[1:19:36] what put them there so now the Lord has
[1:19:38] told him say we do you want to scroll he
[1:19:40] said well and that's silly place over
[1:19:42] there where you'd never see a scroll
[1:19:43] this is supernatural I said that same
[1:19:47] God hallelujah that Jehovah Jireh he's
[1:19:50] just as much Jehovah Jireh as he was on
[1:19:53] the Mount with
[1:19:54] Abraham he can still produce an animal
[1:19:57] to his glory these squirrels was not a
[1:20:00] vision I shot them blood came out of
[1:20:02] them I dress them and eat them they
[1:20:04] wasn't visions they were squirrels I
[1:20:07] said that same Jehovah Jireh trying to
[1:20:10] get his promise over to me and my
[1:20:12] thickness and dullness of mind oh boy
[1:20:15] how many times has it happened to us
[1:20:18] he's trying to get something to you when
[1:20:20] you're so clouded because of the things
[1:20:22] that enter this mind he could speak my
[1:20:27] need into existence the same as he could
[1:20:31] speak
[1:20:31] Abraham's need into existence I know
[1:20:34] Moore said there until sister had he's
[1:20:36] sitting there crying now hadn't said a
[1:20:37] word and she said that's nothing but the
[1:20:41] truth
[1:20:41] she had the appropriate reaction to what
[1:20:45] was being spoken and she said Amen I
[1:20:48] believe that nobody's done that but I
[1:20:51] believe it I believe it she said the
[1:20:56] right thing and that's super anointing
[1:21:00] swept over me I said tell Hattie that
[1:21:02] she's found grace in the sight of God
[1:21:04] who would have thought said tell her to
[1:21:07] ask whatever she will then you speak it
[1:21:10] by this gift you speak it by this gift
[1:21:13] you speak why this gift into existence
[1:21:17] whatsoever she asked it speak it into
[1:21:20] existence
[1:21:21] I look to sister Hattie the first time
[1:21:24] that was ever performed on a human being
[1:21:26] and see it's just a heady ask what you
[1:21:29] well God is going to give it to you God
[1:21:33] is going to give it said ask what you
[1:21:37] will heady said to me brother Brennan
[1:21:39] what do you mean asked for you will
[1:21:41] anything ask what you will I said
[1:21:44] anything your heart desires the Lord
[1:21:48] show when you think your heart desires
[1:21:52] it shall be produced right here that
[1:21:55] you'll know that the Lord God of heaven
[1:21:57] answers and our scriptures are true
[1:22:01] anything your heart desires not what
[1:22:05] your flesh desires asked what your heart
[1:22:08] desires God knew what this woman was
[1:22:11] going to ask for
[1:22:13] she had a pure heart this was a
[1:22:17] Christian woman this was not a make
[1:22:19] believer was not an unbeliever God knew
[1:22:22] that she had a pure heart you know why
[1:22:26] do you need to move this mountain what's
[1:22:29] your motive and objective to make that
[1:22:31] mountain move if you have the wrong way
[1:22:34] to go I just want to move the mountain
[1:22:36] over there well doesn't matter to
[1:22:38] thousand people on the other side of the
[1:22:39] mountain die what's your motive for
[1:22:41] moving the mountain if your motive is
[1:22:44] not pure God will not move my first time
[1:22:50] with the new gift my first anointing I
[1:22:54] could hardly hear her and she looked
[1:22:56] around we had been talking about her
[1:22:59] little crippled sister I said oh no
[1:23:01] doubt in my heart within a few minutes
[1:23:03] little Edith will be jumping for the
[1:23:05] glory of God little crippled girl
[1:23:07] sitting there you know that would be a
[1:23:09] good cause for the power of God right
[1:23:11] yeah amen but that wasn't what was in
[1:23:15] her heart she had something far greater
[1:23:17] had he looked around all around she said
[1:23:20] brother bill my greatest desire is for
[1:23:23] the salvation of my two boys what why
[1:23:27] they couldn't have been a greater thing
[1:23:29] she could have asked for $10,000 she
[1:23:34] would have got it what I've had it have
[1:23:38] been some millionaire he would have
[1:23:39] asked for another million
[1:23:41] she had a pure heart he says God knowed
[1:23:45] what she was gonna ask for I said ask
[1:23:48] anything you want because God has give
[1:23:50] it to me to give to you whatever you
[1:23:52] want
[1:23:53] she said her boys was beginning to go
[1:23:55] off on the teenage tantrum and she said
[1:23:57] the salvation of my two boys another
[1:24:00] place I remember brother Brennan said
[1:24:02] those boys were sitting in the corner
[1:24:03] laughing and mocking what was brother
[1:24:05] Brennan was talking about disrespectful
[1:24:07] to God's prophet yeah and I said by the
[1:24:13] will of God by the power of God I give
[1:24:16] you in the name of Jesus Christ your
[1:24:18] desire and no two boys shook under the
[1:24:21] power of
[1:24:21] and that whole building trembled banks
[1:24:25] fell into his plate shall be grabbed and
[1:24:27] had he screamed till you could hear from
[1:24:29] two blocks and them two boys with tears
[1:24:32] running down their cheeks received
[1:24:34] exactly what they asked for
[1:24:35] right then oh the first time it was ever
[1:24:38] used on a human being
[1:24:40] ask what you will and it shall be given
[1:24:42] unto you who boys sitting a beer in the
[1:24:45] service that morning amen
[1:24:47] a pure heart a pure desire a pure love a
[1:24:51] pure faith producing the uttermost
[1:24:55] result and that's what we have you know
[1:24:58] I see divine love for divine faith for
[1:25:01] divine healing but I want to say for
[1:25:03] divine rapture as well because for you
[1:25:05] to have a rapture for you to have a body
[1:25:07] change you're not just going to walk
[1:25:09] into this you have to have something
[1:25:11] that's taken place in your heart because
[1:25:13] when you get on that other side you're
[1:25:15] still going to be the same person when I
[1:25:17] get there I'm still going to be James
[1:25:18] O'Day and if I don't love my brother or
[1:25:21] sister right now I won't love them over
[1:25:22] there it has to be something that's
[1:25:25] taken place in you now before you get
[1:25:27] there because death does not change you
[1:25:29] it only changes your dwelling place Lord
[1:25:32] created me a clean heart give me a pure
[1:25:35] heart give me the love of God I want to
[1:25:39] see that I want to see this take place
[1:25:40] in our church I want to see the sick
[1:25:43] healed I want to see faith operated in
[1:25:47] simplicity because it's not something
[1:25:48] that you can't obtain
[1:25:50] God does not give you a promise that you
[1:25:52] cannot obtain he's faithful to meet
[1:25:55] everything that he has promised you and
[1:25:57] you just claim it and say Lord it's mine
[1:26:00] devil back off devil you flee you have
[1:26:03] nothing you cannot hold us there's
[1:26:07] people that will claim this and we'll
[1:26:09] take this victory and run with it
[1:26:15] amen if you can come to crisis evening
[1:26:17] with a pure love in your heart for this
[1:26:19] word and believe casting down all
[1:26:22] imagination all reasoning and have faith
[1:26:25] to believe for the things that are
[1:26:27] impossible to man if you have a pure
[1:26:30] mode of an objection if your request
[1:26:32] matches the will of God
[1:26:35] ask what you will and it will be given
[1:26:37] to you anything
[1:26:38] Matthew 7:7 he said ask and it shall be
[1:26:42] given unto you seek and you shall find
[1:26:44] knock and it shall be opened unto you
[1:26:46] for every one that asketh receiveth and
[1:26:49] he that seeketh findeth and to him that
[1:26:51] knocketh it shall be opened I mean maybe
[1:26:55] the musicians could come maybe we could
[1:27:00] just play only believe softly please I
[1:27:03] just want to say what do you have need
[1:27:05] of tonight because we are a needy people
[1:27:09] and if you have need for this love that
[1:27:12] we've been talking about why don't you
[1:27:13] why don't you claim that tonight maybe
[1:27:15] you don't need to find healing but you
[1:27:17] need the love that will operate that
[1:27:19] power when you have need of it because
[1:27:22] what people do is they wait until they
[1:27:24] have a need and they say Lord I have a
[1:27:26] need but they're not ready to operate
[1:27:28] the gift I want to be ready now so when
[1:27:32] the need arises I can say Lord I need I
[1:27:34] need this and I believe my heart's in a
[1:27:37] place that it can operate and then I
[1:27:42] just need to speak it so simple faith so
[1:27:47] simple just speak it ask what you will
[1:27:49] it shall be given unto you if you ask
[1:27:52] from a pure heart if it's the will of
[1:27:53] God ask and it shall be given unto you
[1:27:57] Amen you know I'm not where I want to be
[1:28:02] right now
[1:28:03] right in my spirit I want to be higher I
[1:28:06] want to be yeah I want to start seeing
[1:28:09] this hand just becoming translucent and
[1:28:13] sort of us one with doesn't look so worn
[1:28:16] and calloused just appearing you know I
[1:28:18] want to be that high oh I want to see
[1:28:20] the image of my real self Amen I want to
[1:28:23] come that close to God and he will come
[1:28:28] to you if you ask him right now he will
[1:28:30] come to you if you haven't come to that
[1:28:31] place he will come to you
[1:28:34] but he will not force himself upon you
[1:28:37] he will not come upon your heart with a
[1:28:40] hammer and start hitting it I want to
[1:28:42] come in I want he will not force himself
[1:28:44] on you he's a genuine man he will come
[1:28:47] and he'll speak I love you you're my
[1:28:49] bride I love you I love you I'm amazed
[1:28:54] that he loves me but he's not forcing
[1:28:56] himself upon me he wants me to come out
[1:28:59] of my own well to him Amen hallelujah
[1:29:03] you must open that door to your heart
[1:29:06] don't miss us faith and simplicity you
[1:29:09] do not need a grief or a degree for us
[1:29:12] not science it's just a love affair
[1:29:14] between you and Christ amen maybe we
[1:29:19] could just stand I just want to close in
[1:29:21] prayer and I just want to read just want
[1:29:26] to read one more quote maybe if we just
[1:29:29] bow our heads and if you have a need you
[1:29:31] can raise your hand to the Lord and and
[1:29:34] we'll just pray this is coming into that
[1:29:38] third Paul I'm believing it now I want
[1:29:41] to ask you us and see a question you
[1:29:43] that pass through the prayer line can

[1:30:03] charge of faith and going right back to

[1:30:14] watch a perfect God with a perfect heart
[1:30:17] keep a perfect promise by His perfect
[1:30:20] word which is sharper than a two-edged
[1:30:22] sword and a discerner of the thoughts of
[1:30:24] the heart what we're coming now to the
[1:30:27] perfection because the people has to
[1:30:29] come to this in order for the rapture

[1:37:59] once raised of a stem is a nice house
[1:38:07] changeup
[1:38:10] [Music]
[1:38:28] [Music]
[1:38:41] I heard God say to us tonight get out of
[1:38:44] the boat
[1:38:44] yes don't just stay there and say yes
[1:38:50] but get out of the boat and when he was
[1:38:53] talking about sister Hetty right I put
[1:38:57] myself in the story we were I've been
[1:39:01] listening to brother ed bicycles
[1:39:03] testimony and he was up northern British
[1:39:05] Columbia and and brother Brown was there
[1:39:07] with them with Budd Southwick and his
[1:39:09] family and God just came down and they
[1:39:12] were so gripped by the atmosphere and he
[1:39:15] said brother Brahim said that the pillar
[1:39:16] of fire is not a few feet from any one
[1:39:18] of us and the reason he said that is
[1:39:20] that the people would reach out in faith
[1:39:22] because God was in the room hallelujah
[1:39:25] and I believe that our Lord Jesus the
[1:39:28] same God that visited them there is
[1:39:29] present now hallelujah so don't just
[1:39:33] don't just say yes but say yes Lord
[1:39:36] you're here for me are you here to meet
[1:39:38] my need a menace as brother brother was
[1:39:43] saying about how Hetty writes it there's
[1:39:44] nothing but the truth and that super
[1:39:46] anointing came down hallelujah I believe
[1:39:51] that he is here to meet a need we're not
[1:39:56] here just to go through a church service
[1:39:57] we're here that God would come and do
[1:40:00] the impossible and because we need him
[1:40:03] to do the impossible
[1:40:04] and because there's many things that we
[1:40:06] are facing we cannot change we cannot do
[1:40:08] anything we need him to come and him to
[1:40:11] come and meet the need and I believe
[1:40:13] that he is present to meet your need so
[1:40:17] if you would like to say if you want to
[1:40:19] step out of the boat irrespective of
[1:40:22] what the storm is doing and so I'm
