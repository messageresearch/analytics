[21:34] now as we open this sermon
[21:37] as we open this preaching in the word of
[21:39] god lord in the name of our lord jesus
[21:41] christ lord there's no point we're here
[21:44] lord
[21:45] and you're not here
[21:46] lord you know this week you know
[21:49] everything that was set before
[21:51] not just me but every believer that made
[21:53] it here lord
[21:55] lord and we came for one reason
[21:57] one reason alone lord is to hear from
[21:59] our god
[22:00] lord and to worship our god and to
[22:03] praise our god lord jesus so you come
[22:06] down and lord you take this service
[22:09] and you make it yours lord for that is
[22:11] why we come lord i pray you will be with
[22:14] us all now and for the rest of the
[22:16] service in the name of our lord jesus
[22:18] christ
[22:19] amen
[22:21] amen thank you brother andy
[22:23] god bless you
[22:25] musicians you can have your seats
[22:28] i put everything there for you
[22:32] amen
[22:33] i want to start off
[22:36] just by saying what
[22:39] a week
[22:42] i don't want to know how brother ben
[22:44] feels every sunday or every saturday
[22:46] that he needs to prepare
[22:48] before he gets here i've never in my
[22:50] life have been under so much physical
[22:54] and spiritual attack than this week
[22:58] i'm glad that i made it
[23:00] the devil today said you will not make
[23:02] it because you've got sinus it was so
[23:04] bad at a stage i wanted to collapse
[23:06] but i'm here
[23:09] you know the word of god will always go
[23:11] forth
[23:12] you know we sing how great is our god
[23:14] because it's actually about him it's not
[23:16] about us
[23:17] we don't come here for another reason
[23:19] but him so the devil will hinder you and
[23:22] will hinder you and will distract you as
[23:24] much as he can because he don't want you
[23:27] here
[23:28] but we're here
[23:31] we made it
[23:33] amen stupid devil
[23:37] you know what
[23:38] it's under your feet
[23:42] and hopefully tonight by god's grace
[23:45] we can go in these these two types or
[23:48] three types of believers but these two
[23:49] people that really seek god
[23:52] these people that seek him sincerely and
[23:55] then these people that seeks him with
[23:58] everything
[23:59] in them
[24:00] through sincerity these two types
[24:03] sincere people can miss the very
[24:05] presence of god in their life for being
[24:07] too sincere and too closed off so keep
[24:10] your minds open tonight as we go through
[24:12] the scriptures i've got a little bit of
[24:14] reading to do actually a lot of
[24:15] scripture but i'll try to go through the
[24:17] scriptures because i want to keep the
[24:19] thought
[24:20] but i'm going to have to paint the one
[24:22] side before i paint the other side which
[24:24] is us
[24:26] all of us
[24:27] because as much as we are here
[24:30] there is only one time where god comes
[24:33] on your road
[24:35] and he speaks to you personally and i
[24:36] don't want to go ahead but he speaks to
[24:38] you personally and that's experience and
[24:41] a moment between you and god that no man
[24:44] can take away no man can change it no
[24:47] man can can say it hasn't happened
[24:49] there's a point in your life where god
[24:51] calls you and he touches you in such a
[24:54] way
[24:55] that you cannot be the same
[24:57] amen
[24:59] so let's let's go into the scripture i
[25:00] want to go to the scripture of luke 20
[25:03] and we're not going to read there from
[25:05] verses 1 to
[25:07] um
[25:08] 8.
[25:12] lord help me please
[25:13] you just pray for me tonight
[25:16] um
[25:17] luke 20 um chapter 20 and we're going to
[25:20] start from verse 1.
[25:24] i don't know how the service is going to
[25:26] end i didn't work on that but
[25:29] amen praise the lord
[25:31] kind of lift that up to the lord
[25:34] amen
[25:36] that's how we do it so it's not on there
[25:38] but i'll show you luke tweeny and
[25:40] everybody there say amen
[25:42] so this so luke 19 jesus is on his way
[25:46] to israel
[25:47] and they get a mule he says go get the
[25:50] mule and they'll give him tell the
[25:51] master wants the mule because i have to
[25:53] go into jerusalem
[25:55] so he's on his way to jerusalem the most
[25:57] holiest city
[25:59] where
[26:00] god himself wants to go and show more of
[26:02] himself to his brethren now he's done
[26:05] many miracles before luke 20. there was
[26:08] blind sea death here dead raised
[26:10] everything has happened before this luke
[26:13] 20. so miracles it was in abundance
[26:16] it wasn't that they didn't know god was
[26:18] with this man there was miracles
[26:21] they could see the full manifestation of
[26:23] god on this earth if they just stood and
[26:25] looked at the ministry of jesus christ
[26:28] so but this is the this is the mindset
[26:31] and this is the whole thing
[26:33] about the pharisees and the sadducees is
[26:35] they've got a mindset and and there's
[26:37] something here that they they can't see
[26:40] what's going on because somehow they're
[26:42] blinded and we know jesus blinded them
[26:44] but there's something that when the very
[26:46] god was standing in front of them they
[26:48] just could not see it
[26:51] they were devout men they knew their
[26:53] bible they knew the messiah's coming
[26:56] they knew the prophecies they knew
[26:57] everything that was happening and being
[26:59] fulfilled they knew it wasn't the
[27:01] scriptures but somehow something kept
[27:04] them occupied
[27:07] i i might even say it this way
[27:09] events
[27:10] in their world at that time kept them
[27:14] occupied
[27:16] and jesus was walking and jesus was
[27:19] healing and jesus was saving and jesus
[27:22] was helping and jesus was praying for
[27:24] them but because they looked so much at
[27:26] their realm
[27:28] they could not see it
[27:31] amen so we go and it says
[27:34] and it came to pass that on one of those
[27:37] days
[27:38] as he taught the people in the temple so
[27:40] he's in jerusalem now and he preached
[27:42] the gospel the chief priest and the
[27:44] scribes came upon
[27:47] him with the elders
[27:50] so so the meaning of this word upon or
[27:52] the definition upon it i'm just going to
[27:54] follow in my in my bible let me just get
[27:56] the
[27:59] 20. and if you look at the strong
[28:01] concordance
[28:03] it says when you come upon one is to
[28:05] stand by be present to stand over one
[28:09] place oneself above
[28:12] so this means when they came with the
[28:14] scribes and with with all these leaders
[28:16] and the chief priest they came with the
[28:18] authority they came with a how can i say
[28:21] uh
[28:22] they came with the attitude of
[28:25] you know we're greater than thou who are
[28:27] you so so the whole attitude of them
[28:30] approaching the word of god jesus in
[28:32] flesh just the whole attitude says when
[28:34] they came to him they came upon him so
[28:36] they didn't come to find really out what
[28:38] was going on they came from a position
[28:41] of authority down at jesus so so see
[28:45] where they are they're in this religious
[28:46] realm
[28:47] coming down to the word of god to find
[28:49] out what the word is doing there
[28:52] and they spake unto him saying tell us
[28:54] by what authority does thou do these
[28:57] things
[28:59] so
[29:00] jesus of nazareth you give you the right
[29:03] to come and do miracles
[29:06] who gives you the right to come and
[29:08] stand in our synagogue without having a
[29:10] teaching and tell everybody about god
[29:13] who gives you that right
[29:16] and he answered them and he said unto
[29:18] them i will also ask you one thing
[29:21] and answer me
[29:23] the baptism of john was it from heaven
[29:25] or from men
[29:27] or of men
[29:28] and they reasoned with themselves now
[29:30] see the first thing they do instead of
[29:32] just just giving him the answer
[29:35] we're now going to start reasoning
[29:37] because we need to give this guy answer
[29:38] he's one we many we've got all the
[29:40] scholars we can get but let us just get
[29:42] together and in our heads reason it all
[29:45] out and then give him his answer and
[29:47] they try this they've got they've got
[29:50] they've got the priests the pharisees
[29:52] the guys that knows the torah they can
[29:53] pin a prick through the torah and tell
[29:55] you what's on the other side of that pin
[29:57] basically they knew their word but let
[29:59] us quickly reason together because we
[30:01] need more than one to answer this one
[30:03] this one
[30:04] and i'm just going to say it one more
[30:05] time this one
[30:09] and they reasons by themselves saying if
[30:12] we say from heaven
[30:14] he will say
[30:15] when then believed him not why did you
[30:18] believe him not
[30:19] but when we say of men all the people
[30:22] will stone us for they perceive they
[30:25] were persuaded that john was a prophet
[30:28] and they answered that they could not
[30:30] tell him whence it was and jesus said to
[30:32] them neither tell are you by what
[30:35] authority
[30:36] i do this
[30:38] amen god bless you you may take your
[30:40] seats
[30:43] and he said unto them he says neither
[30:46] tell are you by what authority
[30:48] i do these things
[30:53] so jesus don't clown around for no one
[30:56] he's the word standing in front of
[30:58] people that was supposed to
[31:00] know the word
[31:02] so the title for tonight's sermon
[31:04] um
[31:05] is god is calling your name
[31:10] he's calling and i had such a wonderful
[31:12] time at work i knew i was going to make
[31:14] it here because last night when i was
[31:16] preparing man it was i cannot explain it
[31:21] to you guys i cannot explain
[31:24] the the how tough it was i just want to
[31:26] say it because you get to a point where
[31:28] you get so desperate because you want to
[31:30] hear something from god and it's there's
[31:32] nothing
[31:34] and you have all these thoughts and and
[31:36] and as a
[31:37] brother ben god bless you for being in
[31:39] your position brother andy god bless you
[31:41] brother isaac god bless you brother
[31:44] all the brothers that preach all the
[31:45] brothers that that come up here and just
[31:47] just give a little bit of a word and say
[31:49] bless you because it is
[31:52] man it's such a fight sometimes
[31:54] so god bless you i pray that you will
[31:56] just in every time you prepare please
[31:57] let us know so we can pray with you
[31:59] because i needed it
[32:02] so i was thinking about a certain
[32:04] character in the bible and i will come
[32:05] to it later and and maybe a bit of a
[32:07] lengthy service but please follow me
[32:08] because i'm so nervous i was thinking
[32:11] about this one character and i kept
[32:13] going back to this one character and one
[32:15] character and one character and i said
[32:16] lord but with all these things how does
[32:18] this character fit into your service
[32:20] because i've i've been through the book
[32:22] of luke this month and what a wonderful
[32:24] time i had in there but there's this one
[32:27] character and i cannot
[32:29] place him in where my
[32:31] train of thought goes until this morning
[32:34] amen
[32:36] amen
[32:37] okay so
[32:40] let's jump in there so in john so so
[32:43] here is the pharisees now look at the
[32:44] state of mind look at these pharisees
[32:46] they in front of the word
[32:48] they they come with a certain way and
[32:50] this is just i have to give the negative
[32:52] build a little bit so i can give the
[32:53] positive so we can have a jubilee praise
[32:56] the lord
[32:57] and i still don't know who's going to
[32:58] end so here's the pharisees and they
[33:00] come to jesus and they basically
[33:02] challenging jesus on the word
[33:04] which he asked him a simple question
[33:06] back and they don't know their word they
[33:08] can't answer him
[33:10] and and and the whole thing that i keep
[33:12] seeing here is is they quickly go to
[33:14] their people and they quickly reason
[33:16] about things that's going on they always
[33:18] reason they always reason there's no
[33:21] let's go search the scripture and let's
[33:23] go see how this stacks up and and
[33:26] where's the prophecies and they never go
[33:28] for me and this is just me and
[33:30] fellowship they never go back to this
[33:33] i don't see them go and sit and say hey
[33:35] let's go through the prophecies and say
[33:36] yeah and the prophet joel said this and
[33:38] and all this was a virgin shall conceive
[33:41] and you know all these things that's
[33:42] busy happening and miracles the blind
[33:44] will see that their full year the dead
[33:46] will be raised god is back here it comes
[33:48] with healing in his wings all these
[33:50] prophecies john the baptist that came
[33:52] before him all these things are lining
[33:54] up are we missing your boys what are we
[33:56] missing but instead they stuck to that
[33:59] religious spirit
[34:01] i know all of it
[34:07] so
[34:08] jesus and and here is is nicodemus and
[34:11] nicodemus in john 3
[34:13] he says there was a man of the pharisees
[34:15] named nicodemus a ruler of the jews the
[34:18] same came unto jesus by night and said
[34:20] unto him rabbi
[34:21] we know not what we know not
[34:25] we know that thou art a teacher come
[34:27] from god amen
[34:29] for no man can do these miracles
[34:32] that
[34:33] thou doest except god be with him
[34:37] jesus answered him and now jesus comes
[34:39] with something because because now
[34:40] nicodemus he professes that yes we see
[34:45] the miracles yes we see the healing yes
[34:48] god is with you now jesus comes and he
[34:50] says to him okay
[34:52] jesus answers him and say very verily i
[34:54] say unto thee except the man be born
[34:56] again he cannot see the kingdom of god
[34:59] you can't see it you need to be born
[35:01] again
[35:02] now nicodemus he's in a carnal realm
[35:05] he's in his own line of thinking so
[35:07] again not spiritually minded just what
[35:10] did jesus say to me
[35:12] why would he say i need to be born again
[35:14] this is impossible and he goes and he
[35:15] says nicodemus says unto him how can a
[35:18] man be born when he is old can he enter
[35:21] a second time into his mother's womb and
[35:23] be born
[35:25] so we where is the pharisees where are
[35:28] those scholars the people that are
[35:30] leading people where are their minds in
[35:32] the carnal realm
[35:34] so they can only judge by the carnal
[35:36] realm they can only see events in
[35:38] carnality don't see the spiritual
[35:40] they've long lost the spiritual they
[35:42] lived there the days of miracles are
[35:45] over oh it's happening now yeah but this
[35:46] explanation be else above right
[35:49] there must be a different reason that
[35:52] miracles happen and i'm going to bring
[35:54] it into our day to day days and miracles
[35:56] are over said who
[35:59] said who we had little liam mounter
[36:02] we had an event with that young man
[36:04] there was a dog that's stuck by that man
[36:07] by that young kid
[36:08] and the testimony i pray one day you
[36:11] share it because it's such a powerful
[36:13] testimony brother ben
[36:15] that dog stuck with him
[36:17] and he brought him all the way back
[36:19] all the way back
[36:21] you tell me days of miracles are over
[36:23] it's because we work in a corner realm
[36:26] we think oh yeah but it's one out of
[36:28] fifty chance or one of a hundred chance
[36:31] if you knew all the circumstances around
[36:33] that event
[36:34] it is a miracle it is absolutely a
[36:38] miracle god is a miracle working god but
[36:41] see if we stay in the carnal realm we
[36:43] will miss it and how many miracles slip
[36:46] past us every day that we miss because
[36:49] we are carnally minded
[36:51] because we are in a realm where we we
[36:53] reason in carnality we we reason with
[36:57] the things that's going on covert all
[36:59] these nonsense and who's the next
[37:00] politician and that vaccine and no
[37:03] vaccine and is there another one and you
[37:06] know
[37:07] this vaccine is like is there is it him
[37:09] is there another they just want to keep
[37:10] going and taking more listen
[37:13] forget about those things it's keeping
[37:15] you busy and it it's distracting you
[37:18] all of us me too i mean hello i'm
[37:21] preaching just in general most of this
[37:23] came to me so i'm digesting give me
[37:25] chance
[37:27] and jesus answered him so he's answering
[37:29] his question that says can i be born
[37:31] again
[37:32] and he says very verily i say unto thee
[37:34] except the man be born of water and of
[37:36] the spirit he cannot enter the kingdom
[37:38] of god so god jesus himself
[37:42] saying water baptism
[37:44] is the way to start the journey
[37:47] you you have to start
[37:48] somewhere so i i was never ever gonna
[37:51] put this in but it's in so here we are
[37:54] so why would god say to him you need to
[37:57] be born of water
[37:59] blood spirit the three like a baby
[38:02] coming to the world you get the water in
[38:04] the blood and then the spirit goes into
[38:06] the baby why would the pattern change
[38:10] why would it change
[38:12] so here he says the word comes to him
[38:14] and he says
[38:17] that which is born of the flesh is the
[38:19] flesh
[38:20] and which is born of the spirit is the
[38:22] spirit of it marvel not i say unto thee
[38:26] ye must be born again
[38:30] so now jesus comes and he gives him the
[38:32] answer you need to take the first step
[38:34] and the first step is baptism
[38:37] so i'll give you a little bit of my
[38:38] testimony
[38:40] before i got baptized
[38:42] i didn't understand that the lord used
[38:44] my wife in a mighty way
[38:46] to to bring me into this this gospel and
[38:49] i praise the lord and and if you ever
[38:51] have a a wife that that loves the lord
[38:54] and and just keep praying for your
[38:56] husband's and husband if your wife don't
[38:58] love the lord keep praying for her
[39:00] because god can and will
[39:03] do it
[39:04] if you just can just hold on
[39:08] all things are possible only believe so
[39:10] we my wife decides she wants to be
[39:12] baptized
[39:13] and she's reading the supernatural books
[39:15] and and it comes over the pulpit time
[39:17] and again and because i'm sitting in a
[39:19] carnal realm i don't quite understand
[39:21] what is going on with this whole baptism
[39:23] thing you know why is it so important i
[39:25] was dedicated i was baptized as a baby
[39:28] what's so significant on it
[39:30] but something i don't think of is why is
[39:33] it such a hard decision
[39:36] why in the name of jesus christ why is
[39:38] it so hard to go and say i want to
[39:41] follow jesus i want to go and i want to
[39:43] say to a demon
[39:45] get out in the name of jesus christ i
[39:47] want to rebuke him
[39:49] and all things i want to do i want to do
[39:50] in the name of jesus
[39:52] but when it comes to taking his name
[39:54] something in me goes oh no but i you
[39:56] know father son holy ghost you know
[39:59] except i'm baptized i was sprinkled but
[40:01] hey you know almost drowned there i was
[40:04] like too small
[40:06] so so why am i now fighting this whole
[40:09] baptism thing and children listen it's
[40:12] going to come your way
[40:13] get your attention wake up
[40:16] the baptism question will always come
[40:18] your way because that's just the first
[40:20] step
[40:21] it's not going to change your life
[40:23] overnight like this
[40:25] can oh wow
[40:27] because once you pick a side
[40:29] and you choose which side you're on and
[40:32] you choose who you're going to be
[40:33] married to
[40:34] then all hell breaks loose
[40:37] don't think once you said lord i love
[40:40] you and i want to be baptized all's
[40:42] going to go well you pick the site the
[40:44] devil goes
[40:45] gotcha
[40:47] you just made this big target of jesus
[40:48] christ right on your back on the front
[40:51] of you on your head to your toe because
[40:53] now you actually chose the right side
[40:56] not a title
[40:58] not not father son and holy ghost and
[41:01] how i understood it is is and this is
[41:03] how it was revealed to me when my wife
[41:05] said to her i don't want to be married i
[41:07] am now a father
[41:09] i used to be a son
[41:11] and one day when i pass to the other
[41:13] realm and it's not the rapture i don't
[41:15] change the body it will be a
[41:17] supernatural body it will be i'll be a
[41:18] ghost spirit okay spirit being but i
[41:21] know we have bodies there waiting for us
[41:23] but just hear me out follow the train
[41:26] so what's my name
[41:29] what is my name
[41:31] my name is not father
[41:33] though my little one calls me dada
[41:36] my name is not son so my dad calls me
[41:38] his son
[41:39] and when i die and they say oh they lace
[41:42] poor spirit no
[41:44] there is armand rest in peace
[41:47] so my name is armand
[41:49] so when i want to use the name of jesus
[41:51] christ and i want to call him on the
[41:54] scene shouldn't i be married to that one
[41:56] first
[41:57] because if you don't have the ring you
[41:59] don't have the authority
[42:01] he said and in acts 2 38
[42:04] paul's uh paul says he says and
[42:08] peter said he says repent and be
[42:10] baptized for the remissions of of sin in
[42:13] the name of our lord jesus christ for
[42:15] the remission of your sins and i've
[42:17] referred in my notes and you shall be
[42:20] filled with the holy ghost okay but i'm
[42:22] going to read it to you because you know
[42:24] i don't want to get it wrong because
[42:25] it's the word of god
[42:28] so acts 2 38 and that and i had it but i
[42:30] just kind of lost that
[42:33] train of thought it said and peter said
[42:34] unto them repent and be baptized every
[42:37] one of you in the name of jesus christ
[42:38] for the remission of your sins and you
[42:40] shall receive the ghost the gift of the
[42:43] holy ghost
[42:44] for the promise is unto you and your
[42:46] children and all that are after off even
[42:50] as many as the lord our god shall call
[42:52] so he's still calling
[42:54] okay so now my wife she's to me that i
[42:57] need to be baptized
[42:59] because because that's the step one so i
[43:02] walk to the water we say to brother ben
[43:05] we want to be baptized and we get to the
[43:08] sermon in the morning it's a sunday
[43:10] morning and we choose the nicest we're
[43:12] going to choose a nice sunday and
[43:13] everything and every kind of thing is
[43:14] going to be so nice
[43:16] you know the sun's going to shine the
[43:18] birds is going to tweet and oh it's just
[43:20] going to be a glorious day and all the
[43:21] best photos will be taken and this is
[43:23] really in my mind i'm thinking amen this
[43:26] is going to be event
[43:27] we showed up to church and brother andy
[43:29] prayed for water because the river was
[43:31] so low it was you that prayed for water
[43:33] was it brother ben somebody prayed for
[43:35] water in the river because the river was
[43:38] too low and we couldn't baptize where
[43:39] the usual spot was so they said lord
[43:41] just let it please rain
[43:43] so there can be water so we can have a
[43:45] baptism
[43:46] man did it rain
[43:48] it didn't even rain it was cold
[43:51] we were sitting at church with the
[43:52] heaters on well now the heat is on
[43:54] because now i have to choose you know
[43:56] we're looking at the widow we were still
[43:58] downstairs and we're sitting right the
[43:59] back corner we're looking out the window
[44:01] and i remember going is this not how i
[44:03] planned this
[44:06] and vince preaching and just before he
[44:08] goes he goes um we have a baptism today
[44:11] brother romantic sister chantel they
[44:13] decided to be baptized and praise the
[44:16] lord you know yes i'm going we call back
[44:18] out now
[44:21] no excuse is gonna get around this one
[44:23] you know except for maybe going down
[44:24] with the river but it was flowing
[44:27] so so we get here to the water and it's
[44:29] under the bridge there by stokes valley
[44:33] beautiful place this man had some
[44:34] wonderful times here and now we get to
[44:36] the river and it's cold and it doesn't
[44:38] stop raining and it's still busy and
[44:40] we're under the bridge and the water's
[44:42] dropping everywhere because it's big
[44:43] drops now not small drops because you're
[44:44] under the bridge all the water is coming
[44:46] down and we're all standing there in
[44:48] this pool of water and ben gets first in
[44:50] the water but you should have seen his
[44:52] he didn't he didn't just go in he waited
[44:55] carefully okay
[44:57] try to get his feet and the water is
[44:58] flowing but there's one pool where the
[45:01] water just turns a little bit and then
[45:02] goes out slow and we choose that pool
[45:06] and i go into the water and and
[45:08] don't know why i shared it so indeed but
[45:10] i want to tell you something
[45:12] and there was a photo taken before i was
[45:14] baptized
[45:16] and i'll share it on the brothers and
[45:18] sisters because i think you should see
[45:19] it there was fear
[45:22] on my face
[45:24] fear the display there was no display of
[45:28] i'm giving it all over there was fear on
[45:30] my face because i knew that i knew once
[45:33] that i go under i ain't coming back the
[45:36] same amen
[45:37] i knew and something in me and this is
[45:39] what i want to say to you as well if
[45:41] you're born and shaped in iniquity
[45:43] coming to the world speaking lies that
[45:45] is what's within you
[45:46] before you take on his name that's
[45:49] scared
[45:50] because when legion came to to to jesus
[45:53] he fell at his feet but he first asked
[45:55] him have you come to torment us before
[45:57] our time
[45:58] they were scared there was fear
[46:01] and and i could see it in my face and
[46:04] and when i went down and i came up
[46:06] i couldn't feel my head couldn't feel my
[46:09] eyes couldn't feel my ears i could feel
[46:11] nothing it was so cold
[46:13] but i did it
[46:15] and i said
[46:16] ben said can i pray and he started
[46:17] praying and we prayed together and i
[46:19] walked out and i took my wife's hand and
[46:21] i had the privilege of leading my wife
[46:23] into the water
[46:25] and she got baptized and the wednesday
[46:27] they broke into our house and they stole
[46:29] our tv
[46:31] and my xbox
[46:33] and everything that kept us busy
[46:35] stole it all right so if there's some
[46:38] some juniors here that wants to get
[46:39] baptized please i can arrange them to
[46:41] come and steal your stuff at your house
[46:43] hey amen
[46:45] it's not an inside job but it was an
[46:46] inside job because god knew that that oh
[46:50] man we were so angry but god knew that
[46:52] once we picked aside he's going to start
[46:54] doing the work and he just chose some
[46:57] poor fellow to break into my house to
[46:59] take my stuff away he chose that guy
[47:01] predestinated to do it because he wanted
[47:03] me to clear out anything
[47:06] that could get between me and him
[47:08] because i've now picked aside if i now
[47:10] went back into my old routine
[47:12] then i would put his work that much
[47:15] further back and he's in the job of
[47:17] finishing what he started
[47:19] okay amen
[47:20] wasn't going to preach that but there it
[47:22] is
[47:23] amen
[47:24] so now when i look at the pharisees and
[47:27] i'm in the and i know still in the book
[47:28] of luke
[47:29] um
[47:30] and we were at luke 20
[47:34] then and we're going to go there from
[47:36] verse 9. so so then i see the attitude
[47:39] of the pharisees and jesus sees it as
[47:42] well
[47:43] and now he's going to warn them he
[47:46] actually god almighty gives everyone a
[47:49] fair chance
[47:51] he's not an unrighteous god he's not a
[47:54] mean god he gives all of us a fair
[47:56] chance you need to seek out your
[47:58] salvation
[47:59] you
[48:00] but so he sees what's in their heart he
[48:03] sees in what realm they're operating and
[48:05] he thought let me just pull out this
[48:07] this little parable and i just give it
[48:10] to them so maybe that their eyes can
[48:12] open so that they can see what's going
[48:14] on here and this is actually what i
[48:16] wanted to preach a bit
[48:17] he says and then he began verse 9 began
[48:20] to speak to the people and he spoke this
[48:21] parable a certain man planted a vineyard
[48:25] and led it forth to a husbandman so a
[48:28] husbandman
[48:29] the definition i have is someone that
[48:32] tolls the soil
[48:34] so when the master leaves the place he
[48:36] takes care
[48:38] of the master stuff so he's in control
[48:40] of all that the master has and his job
[48:43] is to
[48:44] fill the soil and reap the harvest
[48:46] that's his job he's a minister
[48:49] the pharisees were ministers and he is
[48:52] basically telling them that your job is
[48:54] to till the ground
[48:56] to win souls for god
[48:58] you're missing it
[49:00] and they just get angry you'll see
[49:03] he says and he went into a far country a
[49:05] long off and maybe i'll just i'll just
[49:07] have it i'll talk about it okay because
[49:10] because i don't want to read it or i'm
[49:11] not the best of bible reader there is
[49:13] like nicely i miss a couple of words and
[49:16] i don't want to miss words of word of
[49:17] god so he goes off from the far country
[49:20] and then he he goes and if we go there
[49:23] and he says and he sends a servant to
[49:25] the husbandman that they should give him
[49:28] off the fruit of the vineyard
[49:30] his vineyard
[49:32] so the first one comes there
[49:34] and they say sorry
[49:36] and they beat him
[49:38] they beat him
[49:39] and they send them away with nothing so
[49:41] the first messenger
[49:43] from the king of kings
[49:46] comes down i say say boys
[49:49] lord wants his harvest
[49:51] he wants his children
[49:53] what do we have here they beat him and
[49:55] they send the prophet away one prophet
[49:57] down
[49:59] now he says and he sent another servant
[50:02] and they beat him also
[50:04] and then entreated him shamefully
[50:08] so now see how wicked they go as time
[50:11] goes by
[50:12] these guys just get more wicked every
[50:14] time god does something this lord of the
[50:16] vineyard he does something and they keep
[50:19] on going more
[50:20] more wicked
[50:21] isn't this the world we live in right
[50:23] now
[50:24] so the second one come and they say
[50:26] treat him shamefully and to treat him
[50:28] shamefully in the strong concordance if
[50:30] you go there it says to dishonor insult
[50:33] trees treat with contempt
[50:36] and then it says
[50:38] it's whether it's in word
[50:40] or deed
[50:42] or thought
[50:45] see jesus is the discerner of the heart
[50:48] and the intent of the heart
[50:50] so so he sees not just your actions he
[50:53] doesn't see your words he sees what's in
[50:56] here
[50:58] so that's how they treated the servant
[51:00] really really bad so they thought bad of
[51:02] him looked bad at him and then they they
[51:04] send him away empty again a third
[51:08] and now they wounded him
[51:11] and they cast him out
[51:13] so it went from just giving him a pak's
[51:16] law
[51:17] sending him off
[51:18] then giving him a hiding and treating
[51:21] him really bad and now they wound him
[51:23] what's next
[51:24] and now jesus is trying to get the
[51:26] pharisees attention to say hey scripture
[51:28] is going to be fulfilled this is where
[51:30] you're at
[51:32] and then he changes and he says but then
[51:35] he says but then
[51:37] the lord of the vineyards said what
[51:39] shall i do
[51:41] what can i do
[51:43] that can help these people see again
[51:46] to the pharisees
[51:48] and they say i will send my son
[51:52] because they will have reverence they'll
[51:53] know that he's from me they will treat
[51:56] him good and they will they will hearken
[51:58] unto his voice
[52:01] and so he send them out and then when
[52:05] the husbandmen saw him they reasoned
[52:08] among themselves see again
[52:11] religious spirit
[52:13] reasoning
[52:14] the word comes this way the son of god
[52:16] is in front of the jews saying hey i'm
[52:18] here you can have millennium right now
[52:21] we can change it all right now no
[52:23] scripture but you have that choice but
[52:25] we're still going to reason
[52:27] we're still going to reason what's going
[52:28] on now we still want a reason why this
[52:31] vaccine why not that why is it coding
[52:33] why is it that we're still going to
[52:34] reason just under this and this that and
[52:36] this one and that one we're still going
[52:37] to reason what we're in how the work's
[52:39] going to be what's next week what nets
[52:41] we we want to reason everything so we
[52:44] can understand it so we can move on but
[52:46] are you then led by the spirit of god
[52:51] being led is like a sheep
[52:54] you just surrender you just say lord
[52:58] i don't know
[53:00] i don't know i don't know where to go
[53:02] today i don't know who to see today i
[53:04] don't know what you want to accomplish
[53:05] in my life i've got all these notes i
[53:07] don't know what to do with it i've got a
[53:09] brother or sister that worked i want to
[53:11] testify to them i don't know how to do
[53:13] it i don't know
[53:14] that's the attitude of a christian it's
[53:17] like a lamb but these guys
[53:19] they want a reason they want to go to
[53:21] the best minister they want to go to the
[53:23] best guy that's got the most knowledge
[53:25] about the message they can give them all
[53:26] the quotes in this type of thing so that
[53:28] they can out quote the next one they're
[53:30] missing the very point that the message
[53:32] is pointing them to the lord of the
[53:34] vineyard to his son
[53:36] to the one that is introducing to say
[53:38] hey guys don't get caught up
[53:41] in mental
[53:43] telepathy if i can say or mental
[53:45] gymnastics if we can say that don't get
[53:48] caught up in the carnality don't be
[53:50] super spiritual to try and over figure
[53:53] everything out be led by the spirit of
[53:55] god
[53:57] so remember the sermon's name is the
[54:00] sermon is called he's calling your name
[54:02] just stay with that please
[54:04] because i'm jumping a bit around where i
[54:05] shouldn't
[54:08] so they killed him then he said he said
[54:12] would the husband will not come and
[54:13] destroy them and shall give the vineyard
[54:16] to others
[54:17] and when they heard them they say god
[54:19] forbid
[54:20] and beheld them and and jesus bealed
[54:22] them and he beat out them and said
[54:24] what is this then that is written the
[54:26] stone which the boldest rejected the
[54:28] same is became the headstone of the
[54:31] corner
[54:32] whosoever shall fall upon this stone
[54:35] shall be broken but whosoever shall fall
[54:39] it shall fall on it will grind it to
[54:41] powder
[54:42] so i repeat that last bit but on
[54:45] whosoever it shall fall it will grind
[54:48] him to powder
[54:51] so now the pharisees have a choice
[54:53] and they can now choose
[54:56] and then this is afterwards it says and
[54:57] the chief priest and the scribes the
[54:59] same hour sought to lay hands on him
[55:03] and they feared the people for they
[55:05] perceived that he have spoken this
[55:07] parable against them
[55:09] well now you're getting it boys
[55:11] god is trying to warn you hey you know
[55:14] there's ref to come for the choices you
[55:16] make time is running out scripture is
[55:18] going to be fulfilled but i'm still
[55:20] going to give you a choice to repent i'm
[55:23] still going to give you a choice to to
[55:25] to choose life and not death
[55:29] but that's carnal
[55:31] it's carnal
[55:34] amen
[55:39] so then
[55:43] thinking of this and i know it's all
[55:44] negative but we're getting there
[55:46] brothers please
[55:47] have mercy
[55:48] um
[55:49] then make me think of lazarus
[55:53] so then i'm thinking man this sounds so
[55:55] familiar what about lazarus
[55:57] lazarus the poor man that was at the
[55:59] rich man's gate
[56:00] just wanted to have some of those bread
[56:02] crumbs and here
[56:04] lazarus dies the rich man dies
[56:07] lazarus goes to heaven in the bosom of
[56:08] father abraham the rich man is in hell
[56:11] see what i'm trying to say
[56:12] the rich man it says here
[56:15] that he was arrayed in fine linen
[56:18] and he was
[56:19] they call it feared f-a-r-e-d ferret and
[56:22] and that fear it means that he was
[56:24] joyful he was happy he was content
[56:27] and then after that they said say
[56:29] something like uh some to you some to it
[56:33] something can you put that on uh go to
[56:35] luke 16 verse 19. maybe andy can give me
[56:38] this word because i can't pronounce it
[56:40] as well but it says there was a certain
[56:42] rich man which was clothed in purple and
[56:44] in fine linen and feared and sumptuously
[56:48] every day so when i looked at the word
[56:50] sumptuously means without need
[56:53] there's nothing if you look at the
[56:55] strong concordance on it he's happy he's
[56:57] joyful and he's so happy that he's
[56:59] joyful there's nothing wrong
[57:03] is that right
[57:05] sumptuously thank you very much brother
[57:06] andy man god bless the brothers they can
[57:08] speak english
[57:12] so so he was in a happy place okay it
[57:15] didn't say it was a believer didn't say
[57:16] it was an unbeliever he was contained
[57:19] okay he had everything he wanted
[57:21] but he had a beggar at his gate
[57:25] somebody wanting food
[57:27] spiritual
[57:28] whatever he had someone that was in need
[57:30] so then they both died he sees lazarus
[57:33] and and the bosom of father abraham and
[57:35] he cease to because he's now in hell and
[57:37] he says to father abraham can you just
[57:39] ask lazarus just to run a drop of water
[57:42] on his finger to me and brother and
[57:45] brother abraham
[57:46] abraham says
[57:47] i cannot do it there's a chasm between
[57:49] me and you
[57:50] we can't come there
[57:52] and now it dawns on him
[57:55] that whoa whoa in verse 27 i've got
[57:58] brothers
[57:59] look this place is horrible
[58:02] i've got brothers and and you need to go
[58:04] warn them now all of a sudden he changed
[58:07] his whole approach and he says to he
[58:09] says to him for i he says and he said i
[58:11] pray thee therefore father verse 27 that
[58:13] thou would send him to my father's house
[58:16] for i have five brothers that they may
[58:18] testify and at least that they don't
[58:21] come to this place of torment
[58:23] don't let my brothers come you just send
[58:25] someone to go
[58:27] please and abraham said unto him they
[58:30] have moses
[58:31] and the prophets let them hear them
[58:36] it's harsh
[58:38] man he just wants his family saved
[58:41] but he says there's a message i've sent
[58:43] and there's a prophet i took time to
[58:45] send to you in the right time to give
[58:48] you a message to introduce you to me so
[58:50] that you do not go into this place but
[58:52] they chose to follow other things
[58:55] because they were still operating in
[58:57] that carnal realm
[58:59] and then he said nay father abraham but
[59:02] if one unto them go unto them from the
[59:04] dead they will repent
[59:08] so if they see lazarus stand up
[59:10] and go to them they'll believe
[59:14] how many did jesus raise before luke 20.
[59:18] what happened in the ministry of jesus
[59:20] christ the lame walk blind see the the
[59:22] the crippled man that was healed in in
[59:25] church service
[59:28] and they murmured against that and they
[59:29] sought to kill him because of it how
[59:32] much more did god have to show them
[59:35] but they didn't believe the prophets
[59:36] because they weren't looking for a
[59:38] prophet they were looking for some other
[59:40] thing
[59:42] sorry i get passionate because i think
[59:44] some people might be missing i'm going
[59:45] to say it one more time they weren't
[59:46] looking for a prophet
[59:48] they were looking for some other thing
[59:51] their attention wasn't what was
[59:53] happening in that time in the midst the
[59:55] attention was a far off
[59:58] and as many as the prophets did and
[1:00:00] signs and wonders and prayer alliance
[1:00:02] and thus say of the lords and all that's
[1:00:04] happening through the ministry of
[1:00:06] brother branham the people that was even
[1:00:08] in the healing lines missed it
[1:00:10] turns around in the prayer line walks
[1:00:12] away and he goes lord let them not miss
[1:00:14] it have mercy
[1:00:16] he says brother so-and-so or mr
[1:00:19] so-and-so
[1:00:20] i'm calling you so god even gives him
[1:00:22] the name he calls the brother back
[1:00:24] so he would catch it
[1:00:27] and they're standing where these people
[1:00:29] walking and the the lame are raising up
[1:00:32] and people are worshiping and cancers
[1:00:34] are falling off and miracles are
[1:00:35] happening with these things happening
[1:00:37] here there's the event taking place and
[1:00:39] people miss it
[1:00:40] because they're not spiritually minded
[1:00:43] they don't think miracles and they don't
[1:00:45] think it's possible they just think
[1:00:48] what's this
[1:00:50] and god is wanting to call those people
[1:00:53] and he does the miracle and the miracle
[1:00:55] is not for healing like brother ben said
[1:00:58] they'll go sick again
[1:00:59] raising the dead he'll die again
[1:01:02] it's to get their attention
[1:01:06] and he said unto him if they not hear
[1:01:08] moses and the prophets neither will they
[1:01:10] persuade it
[1:01:12] though one rose from the dead
[1:01:15] hard words
[1:01:16] that's what he says
[1:01:23] i lost my place
[1:01:24] now
[1:01:25] this is the state of the
[1:01:27] the
[1:01:28] keep busy
[1:01:29] mortal one
[1:01:31] that's just dwelling and has has
[1:01:33] absolutely missed
[1:01:35] jesus in the present moment it is a real
[1:01:38] state it's happening today the reason i
[1:01:41] said it's not to scare you the reason i
[1:01:43] said is not to get you to fear the
[1:01:45] reason i'm trying to tell you that is i
[1:01:47] want you just to think if anything
[1:01:49] happens to you don't go straight into
[1:01:52] carnal realm
[1:01:53] because the carnal realm
[1:01:55] it is real bad because once you start
[1:01:58] going cardinal round then you start
[1:02:00] reasoning once you start reasoning then
[1:02:02] you form an opinion once you form an
[1:02:04] opinion you cut whatever you form the
[1:02:07] reasoning and opinion from anyone no
[1:02:09] matter what circumstance
[1:02:11] that you kill the influence
[1:02:13] on your life and people around your life
[1:02:17] so i know it's been preached over this
[1:02:18] pulpit many times but but carnal minded
[1:02:21] does not get you anywhere with god the
[1:02:23] scripture says to be spiritual minded is
[1:02:26] from god it's life to be carnally minded
[1:02:29] is is against god
[1:02:32] so so the whole thing now and this is
[1:02:34] where god showed me was because i was
[1:02:36] trying to get something from god in a
[1:02:38] natural realm i was trying brother q
[1:02:40] bean you said it just before the service
[1:02:42] praise the lord for our deacons
[1:02:45] seriously if i was looking for a thought
[1:02:48] i was looking for a sermon i was looking
[1:02:50] for something but god said i don't want
[1:02:53] you to think
[1:02:55] i don't want you to think i want you to
[1:02:57] just go
[1:02:58] do what i told you and whatever happens
[1:03:01] after that just let it let it let it do
[1:03:03] and that's what i'm doing so i'm
[1:03:04] trusting in the lord that this will give
[1:03:06] glory to him and not me
[1:03:09] so please don't look at me
[1:03:11] because that well you understand what i
[1:03:14] mean don't
[1:03:16] read between the lines
[1:03:21] okay
[1:03:23] now here it comes
[1:03:25] man
[1:03:26] luke 19 brother
[1:03:28] uh either can you put that up please
[1:03:30] verse one
[1:03:32] this is this morning
[1:03:34] sister robin put this up man
[1:03:38] look i didn't feel very well but after
[1:03:40] this
[1:03:41] i was buzzing
[1:03:42] they we call it stimulating hey i was i
[1:03:44] was actually
[1:03:46] so excited because this is the character
[1:03:50] that i had in my mind this is the
[1:03:52] character that i couldn't place
[1:03:55] why would i preach about pharisees
[1:03:57] carnality and all these things and how
[1:04:00] does zacchaeus
[1:04:02] all of a sudden come into this whole
[1:04:04] thing
[1:04:05] so yeah zacchaeus man i love it praise
[1:04:07] the lord and now i'm going to preach i'm
[1:04:09] going to close my book because i know
[1:04:10] i'm just going to say it as it is okay
[1:04:12] so there that goes i'll keep the bible
[1:04:14] open the word of god is always open
[1:04:16] so
[1:04:17] i said uh and jesus entered and paid
[1:04:20] passed through jericho this is now on
[1:04:22] the way before the pharisees rejected
[1:04:24] him in in luke 20. he's on his way there
[1:04:27] and he goes through jericho those walls
[1:04:29] brother ed were there again
[1:04:31] those walls fell again
[1:04:33] they build them up and they fall down
[1:04:35] and they build them up and they fall
[1:04:36] down they cannot keep god out of no
[1:04:39] place and behold there was a man named
[1:04:42] zacchaeus
[1:04:43] and he was the chief among the publicans
[1:04:46] and he was rich
[1:04:48] so remember the rich man went to hell
[1:04:51] i just said that that made me thought of
[1:04:53] that that lazarus the rich man had a
[1:04:55] choice
[1:04:56] and he still didn't make it and and
[1:04:58] jesus says he said man it's so hard for
[1:05:00] a rich man to get there not that if you
[1:05:02] have money you won't get it but there's
[1:05:03] so many things to worry about
[1:05:05] there's so many things to try and keep
[1:05:07] at bay and and next day in this day
[1:05:09] brother andy you've got
[1:05:11] you guys on more than one business how
[1:05:13] easy is it
[1:05:15] mate you got it from every side and
[1:05:17] you're trying to fend this and do this
[1:05:18] and do that and and you're so busy that
[1:05:21] you mostly operate in a carnal realm no
[1:05:24] i'm not saying it about brother andy but
[1:05:27] you and i've seen it you go a little bit
[1:05:29] into a spiritual realm and you try it
[1:05:31] again and somebody plucks you out of it
[1:05:33] and then you want to go a little bit
[1:05:34] back and say lord i want to think about
[1:05:35] and something plucks you out of it and
[1:05:37] you keep getting plucked out of that
[1:05:38] place
[1:05:39] where god wants you permanently to be
[1:05:42] hallelujah so now see it business mean
[1:05:46] business mean god don't want you carnal
[1:05:50] he don't want you carnal not even in
[1:05:52] your business
[1:05:54] i'm gonna say it as it is he don't want
[1:05:57] you to think like the world because
[1:05:59] you're not of the world no matter if
[1:06:01] you're a shrewd businessman no matter if
[1:06:03] you deal with unbelievers and sinners
[1:06:05] and whatever you cannot operate ever in
[1:06:09] a carnal realm in your business then
[1:06:11] it's not god's business
[1:06:13] because god is in the business of
[1:06:15] getting souls you're a businessman you
[1:06:17] do god's business he'll bring everything
[1:06:19] in but the moment you operate in the
[1:06:21] carnal realm you break your testimony
[1:06:23] god doesn't get the glory and you will
[1:06:25] reap what you sow
[1:06:28] that wasn't in the sermon either
[1:06:33] you cannot operate your business in the
[1:06:35] corner realm i've heard somebody say it
[1:06:37] one day and i said that's utter nonsense
[1:06:39] if it's god's business then god runs the
[1:06:42] business
[1:06:43] then you must be more spiritual minded
[1:06:45] than everyone
[1:06:47] because your business because it
[1:06:49] represents god's business is going to be
[1:06:51] under attack
[1:06:53] because it's already standing for the
[1:06:55] kingdom of god so your business will
[1:06:57] always be under attack
[1:06:59] it's never going to change until you're
[1:07:01] raptured
[1:07:02] so if you're going to run it then in a
[1:07:04] carnal mind you will always pay the
[1:07:07] penalty but if you can just be spiritual
[1:07:09] minded no matter like brother isaac said
[1:07:11] bring it on
[1:07:12] no matter what they bring god will make
[1:07:14] a way even if your backs against the
[1:07:16] wall god will still make a way
[1:07:18] but we operate in the supernatural thank
[1:07:22] you brother isaac for supernatural we
[1:07:24] operate in the supernatural we are not
[1:07:27] carnal kids at school cannot be carnal
[1:07:31] we are representation of the living god
[1:07:34] where your feet goes joshua goes god you
[1:07:37] are walking on this earth and every
[1:07:40] footstep must be spiritual
[1:07:44] i'm not saying be super spiritual don't
[1:07:46] get me wrong i'm saying if anything
[1:07:48] comes against you and they say something
[1:07:50] you must discern thinking men's filter
[1:07:52] where is this coming from what is it
[1:07:55] achieving and how is god going to get
[1:07:57] the glory because if god doesn't get the
[1:07:59] glory what am i doing here
[1:08:01] what am i missing
[1:08:05] and he sought to see jesus now see see
[1:08:09] zacchaeus had such a
[1:08:11] such a need to see miracles he had such
[1:08:14] a need to see jesus he he was desperate
[1:08:17] this man was a rich man he had
[1:08:19] everything but he knew at a stage there
[1:08:21] was something missing
[1:08:23] and he couldn't put his finger on it but
[1:08:25] he heard a commotion
[1:08:26] because they knew that that jesus was on
[1:08:29] his way and there with jesus when they
[1:08:31] said the people pushed up against him
[1:08:34] he was always people around him because
[1:08:37] miracles was happening
[1:08:39] so there was a great attraction
[1:08:41] and zacchaeus came and he tried to get
[1:08:42] over and see him and he's a man of short
[1:08:44] stature and it says here and he saw
[1:08:47] jesus who he was and he could not for
[1:08:50] the priest so that means a lot of people
[1:08:52] was preaching upon him there was a big
[1:08:54] crowd around him and in those days they
[1:08:56] weren't as pc as us to go can you do it
[1:08:58] to me to be distance
[1:09:00] they they that lady that touched him of
[1:09:02] his garment had to push through people
[1:09:04] to just to go touch and she got scared
[1:09:07] because she pushed people she wanted the
[1:09:09] blessing when she touched it he says who
[1:09:11] touched me she actually pulled back and
[1:09:12] whoa okay it got real
[1:09:15] you know because i just i just wanted to
[1:09:17] be healed and now it got real that
[1:09:19] everybody goes ah you know jesus
[1:09:20] everybody's touching you you know we're
[1:09:22] in the preseason but virtue left me
[1:09:25] someone came and touched me and then she
[1:09:27] come and she fell at his feet see it's
[1:09:29] me
[1:09:30] she was scared
[1:09:31] because
[1:09:32] something happened to jesus but she knew
[1:09:35] she wasn't the same
[1:09:37] she knew something changed
[1:09:40] so then he said to her you're healed
[1:09:42] your faith has healed you
[1:09:44] so now zacchaeus he's the same he's the
[1:09:46] same minded he sees jesus coming and
[1:09:49] there's something speaking to him saying
[1:09:51] man i need to see jesus but i don't need
[1:09:54] to just see jesus i want to see him in
[1:09:56] my life
[1:09:57] i want to get the fellowship with this
[1:09:59] man
[1:10:00] but now he's in the tree and he's a bit
[1:10:02] hiding because remember he did some
[1:10:04] dodgy deals in the past
[1:10:06] you know he's a businessman he he
[1:10:08] operated in the carnal realm
[1:10:10] okay he wasn't running his business as
[1:10:13] god's business he was running about i do
[1:10:15] this for you do that for me and you owe
[1:10:16] me and i do that and he was a carnal man
[1:10:20] and this is where zacchaeus stories get
[1:10:22] real real it just gets so beautiful
[1:10:25] so now he climbed up the tree and and he
[1:10:28] ran up and he climbed up into a sycamore
[1:10:30] tree
[1:10:31] just to see him
[1:10:33] for he was to pass that way
[1:10:35] and jesus came to that place and he
[1:10:38] looked up
[1:10:41] the smallest man
[1:10:43] on this earth
[1:10:44] now see how meek our god was how gentle
[1:10:47] how small he was he's the god of heaven
[1:10:51] deity walking on earth
[1:10:54] and he looks up at the shortest man
[1:10:56] that's around there
[1:10:57] say hey zacchaeus
[1:11:01] think about the humility he didn't say
[1:11:03] come down and now i talk to you he came
[1:11:05] to him where he was
[1:11:07] and he the lowest look up to him up
[1:11:10] there
[1:11:10] this is how he sees people he lifts them
[1:11:13] up he don't break them down he don't
[1:11:15] step on him he don't you don't push him
[1:11:18] down on people he lifts them up
[1:11:21] and when they up there then he talks to
[1:11:24] them no matter how the trial is if you
[1:11:26] think you far down in a trial guess what
[1:11:29] jesus is just under you
[1:11:31] lifting you up
[1:11:32] saying look up
[1:11:34] look up
[1:11:36] man there's only god that can be in two
[1:11:38] places he can lift you up and he can be
[1:11:40] above you know
[1:11:42] amen
[1:11:43] and then when he saw jesus come to that
[1:11:46] place he looked up and saw him and he
[1:11:48] said to him zacchaeus make haste and
[1:11:51] come down
[1:11:52] for this day for today i must abide at
[1:11:56] thy house
[1:11:58] so
[1:11:59] i had a i had a meeting with you
[1:12:02] i knew where were you going to be
[1:12:04] zacchaeus
[1:12:05] i knew exactly where you were
[1:12:08] and guess what
[1:12:09] i knew your name amen and he called him
[1:12:13] by name
[1:12:16] not by chance
[1:12:17] not if somebody here that wants to
[1:12:19] follow god or somebody here that he said
[1:12:23] zacchaeus
[1:12:25] so when i chose my side and i followed
[1:12:27] jesus jesus christ came to me and he
[1:12:30] said armand
[1:12:31] follow me
[1:12:33] armand salvation has come to your house
[1:12:35] we were in a prayer meeting at my house
[1:12:37] just in stokes valley brother ben and
[1:12:40] brother andy
[1:12:41] and we sat there and it's the first
[1:12:42] friday and i've seen it many times and
[1:12:44] i'll say it still because god is to be
[1:12:46] experienced
[1:12:47] god is to live in your life god is not a
[1:12:51] mental telepathy it's not a fire of
[1:12:54] thought it is an experience
[1:12:56] something that when it shakes you you
[1:12:59] want to tell everyone about it
[1:13:01] when it when it comes to your house you
[1:13:03] wanna you don't understand it
[1:13:06] sometimes you just go i have no idea
[1:13:07] what's going on here but when deity
[1:13:09] enters the house you know he's calling
[1:13:12] your name and we started praying and
[1:13:14] brother andy said okay armand you start
[1:13:16] praying because it's your house and i
[1:13:18] started praying and it was just a simple
[1:13:20] prayer because i didn't know what to
[1:13:21] pray i've never even prayed in my house
[1:13:23] on a friday night
[1:13:26] lord is my witness
[1:13:28] never ever had a prayer meeting in my
[1:13:31] house on a friday where i was calling to
[1:13:34] have fellowship with god instead of
[1:13:36] having fellowship with
[1:13:38] mammon
[1:13:39] okay
[1:13:41] so i'm just going to drink a bit of
[1:13:42] water
[1:13:45] so now andy
[1:13:47] ben prays and he prays
[1:13:51] now i pray again because i feel led to
[1:13:53] pray
[1:13:54] and all of a sudden
[1:13:56] the atmosphere changed
[1:13:58] someone enters the room
[1:14:02] and and it changes
[1:14:04] and i don't care what anybody felt there
[1:14:08] i don't care if nobody got it
[1:14:12] i got it
[1:14:14] it just dropped
[1:14:16] and he said armand
[1:14:18] follow me
[1:14:21] and i started crying
[1:14:23] and i really started praying and
[1:14:25] thinking and it went to ben and it went
[1:14:27] to andy and bronwyn and and everybody
[1:14:29] just started praying and we we had an
[1:14:31] awesome time because where we were at
[1:14:34] wasn't in this realm
[1:14:38] and and i'm going to close with
[1:14:39] zacchaeus at the end because i think
[1:14:41] it's very important
[1:14:44] it says
[1:14:46] he said made hasten come down and
[1:14:48] received him joyfully
[1:14:52] he received him
[1:14:54] joyfully
[1:14:58] and then forget about the pharisees we
[1:15:00] go down into verse 8 and zacchaeus stood
[1:15:03] and now he had his moment
[1:15:05] with jesus
[1:15:07] see the pharisees had their moment with
[1:15:09] jesus
[1:15:11] they missed it
[1:15:12] because they they were in that realm
[1:15:15] the spiritual the the religious realm
[1:15:18] there i know more
[1:15:20] this man wanted to see jesus and jesus
[1:15:24] called him by name and now he's standing
[1:15:26] before god almighty and he says to god
[1:15:28] i
[1:15:30] zacchaeus
[1:15:31] students said to the lord behold lord
[1:15:34] half of my goods i gave to the poor
[1:15:36] doesn't matter they can have it all
[1:15:38] they can have that off
[1:15:40] he says and if i have taken anything
[1:15:42] from any man by a false accusation now
[1:15:45] see he was a businessman in the carnal
[1:15:48] realm
[1:15:49] now he's going to change it and he's
[1:15:50] going to give his life to god so what
[1:15:52] does he do he says anything i've done
[1:15:54] wrong
[1:15:54] i will give them four times fault
[1:15:57] back
[1:15:59] because guess what your word is more
[1:16:01] important this meeting this seeing you
[1:16:03] in my life is more important than any
[1:16:06] money transaction there is on this earth
[1:16:12] anything
[1:16:14] that's right
[1:16:15] he says i will restore it to him
[1:16:17] fourfold
[1:16:18] and jesus said unto him this day is
[1:16:20] salvation come to your house for so much
[1:16:23] as you also is a son of abraham
[1:16:26] for the son of man is come to seek those
[1:16:29] to save which was lost
[1:16:35] so i'm asking
[1:16:38] we'll pray together
[1:16:40] um and i'll close the prayer but i want
[1:16:42] to ask you
[1:16:43] are we really seeking
[1:16:46] jesus
[1:16:48] are you really looking for him in your
[1:16:50] life
[1:16:52] or are you happy where you are
[1:16:55] are you content of battling out in your
[1:16:57] mind and reading the bible a little bit
[1:17:00] and then just go don't understand it
[1:17:03] no
[1:17:04] don't get that either yet
[1:17:05] no i'll get there one day
[1:17:08] as this is how we're seeking for god
[1:17:11] or are we actually
[1:17:13] getting desperate
[1:17:14] and then when jesus walks past and
[1:17:17] something's happening in the church we
[1:17:18] don't get distracted
[1:17:20] we don't start thinking of next week
[1:17:23] when i start thinking what i'm doing
[1:17:24] after the service but when a sister
[1:17:26] starts crying and the brother starts
[1:17:29] praying and the pastor's saying close
[1:17:31] your eyes and we're praying and the
[1:17:32] spirit of god is here though you can
[1:17:35] feel it or not that doesn't declare that
[1:17:37] god is not here
[1:17:40] we don't go by these senses
[1:17:42] but then when those things happen do you
[1:17:45] change from the carnal
[1:17:47] and come into the spiritual to say lord
[1:17:50] show me
[1:17:51] show me what's going on here
[1:17:54] what am i missing i'm desperate i want
[1:17:56] you to visit my house that sister is
[1:17:58] getting blessed that brother is saying
[1:18:00] praise the lord what about me
[1:18:03] what about me
[1:18:05] i will get into a tree i will stand on
[1:18:07] the store i will shout your name out to
[1:18:09] everyone i just want to see you i want
[1:18:12] you to come down and when people are
[1:18:14] worshiping you i want to have that
[1:18:17] i don't want to miss out
[1:18:19] because the only thing is the moment
[1:18:21] those things happen satan throws in a
[1:18:24] curveball to get someone distracted and
[1:18:25] they fall for it because they're calmly
[1:18:27] minded
[1:18:28] and they can't understand where somebody
[1:18:30] is shouting and joying and everything
[1:18:32] and brother martha one they were
[1:18:33] standing here they were praying for him
[1:18:35] i'll never forget it
[1:18:36] and he stood there and he said i'm free
[1:18:39] i'm free
[1:18:41] never forget it
[1:18:43] and that man walked away here and he had
[1:18:45] a moment with god and i said to god i
[1:18:47] want that
[1:18:49] not the emotion i want that i wanted to
[1:18:52] be able to come in front of you and say
[1:18:54] lord i want to see you and you go here i
[1:18:56] am
[1:18:58] here i am not just in your business not
[1:19:00] just in your life not even here i am
[1:19:04] and i have experience with my god where
[1:19:07] i know that i know that it tied me to a
[1:19:10] place in time where god said something
[1:19:12] to me in season that changed the way i
[1:19:14] walked
[1:19:15] that changed the way i acted that
[1:19:18] changed the way i thought
[1:19:19] that changed the way that i think about
[1:19:22] other people
[1:19:23] i want that moment
[1:19:26] children we don't have much time
[1:19:30] brothers young brothers
[1:19:32] there's not much time left
[1:19:34] if i could ever tell you something a
[1:19:36] word of advice and season take a step
[1:19:39] back
[1:19:40] not in your spiritual life just take a
[1:19:42] step back
[1:19:43] because when i was your age
[1:19:45] i was running
[1:19:47] but you know how i was running
[1:19:51] right
[1:19:52] yeah
[1:19:54] god god okay well
[1:19:56] i was running like that i had tunnel
[1:19:58] vision
[1:19:59] but because i had zeal and i had energy
[1:20:02] and i had drive and i had stamina and i
[1:20:04] was young and i was eager
[1:20:06] i still ran like this
[1:20:09] i never stopped
[1:20:10] and go
[1:20:13] i didn't do it
[1:20:15] i didn't do it i was chasing this one i
[1:20:17] was chasing that girl that was the next
[1:20:19] obstacle that's the new job that's this
[1:20:21] i want this car i want that
[1:20:23] that's that's me
[1:20:25] and i was good at it
[1:20:26] and as much as i did that satan just
[1:20:28] kept flicking it there you go there you
[1:20:30] go and then i'm here and then i'm there
[1:20:32] and everything's going good
[1:20:34] but my spiritual life went
[1:20:38] because i never stopped
[1:20:40] stopped
[1:20:41] and go hold on
[1:20:44] hold on hold on hold on
[1:20:47] there must be more here amen why is
[1:20:49] brother armand getting so excited
[1:20:52] why does brother andy when he comes to
[1:20:54] the pulpit give it all
[1:20:57] why didn't he go back into the world
[1:21:01] what can i
[1:21:03] do for you lord
[1:21:04] so that i can see you
[1:21:07] in my life
[1:21:10] i have no hopes
[1:21:12] ambitions
[1:21:13] dreams
[1:21:14] and plans
[1:21:16] are laid in your hands
[1:21:20] you're going to have to have that moment
[1:21:23] because if you want to be a zacchaeus
[1:21:26] zacchaeus realized that moment
[1:21:29] he didn't miss it for nothing
[1:21:33] amen can we have the musicians please
[1:21:36] brother andy maybe can you come and sing
[1:21:38] a couple of songs for us as well or
[1:21:39] maybe just sing one song that song that
[1:21:42] i said
[1:21:44] all of my ambitions hopes and plans i
[1:21:46] surrender them into your hands
[1:21:48] hallelujah and then we'll just pray
[1:21:50] together
[1:21:51] amen
[1:22:00] is it there
[1:22:02] you just throw that one up
[1:22:04] that's in the key of d
[1:22:06] do you know that one
[1:22:08] amen let's sing jesus all for jesus and
[1:22:10] it will end in the word of prayer and
[1:22:12] brother andy can can come and close the
