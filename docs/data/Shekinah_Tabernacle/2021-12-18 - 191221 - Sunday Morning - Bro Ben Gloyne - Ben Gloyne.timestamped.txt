[54:49] uh verses 1 to 3 three says uh
[54:53] let not your heart be troubled
[54:55] you believe in god live also in me and
[54:58] my father's house are many mansions if
[55:00] we're not so i would have told you i go
[55:03] to prepare a place for you and if i go
[55:05] and prepare a place for you i will come
[55:07] again and receive you unto myself that
[55:09] where i am there ye may be also
[55:13] i pray that scripture means more to you
[55:15] every day
[55:16] the reality of it will just anchor into
[55:17] your soul we go to first thessalonians 4
[55:19] and 13.
[55:23] and we're going to read down
[55:24] through down to uh chapter 5 and verse 9
[55:28] so a bit of a lengthy reading but i just
[55:30] used bear with me here he says but i
[55:32] would not have you to be ignorant
[55:34] brethren concerning them which are
[55:36] asleep that ye sorrow not even as others
[55:39] which have no hope for if we believe
[55:41] that jesus died and rose again
[55:44] even
[55:45] so them also which sleep in jesus will
[55:47] god bring with him
[55:49] for this we say unto you by the word of
[55:51] the lord that we which are alive and
[55:52] remain unto the coming of the lord shall
[55:54] not prevent them which are asleep
[55:56] for the lord himself shall descend from
[55:58] heaven with a shout with the voice of
[56:00] the archangel with the trump of god and
[56:01] the dead in christ shall rise first then
[56:04] we which are alive and remain shall be
[56:05] caught up together with them in the
[56:07] clouds to meet the lord in the year so
[56:10] and and so shall we ever be with the
[56:12] lord wherefore comfort one another with
[56:14] these words now we know that the chapter
[56:16] and verse was put in after this was
[56:18] written you know paul didn't put chapter
[56:19] and verse and so chapter five is a
[56:21] continuation of chapter four okay so he
[56:23] says but of the times and seasons
[56:26] brethren ye have no need that i write
[56:28] unto you for yourselves know perfectly
[56:30] that the day of the lord so cometh as a
[56:32] thief in the night for when they shall
[56:34] say peace and safety then sudden
[56:37] destruction cometh upon them so as
[56:39] travail upon a woman with child and they
[56:42] shall not escape but ye brethren are not
[56:45] in darkness
[56:46] hey he's talking about you and i right
[56:48] there
[56:49] that that they should overtake you as a
[56:51] thief so that should take all fear away
[56:54] right ye are all children of light and
[56:56] the children of the day we are not of
[56:58] the night nor of darkness therefore let
[57:00] us not
[57:02] sleep as do others but let us watch and
[57:04] be sober for they that sleep sleep in
[57:06] the night and they that be drunken are
[57:08] drunken in the night but let us who are
[57:11] of the day be sober putting on the
[57:12] breastplate of faith and love and for a
[57:15] helmet the hope of salvation for god
[57:18] hath not appointed us to wrath but to
[57:20] obtain salvation by
[57:22] our lord jesus christ

[59:16] on on tuesday uh evening uh for our
[59:19] family ultra family prayer time we just
[59:21] put on brother freddie's service
[59:23] there and um and he he mentioned the uh
[59:26] armor company story now i'm just going
[59:28] to go through this and um where where he
[59:30] said that the you know the story of the
[59:32] armor company is you know it's like a
[59:34] cinderella story you know dwight moody
[59:36] was the first one to to to speak it but
[59:38] brother brown really really made it live
[59:39] because it speaks to the hour in which
[59:40] we live and um and so in the armor
[59:43] company story there was a there was a
[59:44] girl that lost her parents she had to go
[59:46] live on a ranch with her cousins and she
[59:48] was you know you know with her uncle and
[59:50] auntie and she was mistreated she had to
[59:52] do all the work she had to you know she
[59:53] was basically a slave for them and that
[59:55] was her portion in life and it was a big
[59:57] ranch and and the owner of the ranch the
[59:59] son of the owner of the ranch was a very
[1:00:01] wealthy man and he came from chicago
[1:00:03] came to this ranch to inspect the whole
[1:00:05] place and he would you know be looking
[1:00:06] around and and so the cousins of this
[1:00:09] girl who was basically their slave
[1:00:11] decided that one of us is going to marry
[1:00:13] this man we're gonna we're gonna we're
[1:00:14] gonna you know we're gonna we're gonna
[1:00:16] get a snag i'm gonna grab him we're
[1:00:18] gonna flutter our eyes and he's gonna
[1:00:19] fall and it's gonna the rest is history
[1:00:21] and uh but but this man he was a young
[1:00:24] man who was eligible aged to be married
[1:00:25] but you know everything they tried to do
[1:00:27] to impress him just just it was like
[1:00:29] water on a duck's back i mean off a
[1:00:31] duck's back because he was looking for
[1:00:33] character and you know they would put on
[1:00:34] parties they'd put on you know barn
[1:00:36] dances all these different kind of
[1:00:37] things to try and impress him but you
[1:00:39] know
[1:00:40] that wasn't what he was looking for and
[1:00:42] now this the story represents us and the
[1:00:44] lord jesus christ yo but but he was
[1:00:46] looking as he was there on his father's
[1:00:48] business inspecting the ranch and things
[1:00:50] that wasn't really the thing on his
[1:00:51] heart he was looking for a wife he was
[1:00:53] looking for a part of himself he was
[1:00:55] looking for a woman that expressed his
[1:00:56] heart
[1:00:57] and so he one night you know he you know
[1:00:59] you know he noticed this cousin in the
[1:01:00] background always working doing
[1:01:02] different things and you know one night
[1:01:04] you know he yo he he he somehow escaped
[1:01:06] the dance and he went out you know out
[1:01:08] the back and she was there cleaning up
[1:01:10] after the meal and she was tipping the
[1:01:12] dishwater over the sink and i mean i
[1:01:14] mean i mean over the fence and you know
[1:01:15] he he began to introduce uh uh himself
[1:01:19] to her and and he said you know i'm out
[1:01:22] here and i'm looking at my father's you
[1:01:23] know ranch and all these things i'm
[1:01:24] really looking for a wife
[1:01:26] and he he basically he said you know
[1:01:29] i've noticed you around
[1:01:31] i noticed you're a real woman i'm not
[1:01:33] looking for this dressed up fandangle
[1:01:34] things i'm looking for a character
[1:01:36] and you know she was so embarrassed you
[1:01:38] know remember the first time the lord
[1:01:39] ever came near you
[1:01:41] you know you felt about yay big and my
[1:01:43] fingers are touching together you know
[1:01:44] you felt this big you felt so unworthy
[1:01:47] but he was looking beyond how you
[1:01:48] thought about you he was looking at that
[1:01:50] predecessor on the inside of you amen
[1:01:53] and he saw part of himself in you that's
[1:01:55] deeper than your character then your
[1:01:57] facial expressions and your whatever you
[1:01:59] are deeper than that he was you know he
[1:02:01] saw that part of himself and and he said
[1:02:04] to her will you marry me
[1:02:07] and she was so shocked by the proposal
[1:02:09] but yet of course she said yes
[1:02:11] and he would tell he would tell her in a
[1:02:14] year
[1:02:15] in a year's time from this day
[1:02:18] i will come and we'll get married on
[1:02:20] these grounds and i'll take you back to
[1:02:22] chicago i've got a big castle there you
[1:02:24] won't have to worry about washing dishes
[1:02:26] nothing you're just going to be my queen
[1:02:29] so as as brother freddie was was was
[1:02:32] mentioning this
[1:02:33] it came to the it it anchored down to my
[1:02:36] heart
[1:02:37] in a year's time from this day
[1:02:39] means the same season that they're in
[1:02:41] will come back again
[1:02:43] now we're living in a tremendous hour
[1:02:46] this is the greatest time to be alive i
[1:02:49] pray with all of my heart that you are
[1:02:51] not asleep in this day
[1:02:53] yet you are not just floating about in
[1:02:55] life as the apostle paul would say let
[1:02:57] us not sleep as either of the night
[1:02:59] right let us not be asleep but let us be
[1:03:02] awakened
[1:03:03] i mean to the season that we're alive
[1:03:06] and now she
[1:03:08] can you imagine
[1:03:10] the day before even on that very morning
[1:03:13] she got out of her bed
[1:03:15] maybe she was very upset with her a lot
[1:03:17] in life but she decided i've just got to
[1:03:19] persevere and maybe she had no idea how
[1:03:21] she was going to escape this kind of a
[1:03:23] life she had no idea what her future
[1:03:24] would be she thought i'm just stuck here
[1:03:26] and i've got to put up with my cousins
[1:03:28] and do just just do the best i could
[1:03:31] but that evening changed
[1:03:33] amen a few words from him
[1:03:35] and a proposal
[1:03:37] changed her whole life and you remember
[1:03:40] when the lord you know you know he came
[1:03:42] and he and he proposed to you and he put
[1:03:44] his love kiss on your heart took all
[1:03:45] your sin away and he gave you the
[1:03:47] promise i'm coming back for you
[1:03:49] i mean it's not someone else's promise
[1:03:51] it's your promise i mean it's not that
[1:03:53] someone else is excited as you're
[1:03:55] excited by it hallelujah and the very
[1:03:58] next morning
[1:03:59] she woke up in the same bed
[1:04:01] facing the same chores facing the same
[1:04:04] life facing the same critical cousins
[1:04:07] and problems and whatever same dishes
[1:04:10] same choice same laundry same sweeping
[1:04:14] same whatever she had to do ex but in
[1:04:16] her heart was burning a flame
[1:04:18] now she had purpose now she had vision
[1:04:21] now she had focus i mean now she had a
[1:04:24] burden now she had love in her heart i
[1:04:26] mean now she had a longing and she was
[1:04:28] looking for when the season would return
[1:04:30] back around because when the season came
[1:04:32] back around now she would recognize it's
[1:04:34] been a year's time and he's coming back
[1:04:36] for me
[1:04:37] hallelujah so you know same problems
[1:04:40] same you know the cousins would have
[1:04:42] said the same things to her same
[1:04:43] condescending looks you know we all
[1:04:45] actually need critics
[1:04:48] you know every prophet in the bible had
[1:04:49] a critic
[1:04:50] jesus had a lot of critics the apostle
[1:04:53] paul had critics i mean his critics
[1:04:55] followed him i mean from city to city
[1:04:57] hallelujah and that's how we have you
[1:04:59] know that's a good sign you're on the
[1:05:01] lord's side if you've got critics amen
[1:05:03] if if they persecute you for the word
[1:05:06] sake i mean i'd say you should actually
[1:05:08] praise praise the lord hallelujah it's
[1:05:10] good to have critics that's not easy but
[1:05:12] it's good
[1:05:13] i mean so she would
[1:05:15] suffer the same verbal abuse day after
[1:05:17] day amen yo but but as she was watching
[1:05:20] the seasons change he realized it's
[1:05:22] getting closer
[1:05:24] but there's a repeat of the season so
[1:05:27] for example if i stood here in a year's
[1:05:29] time
[1:05:30] we would probably be talking about how
[1:05:32] much rain we've just had because it
[1:05:33] rains a lot in december you know
[1:05:35] christmas i don't know why it goes on
[1:05:37] the news but people talk is it going to
[1:05:39] rain this christmas odds are it is
[1:05:41] because in a lot of places it rains it's
[1:05:42] new zealand it's well summer well i
[1:05:45] don't think it gets the memo eventually
[1:05:47] it does but it goes autumn but anyway
[1:05:48] but but in a year's time
[1:05:50] the season will be the same
[1:05:52] we won't be in winter
[1:05:54] right so the same conditions will be
[1:05:56] here
[1:05:57] as this will be the same season again
[1:06:00] now
[1:06:02] we have to look at the first oh well
[1:06:04] first i've got to lay these things out
[1:06:05] jesus when he was here on earth he spoke
[1:06:08] more of his second coming than his first
[1:06:10] and brother bam says what a tremendous
[1:06:12] time that we're in for
[1:06:15] he would he would be asked by his
[1:06:16] disciples
[1:06:18] when is going to be the destruction of
[1:06:20] the temple this is matthew 24 i'm just
[1:06:22] i'm just kind of paraphrasing here um
[1:06:25] quickly but i just want to lay this kind
[1:06:27] of foundation because people say oh we
[1:06:29] shouldn't look for signs but
[1:06:31] jesus said we'll be given signs
[1:06:33] there's a season
[1:06:35] there's a season of a change
[1:06:37] and
[1:06:38] and so jesus would be asking matthew 24
[1:06:42] when is going to be the destruction of
[1:06:43] the temple in jerusalem the sign of thy
[1:06:46] coming and the end of the world and he
[1:06:47] answers that matthew 24 and 25.
[1:06:50] and he would come down and to and you
[1:06:52] know we realized just finally reading
[1:06:54] that chapter
[1:06:55] he says you'll see pestilence we have
[1:06:58] pestilence that's epidemics
[1:07:00] right we're living in one amen
[1:07:03] there'll be wars there'll be famines
[1:07:04] there'll be earthquakes
[1:07:06] you know and there are earthquakes even
[1:07:09] right now under the kapiti coast there's
[1:07:11] a slow earthquake going on and it's
[1:07:12] going to go on for months apparently
[1:07:15] you know well we're on the shaky isles
[1:07:16] if you came for a place of stability
[1:07:18] physically you're in the wrong country
[1:07:21] right but if you want if you want
[1:07:22] stability spiritually you've come to the
[1:07:24] right place i mean the word of the lord
[1:07:26] hallelujah amen so hey so we've had
[1:07:29] earthquakes we've got pestilence we've
[1:07:31] had all those things
[1:07:32] wars and rumors you know i find it quite
[1:07:34] amazing when when i think the defeats
[1:07:36] minister of taiwan is is saying china
[1:07:39] won't invade us till 2025.
[1:07:42] this is world news
[1:07:43] this is what they're expecting
[1:07:45] because the world has to come to
[1:07:47] armageddon the world has to come to a
[1:07:49] great tribulation it's prophesied i mean
[1:07:52] we could have the best politicians that
[1:07:54] are actually honest in every country in
[1:07:55] every world you know you know every
[1:07:57] place it won't help it the world is
[1:07:59] predestined to fall apart it's ordained
[1:08:01] to fall apart that's why there's strife
[1:08:03] and trouble and but you've got to be
[1:08:05] careful what you rally around and and
[1:08:07] we'll get into that soon but then jesus
[1:08:09] would say
[1:08:10] now learn the parable of the fig tree
[1:08:13] when its branches is yet tender and
[1:08:15] putteth forth leaves you know that
[1:08:17] summer is nigh now we know in the
[1:08:19] scripture that the figs or the fig tree
[1:08:21] represents israel so it says when you
[1:08:23] see israel become a nation again you
[1:08:25] know summer is now what's going to
[1:08:26] happen another season is coming
[1:08:29] right so likewise ye when you shall see
[1:08:31] all these things know that it is near
[1:08:33] even at the doors verily i say unto you
[1:08:35] this generation shall not pass so all
[1:08:37] these things be fulfilled heaven and
[1:08:39] earth shall pass away but my word shall
[1:08:41] not pass away but of that day and hour
[1:08:44] no man knoweth no not the angels of
[1:08:46] heaven but my father only but then he
[1:08:47] begins to go into parables
[1:08:49] he reaches back into the scripture and
[1:08:51] he identifies the conditions in certain
[1:08:53] ages and says when you see these
[1:08:55] conditions here again you know this is
[1:08:57] what's going to happen now the first
[1:08:59] evidence is when you see israel become a
[1:09:01] nation again and they have become a
[1:09:03] nation for the first time in over two
[1:09:05] thousand years they are a sovereign
[1:09:06] nation in
[1:09:07] 1946 or 48 whichever one that you know
[1:09:10] that's a very important landmark in the
[1:09:12] calendar
[1:09:14] it's a very important landmark in the
[1:09:15] calendar right so god is saying now that
[1:09:18] when you see this you know the summer is
[1:09:20] nigh the millennium is going to grow
[1:09:21] along
[1:09:22] but before that there has to be a
[1:09:24] rapture of a bride
[1:09:25] now we're going to just just just just i
[1:09:28] just trust you just stay with me
[1:09:30] goodness
[1:09:31] okay but of the days of but as the days
[1:09:34] of noah were so shall the coming of the
[1:09:35] son of man be and for as in the days
[1:09:38] that were before the flood they were
[1:09:40] eating they were drinking they are
[1:09:42] marrying and given a marriage until the
[1:09:44] day that noah entered into the ark and
[1:09:46] then you not until the flood came and
[1:09:47] took them all away so shall also the
[1:09:50] coming of the son of man be so life will
[1:09:52] just go on
[1:09:54] there's not going to be a great
[1:09:55] awakening of a whole world saying jesus
[1:09:57] is coming no he'll come like a thief in
[1:09:59] the night
[1:10:00] and a good thief doesn't leave any
[1:10:02] evidence
[1:10:03] they go and they get what they want they
[1:10:05] get out oh lord if i can put it this way
[1:10:07] he's a very good thief
[1:10:09] he he doesn't bumble around
[1:10:11] he does it very
[1:10:13] you know he has a plan he manifests his
[1:10:15] plan
[1:10:16] so he comes in reveals himself to you
[1:10:18] gets you ready get and get you out at
[1:10:20] the appointed time
[1:10:23] so
[1:10:24] if we want to look at when the season
[1:10:25] comes back around again we need to look
[1:10:27] at what it was if i could say
[1:10:29] if i could put it this way what was
[1:10:31] summer like a year ago
[1:10:33] right so what was the time like when the
[1:10:35] lord jesus was here the first time
[1:10:38] remember because there's been a promise
[1:10:40] for 2000 years down through the ages and
[1:10:42] we need to look because remember it's
[1:10:44] not just asking going to be raptured the
[1:10:46] believers down through seven church ages
[1:10:48] are going to come forth
[1:10:49] amen so we need to see what was the
[1:10:52] summer the summer like the first time
[1:10:54] and then we'll see are we living in that
[1:10:56] same time again
[1:10:58] hallelujah
[1:11:00] amen so if we look at when the lord was
[1:11:02] here the first time
[1:11:03] we need to see that you know
[1:11:06] um
[1:11:08] i have it here yes so
[1:11:10] the lord was born in a manger
[1:11:12] we understand that now we know that in
[1:11:14] this season he will not be physically
[1:11:15] born that way because he does not need
[1:11:17] to come back and purchase the salvation
[1:11:19] of the world
[1:11:20] right but he'll be born in a bride
[1:11:22] right veiled behind human flesh once
[1:11:24] again
[1:11:25] now
[1:11:26] our lord jesus after he was born he was
[1:11:29] baptized by john who was the forerunner
[1:11:31] right and when he was baptized the
[1:11:33] fullness of the spirit of god came and
[1:11:34] dwelt in him for it says in colossians
[1:11:36] two and nine freedom dwelleth all the
[1:11:38] fullness of the god here bodily so he's
[1:11:40] not just part of the godhead all the god
[1:11:42] he was in him all that god is was poured
[1:11:44] into christ
[1:11:45] amen it says in luke 4 1 the first part
[1:11:48] of that verse after he was baptized and
[1:11:49] jesus being full of the holy ghost
[1:11:51] returned from jordan and then the spirit
[1:11:53] led him into the wilderness so now then
[1:11:55] jesus enters into his ministry so i'm
[1:11:57] just giving you conditions of last year
[1:12:00] spiritually and look at the repeat right
[1:12:02] because when you see in a year's time
[1:12:05] see to me when brother brown lays out
[1:12:07] stories he's actually telling parables
[1:12:09] he's not just giving things oh that's a
[1:12:11] nice idea a nice story no he's actually
[1:12:13] laying just like jesus would preach
[1:12:14] parable form and there's deep truth in
[1:12:17] them i mean i pray by the power of god
[1:12:19] that we would see where we are because
[1:12:22] can you imagine
[1:12:24] she's been suffering nearly a year of
[1:12:26] abuse by her cousins in her heart
[1:12:28] i'm going to get married and she gets
[1:12:30] the wedding garment
[1:12:32] she gets the wedding dress and she puts
[1:12:34] it on
[1:12:35] and it fits just right
[1:12:37] maybe maybe every solvent should get out
[1:12:39] of the cupboard put it on put now we
[1:12:41] know the wedding garment is the baptism
[1:12:43] of the holy ghost and we don't put it on
[1:12:45] and put it off we just but i'm just
[1:12:46] using this as an illustration so imagine
[1:12:49] how excited she would be just imagine he
[1:12:51] came and spoke to her in summertime
[1:12:53] where she sees spring
[1:12:55] there's the cold winter months you know
[1:12:57] there's the dark ages it was a cold time
[1:12:59] a lot of winter formality and dead just
[1:13:02] just flowing into the church but then
[1:13:03] but then a spring time began to come a
[1:13:06] reformation began to come and she'd look
[1:13:08] out and see the buds coming on all the
[1:13:10] trees and you know that would make her
[1:13:11] excited
[1:13:12] because to me winter's a long time
[1:13:14] i'm not a fan
[1:13:16] i know we need it but i look forward to
[1:13:18] winners done you know and then summer to
[1:13:20] me is too short you know but you know
[1:13:21] it's yeah it's here and it's gone but
[1:13:23] winter's like it's here and
[1:13:25] are we done yet you know kind of
[1:13:26] counting down days and you know
[1:13:29] so maybe she was like that
[1:13:31] and then and then she saw the buds come
[1:13:33] on the trees
[1:13:34] they would have put a renewed spring in
[1:13:36] her step
[1:13:37] hallelujah
[1:13:39] i mean the long winter's over the spring
[1:13:41] is care not just coming it's here i mean
[1:13:44] that's mean summer's gonna roll on real
[1:13:46] soon
[1:13:46] hallelujah
[1:13:48] so
[1:13:48] it would have made her real excited
[1:13:51] hallelujah these things should make us
[1:13:53] excited too
[1:13:54] amen so jesus enters into his ministry
[1:13:58] and then he goes into you know after the
[1:14:00] temptation in the wilderness by the
[1:14:01] devil he goes into the synagogue there
[1:14:04] and there in nazareth where he was
[1:14:05] brought up and as his custom was he went
[1:14:07] to church
[1:14:08] and um he went to the synagogue and and
[1:14:11] he stood up to read
[1:14:12] and and the book of isaiah was given to
[1:14:15] him
[1:14:15] and he looked in there and he found the
[1:14:17] portion of scripture
[1:14:18] where it said the spirit of the lord is
[1:14:20] upon me because he has anointed me to
[1:14:22] preach the gospel to the poor he has
[1:14:24] sent me to heal the brokenhearted to
[1:14:26] preach deliverance to the captives and
[1:14:27] the recovering of the sight to the blind
[1:14:29] to set at liberty them that are bruised
[1:14:31] to preach the acceptable year of the
[1:14:33] lord and he closed the book and gave it
[1:14:35] again to the minister and sat down and
[1:14:37] the eyes of all them that were in the
[1:14:39] synagogue were fasted on him and he
[1:14:41] began to sound to them this day
[1:14:43] is this scripture fulfilled in your ass
[1:14:46] hallelujah so and then and then what
[1:14:48] happened after that what he read saying
[1:14:50] this is the fulfillment of prophecy then
[1:14:53] it began to be manifested in front of
[1:14:54] them amen demons were cast out
[1:14:57] healing took place the dead were raised
[1:15:00] amen the mysteries of the kingdom were
[1:15:02] made known amen the hypocrisy of the
[1:15:04] religious systems was exposed amen
[1:15:07] nature came under its rightful master
[1:15:09] when he spoke to the winds and waves
[1:15:11] hallelujah so was we know he was not
[1:15:13] just part of the godhead that was god
[1:15:16] manifested in the flesh as the apostle
[1:15:18] paul would say and without controversy
[1:15:20] great is a mystery of godliness god was
[1:15:23] manifested in the flesh justified in the
[1:15:25] spirit scene of angels preached unto the
[1:15:27] gentiles believed on in the world
[1:15:28] received up into glory
[1:15:30] halluci is a great
[1:15:32] powerful manifestation of the spirit of
[1:15:34] god i mean where people who were lost in
[1:15:37] sin came and found salvation people were
[1:15:39] stuck in their old lives they couldn't
[1:15:41] get out like the woman at the well she
[1:15:42] got out and the only way she got out of
[1:15:45] that rut is because she met the son of
[1:15:46] man amen and he revealed to her the
[1:15:49] secrets of her hearts because when when
[1:15:51] when they were talking jesus would say
[1:15:53] to her you know go get your husband
[1:15:56] and but then but then she said i don't
[1:15:58] have one and he said to her you've said
[1:16:00] right you've had five and the one you're
[1:16:01] with is not yours i mean i mean you're
[1:16:03] not even married and then so she was so
[1:16:05] shocked she said we know where messiah
[1:16:07] cometh he'll do these things so what was
[1:16:09] he doing he's doing the sign of the
[1:16:10] messiah
[1:16:12] revealing what was in them in many
[1:16:13] places in the gospels it would say and
[1:16:15] jesus knew their thoughts
[1:16:17] hallelujah
[1:16:18] and then and then she she was just told
[1:16:21] by him he that speaks to the am he
[1:16:24] and then she dropped her water pot ran
[1:16:26] into the city said come see a man that
[1:16:28] told me everything ever done is this not
[1:16:29] the very messiah
[1:16:31] hallelujah
[1:16:32] amen but then also in that season
[1:16:35] there was there was there was a time of
[1:16:38] great rejection
[1:16:40] not just by the pharisees sadducees and
[1:16:43] the and the scribes
[1:16:45] but it was also by people who walked
[1:16:46] with him
[1:16:47] the 70 followed him no more when you
[1:16:50] begin to say unless you eat my flesh and
[1:16:51] drink drink my blood you don't have you
[1:16:53] have no part of me he didn't explain it
[1:16:55] he didn't have an apologetics ministry
[1:16:57] nothing wrong with those things but you
[1:16:58] know he just he just laid it out there
[1:17:01] and they said this is a hard saying who
[1:17:02] can hear it and you know they just went
[1:17:04] on you know and and and he was also not
[1:17:06] only that but he was betrayed by judas
[1:17:08] the traitor who was one of the one of
[1:17:11] the ministering brothers who was with
[1:17:12] him one of the disciples
[1:17:15] and they would eventually and in the
[1:17:17] pressure of the churches of that day
[1:17:19] were they they told the people if you
[1:17:21] attend his revival you're not welcome in
[1:17:24] the synagogue no more
[1:17:26] and they'll be kicked out eventually he
[1:17:28] was betrayed by judas as i said and then
[1:17:30] crucif and then then they crucified the
[1:17:32] very lord of glory the very messiah that
[1:17:35] they were supposedly looking for
[1:17:37] but this did not stop him this actually
[1:17:40] gave the greatest triumph that had ever
[1:17:42] happened
[1:17:43] how they were jesus when he was
[1:17:44] crucified he didn't stay dead
[1:17:46] i mean his body may have been lifeless
[1:17:48] but he was down in hell conquering i
[1:17:51] mean he went and preached to the souls
[1:17:52] in prison amen because remember he just
[1:17:54] purchased the whole world he had
[1:17:56] purchased our salvation he took the
[1:17:59] nails from me
[1:18:00] hallelujah and so when when his body was
[1:18:03] put into the tomb he went down and
[1:18:05] preached his souls in prison saying the
[1:18:07] one that noah said was coming i'm here
[1:18:09] holy he began to preach him then he went
[1:18:11] and he went into paradise he didn't
[1:18:13] begin to speak to abraham isaac and
[1:18:14] jacob and you know you know joseph and
[1:18:17] you know all the prophets down through
[1:18:18] the ages and then they began to just
[1:18:20] have a jubilee because they were looking
[1:18:22] for him to come and then now he was
[1:18:24] right there hallelujah and he emptied
[1:18:26] out paradise hallelujah led them and
[1:18:28] they ascended on high
[1:18:30] and then also he went down to hell now i
[1:18:32] may have got the order of those things
[1:18:33] around the wrong way but you know the
[1:18:35] story don't you he went down to hell
[1:18:38] amen and then satan said finally i've
[1:18:39] got you now i thought i had you when i
[1:18:41] had abel thought i had you when i had
[1:18:43] moses different ones thought i had you
[1:18:44] when i had john the baptist head chopped
[1:18:47] off but now i've got you
[1:18:48] then just jesus said satan my blood is
[1:18:51] on the cross still fresh i have redeemed
[1:18:53] adam's fallen race i mean you have no
[1:18:55] power no more give me the keys of hell
[1:18:56] death and the grave holy grand office
[1:18:59] side boot him back down to hell ascended
[1:19:01] triumphant
[1:19:03] hallelujah so in this time of great
[1:19:05] rejection and crucifixion there was a
[1:19:07] resurrection taking place
[1:19:10] so it was the greatest and and his
[1:19:12] resurrection sealed his messiahship
[1:19:15] because there had been many great
[1:19:16] prophets on the earth but none had
[1:19:18] resurrected
[1:19:19] i mean none had ever ever said the words
[1:19:22] i lay my life down and i'll pick it back
[1:19:24] up again
[1:19:25] holy so he didn't just say what he was
[1:19:27] he proved what he was
[1:19:29] so there was a great
[1:19:30] resurrection time now that was the first
[1:19:33] season that was a year ago
[1:19:35] what about in a year's time
[1:19:38] because the same god said he'd do the
[1:19:40] same things in the end time to reveal
[1:19:43] himself to a bride around the world that
[1:19:45] she would know this is the time of
[1:19:47] translation this is the time of the
[1:19:50] rapture i mean so what have we had we've
[1:19:52] had a forerunner come we've had john the
[1:19:54] yeah you're having a prophet with the
[1:19:57] spirit of elijah upon him
[1:19:58] i meant to forerun jesus christ i mean
[1:20:01] to introduce the people to the word not
[1:20:03] to a church do you know the worst my i
[1:20:06] don't want anyone to be introduced to
[1:20:08] your kind of tabernacle
[1:20:10] oh the i come to this church forget that
[1:20:12] that's not going to take change you that
[1:20:14] that your body goes from here to heaven
[1:20:16] amen don't be associated with the church
[1:20:18] be associated with jesus christ if you
[1:20:20] know him you can go anywhere and you
[1:20:23] still you'll be fine
[1:20:24] righteous not oh i'm trusting in the
[1:20:26] church you'll see me through no i'm
[1:20:28] sorry this church won't see you through
[1:20:29] i mean he will see you through i mean
[1:20:32] he'll stick he'll stick closer to you
[1:20:33] than a brother than your friend than
[1:20:34] your mother than your father i mean you
[1:20:36] become one with the word
[1:20:38] don't fall in love with me there's only
[1:20:40] one woman allowed to do that and we're
[1:20:41] married hallelujah
[1:20:43] you know don't fall in love with my
[1:20:44] personality who i don't forget that you
[1:20:46] know i heard ron spencer say it once and
[1:20:48] i agree he said i wish i just a curtain
[1:20:49] was pulled around me and and my voice
[1:20:51] was changed when i preached i thought
[1:20:53] how true that should be
[1:20:54] amen but yeah so we're going to become
[1:20:56] one with the lord amen amen and so now
[1:21:00] so we've had a forerunner come
[1:21:02] and then and then
[1:21:04] church history says when his ministry
[1:21:06] went worldwide pentecost was at a low
[1:21:09] ebb
[1:21:10] and and historians who don't even agree
[1:21:12] with what he thought said william
[1:21:13] brown's ministry initiated the
[1:21:15] post-world war ii healing revival and
[1:21:17] you go look at that time of history it
[1:21:19] just exploded the supernatural exploded
[1:21:22] upon the earth like never before why
[1:21:25] because god sent elijah to turn the
[1:21:27] hearts of the people back to the
[1:21:29] apostolic faith i mean so what happened
[1:21:32] the dead were raised
[1:21:34] you know christine and i were standing
[1:21:35] brother ernie there in um um in in cape
[1:21:38] town we were we were there 2019 we were
[1:21:41] standing outside this hall in south
[1:21:43] africa so so i mean i mean in cape town
[1:21:45] which is in south africa so so there's
[1:21:47] the town hall there and then next to it
[1:21:50] is it's i think it's now a library but
[1:21:51] it was called the drill hall
[1:21:53] and then behind you on the other side of
[1:21:54] the street is just a big open field and
[1:21:56] then not far from that is the um castle
[1:21:59] of good hope or whatever it's called
[1:22:00] there and so we were standing there and
[1:22:02] so we're standing with the pastor the
[1:22:04] church here brother dale and and brother
[1:22:06] ernie and um and his you know and their
[1:22:08] wives and and and he began to tell the
[1:22:10] story about how they were having a house
[1:22:12] meeting uh a few years back and there
[1:22:14] was this old lady sitting in this house
[1:22:16] meeting half asleep and and brother dale
[1:22:19] is is introducing the prophet to the
[1:22:21] people and she perked up and said i know
[1:22:23] who william branham is
[1:22:25] and and he thought you know this is just
[1:22:27] she's just an old lady what does she
[1:22:28] know and she said yeah when i was a
[1:22:30] teenager i was standing in his meeting
[1:22:33] here in cape town
[1:22:35] when i was a teenager and and she began
[1:22:37] to describe the scene you can read it in
[1:22:39] the book you can see the photos of it
[1:22:40] say we couldn't get into the hall where
[1:22:42] he was preaching we're on the outside
[1:22:44] and there were thousands of us there
[1:22:46] and and and she said you know those
[1:22:48] people you know
[1:22:49] we gathered real early and there are
[1:22:51] other people preaching but then all we
[1:22:53] heard brother brown say was
[1:22:55] good evening friends
[1:22:57] and as soon as he said that she said
[1:22:59] pandemonium broke out because the spirit
[1:23:01] of god fell upon everyone and people
[1:23:03] just got out of their wheelchairs
[1:23:05] dropped their crutches got out of their
[1:23:07] cots it's just a spontaneous mass
[1:23:09] healing
[1:23:10] amen came there and we know durbin
[1:23:12] racecourse was even greater than that
[1:23:14] and that wasn't just one isolated thing
[1:23:15] that was all around the world wherever
[1:23:17] he went because what what happened
[1:23:18] demons were cast out i mean healing took
[1:23:20] place the dead were raised nature amen
[1:23:23] had to obey his voice creation happened
[1:23:26] the mysteries of the kingdom were
[1:23:27] revealed
[1:23:29] hallelujah the supernatural took place
[1:23:31] on such a great magnitude for the for
[1:23:34] god to get our attention bible days are
[1:23:36] here again that's what people say bible
[1:23:38] days are here again holy what's
[1:23:40] happening the season had come back
[1:23:41] around again now but i just want to say
[1:23:43] this the season has not ended
[1:23:46] amen because remember there's been
[1:23:47] rejection amen there's been crucifixion
[1:23:50] i turned 33 and someone said good now we
[1:23:53] can crucify him
[1:23:54] and we all know what happened there
[1:23:56] but you see the word has to be crucified
[1:24:00] the word had to be because remember
[1:24:01] moses
[1:24:02] when moses was commanded to speak to the
[1:24:05] rock
[1:24:06] i think i have it here
[1:24:09] he gets he gets angry at god
[1:24:12] i know so he gets angry at the
[1:24:15] he says you bunch of rebels it's an it's
[1:24:18] a numbers chapter 20 i believe
[1:24:21] if i can find it maybe i can't find it
[1:24:22] that's why i've but he says you bunch of
[1:24:24] rebels do i really have to let's find it
[1:24:26] here numbers 20.
[1:24:46] and we will read from verse 9 but but
[1:24:48] let's just go actually we need to
[1:24:51] so verse 7 and the lord spake unto moses
[1:24:54] saying take the rod and gather thou the
[1:24:56] assembly together thou and aaron my
[1:24:57] brother and speak ye unto the rock
[1:25:00] before your eyes
[1:25:01] pardon me and it shall give forth as
[1:25:03] water and thou shalt bring forth to them
[1:25:06] water out of the rock so thou shalt give
[1:25:08] the congregation and their beast drink
[1:25:12] now let's just drop down to oh let's
[1:25:15] just keep reading and moses took the rod
[1:25:16] from before the lord as he as he
[1:25:19] commanded him
[1:25:20] and moses and aaron gathered the
[1:25:21] congregation together before the rock
[1:25:24] and he said unto them here now ye rebels
[1:25:26] must we fetch ye water out of this rock
[1:25:29] and moses lifted up his hand
[1:25:32] and with his rod he smoked the rock he
[1:25:34] smote the rock twice and the water came
[1:25:36] out abundantly and the congregation
[1:25:38] drank and their beasts also and the lord
[1:25:40] said unto moses and aaron because you
[1:25:42] believe me not to sanctify me in the
[1:25:43] eyes of the children of israel therefore
[1:25:45] you shall not bring this congregation
[1:25:47] into the land which i have given them
[1:25:50] so the whole pattern of the scripture
[1:25:53] was broken there
[1:25:55] because gee well up to this point anyway
[1:25:57] because jesus was the rock was christ we
[1:26:00] know and he was only meant to be smitten
[1:26:02] once on calvary
[1:26:04] right but i was actually speaking of
[1:26:06] there'll be two crucifixions because the
[1:26:08] rock will be smitten twice
[1:26:10] and that's that was when jesus was
[1:26:12] physically crucified but now he's not
[1:26:14] here in that physical form so how do you
[1:26:16] crucify the lord now you kill his
[1:26:19] effects of him of his word upon the
[1:26:21] people
[1:26:22] that's how you crucify him you count
[1:26:24] that him being an unclean spirit it's
[1:26:28] the devil working have nothing to do
[1:26:29] with it just like in the first first one
[1:26:32] don't go hear his meetings he's
[1:26:33] beelzebub have nothing to do with this
[1:26:35] then they physically crucified him right
[1:26:38] but you can't kill him physically
[1:26:39] because he's
[1:26:41] his body's not here right but you can
[1:26:43] kill the effects of his spirit upon the
[1:26:45] people which is exactly what's happened
[1:26:47] again in this end time but i want you to
[1:26:49] know that
[1:26:50] that was actually the greatest thing
[1:26:52] that could happen
[1:26:54] do you think that's a terrible thing but
[1:26:55] it's actually a great thing because it
[1:26:57] brought about a resurrection
[1:26:59] are you following me amen it brought
[1:27:01] about a resurrection now we're living in
[1:27:04] a season where i said we have come back
[1:27:06] a year
[1:27:07] right so the same thing has happened
[1:27:08] again there's been a crucifixion
[1:27:11] right
[1:27:12] but then now there is a great
[1:27:14] resurrection
[1:27:16] but let's just go back to this actually
[1:27:18] because jesus even said to the jesus
[1:27:21] even said to the scribes and pharisees
[1:27:22] when they asked them in in matthew 16 or
[1:27:26] matthew 12 to matthew 16 the pharisees
[1:27:28] also with the sadducees came and
[1:27:30] tempting
[1:27:31] and tempting desired him that he would
[1:27:33] show them a sign from heaven
[1:27:35] and he answered and said unto them when
[1:27:37] it's evening you say it will be fair
[1:27:39] weather for the sky is red and in the
[1:27:41] morning it will be foul weather today
[1:27:43] for the sky is red and lowering o
[1:27:45] hypocrites you can discern the face of
[1:27:47] the sky but you cannot discern the sign
[1:27:49] of the times a wicked and adulterous
[1:27:51] generation seeketh after a sign there
[1:27:53] shall be no sign given unto them but the
[1:27:55] sign of the prophet jonas and he left
[1:27:57] and he departed now
[1:27:59] he would he would actually explain this
[1:28:00] earlier in matthew 12 he says then
[1:28:02] certain of the scribes and pharisees
[1:28:03] answering saying master we would see a
[1:28:05] sign from thee but he answered and said
[1:28:07] unto them and an evil and adulterous
[1:28:09] generation seeketh after a sign and
[1:28:11] there shall be no sign given to it but
[1:28:14] the sign of the prophet jonas for as
[1:28:15] jonas was three days and three nights in
[1:28:18] the whale's belly so shall the son of
[1:28:20] man be three days and three nights in
[1:28:22] the heart of the earth so what is that
[1:28:23] sign a resurrection sign
[1:28:25] amen because it because that's what i am
[1:28:27] tim now this resurrection sign would be
[1:28:29] repeated in the end time
[1:28:31] where the resurrected christ would step
[1:28:33] out of history and manifest himself in
[1:28:36] the same way he did but the only
[1:28:37] difference is he's not here in his
[1:28:39] physical body we're looking for the
[1:28:41] physical coming of the lord right we're
[1:28:43] physically going to meet him in the air
[1:28:44] that's what believers believe
[1:28:46] right
[1:28:47] yes i i trust you're looking for that
[1:28:49] day
[1:28:50] i'm not expecting to stay here in this
[1:28:51] fashion
[1:28:52] i'm expecting to go to a wedding supper
[1:28:54] up in glory for three and a half years
[1:28:57] that's what i'm expecting
[1:28:58] i am sure that's what believers believe
[1:29:00] hey because we we we do believe the
[1:29:02] bible around here now
[1:29:04] now brother brown would say now what
[1:29:06] kind of a sign would this wicked
[1:29:07] adulthood generation get the sign of the
[1:29:09] resurrection amen that's what we find
[1:29:12] now christ alive among us the sign of
[1:29:14] the resurrection amen the christ of
[1:29:16] galilee doing the same things the same
[1:29:18] works with his people living amongst the
[1:29:20] mortals performing the sign of a living
[1:29:22] god among them that wicked and
[1:29:24] adulterous generation we're living in
[1:29:26] has has got the sign of jonas the
[1:29:28] resurrection the resurrection power that
[1:29:30] can lift the sinner from the life of sin
[1:29:32] to take the sinful woman unbelieving
[1:29:34] ungodly demon possess make believers out
[1:29:36] of them take men as low and stoop their
[1:29:39] morals make gentlemen out of
[1:29:41] out of them
[1:29:44] amen well my page numbers are all funny
[1:29:46] where are we
[1:29:48] page four amen that is he says take the
[1:29:51] gentleman out of them amen
[1:29:53] he would see see brother branham we know
[1:29:55] he's not god we're not caught up in his
[1:29:57] personality but he's a fulfillment of
[1:29:59] prophecy
[1:30:00] right so so jesus god revealed himself
[1:30:03] in his son but then he would take a
[1:30:05] redeemed son at the same time right a
[1:30:07] sinner saved by grace and he would show
[1:30:09] the people this is the power of the
[1:30:10] blood
[1:30:11] this is what my
[1:30:13] this is what the power of the cross can
[1:30:15] produce where god can come and dwell in
[1:30:17] a person take over their life and
[1:30:19] completely don't you want that no longer
[1:30:21] either liveth but christ that liveth in
[1:30:23] me
[1:30:24] amen he would he would um this is
[1:30:26] thousands of times through his ministry
[1:30:27] but this is from this day the scripture
[1:30:28] is fulfilled
[1:30:30] and i just want to read this because
[1:30:32] it's tremendous now he says now to
[1:30:33] preach it
[1:30:34] that i said a while ago if you preach
[1:30:36] anything in its gospel truth and god is
[1:30:38] obligated to vindicate that is that true
[1:30:40] now if that be so let the god that wrote
[1:30:42] the word let the god that made the
[1:30:44] prophecy let the god who is god of the
[1:30:46] word come forth and prove that he is
[1:30:48] still god that's quite a challenge as
[1:30:50] elijah went up on the mountain watching
[1:30:52] elisha went watching elijah he said i
[1:30:53] want a double portion and the mantle
[1:30:55] that is on elijah fell upon elisha he
[1:30:58] walked down he doubled that blanket up
[1:31:00] and he struck the river and said where
[1:31:02] is the god of elijah and the same thing
[1:31:04] that happened for elijah happened for
[1:31:05] elisha and the same gospel the same
[1:31:08] power the same son of man that was
[1:31:10] yesterday is today and will be forever
[1:31:12] hebrews 38 do you believe it then i ask
[1:31:14] you i cannot be him but he is here we
[1:31:17] are only a carrier some of you people
[1:31:19] out there that sick and afflicted that
[1:31:21] you know that i don't know you now let
[1:31:23] god if i can humble myself enough you
[1:31:26] pray and ask god he says i don't guess
[1:31:28] there's a prayer card in the building no
[1:31:29] we never get any prayer cards we're
[1:31:31] going to have a prayer meeting or
[1:31:32] healing of the sick at the church but
[1:31:34] you pray and you know that i'm a total
[1:31:36] stranger to you see you know me
[1:31:38] jeffersonville i don't want people from
[1:31:40] jeffersonville to do that that's where
[1:31:41] he was preaching i want people from away
[1:31:43] from here somewhere see if god still
[1:31:45] reveals see if he's still the same
[1:31:47] yesterday today and forever do like the
[1:31:50] little woman did he pass through and she
[1:31:52] said i believe this man she had a blood
[1:31:54] issue and she said if i can touch the
[1:31:55] border of his garment i believe him i'll
[1:31:57] be made whole is that right because of
[1:31:59] her faith that day the scripture was
[1:32:01] fulfilled he bind up the heart heart of
[1:32:04] the brokenhearted healed the sick and
[1:32:05] the lame when she touched his garment
[1:32:07] and walked out and sat down he turned
[1:32:09] around and said who touched me how'd he
[1:32:12] ever know in that great throng of people
[1:32:14] probably 30 times that's here tonight
[1:32:16] thousands of them
[1:32:17] how did he know he said who touched me
[1:32:19] he didn't say
[1:32:20] that just to be saying he said that
[1:32:22] because it was true he said who touched
[1:32:23] me and directly he looked around and
[1:32:25] seen the little woman where she was
[1:32:27] sitting or standing whatever position
[1:32:29] she was in told her her blood issue was
[1:32:31] over that was jesus today that's him
[1:32:33] today you believe that
[1:32:35] he says i don't know you god does but
[1:32:37] you got pains in your sight so now he's
[1:32:38] talking to someone it's bothering you
[1:32:40] that's right you're sitting there
[1:32:41] praying about it am i a stranger to you
[1:32:43] and you're and where strangers want to
[1:32:45] another stand up if that's it i don't
[1:32:47] know you it's it's this man right here
[1:32:49] in the corner this young fellow you've
[1:32:51] also got a bad throat that's right
[1:32:52] you're praying about that you're all
[1:32:54] nervous about something you're going to
[1:32:56] have to leave the meeting because you're
[1:32:57] a minister you've got some engagements
[1:32:59] you've got to take care of that's right
[1:33:01] aha you believe god knows who you are
[1:33:03] reverend mr smith now you can go and be
[1:33:05] healed jesus christ made you whole go on
[1:33:08] to your meeting your throat won't bother
[1:33:09] you he asked a question who did he touch
[1:33:12] there is a man sitting right back here
[1:33:14] he's suffering he's got a tumor on his
[1:33:16] left lung
[1:33:17] he isn't from here he has been you have
[1:33:20] been a mind worker that is right i'm a
[1:33:22] total stranger to you if that's right
[1:33:24] shake your hand the tumor is in your
[1:33:25] left lung and you're up for an operation
[1:33:27] right away is that right you're not from
[1:33:29] here you're from out of town you're from
[1:33:31] virginia that's right you believe god
[1:33:32] knows who you are mr mitchell that's
[1:33:34] right go home be made well jesus christ
[1:33:36] makes you whole ass a man i never seen
[1:33:39] him in my life he was sitting there
[1:33:41] praying
[1:33:43] now you can go see that man's interview
[1:33:44] he's interviewed about that he said i've
[1:33:46] never been to any of william barron's
[1:33:48] meetings before i'd never known the guy
[1:33:50] but my pastor knew about him he took me
[1:33:51] along because he he was a mind worker he
[1:33:54] had a he said he had a tumor in his left
[1:33:56] lung the size of a fist
[1:33:58] and he was up for an operation right
[1:34:00] away
[1:34:00] and he was right down the back of the
[1:34:02] church and and brother brown called him
[1:34:04] out but that's the same thing as jesus
[1:34:05] speaking to the woman at the well
[1:34:07] and he says you have been a mind worker
[1:34:09] because he never went back to being a
[1:34:10] mind worker after this meeting he went
[1:34:11] to be a pastor of a church
[1:34:13] and that tumor left him
[1:34:15] so what is that that's the sign of the
[1:34:17] messiah
[1:34:18] right that's jesus being revealed
[1:34:19] through a redeemed son
[1:34:21] that so so the first season
[1:34:24] has now repeated now in the second
[1:34:26] season
[1:34:27] hallelujah but as i said now there's
[1:34:29] also a resurrection to take place
[1:34:32] amen now when i talk about a
[1:34:34] resurrection i'm not just talking about
[1:34:36] the dead in christ raising our bodies
[1:34:37] being changed because our soul we've
[1:34:40] we've got to be changed from being dead
[1:34:42] and trespassed and sins to be alive in
[1:34:43] christ we need to be resurrected that
[1:34:45] way first before a physical resurrection
[1:34:48] can take place amen so we've had in the
[1:34:50] first season we had we had the lord
[1:34:52] revealing himself
[1:34:54] supernatural power of god manifested the
[1:34:56] mysteries be revealed amen a crucifixion
[1:34:58] a rejection but then a resurrection
[1:35:01] right and then and then in this season
[1:35:02] again because the season had to come
[1:35:04] back around again and we've had the lord
[1:35:06] reveal himself in power signs and
[1:35:08] wonders miracles done the same
[1:35:10] same same discernment right the same
[1:35:12] revealing the secrets of the tents of of
[1:35:14] the heart right we've had a rejection of
[1:35:16] crucifixion but now we've got a
[1:35:18] resurrection
[1:35:19] amen because that resurrection isn't
[1:35:20] just talking about that's talking about
[1:35:22] you
[1:35:24] amen because as jesus was in the tomb
[1:35:26] and the angel lord came down
[1:35:29] and and rolled the stone away and he
[1:35:31] came out resurrected i mean so we were
[1:35:34] once in a tomb
[1:35:36] amen it could have been a tomb of
[1:35:38] religion it could have been just a tomb
[1:35:40] of unbelief could be a tomb of the world
[1:35:42] culture whatever it is the devil wants
[1:35:44] us to be in a tomb
[1:35:46] raider we don't belong in a graveyard in
[1:35:48] a spiritual graveyard no we're made for
[1:35:50] life we're made for eternal life we're
[1:35:52] not made to be dead in the world and
[1:35:53] trespass and sins we're built to be
[1:35:56] alive
[1:35:57] amen so as the as the as the lord
[1:36:00] was was was brought out of the tomb
[1:36:03] now i'm talking about this resurrection
[1:36:04] because we're alive in christ
[1:36:06] who's alive in christ oh so the season
[1:36:08] has come back around again
[1:36:10] amen so now we were once dead and it
[1:36:12] could be a tomb of denomination it could
[1:36:15] just be unbelief could be the world
[1:36:16] whatever whatever you could just name
[1:36:19] place it there whatever you were once in
[1:36:21] you could be gaming like me or movies
[1:36:24] music drinking alcohol parties whatever
[1:36:27] whatever it is or just being a good
[1:36:29] person just just trying to be a good
[1:36:30] religious person that's a tomb
[1:36:32] right
[1:36:33] but that was prophesied that a
[1:36:35] resurrection would take place
[1:36:38] where a people who were once dead would
[1:36:41] become alive
[1:36:43] hallelujah a resurrection would take
[1:36:45] place no sorry brother i would say in
[1:36:47] the rising of the sun
[1:36:48] he says a waving of the sheaf now we
[1:36:50] don't have time to go into this what was
[1:36:51] the sheath the first one that come to
[1:36:53] mature the first one proved it was a
[1:36:55] sheath that proved it was a sheath
[1:36:56] hallelujah i'm sure you see what i'm
[1:36:58] talking about that's the life of christ
[1:37:02] on display it waved over the people the
[1:37:04] first time there will come forth for the
[1:37:06] bright age for a resurrection out of
[1:37:08] dark denominationalism will be a message
[1:37:10] that the full maturity of the word is
[1:37:12] turned back in its full power and waved
[1:37:14] over the people by the same signs and
[1:37:16] wonders that he did back there he says
[1:37:18] because i live ye live also speaking to
[1:37:21] his wife because i live ye live also
[1:37:24] what a resurrection that was and what a
[1:37:26] resurrection this is i mean to be
[1:37:28] quickened from the dead to be made alive
[1:37:30] in christ jesus by god's quickening
[1:37:33] power
[1:37:34] hallelujah that's what we are i was once
[1:37:36] dead now i'm alive
[1:37:39] i was once dead in the world just
[1:37:40] floating along with the tide but in the
[1:37:42] lord look beyond me look beyond my fault
[1:37:45] and saw my need and found me hallelujah
[1:37:47] and made me alive in him
[1:37:49] amen
[1:37:50] amen
[1:37:52] so now
[1:37:53] if the season is because remember
[1:37:55] everything that god did in the prophet's
[1:37:57] ministry he's still the same god today
[1:38:00] hallelujah he's still the same god today
[1:38:02] you know i've had like brother armand
[1:38:04] would say to me quite regularly have you
[1:38:06] bugged my house
[1:38:08] what we talk about you preach about and
[1:38:10] it's so it's so common in the sunday
[1:38:12] school i think it's become common
[1:38:14] we don't have meetings like you know we
[1:38:16] don't sit down and say now i'm going to
[1:38:18] preach on this can you teach on this
[1:38:21] and the we don't we don't have a plan i
[1:38:23] don't have a plan
[1:38:24] quite often even saturday what are you
[1:38:26] going to preach on tomorrow i don't know
[1:38:29] you know but god knows amen right so
[1:38:32] it's the same god
[1:38:34] revealing secrets of the thoughts of the
[1:38:36] heart maybe in a different way but it's
[1:38:38] the same god living here
[1:38:40] hell it's the same mind of christ
[1:38:42] revealing himself this is not a
[1:38:44] hit-and-miss thing
[1:38:45] sometimes i think it's hit and miss
[1:38:47] because i'm just i feel like i'm dumb
[1:38:48] but you know but god knows what he's
[1:38:50] doing he's in our midst and i trust it
[1:38:52] gets our attention where we can be
[1:38:54] driving along and asking a question then
[1:38:56] the answer comes out right here you are
[1:38:58] asking that question here's the answer
[1:39:00] you know or talking about something you
[1:39:02] know last night or whatever it is you
[1:39:03] know it's like brother amanda you had
[1:39:05] that big you know clash with his dad a
[1:39:07] few years ago when he was here and he
[1:39:09] prayed said lord i need a conference
[1:39:11] then the next morning i need a
[1:39:12] conference with you you still answer you
[1:39:14] know and then the next morning i get up
[1:39:15] and i preach it and and and you can ask
[1:39:18] him he'll tell the testimony a lot
[1:39:19] better than me
[1:39:20] the the order in which they discuss
[1:39:22] things was the order in which i preached
[1:39:23] on it
[1:39:24] and it happened over and over again and
[1:39:28] his his his father the night before they
[1:39:30] were going back to south africa got
[1:39:32] baptized because a little girl who was
[1:39:34] about two years old i mean picked up a
[1:39:37] mask and before that when i was reading
[1:39:39] romans 6 and talking about baptism
[1:39:41] because because his wife so ahman's mum
[1:39:43] was getting baptized i was reading from
[1:39:45] romans 6 and lilia got up 2 years old
[1:39:48] stood in front of me pointed up at the
[1:39:50] bible and looked at him then then walked
[1:39:52] along picked up a little zorro mask and
[1:39:54] gave it to him
[1:39:56] and he was a man who was so frustrated
[1:39:58] saying
[1:39:59] i just want that phone that i can talk
[1:40:00] to god on
[1:40:02] people say god talks to them god never
[1:40:03] talks to me
[1:40:04] and god used a little two-year-old about
[1:40:06] that age wasn't she was she about two
[1:40:08] you know to actually tell him listen to
[1:40:10] the word take off your religious mask
[1:40:12] listen to the word and obey it
[1:40:14] and so he gave his life to the lord got
[1:40:16] baptized in their bathtub up manor manor
[1:40:18] drive
[1:40:19] and he came out of the water a different
[1:40:21] man
[1:40:22] hallelujah why what's happening because
[1:40:23] god is working the same god back there
[1:40:27] in the sixties or two thousand years ago
[1:40:29] is the same lord jesus here
[1:40:32] hallelujah what's it doing to bring
[1:40:34] forth a resurrection
[1:40:36] amen we are not dead in in dead in
[1:40:39] religion
[1:40:40] we are not dead in some idea of man amen
[1:40:43] this is not just a a a church
[1:40:46] this is all around the world there's a
[1:40:48] group of people that the lord has
[1:40:49] revealed himself to in his word to show
[1:40:52] them this is now the season just like
[1:40:53] the armor company girl you know people
[1:40:55] can criticize your experience no doubt
[1:40:57] those cousins would say you're a foolish
[1:40:59] girl
[1:41:01] what's a spring in your step you know
[1:41:02] you know people get happy grumpy people
[1:41:04] love to bring them down to their level
[1:41:07] because they would have been real upset
[1:41:08] because all of them would have said i'm
[1:41:09] gonna get him tonight you watch
[1:41:12] she failed
[1:41:13] the next one
[1:41:15] you know the next one say well if she
[1:41:16] won't she won't get him i'm gonna get
[1:41:19] him
[1:41:20] she failed
[1:41:21] now they're both grumpy and then the
[1:41:23] third one says well third time lucky hey
[1:41:26] maybe change your tactic a bit i don't
[1:41:28] know
[1:41:29] that fails miserably
[1:41:31] and then that and then so they've all
[1:41:32] failed
[1:41:35] then that next morning
[1:41:37] they don't know a proposal has taken
[1:41:39] place
[1:41:40] and they don't know that their cousin
[1:41:41] that they despise who think there's
[1:41:43] nothing good in her has said
[1:41:47] and so the next morning she gets up it's
[1:41:49] different today
[1:41:51] hallelujah and maybe she's singing i'm
[1:41:53] so glad i can say i'm one she's
[1:41:54] whistling something doing dishes what
[1:41:56] good morning how are you doing today you
[1:41:58] know and they've got a face that would
[1:42:00] you know that would kill her kill an
[1:42:02] elephant at a hundred yards and says i
[1:42:03] definitely stare like laser beams there
[1:42:05] because they're failed
[1:42:07] now
[1:42:08] eventually it would come out to them
[1:42:11] he asked me
[1:42:12] to marry him
[1:42:14] and i said yes
[1:42:16] can you imagine the amount of criticism
[1:42:18] that just would be blasted upon her
[1:42:20] that didn't really happen he's just
[1:42:22] playing with you he's just twisting up
[1:42:25] your mind that experience wasn't real
[1:42:28] you say you're a christian
[1:42:30] you say god really met you and changed
[1:42:32] your life oh no that no no that was just
[1:42:34] a mental illusion you just because those
[1:42:36] people are like that you just kind of no
[1:42:38] no see but the thing is they can't say
[1:42:41] it didn't happen because they weren't
[1:42:42] there when it happened
[1:42:44] and they didn't have the experience you
[1:42:46] know no one can say to me that god
[1:42:48] didn't fill his love with my
[1:42:50] fill my heart with his love
[1:42:52] that changed my life took all the world
[1:42:53] out of me no one can say that that
[1:42:55] didn't happen because i was there i had
[1:42:57] the experience
[1:42:58] hallelujah i'm still enjoying that
[1:43:00] experience today
[1:43:01] oh louise so the thing is the criticism
[1:43:04] didn't change the fact that she was
[1:43:05] engaged
[1:43:07] the criticism didn't change the fact she
[1:43:08] was going to get married i mean but now
[1:43:11] she had come back to when the season
[1:43:12] came back around you know what i love
[1:43:14] about seasons is it has an effect on
[1:43:16] people
[1:43:18] a natural season affects people
[1:43:22] you look at wildlife we'll just take
[1:43:23] nature we know in new zealand there's
[1:43:25] the um i think it's the little bird the
[1:43:26] godwit they one of the biggest
[1:43:28] migrational uh flights of the world of
[1:43:30] any kind of bird they come from you know
[1:43:32] i think they go down to the south island
[1:43:34] maybe up here some they go up to alaska
[1:43:36] or something
[1:43:37] every year they'll make that migration
[1:43:40] and the thing is it's the change of the
[1:43:42] season causes them
[1:43:44] to know it's time to migrate
[1:43:46] now brother brown would talk about ducks
[1:43:50] hallelujah
[1:43:51] he would talk about ducks now he's not
[1:43:53] just telling the story to tell a little
[1:43:55] story he's he's wanted to lay something
[1:43:57] in now these ducks they would they would
[1:43:59] migrate annually from from down the
[1:44:01] south louisiana or the gulf of mexico
[1:44:03] and they'd go up into canada so
[1:44:06] in the summertime now i'll probably get
[1:44:08] this mixed up but in the in the winter
[1:44:10] time they'll be in louisiana
[1:44:12] then they'll go up in the springtime
[1:44:14] they'll have their babies up in canada
[1:44:16] now what i love about this is
[1:44:19] is that now now a change of season
[1:44:21] happens
[1:44:22] the day before they're just on their
[1:44:24] pond they're doing their thing you know
[1:44:26] their babies are ready to fly because
[1:44:27] god's going to get us ready
[1:44:29] you know the season doesn't change and
[1:44:31] these babies just hatching out
[1:44:33] they are fully ready for the flight it's
[1:44:36] the same thing with you and i you have
[1:44:37] the baptism of the holy ghost you truly
[1:44:39] are you're ready for your flight
[1:44:41] hallelujah you're ready for your flight
[1:44:42] and so now the first cold wind begins to
[1:44:45] blow
[1:44:47] and actually cause them to start
[1:44:49] swarming
[1:44:50] they their their behavior changes
[1:44:52] because the season changes
[1:44:54] now because because the temperature's
[1:44:57] going down it's actually activating
[1:44:59] something within them we've got to fly
[1:45:01] south
[1:45:03] and a lot of them are born that's their
[1:45:04] first year that so so they're born on
[1:45:07] that pond they've never left that pond
[1:45:08] before just like us
[1:45:10] you know
[1:45:11] we were in the mind of god
[1:45:13] now we're here but we've never left
[1:45:14] who's left this world before
[1:45:16] gone to another dimension
[1:45:18] no no so we've never left this i know it
[1:45:21] may be a silly question but we've never
[1:45:22] left this world before just like those
[1:45:24] baby ducks you know now they're fully
[1:45:26] built to fly they've got their feathers
[1:45:28] everything the first cold wind begins to
[1:45:29] blow they begin to swarm so their
[1:45:31] behavior changes because the season
[1:45:33] changes now as i said a while ago i just
[1:45:35] mentioned it
[1:45:37] you've got to be careful what you get
[1:45:38] stirred up about in the season
[1:45:40] right because this is the season of the
[1:45:41] catching away of the bride this is the
[1:45:44] season of the rapture now there's a lot
[1:45:46] of there weren't just ducks on that pond
[1:45:48] there would have been some birds who
[1:45:49] just would have stayed there they didn't
[1:45:50] migrate they're not migrationary
[1:45:52] you know birds that migrate
[1:45:54] but you know if we could go back into
[1:45:56] that day no actually let's go here now
[1:46:00] there's a lot of cold wind blowing there
[1:46:02] is actually a season change
[1:46:04] right now
[1:46:05] in the world there's a season change now
[1:46:07] if we're on that pond and you know
[1:46:09] winter begin to start to blow or autumn
[1:46:11] fall you know we could have
[1:46:14] a lot of animals there maybe would have
[1:46:16] complained about the cold wind
[1:46:19] so they would have got on their blogs
[1:46:20] made their websites you know
[1:46:22] made some very deep and you know
[1:46:24] insightful it's amazing how people make
[1:46:26] a lot of videos when they're driving in
[1:46:27] the car and post them about deep things
[1:46:28] that you know you know they've been
[1:46:29] thinking about you know you know but
[1:46:31] that'd be
[1:46:32] those animals on that pond would be
[1:46:34] complaining and they'd be blogging
[1:46:36] they'd be protesting they'd be swarming
[1:46:38] about the wrong thing
[1:46:41] right now the duck on the other hand
[1:46:43] we could have asked them
[1:46:45] are you upset by this cold weather
[1:46:48] no
[1:46:50] why aren't you upset you should look
[1:46:52] that badge is upset that pelican i don't
[1:46:54] know what's up there but you know that
[1:46:55] yo that that other birds there you know
[1:46:58] you know that beaver that's been on the
[1:46:59] dam the whole time he's complaining
[1:47:02] this one's upset why aren't you upset
[1:47:05] you know
[1:47:07] you should be very you should be aware
[1:47:09] of what's going on and they'd say i am
[1:47:11] aware
[1:47:13] i am aware what's going on i know it's
[1:47:15] getting colder but there's something
[1:47:17] within me that's stirring up
[1:47:20] there's something within me that's
[1:47:21] starting to swarm there's something
[1:47:23] within me that's starting to get excited
[1:47:25] and it's not the wind isn't dragging me
[1:47:27] down the wind something's telling me i'm
[1:47:30] about to leave
[1:47:32] where are you going i actually not sure
[1:47:34] but i've heard about a rice paddy down
[1:47:36] in louisiana that's my future home
[1:47:39] hallelujah and i'm going to be moving
[1:47:41] very soon and before you know it the
[1:47:43] head drake begins about honking on the
[1:47:45] honking on the pond and you know then it
[1:47:47] begins to really rally them
[1:47:49] because a life within them is being
[1:47:50] expressed
[1:47:52] i mean hey the badger can complain all
[1:47:54] the people yo they can complain let the
[1:47:56] world swarm with what they're going to
[1:47:57] swarm about you can't stop it you can't
[1:48:00] give them a reasonable thing and say
[1:48:01] hold on you know the bible says this is
[1:48:04] going to happen
[1:48:05] don't give your whole heart to those
[1:48:06] things
[1:48:07] actually it's time to leave the world
[1:48:09] and the lord has prepared us to leave
[1:48:12] hallelujah and say they'll start
[1:48:14] swarming because the life within them
[1:48:16] hallelujah and the next thing you know i
[1:48:18] mean they gravitation you know they're
[1:48:20] flapping their wings the life of them
[1:48:21] takes them off the ground
[1:48:23] and they fly away
[1:48:25] and they don't come back till the next
[1:48:27] season
[1:48:28] now we are not going to heaven
[1:48:30] and then come back here then go into
[1:48:32] heaven and go back here no this is not
[1:48:34] the migration i'm talking about i do uh
[1:48:36] we're gonna we're we're we're leaving
[1:48:37] this world
[1:48:39] soon and very soon we're leaving this
[1:48:41] pond
[1:48:42] i mean we're actually built to leave and
[1:48:44] that's why we should be i'd pray
[1:48:46] something within us swarming
[1:48:49] the seasons come around again
[1:48:51] hallelujah the years come around again
[1:48:54] you know i love about it there would
[1:48:56] have come a day in that in that girl's
[1:48:58] life and i'm gonna i'm just gonna close
[1:48:59] with this
[1:49:01] there would have been a last time
[1:49:04] last time
[1:49:06] does the dishes last time
[1:49:09] does all that stuff last time
[1:49:12] here's the nonsense of the cousins last
[1:49:14] time
[1:49:14] you didn't realize you know because she
[1:49:16] could i've told them you weren't there
[1:49:19] when he proposed
[1:49:21] you weren't there he turned you down i
[1:49:23] don't know why he did you know
[1:49:25] i'm just happy the lord chose me
[1:49:28] i can't speak for enough but i'm glad
[1:49:30] so he saw something in this guy that was
[1:49:33] a value he said i'm taking you home
[1:49:36] hallelujah
[1:49:37] so she had to wait her way through the
[1:49:38] criticism but the thing is anchored in
[1:49:41] her heart you got to think about this
[1:49:42] the worst day she could ever have
[1:49:44] he's still coming for me
[1:49:47] the worst day it could have been
[1:49:49] freezing cold winter maybe the sheets
[1:49:50] froze on the line i don't know but you
[1:49:52] know they still think praise god
[1:49:55] he's coming
[1:49:56] hallelujah this would have been the
[1:49:58] motivating factor of her life would have
[1:50:00] given her such purpose he's coming
[1:50:03] he's coming for me
[1:50:05] hallelujah and then comes the last day
[1:50:06] she does the dishes last time sweets the
[1:50:08] floor last time says the food last time
[1:50:11] amen puts up with that nonsense last
[1:50:13] time then she goes in
[1:50:15] and she puts on the wedding garment
[1:50:18] and it fits her just right yo what's
[1:50:20] amazing about the word of god you know
[1:50:22] surely you know when you first meet him
[1:50:24] even as we walk with him it can tear
[1:50:26] strips off our hide
[1:50:28] the word eh
[1:50:29] but you kind of find out it just it just
[1:50:32] fits
[1:50:33] hallelujah i don't need to lose weight i
[1:50:36] don't need to put on weight it fits me
[1:50:37] here it fits me here it fits you know
[1:50:40] the whole word of god the wedding
[1:50:41] government fits just right and she puts
[1:50:43] it on
[1:50:45] hello because she's not no longer just
[1:50:47] saying you know she's actually saying no
[1:50:49] no what he promised
[1:50:51] he's here right now can you imagine the
[1:50:53] excitement in her heart
[1:50:56] it's the same kind of temperature like
[1:50:57] it was a year ago
[1:50:59] i mean the fruits on the tree
[1:51:01] the sun's in the same position in the
[1:51:03] sky
[1:51:04] she walks out to the porch the last time
[1:51:06] why because in a year's time
[1:51:08] i'll come back for you
[1:51:10] hallelujah
[1:51:12] and then they come and they abuse her
[1:51:13] for the last time but then the carriage
[1:51:15] comes down the road i'm in the door
[1:51:17] swings i'm saying honey i told you'll be
[1:51:19] coming and here i am i mean i've
[1:51:21] actually had people watching over you
[1:51:23] this whole time hallelujah and now let's
[1:51:25] get out of this place and she heard the
[1:51:27] critics last time and she ran into his
[1:51:30] arms i mean and went to chicago and that
[1:51:32] was the end of it hallelujah and one of
[1:51:34] these days we are back in the season i
[1:51:36] don't believe i'm speaking things
[1:51:37] far-fetched you know it's a time when
[1:51:39] not look for the lord comes again
[1:51:42] and people are caught up in every single
[1:51:44] thing under the sun
[1:51:46] amen and the lord is coming but there's
[1:51:48] a people on the earth i believe i
[1:51:49] believe i'm looking at some of them
[1:51:52] i'm watching and waiting for that glad
[1:51:54] millennial day where the lord will come
[1:51:56] and catch his waiting bride away
[1:51:59] amen
[1:52:00] why because the same season has come
[1:52:02] around again a season of resurrection
[1:52:06] hallelujah
[1:52:08] amen
[1:52:10] here we are
[1:52:11] in this glorious time
[1:52:13] i pray something's moved in your heart
[1:52:15] saying yes this is this time yes
[1:52:17] irrespective of member will never be
[1:52:19] free from trouble we'll never be free
[1:52:21] i'm sorry to say it but in this life we
[1:52:23] will have heartache we'll have sorrow
[1:52:25] we'll have burdens we'll have trials
[1:52:28] we'll have trouble just like she did
[1:52:30] right
[1:52:31] but underpinning all in her life her
[1:52:34] motivating force of her life was he's
[1:52:36] coming for me
[1:52:38] because he promised me
[1:52:40] and now this is the season where he's
[1:52:42] going to come and get
[1:52:44] amen let's have the musicians please
[1:52:45] this
[1:52:49] [Applause]
[1:52:56] morning amen
[1:53:00] praise god
[1:53:06] amen and i can say this because brother
[1:53:08] i said the dynamics of this church will
[1:53:10] be a refilling of the holy spirit
[1:53:12] that we have worked in a small measure
[1:53:14] while the headstone is coming down to
[1:53:15] unite with the body with that head and
[1:53:17] body unites together the full power of
[1:53:19] the holy ghost will raise her up just
[1:53:21] exactly like that even the dead that's
[1:53:23] dead in christ for hundreds of years ago
[1:53:25] will rise in the beauty of his holiness
[1:53:27] and take a flight to the skies the
