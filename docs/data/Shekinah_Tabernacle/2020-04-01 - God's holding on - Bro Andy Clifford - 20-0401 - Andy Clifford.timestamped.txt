[7:12] so if we can't return it
[7:17] you
[7:19] amen praise the Lord Amen that was a
[7:24] powerful song service brother PD really
[7:28] appreciate that and I had a really
[7:32] amazing time it's amazing you know what
[7:35] we can you know when we come together
[7:37] and we just step outside the box and
[7:42] think differently we can still have a
[7:45] glorious time mmm so yeah I just want to
[7:51] praise the Lord and very thankful for
[7:55] this opportunity to share the word amen
[7:59] and especially quite quite a quite a
[8:04] supernatural event to how the sermon
[8:07] came about and how the Lord orders
[8:11] things and yeah it was just the Lord
[8:17] about probably three weeks ago maybe
[8:23] three weeks ago one of the visiting
[8:25] ministers was preaching their belief and
[8:27] whatever some one of the thoughts was
[8:30] how God holds on to us and you know and
[8:34] I got inspiration too in the service and
[8:39] I wrote a song and I shared that song on
[8:42] the whatsapp - was she had something and
[8:47] I shared the song underneath it about
[8:48] how the Lord so glad you held me you
[8:52] know and the Lord has held us and will
[8:54] hold us and holds us through everything
[8:59] from before the world ever began from
[9:03] even in his mind he held us and we'll go
[9:06] through I'm going to explore that but
[9:08] anyway so I was just writing this song
[9:13] you know and like I was just playing it
[9:15] and thinking about the song and then
[9:17] Brahman on the day that I shared this
[9:19] song on the what set Raman brings in the
[9:24] family altar for that day I don't know
[9:27] what version it was but and it was the
[9:29] whole the whole quote was about how the
[9:31] Lord holds on
[9:32] and then and then I don't know what
[9:37] happened I think it was it might have
[9:39] been that Wednesday night and and then
[9:43] it was actually not meant to be me
[9:45] preaching and I didn't know this I
[9:46] haven't checked the roster but Benz is
[9:48] our brother and his preaching mix Luke
[9:50] answer honestly I didn't know but as I
[9:52] cook
[9:53] I was like man it must be this because
[9:55] then I that day it was that day before
[9:59] he said that I was just sitting in my
[10:01] lazy boy and I'm not lazy in the lazy
[10:03] boy but I was sitting at me and and I
[10:10] got I got inspiration with this song and
[10:13] I was like maybe because I was also
[10:15] going to minister to Pakistan and I
[10:18] didn't I was contemplating what to
[10:20] preach on and then when she brought that
[10:23] quota
[10:23] I just went maybe the law wants me to
[10:26] preach on how the Lord's help will hold
[10:29] on to us through everything and
[10:30] especially through this time of the
[10:32] pandemic and so I just I just started
[10:36] putting some notes down because I didn't
[10:38] hear very long I had about 10 minutes so
[10:40] I just started putting some notes down
[10:41] and the whole thing pretty much the
[10:44] whole discourse of what where we will go
[10:46] tonight came out straight away and I've
[10:50] just refined it a bit and put quotes in
[10:52] there and stuff you know to back up what
[10:54] I'm saying but the whole discourse
[10:56] everything just came out flowed out and
[10:58] then that night Ben Ben sees ie and I
[11:00] think brother hand is preaching next
[11:02] week on the Wednesday I was like man the
[11:04] Lord is ordering these things since I
[11:05] just wanted to share that testimony that
[11:09] hid the Lord is an image and I love you
[11:12] well I've never preached to you guys on
[11:14] on zoom' before I've done a lot of
[11:17] preaching on soon but if anyone feels
[11:21] like a meaning you can't in your
[11:22] microphone
[11:23] Amen because I like hearing a means I
[11:28] don't get and I don't get much of him
[11:30] from the via to me so I'll be nice to
[11:32] get some from from the local I don't
[11:37] think they know about a meaning over
[11:39] there but we'll teach them amen
[11:42] anyway I don't want to go
[11:45] any further because the with this so
[11:48] it's just this bow a hit and miss just
[11:52] remember to the Lord Father we are so
[11:55] grateful Lord that we can gather
[11:57] together here Lord Lord on the zoom and
[12:01] what I pray you bless the connection and
[12:03] I just want to add my amen to brother
[12:06] beans prayer that the anointing would be
[12:08] in every room and be a feeling it would
[12:11] be in every bedroom whoever wherever is
[12:14] listening and father I pray that you
[12:16] would bless each service in each home
[12:18] yes my car Lord there is an interaction
[12:22] happening all over this region right
[12:24] Aeneas Lee Lord where you're getting
[12:27] praise Lord it's spread over a wide
[12:29] bandwidth of geography Lord and and
[12:33] you're getting praise from a web of of
[12:36] Lights that a Lord situated here in the
[12:39] Wellington region and wherever else who
[12:41] may be tuned in' and I'm just so
[12:43] grateful Lord Jesus that that we can do
[12:45] this and I ask you bless the service
[12:47] will speak to us a nice I pray Lord that
[12:49] the burden of the word would be
[12:51] expressed people in Jesus Christ's name
[12:57] so as you probably already Minister
[13:02] honored called
[13:03] he held on amen and so we're just gonna
[13:07] and just before we and read the
[13:10] scripture from turning the future into
[13:13] Colossians 1 verse 17 you know we're
[13:18] being apprehended by by the son of men
[13:21] amen Jesus Christ is apprehending us and
[13:25] he's apprehended us and then he hops
[13:28] just some thoughts in before we read the
[13:31] scripture he holds creation together and
[13:34] then he holds the atoms together
[13:37] he holds churches together as hot he's
[13:41] hold marriages together I'm arguing he
[13:44] holds tomorrow he holds the past yes he
[13:47] holds the keys of death and hell and I
[13:50] knew in our heart and he holds
[13:52] prediction he holds him I mean we never
[13:56] need to worry fear have any sort of
[13:59] anxiety or anything at all in his hand
[14:05] just read from Colossians chapter 1
[14:10] verse 17 and he is before all things and
[14:16] by him all things consist
[14:21] amen may the Lord bless us with even to
[14:29] sit together to introduce favorably to
[14:35] exhibit stand near and this is I want to
[14:41] focus a little bit on this a bit later
[14:42] to constitute and to you know
[14:47] elaborating on constitute nations have a
[14:50] constitution that holds them together as
[14:52] a foundation right and we have also been
[14:56] given a constitution and its
[15:00] constitution that the people fight so
[15:02] much because if we lose sight of our
[15:06] identity which is based in the
[15:08] constitution of heaven and what in our
[15:11] identification of our promised land then
[15:14] the devil we lose our identity and and
[15:17] that you end up becoming corrupted like
[15:20] those denominations and like the people
[15:21] of the world fights that but as will
[15:26] enter into it a little bit later
[15:28] the Lord has restored and holds the
[15:31] Constitution in his hand
[15:33] irin and he is in your hand but Christ
[15:43] in you institution man no man can pluck
[15:47] it out of your hand no has he a man and
[15:53] pluck you out of the of the Lord's hand
[15:56] that's right I'm pregnant bomb
[16:00] absolutely secure in providing your life
[16:07] has been completely surrendered and
[16:09] everything is laid out and you have been
[16:11] born again while the Holy Ghost
[16:13] yes revelation team chapter one speaks
[16:19] of the mighty angel come again this is
[16:22] the baptism of the Holy Ghost after 1963
[16:26] so after 1963 when the Lord opened his
[16:30] seals and revealed himself the fullness
[16:33] of the Holy Ghost themself Christ and
[16:36] his fullness came down and those that
[16:39] get the baptism of the Holy Ghost in
[16:41] this age receive him receiving
[16:49] justification they don't just receive a
[16:53] part or a partial but they receive
[16:56] everything the Lord of glory himself in
[17:01] his formation that's right
[17:03] and he's holding the Constitution in his
[17:07] hands and he is enforcing that the devil
[17:11] completely submits to all of the
[17:13] elements and articles of that
[17:15] Constitution and no matter what happens
[17:19] no matter where you go no matter how far
[17:21] you fell or where you came from the Lord
[17:24] will ensure and enforce that
[17:26] Constitution for you I want to read a
[17:38] quote from so on brother Branham says
[17:41] there is only one holds the future
[17:45] that's gone so he holds the future let
[17:51] him hold you amen very simple and very
[17:55] elementary but you see we often find
[18:00] ourselves trying to take control trying
[18:03] to administer from our own memories and
[18:06] affections and and our own ideas or or
[18:10] we have got walls up and sometimes we
[18:13] don't realize these walls are up as much
[18:17] as he holding you you have to allow them
[18:19] you have to allow them to hold and mold
[18:23] you
[18:24] without your mind getting in caught up
[18:27] in it right without you resisting the
[18:32] Lord and resist the devil
[18:34] I mean Amen that's right glory mmm now I
[18:39] want to read from Philippians chapter 3
[18:41] we won't have time to turn to B so if
[18:43] you just want to if you can turn if you
[18:45] like but I'm just going to read that I
[18:47] may know him and the power of his
[18:49] resurrection Fellowship of his
[18:52] sufferings being made conformable unto
[18:54] his death he means by any means I might
[18:57] attain unto the resurrection of the Dead
[18:59] not as though I had already attained
[19:02] either we're already perfect but I
[19:04] follow after Earth now focus and listen
[19:08] to this clearing that I may apprehend
[19:10] that for which also I am apprehended of
[19:15] Christ Jesus I mean here we find the
[19:19] pivotal thought of where we're going
[19:21] tonight that I may apprehend that well
[19:26] which also I am apprehended of Christ
[19:29] Jesus I mean man Peter is an important
[19:34] Lord in there and we will get further
[19:36] and deeper into this very soon remember
[19:39] you pretended pretended you before the
[19:45] world ever began and all of your
[19:49] descendants and and all of the people
[19:52] that came before he apprehended the
[19:54] chromosomes the apprehended the
[19:56] bloodlines to form you because he saw
[19:58] your he he knew you before societies
[20:05] people were around to shape your
[20:08] personality and to shape the battle that
[20:12] he has set before you so many can have a
[20:16] certain battle in your life a certain
[20:20] ring that would make you a certain way
[20:22] because you would have to be that way an
[20:25] eternity and all things consist
[20:30] he holds the universe he holds every
[20:33] Exum and every energy particle and every
[20:36] light
[20:36] Photon everything is under and before
[20:39] him
[20:39] that's where all things consist
[20:43] and there is a constitution that holds
[20:45] it and he spoke it out of his mouth
[20:48] speaks of message in mistake though to
[20:52] to ever hand you to Orry and to keep you
[21:00] and he does this through Edom anointing
[21:05] ministry a bit later he'll he holds that
[21:12] message in his hands let's just continue
[21:18] this background here in Psalm 139 Jenna
[21:21] verses 7 to 10 it says here whither
[21:25] shall I go from by spirit shall I flee
[21:29] from by presence if I ascend up into
[21:32] heaven thou up there in my bed in hell
[21:36] behold thou out there take the wings of
[21:40] the morning and dwell in the uttermost
[21:42] part of the sea even there shall thy
[21:46] hand leave me and my right hand remember
[21:51] this right hand the Lord is not afraid
[21:59] to to rescue somebody from the pizza
[22:02] from of the spear you know it doesn't
[22:05] even if you've blown the down the
[22:06] darkest deepest trenches of depression
[22:09] even if you bleed down into alcoholism
[22:11] so deep and so entrenched you think that
[22:15] you've gone beyond but you haven't gone
[22:17] beyond because he will still lead you
[22:19] he's still holding you and he's ready to
[22:28] cleanse you to bring you back thank you
[22:39] Lord to bring you back to the way he's
[22:43] holding you he won't let you go
[22:45] he can't let you go because you're part
[22:47] of them he you you see in
[22:49] and that's why you know he says in that
[22:52] day you shall know my father and your
[22:55] and me and I'm a new ally and so if he
[23:00] says under my father you're amazing you
[23:02] were already part of him and that's why
[23:05] he pretended your forefathers are
[23:06] apprehended your lineages to construct
[23:09] you to bring you forth because he had a
[23:11] certain place in the temple he had a
[23:14] certain place in the City of God for you
[23:18] hallelujah
[23:19] you meant part of it you are part of
[23:22] this maybe that's why he's holding you
[23:24] and he's doing everything he does he's
[23:27] holding you in your right hand and you
[23:29] have fallen so far and he would rescue
[23:32] the people from the violence in his
[23:35] heart and he would make it clean by the
[23:37] bleach of his blood thank you Jesus he
[23:39] wouldn't make the violence hot clean
[23:41] because he's holding that hot and holds
[23:44] your heart in his hands your heart is
[23:46] hell even now and if as you see the
[24:01] journey of Israel as you see in the Old
[24:03] Testament as you see in the New
[24:04] Testament with the Apostles even though
[24:07] the Lord's holding you even though even
[24:10] though you know that you are securing
[24:12] him your faith will be challenged you
[24:14] will be tested because the Lord has
[24:17] proven what he has inside you proving
[24:20] your faith and having fourth gold you
[24:27] know there's a reason why these things
[24:30] have to happen and there is a worship
[24:33] that needs to come forth and that's why
[24:35] you see no matter how far we go you may
[24:37] get sick God will hold you you make full
[24:40] flat on your face God will hold you he
[24:42] will be with you amen no matter where
[24:46] you go no matter what happens to you God
[24:48] will hold you he will keep you I mean
[24:55] you see God himself as we've written as
[24:59] we just spoke has tabernacled and men
[25:01] again a man has come
[25:03] down to two mana game and you are having
[25:06] a feast with him Halloween there is a
[25:12] communion taking place in your heart and
[25:14] yes you are having a preview of
[25:19] miniature feast of tabernacles we all go
[25:25] to Jerusalem we all have a millennial
[25:27] condition the preview of a fellowship
[25:33] with the King down into your heart in
[25:38] your life come down and enjoy themselves
[26:40] [Applause]
[27:05] we're about to head into a season where
[27:07] circumstances may not be very good
[27:09] different sponsors may be very dire they
[27:12] may be very hard but you see God will
[27:14] Tabernacle with us God's not gonna
[27:26] they may not be taken away and no signs
[28:43] of God's disapproval neither the bright
[28:46] skies and still waters signs of his love
[28:49] and approval his approval of any of us
[28:55] his love is elective a man which he has
[28:58] which he had for us before the
[29:01] foundation of the world
[29:03] does he love us ah yes yes I'm so glad
[29:08] hallelujah you know this is a very
[29:10] powerful thing for me because yeah you
[29:12] know in the life I come from and
[29:14] probably most of us if not all of us
[29:16] with with we have fought this battle and
[29:19] the battle is you have to prove yourself
[29:22] to be accepted in a circle of people or
[29:25] a circle of friends you know growing up
[29:28] until you
[29:29] into the into the fellowship of the
[29:32] beloved where it's not based on your
[29:35] performance it's not based on how what
[29:37] you can bring to the table it's based on
[29:40] a lectin election it's based on the form
[29:46] you don't have to be by the divine
[29:53] appointment but the Constitution that
[29:55] he's holding in his you don't have to
[30:08] prove yourself to be part of the Chicana
[30:10] Tabernacle you don't have to perform to
[30:12] be anything special you are special and
[30:19] you see that you see we do and before we
[30:22] get the Holy Ghost and before we are in
[30:24] the economy of God and recognizing these
[30:27] things you know we there's a striving
[30:29] that happens in the schoolyard there's a
[30:31] striving that happens on the street is a
[30:33] striving that happens in your business
[30:35] in your career and there's a striving
[30:37] amongst all the children even in the
[30:39] church is a striving to be a check that
[30:42] is a striving to to be cool because of
[30:47] the fall because of human nature so
[30:50] because of that it becomes ingrained in
[30:53] us and you see I just love this and if
[30:56] you could just meditate on this just if
[30:58] you struggle with that just meditate on
[31:01] this his approval of any of us is only
[31:04] in the beloved his lovers are lifted
[31:06] which he had for us before the
[31:08] foundation of the world
[31:09] does he love us yes we know we shall
[31:13] know because he said son amen and it's
[31:20] that voice he says my voice carry me you
[31:24] should say right now lord help me to
[31:25] hear that will help receive that be
[31:31] something but lord help me to accept
[31:51] how do we know because he said some and
[31:54] manifested that he did love us for he
[31:56] brought us to himself and gave us of his
[31:58] third and placed us as sons and how
[32:02] shall I prove my love to him by
[32:05] believing what he said conducting myself
[32:08] with joy we don't know holes but we know
[32:20] who he's holding you wants to do is he
[33:09] wants you to question your question your
[33:12] identity don't question the game reason
[33:16] with the devil little reasonings because
[33:19] the side and submitted to the word and
[33:21] you aren't accepted you are being held
[33:24] because God said so in John chapter 10
[33:32] verse 27 to 30 it says my sheep hear my
[33:35] voice and I know them and they follow me
[33:39] yes and I give unto them eternal life
[33:42] and they shall never perish neither
[33:44] shall any man pluck them out of my hand
[33:47] my father which gave them me is greater
[33:50] than all and no man is able to pluck
[33:53] them out of my father's
[33:54] I and my father are one I'm so glad he
[34:01] said that
[34:01] I'm so glad and you may go through songs
[34:08] but I tell you now God has sent you a
[34:11] message Elijah the Prophet hallelujah
[34:15] remember whose hand Elijah the Prophet
[34:20] was in the seventh angel the seventh
[34:25] star was in the hand of Jesus Christ and
[34:30] we'll read that in a minute he's in the
[34:32] right hand and he sent a message
[34:34] hallelujah and he sent this message and
[34:37] he holds a lighter in his hand because
[34:39] he's sending a word to him coming
[34:46] through the message to all of you all of
[34:54] you sure of this opportunity that is
[35:17] here right now
[35:17] amen where it's still is the
[35:20] entertainment that's like Goliath is on
[35:23] the ground with the virus and yet the
[35:26] Challenger of the world or the
[35:28] entertainment or but ill the filth of
[35:29] spirits they just held like that because
[35:33] they can't do anything the world is at a
[35:35] standstill and the people are sober
[35:37] minded and now it's time to act
[35:40] hallelujah young man you see this
[35:44] message there is a message and God has
[35:46] sent messages to every age the oddest
[35:49] hit messages to every generation is he
[35:51] speaks and he uses that message to older
[35:54] people to grab the people amen to take
[35:57] the people from a corrupted situation
[36:00] from a judgment from from from going the
[36:03] wrong way because God is in his mind
[36:06] has to rest
[36:20] the desire of God would be allowed to go
[36:25] to the very to the very edges of
[36:28] judgment and from the from the hold of
[36:42] you
[37:11] it was you see and these messages they
[37:54] are unique because good when God sends a
[37:57] message he's sending that message to
[37:59] grab a hold of the people he's sending
[38:01] this message to to bring the people up
[38:04] into and this is quite a awesome thought
[38:07] but when people come fully into the
[38:11] message of their age and a bid
[38:14] generation you see they get caught up
[38:16] into a place where they're not affected
[38:18] the laws of the land not affected by the
[38:21] corruption of evil spirits they not
[38:23] affected by the judgment that surrounds
[38:26] the people of the message is a higher
[38:29] order they are of a diplomatic immunity
[38:36] does anyone who want diplomatic immunity
[38:41] amen
[38:42] so I will just explain that a little bit
[38:44] but message is pleasing the other sermon
[38:47] but I just want you know I want to just
[38:49] for you to realize diplomatic immunity
[38:51] is let's say the embassy of Australia
[38:56] here in Wellington and the embassy is
[39:00] not New Zealand law it's actually
[39:02] Australian law yeah and those people
[39:05] those ambassadors of Australia that
[39:08] represent Australia that represent the
[39:10] constitution of Australia they are under
[39:13] Australian law and they can pretty much
[39:15] do anything if Australian law says that
[39:18] they can take any like drugs or whatever
[39:21] just for want of a better you know so if
[39:24] they can do that then they're allowed to
[39:26] do that in their embassy and they have
[39:29] an immunity from the New Zealand law
[39:31] from anything that little New Zealand
[39:34] can come upon them now there is lots of
[39:36] tags and strings and everything because
[39:38] of humanity and Satan's Kingdom but let
[39:40] me tell you that we're of a government
[39:42] that's fire of its indirectly shall be
[39:48] no increase shall be no end of its
[39:51] increasing should continue to push for
[39:53] there is no limitations this is the
[39:56] kingdom of Jesus Christ under diplomatic
[40:07] immunity from all of the evils of this
[40:10] world all the evils that Satan could put
[40:12] up on this world all the corruptions all
[40:14] the judgments all the sicknesses plays
[40:18] community amen
[40:20] just like this round had diplomatic
[40:22] immunity in motion they did not get
[40:25] touched by the plagues
[40:28] a message of Moses a message of Moses
[40:33] they had diplomatic immunity they had
[40:36] their own he didn't condition hallelujah
[40:39] that was completely above it was
[40:41] completely separated God puts a
[40:44] difference between you in the world puts
[40:46] a difference between his people grace
[40:52] God has put those people and medicine
[40:56] different looks a wall between you see
[41:00] under that message of Noah let's go to
[41:02] the message of Noah right now you see
[41:05] when Noah brought the message the
[41:06] message culminated in the ark and God
[41:09] brought the people under the message of
[41:11] Nora up into the above the judgments and
[41:15] completely separated from the elements
[41:18] of the world amen and they were caught
[41:20] up about the judgments in to know is
[41:22] missing and they made it to the new
[41:24] earth
[41:26] louia and is the Moses God help the
[41:29] people and kick them from every plane a
[41:31] man under the message of Joshua God
[41:36] kicked right hand let me just show you
[41:42] how much God can get you to the edge and
[41:45] still protect you it goes beyond
[41:49] imagination argue to even figure it out
[41:52] let's just believe it just be dispelled
[41:59] because when you see right hands
[42:01] testimony she believed the message she
[42:04] believed the message of the Prophet even
[42:06] though she wasn't on vacation she was a
[42:08] Gentile just like you and she believed
[42:11] the message and she said I believe us
[42:14] Joshua and I'm going to it's going to be
[42:21] predicted captain Tanner when the walls
[42:24] came down and judgment struck of the
[42:26] whole world to the next of a house women
[42:32] the walls fell down crumble to the
[42:34] ground and harassed

[43:00] faith who for the joy that was set
