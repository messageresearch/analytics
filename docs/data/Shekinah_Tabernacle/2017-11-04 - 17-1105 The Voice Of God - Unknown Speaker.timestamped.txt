[50:53] art cursed above all cattle and above
[50:55] every beast of the field upon my belly
[50:58] thou shalt go and dust shalt thou eat
[51:00] all the days of their life and I'll put
[51:04] enmity between thee and the woman and
[51:06] between thy seed and her seed and it
[51:07] shall bruise thy head and thou shalt
[51:09] bruise his heel and to the woman he said
[51:11] I'll greatly multiply thy sorrow and thy
[51:13] and my conception and sorrow thou shalt
[51:15] bring forth children and our doubt by
[51:18] there's a desire shall be to thy husband
[51:20] and he shall rule over thee and unto
[51:22] enemy he said because thou has hearken
[51:25] unto the voice of thy wife and has eaten
[51:27] of the tree which I commanded thee
[51:29] saying thou shalt not eat of it cursed
[51:31] is the ground for thy sake and sorrow
[51:35] shalt thou eat of it all the days of thy
[51:37] life I'm going to drop down to verse 20
[51:39] and Adam called us his wife's name Eve
[51:44] because she was she was the mother of
[51:46] all living
[51:47] and to Adam also into his wife did the
[51:51] Lord God make coats of skin and clothe
[51:53] him and the Lord God said Behold the man
[51:55] is become as one of us to know good and
[51:57] evil and now lest he put forth his hand
[51:59] to take also of the tree of life and eat
[52:02] and live forever therefore the Lord God
[52:04] sent him forth from the Garden - till
[52:06] the ground from which they were taken
[52:08] Amen may the Lord bless his word you may
[52:10] have your seats this morning now we've
[52:14] got a few other places to read but I
[52:16] want you to notice there's a reason why
[52:19] why God came down in the garden he came
[52:23] down sin sin entered into creation I
[52:26] want to speak on the voice of God today
[52:28] now we understand that sin came into
[52:31] into God's creation Adam and Eve became
[52:35] separated from God and then God came
[52:40] down and now before this happened and we
[52:44] know it's not eating a fruit but before
[52:46] this happened they would have rejoiced
[52:49] to hear the voice of God walking in the
[52:50] garden they would never have been afraid
[52:52] here was their father their father would
[52:55] come down and have fellowship with them
[52:57] and say you know did you enjoy your day
[53:00] in this place that I've made you you
[53:02] know have you enjoyed have you enjoyed
[53:04] my creation have you enjoyed it and they
[53:06] would have said oh yes oh isn't it
[53:08] lovely and you wonderful to make us a
[53:11] place like this isn't it wonderful that
[53:13] you made us you know your children isn't
[53:16] this a wonderful place and they would
[53:17] have worshipped him but but darkness sin
[53:22] came into the world and they heard the
[53:24] same voice calling for them and they
[53:26] were afraid and it's the same thing but
[53:30] remember God's God's purpose when he
[53:32] came down into the garden wasn't to
[53:34] destroy them it wasn't - it wasn't to
[53:37] cast them into outer darkness he had a
[53:39] reason he was walking in the garden I
[53:41] mean he knew they would fall he knows
[53:43] all things he knows the end from the
[53:45] beginning he wasn't surprised I mean of
[53:48] the serpent beguiled Eve the way he did
[53:49] and the act happened and you know he
[53:51] wasn't surprised he knew it would happen
[53:53] and then when it did happen he didn't
[53:55] send an angel he didn't sin maybe a
[53:58] cherubim or a serum or you know Gabriel
[54:00] he went himself he went himself into the
[54:03] garden polu and he had a purpose to go
[54:05] and his purpose wasn't to destroy his
[54:08] children but he was going to show I'm
[54:09] going to clothe you Tolu you I'm going
[54:13] to close you with a sacrifice
[54:15] I'm going to cover your sin I mean I'm
[54:18] going to cover what you've done
[54:19] hallelujah I'm going to bring
[54:21] reconciliation I'm in between me and you
[54:23] hallelujah this was his purpose amen
[54:27] he had to take away their fig leaf
[54:28] covering we know religion that the word
[54:30] religion actually means a covering and
[54:33] humanity all of humanity has some kind
[54:35] of religion even the atheists believe
[54:37] something because their science could
[54:40] not prove where life first was created
[54:42] they have to believe it by faith you
[54:43] know I yeah I've had discussions with
[54:46] many I studied biochemistry at
[54:48] university I
[54:49] I studied the origin of life for a
[54:51] little bit as part of one of my courses
[54:52] and I would say well the the laws of
[54:55] chemistry actually stop life forming how
[54:58] you say it did and they said no we're
[55:00] not talking about when the first you
[55:03] know precursors to amino acids que yo yo
[55:07] came together we're not talking about
[55:08] that we're talking about when cells
[55:10] begin to go single-cell things begin to
[55:12] evolve when multiple
[55:14] and create higher life but I said but
[55:16] you can't start here you got to go back
[55:18] here what happened in the beginning
[55:20] because if you can't if you don't know
[55:21] what happened here then you've got to
[55:23] believe something happened to get you to
[55:24] this point so they all everyone believed
[55:26] something I mean everyone believed
[55:28] something and so so if one has a
[55:31] covering everyone has a covering and
[55:34] it's man-made let's put the fig leaves
[55:37] together Adam Eve that's a good idea
[55:39] list I don't know who who had the idea
[55:41] but let's let's arrange it in our way
[55:43] but then when the voice of God came they
[55:47] realized they're covering didn't do any
[55:48] good
[55:48] they still had fear it didn't cover up
[55:51] the act
[55:52] it didn't just sweep it under the rug he
[55:54] can't sweep anything under the rug I
[55:56] mean when you come into the presence of
[55:58] God I mean all of your life was exposed
[56:00] but he does it for a reason because he
[56:02] doesn't want you just to her carry a
[56:04] bunch of guilt and shame but he wants to
[56:06] take it from you I mean take it off I'll
[56:09] take it
[56:09] hallelujah I took up Calvary hallelujah
[56:12] USA yes Lord I've accepted it Amen it's
[56:15] a pardon I meant pardoning grace
[56:17] hallelujah you got to accept that amen
[56:20] it's got to be accepted as a pardon
[56:23] hallelujah and then so now all of their
[56:27] fig leaf religion had to go wait did I
[56:29] turn that off ok that's fine I think I
[56:33] can do that yeah I can do that but thank
[56:37] you sorry but you know all of that had
[56:40] to go but God spoke to them I'm gonna
[56:43] cover you I'm gonna remember those skins
[56:47] we read there we read there he took
[56:50] skins let's see if we can get back to
[56:52] this took it says there he made coats of
[56:56] skins and clothed them now I believe
[56:59] that would have that would have been
[57:00] lambskins I mean I wouldn't know
[57:04] wouldn't have been you know anything
[57:05] else would have been the sacrifice I'm
[57:07] gonna cover you with the skins of the
[57:09] sacrifice how Lou your brother Brahim
[57:12] says you know he says when they're
[57:13] walking out of the garden
[57:14] those those lambskins beating against
[57:16] their legs the blood was still dripping
[57:18] down and there's a promise I'm going to
[57:21] send the seed of the woman and it's not
[57:23] going to be a natural lamb that's going
[57:26] to undo this
[57:27] but a man is going to come the seed of
[57:29] the woman is going to come I'm going to
[57:31] become flesh and I'm not just gonna
[57:33] cover your sin I'm going to annihilate
[57:35] your sin
[57:35] hallelujah and the same judgment that
[57:37] happened there because it narrowed down
[57:39] who did this then then the man said it
[57:42] was the woman and the woman said it was
[57:43] the serpent
[57:44] I mean in the judgment went down and
[57:46] then so it was it was taken off them
[57:48] because the guilty party the real guilty
[57:50] party was the serpent and it's the same
[57:53] thing in this day
[57:54] I mean sin has been revealed that we
[57:57] come to find out that we never did it in
[57:59] the first place when God thought of you
[58:01] before the foundation of the world I
[58:03] mean he didn't see you in sin and
[58:04] darkness I mean he saw you redeemed
[58:07] what's in his blood made in His image
[58:09] made in his likeness I mean that's
[58:12] that's how he saw you before the
[58:13] foundation of the world and then there's
[58:15] come a point now where we see who
[58:17] started at all Satan you you slicker you
[58:20] did it
[58:21] I mean you caused this to happen amen
[58:24] and then it will come down to the great
[58:25] white throne judgment where all the sin
[58:27] of the world we hit the pond him and
[58:29] he's got to go to a lake of fire
[58:30] hallelujah we don't have to go to their
[58:32] place amen
[58:34] I'm so glad that's the case now we we
[58:39] don't live in Eden but we're living in
[58:41] another garden this world this world is
[58:45] a different kind of garden this is
[58:47] Satan's garden it's still a garden
[58:50] nonetheless this is this is the best he
[58:52] can make and and he's made the world
[58:55] like this to distract you and to entice
[58:58] you and make you turn your heart away
[59:01] and follow other things but but I just
[59:04] so rejoice when God gets a hold of a
[59:06] person the devil can wave the best he
[59:09] has I'll give you everything but Jesus
[59:12] he said if you bow down worship me I'll
[59:13] give you all the kingdoms of the world
[59:15] but he said get behind me Satan because
[59:18] the thing is that the devil will try and
[59:20] give you a kingdom it may not be a
[59:22] nation but you may be popular in a
[59:24] certain group of people we may have an
[59:25] influence over a certain group of people
[59:27] and that will be your kingdom he said
[59:29] I'll give you this if you just bow down
[59:31] and worship me but there's something in
[59:33] the believer that says I don't want your
[59:34] best you can line it all up in front of
[59:37] me there
[59:37] nothing in me that wants it I want Jesus
[59:39] and that's all I want
[59:41] hallelujah cause he can change your
[59:43] desires of your heart I mean that all
[59:45] you want is him hallelujah and I know
[59:49] that's true cuz I've experienced that
[59:51] Amen God is still God is still walking
[59:54] the voice of God is still walking upon
[59:56] the earth
[59:57] remember the gospel is not there's not a
[59:59] bunch of doctrines that are not related
[1:00:01] the gospel is a person this message is a
[1:00:04] person the Bible is a person the
[1:00:06] revelation of Jesus Christ
[1:00:08] I mean to declare himself a man it's not
[1:00:11] a bunch of ideas that we that we say is
[1:00:13] this do I agree do I disagree Joe I
[1:00:15] agree he's a person a man and he's
[1:00:18] walking upon the earth to find his
[1:00:20] children I mean to cope to to take away
[1:00:24] their sins in their own covering to
[1:00:26] cover them with his righteousness
[1:00:28] hallelujah and that's more real than me
[1:00:31] standing here right now because it's an
[1:00:33] eternal thing see it's here in
[1:00:36] Revelations 3 I just took one well this
[1:00:39] is for our age but you notice at the end
[1:00:40] of every every Church age it says to
[1:00:43] lead them here to him that have an ear
[1:00:45] let him hear what the Spirit says I mean
[1:00:47] so we're going to have spiritual ears oh
[1:00:49] god I want to hear what you're saying to
[1:00:51] this age because there's a reason you're
[1:00:53] speaking and the reason that your
[1:00:55] speaker's you want to Redeemer people
[1:00:56] you want to lift them up above the
[1:00:58] darkness hallelujah that's then that's
[1:01:01] why he speaks it's not a bunch of you
[1:01:03] know there's people who who are way more
[1:01:05] fanatic about about a twenty twenty two
[1:01:09] men kicking a circular ball around a
[1:01:12] pitch they're way more fanatic about
[1:01:14] that than they then I am about my God
[1:01:15] and the world says good on me man look
[1:01:18] at me and say you're crazy
[1:01:20] no I'm not crazy I found my mind's eye
[1:01:23] you've been brainwashed
[1:01:25] I needed a washing let's pray needed a
[1:01:27] washing that was filthy
[1:01:29] hallelujah I'm glad it got washed in the
[1:01:31] blood of Jesus Christ but people look at
[1:01:33] me and say you're mad I'm not mad I
[1:01:35] found my mind I know where I'm coming
[1:01:37] yeah I know where I've come from I know
[1:01:39] where I'm going
[1:01:40] hallelujah cuz a fan means a fanatic who
[1:01:43] are you a fanatic for being fanatic for
[1:01:46] money your job some sports something is
[1:01:48] fanatic for Jesus Christ
[1:01:50] I mean cuz because the Bible phonetic
[1:01:52] doesn't kill people and blow people up
[1:01:55] amen
[1:01:56] I was expecting more of a universal a
[1:01:59] man so well what's going on we're not
[1:02:04] starting a militia afraid not
[1:02:06] what's happening in the earth a member
[1:02:09] says behold I stand at the door and
[1:02:12] knock and if any man hear my voice he's
[1:02:15] speaking to this age If any man hear my
[1:02:17] voice man woman or child if anyone hears
[1:02:20] my voice and open the door I will come
[1:02:23] into him and sup with him and he with me
[1:02:25] to him that overcometh will I grant to
[1:02:27] sit with me in my throne even as I also
[1:02:30] overcame and sit down with my father in
[1:02:32] his throne he that hath an ear let him
[1:02:35] hear what the spirit saith unto the
[1:02:37] churches I bet you got it's not just
[1:02:39] hearing in here you got to hear in your
[1:02:41] heart something and here's got a God I
[1:02:43] begin to speak to you I mean that's what
[1:02:46] you find when the Spirit of God moves
[1:02:47] and something begins to pull you
[1:02:49] something means to move upon you can't
[1:02:51] even maybe understand it or put it into
[1:02:53] words that's God speaking to you amen
[1:02:57] and notice now for an ordered now this
[1:03:00] is this is me but in order to overcome
[1:03:03] you have to hear his voice in order to
[1:03:06] overcome this age you must hear his
[1:03:07] voice and you must open the door you
[1:03:10] can't keep the door shut because man is
[1:03:11] you know man it when when you're when
[1:03:13] God comes across a person's path they
[1:03:15] get scared just like Adam and Eve they
[1:03:17] get scared but you got to cast aside
[1:03:20] that fear
[1:03:21] I meant cast aside those things he's
[1:03:23] here to redeem you he's not here to
[1:03:25] destroy you he's not here to cast you
[1:03:27] into outer darkness he's here to take
[1:03:29] you to himself hallelujah amen and
[1:03:33] redeem you so we have must God is
[1:03:35] speaking all around the world the voice
[1:03:38] of God is walking hallelujah and as to
[1:03:41] find Adams full and race out of every
[1:03:45] kindred nation and tongue hallelujah
[1:03:47] okay and you're glad you can say I'm one
[1:03:49] of them
[1:03:51] hallelujah now it comes a time we have
[1:03:57] to we have to keep our eyes on the Lord
[1:03:59] Jesus Christ he is his word God and his
[1:04:03] word are not two separate things he is
[1:04:05] his word he is his word the Bible says
[1:04:08] in the beginning was the word and the
[1:04:10] Word was with God the Word was God and
[1:04:12] the word became flesh and dwelt among us
[1:04:14] right so that was more than just as just
[1:04:16] more than ink on paper but this this is
[1:04:18] God in print form we understand that
[1:04:20] everything God is is in this Bible right
[1:04:23] but it has to become a living reality to
[1:04:25] you the Spirit has to quicken it to you
[1:04:27] amen but here's his word you can't
[1:04:29] separate God in his word
[1:04:31] if you leave the word you've left God
[1:04:33] because he is his word but now there
[1:04:35] comes a time where where the devil or
[1:04:38] just situation of life we get distracted
[1:04:41] and we lose our focus we're going to
[1:04:44] keep our eyes on Jesus we must now we're
[1:04:49] living at a time of a resurrection who
[1:04:51] believes that we're living in a
[1:04:53] resurrection hour because the Bible says
[1:04:55] Jesus said when you see the fig tree
[1:04:57] Matthew 24 when you see the fig tree put
[1:04:59] forth its buds you know summer is nigh
[1:05:01] even at the doors that summer is the
[1:05:03] Millennium right and then so in the
[1:05:05] Bible of figs and the Bible is Israel
[1:05:08] and prophecy you go read Jeremiah 24 it
[1:05:10] speaks about it and a tree is a nation
[1:05:12] it's either a person or a nation this is
[1:05:14] when you see the factory put forth its
[1:05:16] buds when you see Israel become a nation
[1:05:18] again you know that we're at the end and
[1:05:21] they've been a nation what 70 years when
[1:05:23] nearly 70 years they've been there
[1:05:26] amen against all odds there they are
[1:05:28] because God wanted them there hallelujah
[1:05:31] so now now if they've been a nation 70
[1:05:33] years and Jesus said the generation that
[1:05:35] sees them become a nation will not pass
[1:05:38] until all things be fulfilled that
[1:05:40] generation is getting old hallelujah
[1:05:43] we're at the end of all things glory to
[1:05:46] God I mean that you shouldn't be worried
[1:05:48] about it but we're going to keep our
[1:05:49] eyes on him so now we're living in a
[1:05:52] season of the resurrection because Paul
[1:05:55] the Apostle Paul he was he thought he
[1:05:57] was talking about his age but he's
[1:05:58] talking about our age he said they were
[1:06:00] tower alive and remain when a pender
[1:06:02] will prevent in which are asleep
[1:06:04] that didn't cross the rise first and we
[1:06:06] were a child live and remain we've got
[1:06:07] to be with them to meet the Lord in the
[1:06:08] air so comfort one another with those
[1:06:11] words but then in chapter 5 Isis but of
[1:06:13] the times and seasons brethren I have no
[1:06:15] need to write of you because you know
[1:06:16] when it'll happen
[1:06:17] we're not the children of darkness with
[1:06:19] a children of light
[1:06:20] hallelujah we're not stooping around in
[1:06:22] darkness I mean we know where we are in
[1:06:25] the scripture we know where we're in
[1:06:26] time I mean so we're expecting they did
[1:06:29] in Christ arise hallelujah
[1:06:32] the next thing that the church is
[1:06:33] looking for is the resurrection of the
[1:06:35] Dead Saints so we're living in a time of
[1:06:37] resurrection hallelujah and even you who
[1:06:40] have been quickened made alive by a
[1:06:42] spirit I mean you've been resurrected
[1:06:43] from death to life hallelujah once dead
[1:06:46] in trespasses and sins now you're alive
[1:06:48] this spirit is resurrected you
[1:06:50] hallelujah see you're the sign of the
[1:06:52] resurrection as well people say how do
[1:06:54] you know Christianity works well I'll
[1:06:56] tell you what it did to me hallelujah
[1:06:58] I'm alive I was once paid I was blind I
[1:07:02] was stumbling around in this world and
[1:07:04] culture and whatever people say just
[1:07:06] went with the tide but then a voice
[1:07:08] spoke to me hallelujah now I'm alive but
[1:07:13] sometimes things happen and we wonder
[1:07:17] what's going on now so brother Branham
[1:07:21] he preaches a sermon modern events are
[1:07:23] made clear by prophecy any any reach
[1:07:25] Luke 24 at the time of the resurrection
[1:07:28] and he says these modern events because
[1:07:31] normally when you preach a sermon and
[1:07:32] hopefully I do it I don't know but the
[1:07:35] text that you that you open with you
[1:07:37] expound upon for the rest of the service
[1:07:39] that's normally the done thing so he
[1:07:43] goes to Luke 24 and he speaks about the
[1:07:45] tour on the way to Emmaus and he says
[1:07:47] the modern events these modern events
[1:07:49] all around you know what CNN is telling
[1:07:52] you not what New Zealand Herald was
[1:07:54] telling you whatever news outlet but
[1:07:56] these modern beans are made clear by the
[1:07:57] prophecy and Luke 24 is a prophecy
[1:08:01] hallelujah Luke 24 is a prophecy he says
[1:08:04] you're now living in the time of that
[1:08:05] prophecy I mean remember it's a lovely
[1:08:08] and are you got to see what he's saying
[1:08:09] what is God to him they have an ear let
[1:08:12] him hear what the Spirit says to the
[1:08:13] church and so now here we are and so
[1:08:16] this is not Luke 24 but you
[1:08:18] all of the all of the times of the death
[1:08:20] bear resurrection of Jesus Christ and
[1:08:21] you look at the believers and what
[1:08:23] they're doing you'll find yourself in
[1:08:25] there you'll find yourself in there and
[1:08:27] this is a so I was reading through the
[1:08:30] Gospels it was very interesting where
[1:08:32] John John was the only one where where
[1:08:35] it reads that where well let's just read
[1:08:39] it and I'll show you where where Jesus
[1:08:40] speaks culture by name calls her by name
[1:08:44] remember John as a as a eagle anointing
[1:08:46] on that gospel he he sees from eternity
[1:08:49] to eternity not the same as the book of
[1:08:51] markets all works okay just go straight
[1:08:54] into his ministry what he did Lucas
[1:08:55] man's wisdom Matthew is that it might be
[1:08:57] fulfilled as a lion lion anointing upon
[1:08:59] that gospel they're written differently
[1:09:00] for a purpose but now it's just John the
[1:09:03] Eagle and and and Jesus speaks but I
[1:09:07] don't want to get ahead of myself with
[1:09:09] here so John 20 and 11 to 14 but Mary
[1:09:12] stood now here we know I'll just read it
[1:09:16] and Mary stood without at the sepulchre
[1:09:17] weeping and as she were and as she wept
[1:09:21] she stooped down and looked into the
[1:09:23] sepulchre and seeth two angels in white
[1:09:26] sitting the one at the head and the
[1:09:28] other at the feet where the body of
[1:09:29] Jesus had lain and they said unto her
[1:09:33] woman why weepest thou and she said unto
[1:09:36] him Adam sorry because thou because they
[1:09:40] have taken away my Lord and I know not
[1:09:42] where they have laid him and when she
[1:09:45] had thus said she turned herself back
[1:09:47] and saw Jesus standing and knew not that
[1:09:50] it was Jesus jesus saith unto her woman
[1:09:55] why weepest thou whom seeketh del she
[1:10:00] supposing him to be the gardener saith
[1:10:02] unto him sir if thou have borne him
[1:10:05] hence tell me where thou laid him and I
[1:10:08] will take him away jesus saith unto her
[1:10:11] Mary she turned herself and saith unto
[1:10:15] Him rabboni which is they master jesus
[1:10:18] saith unto her touched me not for I have
[1:10:20] not yet ascended to my father but go to
[1:10:22] my brethren and say unto them I ascend
[1:10:24] unto my father and to your father and to
[1:10:27] my god and your God Mary Magdalene came
[1:10:29] and told the disciples
[1:10:31] that she had seen the Lord and that he
[1:10:33] had spoken these things unto her see
[1:10:37] here was here was someone living in the
[1:10:41] time of the resurrection she didn't know
[1:10:43] what was going on she was caught up
[1:10:46] member Jesus told them I'll be delivered
[1:10:48] into the hands of wicked men and and
[1:10:51] I'll be crucified I'll be killed in
[1:10:53] three days I'll raise again he told them
[1:10:55] he told them but then here she is she
[1:10:58] knew all about what it was to take
[1:11:00] spices and to anoint the dead
[1:11:02] she knew what all about death because
[1:11:04] death is a part of life she knew what it
[1:11:06] was you know like they have the Tumen
[1:11:08] and and and everything they did but then
[1:11:10] she came to the tomb now he wasn't in
[1:11:14] the tomb anymore remember he's not back
[1:11:16] in the Garden of Eden he's and and here
[1:11:19] and and here mirrors and she's caught up
[1:11:22] in her grief they've taken my we
[1:11:25] believed he'd be the Messiah we believe
[1:11:28] this is Jesus the Christ
[1:11:29] and they've take him in a way and where
[1:11:33] have you taken him tell me with and and
[1:11:35] here she is she's talking to the very
[1:11:37] resurrected Messiah but she doesn't
[1:11:40] recognize this as him and she's saying
[1:11:43] tell me where you've taken him that I
[1:11:45] can I can take him where is this word
[1:11:48] gone we know it was killed I'll take
[1:11:52] this I'll carry it and I was thinking
[1:11:54] last night I don't know how big she was
[1:11:56] but for a woman to pick up a body of a
[1:11:59] man and carry him away that would have
[1:12:01] been a hard thing to do
[1:12:02] I mean but this is where some people you
[1:12:05] know we get distracted with what's going
[1:12:07] on we don't fully understand what's
[1:12:09] going on in our walk because there's
[1:12:11] certain things happen in certain seasons
[1:12:13] in our walk with God right and we have
[1:12:16] to and he allows these things to happen
[1:12:19] here she is full of grief where have you
[1:12:21] taken him tell me where he is and all
[1:12:23] I'll carry him away and she was looking
[1:12:27] right into the eyes of the one who hang
[1:12:29] on the cross she is hanging
[1:12:31] she was looking in the eyes of the one
[1:12:33] who just paid her Sunday I mean read the
[1:12:35] keys of healthier than the grave on the
[1:12:37] side hallelujah here was the here's the
[1:12:40] sacrifice tell me where you've taken him
[1:12:42] I'll carry him away
[1:12:44] hallelujah but then the voice of God
[1:12:46] spoke hallelujah
[1:12:48] call there by name called him by name
[1:12:50] Mary then her eyes became open Oh master
[1:12:54] that's you
[1:12:57] friends we get sometimes we take our
[1:13:02] eyes we get caught up in things and we
[1:13:05] get and we miss where he is amen
[1:13:08] we're all been there but just let him
[1:13:12] speak your name amen
[1:13:15] when he when his word when his word
[1:13:17] speaks to your heart that's him calling
[1:13:19] you by name
[1:13:20] that's him calling you by name so when
[1:13:22] he was talking to the woman at the well
[1:13:24] I mean and something happened to her
[1:13:26] when when she said we know where Messiah
[1:13:28] cometh he'll do these things and then he
[1:13:31] said he that speaks to them he amen her
[1:13:33] life was transformed amen because it was
[1:13:36] more than just the audible voice of a
[1:13:38] man from Nazareth speaking but it was
[1:13:41] the voice behind the voice there's a
[1:13:43] supernatural voice speaking hallelujah
[1:13:45] like Peter James and John Lee said to
[1:13:47] whom shall we go you alone have the
[1:13:49] words of eternal life I mean but the
[1:13:52] scribes and Pharisees they heard the
[1:13:54] same words they said this is Beelzebub
[1:13:56] away with such a man amen but the other
[1:13:59] said this is the word of eternal life
[1:14:01] come hallelujah because they heard the
[1:14:03] voice amen and he is the same yesterday
[1:14:07] today and forever the same God that was
[1:14:10] back there as present this morning
[1:14:12] Alleluia and said now here she is this I
[1:14:18] wish I could you know he said Mary one
[1:14:22] word and she realized this is the master
[1:14:25] speaking this is not a gardener this is
[1:14:27] not someone's idea this is not something
[1:14:30] that just happens on this day after the
[1:14:31] Sabbath I mean this is the resurrected
[1:14:34] one hallelujah it's the same thing here
[1:14:36] this morning friends I pray hallelujah
[1:14:38] is more than a gardener who's the one
[1:14:41] that speaks to you who's the one when
[1:14:42] you read the word or hear the message
[1:14:44] and it anchors into your soul amen and
[1:14:46] you've come to realize I'm a son or
[1:14:50] daughter of the king hallelujah I know
[1:14:52] ruff come from I know where I'm going
[1:14:55] it's him made you being here yo you're
[1:14:57] so broken I brought spices and the
[1:15:00] tumors open and angels who spoke to me I
[1:15:03] have no idea where he is I just want to
[1:15:04] find him that's all she wanted she
[1:15:06] didn't want to speak to angels she want
[1:15:08] to find him where is he
[1:15:10] Koli and she said broken and she sees
[1:15:12] this one a gardener she thinks where
[1:15:15] have you taken him I want to go to where
[1:15:17] he is and then one word changes their
[1:15:19] whole life hello you're not dead here

[1:16:44] missus like when the Lord came and spoke
[1:16:46] to Adam and Eve that word Lord God as as
[1:16:49] as as the self-existing one who
[1:16:52] expresses himself you go look in the
[1:16:54] Hebrew it means something like that and
[1:16:56] it says what it wants a relationship

[1:17:09] word hallelujah my sheep and I'll come
[1:17:12] to that later know my voice now this is
[1:17:15] from a message spiritual amnesia this is
[1:17:19] from there's my brother BAM he's
[1:17:20] speaking of he speaking of soldiers that
[1:17:24] got shell-shocked and they lost their
[1:17:26] minds they didn't know who they were
[1:17:27] anymore they being transported to a
[1:17:29] mental asylum
[1:17:30] since they're going up the hillside
[1:17:31] train pulling and they stopped at a
[1:17:33] station let the boys get out and stretch
[1:17:35] their legs and the guards go out on the
[1:17:38] hill to watch them because with amnesia
[1:17:40] you had to watch them so they watched
[1:17:44] one young fellow he got out he began to
[1:17:47] look around at the water tank looked
[1:17:49] around looked all around over the hill
[1:17:51] he rubbed his face he studied he looked
[1:17:53] again he's seen that water tank he
[1:17:55] stopped all around at the station he
[1:17:58] started walking and stared of the guys
[1:18:00] stopping him he followed him he went up
[1:18:04] over the hill down a little path turned
[1:18:08] to the right went over another little
[1:18:09] hill came to a little log cabin he
[1:18:11] looked coming out on the porch an old
[1:18:13] man with a cane in his hand came out and
[1:18:15] throwed his arms around him said my son
[1:18:18] I know you would return they told me you
[1:18:20] were dead but I know you would return
[1:18:22] and the boy came to himself has amnesia
[1:18:25] left him he could identify who he was he
[1:18:29] knowed that that was his father and it's
[1:18:32] the same thing with us we come into this
[1:18:34] world we have no idea who we really are
[1:18:36] I mean we are we're just wandering
[1:18:38] around in darkness but then but then the
[1:18:40] Bible becomes becomes open to us and we
[1:18:43] begin to see familiar places something
[1:18:45] in a sense I can identify with the
[1:18:47] Rebecca I can identify with Esther I can
[1:18:50] identify with Ruth I can identify with
[1:18:53] the woman at the well I mean I can
[1:18:55] identify with Rahab hallelujah I can
[1:18:57] identify with Peter James and John
[1:18:59] something in us begins to something
[1:19:01] begins to awaken I mean but don't you
[1:19:04] stay there go all the way to father's
[1:19:05] house I mean because he's waiting for
[1:19:08] you to return
[1:19:08] I mean he's waiting for you to return
[1:19:10] hallelujah because because when the
[1:19:12] soldier was still on the path maybe
[1:19:14] someone could have knocked him off the
[1:19:15] path and he could have forgotten where
[1:19:17] he was hallelujah
[1:19:18] but the guys just just followed of
[1:19:20] Maidan and they didn't interfere but
[1:19:22] then winners when his father came
[1:19:24] embraced his son then his Ebenezer left
[1:19:27] him
[1:19:28] hallelujah then he knew that that was
[1:19:30] his father and who he was just let the
[1:19:32] Lord Jesus embrace you one time amen and
[1:19:35] you'll know who you are you'll know who
[1:19:37] your father is you'll know who your
[1:19:39] bridegroom is I mean you know he's paid
[1:19:41] it all hallelujah
[1:19:43] isn't that right Oh soldier of the Cross
[1:19:47] that's been shocked with so much
[1:19:49] training so many shocks of denominations
[1:19:52] and Creed and things of the world why
[1:19:54] don't you step off for a few minutes and
[1:19:56] go looking around at the Bible amen
[1:19:59] might wander around you might find
[1:20:01] yourself identified here in the word as
[1:20:04] a believer one of these days you might
[1:20:06] not know him you may come to yourself
[1:20:08] like the prodigal son didn't find
[1:20:10] yourself you might find your
[1:20:12] identification in the words of God he
[1:20:17] says listen when a man marries a wife he
[1:20:19] doesn't trust in her beauty no he trusts
[1:20:21] in the loyalty of her vow her word he
[1:20:23] doesn't trust in her beauty he trusts in
[1:20:25] her loyalty this is the same same sermon
[1:20:27] and that's the way when you when you're
[1:20:30] married to God you don't trust in some
[1:20:32] big beautiful church you can build but
[1:20:34] in the promise that Jesus Christ made
[1:20:36] that I am the same yesterday today and
[1:20:39] forever do you believe that hallelujah
[1:20:43] that's what we trusted I mean we're not
[1:20:45] trusting in anything else because if
[1:20:48] he's the same yesterday today and
[1:20:49] forever then he will guide us all the
[1:20:51] way a man will be will be led by the
[1:20:54] Shepherd's voice the great Shepherd's
[1:20:56] voice will lead us personally and if
[1:20:58] he's leading us amen we can never be
[1:21:00] lost
[1:21:01] amen if he's leading us things may
[1:21:03] appear to go sideways but he's in the
[1:21:05] sideways I mean he's in the situation
[1:21:08] but you've got to have confidence Lord
[1:21:10] you're leading me down this way and then
[1:21:12] and if I've stepped off the path in my
[1:21:14] own ability Lord forgive me and give me
[1:21:16] back on the road Alleluia says in John
[1:21:21] 10 1 2 5 says verily verily I say unto
[1:21:24] you he that entereth not by the door
[1:21:26] into the into the sheepfold but climbeth
[1:21:28] up some other way the same as a thief
[1:21:31] and a robber
[1:21:32] but he did injure them by the door as
[1:21:34] the as the Shepherd of the sheep to him
[1:21:38] the porter openeth and the sheep hear
[1:21:39] his voice and he calls his own sheep by
[1:21:42] name hello hello sheep he amen
[1:21:47] so his sheep hear his voice I have heard
[1:21:51] his voice and you're still hearing his
[1:21:53] voice I mean any call of his own sheep
[1:21:55] by name and leadeth them out amen I love
[1:22:00] I trust this mean something to you amen
[1:22:03] you're being lead hallelujah have you
[1:22:06] come in through the door Jesus is the
[1:22:09] door repent be baptized name of Lord
[1:22:11] Jesus Christ remission of sin and you
[1:22:13] shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost
[1:22:14] that is the door that is the way into
[1:22:17] the sheepfold amen I trust you've come
[1:22:20] in that way I don't want to come in
[1:22:22] through a window I want to come in goss
[1:22:23] provided way hallelujah and when he
[1:22:27] putteth forth as sheep he goes before
[1:22:29] them and the Sheep follow him and they
[1:22:32] know his voice and a stranger they will
[1:22:34] not follow but will flee from him for
[1:22:36] they know not the voice of strangers
[1:22:38] I trust you fallen in love with the
[1:22:41] voice the voice of God when the voice of
[1:22:43] God speaks to you Amen because if you
[1:22:46] really know you know it's like um some
[1:22:51] people major on all the bad of
[1:22:52] everything else we don't need to do that
[1:22:54] it's like someone who who can detect
[1:22:58] counterfeit money they just study the
[1:23:00] genuine they study the genuine enough
[1:23:02] and then they can detect the counterfeit
[1:23:04] right there should be the same thing
[1:23:06] with us we should so know him in his
[1:23:08] word not not just mental memorization of
[1:23:14] Scripture but we should so no man has
[1:23:15] word that when the canif it comes our
[1:23:17] way we should be able to know the
[1:23:18] counterfeit as in their right we should
[1:23:21] we should have a personal relationship
[1:23:22] with him and his word guide us in your
[1:23:25] word God a man I trust that's your
[1:23:28] prayer this is not a dead letter I pray
[1:23:30] it's not to you this is a living book
[1:23:32] Alleluia because it's him and a stranger
[1:23:37] or not follow but will flee from him
[1:23:39] they know not the voice of strangers I
[1:23:42] was going to drop down to verse see of
[1:23:44] him
[1:23:45] and then jesus said unto them again veil
[1:23:47] evil I said to you I am the door of the
[1:23:49] Sheep all that ever come before me are
[1:23:52] thieves and robbers but the Sheep did
[1:23:53] not hear them I am the door By Me If any
[1:23:56] man enter in he shall be saved and shall
[1:23:58] go in and out and find pasture amen
[1:24:01] hoose who's got spiritual food
[1:24:03] hallelujah the thief cometh not but to
[1:24:06] steal and to kill and to destroy I came
[1:24:08] that they might have life and they might
[1:24:11] have it more abundantly
[1:24:13] hallelujah and that abundant life is not
[1:24:16] material things even though that make
[1:24:18] him come with it but that abundant life
[1:24:20] is his life in you hallelujah when you
[1:24:22] don't know the way his spirit comes down
[1:24:24] and he leads and guides you into all
[1:24:26] truth you say that's crazy to say God
[1:24:29] speaks to people God still speaks to
[1:24:31] people amen and as I said it doesn't
[1:24:33] make us go kill a bunch of people
[1:24:35] because that's not according to his word
[1:24:37] if the word says thou shalt not kill
[1:24:38] then how can someone say God told me to
[1:24:40] go killed someone because the voice is
[1:24:42] not according to his word Amen this way
[1:24:46] you got to know you know is it really
[1:24:48] you God he'll show you I mean that we
[1:24:51] would have life and life more abundantly
[1:24:54] he says I'm the Good Shepherd and the
[1:24:57] Good Shepherd give us his life for the
[1:24:59] Sheep but he that is a hireling and not
[1:25:02] the Shepherd who whose own the sheep are
[1:25:04] not see it the wolf coming and leave
[1:25:06] with the Sheep and flee a--the and the
[1:25:08] wolf catches them and scatters the Sheep
[1:25:10] the huiling flee it's because he is a
[1:25:12] hireling and careth not for the Sheep
[1:25:13] I'm the Good Shepherd and know my sheep
[1:25:16] and am known of mine and that means he
[1:25:19] knows you and you know him hallelujah
[1:25:21] and he won't lose one of his sheep he
[1:25:24] cannot leave he cannot lose a part of
[1:25:26] himself he cannot I mean the devil says
[1:25:29] I'm going to drag the sons and daughters
[1:25:30] away I mean but God says you I won't
[1:25:33] lose one I mean they're all going to
[1:25:35] come all that the father has given me
[1:25:37] will come and all that come to me all no
[1:25:40] wise cast out I mean so you've already
[1:25:42] been given your mouth so just come I
[1:25:44] mean why why fight the pulp
[1:25:47] why Grievous spurt I mean just say hey
[1:25:49] Lord Jesus I come
[1:25:50] amen personally if I had a million
[1:25:53] life's to live I love them all for him
[1:25:55] I mean I would it's worth it you mean
[1:25:58] this hardship and whatever more I don't
[1:26:00] care about those things the Apostle Paul
[1:26:03] said I was shipwrecked I was stoned I
[1:26:05] was beaten I was all kinds of things
[1:26:06] happen
[1:26:07] I was hungry else whatever more he says
[1:26:09] none of these things move me because he
[1:26:11] kept his eyes on Jesus he kept his eyes
[1:26:13] on his word he kept his eyes on the
[1:26:15] Commission that he received I mean he
[1:26:17] comes too near the end of his Road he
[1:26:19] says I was not disobedient he speaks to
[1:26:21] King Agrippa
[1:26:22] I was not disobedient to the heavenly
[1:26:24] vision amen he kept his course true and
[1:26:28] he fought you know he says he fought the
[1:26:30] beast at Ephesus they weren't wild
[1:26:32] animals that was religious spirits and
[1:26:34] people amen but he had to fight those
[1:26:37] here you know here it just dangers with
[1:26:38] an end without and sometimes things just
[1:26:41] happened to him he didn't understand why
[1:26:42] it happened he just walked gone and
[1:26:44] we've been restored back to the original
[1:26:46] faith of the fathers hallelujah so if
[1:26:49] the Apostle Paul a man can walk and and
[1:26:52] I've never been shipwrecked I've never
[1:26:55] been beaten I've never been robbed or
[1:26:57] mugged or whatever you know whatever he
[1:26:59] lists I never received stripes you know
[1:27:01] like he did he says none of these things
[1:27:04] move me because he kept his eyes you got
[1:27:07] a he kept his eyes on his commission
[1:27:10] I've been called for this purpose I've
[1:27:13] been called to be a light to the
[1:27:15] Gentiles this is why he was called and
[1:27:17] he says I was not disobedient to the
[1:27:19] heavenly vision Alleluia he said none of
[1:27:22] these things move me now how about you
[1:27:24] you say well I'm not the Apostle Paul
[1:27:26] but you're still cold you're still being
[1:27:28] commissioned I mean to be a living
[1:27:30] epistle I mean that the Word of God
[1:27:33] would manifest itself out of you I mean
[1:27:35] to be a life of this dying world you've
[1:27:37] been commissioned you have been called
[1:27:38] and you've been seen I mean as Jesus
[1:27:41] sent His disciples he sends you Alleluia
[1:27:44] so we shouldn't worry about what's you
[1:27:46] know keep your eyes on his word keep
[1:27:50] your eyes what does he called you to be
[1:27:51] a man he's called you to be the Bride of
[1:27:54] Christ
[1:27:56] Alleluia keep your eyes on him no matter
[1:27:59] what where are you Shepherd you know
[1:28:01] sheep there's all different kinds of
[1:28:04] sheep you know we you know man I think
[1:28:08] nowadays we look at sheep
[1:28:10] you know they're just all the same
[1:28:11] temperament but then when you think of
[1:28:13] horses your animals have all different
[1:28:14] kind of personality you know man
[1:28:16] man actively breeds this horse in this
[1:28:18] horse because the temperament you know
[1:28:20] he wants the temperament of the parents
[1:28:21] to come down into the children because
[1:28:24] because some horses they've got a real
[1:28:25] wild temperament you can't ride them but
[1:28:28] those who got gentle meek temperaments
[1:28:30] he said I want that one and I want that
[1:28:32] one to breed with this one to keep that
[1:28:34] down all sheep sheep have different
[1:28:37] temperaments as well dogs are different
[1:28:39] temperaments you know there's some some
[1:28:41] sheep that are more blessed than other
[1:28:43] sheep you say but they sheep they're all
[1:28:45] blessed now but in the range of sheep
[1:28:47] this wild sheep more more independent
[1:28:49] crazy sheep and there's more placid ones
[1:28:50] but they're still sheep right you
[1:28:53] understand we're all you know because
[1:28:55] it's the same thing with human beings as
[1:28:56] long as you're one of us sheep I'm it
[1:28:59] doesn't matter what temperament you have
[1:29:01] I'm not saying these things you know I
[1:29:03] want you under the yoke
[1:29:04] because we look at a field we say are
[1:29:05] they just all the same they look all the
[1:29:07] same how do you do but in the Old
[1:29:10] Testament they the Shepherd knew their
[1:29:12] sheep by name they didn't use dogs like
[1:29:14] we do here in New Zealand they called
[1:29:17] them by name and they followed the Sheep
[1:29:19] followed him I mean because the ship had
[1:29:22] had a relationship with the Sheep and
[1:29:23] when the Shepherd saw another another
[1:29:28] thing with two legs walking along
[1:29:30] calling them by name something Emma said
[1:29:32] that's not my shepherd but then when
[1:29:34] another two-legged individual came along
[1:29:35] and call them by name they said I know
[1:29:37] that voice their voice was there at my
[1:29:40] birth their voice was there when I was
[1:29:42] separated maybe from my mum hallelujah
[1:29:45] that voice was there when I was shown
[1:29:46] the first time I mean their voice called
[1:29:48] me and lead me to another field and
[1:29:50] because this field the grass is drying
[1:29:52] up hallelujah as the same thing with us
[1:29:54] God's voice is here when we're birthed
[1:29:56] into the kingdom hallelujah the yo his
[1:29:59] voice was here when he called us to have
[1:30:01] a more personal walk with him hallelujah
[1:30:03] his voice is here when he calls us to
[1:30:05] another field I mean eat this part of
[1:30:08] the word hallelujah have the spiritual
[1:30:11] food amen
[1:30:13] but as long as we're sheep don't worry
[1:30:17] about you know as everyone a sheep here
[1:30:20] do you believe you're a sheep
[1:30:22] doesn't matter what you think about
[1:30:23] yourself you know and what kind of sheep
[1:30:26] as long as you're a sheep that's the
[1:30:28] main thing if you're a sheep you're in
[1:30:30] I'll put it that way because if you're a
[1:30:31] god you can't get in right but who
[1:30:34] believes they're a sheep you're gonna
[1:30:36] say Lord I'm a sheep hallelujah I'm one
[1:30:39] of your sheep you are my shepherd and
[1:30:41] I'm your sheep hallelujah amen that's
[1:30:46] that's just how this is what it boils
[1:30:48] down to it cuz he says I know my sheep
[1:30:49] my sheep hear my voice is stranger
[1:30:51] they'll not follow I know my sheep and
[1:30:53] they're known of me he doesn't speak
[1:30:55] about any other category of animal my
[1:30:57] sheep as long as we wanted the Sheep
[1:31:00] hallelujah now the problem is its when
[1:31:07] trouble arises there's the challenge why
[1:31:11] do we read that we did
[1:31:17] I says here sorry as the father knoweth
[1:31:20] me even so either father and I lay my
[1:31:23] life down for the Sheep and other sheep
[1:31:25] I have which are not of this fold them
[1:31:29] also I must bring now you gotta when you
[1:31:33] read this you say he's talking about me
[1:31:37] he's talking about how does he know
[1:31:39] about me he knows everything about
[1:31:40] everyone right
[1:31:42] amen and there shall be one fold and one
[1:31:44] Shepherd well and they shall hear my
[1:31:46] voice sorry and there shall be one fold
[1:31:48] and one Shepherd therefore does my
[1:31:50] father love me because I lay down my
[1:31:52] life that I might take it again no man
[1:31:55] taketh it from me but I lay it down of
[1:31:56] myself I have power to lay it down and
[1:31:59] other power to take it up again this
[1:32:01] commandment have I received in my father
[1:32:03] so he says there are other sheep that
[1:32:06] are not of this fault also I must bring
[1:32:08] and they shall hear my voice and there
[1:32:11] shall be one fold and one Shepherd
[1:32:13] hallelujah so he's talking about you
[1:32:16] it's not just a nice story he's talking
[1:32:18] about you yeah you weren't there 2,000
[1:32:20] years ago when the disciples were
[1:32:22] gathered around them I mean you're here
[1:32:24] in 2017 but you're still sheep
[1:32:28] hallelujah he says you must hear my you
[1:32:30] must hear my voice I must bring them
[1:32:33] into the sheepfold holy oh you know a
[1:32:35] sheep who's ever done nagging before
[1:32:38] who's ever cut lambs tails off anyone I
[1:32:42] see a big whose about 11 here he's about
[1:32:46] 11 yep oh I was your size probably not
[1:32:50] as big actually lambs see sheep lamps
[1:32:53] you know when you because you pick them
[1:32:55] up by the bow by the hind leg so so
[1:32:58] they're back so you pick up by the hind
[1:33:00] legs like this and then you and you take
[1:33:01] them to thee to the fence and then
[1:33:03] someone else cuts the cuts off the towel
[1:33:05] whatever more now I'm gonna live in your
[1:33:08] old boy you can pick up a sheep pick up
[1:33:10] a lamb now if you've got them in a real
[1:33:12] firm hold they don't struggle but if you
[1:33:14] hold them loosely they begin to kick but
[1:33:16] it's just a look you got a little bit of
[1:33:18] pressure and they stopped struggling no
[1:33:21] it's the same thing with us he's got you
[1:33:24] because if the lamb thinks you know I
[1:33:26] don't have him he's gonna kick and try
[1:33:28] and get free listen he knows hey
[1:33:30] things got me he's got you amen he's got
[1:33:35] you now you're not here to be dag door
[1:33:37] or towels to be cut off but you got to
[1:33:40] have confidence you got to have
[1:33:41] confidence whose hands are my in whose
[1:33:44] hands are my in I'm not in some man's
[1:33:46] hands I'm in God's hands amen and he's
[1:33:49] picked me up for a reason he's picked me
[1:33:52] up to bring me to bring me into a
[1:33:54] sheepfold hallelujah you just got to
[1:33:56] know the arms of the one at the Shepherd
[1:33:59] Amen do you know those arms hello Lucas
[1:34:02] all these are eternal arms I mean
[1:34:04] they're been searching for me you know
[1:34:06] sometimes is a muster and and there'll
[1:34:08] be most of the Shepherd's will go and
[1:34:09] get most of the sheep but then there's a
[1:34:11] few that come afterwards two or three
[1:34:13] times to find the ones that are that
[1:34:15] that didn't go with the first part of
[1:34:17] the herd hallelujah and sometimes it's
[1:34:21] like that we can just be wandering
[1:34:22] around just us because this is actually
[1:34:25] the main must has gone through the world
[1:34:27] and it's just ones and twos around the
[1:34:30] place and we can do he's wandering but
[1:34:33] the shoe the chief shepherd knows I have
[1:34:35] so many sheep he's not a human Shepherd
[1:34:38] because human shipments can be sometimes
[1:34:41] or she'll be right there's maybe one or
[1:34:44] two out there in the Hills we'll get
[1:34:45] them next season God isn't wanting to
[1:34:47] wait for a next season there's no next
[1:34:49] season there's only this one season and
[1:34:51] he knows how many sheep should be in the
[1:34:53] paddocks have been done on the valleys
[1:34:55] hallelujah so so he sends his
[1:34:57] shepherds he sends his Holy Spirit of
[1:35:00] the Shepherd's find those Lambs find
[1:35:03] those sheep hallelujah and God has a
[1:35:06] determination they will be there but you
[1:35:08] could have confidence in your shepherd
[1:35:10] you gotta have confidence these hands
[1:35:12] that have me and it's not just and I
[1:35:15] haven't been taken against my will
[1:35:16] I've gladly said Lord take my life and
[1:35:18] make it though I mean you got to have
[1:35:21] confidence and the one that's leading
[1:35:23] and guiding you amen
[1:35:26] that's his who hath believed our report
[1:35:29] and to whom is the arm of the Lord
[1:35:31] revealed while those who believers
[1:35:33] report as the arm of the Lord been
[1:35:34] revealed to write for he shall grow up
[1:35:37] before him now this is prophecy of Jesus
[1:35:39] coming he shall grow perform as a tender
[1:35:41] plant and as a root out of a dry ground
[1:35:44] he has no form nor comeliness and when
[1:35:46] we shall see him there is no beauty that
[1:35:49] we should desire him he is despised and
[1:35:53] rejected of men a man of sorrows and
[1:35:55] antiquated with grief and we hid as it
[1:35:58] were our faces from him I'll stop there
[1:36:02] it says he's he he's acquainted with
[1:36:05] grief now if you're acquainted with
[1:36:06] something you not really well and now so
[1:36:10] he knows he knows your pain he knows
[1:36:12] your sadness he knows your you know he
[1:36:15] knows what you're going through why did
[1:36:17] why did God become a man that he would
[1:36:19] understand you that he would experience
[1:36:22] the same things you go through I mean
[1:36:24] that he would know what it means to be
[1:36:25] rejected he would know what it's means
[1:36:27] to lose loved ones but Joseph Joseph was
[1:36:30] there when he was born but when Jesus
[1:36:32] comes into his ministry where's Joseph
[1:36:34] he died he knows what it is to be
[1:36:37] misunderstood he knows what it means to
[1:36:39] stick out in a crowd I mean he knows
[1:36:42] what it's like and we begin to think
[1:36:44] well no one understands me he
[1:36:46] understands you if none can relate to
[1:36:48] you in here he can relate to you amen
[1:36:51] but the thing is if you don't know that
[1:36:53] then you won't turn to him hallelujah
[1:36:55] but you got to recognize he knows what
[1:36:57] you've been through amen so he's a man
[1:37:01] that was acquainted with grief and we
[1:37:03] hid as it were our faces from him he was
[1:37:05] despised and we esteemed him not
[1:37:07] surely he hath borne our griefs and
[1:37:09] carried our sorrows yet we did esteem
[1:37:11] him stricken smitten of God and
[1:37:14] afflicted but he was wounded for our
[1:37:17] transgressions he was bruised for our
[1:37:20] iniquities the chastisement of our peace
[1:37:22] was upon him and with the stripes we are
[1:37:25] healed all we like sheep have gone
[1:37:29] astray we have turned every one to his
[1:37:33] own way and the LORD hath laid on him
[1:37:35] the iniquity of us all he was oppressed
[1:37:38] and he was afflicted yet he opened not
[1:37:40] his mouth
[1:37:41] he has brought as a lamb to the
[1:37:43] slaughter and as a sheep before her
[1:37:45] Shearer's is dumb so he opened not his
[1:37:47] mouth now we're going to read the whole
[1:37:49] chapter but read the whole chapter of
[1:37:51] speaks of him now I underline this for a
[1:37:53] reason we are like sheep that have gone
[1:37:56] astray now if
[1:37:58] who has ever moved sheep who's ever been
[1:38:00] on a farm who's even moved sheep down
[1:38:04] the road to other paddocks yes you've
[1:38:06] got to keep your eyes on them me and my
[1:38:08] brother we were we were yay big 11 he
[1:38:11] was a bit older we had a four-wheeler
[1:38:13] and my uncle said take the I know a few
[1:38:16] hundred sheep take them from this
[1:38:17] paddock down to this paddock you got to
[1:38:19] watch them you got to watch them because
[1:38:22] they just start wandering they start
[1:38:23] eating grass and you know they just
[1:38:25] they're just cruising along you got to
[1:38:27] keep your eyes because you had to give
[1:38:29] them to that paddock and now if there
[1:38:31] wasn't fences there then then they just
[1:38:34] wander off and I'd wander off somewhere
[1:38:36] they'd just keep wondering because they
[1:38:37] go their own way because they're sheep
[1:38:40] that are going astray now we're all
[1:38:42] sheep now the main thing is we're sheep
[1:38:45] we've all gone astray but the main thing
[1:38:48] is your sheep right you may you may get
[1:38:51] caught in a and a blackberry bush or
[1:38:53] something and be stuck and maybe be the
[1:38:56] wounded or hurt but you're still the
[1:38:57] Sheep and you may have caused yourself
[1:38:59] to end up that way but you're still a
[1:39:01] sheep I mean what are you looking at who
[1:39:04] you are or or what's happened to you
[1:39:06] because if you look at what's happening
[1:39:08] to you then you'll stay there in that
[1:39:09] state but if you say I'm a sheep
[1:39:11] therefore the Shepherds got to find me
[1:39:13] he'll find you I mean you he'll hear
[1:39:17] you're bleeding or whatever it is when
[1:39:18] you're stuck help me I'm down a crevasse
[1:39:21] hallelujah but I'm a sheep what do you
[1:39:24] what are you looking at I'm a sheep
[1:39:27] glory if I go astray by my own humanity
[1:39:30] he'll he'll bring me back on the path I
[1:39:33] may pay for the straying but he'll bring
[1:39:34] me back hallelujah because I'm a sheep
[1:39:37] I'm glad I'm a sheep I mean I bet you
[1:39:40] all these young children here if they
[1:39:42] sit you know if we ask them what animal
[1:39:44] do you want to be if you could be an
[1:39:45] animal
[1:39:45] none of them would say sheep but praise
[1:39:48] God I'm a sheep I'm so glad I'm a sheep
[1:39:51] so they've all turned everyone to his
[1:39:54] own way now this is this is an Hebrew
[1:39:59] this this would way the definition is a
[1:40:01] road is trodden fricative lay a course
[1:40:05] of life or a mode of action so a course
[1:40:07] of life as a direction you go so it's a
[1:40:09] road that is trodden
[1:40:11] now what this means is that when we go
[1:40:15] astray we start to go down familiar
[1:40:17] roads that we used to walk down before
[1:40:19] the Lord lead us there now thinking and
[1:40:22] and and you know like for example of you
[1:40:24] know carnality can come in and then what
[1:40:28] we used to do before we met the Lord we
[1:40:30] start doing it again and and how we
[1:40:32] think and we take on our own because we
[1:40:34] then we begin to think now what road do
[1:40:37] I have to take oh I know this road I've
[1:40:39] been doing it before but then because
[1:40:41] we're sheep we forget where the road
[1:40:43] takes us and we and it lead us to ruin
[1:40:47] the first time but then we keep walking
[1:40:49] down it amen because we we work out what
[1:40:53] what we're gonna do and you've taken if
[1:40:55] you going your own way you've taken your
[1:40:57] eyes off the shepherd we must never take
[1:41:01] our eyes off Jesus if we tap if we have
[1:41:03] our eyes on someone else you've taken
[1:41:05] your eyes off Jesus I mean if we if we
[1:41:07] have our eyes on our brothers and
[1:41:08] sisters our eyes are off Jesus and where
[1:41:11] do you go you go your own way and where
[1:41:14] is that way it's not his way amen it's
[1:41:19] just wood let's just jump to that one
[1:41:21] I'm gonna come back but we'll go here
[1:41:22] it says this is second Corinthians for
[1:41:26] we dare not make ourselves of the number
[1:41:29] or compare ourselves with some that
[1:41:32] commend themselves but they measuring
[1:41:34] themselves by themselves and comparing
[1:41:36] themselves among themselves are not wise
[1:41:38] so we dear he says we dare not make
[1:41:41] ourselves the number or compare
[1:41:44] ourselves with some that commend
[1:41:45] themselves oh look at me I'm the best
[1:41:48] sheep in the paddock look at me I can
[1:41:51] jump higher than everyone else look at
[1:41:53] me if you look at that sheep you're not
[1:41:56] wise and they're not wise as well I'm
[1:41:59] the best believer look at me I'm the
[1:42:01] best one that person is unwise and if
[1:42:04] you're looking at them you're unwise
[1:42:05] because your eyes are on the wrong
[1:42:07] person your eyes are on the wrong person
[1:42:09] if your eyes are on them then your eyes
[1:42:11] will not be on the Shepherd and you will
[1:42:13] go your own way
[1:42:15] amen if we compare ourselves with
[1:42:17] ourselves we're not wise what does that
[1:42:18] mean you foolish this is this is our
[1:42:22] mirror this is our comparison
[1:42:25] and to me the message in the Bible are
[1:42:27] the same because they are as Jesus
[1:42:28] Christ amen so when we read this it
[1:42:31] shouldn't be I want to gain knowledge
[1:42:33] it's Lord I lay myself at your feet and
[1:42:35] change me that the character nature of
[1:42:37] you in this word aiming comes into me
[1:42:39] that's what it should be so we've got to
[1:42:45] keep our eyes on the shepherd whatever
[1:42:46] you do let's go back now I talked about
[1:42:50] this on Wednesday but the disciples were
[1:42:54] traveling in a boat one day if one knows
[1:42:57] the story brother and peaches are sermon
[1:42:59] go awake Jesus or calling Jesus on the
[1:43:01] scene and now these these disciples they
[1:43:08] knew the boat very well they were born
[1:43:10] and raised as fishermen they knew the
[1:43:13] boat maybe they built the boat maybe
[1:43:14] they laid the keel of the boat they knew
[1:43:16] how it handled they knew the conditions
[1:43:17] on the sea but then there came a point
[1:43:21] they had Jesus with them and this is
[1:43:23] where we this is where if we if we try
[1:43:27] and take everything under our own
[1:43:29] control will sink will sink i I used to
[1:43:33] race sailing boats growing up and those
[1:43:37] boats are designed to capsize because
[1:43:39] you can get them up again I remember
[1:43:40] many times sailing and and and the and
[1:43:44] the windier it gets the the the more
[1:43:48] likely it is I mean the it's like you're
[1:43:51] sailing on a Razors Edge and just one
[1:43:54] small mistake and you'll be over the
[1:43:55] windier it gets so the greater the storm
[1:43:57] the more quickly you can get real
[1:43:59] dangerous there are some times I'll be
[1:44:01] sailing along the bow the boat goes into
[1:44:04] the yo nose dives I'm throwing out one
[1:44:08] side and the boat flips over and I've
[1:44:11] got to swim to try and catch my boat and
[1:44:14] I was telling myself I'm having fun I
[1:44:16] was having fun but do you see that boats
[1:44:19] designed to be righted again they're
[1:44:22] fishing boats were made that way if they
[1:44:24] capsized they sunk and it's the same
[1:44:27] thing with us
[1:44:28] are you with me we don't want to just
[1:44:31] enjoy nose diving into waves because
[1:44:35] their boat wasn't designed to
[1:44:38] to be righted again now see Sam when he
[1:44:41] entered into the ship as disciples
[1:44:42] followed him and behold there arose a
[1:44:44] great tempest in the sea and so much
[1:44:46] that the ship was covered with the waves
[1:44:48] but he was asleep and his disciples
[1:44:50] candles here to welcome saying the lord
[1:44:52] save us we perish and he saith unto them
[1:44:55] why are ye fearful o ye of little faith
[1:44:57] then he arose and rebuked the winds and
[1:44:59] the sea and there was a great calm but
[1:45:02] they mean marveled saying what manner of
[1:45:03] man is this that even the wind's and the
[1:45:05] sea obey Him now in a storm
[1:45:09] it is normally there's not my gusts of
[1:45:12] wind first is a gust I think goes a
[1:45:15] little bit coming is another gust and
[1:45:17] then as the gusts come they they start
[1:45:19] coming closer and closer together until
[1:45:20] it's just blowing a gale that's what
[1:45:23] happens when a storm come when when the
[1:45:25] weather rapidly changes on the sea and
[1:45:27] so now the first Gus you see these these
[1:45:30] disciples they knew what it's like for a
[1:45:31] storm to come onto the Sea of Galilee
[1:45:32] they knew was like to handle the ship in
[1:45:35] a storm and many times we can say well
[1:45:38] I've been through something like this
[1:45:40] before I can handle the situation but
[1:45:42] they came a point where all of their all
[1:45:44] of their seafaring knowledge all their
[1:45:46] ability to to you know bail the water
[1:45:49] out of the boat
[1:45:50] who's bailed water out of a boat he
[1:45:53] comes the point where you can't you're
[1:45:55] you cannot bail it out faster than it's
[1:45:57] coming in but their own ability oh I'll
[1:45:59] fix this problem I've got some problem
[1:46:02] with my brother or sister or something's
[1:46:03] going on I'm going to battle the water
[1:46:05] I'm going to fix the problem I mean I'm
[1:46:08] gonna I'm going to trim the sails you
[1:46:10] know then that we're gonna stay afloat
[1:46:11] I'm going to roll it a little bit but
[1:46:13] they had came to a point master don't
[1:46:15] you care that we perish and it's the
[1:46:17] same thing with you and I he's in the
[1:46:19] boat
[1:46:20] I mean we're having fellowship it's two
[1:46:23] fellows in a ship that's the definition
[1:46:25] of fellowship hallelujah that's what I
[1:46:29] think brother Baxter seed to brother
[1:46:30] branham I can't remember but that's what
[1:46:31] it is we're all in the same ship the
[1:46:34] gospel ship he's in the boat I mean we
[1:46:38] just got to wake him up hallelujah
[1:46:41] don't try and Oh things are going
[1:46:43] sideways in life don't you try and fix
[1:46:45] it you say lord help me or I'll perish
[1:46:47] and then if you're really neutral about
[1:46:50] the whole thing you'll say no
[1:46:51] do this on this and you and he'll guide
[1:46:52] you through the trial but if you still
[1:46:54] have your mind set on something no I
[1:46:56] still actually want to do this but Lord
[1:46:58] guide me in your word and help me in
[1:47:00] this problem but in your mind you want
[1:47:01] to do a certain thing he were he can't
[1:47:04] guide you because you your mind is made
[1:47:07] up
[1:47:07] but if you're really neutral in the
[1:47:09] whole thing he'll say do this in this
[1:47:11] and then you say yes Lord amen
[1:47:14] we're going to wake him up we cannot
[1:47:18] leave him asleep he say does that does
[1:47:21] God sleep he rested on the seventh day
[1:47:23] and the creation he did the creation
[1:47:26] that it City arrested and he rests
[1:47:29] between revivals Amen we are between
[1:47:32] revivals and it's between revivals when
[1:47:35] the danger comes they meant remember I
[1:47:38] said months ago that's when David he got
[1:47:40] on the throne he had his kingdom he
[1:47:43] doesn't go fight the battles anymore
[1:47:45] he's sitting on a throne he walks out to
[1:47:47] his window wherever he sees Bathsheba
[1:47:48] what happens he got settled down he got
[1:47:53] comfortable he got used to his kingdom
[1:47:56] oh this is yeah I could just relax I can
[1:47:58] retire now basically and that's why I
[1:48:01] said because things he got complacent in
[1:48:03] his walk with God and that's where the
[1:48:05] enemy came in at his weakness time he
[1:48:08] was between revivals Israel was between
[1:48:10] revivals at their time and it's the same
[1:48:13] thing with the church remember our
[1:48:15] revivals and awakening who's been
[1:48:17] awakened I mean you get yo you begin to
[1:48:21] realize he's not three people he's one
[1:48:22] person I mean he's your Redeemer I mean
[1:48:25] his voice is spoken in the same time you
[1:48:28] mean to your eyes come open I'm a child
[1:48:30] of the king holy and you're called out
[1:48:32] of Babylon out of confusion I mean you
[1:48:35] follow his voice and you begin to
[1:48:36] rejoice glory amen my Isaac I Know Who I
[1:48:39] am
[1:48:40] hello he's washed all my sins away
[1:48:42] that's a revival because your eyes come
[1:48:44] open that's not the final revival you
[1:48:48] just come out hallelujah I've been
[1:48:50] sealed under the kingdom that's enough
[1:48:51] yeah that's a revival that's an
[1:48:53] awakening but then becomes a time
[1:48:57] witness between revivals and that's when
[1:49:00] the enemy comes in because it's between
[1:49:02] revivals because really what's your
[1:49:04] first
[1:49:05] all you care about is him you're not
[1:49:07] worried about what other people
[1:49:08] necessarily are doing but your whole
[1:49:10] focus your whole heart everything is on
[1:49:11] him and how wonderful he is that's the
[1:49:13] first love
[1:49:14] Alleluia but then the enemy will try and
[1:49:17] come in things will come and to try and
[1:49:20] distract us and we look at other things
[1:49:21] and if we look at other things we go our
[1:49:24] own way and we go astray we've got to
[1:49:30] wake him up
[1:49:30] brother M says you can call him on the
[1:49:32] scene he's in the boat with you he's in
[1:49:35] the boat with you I mean when you wake
[1:49:37] up in the morning he's in the boat I
[1:49:39] mean wherever you go in this life if
[1:49:41] he's in you I'll be with you even in you
[1:49:43] to the end of the world wake him up you
[1:49:45] got to wake him up otherwise you'll sink
[1:49:50] we're not called to sink amen there's in
[1:49:56] the sermon I think awakening Jesus
[1:49:57] II see could you imagine Jobe enjoying
[1:50:00] being broke out with boils and all these
[1:50:03] things gone losing all of us wealth and
[1:50:05] his children and everything it wasn't
[1:50:07] very easy but God was proving to Satan
[1:50:09] that he had somebody he could put his
[1:50:11] confidence in maybe he's trying to do
[1:50:13] the same thing in your case I mean and
[1:50:16] the rest of you he says oh I'll bail for
[1:50:19] sake you though oh no job they couldn't
[1:50:22] make job do that no sir I mean because
[1:50:24] Jobe kept his eyes on the offering he
[1:50:28] gave amen he knew he knew he wasn't
[1:50:31] righteous but he knew that God said slay
[1:50:33] a lamb slain animal in your place and
[1:50:36] his eyes were on that burnt offering and
[1:50:38] in you because God accepted that
[1:50:40] offering then he was righteous Oh
[1:50:42] hallelujah as the same thing with you
[1:50:44] and I because God God accepted the
[1:50:46] sacrifice he provided amen his own the
[1:50:49] blood of his own son
[1:50:50] I mean God accepted that and because God
[1:50:52] accepted that Amen we're accepted
[1:50:55] hallelujah it's like the high priest
[1:50:57] once a year takes the blood I mean on
[1:51:00] behalf of the people into the Holy of
[1:51:01] Holies once a year and then when he came
[1:51:03] out alive the people could rejoice
[1:51:06] hallelujah we've been accepted the
[1:51:09] sacrifice on our behalf I mean it was
[1:51:11] accepted most of the congregation
[1:51:12] couldn't go into the you know they can
[1:51:15] only go to the outer court the high
[1:51:16] priest was the only one who going
[1:51:18] once a year I mean into the Holy of
[1:51:20] Holies to offer the blood on behalf of
[1:51:22] the people and if he came out
[1:51:24] we're accepted hallelujah that's the
[1:51:28] same thing with you and I we have such a
[1:51:30] high priest I mean we have such a high
[1:51:32] priest our lord jesus is our high priest
[1:51:34] that's why I said to Mary don't touch me
[1:51:36] I have an ascended yet I mean anything
[1:51:39] he went up and he offered his blood he
[1:51:41] came back down
[1:51:42] he said Thomas touch the holes in my
[1:51:44] hand to my side of my feet hallelujah
[1:51:46] touch me handle me now
[1:51:47] and because my blood has been offered
[1:51:49] hallelujah and in two thousand years
[1:51:52] down the road I mean he comes out of
[1:51:54] history I'm in this message he steps out
[1:51:57] of history it's the high priest coming
[1:51:58] out again I mean to make you know
[1:52:01] Calvary worked I mean to make you know I
[1:52:04] shed my blood on the cross for you
[1:52:05] hallelujah yes my brother and would
[1:52:07] stand there and he called someone out
[1:52:09] and called their name in their address
[1:52:10] and what's wrong with them and go down a
[1:52:11] line and he'd say now who did they touch
[1:52:14] they didn't touch me I'm thirty feet
[1:52:16] away from them they touched the high
[1:52:17] priest because the scripture says he's
[1:52:19] still the high priest you touched by the
[1:52:20] feeling of your infirmities I mean so
[1:52:22] that was for you to know the high priest
[1:52:24] was standing not the prophet but the God
[1:52:26] revealing through the Prophet Pulu he
[1:52:28] sang the high priest is here hallelujah
[1:52:31] and if you have the high priests you
[1:52:33] have the blood hallelujah if you have
[1:52:36] the blood you got forgiveness of sin
[1:52:37] glory to God amen so we have such a high
[1:52:41] priest oh I love that high priest don't
[1:52:43] you Amen but joy Beck confidence in that
[1:52:49] lamb he didn't know what was going on
[1:52:51] you go read the book of Joel he didn't
[1:52:53] know what was happening he didn't know
[1:52:55] that Satan went up to God and they had a
[1:52:57] conversation and God pointed out Jobe
[1:52:59] and said he's the perfect man and and
[1:53:02] Satan said well it's only because
[1:53:03] everything goes well for you for him
[1:53:05] that's why he loves you and and God said
[1:53:08] the first time where he can do anything
[1:53:09] but just don't touch him then the second
[1:53:11] time we can touch him just don't take
[1:53:13] his life Jobe didn't understand he
[1:53:16] wasn't there that conversation he didn't
[1:53:19] get a memo they just had that meeting
[1:53:20] he's just living his life and then
[1:53:23] everything and then one servant runs in
[1:53:25] these ones have taken away all your
[1:53:26] sheep and this one runs and lightning
[1:53:28] came down and killed these ones and this
[1:53:30] one ran in
[1:53:31] you know your sons and daughters there
[1:53:33] in a house and the house fell upon them
[1:53:34] because of a storm and they're all dead
[1:53:35] and here he is now what did he do
[1:53:39] God has provided me a lamb I don't know
[1:53:43] what's happening but there's a lamb and
[1:53:45] offered the lamb and gods accepted the
[1:53:47] lamb that's all I know that's all I
[1:53:49] really need to know and then even as
[1:53:51] friends come and tell them oh you're a
[1:53:53] secret sinner and you did this and God's
[1:53:54] not interested he said I don't I don't
[1:53:56] understand but I understand this I
[1:53:58] understand this lamb hallelujah and
[1:54:01] that's how we have to be friends I don't
[1:54:03] understand what's going on in life I
[1:54:05] mean where have you taken his body she's
[1:54:07] married what's going on I don't know but
[1:54:09] I know one thing I have a lamb amen and
[1:54:13] in that lamb I have forgiveness and that
[1:54:14] lamb I have redemption and that lamb I
[1:54:17] have peace and that lamb I have joy and
[1:54:19] that lamo got long-suffering I've got
[1:54:22] faith gentleness meekness everything
[1:54:24] I've need of everything I need over my
[1:54:26] earthly journey is in that lamb and
[1:54:27] because the main thing is the life that
[1:54:29] was in that lamb comes into me holy
[1:54:32] because the life of God was released on
[1:54:33] Calvary and comes into the believer
[1:54:36] that's all I really know I know the lamb
[1:54:40] so what's going on in life well I don't
[1:54:42] know but I know this what are you
[1:54:45] looking at I'm looking at him he is his
[1:54:47] word hallelujah no see see he was only
[1:54:54] trying to prove them you remember in a
[1:54:56] few minutes he said oh ye of little
[1:54:57] faith
[1:54:58] couldn't you understand about the
[1:55:00] breaking and feeding the 5,000 don't you
[1:55:03] know I'm the same Jehovah that fed them
[1:55:05] 40 years out in the wilderness out of
[1:55:07] the ovens out of heaven when I poured it
[1:55:09] out every night what what you so scared
[1:55:12] about don't you know I dried up the Red
[1:55:14] Sea one day don't you know I opened up
[1:55:16] the earth and swallowed the unbeliever
[1:55:18] one day I measured the earth and
[1:55:20] spirited it off out into space yonder
[1:55:22] he's in the ship now that's not mythical
[1:55:26] that's truth
[1:55:27] same now he tries to prove us and see
[1:55:31] where the will stand or not take a
[1:55:33] revival away and start an argument in
[1:55:35] the church just to see what you'll do
[1:55:37] turn Satan loose among you see how
[1:55:40] you'll stand let him strike you with
[1:55:42] something see what kind of a stand you
[1:55:44] take job said though he slay me you
[1:55:46] don't trust him amen that's it
[1:55:49] amen he said he'll allow these things to
[1:55:52] happen to see what you gonna do
[1:55:54] hallelujah
[1:55:55] now what are you gonna do here's the
[1:55:58] quick note what are you gonna do he's in
[1:56:00] the ship meemers not mythical it's truth

[1:56:21] disagreements among one another
[1:56:23] people pull this way people pull that
[1:56:25] way I'll tell you this how do you know
[1:56:28] if you're a legalist or a liberal you're
[1:56:32] actually take offense against the other
[1:56:34] side so if you're a legalist you can't
[1:56:38] stand someone who's liberal and if
[1:56:39] you're liberal you can't stand one can't
[1:56:41] stand someone who's legalist you take
[1:56:43] offense that's how you know if you one
[1:56:45] or the other but if you really love the
[1:56:47] Lord and love your brother you want to
[1:56:48] call from both sides I mean you want to
[1:56:50] see a life lived I mean the divine love
[1:56:53] flowing through a person hallelujah
[1:56:56] that's because you got to know who you
[1:56:57] are
[1:56:58] amen it's like it's like the you know we
[1:57:02] talked about if God ever your God is
[1:57:05] writing another book of X and he is
[1:57:08] writing another book of X but out of the
[1:57:09] book of X came the Corinthian church
[1:57:11] I meant they were liberal they were
[1:57:14] still sheep they were still sheep
[1:57:17] they're liberal then worried about sin
[1:57:19] and everything was out of order then out
[1:57:20] of out of the book of Acts came the
[1:57:22] Galatian Church they were legalistic
[1:57:24] they'll still sheep but out of the book
[1:57:27] of Acts came these people you know there
[1:57:29] was the Ephesians that that had this
[1:57:31] deep revelation but Paul had to remind
[1:57:33] them love your wife husbands love your
[1:57:36] wives as Christ loved the church and
[1:57:37] gave himself for it and wives love your
[1:57:39] husband's they forgot how to live every
[1:57:41] day life that came out of the book of
[1:57:43] Acts I mean the Thessalonians were we're
[1:57:46] worried because Paul said don't be moved
[1:57:48] or worried by by spirit or by letter
[1:57:50] from us as the day of the Lord Yahoo
[1:57:52] won't come until there be the great
[1:57:54] falling away in the son of sin I mean
[1:57:56] the man of sin be
[1:57:56] reveal you know and there's another one
[1:57:58] said that people said the resurrection
[1:58:00] is passed already and overthrew the
[1:58:02] faith of some that all came out of the
[1:58:04] book of Acts what what New Testament
[1:58:08] church are you all sheep all came out of
[1:58:13] the book of Acts
[1:58:14] won't you Testament church EU you
[1:58:18] personally cuz you'll be one of them
[1:58:20] amen which one are you yeah think about
[1:58:23] it because we have to look at the end of
[1:58:26] the day Jesus said he said don't don't
[1:58:32] try and pull the little twig or whatever
[1:58:34] little splinter out of your brother's
[1:58:37] eye when you've got a whole beam in your
[1:58:39] own eye pull that out first if I had a
[1:58:43] if I had a big chunk of wood in my eye I
[1:58:45] won't be able to see like I would with
[1:58:47] 20/20 vision
[1:58:48] he said well that's real obvious but
[1:58:51] then there's the same thing with you and
[1:58:52] I we can have a complex that we're
[1:58:54] looking through and it's a massive piece
[1:58:57] of wood and we think we're seeing
[1:58:59] clearly but it takes God now that's why
[1:59:02] you got to be neutral Lord am i walking
[1:59:04] with you according to what I think or am
[1:59:07] i walking with you according to your
[1:59:08] spirit in your word and if you're really
[1:59:11] neutral about it he will be able to
[1:59:13] direct and guide you amen but if we're
[1:59:16] caught up in our pre preconceived idea
[1:59:20] this is the way the truth and the life
[1:59:21] and this is how believers should be then
[1:59:24] we're just trotting down a path we go
[1:59:27] our own way amen
[1:59:29] you got to be neutral remember the
[1:59:34] shepherd a man is far more intelligent
[1:59:37] than a sheep even even the dumbest man
[1:59:40] alive is smarter than a sheep I'm sure
[1:59:43] we can all agree but the thing is now a
[1:59:45] sheep a sheep that stays close to a ship
[1:59:48] it recognizes this this thing I don't
[1:59:51] know what it's called
[1:59:52] he's got greater intelligence than me
[1:59:54] and my intelligence cannot be his
[1:59:57] naturally and he can he's standing up
[1:59:59] here I'm down here he can see further
[2:00:01] than I can see amen and he has depth
[2:00:04] perception he can see how far away the
[2:00:06] enemy is because my eyes are here
[2:00:07] because I'm prey but a man's that your
[2:00:10] a Predators eyes are here and they can
[2:00:12] their dip if perception are you
[2:00:15] following me so they can see how far
[2:00:17] away the enemy is I can't because my
[2:00:19] eyes are out here somewhere I can't
[2:00:20] really see that's the same thing with
[2:00:23] God that's why God God says here's the
[2:00:25] enemy here and he's trying to tell you
[2:00:28] this is where the enemy is and you say
[2:00:30] what oh that's miles away and he can be
[2:00:32] right next year amen but if but if
[2:00:35] you're if you're a smart cheap you
[2:00:36] recognize hey my ship it knows more than
[2:00:38] me
[2:00:40] hallelujah but then there's also the
[2:00:42] promise in this day that you have the
[2:00:43] mind of Christ you have the mind of the
[2:00:45] Shepherd amen so it's got to be Lord
[2:00:48] changed my thinking that it's your
[2:00:49] thinking not my thinking my thinking
[2:00:52] will lead me astray well all the sheep
[2:00:54] have gone astray my my thinking or my
[2:00:56] desires well I think it's not going to
[2:00:58] take you the right way but his thinking
[2:01:00] will take you the right way hallelujah
[2:01:03] I'm in queer some musicians to come I
[2:01:06] mean do you love the Lord are you one of
[2:01:09] his sheep amen

[2:01:26] eyes on him walk with Him keep your eyes
[2:01:28] on him
[2:01:29] keep your eyes listen to his word read
[2:01:33] his word and he'll guide you you have
[2:01:38] confidence
