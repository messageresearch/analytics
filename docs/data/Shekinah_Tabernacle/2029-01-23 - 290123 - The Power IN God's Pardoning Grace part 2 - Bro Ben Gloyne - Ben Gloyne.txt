familiar piece of scripture here I want to continue on from from last Sunday the uh uh the the power in God's pardoning grace hallelujah amen so uh Exodus 14 and 10 to 14. and when Pharaoh junai the children of Israel lifted up their eyes and behold the Egyptians marched after them and they were so afraid and the children of Israel Cried Out unto the Lord and they said unto Moses because there was no graves in Egypt thou has taken us away to die in the wilderness wherefore hast thou doubt thus with us so to carry us forth out of Egypt is not this the word that we did tell thee in Egypt saying let us alone that we may serve the Egyptians for it had been better for us to serve the Egyptians than that we should die in the wilderness and Moses said unto the people of um and said unto the people fear ye not stand still and see the salvation of the Lord which he will show you today for the Egyptians whom you have seen today you shall see them again no more forever the Lord shall fight for you and ye shall hold your peace praise the Lord amen let's bow our heads in a word of prayer if you're going to be remembering a prayer just want to raise up your hands of the Lord amen let's pray together Lord Jesus We Want to Thank You Lord that truly Heaven comes to fight for us oh God that we're not alone in these battles Lord Jesus this Earthly Journey we're not walking alone

pray you just have your way in the service Lord those who couldn't make it today be their portion Lord we love you in Jesus Christ's name have preeminence take over o God and do what you want to do Lord in Jesus Christ's name amen God bless you may have your seats this morning so last Sunday just a very quick recap I was talking about the power in God's pardon and Grace and he's talking about the how there's power and God's pardon to take you out of every prison and every trouble and you know and but you know there's a pro you know you know there's a time when we need to you know look into where we have been and realize we're not there anymore it's a very it's yeah it's a very important thing that that we realize where we have been but we're not there anymore we're not back there anymore so the so the people of Israel they always had this problem of the slave mentality complex where it didn't matter really unfortunately how how free they were how much God undertook for them they were still living back in Egypt in their minds but God never wanted them to be living as slaves back in Egypt in their minds he wanted them to realize that they were God's chosen people as as God even called Israel his son and he called them out of Egypt to walk with him and serve him and be in the promised land be in their inheritance amen so we've got to realize we all have a past you know it doesn't matter where we come from what we've done we may have been the rankest sinner in the world or we could have had just a proud religious spirit being raised up in church we've all had a past right and we've all come from somewhere right but then God doesn't want us to live in the past he wants us to live in the future I mean he wants many people are defined by their past maybe a defining moment in their life you know can be a very terrible thing can be a very good thing but you know many many times it's the negative things of our life that hold us back and those negative things unfortunately for human beings Define us they you know really dictates our path how we think how we act how we treat one another and and and it controls us but we're going to realize that that that's not our portion we're going to realize that that that our portion is actually the fullness of the Holy Ghost it's the fullness of the word it's actually we are the sons and daughters of the most high God and and really who he is should Define us you know you're on how we walk how we act how we dress the things we say the things we do everything that we do think and say should be controlled or governed by him he should be our defining moment now I was thinking about this I want to as a as a bit of a uh subject or something I want to talk about going back to the spot where you drown Satan you know I was thinking about the Hutt River you know you know you know you're the Google Maps or this world knows the Hutt river is the Hutt River but there's but there's a couple of special pots uh spots in that River where where Satan's been drowned you know we talk about baptizing someone we talk about drowning Satan I mean we're we're he and his sins and all the past are washed out into the into the ocean and you know we bear them no more you know there's a this world has a pollution problem but it's not just a natural pollution problem it's a spiritual pollution problem you know and and all the rubbish ends up in the sea you know there's in the Pacific Ocean and the Indian Ocean I think even in the Atlantic there's these great garbage uh heaps where the currents will take all the plastic all the waste and they'll just all this plastic floats on top of the water you know and and and and and actually in the spiritual we have garbage heaps too it's called The Sea of God's forgetfulness amen where where our past and who we were who we thought we were as washed away amen and and it's just taken by the current of the Holy Ghost far far away I mean some people they have actually started companies to to to recycle that plastic and reuse it I say good on them but in the spiritual we don't want to recycle and dredge up our old past but the devil wants us to live in that way and dredge up how we used to think and things we used to do but you know we've got to remember the day that Satan got drowned Hallelujah you know you know when we actually literally you know we're not literally but but ourselves because remember because when the blood of Jesus Christ God's Great Partners accepted into a life and that person gets baptized in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ they are showing not this not just this world but they're showing Heaven and Hell whose side they've picked amen and then also it's you know outward yo yo yo so it's an outward sign that an inward work has been done so that inward workers once upon a time when we were born Satan was on the throne of our heart he was ruling our life doesn't matter how moral we are how just we think we are what kind of a good person we think we are he was on the throne but they had to come a time where there was a revolution because he never meant to be on our Throne the Lord Jesus is meant to be on the throne of our heart so so God sends God sends his anointed word our way and then then a revolution takes place Faith begins to rise and the devil's cast out God comes in Hallelujah and then what happens is he's dethroned and then outwardly Now by that by baptism you're telling everyone you're all life is dead I mean to the works of the flesh are dead what used to govern you the spirit of the devil is dead out of your life and now you're now resurrected with the Lord walking in newness of life Hallelujah and it's very important where we go always go back to that spot where Satan got drowned it may not have been in the heart River may have been overseas somewhere but you've got to have a point in your life we can go back in your testimony and the Word was more than a story it was more than a history it's more than what brother Bram did or or or or the apostles or one of the prophets but God steps out of History to you and his word is quickened to your life and it comes to life in you and you're a new creature in Christ Jesus the supernatural work happens you've got to have that moment in your life amen where the word is more than quotes and ideas but it's a living reality because he is the word and he is alive forever more hallelujah we're going to realize there yeah we must have these spots amen now as many as believed were baptized in the name of Jesus Christ why would happen is because when the word you know Faith cometh by hearing and hearing the word of God and when the word comes into a life then Satan I believe is dethroned Hallelujah amen because we're going to realize that you know we have you know you know the Apostle Paul would say it like this in Romans 6. what shall we say then shall we continue in sin that Grace May abound God forbid how shall we that are dead to sin live any longer therein know ye not that so many of us as we're baptized into Jesus Christ were baptized into his death therefore we are buried with him by baptism into death that like us Christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the father even so we should walk in newness of life for if we have been planted together in the likeness of his death we shall also be in the likeness of his resurrection knowing this that our old man is crucified with him that the body of sin might be destroyed that henceforth we should not serve sin for he that is dead is free from sin amen so now if you be dead with Christ we believe that we shall also live with him knowing that Christ being raised from the dead dieth no more death has no more dominion over him for in that he died he died unto sin once but in that he liveth he liveth unto God likewise reckon ye also yourselves to be dead indeed unto sin but alive unto God through Jesus Christ Our Lord so there has to come a time when we reckon this right there's a revelation strikes our hearts actually I'm dead to sin you know I'm not a lot it doesn't live in my life anymore I'm dead to it amen I'm crucified to it it's crucified to me amen so so so so the effect of it's been killed to me and it's not part of me it's just it's just gone I mean because this word reckon means to take an inventory I mean it is an estimate it's to come to a conclusion so it's good to take an inventory Hallelujah a stock take is what you have on site right brother Kabir knows about stock tanks amen but yes but it's good to take an inventory of of what you have amen because when God comes in everything looks different who's had that experience the world looks different the birds chirp nicer and the sun's brighter and the leaves are Greener and the world is Lovelier and why because you've become a new creature Hallelujah but it's not just it's not just the world that seems different or your brother and sister that looks different it's your enemy looks different brother William says if you want to see God in his Universe you get God on the inside and you'll see God in his Universe right get him on the inside watch now the birds sing different in the trees even your enemy looks different when God comes on the inside amen he's in his Universe he's a new looking out showing you the Magnificent part of his universe but he says here you know even your enemy looks different when God comes on the inside so when God comes on the inside you can really see your enemy for who he is and what he is amen he looks totally different see before the enemy comes in he's this big powerful force that's just your slave master you can't beat him you can't outsmart him you try and turn a new Leaf he just turns it back you have all your good intentions he just throws it back at your face and he's a cruel being right this first birth we're born with is a cruel task master you know it'll it'll make you do things that you just live and regret you know how many people in this world they just live with years of regret I wish I didn't do this and I wish my marriage didn't break up because of this and I wish this didn't happen my family's like listen I lost my business because I did some selfish thing and this happened and people just live with years of regret now the believer's not meant to live with regret I mean because we've got to realize that all things work together for good those that love God and are called according to his purpose they might not seem good in the very moment that thing but it's working for your good amen it's bringing his character into your life I mean it's it's God used it to reveal himself in the trial Hallelujah but you see how many people live with regret we don't need to live with regret amen hallelujah amen see and then and then so the enemy he looks different you see him for who he is Hallelujah when you when you look at the enemy when God's on the inside you're actually looking through God's eyes he shows you through revelation of his word who the enemy is and you know it's like a spirit that torments fights in your mind a mind battle that seems so big so impossible that you cannot overcome it but when God comes on the inside you see it for what it is and what saint Isaiah 14 is as as as Isaiah would say about Lucifer son of the morning says you'll exalt yourself up you're on high but you'll be brought down to the sides of the pit you'll be brought down to Hell to the sides of the pit it says they that see thee shall narrowly look upon thee and consider thee saying is this the man that made the Earth to tremble that did Shake kingdoms that made the world as a Wilderness and destroyed the cities here all that open not the house of his prisoners so it says and they that see thee shall narrowly look upon thee so not everyone's going to see him not everyone sees the devil in this day you know the greatest thing an enemy can do is think that the one they want to destroy doesn't believe they exist amen that means that means you've won the battle because if your enemy doesn't even believe you exist you can do what you want and your enemy will blame me everything else but you for what you're doing you see but but it takes our eyes to come open to realize amen what the enemy's doing in this day and the word of God has exposed amen the enemy brother man says the opening of the seals exposed to Satan in his works praise the Lord so we're not ignorant to his devices amen we know what he's doing in this day and so we've been given eyes of Revelation to look upon him and see him for what he is because because I I do not believe this this scripture I just read is for on the other side when we're in glorified bodies I believe it's in this day we'll really see Satan say is this really the man is this really the spirit this anointed chair of the covereth that always come down Fallen as Satan done all these things is this really him that did weaken the Nations that yo made the world the Wilderness and the reason we can look down upon him and look at it like this is because we've been raised up especially in the expression places in Christ Jesus as far above him and we can see him for what he is there's not some big monster some big and you know your Invincible dragon but he's a defeated being under our feet was this the thing that tormented me all my life was this a spirit that troubled my grandfather now my father and now me and but now it's defeated was really just this alcoholic spirit that troubled my family the stubbornness or this Pride or indifference or whatever it was resentment this you know you know you see family traits those aren't personality traits those are spirits passed down but you see God has to have someone upon the Earth where that spirit is defeated right he will have a witness upon the Earth that they have a testimony that the spirit that seemed like it just felt like it could do whatever it wanted to me came to its end and it was now under my feet because remember it wasn't that just that generation of of Israel that was beaten by task Masters and slave drivers it was a generation before that they were 400 years that was a long time that's longer than New Zealand's been a nation that we know it today it's longer than America's been a nation that's a very long time right so so this generation where slave masters and remember it wasn't just the men it was actually the spirits on them that was causing that see if those demon powers weren't on the Egyptians they wouldn't have beaten the Israelites you know it's not it's not in Man Without a demon anointing to do that to another man right it's it's a demon anointing that makes One race above the other and it tries to destroy races that's demon oppression that's a demon Spirit doing that you see so so it wasn't just the men it was the spirits passed down because remember well we know in the west like like you know in English names people have names like Baker and smirthing different names and and because that was the family business was passed down through a family so I'll say maybe the Egyptian Soul was great Granddad was a slave master now I'm a slave master and my son's going to be a slave master weak because it's the Family Trade it's what we do what the spirit has passed down generation to a generation and there's generations of Israelites that were beaten and oppressed but God was going to have a witness upon the Earth whether there be a generation rise up that this thing's going to stop and it's not going to be them that's going to stop it it's God's going to come upon the scene and bring a prophet to deliver Amen to bring them out of bondage and it's going to stop by God hallelujah that they would not wasn't them that brought themselves out of Egypt it wasn't them that drowned their slave masters it was God himself amen that did it Hallelujah and then so they could see those ones it was such a big difference the same man that was beating them a few days ago was the same one that was faced out in the Reds he drowned amen when when Israel came out of Egypt police they could look upon their enemy because remember God wants you to know your enemies being defeated he doesn't want you to live in fear saying one day your enemy can come and get you that's why he wanted to bring them to the Red Sea there remember God brought them there they weren't just running haphazard and found themselves in that place God told Moses you can go ready to walk here go here go here you'll end up here God LED them to that spot it wasn't Israel it wasn't Moses saying let's just run east and see where we get to no God ordain their steps and the Reason God did that is because God wanted to bring their enemy that tore me to them for generations to destruction that Israel would see that enemy can get me no more he's not going to cross the Red Sea after me because he can't get through the Red Sea and that's like it's like when we come through the blood of Jesus Christ those spirits that have been come down and taught me to just trouble us in our minds driven us around amen it is destroyed they are defeated they're cast back into hell where they belong why because the blood of Jesus Christ loses us from all sin amen it loses from all demon oppression it looses from all trouble Hallelujah that's why they could see because God wanted them to know their enemies defeated and God wants you to know when you come through the blood of Jesus Christ that tormenting spirit that drove your drove your life is no longer in control of your life that it's been drowned in the blood of Jesus Christ I mean that's why we can have a good old-fashioned Pentecostal meeting hallelujah we're making a dance on the Shore Bank when we look back into the blood of Jesus Christ and see our enemy is dead I mean because remember this is a message of restoration and of redemption amen and Redemption has two parts it's by Blood and it's by power I mean when they came out of Egypt they came under the blood of the Lamb by Blood but then it was by the power of God brought them out amen it's the same thing with his anointed word amen the blood of Jesus Christ has come I could say into full effect in this day amen he showed us in the life of brother Brown where a man could speak creation that no Spirit could stand before him and God was showing the world this is what Calvary achieves this is what my blood does it will take a redeemed son and show that no Spirit can stand against him and he's trying to show you this is what happens to a Christian when they come under the blood of Jesus Christ the Holy Ghost indwells him no Spirit can stand before them does not even cancer nothing that's the great thing of the fear of the age it can not stand before them Hallelujah and God can take that person and speak creation through the ellipse that's the power of the Cross it's nothing new it's the power of the Cross amen but God had to shout in this day because we're going to walk from this Dimension to another dimension I mean we're going in a Rapture Hallelujah amen so we're Redeemed by Blood and by power amen hallelujah praise the Lord I'm so thankful for that this morning Hallelujah they begin to dance because they saw that their enemy was dead Hallelujah and you've got to see I trust you've had you've had moments in your life where with that spirit that used to drive you because remember it says in Ephesians 2 we all walked according to the spirit of this world the prince of the power of the air Ephesians 2. we all had our our conversational manner of Life governed by that doesn't matter if you're raised in church you may have been birthed in this church you've still got to have a time where that Spirits cast out of your life and God takes the Throne of your heart Hallelujah so so so the enemy goes from being the king of your life to just now something trying to influence your life it's like when God's trying to get your attention calling you his Spirit influences you the devil may be on the throne but but God is influencing you and then he'll bring you to a spot of full surrender and then the devil's dethroned and God comes in and then now it's just the enemy trying to influence you and but God running your life Hallelujah so there's a big difference now between being tormented or being bound by a spirit and being and being bound by a memory of a dead Spirit those are two different things but the thing is those two things can govern you like it's you're still it's still in you right but there's two very big different things there so we don't want to be bound by a spirit of unbelief or by a memory of a dead spirit right because because it's so amazing the power of the Mind the power of our human Spirit can can can actually bring sickness Upon Our Lives father Brownwood would would have many times people in the prayer line and then and then and then he began of course the Lord would show him what is what is happening in their lives and he'd say to one this isn't he him in 1956 he says you have a very strange nature that is a deep thinker you're always Crossing Bridges before you get to it it's always a bad thing never happens the way you plan it to happen and by that it's developed a peptic condition in the stomach giving you stomach trouble that's right isn't it sir if that is right raise your hand is that right nothing couldn't be nothing else God Almighty knows it you now throw aside every negative thoughts and go home and eat your supper and praise God and give him praise for it so so this man was a deep thinker but in his mind it was always negative so every bridge he had crossed in his mind what's going to happen next well it's going to be negative there's going to be trouble you know and this works so much in his Spirit it gave him stomach trouble so he couldn't eat his food no more so maybe just thinking man something's wrong with my stomach but actually what was wrong is he's being tormented by a spirit a spirit was anointing his mind so you've got to watch where your thoughts go are they positive thoughts of Faith or negative or unbelief where are your thoughts going see it depends what you're you know because the devil will enter into a conversation with you and he wants you to respond and he knows how you're white he knows how you think so he always try and use how you're built remember he studies you yeah he studied you he studied your parents your grandparents your great-grandparents you're all the way studied you know he's got a file on everyone he knows how you're built and so he will use how you're made how God actually made you and wanted you to be against you amen so so here's a man you know he's got this yo he's always has these negative thoughts now always you know always bad things and it's made it's given him a stomach condition so that's why brother says now you just throw aside your negative thoughts go home and eat your supper and praise God you've got to throw aside your thinking and start thinking a different way why because his thinking had given him a a a a physical trouble that's how powerful this human spirit is right so now now how much more then if we're Bound by the memory of a dead spirit see there's such a lie in the world today that we had to spend years working through problems with the spend years working through things no I just say no that's not how it works the only thing you've got to work through is actually exposing the devil and when he's exposed he can be cast out see but if you always say because you know this is not this is not something you just kind of merge in it's not like slow moving traffic you know like a traffic jam like we're going up to otaki in holidays you know you're going 20K now and there's the merge you're slowly going into it and then you slowly go but it takes a long time you're slowly going into it and you slowly go out of it it takes years no no with God you just go through the merch and it's done and you're not traveling at 20 you're going at 100. amen so it's not just all these things troubling you no more it's actually no no you're free but the thing is what has to happen is is that spirit because the devil hates to be exposed he but when he's exposed he can be cast out he is he always needs a human shield the devil must have someone to work through and he needs a human shield to hide behind as soon as soon as he's exposed he can be shot amen he can be taken out right but the thing is he will use the human shield and how he uses human Shields as reasoning you know I think well well well you know this is just how it's meant to be this is how my parents were and well if you only knew my past you'd know why I'm this way reasoning keeps them there but if you realize actually whom the sun is set free is free indeed I don't have to live bound I don't have to be dictated to by my past I can walk in units of life then you can expose the enemy I mean you start to feel uncomfortable when you've been going to talk a line of conversation you know God's beginning to discern your thoughts and you get uncomfortable that's the devil getting uncomfortable and he wants to hide try and shut down that conversation when you feel uncomfortable don't just shut it down open it up cause the enemy because because he's making you feel that way because he's going to be exposed you know people get angry mad sad or glad it's because the enemy's being exposed or if you're glad the enemy's not exposed you're free but if you're mad or sad you know upset well this and this happened and this no it'll come down actually this is a stronghold of the enemy it doesn't belong in my ground I want a full renovation oh look I'm not just gonna you know you've seen pictures of like China there's like this big big freeway and then there's this house in the middle of it because that person refuses to sell who's seen that kind of thing it's like eight Lanes each way then there's this house in the middle This Old House there's like a wall around it because that person refused to sell and now now that whole I'm not I'm not saying it's good they built the motorway whatever but you know it's like the devil he refuses to sell he wants his house in here he's used to living there he used to living in that complex in that stronghold you know but but but we serve a God and it's up to you though are you willing to let him keep his house there you've got to divert traffic around the problem or he's going to bulldoze that thing down and by the Holy Ghost and take him out completely I mean because many times we always doctor symptoms and we don't go to the root cause right we always talk about symptoms but what's the root cause you say well I just can't forgive that person because they did this and this and this happened you know what they said here that's all symptoms what's the root cause unforgiveness you got to take out the root cause you can you can baby the symptoms all the days you want but it won't help you nothing I mean you've got to come down and get rid of the root cause what is it unforgiveness and it pride is a big thing Pride will Pride will manifest itself in many different ways a Pity party's Pride no because Pride always wants to draw attention to oneself but a Christian wants your attention to one I'm in the Lord Jesus Christ Hallelujah so we've got to you know so if you're not free of those things the Lord is here to free right but if you've been freed of if you can go back in your life and say I remember that day I remember that hour where the Lord came in and the devil was cast out Hallelujah then all that can happen now is it's the memory of a dead Spirit can torment you and the reason that that can happen is because people say well you've got to work through things now no you don't need to work through nothing as I said the only thing you need to work through is actually exposing that into me praying and it's cast out they're now walking units of life amens it's not just okay so you so you have some counseling whatever you pray God comes on the scene and then you've got to work through it again no no you've just got to see see the children of Israel were working they didn't reckon they were free let's go back to Egypt why did you bring us out here to die Moses why'd you do this and all this trouble and they forgot the very God that brought them out was leading them right God didn't say now walk that way and I'll catch up later he said no God will send his Angel before you and you've got to follow him here's the pillar of Fire by night and A Cloud by day and they had to follow him so God went before them right Hallelujah so it's the same thing with us we're going to realize that he he he wants to lead us Hallelujah he doesn't just send us on our way and then that's it amen but no but you see the devil hates to be exposed amen he hates to be exposed now brother M sees this in the revelation of Jesus Christ is now see the carnal mind shuns it because the carnal mind knows not one thing about it what's that the supernatural power of God no wonder the carnal mind does not because it's Satan in that carnal mind and Satan is exposed and Satan does not want himself exposed you notice how horrible it is for Satan when he thinks he's going to be exposed watching one of the services watch the action of the people you watch out on the meeting just for Satan's going to be exposed over a certain person you see their face changing you see they don't know what to think all at once the Holy Spirit comes down exposes that devil oh he hates that kind of a meeting that's the reason we've had such a battle because the word of God exposes the devil see tells what he is now many people think well if I could just go back to brother Baron's day God will discern my life and I can walk free but you know the word of God is still a discerner of the thoughts and tense of the heart amen he is still in the Discerning business he's still in the business of exposing the devil in our lives see many times the preacher will stand up here or other ministers who are called by God and they'll preach along a certain line they have no idea why they're going that way God knows why they're going that way because you need it to go that way I mean because God knows what we have need of praise the Lord aren't you glad that he's mindful but we've got to by faith say I receive that Lord and walk on with it amen amen is no law yes no good just sitting there as an armchair commentator at the end of a match saying well this happened and this happened and wow that was spoken and can't believe he preached out in my life no you can't just talk about it you've got to absorb it you'll let God change your life hallelujah amen because remember it says in Hebrews 4 and 12 for the word of God is quick and Powerful sharper than any two-edged sword piercing even to dividing asunder of Soul and Spirit in the joints and of the joints and Marrow and as a discerner of the thoughts and Tents of the heart amen so the word of God divides I'll put it this way between your soul the real you and the spirit of the enemy see what happens is if we think the enemies works for us we'll never be free of it because who's going to cut their arm off right you know it's like if I think this phone is actually physically part of me and you say we're going to get rid of that photo say no you can't take part of me away because it's part of me right but but but but if you actually give me the Revelation no it's not physically part of you you can be free of it if you want to I'll say man this thing is such a curse you know I'm just using as an example you know it's such a curse please take it from me and you'll gladly give it up but you see if you think that just be having a stubborn spirit and being unforgiving and you know yo yo you're holding resentment and just always well I've got to fuss against someone you know there's always because it's about and thinking oh well I've always got to have a mind battle and all these things if you think well that's just how you're built you'll never be free of it but if you realize it's the enemy you can say Lord take this thing from me because it's not part of me I mean Jesus would say that I have no pardon the devil he has no pardon me right but the thing is because we are born with a spiritual Amnesia God has to reveal himself to us as he walks with us and he reveals who we are and who the enemy is in our lives Hallelujah and you're glad that the word of God can actually divide amen between Soul and Spirit between even even the soul and your own emotion hardly because why the devil hides an emotion amen I'm so thankful that his word divides between us and the enemy that we can see things that are actually not the not actually part of us that we can be free of it amen who's following me so far and I'm so thankful we can look into the word of God and and look at this law of perfect Liberty we say this is my portion anything less of this is not my portion I don't want it Hallelujah so we don't need brother Brown to come back and discern Hearts again the word of God Jesus Christ himself amen does it through the ministry and through the bride of Christ Amen brother van was saying Christ is a mystery God revealed he says well uh does not uh Hebrews the fourth chapter say the word of God is quicker and sharper than a two-edged sword and can discern the very thoughts of the mind and he was that word and when that word is preeminence in the man the same thing takes place again for it's the word Amy to saying he doesn't say preeminence in the prophet preeminence in the man preeminence in you and I am in the word of God can come and discern separate between the soul are you with me holy that's why it's so powerful if God has preeminence in our life then the Lord can use us to actually expose the enemy not our favorite preacher no no not not someone from overseas it can be in our midst in our own lives when God has when his word has preeminence that he is number one and our feelings our opinions what we think our cultural background our upbring whatever that takes second place amen and God's word is always right Hallelujah who wants to be that kind of a life I mean that a trouble comes up in your home and your family whatever and God can discern this is really what's going on through you Hallelujah I am in paragraph 283 if you want that from Christ The Mystery of God revealed I mean and when that word is preeminist in the man the same thing takes place again for it is the word Hallelujah amen see we have to come to a come to a place I'm going to come back to what I really want to talk about I just want to lay this as a foundation now so we have to come to a place where Where We Know The Enemy by his attacks amen where where we can see that any any spirit or any person who tries to disagree with God's word remember that's your enemy and when and you know when it's a person it's not the person it's your enemy it's the spirit on the person so you're going to realize that anything that puts a question mark over God's word that's the enemy doing that right because God never puts a question mark on his word he puts a name in he says yes that's me that's true amen it's alive it's for you Hallelujah amen but you see now we all have a pass as I've said and our past if we let the enemy can torment us when we forget that we've been freed now Rahab had a past Rahab had a real past e the Lord now she was living remember she was Rahab the holler brother says in one place it was actually her parents put her out into that livelihood to support them and so Rahab Rahab had a past now now she's Rahab the Harlot but you see when she heard the testimonies of what God did Amen in in Egypt parting the Red Sea the plagues all those different things and you know and when the Israelites defeated the uh two kings the ammonites you know Argan Bashan or what um oh no sorry the two kings the amorites seahon and OG you know she somehow she realized well she realized that that Israel's were in the path of Israel Israel is going to take Jericho and take the promised land he you know she said that the heart of all the men of war and things in the city is gone because of them see the fear of God falls on the devil when you walk towards him well you may not realize that he said well I'm just a believer I'm just no no no if God is in you the devil shakes when you come close see it shouldn't be us being afraid of him no he's afraid of us amen but you see he uses fear and intimidation to get us to think he's bigger than you he ain't bigger than you amen you're bigger than him and the reason you're bigger than him because you got the biggest daddy for Hallelujah and your daddy can beat up anyone else in existence right so you know you know your kids will say my daddy's bigger than your daddy my daddy is going to beat you up well we've got the biggest daddy Harley and he defeated the devil that down Calvary hallelujah amen so the enemy is actually afraid of you amen amen when you get to when you realize who you are and you're the most powerful people in the world you're not just some pushed out groups somewhere no you're the most powerful people in the world the reason this world has not fallen into other chaos is because of you you're still here hallelujah hallelujah you realize that the UN has nothing on you amen amen you think you know you know they're trying to arm the Ukraine all these things get weapons of war and try and develop Hypersonic missiles you're better than a Hypersonic missile you're more powerful than the whole arsenals of of all the armies of the world you are one prayer can change the whole world and God inspires you Hallelujah so we're going to realize that we are not defeated we're not alone our God is with us Hallelujah so so Rahab Rahab would testify to the two um spies about about the condition of the city about about what their God did for them in Egypt different things and it's amazing because judgment was coming to her City but somehow because Faith Rose in her heart see there must be Mercy there somewhere this God of Wrath is coming amen this you know destroying Angels coming Joshua and the armies of Israel are coming where we're toast but there's got to be mercy here somewhere for me Hallelujah so so here she was this this this Harlot asked for mercy and she obtained Mercy Hallelujah see no when true faith comes in that Jesus Christ is the Lord God Almighty and he's the same yesterday today and forever what happens is the first cry that comes out of that heart is Lord there must be Mercy for me that was her first question surely there must be somewhere and and then the Spy said well you just you just get in your house this Scarlet chord you have this token put it out your window and everyone who gets under this token shall be saved amen see so so you look at her life it was once she was she was governed by that last spirit that took her into halatory right she was being driven by the spirit but when Faith came that thing was cast out of her life and now what was actually Faith was motivating her it wasn't unbelief motivating her going into the Heart Tree life no it was Faith to get her family in I mean that was the thing that was driving her Hallelujah and then we know the rest of the story Israel walked around Jericho and everything in Jericho was destroyed all the men that she slept with all the horrible things she did that was all dead Hallelujah because God knows how to get rid of your past amen and it wasn't just this men that were destroyed it was actually the spirit on her and on them got cast out they were gone they had known to work through anymore Hallelujah so she could look back you know you think about that when when when when the Wolves fell down flat and her and her house was on the top of the wall and it came down to ground level and it was all fine and the people were fine and they walked out Holly and the two spies came in and got them out and yo yo they saw the destruction of Jericho they'd say we have walked into a new world we've walked into a new world we may be living in the same place but this is a totally different world because now the lord god Jehovah is in control of this world and it's not Pagan idolatry it's not a spirit of lust driving me no more I'm free well hallelujah we're under the under the leadership of Joshua amen praise God so she walked into a new world so so the only thing she could be tormented by was by flashbacks of her past she didn't have to work through nothing she was free you see and then her Freedom was further cemented because she she married Salman who was one of the princes of Judah hello so she married into the tribe of Israel right and to the tribe of Judah and so her identity was normal what she was but now what she became Hallelujah and that was her defining moment in her life it wasn't her past it was her present and her future by that Union with Solomon amen she was a totally new creature hallelujah it's the same thing with you and I I trust I trust you're following me today I trust we can go to the Red Sea and do a dance Hallelujah we can see our enemies actually dead amen and it's just a it's just a torment of a memory that can control us now it's not it's not our it's not who we see we're not that person if you've really met God you're a new person you're a new creature you're not the old the old you is gone God drowned he's gone she's gone enter the sea into the garbage dump you know they're in the Pacific you know the current's taking them far away and you're not going to go dredge that person up Hallelujah you don't want that person back amen because you're a new creature you've been transformed hallelujah amen so she could she could only be tormented worth by memories now if someone told her well you know you've just got to work through this now what happens that resurrects it just makes those memories more real but she could just say hold on you think of the wedding day I don't know how the Jews do it exactly but you know it used to be back in the day that the um that the minister would say well if anyone has any cause that this Union should not go ahead speak now forever hold your peace can you imagine there'd be some Israelite girls have been watching Salomon all the way through the Wilderness you know we're going to marry him I'm going to be the one he's a prince man he's loaded you know he's he's got all the money I'm gonna you know I'm gonna marry into royalty I fit the bill look I'm a daughter of Abraham done nothing wrong being in the church perfect believer you know here I am in the young people's doing all kinds of things I'm going to marry that man and then Here Comes This Here Comes This Harlot woman that got saved out of Jericho she doesn't deserve Mercy see if you have never received Mercy you can't give Mercy she she has no right she should be a slave she should be a slave in Israel that's it but God has a way of putting people together amen because remember we are remember the brighter crisis shown in types and shadows in the scripture right and we live according to our types right amen so here she is she's you know at the altar with salmon the Rabbi says these things maybe one of the young Israelite girls who who thought I'm gonna get him just stands up can't hold it anymore don't you know what she did don't you know what she did and maybe someone would have said hold on where are the men where are those that did the crime bring them where are they they're Six Feet Under they're dead they're gone there's no more living witness because God took care of her past that she could walk on in her future hopefully it's the same thing with you and I God wants you to know he's taking care of your past remember the sin question was settle that down Calvary in his mind and his heart isn't settled in yours hallelujah amen so she could walk on she married Salman and her past didn't dictate her future Hallelujah and if she ever got flashbacks and you know someone came along and said well you've just got to work through it what does that do just try and resurrect those spirits no we're free there's a demarcation in life where the old you once lived and then that person dies because you're United to another right and now a new life is living amen you're walking in newness of life Hallelujah so she could always go back it's in a hold on I miss a salmon of Judah this is who I am now this is who God saw me to be amen not who I was it's who I am that defines me how about you right now is it is it is it your past I say oh people say you've just got to work through something no all you need to do is expose the enemy get him cast out and walk on in Freedom realizing that your past doesn't have to hold you back well so many things happen well no our defining what you define us in our life he found me he found me this message found me Jesus Christ stepped out of history and he found me maybe it's through a booklet through a table through a preacher what it was but Jesus found me amen we went more from more than a story and this is where I'm born and this is this is my parents and this is all these things but they know he found me and I could cry Abba Father my father my father you know actually who you are who you came from because if you're real because remember people people always look for their origin and then they become more like the origin than maybe they would have normally you know you know you're because why they're looking for identity and what does this message do it gives us identity it gives us a Heavenly identity a true identity that we are Sons and Daughters of the most high God Amen that we're not just from this world here no we're from Heaven amen we came from God and we're going back to God Amen and if we came from God and going back to God God's the power of his blood loses us that the enemy has no hope no more we're a free people Hallelujah so so we have to reckon as I said from uh Romans 6. wrecking yourselves also to be dead indeed unto sin but alive through God I mean unto God through Jesus Christ Our Lord we're going to take inventory don't be don't be don't be governed by by flashbacks well then why do I still remember because the reason we're still allowed to remember is because God God wants us to be thankful Hallelujah because if you are thankful for you from where you came from Hallelujah I mean you'll be thankful to where you're going Hallelujah why because you can Rejoice thank you God I maybe not what I want to be but thank God I'm not what I used to be Hallelujah that's the main thing you know maybe you know I see the word I see the fullness of the Statue of Christ and I see what the bride is meant to be well you know and say Lord I want to become that hey we're still maturing we're still growing we're still walking right but thank God we're not what we used to be the Lord has taken us higher he smolders uh our character has changed us amen so we can now walk on that we don't have to be bound by our old life Hallelujah amen praise God Hallelujah we can we can walk free amen now he says and by faith Moses if you're a sinner raise up your eyes and look now if you've been indifferent if you've had little squabbles and little things what make what difference does it make you're going to die one of these days what day maybe today you don't know now from now you may be in Hell or you may be in heaven but you have got to choose now if there's anything in your life that isn't right you choose Now by faith you say well I just can't get even with her I can't get even with him no matter what they've done choose life choose life for Jesus said of your heart and from your heart you don't forgive every person their transgression neither does your heavenly father forgive you so just get that close if there's one order in your heart against any person sinner or Saint you're in danger of Hellfire now lift up your eyes what do you see you what do you see your enemy or do you see your savior what are you looking at this morning what are you looking at this morning are you looking at your past are you looking at the trouble of what used to be or you look at the one who's delivered you from your past what are you looking at this morning what where are you allowing your imagination to go I mean your memories to go because remember the devil will always take our memories and say look what you were but then it never updates to me I know I've said it a lot but you know there's power in this mind you're going to think about the true and right things of the word of God because remember the devil take us always back to our deepest darkest failures but then he never takes us to his deepest darkest failure what was his deepest darkest failure he took the Prince of Life and he crucified him on Calvary releasing eternal life to the world the blood of Jesus Christ was shed upon the Earth to redeem us back to God that was the devil's greatest failure he thought he had him that day amen then he sat down on his lazy boy with his with his coffee down in Hell thinking finally it's done and I've won the day and he just he just he just earned himself his greatest defeat I mean because the Son of God came down booted in the dark take the keys of Hell death and the grave of Satan and then Rose triumphant Hallelujah see you've got to take the devil back to his deepest darkest failure hallelujah hallelujah man because his deepest darkest failure gives us our greatest brightest victory hallelujah what are we doing now we're walking in the power of that victory amen amen into every Divine promise of God Amen so what do you see this morning your enemy or do you see your savior what are you looking at this morning if you're sick and your doctor says you can't get well lift up your eyes to the Cross where he was wounded for our transgressions with the stripes we are healed don't look at what the doctor says he's working in science Faith Works in the realm of the spirit and God let us think on these things now while we raise our hands God sees them Hallelujah see we've got to get to a place where where where Christ just means so much to us this is why we have testimonies it makes it cause us to love him more remember he can't love us any more than it already has for God so loved the world he gave his only begotten son whosoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life right so the fullness of his love was displayed that day on Calvary but our love for him can increase that's why he gives us testimonies that's why he proves his word in your life amen because he wants you to know that he's alive that he's able amen that I Help Cometh From him we can trust in him in every situation amen any and it makes him mean so much more to us brother I'm says in remembering the Lord in 1962 so when the church gets to that place where that Christ means so much to us that we thirst to get in his presence and with each other it's a life-giving resource see when we get into that spot that that's what we hunger for to get into his presence and with each other see if we want to get into his presence you can't condemn another mortal in his presence you can't hold anything against anyone in his presence amen you can have the worst day but when you get into his presence that'll just evaporates I mean you're going to be having all the trouble you can be in the most Troublesome moment in your entire life you just get into his presence and it all comes into perspective amen we where he reminds you you're you're my daughter you're my son I love you I care for you I mean you're in my care you're in my last book of life you can't be lost holy all these troubles are just temporary things and they're actually working a far more eternal weight of Glory as the Apostle Paul would say hallelujah amen so if that's it it's a life-giving reason sauce it says no devil can can can ever overtake you Hallelujah not even death even death itself is defeated there oh what a hope what a place refresh ourselves and in doing so remembering Christ was the one who made it possible for us he was the one who did these things for us we must remember him so if I remember once we were aliens and without God Gentiles carried away with dumb Idols but remember Christ died not just for the Jew but for every creature of Adam's Fallen race Christ died Hallelujah so we're going to realize that we ever get to that place who wants to be in that place this morning that we just hunger and thirst to be in his presence that's all we want law I want to be in your presence Lord I Want To Worship You Lord I want to I want to feel the brush of angels Wings Lord I want to feel your anointing come down lord and so I can Praise You In a greater way like at all these weights of life can be lifted off and Lord I just want to be that Lord that's why you died Lord that that I can step into your presence once it was death to go into the holy of holies now it's death not to go in and to the very presence of God Amen but his blood has given us away in Access amen into his presence amen so if we get to that place where Christ means so much to us that'll change everything means more than our job more than trouble more than family feuds more than pain more than sickness heartache sorrow memories he means so much more than those things Amy I believe it will revolutionize our Christian walk amen that we have a total abandonment to God hallelu into his word Hallelujah praise the Lord amen now the Apostle Paul I'm just going to finish with this the Apostle Paul says in Galatians 6 but God forbid that I should Glory save in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ by whom the world is crucified unto me and I unto it see Paul had a moment he had a moment on the road to Damascus and that changed his whole life that was his defining moment of his life Hallelujah and he and he said years down the road to King Agrippa I was not disobedient to the heavenly vision and brother Adam even said the same thing after the Ohio River he said I was not disobedient to the heavenly vision and look at everything that's happened because he was not disobedient to that heavenly vision here we are today amen worshiping and spirit of the truth because of that amen be says now he says for in Christ Jesus neither circumcision availeth anything nor uncircumcision but a new creature so the thing that avails or has has force that can be exercised that's what a veileth means one of the meanings it's not it's not being uncircumcised or being circumcised it's not a work of the flesh no it's being a new creation in Christ Jesus that has great power but if the enemy tries to bring up memories of what the old man and you live under the shadow of those memories then that's not going to Avail like it should because we're trying to fix things that have already been fixed you know we're trying to reconcile things that God has been wiped off as Ledger he's written pardon over your book and thrown into the sea of his forgetfulness it's it's a done deal it's gone but we try and work through things that don't need working through see what we really need to work through is we need to go back to that time that's why you know if I'm repeating myself well I'm just I just fail to repeat myself we need to go back to that time when you met God where he pulled on your heart you respond and he changed your life because when that moment happened the devil got cast out he got defeated amen and you got transformed the Holy Ghost came in and you can look back and say whatever I was before that date I'm not that person beforehand I'd just be up and down in a cycle never getting you never overcoming just same trouble same thoughts same ways but then that day but God Richard mercy and now sure I've got battles sure I've got struggles but I'm going upward there's an upward trajectory and becoming more like him overcoming more every day why because the Overcomer has stepped into the house amen and he's come to take over your life like Joshua was told by the captain of the hostess you know Joshua says have you he forced or against it says no I but I come as the captain of the host of the Lord so basically he said no I have come to take over this battle I'm not on your side you're on my side right it's the same thing with our lord Jesus he has come when he steps into your life what is he doing he's come to take over your human battles amen and that wasn't just to take Jericho I always take it was to take the whole Promised Land hallelujah it's the same thing with you and I when the Holy Ghost comes in amen it's not just to to unseal the land that you can walk into the Holy Ghost no it's not just that is that you would take every Divine promise of God because the devil remember when you look at the word and there's promises that you've never seen before the Lord begins to Quicken it the devil says that's not for you you can't have that your family's not coming you can't just say that how dare you say you're worthy to obtain that see and then he tries to get us stuck right there we're going to realize brother it says when the cricketing power of the Holy Ghost comes in it gives you it actually gives you right to every Divine promise of God Hallelujah she gotta Kick the devil off and keep walking on amen and what is the fullness of the adoption that's the change of the body I mean so so the Lord comes in to take over a whole human walk Earthly walk until these bodies are changed Hallelujah so I ask you the question what are you defined by people are defined nations are defined by founding documents America is still defined by the Declaration of Independence and their spirit is still that way we're going to be an independent country for good and bad right but but it was a document that was signed but it but the contents of that document had to be fought for for it to come into action remember they didn't just have their first Congress they were independent and then the king of England said enjoy it you know you're in trouble anyway no they there was there was conflicts terrible things happen and the men that signed that document were willing to lose it all some were tortured terribly you know many of them were very rich men and they lost everything one man I can't remember his name but but but but the enemy General the British general actually set up as headquarters in his house and he told Washington to fire on his house because the enemy was within it he didn't say no don't fire your cannons at that house it's mine he said no blow it up the enemies in my house I want you to blow it up amen because they are willing to lose it all to be free it should be the same thing with you and I we've received an open book in this day right we've received our Declaration of Independence I mean we're an independent woman that's actually a quote I think from Brother Brown she's an independent woman the bride of Christ we're not hitched up with any organization we just hessed up with heaven with God himself right so an open book has come down but we've got to fight for the contents of the book amen the Holy Ghost is here to give you the victory but you've got to go fight the battle you've got to put your feet on the promise say Lord that promise is mine amen Divine Healing it's in the land it's my it's it's in the book amen Miracles is in the book speaking in tongues is in the book The Baptism of the Holy Ghost it's in the book amen salvation for my family it's in the book Deliverance is in the book breaking the cycle of generational spirits and things it's in the book amen the the Rapture it's in the book Hallelujah every Divine promise is in our founding document Hallelujah but what are you going to do are you going to let this Define you good I'm glad there's a correction there or are you going to let here comes the no or you're going to let your pastor find you there we go but it's up to you it's up to you it's your choice are you gonna let your memories hold you down I'm I'm just closing I'd be what I want you to think of it because you gotta look at your thought life where does it go where does it go where does it like if it could be written up here you know like in uh you know like Wikipedia when you look at Nations and things you there's like um the economy and it's like split up into like this graph like New Zealand will be mainly dairy stuff and Timber and different things and you know but what would the percentage of your thought life be would it be your past this brother did this the sister did this you know this problem this financial problem you know the kids this Pro what is your thought life full of you know if you could chart it up what would it be or would it be God's promises hallelujah what would it be full of God's promises I'm so glad I'm a believer I'm so glad he found me he's awesome he's everything to me Hallelujah and then and then thoughts of your future yeah what is it what is your mind thinking of Hallelujah I trust us I trust it's positive things and sure maybe the enemy says yo but this is happening this happening but but then you've got to come down and say but God rich and mercy he doesn't see the devil had never has the final say he thinks he does but God always has the final say Amen says so you've got to think about that what where are my thoughts going I'm just going to finish with this this is my last thought where do your thoughts go on the day sure you go think about natural things but how do you think about them well you got to think about family and future but how do you think about is it negative is the is the conclusion smoke bombs craters destruction or is it streets of gold like brother man says about being sick you just have in your mind by the Lord a well body that's your age you walk into it by faith see what are you what are you thinking on amen see if you always think of the negative of your children well what's going to be made more the negative of your children you think about no lord they're yours they're put in my care your word says that that the Holy Ghost is for them then you start living according to that promise so Lord I want to create an atmosphere now my home around me of power that they'll just fall into it Hallelujah so go back to the spot where you drowned Satan that's a good spot and remind them I mean let's have the musicians this morning Hallelujah let's be let's be dictated to by our future by who the Lord is praise God we've got a great future we've got a great future we're all going to be the same age Hallelujah we'll be dancing on streets of gold we won't get tired oh my being and being a pull of quality man is like wow I don't know how these Believers dance keep dancing because I couldn't keep up with him I won't get tired like that praise the Lord we'll just be dancing praise God it'll be eternity the devil won't even be a memory no more I love it you know I I so love it there's there's a moment in here where he gets off he exits scene right uh you know stage left he doesn't come back he has his last his last I don't want his the last words out of his lips will be maybe no also because he falls into that Lake of Fire whether we drowned out by Hallelujah for the Lord God omnipotent reigneth hello he gets off I continue on this script says I'm going on to Eternity I have no end he has an end Hallelujah so we've got to look at things through that kind of lens my trouble has an expiry date the devil hasn't expiry date sin hasn't expired a sickness has an expiry date I don't I ain't got one hallelujah it's like I so I don't mean a joke but I saw this meme how how someone had this Himalayan rock salt and it said on a blurb like 20 million years ago the salt was made and it's got an expiry date on it like for next month is it funny how something that's 20 million years old that hasn't gone off is going to go off now and but that's what the devil does for you you have a blurb on your life you come from God and go back to God he tries to put a man-made expiry on you saying you're you're gonna end you're going to perish which one are you going to go by I'd rather go by God's non-expiry date for me then his ridiculous expired anyway let's stand this morning Hallelujah we can walk free today hey man I wanna I wanna sing I want to sing My God is Awesome he's awesome holy so good praise God oh hey man
