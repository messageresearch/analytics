can start playing the [Music] song just before um brother Ben comes I couldn't get the song out of my head this morning as I was driving here and I really wanted to do it and the thought was victory victory such a wonderful thought for victory I started to look up a few word terms of victory in the Bible on the way here and God gave David a great Victory David sought the Lord with all of his heart and he he was a man after God's Own Heart and then and 1 Chronicles it says and David put garrisons in Syria Damascus and the syrians became David's servants and brought gifts this translation says thus the Lord preserve David withersoever he went but another version says and the lord gave David Victory wherever he went and then as it it was again in Chronicles it says and he put garrisons in Edom these were all the people that all his enemies that were coming after him eventually they were under his feet now matter where they came from no matter how many there were he fought this one and defeated it fought that one defeated fought that one defeated fought that one defeated and once again it says and the lord gave David Victory wherever he went first Corinthians say says but thanks be to God which giveth us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ and then first John 54 says for whosoever is born of God overcometh the world and this is a victory that overcometh the world even our faith we've been given the victory this morning I just want to sing the song before brother Bean comes cuz I'm fighting a battle you've already won [Music] no matter what comes my way will

have Vicki here God bless you welcome amen praise the Lord great to have you amen sister M's home again praise the Lord amen great to have you too amen everyone else amen great to see you all greet you all in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen let's go to the scripture we're going to go to Exodus 11 and um then we're going to go to Revelations chapter 9 this morning amen let's read here Exodus 11 and um 4-7 here and Moses said thus sayith the Lord about midnight will I go out into the midst of Egypt and all the firstborn in the land of Egypt shall die from the firstborn of pharaoh that Seth upon his throne even until the firstborn of the maid servant that is behind the mill and all the firstborn of beasts there shall be a great cry throughout all the land of Egypt such as there was done like it nor shall be like it anymore but against any of the children of Israel shall not a dog move his tongue against man or beast till that ye may know that the that the Lord doth put a difference between the Egyptians and Israel there's a difference God puts a difference amen amen then we're going to go to Revelations chapter 9 and we're going to read verses 1 down to verse 12 bit of a lengthy reading but I just trust you um just bear with me and then you'll have your seats and amen so Revelations 9 we know this is tied into Revelations chapter 10 amen with the and the opening of the bottomless pit in Revelations 10 the mighty Angel comes down but we just want to talk about uh something here amen Revelations 9:1 and the fifth angel sounded and I saw a star fall from Heaven uh fall from Heaven unto the Earth and to him was given the key of the bottomless pit and he opened the bottomless pit and There Rose a smoke out of the pit as a smoke of a great furnace and the Sun and the a were darkened by reasons of the smoke of the pit and there came out of the smoke Locust upon the Earth so notice this is not a natural smoke and unto him was given power as scorpions of the Earth have power and it was commanded them they should not hurt the grass of the earth neither any green thing NE neither any tree but only those men which have not the Seal of God in their foreheads and to them it was given they should not kill them but that they should be tormented 5 months and that torment was as the torment of a scorpion when he striketh a man and in those days shall men seek death and shall not find it and shall desire to die and Death Shall flee from them and the shapes of the locusts were like unto horses prepared unto battle and on their heads as it were crowns like gold and their faces were the faces of men and they had haar as the hair of woman and their teeth are as the teeth of lions and they had breastplates as it were the breastplates of iron and the sounds of their wings was as the sound of Chariots of many horses running to battle and they had in their taals like under scorpions and there were stings in their tails and their power was to hurt men 5 months and they had a king over them which is the Angel of the bottomless pit whose name in the Hebrew tongue is aaden but in the Greek tongue has its name apolon one wo is passed beho behold there come two woes Hereafter amen so let's just as we finish reading the word let's just bow heads in a word of prayer you want to be remembered in prayer today amen you want to raise your hand to the Lord and let's just talk to let's talk to our great king great gracious father we're so thankful Lord as we approach you Lord with this song we're fighting a battle you've already won we're so thankful father that all you've conquered Lord how death in the grave and every everything that can be named Lord is subject to the name of the Lord Jesus Christ so I pray father that you take every spirit in here under your Divine control oh God may you come and Minister your word Lord in this Resurrection hour may you have your way in our lives father We Want to Thank You Lord that father as Gabriel's reached a milestone of it Lord going to 2kgs may he continue to grow healthy well and strong and we want to thank you that brother Phil's back home as well and Lord may continue to heal his body as well father anyone else who's sick among us who's not here touch them Father Lord be their portion as well Lord those who are streaming oh God and Father Among Us now may you move and touch our hearts like only you can Lord we need you to come and cast out the evil one Lord that you come and have preeminence father may you grant it Lord in Jesus Christ's name amen amen God bless you friends you can have your seat today so I want to talk about we can't sit on the fence anymore there's power you know there's great power in serving God in this day now I just want to before we go back to Revelations 9 there I just wanted to read you a um uh this is from a song little by little by sister Brenda Lewis that's G on to be with the Lord but very very anointed song she would write songs like it'll take a stronger win than this to that uh uh than to keep me from my promises you right it's very powerful music and you know but but there's this one here it says be thou strong and very correct rageous dispossess the inhabitants of your land I have given you this promise and it's time to take a stand amen you've got to drive out your enemies so your loved ones can go free amen and little by little you'll gain the victory amen so there's power there's a reason I mean there's power and separation unto the Lord amen that our loved ones can go free see God is God is wanting you to get into position that God can use you in your position to cast out the enemy out of your friends and loved ones that they can come into their inheritance as well so this walk is not just about ourselves amen it's about the people around you am mean so our Christian walk is very important how it affects one another amen so we've got to drive out the enemies of our land amen now just just just go so so that so those enemies could be fear it could be a depression it could be a little besetting sin you know it could be something that's just hindering your walk you got to drive that Spirit out I mean you've got to take the word of Lord and drive that thing out yourself cuzz the blood of Jesus Christ has given us ability to do so you know never ever I'm just going to jump to this I was thinking about in the study you know some people say it's hard to be a Christian in this day it's hard if you're not surrendered it's hard if you're not under the blood it's hard if you don't have the Holy Ghost it's very hard because it's human ability trying to serve God but if you know him it's easy am mean never ever let the devil get in your mind it's hard to be a Christian in this day no God is too powerful not to be able to walk with him God is too powerful not to be able to serve in him in this day he is the almighty all powerful God he's not an idol he's not some spirit that wanders around with no power he is the undefeatable undisputable champion of the world Amen he is conquered hell death in the grave it is not hard to serve him if you're surrendered but the devil will get in your mind it's hard to be a Christian don't listen to that lying Spirit he's lying to you he's nothing but a bluff you got to kick that devil off your Mountain so your loved ones can go free it is very easy to be a Christian if you're dead to self amen it's time to take a stand I may be repeating what brother Isaac preached at camp but I just want to come in behind that it's time to take a stand there comes a time when you just can't sit on the fence anymore amen there came a time in Egypt where the blood had to be applied amen it was more than just sympathizing with the prophet's Ministry it was more than just talking about the supernatural in the prophet's life but they had to be personally identified with that message amen and the only way to be perally identified was to apply the blood it was no good just to have the lamb around the house no good just to even kill the lamb the blood had to be applied that when everyone walked past your house they didn't need to ask you anything they saw the blood and they knew that you were associated with this Blood religion am mean with the power of the blood they knew you're Associated because your house was speaking to them that the blood was applied and it's time friends to apply the blood amen like never before it's not good enough just to sympathize with the move of God don't sympathize with it get in it amen as brother BR would say in the token talking about it is not enough you got to get under it you got to get under the wood got to get under the blood you got to let God have preeminence in your life cuz it's time to take a stand amen it's time amen for God to rise Sons and Daughters into position amen that our loved ones can go free amen so God would put a difference between the Egyptians and Israel and we live living in that same day now I read this here in Revelations chapter 9 because this this has already come to pass as as we read here in the SL I'm just going to jump through these slides back and forth but you know we know the scripture looking at verse 12 here one W is passed behold and here come two woes Hereafter now we know in the Book of Revelation there are three woes and that is world wars amen so so this happened between the first wo and the second woe the bottomless pit was opened up and I got to tell you the reason it was opened up because the devil fell am mean he didn't choose to come and open the pit but he was pushed amen he fell he didn't come down and say here I am he was pushed he's fallen amen and now this now the smoke of this pit now the more you see Smoke Rise the darker the world gets now I remember when we um I think it was 2018 the family and I and N FZ came with us went down to a camp at brother Greggs and we were going through kakura and the place was dead still but it was all Smoky and it was just one fire putting fire into the atmosphere that made this smoke go all over the place it was just I think it was a fire from a farm burnoff or a something you know it wasn't even a big fire but how much more now how much more billowing who's ever seen like an oil well on fire who's ever seen that kind of just all this black smoke just go that's like when the bottomless put opened and the more that burns the more the the smoke comes out amen and we know that this as it said here it darkened amen it darkened and the Sun and the air were darkened in verse two so we know the sun in the Bible represents the True Light of the Gospel so now we're living in a day where it's a very smoky day people can't see the light anymore it's been obscured you know we've even seen remember when there were bush fires in Australia and the atmosphere being affected here amen with the smoke that was carried over and you know but you see so the atmosphere is different in this day than it was 100 years ago or if it was even 60 odd years ago the atmosphere has changed because the bottomless pit has come open amen so now the smoke smoke has come upon the Earth that's why people say today what is truth how do you know what truth is you know because why the sunlight has been obscured by the smoke of this pit am mean people just debate the scripture and have an argument they try and fortify themselves behind an argument the reason they do that is because there's smoke got into their eyes there's no reality in the life of God in their life anymore why because the smoke of the pit and and we know Smoke Gets In everywhere right yeah it gets everywhere you can you know you can just be just a little whift of smoke go past you from a or something and it's in your clothes it's in your hair it's in everything amen but remember when Shadrach Meshach and ab this is the power of our God when Shadrach mesek and abedo came out of the furnace they didn't smell like none of it amen why because they knew they're God Amen they weren't fearing the furnace cuz God was able to deliver them Hallelujah so we can walk in this place it can be Smokey ass but we won't smell like the smoke it won't get into our eyes it won't affect us none why because we have the if you have the baptism of the Holy Ghost you have the Seal of God in your forehead Hallelujah cuz remember this thing so so this has happened this has happened what I'm reading is history but it still affects this day because the atmosphere has changed in the world right amen but you see now see see this thing now out of the smoke we read about these demon powers have been released and we can see now that you know you go back a hundred years the world has changed vastly I remember been doing um social studies at school they talked about the 1950s and 60s and the great change that came in New Zealand with culture and everything a vast change why because the bottomless pit was opened am mean there was a there was an article I wish I kept it about the anniversary of when the Beatles were first went to Australia and that one tour changed the whole country changed the culture changed everything why because four demon-possessed men wow took a gift that God gave them and sold it to the devil and released an anointing upon a country and that same thing happened in New Zealand amen that's why those things are from Hell amen don't don't dabble with nothing amen if you dabble you're going to get burnt and you'll find yourself not just burnt but but gripped amen so so we don't want to play with anything amen don't feed the animals what don't feed the devil amen don't give them time amen amen but you see here so the demon powers have come out of this thing and we see the effect of it of the mental health of the country of the world we see people broken and troubled and tormented in their minds mental you know I know this is not new to any of us we know this is this is here but this is why it's happened amen it's you know so so people's minds are greatly affected by these demon spirits of torment and it says but see but it was there in verse four of you put it in yellow there because you see these things are not here to hurt the Natural Earth but it's only those men who do not have the Seal of God in their foreheads that's why it's essential you must be born again you must receive you the Holy Ghost it's not a it's not a good idea it's not a nice thing to say it's a reality amen if you want peace of Mind get the mind of Christ am mean let God come into your life amen then these things they may try and trouble you but they won't they won't grab you amen because remember we're not immune from mind battles but when the Overcomer comes in amen you surrender him he'll overcome the Mind battle amen he'll cast out the evil one he'll give you peace he'll give you Victory he'll give you a testimony over those things amen so it says don't hurt the you see so so these things do not have dominion over those who have the Seal of God in their foreheads you see here and symbolically I've got it in yellow here against see and on their heads where is given crowns like gold now a crown represents a Dominion a a a position of authority see so they have authority to touch those who don't have the Seal of God they have authority to torment them amen but those who have the Seal of God are lifted up above these things amen these things do not rule us we rule them amen we have the authority by the blood of Jesus Christ to cast out these Spirits amen that these things would not rule us but we'll rule them they'll be under our feet we'll not be trotten down they'll be trotten down Hallelujah so we got to realize you got to realize it's time to take a stand because you've been given god-given Authority am mean to overcome these things who's with me this morning Hallelujah so this is so we we don't need to fear these things we don't need to fear this world we don't need to fear hell that's right amen if Jesus could walk into hell and be victorious amen and hell has emptied itself upon the Earth we can walk on this Earth and Victorious amen our God is too powerful to be overcome our God is too able amen we do not need to worry about see this world is falling because the bottomless put has come open it's falling and falling you can see every year people sadly these Spirits affect them more and more by how they address their actions tattoos and piercings and all different crazy stuff that people do and it's unfortunately demon Spirits this world is falling but there is one who can catch someone who's falling am mean like brother Bram saw the vision of his son Billy Paul he started smoking going onto the wrong crowd he saw him jump out of window and him tumbling down laughing and tumbling brother Billy Paul is a young young man laughing and just just falling and falling he's falling with the world but then the but then the prophet because he was standing in his position said catch my son Lord and then he saw two great hands as he fall and catch him amen and lift him up back from where he jumped out of amen that's the power of standing in your position amen if the prophet went and joined him say look I'll with you Billy I'll join him with you I'm going to be relevant he could never intercede like that I mean he' never be able to help a son but if you're standing in your god-given position and God's timing I mean God will catch them and God's timing God will get them he knows how far they need to go before they come to themselves I mean stay in your position have confidence in your God don't worry don't be distressed don't be discontented God is more than able amen my God can do anything he can save anyone any place anywhere I believe he can go to the worst most decrepit person in the world that we would think they've crossed the line they've gone too far they knew better and he can reach that one and bring them back amen I believe it amen I'm fully persuaded my God can do anything that's why we should be strong and very courageous Amen to take God at his word amen we don't need to back up we don't need to just fortify our see Israel learned a hard lesson with hamus they thought they can just kind of keep this thing contained in Gaza and have their defenses and put up their walls and so basically we can just manage this thing boy and put quotes and scriptures and all these things and but they but it come to bite them real bad and they realize they've been pacifying and the reason they were pacifying you know leaving hamus there is because of pressure of what other people will say what will the UN say what will the International Community say who cares about what other people say amen if there's a devil on your land you got to kick that thing out you have to drive it out you have the authority by the blood of Jesus Christ you do amen and and so they've just come to the point this hasn't worked that's we're going to dismantle this thing amen it doesn't matter what pressure comes on us we're going to dismantle this thing whatever the cost amen if I'm going to cry out at the altar if I'm going to if I going to make everything right of whatever I need to do I'm going to do it to dismantle this this network of tunnels of my life the enemy's built amen whatever I've got I've got to I got to cry out I got to I got to skip some meals and fast whatever I need to do Lord just bring me to a place where I actually surrender where it's not my human ability trying to do it but I give up and you take over Hallelujah whatever that is Lord God Amen they came to this place and they that's why they're determined amen we're going to dismantle this thing see we should never care what other people think if we're walking in the word we should walk in the word am mean whatever God remember where God made a covenant with you it's not you making a covenant with God many people make promises they turn it back it's God's promise to you that stands it's God's covenant with you remember he you didn't ask him to DN Calvary for you you didn't ask him to put your name on the L's book of life before the foundation of the world you didn't ask him those things he did it before you even realized amen he did it for you amen this is the greatest age to be alive in Hallelujah this is the greatest age to be alive in I'm so thankful I'm alive in 2023 I'm so thankful we have our strength we have sound mind amen we can serve God hallelujah this is the greatest time because Time and Eternity are blending together Hallelujah Lord praise the Lord but it's time to make a stand the Devil Makes fences so if you're sitting on the fence you're sitting on the devil's workmanship don't sit on the fence come and serve God give your life to Jesus Christ let him live in your life don't just sit there and say well the what could be no let him do it as I said there came a point where they had to kill the lamb and put the blood up to be identified amen and it's when you let the Holy Ghost come into you and take over your life that's what you need that's what we need we need the blood to be applied it's no longer just sympathizing and knowing Bible stories it's when God comes in and changes your life I I believe when they applied the blood it be more than just a dash on the door and L they would have covered the whole thing we going to be all covered my whole life's got to be completely cover by the blood Lord have I Lord are there any Stones unturned anything I see he'll He he'll tell you we don't have to see we don't work out God's leadership he tells us his leadership amen and we see that when the blood is applied to our lives the Holy Ghost has come in that's a sign you're under the blood is because you have the Holy Ghost because it's not a literal blood anymore cuz that blood is done and gone Jesus poured his life out we don't have that physical blood and even if I had that physical blood it wouldn't do me any good it just be a relic that we' we'd be AED by it' be a amazing to see the blood of our savior wouldn't it but it's not going to get us to Heaven just having the physical blood the life and the blood's got to come into us right that's how you know the blood is applied because the Holy Ghost comes in trust that's okay some people think oh you have you diminishing the blood no I'm magnifying the blood because the life in the blood has got to come into you and I see Jesus died not just to forgive us of our sins that the he would dwell in us that was his purpose of going to Calvary I want to wash your people clean I want to take sin nature out of their lives I take all unbelief out of their life that I can walk in them and I'll I'll be their God they'll be my people hallelujah hallelujah so it's when the Holy Ghost comes in the word he says here now speaking from Hebrews 12 amen that the New Testament the blood speaks better things the blood is speaking then the blood has got a voice and the voice of the blood is the word hallelujah that's what makes it whether it's right or wrong the word is identified by the voice of the blood the voice of the blood is the holy ghost that brings life it is life and it brings to life the word and quickens it amen so you know if you got the holy ghost that it's more than just you trying to remember scripture but the Holy Ghost takes that word and makes it live in your life amen that you can forgive you can love you can look over faults you can be honest you can ask for forgiveness you can put things right that's the blood actually taking effect you say what about signs Miracles and wonders people can have all those things and still be a devil and not be converted we believe in miracles but there's got to be a character there's got to be a nature there's got to be honest walk Walking honestly with all men amen no political agendas and twisting things for own ends we don't do that kind of thing around here amen that's Antichrist that's of the devil we just walk with God Amen so it's the when the Holy Ghost comes in he quickens the word to us and that makes the word live Hallelujah now if you you know if we could think back in these days there would have been a bit of a panic for imagine if this is the F maybe this is the firstborn here I don't know okay the first born's life is in so there would have been a panic brother BR dramatized it saying you know you know finally the blood's in on you know night night comes and then there's cries throughout Egypt as as the death Angels going through neighborhoods and the firstborn no doubt would maybe begin to panic saying Daddy did you do it right daddy did you apply the blood to the home Daddy is it really have you really followed Moses cuz his life is at stake we're going to realize our lives are at stake here not just the firstborn every one of us our eternal life is at stake amen so we been crying out is it okay and then you know his dad you know he said Son calm down a Vindicated Prophet has come God has over Vindicated him remember all the Miracles we have seen we have seen God time and time and time again and he gave these instructions the blood's got to be applied and we've followed the word as the word has been instructed to us and we've applied the blood you've seen what we've done you can rest you can rest in this time when death is coming through the land you can rest cuz you're secure amen and now the son could rest he could actually be relaxed in this time of death isn't that a strange thing amen but no we can we can rest see this see see the token if you have the Holy Ghost remember our token is the Holy Ghost right if you have the Holy Ghost it makes you so relaxed because you know You' have passed from Death to life you know you've come according to God's word to repent amen of Godly sorrow for your sin and forsake it I mean them that confess their sin and forsake it shall obtain Mercy it says in the Old Testament you've been baptized in the name of Jesus Christ you've been you've received the Holy Ghost you're relaxed now cuz it's no longer you being the Christian anyway you've entered into rest so it's no longer you trying to be the believer no he comes in and he's the believer out of your life that's why why we enter into rest because it's no longer I that liveth but Christ that liveth in me see the Apostle Paul on the road to Damascus entered into rest he was trying to learn and and you know absorb all the quotes and try and be some big preacher and all these things try and be a big shot in the church but then when he met God Amen he entered into true spiritual rest and he stayed in that rest until the day he left this Earth amen and it should be the same thing with you and I there should be such a rest now we can have trouble I'm not talking about emotional trouble now I'm talking about spirit ual rest I mean where God comes in you know you've met him he's turned your heart all you want to do is serve the Lord you love him with all that you are God's done a work right amen you can see him changing you you're going from glory to glory what you were you're not amen he's made you more like his word all the time who's I just told you your testimony praise God Amen God's there's there's nothing in this world that you want amen you just want him you want to serve him you love him what's God's done a work just keep walking in that just keep walking in that amen but you can rest now that God has done a work amen and if he's done a work you can rest now that doesn't mean you get LAX relaxed and LAX are two different things CU like I said about the Apostle Paul he became relaxed he entered into rest on the road to Damascus but he didn't sit there yeah he said Lord lead me he went here and he did what God told him and he went here he did what God called him to do and that's what he did right so so he didn't just sit there and do nothing no he was led by the spirit that's right if he had to make some tents for a season he made tents amen then when that finished he went somewhere else he was resting in God's timing and Leadership and he had confidence in it but if you don't have that rest amen you're trying to do it all yourself you just you might just be shooting the breeze you hit something or you'll just be hitting the breeze right but the sons of God led by the spirit of God Amen so it makes you so relaxed amen praise God praise the Lord amen but you see now so we're living in in a time where I said these Spirits have come into the world right we have dominion over them now those Spirits were if we you if you study the Feast of the trumpets message brother Brown tells us that you know those demon powers were loose first upon the Jews in a persecution that's why there was a holocaust went on all those things demon Spirits got into got into Hitler and you know um um himler and different ones got into molini got into those ones to kill the Jews and so what happens what happens against the Jews in the natural and now H those same spirits come against us in the spiritual amen that's why that's why the devil wants to come in and make us cold formal and Powerless a he wants to make us with a mule religion where we do a lot of works but there's no life in those works I mean he wants to take the joy out of the church wants to take your shout away wants to make you just a prisoner in a CH concentration camp where you don't get fat and flourishing on the word and we should be spiritually fat amen we should be real fat on the word amen we should roll into this place spiritually and roll out amen and say where's the next meal I enjoyed that one I want more Hallelujah we don't want to be these emaciated little kind of anemic kind of poor Christians that just get the wind blows and we get pushed around by waves of Doctrine and nice ideas now we should be fat and flourishing amen it's like brother Ram tells the story of the two farmers they each had a barn one had a big fancy Barn big Steeples amazing kind of barn amen but there was just a bunch of weeds in the bar the farmer didn't tried to feed them good none and you know there's a Cal went in there for a winter and then the neighboring property there was this old kind of bar the shingles were falling off the roof didn't look like much but the farmer put real good hay in there real good alal for real good things he knew that will fatten a calf out and then a c went in there and then you winter passed and then this and then this nice fancy Barn you know there's a button was pushed and the doors went real nice and fancy but this little crippled old calf walked staggered out maybe leaned against the fence trying to make it like this and then the and then the old old bar maybe the door fell off and this big fat round calf came jumping and kicking and snotting and hollering and this emaciated one just looked at him said that's such fanaticism right no he was fat and round way CU he' been feeding on some good food Hallelujah so but the devil doesn't want us to feed on good food he just wants to diminish the word into just a real two-dimensional nothing just say a sinner's prayer you we got to have more than a sinner's prayer amen now you got to really die out and be born again let God live and then every promise becomes true and you just amen get fatten around spiritually praise God I like food by the way naturally Spirit yeah I see a curry I just get happy praise the Lord you know you see food who has that kind of a thing you see some better it just makes you happy praise the Lord and so surely when we see this come open it should make us happy Hallelujah why cuz it served up for you and I to enjoy amen praise the Lord but you see the bride will walk with the word which is Christ it must be an agreement not the ecclesiastical system but the word you have to agree with the word to walk with the word Jesus said so it makes it right see a devil gets into a person because they agree with that demon they open a door that's in the negative if you want the Holy Ghost agree with the word you open a door he comes in you've got to just agree with the word it's not complicated it's really not just yes Lord Lord take my life I agree he'll take you over am right amen so you see we got to walk but you see all these lying Spirits are around but if we walk with the word we'll walk independent of what what the popular opinion is amen Micaiah would Micaiah would be brought before um Ahab and Jehoshaphat I think it was you know and and he had come late to the meeting cuz he wasn't invited but the day before there were 400 prophets that Ahab had and they prophesying go take ramoth gillad for the Lord's with you and they got really enthused am mean they ran around the church even the leader you can't quite or maybe you can but you know this guy made some two sets of horns he's the leader of the organization saying by these amen you're going to push the syrians out of the country they got really excited amen but what were they doing they were walking with a lying spirit because the prophecy of Elijah had to be fulfilled amen a pro and Elijah prophesied that ahab's blood would be licked by dogs right so so God was now orchestrating events that the words of Elijah would be fulfilled and so now K was told by the because you know Jehoshaphat he you know he saw the 400 he saw their one Accord and all their excitement he says to Ahab but do you have one more and no doubt Ahab kind of shifted on his throne and just looked at him for a minute and said what there's 400 here bro they've all got you know they're all one Accord did did you not see the excitement and feel the atmosphere and the charge in the room but have you got one more yeah I got one more but you know he preach he's not in tune with the rest of the ministry he does what he wants to do he always prophesies against me but he was walking with the word you see and then so when when when one of the guys went to go get M says now listen you've been out of Fellowship for a long time you know you want to come back in now this is the convention right you want to speak at this convention you got to say the same things this is what brother so and so's been saying brother so and so and you know those things can be such a shot across the bow to try and get you to say certain things right but he said no I'll only say what God puts in my mouth and so that night he prayed he saw a vision of Heaven that lying Spirit up there and coming into all those things and then so you know the rest of the story Ahab was killed in the battle all those things were done but you see he walked with the word he did not walk with the ecclesiastical system we're an independent woman folks amen that's a quote the bride is an independent woman we're not hooked up with anything but the word of God praise the Lord amen hallelujah now these Spirits we know will continue here and go into the Great Tribulation but we don't need to fear going into the Great Tribulation amen we're we're fighting a victory we're fighting a battle he's already won amen but you see now we do not need to go through the Great Tribulation to be per to be perfected amen amen it says what has it done in cunningness he said he came in like flatteries what has he done he's bringing the Protestant ecumenical council of the world churches and the spirit of the Antichrist both on them bringing them to the slaughter just like he did the other in the hour to call the bride how he loosed in the ecclesiastical Church Spirit loosed upon what not upon the denominations but upon the brides those same spirits that came against the Jews and the Holocaust that are now fighting them through humus amen those same spirits come against us in a spiritual manner that's why we've got to be very aware amen anything that tries to take our joy tries to chain us to something that's not the word of God we're got to we're got to withstand that thing amen amen now every promise of God is here for the believer everything of the old New Testament Church is has been restored every gift every sign every Miracle everything Hallelujah has been restored so we never want to come cold formal and Powerless that's not our that's not a that's not my part of the scripture right it's time to make a stand amen if you stand for God God will stand for you Hallelujah I trust everyone's happy today amen now he says see loosed upon see not upon the denominations but upon the bride but here you'll get it the bride will not go through that time this is the Great Tribulation the Bible says not the church will but not the bride can't you see ministers can't you see Brethren you say the church has to go through the persecution the Perfection of it the blood of Jesus Christ perfects the bride remember he took our judgment on Calvary he didn't take some of it he took all of it the full penalty of sin he took upon himself for you and I the full penalty not just the down payment not just part of it but all of it am mean all of the wrath of God that we should have received he took that down Calvary he stood as a breach between amen God and us hallelujah to take out our punishment thankes praise God it's the blood of Jesus Christ perfects the bride amen a man who chooses a wife don't put her through a lot of punishment he's already found Grace too with her and she has found Grace with him he engages to her and if there is anything he'll keep her from every place to turn her hand his grace is so great upon them hallelujah hallelujah this is why I say it's actually easy to be a Christian today because his grace is so great upon us you don't know what I'm going through but you have the victory in it amen God's given you the victory in the mind battle and the trouble whatever you're going through you're going through and you got to realize you're not stopping here you're going through it amen see the devil say it's hard to be a Christian just quit I say well I've got nowhere to go like the Jews you know there's that chant from the river to the Sea Palestine will be free what they're saying is we're going to eradicate the Jews and the Jews are saying this is our homeland we have nowhere else to go we can't immigrate anywhere this is where we came from this is where we're staying it should be the same thing with the word of God this is our homeland we have nowhere else to go we have no denomination to join we have no creative man to go no the word of we have been returned to the word of God Amen if we're been returned we will remain amen so in the word of God is healing it's mine every Divine promise of God is in this word every it's mine it's yours I'm not backing up if the devil says you can't have joy anymore I say you're a liar get off my land oh you don't deserve to shout anymore well he made me worthy so I'm going to shout I mean you can't have love anymore oh you've left your first love you can never get back he's lying I mean he's lying I'm going to get it back if I've lost it it's mine I want it back remember the devil didn't give it so he has no right to keep it am me God gave it for you to keep it and not to lose it amen and if it's been lost you can get it back amen you have a right Amen to get it back hallelujah amen well well how do I get it back Jesus tells the parable of the woman that lost one of her coins it was night time her her husband was returning she lit a candle she lit a candle and began sweeping through her house right and that's how you get it back you light a candle what do you do you look into the promises of God you listen to the message that's lighting it because the word illuminates your life that you can see where you've opened the door troubles coming where it actually illuminates the situation I think too many times we sit in our own heads trying to figure things out that's not lighting a candle that's just sitting there with in your own head no light a candle listen to the word prayerfully open the scripture start reading through God will direct you to the answer Hallelujah then you can redeem back that which the devil's taken from you hallelujah amen praise God and so will it be upon the bride and so it is on the bride we unworthy creatures is deserving of hell but his grace holds us through it hallelujah look at how many lost and blind how many how many Sinners was there in the world they are I got saved God saved me for a purpose and I'm determined by his will to do that purpose I don't care what anything else goes I want to do it amen so what does that you say well I'm not a preacher whatever no no our purpose is to stand in our god-given position right it'll have different out outworkings according to where you are in the body but our purpose all of us is to stand and our god-given position that's right Lord amen cuz we got to realize the Lord is able to keep us from falling the world is falling but he's able to keep us from falling remember he's the strong hands that lift us up he's the strong one that holds us amen so we don't need to fear this world of gross darkness no the light has come to you and I amen that this smoke may be around us but it's not going to get in US amen it may be around us but this we got I have it can't get in our eyes amen so he is now unto him that is able to keep you from falling and to present you faultless before the presence of his glory with exceeding Joy amen he's you think we're going to be happy that day he's got exceeding Joy amen he's not just yep he's not Bravo he's going to he's going to be dancing the most I think Hallelujah why because he because we're actually his love gifts am praise God Hall amen but you see now Abraham see Abraham knew the power of his position that's right there were people around him that caused him a lot of trouble but that didn't knock him out of his position remember when God called Abraham he didn't call lot but lot went with him lot got a lot of blessings from being with Abraham I believe the reason he had so much cattle in these things is because because of Abraham's blessing fell upon him see we can just our lives the Holy Ghost within us can bless people around us and they might not even realize the power of the blessing but you see lot got in trouble a couple of times one time he got caught up in a war and he got taken away captive now because Abraham was called by God he knew that God made a covenant with him and he stood in that position amen he could arm his servants and go get his family back praise God because he stood in his position see he did not follow lot to try and save lot he walked with God and saved lot see there's a big difference you say well I've got to be all things to all men no Jesus did not become you know he did not become a drunk to try and win the drunk he went to the Sinners but he didn't become a sinner to win them amen that's right oh we're going to be relevant no you just be a loving warm friendly Christian right and people will know that you have a genuine love for them people feel if you know who knows that you know people know if you actually have a love for them you just be a warm loving open Friendly Christian they say something you know or or maybe you just drop something in you know and see where it leads if you feel a door closed you stop talking about the Lord but you just be a warm loving Christian that they that they know if if they have a question they can come to you and you're not kind of all kind of weird about talking about the greatest thing that's ever happened to you right but it's natural to talk about the Lord to them right but you see so so he armed so he armed his servants because he was walking with God and he got lot back but now there came but now there came a another trouble that happened as there was Strife between lots herdsmen and Abraham's herdsman because they had so much cattle and sheep and different things that the land could not sustain them I'm just I'm not yeah this from Genesis now so Abraham said to lot you take where you want to go and I'll take the other part so lot looked and saw the well watered Plains of Sodom and he and he said well that looks good I'm going to go there and then Abraham took the other part right so there was a separation now now so there came a point now in in Abraham's Journey that he could not arm his servants like before and go get L out because God came down and visited lot right I mean Abraham and told Abraham what he's going to do he's going to go burn Sodom up now if you look at if you look at lot lot lot lot went down to Sodom he was a righteous man compared to the sodomites right but then that living there it just vexed it he was vexed with the filthy conversation of the wicked for that righteous men dwelling among them and seeing and hearing Vick's righteous soul from day to day with their unlawful Deeds now let me ask you a question what was the power of Lot's testimony to them yeah it didn't impact them at all didn't even impact his sons-in-law yeah when you when the two angels came down to bring them out and you know God would you know lot would say we've got to leave you got his family we got to leave this place he going to get burned up his own sons-in-law laughed at him they made fun of him saying such a ridiculous thing seemingly but it was God right but you see so his his testimony had no impact wow by being down in Sodom and you see and you see people that are you know Christian people nominal people seemingly good Christian people and they're just vexed about how evil the world has become and that's all they talk about that's all they focus on it's hard being a Christian today look at the world's getting more evil look at all the trouble on every hand look at all and all they see is the negative side amen now what good would have been Abraham if he went down and joined lot down in Sodom because two lots would have just had more of a conversation than one among themselves they would not have been able to help one another if lot was a whole group of people and they just were talking about these things it wouldn't have helped them right he needed someone who wasn't even because even lot we're going to realize he hinded Abraham's walk after this happened after they separated then God said look at north south east west this is all yours so lot was actually a hindrance to Abraham's Faith right but Abraham never gave up on lot but the power that Abraham had to help lot was was Abraham Walking with God so we got to realize we don't put people in categories we got to realize just stay in your position you will help no one joining them becoming like them okay you can only help friends family loved ones whoever it is by staying in your position and walking with the word that's the only way you can help anyone amen so so they were vexed they were your lot was troubled down in Sodom but nothing nothing he did or said helped the city at all sadly right and so now so Abraham did not follow him down there but yet when God came his way what was what was Abraham's burden what about if you find 50 righteous in the city will you say he came it down to 10 I believe if he combed it down to less Sodom Gomorrah wouldn't have been burnt up right but he he was interceding for his family with God and because he was separated unto God see there's power and separation we're going to get into it soon well maybe we're already into it but you know there's power and separation and you see he stayed in his position and and lot was brought out of Sodom he didn't walk out himself he didn't come to a point and say I'm sick of this stuff let's quit let's go let's go back farming again no he was stuck in this rut he couldn't get out of himself and people who are stuck in sin blinded by the world they can't get out themselves they need a stronger one to come down and get a hold of them well how can that take place you staying in your position interceding for them and God can go get a hold of their life Hallelujah you take Peter in the prison he was stuck in the inner prison he couldn't get out but they're having a prayer meeting at John Mark's house and an angel came and loosed him and Peter thought he was in a dream when he was woken up by the angel all these things but when he came out of this came out of the prison he realized man that wasn't a dream I just got loosed amen hallelujah so amen why because they were consecrated to the word they consecrated to God God could move on on his behalf amen but you see lot is looking for all the wrong things they want see every nation or every movement they want a Superman they want an anointed Messiah Amen to to to push their own agenda amen Russia wants a Superman amen the America's looking for one the Eastern world's looking for one the un's looking for one America thought they had one and Trump because they're trying to bring a religious political move to restore Christianity to the world you'll never do it you'll never do it amen all it does is entangle people to take them to the battle of Armageddon that's all it does unfortunately I mean just like the Jews there before the destruction of Jerusalem those religious political Jews were the ones that caused that Revolution against the Romans they were the ones that caused the temple to be destroyed those were the ones that caused actually those Romans to come and slaughter them all Russia's looking for a messiah that anointed brains that knows how to conquer out of space for them beat ion to the Moon they want to conquer the world but you see the bride has received their Superman we've received our anointed Messiah the word amen we have our super man we're not looking for an anointed one to come and save the day he's already turned up amen he's already just like with Abraham he turned up before lot ever went down into Sodom and Abraham was walking with them praise the Lord amen but you see now when people are looking for a messiah like this they actually turn God into an Aaron boy but you see when they ask these things what is those things looking for a Superman to save the day see when they ask these things ask for this they don't ask as Jesus asked you try to make God like an Aaron boy Lord you do this for me you do that for me and you go do that tell them what to do Jesus said when you pray pray like this manner Our Father which art in heaven Hallowed be thy name thy kingdom come thy will be done who finds where we do that you're always wanting God to run errands for us or do something for us but when we're willing to say thy will be done commit ourselves to him commit our ways to him all that we are committed to him that's when God will move when you're willing to let him work on you not you work on him who wants God to work on them hallelujah amen amen hallelujah now you see Abraham separated himself from lot and God's word calls for a total separation from unbelief God's word calls for it right because God wants us to get into position that God can use us to our full capacity who wants that a okay some of you do amen hallelujah I'm glad some do amen but you see we got to separate to the word that God will do what he wants to do in our lives amen amen but you see see there's power and separation there's power and separation who knows that I'm probably preaching to the choir but there's power and being separated to the Lord see the devil say there's see he always says there's the you can't you can't and you can't you can't do this you can't do that you can't see this you can't watch this you can't and the reason he's giving you the count is he wants you to do those things he can jump in your life and destroy you right see see 100 years ago 60 years ago people would struggle with short with your short skirts that' be a struggle now it's with drugs and pornography you know these demons are a lot more in this day so but you can't sit on the fence if you sit on the fence those things will get you but if you're sealed in the devil sealed out amen so if you're sealed in by the Holy Ghost the devil's sealed out right so we don't want to just sit on the fence now the mother of Samson was told that she should be separated to God God because the son that she would have would start to deliver Israel from the hand of the Philistines see so it wasn't just God putting some Grievous burden soall upon her for the sake of it but he is telling her you separate unto me a deliverer will be borne out of you and it's the same thing with the church it's the same thing with our lives if we're separated unto God the Del not a deliverer the deliverer the Lord Jesus Christ will be birth into manifestation in our lives amen then he will begin to work work and deliver from every unclean spirit amen so so that's what he was told now now really what was set before her that day was life and death amen as it say in Deuteronomy here I call Heaven and Earth to to record this day I've set before you life and death blessing and cursing therefore choose life that both thy and thy seed shall live that thou mayest love the Lord thy God and thatou mayest obey his voice and that thou mayest cleave unto him for he is thy life and the length of thy days that thou mayest dwell in the land which the Lord swear unto thy fathers to Abraham Isaac to Jacob to give them amen so so these two things were set before her life and the law of life and the law of death you say well but that's Old Testament well the Apostle Paul would say this in Romans that the righteous of the law might be fulfilled in us who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit for they that are after The Flesh do mind the things of the flesh but they that are after the spirit the things of the spirit to be kindly minded as death so to be kindly minded is not just a bad idea it's not just a headache it's not just some regret it's death I mean but to be spiritually minded is life and peace Lord so you can't be you can't be kindly minded and have life and peace those things do not overlap am mean the devil wants you to think it is but you can't have life and Peace by being kindly minded right now to be spiritually minded is not just to post nice you know have nice scriptures around your home and read the Bible from time to time and pray those things are all good but to be spiritually minded is have the Holy Ghost the mind of Christ in you everyone's gone real quiet on me are we but this is this is true right you've got to have you've got to have the mind of Christ to have life and peace amen because the spiritual because the caral mind sorry is enity against God for is not subject to the LA of God neither indeed can be so when that we are in the flesh so they that are in the flesh cannot please God right say but I'm in this body yeah you're in this body but what's what's motivating your life is it your carnal natural thinking you're born with or is it the mind of Christ directing you hallelujah amen you see now Samson was born Samson's parents separated to the promise and they got life but now every generation must walk with God see the younger generation cannot ride the coattails of the older and and and just feed off their Revival okay but every generation has a right a chance at the word of God to see signs and W wonders and miracles and God moving in power every generation has that right that's why we have Camp that's why we have church to create an atmosphere that every generation will meet God we'll know him in power we'll know him in the reality of his word amen that's what we want for our children don't we we want them to be filled with the spirit amen them to have test them to that that when we read the Bible read the book of Acts we say that's my daughter that's my son that's my spouse an ongoing testimony not just a one- Time testimony an ongoing testimony of God's hand in their lives Hallelujah see so Samson Samson realized he was born amen he had to realize he was born to conquer the Philistines but you see he came to a point where he thought he could do whatever he could dabble with wherever he wanted and he'd be okay but there's always there's always a too far now that doesn't mean there's not a way back but there's a way are too far right so he came to a point where where Dela Bewitched him by emotional manipulation to do what she wanted we don't want to do that amen amen but but you see so she he was deceived by the brother would say a deceived Church by the world said Delila is the world and Samson's the church and so now what happened is he did not stay in his position separated to God the first thing see see you never ever want to let the devil take your Covenant get between you and your Covenant with God Amen this is what happened with with with him he couldn't take the pressure anymore life got too hard but he allowed it to happen but that pressure of her constantly tell me your secret tell me this I thought you love me should be no secrets all this manipulation got too much so he thought I'm just going to quit and tell her cuz I want peace no you know it's like with Hamas someone I heard Ben Shapiro say it in a debate just a short clip he said now if if Israel laid down their weapon now if hamus laid down their weapons there'd be peace if Israel laid down their weapons there'd be a holocaust again right and people are saying you got to make peace you got to make peace in the natural they can't because the enemy will just keep taking and taking and taking and in the spiritual we can't make peace with the devil cuz he'll just take and take and take and put out your eyes you can't see the promises no more and take the power of God out of your life that you can't overcome anymore and make you a laughing stalk because you got to realize before he revealed his secret to her he overcame whatever she tried to bind him in yeah right so certain trouble came in the power of God Came Upon him loosed him from that trial you know something else happened loosed them right but then when he actually surrendered to her manipulation and we know the devil bobbed off his Covenant cut off his hair just like a woman as a Nazarite that's a sign of a Nazarite separated woman unto the Lord see you got to ask a question you take Christine's testimony of of why she didn't cut her here the anointing that came down that that preserved her life not once but twice what good would have been done to her if she cut her here and that man came in with a knife in the shop or or or stole the knife out of the shop she would have been dead she wouldn't be here right now I would not be married we would not have children right and what good would it have been if that pressure kept coming after that first testimony and she said well I'm just going to cut it anyway and this she's walking through the park that man with the four men and the dog she she probably wouldn't have be here anymore but because she stayed under that Covenant with God because she saw the angel showed her 1 Corinthians 11 saying this is why amen there's Angelic protection that whenever the enemy came along the enemy Was Defeated I mean when the enemy came to take her life he he couldn't touch her doesn't matter the circumstances that were facing her couldn't touch her so you got to realize it's the same thing all of us are under a covenant with God we cannot let the pressure of the world get too much that we'll cut off that promise amen we got to keep the promise cuz God will anoint that promise amen and come on the scene when when we even think it's impossible Hallelujah but you see now he Samson surrendered told her his secret and he didn't even realize the spirit of God Departed from him he wasn't even conscious that the Lord had gone and then when she said you know the Philistines are upon me he said I'm just going to do it like you I'm just going to free myself like before God's going to come down he's going to supernaturally deliver whatever more they didn't even realize that Spirit was gone he left his position of separation and look what it cost him look what it cost him he couldn't free himself so you got to realize that out the Lord Jesus is the Overcomer but yet he don't play games you know if we you know that's why the Bible says don't grieve the Holy Ghost whereby your seal to the day of your Redemption he'll just take his flight up into the rafters and he knows the condition that we need to get into repent wow right just like Samson he didn't lose the Covenant permanently but he lost it for a season cuz he had to come to a point where he said once more Lord where the death the self that he should have done in the beginning not just give his strength to God but his heart to God give his whole being to him which he should have done in the beginning he came to a point just once more Lord I'm willing to die with my enemy I don't care what this cost me I want to be restored cuz he felt those he felt that Covenant grow back in his life of those locks amen he felt and then he didn't even know if God would do it but he just called onto God once more and I believe it wasn't like a drama that you see pushes like this he just he just would have gone like this and they would have fell like a bunch of toys toy blocks amen but you see he when he came to that point just once more amen God came on the scene again so if Samson stayed in his position the whole time what could he have done what could he have done he killed more in his death in his life sure but what could he have done in his life now what about you and I maybe I'm just going to maybe just going to wrap it up there now I want to come to one more thing come to one more thing someone who's separated to God the word of God can flow through them if Samson St stayed separated to the Lord that word could have continued to flow through his life but he cut off that Covenant that's why you got to if you backslide you got to repent and come back to God you got to repent brother BR say it's even harder to repent and come back to your backl than when you first come that's what he said but you got to you you got to be willing to die out to those things amen see the Christian that's separated from the caral things of the world living in Christ Jesus where the word can flow through them amen a kind see a real believer is worth more than a 100 caral Believers amen he's comparing lot to Abraham but hey lot was still part of the program amen because of God's grace right but you see now we have we have the you say well okay I'm going to anyway I feel like I got a lot of hey but we're just going to wrap this up now people say but there's no all these things you believe are just added to the Bible yeah it's just an extra thing it's just adding to the word no it is the Bible right someone asked me a couple of weeks ago someone who's an alcoholic said to me you know oh yeah I know why brother Braham said that you shouldn't shouldn't drink and we and we've discussed it before he he was saying basically it's because of his upbringing because of what he saw when he was growing up you know packing the water to the still seeing drunk drunk woman and all these different things parting with men they shouldn't have been all that stuff that's the reason he preached against drinking I said no the Bible says a drunker will not enter into heaven so it's not oh brother braham's opinion it's the scripture right and all the things we believe are in the word we do not have like the Mormons another testimony of Jesus Christ no it is the testimony of Jesus Christ it is the Bible right and so now that's where God wants us to stay is in his word just like someone would say to brother br he says see a lovely person the other night talked to me come put out their arms around me said brother Braham I want to ask you something said if you just compromise a little this stuff that you're talking about I said what said all this baptism the churches of Chicago and all around us want you so bad but they're afraid you'll mention I said sure I'll mention it certainly I'll mention it well that's not the only thing they got against you I said then they're not um then they're not got against me pardon me I wasn't the one that said it God said it okay I challenge any of to come prove it wrong see said while you come you ought to agree and make Fellowship that's the same thing they wanted to do to him amen God don't compromise no sir he doesn't compromise he said now brother BR I want to ask you something did the angel of the Lord said we all believe the angel of the Lord did the angel of the Lord tell you this I said I don't care what the angel of the Lord would say if the angel Lord if he will say that but if he said something contrary he wasn't the angel of the Lord am mean I said regardless of what Angel anything said Paul said though an angel from heaven preach any other gospel to you let him be a cursed amen so these people were looking for a supernatural being to come and confirm the word did he say it if he said it I'll believe it but brother said if that angel said anything contrary to this written word forget it it's not the angel of the Lord you see but people will go after Fantastics all the time but we're going to stay in the word cuz this is our covenant with God Amen see but God backs up his word it's his word I said it's the word of the Lord sure all I ever know was taught to me by him I never went to a seminary or school that comes from him but I said whether it's contrary if it's contrary to that I wouldn't believe him because that's God's word first everything else be a lie God's word stay with it amen so the things we believe they are they are not added to the scripture this message is not another gospel it is the gospel of the Bible amen restored back in power and in truth amen hallelujah that's right so what should we do should we be all caught up with what everyone else is doing no Peter wanted to be caught up with what would happen to the man who who who who would not taste death but would see the coming of the Lord and Jesus saith unto him if I will that he T till I come but what is it to thee follow thou me all these things going on people doing different things what is it to thee follow him you want to help those people follow the word amen you want to see God intercede or God help those people follow the lord walk with him don't follow lot down to Sodom and try and get him out no let God you stay in your position and you watch the miraculous come into action amen it's absolutely essential we stay in our God given position don't be like Samson putting it putting your head on the lap of the world Amen don't be like that amen stay like Abraham Hallelujah this is what we're called to friends the Lord has made a difference between the world and the believer amen and it's because of the blood aren't you glad the blood can be applied aren't you glad the Holy Ghost can come in then now you are a walking billboard of God's Saving Grace he's called you to a high and holy calling and remember he doesn't call you to it to make you work it out yourself he lead you to that position amen so just keep walking with God don't be caught up in what everyone else is doing what is it to thee follow thou me amen what's going to happen to that what is it to thee follow thou me and let God come on the scene amen let's just finish there let's have the musicians please this morning Hallelujah we'll come back to this another time but amen don't worry about how Smokey it is our God is more than able hallelujah amen let's um let's sing that um let's sing that song Our God is tremendous and then um
