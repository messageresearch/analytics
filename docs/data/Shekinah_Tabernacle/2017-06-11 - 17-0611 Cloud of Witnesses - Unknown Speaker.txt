the service into your heads in Jesus Christ's name a preeminence now we are amen amen god bless you friends thank you musicians amen good morning everyone amen god bless you all it's good to have all the visitors here welcoming every one of you tries to feel at home amen unless just um this is go to Ephesians chapter two then we're going to go to Hebrews 12 again I want to just kind of continue want to continue on my thought about let us run but I want to take just the one other part of Hebrews 12 there but let's just go to it's got Ephesians two first two in verse 13 where we down to verse 18 it says but now in Christ Jesus you who are some time we were far off are made nigh by the blood of Christ for he is our peace was broken who has made one and hath broken down the middle wall of partition between us having abolished in his flesh the enmity having even the law of Commandments contained in the ordinances for to make in himself of Twain one new man so making peace that he might reconcile both under God and one body by the cross having slain the enmity dear by and came and preached peace to you which were afar off and to them that were nigh for through him we both have access by one spirit unto the father let's go to Hebrews 12 and verse 1 then we'll just read verses 1 & 2 again this is wherefore seeing we also are compassed about with so great a cloud of witnesses let us lay aside every weight and the sin that does so easily beset us and let us run with patience the race that is set before us looking unto Jesus the author and finisher of our faith who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross despising the shame and is set down at the right hand of the throne of God I mean God bless you all you may be seated today the prints of the Lord I'd like to take a if I could take a title I want to speak about the cloud of witnesses but I just want to really the take home thought today if you're wondering where I'm going with this is that when you die it just changes your dwelling place what you are now you'll be there right so that's basically where I'm going to go now we read there in in Ephesians 2 that our Lord Jesus when he died on Calvary that his blood his sacrifice bridged the gulf between God and men and that gulf came into came into being when when Adam and Eve felt and it was a blood sin in the garden then there was a chasm between God and man as I spoke about last Sunday of Heaven was effectively cut off for a man that man was basically a slave slave to the devil but but when God became flesh and dwelt among us and offered his blood on Calvary he bridged the gulf between God and man and that heaven became open to man once again and so now if we read let's just go to Hebrews chapter 10 I just want to read a few a few scriptures today but the blood of bulls and goats we we find when Paul as Paul is placing the the Old Testament and he's telling these Hebrews what what they had under the Old Testament he would he will contrast that what we have now is greater than what they had he's always making that contrast any because he shows that the you know the high priest we have of Jesus Christ it's better than earthly priesthood and that the blood of Jesus Christ is greater than the blood of bulls and goats and he sees here in Hebrews 10 and 1 for the or having a shadow of good things to come and not the very image of the things can never with those sacrifices which they offered year by year continually make the comers thereunto perfect for then would they not have ceased to be offered because that the worshipers once purged should have no more conscious of sins but in those sacrifices there is a remembrance again made of sins every year for it is not possible that the blood of bulls and goats should take away sin so he's saying that it's impossible for all of the animal sacrifices they gave all of the ordinances they went through it didn't change the nature of the people it did not take away the sin it just covered their sins over but the very nature the Fallen nature that man inherited through the fall we're still in the Israelite people I mean it was still in the believers in the Old Testament even David David was a man after God's own heart and he said I keep keep yo the Lord always before my face least I sin against him and he you know so he had a desire to serve the Lord and he was a man after God's own heart but then when he sure saw Bathsheba yo having a bath on a rooftop that evening all of that left him all of that was pushed to one side because he had a carnal nature that he could not overcome under the blood of bulls and goats it could not the blood of bulls and goats could not change that carnal desire so when sin presented itself no matter how sincere he was how much wanted how much he wanted to serve the Lord he could not overcome that fallen nature that he had a means so now this is true all the way down and it shows very easily that man even even in this modern era unless the life of God really comes upon you you we may have the right intentions to be Christians we've had may have the right to the desire to serve God and why don't you know go to church and have a real sincere desire you know but unless God changes you unless God changes that nature then you will still fall and fail you will still be face down your slave to sin and that's why it's more than just confessing I believe in Calvary but this life that was released there through the blood has to come to you and change you that must happen it must bus must be more than just a confession but you must really possess or really have the life that was released amen because if we are Christians it's not us living anymore but Christ that lives in us I mean so our actions how we dress the things we say the things we do all of that is not governed by our desires governed by his desire and by his life amen it's like a lady that is pregnant with a baby you know they begin to get cravings right they begin to eat things maybe they never really liked before because and they do things that they wouldn't do I mean I mean they stop doing certain things because they want to protect the life that's within them so the life that's growing with them them is dictating to them what they eat and what they do and is the same thing with the Christian life when the life of God comes into you not just imagining it but it really does and that life will dictate to you what you do Amen what you eat spiritually add naturally you know all those things because there's a life that is stronger than your own because you have given your will over to his will amen so now there was this great gulf but the blood of Jesus Christ has has bridge that gulf now it says in Hebrews 9 and 22 I just read it and almost all things are by the law purged with blood and without shedding of blood there is no remission and that word remission means there is no means freedom it means a pardon a deliverance of forgiveness a Liberty so it says without the shedding of blood there's no freedom there's no pardon there's no deliverance so there must blood had to be shed in order to free the human race blood had to be shed to for us to be free from our fallen your human human nature that we had now man when he is born we are born fallen we're born lost right and so we are born with a carnal nature we receive it from our parents from our culture you know from our surroundings those things molars a certain way and you see family traits you know down through from grandparents down the way to you know to grandchildren that's because there's in our genetic DNA you know and in our spirituality in albia because there's a family spirit that comes down through that is passed down through so we're born in that fallen state but we cannot get to heaven in that state Amen we cannot expect to take a rapture in that state that's why Jesus said you must be born again right and being borning it is not just saying a sinner's prayer and staying in that state that may be the beginning of your walk but being born again as your actually your heart your very being who you are what you like what you do your very nature is change Amen with a person you once were you no longer that person Amen so that must be the case brother Graham says in the present stage of my ministry in 62 he says now then you see Christians when he dies he goes under the altar of God right into the presence of God under the altar and he's at rest it is to break it down when a man has a nightmare he's not altogether asleep neither is he awake he's between sleep and awake and that's what makes him having a horrible shaking and screaming because he's not asleep he's not awake and to take that shows where a man goes when he dies unconverted he's lived this time up he's dead on the earth he cannot go in the presence of God because he's not fit to go there without the blood and he's caught and he cannot come back to earth because as times finished here on the earth and he's caught between and he's in a nightmare see he can't go into the prints of God to rest he can't come back to earth because his times up he's in a nightmare and there he stays until the day of judgment a horrible thing to be and see so he says without the blood of Jesus Christ you cannot go to the presence of God and effectively the people are stuck in a night me when they died he said that's a horrible picture because it is a horrible thing amen but we remember we have a blood this morning we have an atonement this morning where we do not have to you know go into basically a nightmare until the day of judgment but we can go into the very presence of God now I just want to really show you that people when they die they don't sleep you know many people think of all sleeping basically that when people die they basically sleep like we do naturally they're not conscious of what's going around them you know but their sleep until the day of judgment but that is not scripturally so it's got to first Thessalonians 4 I'm going to show you a few things basically here's the some of my sermon if you love him here you'll love him there Amen if you believe in them here you'll believe in them there if you love as presence here you'll love it there if you shut when he anointed comes down you'll be shouting there Amen with you know but if you don't love him here you weren't loving there if your data here you'll be ad out of there if your ass corner here you'll be a scorner there if you're a scoffer here you'll be a scoffer there if you're an unbeliever here you'll be an unbeliever there the nature that you die was is a nature you will still have over there amen so but that's why you say that's a pretty negative kind of way of putting it no because there's a blood this morning amen there's an offering Amen there's a Living God that can change your nature I mean not just cover your sins but obliterate your sense a mentor they're not late to your charge anymore that should you die right now you're going to go straight into his presence amen we have that assurance now 1st Thessalonians 4 and 13 he says but I would not have you to be ignorant brethren concerning them which are asleep that you sorrow not even as others which have no hopes are going 1st Thessalonians 4:13 down to 17 for we believe that Jesus died and rose again even so them also which sleep in Jesus will God bring in them for this we say unto you by the word of the Lord that we which are alive and remain unto the coming of the Lord shall not prevent them which are asleep for the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout with the voice of the Archangel with the Trump of God and the dead in Christ shall rise first then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the lord in the air so shall we ever be with the Lord wherefore comfort one another with these words and if we we won't read it at the same time continue reading the next you know chapter 5 and Paul is still speaking about the same thing he says brethren you know this day will not take you as a thief Amen because you're not of the night you're not of the you know you know you know those that are in the night sleep their drunken but ye are children of the light you're children of the day a mess you're saying this day will not overtake those who are alive for awake I mean who remain how do you remain you are in the present truth you're walking with him I mean that's how you because everyone is alive naturally but you remain is to remain in the truth I mean such as we read there there's a couple times we said they are asleep you ever read that in verse 13 and verse 15 but that word asleep and I'm going to show you the word did as well as to sleep it says to slumber and that is actually to be dead to be deceased that's the that's the definition and then now when we go down to let's go to mark chapter 5 I'm just going to show you how these you know we read you know these here we read asleep we can read it but in the Greek it can be very different things right so we're just going to do a bit of a bit of a Bible study if that's okay because we got to understand you know this life is but a vapor and life continues on either place you go wherever you choose to go you'll still be alive amen and Eliezer be a glorious thing it would be a horrible thing but I love it how God is a gentleman he doesn't force anything upon you he doesn't make you get to heaven he gives you a choice Amen he gives us free moral choice and so we can choose you say what about predestination God knows who's going to be there but yet in time he gives you choice Amen God knows the end from the beginning cuz he's outside of time but within time he gives you a choice Alleluia I'm glad he gives you a choice Amen now mark 5 and 35 this is the story of Jesus going to two dry seas house and to raise his daughter now while he yet spake there came we're just going to jump halfway through the story while yet he spikes a mark 5 35 down to verse 42 while he expect there came the ruler of the synagogue's house certain which said they do did why trouble saw the master any further as soon as Jesus heard the word that was spoken he said unto the rule of the synagogue be not afraid only believe and he suffered no man to follow him save Peter and James and John the brother of James and he cometh to the house of the ruler of the synagogue and see if the tumult and then that wept and wailed greatly and when he was coming he said unto them why make ye thus adieu and weep that the damsel is not dead but sleepeth they laughed him to scorn but when he had put all of them out he taketh the father and the mother of the damsel and then that were with them and entered where the damsel was lying and he took the damsel by the hand and he said unto her Talitha I don't know how to pronounce that which is being interpreted damns lice out of the rice and straightaway the damsel arose and walked and she was of the age of twelve years and they were astonished with great astonishment and he charged them straightly that no man should know it and commanded that something should be given her to eat so now there's come a report that the damsel is did and she died she literally died but Jesus is saying well then why would Jesus say she sleepeth but is not dead it's because the word did we read it means that means dead death you know to be slant but it denotes a separation a departure amen a completion so did in the Bible language isn't he as a total separation from God that you cannot come back to earth amen but you have you've gone to your eternal destination that is real death right it is eternal separation of God that is real death right but for her to be asleep sleep at there so so she is so Jesus saying she hasn't gone there but she's just dead amen he following me so when Jesus when Jesus and John chapter 6 and verse 48 he would say I am the bread of life so Jesus is speaking to the scribes and Pharisees and they said our fathers ain't better in the wilderness you know had the splitting rock they had Moses and Jesus says I am that bread of life your father's deep did eat manna in the wilderness and I did this is the bread which came down from heaven that a man may eat thereof and not die I am The Living bread which came down from heaven If any man eat of this bread he shall live forever and the bread that I will give is my flesh which I will give for the life of the world so this this word here that there that they did means they are turn lis separated from God they were they they spurn their mercy they did not believe that God could take them into the Promised Land they believed the evil report of the spies though they received the blessings of God amen they saw the supernatural hand of God to deliver them right they were delivered out of Egypt yeah Paul speaks around the book of Hebrews so they came all the way out of Egypt under the mighty hand of God by the word of a prophet they received the you know the you know the law and the law was a was a right approach to God with the offerings and the sacrifices and all those things but yet they fully didn't go into the arrest into their inheritance safe because they disbelieved God during their journey and Jesus and they all had to die in the wilderness because of their unbelief and Jesus is the everyone did they're all separated their God they meant that's why he's meeting by did and so so a real death is eternal separation from God member there's two places we can go this may be very elementary it may be you know just take it for what it is okay so there's two places we go there is there is heaven and we'll and I'll show you in the Old Testament there's a place called Paradise was Jesus emptied out because under the bull under the blood of bulls and goats man could not go into the presence of God they had to go to a place called Paradise because there was still the sins they did were only covered amen so the Satan still had an accusation against them but when the blood of Jesus Christ came he cleared the dead amen he led captivity captive he ascended on high we'll read about it in the book of Ephesians he emptied out paradise and so man was waiting there the redeemed were waiting under that place so they were waiting there but in the lost who who rejected what God has done they went into the one is called Hades the grave which is the regions of the lost mean but there's no blazing hell right now that's the lake of fire okay so now so when people I'm going to show you a few scriptures to show when people die they are not like a sleep like we sleep okay so let's go to first Peter 3 and 18 first Peter 3 and 18 so if you wanted a shouting rejoicing time maybe the wrong weekend but we'll see how we go okay but at the moment just bear with me bear with me because you got to understand what you are now if you redeem now you're redeemed there amen if you love him here you love his presence you'll love it there amen that's why it's so glorious if you have if you're sealed unto the day of your Redemption by the Holy Spirit which you can see in your life amen it's as good as if you're in heaven now it's as good as if you're on the throne now because you have what you need to get there and remembrance by his Spirit you'll get there right so if you haven't if you're not just a professor but you really possess eternal life amen it doesn't matter what happens to you life can go terrible you know you can you know it doesn't matter how bad things may get you happy you possess eternal life I mean we don't just talk about it we really haven't hallelujah so it's a glorious thing so now it says in first Peter 3 and 18 so this is when Jesus remember he he he went to Calvary on our behalf he died in our place he purchased our Redemption and then they took his body and they put it in the tomb but Jesus didn't stay there I mean Jesus it says now for Christ also has suffered once for sins and the just for the unjust and we are the unjust he suffered for us that he might bring us to God being put to death in the flesh but quickened by the spirit by which also he went and preached unto the spirits in prison that would sometimes were disobedient when once the long-suffering of God waited in the days of Noah while the ark was preparing wherein few that is eight souls were saved by water so the people that that that hurt Noah's message but they laughed at him because it sounded ridiculous member never rained in those days only a Jew fell upon the earth there was no rain and here's a man saying I'm building a boat the world is going to be covered in water and they'd say that's ridiculous our scientists have proven that there's no rain we have never observed the day of rain how you think it's going to how you think it's going to you know flood he says because God told me and they would have been member man has always been religious so they would have been religious back then as well and they would have gone to their churches or whatever they did and said now Oh prophets Oracle's or priests whatever they're called has has our gods ever told us it's going to rain I said no it's not in our Bible it's not the accepted religion of the day and they would say no you're mad but he wasn't mad he wasn't mad and so those people turned down their day of mercy and when they drown in the flood they would they went out and they were in prison waiting for the day of judgment so they so Jesus yo you don't preach to sleeping people maybe I do from time to time but when he went he went down there to the regions of the lost the souls are in prison and preach the church service to them he preached to them and they heard what he said right so they were they were alive not not in these kind of bodies but they were conscious right they knew what was going on and they heard him preach they were not asleep as we would think sleeping okay cuz when you're asleep you're not aware what's going on around you okay and then let's go to revelation 6 and 9 revelation 6 and 9 that is it now remember I just read it this is the so the book of Revelation Revelation chapter 1 it's a book of symbols what John is told what he sees right in a book it's an inn you know and it's a book of prophecy so it's a symbolic book just like the Book of Daniel but notice this that when he had opened the fifth seal sets Christ opens the seals the Lamb of God I saw under the altar souls of them that were slain for the word of God and for the testimony which they helped and they cried with a loud voice saying how long O Lord holy and true does thou not judge and avenge our blood on them that dwell on the earth and white robes were given unto every one of them and it was said unto them that they should rest yet for a little season until their fellow-servants also and their brethren that should be killed as they were should be fulfilled now we have a group of people here that have been killed right and they are actually calling on God so they're actually say they are prey they are calling on God when are they going to be avenged so they're not asleep I'm just you say well you're repeating yourself I really want to emphasize this because these people we understand now they had now let's just break this down a little bit so they are slain for the word of God and for the testimony which they held now if we go to revelations one and one we read this so these people are Jews okay that they I'm going to paint the picture to show you that this is true now the revelations one and one so they remember they had that Word of God and for the testimony which they had now but if we go to revelations 1 and 1 it says the revelation of Jesus Christ which God gave unto him to show unto him unto his servants things which must shortly come to pass and he sent and he signified it by his angel unto his servant John who bare record of the word of God and of the testimony of Jesus Christ and of all the things that he saw so John had the Word of God but he had the testimony of Jesus because John is a Christian a believer but these other ones is unsay Eve it doesn't say any record of them having a testimony of Jesus Christ right because the because the Jews do not have a testimony of Jesus Christ they just believed the Old Testament because they were blinded that we would come in I mean they were they were blinded that we could come in but then notice also their their cry how long O Lord holy and true does thou not judge and avenge our blood on them that dwell on the earth so here's a people that are crying out for vengeance amen and we know the believer hello believers do not cry out for revenge they do not cry out that what God would settle their score or deal with the person that's used them wrong you know that is not the Hutt's Craver believer because we even see Jesus when he's hanging on Calvary he says Father forgive them they don't know what they do and the same life should be in you amen and Stephen Whitty when he was starting there in Acts chapter 7 he as his in verse 60 of Acts 7 it says and he kneeled down and cried with a loud voice Lord lay not this sin to their charge and when he said this he fell asleep he died I mean so that was the cry of the believers do not do not lay this sin upon upon them because it believer knows the severity of the punishment of sin Amen do we not amen if God had to become flesh and the wrath the the judgment that we deserve was poured out upon him that he was mud beyond any man on Calvary the severity of God's wrath was poured out upon a son on Calvary amen and he took our place and because of that severity of that judgment and we know how horrible it would be a meant to to be lost and go to help maybe that's why we're never and the reason people are lost is because they do not they do not allow God to take this sin away I mean but they hold on to it they hold on to religious first they hold on to their fallen state and they literally allow those things to drag them down into you know you're down to be lost and because you know how terrible that would be we don't want anyone to be lost I mean we would not even our worst enemy we wouldn't know why's rejoice when they are cast down passed away amen so here's these people that crying out for revenge and we know you know the law is I for an eye a tooth for a tooth amen that the that the score had to be settled so they're crying out for that and so these people are not Christian people they are the Jews a mint and as God's great mercy and grace they're from Calvary down into now all the true believer the juice amen they're given white robes which means eternal life they are given those things even though their forefathers rejected the very blood but they had two that we would come in because God doesn't deal with you and Gentiles they've done amen so these people are alive they are conscious of what's going on they know they have been killed so they have memories of being upon the earth right and so then they're crying out for revenge so these people are not asleep and it's the same thing now when we go to revelations chapter five and the lamb takes the book amen dezik there's a worship that goes on that worthy Oh God amen you have redeemed us back to God by thy blood I mean this Thanksgiving Alleluia there's rejoicing I mean because there because in that scene as you and that scene as me hallelujah Whoopie because it became a reality because how do you worship God we don't we do not worship God by things we learn remember and the Old Testament it was God revealed himself and then they worshiped him so God supernaturally revealed himself and they worshiped him and the New Testament well you're the gospel went into the Greek world and how do they it's all by head knowledge and so that kind of thought has been down through seven church ages as that of man knows the word mentally then they can worship God that's not how we worship Him we worship Him by revelation I mean when God reveals himself earlier that's how that's the only way you can really worship God I mean when it's revealed you you're lost but now you're found Amen that you are dead in trespasses but now you're being quickened now you've been alive I mean you can't wash room yo that is a healer and this is healed you I mean you can't wash him he's a redeemer and he's redeemed you I mean you cannot you cannot have a reality and this it becomes real to you right so so when there's that cry thou has redeemed us back to God then obviously there's a memory that once these people were lost but now they're found Alleluia so down through the ages we are still going to rejoice amen well down through the ages in eternity there's no time than we know but there'll be a worship from the believer we were lost but now we found Amen we were sick but now that then we got healed I mean we're broken but then we got mended hallelujah they'll still be a Thanksgiving amen because God wants us to know God wants us to really know you know Satan did God a favor in the garden by using the serpent to make the world fall because before there was a fall God had all these attributes enemy is redeem ease the hilary's restorer you know he's a guide he's a comfort he's an advocate he's the high priest he's he's the lamb he's the blood he's all these he's a father you know he's all these different things but he couldn't fully Express those things without their bingston amen so God knew before would happen because he knew all things but he allowed it to happen because God wanted to fully express himself to us hallelujah so it's really a glorious thing you say well I've had a horrible Road and many of us have but don't look at the bad look at the positive well what's the positive I'm not that person anymore I meant where well I was wounded in my spirit I was harmed I was you know terrible things happened to me but have you been healed of it amen how do you you know it's like like you know boys therican scars are cool these guys are cool right but it depends how you look at the scars I said last Sunday Caleb and Joshua they receive the same beatings in the same whippings the others the others wasted with no slaves but they didn't look at the scars of the beatings they looked at the promise because the promise they could rejoice because they weren't getting beaten anymore I mean but those could look oh that was a horrible experience sure it was I mean but they weren't those people anymore so it depends how you look at your sky do you look at you look at pain from your past as a horrible thing as in like you know you're still suffering from it or has the Lord healed you of it and then you rejoice I was once bound or hurt by this thing but now I've been mending I mean because scars should just be a remembrance of God's victory in your life it's all depends how you look at it now in faith because when faith got real faith comes unto you Amen it gives you overcoming power over those things and that you don't wallow and help me Lord yeah I'm so broken it's hallelujah I've been healed amen and those scars become trophies of God's grace in your life I mean like the woman at the well she could have either had a complex after coming to the Lord well I've been with five husbands I was with six and now I'm a believer or she could have rejoiced I had a man problem looking for love in the wrong places but then finally I met my real husband amen and now I'm free and I walk with Him it all depends how you look at it Amen but it takes God to reveal it to you amen so now this isn't recognizing your dana's message brother BAM says and this so he speaking of Moses and Elijah the prophets which the Jews only believe their prophets and they'll come forth with the sign of the prophets and their work will be of the Prophet they did exactly showing one thing that men when you die or whatever when you leave this world your nature doesn't change if you're a liar now you'll be a liar there if you're hot-headed there you'll be hot-headed there if you're a data here you'll be a data there men and women it's time to shake yourselves and to examine yourselves and see where you're standing for death does not change it they have been gone for two thousand years Moses about 2500 years Elijah ever since almost 2500 years has largely been gone and Moses has been gone and here they return with the same nature do the same thing death doesn't do nothing to a man but change his dwelling place doesn't change your nature doesn't change your faith doesn't change nothing and you about your dwelling place I mean so which away your nature is this morning if you're a data of God's Word you'll be a data over there I don't care how holy you are how you live how good you live it wouldn't change you one but two died just your dwelling place and if you can't accept the whole Word of God the way it is written you wouldn't do it there so don't worry says you won't be deal it's a bit of a stinger but it's true amen so this doesn't change anything about us you know brother Ron Spencer said death is just a travel bus to get us where we really want to go I mean because the believer has no fear of death I mean the believer was just it could be that's the glorious you know like brother Brown had had a campaign manager brother if if Bosworth you know and he was in his eighties I think you know he's dying and brother BAM went to see him on his deathbed he says you know and the brother Bosworth said to him this is the greatest day of my life is why is that because any minute now the one I've loved all these years is going to walk through the door and take me home Alleluia and he is the same God then as he is today Alleluia I mean let's go to let's go to First Samuel 28 I'm just I'm just emphasizing this whole thing because I really wanted to anchor in what we are now is what will be there okay you say well God is a God of grace and mercy he is but do you know what grace means it means it doesn't mean just a pardon but you can continue on but real grace if you go look in the Greek and the New Testament it's especially a divine a divine influence on your heart that's what real grace is a divine influence on your heart so God is not just some like a granddad that just lets you carry on do what you want to do and when people came to Jesus hears God send no more leads to worse than come upon you right so real Grace's is a divine your influence on your heart that's all real Grace's so now if God thou God and that's how credible it is where God can influence a person amen I'm not trying to draw this out but God when God influences you change and because it's a goodness of God that leads us to repentance it's not man's seven steps to becoming a Christian it's God's hand has to come upon you I mean that's why we must pray amen for for unsaved loved ones or family or especially children you know people we know God catch them God get a hold of them God change them because we can we can talk to them and we can try and do them right and put them right but unless God catches that person a mint because he caught me he changed me I wasn't looking for him he found me amen I wasn't raised in church amen I was making homebrew and a flat at university partying most of the week and God found me in that condition amen anybody doesn't leave you in that kind of condition because he changes your heart and you mean to realize what am i doing amen and then I had a burden I must know I've been forgiven amen and by His grace he showed me I was forgiven Alleluia so now there's a power prison that can change a person amen I lean on predestination I do but don't take it for granted amen don't don't take it well if I'm there I'm going to be there well they are you just throwing yourself on the sideline God didn't just God didn't make you like that we're not robots people aren't robots he doesn't force you to become anything but there's a power you say well Lord I'm not in that condition there's a power here to turn the heart amen should you so desire now so I first ml 28 now this is the account of where Saul now has become an enemy of God he's going to fight the Philistines in the morning but he can't he he cannot hear he can't hear from God in any way the anointings left them he's become an enemy of God by his own choice and and he can't hear from God in any way what to do so he gets so desperate that he goes to find a witch and then Samuel 28 and 7 we're just going to read down to verse 19 then when saul unto and then said Saul I do servants seek me a woman that had a familiar spirit that I may go to her and inquire of her and his servant said to him behold there was a woman that had a familiar spirit at Endor and Saul disguised himself and put on other raiment and he went and two men with them and they came to the woman by night he said I pray thee divine unto me by the familiy spirit and bring him up whom I shall name under thee and the woman said unto them behold thou knowest that what Saul has done how he has cut off those that have familiar spirits and the Wizards out the land wherefore then last hour sneer for my life to cause me to die and the and Saul spake unto her by the Lord I mean and Saul swear unto her by the Lord saying as the Lord loveth there shall no punishment happen to thee for this thing then said the woman whom shall I bring up again he said bring me up Samuel and when the woman saw Samuel she cried with a loud voice and the woman speak to Saul saying why has thou deceived me further for thou art Saul and the King said unto her be not afraid for what saw a thou and the woman said under saw I saw Gods ascending out of the earth and he said unto her what for mers-cov said an old man cometh up and he is covered with a mantle and Saul perceived it was Samuel and he stooped down his face to the ground and bowed himself and Samuel said to Saul why does thou disquieted me to bring me up and Saul said I am sore distress for the Philistines make war against me and God has departed from me and answered me no more neither by prophet nor by dreams wherefore I called thee that thou mayst make known unto me what I shall do then said Samuel wherefore then does they'll ask of me seeing the Lord as departed from the end has become my enemy and the LORD hath done to him as he spake Bobby for the Lord hath written the kingdom out of thine hand and given it to thy neighbor even to David because they obey us not the voice of Lord nor executed his fierce wrath upon emilich therefore had the Lord done this thing unto thee this day moreover the Lord will also deliver Israel with the into the head of the Philistines and tomorrow shall die and thy sons be with me the Lord also shall deliver the hosts of Israel into the hand of the Philistines so here is a man who was a prophet and his life he was a prophet a god-ordained prophet and when he was dead he was still a prophet amen he had a mantle upon Tomita prophets mantle and he prophesied tomorrow at this time you'll be where I am you and your sons he was prophesying you will die in the battle and Israel will lose the battle and it's exactly what happened see death doesn't change who we are I mean samuel was still Samuel Alleluia amen he say in it so it was he was still exactly the same person now death does not change your spirit or who you are only changes your dwelling place now if that's the case though you say well how on earth do I get changed from from this from this state into the state of the redeemed and it's a very simple process actually but before I go there I want to go to a I'll just leave it off so now here we are in this fallen state but God has to change us in order for us to go into his presence because sin cannot be in the presence of God amen in the Old Testament we had when God came down on Mount Sinai those borders put around the mountain where they could not even approach it because he's a holy God and he showed how severe sin was is that when a leper I mean anyone who got leprosy there in the Old Testament when they were there you're journeying from Egypt to the promised land they had to be put without the camp and therefore see is a type of sin that's how severe it was that God you cannot come close to me amen in that state so there as like anything man cannot help himself amen because we bought born in a fallen state so God himself had to come down to change man remember being a believer is not you changing yourself it is God changing you I mean because if you change yourself you've just reformed yourself you've just turned over a new leaf but I bet you assures the world the lethal turn back again yeah Amen so it has to be your nature you must have it you have to be changed and it's the same as the world the world goes from a dark chaos in the beginning but then it comes out into a new heavens and a new earth at the end of the Bible and we know that that new heavens and new earth is not a new one mate and is the same earth but it's been renovated right so the same way the earth is redeemed is the same way man is reading right and we know redemption is to restore back what it should be in the beginning so it so in the days of Noah the earth received the baptism amen it was immersed in water and Peter and the first church service ever preached of the New Testament era he said repent and be baptized name of Lord Jesus Christ for the remission of sin and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost I mean it's the repentance is a change of heart a turning from your wickedness to follow the Lord amen so now so in Noah's day the the earth was baptized but sin carried over over the flood amen man was still the same from the from before the flood as after the flood that's the same thing we may repent and be baptized but we can come out of the come out of the water still with our same old nature but we've started our journey that's the main thing just start your journey amen to start your journey and God will take you the rest of the way if you're willing if you're willing to go and then now with with the blood of Jesus Christ wait let's just go to 1st John 5 let's read the scripture just for you you say well where are you going with this I need to base it on the scripture so I'll show you here first John 5 because it's a journey amen where God takes you from one state and makes you into a symmetry now first John five and we're even verse four for whatsoever is born of God overcometh the world and this is the victory that overcometh the world even our faith who has he that overcometh the world but he that believeth on Jesus as the Son of God this is he that came by water and blood even Jesus Christ not by water only but by water and blood and it is the spirit that beareth witness because the Spirit is truth for there are three that bear record in heaven the father the word and the Holy Ghost and these three are one and that word word there means as son okay so they are one in the same but and there are three that bear witness and earth the blood I mean so the spirit and the water and the blood and these three agree in one so they're not one like God is one but they agree in one okay so now and we know that those three things water blood and and life constitute a natural birth the waters break in the month in blood and then there's a life the baby comes out and breathes in his life okay that constitutes a natural birth as the same thing with a spiritual birth okay and then so now so the earth was baptized in the days of Noah but son came over okay the nature of man had not changed and then now Jesus came and sanctified the earth by his blood he poured his blood out upon the earth with sanctified it which was the cleanse at the center and secta fication is to be cleansed and set aside for service so a cleansing now is when God takes you and takes all the your old lust your old desires the old things you used to do from your first nature and take it out of you I mean so things like you know people people you know if they're full of lust they have a temper you know they smoke they drink they they do drugs you know they run around with woman whatever it may be those kind of old things you're going to be sanctified of those things and it's the blood that sanctifies us I mean because God God does not dwell in an unholy place amen because the Tempio we as the scripture says we are the temples or the houses of God the believer is but he doesn't live in a polluted temple he may anoint someone but to be anointed is different to God coming and dwelling okay so there has to be a cleansing of our own that's why you got to say God take my life take my heart take everything I have wipe it clean that's anything that's contrary to you that you can dwell in me amen and he will he did it to me I didn't have Church I didn't have anything all I had was the message in the Bible and God transformed me amen because I see it because when you mean business with God God will mean business with you it's not just a lip service but when you really say God I'm sick of my life I'm sick of wondering and sin I you know I don't even know what this life was all about coming changed me that I can know you he will Amen bahid and I said if he did it for me he'll do it for anyone hallelujah so now we have to be cleansed sanctified and set apart for service but just to be sanctified is not enough I mean so someone can live a holy life never do something wrong just right act right do all the right things but that's just being set apart for service but then there is now a filling time where God Himself steps into that sanctified vessel and then he dwells in that person Alleluia and we can see this this is go to let's go to Acts chapter 18 because there is the promise as we read is I quote of max chapter 2 repent and be baptized name of Lord Jesus Christ and you shall be filled now we understand that some people can receive the Holy Ghost before they're baptized just like Cornelius's house in Acts chapter 10 while you Peter spake these words the Spirit of God fell upon them and Peter says can we forbid them water sing they have receive the Holy Ghost like we did right but then in many times it is afterwards now X let's read from acts 18 24 and I hope you don't mind we just doing a bit of reading and a certain Judah but that's how important don't just come up to sanctification don't just come up to a holy life I mean go all the way in to the promised because it's when he comes and dwells in you then when you really have overcoming power I mean by the blood of Jesus Christ just to be justified by faith that is good I mean just to believe on the Lord Jesus Christ repenting baptized that is good but do not stay there amen because because you don't wait why have the devil fight you and overcome you all the time why wrestle with habits and never overcome them I mean why wrestle with the things of the world and never be able to overcome them why wrestle with your own nature and never be able to overcome it when you can have overcoming power over the thing a me remember the Christian walkers a walk of victory but it's a walk of death to self amen and it's the only way brother Graham says if you want a total deliverance it takes a total surrender sir whew so if you anything less you'll never be totally delivered hallelujah and a certain Jew named Apollo's born at Alexandria an eloquent man and mighty in the scriptures came to Ephesus this man was instructed in the way of the Lord and being fervent in the spirit he spake and taught diligently the things of the Lord knowing only the baptism of John and he began to speak boldly in the synagogue whom when Aquila and Priscilla had heard they took him unto them and expounded unto Him the way of God more perfectly and when he was disposed to go into acacia the Brethren wrote exhorting the disciples to receive him who when he was come helped them much which had believed through grace for he mightily convicted that you can convince the Jews and that publicly showing by the scriptures that Jesus was Christ so this man was a believer he believed that Jesus was the Lamb of God take away the sin of the world he was shown from the scripture this man is the Messiah right right but but notice he's only come part way and it came to pass that while Apollo's was at Corinth Paul having passed through the upper coasts came to Ephesus and finding certain disciples he said unto them have you received the Holy Ghost since you believe and that's what it really means the original have you believed it since you believe not it doesn't say when you believe you believe have you received the Holy Ghost it's such a you say well that's quite a radical question that's the most important question have you received the life of God in you since you believed Amen I oppose it to you this morning have you where you say well of you know yeah because the politic and say well I I can see in the Old Testaments being a shadow I can see he's the Lamb of God I can see he's the high priest I can see I'll put it in today's language I can see what the seals are I can see we're at the end of all things I see God centers Elijah you know you know I see I see what it means to really walk with God I can see all the mysteries but have you received the Holy Ghost since you believe and it came to pass a while a polis was at Corinth Paul having passed through the upper coast came sorry verse two have you seen the Holy Ghost since you believe and they said unto Him we have not so much as heard whether there be any Holy Ghost that's incredible and he said of them unto what were you baptized so you put it down to his baptism because what he because a baptism represents what are you being United with remember you're showing that you're showing the unseen world I'm taking the name of Jesus Christ I want him to be united with my bridegroom with my sacrifice and they sit under John's baptism now John's baptism was fine but now it wasn't fine then said paul john bailey baptized with the baptism of repentance saying unto the people they should believe on him which had come after him even as on christ jesus when they heard this they were baptized in the name of the lord jesus and when paul had laid his hands upon them the holy ghost came on them they spake with tongues and prophesied and all the men were about twelve so here was a bunch of people though believers but they had they were walk in the past because god had moved on so they believed but paul said every received it since your belief so have you gone all the way amen and when they got baptized the right way because i already believers God gave them the Holy Spirit but see sanctification so don't just come up to a a walk of sanctification you've been sanctified they mean we must be sanctified I mean we can't just we can't just live the same old life and you claimed to be going in that number of the redeemed I mean because of your you know if you're still in that state here you'll be in that state there I mean but if you all justified and sanctified to fill with the Holy Spirit you'll be the same over there amen so now Jesus now his blood came upon the earth he sanctified the earth but then the enemy is still here right but then when there's the new heavens and you were amen the earth is baptized with a fiery baptism and all the devils and all the sinners burnt often and it becomes a new creature I mean it becomes a new creation and you ER and that's the same thing with us Alleluia and that's what must happened you say well what about the atomic destruction just before the Millenium well the devil still here but he's bound by circumstance he's bound by a change of circumstances he's got no one to work through during the Millennium it's the same thing with us we received because we're still in these bodies forgive me if I'm jumping around but we receive the Holy Ghost we're still in these bodies but now by his power in you the devil becomes bound where he has no longer the ability he may try and come and put thoughts into your mind and try and make you doubt and do all kinds of things but by the power of Jesus Christ by the spirit of life in you he is bound where he doesn't you have dominion over him and then now we are waiting for the full change now as that there's a change in these bodies amen which is like the new heavens and the new earth because remember the earth has scars the earth has scars you see great your volcanic upheavals great earthquakes you know you see your people dig down they find fossil records and all kinds of things because the earth has scars of previous destructions right and it's just like us we can go back into our life and there are scars just like the earth has scar but because the earth member in this book you know the earth I think it may be the only planet that's name is in the book of life right and because it's name is in there it has to be redeemed so if that is the case now those scars are not going to stay there because the earth is going to be renovated that all the scars are going to be taken out of it and it's the same thing with you and I we may be carrying scars but we're going to go on to new bodies with those scars are not there anymore amen but I trust and maybe I'll just close with this is that if the Lord is in you then you have a power within you that as I said a while ago the scars do not keep you weighed down but you rejoice because you've got victory over those things amen because a scar is a testimony of something you survived I mean I've got a hockey stick in the head when I was young I got my hand slashed open all different kinds of things there was when I was older but I survived them now look at the scars hallelujah I survived it and that's how you should look at them not trying to say these things a joke but all the things that happened to you in life I trust it's a scar in such a way that's just a trophy of I survived God saw me through hallelujah a mink we have some musicians to come so I'll leave you with this question where are you if you died right now I meant simple questions you know if you go right now what will you be what will you be over there will you be a data a scoffer making fun you know sometimes you other people we don't want to fall into the category you know I think you have the prayer meetings that we have and God comes down and people cry and they scream and they shout they do all kinds of things if you're sitting there and you see that happen don't make fun of those people don't don't belittle people that cried the presence of God or shout or scream because that is God anointing someone causing them to do it it's not just emotion that is God so now if you think about it oh well then what will you be up and up and glory is there going to be all the people around the throne because we're going to have a glorious time do you think we're just going to sit there saying how lujah put the crown on his head glory to God I know you have a time this is the quiet the earth is the most quietest place you'll ever be because heaven is going to be noisy amen so how's it going to be then because of because of when God comes down and everyone's shouting and rejoicing it's going to be like that up there but a greater way but then how's it going to be when people are sitting to one side looking at these people all these people are weird by the way why should she do that why is he doing this why's he looked crazy and shouting and starting all these clothing that's what they'll be like in heaven so don't make fun of people that are anointed and praying and rejoicing because you're not making fun of the person you're making fun of God acting that's why the day of Pentecost all these people are drunk with new wine making fun that's the worst thing you could ever say amen because of what M Peter says no this is that spoken by the Prophet Joel God's poured himself out into people amen that's why so we should never just look at the kernel you know don't make fun of any believer amen it should really be Lord yeah okay you take this in a very counter way you would take that into a just a rule at a party and people are tearing up the dance floor and rejoicing and shouting and you know having a great time people would think I want to have what they're having wouldn't you I was once upon time that was me what are they having I want to drink that but you come into the real things which and that will pass away this is eternal things we we're here to rejoice in and people will sit there and say this is all crazy I'll have nothing to do with this that's mad it should be Lord I want whatever they're experiencing get me into a place that I can experience that thing hallelujah I want to shout I want you know your brother Graham said about a yo you know there was a colored lady or you're shouting rejoicing and he just sort of fired half the victory she had how glorious would it be he didn't scored as he divided half the victory I mean so we shouldn't just sit back and say well those people they just built their way that's why they do these things that should be Lord I want to have what they're having I want to experience what they're having because that's how it will be in here amen and if people will be rejoicing and shouting at heaven you know I'd be like Lord I want to be that now because what you are now as I say if you are redeemed now not religious but you really know him not just religious and you know I go to church I read my Bible I pray no more than that but if you meet the author of the word I mean with the god of this message becomes alive to you amen and you love him and you enjoy his presence and you're looking forward to you know going from this world to the next world hallelujah you'll have that same rejoicing over there amen and I'll say this there is a power present to change us if you're not in that state you don't have to stay the way you are amen so don't worry about any fear while people think of you yo we sang I feel the pull you know and if there's something in your heart Lord I don't know really know who you are I don't know what you are but I want to know you he's present because that is God works on both ends I mean like at me I was so so something in me like Lord there's got to be more to life than this and naturally I was having the most greatest time in my life but I was empty I needed I was looking for more think what was happening God there's a deep there's a longing there's a deep calling to the deep and the reason there is the long in the soul is because God is calling a meant so if he's calling you should say thank you Lord here I come I respond hallelujah amen let's just add shall we this thing that I feel the pull don't be a doubter don't be a scoffer don't be indifferent amen they sing I feel the pull say
