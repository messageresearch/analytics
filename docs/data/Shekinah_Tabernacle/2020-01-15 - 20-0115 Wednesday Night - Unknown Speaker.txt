grant it amen amen praise the Lord Amen thank you brother Isaac I mean thank you musicians I mean good evening I mean God bless you all I mean youth you're in for a in for a good a good weekend it's been thoroughly planned you'll like it I believe you'll enjoy it but it is a day so I'm in Basel Lord so it's wonderful that you know the youth are coming down and Lord willing we'll hear from Taranaki a bit more on Sunday as well anyway I mean by trust you enjoyed the service on Sunday I listened to it then and and I just had a great time so I mean that was glorious so let's just go let's go to the scripture let's go I want to try and tie these things together but we want to go to Genesis chapter 5 and verse verse 21 I mean components of the bride in the scripture I mean I yeah I I enjoyed Sunday that was that was glorious you know amen thank you for your praise for us as well we we made it home in one piece we had a good time away and so thank you very much appreciate that I mean it's got a Genesis 5 and I'm going to read verses 21 to 23 and then yeah we're just going to read here and Genesis 5 21 to 23 and just keep your Bibles handy just as we go along it says an enoch lived sixty and five years and begat methuselah and enoch walked with god after he begat methuselah three hundred years and begat sons and daughters and all the days of Enoch were 360 in five years and Enoch walked with God and was not for God took him what a testimony Amen may the Lord bless his word you may have your seats this morning I mean I mean this night so what do I want to speak about I want to well I'm gonna go more into Moses but I want to continue I thought about seeing the two spirits within the framework of the church and and we know that you know II not care here's here's the seventh from Adam errs as a spoken of in Jude and we understand that we out of the seventh church age a bride is called to be translated to to walk from this world to the next world so we know Enoch Enoch was a was a prophecy or a type of you where people would walk with God and would be knocked because God took them so he didn't walk with anything else but he walked with God now Enoch had a head of ministry if we just go to Jude well the book of Jude it's what he knows that that that Enoch had a ministry you know many times well I used to think you know Enoch when I think about him maybe I've been reading too many children's Bibles but it's like a perfect blue day a blue squad day every day of his life everything goes fine he just walks with God and goes home you know but but we're gonna understand that you know that's not the case amen but wouldn't that be lovely but you know we have to overcome I mean we're good at yo God wants to prove his salvation in this day and he's going to prove it in your life Amen so in order to prove the power of the blood to prove the power of his word you would have come against some enemies amen but ultimately you know there's got to be there's going to be a faith and it's already been released to the church through the entire message a translation faith I'm in a rapture in faith that's already been spoken in this age and we have been predestinated ordained to receive that faith and to take a rapture I mean so we only read three verses but that but but those three verses we read in Genesis 5 speaks of your entire life because Enoch didn't walk with God 365 years he walked with God after 65 years so there's a time of his life he didn't walk with God but then one day God intersected his path at a predestinated moment then he began to walk with God and it's the same thing I don't know what he walked with before that time it doesn't matter the fact as he walked with God you know some people but they may even just walk with God one day and God takes them home but as long as they walked with God they fulfilled their portion of the word that's all that matters I mean so that's what we want to do you know we are predestinated people I mean and we're not predestined unto condemnation as brother Adrian touched on but we are predestined unto glory and to a rapture amen so now now we read here in Jude now Judas the last last um you know book before revelation and and entity speak about to earnestly contend to them for the faith that's once delivered to the Saints and he begins to speak about men who have crept in unawares yo this Antichrist spirits come among them but let's just go - let's just go I'm just gonna go from verse 10 but they speak evil of those things which they know not so speaking about antic religious people but they only can lis understand something they do not know the word by revelation but they know naturally as brute beasts and those things they corrupt themselves woe unto them they have gone the way of Cain now we know Cain rejected God's provide away he wouldn't accept the blood he tried to offer his own religion I'm just touching these things very briefly and he killed Abel the true worshipper and ran greedily after the error of Balaam we know Balaam zero as he as he caused he caused Israel to mix with my weapon and in fornication adultery take on their worship and stop them journeying from Egypt to the promised land now an antichrist spirit will always stop you trying to take your inheritance they'll always try and stop you wherever you are in your walk you may be in Egypt will try and stop you in Egypt you may have crossed the red seal try and stop you in the wilderness and it won't just try and stop you there it will even try and stop you when you've crossed over Jordan and will contend with you every step of the journey but you've got to have confidence when God said I give you the land I give you the full inheritance I mean it's yours hallelujah your footsteps of possession you ever going to go don't claim it right but the devil will try and stop you in every part of your walk even before you say yes Lord I'll serve you the devil's it a try to stop you amen you say well that's that's kind of annoying this devil's here to fight me yeah but we have the victory amen and and how can we be more than conquerors if there's nothing there to conquer right so there's got to be a war there's got to be a fight and we got to have some fight you know we were churning up to town where we stopped at the wire uu Army Museum and and it was quite neat to see you know New Zealanders all the way from even the first Boer War to Afghanistan and we never or first the Second World War that said that they were you know they always rose to the challenge and they were actually very excellent soldiers you know they you know general Rommel who was the he was a great general in the and the and the Nazi regime in World War two he said words this effect that if he had adjust a few battalions of New Zealand soldiers he could conquer the world so we appear to be laid back but when the challenge comes we raise to the challenge now that's just naturally how much more spiritually I mean so we appear laid back now we know we're not New Zealanders we're from heaven we just happen to live here right but I think that's the same thing you know the bride when the challenge we are laid-back because we're at rest God is doing everything but when the devil cot comes on our turf boy he's got a fight on his hands and he mouths oh just run because he's going to get whipped he's being whipped for thousands of years is going to get what plum more time holiest or whatever the end of it remember when the enemy comes in like a flood I'll raise up a standard and the standard is the anointed word and you Amen rising to conquer the fire of the enemy amen because the the revelation we have of who we are is prevailing against aim in the lies of the devil I mean that's why there's such a fight the devil says you're not a Christian you're not a believer you're not the bride you think you're this and that in that and you were to say well as brother agent said this is my marriage certificate this is my documentation hallelujah Amen hallelujah so Balaam tried to stop them there and there perished in the gainsaying of korah which is yeah Korah and that gainsaying and in the Greek I've got my major means against the word so a person being against the word being Antichrist of course how did he tried to make me rise up against Moses's leadership because God ordained Moses to take the people into the land but these men rose up thinking they were something and they tried to stop Israel going into the Promised Land and and Moses just said well if God do a new thing and he swallows you up well you'll see whose side is on whose side and the earth swallowed them up so the world swallowed these people up and you see people rise up trying to try to take away the power of the blood saying well we could just be Christians but we don't need to change we don't need to surrender we can do whatever we want what happens is they separate themselves having not the spirit and the earth the world swallows them up amen it's happened all the way down through the scripture it will keep happening maybe because spirits do not die so history repeats itself that's why you've got to see the spirit in you what is it motivating you to do is it motivating you to walk closer with God you want more of them or is it motivating you just to let go turn and and your fictions are on something else you know people felice sir into brother Bram says a statement he says if you want to be if you want to be a Christian be a total Christian you know he even says if you're gonna be a bumpy the best bum you can be I mean if you're gonna be something be the best so if you're gonna be a believer be the best believe you can be don't be wishy-washy inside outside that are if you're gonna be a Christian be a Christian I mean because it's the thing that stumbles people is religious people that's the greatest stumbling block the devil can put in front of other believers as other religious people and we'll come to that because that's what the devil tried to do in Egypt to stop the people one applying the blood in order to leave it an exodus so he says these are spots in your feasts of charity these are spots in your love feasts so these ones gather around they feed on the word they worship they rejoice but they're not the real deal remember I said Legion came and worship Jesus but it was the demons in him worshipping remember we read that weren't we so people can shout they can jump they can cry they can run around and scream but it's actually demon spirits worshiping God well it's very easy to see with Legion because he was naked in the tombs you could tell man this guy's not in his right mind right but then you but then it comes down to the you know it comes down brother and sister the thin edge of the wedge in this day this is the thin edge of the wedge where people can look right act right but not have the life just like brother Adrian put that quote up how those parents came to brother Brown said their son you know he wouldn't apologize that girl he was going with and he talked about their natural lineage and and how how but but the father was so convinced I know my son has come to Christ but he was not converted yet outwardly he went through the emotion of being a believer but he wasn't changed now what is that that is a Caine spirit trying to stop a person come to a birth because we must recognize what you once were should not be what you are now right sure we have a personality you know I will still be this kind of way but my unconverted self should be very different to my convert itself if you saw me how I as you'd say there is I trust a big contrast in me from into now but if I'm they're still the same old person but you're quoting scripture and quoting the message something hasn't happened yet I meant so we don't just want to be talking about being a believer but we want to be a believer where God has transformed us now sure above you but you know it's a process yeah maturity is a process but there's got to be a birth it's got to be something you don't just walk into this with age you meet him amen so these are spots in your feasts of charity now I'm just reading Scripture so I'm not I'm not throwing any javelins at anyone when they feast with you feeding themselves without fear without reference without godly fear clouds they are without water what's that a cloud without water has no substance got the nourishment and can't water the earth it can't it can't feed the ground it's just something that just blocks the sunlight we don't want nothing to block our sunlight right carried about of winds every wind of doctrine blows people around you whatever stabilizer in your life amen when you know if you're built upon the rock of Revelation nothing will move you things will try and move you I mean but when the devil comes in with with half courts and half Scripture and thinks there should be something in you saying hold on something doesn't something's not clicking this should be that alarm bell member my sheep know my voice you know and and a shepherd the real ship and a fake ship it can can't call the same name they can give the same instructions but then the ship will say no that doesn't sound like my Shepherd I mean but if you don't know the Word of God right if he and if you don't know the author of the word then a false shepherds voice will mislead you but if you know his voice through something and you say hold on this is not right that's why we know in reality there's no black gray and white the gray area is actually where there's no discernment to make a black or white I mean stuff this well I'm not sure about this you should pray about and say Lord show me what the black and white is in this gray area because it can look so nice it can seem so right but hold on and the Lord will show you in his word somewhere yes or no amen trees whose fruit withereth without fruit not producing the fruit of the Spirit amen twice dead plucked up by the roots raging waves of the sea foaming about their own shame wandering stars of whom is reserved the blackness of darkness forever and Enoch also the seventh from Adam prophesied of these so we just read about he spoke about under inspiration he prophesied these ones would come so he had a ministry behold the Lord cometh with ten thousands of his Saints to execute judgment upon all to convince all that are ungodly among them of all their ungodly deeds which they have ungodly committed and all of their and all of their hard speeches with ungodly sinners have spoken against him these are murmurers complainers walking after their own lusts and their flesh mouth speaketh great swelling words having men's persons in admiration because of advantage that is a lot of that but I'm just gonna leave it there buddy see he had a ministry so he prophesied of these so what is these the things we just spoke about and all of those spirits we just identified as to stop a people translating going from this world to the next world now Paul would write to timothy if we go to 2nd Timothy 3 I'm just gonna basically we're just gonna hit some highlights and then maybe we'll do some borrowing another time but you know I just want to give you these things because your God has fully equipped us to identify the Antichrist spirit and to withstand him not a person just like when brother bayon speaks against denomination he says no it's not the people it's the system because the system holds the people back there's good people in those systems and it still is right but it's the spirit it's a system it's not the people that's why Lord Jesus help us with wisdom as wise as serpents but harmless as doves help us our heart should be redemption right our whole life should be Lord I want to see someone meet you on a seesaw on being redeemed I want to see I want to see the power of the blood come upon them that same God I met I want them to meet that should be our houses I every where we go even if they don't you know what I read in the family ultra volume I think as one this morning of brother BAM says about some some believer said lord help me to speak but but give me a nod when I've said too much or give me a nudge when I've said too much so basically help me to speak to them but when but when that signal comes - hold on stop help me to be led by that because someone's to be above an opening and then no sometimes no opening than no sometimes a big opening there comes that you know you need wisdom when to speak to people but he'll guide us you know we just need to relax and let him have his way you know it's not we have this kind of pre-planned speech and you know kind of like a big like a pathway diagram talk about this yes or no speak about this yes or no this yes or no it's not about that don't just be led just let the Lord lead you amen hey if he lead all the prophets all the believers all the way down through do you think he do you think now I've got too hard to lead people that we're still the same people they mean second Timothy 3:1 notice also than the last days perilous times shall come now we understand in the scripture that a day a day upon the earth as a as a thousand years and and that when one thousand years is a day with God so in these last day in the last days plural mm two days two thousand years perilous times shall come we are living in perilous times for men shall be lovers of their own selves this is the age of the selfie why people are broadcasting themselves that's why I see many YouTube influences they get suicidal and depressed because they're trying to project themselves it's all about them and the more you try and push about yourself the more downward and depressed you'll become why cuz we're not built to focus upon ourselves we're actually built to help others amen life is not one big self vanity project it's actually we're here for one another that's all you know people sing that song it's all about you it's all about YOU Jesus I'm going back to the heart of worship well a lot of people actually sing it's all about me it's all about me Jesus it's all about him I didn't get that mixed up there is a song I'm going to to the heart of worship who knows it it's all about you well that's his word if it's all about him anyway lovers of their own selves covetous for a few people are satisfied with what they have in this day you want to read today's news oh this is the news right we don't want to be under this spook because this is an anointing right we are influenced by two powers God or Satan your choice your free male choice to be who's gonna guide you right covetous boasters this is the age of look how awesome I am proud and and pity party having a pity party's pride as well it's all about look about me look at what I'm going through look at this look at this no you got to take your eyes off what you're going through and look at the Word of God I mean but David in his great trial when his men consented to stone him when he lost all of his children and his wives and they lost everything at zyg leg he encouraged himself in the Lord he didn't say well poor poor as me well was me God look God United me to be Kingdom I mean want to kill me look how you gonna get me out of this mess no he encouraged himself in the Lord and that's how we got out of that and it's always through a time of transition when crisis hits because remember when he was a zigg leg saul has been taken out of the way the one obstacle that stopped him taking the throne was being taken out the way by God and during that time of transition this is where David lost all and we're going from this world to the next world amen our Lord Jesus go from son of man to son of David in the Millennium it's a transition our sin this transition out there has to be a loss but there has to be a a receiver getting back a redeeming of everything that's been taken amen that's why it doesn't matter what the devil is taken from you there will come a day and I believe now is we will get it back I mean where you have had to have god-given rights God it's my property Satan take your hands off God's property doesn't matter who does what it is give it back in the name of Jesus Christ and he recovered all that failed I believe we shall recover all that fail as well you ever think that person is not savable they've gone too far they've done too much who said I'm not God he's the righteous judge amen if Jesus could hang between heavens and earth on the cross and say Father forgive them they don't know what they do they saying Lord don't condemn them because of what they're doing give them another chance even Stephen said lord lay not the son of their charges they were stoning him that was Christ on display to be like Jesus we want to be like him amen without blasphemers no boasters proud blasphemers disobedient to parents don't let that anointing come upon you that's the first law of promises Oh children obey your parents in the Lord for this is right that's the first commandment with promise so you want the Lord to bless your life you want to serve God obey your parents because as you obey your parents you're serving God amen you know there there may be great battles raging in your family well then how do you actually win those battles serve your parents David was serving his father when his father said take take this food down to your brothers in the battle and he went down there Israel and and the Philistines are on either side of the valley Goliath came out made us both bring me a man bring me a man and here's a little boy who's just serving his dad operating in the body and this Devils making a boast he just says who's this uncircumcised Philistine you know and and and his brothers who just say to him you're just being naughty David go away you just want to see the battle he's serving in the body and the Devils on Ana's ground right and he takes that Goliath down amen we want to you know don't be just you know you say well my parents are old-fashioned dirty litter we the same Devils you fighting we have already fought them you may not believe that but it's happened they don't understand me oh yes we do but maybe sometimes we're gonna sit them down and say I was right where you were amen hey I was whatever age you are younger than me once believe it or not anyway without natural affection see people have no natural fiction towards family no loyalty towards anyone these days there's dog eat dog don't this anointing fall upon you trucebreakers false accusers incontinent fierce despisers of those that are good you know but jesus said won't you if all men speak good of you he said you actually you're actually in a bad state if everyone thinks you're awesome you know the biggest curt you you know the biggest problem brother man speaks there are three things that can that can doubt a minister and I'll say it's anyone money woman and popularity it's the popularity that's actually the most subtle dangerous one because people tribe I'll just be popular with these people of your influence with these people that I can do this now hold on we don't want to be I'm not this is not a popularity contest if this was a popularity contest this place wouldn't exist amen we would find the biggest church with the biggest one ever whatever would do what they do but we're gonna follow the Word of God I mean so it's not whatever no because remember a group of people yo the majority is not correct you say what do you mean we're educated we're smart Nazi Germany was smart too and they all swung under what Hitler was preaching those demon powers of being released on his words they came under that anointing and they and they massacred the Jews and all the gypsies and whoever else that they'd and all the undesirables educated nation so it's not majority is correct it's those that stand with God a correct but you take Micaiah there you know there's there's a habit I believe Jehoshaphat Jobs got 400 prophets Azrael Israeli prophets and they're about to go fight the battle and Ahab says you know we'll just get our prophets to prophesy they'll tell us which way to go and all they see with one Accord go up fight you'll win even the leader made some horns he got all the real charismatic and exciting until you work with these you'll push them out of the country of the enemy but the enjoy Haase Fett was a little bit kind of young here he had a bit more religion than have did hey she doesn't not one more who knows the story brother and place himself right in there and actually that's the bride's portion he actually where the bride is living out that scripture because it's not Elijah there Elijah's gone off the scene now he's another one standing by himself and they go get my car a hab sits at your house about are you there's one more but I hate him he always preaches against me he always balls me out tells me when I'm wrong Crick's me by the word you know he sees all these things and you know but John service is I don't need the King say so let's go get him so so some men go and get micaiah and they say don't dharmakaya you want her fellowship begin you want to be you're gonna be accepted you want to be popular again just say what we say this is what we've said this is how the meetings been going everyone's been sharing rejoicing has been wonderful revelation but McCoy says I only say what God put in my mouth he wasn't willing to be bad bye-bye bye-bye the pressure of a of a group hallelujah I believe I'm looking at some more cars here amen and then he and then he prayed and he saw a vision of Israel scattered on the yo on the hills without a shepherd and then he saw a big yo but but then the head prophet said you know when did the Spirit of God leave me and God you and he yo he slept him in the face and then Mike I said no I saw a lying spirit I saw a council up in heaven remember this word should connect us with what's going up on and him he said I saw I serve counsel up in heaven God sitting on a throne saying what can I do who can I see it because they had to fulfill what can I do to cause Elijah's prophecy to be fulfilled upon the earth and the lying spirit comes up from Hell says I'll go they'll believe me why will they believe him because they don't know the word they did not acknowledge the prophecy of Elijah right you see this world even now the Christian world thinks it's gonna all unite together and going to Christianize the world we're gonna bring everyone to get these to be great harmony but Elijah has stood on this day and says Jezebel is gonna be destroyed by a bomb and Ahab's going to be killed as well Russia will destroy both that's the prophecy of Elijah right so the vision that I received matched the prophecy of Elijah so he knew it was correct that's why we've got to look back into the message and say you know what was prophesied of this day and then we can see now the inspiration that comes upon us does that match the inspiration of the message or does it not because if it doesn't match the inspiration of the message it's a wrong spirit amen Yvonne singing I've got to listen to the message I've got to read my Bible more you do it's daily food kids about you know people get caught up Annie you know in Iran and and what Trump's doing it says in the book of Revelation God puts it in the hearts of men to fulfill his word right so don't be focused on what's going on over there look at where God is bringing you in your inheritance right where God is bringing you and your walk remember Enoch walked with God and he was not for God took him that's how we're gonna be I mean so so micaiah compared his version with the largest prophecy and it proved to be correct and he didn't he didn't bow because there was 400 prophets saying something different or the kings were there he said no this is what's going to happen because you have indicated prophet have been in the land and he spoke certain things we have to be the same way now we're worried this bunch right you're having a form of godliness but denying the power there are from such turn away now the power of God is not initially healing remember by His stripes we were healed so it's not even a miracle when people get healed because they're being paid for people all given faith to receive it it's already happen see see healing when we asked for healing it's actually Lord thank you you've already done it I've come to claim it that's not Lord can you heal me he has already healed you it's like it's not Lord can you save me he already has you have to accept it right but if you don't my brother I'm saying Jesus could be standing right here right now but he can't heal you because he's already healed you right he already saved you that down Calvary I mean you just have to accept it hallelujah are you glad that's here you just got to accept it say yes Lord I accept it amen so but the power of God denying the power of what that power to transformer people that the wood becomes manifested in them and its fullness a meant for the sort are they which creep into houses and lead silly woman women captive later with sins lead away with diverse lusts ever learning and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth now as Jenison Jambres withstood Moses so do these also resist the truth men of crop Minds reprobate concerning the faith but they shall proceed no further for their folly shall be manifested unto all men as this also was now jettisoned generous we understand were the magicians in pharaoh's court now just like brother Adrian said on Sunday Moses was the first Exodus prophet we know brother and preach a sermon the third Exodus and we were under the third Exodus now so now if a Exodus prophet comes he's going to take you from someplace didn't take you to another place but the thing is these two men here were working miracles in Egypt to stop the people trying to so they had in the heart of Pharaoh and it confused the people in order that they would not apply the blood and go in an exodus that was their job now brother branham he was the initiator history tells us and this is not even pro there's not even message believers it's just historians Pentecostal historians and even not even Pentecostal ones they said brother Branham has healing Revati initiated the post-world War two healing revival so he came with the two science I mean the angel Lord came down people knew the angel was there he had a ministry that eclipsed everything else but then what happened is there was other people said I can do that too and they imitate it some could some say they could smell demons others said they could yo you know that you know they tried to impersonate the gift in the hand or you know saw balls of fire and blood coming out of hands and oil and different things they were impersonating what was going on but Moses came I mean brother Bram came with the gift first of healing to show God was Allah just like Moses he cast down the right into a serpent first and then Jennison Jerry's the magician's cast down their rods right so so so God God through the Ministry of the Prophet now what I'm doing is I'm showing the scripture has relived itself right so I'm showing that we're still living in the Bible this is not just some obviously book where we try and get stories and make it match no history has repeated itself and then so here here brother Bram did they did the two signs first and then surely after that many other people were inspired by his ministry and and the and the healing revival became crowded with many other ministries there was at the height of the healing revival there was about two hundred tenth healing revivalists they would travel with their own tent that hold healing revivals in America 200 of them that's not even people who just operated out of churches so so so the whole arena became flooded with these other ministries what is it to confuse the people to stop them I'll say applying the blood to go in an exodus right because if the blood has really been applied why why does that now we know in this day it's not the chemistry of the blood I could have a vial of Jesus blood right now can be authentic proven but it will do me no good because it's because that Bloods been here boots a life in the blood I could physically cover myself in his blood but it won't change my soul right it's the life and that blood has to come unto me and transform me change my nature come and dwell in me and and if that happens now then the power and the blood has come upon me now I'm a new creature I meant so so it stops people what does it do you know we're not here to promote any church you go read the history of the healing revivals / so people had you know like there was this young little you know a preacher boy David or whatever it was other denominations had their boy preachers there's all this great big competition but what it was it was to exalt at a denomination or a church movement we're not here to exalt any church I would like it if they we did even have a name on the door we don't need it we are Christians we're not here to promote a brand amen who cares about the name even who cares about the building I appreciate the building you understand cuz we can gather but it's not about this is not building an earthly Kingdom that's like I remind him brother ed were at dinner you're at our place brother a man was saying about Enoch because Cain had a son called Enoch and he built a city called Enoch so here was the perverted type building the so it's Oh God through through Seth slide head and Enoch he was translated into heaven Cain had an Enoch and he built a city upon the earth showing that that that that the devil was perverting even Enoch now through the cane line to actually say we're just going to build a kingdom upon the earth this one is not interested in being translated but God's one called Enoch took a translation right so we're not here to build an earthly kingdom who cares who cares about some brand or whatever I'm not interested no the kingdom of God is within thee what is the what is the mission statement of this church that God the Word of God would be would be made flesh in you and I that we would have a genuine real personal relationship with Jesus Christ and that's not a catchphrase as actual reality he becomes your best friend he becomes your comforter he becomes your guide he becomes your all and all more than your next breath you'll love your joy everything you are is wrapped up in him and he is the word amen that's the mission statement that's why we're here and whosoever will let them come Amen so I'm not interested in building an earthly kingdom I don't care amen so now Jennison generous they were there and they would and and they were there to confuse the people to stop them applying the blood to leave now because as you read through Exodus you can see that they did up to a certain point the same miracles Moses and Aaron did so the first one is recorded as I said about these snakes Moses got Aaron to cast down the rod and it became a serpent Pharaoh said I've got boys that can do that too and they took this rods and threw them down they became serpents as well but Aaron's rod swallowed them up and then he picked it up by the talat turned back into a ride well where did their rods go wasn't that one showing that the power of God consumes the enemy right and also I have power to bind them power to loose remember Pharaoh was the Cobra he was the king he was the God over over Egypt but but Moses as he as he put the rod down or Aaron did he sees a power to loose you to move then I can bind you I can make you stick again so I can loose you and bind you as much as I want until my job is done showing that we have the same power to loose the devil and to bind the devil it's been given to you hallelujah Amen so so Jennison generous the other me you're the court magicians did the same thing and then when Moses turned the water into blood Genesis generous turned the water into blood and then even even in Exodus 8 which is where civil innate as where these are mainly recorded they actually called frogs forth as well after Moses did but as after Moses did something they just copied it now it's amazing the thing is they could bring frogs but they could never take them away now in the book of Revelation we see that out of the mouth of the beast comes three unclean frog spirits like like like frogs so there's actually demon powers being released and so now Pharaoh Pharaoh's magicians could actually release these frogs but they could never take them away and Pharaoh actually says to Moses can you take them away and Pharaoh actually says let's just read it because to me this is astounding let's go to Exodus 8 and 9 X to the Seder 9 and Moses say Amen when you are there and Moses said unto Pharaoh glory over me when shall I entreat for the infamous servants and fly people to destroy the frogs from me and from my houses that they may remain in the river only and he said tomorrow and he said be it according to thy word so basically Moses is saying to Pharaoh when do you want these demons to stop plaguing you and Pharisees tomorrow I'll spend another night with these frogs and that's the insanity of some people you can be free but they say tomorrow I'll have another night with the devil why tomorrow don't you want a good night's rest don't you want peace for your soul don't you want the assurance that you know that you know that you know that you're gonna leave in a rapture tomorrow that's what he said Pharaoh you picture it you know who's seen the cartoon yeah here the children Bible yeah this fair honest road and frogs are hopping over them and all over the place and the servants are trying to scare them away they're everywhere it wasn't just one there one there that way everywhere it's very saying tomorrow so Pharaoh do you really want listen you're being again tonight well I guess I do I see tomorrow do you really want them in your pantry in your fridge you know and your closet and your hole in your bath and your shower everywhere yeah tomorrow that's how some people want to be they want to live with the devil one more night why oh why yeah can you put yourself imagine living in a house full of frogs and you got into your car it's full of frogs and you go to your school and it's full well people say well yeah it's full of frogs I know but you know you go to your work they're just everywhere and yet say no tomorrow keep them you know anyway it's amazing but they could not take the frogs away only Moses could take the frogs of way and then eventually win win the if you jump over to verse 16 if you still got your Bibles handy you know there's the young Moses says unto Aaron stretch for thyroid and smite the dust of the land and then it may be that it may become life throughout all the land of Egypt and then it you know then it happened and then if you read down verse 18 and the magician's did so with their enchantments to bring forth lice but they could not so there was Lysa pond men and upon beasts so it came to a stage where they could not do the things Moses and Aaron did brother ham said the devil could not impersonate the third Pole he can not impersonate the third Pole what is it so cool that's the opening of the word it's when and that's not intellectually it's when the wood comes open to you and changes you like brother BAM saw the great big vision of the great big tent and then that big tent on a platform was a little wooden room and people were all crippled and things went into the room and there was a reporter the essay you know wanted to see what happened and then wins there are more crippled they walked out fine and so the person asks what happened to you in this I don't know saying haven't we see the reason it was a secret is because so the devil could not in person that he can't impersonate the full word of God and then the Lord says I'll meet you in there the pillar fire goes in there so you take saying I'll meet you in there so it's a mystery Union in a tent between the bride and Christ and when that union takes place where once crippled with sin but now we walk out fine and yet because people can really ask you you know you tell them the testimony I mean you tell them your testimony and you try and describe what happened but you can't really describe what happened what happened to you in there I don't know but now look at me I'm not the same person when I walked in so I'm not the same person I was when I heard the word I'm now different and the devil kind of person ate the full Word of God on display so that's why the magician said oh we can't do this come to a certain point we can't do this a man didn't omit didn't the magician sit under fear this is the finger of God and Pharaoh's heart was hardened and he hearkened not unto them as the Lord had said why saw so them him operating those gifts it was to harden Pharaoh's heart to confuse the people to stop them applying the blood and going in an exodus see that's why sure other people have healings that's all fine remember it's already been purchased they have visions they have dreams sure but it's the word that's received what is the word to do it's to take us from this world to the next world as Enoch walked with God and was not because God took him right this is what this message is actually God walking with you I meant just like I've said about Luke 24 brother Barron preaches the sermon modern events and make clear by prophecy and Luke chapter 24 the two on the way to Emmaus what is now what happens normally and I don't know if I really achieve this but the opening scripture I read the rest of the scripture the rest of the sermon expounds upon what I've read so in brother and preaches mondo Vincent made clear by prophesying goes to Luke 24 he's now saying that them these modern events and made clear by Luke chapter 24 which is a prophecy so what does the prophecy entail the resurrection the two on the way to Emmaus are brokenhearted because their Messiah that they loved had just been crucified putting the Roman two and they think he's dead he's never coming back and they're going back to Emmaus downhearted because their world has fallen apart but then there's a man who comes walks with them and they don't realize who it is and he says Oh Falls and slow of heart and he starts at Moses and he goes all the way down through the scripture concerning the prompt the words that Jesus who who he is has fulfilled in their day and he walks with him for six hours showing them in the scripture who he was and then finally they go into the house and secret he breaks the bread he does something he did before he died to show that he is the same and it's the same thing so but the reason that he did that as he walked with them that they would recognize they are part of the resurrection also because they had to be in the upper room remember we once dead but now being quickened we've been been made alive by the Holy Ghost right so they it wasn't just Jesus caming out of that roman tomb right it was also the bride coming out as well and they were part of that bright so that's why he walked with them showed himself in the scripture that they would understand and know that they would not miss what was going on in their day not that they would just know about it but they done durst and they are part of the fulfillment of the prophecy well I'll pour my spirit out upon all flesh which was happened in the upper room so now the Son of Man comes in another form just like the turn the way to Emmaus he came in and you're in another form they didn't know who he was it says their eyes were holding from them that they would who he was he came in another form and Jesus has come out of history in another form and a prophet Vail right and opened his word to us and he's been walking with you all the way until your eyes come open and see Lord it's you amen remember he did something now I'm just going to close with these points but he did something in this state that he did before he was crucified well is that discerning the thoughts and tends of the hearts of the people brother and said this is the sign of the resurrection the sign of the Messiah right and he says then you become the sign of the resurrection because he was dead now you've been quickened alive to the Word of God right sir so he walks with you that's why you know it's you know it's so astounding we've seen this would be crucified we've seen it be rejected we've seen our world almost just fall apart and we under what's going on and it had to happen that way around the world because of the prophecy happy euro so if it happened in the prophecy it's got to happen in the fulfillment but he walks with you he's walked with you that you had known understand your part of the rapture that's why after he did the side of the you know broke the bread and he disappeared they realized who he was she didn't our hearts burn within us as he spoke along the way so that word that he has spoken gripped them like other words didn't and it's like this message I pray it it's gripped you more than any other words around it's gripped you our hearts burn within us we didn't fully understand who it is but in our eyes come open Lord it's you hallelujah and he's walked with you because you're part of the rapture amen they he walked with them till they understood they were part of the resurrection he the same son of man and a different form has walked with us and word for me has walked with us that we would understand we are part of the bride we're part of the rapture amen how we doing but the thing is now I'm gonna finish I don't want to go too long but we have to examine and see if the blood has been applied because remember Jennison generous were there those spirits were there upon me and to stop the people applying the blood and leaving in an exodus and it's the same thing that they religious spirits are here to try and stop us applying the blood and going in a rapture amen that's why that's why the devil just says no not just just go along to church you boys know and I'm sure you have you know you've always been a believer and sure and gods mom avoids being a believer but it's got to come a time when you meet him right there's got to come a time when it's more than just a mental understanding but God actually you know I was I was just you know I'm just simple enough if he's alive forevermore I can meet him that's just me maybe I'm just too elementary but I'm pretty happy that way so don't try and confuse me with some complicated stuff you know so if he's alive you can meet him and he is alive she can meet him right so there has to come a time just like the Apostle Paul the pillar of fire came on the road to Damascus he was doing his own thing in life but then God came his way and the God that he read read about if history became a reality and then he began to realize who he was in the scripture I mean but that was not just something he learned it was an experience and it's got to be the same thing with us I mean because that's why you know people are so confused Who am I what bathroom do I use you know am i whatever walk in yo because the world today you can be anything you want but who does God say we are you know and if you know who God says you are that gives you stability in life you know it's like my girls it used to be you know that every game they'd play I'm the you're the daddy beer mummy's the mummy beer with the baby beers oh I'm the mummy eagle this is the Betty eagle we're the baby Eagles it was always like how do we fit in this game and I don't have to tell them now now this is how you've got to play games know that just playing games because they needed to see how do we fit in this unit right it's human nature to want to fit somewhere that's why people are looking for identity right but the thing is it's when God God is here to give your identity he's the daddy Eagle you're the baby Eagles hallelujah and you fly up on the heavenlies hallelujah remember that your brother Ram says just examined to see if the blood is there didn't let off the pressure but the thing is the blood has to be applied not just to your body you know people get anointed in their flesh but their souls unconverted people allow the Holy Spirit you know cuz remember it's the door and the lintel three sides body spirit soul people go to meetings they get anointed they have a wonderful time but then they crash back down whether it's just on their spirit but the blood has to be a play and people get inspired there become ministers they've become song leaders deacons whatever more they get inspired anted but then they go back out into the world why because the blood was never applied to their soul the life of God was never in the soul that's why you've got to say Lord don't just anoint me one time change my nature change my desire change everything I am remember it's your choice that leads to them that that door that goes between the spirit and the soul ground brother Graham says that's free moral agency member faith and doubt operates it but it's exact he says in one place free moral agency it's your free moral choice we you know will you give up and let them come in or will you just keep them back for a bit and I'll pick that up another time but that's that's where we're going hopefully in a couple of weeks time but the blood has to be applied to every part and never ever let some spirit try and stop you applying the blood to go on a rapture because the devil is trying to hold on this world is trying to become a cage to keep people and you know brother Graham says those spirits that were that were released against the Jews in the Holocaust Feast of the trumpets he says those same spirits in ecclesiastical way a religious way I turned against the bride what did it physically do put people in death camps just exterminated them very efficiently horrible those same spirits now turned against you in a different way we have to recognize it they men I'm not cool to live in a spiritual death camp I'm a free son of God where are free people I'm in the devil has no right to put us in any kind of prison and exterminate us as he will I know as the Jews were you know as the Jews came out of World War two and they came to Israel and they're determined we're never ever ever going to let this happen again and they and some of them are still very determined we're never ever ever going to let this happen again and they pass it down to their children as their national identity but now it's come 70 odd years where people are starting to forget and the devil's trying to tell people the Holocaust never happened right but there's a people in that land saying we're never ever ever gonna let it happen to to us again and it should be the same thing with us we've come out of Darkness week I came out of a death camp hallelujah but but but those prison robes have been taken off well-being rope with the robe of his righteousness I've come out of the death camp and I'm determined I'm never ever ever going back I've never ever ever going back I mean I'm free God has called my Liberty I've walked out hallelujah and so we've got to instill not just an appearance for the young people there's a devil trying to destroy us but we're never never never going to be slaves in any form where are free people we've got our own nation we're going to run flag without currency what's our flag joy is the banner flying high from the castle of my heart what's the currency faith Polya what's our Constitution the Word of God I mean we have our own anthem Holloway only believe all things are possible hallelujah we ever earn army I mean just as the armies of heaven are around Elijah the armies are heaven around the Bride of Christ hallelujah we have mighty weapons of our warfare they're not kind all their mighty through God to the pulling down of strongholds how're you gonna say little ol be yes you're born in the station if God's me you've been birthed hallelujah so we got to have a determination we're never never never gonna let it happen we're never never never going back yeah amen that's why God told Moses tell you children and your grandchildren where you came from tell them all the things that that that they that you suffered in Egypt tell them about the scarring and the beating and being used as just at all them being being killed a faith you know you know if the Egyptians want to kill them they could just kill them that just are just a commodity in their hands tell them you had no identity there but I gave you identity tell them they're the slave masters beat you and whooped you and they threw the firstborn into the river and did atrocious things tell them what happened but tell them that you're delivered from that place maybe tell them what the devil did tell them what the devil did amen out in the world to you but tell them that when God delivered you from that devil tell them what happened how will you tell them the beatings that ye receive and now you're free I've been telling the yeah hallelujah whatever happened you tell them at their age appropriate level sure but you've got to tell them because otherwise they're look at you say mommy and daddy why are you this way and they don't understand because they can't put this world and you together why do they have this passion why they so excited what us are happy well that's are thankful what you say you tell them I'm thankful because I was bound but now i'm free i was dead but now i'm alive i was dead and send trespasses amen i was i was oh devils whipping boy but now he's under my feet hallelujah and that's more than his nice words that really happened hallelujah so you got a remind you say well i was racing this message but it's got to come a time if he's become real to you you can tell that one day is just floating along with yo your along with the crowd but then god became real to me he quickened this word to me now i'm alive in him hallelujah and I'm never never going back just being a church member anymore that's still a testimony that s-- a glorious testimony hallelujah what cuz

but the liberty bell rang the jubilee trumpet sounded something in me said I can walk out of these prison gates how the devil couldn't tormenting him me no more he's got to be under my feet he's gone never ever let it become common to you that the Lord has called you out and if he's called you out he's cool he's gonna take you in amen I have no idea what I want to sing but let's just stand
