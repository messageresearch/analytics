this one Father's Day today so just say a couple of words about your heavenly father and if he's done something for your past really well something that's all signic to you I'll get the ball rolling someone needs to um I just wanted to say how I love my heavenly father um I was thinking this morning I for a speaker's birthday um party this afternoon I was thinking oh like I've been praying that it'll be nice with and then I um I woke up and I thought oh I'll go and like open the curtains and see like what the weather's like and straight away that verse just came that God said to Abraham um regard those things that are as if they're not just came straight into my mind and I thought don't even need to open the curtains like I thought I'll open them it might be perfectly blue and I might open it it might be thunderclouds but it doesn't matter what it looks like because like and I was so I was I like had tears in my eyes I was like thank you Lord I don't even need to look and then I was having my quiet time and then I heard rain just hammering down on the roof and I just like smiled I thought thank you Lord like he knew like it already even prepared me and then and then that and then um gave the children their breakfast and then um open the curtains after that and then blue skies and I was like thank you Lord like just thank you anyway it doesn't matter thank you and um just awesome when it becomes real and it's not just like I should think like this for but it's that anyway I love my heavenly father that's all well I am the uh youngest in the Sunday school I'm seven so I thought I'll just come and say thank you to the Lord as well um so we did a lesson just on my sheep hear my voice and why sheep hears his voice and why they follow him alone but then I just want to be thankful for when we were sitting there actually opened up something to me that that that Shepherd uses a dog to chase you back into the pen cuz it looks like a fierce wolf but it's actually just a dog it's nothing else than a dog and the shepherd can call that dog back anytime and whatever the shepherd wants to do he'll tell that dog what to do and that dog will plank left of flank right but it will get all the Sheep into one nice bundle into the gates which he only can open and which he is the gate and then he can lead you all very safely into that t and you can just stay there overnight very safe so what happened is that dog used to be a wolf but now that dog is only a dog that got me into my position where I should be and the one thing that happened this morning when we I watched this this YouTube video It Happened that that dog cannot go where we go he cannot bite us he cannot hurt us he cannot do anything unless that Shepherd which is our heavenly father tells him to do it and that's why the Book of Job kind of tied into it as well and it's it's just wonderful to see that when God reveals something to you and just shows you that he's in control he's even in control of the dog he's in control of everything so though we see it as this big Fierce wolf it's still just a dog with no bite just a bar so yeah thank you Lord I just want to praise him thank you Dad for spe you amen praise God am I just want to read a scripture of Romans 8:14 it says for as many as are led by the SP spirit of God they are the sons of God and then in verse 18 it says for I reckon that the suffering of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory we be revealed in us so yes what a wonderful scripture we are laid by the spirit of God so we the sons of God Amen I'm just I'm just so blessed this morning um you know it's just so wonderful to to be called The Son of God Amen um we've had a wonderful week just been so blessed in the pray meeting or colge meeting on on Wednesday evening and um yeah I'm just I'm just studying uh I'm reading Applause in a moment so I don't know how many times I've gone through it and um you know God is just showing us new things showing us his his plan showing us his remarkable blessings and um it's amazing that a father always want to do good for his uh children as the sister just testified as well so um and you know I think it's as uh any good father brother also any good father would like to leave an inheritance for his children he would like to leave something behind um and that that is a character of a good father he says and um he says that's that that's the character of that father being able to be a provider being able to leave something behind for that child and and and that gives that child of peace and I was just thinking you know that um uh you know in this whole uning of God uh that was God's plan was to leave something behind because before the natural father came about um there was God you know and God had that plan in he locked up in and and everything that a natural father wants to do is actually a continual expression of what God wanted to do and I was just thinking so what so what is it that God actually wanted to leave behind for me I it couldn't have been this Earth because uh we see just falling to pieces you know it couldn't have be in a house or a car or or anything like this RS away the case I couldn't have been even this body doesn't come from God it was just limited so what did he actually leave behind he actually left behind his very own personal presence and and and that was his inheritance is is to leave leave himself inside of us and and and and I'm just so blessed I am just so blessed brother Brenham says it's it's in unveiling of God it's always always been God's desire it's always been God's desire to be masked to be veiled behind the flesh so so so I'm just so blessed this morning that that that I'm actually the veil of God I'm actually walking on this Earth and and and and that's why brother renam says the unveiling of God is a very great sermon that he preached you know it's it's it was that hidden plan of God all along why he he he said let it be light and that very first spoken word what when he start that creation it was actually the ultimate was so that he could find his abod and his and his hiding place in in man so so I think it's the it's the it's the greatest fathers that we could have is to is to be able to host God to be a host of God we we will never plan to be on the earth to to have a job or anything like that because I Adam and to wear clothing Adam didn't have clothing we were never plan to have a cell phone Adam didn't need a cell phone we were never plann to have a computer that came after the fall God just placed Adam there so if God placed Adam there without a cell phone or anything that means God never intended these things just came after the four and we we have to live with him so God's plan was Adam go about and just continue my work on the earth have dominion over everything so so this morning I believe we are we are set free as the brother sang the song also this morning we are Redeemed by the blood of the Lamb we are we are God's precious chosen vessels to be able to hide in um yeah I'm just so blessed this morning we are the host of God we are the Most Blessed people on the face of the Earth to to realize we've come to that recognition that we are actually the temple of God we are hiding in we are abiding in his presence and he's abiding in us so I believe we will have a wonderful Father's Day um my daughter was so excited Dy Dy it's it's it's Rebecca uh birthday so we want to bless her as well and every little one as well and I trust we'll have a blessed day in the isn't wonderful opportunity God bless you s um I just like to give thanks to the Lord this morning um as we reflect on Father's Day um I come from a broken home my dad left us while I we were quite young I was about two years or two and a half years old um but he's still he's still alive today and uh he doesn't want to have anything to do with me but one thing I can say is that when I found the Lord um I can talk to the Lord and he can talk to me um whether it's in your quiet time or whether it's in your busy time if you got something to say or something to ask he's always listening like this morning I read in uh Psalms I think 116 he's always listening to us sometime we think he's not there but he is um you know having a father is a great thing and and after I found the Lord um my life straightened out and I can be a father to my children and and and all our dads here and all our parents here uh you know we're just thankful that our families are together and and we're strong together so it's it's it's a it's a joyful thing to have our children with us and as our father provides for us we can provide for our children so yes we love you Lord and yeah amen um so a couple of things um the one thing that just struck me about Father's Day is I look at my two boys and I as a father if you're a father you just look at your children you go no matter what you do no matter how angry you make me you can't change being in my and I can change my life for you um and I take that back to to my relationship with God and I you know I'm still in this fleshly body I haven't been transformed yet so this thing still makes mistakes but it can't change his love for me and can't change the fact that I am his and he'll always be waiting at the gate when I come back and he'll have a feast prepared for me and um oh that that that just excites me and another thing that I just want to uh talk about is um yesterday we were over at my brother's place and they've got a they got a structure where there's a swing on so it's a it's like the beams of wooden beams and goes across it's just like a structure of PL beams and the kids were playing climbing up there and you know the young kids were could to get up there and we helped them up and Keegan was at the top there and he was a bit scared he you know he's never been a fearful boy but this just fin of got him and he didn't like this idea he didn't feel in control or anything like that and the fear just became him and just that he got over him and I went there and I told him look I've got you you've got to show you know you've got to you've got to trust that I've got you I'll catch you you need to jump you need to jump off I'm not going to pick you off you got to face this and you got to jump and after a long while lots of Tears he did actually go I showed him right see he good door but then I put him back up it's right there and he didn't like this idea at all because he got off you now I'm putting him back in the in the problem and um and he jumped off the second time a little bit easier and I actually cled up as well and I told him right do this do this do this and then you can feel that you're in control and is a little bit more and you've got to trust well got and second time was a little bit easier and then I did it a third time right now and without a hedge R back up not a tear in sight and jump back down without any problem sometimes things happen in our lives that are you look at the situation and you go I can't I can't handle this and then and then you trust God and he helped you through and you think okay thank goodness that's over and the very next day it happens again and you think um this isn't this isn't how it's supposed to go but then God's trained you and he showed you look hang on you've got to face this fear you've got to trust you've got to believe and then as you go along you just get to that and the greatest of all was is when we told when we were at home we were sitting around the dinner table Keegan said that the thing that he that he said was the fact that he climbed up he was very scared but he learned to trust dad's got him and that dad's got going to be ready for him and that's our that's my testimony is that a lot of things have happened over the last couple of years or so and it's hard but you trust and you jump and you and you know that God's got this and you just keep going and you build right a little bit just Tes um just thanks to our so wonderful he has one of the mie you can see how great things have been eared to make this a reality which two three years ago was been like what is this going to happen to make this happen and now you can see the substance to it but then now from there so then I about six months or about six months ago I got asked by the editor of the BNL um to join the team and then the next conversation on the phone was and I want me to you you're going to be the editor of this thing I'm this is like an international newsletter around the world within the frame of this is Believers and interesting um and then you know speaking with guys that been and you know just in talking you find out really that God's got a a great a plan and he's now making a vehicle for the networking of this great family and so you know just as Ian was saying God's got this whatever plans he has for us what no matter how big how hard it seems whatever the tri he's got this it's is simple amen we can trust in amen and jump amen and that's scary sometimes to jump we've just got to jump amen hallelujah any else even if it's just the of praise

that the city is not too far away amen so we're looking for that City amen God bless you amen hallelujah just uh just a couple of announcements um so uh I got the key to have look upstairs so we go look upstairs the price isn't right but the Lord wants us we'll have it so we'll just have a look um we need to have an AGM so if we have that after church next week we have an AGM and uh if you have anything you'd like to discuss just send it to me in some form and then um you know we've got Sunday school various other things to talk about but if you got specific things you want to talk about uh send it to me we have an agenda um I think I think that's everything yes those the two um um yes those the two things um if you got your Bibles let's just go to Genesis 24 and Happy Father's Day you know it's wonderful when you uh you don't really need to I feel I don't need to say anything about it because well the fathers stood up and they expressed their views on Father's Day I thought praise the lord it's right down the you know it's true that you know a man can can can become God to his family and express the fullness of God to his family and that's what the father was called to do that when you know the children when they look at look at father they should see they should see God and when when wife looks at looks at husband she should see God Amen and then and then when and when others look upon that man they should see God as well because his brother Donnie was saying that we are God we are the Tabernacle of the Living God God is veiled in flesh he's always veiled in flesh he's veiled in us I trust you can say he dwells in me and if he dwells in you you are the Mighty God has unveiled I mean because he's veiled in you and he's expressed out of your life Hallelujah so amen every attribute you know of God should be expressed in you amen okay let's just go to Genesis 24 amen and so you know the world may not think too much of you but God's been waiting for people to himself through in his fullness where our people can give God preeminence and in in everything not just to save you but just have your own way Lord whatever you want you know he's been waiting for people to have a full he can express himself fully through and here you are and you go about your daily life and you're expressing God upon this Earth hallelujah amen we're just going to read the last bit of Genesis 24 I just want to go over a few things so Genesis 24 and read from verse 56 down we know this is the story of of Rebecca being uh returning now with with Alazar to to her Isaac and he said unto them say alaza speaking to to uh her family hinder me not seeing the Lord has prospered my way send me away that I may go to my master and they said we will call the damsel and inquired her mouth and they called Rebecca and said unto her will thou go with this man she said I will go and they what a what a powerful three words I will go and they sent away Rebecca their sister and her nurse and Abraham's servant and his men and they blessed Rebecca and said unto her Thou Art our sister be thou the mother of thousands of millions and let thy seed possess the Gate of those which hate them and Rebecca arose in her damsels and they Rod upon camels and followed the man and the servant took Rebecca and went his way and Isaac came from the way of The Well of laari which of course means The Well of him that liveth and seeth me for he DW dth in the South Country and Isaac went out to meditate in the field at the evening tide and lifted up his eyes and saw and behold the camels were coming and Rebecca lifted up her eyes and when he she saw Isaac she lighted off the camel for she had said unto the servant what man is this that walketh in the field to meet us and the servant had said it is my master therefore she took a veil and covered herself and the servant told Isaac all the things he had done and Isaac brought her into her mother's Sarah's tent and took Rebecca and she became his wife and he loved her and Isaac was comforted after his mother's death amen and let's just read uh let's go to um St John uh just chapter one we're just going to read one one uh verse uh St John 1 I mean St John chapter 1 and verse 43 just as a bit of a context here and and the day following Jesus would go forth into Galilee and findeth Phillip and saith unto him follow me amen let's just bow a word of prayer father we want to thank you oh Our Father which are in heaven Hallowed be thy name Lord thy kingdom come thy will be done on Earth as it is in heaven oh Father may you give

are under expectation to be lifted up oh God that Beyond this realm Lord Beyond these five senses oh God and Father The Eternity is blending in with time and father we're looking for that day Lord it could be just now where we step from this realm to the next realm and father we want to thank you for that oh God we want to water these camels Lord water are this power that's going to take us into

Jesus Christ's name have your way we pray amen amen amen you may have your seats amen God bless you amen it's good to have Pam with us as well God bless you welcome amen now I want to continue from from from last week and you know we're going through a bit of a thought where we are at the end time and and we we've read here now where where Isaac was was he he he came into the field there and he began to meditate and he was he was waiting for this for this time because he had seen Abraham send alaz he had seen Abraham load the camels with all of his goods and he had seen the those camels no doubt Go off into the distance and go over the horizon and he had he had begin to wait now because he knew that because when Abraham said that the angel of the Lord will go before you and he shall he shall he shall find he shall find a wife amen it's not you alasa that's really going to do it but God this unseen one that's already going before you he shall prepare the damel he shall speak to her heart when when you come to the place amen she will be ready she doesn't know that that that God has come her way already and begin to deal with her but she you know she will begin to discover that she's part of this great plan amen you know she's just living her life and she's there getting water and these things but but God has a different plan for her life and and now now that now what God saw her to become was going to become you know was going to become reality and and we see here that no doubt Abraham would you know you know you know he he sent alasar and these things and Isaac would have been under expectation because now had come the season where he was because he was the promised son and his seed would continue on through that lineage was going to come the serpent Bruiser himself Christ Jesus and and we understand that you know he had to he had to be married because he had to have children and now the season had come we finally finally the you know it wasn't just maybe a one day kind of thing because we understand that I he wasn't a young man when when he got married he was an older man and so he could have got married many you know he he had many years of opportunity he could have got married but Abraham knew that he had to he had to marry a blood relation he had to marry someone that was related to him and it's the same thing with our Lord that when he finds you he finds you because you're part of his family you're part of him and we understand that a wife is a part of part of the husband the two are actually one amen even though they're in two separate bodies but Paul says great is the mystery speaking of Christ and the church husband and wife that they become one flesh and so Abraham there was only one wife for Isaac I mean he could have married any girl he wanted because his father was a mighty man of wealth and he had the herds and he had all the cattle and all these things he was a rich man so no doubt there would have been many young women saying I'm going to marry Isaac one day but there was something in Isaac because he would have seen other woman he wasn't some in a cloer none on some Hill some place he would have seen other woman he would have seen the woman of the land and no doubt some of those women said I'm going to marry I'm going to marry this one cuz you know how you know people try and marry riches and all these things but there was something in Isaac that said they're not part of me Hallelujah there's something that that there's something in me that just it just doesn't resonate am mean when when when I see them approach me something in me just doesn't say say that she's the oneu but then finally the day had come where the camel train was coming back and you know it's about 500 mil to go from where Abraham was to where Rebecca was living it's a long journey and 500 mil is a long way and especially if you're on camels and it takes I know some people said maybe at least a month to get there so it would have been a good two Monon journey and so he would have but he was under expectation because he knew he knew that alaza had to come not empty-handed but he had to come with a woman amen that was part of him amen hallelujah so now he begin to see in the evening time the you know he would look over that Horizon and this day was this evening was a different kind of evening because because he began to see those camels come over the horizon from from a few months ago he saw them leave and now they are coming back and we see this as a beautiful picture of our day and hour that we're alive and because we're under expectation for the catching away but God has been waiting for this hour Hallelujah where a woman amen has has has said those three words I will go and she's come under the sound of a supernatural voice and she said I will go I don't know how you did it you may have wept at an altar you may be driving in your car and God come down or so I don't know how how he came to you but he came to you there amen I trust if he hasn't come to you let him come amen God is present among us even even now he's pre I believe he's present amen let him come to you Hallelujah and then so finally you know we have all had the experience of of of coming under the sound of a voice and that voice spoke to you it spoke to me more than any other voice amen I've heard I've heard different languages I've heard different accents I've heard different voices but when I heard that voice I mean when I heard the voice of that Prophet amen it may have been recorded 50 years ago but something something in me I mean it resonated like nothing else ever did I said had in church many churches before I've been in many different denominations before i' read many different books and these things but when I heard that voice amen something in me said this is more than a man amen and Jesus was lifted out of history and he became a present day God Amen to me Hallelujah he became a real God he became not more than a story book and more than just a testimony of someone but he came he came to me there amen he he changed me I had to I had to be willing to lay everything down but he when I came under the sound of that voice I could not go back to my old life it doesn't matter how much I wasn't willing to let things go I just I was wasn't satisfied anymore there was something in me saying this is what I've been looking for amen you know so you know you come to a point in life you can be young or old it doesn't matter and you say there's got to be more to it than this there's got to be more to it than this am me how did I come to this spot and you know and then and God allows God allows you to be stirred up that way sir God God wants you to be uncomfortable yes sir am mean before him he doesn't want you to be comfortable in this world before God deals with you he wants you to be uncomfortable amen amen because if you're satisfied you won't say I will go you won't say yes I'll leave everything I know and go to this different place you'll just say well I have it all everything's everything's peaching but he wants you to be stirred up amen amen if you're being stirred up you know if you're being if if your life was up upside down you should say praise the Lord amen because God allowed it to be thus and it'll be so amen you know brother Braham he he would say about trials and these things and he and he said you know a voice said to him are you are you wanting to bypass this because Tri the the trial of your faith amen is more precious than gold amen so well you I'm going through the ringer hallelujah amen the world is falling apart hallelujah amen because the TR and yeah the voice it to you want to bypass this and he said no amen there we go down through it why because it's in the it's not on the mountain top when when character is being built I mean we're being built you go listen to the Statue of a perfect man and brother Braham he didn't call it the statue of a perfect man he called it the the living Tabernacle of the living God's dwelling place that's what he called the sermon amen and we see that God is God is very intent now because this is what he wants built amen amen God is the contractor Hallelujah I mean he doesn't change his plans he has a blueprint and he's determined it's going to be on time it's going to be on schedule it doesn't matter what hazards or unseen things seem to come what people think or this doesn't fit here this is wrong and all this God God God's not interested in all that kind of stuff God says I'm going to build a people into my image and it's going to be that way and nothing can stop nothing can stop them being built in my image Hallelujah and so he's now he's he's taking you you know when Rebecca said I'll go she didn't really have a great idea of what was going to happen she knew she was going to get married yeah but she didn't really fully maybe grasp he you read the story Genesis 24 she hear the testimony of here comes a servant of Abraham Abraham's related to her family Abraham has a son and you know and all you know I'm looking for a wife for Isaac and you know this is all she hears but she doesn't understand that she is living out something an incredible journey is about to take place in her life because you know no doubt when you know a true servant of God he's not interested in in gathering the people to himself he's not interested in in the people catching his Spirit or his personality a true servant of God is only interested in one thing that God and man would be United in a true spiritual relationship and he's not important amen because a you can't have a third person in a marriage you can't have a third will amen it's just got to be Christ and his church amen and then everything that God uses to to create that Union it's just it's just material but it's not the most important thing amen the important thing is that God and man would become one Hallelujah that alasa all he was interested in he wasn't interested in taking some Scenic tour I've never been to this part of the country let's go along the coast let's have a look he said don't hinder my journey see that God has prospered my way I must go now he was he was very determined I've got what I need I'm leaving amen amen and then so it's the same thing now we're not interested in building some you know building some church around some personality of man or some different way of thinking it's that God and man would be United amen that the head would be United with the body amen that God would dwell in a people he would take a people and he would Express himself individually through those people amen this is what we're called to in this hour that it's no longer I that liveth but Christ that liveth in me amen when man sees you they should be able to see God they may not be able to put a picture you know maybe put a finger on why you're different but I trust they can say you're different it's more than how you dress or more than you know maybe how you do your hair or I go to church on Sunday but there's a life in there and that life is expressing itself even in spite of what you want that comes and lives in you and you become a love prisoner as Paul said a prisoner of Jesus Christ he became a Lov prisoner Amen to that one he met on the road to Damascus and then he was determined now that those bonds of love he would actually impart those to others that they would fall in love with the same one amen the same one that gave the law and all he knew was a was a god came to Mount Si one day and gave a law but then he he fell in love with that same lawgiver and he found out that he was more than a lawgiver but he became a sacrifice he became a lamb for him he became his high priest he became his intercessor and he fell in love with this Jesus I trust I pray this morning that if you haven't fallen in love with Jesus Christ you would fall in love with him amen because if you fall in love with him everything else just just evaporates amen all the church isms and politics and this and that and stuff that doesn't matter just fall in love with him amen when I heard that when I heard brother brandom it was never L to me I I heard Grace I heard the grace of God God being preached amen and and from that day on it's been Grace I'm just Grace top bottom inside and out amen that God can enable a person to live his word and it's not the man or the woman living the word it's God God says I'll be the Christian in you I'll cause you to walk this way because I will do it I mean I will be the Overcomer in you I will cause you to be a consecrated lover of me not because you hey our Humanity we're a bunch of jellyfish Hallelujah you can't give a jellyfish a backbone amen and if you try you just kill the jellyfish you can't inject you can't just say you must live this this is how you must live and this is all this stuff if love is not the underpinning thing it's going to something's going to go wrong but if it's not you know if if if there's love there doesn't matter what you have to do doesn't matter how ridiculous it seems doesn't matter how contrary to your nature you think it is if it's love you say yes Lord amen yes I'll do it for you because I love you amen hallelujah amen amen I'm so glad redeeming love has been my theme and shall be till I die amen that there's a real love upon this Earth that that that that survives the storms it you know goes through the good times it goes through the bad times am mean there's an anchor amen I'll say it this is not P the sky I mean this is a living reality it's more than just words that you know if you just preach people and say this and this and this hey this must live first and then you preach a sermon if redeeming love is not being lived out of you amen amen well how do you do it honey how you doing today he hey kitties how you doing is everything all right and they you know they may be all upsetting up and down you just pick them up it's all right sing a song do something you know amen what is that that's redeeming love being expressed amen when your children your children should always be able to see no matter what what they do they can always come back to you yes sir no matter what they do even if they burn the house down they burn the city down whatever they do they can always they know that you love them that's redeeming love amen amen because if they can come to you and God can use you because God works through man oh I want to see the heavens open and all these things God works through man he may he may work that way but he he works through he wants to use you I want to see God live in my home he wants to use you I want to see the atmosphere Chang in my life he's got to use you amen you're the atmosphere generator in your home you're the atmosphere Creator you're a Creator amen through the power of the tongue you can create hell or you can create Heaven depends which one you want in your life amen and but for me in my house I want heaven doesn't matter what we're going through if we don't doesn't matter if you know we're on the street in some tent someplace I want heaven in there hallelujah amen cuz money can't buy that money can't buy real peace money can't buy Joy amen you can move somewhere else you'll go with yourself you'll take your problems with you but if you just take them to him amen he's the one who deals with everything Hallelujah I need to sort this out let him sort it out let him use you to sort it out amen shamgar realized one day he had to Def he had to stand up to these Philistines he wasn't waiting for his neighbor he wasn't waiting for someone else he took what he had amen and it looked in the natural he could never defeat those Philistines but he stood on a promise and anchored into his heart I I am an Israelite this is my ground amen this is my god-given ground Hallelujah it belongs to me therefore every enemy must bow every enemy Must Die amen and every after that day was done they were all dead amen hallelujah and it didn't just cause a Revival in his home it caused a Revival in the nation amen hallelujah amen you just begin to testify you begin to create an atmosphere amen you begin to hey oh you say the devil's taking my family captive go after them with love amen and Watch God's redeeming love be used through you am me to get a hold of them oh it's impossible nothing is impossible with God Amen nothing is impossible you say well I don't I don't see how that could be so you read Genesis how did Israel cross the Red Sea that's impossible how' they take Jericho it's impossible how did they invade a land where the people were bigger and stronger than they were and they took it amen how did Joshua stand there and say sun stand still Moon stand still he is under the blood of bulls and goats and the Very nature ofey a man and it wasn't even written in the scripture but inspiration struck him amen we need more time to defeat our enemy Hallelujah and what about you now under the blood of Jesus Christ am mean where God is not just with you but he's in you amen he is directing your footsteps Hallelujah you ask not because you receive not amen sure you ask not yeah I mean you receive not because you ask a US it says in James but you ask not because you receive not amen Esther comes to the king she's afraid to step into his presence she's afraid he loves her he wants her to come into His presence she's afraid she's afraid that she's going to get killed think of it imagine that if you're you know you love your wife with all your life and she's afraid to come into your presence this is how she was but she just needed to reach up here and feel a crown she just needed to look down and look at that Royal apparel and God put her in that position Grace put her it wasn't her that that worked out how to become Queen she just became Queen Hallelujah you just became the Queen of Heaven you weren't looking for it one day God came your way say I'm afraid to really step out in faith feel the crown amen what do you wrapped in the righteousness of saints it was granted to you unto her it was granted that she' be ar raid in the righteousness of saints Revelations 19 she didn't she didn't you didn't go looking for it it's just granted it's just Grace here here's the here's the wedding band it's already on your finger Hallelujah here's the Robes of of my righteousness not your righteousness my righteousness it's just given hallelujah amen amen and and so she just had the feel the crown recognize I'm part of him he can't kill me because I'm part of he loves me that's a love affair between me and him Hallelujah same thing with us oh it might not work try him once amen step out in faith I'd rather brother bam says he'd rather be on the on the field making mistakes doing something for God than doing nothing he says what are you doing about it amen amen oh I don't know you just he step out in faith take God at his word Joshua didn't have it in the Bible he just said I need more time inspiration struck him Hallelujah hey you have a need what did the king say to Esther what is your request I'll give you even up to half of the Kingdom now that wasn't saying we'll split the kingdom evenly he's saying what's mine is yours and what's yours is mine everything I have at my disposal is in your hand Hallelujah all of Heaven is behind the Queen of Heaven I mean the Bride of Jesus Christ we may not have the power but we have the authority amen like a policeman or a diplomat goes to a country that entire country is backing that man or woman amen that goes in the name of that country how about you friends amen we are not from an Earthly Kingdom we're from a Heavenly Kingdom and all of Heaven is behind you yes sir God is determined not you God is determined amen that you'll be made in His image amen that you'll be in his very likeness yes sir and so we see Rebecca now she was on a journey and she was always part of Isaac but now no doubt you know God you know no doubt she would have she would have uh she would have asked a lot of questions and to me I do not believe it just would have been a you know what does he like to eat and uh you know it would have been more than what does he when does he wake up in the morning and what's his favorite pastimes and things it would have been a real you're about she's about to meet him she's going to marry and so it would have been a real now every every everything about his life how does he you know what does he like to do and you know how what's his character like how does he you know when things come up and you know with the herdsman and stuff how does he deal with these she would have been looking for more than what he likes to do but his very nature and character she would have been pulling it out of out of out of alasa and so now alaza when he begin to begin to speak now he was not interested as I said he was not interested in trying to bind Rebecca to himself he was not interested in trying to get Rebecca to fall in love with him but every word that came out of his mouth bound her heart more with Isaac's every day amen when when when he would when they would sit there or however they did it and and they would have Fellowship maybe over the campfire at night he would begin to tell tell stories about Isaac and this would now this would draw Rebecca closer am mean closer to this man that she had never seen before hallelujah hallelujah and now we see that you know this is why you know brother BR speaks about this this glorified Jesus in 55 now we understand you are Rebecca and Isaac is our lord Jesus we understand these things and so he says this he says if you're trying he's speaking of the Bible here if you're trying to read it from some educational standpoint you just read it like you was trying to figure out mathematically something but if you read it after you have received Christ into your heart it's a brand new book again it's just a love story God's writing it to you it's spiritually uh it's spiritual reveal God's church is absolutely a spiritual revelation of the Lord Jesus Christ and no man can receive it by his own desire Jesus said no man can come to me except my father draws me first is that right it has to be a work of the holy spirit in the beginning to draw the person and when the person comes to God by the Holy Ghost Holy Spirit draw Jesus said I'll no wise cast them out give him everlasting life raise him up at the last day what a beautiful hope that gives to the church amen if you could just the greatest Miracle you will ever experience is to be drawn to him it's that that's an incredible thing to have something in you that says I want more of him I want to meet him that is the most Supernatural thing you will experience in your life and so we see that Rebecca that's why I said Rebecca what you would have asked would have been more than just a you an intellectual trying to understand Isaac but she was wanting to because she was wanting to very pull out of alasa the very heart of Isaac I mean really you know really who Isaac not as not as what the maybe the other servants knew about Isaac or maybe what the other people saw about Isaac but the real manen I mean the real man in his his entirety because we can read the scripture and we can see what other people say about Jesus and we can no doubt they'll talk about him walking on the shores of Galilee and that he and that he loves everybody and that he died on the cross and all those things are true but we want more than just that but we want to see the very man himself the very character of God I mean we want to hear about you know exactly what is our lord Jesus like hallelujah how does he handle these situations and how does he you know handle and and I'm going to bring that into today but you know we the whole the whole Christian journey and Rebecca's Journey when she got on the camels with alasa she began to it began to be a love affair between her and Isaac amen and I can say that because elaser I mean so that whole chapter there is a shadow of you and the Lord in this end time and so if I have you know we we are United with Christ here the marriage is here amen the marriage supper is up there but we don't so we meet him here but we don't see him in his glorified form here are you with me so we got to meet him in the a we got to meet him in that Dimension and we'll see him as he is in his glorified form but we've already been United here okay so in a way I know him but in a way I don't fully know him yet because I haven't seen him as he is yet amen sure he's been unveiled in his word and we see the entire unfolding you know the unveiling of God but I haven't seen him in his in his physical form yet you know in his in his Corporal body that's been glorified you understand what I'm saying so I've become one with them now but I'm looking for that final uniting when the dead in Christ rise and then we our bodies are changed and we're caught up to meet him there's that final uniting that we're looking forward to but the Bride of Jesus Christ has been United United with him now right I mean when he meets you you have been United with him Hallelujah You are not alone in this walk but he is with you amen so now we begin to when I met him it became a love affair between me and God am mean from the very first time I heard that message I it just caused me to come into a love affair with Jesus Christ and so that's why I can say that that Rebecca now it would be it began to be a love affair between her and Isaac and so as as they were journeying now she would begin to ask about Isaac and no doubt there was things in her life maybe she had to change but you know no doubt she you know maybe she have asked how how does Isaac like us to dress how does he like us to conduct ourselves and and you know she would have changed you know all those things but it was more than that to her amen it was more than just an outward Conformity but there was a there's something in her saying you she she fell in love with a man she'd never seen before amen and Peter tells us that he says and whom we have not seen yet we love now we' have seen him I when I look down into your faces I see Jesus Christ so in a way I see him but I haven't seen him you know in his in his glorified form you understand what I'm saying am mean so when you see you know brother bam says when you see God manifest you see you've seen him yeah so we see see him in his bride but we haven't seen him yet I'm just you you're following what I'm saying you understand so now Isaac so that's why we can go back and say she fell in love with Isaac without even seeing him and then you know I believe that you know Rebecca's you know as they journeyed now Rebecca's love and expectation to meet Isaac increased it just increased every every day Journey it would have just got greater and greater is our journey and you know we can read you know you know we read that her calling her journey was under the influence of the Angel of the Lord and that unseen one in the whole journey was the most important one because it was that unseen one that unseen one was actually the one uniting Isaac and Rebecca together amen it's the same thing with us that now remember the angel of the Lord I I know it's just characters but but God is only one you understand there's not the father and the son are not two different persons they are the same person but manifested in different ways so we see now that the angel of the Lord is is God in another form and he is here that unseen one is present now in order to unite us to the sun amen amen to unite us to himself you see so so that the angel of God that Abraham said he'll go before you he was the most important character he was the one who brought them all together in the very end it's the same thing with us now that un seen one that walks with us you know brother baram he he would he would stand there and he would say now Jesus is the high priest of our profession and and then God would would would come down and he would point to people in the audience and say you you were just praying for this and this and this and you were praying for this and this and this and and he would say who did she touch who did he touch they're 20 ft away from me they never touch me but they touched the high priest so he was asking who did they touch and and so he was posing that question to them for them to recog that their faith touched God and God used that vessel to reveal their needs to them but I want to I want to do the flip side of that question now when God came your way when your life I'm trusting you can go back into your life it doesn't matter if you're raising this message you came out of some some church or out of the world but there's a time where something happened to you amen something caused your heart to be turn towards godj and I can ask you the question what touched you who touched you amen amen who was touching you hallelujah hallelujah this great Eternal and I wish I could put it in words but this great Eternal one that would that would transcend dimensions and come into this realm amen amen and use a voice and when you heard that voice it wasn't like any other voice you say that spoke to me brother Ben like I have nothing else has spoke I could say what touched you what spoke to you it's more than a man from Kentucky God just used that vessel to unveil himself amen but God would take a take a lips of a prophet and unveil himself through that man and it would anchor in the heart of the bride and it would cause a love of fear am me to begin between them and Jesus Christ himself I can say what touched you amen hallelujah what touched you what's what's affecting me what's driving me to my ultimate goal amen it's not I trust is not human ambition for me it's not human ambition am mean it's not it's not my character or some any any Humane thing but it's a supernatural effect amen hallelujah hallelujah there's a there's an unseen one in this in this meeting there's an unseen one in our homes there's an unseen one when we go just walking down the street or into the mall there's an unseen one amen and he's the Lord Of Glory maybe you need to recognize who walks with you every day if we could you just think the greatest celebrity upon this Earth brother said when the king and queen went to camp and I think Ern backra one of his campaign managers that was Canadian you know they you you all the people they pick the flags up and they' begin to scream and cry and just because the king went past amen the king and the queen they just went past the king maybe they waved maybe they never seen them amen but they were they were under such a such a draw because here became here came their head of state Hallelujah if it was someone else in that Carriage they wouldn't be doing that no here's it what are they doing in that Carriage that's my king and queen you know there there wouldn't have been that draw because of the person that was in there amen the person in there caused that draw that excitement yes amen now you bring it into your home if you recognize who was with you every day if you could really recognize this great one who spoke these worlds into existence I me would come down and dwell with you not just with you but in you he make your abod he would make you would be his Abode amen he you know he he says in Isaiah at the end he says Heaven is my throne and Earth is my foot stol he says where is the place of my rest and he's actually throwing out the question where is my bride where is my people because God's rest is the dwelling is the soul of man amen so he's trying the question out where is the place of my rest I made the heavens and the earth I made the stars in the galaxies but where's my family where's my wife this is what he's asking where is the place of my rest and then you're born into the Earth and then whatever season of life he comes his hand comes upon you and you can say Here I Am Lord amen here's the place of your rest hallelujah amen amen he spoke the worlds and he walks with you Hallelujah if if if the world could recognize who walks with you all the other cele would just they wouldn't even be yeah you know if they really recognized here's the one who has the answer to death here's the one who has the answer to Poverty he's the one who has the answer to suffering and hardship and distress and pain and hurt and all these things and he walks with you amen you think about it Hallelujah it would cause a throng it would cause a draw who's the one that can give eternal life and he he's just in you hallelujah amen the whole world would go mad trying to get to you I need to speak to him he they would they would need the Army to keep them away and then the Army would turn on you and try and get a hold of them if they really recognized and we just go every day oh and he spoke to me here and he blessed me here and I looked up at this and he and he spoke and he came to me there when I was driving oh my think of it the great Lord Of Glory well I know dwells in me don't take it common just draw on oh I have a great need in my life draw on what's In You amen what's in you amen the name of Jesus everything must bow to his name am everything must bow that means everything must bow to the bow to the Eternal one that's in you amen it must listen Amen to the god that dwells in you I have a knee just draw let him take control let him speak amen God has to use man God has to use a woman doesn't matter who it is amen let him let him use you now Jesus warned of this day I'm just going to do like a a a flip side of all these things so so in Matthew 24 Jesus says and because iniquity shall abound the love of many shall wax C he's warning of the end time and we can see that in this world the love of many has wax we see why that's why there's divorce on every side and ruined homes and now it's Blended families has become the Norman you know there's a lot of pain associated with those things it's because because of iniquity upon the Earth the love of people is waxed cold and that is the same in the church World Pete y Christians are the the fervent desire hey you you you go back 50 years you go back just after isusa Street Pentecostal people they're on fire for God Amen and mean they were they were sold out they were thrown out and they were sold out and they didn't care you know when I was in Papa guine last Pastor Robert knucker there who's who he was in the PNG Bible Church well-connected man in the country he said pastors are just quitting left right and Center just quitting because they give themselves and they give themselves and then they get burnt out and they and and they just quit why is that because there's a coldness there's a cold drafter is coming amen because of iniquity the of many's and that's not they're sincere people I'm not saying you know I'm not saying they're not sincere this but they're just burnt out they can't do it anymore why cu the love and it's God has to put that there that is wax cold and they just throw it away and now but this is not what we're called to do I just want to read something from the church age book it's from it's about the Ephesian Church age he said now excuse me now the complaint against the Ephesian church we understand was um you know that they had left their first love this one thing I have against you you have lost your first love now he speaks now he he says this is from the church book he says you start out with truly born- again Believers and when the next Generation comes along they're no longer just plain Christians they have to take a denominational name and an now Baptist Methodist Etc that is exactly what they are too they're not Christians you have to be born of the will of God not of the will of man to be saved but these folks are all coming together now by the will of man I don't say that some of them aren't right with God not for a minute do I say that but the original fire has died down yes they are not the same anymore the fervent desire to please God the passion to know his word the cry for the reaching out in the spirit all begins to fade and instead of that church being on fire with the fire of God it is cooled off and become a bit formal that is what was happening back there to the Ephesians they getting a bit formal the abandonment to God was dying out and the people weren't too careful about what God thought of them as they begin to be careful about the world thought of them now remember the Ephesians the word Ephesus means to aim at but relax so they aimed at the high calling in Christ and but that age begin to relax that's why he said now that they they when they came and there was a fire for God and the aband out to God and the desire to know his word and crying out in the spirit that begin to fade yes and now brother Ram tells us at the end of the age at the end of this age is other Ephesians again that that a people would would because they begin to drift and the church eventually died now it's come forth and now the believer has that the the bride worldwide has come to another Ephesians and I can tell you this much that we do not have another seven Church ages we have not another time where where people can look at the land and say every promise is good but we can't take it you and then go back into the Wilderness again but there's a people here that are not going to not going to burn down they're not just going to settle down and be formal because you're got to take the opposite of what was happening in the Ephesian age you got to take the opposite cuz instead of us going down and drifting we just keep going up amen that there's something in us that says I will not go the way like they did but I'm going to take everything that belongs to me if healing is in there I got healing if restoration of families in there they're going to be restored if there's Redemption for me I'm going to have Redemption amen if there's peace in there there's going to be peace amen if there's a body change in there I'm going to have a body change of all things that he has I become I'm going to have that Hallelujah we have not being called to just become formal and a bit formal amen but I trust I believe God has put a fire in a Zeal and a Zeal isn't always a big burning Wildfire but it's a Burning Flame I mean it's in someone say I'm going to serve God doesn't matter how much I express it there's a burning there's a there's a Burning Flame in them I trust it's in you am mean there's something in you said whatever comes if my family leaves if my pastor leave if my church disappears I'm going to serve God I'm going to walk with him as this message is said amen I'm going to follow my alas all the way to Isaac Hallelujah so they had to go down so I'll say this now that the fervent desire to please God the passion to know his word to cry for the reaching out of the all begins to increase Hallelujah and that's where we are friends hey if you're encumbered by something and it's getting in the way kick it off amen you say I've got to absolutely live your life love your children raise them work through all these things kick out Facebook kick out all the stuff thaty it's getting in the way kick it out am amen kick out what you say well I need to know what's happening this is what's happening this is modern events are made clear by the prophecy brother R tells us he says now and what does he go to he goes to Luke chap 24 what's happening in Luke 24 there's two Believers amen going on the way to emus their world has fallen apart they think their Revival is dead yes amen their great Messiah they believe as the Messiah is dead yesen the church leaders have locked themselves away once committed suicide we've never been in that situation friends and they do have no idea that the resurrection's taking place the greatest week in history the prophet tells us is being lived out in their part of it and their whole world is falling apart and here they are walking along and here comes someone that they don't recognize but they've walked with amen for a couple of years and he begins to open the word to us he begins to speak to them and he begins to identify was he not Cru was he not given to the hands of wicked men did he not cry out my God my God was H forsaken me did he not have a tomb you know did he not use a tomb and all these different things and you know didn't didn't Moses speak of him and he went all the way staying from Moses and the Psalms he spoke of everything concerning himself he opened the scripture Amen to them Hallelujah and then now and then they came into the house at evening time and they sat down and had a meal and he took the bread and he did something he did before he died on the cross and then their eyes are opened and they knew it was him Hallelujah they recognized they're in the resurrection hallelujah amen and the greatest thing was now the resurrected one that they didn't recognize came by their way if you're wondering what's going on in the world speak of speak of what's look at it in the scripture they were talking about the word being fulfilled in their hour they couldn't put it together they didn't understand what was going on and then they weren't talking about Moses they weren't talking about maybe how the creation happened they're talking about well here we believed he was going to be the one and we saw him on the donkey come into the city nean crying out hosana and we thought now finally he's going to drive the Romans out because never a man spake like this man and we saw him C the sea and we saw him raised Lazarus and we saw him do all these things nature obeyed him every devil in hell obeyed him everything was under his feet but yet he was taken you know he was like a sheep done before the slaughter and all these things and now he's been taken he's been you know this is what they're talking about amen and now the resurrected one comes their way and he opens the word to them and it causes them to see this is where you are this is where you are if you know where you are in here you need to know where you are in hereall the church world knows that Jesus died rose again is coming again but where are but where are we in here because if you don't know where you are in here you don't know where how how soon it is to to go to where you're going amen that's why we need to look into the word and say this is where we are and so he he broke the bread and he did something he did before he was crucified and now brother Ram says that whole chapter is modern events made clear by Pro made clear by the prophecy and he reads Luke chapter 24 and in the beginning of that chapter now we have the woman going to the tomb and they know about spices they know about the Dead know about all these things but then they come now to the tomb and the stones rolled away and an angel appears and says he's not here but he's risen amen amen and you may be going to the tomb you may be going somewhere that maybe he was here where I you know maybe this place but I God's saying he's not there but he's risen amen I mean don't look into some dead tomb amen go to where he is amen and then they went there and they didn't understand all all the angels and all these things and they were part of that they were part of the Resurrection but on the way tomus the woman that went to the tomb they went into the upper room you understand and the resurrection didn't finish when Jesus arose but the resurrection continued on now when that same Jesus in different form came in to those 120 and they were resurrected from a life of death and trespass and sins and were alive and you in Jesus Christ so they were part of that Resurrection seasonall Hallelujah glory and we are here so brother says these modern events 2015 are made clear by Luke 24 amen this is oh I need to know I need to read the news read Luke 24 but notice in Luke 24 Jesus when he rose he didn't go speak to pilate he didn't speak to chaes or go to the temple he went to his elected ones that were part of the word and he made them he made them deadly sure that they knew I've risen you're going to be risen Hallelujah and this caused them now to recognize it's not just they were in the resurrection but it caus them to recognize they are part of that resurrection and brother R preaches in the it is the rising of the sun he says what a resurrection that was says what a resurrection this is anden a people have come out of a tomb of dark denominationalism and me have come forth in newness of Life what a resurrection this is I mean there's a resurrected people upon the Earth that are not dead and trespasses and sins anymore but have come forth a newness of Life Hallelujah and he' speak these things saying this is where you areen and the world's fall their world was falling apart this world is falling apart amen people are troubled by these things they were troubled by the things that were going on but then the Lord came their way and that's why I say this unseen one that walks with you is the most important one when he went there they didn't you know he was in his glorified state but he didn't reveal himself fly who he was but then he just pointed himself out in the word amen now that is for the first Adam the first Adam is identifying himself in the word and then now I mean sorry the second Adam is identif finding himself in the word Jesus is the second Adam and then now we have come to the end of the ages and now if he's the second Adam there must be a second Eve yes amen the woman has to be restored and then now here comes a part of that second Eve a prophet a redeemed son amen and God that that second Adam steps into that man and begins to identify now the second Eve in the scripture amen that's why he preaches invisible Union that's why he preaches choosing of a bride that's why he preaches all these things amen that's why he preaches on the Jubilee Hallelujah that's why he preaches on all these things CU he's identifying now she's free she belongs to me she always belonged to me and she's part of me Hallelujah and she be you know he begins to reveal and he doesn't also do that but he reveals this is who Jesus is that he's high above he's Supreme deity Glory the most important Revelation is the Supreme deity of Jesus Christ brother Ram tells us amen and he does that now because we're part of him amen if you can see him as he is then you can see yourself Hallelujah am I'm just on this I'm just being beaten I'm being dragged through the mud no you are part of the Supreme one you're are you part of have you been called by his name have you taken on his name is his life in you what does that mean you're part of him Hallelujah you're not being dragged through the mud look up hallelujah amen look look at him and and I'm going to go on to that too but you see we're in this time where there's a love affair between us and God A Love Affair for me for me this is a love affair it's been it's been eight nearly eight years it's been a love affair Hallelujah this month I can't in what day it's all right a Saturday it was a Saturday anyway he says this this is imperfect Faith he says if God when I was an alien from him so loved me till he stooped down to get me and pick me up that gives me confidence that he wants to use me who's been picked upj who's been picked up amen he's got a purpose in doing it he's seen something in me I don't see too much he's seen something in me you know it's like an antique dealer someone could you know my parents used to watch the show Antiques Road Show and they you know in the UK and they would people would drag out all this stuff and it's like hundreds and hundreds of years old and it just looked like a chested you know it didn't look like anything of value to me hey I could appreciate the woodwork and whatever more but the antique dealer who knew who was a specialist in this era of furniture whatever it was he could identify this is who made it this is how he could see the value that the common man could never see in it amen amen now God's come your way amen you may never see any value in yourself yes amen but God saw value in you God saw value in you that's why he spoke to you that's why he turned your your heart towards him because he saw value amen never diminish what what you are that's right I'm just I don't feel very good and I feel down about myself forget that God saw God saw value I wish I put this up here and we could have just just read it over and over for about an hour God so value am mean that's why he called you he seen something in you he had a reason to save you look at the people that's unsaved today look at the millions he could have took beside you but he took you remember there was heaps of other woman there when Isaac was alive but he took one amen amen no one can take your place hallelujah amen you're in God's economy no one can do it that's his love to you then won't Your Love reach right back to him and there's a love affair no matter what the situation is its circumstances is governed by this love that creates faith I need to read that again no matter what the situation is who's going through a situation no matter what the situation is amen its circumstances is governed amen by this love that creates Faith hallelujah amen the really yes the circumstances of the situation are governed it doesn't govern you you govern it amen you govern it amen but little old me you're part of the creator of heavens and earth amen amen this is what this is what I read in here when I read this when I read Paul's writings that's what I read I'm part of the creator of heavens and earth he says in Ephesians 3 Jesus Christ who made the worlds who made the worlds and the whole family Heaven and Earth is named named Jesus Christ amen we're coair with him are we not we're ears of the father join ears with the son hallelujah what does a coair mean everything he has belongs to you and vice versa that's why when Esther came before the king he said I'll give you it up to half the kingdom wasn't just a split the kingdom 50/50 he's saying everything I have is in your hands Hallelujah no matter what this I'll just read this again no matter what the situation is it circumstances is governed by this love affair that creates faith that God loves you and you love God and you love one another and that brings the faith oh I need more faith just say Lord I love you mean it from your heart hey he died for you wouldn't you a year a sinner he died for you he loved you Hallelujah amen so love creates Faith now that uh that you that God loves you trying and you love God and you love one another that brings the faith all right then it it can't keep it can't keep from bringing out exactly what God promised it will do now what's perfect faith is pure just as pure as lovers see I need perfect Faith love him amen love creates Faith love is pure it creates a perfect Faith amen just let it I'm just letting it sink in a whole bunch brother man you know he says y beyond the curtain of time he's taking beyond the curtain of time he says it's just Sublime greater than everything there is you know whatever you do don't miss that place speaking of heaven and he says it take perfect love to get there say well okay I need perfect love to get there love Faith produces love oh love produces Faith rather well I need a perfect love to get there he died for you and that creates a faith a love in you for him what does it generate perfect love amen is it that simple it is that simple you have to jump through hoops have to you know we're not a bunch of Catholics that have to go on pilgrimages all over the place and then do Penance if maybe we trip up someplace just get up walk with God you already have what you need amen I need to climb some steps and do some prayers no it's in here amen without money or Price the scripture tells us you have it here you go freely you have received a so freely gift amen amen well I'm not in that right space don't look at you look at him he's in the right space amen hallelujah don't worry about yeah now now what's perfect faith is pure just as pure as lovers now when you love somebody you love your husband or love your wife now there's no need of anybody telling you you don't do it because you do it and you know you do it you know someone can't tell me I don't love my wife I you can't tell me that I just love her I I I can't deny it no more than I can deny I'm standing here amen amen cuz it's just in me you understand and so when people say oh you the Devil comes your way you're not a Christian you don't love him if you love him you do all this stuff he say I'm sorry devil amen it's too late buddy I fell in love with my Isaac amen hallelujah amen they can't you can't don't let the devil try and squeeze it out of you saying you don't you you're not really believe you don't really love him he's lying you can't deny it amen and now this uh few few paragraphs down and now we become Anointed with that same Spirit anointed messiah messiah of the last day to shine forth the resurrection of Jesus Christ to show he's not dead but in the form of the Holy Ghost he's in his people moving among his bride with a love affair to her pouring out into her himself yes am mean they are becoming one for the wedding supper and the same signs promised by the same God in the same word is making his same manifestation there's nothing left for us but believe it and believe it is the substance and that creates perfect Faith amen you believe it it just creates perfect faith and just think how numb we are just think of it just for a minute now let's see has he done all things well uh I'm just going to put that question you know has he ever told us anything but what happened just exactly the way he said it hasn't he performed and hasn't the great Pillar of Fire been Among Us and done just exactly like he promised to do you okay bring this just here has he not done what he promised he would do for us amen has he not prom has he not done it he said if you remain humble my word will go forth and my children will come and they'll find their rest has he not done what he promised he would do have we not seen the great Pillar of Fire move Among Us you say I've never seen a fire have you felt his anointing come down has he not promised he would be with us has he not promised he' turn our hearts back to him amen has he not done all these things Hallelujah has he not healed us when we're sick yes has he not and and if he hasn't hasn't he given us the grace to wear the through amen hasn't he given us the grace that if we've been tried by all kinds of things yet we love him more and more yeah has it you know you take job hey we all have to have job times Hallelujah we all have to have them just because you're sitting on an ash Heap maybe and and life has turned upside down doesn't mean you're not a Believer you have a lamb I've got a lamb amen you know all things under control they're all under control oh why isn't you know just like modern day friends of job can come along why aren you healed haven't you prayed yet you know why why haven't you overcome this what's wrong nothing's wrong you just maybe got to sit there for a while amen job job complained sure he complained but he sined not yet against God with his mouth the scripture tells us and he was able to endure until finally he saw the Resurrection come Hallelujah sometimes we have to just plow through sometimes God heals us like this sometimes he uses medicine or a changeing diet sometimes we just got to bear it for a season but God allows those different things to come upon you because God has said to Satan try her she's perfect she's not going to deny me Hallelujah you can do whatever you want she's just going to rejoice and shout and keep walking she's going to walk with me and so Satan says sure I'll try Hallelujah hello job how are we Glory he had confidence in job under the blood of bulls and goats yes how much more the Bride of Jesus Christ under the blood of the true L amen amen has he not has he ever told us anything that's what is exactly exactly the way he said it and we could go into what brother brandham said about where we are in the day and hour we're alive and it's just all come together exactly like he said and we'll go on it maybe in the future service but that's incredible as an HEB for now um hasn't he done exactly like he promised to do hasn't we seen it hasn't science taken it been having been predicted what would happen go right there and happen even in the papers and magazines pack it right out and shows it when it's told you months before it happened hasn't he done exactly the way he did in the Old Testament in the New Testament and it's just exactly the same one my he's done all these things hasn't it he's done he is faithful and Truth amen that's one thing I've come to discover is faithful and true Hallelujah now he's speaking he's speaking of when he's away and he's coming back home you know to his wife there should be such a hunger for us to get to one another it should be a love affair I can't hardly wait to get to Tucson oh God heal my little wife she's part of me I can't hardly wait to get there the hours I'm counting the days and the hours when I can get there to pardon me to be with her that's the way the church ought to be just seeing that the power of God what it's done for us we should be counting the moments getting together in love that we can fly away someday to meet Jesus somebody said not long ago brother brandom you scare the people saying that the coming of the Lord's so close I said they shouldn't be worried about that they should be the most happy thing we know of he says oh yeah and and he will appear the second time that those that love is appearing who love and who love and longing for it you know I'll be honest I'm not scared about the tribulation yes I'm not I don't serve the Lord cuz I want to miss the tribulation I'm not even I don't even serve the Lord to dodge hell I serve him because I love him I serve him because I love him very early in my Christian walk I said to the Lord I said Lord you can you can you can throw me into hell i'll worship you there and at least even if he condemns me I get an opportunity to see him face to face and say I love you and he can do whatever he want with me after that at least I get the opportunity hallelujah oh yes amen I serve him because I love him amen amen our redeeming love Hallelujah found a rich like me Hallelujah would you serve him even if he went to hell this life is the best life amen I just want to fulfill his plan whatever his plan for me is I want to live it out you know someone said to brother baram he says I believe you're the Antichrist he says well if that's the will of God for my life so be it amen well that's pretty strong well hey if that is his I love him anyway whatever he has for me in this life I love him whatever he has for me in the next life I'll love him anyway he's so good Hallelujah to take our sin away am mean to change our nature Amen to cause us just to fall in love with him it's Inc you can't buy what we have you say I'm just getting from week to week you can't buy what you have money you know there's a guy he made the Minecraft game never played it billionaire and he's he's he's he's down and depressed and empty cuz he discovered what uh how they call it now it's it's it's affluenza people who affid have all the money but yet they're empty inside well yeah of course they don't have the Lord you know cuz they have everything but they're empty yet they look at us and say you have nothing but we have everything Hallelujah cuz we have himen hallelujah amen they shouldn't be worried about it they should be the most happy thing we know of and he says it's a love affair and how we ought to love one another because we're fellow citizens in the same body we should have love one for another uh he says warning us a time is at hand Believers should be separating themselves from the things of the world the cares of the world they say it should be a love of fear and how do you know if someone loves their brother and sister they love the Lord amen you can't just say I love Jesus I don't want nothing to do with the Brethren amen because everything everything that is that is our relationship with him has a outworking here that's why you see now a real dad in his position who knows what the hand of redemption is amen can can take his family and lift them up to where he is amen you know the problem is people like Mary and Joseph these days they go to you know like they go to Jerusalem during the Passover they have a wonderful time and then they leave assuming that their kids are coming with them yes and three days joury they discover Hey where's Jesus take your kids with you say well they don't they're only this big take them with amen don't don't walk on with God and they they're back somewhere in the existence right remember Redemption is to lift what belongs to you and lift it up that's what Jesus did he redeemed us because he saw something in you he saw a part of himself so he lifted you up out of a world of sin and then he transformed you and he brought you to be co-equal with him that's what Redemption is amen amen and so now to for that to be expressed in the family is that now the dad comes down you can only do it if you know him it's got to be an outworking in your home where where your children can see the Hat can actually see Redemption lived out that you want to lift your children up hey they might not hey they're just kids teenagers whatever they come down to their level stay on their level and then when they get older you just lift up a bit higher with them walk with them hey God does it with us you know when he reveals himself to you you know this is a Bible and that's probably about it amen amen you don't know the mystery you don't know the mystery of Redemption all these great big you know the opening of the seals where we are in time you know all these things all you know is that God died for you and you love him he comes to your level and he begins to lift you up and then your eyes become open you recognize I'm a joint here with Christ I'm the Bride of Jesus Christ everything he did now I've received Hallelujah that I'm his his Royal Blood now flows through my veins hey you didn't know that really when you first met him Redemption lifted you up then to the father come into the home it doesn't matter which way the kids are going redeeming love can be expressed and they can be lifted up an atmosphere can be created hallelujah amen now he says is in Christ The Mystery of God revealed he says that great manifested God in Christ now Christ manifested in you will'll hurry look what was once God's Great secret great mysterious Secret in his mind mind is now put in the hearts of the believer remember alasa called Rebecca to become one with Isaac and now Alazar now was telling Rebecca things that he knew about Isaac that no one else knew amen and it wasn't his opinion he was actually revealing the heart of Isaac it's like that's why the prophet Came Upon the Earth he's revealing the he's revealing God and and only a way that the bride can catch it and become one with him amen he's revealing things many people saw the Miracles but the bride saw Christ amen they saw the man Christ Jesus and so now he would speak things that Drew you into a relationship with Christ and things that you rejoice in people can look at the same thing and say what's so neat about that where you can go to the Book of Ruth and sure people can maybe see the Plan of Redemption but you can see yourself in there and it becomes a living this is not stories becomes a living reality you can see yourself and you're with Joseph and you're up in the palace when he reveals himself to his Brethren and you can see yourself as Ruth and Rahab and you can see yourself as Tamar and all these different ones and Basher and you can see yourself in the word and it's not you trying to work it out something just something just it just comes off the page I trust you know what I'm not trying to make it mysterious but you know what I mean where you can just read it and something says that's me and you identify with that person in in the scripture it's because now the heart of God's being expressed amen that goes beyond a newspaper but it becomes a living Christ comes off the pages Hallelujah man just that just just that shouting grounds right there am amen just to see what God just just never take for granted if I repeat myself I don't care don't take for granted if this is alive to you if this is this alive to you you're the most blessed person upon the Earth amen that the word of God is alive to you hallelujah hallelujah that's that is the you can't put God reveals himself to his elected ones that's right amen whosoever will let them come short but if God has become real and this is not a newspaper anymore they say well it's a newspaper to me Just Surrender Your Life life just be willing to give all and then he'll come and make it real amen hallelujah hey I there was a day where this was a story and then it became real and it was only after I said Lord take everything out of my life that's contrary to your word that you can dwell in me what I what you know I didn't know anything apart from that I meant it with all my heart you have to pray some big long prayer just be real and then he came and just did what only he can do Hallelujah Glory now so now he's whispering remember Faith cometh by hearing and hearing the word of God and that also creates love yeah so when he whispers his secrets in your ear when this becomes alive hey the more God has opened this to me and don't say well you because you preach you understand things no it's God just being God when he when when he quickens this to you it creates a love I'm just speaking from experience it creates a love for me and then so now when alaza was speaking things to Rebecca it created a love for Isaac amen amen in her so now he's saying he's saying now Christ manifested in you he says look what was once God's Great secret great mysterious Secret in his mind is now put in the hearts of the believer that is the body of Christ what was God God's once great Secret in his mind before the foundation of the world is now manifest he says think of it friends I'm sure he says he says I'm sure we don't get it well um he says he says I can't see it in the way I ought to and I'm sure you don't either he says but God's great mystery what Eternal God has a mystery has now been unfolded in Jesus Christ then has been given down to his church what was once in God's mind is now in the body of Christ Jesus making love to the church's bride whispering secrets to her you know how you tell your wife things you know the little girl you're going to marry you love her so much you just tell her the secrets and get her up next to you and you love her and everything he says you know how it is what is that now you tell her things and share things doesn't matter even if you maybe don't talk a whole bunch you'll tell your wife things that you don't tell anyone else what is that your revealing Secrets amen because you're in a relationship with her amen because she's part of you and then so now God comes and he whispers Secrets am amen things things that you can't work out but he's Whispering Secrets because he loves you Hallelujah am mean and it creates a love of fear Hallelujah now you know how it is that's what God Christ is doing to the church see he's letting her know the secrets just the secrets not these flirters I mean his wife see all right by having having the revelation of his secret made known to them by his grace how the grace of God people I know it I hope you don't think it sounds personal to a bunch of people or this uh that but the secret that God is sharing with the whole church if they would just receive it see it doesn't mean just me or just you it means the church that he's trying to get into it hallelujah oh is that the time okay I might I might just leave it there but God yeah it's it's 252 I got like four more pages now but this is God no don't don't take it for granted now this is a love affair between him and you amen and remember he initiated the love affair you're just a responder amen so the more he pours in you just pour it back to him hallelujah it's a love affair amen cuz we're on our way amen changing the body to me our Isaac hallelujah amen that is where we're going sorry I don't even have time to finish the next part but you see you know don't take it for granted when God opens this to you treasure it treasure it with all your life because there's there's been schools and institutions that have given their whole men have given men and women have given lives to study this and they don't hold the key they don't understand what it says and yet he'll come come to you and you'll be reading something and it'll just open up and and become real and they look at the same thing and they just see they don't see what it's really saying remember brother Ram TS he says it's like when his wife writes him a letter and she's writing you know had a busy day I just put the kids to bed and all these different things and he says because she he loves her he reads between the lines of the letter and rarely sees her heart now it's the same with the scripture reading between the lines doesn't make it say anything different but because you're in a relationship am me with the author you can rarely see what he's saying hallelujah amen and that's why you got to be in a relationship amen don't just look in and say why are these people so excited enter into a relationship amen amen with Jesus Christ and you'll see why we're excited amen because the Bible says in Romans that the love of God is brought in our hearts by the Holy Ghost which is given to us [Music] hallelujah amen and that's where we are can we have some musicians Amen to come I think we should just I don't know if we have the song but you say alasa tell me more amen you listen to the word listen to the message I never I'm probably you know I learned something in in um maybe I'm not built this way but in in University I learned one thing that people can study they can give their lives and study things now there biochemistry and they can give their whole life and study it but then they miss the very creator that they're talking about and they can even use you we were looking at uh the active s of enzymes and how it works like blood how it picks up oxygen and how it does its thing and they would use the words like it's so welld designed so welld design and it is well-designed but do they believe in God no sir not for a second they think it's wrong that people take this literally amen now and I and I discovered there that people can study something with their mind with their mind and they can miss the whole thing but if you study it now with your heart and say Lord open it to me so if you take your mind you'll never see it if you say Lord open it to me and study it with your heart then he'll open it am you understand and so that's that's why I say when you listen to the tapes don't just don't just have in your mind now I'm going to listen about perfect Faith or or whatever just say Lord speak to me out of this message speak to me out of the unveiling of God like brother Donnie was saying and new things open up why is that cuz it's listening from your heart alasa what are you telling me about my Isaac amen amen tell me more am then what happens it creates more love for him it creates a love of fear Hallelujah you want to see a people madly in love look at the bride of Christ amen they may not be so expressive in it but there's something in them saying I love him he is he is king of my life I don't have my own op I don't want my opinion anymore amen I want him amen that he'd have preeminence in every facet of my life that's incredible thing amen for a man or woman or child just to give their whole life not just that they'd be saved but he's Lord over every every facet Hallelujah that's incredible thing man has spent thousands of years saying I'll do it my way and now there's a bride at the end time and Satan's Eden saying I don't want my way anymore hallelujah what a paradox that is hallelujah and and here we are so all that so how can I obtain to that you already have that if you want in your heart to Lord I want to serve you cuz I love you what is that he's become head over your life and you want him to do whatever he wants amen hallelujah I'll never be that kind of a Christian you you've given everything yes that's why I think you know the unveiling of God also unveils you this The Book of Revelation unveils you as well am and many times we look at these things and say how incredible that is yes and then we say we could never become what's being spoken of I think a lot of time we just need to look into the mirror and actually say now this is me amen when brother Bram said that God and the bride is one that she is him she is the feminine part of you just go back into Genesis Hallelujah Eve Eve was taken out of Adam she didn't even have the name Eve yet she was just she was called Adam and then now when God brings Eve Eve was in Adam she was there when he had dominion over the Earth as Spirit from all these things she wasn't she was in him when when he did it but she wasn't fully conscious of what's going she was just in him and then now Eve Eve comes out of Adam and it wasn't Eve going to Adam saying I am flesh of your flesh bone of your bone I am you it was Adam that said you are Flesh of My Flesh bone of my bone you are me you are man amen and now so God has come down in this end time because he has determined that he would tell you you are Flesh of My Flesh your bone of my bone your life of my life your power of my power you are me Hallelujah we think we can never become those things yes just read what the word say says about you amen hallelujah you know the devil father had the vision he was a man who wasn't his dad but looked like his dad there was a woman who looked like his mom but wasn't his mom and this man had a three-edged club and was beating this woman down and she'd try and raise up again and he just beat her down and brother said I've got to do something about this you know about this said but I'm so little he said now Faith muscles begin to grow and he grabbed that man said you touch her again you got to deal with me the interpretation was now that woman was the bride of Christ trying to raise up and he was the trinitarian spirit beating beating her down amen now so the devil uses uses Christianity to beat down the bride of Christ and that's a trinitarian devil spirit amen doesn't matter if they say it's one God or whatever that's still that same demon spirit amen but God doesn't work that way he wants you to recognize amen he wants to see his victory of the Cross being lived out and that Victory is now the woman becomes me Hallelujah he wants to lift you up Amen to be exactly what you're called to be hallelujah amen amen now we need to sing that song behold what matter of man is this hallelujah amen can't lose friends we when he sees you he sees himself he doesn't see benl or whoever he sees Jesus Christ I shall call
