name amen Thank You Jeremy Amen god bless everyone I have been wonderful to have you all here amen praise the Lord I mean if you've got your Bibles handy now we're gonna go to first samuel 22 and also after service we've got fellowship lunch unfortunately we couldn't get the ball which we normally have it's been booked i was booked already but um but our home is open also the Clifford's open their home so we're gonna kind of divide into two and have some wonderful fellowship a man who loves the Lord this morning I mean there's got a First Samuel 22 and then we're gonna go to second Corinthians so first samuel 22 and verses we're just going to read verses 1 and 2 it says David therefore departed thence the David's now on the run and escape to the cave Abdulla and when his brethren and all of his father's house heard it they went down hitherto to him and everyone that was in distress and everyone that was in debt and everyone that was discontented gathered themselves under him and he became a captain over them and there were with him about 400 men I mean unless go to second Corinthians chapter 3 this is I pray this is a very familiar piece of Scripture to everyone it is not just a scripture you maybe have in your mind but you're living it out I mean the second Corinthians 3 we're going to read verses 15 to 18 but unto this day when Moses is read the veil is upon their heart nevertheless when it shall turn to the Lord the veil shall be taken away so we are someone who's not turn to the Lord there's a veil over there bail over them right upon me heart now the Lord is that spirit and where the Spirit of the Lord is there is Liberty but we all with open face beholding as in a glass the glory the Lord are changed into the same image from glory to glory even by the Spirit of the Lord Amen may the Lord bless his word this morning you may have your seats and I want to talk about God's transforming power now I want to lay out a few things just just first now we read we read here and Samuel about David and all the ones that gathered to him and I'm going to refer to this but I want to say that they were those people together today but were transformed they became David's mighty mean so they were the state they started and was not the state they finished in right they came in debt discontented distressed whatever state but they became David's mighty men they were transformed right because David David's life of becoming King was actually prophecy and they knew that he was coming into power to become king and the same anointing that same word that came upon David came upon them and have made them David's mighty men now to be transformed the word well let's start with it says we're to spread Lord is there is Liberty now this does not mean we can do whatever we wish to do that is not the Liberty it's speaking of but in the Greek it means freedom and the root word of this is and all as unrestrained which means to go at pleasure that is at a citizen not a slave so you become free born so it means to be at liberty it means you're not a slave anymore you are not you're not a slave but you're a Freeborn citizen I mean see you have change from being a slave a slave you're not dictate can I go can I come can I do what I want no you're a slave you're under a slave master you're told what to do and you have no choice what you can do what you cannot do but those who are citizens are no longer slaves what they've been doing chain I mean living transformed and in for a slave to us to a citizen so we're the Spirit of the Lord is there is Liberty that a people can go as citizens of the kingdom of God and not slaves under Satan right so we are free we are free born we are not bound by the enemy or his devices hallelujah so so now and also now as we're beholding we all with an open face beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord now an open face means an unveiled face and if there's no veil of tradition there's no veil of man's ideas and then when brother Brad preaches swim and the mighty God on bow before us as not just a nice idea was declaring that the mighty God of the Bible the Lord Jesus Christ is unveiled himself in this hour through his word and he's he's manifested himself in front of you I mean so when we see this message I mean manifested I mean that's God making himself known to a generation a minute when we behold him as he is we are trained from glory to glory amen into the same image so we had transformed I mean from what we were in the beginning and we're transformed from glory to glory into the image of God I mean so we become the living manifestation of his word hallelujah so that's what it means now we're not we're not beholding him through a veil trying to work out what he's like and what he doesn't like it his nature and his character and how he operates we're not we're now looking through that kind of veil the veils being taken off power your whole traditions have been stripped away man's ideas man's Creed's man's whatever it may be we're not looking through that kind of oh yeah well anyway what does this mean does this mean this does this mean that God just said this is what my word is I mean god interprets his word by bringing it to posture God proves his word by manifesting the truth of it hallelujah so now I say if you cannot but if you are still veiled in your heart you cannot be changed from glory to glory I mean that's why that veil must be done away with he must be born again I'm in the and yeah if you're not born again you cannot see or understand or comprehend the kingdom of God make sense right if you cannot really see what you're looking at it doesn't make sense to you and the more someone tries to explain it the more frustrated you'll become right but if you can really see you can understand it you can comprehend it that means you've been born again that means you can you can really understand what you're looking at hallelujah so now we are being transformed right I'm not talking about something in the future the word now is transforming a bride hallelujah and I'll just drop this in from the get-go the reason David became King as in him was to be king and him was the kingship and him was to be on the throne before he was even a shepherd boy he was ordained to be king right gifts and callings of God are without repentance are irrevocable what God has declared a person will be they will be hallelujah trust in your election God's called me cause he lectured me to a certain position doesn't matter what the buzzards say then they say say that critics say I'm on my way to Canaan freely I'm on my way up into the New Jerusalem hallelujah be made I mean I've been predestinated to be conformed to the image of his son which is the image of his word hallelujah if God's made me last times us go argue with him about it please go why are you talking to me about a go talk to him I mean I am his workmanship you know have you ever seen someone maybe some people do maybe they're funny in their mind they see a masterpiece on the wall and they begin to argue at the painting you're wrong this is painted your your Arrangements wrong your compositions around the colors on your wrong if you have seen someone argue at their painting thank you thank you who they go take it up with the artist but people come and haven't got the painting right they say they accuse you they say I know you're wrong this is wrong this is not true I say no talk to him about it I'm just the painting [Music] hallelujah we are we have been predestinated to be conformed to the image of a son which is the word amen to the word transformed that's where we get the word metamorphosis from there's a transformation to change from one thing to another right just like you know a butterfly doesn't start off as a butterfly it starts off as a caterpillar but then goes through a metamorphosis goes through a transformation but in it is to be a butterfly all it has to do is walk along and eat the leaf and be a caterpillar but eat and eat and eat Anita me and then eventually the life and it transforms itself right is the same thing with the Bride of Christ we've received amen brother Bram says that the shout he says in the rapture measures a shot as the Living bread which brings forth the living bride and then to the word it's just like your honor it's like the caterpillar eats the leaf becomes a butterfly the bride eats the word and it brings forth the living bride right this message will bring forth a living bright and it has and it is you are the proof people want to see vindication look at you look what the believer look at what God has done for you hallelujah you want proof amen a testimony is evidence that the word is true a real testimony is proof that the word is true right that's what a testimony is and God is testifying in the believer my word is truth they believe they took me at my word that's all you're gonna do take God at His Word right don't look at me now just take out of this word amen and faith it will produce what it says it will produce alleluiah so to be transformed it means to go through a metamorphosis amen so those who are free so we're the spirit of Lord is there's Liberty we're no longer slaves right the Lord is by the blood of Jesus Christ is loosed us from our sin amen we have been freed right we're no longer the people we once were you may be bound up and religion wherever you're from it doesn't matter what are you now what if God done for you I mean where have you come from and where are you now I'm not worried I'm not what I used to be hallelujah I may not be what I want to be yes right this and it's full manifestation but I'm thank God I'm not what I used to be I'm being changed from glory to glory I mean what you what you behold is what you become right if you behold atheism you'll become an atheist right if you behold critics voices you'll become a critic if you behold the voice of God you'll become the living manifestation of the Bible amen now Paul says in 2nd Corinthians three and one and three he sees down well I'll say this so those who are free behold the Lord with unveiled eyes and they are transformed their change from into his image and he is the word amen so you become transformed from glory glory to glory being made into the Living manifestations of his word that's what the bride becomes and the Apostle Paul puts it this way he says do we begin again to commend ourselves or need we as some others epistles of combination to you or letters of condemnation from you ye are our epistle written in our hearts known and read of all men for as much as ye are manifestly declared to be the Epistle of Christ ministered by US written not with ink but with the spirit of the Living God not in tables of stone but in the fleshly tables of the hearts he's saying that they are the manifestation of the word that they have preached right they have become the living manifestation of what they preach right and that is what the truth the true believer receives the word by faith into their hearts and it produces what is ministered to them hallelujah now brother Bram says in the mighty God I'm available for theses and Jesus said as it was the days of Sodom so shall it be at the coming of the Son of Man deity veiled again and human flesh now remember Jesus didn't say when the Son of God is revealed and Luke the 17th chapter I believe about the twenty 21st verse somewhere along they said but when the Son of Man is revealed the son of man back in the church again revealed and human beings he didn't say reveal in human being one revealed in human beings so in the Son of Man Jesus Christ is back in the church again revealed in human beings right so the you know many times we take Luke 17 thirty that will when the Son of Man being revealed of course that was manifested in the prophets ministry but it's not just manifested there I'm in the son of man ministry is continuing on in the Bride of Christ hallelujah so now he is revealed in human beings if he is in you he is being revealed in your flesh right when people see you they should see Jesus they may not understand what they're looking at they may not be able to say what do you believe this away you this way but when they're looking at you they see Jesus hallelujah that's how it should be that God deity is veiled in human flesh once again Alleluia and that's why the that's why Paul said in first Corinthians 11 when he's speaking about when he's speaking about communion he says for he that eateth and drinketh unworthily eateth and drinketh damnation to himself not discerning the Lord's body he's talking about the body of the Lord as the people right people are not discerning the Lord's body and I'll and I'll say it's very simply because we are not meat to be knowing after the flesh right we don't know it we shouldn't know each other by personality and this is where you're from this is what they got caught up with Jesus he's from Nazareth this is his mom this is a sibling sisters here this is where he's from you know you know and his own people were caught up in his humanity but when it was God made flesh but those who could look beyond the veil of his humanity saw Messiah right the woman at the well didn't say you're a Jew from Nazareth therefore your Messiah she said we know we're Messiah cometh he will do these things right so she looked beyond the veil of his humanity and knew him as Messiah right hallelujah just like the Apostle Paul you'd look at him you'd say here comes the hook-nosed Jewry comes you know how every you know presents himself those who look beyond the valves of his humanity saw God revealing himself now sees here in Romans 12 I beseech you therefore brethren by the mercies of God that you present your bodies a living sacrifice holy acceptable unto God which is your reasonable service and be not conformed to this world but be transformed by the renewing of your mind that you may prove that what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of God says don't be conformed to the thinking of this world do not be conformed to this world don't let the the world with its cookie cutter pattern of whatever be stepped upon you but be transformed then your thinking go through a metamorphosis I mean from being just thinking about culture and this is me and this is my family then you begin to think no I'm a child of God holy I be made in His image I mean I'm going I came from eternity I'm going back to eternity hallelujah that's how it should be now brother parenthesis and the power of transformation God's power to transform rather he says but brother there's one thing I can brag on I can brag on my Lord Jesus who has redeemed me and with this transforming power planted a seed by predestination and I saw it whose son am I now yeah I can brag on him and I have spent 33 years of my life bragging on him if he could spare me another 33 years old bragged more on him see I can brag on my ancestor hallelujah he that redeem him planted the seed of life in here and let me look down upon this word sit down his spirit said here it is speak this and this will and do that oh my I can brag on him how did he do that through the washing of the water by the word the waters of separation he said whisker we wish we could explain it true predestinated believers will stay with the word because they're part of that word since I wandering stars how long were you wonder you Methodist Baptist Presbyterian Outsiders whatever you might be wondering stars from church to church from pillar to place television to television world to world why don't you come on he longs to have fellowship with you he's longing for you he wants to transform you by the renewing of your mind not to the church or to the denomination but to his word I mean which you're a part of that desire is in you blessed are they that do hunger and thirst for righteousness for they shall be filled and it's sent his transforming power to bring you out of this deformity of religion that you're in and this deformity chaos that were in God has sent his transforming power his word vindicated proven to bring you out of this religious deformity of ignorance that you're walking in naked blind missable don't know it think of it friends you know God sent his transforming power to fulfill his word and he changed the whole body of Sarah and Abraham transformed an old man a tall woman because he promised here doing Alleluia now it says in Revelations 3 and 20 If any man hear my voice and open the door I will come in to him and he'll sup with me and I with him I mean that is the same voice as revelations 10 7 the 7th church age messenger now when God speaks there is transforming power in his word right when he spoke in Genesis 1 a many sand and he brooded over the earth the earth was transformed from a chaos that it was in into an Eden right when God spoke away from chaos and darkness and to an Eden amen and then now when he spoke through Moses Amen down into Egypt it transformed Israel from a bunch of slaves to a free people living in their own lands but the true believer in Israel was transformed I mean Caleb went from a slave he heard the voice of God it transformed him from a slave to the chasing a mountain and the promised land to possessing his inheritance rights he was transformed I mean he may have looked the same on the outside but the inside was very different hallelujah the Lord Jesus when he was here in the days of his flesh amen well actually let's go back a bit the Bible said out of Egypt I've called my son so Israel and and that's a that scripture has compound meeting one it speaks about Israel coming out of Egypt by Moses but it's also Jesus being called out of Egypt right so now when God spoke through Moses God was calling out his son out of Egypt so they went from slaves to sonship right they went from being a slave under Pharaoh to their position in the land right they were transformed I mean the Lord Jesus in the days of his flesh he called out of people amen and they were transformed they said under the spoken word for three and a half years and then now the word that they received the Spirit of God came into them day of Pentecost and they were transformed I mean Peter was transformed I mean from being afraid under a bit of pressure I mean to the to the boulders he had on the day of Pentecost preaching amen you know they were transformed from from a bunch of afraid people locked up in an upper room they'd boldness they went out on the street hallelujah they're transformed yes amen now the reason that they were transformed just like you take the earth why did not why did God not brood over the moon there's no life in the moon why did he not brood over Mars there's no life on Mars you could go through every planet and there's and there's a lot of planets apparently that look like they may have life but why didn't he brood over them they were seated in this earth that's why he brooded that's why his Trent that's why his word went forth over this earth with transforming power to bring forth an Eden because there was life and that life on this earth that had to be produced hallelujah and it's the same thing with you and I friends amen you've heard his word his word is transforming power and has transformed you I trusted has has transformed you you're not just looking and saying why are these people excited you know why they're excited because you experience the same thing you have experiences Redemption Alleluia amen that same God that spoken Eden has spoken through a prophet messenger in this day a man has brought a transforming power that has taken a people out of every kindred nation and tongue to produce the Bride of Christ for himself right and I said just like David and David before he was the ship it was a king right he was already king but it had to come to life that was laying dormant there he was he was there in Jesse's house just you know I don't know what he was like when he was young but there he was but then there must be a king it had to be anointed that seed and his life had to be anointed so God sent a vindicated prophet with a horn of the anointing oil any and you know why don't he anoint the other you know if he anointed a Bernard a bore the other sons a woman have brought for the king they may have felt a bit emotional they may have felt special there's no king in there it would never have produced a king but David is the king in there and Samuel was under the right leadership because he was going to anoint I've been a dam or the eldest one whatever his name was and God says no I don't look according to the outward appearance I look at the man's heart I look what's really in someone Oh helllooo yeah and then finally you know one sango's pass no it's not whom next one and maybe Jesse's thinking well surely this one and surely this one and surely this one and God saying Samuel no no no no I've lost count how many knows I've said but then they're all gone through anyway and then Samuels like well do you have another one Jesse's like I actually do why wasn't he called he wasn't considered how lujah hallelujah no I would have considered you amen the woman at the well you think she would be there as a fulfillment of our God saying I'll pour my spirit out upon all flesh now no one would think she would equate to that Peter James and John illiterate fisherman ignorant fish they are part of that prophecy but but the Karem I would say would be the high priest it'd be these scribes would be these people look they should fulfill it no not considered not considered and here you are I don't think the world would consider us to be anything but what does God consider us to be what does God say we are that's the important thing hallelujah what does God say and then finally David's called and God says this is him this is him and he kneels down the anointing oil a proper vindicated proven prophet anoint anoint Sassie and the Spirit of God the Bible says is worth it from that day forward what happens now that kingship begins to grow their kingship and is the rock and then here you are God sent a message you know what God sent a message it's an anointed the words I speak to their spur in their life right there anointed word and God release an anointed word cuz he knew that that fall into URIs and they've got from just your ease into your soul and a bring for the sea and then they would bring you bring a transforming pound here live hallelujah hey the whole anointing has been poured out on the side pour it all out not just a little bit pour the whole thing out hallelujah and it wasn't a vial like he pointed stallworth a vial denotes a judgment oh yeah he took the Horn of anointing oil poured it out hallelujah and that horn is a ram's horn Allu yeah and what happened now a transforming power came into David's life then he was really king of a sheep you know we start off small you know God is working in every situation you may just have I don't know what you do it doesn't you know it doesn't matter where you are God's working God's training you that's training you you may just have a child a little family or start a business or start a job start a career you may be learning you may be at school doesn't matter we were God is transforming you polio God had him as a shepherd because he's saying now this is how cheaper and then he and then David as the revelation the Lord is my shepherd I'm a sheep too he saw sheep behavior and people right so he could apply that training to when he was really cool Allu yeah our God is wonderful amen so he begun to go through a transformation now we're gonna go back to opening text a bit he says and that he died for all that we which live should not henceforth live unto ourselves but I'm the him which died for them and rose again wherefore henceforth henceforth means now hereafter right now now from here no we no man after the flesh yea though we have known Christ after the flesh yet now henceforth know we him no more so you say well that's a bit of an unusual think now is that what Paul is saying is you've known him as the man from Galilee right there are people that Paul was writing to we're living witnesses I was there swimming on the Mount I was there when he comes to Isaac but Jesus wasn't he had manifested himself as the men of Galilee he had purchased our Redemption Amen he had loosed his blood upon the earth to redeem of people his spirit had been loosed upon the earth but now he's not known that way anymore Rochus he's the great I am yeah he's the great item he's not that I was even though we believe what he did in history but you got to believe the present truth because the present truth ties you back into what he did in history right so now well how do we know him now because you say well I'm looking for Jesus to return with now scarred hands the next time we see is corporal bodies where we meet him in the air that's the promise of the meeting when we will see that body right we'll see him in his flesh in the meeting in the air I'm looking forward to that meeting hallelujah are you I'm looking forward to see him in there oh there's my lovely Lord Jesus probably hallelujah I've been waiting for this moment how look at me look forward to this moment I'm in the same screwed that's here among us we'll take us up hallelujah take us up amen so now but how do we know him now we know him by his word when it's manifested that's how we know him when God manifests his word that's him right brother Brad said and I've I've heard of leaving but now I see thee it's when you when you see God manifested you see him right where whatever God is veiled behind that you seeing godlike jobs saw him in a whirlwind right God is not the woman but he has veiled in the whirlwind right so when God manifests his word that's when we see him and that's how we know him by his word being manifested right so you say well what does this got to do with you say well how's this so Paul said that Jesus when when he was writing his epistles he said in one place that Jesus Christ has preached unto you right so they knew him by the preaching of the word amen right and so that and it wasn't just word only but God came and manifested proved that this was him right so now this message this message is God manifested right this is Jesus Christ making himself known right so we know him right we don't know him after the flesh right because we went back there we're here in this day we know him by his word being manifested everyone Allu you right that's how we know him and that's how we should also know one another as we shouldn't be caught up and because we're always going to have this thing right this thing disappoints not only ourselves but each other right well you know we you know we rub and we are why'd they say this why they mean listen do they mean listen you know how so you know and we get because it's it's this progress is this sticky nature and we'll always have this thing until it's change right but we should be able to look beyond this look beyond the veil and say this part of God this part of God this part of God this part of God this part of God what there's part of the bride they're all part of the bride right we should rather look beyond this veil and so I can see God I mean that's why I said in first Corinthians 11 they weren't discerning the Lord's body where God was where God is so now these these people that gave themselves to David they weren't looking just at a man they are looking at prophecy being fulfilled they're looking at a vindication prophet anointing a vessel saying you will become king you are king of Israel they're looking at that now looking at that above all other things right they weren't looking at David stature or maybe how he carried himself they knew he was coming into power they knew he was going to become King and that's why they gathered themselves to him right they knew his coming into power now we know David as I said David was actually prophesied to come since in Genesis 49 and 10 the scepter shall not depart from Judah nor a lawgiver from between his feet until Shiloh shiloh come and unto him shall the gathering of his people be Shiloh is an attribute of the Messiah King when Messiah comes I mean so he's saying that the scepter shall not depart from Judah there shall be a king a kingship will continue through Judah even and even in the Lord Deuteronomy chapter 17 there's laws of what Kings should and shouldn't do I mean so they knew Moses was telling the people well God was speaking through Moses you're gonna have a king right you are going to have a king he says and I'll just read two verses Deuteronomy 17 14 and 15 we're now are coming to the land which the LORD thy God giveth thee and shall possess it and shall dwell therein and shall say I will see it a king over me like as all the nations that are round about me thou shall in any way set him king over thee whom the Lord thy God shall choose one from among thy brethren shall set king over thee thou mayst not set a stranger over the which is not thy brother oh oh yeah Saul was man's choice David was God's choice right so he was prophesied to come hallelujah now David as I said he was transformed from a shepherd boy into a king now all believers have in the inner man a dormant seed of predestination right it is sitting there but it takes a life to come - to - to bring it to life right just like a natural seed you can have it in a bag on the shelf or you can sit there but when you put it in the right soil you put give the right water the right sunlight whatever life comes out the life that's in it comes forth it goes through a transformation now as I said the bride is also prophesied through the Bible just like david was prophesied became the bride is all through the bible so many prophecies are pointing to you pointing to your day hallelujah and she is also going through a transformation now a person you say naturally also a person goes through a transformation right you take even a little baby and there must be an adult right you take you take you you know yo someone can be just 2 or 3 cells and a mother's womb and there mister be an adult right in the muster be fully functional as an adult but they had to go through a transformation but the life that's in them their DNA has to be expressed and it makes cells and grows and grows and grows and then they're born then eventually you know they get bigger and they can begin to you know when they first start off in life they they get afraid with that you know they scratch themselves they get scared they don't even realize these things are attached right but then it comes to the process of time right and it growth and a maturity then these things become very useful now I was thinking of a you know you take a brain surgeon and I'll say we'll say brother and Nene very specialized person or a very specialized job now those hands that they start with before they go on to training know you take a brain surgeon someone who says I want to be a brain surgeon but never been spent a day in school in their life would you trust them taking your skull off and rearranging things but then in the process of time with the right teaching the right training those same hands that you would never trust you give your life to right because that person has gone through a transformation right they've gone through a transformation but it all begins now it all begins with ambition you know what do you want to be when you grow up I'm still working on that one but some people from very young age I want to be this I want to be this and they just go become it right God put an ambition in you a deep calling to the deep right but so it begins with that but then you got to have the right text books right if a surgeon is learning from medical literature from a hundred years ago same procedures now they don't do back then because it's been refined right so you'd have the right textbooks and they have to become open right and in order for it really to become open you've got to have the right teachers I mean you gotta have the right teachers and then that that is written becomes manifested in the student so what's in the textbook as just words on paper becomes flesh I mean it puts on flesh right and then that produces the transformation now it's exactly the same thing right the word when the wood comes open to you I mean the word becomes open to the bride by the voice of the seventh angel amen and the same spirit that was upon him to preach the mysteries of the of the gospel this two to finish up the mystery of God amen comes upon you right and he that is anointed to preach the contents of the open book amen then that same spirit comes upon you and it quickens that word that you hear I mean and that the the the title deed everything that's everything that Adam lost becomes material in your life everything Adam lost the bride has been restored back to hey you following what I'm saying because it's season you know we can go to we can go to Isaiah 29 he says stay yourselves and wonder this is Isaiah 29 9 to 14 stay yourselves and wonder cry ye out and cry yet drunken but not with wine they stagger but not with strong drink for the Lord hath poured out upon you the spirit of deep sleep and it's closed your eyes the prophets and your rulers the seers had he covered now we're coming to a stage where Israel's eyes are coming open and as their eyes are coming open the gentle eyes are being blinded just like it was in the beginning when the Gospels first went out the Jews eyes were being blinded and the gentle eyes were coming open right and the vision but we're not anointed with this anointing right the bride is not anointed with a anointing a spirit of deep sleep and slumber and our eyes are closed that's not you know this Bible is not close to us it's not sealed up it's been opened up I mean in the vision of all of this become unto you as a book and the vision of all this became unto you as a book I mean as the words of a book that is sealed which mean deliver one that is learned saying read this I pray thee saith I cannot for it sealed and the book is delivered to him that has not learned saying read this I pray then he saith I'm not learned wherefore the Lord said for as much as this people draw near me with their mouths and with their lips too they honor me but have removed their heart far from me I'm glad we are not that way I mean that's why it's got to be more than lip service your life will prove what your what's in your heart I'm it's just like people say it doesn't matter how we dress though how you dress as a manifestation of what's in you right legion was naked insane demon-possessed in the tombs what he was wearing or not wearing was a manifestation of the Spirit in him and then when that spirit was driven out of him he has found closed in his right mind at the feet of Jesus therefore amen and their lips say honor me and have removed their heart far from me and their fear towards me as taught by the precept of men therefore behold I'll proceed to do a wondrous myrrh work among this people such a marvelous work and a wonder for the wisdom of their wise men shall perish and the understanding of the prudent men shall be hid as how does it become sealed but now for the bride that is not the case the word has come oh you know this the Bible has to become a new book to you rights become more than just stories in history and and think it's going to become a Living Word right it's been it has to become a love leader all right it's going to become a love leader where you're in relationship with the one who wrote it amen and so now as the book has come open now in the same anointing that was on the seventh angel which is the mighty angel himself Christ anoints you and then it manifests everything that was preached becomes living in you winner-winner pertains to the bride hallelujah and you are built so the word then puts on flesh and builds you into the living image of the Lord Jesus amen that's why what is the message this is the message it's Jesus Christ in a people amen it's Christ in you the hope of glory and then how that life manifests out of a people hallelujah now Paul the Apostle Paul says in Hebrews six and one I'm just gonna hope you don't mind the when the reader was laying out a few more things therefore leaving the principles of the doctrine of Christ yes let us go unto perfection not laying in the foundation of repentance from dead works and of faith towards God of the doctrines of baptisms and of laying out of hands of the resurrection of the Dead and of eternal judgment and this we do if God permit now he's not saying forsake the principles of the doctrine he's not saying throw it away he's saying let's go on let's go from here and it's built right that's what he saying he's not saying forsake it I mean we need the principles of doctrine of Christ we saying let's go on from here right and that's why we've got to go on from most things what is the profit what does God said in this day right we should look into it we should listen to it I mean where if God has added his voice upon the earth to make you into his very image I would I would beli that very highly I mean this is in Hebrews five and thirteen he says for everyone that uses milk is unskillful in the word of righteousness for he is a babe but strong meat belongeth to them that are of full age even those who by reason of use have their senses exercised to discern both good and evil I mean so we want to be I believe we're full age right I believe I believe in for now young people can take the fullness of the of the word of who Jesus is right we don't just eat sure they'll be milking every service but we should have the meat too I like a fool you know it's like of people you know they were well I didn't this is was there are people at university flatting and all they lived on was was rice and potatoes cuz it's cheap they got scurvy they got scurvy why because they've never balance diet right they'll come a time a baby lives on milk but then it comes at humber a baby needs more than milk right it's it's its life its body is calling for more than milk I need more than and it's the same thing with us friends we can't just live on rice and potatoes we can't just live on the milk of the word we need the we need the full meat I mean we need the full course we need all the word hallelujah I say we shouldn't be afraid to look at anything or preach from anywhere in the message Amen so but strong meat belongeth to them that are full age even those who by reason of use so those who have the strong meat so by the reason of youth they have their senses exercised to discern both good and evil amen you eat a full course meal you'll be able to zoom between good and evil right oh yeah now I want to go back to David's mighty men as I as I've said they did not start off if one's read the story right one killed jump into a but you know as a lineman and killed the lion one killed a few hundred men and you know they did exploits they did great exploits and it wasn't Hollywood it's not a choreographed battle sync I mean they were just they just went in there and they you know like Samson with the jawbone oh but the reason was that's why they look beyond David yesterday they saw this man is going to become king the the prophecy that was placed on his life he will become king it doesn't matter how dark it looks it doesn't matter how much on the runway oh it doesn't matter how bad things may be he is going to become king knew he was coming into power right and that same anointing that was upon David look at David he's a shepherd boy but it wants to be king he comes he comes aligning into his Dominion well you know what's gonna happen David one lion zero right and he comes a beer he's King he's still king of the Sheep king of the Sheep he comes a beer a bigger enemy you know what's going to happen like David to Lyman br0 right he comes Goliath do you know where they fight they're in Judah you know their battles and Judah who's David's from Judah it comes a man living in his inheritance he's living in us as inheritance he's anointed me to become king of this land and he comes an uncircumcised Philistine saying bring me a man and that both fell on the wrong mans he is that day hallelujah and now they square off Goliath belittles David what am i dog you can't chase me with stones and sticks and whatever more I'll feed you to the birds and David said I've come you've come with your spear and whatever you have I come name a little god of hosts of Israel and he's staying there and hearth in his inheritance and we know what's going to happen David three the devil 0 listen this is our inheritance right this word that's become open as our inheritance oh I mean everything in Christ belongs to you everything that's why the message opens this I mean that you'll see this is who this who the Lord is he's the Lord God Almighty he's not a third person not a second person he's the Lord God Almighty and then he sees that this is what the bride is your joint is with me right what I am you become I mean so I conquer death the last I mean at the sound of the last Trump death shall be swallowed up in victory I mean so even death will be swallowed up in victory hallelujah as he conquered death to our people will conquer death as well I mean that's why all sickness must give way you know the name of Jesus Christ is the true where the true interpretation of the word is manifest that that is the manifestation of the name of Jesus holy that's why now here you are it's more than just saying Jesus Jesus Jesus multitude say the name there's no life backing up there what they say right so where the true word is that's where Jesus is that's why we gather of them because we gather around with the true word is he is the word he's a person holy that's why gates of hell give way to the name of Jesus Christ give way to the living manifestation of the name of Jesus Christ hallelujah David walking in his inheritance every enemy must go walking just walk in the word it's your inheritance doesn't matter what enemy comes along and the battle may be sure that may be long who's gonna win you one devil zero I've seen the scoreboard have you read the scoreboard have you read the final school you say you say this thing's rigged of course it's rigged God's pre dismay at the end hallelujah this is rigged we don't need to worry you will have the victory you will have the victory it doesn't matter the Bride of Christ is not does not come sick in place to the devil's argument right just like I read a few Sundays ago in John 8 Jesus is speaking and the scribes and Pharisees say your record is not true and Jesus said in your law to a witnesses he says I say something and the father comes in and says it so jesus said something in Jesus not me to do it the work sister it's the father in me he doeth the works so jesus said something I think God came in the spirit of the father came and manifested just like the crippled man Jesus said yo yo yo yos friends take the roof off lower him down Jesus says license be forgiven thee and then and then they're all criticizing him how dare he say that it easier for me to say that but you all know I said take up your bed and walk as a manifestation as a proof that is since were forgiving right so we'll just him making an idle boast God came supernatural power of God came in to prove what he was saved hallelujah the Apostle Paul said I don't come with word only they you add that your confidence would be in man's wisdom our confidence is not in man's wisdom but spare demonstration of the Holy Ghost I mean that God says this is my word this is me this is me this is me hallelujah shouldn't we have confidence in that if God you know because when God takes a witness stage he's listened to the trial messages you should go listen to him go listen to the one in 1964 brother baron speaks about the bridge he speaks about the ohio river so you've had different testimonies then God comes in against the call people out God is saying I am happy to be identified with this man's witness you say well I don't know about it well God said God said I'm gonna God said I agree with what he said I'm testifying on his behalf now what do you do with it what are you doing this what do you do with that yeah think about it if God said this is me well that's him Moses comes down into Egypt let my people go Pharisees who who's gonna let him go bassy is God now you come on you just do what I told you do throw the stuff down have Aaron throw the stuff down turn the water into blood whatever more God stepped in and said because when Moses said let my people go they were God's people God was speaking through Moses doesn't matter what fair I was doing God came and said no this is me that's the most important thing I mean that's the most important thing when God says this is me that's why it goes beyond debate I mean God vindicates his word that's if he doesn't then all we have his argument and how did the head of the church start silver and gold have our numbers such as I had give ID what they what they said they received they proved it right there on the day of Pentecost now they didn't just sit around for ten days and say well let's act excited and jump out and say this is that no God came down and God said this is that and then it was proven it was that and then and then God came in behind it uh you know the your the scribes and Pharisees put pressure on don't preach in his name anymore don't do these things it's now an argument this is intimidation the devil intimidates you bullies don't do this anymore don't believe these things there's nothing to it and you can actually they could have stood there and said to yo mister car versus mr. high priest what do you have to give me what do you have well we have tradition what is your tradition do you're stuck here under the Dominion of the Romans that you want to overthrow you don't have your land you just have your dead traditions of man you look at what people are selling and then so God came in and backed up the disciples right Paul goes into a place God comes in behind and confirms what he says that's how you know he's true yeah and if the gospel started their way or tool in that way how lujah they david's mighty men the same anointing that was on david came upon them right they knew he was coming into power their brother Brahim sees us in marriage and divorce oh well I just say this first I trust you see this anointed word that we've received which is Jesus you know one day he'll sit on the throne of David in the Millennium right I trusted something and you saying I know he's get Lord I know you're coming into power I know you'll be there in the Millennium doesn't matter what goes on around among us I know you may be rejected you may be despised you may be hated you may be ridiculed I know you're coming into power he says now we find today that the church character Satan and his group look after look after big beautiful churches beautiful things that's what the world looks at today oh it's the past of the great so and so time so and so so priestly godly walking up these fine big robes things like that they call that beauty but the real saints of God looked for the character of the vindicated word that's what the Saints did in that day when they seen Jesus he wasn't nothing to look at but they seemed god was in him they think God was with them that's what that's how those Joe had those characters with David a little old fellow they seen they seen the man was in him they seen that God was in him they knowed he was coming into power some day one slew other five brothers of glass' single-handed one killed 300 men and some women were picking up beans for dinner an army had gone away he took up a spear killed 300 men Philistines he said character way they stayed right by David they know the anointing was upon him they knowed he was coming into power he says a pure picture of the church today that will stand by the word we know it's going to be made vindicated we know it's coming into power someday he says although he was a fugitive from the rest of the nations but they knowed he was coming into power we know he's coming into power too so we take that word and stand right there no matter what it costs if we have to cut Philistines or jump into a pit and kill a lion as wondered we go anyhow cause it's that's the way God designed it to be we look for character we look for the life of God being produced right and now the character of the word is what we look for and that's what we've seen right you take a true believer you see Jesus's character you see Jesus is nature why is that because they've seen a word is coming this day which is Jesus Christ and they know he's coming into power and anointing is come upon them because we're looking for we've seen his character hallelujah now now he see it's here in Ephesians 3:16 well I've just got 16 to 19 he says that he would grant you according to the riches of his glory to be strengthened with the might by his spirit in the inner man that Christ may dwell in your hearts by faith that ye being rooted and grounded in love may be able to comprehend with All Saints what is the breadth and the length and the depth and the height and to know the love of God which passes knowledge that ye may be filled with all the fullness of God this is what there's what Paul was you know it was desiring God would grant us this right so in the inner man Christ would dwell in us hallelujah so now when God so there's as so as I see it as a natural person right our natural bodies we go from a little well to cells and we go into a fully-fledged at all right so we as spiritual people we go from a babe in Christ and we mature we grow right until we are transformed our inner man oh I'll just use my terms the inner man it comes into his image right so we go from a baby then we grow into a fool me fully mature image of Jesus Christ now brother BAM says this and you know in the communion message he says I was saying this taking for myself like you was going to say William Brennan well 40 years ago william branham it isn't the same one tonight if somebody back there would say william branham he's a ranked rascal see because I was born of Charles and Ella Branham and innate and in their nature I was a sinner I come to the world a liar and all the habits of the world lay right in but down in there too was another nature presence he predestinated was in there by God and the same body see two natures in there well I only catered to one and as it grows I good as a baby Dada first thing you know I became a liar became everything else that's a sinner because I was raised up that way so he's catering to his first nature right but down in there was a little speck of life all the time I used to remember as a little boy he says I hope I'm not holding you too long but sitting out there on the creek bank and I'd sit there and look around at nighttime mom and pop they had gone on now to the arrest and them days they were sinners there was no Christianity in our home at all and oh my drinking parties and carrying on it made me sick I take my lantern of my dog and go through the woods stay all night and the wintertime I'd hunt till the party was over maybe daylight in the morning come home wouldn't be over I'd lay on the top of the shed and sleep waiting for daylight to break then I then I think of how that times then being out there in the summer time get my sticks and put put them down for a little wooden break a where a train laid there and having the pole sticking the water fishing my old dog laying there I'd say looking here you know last winter I camped right here one night I built a fire right here when I was waiting for my old dog here to tree and I had a fire here it was froze five inches deep in the ground but little flower where'd you come from see well where did you come from who come here and planted you and that hot house did they bring you out or where'd you come from see that little flower I'd say why it was froze and everything and I built a fire on top of here besides the freezing element there was the heat element laying here on the cold a big old log where I burned you and yet here you are you're alive where'd you come from what was it there was another william branham see a little spot of eternal life down there from the genes of God the Word of God that was planted in there each one of you can think of similar things see it was working then look up to the trees and I think leaf I seen you fall off last year and why are you back there again where'd you come from what what you hear see it was eternal life working in the body I mean when you begin to think about this more than this life and what happens next that's eternal life working I mean now then one day as I walked on that voice talking don't ever smoke drink and so forth and the young fellows and all got older seed there was something moving but yet all at once I looked up I said I'm not the son of charles nella Browne and there's something calling like my little eagle I'm not a chicken there's something up yonder somewhere our great Jehovah whoever you are open up I want to come home there's something in me calling then I was born again that little life was laying there the the life of water was poured upon it and it began to grow now that old life was forgiven put in God's see if God's forgetfulness never to be remembered against we no more see now we stand justified as though we'd never sinned in the presence of God Allu you I trust as the same with you Amen now we are being built we are going from glory to glory I trust you are I trust you look back and say what I was a year ago I'm not the same one I've been grind more into his image I see more of his character more of his life and me hallelujah now as I said David didn't start off as a ship I mean he didn't start off as a king he started off as a shepherd boy but because there was the life that that seed of a king in him he had to become that King I mean because he was anointed by the Prophet he walked according to that prophecy that's what we must do Allu you now I want to kind of see grab it into into something else now we David remember David went through a lot of hard times in his life and God had to had to do that because we needed the Book of Psalms right we needed the Book of Psalms who's been comforted by the Book of Psalms right he had to go through those tight places and those you know he had to cuz the Book of Psalms had to be expressed and many times we go through things in life it's actually for someone else well it is for us to cuz Davis character was developed right through the trial but he didn't know we would read those things you know he didn't say this is going to go into every language and whatever more and God's children down through the ages gonna read this and be confident he didn't realize right but he had to go through those things that the Book of Psalms would be written hallelujah that we could be beneficially you know you know God allows situations for his life to be expressed that's what the devil I don't underst he doesn't even understand himself you know if the devil just lifts us alone God wouldn't even be expressed you think about it if David was just left alone we'd never have the book of Psalms you know we'd never have it it would just been but you know the devil he all remember the devil's just at all he's just a tool in God's hand for your benefit right he has nothing over God he's God gives him boundaries he tries to push against like a being an invisible cube or whatever you want to call it but he can't go beyond it right and so now we we have to remember that everything is working for our good and it's working that Christ would be expressed not you be expressed Jesus Christ would be expressed out of your life right now here we are for all but see David David kept his focus I'm gonna be king right this is what he he knew what it was like maybe he'd been anointed with the world before I don't know but the Spirit of God was with him from that day forward that what made the event very special right that was really kept off the whole of it and he kept that before him Lord you've made me king and in your season I will become king I don't need to kill Saul I don't need to work out some deal to get rid of him and have a cool aroma died or God put him there God to remove him then old when I'm ready I'll be there so he had confidence now and the prophecy that had been spoken over him by vindicated prophet now we this this this message is a message of transformation right and the ultimate transformation is the change in the body right where where mortality is swallowed up in immortality right the last enemy the last Trump death is swallowed up in victory right so this is this is what this message is to do is to make us into the image of Jesus Christ the word right as is bright and then we take a body change then we go to streets ago okay we should keep that in front of us we should keep that real folk art yeah yeah I think we should keep that you know all the time Lord this is a rapture call I've heard the call something in me said yes and I just gave myself I just gave it all I just jumped you know you got to jump you can't just say well oh I'll have one foot here you know you can't have some safety line crawl out and when it gets bad I'll pull myself back in I mean you've got to you got to let go and let God you got a fully surrender what's going to happen he'll change you you got to really die before you can be born again right and so now he says here that this is all things for your sakes that the abundance abundant grace they mean through might through the Thanksgiving of many a rear bear a readout of the glory of God for which cause we faint not for the outward man perish yet the inward man is renewed day by day for our light affliction is but for a moment worketh for us a far more exceeding eternal weight of glory while we look not at the things which are seen David did look at the things that are seen he looked at the unseen he looked at the promise right but the things which are not seen so while we sorry while we look not of the things which are seen but things which are not seen for the things which are seen a temporal but the things which are not seen are eternal so he says the slider fly see that's just a light affliction here's the man who went through a lot of hardship right he says just a light affliction right but it has a far more eternal weight but it is just for a moment worketh for us a far more exceeding eternal weight of glory so it's working for you okay now I just want you to think about those the prophets of old you imagine you imagine receiving a prophecy but I just read Rome from from Ezekiel Ezekiel 36 I'll take you from the heathen and gather you out of all countries and I'll bring you into your own land then will I sprinkle clean water upon you you shall be clean from all your filthiness and from all your idols will I cleanse you and you heart also will I give you and a new spirit will I put within you and I'll take away the stony heart out of your flesh and I'll give you a heart of flesh and I will put my spirit within you and cause you to walk in my statutes and you shall keep my judgments and do them so here's here's Ezekiel he's living in Babylon and God speaks to him us he would no doubt begin to think Lord when is this going to happen and he would pray Lord I want to see this I want to see this happen I want to you know when are you gonna gather us into our own land and do this and and put your spirit within us that we would keep your statutes walking them and do them you know the prophets prophesied of the grace that should come unto us yes I'm in the salvation he says in 1st Peter 1 it says of which salvation the prophets have been quiet and searched diligently who prophesied of the grace that you come unto you right searching what or what manner of time the Spirit of Christ which is in them did signify when it testified beforehand the sufferings of Christ and the glory that should follow and to whom it was revealed that not answered themselves but unto us they'd administer the things which are now reported unto you by them that have preached the gospel unto you with the Holy Ghost sent down from heaven which things the angels desire to look into so the prophets when they're prophesied these things they were looking when is it going to happen it was a longing in them when's it going to happen David was a peculiar man as the heart panas for the water Brooks so my soul longs after thee I mean he had such a burden Lord I what I need more and we should ever longing right but he was living under the blood of bulls and goats there was not a blood there they could actually release the Spirit of God into him not just anointed but to be into him to satisfy his desire right because if the blood of bulls and goats did it why did Jesus need to die right so he was head of head along it as I as the hot pennant for the water book so my soul longs after thee oh you're my soul longs for the Living God how I longed and so he had such a burden it's such a desire Lord I want to I want to come into the secret of my tabernacle you know I was looking for looking for that time Ezekiel was you know no doubt he was stirred up Lord when will you fulfill this prophecy I want to see it fulfilled no I just want to ask you a question well now we're on streets ago just imagine the raptures happened we're on streets of gold so eternal youth camp we're all 18 to 21 alright and we began their fellowship and you begin to see you know remember the prophets wanted your day they would give any onion I don't know how it would have been but just so if there's an option I'll give two arms two legs on the beginning you know they would want to be in your day wouldn't you want to be in this day we look at the wrong thing too much and then no doubt you know you know maybe bumming to Ezekiel and and and and and you would ask you oh he's a prophet Ezekiel or you see the Lord is aware within the we'll come down and all those Isles in that one you know and and and he would tell you about his day we're in captivity way to burden him even though rusty oh yeah because Ezekiel this isn't Ezekiel that God said though these people that come and sit among you they've got idols in their hearts right they don't worship God according to truth they have idols in the heart set you know that and so he would have a burden but Lord you said that I will put my spirit within you and then you'll walk they'll walkin according to your statutes and they will keep your judgments you say when is this going to happen and so and so then David would come along no doubt and then you to others as King David what was it like to face Goliath and you all these things you know and they were cheer and you know be a wonderful and you'd have a jubilee with them and you dance around for a few thousand years and holier what was it like for the ark to come in and your day Yahoo does I'll show you I was like holy yeah but then that ask you now so where did you come from and they say oh they do see ya they do see ya what was it like well and this is how some of us really are it was the darkest of times as perilous times the Bible said it was perilous there be lovers of pleasure more than lovers of God false you know trucebreakers you know in content despisers of those that are good trading traitors heady highminded lovers of police among lovers of god having a form of godliness but denying the power they're all from such turn away it was very dark age nothing was right nothing was wrong it was all gray the whole of society was against me you know such a pressure in the and the bombardment of the enemy when I walk out my door and you know but they said no what was it like I'm trying to tell you what was like it was very dark and this all happened no member here his people in the desire was never made in this life what was it like to have God live in you what was it like to be the Living Tabernacle Living God where it wasn't just my heart longs for you but the expectation was met I mean with God came and dwelt in you we'll just under the blood of bulls and goats I mean being anointed one time but God comes and dwells hallelujah what was that like Holly well as that night we were lighting for that day we had a burnin love Wayne will you restore your people when we come and dwell in your people and then will you give back everything Adam loss will be restored Holly you think Adam would have been like you would have talked to him what's it like to walk out the garden I think and then he says where did you come from what was it like to walk back in hallelujah what was like to walk back into eternity what was like to receive everything I lost oh I could command every there's a tree move here move here do this but then I see her a few days later I see the same words who didn't do anything and the enemy was oppressing us and I told my descendants what it was like and this is then men begin to call upon the name of the Lord because they will say Lord when are we going back hallelujah and then here you were Oh Lord we look at the wrong thing they think you think David would be excited in a meeting like this you think they would have been excited being Bing in your pew amen he was hearing a longing where maula alone I longed for thee I want more than just what I have he couldn't live any higher than the blood of bulls and goats hallelujah amen do you think he'd get excited you think his cup what was life you'll cut the run over oh my didn't you think what was life for y'all cut the run over hallelujah when your expectation and what does expectation it wasn't met it was met hallelujah think about it they had along there to burden Lord winners it's going to be fulfilled imagine receiving the Apostle Paul comes along I mean but when he wrote to the Thessalonians they which are alive and remain they meant to the coming of the Lord he was writing you would have got that letter you know he go to the mailbox I'd know however it happened courier came along the Apostle Paul says this I'll show you a mystery we shall not all sleep but we shall be changed they mend another place they which are alive and remain tonight you know the Deen Christ will rise first all those different things they would have thought it was deep right and and it was them because they died right they were dead in Christ but they thought they were alive and remain and they and they died with an expectation and then here we are we don't just have an expectation we're gonna live the expectation but it's going to be fulfilled hallelujah we're going to live it out I mean without alerting Lord when is it gonna happen when's it gonna happen and we say it's happening it's happening it's happening hallelujah so what was it like to live in lady ICU it was the most glorious thing God came down dwell into people made him made them into his image made them living manifestations of his word not just in part but and fullness and God came and walked with me and he talked with me and he transformed me from glory to glory I wasn't looking at through tradition I wasn't looking through a man's ideas my eyes are unveiled my the veil came off my heart Holly we spoke his work to be and

judgments and do them right that is a prophecy of New Testament grace I mean that I'll put my spirit within them they will keep my statutes and I'll court and no they will walk in them and they'll keep my judgments and do them because of the Spirit of God within them the definition of New Testament grace is this right it means graciousness gratify manner of act abstract or concrete literal fricative or spiritual especially this is from the Strong's Concordance this is Grace when people talk about grace this is Bible grace it's not just God turning a blind eye to people this is Grace this is Grace especially the divine influence upon the heart and its reflection in the life Alleluia that's grace so when Ezekiel was saying when's it's going to happen it's happened to me hallelujah
