[34:27] naomi if she would
[34:29] come and sing as a special
[34:34] and it's just a a song that's blessed me
[34:38] and it goes with my thought
[34:41] this evening i believe it's the lord's
[34:44] thought
[34:47] and you know when you're worried your
[34:50] sermon's not going to be long enough
[34:51] it's always good to get someone to come
[34:53] and sing a song
[34:57] i'll just kidding
[35:04] god bless you um i was actually looking
[35:07] up the
[35:08] etymology i guess or the like the
[35:10] history of the song and
[35:13] just was really enjoying it because uh
[35:17] i didn't know it was this old it was
[35:18] like the 1850s when it was written it's
[35:20] a ham
[35:21] just a really old hymn and what i um
[35:25] i'll probably steal james's part of
[35:27] james's sermon but it's
[35:29] i didn't realize that it was a
[35:30] scriptural reference from
[35:32] malachi 3 verse 17 either so i thought
[35:35] that was really cool
[35:38] um i don't know how to use the keyboard
[35:41] though do i just unplug it
[35:46] do i just unplug it
[35:59] [Music]
[36:07] when he cometh
[36:10] when he comes
[36:14] to make up his jewels
[36:20] all his jewels precious to
[36:38] his bright crown a
[36:42] dawning they shall shine
[36:46] in their booty

[37:36] ground a dawning
[37:41] they shall shine in their
[37:45] beauty bright gems
[37:49] [Music]
[38:01] little children little
[38:05] children who love their
[38:10] reading they are the jewels
[38:15] precious to his left
[38:20] and his own
[38:24] like the stars of
[38:27] the morning his bright crown
[38:33] a dawning
[38:36] they shall shine in their
[38:40] beauty bridge of his crown
[38:47] they shall shine in their
[38:51] beauty bright gems
[38:56] of his ground
[39:04] [Applause]
[39:10] amen that's what you are
[39:13] his jewels and this message has been on
[39:16] my heart
[39:17] for quite a while and it's just been
[39:20] brewing
[39:21] brother ben could i have the slideshow
[39:24] thinking i forgot it sorry
[39:26] and so this thoughts just brewed and
[39:29] i've just not really known where to take
[39:30] it because it's such a simple
[39:33] thought i thought you know like
[39:36] sometimes we expect we're just gonna
[39:37] come here and really
[39:39] dig real deep into the word and dig up
[39:41] some deep revelation but
[39:43] i just feel to go with what the lord
[39:45] showed me and i believe it's him that
[39:46] wants to speak to us tonight and
[39:49] i just say it's for me help me see you
[39:52] as jewels
[39:54] amen so if you stand while we read the
[39:56] word of god
[39:57] and we're just gonna read first john
[40:00] chapter four
[40:08] chapter four verse seven
[40:13] and all my scriptures are up there
[40:14] tonight so i can read it up there
[40:23] beloved let us love one another
[40:26] for love is of god and everyone that
[40:29] loveth
[40:30] is born of god and knoweth god he that
[40:33] loveth
[40:34] not knoweth not god for god is love and
[40:37] this was manifested the love of god
[40:39] toward us because that god sent his only
[40:41] begotten son into the world
[40:43] that we might live through him herein is
[40:46] love
[40:46] not that we loved god but that he loved
[40:49] us
[40:49] and sent his son to be the propitiation
[40:52] for our sins
[40:53] beloved if god so loved us we ought to
[40:56] love one another
[40:58] and then we're just going to go to verse
[41:00] 20.
[41:02] if a man say i love god and hateth his
[41:04] brother he is a liar
[41:06] for he that loveth not his brother whom
[41:08] he hath seen
[41:09] how can he love god whom he hath not
[41:12] seen
[41:13] and this commandment have we from him
[41:15] that he who loveth god loveth his
[41:17] brother also
[41:19] amen and i just want to read that
[41:22] scripture naomi
[41:24] did speak that scripture but that's good
[41:27] malachi 3 verse 17 and it's up there
[41:31] and they shall be mine saith the lord of
[41:33] hosts in that day when i make up my
[41:35] jewels
[41:35] i will spare them as a man spirit his
[41:38] own son that serveth them
[41:40] amen may the lord bless the reading of
[41:42] his word and you could take your seats
[41:46] so i just want to speak about how
[41:48] precious you are
[41:50] and not just how precious you are but
[41:52] how precious we see others
[41:54] because that's the burden of my heart
[41:56] that's what the lord's really
[41:58] changed in me over the last few years is
[42:00] how i see other people
[42:02] and i think that's so important for us
[42:05] because
[42:06] when i look at you and i see your flesh
[42:09] all i'm really seeing is something
[42:10] that's
[42:11] corrupt like it can't it just it's going
[42:14] to pass it's going to fade away as it's
[42:16] broken
[42:17] and but there's something behind that
[42:19] flesh that's precious
[42:21] and i want to be able to look through
[42:23] that flesh no matter what i
[42:25] see and before me i want to be able to
[42:29] look
[42:29] through that flesh amen
[42:32] because when the lord looks he doesn't
[42:35] see
[42:36] he doesn't see you as what you are now
[42:38] he sees you as what you will
[42:40] were before the world began amen
[42:44] and i know i'm really coming in on the
[42:46] back of
[42:47] brother amman's and brother ben's
[42:49] message recent messages when brother
[42:50] amman preached last wednesday i was like
[42:52] mate i i pretty much just gave him my
[42:55] notes is what i felt like
[42:57] but i thought you know me and amanda's
[42:59] so different i mean like
[43:01] he you know i thought there's no way i'm
[43:04] going to say it the same way he does so
[43:07] praise god you know we're in the channel
[43:10] but i want to find i want to get to a
[43:12] place where i can have divine love for
[43:13] you no matter what no matter what the
[43:15] problem problems that come up you know
[43:19] brother branham talks about having that
[43:21] divine love because
[43:23] that divine love when it's projected
[43:26] then
[43:27] sovereign grace steps in so
[43:30] when a situation comes up i just thought
[43:33] about this last night just to really
[43:35] dramatize it to sort of
[43:36] point this out just say tonight someone
[43:39] walked in they seen the sign they walked
[43:41] in off the street
[43:42] i'm like i want to go to service
[43:43] shekinah tabernacle when they walked in
[43:45] and it's a transgender right and it's a
[43:48] man wearing a dress and high heels
[43:50] i'm not saying this to be silly but
[43:51] because we see this just
[43:53] outside but they come to church because
[43:55] something's pulled them in they want to
[43:57] come in
[43:58] now
[44:01] what's the initial thoughts that come up
[44:03] you know how do
[44:04] how do we treat them at site well you
[44:07] know they say i want them i want to be a
[44:08] christian
[44:09] and come i mean i want to be a christian
[44:11] well you know
[44:12] i should probably take the dress off and
[44:14] you know put some pants on and maybe
[44:16] next time you come
[44:18] you know but that's our natural way to
[44:20] think of how to deal with a situation
[44:23] but what brother branham was saying with
[44:24] divine love when divine loves projecting
[44:27] god bless you it's so nice that you'd
[44:28] come to our service and
[44:30] what's your name tell me your story you
[44:32] know what you know what brought you
[44:34] to come here because once we can project
[44:36] divine love to them
[44:38] then sovereign grace comes in on the
[44:40] other side and
[44:41] situations start to be dealing with but
[44:43] if i just look at them and go
[44:45] i can't deal with this you know there's
[44:48] something with me then that needs to be
[44:49] dealt with
[44:52] amen and you know
[44:55] everyone that's here tonight is here
[44:57] because there's something that's pulled
[44:59] you here
[45:00] there's something even just naturally
[45:02] you know
[45:03] maybe you're different maybe you're more
[45:05] of an angel than me but i get home
[45:08] after work you know it's late and you
[45:10] rushed home and
[45:12] i really would rather just you know like
[45:13] stay on the couch
[45:15] like it's quite hard to like you know it
[45:17] actually takes
[45:19] encouragement to make myself come but
[45:21] there's something that's pulling me
[45:22] there's something that goes you know i
[45:23] want to be in church
[45:24] i want to come you know like there's
[45:26] something that's pulling
[45:28] even when i actually don't really want
[45:30] to come he looks i'm tired
[45:33] if you know what i mean but there's
[45:34] something that has to pull you
[45:37] amen there's got to be a longing
[45:41] and so if the person next to you has got
[45:43] the same longing that's pulling them
[45:46] amen is it the same longing that's
[45:48] pulling you
[45:49] you could be miles apart both in your
[45:51] spiritual walk
[45:53] naturally whatever they could be still
[45:54] living in sin but there's something
[45:56] pulling them it's the same force it's
[45:57] pulling you
[45:59] then how could we say one was greater
[46:00] than the other
[46:03] amen i like that
[46:07] song that brother isaac wrote i heard an
[46:09] eagles cry
[46:11] amen that's what i heard told me
[46:14] something about myself it told me i
[46:16] could come up higher
[46:17] yeah amen so
[46:21] you know i just
[46:24] that when i i used to be this way right
[46:28] have i seen something wrong i'd just
[46:29] take on that pharisee spirit straight
[46:31] away and i'd be
[46:32] that for transgender you know it was a
[46:35] really hard thing for me
[46:37] to overcome was seeing sin and not
[46:40] calling it sin
[46:43] god has to deal with me maybe he'll deal
[46:45] with someone else but
[46:46] you know it's just finding that divine
[46:49] love and then projecting it and letting
[46:50] god deal with the situation amen because
[46:53] we're just a sinner you know
[46:55] there's nothing that i can do in my own
[46:56] power to change that circumstance i can
[46:59] give advice
[47:00] but you know you can lead a horse to
[47:02] water but you can't
[47:03] make it drink as the expression says you
[47:05] have to say lord it's your child i nee
[47:08] you need to you need to help them amen
[47:13] you know many people come to church
[47:17] not saying like here but a lot of people
[47:19] will go to church so they want to be a
[47:21] christian because they want to be
[47:22] righteous you know they want to live a
[47:24] righteous life
[47:27] but you know you don't come here to be
[47:31] righteous you come
[47:32] when you come in here you just come and
[47:35] say lord here i am
[47:36] and then the righteousness comes later
[47:38] you know that the lord does that but
[47:39] there's none that's righteous but one
[47:41] right
[47:41] our lord jesus but many people want to
[47:44] be righteous but
[47:45] and just doing that well i'm just going
[47:46] to be good and i can make myself as good
[47:48] as i want if i've really got
[47:50] strong will if i've really got a strong
[47:52] will
[47:53] there'll be people out there that call
[47:54] themselves christians that don't even
[47:57] know god but live more righteous than
[47:58] you because they're so strong-willed to
[48:00] overcome
[48:02] you know it's not about that we've got
[48:04] to meet god and someone else has to meet
[48:06] god too
[48:09] you know the dove the dove doesn't have
[48:12] to go and find a washing machine to get
[48:14] clean
[48:15] because it's already got an oil inside
[48:17] it it's just got to recognize the oils
[48:20] there
[48:21] it's already inside it so when that tran
[48:23] say that transgender walks in it's a
[48:25] seed of god it's a genuine seed child of
[48:27] god
[48:28] the thing that's going to make it clean
[48:30] is walked in the door with it it's there
[48:33] amen we just need to nurture it nurture
[48:35] it let it come up and that oil will
[48:37] start to push the sun out
[48:39] it was funny a couple couple weeks ago i
[48:41] think andy was saying you know
[48:43] we've got to get so slippery so much oil
[48:45] so follow the holy ghost that we're too
[48:47] slippery for the devil to get a hold of
[48:48] because that oil is already inside you
[48:50] know
[48:51] amen let it come out
[48:55] amen you know sometimes
[48:58] we can see differently like or sometimes
[49:01] we look we're not we're not the same
[49:03] we're all
[49:04] you know brother ben says we're not a
[49:06] god's not a cookie cutter all different
[49:08] and if i could just say with brother
[49:10] impo because
[49:11] you're just here but we look different
[49:13] you know like we're different we're not
[49:15] the same people and god's made us that
[49:18] way for his purpose
[49:20] and you know brother info if he was if
[49:22] someone said brother impo show us how to
[49:24] dance
[49:25] and he you know he'd probably do
[49:27] something a bit different than
[49:29] i would do you know but he's dancing and
[49:31] if you said to me
[49:33] uh brother james you know dance and i'm
[49:35] like
[49:39] that's how i dance but we're both
[49:40] rejoicing you know and now i can't go
[49:42] man that brother of god that he's so on
[49:45] fire for god you know he's dancing in
[49:47] the spirit and
[49:48] but you know what's to say that other
[49:49] person that's dancing in their own way
[49:52] it's not serving god you know that's
[49:55] funny
[49:56] we'll quite often think well the closer
[49:58] someone sits to the front the closer
[49:59] they are to god
[50:01] but you can get someone you know i've
[50:04] seen people that i know have a
[50:07] strong heated something between them
[50:10] and one will sit close you know and and
[50:13] pretend that everything's all right
[50:15] when it's not all right and then someone
[50:17] will sit in the back reserved
[50:19] and you'll be thinking oh you know
[50:20] they're one step from the door but
[50:22] they're sitting there more righteous
[50:23] than someone else so like
[50:24] if you can see what i'm trying to say it
[50:27] it's we're all different
[50:28] and we've all got things to overcome
[50:30] we've all we're all at different stages
[50:33] but we need to be able to say that's the
[50:35] seat of god that's the seat of god
[50:36] that's a sea to god
[50:38] we're all seeds of god we're just at
[50:40] different stages
[50:41] it takes it takes love for us to do that
[50:44] because it's hard you know like
[50:46] there's been so much hurt amongst
[50:48] christians you know
[50:49] you say well man it's so good and the
[50:52] christianity you know they don't have
[50:54] these bad things happen and
[50:56] but there's broken people there's broken
[50:59] families you know
[51:00] and it burdens my heart to see people
[51:04] that are broken and the message you know
[51:06] especially when it's family and and
[51:08] they're in a church and they're in a
[51:09] church but they
[51:11] they struggle to connect because
[51:13] something's happened
[51:14] and i tell you that if we're going to go
[51:16] on a rapture we're going to have to get
[51:18] connected
[51:18] you know there's actually something
[51:20] that's got to to fit
[51:22] amen we've got a gel
[51:29] heavenly father they're jewels to your
[51:32] crown
[51:33] they could not come they could not have
[51:35] come lest something warm them
[51:37] and you said no man can come except my
[51:39] father draws
[51:41] and all that the father has given me
[51:43] will come
[51:44] and here they come by something telling
[51:46] them to come
[51:47] here it is here then you've started a
[51:51] work
[51:53] amen if they've come the lord's drawn
[51:54] them they've come into the church
[51:56] he started a work amen we can just say
[51:59] amen right there
[52:01] he started a work
[52:05] and i pray tonight that you'll finish it
[52:09] amen not you the lord will finish it he
[52:12] started the work
[52:13] he'll finish the word amen
[52:17] lord by making them sons and daughters
[52:19] of god granted
[52:21] may not one of them be lost that should
[52:24] be our part in it
[52:25] someone's come in the lord started them
[52:29] the lord started them on the journey now
[52:31] my heart should be
[52:33] lord you finish it may not one of them
[52:35] be lost
[52:36] not man they're wrong you know like well
[52:39] whatever the issue is or
[52:41] you know that's my side that's my part
[52:44] lord
[52:44] they need this they need this lord let
[52:47] me pray
[52:48] oh lord i love that brother i love that
[52:51] sister
[52:52] amen lord finish it amen
[52:56] that's the divine a divine love you know
[52:58] sincere love
[53:00] you know it goes beyond a friendship
[53:02] okay this is my friend this is my best
[53:04] friend you know
[53:05] but it goes beyond friendship it steps
[53:08] beyond
[53:09] it steps into a reality where i can meet
[53:11] someone god bless you brother
[53:13] i've never met you before you're from
[53:15] the other side of the world
[53:16] i love you brother there's just
[53:18] something that just
[53:20] it just connects you know like brother
[53:23] branham was saying when he went beyond
[53:25] the curtain of time and
[53:26] and those sisters were there and and and
[53:29] that one of them come up and
[53:30] they gave him a hug and he said there
[53:32] was just there was just no feeling it's
[53:34] just this divine love
[53:36] you know it's just this connection it's
[53:37] like we're so
[53:39] close that's the love i want to feel you
[53:43] know
[53:44] amen hallelujah
[53:50] you know brother ben preached a sermon a
[53:52] few weeks ago
[53:53] and he talked about killing one's
[53:55] character and man i just
[53:58] like it it just really spoke to me i was
[54:00] just like you know it's so true
[54:02] and i just was you know saying amen
[54:06] oh me amen oh me but
[54:10] you know like because it's so true it's
[54:12] just
[54:13] and i was thinking about it because i've
[54:15] seen we've just been through something
[54:17] with work
[54:18] and um for the last i don't know year or
[54:21] year and a half we've had a few people
[54:24] that have all
[54:24] just been it's just been a bad team you
[54:27] know there's been some bad seeds in
[54:28] there
[54:29] and what you know that one person begins
[54:33] to stir this one and then that one stirs
[54:34] this one and then
[54:35] end up with three people sort of
[54:37] conspiring against the
[54:39] higher authority and and you know and
[54:41] then they'll go and stir the higher
[54:43] authority against this one here and a
[54:45] project manager against
[54:46] an owner or foreman and just starts this
[54:50] horrible circle of
[54:52] of just basically hate
[54:55] you know and and it's just this big
[54:58] downward spiral
[54:59] and this machine that's supposed to work
[55:01] and be well oiled and fit together
[55:03] and so i've just seen this happen and in
[55:06] the end
[55:07] to solve the problem we basically
[55:10] the even though we were the foreman the
[55:12] manager the owner and a few of the ones
[55:14] that had a bit more
[55:16] in the running of the business we got
[55:17] together even though we were struggling
[55:19] with each other
[55:20] and we said there's a problem and the
[55:22] problem is that these people here are
[55:24] stirring us against each other
[55:26] we need to get rid of the problem we got
[55:27] rid of all these guys that were
[55:29] conspiring and since then there's been
[55:30] no problem
[55:32] and i thought you know that that can be
[55:34] so true because
[55:36] you know when you talk about killing
[55:38] someone's influence because
[55:40] well maybe some people aren't easily
[55:43] influenced but i am quite easily
[55:44] influenced
[55:45] you know but so when we start you can
[55:48] have someone saying
[55:49] this brother's that and they've done
[55:50] this to me and hurt me there and done
[55:52] this
[55:52] and all of a sudden yeah yeah you know
[55:55] like and you start to enter into the
[55:56] burden
[55:57] of that and then now this brother hasn't
[55:59] even hurt me they'll
[56:00] you know be my best mate all the time
[56:02] and now it's like i start getting
[56:04] negative about them but they you know
[56:06] and it's just
[56:07] so easy for this to spiral and then
[56:10] you know and then i say something and we
[56:12] end up with a situation i had at work
[56:14] you know
[56:14] and so so i i just really entered into
[56:18] that burden i thought lord
[56:20] help me to see everyone as jewels
[56:23] amen help me to just see beyond this
[56:27] see beyond me you know let me see jesus
[56:30] you know when i look at brother ben i
[56:32] want to say
[56:32] you know what i don't see brother being
[56:34] i see jesus amen when i see brother impo
[56:37] i see jesus
[56:38] amen when i see sister hannah i see
[56:40] jesus
[56:41] that's that's what i want to see
[56:45] amen jesus said when he starts something
[56:49] he's going to finish it
[56:52] amen you know
[56:56] sometimes we just need to rub up against
[56:58] each other and and just talk
[57:00] or just share you know
[57:03] um i was listening to brother branham
[57:06] and
[57:06] he was talking about the story about uh
[57:10] jack coy jet coy have you ever heard
[57:14] that story
[57:15] he was a guide on the indian reservation
[57:19] and he got lost and he was out there
[57:22] with his horse and they were dying
[57:23] they were days from dying and they just
[57:27] needed to find water
[57:29] and he he started to sense there was
[57:32] water down the bottom of this
[57:34] cliff face or something and and he
[57:36] thought i just need to get down there
[57:37] and
[57:38] he found a game trail going down he said
[57:40] if i just follow this game trail it will
[57:42] take me down to the water
[57:44] and so he got us got on his horse it was
[57:46] tired and weak
[57:47] and and tried to get it to go and the
[57:49] horse wouldn't go down there and so he
[57:50] started beating the horse and the horse
[57:52] was bleeding and the horse didn't want
[57:54] to go the horse wanted to go this way
[57:56] and he was just pondering it and he
[57:58] thought you know my horse has led me
[58:00] thus far it's always been there for me
[58:02] just like the holy spirit has for us and
[58:04] he said
[58:04] now the horse is wanting me to lead me
[58:06] to go this way so i'm just going to
[58:08] trust my horse
[58:09] so he got on his horse and the horse let
[58:11] him down and they found the water
[58:13] and they got on the water and they were
[58:15] rejoicing we found the water we're saved
[58:17] praise god we're saved and he was
[58:19] washing his horse's wound that he had
[58:21] heard it and
[58:22] just rejoicing and suddenly they heard a
[58:24] voice say
[58:25] come out of the water and so they come
[58:28] out of the water and right there there
[58:29] was a bunch of
[58:30] of prospectors that had found a gold
[58:33] claim
[58:34] and they were drunk and they were
[58:35] sitting there and they said come up and
[58:37] have some venison with us
[58:39] and so jack coy got out of the water and
[58:40] went over to them and
[58:42] and had some venison with them and
[58:46] they asked him a bit about him and and
[58:48] the next thing they were saying
[58:50] jack if our venison is good enough to
[58:52] eat our whisky is good enough to drink
[58:54] have some whiskey and so i don't drink
[58:58] i said we all have our you'll drink our
[59:00] whiskey i'm sorry i don't drink and he
[59:04] said this old disfigured cowboy got out
[59:06] there with us 30 30.
[59:08] i said you'll drink this whiskey or i'll
[59:10] shoot you
[59:11] and he said i can't drink it and so
[59:14] cowboy sitting there drink my whiskey
[59:17] gun up to him i'll kill you
[59:20] and he said look i'm not afraid to die
[59:23] i i i'm saved amen
[59:26] i'm not afraid to die but before you
[59:28] shoot me
[59:29] let me tell you something and he said
[59:32] when i was a little boy 10 years old
[59:36] and my father had died my mother was
[59:39] dying
[59:40] back in kentucky i think it was and he
[59:42] said as a 10 year old boy my mother died
[59:44] in there she said jack
[59:46] your father died with a pack of cards in
[59:48] his hand
[59:49] she was a drunk she said promise me
[59:51] you'll never drink
[59:52] he said i promised my mum there that i
[59:54] never drink and i've never taken my
[59:56] first drink ever
[59:58] and telling this this cowboy there with
[1:00:02] a gun standing there
[1:00:04] and in the moment of silence this shot
[1:00:06] went off rang out through the canyon
[1:00:09] and someone else had been standing off
[1:00:11] to the side hearing this conversation
[1:00:13] take place we never know
[1:00:15] who's listening to our testimonies and
[1:00:17] there was another cowboy standing in the
[1:00:19] cracks of the rocks
[1:00:20] and he was waiting till these guys got
[1:00:22] too drunk and fell asleep was going to
[1:00:24] steal their gold and go
[1:00:26] and he said you know what jack so he
[1:00:29] he fired his shot smashed the glass that
[1:00:32] was in this other guy's hand
[1:00:35] stopped the moment saved jack and said
[1:00:38] i too once promised my mother that i'd
[1:00:42] never take my first drink but i
[1:00:43] broke my promise and he said when my
[1:00:45] shop echoed through the canyon tonight
[1:00:48] my mother in heaven heard me say a vow
[1:00:51] that i'll never take a drink again
[1:00:53] and he said
[1:00:56] both jack and the cowboy that put the
[1:00:59] shot through the glass
[1:01:01] said i'm going to serve god from now on
[1:01:03] and they went and they led those drunken
[1:01:05] cowboys the prospectors
[1:01:06] led them all to god they had a revival
[1:01:08] meeting because someone was willing to
[1:01:10] stand up and just
[1:01:12] just explain why i'm this way i can't
[1:01:15] take your drink this is why you know
[1:01:17] when someone comes in and they see
[1:01:19] things different than you you know
[1:01:21] well brother why don't you come and do
[1:01:23] this with us oh well
[1:01:24] actually i i don't feel led to do that
[1:01:27] i i can't my brother info said my feet
[1:01:30] won't lead me in there
[1:01:33] but now you begin to say you know this
[1:01:35] is why rather than going
[1:01:36] you're a sinner you shouldn't do that
[1:01:39] you know saying
[1:01:40] look this is why i can't do that
[1:01:43] the lord won't let me do it and this is
[1:01:45] my testimony and this is what happened
[1:01:48] and maybe that's how we need to be
[1:01:49] sometimes we just need to get close
[1:01:51] enough and
[1:01:52] and just enter into someone's burden and
[1:01:54] really rather than judge them just hear
[1:01:55] them
[1:01:57] amen and
[1:02:04] a little bit of time i thought i might
[1:02:06] just share a little bit of my testimony
[1:02:08] because a lot of you probably haven't
[1:02:09] heard a bit of that
[1:02:10] but you know the lord's formed and made
[1:02:14] me a way
[1:02:15] that i am because of you know he's got a
[1:02:17] trial for each of us
[1:02:19] and i didn't always love god you know i
[1:02:21] i was thinking about this today and i
[1:02:23] thought
[1:02:24] you know what i see myself in pool shoes
[1:02:26] because before i become a christian
[1:02:29] i hated christians i thought christians
[1:02:32] were dumb
[1:02:33] and i had a friend that was a black belt
[1:02:36] and he would go around and he would beat
[1:02:39] up christians street preachers
[1:02:40] he'd go around if he found anyone
[1:02:42] talking about christ he would
[1:02:44] absolutely annoy just beat them up and i
[1:02:47] thought this guy was my hero
[1:02:49] i thought he was really cool and i
[1:02:51] thought i was thinking about this today
[1:02:52] i thought i stood in pool shoes
[1:02:55] you know i didn't throw the stones but i
[1:02:57] was there
[1:02:59] and i thought man lord be merciful to me
[1:03:02] merciful to me that was the attitude
[1:03:05] that i was in so i was
[1:03:07] the sinner of sinners and then one day
[1:03:10] the lord showed me and said i'm god
[1:03:13] and and i i didn't know who he was i
[1:03:16] just
[1:03:16] just like that i was a drunk
[1:03:20] i was an alcoholic i was a an absolute
[1:03:23] drug addict
[1:03:24] and then four o'clock four am in the
[1:03:26] morning drunk
[1:03:29] and the worst state i could be in
[1:03:30] something just clicked something on tv
[1:03:33] showed me something
[1:03:34] and i said if there's a god i'm gonna
[1:03:36] serve him i don't know who he is
[1:03:38] but if there's a god i'm gonna serve him
[1:03:41] that's how quick god can change
[1:03:43] someone's life
[1:03:44] when you look at someone and you say
[1:03:46] there is
[1:03:47] no hope for that transgender there's no
[1:03:50] way
[1:03:52] there is a way there's a way make it
[1:03:55] amen
[1:03:57] and so it was interesting because god
[1:03:59] made a massive
[1:04:00] earthquake happen in christchurch for my
[1:04:02] sake because
[1:04:04] i was deep deep into it deepened with
[1:04:07] the gangs
[1:04:08] and i basically had no way out if you
[1:04:12] know gangs you don't
[1:04:13] just wake up one day and go hey guys you
[1:04:15] know
[1:04:16] i'm a christian now i'm not going to be
[1:04:18] a gang member anymore
[1:04:20] and lee that just doesn't happen but
[1:04:23] that night
[1:04:24] i think it was that morning it was
[1:04:25] either that morning or the next day that
[1:04:27] first big christchurch earthquake
[1:04:28] happened
[1:04:29] and i just i was out i was
[1:04:33] i said i need a job or i didn't say
[1:04:35] anyone because i had no one to talk to
[1:04:37] it was just me
[1:04:38] i basically left my family at that stage
[1:04:40] and it was just me
[1:04:41] and i looked on trade me i need a job a
[1:04:43] job available running them up
[1:04:45] do you have a job when can you start
[1:04:47] tomorrow
[1:04:48] good it was in culverton not far from
[1:04:50] where my wife was
[1:04:52] and so i went and took that job but i
[1:04:55] still
[1:04:56] wanted to find god because i didn't know
[1:04:58] who god was
[1:04:59] so i went down to the mosque the one
[1:05:01] where the big christchurch shooting was
[1:05:03] i walked in there there were 30 i i've
[1:05:06] spent my part in my testimony i just say
[1:05:08] there was about 30 pairs of shoes out
[1:05:10] the front of this mosque
[1:05:11] now if their shoes is people right like
[1:05:14] you don't just decorate your front porch
[1:05:15] with 30 pairs of shoes just to make it
[1:05:17] look like your church is full
[1:05:19] maybe some people do that i don't know
[1:05:21] anyway
[1:05:22] i didn't really know much about religion
[1:05:25] so i just walked in with my shoes on
[1:05:27] and i went in there hello anyone in
[1:05:29] there and walked in looked in the rooms
[1:05:31] couldn't find anyone i was weird so i
[1:05:33] went back
[1:05:34] out and went up to culverton to start my
[1:05:37] job
[1:05:38] i got up there and there was a
[1:05:41] irishman working in there and he was a
[1:05:43] pentecostal christian
[1:05:44] and he was he had just had a bad worker
[1:05:47] leave and he was praying that the right
[1:05:48] person would come along
[1:05:50] and so when i walked and i was rough i
[1:05:52] was rough back then
[1:05:54] and i walked in and he probably thought
[1:05:55] what have i got here lord i was praying
[1:05:58] for the right person to come along
[1:06:01] and i walked in and i don't even know
[1:06:04] i think i must have just said i want to
[1:06:06] find god and he's
[1:06:07] and he just started telling me about
[1:06:09] jesus i was right there i could have
[1:06:11] been a muslim
[1:06:13] you know i didn't know well god wasn't
[1:06:15] going to let me be that
[1:06:17] and he started to tell me about jesus
[1:06:19] and that and it all just started from
[1:06:21] there
[1:06:22] but the interesting thing was that after
[1:06:24] that earthquake
[1:06:26] two other young kiwi guys went down to
[1:06:28] that mosque the day after when i went in
[1:06:30] there
[1:06:31] they went in they become muslims i was
[1:06:34] a few years later i was reading an
[1:06:36] article on stuff
[1:06:37] news about this woman talking about her
[1:06:39] sons that went into the mosque after the
[1:06:41] earthquake
[1:06:42] become muslims ended up getting made
[1:06:45] extremists they went over to syria to
[1:06:47] fight and they were killed
[1:06:49] both of them were killed in an american
[1:06:50] airstrike in a syrian town
[1:06:52] and they had been converted and that was
[1:06:54] in that mosque
[1:06:55] the same day that i went in there and i
[1:06:58] just saw what the grace of god
[1:07:01] and if god can have that much grace on
[1:07:03] me how much grace can he have
[1:07:05] on someone that you've got against you
[1:07:06] know or someone that you can't see
[1:07:09] through the flesh amen and that's only
[1:07:13] that's only the you know the the gist of
[1:07:16] it there's so many fine details of how
[1:07:18] good god is to us amen hallelujah
[1:07:22] praise his name
[1:07:30] brother branham talking here believers
[1:07:32] though this
[1:07:33] who believes all this amen
[1:07:38] when he called his disciples he never
[1:07:40] went out and got the educated priest out
[1:07:42] of the seminaries
[1:07:43] he went down on the river and got
[1:07:45] fishermen peasants
[1:07:46] poor people that they would have nothing
[1:07:49] that the world could say
[1:07:50] why yes they become great men because
[1:07:52] they had a great background
[1:07:53] they had this they had no backgrounds at
[1:07:56] all he just picked them up like jewels
[1:07:58] out of the dirt and made their names
[1:08:00] immortal among men today
[1:08:02] peter james john and so forth fishermen
[1:08:05] of lowly peasant type people
[1:08:07] and i'm so glad that god still deals
[1:08:10] with
[1:08:10] poor people and common people
[1:08:14] amen someone that knows god
[1:08:19] walked into this building today and they
[1:08:20] were the most righteous looking person
[1:08:23] you've ever seen
[1:08:24] if they didn't know god you'd probably
[1:08:25] be worried you know
[1:08:27] but just god god takes the unexpected
[1:08:30] and finishes of work amen and nothing's
[1:08:33] too hard for him
[1:08:36] amen hello yeah
[1:08:39] but you know i was thinking about a
[1:08:42] prospector
[1:08:43] because we are prospectors that's what
[1:08:45] we're called to be we're we're called to
[1:08:46] be prospectors to go and find those that
[1:08:49] need saving
[1:08:51] and when a prospector prospector goes
[1:08:54] looking for a jewel
[1:08:55] he goes mining right and you never
[1:08:58] really you heard the old saying
[1:09:00] you find a diamond in the rough and you
[1:09:02] don't always find a diamond maybe where
[1:09:05] you'd expect to find
[1:09:06] it you've got to go into
[1:09:09] you know places you probably don't want
[1:09:11] to go to find the diamond
[1:09:13] and when a prospector finds a jewel you
[1:09:16] know
[1:09:16] he picks that jewel up or he carves it
[1:09:19] off a rock face and he picks it up
[1:09:21] and it's just a rock you know or it's
[1:09:24] just a big pile of mud
[1:09:25] and this guy's going praise god oh he's
[1:09:28] probably not saying that but he's going
[1:09:30] yeah i found a million dollars or
[1:09:33] whatever he's found
[1:09:34] and everyone else that doesn't know what
[1:09:35] a diamond how a diamonds found
[1:09:37] saying that bro that's just like a pile
[1:09:40] of mud
[1:09:41] you know it's just a rock because the
[1:09:43] diamonds in sight right
[1:09:46] finding the prospect has got to know
[1:09:47] what to look for right
[1:09:49] a prospect that goes into the field i
[1:09:50] don't know if you've ever seen anything
[1:09:52] about mining but
[1:09:53] you know they've got to look for a
[1:09:54] certain type of rock they go all
[1:09:56] the sapphire is going to be in this kind
[1:09:58] of rock here we've got to find this rock
[1:10:00] and then we take it back and
[1:10:01] we start to chisel the rock off and
[1:10:03] inside that kind of a rock
[1:10:05] there's going to be this gem and so
[1:10:08] when we go prospecting we're not going
[1:10:10] out to find the righteous you know this
[1:10:12] i mean i'd like to find righteous as
[1:10:14] well i'm not saying that righteousness
[1:10:16] is excluded but
[1:10:17] sometimes we're going to find a gem and
[1:10:19] it's not going to look like a gem right
[1:10:21] now but we've got to look through
[1:10:23] this crust that's on it and go you know
[1:10:26] what
[1:10:26] i think there's a gem in there rock it's
[1:10:28] the right kind of rock you know
[1:10:30] i've met this kind of rock before i mean
[1:10:34] got to go prospecting
[1:10:37] and sometimes that rock might stay
[1:10:40] around with him for a while
[1:10:41] you know he's happy and he's carrying
[1:10:43] this gem around with him the gems close
[1:10:44] by his side but it's still just
[1:10:46] dirty it's still covered in rock but
[1:10:49] it's just
[1:10:49] it's with him everywhere he goes you
[1:10:51] know and after a while he's like man i
[1:10:53] really should polish up that rock a bit
[1:10:55] and he gets it out and he
[1:10:56] starts giving it a bit of a rub and you
[1:10:58] know
[1:11:00] we're getting there you know maybe back
[1:11:02] in the days when they didn't have the
[1:11:03] tools that we had
[1:11:04] today to just make it happen straight
[1:11:06] away but just bit by bit and it starts
[1:11:08] polishing up
[1:11:09] and in the end there's just something
[1:11:11] that's just so valuable
[1:11:14] it's so valuable i mean what's more
[1:11:16] precious than a soul
[1:11:19] amen
[1:11:23] you know i was looking at um at where
[1:11:26] precious gems are found in the world i
[1:11:28] thought wouldn't it be so convenient
[1:11:30] if the naronga gorge you know the quarry
[1:11:33] there was just like a diamond mine
[1:11:35] right there you know central wellington
[1:11:37] there'd just be high rise buildings and
[1:11:39] the hat motorway
[1:11:40] would be six lanes wide and i thought
[1:11:43] you know but
[1:11:43] i wonder where jewels are found in the
[1:11:45] world you know because it just doesn't
[1:11:47] you know it's hard to find a precious
[1:11:49] soul it's hard it's they're not just
[1:11:51] there you know and so i was looking at
[1:11:54] this uh
[1:11:55] colombia is the biggest producer of
[1:11:57] emeralds
[1:11:58] 70 to 90 percent of the world's emeralds
[1:12:01] come from colombia
[1:12:03] africa is the most prominent producer of
[1:12:06] madagascar diamonds the biggest producer
[1:12:08] of sapphires
[1:12:11] sri lanka has more than 50 varieties of
[1:12:14] gems
[1:12:15] and they call it the treasure box of the
[1:12:17] indian ocean
[1:12:18] myanmar is the biggest producer of
[1:12:21] rubies
[1:12:22] producing up to 90 percent of the
[1:12:23] world's rubies
[1:12:25] and i thought you know it's just the way
[1:12:27] it is we've got to go into the rough
[1:12:29] sometimes to find a precious jewel
[1:12:32] and we've just got to see through the my
[1:12:36] you know we've just got to see beyond
[1:12:37] our own thinking sometimes
[1:12:40] let's see beyond our faults amen
[1:12:44] i think back to when i first received
[1:12:46] the baptism of the holy spirit
[1:12:49] and i believe i save you know and i
[1:12:52] think back to that time and there would
[1:12:53] be things
[1:12:54] that i did then that i'd be ashamed of
[1:12:56] now
[1:12:57] you know i would have was so happy it
[1:12:59] was probably one of the happiest time in
[1:13:00] my life
[1:13:01] i'd received this gospel and i'd be at
[1:13:04] work and i'd be happy and people will be
[1:13:06] like what are you doing this weekend and
[1:13:07] i'll be like i'm fasting i'm going to
[1:13:09] preach on sunday and i was happy
[1:13:12] and then a bit later on on the day we'd
[1:13:13] be talking and you know because all the
[1:13:15] other guys around you are still rough
[1:13:16] and
[1:13:17] be talking and i was loving god and then
[1:13:18] all of a sudden i'd say something
[1:13:21] like a word would come out and i'd be
[1:13:22] like where did that even come from
[1:13:25] you know i didn't expect that to come
[1:13:28] that just
[1:13:29] i was so fresh and but i love god so
[1:13:32] much and i go you go well
[1:13:34] brother i feel you're saved but you know
[1:13:37] it just it takes time
[1:13:39] but i don't look back and go man i
[1:13:40] wasn't even saved then you know like
[1:13:43] and and that's what we have to see in
[1:13:45] each other when you go man that
[1:13:47] fella well that sister you know she's
[1:13:50] quite got it you know
[1:13:51] but how were we to say that
[1:13:54] who were you you know who was gracious
[1:13:58] to you
[1:13:59] someone saw you and saw value in you
[1:14:03] god saw value in you
[1:14:06] amen
[1:14:09] what if someone are thinking about this
[1:14:11] because this is reality
[1:14:14] what if someone said you know what
[1:14:17] i've got a description here of what a
[1:14:19] precious jewel is
[1:14:22] so i didn't see you as a jewel and they
[1:14:25] said look
[1:14:25] sister i'm sorry but you don't fit the
[1:14:29] description of a jewel
[1:14:30] a jewel is supposed to be clear shining
[1:14:34] bright and beautiful cut to perfection
[1:14:42] thus saith the description of a jewel
[1:14:45] you see what i'm saying and it's just
[1:14:48] in reality we're a work in progress and
[1:14:51] up to the day that our
[1:14:52] bodies leave this earth we're a work in
[1:14:54] progress
[1:14:56] amen
[1:15:00] hallelujah
[1:15:05] james 2 verse 1 brethren
[1:15:08] have not the faith of our lord jesus
[1:15:10] christ the lord of glory with respect of
[1:15:12] persons
[1:15:13] for if they come unto your assembly a
[1:15:15] man with a gold ring and goodly apparel
[1:15:17] and they come
[1:15:18] and also a poor man and vile raymond
[1:15:21] and you have respect to him that weareth
[1:15:23] the gay clothing and say unto him
[1:15:26] sit thou here in a good place and say to
[1:15:28] the poor stand thou
[1:15:29] there or sit here under my footstool are
[1:15:32] you not
[1:15:33] partial in yourselves and i become judge
[1:15:36] of evil thoughts
[1:15:40] see we're all we're all form different
[1:15:42] and we're all we've all got a different
[1:15:44] cut
[1:15:44] you know each diamond has a different
[1:15:46] cut fits in a different place because
[1:15:48] the lord's got a crown and it's got
[1:15:50] different jewels
[1:15:51] that fit in different places but we
[1:15:54] shouldn't prefer one to another you go
[1:15:56] you know brother andy's such a wonderful
[1:15:58] brother and then
[1:16:00] pillar of the church now you know he's
[1:16:03] the best brother in the church right
[1:16:05] you know and start to feel i'm just
[1:16:07] bringing in the center and down into
[1:16:09] something we can understand right
[1:16:10] and see that and go well this brother
[1:16:12] over here you know like
[1:16:14] you never really hear them say amen that
[1:16:16] much they kind of you know
[1:16:18] keep to themselves a bit over here and
[1:16:20] and you know not that friendly
[1:16:22] and so i don't really pay any respect to
[1:16:24] them you know like yeah they're
[1:16:25] they're a brother but you know that's
[1:16:27] having respect of persons you know
[1:16:30] is having a risk and we shouldn't do
[1:16:31] that we should you know
[1:16:33] i love that brother you know and i'm
[1:16:36] just going to enter into how they feel
[1:16:38] you know
[1:16:39] that that's to me that's what seeing the
[1:16:41] jewelers
[1:16:42] amen i want to see a jewel in everyone
[1:16:46] because so many have been wounded but
[1:16:48] you know
[1:16:50] the lord told us to be salty and salt
[1:16:52] save is a wound
[1:16:53] so if someone's wounded you know
[1:16:55] someone's sitting in service you know
[1:16:57] i just i just can't enter in tonight you
[1:17:00] know because i've got a wound and it's
[1:17:01] bleeding and it's sore
[1:17:03] and it hurts and i love god and i'm
[1:17:05] saved but i just can't rejoice tonight
[1:17:08] you know
[1:17:08] it doesn't make them any less saved it's
[1:17:10] just they need some healing in the wound
[1:17:13] and salt savers the wound and when we
[1:17:14] can just get beside someone and you know
[1:17:17] really just be their friend and just
[1:17:19] care for them even
[1:17:20] maybe even if we cause the wound you
[1:17:22] know let's just get close to them
[1:17:24] and and just savour the wound just
[1:17:28] love them amen it's so simple you know
[1:17:32] i said i'm not wanting to bring
[1:17:34] something new or fresh this is just i
[1:17:35] feel
[1:17:36] what the lord is saying to us it's what
[1:17:38] he's saying to me
[1:17:41] amen um
[1:17:44] i go to this matthew 18
[1:17:47] 15 parable of the unforgiving servant
[1:17:53] but a scripture reading then peter came
[1:17:55] to him
[1:17:56] and said lord how oft
[1:17:59] shall my brother sin against me and i
[1:18:01] forgive him
[1:18:02] till seven times jesus saith unto him i
[1:18:06] say not unto thee
[1:18:07] until seven times but until seventy
[1:18:10] times seven
[1:18:11] therefore as the kingdom of heaven
[1:18:12] likened unto a certain king which
[1:18:14] take account of his servants and when he
[1:18:17] had begun to reckon
[1:18:19] one was brought unto him which owed him
[1:18:21] ten thousand talents
[1:18:22] but for as much as he had not to pay his
[1:18:25] lord commanded him to be sold and his
[1:18:27] wife and children and all that he had in
[1:18:29] payment to be made
[1:18:30] the servant therefore fell down and
[1:18:33] worshipped him
[1:18:34] saying lord have patience with me and i
[1:18:36] will pay thee all
[1:18:38] then the lord of that servant was moved
[1:18:40] with compassion and loosed him
[1:18:42] and forgave him of the dead now
[1:18:45] how many of us is that that come to the
[1:18:47] lord you know
[1:18:49] and we were in debt to him you know we
[1:18:52] we're just saying you chose me you bore
[1:18:55] my sin on your shoulders
[1:18:57] you know and he forgave us he forgave us
[1:19:00] he forgave me of being in portuguese
[1:19:03] you know so put yourself there
[1:19:09] but the same servant went out and found
[1:19:11] one of his fellow servants which owed
[1:19:12] him a hundred pence and laid hands on
[1:19:14] him and took him by the throat
[1:19:16] saying pay me that thou owest
[1:19:21] and his fellow servant fell down at his
[1:19:23] feet and besought him saying have
[1:19:25] patience with me and i will pay thee all
[1:19:27] and he would not but went and cast him
[1:19:29] into prison till he should pay the debt
[1:19:32] so when his fellow servants saw what was
[1:19:34] done they were very sorry and came and
[1:19:36] told
[1:19:37] unto the lord unto their lord all that
[1:19:39] was done
[1:19:40] then his lord after that he had called
[1:19:42] him said unto him o thou wicked servant
[1:19:45] i forgave thee all the debt because thou
[1:19:47] desired us me
[1:19:49] should us not thou also have had
[1:19:51] compassion on thy fellow servant
[1:19:52] even as i had pity on thee and as lord
[1:19:55] was wroth and delivered him to the
[1:19:57] tormentors till he should pay all was
[1:19:59] due of him
[1:20:00] so likewise shall my heavenly father do
[1:20:02] also unto you if ye
[1:20:04] from your hearts forgive not every one
[1:20:06] his brother their trespass
[1:20:09] you know when we really think about that
[1:20:11] scripture and go man
[1:20:12] how could we not how could we not just
[1:20:16] have such a divine love
[1:20:18] such a precious love if i could say
[1:20:22] to you right now if you just search your
[1:20:24] heart everyone you've
[1:20:26] you know in the message say everyone in
[1:20:28] the church here maybe the church is
[1:20:30] outside of here and just say lord just
[1:20:33] think about is there someone that i can
[1:20:35] say
[1:20:35] just that i don't love them right
[1:20:38] just think is there someone i can say i
[1:20:40] just you know i've got all against them
[1:20:42] in my heart
[1:20:44] it's something i just that's what we
[1:20:46] need to deal with and i would say if
[1:20:47] there's someone that you can think of
[1:20:49] that i just can't forgive or
[1:20:50] i just don't like them i would say pray
[1:20:52] for that person
[1:20:54] you know start digging start digging up
[1:20:56] deep you know
[1:20:57] it's getting harder to mine these days i
[1:20:59] have to dig deeper and deeper and deeper
[1:21:01] to find the jewels
[1:21:02] and that's the burden that's been been
[1:21:05] working with me you know
[1:21:06] i want to have such a divine love that
[1:21:08] there's nothing that's going to stumble
[1:21:10] me in my walk
[1:21:11] to have pure forgiveness and just and
[1:21:14] and not just to have forgiveness not
[1:21:16] just to be like
[1:21:17] you hurt me and i forgive you for
[1:21:19] hurting me
[1:21:20] not that kind of forgiveness god bless
[1:21:23] you brother i love you i pray for you
[1:21:25] i care for you i want to see you rejoice
[1:21:29] i want to see your family blessed that
[1:21:31] kind of love

[1:21:36] me that's not love
[1:21:40] amen you know i believe this
[1:21:43] the the time is approaching so fast
[1:21:46] things are happening you know when you
[1:21:48] start seeing trouble in the middle east
[1:21:51] things are happening you know brother
[1:21:53] branham said watch
[1:21:54] watch what's happening there you want to
[1:21:56] know the signs of the times you watch
[1:21:58] that
[1:21:59] amen so it's time to get serious now
[1:22:08] amen
[1:22:12] i'm gonna finish soon i'm not gonna keep
[1:22:15] us too long
[1:22:18] i can find where i actually am
[1:22:24] am i i think i've missed the scripture
[1:22:29] i'll just read it hebrews 10 24 let us
[1:22:32] consider one another to provoke unto
[1:22:34] love
[1:22:35] and to good works not forsaking the
[1:22:37] assembly of ourselves as a manner of
[1:22:39] some is but exhorting one another so
[1:22:41] much more as you see the day approaching
[1:22:44] so you know provoking unto love
[1:22:46] provoking
[1:22:48] encouraging one another lifting another
[1:22:51] one another up
[1:22:52] rather than casting one another down
[1:22:54] encouraging another up
[1:22:55] so much the more as you see that day
[1:22:58] approaching
[1:23:00] amen and christ the mystery of god
[1:23:04] reveal
[1:23:07] now the new birth is christ
[1:23:11] as a revelation god has revealed to you
[1:23:13] this great mystery
[1:23:15] that's a new birth now what are you
[1:23:17] going to do
[1:23:19] when you get all that group together
[1:23:20] where the revelation is perfectly in
[1:23:22] harmony
[1:23:23] and god expressing it through his word
[1:23:26] by the same actions
[1:23:27] the same things that he did making the
[1:23:29] word manifest
[1:23:31] oh if the church only knew its position
[1:23:33] that will one day then the rapture will
[1:23:35] go when it knows what it is
[1:23:37] now notice you say brother branham
[1:23:40] that ain't ace it's the truth did you
[1:23:42] notice
[1:23:43] paul never knew jesus physically paul
[1:23:47] never knew him the only way
[1:23:48] paul knew him was by a revelation by a
[1:23:51] vision
[1:23:51] is that right paul only knew jesus
[1:23:55] by the revelation just like peter did
[1:24:00] peter peter had seen him in the flesh
[1:24:03] but he didn't know him by the flesh
[1:24:04] because jesus said so
[1:24:06] flesh and blood didn't reveal it to you
[1:24:08] even my own life didn't reveal it to you
[1:24:10] but my father which is in heaven
[1:24:12] has revealed the thing to you that he
[1:24:16] is the word of god and upon this rock
[1:24:18] i'll build my church
[1:24:20] peter didn't know him by flesh man
[1:24:24] by flesh man man walked and handled him
[1:24:27] and everything
[1:24:28] paul had something greater than all the
[1:24:30] apostles did see
[1:24:32] they said well i've got more revelation
[1:24:34] than you paul
[1:24:35] because you know i walked with him i
[1:24:37] went fishing with him
[1:24:38] one day i heard him talk he sat in a
[1:24:41] boat with me and actually told me
[1:24:43] let's go over here and fish in this
[1:24:45] place and we'll get more fish and we did
[1:24:47] see
[1:24:47] we seen him do things
[1:24:51] but paul saw him after he was dead
[1:24:54] buried and rose again
[1:24:55] and expressed himself in the pillar of
[1:24:57] fire that led the children of israel
[1:25:00] knowing paul being a jew would have
[1:25:03] never called that lord unless he
[1:25:05] had seen the expression he was back the
[1:25:08] same yesterday
[1:25:11] and forever said paul in other words i'm
[1:25:14] the same god today that i was yesterday
[1:25:16] and i'm the same light the same pillar
[1:25:19] of fire that moses talked to in the
[1:25:20] burning fish
[1:25:21] in the burning bush no wonder he could
[1:25:24] separate law from grace
[1:25:26] over in the book of hebrews he met that
[1:25:28] same pillar of fire
[1:25:30] he said i am jesus whom they'll
[1:25:32] persecute
[1:25:33] and he is and here he is today in the
[1:25:36] same manner by the same pillar of fire
[1:25:38] expressing himself
[1:25:40] and vindicating himself the same
[1:25:43] revealing the mystery of god that's been
[1:25:45] hid since the foundation of the world
[1:25:47] see it but the only way
[1:25:51] you're saved is to know him by
[1:25:53] revelation
[1:25:55] if i can take i can take the
[1:25:57] presbyterian doctrine and tie you
[1:25:59] pentecostals till you won't know
[1:26:02] and i can take the baptist doctrine and
[1:26:03] show you pentecostals a million things
[1:26:05] you knew nothing of
[1:26:07] that's right but that's not it that's
[1:26:09] not his church
[1:26:11] that's not his church his church is
[1:26:13] himself
[1:26:14] revealed amen do you see it and
[1:26:17] expressed by the word
[1:26:18] itself that he is god see
[1:26:21] see that's what it is you are him
[1:26:24] expressed
[1:26:25] and if anything's going to call someone
[1:26:27] to their position it is saying
[1:26:29] him and you and that's what's going to
[1:26:32] do it
[1:26:32] because if he started the work he's
[1:26:34] going to finish it
[1:26:36] and he's got people that are expressing
[1:26:38] himself upon
[1:26:40] each other amen because he can see you
[1:26:44] as you are in glory amen
[1:26:48] and i just my burden is may we see each
[1:26:51] other that way
[1:26:52] may it be different you know when
[1:26:55] when someone comes to you and says this
[1:26:57] brother
[1:26:58] you know did this to me like well this
[1:27:01] brother did
[1:27:02] you know he did good to you or to
[1:27:04] someone else just just turn the
[1:27:06] situation around that's
[1:27:08] i don't you think about how you can
[1:27:10] treat people better and
[1:27:12] just see what it does in your life see
[1:27:13] what it does to your walk
[1:27:16] if you can't break through with someone
[1:27:19] just pray
[1:27:20] just say lord help me to love this
[1:27:23] person
[1:27:24] you know i i would rather say someone's
[1:27:27] doing something that would make them
[1:27:28] seem like they're not even in the
[1:27:29] message and you go man i don't even know
[1:27:31] if this guy's in the message you know
[1:27:33] and i would say have love for them until
[1:27:36] the lord
[1:27:37] reveals it otherwise give them the
[1:27:40] benefit of the doubt
[1:27:41] amen we had a little situation at work
[1:27:44] with a new guy that started and
[1:27:46] he just keeps calling in sick all the
[1:27:48] time and the boss said to me today he
[1:27:50] said
[1:27:51] do you believe his story do you think
[1:27:53] he's really sick
[1:27:55] and i said look we don't know him we
[1:27:57] don't really know what he's going
[1:27:58] through
[1:27:59] i i think all we can do is give him the
[1:28:00] benefit of the doubt of the stage
[1:28:02] until he's innocent until he's proven
[1:28:05] guilty
[1:28:06] because i mean we don't know he might
[1:28:07] have got he got sick the first week he
[1:28:09] started then he worked a week and
[1:28:11] now he's sick awake again i mean that
[1:28:13] could just be bad luck
[1:28:15] but it's just having that burden to say
[1:28:17] lord you know
[1:28:18] i don't understand them i don't know
[1:28:20] them maybe as well as
[1:28:22] someone else says i'm just going to pray
[1:28:23] for them you know i'm just going to give
[1:28:25] them the benefit of a doubt that's a
[1:28:26] believer that's your child and lord
[1:28:28] i pray for them and i just give my
[1:28:30] prayers to you for them
[1:28:32] make them your jewel amen
[1:28:36] amen i said i wasn't going to preach
[1:28:39] long and i'm going to ask the musicians
[1:28:40] to keep
[1:28:41] come up maybe it was long
[1:28:49] and so i've had a burden on my heart
[1:28:53] and it's been something that's been
[1:28:57] working for quite a while
[1:28:59] and it's prospecting it's this what i'm
[1:29:01] talking about
[1:29:02] jules and the last time we were down in
[1:29:06] the south island
[1:29:07] i was praying to the lord and
[1:29:10] i just i went up to a high place and i
[1:29:13] was looking out across the country and i
[1:29:14] was just praying
[1:29:16] and i was just saying lord i don't know
[1:29:18] what this pool is
[1:29:20] i don't know why i'm so burdened for
[1:29:21] this place
[1:29:23] and as it's gone i've just been working
[1:29:26] with this burden and praying
[1:29:28] and i just have felt that the lord's
[1:29:30] drawing us to go to back to the south
[1:29:32] island
[1:29:33] and not for my own will
[1:29:38] not for because i like the south island
[1:29:41] more you know we joke about it a bit
[1:29:44] but there's actually a genuine sincere
[1:29:46] pool in my heart like we were touring
[1:29:48] talking about before
[1:29:49] that there's an eagle cry there's
[1:29:52] something that's pulling
[1:29:53] because you know it's so nice to be here
[1:29:56] and all be together
[1:29:57] and have fellowship but there's actually
[1:30:00] work to be done for the lord
[1:30:02] because there's jewels to be found
[1:30:04] there's things
[1:30:05] the lord's got a purpose and he's got a
[1:30:07] will and so in praying about this lots
[1:30:10] of doors have opened up and have made a
[1:30:12] way for us to go back down south island
[1:30:14] and so we are going to be moving in
[1:30:17] about four weeks for a job
[1:30:19] opportunity that's come and
[1:30:22] i just pray that you will pray for me
[1:30:26] and that you'll pray for nadine and that
[1:30:27] you'll pray for the believers in the
[1:30:29] south island
[1:30:30] and that you'll pray for the lord to
[1:30:32] stir up work because
[1:30:34] he's stirring up gifts in the south
[1:30:35] island he's stirring up people that are
[1:30:37] wanting to host meetings
[1:30:39] he's stirring up gifts and i believe
[1:30:42] that there's people
[1:30:43] that are going to be found and
[1:30:47] i truly believe that the lord has
[1:30:48] brought us here to teach us love to
[1:30:50] teach us this message that i've just
[1:30:52] talked to you tonight about
[1:30:54] because i've had to come here and learn
[1:30:56] that i've actually had to come here
[1:30:58] and learn what genuine love is because
[1:31:00] that's what i found when i come here
[1:31:02] and when people have asked me how i
[1:31:04] found this church
[1:31:05] i've said i see it as a city of refuge
[1:31:08] because people come here broken
[1:31:10] and they leave different and that's the
[1:31:12] fruit of a ministry that's the fruit of
[1:31:14] brother ben's ministry
[1:31:15] that people can actually come into this
[1:31:17] place one way and they leave another way
[1:31:20] amen and if you come in here and don't
[1:31:23] leave better then you haven't caught it
[1:31:27] amen so i pray
[1:31:31] as we continue to journey on that we
[1:31:34] won't leave the family amen because
[1:31:37] we're so a part
[1:31:38] of this family here and so connected
[1:31:42] and i don't even have a direct
[1:31:46] direction that the lord saying you're
[1:31:48] going to go and do this
[1:31:50] or you're going to go and start this or
[1:31:52] you're going to go and do that i just
[1:31:53] have a pull
[1:31:55] i just have a feeling you know brother
[1:31:57] isaac sings
[1:31:58] read a song and maybe not one that a lot
[1:32:00] of people know
[1:32:01] but it's always spoken to me there's
[1:32:03] always been something about the song
[1:32:05] that
[1:32:05] i've liked and it says it's funny when
[1:32:08] you get that real funny feeling
[1:32:10] like someone leading you into a
[1:32:12] direction that doesn't make sense but
[1:32:14] faith tells you it will all work
[1:32:15] together and that's what i feel like it
[1:32:18] just feels like faith
[1:32:19] is saying that god's got a purpose
[1:32:24] amen so i just pray that you'll
[1:32:27] uphold us and whatever the lord works
[1:32:30] we've been trying to leave
[1:32:31] doors open so that if the lord wanted to
[1:32:34] shut them they could be shut
[1:32:35] and they just keep opening so we'll just
[1:32:39] keep walking and
[1:32:40] and we'll see what happens amen
[1:32:45] i just want to sing a song could i just
[1:32:47] grab the guitar
[1:32:50] i'll just i'll give it back to you
[1:32:55] it's a song that i think everyone will
[1:32:58] know
[1:32:59] but it wasn't in the song book so i put
[1:33:01] it in there let your word be born in the
[1:33:03] manger of my heart
[1:33:05] who knows that song amen
[1:33:10] d we'll start with the chorus and then
[1:33:14] go to verse one
[1:33:17] let's stand
[1:33:20] let your world
[1:33:24] be born in the manger
[1:33:28] of my heart
[1:33:31] let it live in me

[1:34:13] for a king to be born
[1:34:17] he didn't choose someplace special
[1:34:21] to reveal his majesty
[1:34:25] so i know if i'll give him control
[1:34:30] he'll be born in me
[1:34:34] [Music]
