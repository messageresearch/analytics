[24:34] great gifts let's give them a hand of
[24:36] applause
[24:38] I I honestly think sometimes we we don't
[24:41] realize the the great importance of
[24:44] these young people coming through our
[24:46] ranks
[24:47] amen amen so let's go to the book of
[24:49] Isaiah and we're going to go Isaiah
[24:51] verse um oh Isaiah chapter 54 and we go
[24:57] to verse 17.
[24:58] now I'll put this up this oh brother
[25:02] um it can you take me off the fallbacks
[25:04] if I only I
[25:06] thank you
[25:07] uh I don't like pretty cheap to myself
[25:12] okay so so here here's my here's what I
[25:15] thought about today I thought you know
[25:16] what I'm getting older
[25:19] are we all are getting older yeah and we
[25:21] look at the young people and they're
[25:23] getting
[25:24] older
[25:26] and they they're growing up and and
[25:29] we've got a great responsibility us as a
[25:31] congregation and as people of God to to
[25:35] nurture these young ones great
[25:37] responsibility amen and God has
[25:39] entrusted it to us so we have to we have
[25:41] to take this commission very seriously
[25:43] so I only have 20 minutes so I'm going
[25:46] to jump into there and then we're going
[25:47] to go into a time of prayer but I want
[25:49] to ask one thing if we may I know we've
[25:51] got a lot of a lot of things that we
[25:53] want to ask but tonight can we pray for
[25:56] our young people
[25:57] really pray for our young people you
[26:00] know I'm not talking about all of us we
[26:03] need prayer we all need we we know we've
[26:06] got people that's sick and we've got
[26:07] Asher in the hospital and we're going to
[26:09] pray for him and God bless you brother I
[26:11] hope you feel really good soon and we
[26:13] can feed you some chocolate and all
[26:15] those things there is a there is a
[26:17] greater attack on our children today
[26:21] and and the Lord said if we can put that
[26:23] scripture up he said there in the book
[26:25] of visayas he is no weapon that is
[26:27] formed against thee shall prosper and
[26:30] every tongue that shall raise against
[26:33] thee in judgment thou shall condemn this
[26:37] is the heritage of the Servants of the
[26:39] Lord and their righteousness is of me
[26:42] say of the Lord amen may the Lord just
[26:45] add his Blessing to the word you may be
[26:47] seated
[26:49] now I've got I've got two scriptures and
[26:51] that's it and then I'm just gonna just
[26:54] talk a little bit
[26:56] and then we'll go into to prayer
[27:00] um
[27:02] title today is God's Greenhouse this is
[27:05] this is God's Greenhouse
[27:07] this is we we God placed his hands and
[27:11] feet to nurture the gifts that's coming
[27:13] through our ranks
[27:15] you know they they as much as we all we
[27:18] all think we are something we we ain't
[27:21] really anything but but a couple of
[27:23] pieces of dust that God has chosen and
[27:26] molded and put for his purpose so so if
[27:28] we realize that that
[27:30] though you're the bride of Christ though
[27:32] we're very important though he esteems
[27:35] us highly okay where is bride where his
[27:37] precious gift that is that is one he
[27:40] paid his life for us he gave us
[27:41] salvation we are but servants and hands
[27:45] and feet to the God Almighty most high
[27:48] that's what we are we are servants and
[27:51] the thing is once we get lifted up and
[27:54] we try to become something we aim that's
[27:57] when we're gonna fall that's when we're
[27:58] going to fail that's when we're pushing
[28:00] promises that's not ready that's when we
[28:03] we're dealing with people or tricky
[28:05] situations as has come up in our our
[28:07] church before and we deal with it not
[28:10] with wisdom or with the knowledge of God
[28:12] but we actually deal with it out of a
[28:14] carnal mindset so if you know that you
[28:16] are nothing then God can use that
[28:19] nothing and do something with it so it's
[28:22] like this microphone is a perfect mute
[28:25] now if this microphone thinks it's
[28:27] something when I speak it's going to try
[28:29] to put effects on me and I'm going to
[28:30] sound like a martian or I'm going to
[28:32] sound like Mickey Mouse and all those
[28:33] type of guys because the microphone is
[28:35] adding something to my voice but see all
[28:39] I want to do is speak to this microphone
[28:41] and I just want the microphone to say
[28:43] what I say when I want it set
[28:46] so this is this is where we are as a
[28:48] church we've got young people
[28:50] roaring to go and and and draw the sword
[28:53] and go and attack the enemy but there is
[28:56] a great commission for the elders for
[28:59] the older people I don't want to say
[29:00] older because then being Smiles but I
[29:02] don't want to say older but there's a
[29:04] great commission for us as the elders to
[29:06] nurture that gift and challenge that
[29:09] gift and channel it to say hey
[29:11] what if you could remember gifts and
[29:13] callings is without repentance God gives
[29:15] you a gift you've got a gift amen we all
[29:18] got a gift okay some got the gift of the
[29:20] Gap and some can sell ice to a Eskimo
[29:23] and still charge him double the price
[29:24] and sell it and and other people they
[29:27] are very prayer warriors they've got a
[29:28] gift of prayer and and wisdom and
[29:30] discernment and they've got all these
[29:32] wonderful gifts in there but we as a
[29:34] congregation need to realize that our
[29:36] gifts that we have we need to be giving
[29:39] to the right cause
[29:42] and it has to be in the right place in
[29:44] the right time so so I want to talk
[29:46] about Joshua a little bit and brother
[29:47] Bean thank you so much for when we had
[29:50] the discussion about Joshua because I
[29:52] love Joshua and Caleb I think we are the
[29:54] Joshua and Caleb outfit okay we are
[29:57] those people okay so when they when they
[30:00] looked at the challenge they didn't look
[30:01] at the challenge they looked at it as a
[30:04] challenge okay they don't go oh it's a
[30:07] challenge they looked at I can do that
[30:08] yeah because God said so so I want to go
[30:10] through the Book of Joshua and I quickly
[30:12] want to jump in there so remember the
[30:14] the promise is every weapon formed
[30:16] against you shall not Prosper that's the
[30:20] promise so that's God saying it so you
[30:22] young people I want you to realize
[30:23] there's a great commission for you and
[30:26] God said now no matter what you do even
[30:29] if you get trouble
[30:30] nothing will prosper against you because
[30:34] my promises I'm going to keep you in
[30:36] this day the lady you see a church age
[30:39] is the most wicked Church age there is
[30:41] It's the final one it's all it's Satan's
[30:44] Satan's Eden it's his final
[30:47] hurray before he goes to the Lake of
[30:49] Fire
[30:50] okay so he's throwing all that he has on
[30:53] the Earth but guess what God's always
[30:55] giving you more because he says even he
[30:57] comes in like a flood I will raise the
[30:59] standard so Joshua 1. and see Year God
[31:03] comes and and Moses Joshua was Moses's
[31:06] servant so when Moses was serving Joshua
[31:09] was under that Great Commission he was a
[31:11] young man and he would see miracles
[31:14] happen and he would see God and I'm
[31:16] going to come back to it he would see a
[31:18] lot of things happen under the ministry
[31:19] of Moses so I could say it in in the
[31:22] words of layman's term so the kids would
[31:24] understand that you are a young boy or a
[31:27] girl
[31:28] under the the the
[31:30] fostering of brother Bane under the
[31:33] influence of this message okay I want
[31:36] you to realize because Bane preaches the
[31:37] word and this message but you're under
[31:40] being okay Ben is our our eyes and ears
[31:43] and stuff and he he's the he's the one
[31:45] that's leading his flock right now if
[31:47] brother Bean is in his position and we
[31:49] all pray for him he hears from God he
[31:52] comes and corrects us he talks to us
[31:54] we're under brother bin but like brother
[31:56] Bean said what if he moves away
[31:59] what what if God decides hey today I'm
[32:02] going to take that gift and I'm going to
[32:04] take that gift somewhere else
[32:06] do we all just fall apart then
[32:09] is that where it ends so so what if your
[32:13] mom and dad comes to you and says I
[32:14] don't believe the message anymore
[32:16] does that just fall apart right there
[32:19] is that where it stops you is that where
[32:21] you go okay now I climb off the bus goes
[32:23] if Mom and Dad doesn't believe it
[32:24] where's your experience
[32:27] so see now now here's where Joshua finds
[32:30] himself he's under Moses and he's busy
[32:32] seeing Miracles upon Miracles he sees
[32:35] Moses and Moses sees to him God's going
[32:37] to place Us in the promised land but he
[32:39] told me I'm gonna go there
[32:44] now Moses gets taken off the scene
[32:46] here's Joshua he's a young man
[32:49] young gift
[32:51] he believes he's strong but now he's
[32:54] under out of that influence now you
[32:56] can't tell me when God came to me and
[32:57] the very first address he sees now after
[33:00] the death of Moses the servant of the
[33:03] Lord it came to pass that the Lord spake
[33:05] unto Joshua the son of none Moses
[33:07] Minister saying my Moses my servant is
[33:11] dead
[33:12] so this is the first report he got from
[33:14] him because remember God took Moses they
[33:16] don't know where he is they don't know
[33:17] where he was buried God took him God
[33:19] buried him that was all God's work
[33:22] but see now all of a sudden the news
[33:23] hits him now now you think about the
[33:25] feet of of Joshua right there that young
[33:28] man
[33:29] say hey Joshua while you're here brother
[33:31] Isaac's not going to song Lead next
[33:33] Sunday
[33:34] he can't he's somewhere else it's your
[33:36] turn how did you feel the first time you
[33:38] walked behind this pulpit
[33:41] did you sing every song right did you
[33:43] eat every chord
[33:45] was everything going smoothly no he was
[33:48] nervous I promise you behind the pulpit
[33:50] his knees look like this
[33:53] but he was standing here so you couldn't
[33:55] see it but it was and this wasn't
[33:56] keeping Rhythm it was him shaking
[33:58] because it was a daunting task to come
[34:01] and stand here and now all of a sudden
[34:03] have to do something that someone just
[34:05] found natural he's naturally gifted but
[34:09] I can promise you now when brother Isaac
[34:11] the first time stepped behind the pulpit
[34:12] it was the same feeling correct
[34:14] but see we as Elders we forget sometimes
[34:18] that they need to make mistakes in a
[34:21] safe environment we forget that the
[34:23] Joshua and the Caleb they said yes we
[34:26] can song Lead
[34:27] but they never done it
[34:29] they say yes I can sing a special and
[34:31] they come here and they they grab the
[34:33] microphone and it looks like this
[34:37] and then they sing year and then they
[34:39] sing there and then that's unmuted and
[34:43] this is not working and and it's
[34:45] nerve-wracking because for them this is
[34:47] a big deal
[34:49] this is a massive deal now God came to
[34:52] Joshua and he says he says my servant is
[34:54] dead he says but I've got a promise for
[34:56] you every place that the soul of your
[34:58] foot shall tread upon I have given it
[35:01] unto you
[35:03] so every special you sing you sing it
[35:06] for me
[35:07] every sermon You Preach You Preach for
[35:10] me don't you worry just go I'll be with
[35:14] you and you could sing here and you
[35:16] could have had the worst thing forget
[35:17] the words
[35:20] quite oftenly he goes and he forgotes
[35:23] the words and he goes hold on hold on he
[35:25] gets the words back and says because I
[35:26] have to deliver the mail
[35:28] it's true but does he deliver the mail
[35:31] or does he go oh I can't anymore I had
[35:33] enough I quit I just want to sit down no
[35:36] that's not an attitude attitude is you
[35:38] know what once more Lord I'll try again
[35:40] but see now we as a congregation need to
[35:44] nurture that because so we the hands and
[35:46] feet of God
[35:47] so when your child fails it's good to
[35:50] say hey you did something wrong
[35:53] but if it's the only thing you see
[35:56] every day
[35:58] how do you feel the love tank how do you
[36:01] build their confidence
[36:03] so see Joshua here at the beginning of
[36:06] his ministry he gets the promise that
[36:08] everywhere you go
[36:10] it's yours yes it was the promise given
[36:12] to Moses but the Israelites murmured and
[36:15] the dead and Moses got angry and God
[36:17] said okay I'm still going to keep my
[36:19] word but Moses you're going to reboot
[36:21] yourself you're gonna you're gonna pay
[36:23] for that now I'm going to move on with
[36:24] Joshua he comes to Joshua he says Joshua
[36:27] this is what's going to happen to you
[36:28] now for Joshua this is like
[36:31] oh that's a lot how am I going to do it
[36:36] you couldn't tell me that Joshua winter
[36:38] says okay we're going to go to Jericho
[36:39] and we're going to get Jericho and then
[36:42] the malachites and then the Emirates and
[36:44] then the Canaanites and then the
[36:45] jebusites and oh I know there's a couple
[36:47] of more that's going to come uh balak is
[36:50] going to come to me and bail you know
[36:52] I'm going to have to face him sometime
[36:54] and God's just going to help me through
[36:55] it all he had nothing figured out
[36:58] he just knew everywhere that your foot
[37:00] goes
[37:01] it's yours where your foot goes it's
[37:04] yours and he goes ah
[37:07] that's it position and it comes before
[37:10] this great wall and he looks at the wall
[37:13] and he goes that's a big wall when he
[37:16] goes
[37:18] yep it's bigger now but
[37:21] it's still a wall it looks much bigger
[37:24] now and we're going to go 13 times
[37:26] around it but guess what
[37:28] it's mine
[37:30] so do you have it all figured out in
[37:32] this gospel today no
[37:34] but does it stop you walking yeah does
[37:38] it stop you coming to the front there's
[37:40] this little red line here and it sounds
[37:41] like this praise the Lord
[37:45] oh my soul
[37:48] praise the Lord and you're like where
[37:51] did my vocals go
[37:52] is you're nervous it's fine
[37:56] but I want to ask you why are you
[37:57] singing
[37:58] and if I have to sit in church as a
[38:00] brother and sister and look at you fail
[38:03] and go they didn't practice enough
[38:07] my attitude is wrong yeah
[38:09] message
[38:10] you know I had a brother and I'll say
[38:13] this because it's true I sang a special
[38:15] the one day and I and I walked off and
[38:18] it was off the service and this brother
[38:20] came up to me and he said to me you
[38:22] sound horrible
[38:23] like that I was like ah okay
[38:27] and the brother walked off and I was
[38:29] like
[38:30] oh well I sang for the Lord but I think
[38:33] what happened is he might have thought
[38:35] about something and said the words and
[38:37] never knew what he was saying but see
[38:39] that was just the enemy trying to go you
[38:41] can't sing
[38:44] is it going to stop me from singing
[38:47] you know I I had I had I stand a special
[38:49] with rubender one day no seriously and
[38:52] and both of us I didn't think we held
[38:54] any Keys man if you were looking for
[38:56] keys they were all over the floor okay
[38:58] but it bleeped people so much that a
[39:01] young man that age would say I want to
[39:03] sing for the Lord Jesus Christ and Daddy
[39:05] I want to sing with you when we sing
[39:08] isn't that what we should want for our
[39:10] children
[39:11] so now until
[39:15] Joshua you know what happened it was
[39:17] victory of the victory of the victory of
[39:18] the victory the incense came in the camp
[39:20] they said I'll send in a victory victory
[39:22] Victor it was great it was an awesome
[39:23] commission to be under it's pretty much
[39:25] what we feeling and ex and really
[39:28] experiencing in this church now
[39:30] I mean if you look victory victory
[39:33] victory victory victory victory victory
[39:37] victory all children
[39:40] am I lying and then waiting for the next
[39:43] round is victory victory victory can I
[39:46] get on the drums can I get on the Bongo
[39:48] can I get on the sound can I they want
[39:50] to take the kingdom they want to go and
[39:53] push the the commission so you've got
[39:55] two choices you can give your gift to
[39:57] the world or you can give it to God I
[40:00] don't care children and none of us do if
[40:03] you make a mistake here
[40:05] this is a safe place to make mistakes we
[40:09] want you to not sing right sometimes
[40:12] because we want to see what lies within
[40:14] you God want to say is there more are
[40:17] you willing to go once more are you
[40:19] willing to walk around Jericho one more
[40:21] time I don't understand how it's going
[40:23] to be maybe I sing bad again maybe The
[40:25] Pianist miss the key and the elite
[40:28] guitarist is too loud or whatever are
[40:29] you willing to give it another try
[40:32] because the reason we're here is not
[40:35] just to hear brother Ben preach and me
[40:38] preach is but to add and to come and
[40:41] bring something
[40:42] yeah because it's a service to God it is
[40:45] what we meant to do we mean to worship
[40:47] we made to worship we made to serve
[40:51] we're not made to be served that's not
[40:54] how we work Hallelujah you know nobody
[40:56] here comes here and says preach me happy
[40:58] Pastor I hope not because you'll be
[41:01] disappointed
[41:03] because it's usually those Services
[41:04] where God gets hold of you gives you a
[41:06] good Pakistan sends you back home and
[41:08] said I have spoken to you
[41:10] so I'm right on time
[41:12] I just want to say now we go to the end
[41:14] of Book of Joshua so let's go on because
[41:16] this is what happens
[41:18] Joshua 24.
[41:21] so now we know Joshua started and
[41:25] children this is your promise
[41:27] and I want to say something that our the
[41:29] brother Brandon said in a service which
[41:31] was very very touching to me
[41:34] so so here we go to the end of Joshua
[41:37] and just to save time you go to chapter
[41:39] 24. and you go read the testimony of
[41:43] Joshua
[41:45] and he sees the in the in verse if we go
[41:47] to verse 17 or 15 15 in the in the last
[41:51] part of it he says there this is how
[41:55] much God impacted his life okay I'm
[41:58] going to show you now the rest of it but
[42:00] I just want to say that was going to be
[42:01] my opening scripture but I changed it
[42:03] because I wanted you to know that no
[42:05] matter what happens no matter where you
[42:08] are God already made you a promise you
[42:11] the enemy will not defeat you he will
[42:14] not Prosper he will not come and pull
[42:16] you down and you will judge him
[42:20] your words will put him in his place but
[42:22] you need to speak them
[42:24] you you don't whistle to the devil and
[42:27] he goes back to you need to speak to him
[42:29] Brother Andy said to the one day and
[42:31] it's true you brush your teeth when does
[42:33] the most thoughts come and attack you
[42:34] when you brush your teeth because you
[42:35] can't tell him get behind me Satan
[42:37] because he always tries to attack you
[42:39] when you're busy
[42:41] you know and then he attacks you with
[42:42] busyness trust me I know and then once
[42:45] you you actually get broken off the
[42:47] busyness you start showing to you
[42:48] there's so much more you're just not
[42:50] looking like I'm looking and I'm going
[42:51] to go there and there's I-55 but here we
[42:53] go so look here
[42:54] verse 15 he says here for the last bit
[42:57] of a disease but as to me and my house
[43:00] we will serve the Lord
[43:02] okay so just before that just to give
[43:04] you a brief overview this is what his
[43:06] testimony says
[43:08] he says verse 3. it says first God took
[43:12] Abraham
[43:13] and he he took him out of out of um
[43:18] on the other side of the flood and he
[43:20] brought him through the flood okay so
[43:22] that's him he says Abraham from the
[43:24] other side of the flood and I led them
[43:25] through the land of Canaan multiplied
[43:27] his seed and gave him Isaac then he goes
[43:30] and he says and I gave Isaac and Jacob
[43:31] and Esau and I gave ESU mountsir
[43:35] and and to possess it but Jacob and his
[43:38] children went down to Egypt
[43:40] he says but hold on hold on
[43:42] so now I know he's in Egypt what did I
[43:44] do I came down and I and if you go to
[43:47] the next verse I went and collected them
[43:49] from Egypt and I brought them out
[43:52] but then the Egyptians was was and I was
[43:55] leading them with the cloud by day in in
[43:57] the in the pillar of Fire by night and
[43:59] then the Egyptian Army chased him and
[44:01] what did I do I cut them off I buried
[44:03] them in the Red Sea so God's saying no
[44:05] matter what happened I want to bring to
[44:07] you remembrance then you came to the
[44:09] Emirates and the Amorite was also an
[44:12] army but I defeated them for you yeah
[44:15] yeah okay so see who's doing the work
[44:17] young children it's not it's if you come
[44:19] and stand here and you sing a special
[44:21] it's the same as God saying with the
[44:24] fear of doing it is God
[44:26] so fear you got defeated
[44:28] oh I'm really sick
[44:30] yeah but you'll get healed do you listen
[44:32] to the trial
[44:33] you'll get healed oh but I didn't get
[44:35] healed today hold on I said you'll get
[44:37] healed
[44:38] you have to wait a bit yeah some days
[44:41] you you might be lying on your deathbed
[44:43] and you're thinking he's not going to
[44:44] come yeah he'll come
[44:46] he says don't lose the faith but see
[44:49] what Joshua said then he says and then
[44:51] Bella came and he's the king of Moab and
[44:53] he attacked you but guess what I
[44:55] defeated him as well okay then the
[44:58] amorites was Almighty the two kings of
[45:00] the amorites was right before you but
[45:01] guess what I send uh that what did he
[45:05] call that I wrote it down because it was
[45:07] the hornet he says
[45:10] I sent him and he destroyed it and you
[45:13] didn't even lift up a sword or a spear
[45:17] so who's doing the work
[45:20] but now I want to tell you this is the
[45:22] testimony of Joshua
[45:24] and he said if God can do this for me in
[45:27] every trial then he can do it for my
[45:29] child in every trial so I'm just going
[45:31] to say for me and my house
[45:33] we will serve the Lord but the greatest
[45:36] commission that Joshua would can go is
[45:39] you just get the footsteps going yeah
[45:41] and your children will walk behind you
[45:43] and if they don't keep walking with your
[45:45] footsteps because they'll come behind
[45:47] you
[45:48] because the promise is to you and your
[45:51] children and as many as far up as the
[45:52] Lord Our God shall call so so our
[45:55] promise is not we're going to lose them
[45:57] our promises they're coming but how are
[46:00] we handling them
[46:04] so so we we had a couple of trials in
[46:07] our church as well we all know this
[46:09] heavy ones big ones and I'll never
[46:12] forget brother Isaac once said to us way
[46:14] back in the day I'll never forget it he
[46:16] says I pray that you would treat my
[46:17] children
[46:19] like we're going to treat these people
[46:21] these young people because I want
[46:23] brothers and sisters that looks out for
[46:25] my children when they get to a trial or
[46:28] where they do something wrong that they
[46:30] would they have the heart of God and not
[46:32] judge by a carnality but actually see
[46:34] the way God sees them and it was very
[46:36] wise words and we as a young Church
[46:39] learned Lots through that whole
[46:41] experience
[46:42] brother cubine remember that day and
[46:45] it's the wisdom and the gifts that God
[46:47] placed in our church that nurtures our
[46:49] young people amen young people you're
[46:52] not just here to warm up you I want to
[46:54] shake you tonight I want to tell you
[46:56] something you're not a Pew warmer amen
[46:59] amen there is a purpose you've got a
[47:01] gift you can choose where you put your
[47:04] gift
[47:05] you can choose if you want to bury your
[47:07] gift or you want to bring it out you're
[47:10] going to praise God with your gift or
[47:12] you're going to give it to the world
[47:13] that's yours
[47:15] some people are really clever
[47:17] I took the other one I went to the one
[47:19] with I just took the one that could talk
[47:22] a lot I wasn't that I was like I'll take
[47:23] this all and then all the clever people
[47:26] stood in that all I was like
[47:28] okay but God needed a talker so I wasn't
[47:31] that old and I'm happy to be who I am I
[47:35] don't wake up in the morning and go why
[47:37] am I always so bubbly and why do I
[47:39] always have to talk too much and how
[47:40] many times did I go to China and back in
[47:42] one second and God make me that way okay
[47:45] and I'm happy with how I am and yes
[47:49] straight with China is really good okay
[47:53] but that's me
[47:55] but if I try to be something different
[47:58] than what God gave me to do I just need
[48:01] my brothers and sisters to understand as
[48:03] much as I'm me I'm first me to God
[48:07] and I'm the same me to God as the same
[48:09] me to you
[48:10] so as long as that can stay the same and
[48:12] you can love me the same as God loves me
[48:14] we should be fine
[48:16] and forgive me for all other times
[48:19] because I forgave you already
[48:21] because we as a Christian we're not
[48:24] allowed to hold grudges
[48:27] we're not allowed to get offended
[48:29] especially if it's the word of God
[48:31] talking to us
[48:33] okay so now now that's me because I'm
[48:35] running over time here is Isaiah 55
[48:38] let's go there all of you in your Bibles
[48:42] so now remember we as a congregation
[48:45] have no right
[48:48] to go when somebody stuffs it up
[48:51] completely gets it wrong miserably
[48:54] full face first
[48:57] fails
[48:59] to go
[49:00] um
[49:02] we're not
[49:03] amen you know what you're supposed to do
[49:06] you're supposed to go
[49:08] Lord
[49:11] we've got a problem here
[49:13] one of our kids
[49:16] has been taken by the enemy yeah
[49:18] Reckless Love brother
[49:20] one of our sheep has gone astray
[49:23] no matter what he's doing astray why
[49:25] don't we give day before we get here and
[49:28] go
[49:30] kinda knew that yeah
[49:33] that's my burden for us as a church
[49:35] don't don't look the way of man because
[49:37] we are not men we don't dwell in this
[49:40] realm we don't operate in this realm we
[49:43] are just trapped in this realm for now
[49:44] because we are living testimony remember
[49:46] job was already a righteous man and God
[49:49] called Satan to come and try job but why
[49:54] because God saw him as a righteous man
[49:57] God knew us a righteous man the
[49:59] testimony and the first book of Job the
[50:01] very first chapter said he was a
[50:03] righteous man so he lived the testimony
[50:05] God knew his testimony and then he said
[50:08] Satan go and try him
[50:10] so all these other friends that just
[50:11] stated the obvious was just the guys who
[50:13] stated the obvious but God said now
[50:15] never has to be in a man like this
[50:17] so remember who we're dealing with every
[50:20] child in this church has the same
[50:22] waiting with God as you
[50:26] he's not a Granddad he's a father
[50:29] just remember that so Jonah Daniel a b
[50:35] ush Debbie
[50:39] I almost said sister slugs my wife
[50:41] [Laughter]
[50:43] the thing is if you really look at it
[50:46] as they're all going to be 18 when
[50:49] you're 18.
[50:53] when I when I grow up grow up to be 18.
[50:57] When I Grow down to be a tour which is
[50:59] actually half of 30 today okay and and
[51:02] we might
[51:04] I can't believe it when I get 13
[51:08] Rebecca is going to be 13.
[51:10] we're both going to be 18. okay both of
[51:12] us going to be 18 same day
[51:14] she's gonna stand next to me as a young
[51:16] sister in Christ so why treat it now any
[51:18] different
[51:20] because she's a pipsqueak no no because
[51:24] he's my sister and I respect her as a
[51:26] sister and if she asks me something I
[51:29] take it the very serious waiting as a
[51:31] sister talking to me yes it's a child
[51:33] might not be all as wise as everybody
[51:35] think have it all together but she has
[51:37] just as much waiting with God as me
[51:39] remember that we're dealing with the
[51:42] children of God so here we go to to the
[51:44] Everlasting Covenant and and God sees
[51:46] thee in the book of Isaiah he says here
[51:48] everyone that thirsteth
[51:51] um that thirst of come he to the waters
[51:55] and he that have no money Come Ye by and
[51:59] eat he come and buy wine and milk
[52:02] without money and without price
[52:04] wherefore do you spend money for those
[52:06] things which is not bread
[52:08] I thought it's pretty cool
[52:10] we chase money and we go spend it in all
[52:13] the wrong places this is where you
[52:15] should spend your money
[52:17] and I'm not talking money
[52:20] I'm talking there's something but more
[52:22] far precious money and that's time
[52:25] okay and then he goes on he says he says
[52:28] how come diligently unto me that you eat
[52:31] ye that which is good and let you sold
[52:34] the light in
[52:36] itself in fatness
[52:40] okay because the word when you read this
[52:44] it adds substance yeah it adds substance
[52:48] and and when you then see someone else's
[52:50] this the Bible says we can be fat look
[52:52] at that no joking but have you read a
[52:56] scripture and it fooled you so much when
[52:58] you're in a dry trial it gave you a
[53:00] fresh drink of water and it gave you
[53:02] some marrow in your bones again and you
[53:04] go on little children if you feel a bit
[53:06] Barren and you feel a bit unloved
[53:10] come to me
[53:12] spend your money here
[53:14] spend your money here spend your time
[53:16] here you know you will not go away from
[53:19] this thirsty you will not go away from
[53:21] this hungry
[53:23] please I I adhere you because he says
[53:26] here incline your ear and come to me
[53:29] here and your soul shall live and it
[53:33] will make an ever and I will make even
[53:35] lost the Covenant with you even the sure
[53:38] miracles of David of mercies of David
[53:41] behold I have given him for a witness to
[53:45] the people remember David was how old
[53:47] when God started calling him
[53:49] so there's so much I can tell you young
[53:51] people that that God's heart is towards
[53:54] you not towards he loves us but his
[53:57] heart he's he's burden is everything
[53:59] Brother Andy would know this is the
[54:01] young people because you're the Joshua
[54:03] Caleb Commission
[54:05] we're now getting to the other side of
[54:07] Caleb after the 40 years when he wants
[54:09] his mouth and we want the Rapture give
[54:10] me my Rapture give me my rap give me my
[54:13] Rapture give me I need a Rapture oh yeah
[54:16] man I need to get out of bed and then
[54:17] can I have a Rapture because our bodies
[54:19] is longing for that change and that's
[54:22] just the physical side of it but
[54:24] remember you're the young ones that says
[54:26] let's get more into the Rapture they
[54:29] must be more they must be 10 they must
[54:32] be 50 they must be 40. you're the ones
[54:34] with the energy and the drive to go
[54:37] further and push the kingdom of God and
[54:39] there will be trials and you will in
[54:42] your young stage when you come into a
[54:43] Ministry you will have resistance
[54:45] because God don't want you or Satan
[54:49] don't want you in that Ministry
[54:51] he will do everything to resist you to
[54:54] find your place in this church and in
[54:56] his body he will and that's fine so if
[54:58] you do get resistance guess what
[55:03] this is the greenhouse oh Marion you
[55:07] made a mistake you you say David was
[55:09] Saul oh okay
[55:11] see what I mean
[55:13] so I had a whole sermon and and I
[55:16] preached a wonderful sermon and at the
[55:18] end of one I forgot to pray and we
[55:20] walked out
[55:21] yeah
[55:23] base bass guitars was playing and all of
[55:25] a sudden he just eats the wrong chord
[55:27] again
[55:28] and he's like uh and everybody goes
[55:33] song leader then he comes to the front
[55:34] doesn't unmute his mic he's singing and
[55:37] singing nobody sees it we just go
[55:43] do we all go
[55:48] or do we just go hey whatever's going on
[55:50] now God has it in control
[55:53] how many times have I been at the back
[55:55] of that disc
[55:57] and and totally against the words wrong
[56:00] so thank you Dalia and they all go like
[56:03] this
[56:04] [Laughter]
[56:09] and I'm like what
[56:12] oh the the song leader comes forward or
[56:16] David that just praying this more this
[56:18] evening and he's like
[56:22] and and you see occasionally the kids go
[56:26] because now all of a sudden they start
[56:28] experts as well
[56:31] you're like he's muted so what listen
[56:37] you know have you been in a service and
[56:40] and and I think brother uh David Silas
[56:42] priest said in the child Falls over the
[56:44] chair and everybody is like
[56:46] yeah so what a child never fell off a
[56:49] tree don't let it hinder you because at
[56:51] those moments is when God is working and
[56:54] something happens he's just distracting
[56:55] you
[56:56] know see if I miss the words you go
[56:58] praise the Lord you should know the song
[56:59] by the way and if you don't know the
[57:02] song that's the one you're gonna learn
[57:03] for the rest of the week so next time we
[57:05] miss the song you can be the song leader
[57:07] and you can lead us okay amen so so
[57:10] don't worry about these little things
[57:12] this this is little things it shouldn't
[57:14] throw the Apple card over this should
[57:16] encourage you to say if there's a gap at
[57:19] the synth and for five six seven weeks
[57:22] we didn't have a synth player
[57:24] why aren't you there
[57:28] because I'm scared
[57:30] Joshua was also scared what did he do
[57:36] okay if you feel you you're not the
[57:39] world's best preacher and brother Ben
[57:40] says hey can you share a Sunday youth
[57:42] service for us
[57:43] can you come and just share a message
[57:46] for us what do you do
[57:51] you can stand here and you can be scared
[57:53] and you can shake and you always because
[57:54] I like this all the time and praise the
[57:56] Lord and it's so fine we understand we
[57:59] understand but I'll rather be here
[58:02] trying my very best for the Lord then
[58:05] being out there doing my absolute best
[58:08] for the world yeah
[58:11] where do you place your gift
[58:15] I'm sorry I realized that so late in my
[58:17] life
[58:18] don't make the same mistake
[58:23] behold thou shall call a nation that no
[58:25] is not
[58:27] the nation that knew not thee shall run
[58:31] unto thee because of the Lord thy God
[58:34] and for the Holy One of Israel
[58:36] for we here hath glorified thee now
[58:39] God's talking about you
[58:43] there are people outside their children
[58:45] in your schools there are people there
[58:48] that's looking for God
[58:50] they might not always be in the economy
[58:52] of God according to you amen they're
[58:54] looking he says and they shall run unto
[58:57] thee amen
[58:58] unto thee
[59:00] and if you just be yourself and you're
[59:02] willing to share they'll come to church
[59:04] the Lord will deal with them and they'll
[59:07] go to heaven
[59:08] isn't that the purpose of a Christian
[59:10] amen amen so tonight I encourage your
[59:14] children if somebody asks you to pray
[59:16] for them pray for them
[59:18] if you get another sister in the church
[59:20] say can you sing a special with me sing
[59:22] a special with him yes if you go on The
[59:25] Bongo drops and you over bungle the
[59:27] bongo drums it might look at you a bit
[59:29] different but just keep going you showed
[59:33] up
[59:34] don't be scared to try
[59:37] and brothers and sisters if they do try
[59:39] I pray that you will encourage them
[59:41] because you're dealing with deity
[59:44] not children
[59:46] amen
[59:48] so that was my message for tonight I
[59:50] didn't have any thing more but I
[59:54] all right
[59:56] I love the children
[59:58] because you know what without you we'll
[1:00:01] grow old
[1:00:02] and will die
[1:00:04] and there will be no other generation
[1:00:07] yeah true now think about the heaviness
[1:00:11] of this if we all Shekinah loves the
[1:00:13] Lord And We Carry On To None of our
[1:00:15] children
[1:00:16] take that that that what do you what do
[1:00:19] you call Baton yeah
[1:00:20] and keep on going with that
[1:00:23] what are we doing here we're wasting our
[1:00:24] time because we want to further the
[1:00:26] kingdom of God and the promises to all
[1:00:29] of them yes and us
[1:00:32] okay so when we talk to children youth
[1:00:35] when you talk to each other when you
[1:00:37] handle each other remember this is the
[1:00:39] greenhouse we allowed to make mistakes
[1:00:41] here
[1:00:42] we encourage mistakes to be made here
[1:00:44] because the thing is if you do make a
[1:00:47] mistake then there's hands to come and
[1:00:50] guide you and say hey we could have done
[1:00:52] this better and you're like yeah let's
[1:00:54] try again I I and I'll close with this
[1:00:57] I almost had a punch up with the brother
[1:01:00] because I just didn't understand him
[1:01:03] but you know it was wrong
[1:01:07] and you know who said to me I was wrong
[1:01:11] brother Aid
[1:01:14] now I could have taken it as Deacon said
[1:01:17] but because I knew it was placed in the
[1:01:19] position
[1:01:20] and how he spoke to me wasn't out of
[1:01:22] carnality but was of this is not of the
[1:01:25] Lord and he gave me a warning
[1:01:27] I repented I made it right with my
[1:01:30] brother and we love each other till this
[1:01:32] day more than we would ever do before
[1:01:35] so if you do get corrected Church
[1:01:36] children
[1:01:38] don't take offense just take it on the
[1:01:40] chin amen keep walking amen so let's
[1:01:44] stand
[1:01:45] we're going to pray tonight there's a
[1:01:46] couple of prayer requests that was on
[1:01:47] the line
[1:01:49] I think only ashes one was only brother
[1:01:51] being was it
[1:01:54] any sister
[1:01:59] oh
[1:02:02] my Ben and Margie we're going to pray
[1:02:04] for them
[1:02:06] let's do it like this because I I put my
[1:02:09] phone on flight mode after this service
[1:02:12] can you put a pre-request on the
[1:02:14] pre-request line on the on the brothers
[1:02:16] and sisters or the truths noticeable if
[1:02:17] we made just a prayer request say pray
[1:02:19] for this one there
[1:02:21] the reason for it is it's good to name
[1:02:24] the name to our Lord he knows but it's
[1:02:27] good to remind him
[1:02:29] and if you if you really know the person
[1:02:31] you can climb into the burden yeah so so
[1:02:34] dude don't hold back with those things
[1:02:36] when people say prerequisite I'm serious
[1:02:38] prayer changes everything
[1:02:41] not some things everything so I take it
[1:02:44] very serious with somebody on a prayer
[1:02:46] request line says Hey pray for me you
[1:02:48] stop you pray for them right there
[1:02:50] because that time is when they need God
[1:02:52] that time is when they call out for arms
[1:02:54] that's when we should act as a church so
[1:02:57] so whatever you do stop that and go pray
[1:03:00] for them and then carry on with your day
[1:03:01] that's more important then the rest of
[1:03:04] the other stuff okay so so please put it
[1:03:06] but I wanted to ask you let's pray for
[1:03:09] our children tonight so children if you
[1:03:11] can all come forward and come and stand
[1:03:13] here all the children want to or not
[1:03:15] it's up to you but just come stand here
[1:03:17] our church is going to come around you
[1:03:19] we're going to pray for your protection
[1:03:21] we're gonna we're gonna pray for your
[1:03:22] guidance and we're going to commit you
[1:03:25] to the Lord once more and say hey Lord
[1:03:27] we are committed to our children to make
[1:03:29] sure that we do the hands of God and not
[1:03:33] the carnal hands of man so brothers
[1:03:34] sisters you can come close to sprint out
[1:03:36] nice and round
[1:03:39] we're going to pray for these ones and
[1:03:42] you little ones don't forget this moment
