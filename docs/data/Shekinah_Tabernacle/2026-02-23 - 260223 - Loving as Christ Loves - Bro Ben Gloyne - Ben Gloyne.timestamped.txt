[7:12] welcome to the House of Gold this
[7:14] morning amen it's it's good to be here
[7:17] and
[7:19] you know we've probably some of us have
[7:21] traveled a long way to get here and made
[7:23] an effort
[7:24] but I believe every effort that we make
[7:26] for the Lord is always worth it
[7:28] and
[7:29] we are going to have our Spirits
[7:31] refreshed and the Holy Ghost this
[7:32] morning when we we didn't we haven't
[7:34] come here in vain this is not just an
[7:37] exercise that we do just to fill time
[7:39] but our Spirits are going to be
[7:41] refreshed and renewed this morning and
[7:43] our lives are going to be refreshed by
[7:44] the Holy Ghost and the Lord is going to
[7:46] move in a powerful way
[7:48] and amidst this morning and we're going
[7:50] to be refreshed we're going to be
[7:51] strengthened to press the battle it's a
[7:54] very dark world out there but we can can
[7:57] come into an oasis of the spirit of God
[7:59] which is and where there are there are
[8:02] Living Waters flowing
[8:04] there might be a drought you know a
[8:06] spiritual drought in the land but our
[8:08] roots are planted by the rivers of
[8:11] Living Water and we can drink
[8:13] continually the spirit of God and that's
[8:15] what we need every day to in order to to
[8:19] um overcome you know we don't overcome
[8:22] our own strength it's not by might it's
[8:24] not by power but it's by my spirit saith
[8:26] the Lord and the more of the spirit of
[8:27] God that we get then the more overcoming
[8:29] we become so let's let's not make this
[8:32] meeting in vain this morning but let's
[8:33] really draw upon the spirit of God and
[8:35] and and focus our minds upon him and we
[8:38] could he could pour a spirit out upon us
[8:40] this morning in a mighty way that we
[8:43] would be blessed and that we would be
[8:44] refreshed this morning so let's um let's
[8:46] stand and just commit the service to the
[8:48] Lord and let's eat from each heart just
[8:51] just
[8:52] believe this morning that God is going
[8:53] to meet us in a powerful way Lord Jesus
[8:55] we we believe Lord that we don't come to
[8:57] a god of stone the god that can't hear
[8:59] but we come to the Living God this
[9:01] morning
[9:01] we come to the almighty God lord where
[9:04] the rivers of living water flow from
[9:05] your throne Lord Jesus Lord and we just

[9:20] Lord and may we just lay us out every
[9:22] weight that easily besets us Lord and
[9:24] focus upon you this morning Lord that
[9:26] you could pour your spirit out upon us

[9:31] refreshing of the Holy Ghost that we
[9:32] need in our lives Lord we don't we don't

[39:01] back there
[39:03] um
[39:03] amen so just a announcement so 2 30
[39:07] today we've got our AGM
[39:10] um and also it was Bella's birthday
[39:12] yesterday so she was once happy birthday
[39:14] Bella for yesterday
[39:15] there she is
[39:19] praise the lord it's also unfortunately
[39:22] meet us last Sunday with us
[39:24] but yes after suicide to pray for you
[39:26] before you go back to Auckland but yeah
[39:27] godspeed and the Lord be with you
[39:30] um amen I think that's all I have so
[39:31] we're just gonna go to uh Ephesians 5
[39:34] and read from verse 21. this is a bit of
[39:37] a um refresher I was just thinking on
[39:39] these things I guess you know Wedding
[39:40] Bells are in the air and all those
[39:42] things so but the last time I preached
[39:45] on these kind of subjects was back in
[39:46] 2015 or 16 so it's been a while
[39:50] um so I think these things are always
[39:51] good to go through again so Ephesians
[39:54] five I'm going to read from verse 21.
[39:57] and so if you're not married well this
[40:00] will help you in the future and if you
[40:01] are I hope it helps you in the present
[40:03] so amen
[40:04] so uh Ephesians 5 and 21.
[40:09] says here submitting yourselves one to
[40:11] another in the fear of God wives submit
[40:13] yourselves unto your own husbands as
[40:14] unto the Lord as the husband is the head
[40:17] of the wife even as Christ is the head
[40:18] of the church and he is the savior of
[40:20] the body therefore as the church is
[40:22] subject unto Christ so let the wives be
[40:24] to their own husbands in everything
[40:26] husbands love your wives even as Christ
[40:28] also loved the church and gave himself
[40:30] for it that he might sanctify and
[40:32] cleanse it with the washing of the Water
[40:34] by the word that he might present it to
[40:36] himself a glorious church not having
[40:38] spot or wrinkle or any such thing but
[40:40] that it should be holy and without
[40:42] blemish so ought men to love their wives
[40:45] as their own bodies he that loveth his
[40:47] wife loveth himself for no man ever yet
[40:50] hateth his own flesh but nourisheth and
[40:52] cherisheth it even as the Lord the
[40:54] church for we are members of his body
[40:56] and of his flesh and of his bones first
[40:58] cause shall a man leave his father and
[41:00] mother and shall be joined unto his wife
[41:02] and they too shall be one flesh this is
[41:05] a great mystery but I speak concerning
[41:08] Christ and the church nevertheless let
[41:11] every one of you in particular so love
[41:12] his wife even as himself and the wife
[41:15] see that she reverence her husband amen
[41:17] so that's bar heads in a word of prayer
[41:19] this morning as we approach this great
[41:21] throne of grace
[41:22] oh Lord how great Lord truly your lord
[41:25] your love shall Evermore endure Lord how
[41:27] true that is oh God if every every
[41:29] stalker on the Earth was a quill o God
[41:32] and the Sea the Inca Lord and every man
[41:34] ascribed by trade Lord we could never
[41:36] ever just just put in words Your Love
[41:38] towards us Lord your redeeming love Lord
[41:41] towards Adam's Fallen race Lord Jesus we
[41:43] want to thank you so much we can bow our
[41:45] heads in your presence once again and
[41:47] give you thanks lord for keeping us for
[41:48] another week and we just want to ask
[41:50] father may you come anoint your word
[41:52] Lord as you've anointed the song service
[41:53] may you come and anoint this part of the
[41:55] service oh God may you Quicken your word
[41:57] to every heart father and Lord not only
[41:59] to us here Lord in this building but
[42:01] anyone who's not here today Lord if they
[42:02] be sick in body or away or wherever they
[42:05] may be Lord be their portion and their
[42:06] strength dear God we just want to humbly
[42:08] come before you and say Lord have your
[42:09] way have preeminence take over o God and
[42:12] speak what you want spoken and do what
[42:14] you want done Lord for your good
[42:15] pleasure we ask these things Lord that
[42:17] you'd receive all the honor glory and
[42:19] praise in Jesus Christ name amen amen
[42:22] God bless you may have your seats this
[42:24] morning so I want to um I want to I use
[42:28] the same title but so I'm not using the
[42:29] same notes but you know it's like any
[42:31] kind of some restaurants you order the
[42:33] same thing you get a different meal so
[42:35] this is kind of this kind of place
[42:36] anyway so I want to go into what women
[42:39] want now it's very important that we
[42:40] understand one another
[42:42] amen it's very important we understand
[42:44] one another now it's the uh uh we we see
[42:48] here in the scripture that that as as
[42:50] Christ is with his bride so husbands are
[42:52] with their wives and vice versa now
[42:55] brother Brown would speak about in the
[42:57] you know in the beginning we know that
[42:58] when Adam was created he was male and
[43:00] female in one body and then God took the
[43:03] feminist part out of him and made Eve so
[43:05] and then and then even before the fall
[43:07] her name was actually Adam as well
[43:09] because their identity was in one name
[43:10] and so Adam so so Eve was not taken out
[43:14] of the Dust of the earth like the you
[43:15] know like the female say say deer or you
[43:18] know the doe and the male Buck was
[43:19] taking out different parts of the earth
[43:21] they were taken out of the same body out
[43:23] of the Same Spirit the same nature so
[43:25] when they are separate but the all the
[43:27] feminist part of Adam was put into even
[43:29] and this is why you know we have this uh
[43:33] you know there's a saying uh Men Are
[43:34] from Mars a woman Are from Venus you
[43:36] know different makeup different
[43:37] spiritual makeup and that's true because
[43:39] we're one's masculine and one's feminine
[43:41] but it's very important that we can
[43:43] understand one another who wants to
[43:44] understand the opposite sex I mean who
[43:46] wants to understand this spouse and you
[43:48] know it's very important because if we
[43:50] go into first Peter if we just read the
[43:52] scripture here and um we have it here in
[43:56] First Peter 3 and 6 to 9. it's very
[43:58] amazing how how the relationship with
[44:01] with husband and wife will hinder
[44:03] prayers or it will actually can say
[44:04] boost prayers if I put it that way so
[44:07] either either and and it's not to do
[44:09] with how the wife visits how the husband
[44:11] is you know God puts a lot of
[44:12] responsibility in his in in his headship
[44:15] for us right he puts full responsibility
[44:18] for our welfare our care our our
[44:20] provision you know the Rapture
[44:22] everything he puts it on upon himself
[44:24] not upon us right and it's the same
[44:27] thing with with husbands wives you know
[44:28] the husband's office is incredibly
[44:30] powerful you know I don't know if I
[44:32] share this testimony but uh maybe I did
[44:35] but you know um when when Brother Andy
[44:36] and Ira in South Africa there was a
[44:38] there was a um there's a sister from the
[44:40] Congo and and her husband had been back
[44:42] in the Congo for over a year and she was
[44:44] in South Africa not working had I think
[44:46] four children had to look after extended
[44:48] family and she and she was in the
[44:51] hospital and the doctors said um called
[44:53] her husband that was still in the
[44:54] Congress go come see your wife because
[44:56] she's going to pass away and um and but
[44:59] then as soon as the husband came to
[45:00] South Africa to be with his wife she
[45:01] started getting better and the doctors
[45:03] didn't understand why that's because he
[45:05] was not in his position and because all
[45:07] the burden and the pressure and the
[45:09] stress was upon her and she couldn't
[45:10] physically provide and even the amount
[45:12] of money he was sending to her to to
[45:14] look after the family wasn't even enough
[45:16] to pay rent and so all that sickness
[45:18] basically the sickness in her body was
[45:20] because of her spiritual problem because
[45:21] he wasn't in his position but when he
[45:24] came back to be part of the family like
[45:25] he should have been she started to get
[45:27] well so it's amazing the the the impact
[45:29] we have on one another amen that that
[45:31] husbands have on their wives and amen so
[45:34] uh we're here are we and yes we are in
[45:37] First Peter I'm just don't know why
[45:40] where's that first part of that gone oh
[45:42] first Peter three okay first Peter three
[45:44] six and nine so I've got a lot of it
[45:46] here so so it's easier now even as Sarah
[45:48] obeyed Abraham calling him Lord whose
[45:50] daughters yeah as long as you do well
[45:52] and are not afraid with any amazement
[45:54] now we know brother Bram said the reason
[45:55] that Sarah called Abraham Lord is
[45:57] because of his conduct because of what
[46:00] he did he did not he he earned that
[46:02] respect yeah respect is earned you know
[46:04] it's not it's not a forced given thing
[46:06] respect must be earned by conduct and
[46:08] character and so it says here now
[46:10] likewise ye husbands dwell with them
[46:13] according to knowledge giving honor unto
[46:15] the wife is under the weaker vessel and
[46:17] as being ears together of the grace of
[46:19] life that your prayers are not hindered
[46:21] so so the husband's wife the husband's
[46:24] prayers can be handed because they're
[46:26] not dwelling with their wife according
[46:28] to knowledge they don't have an
[46:29] understanding about how to live with
[46:31] them you know it's very easy for two
[46:33] people to live in a house very important
[46:35] I mean I mean very easy but it's very
[46:37] vital that you know how to dwell with
[46:39] one another
[46:40] I mean so sometimes you know things can
[46:42] be going sideways in the family and
[46:43] things in the trouble and all these
[46:45] things it's because the husband is not
[46:47] dwelling with his wife according to
[46:48] knowledge or understanding it's amazing
[46:51] where it says to giving giving honor
[46:53] unto the wife now now this word honor it
[46:55] yeah it means it means a you know a
[46:58] value but by analogy is to esteem
[47:01] especially of the highest degree and so
[47:03] to to give honor and you know this word
[47:06] honors used quite a few places in the
[47:07] scripture such as you know children your
[47:10] honor your parents and different things
[47:11] but you know it says that the husband
[47:13] should honor his wife and and esteem
[47:16] them in the highest degree you know so
[47:19] so we shouldn't um never think we should
[47:21] never think little of one another we
[47:24] should always think of the highest when
[47:26] we think of one another especially when
[47:27] we think of our families our spouses we
[47:29] should always honor them esteem them as
[47:31] the greatest person in the world
[47:33] I'm glad someone believes what I'm
[47:35] saying here praise Lord God bless you
[47:37] brother but we should never ever think
[47:39] little of our spouses because if we have
[47:41] a revelation we are one then you know we
[47:44] will always hold them to the highest
[47:45] degree because we're part of each other
[47:47] we're not two separate people and just
[47:49] because of a marriage ceremony we're now
[47:51] married don't know we're become one
[47:52] flesh amen that we are one person as
[47:55] Adam and Eve they were in two bodies but
[47:56] they were one person so we are two uh
[47:59] you know one person but in two bodies if
[48:01] I can put it that way amen so it's very
[48:03] important you know because we have to we
[48:05] have to look at each other with the mind
[48:07] of Christ now the Bible tells us that we
[48:10] do have the mind of Christ
[48:11] if you have the baptism of the holy
[48:13] spirit this morning you have the mind of
[48:14] Christ it means you can think like God
[48:16] you think God's thoughts because his
[48:18] mind is in you and it's not a learned
[48:20] behavior but it's by his his spirit
[48:22] being in your life him dwelling in your
[48:24] soul you have his mind you have his
[48:25] thinking now we understand of course
[48:27] these bodies have to be changed so our
[48:29] carnal mind is still there but if you
[48:31] have the mind of Christ you can actually
[48:32] take every thought subject to the word
[48:34] of God and if it's if it's contrary to
[48:37] the word you can you can bin it right
[48:39] but if it's if it is the word of God you
[48:41] can meditate upon it amen so it says in
[48:44] First Corinthians 2 and 16 for who hath
[48:45] known the mind of the Lord that he may
[48:47] instruct them but we have the mind of
[48:50] Christ so the believer has the mind of
[48:52] Christ by the baptism of the holy spirit
[48:54] so it's very important when we think
[48:56] about ourselves our families our spouses
[48:59] the only right way to think about them
[49:01] is how he thinks about us
[49:03] that's the only way to think about one
[49:05] another
[49:06] I mean so so he he has held Us in the
[49:09] highest esteem right he put his own life
[49:13] secondary to your life he put greater
[49:15] value in you than he did it on himself
[49:17] because if he valued himself higher than
[49:19] you he would never have gone to Calvary
[49:21] he would never have taken one beating
[49:22] one whipping one nothing because he
[49:24] would have put his own life ahead of you
[49:27] but because he put He put your life at
[49:29] higher value than himself he went to
[49:31] Calvary gladly he saw the joy set before
[49:33] him which was you redeemed amen so so he
[49:36] put you think he it was God and flesh it
[49:38] wasn't just a prophet or a religious you
[49:40] know teacher Jesus was Emmanuel God With
[49:43] Us so he put your life higher than the
[49:45] life of God
[49:47] that's the value he put upon yourself so
[49:49] so if if that's how he thought about you
[49:51] and you have the mind of Christ who you
[49:53] should think that way about one another
[49:54] amen that you should put your spouse or
[49:57] your family at greater value than
[49:59] yourself
[50:00] amen and you should think about them in
[50:02] the highest degree they should think
[50:04] it's the greatest privilege to be part I
[50:06] think it's for me it's the greatest
[50:07] greatest privilege to be part of my
[50:09] family
[50:10] I think it's an honor to be to be to be
[50:13] my darling's husband to be the you know
[50:16] father of my children I think to me it's
[50:17] a it's an honor I think they're awesome
[50:19] family I'm so proud to be part of them
[50:21] that's how I think about them
[50:23] I'm not ashamed of them I don't think
[50:26] they're useless you know we should never
[50:27] speak negative about one another
[50:29] you know it's so important that we
[50:31] should never ever speak negative now I'm
[50:33] gonna you know
[50:35] we should never ever call one another
[50:37] stupid or useless or dumb and that and
[50:40] that will never measure up we should
[50:42] never those words should never come out
[50:44] of our mouth to anyone
[50:45] we should never ever because that's the
[50:48] devil thinks humanity is stupid
[50:50] Humanity's useless Humanity's dumb
[50:52] that's what the devil thinks of you and
[50:53] I but that's not what God thinks about
[50:55] us he would say in in Zephaniah 3 and 7
[50:58] the Lord thy God is in the midst of thee
[51:00] in the midst of thee is mighty he will
[51:02] save he will rejoice over thee with joy
[51:05] he will rest in his love he will Joy
[51:07] over thee with singing Hallelujah that's
[51:09] God's thoughts remember if we have the
[51:11] mind of Christ we'll think like this I
[51:13] mean that that he will he he rejoices
[51:15] over us so if he rejoices over us us as
[51:18] us as husbands should Rejoice over our
[51:20] family
[51:21] amen we should have joy in our family
[51:23] think of a it should give us joy when we
[51:25] think of our family
[51:27] irrespective of of how well they're
[51:29] doing how bad they're doing they can be
[51:31] they can be living the worst life
[51:33] possible but if they're family
[51:35] it should give you a joy and a love for
[51:37] them
[51:38] why because they're part of you so it's
[51:41] not based on performance and how they're
[51:42] doing and how their grades are or their
[51:44] job or their pay packet whatever no
[51:46] that's irrelevant if they're part of you
[51:48] they're part of you and you should Joy
[51:50] over them you should rejoice in them
[51:51] because God because we're part of whom
[51:53] he rejoices over us he Delights us
[51:56] because we're part of him
[51:58] Hallelujah
[51:59] amen because we know we do not become
[52:01] the Sons and Daughters of God by the new
[52:03] birth we we are born again because we
[52:06] are Sons and Daughters of God I mean we
[52:07] receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[52:09] because we are Sons and Daughters we
[52:11] don't become Sons and Daughters by
[52:13] receiving the Holy Ghost we receive it
[52:15] because we are
[52:16] that's what the Apostle Paul says in
[52:18] Galatians 4 because you are Sons he sent
[52:21] for the spirit of a weak whatever father
[52:23] because you are you don't become you are
[52:26] that's why you receive amen that's so
[52:28] powerful that's why the blood atones for
[52:30] you because you are you don't become you
[52:32] are already you just wake up God real
[52:34] quickens you opens your eyes spiritually
[52:37] you realize I'm from God I'm going back
[52:38] to him I'm his child amen so he Delights
[52:41] this because we're part of him and he
[52:43] can't lose a part of himself amen he
[52:45] could not lose one of his children but
[52:46] he he Delights in us because of who we
[52:48] are not what we think we are and our
[52:51] performance and you know man's always
[52:52] look at this and I did this and look at
[52:54] me and look how great this no God
[52:56] doesn't look that way he loves us
[52:58] because of we're part of him because
[53:00] we're part of him and we should love our
[53:02] families the same way we should have
[53:04] that Revelation that it's not you know
[53:05] that it's that that that that the same
[53:07] life that's in me is in my family
[53:09] the same DNA the same character traits
[53:12] good or bad
[53:14] they're in there
[53:15] because they're part of me I can't deny
[53:17] them any more that I could deny myself
[53:20] amen I don't understand these these
[53:22] these parents that connect basically
[53:23] disown their children and you know say
[53:25] they're not that that's not how God
[53:26] thinks
[53:29] praise the lord we should never think a
[53:30] negative thing amen says in Isaiah 62
[53:33] and 4 thou shall know Thou shalt no more
[53:36] be termed forsaken neither shall thy
[53:38] land any will be termed desolate but
[53:41] thou shall be called Hezbollah and I
[53:43] land Beulah for the Lord delighteth in
[53:45] thee and thy land shall be married
[53:47] Hallelujah that's why Hezbollah means
[53:49] the Lord delighteth in thee he Delights
[53:51] in you today hey you may have had the
[53:53] worst week of your life he Delights in
[53:55] you I mean you're the workmanship of his
[53:57] hands amen he's proud of his achievement
[54:00] you may not be proud of yourself he's
[54:01] proud of you he's a loving father he
[54:04] cares he doesn't want to hide you in the
[54:06] corner and you know keep you away from
[54:07] you know the public or whatever more
[54:09] because he's ashamed he's not ashamed of
[54:10] his children says in Hebrews that he's
[54:12] not ashamed to call us brethren
[54:14] Hallelujah family amen that's what God
[54:17] think now that's God's mind and we have
[54:19] the mind of Christ we should think the
[54:20] same way
[54:22] Hallelujah remember these things are not
[54:24] learned behavior of his life as the word
[54:26] comes into you you'll manifest these
[54:28] things
[54:28] Hallelujah so if I get a bit noisy and
[54:30] happy and shouty but you know this is
[54:32] how I feel God God loves us God cares
[54:34] God's interested in you and I he's not
[54:36] this indifferent God that stands there
[54:38] and doesn't care about what you're going
[54:40] through he cares what you're going
[54:41] through amen because you're part of him
[54:43] he's concerned about you and I although
[54:46] it doesn't matter how big small whatever
[54:48] he cares about you and I
[54:51] Hallelujah that's why we should never
[54:53] ever speak a negative God never in his
[54:55] Bible tells us we're stupid we're
[54:56] useless we're about to nothing
[54:58] that you won't find that in the
[54:59] scripture you won't find that about you
[55:01] in this book
[55:02] amen you won't find it in the message
[55:04] that's for sure it means if God does not
[55:06] say those things about us and his word
[55:08] why should we say those things about you
[55:10] you know about one another
[55:12] amen we need to especially your children
[55:14] there you know their character their
[55:16] attitudes you know their driving life to
[55:18] express what the Lord has made them to
[55:19] be can be shaped so powerfully by how we
[55:22] speak to them
[55:23] amen yo you think of girls girls need to
[55:25] know they're treasured
[55:27] remember okay I'll just I'll just throw
[55:29] it in because you know
[55:31] you know what you need from God man
[55:34] the relationship you need from God
[55:35] that's what your wives need from you
[55:37] it's that simple it's really you know
[55:39] you know this is not rocket science or
[55:40] it's actually a very simple thing so and
[55:42] and and I'll break that down so so what
[55:44] you need from God
[55:45] is what our wives need from us
[55:48] praise the Lord because remember if
[55:50] you're because there's husband and wife
[55:51] are so is Christ in the church see so
[55:53] it's very actually quite a very
[55:55] Elementary thing but you see you know
[55:57] girls they need to be treasured you
[55:58] think about yo I need to know I'm
[56:00] Treasure by God I need to know that that
[56:03] I matter to him that I'm not just a
[56:04] number not like in some big you know you
[56:06] know some schools are in the thousands
[56:09] and yo yo a student's just a number they
[56:11] just go through a machine and the other
[56:12] teachers don't really care and you know
[56:14] we're not like that to God we're not
[56:16] just a number we're not just a name in
[56:18] the Lamb's Book of Life no to him you
[56:20] are the name in the book
[56:22] amen because of because if he went to
[56:24] Calvary for one he would have done it
[56:25] all the same if he sent the message for
[56:27] one person to go on a Rapture he would
[56:29] have had brother Brown go through all
[56:30] the trials all the testing all the
[56:31] hardship to preach all those sermons
[56:33] just for you
[56:34] Hallelujah do you think God wouldn't do
[56:37] such a thing absolutely
[56:39] amen you see the things here to do to
[56:41] get his children to move into their
[56:42] position you look at Esther and the
[56:43] things that God had to cause to happen
[56:45] to get her on the throne incredible
[56:46] things a lot of hardship Wars had to
[56:49] happen invasions had to happen Nations
[56:51] had to cease to be for the Babylonians
[56:53] to come and the meats and Persians all
[56:55] those things for her to come to the
[56:56] throne and do what she had to do God
[56:58] will move this whole earth to get you
[56:59] into your place if he needs to
[57:02] he's not afraid he's not afraid to do
[57:04] what he has to do to get you there to
[57:05] tend to hand to Jehovah World War II to
[57:07] get the Jews back in the Homeland
[57:09] because he has a burden for those people
[57:11] there's 144 000 he's going to reveal
[57:14] himself too they've been blinded for two
[57:16] thousand years but their eyes are going
[57:17] to come open
[57:18] soon and very soon as the Gentile eyes
[57:20] are becoming dim amen their eyes are
[57:22] coming open so don't let the anointing
[57:24] on this age come upon you and blind you
[57:26] to what God is doing amen but let your
[57:28] eyes be open say Lord anoint my eyes
[57:30] with I said that I would see your word
[57:31] see you in your program in this very
[57:33] hour Amen to girls they need to feel
[57:36] treasured they need to know that they
[57:37] are special that they're beautiful
[57:39] they're not just a number but they're
[57:40] important and they're a vital part of
[57:42] the family
[57:44] it's very important that we tell them
[57:46] that they're beautiful that they're
[57:47] special that they're clever they can do
[57:48] anything
[57:49] amen amen they're not just a person that
[57:52] you know you know because a wife is more
[57:54] than just a a a a chief cook a bottle
[57:57] washer and someone that does the laundry
[57:58] and vacuums the house that is not a wife
[58:00] that's just a maid but we should so we
[58:03] should never ever let our wives become
[58:05] diminished just to a mate it's more than
[58:06] that we're not just the maid in the in
[58:09] the kingdom of God we're the bride of
[58:10] Christ he shares our heart with us he
[58:12] cares about us you know you know he
[58:14] walks with us he wants to have
[58:15] experiences with us
[58:17] amen that's what God wants to do so we
[58:19] should do the same thing with our
[58:20] spouses amen so girls need to know that
[58:23] they're treasured they're special
[58:24] they're beautiful they're not just a
[58:25] number they're important they're a vital
[58:27] part of the family they are worthy

[58:36] can Rejoice amen amen amen to boys they
[58:39] need to know they have what it takes to
[58:41] be the man of the house
[58:42] boys need to know they have what it
[58:44] takes that they can actually take over
[58:46] from Dad
[58:48] amen you need to instill that in your
[58:50] boys they have what it takes already
[58:51] within them they are more than able to
[58:53] be the man of the house to to be the
[58:56] leader they have what it takes because
[58:57] they want to know as you're growing up
[58:58] you know do I measure up and who do they
[59:01] look to their father for the for the for
[59:03] the recognition because a mother can
[59:06] never lead a son into manhood it takes a
[59:08] man to initiate a man into manhood so
[59:11] it's so important that we're instill
[59:12] into our boys our young men and I'm
[59:14] proud of our young men I'm proud of you
[59:16] young man I'm very proud of you you have
[59:19] what it takes to be a Son of God Amen to

[59:26] kingdom of Hell by your prayers to be
[59:28] spiritual leaders you have what it takes
[59:29] within you never let the devil tell you
[59:31] you'll never make it you'll you'll be
[59:33] built to make it you've been made
[59:35] different
[59:36] amen
[59:38] you must know this
[59:40] the devil wants to tremble manhood down

[59:44] by this but sons of God are rugged we
[59:47] can take a knocking remember we don't we
[59:49] don't tap out we just jump back in I
[59:51] mean the devil may knock us down but get
[59:53] back up I mean you're built to be a
[59:55] spiritual leader that's why the devil
[59:57] wants to put a chain around your neck of
[59:59] you know social media or sport or
[1:00:02] popular some nonsense and drag you
[1:00:04] around by some some filthy Harlot amen
[1:00:06] but God wants you to walk with him
[1:00:10] Amen to never ever be bowed down and try
[1:00:12] and match this world no we're made
[1:00:14] different
[1:00:15] amen so so so so so our young men they
[1:00:18] need to know they have what it takes
[1:00:19] Amen to be a leader to be a provider to
[1:00:22] be a shield to be a hero to be the
[1:00:24] champion
[1:00:25] to be the spiritual priest of the home
[1:00:27] you must know this what you're built to
[1:00:29] be and fathers you must instill that in
[1:00:31] your sons amen don't let you no one else
[1:00:35] is going to do it they're looking to you
[1:00:37] I am aware of a mandate from God to
[1:00:40] raise the Next Generation
[1:00:41] amen that if we aren't the ones that go
[1:00:43] in the if we go all by the way the grave
[1:00:46] the next generation is the one who take
[1:00:48] the Rapture you say well it could be
[1:00:49] tomorrow it could be no sure but we've
[1:00:51] got to plan long term
[1:00:52] I mean because it's not just old people
[1:00:54] that go on the Rapture young people go
[1:00:55] on the Rapture children go on the
[1:00:57] Rapture teenagers are going in the
[1:00:59] rapture amen so we've got to realize
[1:01:01] that there's no Generations in this
[1:01:03] church we're all the same generation
[1:01:05] we maybe have a few more gray hairs or
[1:01:07] whatever but no we're we're all the same
[1:01:09] age
[1:01:10] in the Lord
[1:01:13] amen it's not it's not the young people
[1:01:14] here in the No No we're all the same
[1:01:16] we're fighting all together
[1:01:18] praise the Lord
[1:01:20] amen so we should you know we must hold
[1:01:23] hold our children our families in the
[1:01:25] highest esteem because they are part of
[1:01:28] us I trust that you have that Revelation
[1:01:29] amen that it's not just a you know
[1:01:32] you're a married couple and not just two
[1:01:33] individuals that have maybe the same
[1:01:36] surname but they are part of one another
[1:01:38] hey man and it should be now when you
[1:01:40] think of those individuals you should
[1:01:42] think about the same ones I mean I mean
[1:01:43] you know both of them at the same time
[1:01:45] so you think about I just wrote this
[1:01:46] down I didn't ask for permission but you
[1:01:48] think about Eden Lundy you don't think
[1:01:50] of just Ed you think of Iran Lundy we
[1:01:51] think of London you think about Lundy
[1:01:53] and Ed right because they're one person
[1:01:54] right they're one and the same they're
[1:01:56] not two individuals that are last name
[1:01:58] no dear no no they're they make the
[1:02:00] whole and that should be the same with
[1:02:02] all of us here with you know you know
[1:02:04] that are married we should think about
[1:02:05] the site your husband and wife as one
[1:02:07] you can't think of one without the other
[1:02:09] you can't have one without the other
[1:02:11] amen that's that's exactly how it should
[1:02:13] be
[1:02:15] hallelujah amen so we
[1:02:18] we must give one another the highest
[1:02:20] honor
[1:02:21] amen it says here sorry we're still in
[1:02:24] um we're still in First Peter there
[1:02:26] finally be of one mind having compassion
[1:02:28] one of another Lover's Brethren be
[1:02:31] pitiful be courteous not rendering evil
[1:02:33] for evil or railing for railing but
[1:02:35] culturalized blessing knowing that ye
[1:02:37] are there to call that you should
[1:02:39] inherit a blessing I mean but but don't
[1:02:43] give evil for evil amen the devil always
[1:02:45] try and get in and cause fasting and
[1:02:46] fighting in a home we're not immune to
[1:02:48] that
[1:02:48] right but but we have the power to stop
[1:02:50] it having to break that cycle it doesn't
[1:02:53] just continue on Amen so if evil comes
[1:02:55] and Trouble Comes and weakened contrise
[1:02:57] give blessing because why we're called
[1:02:59] to inherit a blessing
[1:03:01] praise the Lord amen now it says here to
[1:03:04] dwell with one another that that word
[1:03:06] means to reside together amen and and
[1:03:08] the primary uh word that that that makes
[1:03:12] the word dwell it speaks about a union
[1:03:15] so not just individuals in the house but
[1:03:17] we are one
[1:03:18] I mean the family unit is one
[1:03:21] and praise the Lord
[1:03:22] Amen brother Bram said when when when
[1:03:24] Eve was taken out of Adam he said now in
[1:03:27] the beginning they were one Adam and Eve
[1:03:28] God when he made man he made him a jewel
[1:03:31] person both male and female he separated
[1:03:33] them in flesh and put him here on Earth
[1:03:35] and flesh and the female part was still
[1:03:37] in spirit look friend God was so careful
[1:03:41] don't let it leave you God never got a
[1:03:43] handful of dust and Maiden Eve she it
[1:03:45] would have been a different creation she
[1:03:46] was not a creation she was a byproduct
[1:03:49] and God goes over into the heart of Adam
[1:03:51] this rib right under his heart and takes
[1:03:53] a ribbon makes the wife and the Very
[1:03:56] part of Adam's spirit that was in the
[1:03:57] woman those two are one soul body Spirit
[1:04:00] there one they are perfect Oneness I
[1:04:04] thought they're so interesting as he
[1:04:05] says look God was so careful you know
[1:04:07] you know Medical Science has actually
[1:04:09] proven that you can actually remove a
[1:04:10] ribbon a certain way it'll grow back
[1:04:13] because people say well where's the
[1:04:14] missing word from a man if God did that
[1:04:16] well God's the perfect surgeon and
[1:04:18] medical science has actually proven you
[1:04:20] can remove a rubber same way it'll grow
[1:04:22] back so I believe he would have taken
[1:04:24] the rib just just here the fifth rib on
[1:04:25] the left-hand side right by the heart
[1:04:27] then take in the other
[1:04:29] um you know feminist Spirit out of him
[1:04:30] and he made Evie says look God was so
[1:04:32] careful see God was so careful when he
[1:04:34] made you and I it wasn't just yeah yeah
[1:04:37] it wasn't a haphazard thing that we're
[1:04:38] here today
[1:04:40] and he said that they are perfect
[1:04:42] Oneness they don't become perfectly one
[1:04:45] they are perfect Oneness before the fall
[1:04:47] so God was showing that that that their
[1:04:49] lives were a manifestation of perfect
[1:04:51] Oneness Adam knew how to dwell with Eve
[1:04:54] he had perfect understanding of her and
[1:04:56] she had perfect understanding of whom I
[1:04:58] believe because they they were perfectly
[1:05:00] one now we may befallen now in the YO in
[1:05:04] these Fallen bodies rather but if we're
[1:05:06] being Redeemed by the blood of Jesus
[1:05:07] Christ we can have this perfect Oneness
[1:05:09] even in this Fallen flesh
[1:05:12] because God wants to prove his victory
[1:05:15] on this side of of the Rapture right he
[1:05:19] wants to prove to the devil that his
[1:05:21] achievement is a restoration of Adam and
[1:05:23] Eve even in this Fallen World yeah it's
[1:05:26] amazing how Adam and Eve they fell in
[1:05:29] God's Garden of Eden be it God in his
[1:05:32] great uh Power and mercy has made a
[1:05:35] people to stand in Satan's Eden
[1:05:37] Hallelujah that's you and I we are built
[1:05:39] to stand in this day Adam and he fell in
[1:05:42] Paradise but we are standing in the
[1:05:45] world that is in chaos
[1:05:46] Hallelujah God made us to stand in chaos
[1:05:49] Amen to be perfectly one with our
[1:05:52] spouses praise God I'm glad about that
[1:05:55] aren't you
[1:05:56] Hallelujah so so men must we must
[1:05:59] understand how to dwell with our wives
[1:06:00] according to knowledge
[1:06:02] amen
[1:06:04] that's very important now now it says in
[1:06:06] Proverbs 15 1 and 2 a soft answer
[1:06:08] turneth away wrath but Grievous words
[1:06:10] stir up anger the tongue of the wise
[1:06:13] uses knowledge you're right but the
[1:06:14] mouth of fools poorth out foolishness
[1:06:17] amen so so a soft answer turns away
[1:06:20] wrath that's why we read at the end of
[1:06:22] their first Peter that we should not
[1:06:23] contr you know not give evil for evil or
[1:06:25] rallying for railing but contrast
[1:06:27] blessing known that you are down to call
[1:06:29] that we that ye should inherit a
[1:06:31] blessing so it's not about just saying
[1:06:33] woman be quiet you don't understand and
[1:06:35] just just toughen up and deal with it
[1:06:37] that's not dwelling according to
[1:06:39] knowledge amen but you've got to be able
[1:06:41] to have an understanding that you can
[1:06:42] actually speak to one another to
[1:06:45] actually meet one another's needs
[1:06:48] now I'm just gonna go through this list
[1:06:51] and
[1:06:52] um
[1:06:54] he says here in Romans 12 and 9 let love
[1:06:57] be without dissimulation abhor that
[1:06:59] which is evil cleave to that which is
[1:07:00] good be kindly affectionate uh uh
[1:07:03] affection one to another with brotherly
[1:07:05] love and honor preferring one another
[1:07:08] so it's a great secret now if you prefer
[1:07:10] one another look see see the Lord put
[1:07:12] your care and Welfare ahead of himself
[1:07:15] he put you first in himself second
[1:07:18] and if we can put our families first and
[1:07:21] ourselves second we'll be successful
[1:07:23] selfishness has caused this world to go
[1:07:25] to nuclear war
[1:07:28] greed and selfishness if we can get that
[1:07:31] out of ourselves amen what will it do
[1:07:34] it'll do the opposite it won't be world
[1:07:36] war three it won't be Armageddon in your
[1:07:37] home it'll be the millennium
[1:07:39] I mean if we put our our spouses above
[1:07:43] ourselves their needs before ours just
[1:07:45] like the Lord put our needs before his
[1:07:47] amen then then we can be successful now
[1:07:50] as I said here that we should we should
[1:07:52] understand
[1:07:54] so as as the Lord
[1:07:57] uh as as we men want a relationship with
[1:08:00] the Lord so our wives want it from us
[1:08:03] right it's really that straightforward
[1:08:05] amen because in Ephesians 5 which we
[1:08:07] read in our opening scripture Paul is
[1:08:09] basically saying husbands you've got to
[1:08:10] be like God you've got to be like Christ
[1:08:12] in order amen that that that that that
[1:08:15] that that you get really the most of
[1:08:18] what you really need out of marriage out
[1:08:20] of one another
[1:08:21] because remember when the husband comes
[1:08:23] to his position then the family follows
[1:08:25] right because remember we it's like you
[1:08:28] take us now we would not we were not
[1:08:30] born into our right position in Christ
[1:08:34] okay some of you are honest some of you
[1:08:36] are just maybe asleep some of you are
[1:08:38] just Angels Wings put them away
[1:08:40] we were born in sin shaped iniquity come
[1:08:42] to all speaking lies right we were we
[1:08:44] were born chaotic
[1:08:46] we were born chaotic but the Lord was
[1:08:48] never in chaos he was always in his
[1:08:50] position so when he began to reveal
[1:08:52] himself when his words started to become
[1:08:54] alive to us it brought us into our
[1:08:56] position amen so so he was in his
[1:08:59] position in the family and then he by
[1:09:01] him revealing his heart his word to you
[1:09:04] and I brought brings us into our
[1:09:06] position because you know adoption is
[1:09:09] really because of relationship you know
[1:09:11] adoption or positioning placing as a son
[1:09:14] or daughter of God is Not based on our
[1:09:16] performance it's based on relationship
[1:09:19] you know it's like brother Brown would
[1:09:20] dramatize about the um tutor and the you
[1:09:23] know and and the son
[1:09:27] you know and the and the tutor you know
[1:09:29] we you know we know in the scripture we
[1:09:30] might find it later on my Note somewhere
[1:09:32] but you know we were under tutors right
[1:09:34] until the fullness of time would come
[1:09:37] when the Lord revealed himself we're
[1:09:38] positioned you know as a as a son or
[1:09:40] daughter of God but brother man would
[1:09:42] dramatize about how the tutor would say
[1:09:44] to the son okay I'm gonna go up this
[1:09:45] hill I'm gonna go here I'm going to go
[1:09:46] here can you go with me and then and
[1:09:48] then the son would say well as long as
[1:09:50] you're holding my hand
[1:09:51] I'm gonna get there right so I've become
[1:09:54] a full trust because of a relationship
[1:09:55] now we know the Tudor is the father
[1:09:57] right
[1:09:58] the tutor is God the Holy Ghost and God
[1:10:00] are not two different beings they're the
[1:10:02] same God right so the tutor that leads
[1:10:04] us is God himself but but if you look
[1:10:08] into the adoption series it's really
[1:10:09] adoption or the Sons and Daughters of
[1:10:12] God becoming positionally placed in
[1:10:14] Christ is because of relationship
[1:10:17] it's when the son or daughter of God
[1:10:19] when you fully trust the Lord and fully
[1:10:21] surrender then God will take you into
[1:10:22] your position
[1:10:24] amen so it's not based on your
[1:10:26] performance
[1:10:27] it's not based on how smart you are and
[1:10:29] how
[1:10:30] wise and whatever more and you know your
[1:10:32] ability now it's your relationship with
[1:10:34] the Lord that matters that's what will
[1:10:35] take you into your adopted position
[1:10:38] hey man I may sound very simplistic but
[1:10:40] it's very powerful it's adoption is
[1:10:42] based on relationship
[1:10:45] amen so the Lord so we're in chaos the
[1:10:48] Lord was never in chaos he reveals
[1:10:49] himself to us then we come into our
[1:10:51] position we come into order so it always
[1:10:53] works that way down never works up it
[1:10:55] always works down I mean from the head
[1:10:57] down
[1:10:59] amen so that's why the Apostle Paul is
[1:11:01] basically saying husbands you've got to
[1:11:02] be like if you want to be a real husband
[1:11:04] you've got to be like Christ in order to
[1:11:06] bring your wife and your family into
[1:11:08] into their positions
[1:11:10] right so now this may sound like an
[1:11:12] impossible task but it's not
[1:11:15] Hallelujah I mean God doesn't put
[1:11:17] something on his children and say now
[1:11:19] you work it out you know this is not
[1:11:21] like building some big kids hit
[1:11:22] something without instructions right
[1:11:23] even actually the one who designed it
[1:11:25] there to fix it you're like brother bran
[1:11:27] would say there was a mechanic and he
[1:11:28] was trying to fix this car and he's
[1:11:29] trying all different kind of things and
[1:11:31] he just couldn't get it going and pulls
[1:11:33] the engine out pulls everything out puts
[1:11:34] it back in pulls it out puts it back in
[1:11:36] changes all these parts the thing won't
[1:11:38] go and then a man just walks into the
[1:11:40] garage and he says hold on well you know
[1:11:42] what's going on he said this and this
[1:11:44] and this and this he says just change
[1:11:45] that and do that and do that for the
[1:11:47] mechanic he was wise I'll say well this
[1:11:49] guy seems to know what you know he seems
[1:11:51] to know what he's talking about I've
[1:11:52] tried everything it hasn't worked and
[1:11:54] then he does that puts the key in the
[1:11:56] ignition and it just purrs like a purse
[1:11:58] like a lion the engine it goes off and
[1:12:00] then in the mechanical Club says how do
[1:12:01] you know how this thing works is well
[1:12:03] I'm the chief designer I made it
[1:12:05] you know it's the same thing with us
[1:12:07] right it's like we try and change things
[1:12:09] and do things and do all kinds of things
[1:12:10] but when the chief designer comes in
[1:12:13] and says look this is how my word is
[1:12:15] this is you know just surrender to me
[1:12:16] and I'll show you how to go through life
[1:12:17] I'll show you how to have a family I'll
[1:12:19] show you how to walk in my word see amen
[1:12:22] it's so it's why it's relationship
[1:12:24] amen so now
[1:12:27] so we need to so so when God
[1:12:29] so so it's not impossible if we really
[1:12:32] want to know what our wives want from us
[1:12:34] Brothers we can then then we can look
[1:12:36] into the description say what do we want
[1:12:38] from the Lord
[1:12:39] right because as we're we're actually
[1:12:41] all women here
[1:12:43] we are we are we're all in the economy
[1:12:45] of God female because we're the bride of
[1:12:47] Christ
[1:12:48] that's why when sometimes say ladies
[1:12:50] first for lunch you know
[1:12:53] why because we're actually all feminine
[1:12:54] right
[1:12:55] in in the economy of God
[1:12:58] so that's why when we can we can look
[1:13:00] about what God what we want from the
[1:13:02] Lord we can see what our spouses want
[1:13:03] from us so this is a no particular order
[1:13:06] and this is not a complete list okay but
[1:13:08] you know
[1:13:09] we want unconditional love our spouses
[1:13:13] want our wise what unconditional love
[1:13:14] from us we want unconditional love from
[1:13:16] God I mean it's not based on condition
[1:13:18] if you do this I'll do this no we want
[1:13:20] an unconditional love amen we want love
[1:13:22] that's not shared with another
[1:13:25] right and our wives don't want a love
[1:13:27] that's shared with someone else
[1:13:29] amen we want acceptance of Who We Are
[1:13:33] that we don't have to change our
[1:13:34] personality we don't have to change our
[1:13:36] hair color our height our width or
[1:13:37] whatever no we want to be accepted by
[1:13:39] the Lord Who We Are Who Wants to be
[1:13:41] accepted because of who they are yeah
[1:13:42] who they are
[1:13:44] praise the Lord if I'm loud I'm loud if
[1:13:45] I'm quiet I'm quiet but God accepts me
[1:13:47] anyway
[1:13:48] praise the Lord amen we want
[1:13:51] understanding
[1:13:52] you want to be understood by the law day
[1:13:54] our wives want to be understood
[1:13:57] amen
[1:13:59] we want Security in the relationship
[1:14:02] amen we don't want to be hung you know
[1:14:04] am I going to make it today and you know
[1:14:06] am I in the bride today and you know you
[1:14:08] look at your I don't have a smart watch
[1:14:10] but you know if you had to go to
[1:14:11] spiritual metrics on that thing you know
[1:14:14] I'm tracking way down no we don't want
[1:14:16] that kind of relationship with God
[1:14:18] amen we want Security in the
[1:14:21] relationship and he wants you to be
[1:14:22] secure in your relationship with him
[1:14:24] he wants you to know that you know that
[1:14:26] you know that you're past from Death to
[1:14:27] life amen that you're going on the
[1:14:29] Rapture he wants that in your heart
[1:14:30] doesn't have to be a lightning bolt from
[1:14:32] the blue because to put that Revelation
[1:14:33] in your soul you're part of him he can't
[1:14:35] lose you amen because you're part of him
[1:14:37] and you're going right
[1:14:39] who wants that kind of security
[1:14:41] you know because remember it's not based
[1:14:44] to CC the problem is former ages the
[1:14:47] Pentecostal age brother Ram said they're
[1:14:48] great legalists and so that of course
[1:14:50] comes into the message because people
[1:14:52] came out that Pentecostal works-based
[1:14:54] religion right but God wants you to
[1:14:56] realize it's not by works you're saved
[1:14:58] it's by grace and the Bible definition
[1:15:00] of Grace is a Divine influence upon the
[1:15:02] heart and Its Reflection in the life
[1:15:04] amen so if if Grace has come upon your
[1:15:07] heart then it'll be reflected in your
[1:15:09] life
[1:15:10] that that is divine grace you see
[1:15:12] Abraham walked by Grace God said leave
[1:15:14] this land go to another land whatever
[1:15:15] Grace Came Upon Us heart and it was
[1:15:17] reflected in the life he started walking
[1:15:20] hallelujah amen and we're the children
[1:15:22] of Abraham so it should be the same
[1:15:24] thing with you and I amen we should be a
[1:15:26] Divine influence why am I a Believer a
[1:15:28] Divine influence Came Upon My Life what
[1:15:30] was that Divine influence it was the
[1:15:31] open Word
[1:15:32] Came Upon My Life As now and you know
[1:15:35] it's now influencing me where once I was
[1:15:37] going into darkness going away from God
[1:15:39] didn't care about him but then an
[1:15:41] influence came his influence Came Upon
[1:15:43] My Life I started walking with him
[1:15:44] what's that Grace found you
[1:15:47] hey man we didn't find Grace amen Grace
[1:15:49] found us I mean you can look at all the
[1:15:51] scriptures about your like Esther found
[1:15:53] Grace your favor in the sight of the
[1:15:54] king
[1:15:55] Hallelujah great Esther found that in
[1:15:57] his sight it wasn't the other way around
[1:15:59] it was just God yo you're the king said
[1:16:02] I find favor in this one
[1:16:04] Hallelujah
[1:16:05] amen that's the same thing with you and
[1:16:07] I
[1:16:08] and the reason that she found Grace or
[1:16:10] favor is because she listened to her guy
[1:16:12] who knew the heart of the king we've had
[1:16:14] a hair guy in this day brother Branham
[1:16:16] right he knew the heart of God he'd
[1:16:18] stand in Christ the mercy God revealed
[1:16:19] say I'm going to tell you what was on
[1:16:20] the back part of God's mind before the
[1:16:21] foundation of the world and someone said
[1:16:23] how he studied for that was his Bible in
[1:16:25] a concordance he got crisis of mystery
[1:16:27] God revealed
[1:16:28] Hallelujah threefold manifestation of
[1:16:31] God
[1:16:32] who else has stood there I I haven't
[1:16:34] heard another preacher so I'm going to
[1:16:35] tell you what was in the back part of
[1:16:36] God's mind and now here it is I've never
[1:16:39] heard that before have you heard that
[1:16:40] before some denominational guys say look
[1:16:42] I'm gonna tell what's in the back part
[1:16:43] of God's mind no
[1:16:46] Hallelujah why because there's a haggai
[1:16:48] in this day so this is how you dress
[1:16:50] it's how you dress in the word your
[1:16:51] attitude your Meek humble Spirit you
[1:16:53] should have and this is how you approach
[1:16:54] the king and different things amen
[1:16:56] praise the Lord
[1:16:59] amen Security in the relationship amen
[1:17:01] we provision well we want to be provided
[1:17:04] for
[1:17:07] we want to be comforted
[1:17:10] amen he Comforts all those who mourn we
[1:17:13] want to be comforted we don't want to
[1:17:14] say just you know God doesn't say just
[1:17:16] hard enough
[1:17:17] you know just get over it
[1:17:19] no he allows us to pour our grief and
[1:17:22] our sorrow and whatever we you know he
[1:17:24] listens when we just pour it out
[1:17:26] Hallelujah and then and then when you
[1:17:27] end up you know finishing all that you
[1:17:29] may nothing may not have changed but you
[1:17:31] feel better who feels better
[1:17:33] yo yo that's like David would say you
[1:17:36] keep all my tears in a bottle Lord he
[1:17:38] poured out a lot of Tears a lot of heart
[1:17:40] to be poured out before God and he says
[1:17:42] God you keep all those things
[1:17:44] it's not just Idle Words that come
[1:17:45] before the Lord amen comfort
[1:17:48] amen
[1:17:50] we want a relationship that is unique to
[1:17:52] us alone
[1:17:55] see we want to feel the most special
[1:17:56] with God right
[1:17:58] amen hey relationship that is unique
[1:18:01] amen so it's not our buddies that are
[1:18:03] our that that know our deepest desires
[1:18:06] and Ambitions and hopes and dreams

[1:18:10] because remember our spouse should be
[1:18:12] our best friend
[1:18:13] I'm not ashamed to say Christine's my
[1:18:15] best friend

[1:18:19] having coffee with her hanging out I've
[1:18:20] I enjoy that time
[1:18:22] Hallelujah so that's how you should be
[1:18:24] your spouse should be your best friend
[1:18:26] and if if they are not your best friend
[1:18:27] you need to check up on your
[1:18:29] relationship
[1:18:30] amen because your friends are not one
[1:18:32] with you your spouse should be
[1:18:36] amen we want attention from God
[1:18:40] right we're not just a hobby for him
[1:18:41] we're not just a side project we're
[1:18:44] actually the very purpose of his being
[1:18:46] Hallelujah
[1:18:48] well that's a big statement No we're the
[1:18:49] purpose of us being
[1:18:51] he didn't Express his attributes to
[1:18:53] Jupiter or the fish or the whales or the
[1:18:56] elephants no he expressed all his
[1:18:57] attributes to his sons and daughters
[1:18:59] amen all of his heart he didn't express
[1:19:02] it to the Milky Way he's not interested
[1:19:04] actually in the Milky Way he's
[1:19:05] interested in you why'd he put the Milky
[1:19:07] Way there that you'd look up and say
[1:19:08] there's a God Amen why'd he put the fly
[1:19:10] and all the all the ecosystem of the
[1:19:12] earth why do you put it there you'd look
[1:19:13] at it say this must be a crater behind
[1:19:15] this thing how can all these different
[1:19:17] organisms become in such a perfect
[1:19:19] without man's dabbling in Perfect
[1:19:21] Harmony
[1:19:23] Phil said well that takes billions of
[1:19:24] years listen I've I've studied chemistry
[1:19:26] I studied people say yo yo they're still
[1:19:29] trying to work out how life started
[1:19:32] they're trying to work out was it a
[1:19:33] lightning bolt that hit some primeval
[1:19:35] super was it a volcano or was it a
[1:19:37] hydrothermal vent system deep under the
[1:19:39] ocean they can't work it out because the
[1:19:41] very laws of chemistry forbid actually
[1:19:43] pre-life even forming
[1:19:46] but yeah they try and make it happen but
[1:19:48] it can't happen because it took God
[1:19:51] amen and now that's just basic basic
[1:19:53] life forming pre-life they call it they
[1:19:55] can't actually get it chemically because
[1:19:56] it actually because because how they
[1:19:59] think it happens they won't have a
[1:20:00] chemistry lesson
[1:20:04] it's against the basic laws of science
[1:20:06] for the chemicals of of even the most
[1:20:09] basic amino acids in the more
[1:20:11] complicated ones to form and be there
[1:20:12] and start replicating who's ever gone on
[1:20:14] YouTube you just you just Google put it
[1:20:16] on the chat about about all the
[1:20:18] Machinery that takes takes takes your
[1:20:21] DNA to make an enzyme or a protein
[1:20:24] man you look at a car manufacturing
[1:20:25] plant that's nothing
[1:20:27] compared to what's going on billions of
[1:20:29] times in your body every day building a
[1:20:31] Tesla building of even an aircraft
[1:20:33] carrier or anything that's nothing
[1:20:35] compared to what's going on in your
[1:20:36] cells right now it doesn't just go oh
[1:20:39] we'll make a protein and Boop no there's
[1:20:40] all these different different things and
[1:20:42] even even to get the thing fold in the
[1:20:44] right shape
[1:20:45] man it's super complicated and and
[1:20:47] evolutionary say oh that's just that's
[1:20:49] an argument saying well it's too
[1:20:50] complicated therefore it can't evolve no
[1:20:52] it is too complicated because without
[1:20:54] any of those things cystic fibrosis is
[1:20:57] because of protein or saying doesn't the
[1:20:59] cystic fibroid that's a Sickle Cell uh
[1:21:03] anemia in your body it's because
[1:21:04] something's not folding right
[1:21:06] that's why I have people it's that
[1:21:08] simple things don't fold right you know
[1:21:10] anyway I'll put that on the chat no
[1:21:14] the most complex thing you build the
[1:21:16] space shuttle nothing compared to what's
[1:21:17] going on in here
[1:21:19] and people think that's a great
[1:21:20] achievement yet we have life in these
[1:21:22] bodies and God just said let there be
[1:21:24] and here we are
[1:21:25] we're fearfully and wonderfully made you
[1:21:28] know and and and and but these five
[1:21:30] senses aren't here to contact God but
[1:21:32] Faith contacts God and God gives you
[1:21:34] that Faith to contact him
[1:21:36] amen why because he wants we want his
[1:21:38] attention but he wants our attention
[1:21:41] I trust he's got your attention even
[1:21:43] today
[1:21:44] amen we want to be we want to have
[1:21:46] forgiveness
[1:21:48] and not to be reminded of our mistakes
[1:21:50] and failings
[1:21:51] you want God to bring up remember if he
[1:21:54] wanted to he could have a perfect record
[1:21:56] every moment of every day every thought
[1:21:58] every emotion every look everything and
[1:22:01] just have it perfectly
[1:22:03] but he takes his blood
[1:22:05] and he puts that in the sea of his
[1:22:06] forgetfulness and what makes God one of
[1:22:09] the things makes him so great is he has
[1:22:10] the ability to forget
[1:22:13] hello that's why the things are so vexus
[1:22:15] in our spirit sometimes he's forgiven us
[1:22:17] of them but you say we say Lord forgive
[1:22:19] me that I did this and he looks in his
[1:22:21] book
[1:22:22] he looks in his uh record
[1:22:25] this is the only blank page I can wait I
[1:22:27] have one
[1:22:28] you know he looks at his he looks at his
[1:22:31] record of your life because he's like
[1:22:32] he's like you know he's like hold on
[1:22:34] what are you what are you asking about
[1:22:35] and he doesn't do it this way so hey
[1:22:37] Angel you know whatever your name is go
[1:22:39] get the record of their life because
[1:22:40] they're asking me to forgive them about
[1:22:42] such and such and I can't remember that
[1:22:44] the angel gets out of the book and says
[1:22:45] you're right Lord
[1:22:47] it's gone and the only word that's
[1:22:49] written across your book is actually
[1:22:50] pardoned by the blood of Jesus Christ
[1:22:52] but then we take a blank page and we
[1:22:54] want to make it such a big thing
[1:22:57] Let It Go
[1:22:58] if you have confessed it sincerely unto
[1:23:00] the blood of Jesus Christ made right
[1:23:01] whatever you need to make right God will
[1:23:03] tell you if you need to do just let it
[1:23:05] go because God don't remember why should
[1:23:07] we you say well why is it in my mind I
[1:23:10] think God allows us to remember these
[1:23:11] things that we remain thankful
[1:23:13] thank God I'm not that person thank God
[1:23:15] I don't have that weight on me anymore
[1:23:16] I'm free indeed
[1:23:19] Hallelujah
[1:23:20] amen so we should never remind one
[1:23:22] another of our past mistakes and
[1:23:24] failings
[1:23:26] amen because we don't want to
[1:23:28] be reminded we want nothing to come
[1:23:31] between us
[1:23:33] praise God we want nothing to come
[1:23:35] between us there should be nothing
[1:23:36] between our soul and our savior right
[1:23:38] there should be nothing between spouses

[1:23:42] this what you want from your husbands
[1:23:44] amen you want to be you want to you want
[1:23:47] to be led
[1:23:49] you want to have leadership

[1:23:53] goes to work but there's actually a
[1:23:54] vision for the family yeah yo yo yo
[1:23:57] there's a vision this is what we want to
[1:23:58] do this year this is what we want maybe
[1:24:00] maybe even a natural thing hey we want
[1:24:02] to buy a house we want to do this
[1:24:03] project we want a god holiday here there
[1:24:05] should be a you know there should be a
[1:24:07] vision projected we want to get closer
[1:24:09] to the Lord we want to know each other
[1:24:11] better the other you know there should
[1:24:12] be that kind of leadership in the home
[1:24:14] amen we want to be treasured
[1:24:17] not taken for granted
[1:24:19] we want to be treasured who wants to be
[1:24:20] treasured by God
[1:24:22] you're the apple of his eye you're the
[1:24:24] jewel in his crown you're his greatest
[1:24:26] achievement
[1:24:28] amen you're his greatest achievement
[1:24:30] look what calvary's achieved he may not
[1:24:34] it may be a bit underwhelming in your
[1:24:36] mind now but wait till you gathered
[1:24:37] around the throat I could I pray I can
[1:24:39] say the same thing I say look what
[1:24:40] Calvary achieved maybe he he would say
[1:24:43] it to us look what my blood has done
[1:24:45] look what my sacrifice has done here you
[1:24:47] are you're on your way to Darkness but I
[1:24:48] said Satan you can't touch one of my
[1:24:50] children you may lead them for a season
[1:24:53] in life but there came a time when I
[1:24:55] Quicken them to my word I draw them to
[1:24:57] myself and now here they are redeemed
[1:24:59] because they're because they have a gene
[1:25:01] seed of God in them
[1:25:03] Hallelujah
[1:25:04] hey man brother Brown sees more about
[1:25:06] the Jane seed of God in his last few
[1:25:08] Services he does his entire Ministry
[1:25:09] because he's wanting us to see that
[1:25:11] we're a gene seed of God we're part of
[1:25:13] him amen so we want to be treasured
[1:25:15] we're his jewels
[1:25:18] Hallelujah
[1:25:19] amen some of you are looking at me like
[1:25:21] really yeah really we need to have the
[1:25:24] mind of Christ
[1:25:25] we need to think about ourselves as
[1:25:27] Christ thinks about us we need to think
[1:25:29] about one another as he thinks about us
[1:25:31] if you have his Spirit you have his mind
[1:25:34] amen because the devil always tries to
[1:25:37] tell us we're not worth anything
[1:25:39] I've had people tell me that the reason
[1:25:42] they didn't have children is because
[1:25:43] well we just one big part of a gene pool
[1:25:48] thank you science
[1:25:49] they were working in science
[1:25:51] really
[1:25:52] no God doesn't look at you just a gene
[1:25:54] pool
[1:25:56] you know just this big gene pool of
[1:25:58] humanity God doesn't view you like that
[1:26:00] God views you as a as a part of himself
[1:26:03] one of his sons and daughters you're
[1:26:05] very special to him if that's all you
[1:26:07] get out of the service you're special to
[1:26:09] God
[1:26:10] you're not a special case you're special
[1:26:12] to him that's a very different thing
[1:26:15] we want to be wanted
[1:26:18] we don't want to be tankered for granted
[1:26:20] you know comes a time while we're
[1:26:22] married this is this and you know
[1:26:23] someone says a joke you know you know
[1:26:26] your wife was um complaining you know
[1:26:28] you know you know they're having
[1:26:29] counseling whatever and said you know my
[1:26:31] husband never tells me that he loves me
[1:26:32] and he just said well I told her when we
[1:26:34] got engaged and got married and if it
[1:26:36] changes I'll let her know they've been
[1:26:38] married for decades it should never be
[1:26:39] their way you know every time the spirit
[1:26:41] of God comes
[1:26:42] and the word becomes alive God's saying
[1:26:45] I love you I love you I treasure you
[1:26:48] you're mine I Delight in you you're
[1:26:51] everything to me I can't live without
[1:26:53] you Hallelujah you're the reason I'm the
[1:26:57] reason am I being is actually because of
[1:26:58] you my thoughts are towards you of Peace
[1:27:00] you come to an expected end Hallelujah
[1:27:02] what's that end you'll be around the
[1:27:04] throne Eternal when the devil's not even
[1:27:06] Cinders and Ashes you'll still be
[1:27:09] Hallelujah you're gonna realize that
[1:27:10] when the word you know something bless
[1:27:12] you in the scripture God saying I love
[1:27:13] you I care for you
[1:27:16] amen
[1:27:19] this is a bit mushy no it's not mushy
[1:27:21] you we believe in heartfelt religion
[1:27:24] around this place
[1:27:26] probably so we want to be wanted amen we
[1:27:28] don't want to be taken for granted we
[1:27:31] don't just want to be a you know someone
[1:27:33] who washes the dishes I'm like
[1:27:34] separation well this is you know we
[1:27:36] don't want a working relationship
[1:27:37] this is your job description this is my
[1:27:39] job you keep your description I'll keep
[1:27:41] the mind in this business will run fine
[1:27:43] now this is not how this works
[1:27:45] I know there's a heartfelt love a
[1:27:47] Oneness of Body Soul and Spirit
[1:27:49] amen between husband and wife
[1:27:52] praise the Lord
[1:27:54] Hallelujah who's happy so far are we
[1:27:55] okay this this shouldn't shock anyone
[1:27:57] okay this this should not be shocking
[1:27:59] say well I've heard this before good
[1:28:01] praise a lot because remember the the
[1:28:04] family because remember God brother Ram
[1:28:06] said when Adam and Eva put in the garden
[1:28:08] God said this is my masterpiece he had a
[1:28:12] masterpiece family in the garden
[1:28:14] so what is he doing he's rebuilding
[1:28:16] Masterpiece families
[1:28:18] praise the lord we know ultimately the
[1:28:20] Masterpiece he was the first part Christ
[1:28:22] was the first part of the Masterpiece
[1:28:24] brother Ram says that now for two
[1:28:26] thousand years he's been making the
[1:28:27] second part of his Masterpiece what's
[1:28:29] that the E the second Eve as Christ was
[1:28:32] the second Adam so we are the second Eve
[1:28:34] amen but now that Masterpiece is not
[1:28:36] just the bride collectively around the
[1:28:38] world for seven Church ages and Christ
[1:28:40] that Masterpiece should be reflected in
[1:28:43] your home
[1:28:44] of a perfect Oneness
[1:28:46] perfect relationship Amen in spite of
[1:28:49] trouble strain whatever more there
[1:28:51] should be a perfect Oneness in the home
[1:28:54] between husband and wife amen remember
[1:28:56] because love must be tested
[1:28:58] Faith must be tested see it's it's easy
[1:29:01] to say you believe when there's Miracles
[1:29:03] maybe we're just having a Sunday night
[1:29:04] at camp and God just pours himself out I
[1:29:06] believe everything Lord
[1:29:08] but when you pray and it seems like
[1:29:10] nothing's answered do you still believe
[1:29:13] that's when faith is actually tested
[1:29:15] that's when it's actually proven to see
[1:29:18] what's within you that you say I don't
[1:29:20] see anything happening but do you still
[1:29:22] believe
[1:29:23] remember Jesus said blessed are those
[1:29:25] who don't see yet belief
[1:29:29] Hallelujah so Faith must be tested love
[1:29:32] must be tested amen but
[1:29:34] we have been built to to overcome every
[1:29:38] test
[1:29:40] amen now
[1:29:42] brother M tells the story of two married
[1:29:44] couple I mean two two couples that he
[1:29:46] married one I don't have their first
[1:29:48] account of it but this is from
[1:29:50] um this from the door inside the door in
[1:29:52] 1960 this is the second property but he
[1:29:54] married a very wealthy couple
[1:29:56] and then he married a very poor couple
[1:29:58] the wealthy couple was they lived in a
[1:30:00] big mansion on the hill but the poor
[1:30:02] couple they lived in a boxcar that they
[1:30:04] turned into a house so so they made a
[1:30:06] tiny home
[1:30:07] raised a lot they've made a tiny home
[1:30:09] but I your one's way better than this
[1:30:11] one
[1:30:13] but you know so but then uh later he
[1:30:15] said I'm gonna go check up on this you
[1:30:17] know you're on these two couples so so
[1:30:18] he goes up to the big mansion and he
[1:30:20] hears them you know fussing and fighting
[1:30:22] and yelling because you know they had
[1:30:24] been out partying the night before and
[1:30:25] she was dancing with some other man and
[1:30:27] he was jealous and all the stuff going
[1:30:29] on and you know but but then when he
[1:30:32] came to throw a knock you know it all
[1:30:34] went quiet opened the door and they were
[1:30:35] hit you're hand in hand how you doing
[1:30:37] it's oh we're doing really well and so
[1:30:39] it's all manufactured because behind
[1:30:41] closed doors they are fighting like cats
[1:30:43] and dogs B they put on a Persona when
[1:30:46] someone else comes along we shouldn't be
[1:30:48] that way
[1:30:49] what you see is what you should get
[1:30:51] right Hallelujah behind closed doors in
[1:30:55] the public we should be the same
[1:30:57] Hallelujah sure there may be trouble
[1:30:59] we're not immune from trouble and
[1:31:00] misunderstandings
[1:31:03] but God gives us Grace to overcome those
[1:31:06] things and work through them and when
[1:31:07] you work further you should be closer
[1:31:09] together than you were in the very
[1:31:11] beginning
[1:31:12] praise the Lord amen so then he saw
[1:31:15] those two
[1:31:16] he said as manufactured it'll never last
[1:31:18] but then he thought well I'll go down
[1:31:20] and look at this couple who's married uh
[1:31:22] and they and they live in the boxcar
[1:31:24] she said now now this to me this
[1:31:26] encapsulates my whole sermon okay he
[1:31:28] says now one day I thought I'd find out
[1:31:30] what become of this couple I'd live uh
[1:31:32] I'd married and lived in a boxcar so I
[1:31:34] was working for the Public Service
[1:31:35] Company I was a lineman there for 17
[1:31:38] years I went out on the river and kind
[1:31:40] of played the part of a hypocrite put on
[1:31:42] my spurs on for
[1:31:43] um on and safety and went walking down
[1:31:45] along the river like I was watching
[1:31:47] polls I slipped up and I seen his old
[1:31:50] Chevrolet out there with the headlights
[1:31:52] wide on with baling wire and I went up
[1:31:54] towards the door I heard them talking
[1:31:56] and he just got him a job off the pwa or
[1:32:00] what it was they worked on there and it
[1:32:02] worked at some lumber company that was
[1:32:04] making eight or ten dollars a week that
[1:32:06] was pretty good money
[1:32:08] and uh he had that taken that old boxcar
[1:32:10] put newspapers up and tacky buttons he
[1:32:13] asked a question who knows what a tacky
[1:32:14] button is he says well what part of
[1:32:15] Kentucky are you from he says now take
[1:32:17] car board put a tack in it and push it
[1:32:20] in the wall and paper and newspapers he
[1:32:22] had brought down some old boxes and they
[1:32:24] had made a table out of it but brother
[1:32:26] if I'd ever found heaven on Earth it it
[1:32:28] was
[1:32:30] she was sitting on his lap
[1:32:32] he had his old hat out mashed uh uh the
[1:32:35] top of it in had poured his paycheck out
[1:32:38] and they had so much there laying here
[1:32:40] for food so much for insurance and so
[1:32:42] much he said honey I want to get you
[1:32:44] that dress so bad I believe it was about
[1:32:47] a dollar
[1:32:48] and a quarter something like that she
[1:32:50] said but honey I appreciate that one arm
[1:32:52] around him like that and he looked up at
[1:32:54] her and I was standing there like a
[1:32:56] hypocrite watching you know and so they
[1:32:58] begin to count this money out and they
[1:33:00] didn't have enough to go all the way
[1:33:02] around he said well I worked till I've
[1:33:04] been working so hard the little dress
[1:33:05] hangs in the window there it's a dollar
[1:33:07] and a quarter
[1:33:09] couldn't we just get the um couldn't we
[1:33:10] just let the insurance go something she
[1:33:12] said no honey I appreciate it oh he just
[1:33:14] put his arms around her and I stood up
[1:33:16] and turned uh um around this way looked
[1:33:18] up on the top of the hill I could see
[1:33:20] the house of the other the Steeples on
[1:33:22] top of the house I thought which is the
[1:33:23] rich man which one would you want to
[1:33:25] take Billy if you're going to take your
[1:33:27] choice let me have a real true wife one
[1:33:30] that loves me let me live down here in a
[1:33:31] boxcar for I tell you happiness and
[1:33:34] contentment money cannot buy money
[1:33:36] cannot buy love it's the real things now
[1:33:39] now let's just break this down here now
[1:33:42] this is a great secret to a successful
[1:33:44] marriage and family now it's obvious
[1:33:46] that they are content with their
[1:33:47] positions that's not that's not a
[1:33:49] surprise to anyone right you know
[1:33:50] because we know the Bible says that it
[1:33:52] says in first Thessalonians 6 perverse
[1:33:54] disputings or maybe it's Timothy so I've
[1:33:56] just got a t oh yeah Timothy First
[1:33:58] Timothy six and five perverse disputings
[1:34:00] of men of crop minds and destitute of
[1:34:02] the truth supposing that gain is
[1:34:04] godliness from such withdraw thyself so
[1:34:07] people who preach as Prosperity Doctrine
[1:34:10] and say if you're rich then then God's
[1:34:13] blessed you and it's godliness we just
[1:34:15] read that that's a lie
[1:34:16] I mean it's supposing gainer's godliness
[1:34:19] from such withdraw themselves as people
[1:34:21] of crap Minds The destitute of the truth
[1:34:22] says but godliness with contentment is
[1:34:25] great gain all right man and contentment
[1:34:28] means a state a state of happiness and
[1:34:31] satisfaction
[1:34:33] he says for we brought nothing into this
[1:34:35] world and is certain we carry nothing
[1:34:37] out and having food and Raymond let us
[1:34:39] therefore be content now contentment
[1:34:42] when it comes to world I mean your
[1:34:43] material Goods really stems from a a a a
[1:34:47] a a a a emotional contentment
[1:34:50] within the home
[1:34:51] remember because your uh Brothers we're
[1:34:53] not here just to supply the physical
[1:34:55] needs of our family but the emotional
[1:34:56] needs and they're actually more
[1:34:58] important than the money needs right
[1:35:00] because because you can supply
[1:35:02] everything under the Sun but there's no
[1:35:04] emotional connection with the family no
[1:35:06] relationship that will do that will
[1:35:08] amount to nothing
[1:35:09] I mean but if there's a real good solid
[1:35:12] relationship between husband and wife
[1:35:13] between between parents and children
[1:35:15] emotional needs are being met amen then
[1:35:19] that is that that is an incredible thing
[1:35:22] but the world doesn't you know that's
[1:35:24] why there's so much mental health
[1:35:26] trouble in this country is because
[1:35:28] families do not know how to connect with
[1:35:30] one another
[1:35:31] it's all about just just entertainment
[1:35:34] and and and worldly positions and having
[1:35:37] a good time but there's no depth of
[1:35:38] relationship
[1:35:40] I'm in between between husband and wife
[1:35:42] and between parents and children
[1:35:44] I mean so it's very you know it's very
[1:35:46] um it's very easy to see that they're
[1:35:49] content in in what they have
[1:35:53] so we should never complain about how
[1:35:55] little we have or how tight our budget
[1:35:57] is because if we begin to do that we
[1:35:59] forget the blessings we have already so
[1:36:01] we should never ever complain well I
[1:36:03] can't do this I can't buy this I can't
[1:36:04] do this I can't afford this it's not
[1:36:06] what it's about if you focus on those
[1:36:08] things and how much money you do not
[1:36:10] have then you miss the blessings you
[1:36:12] have right so we should never complain
[1:36:14] about having not enough money we should
[1:36:16] be thankful for what God has given us
[1:36:17] and remember God owns everything
[1:36:20] right he owns this Earth he owns the
[1:36:22] cattle on a thousand hills and the Hills
[1:36:25] and all the precious metals underneath
[1:36:26] and all these here in the uh you know he
[1:36:29] he owns every element
[1:36:31] he has an unlimited bank account
[1:36:34] and he gives you what you need from that
[1:36:36] bank account you gotta trust that he'll
[1:36:38] provide your needs not your wants but
[1:36:39] your needs he will look after you he
[1:36:41] looks after The Sparrows and the
[1:36:43] whatevers you're worth more than many
[1:36:44] sparrows the Lord Jesus said so never
[1:36:46] ever look at the restrictions of life
[1:36:49] when it comes to material things but
[1:36:51] just be thankful for what you have
[1:36:53] right and never let that dictate your
[1:36:56] life it should be your love and joy and
[1:36:57] the Holy Ghost should be the thing that
[1:36:58] drives your life and God will look after
[1:37:01] the rest
[1:37:02] amen now because it says in Philippians
[1:37:04] 4 19 but my God shall supply all your
[1:37:07] need according to his riches and Glory
[1:37:09] by Christ Jesus so he'll Supply our
[1:37:10] needs
[1:37:11] Hallelujah but you see but their
[1:37:13] happiness and love is based more on on
[1:37:16] more than that contentment
[1:37:18] it's actually the husband is actually in
[1:37:20] his god-given position in the
[1:37:22] relationship see he loves his wife now
[1:37:25] he showed it by being unselfish with any
[1:37:27] extra money they might have so he wasn't
[1:37:30] saying now look this is for them food
[1:37:31] this is for the insurance and now this
[1:37:33] extra bit well I want to have a selfish
[1:37:35] hobby that excludes you from my life
[1:37:37] he didn't talk like that
[1:37:39] right he was saying no honey I want to
[1:37:41] give this extra bit I want to buy you
[1:37:43] this dress
[1:37:45] right now this is showing
[1:37:47] by because he's thinking of her welfare
[1:37:49] before himself
[1:37:51] right he's not interested in he wants
[1:37:53] his wife to have a dress he wants her to
[1:37:55] be pretty he wants because the thing is
[1:37:57] when we give those things to our wives
[1:37:58] we they feel more treasured
[1:38:02] hey if God gives us a great camper a
[1:38:04] great service don't you feel more
[1:38:05] treasured
[1:38:07] right so so same so it should be now
[1:38:09] physically right now I'm not a gift
[1:38:12] person so I said Lord see I I preached
[1:38:14] myself mother I preach to you people
[1:38:16] right but we want our wives to feel
[1:38:19] treasured
[1:38:20] not just you know not just part of the
[1:38:22] furniture but there are all they're our
[1:38:25] world
[1:38:26] praise God
[1:38:27] so he expresses it by he thinks about
[1:38:30] her and her well-being and her needs
[1:38:32] before her his own
[1:38:34] and also he includes her in the decision
[1:38:36] making
[1:38:38] he said well I'm the head of this family
[1:38:39] I'm Sovereign no no remember the wife
[1:38:42] has part of your brain
[1:38:45] sometimes it's a greater portion than
[1:38:47] the one we possess
[1:38:51] okay I'll just anyway that's how I feel
[1:38:53] about me but but you see he was
[1:38:55] including her in the decision making
[1:38:58] because he didn't say nut I'm gonna
[1:39:00] cancel the insurance we don't need it we
[1:39:02] trust God blah blah blah you know I'm
[1:39:03] gonna buy this for you no he included
[1:39:05] her in the decision making so she is
[1:39:07] feeling that her input mattered that her
[1:39:10] her life not just her keeping the boxcar
[1:39:12] tidy and whatever and doing the dishes
[1:39:14] and feeding no but her emotional and her
[1:39:16] mental input into the marriage mattered
[1:39:19] and that's how she feel even more valued
[1:39:21] who's following me today
[1:39:23] amen so so he brought her into the
[1:39:26] decision-making process and he genuinely
[1:39:29] was was he didn't just do it out of a
[1:39:31] show or trying to earn some brownie
[1:39:34] points he genuinely wanted to buy her
[1:39:35] the dress and cancel the insurance but
[1:39:37] because she said uh no keep that well
[1:39:41] you know whatever you know he respected
[1:39:43] what
[1:39:44] she was saying
[1:39:47] we have to remember that that part of
[1:39:49] our brain is not in our bodies
[1:39:52] right we have to bring there should be a
[1:39:54] Oneness in decisions
[1:39:56] amen shouldn't just be the husband plows
[1:39:59] on does what he wants and disregards the
[1:40:00] wife no there should be a Oneness in
[1:40:02] decisions
[1:40:03] amen
[1:40:05] is that okay
[1:40:06] they say that's modern thinking no
[1:40:08] that's perfect Oneness
[1:40:10] amen God says to Moses I'm going to wipe
[1:40:14] out Israel
[1:40:15] what does Moses do stands in the Gap
[1:40:17] remember what you promised and remember
[1:40:18] what you've done
[1:40:19] he actually brought Moses into the
[1:40:21] decision making if I can put it that way
[1:40:23] Moses is the bride of Christ and he
[1:40:25] stood in the gap for Israel and they
[1:40:28] weren't asking Moses can you pray for us
[1:40:30] because God's going to deal with us no
[1:40:31] God just revealed the secret to his
[1:40:33] bride if I put it that way I'm going to
[1:40:35] wipe these I'm sick of These Guys these
[1:40:37] guys are being a pain to you
[1:40:39] because they were
[1:40:40] no he he God told Moses that and Moses
[1:40:45] said no but Lord remember your word and
[1:40:47] what you've done whatever and it said
[1:40:48] Moses God repented of what he was going
[1:40:50] to do he changed his if I say God can
[1:40:52] God change his mind well God stood on
[1:40:54] the breach and Moses and you know
[1:40:57] amen it was Christ and Moses interceding
[1:40:59] for the people of Israel right but but
[1:41:01] God didn't just just wipe out Israel and
[1:41:03] say and then Moses wakes up one morning
[1:41:05] where's or where's all these 12 tribes
[1:41:07] gone and God says oh I'm starting with
[1:41:09] you no he brought Moses into the
[1:41:12] decision-making process is that okay
[1:41:14] he interceded amen you know God says I'm
[1:41:17] gonna go wipe outside him Abraham says
[1:41:18] what if you find 50.
[1:41:20] because God said to Abraham well before
[1:41:22] he says Sing Abraham's my friend will
[1:41:25] will I withhold from whom what I'm about
[1:41:27] to do
[1:41:28] he's actually God brought him into this
[1:41:30] is actually my plan this is what I'm
[1:41:31] doing this is why the message because
[1:41:33] we're the bride we actually see this
[1:41:35] world is falling apart and we say well
[1:41:37] God told us this ages ago
[1:41:39] you know well the prophet preached on
[1:41:41] this he told me in through the Prophet
[1:41:42] this is what's going on and we're not
[1:41:44] surprised by it
[1:41:46] we don't have to go on some YouTube
[1:41:47] conspiracy theory to see what's going on
[1:41:49] we've already been told it's been
[1:41:51] sitting on tape for 50 odd years it's
[1:41:54] been sitting there oh you know people
[1:41:56] say have you seen what's on stuff or
[1:41:58] what's on NCAA Herald or Radio New
[1:41:59] Zealand news or whatever today I said no
[1:42:01] no I read it eight years ago
[1:42:03] that's actually those reporters are slow
[1:42:05] man my one's way better than them
[1:42:08] amen why because God just like he said
[1:42:11] to Abraham will I withhold from Abraham
[1:42:13] what I'm about to do well he actually
[1:42:15] because God was Abraham was a friend of
[1:42:17] God God actually told him this is what
[1:42:20] I'm about to do and this is this is how
[1:42:22] we should be leading our families
[1:42:23] families this is what we're about to do
[1:42:25] this is what I'm gonna do and then of
[1:42:27] course Abraham began to intercede
[1:42:28] because lot was down there what if you
[1:42:30] find 50 he goes down and down and down
[1:42:32] and then Lotus daughters were pulled out
[1:42:34] and his wife and so on
[1:42:36] so you know we can't just go on like
[1:42:38] dictators and not not give any respect
[1:42:41] and honor to the other other part of our
[1:42:43] brain
[1:42:46] praise God
[1:42:48] amen what does that do it makes us feel
[1:42:50] makes our wives or even husbands feel
[1:42:52] valued
[1:42:54] right because remember
[1:42:57] we are the manifestation of God's heart
[1:43:01] right and you're seeing a you're seeing
[1:43:03] a marriage
[1:43:04] the wife can be fallen apart and the
[1:43:06] husband can look like he's got it all
[1:43:07] together
[1:43:08] but really what's on the inside of him
[1:43:10] is being manifested on her
[1:43:13] right this is how just like that sister
[1:43:15] I say against Africa on the point of
[1:43:17] death
[1:43:18] because but but he looked fine
[1:43:21] but because he wasn't in his position
[1:43:22] what was going on in him obviously he I
[1:43:24] know what he was doing in the Congo he
[1:43:25] said he was doing business but I didn't
[1:43:27] really believe him
[1:43:28] um but you know but what was going on in
[1:43:30] him was manifesting on her
[1:43:32] and it's the same thing with us you know
[1:43:34] the man can look like he's got it all
[1:43:35] together
[1:43:36] but the wife's falling apart so what's
[1:43:38] in him is on the outside of her you'll
[1:43:41] you'll follow what I'm trying to say
[1:43:42] amen because men can hide things for a
[1:43:45] lot better we can we can hide our
[1:43:46] emotions we're more stoic but just comes
[1:43:49] out of the wife
[1:43:50] amen that's why you know brother M said
[1:43:52] now the you see the state of the church
[1:43:54] you look at the sisters in the church
[1:43:56] and then people have taken that in the
[1:43:58] past say woman you better line up
[1:43:59] because we're the bride of Christ but
[1:44:01] Brother Brad never preached a sermon is
[1:44:03] your wife worthy of the Gospel he
[1:44:05] preached is your life worthy of of the
[1:44:08] Gospel
[1:44:09] right so so if things are falling apart
[1:44:11] on the outside it's because Lord you've
[1:44:13] got to do something on the inside here
[1:44:15] I'm not in my position sure we'll have
[1:44:17] troubles and you know things and we'll
[1:44:18] go through things right but Lord there's
[1:44:21] something going on in here speaking of
[1:44:23] my own family now you know if
[1:44:25] something's going on there then it's got
[1:44:26] something's going on here first
[1:44:28] so Lord help me in here that there's
[1:44:30] good
[1:44:31] praise the Lord
[1:44:33] amen but many times people put pressure
[1:44:35] on the wife you've got to line up and do
[1:44:36] this and no no no you've got to line up
[1:44:39] there's something in you you've let
[1:44:41] creeper and some Idol some you know your
[1:44:43] affections have gone sideways trouble
[1:44:44] whatever it is you're gonna come back in
[1:44:47] humility and say Lord
[1:44:49] I want my family I want my family to
[1:44:51] come back in line and my relationship
[1:44:52] all these different things
[1:44:54] praise God
[1:44:56] Hallelujah
[1:44:58] so friends
[1:44:59] as we as we leave it about there do you
[1:45:02] want perfect Oneness in your home your
[1:45:04] perfect one between you and your spouse
[1:45:05] do you want to dwell husbands with them
[1:45:07] according to knowledge you know one of
[1:45:09] the greatest things you know people say
[1:45:11] an abusive husband I mean and an abusive
[1:45:14] father
[1:45:15] is a problem actually no a a father
[1:45:18] that's distant and negligent can be just
[1:45:21] as bad
[1:45:22] and that will imprint on children and
[1:45:24] then when they come to and they get
[1:45:26] married those same complexes now
[1:45:28] manifest in the marriage
[1:45:30] right but now as husbands we're going to
[1:45:31] realize and and wives too we're going to
[1:45:33] realize that that we bring a lot of
[1:45:35] baggage with us
[1:45:38] right a lot of bags we don't pack
[1:45:40] ourselves
[1:45:41] you know it's not like get on the
[1:45:42] airline they ask you a question did you
[1:45:43] pack these bags you enter into a
[1:45:45] marriage and did you pack these bags a
[1:45:46] lot of them say no I didn't want that
[1:45:48] complex I didn't want that trouble I
[1:45:50] didn't want a a distant father that
[1:45:52] didn't show his love for me especially
[1:45:54] that's so harmful for daughters because
[1:45:55] they begin to realize am I valued do I
[1:45:58] matter do I do I actually matter in this
[1:46:00] marriage am I part of the family am I
[1:46:02] actually or you know you know where's my
[1:46:04] standing with you because I never knew
[1:46:05] that from their father so now it's
[1:46:07] imprinted upon them but thanks be to God
[1:46:09] that God can Minister through the
[1:46:10] husband in such a way to take that out
[1:46:12] of the wife
[1:46:13] probably that she can become stable she
[1:46:15] can become you know knowing who she is
[1:46:18] comfortable in her position comfortable
[1:46:19] in her role in the home and all those
[1:46:21] things why because of the husbands in
[1:46:22] his position she'll come into her
[1:46:24] position amen but we've got to look at
[1:46:26] the scripture and not look at the
[1:46:28] problem
[1:46:29] remember the problem is not the solution
[1:46:31] the word is the solution I surrendered
[1:46:34] life to the word is the solution to
[1:46:36] every problem
[1:46:37] praise God
[1:46:39] I mean should I read that list one more
[1:46:41] time and then I'll then the actually as
[1:46:43] the musicians come up or read this list
[1:46:44] one more time so we want unconditional
[1:46:47] love
[1:46:48] I love that is not shared with another
[1:46:50] acceptance of Who We Are we want to be
[1:46:54] understood we want Security in the
[1:46:56] relationship provision we want comfort
[1:46:59] a relationship that's unique to us alone
[1:47:02] it's not to to to to our buddies or
[1:47:05] whatever more you know that our spouse
[1:47:06] should be our best friend that we can
[1:47:08] share our deepest desires Ambitions
[1:47:10] dreams and fears worth
[1:47:12] we want attention
[1:47:14] we want forgiveness and not to be
[1:47:16] reminded of our mistakes and failings we
[1:47:18] want nothing to come between us we want
[1:47:20] leadership we want to be treasured we
[1:47:21] want to be wanted we want to be valued
[1:47:24] and that's what our wives want from us
[1:47:26] Brothers
[1:47:28] amen
[1:47:29] so
[1:47:31] praise the Lord
[1:47:32] we know what women want
[1:47:34] could write a self-help book and make
[1:47:36] millions
[1:47:37] but it's already in the Bible
[1:47:39] but it's that simple you know what you
[1:47:41] want from God then you know what your
[1:47:43] husband I mean your wife wants from you
[1:47:44] and then you can take advice Versa and
[1:47:47] then we won't know what God wants from
[1:47:49] us
