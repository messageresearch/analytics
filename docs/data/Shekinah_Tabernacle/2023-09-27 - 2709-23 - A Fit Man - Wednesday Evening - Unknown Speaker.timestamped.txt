[24:23] amen praise the Lord God bless you all
[24:26] this morning thank you David thank you
[24:28] musicians very good
[24:31] I think they always get nervous when I'm
[24:33] sitting in the
[24:35] seats
[24:37] and whenever something goes wrong they
[24:39] all quite a few of them look over
[24:41] towards me oh no
[24:45] how are you all this evening you good
[24:48] that's good it's good to be here do you
[24:50] know I actually um
[24:52] I don't have an opening scripture
[24:55] I know
[24:58] but we got we've got scriptures but I
[25:01] just
[25:02] because I don't really want to say what
[25:03] it's about at the start
[25:05] it's just the way that it's a God I'm
[25:07] not trying to be like different or
[25:08] anything but I just tried to put one in
[25:09] and I didn't really get any I couldn't
[25:11] put any in there but but we are
[25:13] preaching the word of God
[25:15] and you know we don't like to venture
[25:16] out without any Authority so
[25:19] um
[25:21] um let's you can actually you can have
[25:22] your seats
[25:23] now
[25:27] um
[25:28] because I've got I've got a little
[25:29] thought that if I kind of I just want to
[25:31] tell a story and it's
[25:33] it's
[25:35] going to end up in a Bible story but I
[25:38] don't really want to say what it's about
[25:39] at the start and then that's not to try
[25:40] and trick you or to get you into a
[25:42] little place and
[25:43] tie you in knots or anything but it's
[25:45] just you know sometimes in our walk with
[25:47] God we
[25:48] sometimes actually don't quite know
[25:50] sometimes where we are and we just have
[25:52] to go by faith
[25:54] you know we sometimes we get the answers
[25:56] and we understand and we can see clearly
[25:57] other times we we just don't know at all
[26:00] or was that just me
[26:02] so
[26:05] you know brother Brandon would do this
[26:07] quite a bit he would talk about a story
[26:08] like he would dramatize Maybe
[26:11] um
[26:12] Nathaniel and Philip you know he would
[26:13] although there's just a small snippet in
[26:15] the Bible about them he would sort of
[26:18] take the backstory I suppose and
[26:19] dramatize what it would be like and
[26:21] maybe what the weeks before that were in
[26:23] the months before and how they were
[26:24] friends and all what they would do and
[26:25] then then he would wind up in the five
[26:28] or so verses that we hear about them but
[26:30] you know it's just we're not adding to
[26:31] the word of God we just kind of you know
[26:33] we're just going about it that way so so
[26:35] I want to just take you on a bit of a
[26:37] journey with with a with the character
[26:39] and this character is not David by the
[26:42] way
[26:43] because you all thought it was David
[26:45] when you saw that
[26:46] but he wasn't the only one that had
[26:47] sheep in the Old Testament
[26:49] he wasn't the only Shepherd
[26:52] um
[26:53] and then you'll and then I'll end up
[26:55] somewhere and you'll you'll know where
[26:56] it is are you happy tonight you're good
[26:58] had a good week
[27:00] yeah it's good to see you all here I
[27:02] know you all quite well so it's and I
[27:04] know the different things you're going
[27:05] through and it's I feel privileged to
[27:08] be up here and to be able to minister
[27:09] humbled but but privilege that the Lord
[27:12] would allow me to just speak something
[27:13] speak some Faith you know because we
[27:15] just want we want we want to speak Faith
[27:18] because we that's we win every battle by
[27:21] faith and the word of God you know we
[27:22] want to speak Faith to the people and
[27:24] and encourage one another and walk
[27:26] forward you know we have enough negative
[27:27] things in our life day by day when we
[27:29] come together we want to just believe in
[27:31] faith and move forward and be be
[27:33] victorious we don't want anything
[27:34] negative or down or you know we're not
[27:37] into that we're just into moving forward
[27:38] and we're victorious in Christ who's
[27:40] victorious in Christ
[27:41] you're all winners when you accepted
[27:43] Christ you won The Greatest Prize there
[27:45] ever was you know so your your winners
[27:47] before you even need to start and get
[27:49] you were a winner
[27:50] in fact when you before you were born
[27:52] you were a winner
[27:53] you already won before you were born
[27:56] but
[27:58] so that's that's
[28:00] my thoughts on that so so this this
[28:02] character here
[28:06] he was a just a
[28:09] a
[28:10] boy that what that was from the children
[28:13] of Israel so he was brought up
[28:15] understanding the ways of God and in his
[28:17] heart he had a desire for the things of
[28:19] God and he always
[28:21] did enjoy
[28:22] rating the the Scrolls and the law and
[28:26] the the Psalms you know he would he
[28:28] would enjoy the things of God he had a
[28:30] heart for God it was it wasn't
[28:32] foreign to him or it wasn't something of
[28:34] a struggle he actually genuinely enjoyed
[28:36] just
[28:38] speaking about God and hearing that the
[28:40] priests speak about speak the word of
[28:41] God and talking to his parents about the
[28:43] Lord and he was quite an active boy
[28:47] so he would like to be outside more than
[28:50] he would like to be inside very active
[28:52] do you still like to run and
[28:54] play sports and ride donkeys and kick
[28:57] around with his mates
[28:59] you know it was an act of one of those
[29:00] active kids like Reuben
[29:05] well probably every story doesn't matter
[29:07] how which line you go which generation
[29:11] back a thousand years you know
[29:15] you know and um
[29:18] you know and he would he
[29:20] that his his village was in those days
[29:23] just small villages but
[29:25] I guess it wasn't too long before you're
[29:26] in the countryside and he would you know
[29:28] when he got a bit older he would venture
[29:30] out and go go go out to the the
[29:34] countryside there and maybe go to the
[29:35] bottom of the hills there and walk
[29:36] around and go out in the morning come
[29:38] back in the evening and he would enjoy
[29:40] running too often he'd often just run
[29:42] this and run there and run back he just
[29:44] enjoyed the fresh air and
[29:46] and that
[29:49] he would even sometimes I guess when he
[29:50] got a bit older would Camp a note or two
[29:52] out there and learn to
[29:54] live off the land but back in those days
[29:56] you'd almost naturally lived off the
[29:58] land more than you did now but you know
[30:00] he would go out be by himself and just
[30:02] be
[30:03] be uh
[30:05] energetic I suppose you'd say and when
[30:09] he got a bit older he was a hard worker
[30:11] he was a good man he would work hard he
[30:13] would you know wake up in the morning
[30:15] and do what if it was summer he would he
[30:18] would reap if it was Winter he would sow
[30:19] he wasn't one of those foolish sons that
[30:22] went when the
[30:24] you know you can't be bothered sowing
[30:26] the seed
[30:27] when it was time to sew
[30:29] and Solomon talked about that the
[30:31] fullest son that's like that and harvest
[30:32] he goes begging because he couldn't be
[30:34] bothered getting out of bed in the cold
[30:35] winter morning and plowing the ground
[30:37] and getting it all ready for the spring
[30:38] and sowing the seeds
[30:40] you know but this this this boys who
[30:42] grew up to be a man he
[30:45] he wasn't like that
[30:48] and um they they got to know him as
[30:51] being this quite an energetic man and I
[30:53] can imagine maybe in the village a
[30:55] brother would come back after being away
[30:58] for maybe a few years and he would say
[31:01] where is where is my
[31:03] where is my brother and he would say oh
[31:05] your brothers he's out in the way out in
[31:07] the fields there it was may have been a
[31:08] shepherd and so
[31:10] he would want to see his brother and
[31:11] they would say oh let's send we'll send
[31:12] this we know a man that can go out there
[31:15] and maybe the whole day run to where he
[31:16] was and tell him your brother's here
[31:17] come back to see him so he would always
[31:19] get the job of doing these errands
[31:20] because they knew that he was he was a
[31:22] like an energetic a fit guy you know and
[31:24] they would he would get the job of doing
[31:26] that
[31:27] you know and he would run out there and
[31:28] tell the brother after a whole day of
[31:30] running he'll get there and say hey your
[31:31] brother's here and he wants to see you
[31:33] he's arrived back after years and they
[31:34] would all make their way back
[31:37] or maybe maybe that's why maybe uh maybe
[31:40] a woman just gave birth and the husband
[31:42] was out doing the same thing out
[31:44] shepherding and so this man will get the
[31:46] job of of running out there and
[31:48] going and getting him and bringing them
[31:49] back in because he knew the land quite
[31:50] well he knew the different areas where
[31:51] they were
[31:52] and and he loved the Lord he had a heart
[31:55] for God he was he was he would study in
[31:58] the evenings and just read the word of
[31:59] God and and not just do it but apply it
[32:01] in his own life like all of you do he
[32:04] was just like you
[32:06] you all love the Lord you read the word
[32:08] of God you apply it to your life and
[32:09] that this was he was of the same
[32:12] nature the same attitude
[32:15] I suppose you would say
[32:17] then one day an older man
[32:21] we've been older than him
[32:25] he came to him with a request
[32:28] and before he said his requests he said
[32:31] I want to I want to tell you why I'm
[32:32] going to ask you this certain thing he
[32:33] said I was I got into some trouble you
[32:36] know about 10 10 years ago when I was
[32:38] when I when I was working that and I
[32:40] ended up buying a lot of money and I had
[32:41] to
[32:42] I had to go go off to a far country and
[32:44] and serve the person that I owed money
[32:47] to and for
[32:48] about eight years I had to serve there
[32:49] and I paid this this man off
[32:52] what I owed him
[32:54] and then
[32:56] the time as the time went by and my debt
[32:59] went down and down the time came that I
[33:00] could make my way back back home
[33:03] back here and the place where we were
[33:05] was was
[33:08] and I was it was way up over the hills
[33:09] way way way over there
[33:12] outside of where we live you know it
[33:13] wasn't it wasn't one of our people it
[33:15] was way over there and he said he said
[33:17] on the way back I I had to
[33:19] work for a bit longer because I had to
[33:21] pay money to another one of this rich
[33:23] man's friends that had a camel train and
[33:25] he was passing through and passing
[33:27] through our village and I had to so I
[33:28] caught a ride with that Camel train they
[33:29] wouldn't give it to me for free I had to
[33:31] keep working for this man to pay his
[33:33] other rich man the man he worked for was
[33:35] a just a very selfish rich man and the
[33:38] other the man that had the camel train
[33:40] was too and he said when we were going
[33:42] back we
[33:43] on the main trail we came across a
[33:46] little house and there was a family
[33:47] there and it
[33:49] there were Whispers around the camel
[33:51] train that actually this this man there
[33:52] actually also owed this
[33:54] the man that was running the camel train
[33:56] he owed him some money too and and he
[33:58] was going to collect it on his way
[33:59] through but the man had nothing really
[34:01] to give
[34:02] and all he had was a a little nanny goat
[34:06] so he didn't have much left
[34:08] and you know this rich man being a
[34:11] selfish man just thinking about himself
[34:13] in his own game didn't wouldn't didn't
[34:15] show any Mercy to this man and just said
[34:16] well if that's we've got to take that
[34:18] you know and
[34:20] and
[34:21] this man would watch that store scenario
[34:24] unfold and he he saw the merciless act
[34:28] that the rich man did just taking this
[34:29] guy's it was his last goat
[34:32] taking it away and
[34:34] if he he thought to himself you know if
[34:36] I had a if I had a hundred dollars in my
[34:38] pocket I'd buy the goat off the man and
[34:40] give it back but he didn't have anything
[34:42] he was he spent his last dollar his last
[34:44] money he could with the camel train
[34:47] and so
[34:49] but just as he was leaving he he said to
[34:51] the poor man that had just been this
[34:53] goat being taken he said look I I don't
[34:55] have any money I'd love to help you I
[34:56] can't do anything I can't really
[34:58] uh get upset at this man and probably
[35:00] throw me off the camel train and then
[35:02] you know I'll be
[35:03] even worse but he said look
[35:06] as much as what I can maybe when I get
[35:08] back to my Village I could ask around
[35:10] and try and borrow a little bit of money
[35:12] and I'll I'll buy this goat back I'll
[35:13] try and talk to the man before he
[35:15] carries on through and I'll I'll buy
[35:16] this goat back and he said
[35:18] I'll have to borrow money to buy it but
[35:20] but
[35:21] I'll get it into kid and when it has
[35:23] another little kid then I'll I'll bring
[35:25] a kid back to you
[35:27] now you just felt something on his heart
[35:28] I want to do that for you he was a
[35:31] I guess a good Christian man too and
[35:34] just in a in a moment of compassion
[35:37] so he said look leave this with me I'll
[35:38] try and do this
[35:40] so he did get back and when he got back
[35:42] to his village where this other man
[35:44] lived he
[35:46] managed to just scrape up enough money
[35:48] borrowed from different people to to
[35:50] he's to buy this goat from the Richmond
[35:52] he said I want to buy this that little
[35:53] goat so he
[35:55] they agreed on a price and he bought the
[35:57] goat and he followed through with what
[35:58] he said he he put the goat to a The
[36:00] Nanny to a billy goat and they had this
[36:02] little baby this kid and he let the kid
[36:04] you know grow up
[36:07] that's why I don't like calling our kids
[36:08] kids because the kid is a baby goat
[36:12] oh it's kind of say children
[36:15] because I don't really like referring to
[36:18] our children as baby goats
[36:20] but I know it's the probably not the
[36:22] same word but that there is a kid
[36:27] so he
[36:29] this kid grew up a little bit
[36:31] and it was time now we thought this kid
[36:33] this this little kid is big enough now
[36:35] that it can make the journey so he went
[36:37] to this man he said look that's the
[36:38] story and I've got this kid he said if
[36:40] anyone has the capacity to be able to
[36:42] take take this kid way back up way over
[36:44] those mountains to this man
[36:46] that's you you're the one I know you're
[36:48] fit I know you you you go out in the
[36:50] hills for a few days at a time and I
[36:52] know you're You're Made for This you can
[36:54] you've done this before so I would
[36:56] really appreciate you know I can't give
[36:58] you any money for it I don't I don't
[36:59] have anything I I just this is you know
[37:01] you know me I've been struggling since I
[37:03] got back but I just want to bring this
[37:05] kid back to the man
[37:08] he said would you do that for me and
[37:10] this man being a good man he said yeah
[37:12] I'll do that for you I can feel the
[37:15] the goodness the sweetness in the moment
[37:18] and in the story and I think you know I
[37:20] feel of the Lord this is a good thing to
[37:21] do I I can't see anything in me that
[37:23] would not want to help the situation and
[37:25] I've got the time and
[37:27] so
[37:28] he said yeah I'll do it now this little
[37:30] kid was a wee bit scattery a little bit
[37:32] a little bit frightened you know he was
[37:35] it would sort of run aware but it wasn't
[37:37] it wasn't really tame I don't think the
[37:39] man really um held it a lot when it was
[37:41] growing up so it wasn't really used to
[37:43] human interaction it was a it was not
[37:46] wild but it was you know just used to
[37:48] being out with this mother out in the
[37:49] field so different than like a little
[37:51] animal that you have in your house and
[37:52] it's always around it gets used to
[37:53] humans but this one wasn't wild but it
[37:55] wasn't exactly used to humans you
[37:58] couldn't easily pet the goat but it was
[38:00] tame enough so so he he began his
[38:03] journey walked along the you know along
[38:05] the Plains and the man said to him I'll
[38:07] tell you where the house is if you just
[38:08] follow the main trail you'll get way up
[38:10] the top and around the top view and you
[38:12] can't miss the house it's it's around
[38:13] maybe a week's journey and then up
[38:16] around the top somewhere you'll see a
[38:18] you'll see the certain house there and
[38:19] you'll come across it if you stay on the
[38:21] man Trail you'll come across and you'll
[38:22] be able to give this go back to this man
[38:25] so so he made this journey walked along
[38:27] the planes had his goat with him and
[38:29] then he he gets to the bottom of these
[38:32] Hills and he's
[38:33] he's goes you know up the hills and it's
[38:36] he maybe stay the night there and then
[38:38] he would carry on a bit longer
[38:40] but the goat was still a wee bit
[38:42] flighty you know so that was it was
[38:45] always he'd always have to keep the goat
[38:46] close to him because he was worried this
[38:47] little thing would possibly run away so
[38:49] he's he's up up near the top right up
[38:52] right up on the Rocky Mountain Pass and
[38:55] it's you know we saw on his feet but saw
[38:57] in his hands he's used to going there
[38:59] but maybe not that far this is a
[39:00] furthest he's been he hasn't been up the
[39:02] top here before
[39:04] where is where he's going
[39:06] and
[39:07] and he just got sidetracked at one point
[39:10] with the viewer and looked around and
[39:11] then didn't realize that when he looked
[39:14] back this Little Goat Head sort of shot
[39:15] off around around the side of these
[39:17] rocks he said oh the little goats taken
[39:19] off I better go and catch this little
[39:21] goat before it yeah before before the
[39:23] thing runs away
[39:24] so he he walks over to where the goat
[39:26] was around this ledge and he starts to
[39:28] scale the side of the the rock face it's
[39:32] quite steep but goats are very good in
[39:33] Rocky places he starts to scale around
[39:36] the side to get the scope in his hands
[39:38] are a bit sore because he's grabbing
[39:39] onto the sharp rocks and the maybe old
[39:43] sticks that are coming out of the bank
[39:44] we're not talking green shoots we're
[39:46] talking everything goes to Thorns there
[39:48] and it's you know and he's trying to
[39:50] scale the side of this
[39:52] little pass and he his foot slips and he
[39:55] he's near the goat but as his foot slips
[39:57] he slips around and kicks the goat with
[39:59] his foot as he swings around
[40:01] and
[40:02] picks the goat and the Goat starts to
[40:04] Tumble down the hill now of course the
[40:06] goat also thinks that he's kicked the
[40:08] goat because he doesn't like the goat
[40:10] already being a scared goat anyway it's
[40:12] kicked this little goat in the goat the
[40:14] goat you know just starts tumbling down
[40:16] and he he starts tumbling down too and
[40:19] he's going down this very
[40:21] very Rocky Face and he's trying to stop
[40:24] himself and his hands are being grazed
[40:27] and his knees and his legs and he's he's
[40:29] in quite a predicament maybe when he's
[40:31] in that state he's saying Lord help me
[40:33] I'm slipping down this bank and he's
[40:34] just trying to grab on and the goats
[40:37] quite a way down below him now but goats
[40:39] are reasonably robust especially young
[40:40] ones and they can find their footing
[40:42] quite well and even if they fall down a
[40:43] bit they can sort of get back up but so
[40:46] this goat sort of Falls quite quickly
[40:47] all the way down to the bottom of this
[40:48] big
[40:49] Ravine and and but he he manages to stop
[40:52] himself but he's not before he's all
[40:53] grazed up and his knees and his hands
[40:55] and he's
[40:56] a lot of everywhere and he's he's in
[40:58] quite a state and he looks way way down
[41:00] in the in the Gully there and he sees
[41:02] this little goat is walking down away
[41:03] down in the galley and he thought oh
[41:06] Lord now that I've lost a little goat
[41:08] and you know I know my hands are so sore
[41:09] I can't hardly
[41:11] you know I can't really Traverse down
[41:14] this face here I have to maybe wait here
[41:16] for a day or two but I can't stop that
[41:18] that little goat will
[41:19] will just disappear on me Lord but I've
[41:22] and I'm up in the middle of nowhere I
[41:24] can't just turn back now so he's saying
[41:27] Lord just help me I'm gonna
[41:29] try and go and carry on and try and
[41:30] catch that goat you know as we all would
[41:32] if we're in a situation we would when we
[41:34] get in a situation of strife we say Lord
[41:36] help me help me in the situation we we
[41:39] maybe don't see it coming maybe two
[41:41] hours before that he was looking at the
[41:42] view then two hours later he's little
[41:44] over his hands down the side of a
[41:45] mountain past the mission he was on to
[41:48] for the Lord had all sort of not turned
[41:51] out the way he planned the goats run
[41:52] away
[41:53] and he's doing something for the Lord
[41:54] and he wonders this is not going as well
[41:56] as what I planned I was hoping I'd just
[41:57] walk this goat up to this man and drop
[41:59] the goat off and he'd be happy and I'd
[42:02] feel good in myself I've done a good
[42:04] deal and I walk back and I tell the man
[42:05] there but it doesn't look like it's
[42:07] gonna go that way because he's
[42:09] struggling to Now Catch the scope and so
[42:12] but he just wants to keep on going so he
[42:13] carries on after this goat and he's
[42:16] going up mountains and down and he's now
[42:18] and then he sees the goat in the
[42:20] distance but it's hard for him to keep
[42:21] up because remember he's all cut and
[42:23] bruised and
[42:24] battered and
[42:26] you know and he's he's and this is going
[42:28] for days and days and he's trying to
[42:29] track this little goat because he thinks
[42:31] well I'm here now I might as well find
[42:32] this thing Lord help me find the goat
[42:33] and he's praying every day Lord help me
[42:34] find this little goat I'm doing this for
[42:36] you Lord help me to find it
[42:38] I think praying every day and walking
[42:40] and he's
[42:41] no it's hard going for him it's not an
[42:44] easy journey and he's beginning to
[42:45] wonder why am I in this predicament
[42:48] why am I he starts to just think you
[42:50] know this is not as this is not how I
[42:51] had planned out this whole
[42:53] exercise you ever been in that situation
[42:57] this is not quite what I thought it
[42:58] would be
[43:00] and
[43:01] but he's saying Lord I know you're a
[43:03] good god you'll deliver me you'll help
[43:04] me find the goat and I'll get it to this
[43:06] man because I'm doing a good thing so
[43:07] you'll help me and then maybe after days
[43:09] and days way off in the distance he
[43:11] hears a little
[43:13] and he said praise the Lord that's it I
[43:15] I can hear this little goat you know and
[43:17] he says this little man and he he hears
[43:19] it again man and he he knows okay that's
[43:22] the goat I'm gonna praise the Lord I've
[43:23] found this little goat you know like
[43:25] once I get the goat then I have to
[43:26] figure out how to get back but at least
[43:28] I'll have the goat you know and he's his
[43:30] his hands are healed up a lot more now
[43:32] and everything's starting to go but
[43:33] better and he's moving a bit faster now
[43:35] and he's
[43:36] he's been been a while now so he's
[43:38] getting used to walking in the place and
[43:40] he's getting a better footing on things
[43:41] now but faster his hands are callousing
[43:44] up a bit so we can actually move a bit
[43:45] quicker now
[43:46] and he's getting closer and closer to
[43:48] the scope he's hearing it say
[43:50] then it says meh and it stops he thinks
[43:52] like it's odd that it stopped but I know
[43:55] it was over here somewhere it was just
[43:56] it was just around the corner there so
[43:58] he goes around the corner there to to
[44:00] see where the little where the scope was
[44:02] and and there it was and it was sure
[44:04] enough it was his goat that he was
[44:05] looking for but it was dead
[44:08] a wild dog had come just because the
[44:10] goat was so much so a wild dog had come
[44:13] and just killed it
[44:14] he thought God I I I
[44:17] almost had it I was that close to
[44:19] getting this little goat then I come
[44:21] around the corner and it's now it's dead
[44:23] now now I found it but now what am I
[44:27] going to bring a dead goat to the man
[44:29] and he
[44:31] and this is hard for me saying Lord this
[44:34] was this is challenging for me I've been
[44:36] out here for weeks
[44:37] and then I
[44:39] you know I'm trying to do you a good
[44:40] thing Lord and I've finally
[44:42] you know I've been struggling I didn't
[44:44] just give up when the goat ran away I
[44:45] didn't just go well forget it and walk
[44:47] back I carried on I pressed on day after
[44:50] day and then I get to the finally it
[44:54] seems like Lord you're going to bless I
[44:55] get to this goat and just before I get
[44:57] it it's dead
[44:59] and he's he's just
[45:01] he's a bit I guess
[45:03] downcast because he doesn't understand
[45:06] the situation
[45:07] and maybe when I started the story you
[45:09] wouldn't think that's the way that it
[45:10] would unfold and he would have been the
[45:12] same
[45:12] he he should have been at the house by
[45:14] now he should have been back at his
[45:16] village by now
[45:17] getting patted on the back
[45:19] good man
[45:21] but instead the the goats did he's
[45:23] he's there he's been out for weeks and
[45:25] he and he he says well
[45:27] I guess Lord I just have to
[45:31] call it quits and I didn't leave the
[45:33] goat here and
[45:34] just head back and tell the man that
[45:37] I failed I just I tried my best it just
[45:39] didn't all work out and I just failed so
[45:42] so I began to walk back and he vaguely
[45:44] remembers where he went and he can see
[45:46] the sun setting in certain places in you
[45:48] roughly the direction
[45:50] but you know
[45:51] as he's walking back he's beginning to
[45:53] notice that you know when I started my
[45:55] feet were quite soft
[45:57] you know but I've been out here for
[45:58] weeks and weeks now he looked down at
[46:00] his feet and he thought my feet are
[46:01] quite hard now they're getting sort of
[46:03] calluses on them no nice any
[46:06] and I can you know they they're not as
[46:08] sore as what they used to be I can
[46:11] I can walk a bit easier and I can I can
[46:13] go for a bit longer he he looks at his
[46:16] hands you know he thinks the same about
[46:17] his hands you know he said when I first
[46:19] hooked onto those rocks my hands were
[46:20] quite soft and it was painful but now I
[46:22] can grab onto any I'll rock my hands are
[46:24] quite calloused up they're quite strong
[46:26] now
[46:27] quite you know I'm building my muscles
[46:29] up there I'm used to it and he would
[46:31] even even he would have trouble finding
[46:34] water and being out in such a desolate
[46:37] place he's in Atlanta that's uninhabited
[46:38] no one's there it's just a desolate
[46:40] Wasteland but somewhere amongst there he
[46:43] manages to find a little bit of water
[46:44] here and a bit of water there and
[46:46] he says even this desolate waste then I
[46:48] can still manage to just somehow pull
[46:50] through I can survive in this
[46:51] uninhabited uninhabited place
[46:54] and he thinks even running around the
[46:56] Rocks you know I'm my footing's a lot
[46:58] better now I've got
[46:59] better skill to run around the rocks
[47:02] and and to do these things but but then
[47:04] he thought you know but but that's a
[47:05] small constellation because I'm still
[47:07] going back to my Village
[47:09] failure as a failure I'm walking back as
[47:13] a failure
[47:14] I couldn't achieve this thing and I'm
[47:16] just just heading back there
[47:18] and you know when he was out there many
[47:20] times he would cry out to God and seems
[47:21] like God wouldn't answer him you know
[47:23] just say Lord Lord and Lord give me give
[47:25] me a just give me a big Oasis of water
[47:28] yeah and he would maybe think he'd
[47:30] expect to go around the corner and see a
[47:31] big pool a big that he could go for a
[47:33] swimming but his daddy would find maybe
[47:34] just a little a little puddle that he
[47:36] would just manage to just sustain him
[47:40] for the day he'd think well it wasn't
[47:42] the Oasis in the desert I was hoping for
[47:44] Lord just give me some nice food and
[47:47] maybe you would be expecting to come
[47:48] across a date tree that would be full of
[47:50] dates and he'd eat to his Hearts
[47:52] contempt he'd find maybe a few measly
[47:54] little berries and everything and that
[47:55] would just sustain him for the day
[47:57] seemed like Lord are you hearing My
[47:59] Cries I'm asking all these things and I
[48:01] just
[48:02] I guess I'm still alive but I'm just
[48:03] barely alive here
[48:08] this is the Christian walk sometimes
[48:10] yeah okay
[48:15] then he gets home
[48:17] and he walks back to the village and
[48:18] he's
[48:21] he's a bit downcast because he doesn't
[48:22] understand to him he think he looks he
[48:24] thinks you know that that whole exercise
[48:26] was seemingly just a waste of my a waste
[48:29] of time I went I've been gone for a
[48:31] month
[48:31] out there and I come back and it just
[48:33] seemed a
[48:34] I should have just stayed here I was
[48:36] better off just staying here Lord and I
[48:37] was trying to go and do a good deed and
[48:39] it just
[48:40] and then he goes and sees the man that
[48:43] he was going to do the delivery four and
[48:45] the man so excited he says I'm so happy
[48:47] to see you you know how how was my
[48:49] friend did you did you get in the goat
[48:51] and he had to say look no
[48:53] sorry I didn't get him to go I and he
[48:56] had to relay the story of how it all
[48:57] just failed for him he said look
[48:59] sorry but I just
[49:02] I failed I this happened the goat ran
[49:05] away I spent weeks trying to find it
[49:06] when I found it it was dead and then now
[49:08] I'm back
[49:10] and and that was my journey
[49:14] and the man said hey look look it's all
[49:16] right he's a real Christian he said look
[49:17] it's all right the Lord knows it's all
[49:19] right you did your best the Lord knows
[49:21] the Lord knows just just let's just keep
[49:24] praising the lord it's all okay we'll
[49:25] just hey he said oh by the way there's
[49:28] the you've been gone a while but you
[49:29] didn't know that the the uh today is
[49:32] actually the day of atonement they're
[49:33] doing the day of atonement sacrifice
[49:36] today down at the at the temple so
[49:37] you're just in time for that so
[49:41] so we can go and worship God and and you
[49:43] know and and bring our sacrifice and
[49:45] have our sins forgiven
[49:47] and
[49:49] and
[49:49] I guess it was of a small consolation to
[49:52] him you know because he's still battling
[49:54] in himself Lord that seemed like such a
[49:55] pointless thing but nevertheless I'm
[49:57] going to go to this and praise you
[49:58] anyway Lord and go to the temple and
[50:00] praise you
[50:01] so they went there in the on the day of
[50:03] atonement the priest would kill a
[50:04] bullock like a cow and then in the next
[50:07] it would kill a sheep
[50:09] then then
[50:11] the next thing that that they bring up
[50:13] are two goats
[50:15] and and
[50:16] that the the
[50:19] priesthood cast lots
[50:22] and one goat they would kill as a to be
[50:26] the sacrificial goat
[50:28] and then the other goat
[50:30] they would let go and that was called
[50:32] the scapegoat and so the priest takes
[50:34] the one goat and and kills the one goat
[50:37] and they're watching this happen and
[50:39] then then he then he then he brings the
[50:41] other goat out to out amongst the people
[50:44] and and he lays his hands on this goat
[50:47] and he says
[50:49] the the ceremony yesterday is going to
[50:51] lay all the sins of the people upon this
[50:53] goat
[50:55] said then they would lay hands on the
[50:56] goat and put all of the sins of the
[50:58] people upon this goat
[51:00] and then the priests would pray dear God
[51:02] the people have come here for for Mercy
[51:05] Lord and forgive for forgiveness for
[51:07] salvation Lord and to us forgiveness of
[51:09] their sins and we're gonna
[51:10] we're we're going to lay all of their
[51:12] sins upon this goat Lord and we just we
[51:15] lay them all upon the goat Lord that
[51:16] that that they could be taken away from
[51:18] the people and put upon this goat Lord
[51:20] so we we do this according to your word
[51:22] and it was Leviticus 16 according to the
[51:25] word you gave to Aaron we will put our
[51:26] sins upon this goat and he opens his
[51:29] eyes and he looks around and he says now
[51:32] now
[51:34] according to the word of God we need a
[51:36] fit man
[51:37] a fit man to take this goat way way way
[51:41] up way over
[51:43] to a desolate land to a land that's
[51:46] uninhabited we need someone that's fit
[51:48] and strong to take this goat way over
[51:51] because
[51:52] we need to show that that's how far away
[51:54] our sins have been taken from us
[51:57] so he says we need a foot man well all
[51:59] you mean line up
[52:01] so all the young men line up
[52:05] anybody's asked the first one he says
[52:06] hey what
[52:07] see if this man will take you see were
[52:09] you being son
[52:11] yeah the first man he says oh well I've
[52:13] been to the bottom of the planes here
[52:14] I've been see those planes over there
[52:16] see we're at the edge I've been to there
[52:19] the priest says no no no this I need
[52:22] someone's going to take a further than
[52:23] that God
[52:24] doesn't just forgive us that we can it's
[52:26] still a bit there this thing's got to be
[52:28] gone
[52:28] it's got to be further than that I need
[52:30] something that's going to take it
[52:31] further than that I need someone that's
[52:32] a bit stronger yeah keep going but I
[52:34] need someone stronger the next man lines
[52:36] up and he says Where Are You Gonna Where
[52:39] Have You Been son this man says we'll
[52:40] see see halfway up the hill there I've
[52:41] been up there and camped up there
[52:43] the priest says no we need someone's
[52:45] going to take it further than that the
[52:47] next man says I've been to the top of
[52:48] that Hill
[52:49] I can maybe I can take this goat right
[52:51] at the top of that pickup the up I'll
[52:53] make it up there
[52:54] he says I they that's still our land he
[52:57] said this goat needs to go to a land
[52:58] that's uninhabited and desolate that we
[53:01] don't dwell in it's got to be somewhere
[53:03] we don't dwell it's going to be far far
[53:05] far away
[53:06] because that's where our sins are going
[53:08] to be taking us that's where our
[53:09] deliverance is going to be where our
[53:10] healing it's got to be absolute
[53:13] absolute he then he comes across the
[53:16] next man which is the man in our story
[53:17] looks at them he's ragged here hanging
[53:21] down hasn't had a shave for a while all
[53:23] his beard but he but he looks leathery
[53:26] his hands look tough his feet looks look
[53:28] like they can handle
[53:30] and he said to the man Where Have You
[53:32] Been son
[53:34] he said you see the top of that you see
[53:36] that plane I've been along there he says
[53:38] okay
[53:40] I've been halfway up the hill
[53:42] you see the top of that Hill I've been
[53:44] there
[53:46] and I've been way way way over the back
[53:48] of that into a desolate place where I
[53:51] where I seem like I cry out to God and
[53:52] there was no God
[53:54] way in an uninhabited land I've been way
[53:57] over there
[53:59] and the man says son
[54:01] you're the man we need to take this goat
[54:04] way way way over there
[54:07] you're there we need a fit man we need
[54:09] we need to stand here and watch and
[54:10] watch you take this a long way away
[54:14] we need to see that we need to know that
[54:16] there's that this word is powerful that
[54:19] this Blood saves it doesn't it you've
[54:22] gotta we need a fit we need to fit man
[54:25] and woman we need a we need a fit man
[54:27] that's going to show these people how
[54:28] how much the blood of Christ works
[54:31] how far their sins are taken from them
[54:33] we need to show them there's total
[54:35] salvation we can't just have a half an
[54:38] effort we need someone that's been
[54:39] through some things that knows had faith
[54:41] in the word of God that can believe in a
[54:43] strong and keep going no matter what
[54:45] they believe
[54:46] we need to they these people need a
[54:48] total salvation it can't just be a half
[54:49] salvation that and someone faults us we
[54:52] need they they need to see someone with
[54:54] strong faith that can that can believe
[54:56] in the word of God all the way
[54:58] total deliverance we we've got to see
[55:02] this thing gone this thing's got to be
[55:03] gone into an uninhabited land this thing
[55:05] that's troubling you has got to be gone
[55:09] we need someone that can show that the
[55:11] power and the blood that these sins can
[55:14] be taken far away with us you can be
[55:16] delivered
[55:17] we need to show healing that it's it's
[55:19] absolute
[55:22] and we often wonder Lord why do we go
[55:24] through all these things in our life
[55:25] it's because God's trying our faith to
[55:27] make us strong
[55:28] to make us to make us strong so that we
[55:31] can be fit men and women of Faith so
[55:34] that our whole walk is actually
[55:36] servitude
[55:39] Jesus said I didn't come to to be
[55:42] ministered to but to minister our whole
[55:44] walk is servitude and you wonder Lord
[55:46] why do I go through all these things
[55:48] like a seemingly pointless exercise why
[55:50] it's just hard for me and I've just got
[55:51] a struggle and struggle he's making you
[55:53] strong
[55:54] he's trying your faith you wonder why
[55:56] you go through things he's trying your
[55:57] faith he's making you strong
[56:00] because you need at some point
[56:02] somebody's going to need you to believe
[56:04] Amen to say this is how powerful the
[56:06] blood of Christ is and stay there
[56:09] this is how God can deliver you and not
[56:11] falter
[56:13] he says my brethren counted all joy when
[56:15] you fall into diverse Temptations
[56:16] knowing that this that the trial of your
[56:19] faith workers patience
[56:20] it just gets tried and you just think
[56:22] Lord I'm just going day after day
[56:24] seemingly pointless but it's giving you
[56:25] patience which is patiently enduring
[56:27] after a while you just realize I can
[56:30] just endure I'm just enduring I'm
[56:31] stronger than what I was before
[56:33] in Revelation it says I counsel thee to
[56:35] buy of me gold tried in the fire that
[56:37] you may be rich
[56:38] we're not talking gold monetary we're
[56:40] talking trying your faith so come what
[56:42] may you believe you believe in the word
[56:44] of God you believe in the power of
[56:45] Christ your faith is being tried that's
[56:48] why Peter said the trial of your faith
[56:49] being much more precious than gold that
[56:51] perisheth
[56:52] though it be tried with fire might be
[56:55] found unto praise
[56:57] and honor and Glory at the appearing of
[56:58] Jesus Christ
[57:00] so if you're going through a few hard
[57:02] times at the moment
[57:04] that's all right amen
[57:06] that's because God loves you and he
[57:08] knows you can do it
[57:09] and he's trying your faith and he's
[57:11] going to use that
[57:13] your life is to serve other people and
[57:16] he's making you strong
[57:18] we're like the Elite Force we're not
[57:21] little Canon fodder we're the Elite
[57:23] Force that Can Go the Distance with the
[57:25] word of God
[57:27] I want to close off with the scripture
[57:28] this was going to be my opening
[57:30] scripture but then you'd know what I was
[57:31] talking about you see and Aaron shall
[57:33] lay both his hands upon the head of the
[57:35] live goat and confess over him all the
[57:37] inequities of the children of Israel and
[57:38] all their transgressions and all their
[57:40] sins putting them upon the head of the
[57:42] goat and they shall send him away by the
[57:44] hand of a fit man into the wilderness
[57:47] or a Foot Woman Into the Wilderness
[57:50] so be of good courage if you're going
[57:52] through things it's all all right
[57:54] it's all alright your fit men and women
[57:57] and God's got a plan for you amen praise
