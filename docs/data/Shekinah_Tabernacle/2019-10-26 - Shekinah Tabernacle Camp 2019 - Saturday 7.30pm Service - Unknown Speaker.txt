Lord that we might reap the fruits of a heavenly atmosphere Lord will be careful to give you all the honor and the glory ain't no wonderful name of Jesus Christ we pray it's Church day amen hey man if you have your Bibles let's turn to numbers 33 numbers the 33rd chapter he'll be all the music appreciate the worship appreciate the musicians amen we want to give thanks to each and every person that helped make this happen you know from you know the cooks to the cleanup crew to the the IT guys everything you know and all of you you know that decided to come out you know we thank God for a collective effort to make this meeting a success you know but what good without gathering be if Jesus didn't show up amen it'd just be another gathering but when he comes then the whole dynamic is changed hallelujah number 33 let's start reading at verse I started verse 50 numbers 33 and verse 50 the Bible says and the Lord speaking to Moses in the plains of Moab by the Jordan near Jericho saying speaking to the children of Israel and say unto them when ye are passed over Jordan in the land of Canaan the initial drive out all the inhabitants of the land from from before you and destroy all their pictures and destroy all their molten images and quite plucked down all their high places and ye shall dispossessed the inhabitants of the land and dwell therein for I have given you the land to possess it and ye shall drop and ye shall divide the land by lot for an inheritance among your family among your families and to the more he shall give the more inheritance and to the fewer you shall give the less inheritance every man's inheritance shall be in the place where his life falleth according to the tribal of your father's he shall inherit but if ye will not drive out the inhabitants of the land from before you then it will then it shall come to pass that those which he let remain of them shall be pricks in your eyes and thorns in your size and she affects you in the land wherein ye dwell moreover it shall come to pass that I shall do unto you as I thought to do unto them O my mind let's turn to Hebrews the tenth chapter Hebrews 10 verse 1 he was tending when the Bible says for the law having a shadow of good things to come and not the very image of those things can never with those sacrifices sacrifices which they offered year by year continually make the comers thereunto perfect for then will they not have ceased to be offered because the worshiper was purged should have no more conscious of sin a metal order blessing to the reading of his word you can have your seats and as you're sitting I want to read another verse you know how the book of Romans chapter 10 Romans chapter 10 the Bible says but what saith it the Lord is nigh thee even in thy mouth and in thine heart that is the Word of Faith which we preach that if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus Christ and shalt believe in thine heart that God have risen him from the dead thou shalt be saved amen you know tonight by the grace of God I want to use for subject deliverance comes through the blood deliverance comes through the blood but I want to use for a a subtitle unattended habits on attended habits amen you know as we look right here in the scripture and we can see you know that God he promised him a land flowing with milk and honey and one thing about God God cannot lie thank God can I fail so if God made a promise that promise has to come to pass you know but the thing we have to do is believe that whatever God said it's going to happen don't reason with it you know don't don't know try to figure it out on your own but just believe that whatever God's saying he can keep it holy and we ought to stand on the promise of God but you know as I get started this message I want to talk about the power of the blood of a man you know Church you know there are different places where we can see that the blood meant something in the scriptures we can see when Adam and Eve first fell into sin that the covering of religion wasn't good enough it had to be blood so God like I said and they won God he wrapped him in and skin dripping with blood showing them that it had to be a life and you know as time went on you know man they fell into sin I want you to understand this Church of God that the Bible says we were born as he serving in iniquity why because of sin so you need something I need something that covers her the way we were born we need something that can take away our sins your religion take you it you church take you it you saying I mean the message will do it it has to be a sacrifice a sacrifice Stroger to the sin in your life and not only a sacrifice but it has to be a perfect sacrifice it has to be something huh that can't connect with you honey but as we look that sacrifice earlier that Adam and Eve you know God gave them it couldn't connect with their soul so had sacrifice of pools and coaching and all these things year by year honey so they could be forgiven for seeing that was the old way of sacrifice that won't work for you going to a farm getting the lamb and slaying it it won't work for you you go to your preacher go to your pastor Oh God will you please go to God and pray for me that I be forgiving that will work you have to come through the blood because the blood of bulls and goats could never take away so the desire to do wrong you go to the truth priest let's just say we was back in that day and brother already was my pastor pastor Robinson and I come to him go to God and pray for me cuz I have sinned I have come short of the glory of God I got things going on in my head evil thoughts will you please take it to the Lord in prayer and I come and meet with the pastor we have fellowship and I give him all the things wrong in my life he said okay god bless you brother I'll take it to the Lord in prayer but then he gets a phone call from somebody else and forgets all about what I asked him to do and he got that person prayers and did he get some text from somebody else did he forget things they asked him to do what would happen to me if the law was to come and he forgot to pray over my life he forgot to pray over my sins you know what I'd be lost that's why God took away that kind of sacrifice now you and I all of us have the opportunity to go behind the veil we can go to God personally and say I need your blood I need to be covered I don't have to go to the Congo priests I don't have to go to the pastor you know we thank God for pastors but pastors are not there for you to put the blame on let me tell you pastor something a lot of times people will come tell you different things why cuz they want somebody to blame they want somebody to put it on when it doesn't work out the way they wanted to work out go to God who you gonna blame you can't blame God because God cannot fail and God cannot lie so church when it comes to the blood a man in those days you know the worshiper he would come and maybe come in sin let's just say he was an adulterer and he committed adultery he take it to the priests the priests say oh I got you this one time this year but you know what with the pastor and the pastor say I got it I'm gonna take you to the Lord in prayer and you'll be forgiven but he leave with an adulterous desire cuz the life of a goat won't connect with your spirit the life of an animal won't connect with your desire so it had to be a sacrifice that could change your desires that could change your thoughts that could change your other tizen habits [Applause] had to be a god that could purge you purge your conscience from dead work so that's why God oh yeah he came and he put on fresh let's just before we get there let's go up a little bit remember when Israel were coming out they were a miracle after miracle God did signs and wonders God turned blood water into blood and and God made fire come down from heaven he created Falls he created life he caused darkness to come down in the land of Egypt God did all these mighty things but the last thing to come that God did God said I'm gonna let the death angel come and wherever I don't see the blood the oldest child now let's say tonight what if the Deaf Angels coming would you make it are you covered by the blood what if it was your life at stake what have you had to have the blood over your house is the blood applied when you know you've done wrong when you know hurry your life is might matching up but the death angel is coming would you still be shaking your sin or would you make sure you ready would you make sure the blood was applied remember the prophet of God he said he said this when he preached this message he said in the blood of Jesus is the only thing that can change your desires but you have to accept the Lord Jesus Christ by faith oh yeah like I said earlier I can't give it to you nobody can give it to you it has to be a confession out of your mouth it has to be a lifestyle you have to be more than just a nice diet but we find out we have habits that we like and we don't pay no attention to those habits but those habits are doing something give me the picture of the tree I'll show you something and trust me by the grace of God I don't want to be long I'm gonna preach move out the way and give God a chance oh yeah to bathe you in this blood look at that tree right there I was probably about 25 feet something like that it's cut down now so you can't see I told it was look like a tree that's not a tree it's not a tree that's a weed that was left unattended but it looks like a tree but let me tell you something it has no value it has no benefit all I was doing was taking up space taking up nourishment from something else that really needed that water that needed that sunlight but this twig was left unattended and it grew and grew and grew and grew to the place it got it away and it had to be cut down now let me tell you how this crew to this place now this came out of my pastors yard this is his yard this is our church right here and you can see there's a lot of things growing his house goes back this way but he left this right here and he says you know you couldn't grass you can see some things that need to be mowed over there's some things in some of our lives tonight that needs to be mowed over stop taking pity on the devil and your unsaved habits and mow the devil completely down but you know what happened that tree when it was a twig and because it was unattended it just started growing cuz one thing about twigs and tears they feed on the same sunlight they feed on the same water that's falling around the grass and stuff so you can sit here earlier and you can enjoy the presence of God you can enjoy the outpouring of God and still have no life no substance to give back into the body but you look good no you totally said this tree just just just weed he says he saw it and then he saw it growing a little bit and he got about this high and something in this spirit said cut it down but he reasoned with that and he said well because it's giving the dog some shade that's our problem fees need to be cut down but we reasoned with what kind of benefit it can be for something else God says get out of that relationship and did you say Lord I don't want to hurt her feelings huh hurting the feelings being in the will of God if you don't listen to God you and her feelings are going to be hurt you say well he said he said something even it's what he's trying to make a decision the weed kept growing what things that are in your life and they're being unattended huh they're continually growing why your reasoning you might say well I got I got till I'm 21 why your reasoning those demon powers that are in your life they're continually growing those bad habits that are in your life that continually growing it's still a twig but you know who's benefiting the dog and I laugh I laugh so much cuz y'all had to know pass this dog he wasn't a guard dog he wasn't a tag dog he was like I'll see you later dog you walk in the yard and you look at you like oh that's just you and I didn't state it I didn't know him that good but we walk in the yard he look at us baby like what's up so sometimes the thing that you're trying to save don't even need saving I'm about to close don't get nervous see why we're going this way because we haven't entered into a complete deliverance yet some of you are still holding back and I can feel some of the tightness it might be tightness or maybe tiredness because some of y'all don't like to go to bed and then they start growing and growing and growing and the dog said Nick he's enjoying the pastures unattended habit so church he the tree kept going let me tell you something the reason the purpose for him leaving the trees and was for the dog the dog died but the twig remained once the dog died he wasn't even thinking about that anymore he got used to seeing it he just walked by and almost like hatred let's get this straight in those moments he was calling it something that it wasn't it's not a tree it's a weed it's a twig it has no value so I wonder how many things how many habits you got in your life that has no value all it's doing is being a hinderance well probably a month ago because we cut it down he he put the picture up in Turkey so y'all see this right here this is weed he said well I let it grow and I let it grow my wife kept telling me honey cut it down cut it down cut it down he said how often we say that when God is telling us to get seeing out of our life God is challenged some of you young people that seems you need to deal with but you keep reasoning you keep saying no what I'm gonna do it I'm gonna do it one day know what I'm gonna do then why are you saying that it's growing and growing and growing and growing it will mature and it will become something that you don't like and the longer you keep it around the more reasons you have to say oh it's alright it's like music there's been times when a song came on the radio and I'm like but again and now you're finding where's the music make you wanna break it down trust me the Spirit of the Lord in behind that if the music make you want to get in the mirror at the housing trust me there's another spirit behind that music because worship is not premeditated worship is not for you to go home and practice so you can make everybody say [Applause] the reason who we left for died but the evidence of the we stay there so that's just one picture when you cut it down I got some warm iPhone you can't just cut it down you got to destroy it from the root you got to dig it up you can't leave this part right here you got to dig to stump up because if you don't life will come back out of that piece of the stump earlier if God is dealing with you heart honey and there are things in your life you must how do you dig it up [Applause] remember there's a woman the Prophet was dealing with and she was she was in the psychiatric ward and she was crying and saying all these things that all got down indeed a promise they come on let's pray and she got down to stop principle in a prophecy sister you ain't stay down there I love it more stay down there till you get a breakthrough and we found out that people have things in their life from the past that they will not let go and they bring those things to church and then they put the reason why they're so unhappy on everybody else with Stephen a past that they won't let God deal with but then they'll say well it's so far why I'm like this and it's your fault well I'm like this no it's your fault you won't let God put all of that trouble under the blood look reason why I showed you that because numbers numbers 33 cents but if you will not drive out the inhabitants of the land from before from before you see he will come to pass the dose which he let remain sell shall be pricks in your eyes so what's on websites and social media and all these things and God didn't told you stop going down that road but you keep going and you keep going and now it's becoming a habit now it's becoming something that's just a part of your everyday life and you wonder how did I get like this because God told you to get rid of it and you didn't and now it's becoming a part of who you are and you want to get rid of it but it's a prick in your eyes and the only thing that can save you is applying the token [Applause] the only thing that can save you it's the come in contact with a life stronger than yours you know we don't even preach about the blood of Jesus no more blood what did the blood of Jesus do honey he took every sickness every trouble every hurt every pain every struggle every trial tribulation and Jesus put it on his shoulders and he crucified he destroyed he annihilated all your problems all your weaknesses oh you hurt all your pain what happened to it God put it under his blood yeah but some of us are still carrying things when they don't belong to you it's supposed to be God's it's supposed to be the Lord's but we're still carrying it the blood of Jesus you say well brother deeds I don't know about that there's something called the Holy Ghost if you get the Holy Ghost it'll do something in your life that you cannot explain what the Holy Spirit is so important cuz I think I did this one time before but the Holy Spirit is a seal and wherever there's a seal nothing can get in and nothing can get out even if you drop sometimes if you truly got a sail nothing to come out even if you kick the r a little bit even if you kicked around a little bit if it's a good seal nothing to come out and nothing to come in if it's really a true seal nothing to go out and nothing to come in that's the importance of the holy cows sometimes life will shake you up sometimes you don't know if you're coming on you're going but if you got a true sale [Music] the anchor will hold you might say brother Deeks I got trouble in my life shake shake it up shake it up shake it up honey now let me ask you something is it still sealed it's still sealed so it doesn't matter who has the seal it will hold it doesn't matter where you come from is this a if it's a true seal it will hold if it's a genuine holy ghost doesn't matter your background to devil your struggles your child cannot break the seal [Applause] sometimes you don't know if you're coming or going you look like you forgotten everybody's wondering what happened to you but with all the smoke clears and you start making your way back to church you start working you may make the service they'll find out that you got something in your life that can't be broken you got something in your life that's keeping you no matter what you go through there's something keeping you and the Holy Ghost can keep you through your good times through your bad times do your struggles do your tribulations do your not knowing the seal is your protector oh I challenge you to get the Holy Ghost before you leave this campus and will come back to us yucky you know that is that's a pipe from under the house then I want you to understand out of those pipes came all the stuff right here and it clogged up the flow of the water coming out those pipes how did that all that other rubbish how did all that other rubbish get inside that pipe when they built the house and he put the pipes together no doubt none of that was in there earlier but as time went on and water started to flow there was no seal and because the seal was broken another life started to be fan right in another life started to grow right in the midst where things were flowing freely and it grew so much - it took over the natural area where the water was supposed to flow now I want you to understand all these trees and twigs that's in the black now didn't start that way and I guarantee you the things that's going on in your life you didn't start that way but some kind of way Dean start to seep in I wonder how many of us got under tenant habits and we don't even realize because we don't have a seal something else is growing inside of us now this one I want you to Xu why didn't that grow on outside why did he grow on the inside because this pipe was on the ground had dirt covered all around it but the safe place for life to grow and not be detected was on the inside you may say well I ain't bother nobody no you might not be but there might be something inside of you bother you there might be something inside are you growing like feelings different desires and all these things if these things are unattended another life will grow inside of you and you don't even know it until it becomes a cog and because this other life start to grow within these pipes God is so good I was I was preaching out of church and a friend of mine as a plumber and I had to patch up a pipe at my house and because I'm not a plumber my patch-up job was very laughable so he had a good laugh at my patch up job and then he showed me this he said look at this he said this is what I was working on today I say where was that he said that was a photo photo three feet underground nobody could see it but it was crawling and you can sit in church with that the Holy Ghost hallelujah and there'll be another life growing inside of you that nobody else knows look the pipe didn't always look like that it was once new but that other life was always growing because there was no seal and as the water seeped out earlier the other substance and rubbish and twigs and all that stuff it start to grow holy got to the place to where life got inside of the pipe and then it hatched Church the worst thing you can do is we sit in church and the devil hatches eggs inside your spirit because the seal was broken eight unworthy life got in the way and what did he do it clogged up the pipes and this was the main pipe in the house it was just clogged up the whole house couldn't function I wonder what's in your life stopping the flow of the spirit what kind of habits you got that you won't get rid of that are being unattended you know one thing I noticed that the prophet of God said he say one thing about demons he said if you like doing what you're doing you worship that spirit you're not looking for the deliverance but you're satisfied with how your life is remember that woman who had the social disease and brother Brendan came to to talk to her no brother Neville came to talk to one of the brothers and she said I didn't send for you she said I'm just as safe as anybody else get out of here in the preface and watch her with a life comes to an end and one thing about death death takes away all of your reasoning cuz you're about to come into the presence of reality and you are not going the other side oh yeah not knowing but you will know who and what you are when you're about to change dimensions so you can sit in church you can hide and you can do all these things and you know what you can you can act like everything is good but if there's something that's screwing inside of you it's gonna stop the flow of God give me that coat don't get nervous see one thing I want you to understand without God life is meaningless take that down take that down let me say this I've been in services where people have been delivered from smoking have been delivered from marijuana and alcohol huh deaf ears opened up blinded see I've seen a lot of things so you can't tell me God ain't real let me said I just I've been at dis camp oh yeah three years ago a young man was here oh yeah he gave up all his drugs he had in a bag and he walked up to the past came up to me he said you know what I don't need this no more I want to serve the Lord [Music] right here in New Zealand you can't tell me God is not real I know a young lady in the UK in London England hallelujah she was fighting the spirit of depression so much cuz she wanted to commit suicide it was another life growing inside of her and she was in a Christian home but she was fighting an unseen battle her parents didn't even know and one day she went to school and she told her teacher she's a very gifted young girl she told a teacher I can no longer play this worldly music in band I can no longer play this worthy music and the teacher told her sister hey if you're not gonna play what we put out I'm going to fail you and that added more pressure and then she went home and had an argument with one of our sisters that added more pressure so that was it she said you know what I'm gonna kill myself and she went home got a loan when nobody could see her whenever whatever she did and she put some rounds Nick and tried to hang herself but in that moment of her trying to kill herself hope she her life gang on the pastor's heart in the past to stop praying for an older sister who was walking with her her sister she came on her heart so now she got prayer coming from the sin and prayer coming from the scene and she says she don't know how she don't know what happened but all of a sudden she lost the desire to try to kill herself it left just like that Wow because somebody was interesting what was it it was another life hallelujah the church she overcame that battle but she can remember the Prophet saying that you're gonna have to come to a showdown you're gonna have to come to a showdown you're gonna have to overcome the spirit of depression and she went to a camp meeting just like this in the UK hallelujah and while she was at the camp meeting the Holy Spirit started falling in a church the power of God came down in the church and she said in that moment she could see other people being dealt with she knew God was there but she said lord if this is truly you you know what she prayed like that because people always Lord if this is truly you lourdes this is truly not please father God if this is you I need to know father I've overcome depression she said god this is you listen to her request she said Lord as this issue I want you to touch my right hand [Applause] you mean God is so real he can touch your hand in service I'm telling this testimony to the glory of God Church she said in that moment she was praying that the Holy Spirit was moving all over appears she said lord I need to know that I've overcome depression and father that I'm your child would you please come and plus my right hand she said I came over and grabbed her hand and I said the powers of depression are broken the power of depression is broken in the night I will not be used by the devil [Applause] [Music] can you imagine what she did when that happen in church you talking about worship you talk about dancing and shouting and giving God praise if God ever does anything for you how can you be silent Church she worships so hard after that did she lost her voice and when we got to church the next morning after the camp the pastor was was going around saying who got a testimony she lost her voice so she couldn't testify but she wasn't gonna lose a chance she wrote it down on paper what God did for her that's how I knew what the Lord he because he even though she lost her voice she didn't lose her experience you may lose your voice you may not be able to touch the fire but that doesn't mean your experience is not real Church and I can show you a video right now we'd heard leading the worship in church and it's this world she's playing the piano well she plays the piano she doesn't even sit down she plays the standing up bow Church and she her in a system or two out of a family of seven a mother and father will take ministry they were pretty much cast out for going to a local fellowship but they kept going and they kept going and when I was there in August hardly a couple months ago the whole family was in church [Applause] that's what happens when God gets the whole world why am I telling that testimony because there's power in the name of Jesus to break every chain holidays Church and I was in Canada hallelujah in for Easter holy and eastern me and I told that testimony I told that testimony and there was a young girl in church hallelujah who wit the way of the world but now she's trying to find her way back her parents they had some struggles they had some fights some arguments but she's trying to find her way back and when I told that testimony she know what she did she said lord if you're the same God if you are Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever she was in the seat in the last row of seats oh yeah and she heard that testimony and she said Lord if you did that for her god I need to know that you are real and dealing with me I need brother deeds to come put his hands on my left shoulder and pray for me I was up at the pulpit preaching and it all of a sudden I found myself walking through the back he's a god taking that's a prayer he's the god of a total deliverance [Music] you don't have to carry it no more search and from there huh Lia I walked out the pulpit and I know the Spirit of God was moving just like it is in here did you catch that just like it is in here he's the same God in church I shot myself in the back of the church huh Lia and I saw her and maybe two sisters gather with her and it looked like she didn't need no prayer but something was compelling me to go lay hands on her and I went over there and I laid not my right hand oh just like she asked now can you imagine what that did for a young girl who was struggling who had other kids habits in her life but now God is putting his hand God is putting his hand on her shoulder and the Lord is saying I am real can you imagine when God comes to show how real he is that was a defining moment church it starts in service [Applause] in that same service another sister she said lord if you did that for her these two girls were praying the same prayer cuz they heard the same testimony and they believed in the same God this other so sitting up in the front I remember what she was she was on the our Ohana and she was praying a prayer she said lord if you can do that for her I need you to touch my right hand and deal with the struggle and as soon as she prayed after I heard the young girl in the back hands laid on her as I was walking back up to the front oh yeah I saw that young girl hands extended and I grabbed it earlier and I started praying for her holy and rebuking all of her mind battles just like she acts God my gift does not belong to me it belongs to you can you believe can you believe in a God that can touch can you believe in a God that can speak a God that can carry you you are a son hallelujah you are called to be a son of God you believe in a God whose personal in that same meeting a young girl was worshiping she had her hands lifted we was in a tent she had her hands lifted and when she looked up the top of the tent was gone and she said she saw the face of Jesus looking down on him as they worshiped now can you imagine what that did for her to see God looking down on her and she worship nobody else saw it but nobody else can take away what she saw Church in the same meeting earlier after the meeting was over a young man Harleys he was one of the song leaders and boy this boy's a worshipper I was a meeting he went out to his car in a car would start so he called the record company do y'all call it reca amen he called the record to come get his car and take it to the shop but the record man forgot so he went back to his car he said this doesn't make any sense so he sat in the car and he start rehearsing what was preached at me used me now I want you to understand what I want you to understand earlier when I'm going to injure the Lord is still here so don't pull all your hope in brother James playing for you a brother DS coming back you make your contact with God Church he said the car wouldn't start in the recommend incoming get it so he went back to the car he sat in the car and he started remembering everything that was preached in the camp-meeting he started talking to the car he said you know what you have no reason not to start you have no reason not to crank up so in the name of Jesus I command you to crank up he turned the switch in the car turned over oh yeah hey Joe and drove that car and when I saw him in August I said how did everything go with the car he said you know what he said it was about to break down on me right before I got married he said Lois I was getting married and I said Lord he said I said Lord Lord please let this car last til I got married Church that car drove him all the way up to the chapel and then it broke down you speak into your old life just speak what you want God to do in your whole life Church nah he got married but he had no car but he was still giving God praise he made it to the wedding hallelujah so earlier after the wedding was about over he he saw on his friends and what his friends hardly was a car dealer and this brother said man you know what I wasn't able to get you a present but here you go he gave him a new car without money without price you can't tell me Mike are they real why don't you try Jesus tonight why don't you follow other the blood of Jesus tonight it was a girl it was a lady hallelujah who was paralyzed as she walked with a crutch and as she was walking out I told her if you come back tomorrow gotta take that crutch away from you I wouldn't put myself on the spot I'll quit God on the spot if you believe and you not doubt you have what you asked for Turkey she came back the next day walking with the crutch oh yeah but she got discouraged by somebody another pastor that went to another church he said don't go back there and people ain't right believing the same message how we right stop listen to the demons we're fellowshiping around God's Word [Applause] Church she came back anyway but she still had whatever he said in her mind so you know I'm preaching and I remember what I told her I said I want that sister then I told hardly the God was gonna heal to come forward she looked at me and she said y'all know this ministry is not a one-man ministry anymore it's a body ministry so I need some of you to help me out tonight honey so when she started shaking his head like this and she didn't come the pastor's wife knew who I was talking about so you know what she did she got out of her seat and she snuck back there where she was and she Holly begins to minister to her why I kept preaching earlier and she began to tell her well you know this is God talking to you you know this is your chance to be healed you know this man don't know you you know this is God you know this is your opportunity you know how God is real you know [Applause] sisters don't need a pulpit all they need is a desire she sat down by that sister and she start to minister her preaching huh and she said to her you know this is God talking to you you know this is your chance to be healed why don't you take the chance and the sister looked at her and she said I'll go up there if you go with me she said okay and she walked okay she walked up with her struggle and before she could even pray she started telling me you don't understand I belong like this stop letting Satan lie to you you do not belong in a sinful condition Satan is lying you're supposed to be happy if you've done you feel like you're okay I say yeah Paul says when they do certain things and just a napkin turning that scripture take them on the blood but if they repent you receive them back in looking at what they did but look at how they came clean huh they repented holy God don't see a wrong how can you see not me and you not me you have a one on one with garlic tell God how sorry you is tell God that you repent from your roles and right there in that moment when she started repenting oh yeah something started coming over and her hands start to ray search and she talked to Cain she dropped Akane and once she dropped the King laid hands on her and started praying for in the power God came down ona and the lady who was crippled start to rejoice [Music] she started to worship she start to give God all of the praise she started to celebrate her healing church and from there that woman who came up crippled tell me God ain't real in that same service her daughter was watching her mama be healed but her daughter was possessed by a witch and she came in the prayer line and she said brother jinx when I got 18 I left Church and I got involved with a lesbian and she said that lesbian was a witch and she cast a spell on me even though I'm in church now I can't get away from the thoughts thinking about her when I'm at home with my husband I'm thinking about her when I'm in church I'm thinking about her I'm being tormented by the relationship with that wretch you be careful what you get involved with she was thinking when I need 18 I'm gonna have a little fun but ha ha fun turn into something and she couldn't get rid of but she says I'm willing to accept the Lord I'm asking God to forgive me for what I've done earlier I said so you believe that God can take it away God can take the spell away she said yes I do Church I laid hands on her and pray with her she didn't jump she didn't shout she didn't do anything she's just saying thank you Jesus indeed we went to the fellowship hall and she walked up to me she said brother deeds oh my I can't even remember what she look like in the same in the same service it was a brother who's having hot problems and he was like having a mini heart attack right hand service and God dealt with him hallelujah God begin to heal him right then service and that spirit jumped on his daughter Holly so you know what God jumped on his daughter too and she got healed right there in the same servant you understand how real God is they put that quote back up and

in here tonight saying buddies I got all these problems I got all the stuff in my life well let's look at a problem this is what the prophecy he said I'm looking at a man now sitting in the back of the room here I remember telling him that all the old ones stole one day by a manger he said but I'm no good you ever felt like that but I'm no good this was a prophet this is what the Prophet says and I said I know you're not and I said I'm not either but I said you're looking at what you are and quit looking at what you are and look at what he is stop looking at what you are and look at what he is what is he he is Savior He is God he is alpha he's our makeup he's here he's deliverer he is shown he is he's omnipotent he's omniscient he is omnipresent he's wonderful he's counselor he's Prince of Peace see you're looking at what you are looking at what you are looking at what he is he said listen I want you to put yourself in his position he says if I could get rid of these cigarettes anybody got something they want to get rid of listen he says if I can get rid of these cigarettes brother branham I would be a Christian brother Branham says I said don't get rid of her

he said but if I can hate what you can do it's what he can do [Music] come musicians come come quit trying to get good and just come to God come to God with all your troubles come to God with all your
