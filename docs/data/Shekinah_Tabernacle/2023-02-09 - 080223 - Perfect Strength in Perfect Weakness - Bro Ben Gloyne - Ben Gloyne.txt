glory to God Amen good to have everyone here this this evening amen thank you musicians thank you brother David amen God bless you I thought it's very uh interesting how how we had the Oppa Duo and I don't know why it's the last service you've got to bring out those kind of songs but praise God we thank thank you for that but it's interesting uh the first line I think is our week but I but but I'm I mean I am weak but Thou Art strong and I want to take a thought of perfect strength and perfect weakness tonight as we as we go to prayer so let's go to Hebrews chapter 11. I want to take a we'll just take one scripture here Hebrews 11 and I have it here it's Hebrews 11 and 33 to 35. um very powerful sermon of of of the Prophet perfect strength and perfect weakness and I I believe it applies for every moment in time I mean so Hebrews 11 and 33 35 I mean great to have Brother Andy back and praise God sound like the Lord's moving in Dunedin so we're really excited for that amen praise God Amen that's awesome so great to have you home my friend God bless you amen Hebrews 11 and 33 to 35 it says this here who through faith subdued kingdoms wrought righteousness obtained promises stop the mouths of lions quenched the violence of fire escaped the edge of the sword out of weakness were made strong wax Valiant and fight turned to flight the armies of the aliens women received their dead race to life again and others were tortured not accepting Deliverance that they might obtain a better Resurrection amen let's just uh yes if you could put verse 34 back up this is where I want to take my thoughts from Outer weakness were made strong so it's very uh powerful I mean let's um if who has a need tonight we have quite a few prayer requests already in so we're gonna have a time of prayer there's a prayer service tonight but amen if you have a knee you want to raise your hand to the Lord unless just approach him now as we've come into His presence dear Lord Jesus you are our great king you are the high King Of Heaven Lord you are the alpha and omega Lord there's no one besides thee Lord Jesus you're the great king of glory Lord you are alone the author of Salvation and we so thankful that by your shed blood we can come into your great presence tonight and we just want to pray Lord may you come O God and change our lives Lord we want to be surrendered to you Lord May moles and shape us Lord more into your image of your word oh God and we thank you Lord we can gather tonight Lord and we just want to pray you would have preeminence and just take over o God Lord that we would Lord that that we could say after the service we'd say all we saw was you shining through us oh God shining through every believer Lord Jesus that's what we want to see oh God anyone who may be watching as well dear God be their portion as well we love you Lord we commit Our Lives into your hands those who are sick and body May touch them oh God those who have a spiritual need May touch them Lord Jesus and those who Lord who don't know you Lord may you meet them Father granted Lord and Jesus Christ's name amen God bless your friends you may have your seats tonight so I want to speak about as brother Brown preached a service perfect strength and perfect weakness and I found it very interesting here in Hebrews chapter 11 it says that out of weakness were made strong so they you know the world is very opposite when you think about what the world because because the world would say out of strength you'd get strength but when it comes to the believer it's out of weakness you're made strong and when and when we get perfect strength out of perfect weakness we know that that strength is not human strength that we get they did not they were not made strong humanly amen but it was a supernatural power of God that made them strong now I'm talking about more than physical strength because you know we have a strength that we can uh possess that is not human it's more than lifting rates uh weights or being like a Samson but we have a strength that can take us through every trial can can overcome every enemy now I was thinking this is quite a quite an opposite kind of a subject when you think about a message Fellowship of the Bride of Jesus Christ and how often we talk about how the devil's under our feet and all had powered heavens and earth has been placed in our hand and we've been made in His image and we're we're the Overcomers of this age and you know God's been waiting for us to take our position and the Rapture will go and you know but yet it's out of weakness that that can be made manifest amen where it's not it's not out of strength we get strength but it's out of weakness we're made strong but it's such a contrast to this day and age we live where where um when when our lord Jesus would would would show John in the Book of Revelation the he would describe the age we live in speaking the later CN age you'd say because they'll say so I'm rich increase with goods and have need of nothing and no it's not Thou Art Richard miserable poor and blind and naked so basically someone who says they have need of nothing they'd say I have strength I have all that I need I don't need any more than I have I have enough Amen to to walk through life and to walk a Victorious walk but I believe that we aren't a people that say we have need of nothing but I believe we're people that say Lord I need more of you Lord I cannot take another step Without You guiding my hand I can't I can't face life without you lord without you I am nothing oh God and Lord I I have no strength or ability in my own self and you know it's such an important thing always to realize that he is the vine and we are the branches and Jesus said without without me you can do nothing and how true that is who feels that way without the Lord we can't do anything now this does not mean we sit down in a pity party saying poor me I'm weak I'm useless I'm no good for nothing get that out of your head when I'm talking about weakness I'm not talking about oh look at me and woe is me and all these excuses like Moses had no weakness is a dependency upon God and if you're really that kind of a weakness then God can live through your life and then you become Strong by his strength amen so it's very important that we always are dependent upon our Lord that you know we know that sheep as we are likened under sheep sheep always need a Shepherd they always need a guide they can get lost very easily they can be you know even in their home kind of area they don't roam very far if they do they can get lost very easily they don't have a homing signal or a nature like a animal that will migrate sheep are very useless animals okay Hallelujah we don't have you know sheep don't have don't have big teeth or big claws or run fast or climb trees or you know they have no real natural defense mechanism and we're liking under that but a sheep that thinks they can do it all the big Ram who thinks it's got it all together that one's going to be taken out but the sheep that stick close to the shepherd they're the ones are gonna gonna survive the journey doesn't matter how big the Predator how you'll be a line or a bear whatever it may be amen if if we stick close to the shepherd because we realize without him we cannot walk amen we'll be strong praise God and you're glad we have a great Shepherd he's a present help in time of trouble amen he's not like these yeah I remember being this kind of age you know being on my um uncle's farm and my friend's Farms you know they're big stations up the east coast and you know we would be driving sheep from Paddock to Paddock and cattle and different things you know that's not how God leads us he doesn't drive us like that he doesn't use dogs and barking and noise and confusion to drive us down the road no he leads us he goes before us so we've got to realize that the trail run he's already walked into it he stepped into it before you ever stepped into it praise the Lord Jesus amen but it's very it's very important because this world is all about a super strength super intelligence you see people because of Technology can do and imagine things they could never do even a generation ago you know they talk about you know great great football stars like Pele that passed recently and you know you know what a what a mighty Sportsman he was but if you compare him to the Sportsman of today he's nothing you see the replays of the goals he did it looks like Amateur hour compared to the ones today why because there's a super ability now there's strength and training and people think that they you know it's their own strength it goes from strength to strength but with the Christian it goes from weakness to strength you know it's not intelligence that causes us to overcome you know we after brotherbraham says he says it's very important that that you know if we expect to fulfill God's desire in our life that we have to master the thought of human ability if we ever get to a spot where we think we can do it with our own intelligence and our own abilities we've got to master that in such a way that we can get rid of the thing and lay it aside so God can use us that's right and it might and make a complete surrender we cannot use one ability we have got to make a complete surrender and come to God we've got to surrender to him both Body Soul and Spirit everything that you are has to be surrendered to God in order that he can work his will and you and me so he says this is the first thing we've got to do he says especially to Young preachers and lay members alike is is if we expect to fulfill God's desire in our life as we have to master the thought of human ability now the thought of human ability means that we that we think it's our ability that can do the job like for example you know I've stood here for a few few Services now right this is not my first rodeo that yo our musicians our you know other brothers in the church Sunday school teachers you know this is not our first rodeo we are 10 years down the road now we've done a few things right but the danger with that is when we get to a place we think I can do this now I can do this now I know what to say I know the scripture I can put together a thought in a certain way and it's all human ability but we've got to master the thought that our human ability can actually make the kingdom of God go forward because it's not by a power or by might it's by his Spirit saith the Lord you know brother Braham says about this age well Jesus that he said we're rich increase with goods and people think it's it takes money to make the kingdom of God go forward it's never been money it's the spirit of God that makes the kingdom of God go forward it's not financial resources that actually matter as the spirit of God makes it go forward amen you see and you know I just gone by Believers have been dirt dirt poor have nothing but yet God moved in great power amen so we've got to realize it's not the number of figures in a bank account which gives us success it's the spirit of God that gives us success amen so we need to always keep that understanding we've got to master the thought of human ability you know because there's a there's a big difference between having an ability and having God use that ability or actually surrendering that ability to God so for example I can stand here and I could preach a whole series using my own ability and it may sound all very fine it may be completely correct but that's me using my ability or or singers can sing musicians can play song leaders can song Lead Sunday school teachers can be Sunday school teachers in their own human ability but when God takes that person he amends it at the end and that's what we're looking for is God to come down and amen the service right amen the song service where God's presence comes out amen especially where God anoints that special that's when that person has surrendered their human ability and God is using that person who wants to be like that where God amends your life see Jesus said that you're it's two witnesses it's me and my father we are the witnesses that what I'm saying is true why because Jesus spoke and then the Lord confirmed it through him it wasn't just Idle Words you know he could have been very eloquent or well we know the Common People heard him gladly but what I'm saying is he could have put it all together just perfectly but without God himself Amen in his ministry just like the prophet of God without God coming service after service Discerning the thoughts and Tents of the heart revealing people's needs supernaturally totally without he didn't have an equal in his time Tommy Osborne wasn't on the same level you know you know Billy Graham didn't have the same things you know oh Roberts wasn't on the same page as that unique Ministry thereby said without him I can do nothing that was brother Branham and he he mastered the thought of human ability and we must master that same thought where we think we can be the Christian our own selves we are licked we are defeated right there if you think you can put together the right answer and say well I know the scripture I know the message I know I know you've got a problem because you've got I in that sentence amen but if you know well I know the answer I know the author the author is the answer then he can use you if you're fully surrendered to him amen so we must Master this thought of human ability because what is this world full of human ability and look at the technology look at this you know you know back in my day we had dial-up modems when I was young we played we played games with other friends over dial up you know the internet was barely even a thing and look now we can't live without it you can be in virtual reality on the other side of the world it's just gone Quantum leap's way because man has used his own human ability to to to tap into these things and create them now if they can do that in the natural side how much more now people can surrender their human ability surrender their own selves that God can use them you see God has a lot of just because people have abilities God can't use those abilities God is not God didn't call you because of maybe you can speak well or maybe you can play well or maybe you can sing well or maybe you can pray well or maybe you can sympathize or love well no he didn't call you because of that see if you think you've got something to give to God to use you are not even in the picture with him you think look I've got this I can give you God God doesn't use it see the Apostle Peter had a lot of abilities but he was not made the spokesman you know in the book of Acts preaching the first ever first ever church service because of his abilities or his personality personality or ability doesn't place you in a position in the body of Christ God does many times as the person you think shouldn't be in that place is God's ordained person so so you know you know Peter had that kind of a nature where he is the first one to answer he was the only one who walked on water not once but twice you know he he he said Lord you know I'll I'll go with you to the death he didn't just say it he tried to kill that God The Sword in the garden and all those things but yet God had to bring him to such a place where he where where where where he got on such a road of failure because his own human abilities took him to that place of utter failure where where he denied the Lord three times when the Lord's being judged there in Jasmine Hall when the when the Lord really needed him he said I'm I'm going to be right there with you and he buckled under just some questioning of some women and stuff outside why because God had to bring him to a place that he realized himself his own human Ability Counts for nothing and that's the same thing with you and I we can be in church for a very long time and we can be fighting and fighting and God can be we can try and push forward we just get pushed back God just you know resist the proud We have trouble in grinding all these things going on but we think we can do it what's that God trying to get us to realize we're whipped that we can really come to him hello how how's everyone on Wednesday night because we're going to get to the place like Peter did amen but the thing about Peter the great thing about Peter is he even though he came to that point where he miserably failed you know he thought how can the Lord ever receive me again I've just failed him completely but yet he still went to him on that Resurrection morning when they're fishing even went back to his old life he realized his ability of a fisherman was a useless failure he caught fish in that same Lake he went to the same spots no doubt got nothing we're fished all night and he's got this Yo's Hearts like a lead balloon and his you know you know you know in his in his chest I failed the Lord he told me I'd deny but my pride said I wouldn't do it doesn't matter how strong-willed you are you'll come to a place where it comes to nothing and that's God's grace dude you know that that's actually God's grace when you come to the end of yourself when you're when it feels like you're hitting a head-butting a brick wall yeah why can't we get resolution in this why can't I get peace in this area why is it God's trying to get you to a place where you just raise your hands and say Lord here I am I've tried my own ability to make this right I've tried I've tried everything I can I've thought every different angle all different kind of things and God's saying the answer I have for you is not in your ability your ability is just making yourself miserable so why don't you just give him the ability and give them yourself in the same time and let him come in and take over your life but you see a difference with Peter as he went to the Lord anyway he jumped in he didn't wait for the others to get you know catch the lot whatever he just went straight to the Lord not knowing if he'll be received or not but he went anyway to me that's a true seed of God no matter how much we fail how much we fall in our faces we go to him anyway Hallelujah that's why the Lord would ask him Peter do you love me ask them three times I believe that because he denied them three times Hallelujah right but you see Peter had a lot of abilities but God couldn't use any of them but you see the reason that he was the spokesman on the uh you know the first ever church service is not because of his personality not because he has a Firebrand not because of his ability to speak or whatever more the reason he was a spokesman in the book of Acts there in Acts chapter 2 is because he was given the keys to the kingdom because the other member remember remember he he was the first one to answer when they said who do you say I am he says Thou Art the Christ the son of living God and and you know Jesus said bless are you Simon bar Jonah ability hasn't given this to you your own gray matter hasn't worked this out it wasn't your human ability that made you realize I'm the Christ it wasn't the apostles it wasn't the general trending thoughts on Twitter that got you here it was a revelation for my Father in Heaven it says Upon This Rock of Revelation I'll build my church you see we've got to come to a place the scribes and Pharisees had a lot of theological ability but they couldn't identify the Messiah in their midst but you see Jesus said to Peter you know and and I'll give you the keys to the kingdom what do you bind on Earth shall be bound in heaven what's loose on Earth shall be loosed in heaven and we know a key opens a door and he used that key three times and it opened the door to all the kingdoms I mean all the peoples of the Earth the Jews the Samaritans which are half Jew and Gentile and the Gentiles don't know why I'm raising four fingers facing yes somehow I got through maths I don't know how that worked out praise God anyway but you see he opened that door why because he said on the day of Pentecost so the Jews repent be baptized everyone you're in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sin and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost In other words repent be baptized in his name and this key is going to open the door you'll receive the kingdom of God which is the Holy Ghost the king of God is within you then he went down to to Philip was in Samaria well half Jew and gentile people laid his hands upon them they received the Holy Ghost then he was sent to cornelius's house the Gentiles and there's his preaching the Holy Ghost fell upon them then they got baptized the same way in the name of Jesus Christ what he opened he used those keys to the Jews the Gentiles and the Samaritans to the whole world and that and that approach to God still works today who can testify of that Hallelujah so you see now the reason he was a spokes from the book of Exodus not because of Personality not because of ability because because God gave him the keys to the kingdom amen now it's amazing where where how we have to come to a spot where we don't lean on upon some great person brother and says in the same um message when we're expecting saying this guy he's a great person this is a great person I'll just lean upon him that deplete displeases God when you do that we must lean upon God and God Alone we mustn't trust the ability of ourselves or any man we must completely yield to God so you know we can't we can't be caught up in our favorite preacher I'll just lean upon him he really knows this stuff the Lord really uses him and I'm just going to trust in him and no no that displeases God because we elevate a part of the body to a place where it should never be where our affections our attentions go on what he's saying and then someone can stand on here like on a Wednesday and just kind of spread some words out you know and God can be working in exactly the same manner see so we can't have you know the days have gone where we gather around a Ministry we're called together on Jesus Christ the word right Jesus Christ the word see that's that's who we must lean upon is Jesus Christ the word not to be caught up brother Ram said I'm here I'm I I'm here to allow a platform for someone great to come after me who was that that was Jesus Christ the word as John the Baptist 4 on the first coming of Christ so his ministry for around the second what did John do introduce the Lamb of God to the people then he went off the scene what did Brother Brown do introduce the Lamb of God Jesus Christ the word to the people then he went off the scene right so it's the word that we're caught up and not in the personality of a man amen if we lean upon a person it will displease God Isaiah was a great prophet but he had a bad influence in his life of actually a Godly King Uriah or uziah if I've got that right you see he was he was so influenced by this King he leaned on him too much but God had to open up basically the Bible within a book because of 66 chapters in Isaiah 66 books in the Bible and if you look in the book of Isaiah he goes from you know the beginning you know even before where he says you know Lucifer that son of the morning but you'll cut down all those things Isaiah 14 then he talks about John the Baptist talks about the Messiah he talks about new heavens and new earth so the whole Bible's within that book right but you see God had to get him from out of the influence of the king that God could speak to him why because he was leaning upon the king too much that's why God had to take that King out of the way and that's the same thing with us if we lean upon a person too much well that person see you bye because God wants your attention he wants to speak to you he wants to walk with you he doesn't want you to walk through a Ministry amen remember remember we don't worship God through a church like denominations we'll go to a church they think they're worshiping God through that church but we worship God through the word right we approach God through his word not through a church who's with me who understands the difference right we're not here to worship God through a Creed or denomination where our Founders a million years ago did this no we worship God through the Living Word that's why the thing is if this place cease to be I trust and pray that we'll keep all of us will keep walking on with God we may move to different places whatever I'm not saying it will fall apart what I'm saying is I trust you're not a Believer because of these four walls if you're a Believer because of these four walls we have miserably I have miserably failed but if you're a Believer because you have a true experience with Jesus Christ according to his word and you walk with him I've succeeded Hallelujah I can just rest and praise God amen isn't that right I mean because that's why I wanted for people to have an individual Walk With Jesus Christ the word amen not be caught up in a personality of a person or a preacher whatever more those days are gone praise God and they should stay gone I mean there's some things that's got a big sticker do not resuscitate on it's one of them amen you see now we have to come to a spot like Isaiah where influences are gone and then God can speak to us and then when he got into God's presence he confessed the insufficiency of the people in his own abilities when you get into the prince of God you realize you've got nothing to offer but yet the coal of fire came in and cleansed his lips cleansed them and then God said he'll go for us he just said Lord I here I am send me he didn't say you know God I've got the credentials I'm a prophet you know you've kind of spoken to me before I've got ability I've got influence with the king and you know no no none of that he said why was me I I'm a man of unclean lips I live in a Land of unclean people he realized his own insufficiency and it's a great place to be when you realize you're all insufficient now that that feeling or that recognition doesn't make yourself a pity party saying well I'm just useless throwing me away God that's wrong that's Pride right but when you realize you're insufficient he can come into your life and be the sufficient one yes amen I've got a scripture here it says here in um second Corinthians uh three and three to six he says for as much as we are manifestly declared to be the Epistle of Christ ministered by US Written not with ink but with the spirit of the Living God not in tables of stone but in fleshly tables of the heart and such trust uh have we through Christ to godward not that we are sufficient of ourselves to think anything as of ourselves but our sufficiency is of God now you think about who's writing this this is the Apostle Paul this is the Apostle Paul writing this is the this is the man that God allowed to to to position law and Grace right to write most of the New Testament he says you know that we do not have sufficiency not that we are sufficient of ourselves to think anything as of ourselves so basically we don't think we have it all together we don't think you know God's commissioned us that we can just walk on you know people can get in such a way when they become Christians they can become arrogant take a look I'm a believer I'm in I'm above everyone else I'm better than everyone else that's wrong we should never have that kind of an attitude and then people could get the Holy Ghost and they go you know chasing gifts and trying to trying to trying to work out their ministry that's wrong too God will lead you to it God will lead you to it it's not what you imagine for God to make you no God will make you something and it's normally the the complete opposite to think to what you think you should be praise God Hallelujah sufficiency means to be the ability or competency to do a thing so so the Apostle Paul is saying our sufficiency or our ability or competency to do do this thing is of the Lord amen I trust you have that same um testimony your sufficiency is of God amen where the next verse would say who has also made us able Ministers of the New Testament not of the letter above of the spirit for the letter killeth but the spirit giveth life Hallelujah now this was the Apostle Paul saying this this is not just um Joe Christian average you know this is the Apostle Paul he's the first church age messenger God gave him the abundance of you know you know incredible Revelations that that that we feed on now he was caught up into the third heaven many many incredible things happened to him but it's amazing because before before he went uh before he met God on the road to Damascus he would have said my sufficiency is of being a Pharisee of the Pharisees my ability or competency is in my wisdom my competency or my ability is because I studied hard because I have good intellect I can recall the scripture just like this and I know all the laws and I know how to do everything I I I I but when the Lord got him on the road to Damascus there he realized that his sufficiency was actually a man-made sufficiency by a man-made religion and it was a man-made high priest that commissioned him to do a man-made job right we don't want to have a man-made religion and a man-made sufficiency right and when he met the Lord he realized his own ability he says I counted all but done that I may win Christ see everything he thought he was he actually on a scale he said no what I think I am has actually done Hallelujah all the awards all the plaques all the all the Gunning ceremonies all the degrees he had he put it into one classification done why is that he had to do that because he realized actually you know my own human ability has actually been the biggest hindrance I've had in my life because his own human ability made him actually persecute the very God he thought he was serving and how can we get to a spot where we think well I know the message I know the quotes I know all these things and yet your own ability actually fighting the very God you think you're serving oh my Moses Moses had a lot of abilities we know that Moses was a Moses was going to be potentially the next pharaoh in Egypt Pharaohs were gods they weren't just even how we treat the royalty uh how yo yo people people talk about royalty nowadays you'd never have you know if there's Paparazzi in those days they would have been taken out they would have been taken because they had an image to uphold you know all the ugly bits of their lives they would never have been broadcast there would have been a lot of dead journalists and stuff right because they were they were considered gods and I I believe they believed they were deity and flesh so so Moses was was crafted and taught and schooled to embody the same persona so you think about how Moses the Bible says that well this is after he met the Lord on the road um in the burning bush says Moses was the meekest man in all the Earth he he wasn't born meek he wasn't Mighty Moses The Prince of Egypt ruler of you know conqueror of Ethiopia or whatever he did all the great military campaigns he led he wasn't the meekest man all the Earth in that moment how would you ever craft a prince to be a Meek man when you know it's strength it takes strength to conquer it takes strength to rule that's what they were taught you would never train him up in a way now Moses you see how you know Ramsay says all these things you're not meant to be the like that you're meant to be Moses the meek Prince of Egypt now he wouldn't he wasn't taught that way he was taught the opposite Moses you're a God and flesh you may be Pharaoh one day you're more than a man Moses you know any any and he taught you know he learned all the wisdom of the Egyptians very smart man so he had a lot of abilities but he had to lose every one of them to fulfill his part of the scripture he had to lose every one of them and it took 40 years on the right yo yo the back side of the desert with a high-tempered wife to get it out of him he was high tempered sapora was high tempered too you know when when when the angel came to kill him because he didn't circumcise his son or his sons and you know she said you're a bloody husband to me you know just just let a temper go why it was 40 Years of grinding God had to strip him that's amazing you know we think it's it's trolls everyone else and we just caught in the trial now actually a trials about us too and actually we can be the cause of the trial you know Moses maybe had a lot of hard Seasons you know lambing season was hard there's not much grass and trouble at home troubling trouble at work he had trouble ever in his life what was happening God was bringing him down to nothing that he could Elevate him to be there's not another Prophet like Moses Hallelujah I spoke looked to air too amen so he had to lose every one of those every one of those abilities or what he thought was abilities that God could get a hold of his life you think about him you know a pharaoh would have been a great orator he would have been very good he would have been confident everywhere he went he didn't get stage fright this is God and flesh we're talking about you know you know he wasn't just a he didn't get nervous but God stripped him down in such a way that when God made him he said I can't speak you know I'm slow of tongue no one's going to hear me you know I can't do the job but the first 40 Years of his life he thought I am ready and he killed that Egyptian because he was now fully trained and equipped to do the job in his own strength but he was trying to get strength out of strength to fulfill the word of God and he miserably failed so God had to bring him down to nothing God knows how to do a job God knows how to get us ready God knows how to prepare us God knows the time that we're going to meet him and he's very good at grinding us down I know there's not a Hallelujah kind of service but we need to re-look at our trials in our life because if we think we have the ability to go in a Rapture and to spread this word in our own strength nothing's going to happen but if we fully surrender our all our lives all the way our West love the Lord our hearts all mind and strength you know that God can work on us then God's ability comes in then we're no longer weak but we are strong because of his Amen brother Brahm says see uh see see no ability I don't care what it is it'll be never be able to be usable in the sight of God God has to get all of our abilities out of us before he can achieve his purpose if he has got something for us to do as long as we feel that we're doing a pretty good job out of it we'll then we'll never be able to be used of God amen see he had to lose all those abilities and God made him on the back side of the days of the burning bush transformed his life and one 80 year old man turned over the superpower of the age and took his people out Hallelujah why because he fully surrendered his abilities everything he was into the hands of God and he realized there's nothing all his abilities did was killed one Egyptian and he had to run for his life but God's ability in him just opened the Red Sea brought brought the plagues brought Deliverance did everything amen because it was God's ability in him amen see we've got to get away from that human ability we've got to get to a place where we can surrender our souls Our Lives even to the housewives to the farmer to the mechanic or whoever we are we've got to completely surrender to God and know that we are nothing then God then let God start from there then he starts moving working and that includes all of us everyone the thing that we've got to do Amen to get to a place where that we know we're nothing then he starts working from there they say that's not a good place to be that's the best place to be where you think you are the you are the epitome of the message of the hour God don't even you're over there somewhere but when you say Lord I Have Nothing take the surrendered vessel Lord Use Me For Your Glory then God can start working I mean just a complete total surrender of your weakness under God say Here I Am have nothing no ability that you can trust in Hallelujah the Apostle Paul What a Mighty as I said what a what a mighty What a Mighty Warrior Fighter for the gospel his life was incredible what he went through but he never got to a place where he thought well I have it all together but he let his human weakness he glorified the Bible says in his infirmities so he didn't make an idol out of them but he realized Lord the reason I am weak is so your strength can be manifested because many times we well the world teaches us in order to be successful we have to have it all together we have to be smart we have to be strong we're to be beautiful we're to be handsome we've got to be be able to uh you know articulate our words and speak well and do everything well no but that's the opposite to what God wants God wants the ones God wants people that people will never consider God wants the unlikelies he wants the outcasts he wants to down and outs those are the people God uses out of that weaknesses strength is manifested Hallelujah praise the Lord amen so he says oh I belong to the biggest church here in the country you know I'm this Lord oh I'm Pentecostal I say oh I'm in the message glory to God I just received the Holy Ghost the other night Hallelujah you're going to make me do so and so God can't use that a bit of that whenever you get looked and realized you're looked and then come back and humble yourself get weak find out you're human and there's none of your intellectuals can do it human weakness will never be used of God God by the human weaknesses pours himself into you then he uses himself praise God when we because you know how you know the the person that upsets us the most is the person in the mirror and that's when you're standing in front of their mirror Alone by the way not when you've got your spouse or someone next to you it's you alone looking in the mirror just in case some of you thought well it's her it's him no no my you know my brother my sister said no no no no it's you when you're having a one-on-one teeth brushing session by yourself it's that person and and we get so annoyed at our own our own personality our own Humanity but let God use that weakness that you feel and he pours himself into you and then he uses himself in you and you just become an instrument certainly you've got to get yourself out of the way Moses oh he learned he learned human weakness real good he learned it so well to when God called him he had seven weaknesses that he could argue against God's call did you ever study that in the first part of Exodus the seven weaknesses he says I got them roped down here I want you to listen to the first weakness he had was a lack of a message the second week weaknesses he had was a lack of authority the third witness he had was a lack of eloquence the fourth was um adoption uh the fifth was success the sixth was one uh one was exception you know being accepted now you compare yours with his and see if you can come up with that see if you can get as weak as he was Lord I ain't no good I can't speak I slew an Egyptian I can't go back out everything they won't receive leave me I have no message I can't speak I'm slow in speech see how he was he was nothing brother he'd been cured he'd been cured Hallelujah he'd been cured of being oh I'm a God in Egypt he got cured of that when he came down to that spot saying lord I can't do anything you've asked me to do he was cured Hallelujah do you think he is feeling happy no but he was cured amen see people always want to feel good but if we feel good about ourselves and well I can do it look at me and look at my successes look at all these things God can't use that now I don't mean you have to feel bad about yourself but you've got to realize your sufficiency is of God hope that came out right amen see he had been cured see God can use him after he was cured see yeah amen Hallelujah you see you praise the Lord see see um he says here there's just a few a few um points oh to a man or woman that's weak enough that realizes your weakness then let God use you he says now the Apostle Paul say he was such a mighty man of his of his day and he was a warrior that stripped himself as of of all his abilities he thought he had and he says if there's anything that our schools need today if there's anything our churches needs today is the stripping of themselves of their own thoughts and their own abilities strip yourself before God unless you could try to do something within yourself see we can't do anything within ourselves why are you saying these things before a prayer service because God is the god who answers prayer but if we approach them like we have an ability and God has to listen to you because of who you are that's not a humble approach see he resists the proud and gives grace to the humble amen and why do we pray to God God ultimately as God change my mind to match your mind my Father in heaven Hallowed be thy name thy kingdom come thy will be done in earth as it is in heaven which earth oh many times talk about countries Nations politics economics whatever more no it's this Earth the will needs to be done in first Hallelujah and they said how do you within within in prayer what does that Lord change my mind and my heart to match yours Lord You're not I have a lot of needs and you said come to me with my needs so so I'm coming Lord I have this big list but Lord you're not an errand boy to me you're not some servant you're not some PA I call up and say now listen Mr Jesus you know I want this by this time amen we love you that's not how it works that is the wrong approach well Lord you better listen to me I'm the bride of Christ I'm your wife you better toe the line and this is what I need and right now no Lord your king see many people want him as a savior but they don't want him as Lord he is our Lord and savior you've got to have him as both amen he's our King right he can do what he wants so we need to come in a real no I'm not saying you're not humble right but you know we've got to get this idea out of our heads about our own human ability maybe I've just been thinking about myself a bit you know welcome for me just speaking my thoughts about me to you right but you know we've got to realize that that we when we realize we're weak then we can be strong now wait let's just um I think I'm running out of what I got here now if we go to the scripture and we go to Second Corinthians well let's go to First Corinthians two and one first okay see this is the kind of man the Apostle Paul became Hallelujah you know he is the model of every true minister right he had a word he preached the word of the day he had a he had a god anointed Ministry right he didn't deviate from the truth amen he was a god called God sent minister and every true Minister patents after the Apostle Paul he says and Brethren when I came to you came not with Excellency of speech nor of wisdom declaring unto you the testimony of God for I determined not to know anything among you saved Jesus Christ and him crucified and I was with you in in what strength and eloquence inability and and and Persona and Charisma no I was with you in weakness and in fear and much trembling and my speech my preaching was not with enticing words of man wisdom but the demonstration of the spirit and of power that your face should not stand in the wisdom of men but in the power of God so this is how he was he wasn't a Hollywood Showman he came in fear and weakness and a much trembling because he was Desiring above everything that their faith would not stand in his wisdom but it would stand in the power of God that when the Apostle Paul left they weren't following the Apostle Paul right they were caught up in Jesus Christ they met him so he would say that the Apostle Paul would would go into a place and make one convert come back a few weeks later and there'd be 30 converts from that one why because the people's confidence was in the power of God praise the Lord second Corinthians 3 and and three to six for as much as you oh no sorry I read that one second Corinthians 12 and 6. for though I desire to Glory I shall not be a fool for I will say the truth but now I forbear at least any man should think of me above that which he seeth me to be or that heareth of me and this I should be exalted above measure through the abundance of the revelations it was given to me a thorn in the flesh now we didn't read it but before this he speaks about a man being taken up to the third heaven that was himself but the heaven of heavens he was he was taken beyond the curtain of time if we put it into message language right so so he talks about this and he comes down into this line of thought here at least I should be exalted about the measure through the abundance of the revelations that were given to me a thorn in the flesh the messenger of Satan to buffer me lest I shall be exalted above measure for this thing I besought the Lord Thrice that it might depart from me and he said it he said unto me my grace is sufficient for thee for my strength is made perfect in weakness most gladly therefore will I rather glory in my infirmities that the power of Christ May rest upon me therefore I take pleasure in infirmities and reproaches and necessities and persecutions and distresses for Christ's sake for when I am weak then am I strong Hallelujah sorry sorry says now he says so my strength so he had the sword on the flesh and because he's thinking maybe within himself if I just get rid of this thing I can be a better Christian if I could this thing that buffets me if I can just get rid of it then I can have a closer walk with God I can really overcome I can really be successful if I get rid of these things but then the Lord said no my grace is sufficient for thee for my strength is made perfect in weakness so he began to Rejoice because he realized actually this thing is in my life for my good Hallelujah and this thing is not actually here to hinder my Christian walk it's here to actually drive me more towards God so how was your problems in your life what does it do because many times you think well if I didn't have this person in my life and if this wasn't going on at work and if I didn't have this bank account trouble and then if this wasn't going on then I'd rarely be a Christian no that wasn't the Apostle Paul thought after the Lord met him he just praised God Hallelujah he just he realized no I'm just going to glory in my infirmities amen amen because why the Lord's strength is made perfect in weakness now some people think this Thorn In the Flesh was some besetting sin it wasn't a besetting sin some people think well I've got this lust problem this pornographic problem I just can't overcome it but it's a thought in the flesh to keep me humble no that's unbelief speaking that's ridiculous no that is just actually people being a human shield for a devil because they enjoy it so it was not some unclean I mean you know it wasn't a besetting sin in his life that the soul of the flesh was we know that amen but he realized that the Lord's strength is made perfect in weakness so I find you know in life when things are really actually stressful you know there's great problems is actually when God can come on the scene in a far greater way then everything's fine and I believe that's how the Apostle Paul found it that he glories in his infirmities well he didn't complain about the trouble he had he just praised God anyhow why that the power of Christ May rest upon him Hallelujah amen as long as we are trying in ourselves and and depending on our own abilities and so forth well we'll do nothing and when we get to a place where we know we're nothing then God can use us Hallelujah well I'm just going to finish sorry this is I'm going to um see I'm just going to finish with this thought here there's there's on the Apostle Paul that's from when we read um First Corinthians uh two right he says I was with you in greatness and what weakness and fear are much trembling can you imagine a man a Pharisee of the Pharisees a teacher of the teachers a man that was trained from childhood for the ministry to be an eloquent man that was smart brilliant and come before a class of people like the Corinthians and say I was with you in meekness and in fear and much trembling a man who turned the world upside down the greatest missionary that was ever known confessed that he came in weakness not as a trained scholar but in the weakness and fear at least he would step off the path somewhere see he didn't want to let popularity a woman or money or anything of the world make him step off the path of Walking with God that's why he was in fear and much trembling right that the he's afraid that people would Elevate him above who he really was because he could not trust in his own ability the reason he was fearing not because he was scared of anything but he was scared he would displease God in some way that he would get his own ability mixed up into it something that he had learned that he had he was telling them that I didn't come to you with this Excellency of speech I come to you in fear that I would come that way but I come to you knowing nothing but Christ and him crucified and I come to you in fear and weakness most trembling in my speech and my preaching was not with enticing words of man's Wisdom but in demonstration of the spirit and power listen to this man who was a warrior had stripped himself amen if there's anything that our schools need today anything our churches need today is the stripping of ourselves of our own thoughts and of our own abilities strip yourself before God unless you try to do something within yourselves amen so friends out of weakness comes strength perfect strength isn't perfect weakness many times we think man I need to get perfectly strong that I'll get perfect and then I have perfect strength no if you have perfect weakness then you have perfect strength why because out of weakness comes his strength life's not so bad after all is it the Lord allows us to be in a way where we depend upon him that his strength can come into our lives and he can manifest his word and when you look back and see what everything he did would you want to trade that for I'm the big shot and look how great I am and me me me and no power of God living I'd rather have the Lord live but the Apostle Paul he gloried in his affirmities his Necessities all the trouble he had and God lived in his life who wants to be that kind of a person Hallelujah amen let's um so we're gonna have a time of prayer now we have a few prayer requests so we're going to I was going to read these out and if anyone else has any more and then we'll sing a song and then we'll go into prayer so it's opafani's last
