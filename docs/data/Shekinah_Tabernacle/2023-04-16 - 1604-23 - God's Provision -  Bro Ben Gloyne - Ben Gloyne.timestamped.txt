[7:27] it's good to be in the house of the Lord
[7:29] this morning
[7:30] good to see you all feeling good
[7:33] [Music]
[7:35] feeling Victorious
[7:38] hey man you know Christian always wins
[7:41] even if it may not appear so at the time
[7:43] we're always winning
[7:45] you know when the when the children of
[7:48] Israel the Lord said to Moses went after
[7:50] they got LED out of the
[7:52] um
[7:53] out of Egypt the Lord said to Moses lead
[7:56] them in a certain direction over to the
[7:57] certain place
[7:59] he led them there and then I don't know
[8:02] maybe a few days later
[8:04] it looked like they had been LED right
[8:06] into a trap and that all was lost you
[8:08] know as the pharaoh changed his mind on
[8:10] letting them go and he decided I'm
[8:11] actually going to go there and wipe them
[8:13] all out and it appeared
[8:16] for all intents and purposes like that
[8:18] was the end of them it appeared like
[8:19] everything was going wrong but the Lord
[8:21] was in control of the whole situation he
[8:23] led them there and he hardened fear his
[8:25] heart to lead Pharaoh there so that he
[8:28] could wipe him out once and for all but
[8:30] at the time it was I think it was
[8:32] relatively hard to see if you were
[8:34] standing there by the Sea and seeing
[8:35] Pharaoh's Army coming towards you but
[8:37] you know it doesn't matter what
[8:39] situation you are in in your life the
[8:41] Lord has always got it all under control
[8:43] Don't Worry About a Thing If It appears
[8:46] like you're in a bad spot you're not the
[8:47] Lord's LED you there and he's got it all
[8:49] under control
[8:50] that's the God we serve and let's sing
[8:52] some songs of praise and victory this
[8:54] morning and declare him to be the king

[43:10] our bodies but may touch our Spirits
[43:11] touch our souls oh god father bring a
[43:13] healing Lord and the Inner Man Grant it
[43:16] father we love you so much we thank you
[43:18] we could read your word together we pray
[43:19] Lord may you anoint it now Lord not just
[43:21] speak about hearer as well oh God anoint
[43:24] all of us father
[43:25] and Jesus Christ's name amen amen God
[43:28] bless you friends you may have your
[43:30] seats uh this morning
[43:33] so I'd like to I'd like to speak this
[43:35] morning on God's God's provision
[43:37] amen we see that you know with with uh
[43:40] Abraham here you know God God provided
[43:42] for every step of his journey where he
[43:45] wasn't just here on Mount Moriah where
[43:47] God would provide but we know God before
[43:49] this where where the Lord came to him
[43:51] said I'm the Lord God Almighty you know
[43:53] and you know that's the strong yo the El
[43:55] Shaddai the strong the breasted one you
[43:57] know God provided strength from to draw
[43:59] off to to to get strength to to make the
[44:02] promise manifest in his life of a
[44:04] promised son so God provided God was
[44:06] Jehovah Jireh for every step of his
[44:09] journey amen it's the same thing with
[44:10] you and I he is Jehovah Jireh for every
[44:13] step of our Earthly Journey amen he does
[44:15] not provide in the beginning of our walk
[44:17] where we first meet him then he then
[44:18] then he runs out of Supply no but he
[44:20] supplies everything we have need of you
[44:22] look at how how Abraham had a revelation
[44:25] where Isaac was carrying the word and
[44:26] he's wondering where the sacrifice was
[44:28] and and and Abraham said by faith God
[44:31] will provide himself a sacrifice so it's
[44:34] not us providing the sacrifice or
[44:36] anything to meet our needs as he has
[44:38] provided amen so he's looking Abraham's
[44:41] Faith declared that the lamb was already
[44:44] there amen and we know that you know
[44:45] when when because God wasn't wondering
[44:48] actually what Abraham was going to do
[44:50] he already knew what he was going to do
[44:51] God knows what we're going to do but God
[44:53] allows us to go through trials and tests
[44:55] to prove really what's on the inside of
[44:57] us I mean because God had to reveal to
[44:59] Abraham who Abraham was God knew who
[45:01] Abraham was but God had to provide had
[45:03] to show Abraham who he really was and so
[45:06] when Abraham began to see Faith
[45:07] expressed in his life he began to
[45:09] realize that he was more than just a man
[45:12] or more than just a um you know thank
[45:14] God for aircon we're comfortable aren't
[45:16] we oh we're too warm too cold it's fine
[45:18] amen but you know God would provide
[45:20] himself I mean a a sacrifice and and
[45:24] Abraham's Faith was declaring what God
[45:26] had placed there now isn't it amazing
[45:28] that Abraham behind him heard thee heard
[45:30] the lamb bleeding Corner Thicket God
[45:33] created that lamb right there because
[45:35] God knew he would need that lamb and
[45:37] it's the same thing with every part of
[45:39] our Earthly Journey whether it be
[45:40] financially Natural Things spiritual
[45:43] things God will provide amen God will
[45:45] provide a house God will provide a job
[45:47] God will provide support God will
[45:49] provide everything we have need of we
[45:52] just need to walk in faith amen praise
[45:54] God so you know I was going to call this
[45:56] message God's response but I was
[45:58] thinking no God never responds God never
[46:00] reacts to anything God is the initiator
[46:03] and the devil's there the one who's in
[46:05] reaction amen so I thought that's not
[46:07] right God no it's God's provision
[46:09] because we're going to realize that
[46:11] before we ever came to the Earth God
[46:13] made a way he he gave us provision amen
[46:17] he you know you know he already made a
[46:18] way he knew what we would what we would
[46:20] uh face he knew what we would go through
[46:22] and by his grateful knowledge he
[46:24] provided at provision which was greater
[46:27] than what anything the enemy could do
[46:28] you know I'm so thankful you know I'm
[46:30] going to talk about the armor of God
[46:31] eventually but you know I want to say
[46:33] the devil's equipment Ain't Enough
[46:35] Hallelujah you know right now there's a
[46:37] war in Ukraine they talk about
[46:38] technology
[46:40] and they talk about tanks and you know
[46:42] abilities of different weapons that
[46:43] they're testing out you know I think can
[46:45] this one match this one and this one's
[46:46] better than this one the devil ain't got
[46:48] enough
[46:49] he has nothing that can ever combat what
[46:51] God has already given us
[46:54] amen so you know God by his God by his
[46:57] foreknowledge knew what we would need
[46:59] for this season that we live in amen
[47:01] it's like Brother Band would say about a
[47:03] um you know parents you know when they
[47:04] prepare for a child he'd say see see
[47:07] look how you're Earthly parent before
[47:08] you come here before they know you was
[47:11] coming made ready for your coming just
[47:13] think of that now your Earthly
[47:14] appearance which an Earthly parent is
[47:16] only type of a Heavenly parent if we
[47:18] know how to give good gifts to our
[47:20] children how much more does your
[47:21] heavenly father know how to give good
[47:23] gifts to his children amen Jesus spake
[47:25] these words see they made ready for your
[47:27] coming they made a little crib or got a
[47:30] little some little booties and little
[47:32] clothes and so forth they made ready
[47:33] everything for you to arrive prepared
[47:36] before you even come to the earth now
[47:38] that's just a natural that's just
[47:40] natural parents now how much more our
[47:42] Supernatural parent you know I was
[47:43] thinking about the Aquinas house that we
[47:45] you know enjoyed so much yesterday I
[47:47] believe God inspired someone to build
[47:49] that house for them amen to dwell and
[47:51] you know they didn't know when they're
[47:53] building it that God children were going
[47:54] to be there but I believe God inspired
[47:56] someone to build that house for them
[47:58] just like I believe God inspired someone
[48:00] to build this building for us hallelujah
[48:02] I believe that's how God works because
[48:03] he knew he people think this is going to
[48:05] be an office or a factory but no God
[48:07] actually enters his mind you think that
[48:09] but I know what it's for amen hallelujah
[48:12] so God you're going to see everything
[48:13] you receive amen leaving the car you
[48:15] drive God inspired someone to make that
[48:17] for you Hallelujah because he knew you'd
[48:19] need it amen so God looks after us real
[48:22] well amen hallelujah now if that's just
[48:24] in the natural you know how much more
[48:25] the supernatural Hallelujah you know see
[48:28] see God's God's fulfillment of his word
[48:31] shows his provision
[48:33] it's not some Eerie fairy thing God is
[48:35] Jehovah Jireh and he provides no no it's
[48:37] a it's a manifested reality Hallelujah
[48:40] you know we look at the scripture for
[48:42] example where Isaiah would be you know
[48:44] Isaiah we know he wrote the Bible within
[48:46] the Bible 66 chapters there's 66 books
[48:49] in the Bible you know you know you know
[48:51] he he he he started from in the
[48:53] beginning to
[48:54] Eternity right and then and then Isaiah
[48:57] is prophesying he says in Isaiah 59 and
[48:59] 19 so shall they fear the name of the
[49:02] Lord from the West and his glory from
[49:04] the rising of the sun when the enemy
[49:06] shall come in like a flood the spirit of
[49:07] the Lord shall lift up a standard
[49:09] against him amen so the Isaiah was
[49:12] actually prophesying not of his day but
[49:14] speaking of a future day because he says
[49:16] when the enemy shall come in like a
[49:18] flood then the Lord will lift up a
[49:19] standard against him amen now now we see
[49:22] that that wasn't Isaiah's day the enemy
[49:25] wasn't like a flood sure he was on the
[49:26] earth Devils were working and anointing
[49:28] people in all different kinds of things
[49:30] but there was not a flood of evil of
[49:32] demonic how like we see today I mean but
[49:35] we see the Fulfillment of this now as I
[49:37] said God God is Not reactionary because
[49:39] you think well the Lord see when the
[49:41] enemy comes in like a flood you think
[49:42] well he's then he'll lift up a standard
[49:44] then he's reacting no the reason the
[49:45] enemy comes in like a flood is because
[49:47] God allows it to happen now we won't
[49:49] read it but you read Revelations chapter
[49:51] nine it says a star falls from heaven
[49:53] now if someone you know if something
[49:55] Falls it doesn't it doesn't come down
[49:57] right it doesn't choose on its own
[49:59] choosing to descend it's been pushed
[50:01] well if you get pushed from a building
[50:03] or a tree and you fall you didn't come
[50:05] down you were pushed there's a force
[50:07] greater than yourself pushed you and
[50:09] gravity took you down it means this star
[50:11] which had the key to the bottomless pit
[50:13] foul it says in Revelations nine and one
[50:15] why is that because because that was
[50:17] actually the enemy falling amen what
[50:20] what happened is is God pushed him out
[50:22] of Heaven he was pushed they actually
[50:24] say he even fled to the Earth because he
[50:26] was defeated in heaven amen but now but
[50:28] then what happens is he comes down he
[50:30] has the key to the bottomless pit and
[50:32] then hell is open up upon the Earth
[50:34] Hallelujah now now and then now we don't
[50:37] have time for it now maybe we'll make it
[50:39] more of a study in the future but if you
[50:40] look at those demon powers that are
[50:42] released it's not a natural Army because
[50:44] they're told not to hurt the trees or
[50:46] the grass but only those men who don't
[50:48] have the Seal of God in their forehead
[50:50] so so it's demon depression on the mind
[50:52] of man and it can only touch those that
[50:55] don't have the Seal of God which is the
[50:57] baptism of the Holy Ghost see we are
[50:59] we're provisioned in the state
[51:01] hallelujah amen so so it's not a natural
[51:04] Army that's going to come and there's
[51:06] two you know these incredible uh yeah
[51:07] people think it's going to be a big army
[51:09] it's going to take the world no well it
[51:10] already has taken the world hey man
[51:12] brother and preached the invasion of the
[51:14] United States says the enemy's not
[51:15] coming he's here amen and that's the
[51:17] same thing the enemy's not coming and
[51:19] he's here amen you know so we must
[51:21] realize that he's here right but the
[51:23] thing is now if you keep reading down if
[51:25] you come down to verse 12 it says about
[51:27] after the first woe and and we know a
[51:30] woe in the Bible is a World War I mean
[51:32] and there's four Angels loose from the
[51:33] review Fridays with two hundred thousand
[51:35] thousand demons and so they have been
[51:37] loosed for the end time you know that
[51:39] they were bound until this end time but
[51:41] now they've been loosed amen so between
[51:43] the first and second world war amen
[51:45] these four Angels were loosed with their
[51:48] armies upon the Earth and they were sent
[51:50] to kill a third part of men and we know
[51:52] that that third part of men was actually
[51:54] the third part of the Jewish race and in
[51:56] the Holocaust the third part of the
[51:58] Jewish race we were murdered were
[52:00] exterminated why because demon
[52:02] anointings fell upon men to stir up amen
[52:06] the people against the Jews amen let's
[52:09] say yo Hitler the you know if you've
[52:11] ever seen Hitler Hitler's political
[52:13] speak he's not a politician he's a
[52:15] preacher and he always finished his
[52:17] sermon with amen and that's how the
[52:20] Lutheran Church used to finish that
[52:21] those those Orthodox our judges amen you
[52:24] know and you see his preaching his
[52:25] inspired he's anointed and the anointing
[52:27] was upon him went upon the people that's
[52:29] why the you know Nazi Germany all those
[52:31] kind of nations were so caught up in
[52:33] that because it was a it was a fallen
[52:35] Spirit anointing and they fell upon
[52:37] Mussolini and Eichmann in different ones
[52:39] and then they caused that to happen now
[52:41] so so there was a demonic anointing
[52:44] released and it killed the third part of
[52:47] the Jewish race
[52:48] now those demons are still here oh yes
[52:51] they haven't gone they didn't go back to
[52:53] the river Euphrates and about no no
[52:55] they're still loosed upon the Earth no
[52:57] but remember God knew God knew that this
[53:00] would be here
[53:01] right and so he's made provision
[53:03] that's why I gotta we're gonna have such
[53:05] confidence in our God I mean we should
[53:07] have absolute confidence in the Lord
[53:09] Jesus Christ this morning Hallelujah
[53:11] because remember he didn't just give us
[53:13] provision he predestinated us to wear
[53:15] that provision I mean because he's
[53:16] previously he always predestinates the
[53:18] people to overcome in the age that they
[53:21] live amen because remember the Bible
[53:23] would say in Revelation is two and three
[53:24] speak of the church ages always says to
[53:26] he that overcometh I'll give this or
[53:28] I'll Grant this you know so God knew
[53:30] that there'd be a people in that age
[53:32] that would overcome amen by the blood of
[53:34] lamb and the word of their testimony in
[53:36] that age amen I believe I'm looking at
[53:37] those people this morning Hallelujah
[53:39] part of them
[53:40] I mean so I can so so I'm sure we can
[53:43] agree just from those little statements
[53:45] here about Revelations 9 and and even if
[53:48] you go look at the history of the last
[53:49] 120 years of the world things have
[53:51] changed massive change we used to study
[53:54] in social studies and uh what is it
[53:57] these days called year 10 year 11. the
[53:59] rapid change in even the 50s and 60s of
[54:02] society you know in New Zealand massive
[54:04] change even even um you know I wish I
[54:07] saved the news article but there was an
[54:09] anniversary of when the Beatles first
[54:10] went to Australia and that tour changed
[54:14] the country because they used to be
[54:15] quite isolated but what happened four
[54:17] men with a demonic anointing came in
[54:20] through their music or released that
[54:21] Spirit upon the country and it changed
[54:23] it forever and even this is historian
[54:25] saying that tour changed their Nation
[54:27] well I was having a demonic anointing
[54:30] was released
[54:32] you know and and because of this we can
[54:34] see this is why there's so much Insanity
[54:36] that we have today there's all this
[54:38] demonic anointing you know it's amazing
[54:40] people are shocked by men wearing skirts
[54:43] and dresses today people are shocked by
[54:45] that they show you shot you should be
[54:47] shocked right that men men are
[54:50] cross-dressing today but in reality
[54:52] we've had cross-dressing for over 100
[54:54] years
[54:55] it's actually nothing new amen women
[54:58] have been wearing men's garments for
[55:00] over 100 years now you know we're
[55:02] shocked by men dressing like women but
[55:05] we've become used to woman dressing like
[55:07] men
[55:08] and and and we've come accustomed to it
[55:10] we think it's normal it's it's not
[55:11] normal amen it's actually because of a
[55:14] demonic anointing upon people
[55:16] you know so because because why what's
[55:20] happened is because there's these fallen
[55:21] angels have come upon there the enemy is
[55:23] coming like a flood and and people have
[55:25] got used to women dressing like men
[55:28] women shouldn't dress like men shouldn't
[55:30] dress like women we should know what
[55:32] bathroom to use right we should know on
[55:34] whose side we're on right amen I
[55:36] remember when annalize was about seven
[55:38] years old I was trying to explain to her
[55:39] about chromosomes it's physically
[55:43] impossible for a man to change his
[55:45] chromosomes to be have a woman's
[55:47] chromosome and but it's 100 impossible
[55:52] you know you can't change who you are
[55:54] Spirit may come on and you can think of
[55:55] something but
[55:56] biologically who God made you you're
[55:58] different
[55:59] amen so we've had we've had sadly we've
[56:02] had women dressing as men for over a
[56:04] hundred years and and and has become
[56:06] acceptable now people can do what they
[56:08] want everyone has free moral choice but
[56:10] I want to stand for the Bible if we
[56:12] consider ourselves Christians we'll
[56:13] we'll do as Christians do amen because
[56:15] we live a certain way because we want to
[56:17] please the Lord right amen so because
[56:19] people say well what about women's pants
[56:21] and so on well you know people say well
[56:23] it's made for a woman no it's not
[56:24] because if you look at the origin of the
[56:26] Garment it was a man's garment you know
[56:28] because there's you know even as Moses
[56:30] would say
[56:31] you know the woman should not wear that
[56:34] which pertaineth unto a man neither
[56:36] shall a man put on a woman's garment for
[56:38] all that do those do so are Abomination
[56:41] unto the Lord their God now we're going
[56:42] to realize what God doesn't like he
[56:45] still doesn't like he hasn't changed
[56:47] right he doesn't change his opinion
[56:49] because because now the Holy Ghost is
[56:51] here the blood of lamb is here and he
[56:53] just lets it know he's still what he
[56:55] loves he loves what he hates he hates he
[56:57] hasn't changed in any way and if you
[56:59] look at the law some things are
[57:01] Abomination unto uh unto Israel some
[57:03] things are Abomination unto God right so
[57:05] there's an Abomination under God God
[57:07] still doesn't like it and then all but
[57:09] some people say well they all wear robes
[57:11] they all wore the same garments when
[57:13] when Moses said a woman shall not wear a
[57:15] garment pertains to a man they knew
[57:16] exactly you know to our untrained eye
[57:19] not understanding the culture and how
[57:20] they're dressed you know we think well
[57:22] they all look the same but no there were
[57:24] men's garments and their woman's
[57:25] garments they knew exactly right and
[57:28] that's why the Lord wrote it this way is
[57:30] because this transcends culture and time
[57:32] because you go to any country under
[57:34] heaven and these man's traditional
[57:36] garments and women's traditional
[57:37] governments right so we don't want to
[57:40] let that Insanity come on us and think
[57:42] that is fine
[57:43] hey man amen Israelites they they had a
[57:47] different dress both sections and we
[57:48] have the same so he can't say well
[57:50] that's a woman's garment but but it's
[57:52] actually the origin of the man's
[57:53] government
[57:54] amen but now
[57:57] when the enemy comes in like a flood he
[57:59] says the Lord will lift up a standard
[58:01] against him but now notice the next
[58:02] verse verse 20. he says it says and the
[58:05] Redeemer shall come to Zion and unto
[58:08] them that turn from transgression and
[58:09] Jacob saith the Lord so there's actually
[58:12] two groups the Lord is coming to when
[58:14] all this happens Amen to the so the
[58:16] Redeemer shall come to Zion and unto
[58:19] them it turned from transgression and
[58:21] Jacob so because many times you would
[58:22] read this and think well Zion is is a
[58:24] part of Israel and Jacobs Israel City
[58:26] the same group no they're two different
[58:27] groups amen because what we have is Zion
[58:31] actually speaks of the bride of Christ
[58:32] it's not just a physical location in
[58:34] Israel but Zion speaks of the Bride hey
[58:37] man because you know the Lord was saying
[58:39] Isaiah 49 I'm just going to take one of
[58:42] this but Zion said the Lord has forsaken
[58:44] me and the Lord had forgotten me he says
[58:46] can a woman forget her suckling child
[58:47] but she um should not have compassion on
[58:51] the son of her womb yeah they may forget
[58:52] yet will I not forget thee behold I've a
[58:56] grave and then the palm of my hands thy
[58:58] walls that continually before me thy
[59:00] children shall make haste thy destroyers
[59:02] and they that make hay shall go forth
[59:04] out of Thee
[59:06] left up by an eyes about and behold all
[59:09] these that gather themselves together
[59:10] and come to thee as I live saith the
[59:12] Lord thou shall surely clothe thee with
[59:15] them all as with an ointment and bind
[59:17] thee on bind them only as a bright Duff
[59:21] y speaking not just of a city but a
[59:24] people speaks about the daughters of
[59:25] Zion in the Bible right
[59:28] so now when the enemy comes in like a
[59:31] flood I'll raise up a standard so so and
[59:34] then the Redeemer shall come to Zion now
[59:35] now when's he going to come to Zion then
[59:37] if the enemy's already coming like a
[59:38] flood well if you look at Revelations 9
[59:40] after read Revelation is nine the first
[59:42] word of Revelations chapter 10 is and I
[59:44] Surrender the mighty Angel come down so
[59:46] in Revelations 9 there was a star Fallen
[59:49] he was pushed a greater force forced him
[59:51] to come down right because he was pushed
[59:53] he fell and the enemy is falling but in
[59:55] Revelations 10 and 1 says Anna sir
[59:57] another Mighty Angel come down he came
[59:59] down on his own choosing who is this
[1:00:01] Mighty Angel Christ himself an Angelic
[1:00:04] form amen he has come down this is when
[1:00:06] the Redeemer comes to Zion remember
[1:00:08] we're going to meet him in the air
[1:00:09] physically right but before we meet him
[1:00:11] in the air physically we're going to
[1:00:12] become one with his word here upon the
[1:00:14] Earth amen and that's what Revelations
[1:00:16] 10 speaks of is the people becoming one
[1:00:18] with Christ amen all that he is
[1:00:20] hallelujah amen so this Mighty Angel has
[1:00:23] come down has come to give us provision
[1:00:25] price gone I trust you're happy with me
[1:00:28] this morning I live because we're not
[1:00:29] alone in this battle we're not here
[1:00:31] humanly trying to overcome amen but the
[1:00:33] devil was course to fall and the
[1:00:35] bottomless pit opened sure but Christ
[1:00:37] did that and then Christ came down to
[1:00:39] show the devil all of his forces all
[1:00:41] that he is cannot stop his bride in the
[1:00:43] same time and he cannot stop those that
[1:00:46] turn from transgression and Jacob
[1:00:47] because after the Redeemer comes to Zion
[1:00:49] and we go on a Rapture what does he do
[1:00:51] he goes to the Jews that same Lord Jesus
[1:00:53] Christ praise the Lord so you see the
[1:00:55] Fulfillment of that scripture to me
[1:00:56] that's quite neat Hallelujah
[1:00:59] amen praise God so now the Lord is here
[1:01:02] to meet the challenge of the day he knew
[1:01:04] what we would have need of amen he has
[1:01:07] provided us amen with many great things
[1:01:10] now as I said before it is the it is
[1:01:14] the Lord gives the promise to the
[1:01:16] Overcomer to he that Overcomer cometh
[1:01:18] right now to me that speaks of an
[1:01:21] individual walk you in the Lord Jesus
[1:01:22] Christ now
[1:01:24] and then and then even in this age where
[1:01:26] it says if any man hear my voice and
[1:01:28] open the door I will come unto him and
[1:01:30] sup with him and he with me so anyone
[1:01:32] that hears his voice anyone that hears
[1:01:34] this message amen open the door of your
[1:01:36] heart don't leave anything close let him
[1:01:38] come in and re renovate transform your
[1:01:41] life amen hallelujah
[1:01:43] amen now some people think well it's an
[1:01:45] individual walk well I don't need a
[1:01:47] local church I say yes you physically do
[1:01:49] I mean not just something that you pay
[1:01:51] your ties to the stream once in a while
[1:01:52] but you need to physically be part of a
[1:01:54] local body amen we need to be physically
[1:01:56] part of a local church because it says
[1:01:58] in um you know Hebrews 10 and 25 not
[1:02:00] forsaking the assembling of ourselves
[1:02:02] together as the as the manner of some is
[1:02:05] well I don't want to be part of the I
[1:02:07] don't want to fulfill that part of it I
[1:02:09] want to be the assembling of ourselves
[1:02:10] together right amen but exhorting one
[1:02:13] another and so much more as you see that
[1:02:15] day approaching see we need one another
[1:02:18] I know this is probably nothing new so
[1:02:20] you know but you know don't just switch
[1:02:21] off here we are you know we need one
[1:02:23] another I mean every joint of the body
[1:02:26] fitly supplies the need amen there's a
[1:02:28] fiction there's an effectual working in
[1:02:30] the measure of every part making the
[1:02:31] increase of the body into the edifying
[1:02:33] of itself and love so every part of us
[1:02:35] we need every part of us you know if you
[1:02:37] woke up one morning and you didn't have
[1:02:39] one of your ligaments you'll feel it
[1:02:41] right if you wake up one morning and
[1:02:43] you're missing of muscle somewhere
[1:02:44] you're going to feel that you're going
[1:02:46] to be and the whole body at the
[1:02:47] compensate and won't be able to work as
[1:02:49] it could if that was there so we all
[1:02:52] need one another amen we're all part of
[1:02:53] the same body of Christ hallelujah amen
[1:02:56] it's a God now God has made a provision
[1:02:58] amen amen for this end time he's made a
[1:03:01] provision for our Earthly Journey before
[1:03:03] we ever arrived here now he didn't just
[1:03:06] put here put us here by chance
[1:03:08] right we are not here by chance we're
[1:03:11] not here by an accident you know some
[1:03:12] some parents may think their children
[1:03:14] are accidents but God With God there's
[1:03:16] no accidents right God knew you would be
[1:03:18] here you know I heard a testimony from
[1:03:20] from Canada that there was a there was a
[1:03:23] family and they and and and and and and
[1:03:26] they had their kids they thought so both
[1:03:28] the mum and dad had their tubes cut and
[1:03:30] everything but then they had another
[1:03:31] child
[1:03:33] and then they cut the tubes again they
[1:03:34] had the operation all over again then
[1:03:36] they had another child and that last
[1:03:39] child is the believer
[1:03:41] Hallelujah it goes the show we're not
[1:03:43] here by chance you know if God wants you
[1:03:46] here you're going to be here hallelujah
[1:03:48] so so we should wake up at the morning
[1:03:50] say God you wanted to be here today oh
[1:03:52] look I'm here for a purpose Amy I'm not
[1:03:54] here just to occupy time amen as the
[1:03:57] Lord would say if he has brought us here
[1:03:58] in this chaos that we're in now and
[1:04:01] prepared the good things of life for us
[1:04:03] here how much more how can we trust them
[1:04:05] to prepare the things that is to come
[1:04:07] amen but he says if he's brought us here
[1:04:09] in this chaos this world's a chaos amen
[1:04:12] but we can be the peace and the chaos
[1:04:14] amen we can be in the storm but the
[1:04:16] storm doesn't have to be in US sure the
[1:04:18] winds and waves will rage but it doesn't
[1:04:20] have the rage in you and I I mean why
[1:04:22] because God has provided where we have
[1:04:24] needle for Every Storm
[1:04:26] Hallelujah see God did not just make
[1:04:28] everything just to see if he could make
[1:04:30] it right he did not make the tree out
[1:04:33] there he did not make the you know the
[1:04:35] Earth that we stand on the food we eat
[1:04:36] this country he did not make New Zealand
[1:04:39] just for the sake of it he made it for a
[1:04:40] purpose I mean he made all the nations
[1:04:42] we're born out of for a purpose amen he
[1:04:44] made the road everything everything
[1:04:46] everything that we have is for a purpose
[1:04:48] now God did not make you and I just to
[1:04:51] see if he could make you and I he made
[1:04:53] us for a purpose and therefore there is
[1:04:56] a purpose of all of us being here we're
[1:04:58] not here just to be another human being
[1:05:00] you're here because God made you for
[1:05:02] some purpose you're not here just eat
[1:05:04] the food that God growed you're not here
[1:05:05] just to live in the house that God that
[1:05:07] man made although where the clothing
[1:05:09] that someone fashioned you'll hear for a
[1:05:11] specific purpose no matter how little
[1:05:13] you are how big you are how important
[1:05:15] you are or how unimportant you are
[1:05:17] you're here to serve a purpose just as
[1:05:19] my finger is here for a purpose my nail
[1:05:21] and my fingers for a purpose my eye and
[1:05:24] every part of our bodies is to serve a
[1:05:25] purpose and it was not just putty to see
[1:05:28] what it would look like when it was put
[1:05:30] here but it was put in a servant's
[1:05:31] purpose as God's divine plan to do so
[1:05:34] and if we were put it for a purpose
[1:05:37] there's nothing can destroy us until
[1:05:39] God's purpose is fulfilled nothing can
[1:05:42] harm us until that purpose that God has
[1:05:43] put us here for has been made manifest
[1:05:46] no matter how much trouble we have how
[1:05:48] much heartaches or Sorrows we go through
[1:05:50] all of those are for reasons and there's
[1:05:52] a reason for it amen because why God
[1:05:55] wants to prove his provision he wants to
[1:05:57] prove his provision he does not just
[1:05:59] look at the theoretical specs of
[1:06:01] something he puts it into practice amen
[1:06:04] just like there's many weapons just like
[1:06:06] it was in the Spanish Civil War between
[1:06:07] World War II I mean many of the powers
[1:06:10] would send their weapons to that country
[1:06:11] to test them out before they are used in
[1:06:14] World War II it's the same thing before
[1:06:15] world war three right now in the Ukraine
[1:06:17] amen God you know you know the different
[1:06:19] Al you know different powers of sending
[1:06:21] their equipment because they want to see
[1:06:23] how it goes it's all very well in the
[1:06:25] training field it's all very well in the
[1:06:27] hangar it's all very well doing some
[1:06:28] test flights but when you put it into
[1:06:30] you know hostile territory you want to
[1:06:33] see how it goes against your opponents
[1:06:34] amen that's why it's you know you know
[1:06:36] the UK right now is the big weapons
[1:06:37] Testing Lab
[1:06:39] that's what it's been used for sadly
[1:06:42] this is what America is using it for
[1:06:43] Russia is using it for different powers
[1:06:45] they want to test their drones and their
[1:06:46] tanks and their missiles Amen to you see
[1:06:49] and it's the same thing with God God
[1:06:50] doesn't just have things on the on the
[1:06:52] runway God doesn't have it just in a
[1:06:54] cabinet to say this is what it can do
[1:06:56] God wants to show his provision amen and
[1:06:59] he wants to show amen the ability of
[1:07:01] those that are carrying that provision
[1:07:03] well this will say you're here for a
[1:07:06] purpose amen we're not here just occupy
[1:07:08] time or just go through the motions no
[1:07:10] God wants to prove us he wants a prove
[1:07:14] he's Jehovah Jireh amen he wants to
[1:07:16] prove that he will provide everything
[1:07:17] you have need of rather be healing amen
[1:07:20] amen Deliverance Peace of Mind
[1:07:22] financially Whatever It Is God wants to
[1:07:24] show he's still Jehovah Jireh amen and
[1:07:27] he will he will create something even
[1:07:28] out of nothing amen that Ram wasn't
[1:07:31] there when Abraham looked because he
[1:07:32] heard it behind him so now if
[1:07:34] something's behind you it means you've
[1:07:36] walked past it right so he walked past
[1:07:39] the thicket God showed him where to go
[1:07:41] he's walking past the thicket it's not
[1:07:44] there right but when he had need of it
[1:07:46] his faith declared it's going to be
[1:07:49] there amen God created it where it
[1:07:51] wasn't even there and there's the same
[1:07:52] thing with God can do for you and I you
[1:07:54] say well amen you say well my family
[1:07:57] Hallelujah my family has no desire God
[1:08:00] can create a desire amen what about my
[1:08:02] loved ones there's no there's no desire
[1:08:03] in them God can create that desire
[1:08:05] Hallelujah he can create whatever he is
[1:08:07] the creator amen he creates something
[1:08:10] out of nothing what is he you so face to
[1:08:13] do it amen so he used Abraham's Faith
[1:08:16] remember God who told him go on the
[1:08:17] mountain I'll show you where to go he
[1:08:20] saw it by Vision he was a prophet so he
[1:08:22] knew exactly the you know the the Red
[1:08:24] Jewel whatever it's going to be on he
[1:08:25] didn't just say well this is good enough
[1:08:26] no he went to the exact spot and
[1:08:29] apparently it's the exact spot where the
[1:08:30] temple is built he went on that mountain
[1:08:32] hallelujah amen so so he saw it by
[1:08:36] Vision he went up there and then even
[1:08:38] he's you know he told the he told you
[1:08:40] know his servants the lad and I are
[1:08:42] going to come back again
[1:08:43] amen so God knew yo Abraham had
[1:08:46] Resurrection faith Hallelujah hello
[1:08:48] people with Resurrection Faith amen same
[1:08:51] faith of Abrahams and you and I
[1:08:53] Hallelujah so he had a faith and then so
[1:08:55] God created the ram in a place where he
[1:08:57] walked past
[1:08:59] praise God God can create something out
[1:09:01] of nothing
[1:09:02] I'm you know I get excited I say Lord
[1:09:04] You're unlimited you can just do
[1:09:06] anything right now you can do anything
[1:09:08] Hallelujah you don't look at the
[1:09:11] circumstances and whatever we look at
[1:09:13] you just look at your word
[1:09:15] Hallelujah and that's what we need to do
[1:09:17] just look at God's word amen the greater
[1:09:20] the trouble you are thinking about from
[1:09:21] the um convention Auckland company I
[1:09:23] think it's Brother David Tyler was
[1:09:24] preaching us like when the lowest when
[1:09:26] you get to your lowest point that's when
[1:09:28] God comes on the scene so in your lowest
[1:09:30] point you should be rolling out red
[1:09:31] carpet Holly what are you doing in this
[1:09:34] trial why are you picking up carrying
[1:09:36] carpet around I'm gonna roll it down I'm
[1:09:38] I'm getting ready for my visitation what
[1:09:40] do you mean you're stressed you're
[1:09:41] troubled the world's falling apart your
[1:09:43] life is falling apart why are you why
[1:09:45] are you sweeping up why are you why are
[1:09:47] you getting the what you're a front door
[1:09:48] already why are you putting this carpet
[1:09:50] out I'm having a visitation amen I'm in
[1:09:52] the right condition for a visitation of
[1:09:54] the Lord hallelujah and that's how we
[1:09:56] should be and then it's like Abraham
[1:09:59] he's on the planes of memory it's dry
[1:10:01] it's a desert it's a bad place Sarah's
[1:10:03] fussing there's trouble going on and
[1:10:05] things but he begins to roll out a red
[1:10:07] carpet Hallelujah because why the one
[1:10:09] he's expecting to come is Gonna Come on
[1:10:11] the scene amen so Hallelujah you know
[1:10:15] praise God
[1:10:16] hey who's going to start rolling out red
[1:10:18] carpet right now Hallelujah that's what
[1:10:20] we should do hallelujah what if it's
[1:10:23] always darkest before Dawn
[1:10:25] amen
[1:10:26] praise God
[1:10:28] Hallelujah that makes me happy
[1:10:31] amen now
[1:10:32] now provision I just you know I always
[1:10:34] ask Mr Google what you know words mean
[1:10:37] and provision has a few meanings but one
[1:10:40] of us the action of providing or
[1:10:42] supplying something for use now I'm
[1:10:44] going to talk about how so that so the
[1:10:46] baptism of the Holy Ghost is the full
[1:10:47] armor of God Amen but you've got to look
[1:10:49] at the action of how God provided this
[1:10:51] to us amen he didn't just he didn't just
[1:10:53] send it down on it on on on angel's
[1:10:55] wings he didn't say here you go you know
[1:10:58] put it in the mail to you no he knew
[1:11:01] that he had to change the wearer of the
[1:11:03] alma
[1:11:04] to match the armor just like Elisha had
[1:11:07] to be changed to match Elijah's Mantle
[1:11:09] right God God took him God see see and
[1:11:13] and the whole way that Elisha was was
[1:11:15] actually molded because what happened
[1:11:16] remember Elijah called Elisha by
[1:11:20] throwing his mantle upon him and that
[1:11:22] was actually God actually anointing
[1:11:24] Elisha right but then when he threw the
[1:11:26] mantle on him he realized it doesn't fit
[1:11:29] him just yet but he's ordained to fit
[1:11:30] the mantle right on the inside he's a
[1:11:33] prophet God already said Elijah's my
[1:11:35] Prophet after you amen so now how did he
[1:11:37] mold and shape him he just followed
[1:11:39] Elijah
[1:11:40] he is following Elijah he began to see
[1:11:42] what Elijah did you know no doubt he'd
[1:11:43] hear Elijah praying the prince of God
[1:11:45] would just come down what would begin to
[1:11:47] happen because his heart was soft it was
[1:11:49] cutting and shaping him to fit the
[1:11:51] mantle that's why we've got to be very
[1:11:53] soft-hearted we can't ever justify a
[1:11:56] position against someone amen because
[1:11:59] many times what stops the Lord is
[1:12:01] actually hardened hearts it's not
[1:12:03] circumstances it's hard and hot
[1:12:07] so he began to walk with Elijah
[1:12:09] and then they came to a place in the
[1:12:11] walk where now he's ready
[1:12:13] and then they Cross Jordan
[1:12:15] and then Elijah's taken up right then
[1:12:18] the mantle falls upon him and it fits
[1:12:19] him just right so he follows the word
[1:12:22] Elisha follows the word until he's cut
[1:12:25] and shaped for the word to fit him see
[1:12:28] we don't want to ever cut the word to
[1:12:31] fit our lives that's what denomination
[1:12:33] has done they've taken the word of God
[1:12:34] and they're taking a twink pin and
[1:12:37] crossed things out
[1:12:38] this this doesn't match me I don't want
[1:12:41] to be baptized in the name of Jesus
[1:12:42] Christ I shouldn't have to dress this
[1:12:44] way I'm going to twink that out and you
[1:12:46] know God being the Jesus being the
[1:12:48] almighty no he's just my Aaron boy I'll
[1:12:50] cut that out seeing they get a twink pin
[1:12:53] why because they want to cut the word to
[1:12:54] match them we don't want to ever cut the
[1:12:57] word to match us we want God cut me
[1:12:59] shape me that I match your word amen
[1:13:02] that my experience matches God's Bible
[1:13:04] like the prophet says I don't want God's
[1:13:07] Bible to match my experience I want my
[1:13:08] experience to match God's Bible I mean
[1:13:10] because if you have a Bible experience
[1:13:12] you've got a Bible God to back up a
[1:13:14] Bible life now in you amen so this is
[1:13:16] what we've got to have a hallelujah amen
[1:13:19] I'm so thankful that you know God has
[1:13:20] given us that kind of a heart amen
[1:13:22] hallelujah just like you know here we
[1:13:25] were wandering around in this world and
[1:13:26] God God has already ordained yeah I've
[1:13:29] got a people to fulfill the Great
[1:13:31] Commission
[1:13:32] just like Elijah's commission wasn't
[1:13:34] finished in his ministry though God told
[1:13:36] him to do different things Elisha was
[1:13:38] part of the Fulfillment of what God told
[1:13:40] Elijah to do and this end time ministry
[1:13:42] God is what
[1:13:44] left it with us to fulfill
[1:13:46] praise the Lord amen we're not just
[1:13:48] standing here saying well in 1965
[1:13:49] brother Bram did this no shall we talk
[1:13:52] about those things we appreciate the
[1:13:53] life of the Prophet right but that same
[1:13:55] God comes and lives in us that what he
[1:13:58] preached now becomes manifest manifested
[1:14:01] praise the Lord Hallelujah but now
[1:14:03] you've got to look at the action of
[1:14:05] providing so so God's Great action of of
[1:14:07] of providing the full armor of God for
[1:14:10] us amen he had to he had to come down
[1:14:12] because he knew that we weren't fit to
[1:14:14] wear it yet with our natural birth our
[1:14:16] fallen nature we're born with though we
[1:14:18] may have a sincere desire we want to be
[1:14:20] right we want to be Christians whatever
[1:14:21] more but we have to be born again our
[1:14:24] Natures have to change see that then now
[1:14:27] the armor can come on hallelujah amen so
[1:14:30] it's all part of it that's why it's got
[1:14:32] to be a death to self and what I love
[1:14:34] about a real death to self you know
[1:14:35] Christy and I were talking about it as
[1:14:37] Jesus in The Garden of Gethsemane showed
[1:14:39] a real death to self
[1:14:40] when he said not my will but thy will be
[1:14:42] done there in Gethsemane he didn't say
[1:14:45] not my world but your will be done but
[1:14:48] I'll see how it goes and I'll pull out
[1:14:49] later if it gets to bed
[1:14:51] no when he surrendered his will
[1:14:53] he did not try and take it back up again
[1:14:56] because he made a clear-cut decision
[1:14:57] Lord whatever happens to me from this
[1:15:00] point on it is your will and I'm
[1:15:02] surrendered to it amen he knew what he
[1:15:05] had to face Remember by Vision he had
[1:15:06] seen Calvary he knew he'd be rejected
[1:15:08] all those things and and mad and all
[1:15:10] those things he knew it but he didn't go
[1:15:12] into Pilot's judgment Hall
[1:15:15] to say well if it gets too painful then
[1:15:17] I'm going to quit
[1:15:18] amen and we're to be like Jesus Remember
[1:15:21] so so we should have such a surrender in
[1:15:23] our lives that doesn't matter how
[1:15:26] painful it gets how much trouble we may
[1:15:28] face we may be perplexed and troubled
[1:15:30] whatever all may go on we don't quit we
[1:15:33] don't a full a full surrender to God
[1:15:35] actually gets rid of any plan B's
[1:15:38] we only have one plan that's actually
[1:15:40] plan C Christ right Hallelujah that is
[1:15:43] plan a is plan C amen
[1:15:47] praise the Lord that's what we're gonna
[1:15:48] have
[1:15:49] hey man I like playing C we should
[1:15:51] always let's do plan C
[1:15:53] yeah
[1:15:56] amen this is what we need to have amen
[1:15:58] so down so the action of him providing
[1:16:00] it was that he had to come down as a man
[1:16:02] take our sins upon himself redeem us
[1:16:04] back to himself amen so it was a great
[1:16:07] it was a great action that down Calvary
[1:16:09] hallelujah what that he could equip his
[1:16:12] army with the best
[1:16:14] amen and everything he equips us with is
[1:16:17] necessary it's not unnecessary and it's
[1:16:20] only in the battle you see how necessary
[1:16:22] it really is I mean it's like a it's
[1:16:25] like a raw recruit in the Army you know
[1:16:26] years ago they'd never really had
[1:16:28] helmets for the Army and then and then
[1:16:30] and then when they were first given to
[1:16:31] them the little rookie sword I don't
[1:16:32] want to wear this thing it's just a
[1:16:34] heavy thing on my head they thought it
[1:16:35] was unnecessary but when they got into
[1:16:37] battle they saw how much they needed it
[1:16:39] and God don't provide anything less he
[1:16:42] has need of unless we have need of it
[1:16:43] everything that he provides for you
[1:16:45] you'd better take it because you're
[1:16:47] going to have to need it amen in the
[1:16:49] Army are people carry around 90 pound
[1:16:51] packs on their back they've got shovels
[1:16:53] and grenades and all different kinds of
[1:16:54] things and they think well I gotta lug
[1:16:55] this stuff around I mean but it's in the
[1:16:58] battle when the when the machine guns
[1:16:59] trained on them not just trained above
[1:17:01] them to crawl under and they begin to
[1:17:03] dig and use everything in their packs
[1:17:04] they begin to realize how valuable the
[1:17:06] equipment is amen and it's and it's the
[1:17:08] same thing with you and I Hallelujah
[1:17:11] sometimes we may think what's the point
[1:17:12] of coming to church what's the point of
[1:17:13] reading our Bible praying listening to
[1:17:15] the message you may need that scripture
[1:17:17] one day you may need that quote one day
[1:17:19] I mean when the enemies come in you're
[1:17:20] trouble in your mind I mean God can
[1:17:22] bring that to your remembrance and
[1:17:23] combat that enemy Hallelujah all that
[1:17:25] song you know you know sometimes what's
[1:17:27] the point there's great Point many times
[1:17:30] we come through special meetings we
[1:17:32] think yo that was just a wonderful time
[1:17:33] though God's preparing us there for our
[1:17:36] future
[1:17:37] hallelujah we're going to be very
[1:17:38] attentive when God speaks to us because
[1:17:40] many times God will speak the name he
[1:17:42] comes in and cause tries to cause
[1:17:44] trouble but if we realize that we just
[1:17:45] heard what we heard on Sunday amen it'll
[1:17:48] combat what the devil does on Tuesday
[1:17:50] praise the Lord amen amen why because
[1:17:53] everything's necessary amen so now he
[1:17:55] equipped us with his Best Equipment I
[1:17:58] mean the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:18:00] Hallelujah we don't have we don't have
[1:18:02] second class equipment we don't have
[1:18:04] relics of formal Wars drawed up amen
[1:18:07] Lutheran or Methodist Doctrine or even
[1:18:08] Pentecostal Doctrine no we have the
[1:18:10] baptism of the Holy Ghost the full word
[1:18:12] of God Amen we have the best equipment
[1:18:15] we've got the best generation fighter
[1:18:17] Hallelujah we have a Seventh Generation
[1:18:20] fighter not a fifth generation South
[1:18:22] fighter we're the Seventh Generation
[1:18:23] we're at the best tanks we've got the
[1:18:25] best guns we have the best ballistic
[1:18:27] missiles we got the best nuclear weapons
[1:18:29] thermonuclear whatever it is it goes
[1:18:32] boom
[1:18:33] and the devil's armor is Never Enough
[1:18:35] his equipment is second rate it's
[1:18:37] rusting it's gone all he's a creature of
[1:18:40] habit now if you think you think about a
[1:18:42] natural Nation if they're just a
[1:18:43] creature of habit just say just say for
[1:18:45] example we take America
[1:18:46] when they when they fought their first
[1:18:48] war they had muskets and cannons gun
[1:18:50] powered black powder rifles now now
[1:18:53] imagine if they're like the devil well
[1:18:55] they do they they'd use those same
[1:18:56] weapons in every war creature of habit
[1:18:58] uses the same old tactics standing
[1:19:01] online right in front of enemy and go
[1:19:03] fire yeah have you ever seen how that
[1:19:04] that's crazy stuff you know the British
[1:19:06] apparently stood like 30 Paces from it
[1:19:08] that's when they shot first like right
[1:19:09] there to there like meet a brother and
[1:19:11] Paul away you know and then they've
[1:19:13] already had received a barrage of
[1:19:14] muskets and cannons but they March in an
[1:19:16] order you know two two white belts on a
[1:19:19] red coat that's a good that's a good
[1:19:20] Target you know but they don't do that
[1:19:22] these days
[1:19:23] they've kind of wised up a bit this is
[1:19:26] not a good idea you know so what they
[1:19:28] wear camouflage and they've got the best
[1:19:30] weapons that they can get but the
[1:19:32] devil's a creature of habit see how he
[1:19:34] worked in Eden against evil how he
[1:19:36] worked against the angels is how he
[1:19:38] works against mankind today you take our
[1:19:41] Absalon gathered you know you know cause
[1:19:44] that Revolt in Israel that's how the
[1:19:45] devil worked against the angels in
[1:19:47] heaven and that's exactly how even how
[1:19:49] the devil you know the serpent worked
[1:19:51] against Eve maybe we'll go through that
[1:19:52] one day but you but because he he's a
[1:19:54] creature of habit he gets his black
[1:19:56] powder musket he matches up
[1:20:00] you know and sometimes we just kind of
[1:20:02] watch him like this
[1:20:05] and we and we get shot
[1:20:08] I mean that hurt me
[1:20:09] but he's a creature from heaven
[1:20:12] we've got way better weapons than that
[1:20:14] amen we just push a button well how do
[1:20:17] you say how do you push a button do you
[1:20:18] pray and God comes down and when you say
[1:20:21] Amen there's a missile comes out of a
[1:20:23] truth and it may go way up and there
[1:20:26] goes lands pinpoint accuracy
[1:20:29] and the devil's blasted this by the
[1:20:31] Rings
[1:20:32] but you got to push the button we have
[1:20:35] to use the equipment God's given us and
[1:20:37] we'll get to that soon
[1:20:39] hallelujah amen he says now I believe
[1:20:41] the whole armor of God is the baptism of
[1:20:43] the Holy Ghost with the word behind it
[1:20:45] and if anybody says they got the Holy
[1:20:47] Ghost deny one word then it's not the
[1:20:49] Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost wrote this
[1:20:51] Bible and he said whosoever shall take
[1:20:53] anything out of it or put anything in it
[1:20:54] the same way we've taken as part out of
[1:20:56] The Book of Life the Holy Ghost
[1:20:57] recognizes the word only because that's
[1:20:59] his word and he cannot go back on that
[1:21:01] word he has to keep his word amen amen
[1:21:04] so the whole armor of God is the baptism
[1:21:06] of the Holy Ghost with the word behind
[1:21:07] it now there's you know if we read in
[1:21:10] two if we read in Ephesians and now I'm
[1:21:13] just going to skip one well maybe we'll
[1:21:14] come back to it but but the Apostle Paul
[1:21:16] let's turn to Ephesians 6 shall we're
[1:21:18] here if you don't mind a bit of a a bit
[1:21:20] of a
[1:21:21] Sunday school lesson you know it's
[1:21:24] interesting in Ephesians where you know
[1:21:25] you read chapter one that that the
[1:21:28] Apostle Paul tells the Ephesians they
[1:21:30] they have they have been sealed with
[1:21:32] that Holy Spirit of Promise he even
[1:21:34] would say in Ephesians chapter four
[1:21:35] don't grieve the Holy Ghost we're by
[1:21:37] your seal to the day of your Redemption
[1:21:38] so if you have the Holy Ghost you can
[1:21:40] grieve it but you can't be unsealed
[1:21:42] I'm so good I'm so glad God doesn't use
[1:21:44] our Humanity
[1:21:46] um our Humanity against us Amen to kick
[1:21:47] us out of the Kingdom aren't you amen
[1:21:49] you sealed in you sealed in we can't
[1:21:52] grieve him we don't want to grieve him
[1:21:53] right but it doesn't mean we get
[1:21:54] unsealed praise God I'm so happy but
[1:21:57] then it's notice notice here he says he
[1:22:00] says here in uh verse 10 finally my
[1:22:02] brethren be strong in the Lord and the
[1:22:04] power of His might put on the whole
[1:22:06] armor of God
[1:22:07] so it's interesting they have the Holy
[1:22:10] Ghost they're still to the day of their
[1:22:11] Redemption but yet the Apostle Paul is
[1:22:13] telling them put on the whole armor of
[1:22:16] God so to me what this means it means
[1:22:19] actually put it into use
[1:22:22] amen because what okay you can take I
[1:22:25] don't know what kind of weapons we have
[1:22:26] in New Zealand but what good just say if
[1:22:28] we're at War what good are those weapons
[1:22:30] if they sit in a hangar or some storage
[1:22:32] shed somewhere and they're mothballed
[1:22:34] what good that they can work maybe on
[1:22:37] paper you know what they can do but what
[1:22:39] good are they if they're just mothballed
[1:22:41] or maybe even just on a trophy display
[1:22:43] like the whole armor of God okay you
[1:22:46] have to put it on
[1:22:48] that actually when you're in battle it
[1:22:50] will prove its worth
[1:22:52] amen and so what that means to me is
[1:22:55] that to put on the whole armor of God
[1:22:56] God's saying actually don't be in this
[1:22:58] battle carnally but let the holy ghost
[1:23:01] in your life be your armor let him take
[1:23:04] over every battle right let him be your
[1:23:07] defense let him be your be your armor
[1:23:11] praise the Lord because remember God's
[1:23:12] God's given us real good provision in
[1:23:14] this hour
[1:23:15] amen so so he says because what that ye
[1:23:18] may be able to stand against The Wiles
[1:23:20] of the devil
[1:23:22] yeah amen it says for we wrestle not
[1:23:24] against flesh and blood but against
[1:23:25] principalities against Powers against
[1:23:27] the rulers of the darkness of this world
[1:23:29] against spiritual wickedness in high
[1:23:31] places wherefore so so the apostles
[1:23:34] repeating this wherefore so because of
[1:23:36] what we've just read because of what
[1:23:37] we're fighting take unto you the whole
[1:23:39] armor of God that ye may be able to
[1:23:41] withstand in the evil day and having
[1:23:44] done all to stand so the email to
[1:23:46] withstand in the evil day so Paul's
[1:23:49] actually speaking of a future day it's
[1:23:50] this is the evil day amen where where
[1:23:53] Satan is the God of this evil age I mean
[1:23:56] so we so there has to be a people that
[1:23:58] can stand in this evil day remember God
[1:24:01] predestinates the best equipment
[1:24:04] Hallelujah he produced The Knights of
[1:24:06] people to put on that equipment they
[1:24:08] mean to overcome in the age of the room
[1:24:12] Hallelujah so this this is the evil day
[1:24:14] in my opinion the world has never been
[1:24:16] so evil has since the flood is it's
[1:24:18] never been this evil as as we live in
[1:24:21] right now
[1:24:22] amen but the but God doesn't make does
[1:24:25] not allow the enemy to get anything one
[1:24:28] up above him
[1:24:29] praise the Lord he says having done all
[1:24:31] to stand stand therefore having your
[1:24:34] loins good about with truth now truth is
[1:24:37] not a collection of ideas it's not
[1:24:39] trending opinion it's not a an agreement
[1:24:42] of a group
[1:24:43] right it's not a Collective Agreement of
[1:24:45] a group amen it is not the majority
[1:24:47] opinion right because if he took their
[1:24:50] majority opinion Jesus was a heretic
[1:24:52] Jesus was a blasphemer but what did God
[1:24:55] say it's my son this is the word made
[1:24:58] flesh I mean remember the apostles were
[1:25:00] in the minority the scribes and
[1:25:02] Pharisees were the majority which one's
[1:25:04] right if they had websites and social
[1:25:06] media in those days oh my you know ever
[1:25:10] Pharisee Jones that's amazing people
[1:25:12] used to get all their epiphanies in the
[1:25:14] shower now they get all their epiphanies
[1:25:16] driving along they sit in a car and and
[1:25:18] they had this deep video they've got to
[1:25:20] share with the world what's the road man
[1:25:22] you're driving
[1:25:24] you know but they seem to have all these
[1:25:25] you know yeah now I'm just going to tell
[1:25:27] you this and I've been thinking and
[1:25:28] they're driving and saying I thought man
[1:25:30] that's crazy no wonder there's accidents
[1:25:32] people get all these Deep Thoughts you
[1:25:33] know when they're driving just pull over
[1:25:35] or something you know so imagine
[1:25:37] Pharisee Jones he's in his chariot
[1:25:39] the cheese of Nazareth you know I've got
[1:25:42] this deep Revelation from God you know
[1:25:45] that's what they would do that social
[1:25:48] media would have taught them to shreds
[1:25:49] because the devil would have anointed
[1:25:51] them to make websites and all kinds of
[1:25:53] things
[1:25:55] no well who's right then
[1:25:58] well they'd say well we heard them say
[1:26:01] unless you eat my flesh and drink my
[1:26:03] blood you have no life in you and my
[1:26:05] Bible says this and Moses he said yo yo
[1:26:08] you can't eat the flesh with the blood
[1:26:09] in it that's you know all those things
[1:26:12] well that may be a truth but it's not
[1:26:13] the truth
[1:26:14] because they weren't understanding what
[1:26:15] he was saying right but you see so truth
[1:26:18] is not a truth is not a collection of
[1:26:21] ideas or opinions no Jesus said I am the
[1:26:23] way the truth and the life truth is a
[1:26:25] person amen which is the word made flesh
[1:26:28] that is the truth hallelujah so your
[1:26:30] Lion's gonna be good about with truth
[1:26:32] amen so now so you've got to put this
[1:26:34] armor on you let the Holy Ghost take
[1:26:35] control of your life and and having on
[1:26:38] the breastplate of righteousness now a
[1:26:41] breastplate covers the Torso well know
[1:26:44] what a breastplate is don't we it's a
[1:26:45] piece of armor to here to here covers
[1:26:47] here I mean so so it covers your vital
[1:26:49] organs but it covers and that includes
[1:26:52] your heart now your heart is your seat
[1:26:54] of your emotions right it's not now when
[1:26:57] the Bible talks about a heart it's not
[1:26:59] really talking about a a muscle pumping
[1:27:01] blood through your body however many
[1:27:03] times whatever you know beats per minute
[1:27:05] but it's talking about your seat of your
[1:27:07] emotions your spirit I mean so so this
[1:27:09] breastplate of righteousness has to
[1:27:12] actually cover your emotional realm yeah
[1:27:15] I mean it's got a It's gotta protect
[1:27:17] your emotional realm I mean and what is
[1:27:19] it it is they called a breastplate of
[1:27:21] righteousness because as a Christian
[1:27:23] what is the greatest battle we really
[1:27:25] fight
[1:27:26] are you really a believer
[1:27:28] you know when you're in the when you're
[1:27:29] in the world you didn't care
[1:27:31] you're in the world doesn't matter you
[1:27:33] know you never had that battle am I
[1:27:35] really a am I really a heathen you know
[1:27:37] am I really an unbeliever am I really a
[1:27:40] sinner I never had those thoughts when I
[1:27:42] was in the world you know I don't I
[1:27:44] don't believe any of us that came out of
[1:27:45] the world really had that mind battle
[1:27:47] no of course not why because you're on
[1:27:49] the devil's side you actually have no
[1:27:51] opposing Force against you trying to
[1:27:53] trying to rob your your identity
[1:27:55] actually the devil's saying yes this is
[1:27:56] who you are absolutely you're a drunker
[1:27:58] you're a geek you're a gamer or whatever
[1:28:00] you are yeah that's yeah movies music
[1:28:01] yep that's you you know
[1:28:04] right but then when you meet the Lord
[1:28:07] and the devil's cast out of your life
[1:28:09] then now you've got then now you've got
[1:28:10] an opposing Force the devil's always
[1:28:12] challenging you are you really you you
[1:28:14] think you're the bride of Christ you
[1:28:16] know you really think you're an
[1:28:17] overcomer look what just happened this
[1:28:19] morning coming to church
[1:28:22] how was that conversation was that an
[1:28:24] Overcomers conversation was that really
[1:28:26] you know and then what does he do he's
[1:28:28] trying to he's trying to get into your
[1:28:31] vital organs spiritually now he's trying
[1:28:34] to get but you've got to realize that no
[1:28:37] matter what the enemy Fires at you
[1:28:38] you've got a breastplate of
[1:28:40] righteousness and that righteousness is
[1:28:43] not your own righteous as we know we
[1:28:45] know it's not our own righteousness
[1:28:46] right we know we'll get there by the
[1:28:48] grace of God Amen by his righteousness
[1:28:50] it's all him amen when we're gathered
[1:28:52] around the throne we won't say it was
[1:28:53] all you and me Lord
[1:28:56] some days it was mainly me no yeah yeah
[1:28:59] that was the days where I failed right
[1:29:00] no it was all him amen salvation is of
[1:29:03] the Lord alone praise God Amen Grace we
[1:29:06] know as a Divine influence upon the
[1:29:08] hardest reflection in the life as
[1:29:09] brother our mum was preaching on
[1:29:10] Wednesday amen so it's nothing we have
[1:29:13] done in our Humanity that will that will
[1:29:15] mirror us the body change no he gave us
[1:29:18] remember he became sin for us who knew
[1:29:20] no sin that we would be made the
[1:29:22] righteousness of God in him
[1:29:26] can we put that up second Corinthians 5
[1:29:28] and 21. I love this verse we've got it
[1:29:30] by our front door I say take that devil
[1:29:33] you know he he called us all kind of
[1:29:36] names that's amazing all he can do is
[1:29:37] accuse yeah he comes along like a whiny
[1:29:40] a whiny little kid
[1:29:42] you did this
[1:29:44] that's all he can do
[1:29:45] if you listen to him then he has power
[1:29:47] over you don't listen to him so take
[1:29:51] your opinions back to Hell see look
[1:29:54] to me this is the breastplate of
[1:29:55] righteousness this is what he's done has
[1:29:57] he already done it see some people
[1:29:59] always try and put this off in the
[1:30:01] future one day I'll be righteous one day
[1:30:04] Lord no no don't put it in the future
[1:30:05] see you've gotta you've got to pray and
[1:30:07] thank him because it's in his mind it's
[1:30:10] already done remember when Jesus died on
[1:30:12] Calvary it is finished what's finished
[1:30:14] the sin question what's finished the
[1:30:17] price has been paid amen what is
[1:30:19] finished now righteousness is my races
[1:30:22] can be released or is released on a
[1:30:24] people that will so it's not a future
[1:30:25] event so people say well you know one
[1:30:28] day one day one day Lord you'll forgive
[1:30:31] me one day I'll be redeemed one day you
[1:30:33] know yo we're talking to someone in
[1:30:34] Chile Pedro and I and they were talking
[1:30:36] about this before we're about to pray I
[1:30:38] said no hold on I'm sorry but that's
[1:30:39] actually not right
[1:30:41] he already has done it
[1:30:43] it's not one day no no he he has already
[1:30:45] done this for us and we're going to pray
[1:30:47] and thank him you say well I don't feel
[1:30:49] it I don't yeah I don't think I'm quite
[1:30:51] there yet you thank him for what he's
[1:30:52] done then he can act on your behalf of
[1:30:55] what he's already done so he hath mate
[1:30:58] he has uh made him to be sin for us who
[1:31:01] knew no sin and everyone's very easily
[1:31:03] can rejoice in that he's our sin
[1:31:05] offering praise God that we might be
[1:31:07] made the righteous of God in him
[1:31:09] praise the Lord so if he became my son
[1:31:11] offering the most righteous as he is
[1:31:15] that should protect our emotions
[1:31:17] amen your father that should protect our
[1:31:19] heart our vital organs what was that a
[1:31:22] breastplate of righteousness
[1:31:24] Hallelujah amen and your feet shot with
[1:31:27] the preparation of the gospel of peace
[1:31:29] now it's interesting with the next one
[1:31:31] I'll just you know I'm just picking out
[1:31:33] a few here now above all
[1:31:35] now now in another translation I think
[1:31:37] it's the uh English Standard Version I
[1:31:39] saw last night it says and in all
[1:31:41] circumstances
[1:31:43] taking the shield of faith whereby ye
[1:31:46] shall quench the quench all can we put
[1:31:49] that up um Ephesians 6 and 16 are we
[1:31:52] yeah we're in now we I like this I like
[1:31:54] that all men this is the perfect Shield
[1:31:56] you know Israel's got its Iron Dome and
[1:31:58] David slinging we've got the baptism of
[1:32:01] the Holy Ghost you know
[1:32:04] see see above all so it doesn't say this
[1:32:07] about the breastplate or being good with
[1:32:09] truth or even the sort of through which
[1:32:11] is the word or the helmet of salvation
[1:32:13] but it's but it's this above all
[1:32:15] taking the shield of faith
[1:32:18] whereby you shall be able to quench all
[1:32:21] the fiery darts of the wicked amen no
[1:32:24] these fiery darts will shoot at you what
[1:32:26] are these fiery darts they're Satan's
[1:32:28] thoughts they are thoughts remember
[1:32:30] because because
[1:32:32] the devil the devil can put thoughts in
[1:32:36] your mind but it's what you do with them
[1:32:37] amen do you either do you either receive
[1:32:40] a package
[1:32:42] you either sign for it and then open its
[1:32:44] contents and then now it's all in your
[1:32:46] house in your house or do you take the
[1:32:48] box stomp on it and return to send it
[1:32:51] all right what do you do you know I
[1:32:53] think I think every every every every
[1:32:54] thought that comes into our mind that's
[1:32:56] contrary to the word of God
[1:32:58] stomp on it how do you stomp on it you
[1:33:00] actually tell devil actually no the
[1:33:02] Bible says this you're telling me this
[1:33:04] about this brother this is about the
[1:33:05] sister but they're part of me because by
[1:33:08] one Spirit we're baptized into one body
[1:33:10] amen they may have done this but they're
[1:33:12] part of me anyway and I can look beyond
[1:33:14] what they've done because we're one body
[1:33:16] Hallelujah sure I may have done that but
[1:33:18] I've repented of it amen the blood has
[1:33:20] washed it and now it's on your head man
[1:33:22] one day I want to preach about the
[1:33:23] burden of sin
[1:33:25] you know because we think about the Lord
[1:33:26] Jesus carrying that cross up Calvary all
[1:33:28] the sins of the world but you know the
[1:33:31] devil's getting this weight added to him
[1:33:32] day by day and day by day why because as
[1:33:35] the bride confesses her sins hardly all
[1:33:38] the sin that was attributed to us lands
[1:33:40] upon him and then when he comes up to
[1:33:42] the Judgment he's going to be bowed over
[1:33:44] and he can't he can't he can't get rid
[1:33:46] of this weight because it's actually
[1:33:48] part of him hallelujah amen oh yeah one
[1:33:51] day I want to preach on that the burden
[1:33:52] of sin amen Satan's got a bad Sin burden
[1:33:55] and he ain't got no cure Hallelujah
[1:33:58] praise the Lord amen hallelujah so so we
[1:34:02] can we can stop we can stop the we can
[1:34:05] quench them why by taking the shield of
[1:34:07] Faith now Faith is a revelation
[1:34:10] amen faith is a revelation so if the
[1:34:13] Lord has revealed you who he is in this
[1:34:15] hour that this message is more than a
[1:34:18] prophetic Ministry more than a Healing
[1:34:20] Ministry but as Jesus Christ himself
[1:34:22] revealing his word right it is Christ
[1:34:24] coming down to this end time revealing
[1:34:26] himself in the word right because the
[1:34:28] message is Jesus Christ reveal amen what
[1:34:30] is that now then you are built upon the
[1:34:32] rock of revelation of who Jesus Christ
[1:34:34] is not was but is amen so you can take
[1:34:38] that Revelation now
[1:34:40] and use it to quench every fiery Dart
[1:34:43] Hallelujah
[1:34:45] well how do you take that Revelation
[1:34:47] then well it's quite simple so for
[1:34:49] example the enemy fires a thought in
[1:34:50] your mind you ain't gonna make it
[1:34:53] but you can take the Revelation now the
[1:34:56] Lord's met me
[1:34:58] he's he's given me a provision in this
[1:35:00] day the full armor of God and the reason
[1:35:02] he's given me that provision is because
[1:35:04] I'm his child
[1:35:06] right remember remember this equipment
[1:35:08] is made for a certain group of soldiers
[1:35:11] is
[1:35:12] and they're predestinated soldiers right
[1:35:14] you think maybe you volunteered for this
[1:35:16] Army but your but your name was on the
[1:35:18] roll was on the was on the Army roster
[1:35:21] or whatever it's called before the
[1:35:22] foundation of the world the Lamb's Book
[1:35:24] of Life and that's why you're you're
[1:35:26] called into the army and that's why you
[1:35:28] accepted the call Here I Am Lord amen I
[1:35:31] sign up praise the Lord hallelujah see
[1:35:34] that's why we should never think a
[1:35:35] negative thought brother Bram says now
[1:35:37] don't think sitting here in the
[1:35:38] wheelchair you you're not that you're
[1:35:40] hopeless or helpless you're not don't
[1:35:41] let that negative thought ever pass
[1:35:43] through or don't let it anchor you can't
[1:35:45] help it going through your mind that's
[1:35:47] right but don't let it stop it's like
[1:35:49] the old farmer said I can't keep the
[1:35:51] birds from flying over my place but he
[1:35:53] had a double barrel shotgun I can sure
[1:35:55] keep them from roosting so you do the
[1:35:57] same thing too don't let them Roost you
[1:36:00] just let them pass right on through and
[1:36:02] here's a shotgun to use I mean both the
[1:36:04] Old and New Testament amen it's a double
[1:36:07] bell shotgun it's very good too I'll
[1:36:09] tell you it keeps them all away Harley
[1:36:12] what you know
[1:36:13] well we're talking about President
[1:36:15] talking about it you know you know how
[1:36:17] we say we're in a battle you know the
[1:36:18] devil's fighting us man he just turns up
[1:36:21] to get a pounding when you think about
[1:36:23] it you know he was against us but then
[1:36:26] who goes away licking their wounds who
[1:36:28] goes away carrying their dead and
[1:36:29] they're injured It Ain't Us amen because
[1:36:32] we've got a bar from Gilead right the
[1:36:33] Lord heals us in the battle right but
[1:36:35] now but the enemy taxes packs his
[1:36:37] soldiers back to hell why because they
[1:36:39] come against you they get a pounding I
[1:36:42] trust that happens in your life you know
[1:36:43] the devil starts afflicting you begin to
[1:36:45] pray God comes down sets you free Amy he
[1:36:48] starts working your family you begin to
[1:36:49] pray you let Love Project what happens
[1:36:51] he gets abounding Hallelujah
[1:36:54] I trust that's your experience
[1:36:56] hallelujah amen see it see it works real
[1:36:59] good you take the promises of God you
[1:37:01] begin to confess them they'll say that's
[1:37:03] firing a shot at the enemy
[1:37:05] Hallelujah and take the helmet of
[1:37:07] salvation and the sword of the spirit
[1:37:09] which is the word of God but then notice
[1:37:11] this now sometimes we forget the last
[1:37:13] part of the armor is Verse 18 praying
[1:37:16] always with all prayer and supplication
[1:37:19] in the spirit and watching there unto
[1:37:22] with all perseverance and supplication
[1:37:24] for All Saints so he's saying don't just
[1:37:27] pray for yourself no it's for All Saints
[1:37:31] amen CCC ow see this armor that we've
[1:37:34] put on
[1:37:35] the seventh part of it is prayer
[1:37:38] and I say that much it's the most
[1:37:40] important part because it actually
[1:37:41] brings God on the scene remember how the
[1:37:44] Lord Jesus when he was there and he was
[1:37:46] he was you know about to be crucified
[1:37:47] different things he says don't you know
[1:37:49] I could call my father it's in 12
[1:37:50] Legions of angels right she's basically
[1:37:53] saying I could pray right now and my
[1:37:55] father will hear my prayer and send 12
[1:37:57] Legions of angels and he could just
[1:37:59] change the whole scene by by one prayer
[1:38:02] now how much more now you and I redeemed
[1:38:05] by the blood you know we have more
[1:38:06] Authority in heaven than an archangel
[1:38:09] who never felt Gabriel Michael wormwood
[1:38:12] whoever it is you know the great most
[1:38:13] powerful are angels in the armies of
[1:38:16] heaven we have more Authority with God
[1:38:18] under the blood of Jesus Christ being
[1:38:20] his children Amen to those angels that
[1:38:22] never fell do you know that they can be
[1:38:24] talking to God about something and we go
[1:38:26] down on our knees and and God goes
[1:38:30] wait you're next in line
[1:38:33] sure this conversation isn't your your
[1:38:35] important wormwood but my child's
[1:38:38] talking to me my son my daughter we're
[1:38:40] having a conversation
[1:38:42] amen so prayer
[1:38:44] praying with all parents application in
[1:38:46] the spirit and watching there until with
[1:38:48] all perseverance and supplication for
[1:38:50] All Saints amen
[1:38:53] now see well what does the prayer do if
[1:38:56] we get wounded in the spirit we can pray
[1:38:59] right if a dart gets through
[1:39:02] we can pray
[1:39:03] amen
[1:39:05] father forgive them they don't know what
[1:39:06] they do if we fall then we we say look
[1:39:09] what do we do we pray we repent we get
[1:39:11] back up we have a high priest
[1:39:13] amen amen but what kind of prayer do we
[1:39:16] use
[1:39:17] because it's easy to say a prayer
[1:39:19] but the purpose of praying a prayer is
[1:39:22] that we're coming to the presence of God
[1:39:24] and he talks back to us right brother
[1:39:27] Brown would speak this in the Great
[1:39:28] Commission you'd say no
[1:39:30] he says he says did you ever just let me
[1:39:32] give you if I found Grace in your sight
[1:39:34] through God
[1:39:35] um he says take my word for this
[1:39:36] Brethren if you want to be a blessing
[1:39:37] and get a blessing when a man has done
[1:39:40] you wrong so basically if you want to be
[1:39:42] a blessing and get a blessing he says if
[1:39:44] you want so I'll just change it now if
[1:39:46] you want to have supplication watching
[1:39:48] the answer with all perseverance and
[1:39:49] supplication for All Saints so if you
[1:39:51] want to get a blessing and be a blessing
[1:39:53] amen when a man has done you wrong and
[1:39:56] he just and and he has absolutely justly
[1:39:59] I mean he's done you wrong and you know
[1:40:01] he's done you wrong he's done you evil
[1:40:03] don't mention that you take him to
[1:40:05] prayer before God so don't go tell
[1:40:07] everyone about it this is not your
[1:40:09] status on Facebook this person did this
[1:40:11] and this is a I'm going to put this on
[1:40:12] my gram and tell you tell the world that
[1:40:15] this is going to be on my Twitter feed
[1:40:16] and oh boy we're going to have a Twitter
[1:40:18] storm because brother sister so-and-so
[1:40:20] did this and X and Y and Z no don't tell
[1:40:22] anyone about it
[1:40:24] put down your phone
[1:40:26] right get off WhatsApp
[1:40:29] and pray
[1:40:31] yes I'm trying to bring it into out
[1:40:32] because it can be abstract let's let's
[1:40:35] bring it on now see how we respond to
[1:40:37] things really proves see Abraham his
[1:40:39] response
[1:40:40] was a Godly response
[1:40:42] God's able to provide him himself a lamb
[1:40:45] right
[1:40:47] what should our response be to all
[1:40:49] things
[1:40:50] because remember it's like this
[1:40:53] the only way I know this is because this
[1:40:56] could be any this could be any colorless
[1:40:58] solvent could be methanol could be
[1:41:01] isopropanol it could be it could be many
[1:41:04] different things right hexane
[1:41:07] anything okay the only way I know what
[1:41:10] it is is if I take the cap off and I I
[1:41:13] taste it I pour it out
[1:41:15] and it's and it's the same thing with us
[1:41:16] as believers
[1:41:18] we're filled with the Holy Ghost
[1:41:21] well how do we know
[1:41:23] Trouble Comes
[1:41:26] right the lid comes off
[1:41:28] and then what's really on the inside
[1:41:29] comes out
[1:41:31] it's easy to say this is water
[1:41:35] you got to taste and see
[1:41:37] it's water
[1:41:38] right and but it's by experience I can
[1:41:41] say now this is water
[1:41:43] so it should be now by experience
[1:41:45] between one another we can say that
[1:41:47] person's a real Christian
[1:41:48] right I got so mad at them and I just
[1:41:51] did the most carnal stupid thing and
[1:41:53] what did they do
[1:41:55] they prayed for me they loved me more
[1:41:57] they're pre I say they are they are a
[1:42:00] great
[1:42:01] Heavenly water
[1:42:03] right but if they started shooting and
[1:42:05] scrapping and doing all kinds of things
[1:42:07] and what's happened in trouble I'd say
[1:42:09] no that's butane well that's hexane
[1:42:12] it's a poison by the way it'll kill you
[1:42:15] don't drink it
[1:42:16] stay out of the solvent cabinet kits
[1:42:19] foreign
[1:42:20] you see so what's in US comes out when
[1:42:23] Trouble Comes
[1:42:25] amen so now
[1:42:27] Hallelujah he's done you wrong he's done
[1:42:29] you evil don't mention that you take him
[1:42:31] to prayer before God and don't take it
[1:42:33] in just a selfish way and say well I'm
[1:42:36] supposed to do this but stand with your
[1:42:39] shoulder to his shoulder and stand in
[1:42:41] the prince of God our Father weigh and
[1:42:44] say a prayer uh sorry way of prayer
[1:42:47] should be in the prince of God and say
[1:42:49] father here's my brother he just he
[1:42:51] deserves punishment because he's done me
[1:42:53] evil and I don't see why he did it then
[1:42:55] let God go to talking to you
[1:42:58] see this is prayer then let God go to
[1:43:01] talking to you and you'll see maybe what
[1:43:04] the man's been through the devil has
[1:43:05] twisting him up somewhere and caused
[1:43:07] them to do that though he's absolutely
[1:43:09] wrong before you leave the Throne of God
[1:43:11] you'll be feeling sorry for that man
[1:43:14] you'll be sympathizing with that brother
[1:43:16] and when you get back down to Earth
[1:43:18] again you'll go over to that brother and
[1:43:21] shake his hand because you know what
[1:43:22] he's been through you can't stand with a
[1:43:25] mortal in the presence of God and
[1:43:27] condemn anybody I don't believe no sir
[1:43:30] even if he is a rank sinner
[1:43:33] this is not even about Christians now
[1:43:34] this is about the whole world they could
[1:43:36] have such a vendetta against you and
[1:43:38] they can plan things and they can do
[1:43:40] horrible things but if you could impress
[1:43:42] stand with them shoulder to shoulder
[1:43:43] it's like you're praying with them you
[1:43:45] go to Before the Throne of God God
[1:43:47] begins to reveal to you what they've
[1:43:48] been to why they're like that and then
[1:43:50] when you get back down you can't have
[1:43:52] those same feelings against them you
[1:43:54] know many times it's like the kids you
[1:43:56] know one will say this one did this to
[1:43:58] me deal with them dad but when the shoes
[1:44:01] are on the other foot they want Mercy
[1:44:03] they just want Mercy
[1:44:06] and that's how we are as human beings
[1:44:08] sometimes if we're carnal deal with them
[1:44:11] God
[1:44:12] bring them to a place
[1:44:15] no
[1:44:16] we shouldn't be like that I'm not trying
[1:44:18] to be humorous but that's how we feel
[1:44:19] sometimes no but but that's not real
[1:44:22] prayer that's just saying a selfish
[1:44:23] prayer
[1:44:24] no we should be able to pray in such a
[1:44:26] way when God's got done talking with us
[1:44:29] then we can really stand in their shoes
[1:44:31] and actually love them more
[1:44:33] and that doesn't say anything about it
[1:44:35] they've asked forgiveness or not that's
[1:44:36] got nothing to do with it
[1:44:38] amen we don't pray for people intercede
[1:44:40] for them just because they say sorry
[1:44:42] Hallelujah no amen amen we should
[1:44:45] practice even people it doesn't matter
[1:44:47] what they've done said sorry not sorry
[1:44:49] ah sorry pretend to be sorry whatever
[1:44:51] more we should love them anyhow now what
[1:44:53] about a brother that's made that that
[1:44:55] has made a mistake though I say he's
[1:44:57] wrong sometimes he's accused wrong when
[1:44:59] he's not wrong but if he is wrong well
[1:45:01] if we will take him to the throne of God
[1:45:03] stand shoulder to shoulder with our
[1:45:05] brother knowing he's Immortal and maybe
[1:45:07] this maybe his destination I I I I
[1:45:10] really wish I put this up there and
[1:45:12] maybe his destination rests upon our
[1:45:14] attitude towards him
[1:45:16] maybe our attitude
[1:45:19] I mean his destination rest upon our
[1:45:21] attitude towards him
[1:45:23] just an attitude
[1:45:25] not even a deed or a word our attitude
[1:45:29] well he deserves it
[1:45:31] where are you sending him
[1:45:33] where are you sending him potentially
[1:45:34] with that attitude
[1:45:35] see we should man Lord Jesus
[1:45:38] oh my amen when we come back from the
[1:45:41] Throne of God we'll realize that we're
[1:45:44] everyone guilty and we all need help one
[1:45:47] from the other and the best way to do is
[1:45:50] pray
[1:45:54] after you've really been the prince of
[1:45:56] God you see it's amazing when you see
[1:45:58] people who are in The Prince have got a
[1:45:59] lot of soft
[1:46:01] and they're loving and they're warm and
[1:46:04] they're forgiving and they're gentle why
[1:46:06] because they've been the prince of their
[1:46:08] creator and they realize you know you
[1:46:11] all need help we all need the Lord right
[1:46:14] but then those who are not in the prince
[1:46:16] of God that much or at all they become
[1:46:18] sticky and hard and and judgmental and
[1:46:20] all these different things
[1:46:22] so I said Lord help us I'm just going to
[1:46:24] finish there this morning

[1:46:30] equipment
