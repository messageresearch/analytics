thank you musician think about our band I mean I'm glad it's going home time I mean but before we go home we've got a job to do let's finish well shall we I mean God bless you all it's great to have Yvonne here tonight let's turn to Genesis chapter 6 I'm going to read a couple of scriptures here and then with them we're gonna go to Psalms 100 and 133 then we have a time of Prayer if we speak for just um just briefly but so I'm sorry Genesis 16 verses thought 13 and 14 and God said unto Noah the end of all flesh has come before me for the earth is filled with violence through them and behold I will destroy them with the earth make their ark of gopher wood rooms shalt thou make in the Ark and shalt pitch it within and without with pitch let's go to Psalm 133 verse 1 behold how good and how pleasant it is for brethren to dwell together in unity it is like the precious ointment upon the head which ran down upon the beard even Aaron's beard that it went down to the skirts of his garments as a Jew of Hermon and as a Jew that descended upon the mountains of Zion for there the law commanded the blessing even life forevermore I mean let's bow our heads in a word of Prayer if you ever need just want to raise your hand to God while we're in his presence Lord Jesus we are so thankful that we can sing into us as more than a song it's a reality we're going home there's nothing holding us here dear God we've heard that we've heard your call from another dimension law from glory and thank you you put something in us to respond to your word and say Lord Jesus thank you for making a way that we can come home Lord to wash us in your blood Lord - Lord to give a perfect lamb Oh God to wash all spot and wrinkle and sin away and dear Lord us to just pray father as we gathered Lord under this roof tonight Lord at this time of prayer lord I pray you'll just move among us Lord may you speak to every heart dear God Lord we don't want to just go through emotion and just have a church service but lord I pray you'd come anoint each life Lord Jesus Lord may we get in the spirit Lord of your word dear God may we get into the spirit of the composer dear Lord Jesus father Lord would you move on our hearts our God father may we just lay aside the busyness of the week and lord of today and maybe tomorrow and lord we just want to commit our lives into your hands may we be hidden under your blood oh god father under the shadow of thy wings and Lord may you move on every heart Lord may you anoint your word and dear God may you come and live among us like never before granted dear God

pray your blessings upon the word and be at those who couldn't be here tonight as well Lord we lift them into your presence by prayer as well and Jesus Christ name Amen and then god bless your friends you may have your seats what I want to speak very quickly about we we have a job to do now we read there in Genesis chapter 6 where where I was instructed to to build the Ark and and we understand that Noah the the the would that he got it was very porous you know if you put it in water it just absorbs all the water and you know absorbs everything that's around it but the pitch that he actually sealed the Ark worth kept the world out and it became a it actually change the properties of that wood from being very porous to being actually very strong that it could withstand anything that would bump against it and it's exactly what has happened to us you know the scripture says that men are like trees you know he says you know we'll be like trees planted by the water side and you know even I think Balaam said about Israel they're like ello trees and you know and and and as Jesus when he would heal the blind man one of them and Andy Andy and he told the blind man to look he says I see ministries and he prayed for again he looked normally so men are his trees now we were once built in a certain way where we could absorb anything of this world we were porous you know the whatever wind of doctrine would come whatever spirit was moving through the country whatever was trending I mean we would just adopt that trend we'd become one with it because we were porous but then even before that ever happened the Lord prepared himself a tree and he took that tree and he cut that tree down he took the SAP out of that tree a manatee poured it into all many other trees amen so that we are now like the Lord so now we don't absorb a min the world holy there's something that's covered us inside and out they meant to keep the world out and brother Brown would say about about the are cases he says you know but let's notice then that God told Noah to pitch this Ark put pitch in it on the inside and on the outside both sides well then I've seen what picture was made out if it was a pine tree a hard tree that was cut down an evergreen tree ever a live tree oh yeah our Lord is a he's alive forevermore I mean I hey men and it was cut down and they beat the tree with a beating iron until they beat the rosin out of it and they put the rosin in a pot and boil it until it became real real hot and then this hot rossum was poured upon this gopher wood and it open it just soaked it in and it become full of this rosin and when it once full of that rosin it settled and setup it was harder than steel and I thought that sent Lord get a good old open-hearted person and pour in that pitch which is the Holy Ghost into the believe with the Holy Spirit and fire until they're so soaked full they're not their selves anymore then she can blunt the waves bump against the logs knock them out of the way keep on going hallelujah the only thing that can stand the judgments today is a born-again Christian filled with the Holy Ghost God heat the holy God hid the Spirit of God and poured it upon them and soaked us his whole being full amen I like that need then he can really shove out and into the devil's territory without looking left or right he's talking about you I mean you've been filled with an oil hallelujah that changed your properties of your life where once you absorbed everything everything in this world but God poured in oil and do you hardly think I'm harder than steel you can you can be pushed out to the devil's territory come what way I mean you just go straight through hallelujah I mean without looking left or right I mean that's what the believer is he's actually poured he soft hard and God just pours him full of divine love that he can brace the divine judgments that God's it I mean I mean the divine judgments that sent of God and it carried Noah through now you could individually if you take the ark just for a brief moment you could take each individual but a wood that will comprise that ark you could fill it with pitch and it would float but it had to come together to contain life the ark had to be built for life to be preserved and it's the same thing I mean with a body of believers you know all of us I believe by God's grace and if you haven't been I pray by the end of this meeting you will be we're being filled with the Holy Ghost I mean we'll be made new creatures in Christ God has changed us he's changed our very nature to match his nature I mean by the spirit within us so we will go above the judgment just like the ark did but I mean but as individually and your just as individuals I mean we could never hold life as much as a body now we right there in psalms 133 I'm not gonna be very long on these remarks bro just I just pray we would we would look at you know we're here for a reason we're here for a divine reason we're not here just to go through a religious act but we're here for a reason and the reason and and we still have a purpose upon the earth that's the reason time are still going on the rapture hasn't happened yet the bride has a purpose and we're going to get into the rhythm we're going to get into that purpose a god what is the your will for my life right now and we notice when we read in Psalm 133 I trust you notice it anyway it says how pleasant it is for brethren to dwell together in unity and David would pick that up and say unity it says it's like the pressure precious ointment upon the head that ran down upon the beard even Aaron's beard that went down to the skirts of his garment so now Aaron we understand was the high priest he had to be anointed to fulfill the high priests office I mean he was like any way any other man but God called him for a specific role and we know the high priest wing and once a year into the Holy of Holies with the blood on behalf of the people no other priest could do it no one else could do it it was him but he had to be anointed to fulfill his role upon the earth and the Apostle I mean sorry David is saying here that unity among the Brethren must be there in order for the body to fulfill its role he is likening unity in a body as the same as Aaron being anointed to fulfill the role of the high priest so saying this is why it's so pleasant for brethren to dwell together in unity they can fulfill their purpose upon the earth more than just being a group of people gathered more than just a church but they can fulfill God's divine call amen in their lives that's how that's how important unity really is amen and it's more than and I'm not talking about unity for the sake of it but when brother L says we're in the revelation you get those people together when revelation is flowing in harmony you watch it then winner where the revelation of the word not thee not the mental understanding not a conformity to something but when God divinely reveals himself to a people you get those people together they should recognize the living word and each other and if you can recognize God the word and one another then you can work together you know I was thinking about the Ark you know some of the Ark you know some of it was very big bits of timber you had that you had to kill a big bit of timber you you had the ribs very big bits of timber but then you said very small bits and something you may never ever see but it had a job just like when you build a house every bit of Timbers important it's got a roll and and David would say I'd rather be a doormat or a doorkeeper in the house of God I mean them then dwell in the tents of the wicked so he's saying I don't care what part I am as long as I'm part of the body it's the same thing with the Ark you know ff1 but it would could recognize the other bit we're all part of this ark for the saving of people's lives I mean it wouldn't matter where they were fit and the and the boat as long as our part of the boat it's the same thing I could be a little bit of wood under a step somewhere I don't care as long as I'm part of the boat then I'm happy because I have a purpose amen and we all have a purpose doesn't matter what part of the body it is we all have a purpose I mean like I think I've said before you know you may never ever think about the smallest bone in your little toe until you hurt your toe amen and then you realize that bone has great importance amen it's like yes yo some parts of the body you see other parts you don't see but it's the hidden parts that are the most important parts I mean but every part every joint supplies the need now Aaron Aaron would be instructed in numbers chapter 16 and maybe I'm just jumping here to myself but they all say there was a dispute came up with Cora and Dathan and then and then de 'then and cora thy swallowed up by the earth and and but still the influence of those men upon the congregation of israel they even said to Aaron and Moses you've killed the people of God and God just got fed up with the children of Israel he says I'm just going to consume them in a moment and there was a plague plague begin to fall among Israel and and and Matt and Aaron and Moses fell upon their faces then Moses said to Aaron take a sensor put fire then in from off the altar and put on incense and go quickly into the Congre gation and make an atonement for them for their a stress going out from the Lord the plague has begun now we know there is a death plague in this day I mean there's a death plague in this day and Aaron took as Moses commanded I ran into the midst of the congregation and behold the plague was begun among the people and he put on incense and made an atonement for the people and he stood between the dead and the living and the plague was stayed this was part of Aaron's job to stand between the living and the dead this is how important his role was he took that sense of filled her with incense we know incense is the prayers of the people you've got to recognize how powerful your prayers are I mean your prayers can change the world your prayers can change a nation your prayers can change history that one person in the hands of God can change the world I mean you better look at yourself and say God you've called me for this hour you've called me for a reason I mean it doesn't matter how small you think you are you're important to God holy is to Aaron with the center I mean this this the sense of instance he stood between the dead and the living to stop the plague I mean that's how important it is I mean not to look at people with a critical way but to recognize you've got the prayer of faith I mean you can stand between the living and the dead I mean you can stand there in the brief between the people and stop the plague of death striking hallelujah that's how important you are I mean it's not just a casual thing to pray I mean your prayers have more power than God then and I can't you're talking to them Harley because you've been redeemed by the blood Amen you God's love has been poured out upon you you're very important to God hallelujah so you've got to recognize your prayers are important the devil will think that you not getting nowhere but heaven is moving on the account of your prayers you say well my prayers don't mean too much there was a man and a woman there were Israelis living in earth living in Egypt one day and they begin to read description they begin to recognize the delivery was going to come and and and ramen and and Jakob ate I think was the woman's name you know and RAM was so consumed and he would brother bran would tell us he would yes there's a slave and he'd go work in the fields would they he'd get beaten he'd get what are you mistreated but he had come home and he'd go up on the housetop and he'd begin to call out upon Jehovah God and call that say God where's this delivery of your promise you said we'd be in the promised land the time is coming to an end we're not we can't stay here no more because your word says we're leaving and and Jakob it would Sam ma'am wait what are you you know you're so tired you're so wore out you're so you know why don't you let someone else Prairie says no but the but I've got the burden I'm in the burdens mine I know sure but you know he was stirred up because he saw a prophecy was going to be fulfilled in his day and so he he was there calling on God and then God came hallelujah and answered their prayers and Berthe deliver into their house I mean they had Moses hallelujah that's how important I mean his name wasn't written in the scripture but he was part of that prophecy and God moved on his heart I mean those hard people was just a sincere heart to God God meets that heart well you say well we just we just coasting along no we're not this year I pray will be different I mean we'll just have more than just church in a nice time no I pray this this year is different I mean you got to recognize that your God has built lead for a certain way at the body just like I said on Wednesday I mean last week I was talking to Christine on the phone and my girls are singing in the background as they're driving and heavenly armor will enter the land the battle belongs to Lord and I was walking in the car Plomin sook she she comes stands in front of me I still remember seeing a do it points to the scripture goes and gets a toy mask gives it to him and then and then he just broke down says the Lord spoke to me and four weeks before that he is saying where's this telephone we can talk to God he said God just spoke out of a two-year-old ain't man and told me I need to take off my religious mask and obey the word and he got baptized a my Lord Jesus Christ and he's made a different man ever since Allu yeah now and I'm not saying that because it's my daughter no God can use anyone to the natural it may just seem like a little child that's just busy running around but God said I'm going to anoint that one to do that hallelujah yeah I hope you don't mind if I say brother Kayla but we're now at first in our house he had this big mind battle if he's going to make it to the rapture or not big all the devil had him in a corner lilius ones room wanders into the room and says and you glad Caleb we're going in the rapture she said that a and it just broke hallelujah our God is alive now she doesn't normally talk that way if you're wondering she doesn't rapture it's not her every second word but you're an important part of the body you're important you have great value you're worth more than ten thousand worlds holy and you wake up and you just think you're just little old you and God's looking at you and you're and you're in God's mind and you're important to him and God wants to use you like never before you know we're called to be living epistles written on of all men this message must put on flesh hallelujah and it is putting on flesh more than books more than quotes more than scriptures on the wall but a Living Word of Living God I mean God putting on flesh and his bride Holly that's how important you are amen so so he was commanded to run and stand between the living and the dead and your praise can change someone's life hallelujah singing a song you saying something could change someone's life now Jesus would tell a parable and and and I always love this scripture we'll just finish on the scripture but there's a time when Jesus was sitting in a house and he was he was speaking he was preaching in this house and there were there was a man who was on a cot and he couldn't walk he you know he was sick but his friends his friends had a burden we must get him into the presence of Jesus of Nazareth and they couldn't get through the door they couldn't get through the window no no this is more than a story this is more than a story what I was right this is this is faith in action and so so they couldn't get remember they had a revelation this is the Christ we just need to get him into his presence get him into the presence of the word amen and then all of our friends problems will be taken away and so they couldn't get him in the door they couldn't get him in the window they couldn't carry him and so something moved on them we're gonna take this place apart waking up we're gonna make a Sun roof they carried him up on the roof they begin to take the tiles away Jesus is down there they saw maybe maybe they lifted the first tile he's there undo those ones and maybe the man's on the cautious laying there thinking well these guys doing what they doing but their faith has moved they had a burden we're not just gonna leave our friend in this condition they're gonna he's gonna get into the prints of the Son of Man he's gonna be changed I mean so so so they finally took the tiling off enough and in the man I just thinking about the men's laying on his back on this on this couch and they said all this cot and they tell him stay still they're gonna pick it up tied ropes to every four corner they begin to lower him down and as this man is lying on his back he's just looking into the sunshine seeing his friends lower him down and then he comes finally I don't know if everyone got a bit quiet when they saw this man being lorded you know but finally this man was laying on this couch and he looked into the eyes of a man and it was a different kind of look more than a religion more than a church service more than just teaching here was the creator he was the one that could heal all disease and then it's amazing it's seasoned so so I'm in Luke chapter 5 and it says in verse 20 and when he saw their faith he didn't see the man on the catches faith he saw their faith that lured him down into the prints of the Son of Man says when he saw their faith your prayers can remove tiles your prayers can remove hindrance aim in your life you can actually cause walls to be to be evaporated you can cause obstacles and we take you out of the way that people can get into the presence of God that's why I said it's more than a story this is a reality this is you say little old me yes you see how powerful your life is you can literally when you can't get them through even maybe the door of a church or the window I mean to where God is you can get them into his presence I mean wherever you may be you can remove the obstacles many times we think of our prayers knowing and you know your are they even doing any good in heavens moving God has an appointed time I mean the prodigal son had a journey quite a long way he had to spend a lot of money he had to get to a certain condition but when he got to the Pigpen brother Ram says the angel Lord came came to that Pigpen where he was hallelujah then he came to himself I meant sometimes we think is God really hearing my prayers he's right on time you ought to keep in confidence the Lord's heard the prayer the cry of my people I'm in head and and he will answer see here he was he looked into the eyes of a man it was different look this man see because when he saw their faith he said unto Him man my sins are forgiven me he was a man who was crippled maybe here's thinking this man could heal him but we know our Lord goes deeper than just natural healing it says thy sins are forgiven thee and the scribes and the Pharisees begin to Reason saying who is this which speakers blasphemies who can forgive sins but God alone oh my but when Jesus perceived their thoughts he answering said unto them why reason ye in your hearts whither is easy to say thy sins be forgiven there you also rise up and walk that you may know that the Son of man has power upon earth to forgive sins he said unto the sick of palsy I sound to the arise take up that couch and go to thine house and a measely immediately he rose up before them took up that wrong he lay and departed to his own house glorifying God hallelujah to me that's more than a story your faith your faith can lower a person into the prison's of God and their sins can be forgiven your faith so I say we've got a job to do we're here for a purpose you're not here just to fill the seat we're not here just to fill seats and sing and just go through emotion we're here for a purpose you say God manifests your purpose in my life may your work put on flesh move me into what I'm called to be and you but you actually find yourself naturally going into that position how blessed it is help pleasing it is for unity to dwell for the Britain to dwell together in unity it is like the precious ointment upon the head that ran down upon the beard even Aaron's beard and went down to the skirts of his garments that's how precious unity is we can fulfill our role upon the earth listen we can go to places with God that I just say it this way the bride can go to places with God that other people can't because we're his wife I mean we've got a relationship it's very different to the servant hallelujah we can speak to him amen and and we can move his heart I'd say in a greater way than 10 servants can I mean there's nothing like the voice of your spouse Holly it moves your heart like you know knowing others voice to us and it's like when you talk to God something stirs in his heart oh my honey bee is talking to me hallelujah what do you have need of glory had to love affairs or not let's house your feet amen you are important to God your priest can change the world I mean this world is falling apart I say Lord may we come together as one like never before may every part of the body just just function may we just be like one heart one mind one Accord I mean the guy could just come down hallelujah that we can take people and we can we can like those men their faith got that man sins forgiven it wasn't her sin I mean I mean I mean sorry it wasn't his faith it was his friends faith that got his sins forgiven him that's how important prayer is that's amen so I'm gonna leave it there I think we should pray all together amen you say well I've heard this before well you just heard it again we can't get slothful let's press the battle this could be the last year we ever have let's have a different kind of year you know sometimes we have in our mind well the message uses me like this and church will be like this and well I've read that chapter before so it'll just be like this don't let God speak to you every when you open the scripture said well I've written a million times the million million and one could be the difference I meant that could be the one that changes you I've heard that message before but the next time could be the different one where he speaks you like never before I say God come and move on our hearts amen may your work be finished may your divine plan be finished in this earth I mean there's many lost and dying in this world God back we may we felt overflowing your kingdom amen let's let's give the invitation Amen one soul is worth more than ten thousand worlds and that's the one thing I want to see this year soul saved I want to see people transform literally before my eyes I mean that's why I want to see shackles broken their past God I'm in the blood washing them see the power of God in every life that's what I want to see Amen he say can I do the job absolutely now he you read in the book of Zechariah there was Josh the high priests and and and he was closed and filthy rags and Satan was here to withstand him then the angel Lord said Satan I rebuke thee and he had to leave then he commanded that Joshua would his rags will be taken out of the way and a miter will be put upon us hit him and and priests garments put upon him now the devil's there to fight you coming to your position amen but the angel Lord is present amen to rebuke the Devourer amen to rebuke the devil I mean that you can come to your god-given place now remember Joshua will always was the high
