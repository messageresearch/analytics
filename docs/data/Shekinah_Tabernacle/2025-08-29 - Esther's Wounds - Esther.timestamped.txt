[0:01] Amen. But you see now our wounds, God wants to use our wounds. God uses our wounds to bring us
[0:10] to a position. But does he really? Yeah, he does. This is Esther. Esther was an orphan girl. That's
[0:20] a big wound. I was blessed enough to to to to have both parents in the same house growing up. They're
[0:27] still together. Thank the Lord. Right. And my my my mom's parents were next door to us growing up
[0:34] and also my great uncle. So, I had I had I had a wonderful family circle around me growing up. So,
[0:39] I don't know what it's like to not have a mama or a dad or be an orphan, but it's a big hole. God
[0:44] can fill that hole, right? God is father to the fatherless, right? But you see now she was so this
[0:51] wound came into her life where she was an orphan. But God allowed, you know, isn't it amazing?
[0:58] God allowed Israel to fall in idolatry. You got to look at the domino effect to get Esther here.
[1:03] It's a big domino effect, right? It started off with with the split of the kingdoms with the
[1:08] son of Solomon and you know Jeroboam and Riaboam. Jeroboam made the two golden calves. Idolatry came
[1:14] in. All there's a domino effect starting to come. But the whole reason God allowed it is because a
[1:20] son of Aag and Amalachite had to be taken care of. This is this is Hmon. He was the Agite, the
[1:26] son of, you know, he's an Amalachite, the ancient enemy of the Jews, right? So now God allows this
[1:31] domino effect to come that finally we have this scene hundreds of years later. But you see her
[1:36] wounding caused her to be raised in Shusham. Her wounding caused her to be an orphan. Her wounding
[1:44] caused her to be there and then be picked. Wasn't married for whatever reason. We don't know,
[1:49] right? But God allowed all that to happen that she would end up in this position as queen of of
[1:56] of the superpower of the age. And she was carrying this secret of her identity. I am the bride. I'm
[2:04] the queen. The king by his grace has placed me in this position. We're carrying this mystery,
[2:10] too. The devil looks at you and can't quite see it, just like he couldn't quite see our Lord Jesus
[2:16] on the cross being the Messiah himself. But he is carrying the mystery of redemption. And then here,
[2:22] here comes Esther. She's carrying this mystery. This is what to me is so beautiful about the
[2:26] message. It reveals who God is. It reveals who you are. It also reveals who Satan is. Right? And so
[2:34] now here is here is Esther. This is at the second banquet of wines. And between the first and second
[2:39] banquet, the king can't sleep. And the book comes open. The record comes open about Mori saving the
[2:44] king's life. So what happens? The seals come off the book. And then and then when the seals come
[2:49] off the book, there's a whole role reversal goes on because in the beginning of this whole scene,
[2:54] the Jews are under a death sentence. But at the end of it, after the book comes open,
[2:58] Hmon's under the death sentence. Hallelujah. Amen. So now the book comes open. Esther stands in her
[3:05] God-given position carrying this mystery. Heymon, I know who you are. You're an Amalachite. You're
[3:10] my enemy. Isn't it amazing? She came out of the tribe of Benjamin. Saul was out of the tribe of
[3:14] Benjamin. King Saul. Saul did not finish the job like he was told to. So God raised up someone of
[3:20] that same tribe to break that stigma and finish the job. Amen. It's like many things in our lives
[3:25] from our forebears, they could not overcome. But God raises you up. Amen. To break that
[3:30] thing. Amen. that you would stand on its head and prove Satan, you put this in my lineage,
[3:35] but I'm going to finish it by the power of God. Hallelujah. Amen. So, there she is. She's carrying
[3:41] the secret. The king doesn't know who she is. Oh, she's Esther, a star. She was more than that. She
[3:48] was Hadassa one hidden. I think it means star. Esther means star, right? And then so finally,
[3:54] now she's carrying this mystery. I know who my enemy is. I know who I am. And then she reveals
[3:59] the whole thing to the king in order to turn the wrath of the king against Hmon. Praise the Lord.
[4:06] And then he his whole scheme of making the gallows against Mori. He hangs on his own scheme. He hangs
[4:12] on his own gallows. He's lifted up high. And then now what's happens? The signant ring that that
[4:17] that Hmon was given by the king is now in Esther's hand. And she has the authority and power to write
[4:22] a new law which overcomes what Hmon has already given. Amen. All because of wounds. She ended up
[4:31] there because of w I know there's probably a small you got to look at the magnitude of her
[4:34] life. Maybe just go think about these things. But God allowed those wounds to get her there that
[4:41] salvation would come to her people. Life would be preserved. And I'm going to close with that. How
[4:47] much you and I you say well I don't understand my life. We don't necessarily need to understand
[4:52] everything that happened in our life but we need to come to a peace in our hearts. God, you've
[4:57] allowed it that life would be preserved. That you can take these wounds, Lord, and manifest yourself
[5:02] through them. That they're a testimony now that they can help someone else. Amen. So, thank God
[5:08] for the wounds. Amen. Thank God. Lord, you want to prove yourself in the wounding. No one likes pain,
[5:17] but we got to count it all joy. There's a purpose in the pain. There's a purpose in the wounding.
[5:22] Can we have the musicians, please? Um, tonight I'll finish there. I've been a bit long. Sorry.
